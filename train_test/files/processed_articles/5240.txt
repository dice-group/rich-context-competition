In 2011, an estimated 20.6 million persons aged\n12 or older (i.e., 8% of the population) met the criteria for substance abuse or dependence\nduring the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n[SAMHSA], 2012). Substance abuse bears a large economic footprint in addition to its\nimpact on the lives of individuals. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse\n(CASA) estimated that the total governmental expenditure on substance abuse at all three\nlevels of government (i.e., federal, state, and local) totaled 467.7 billion dollars, or more\nYoung adults are of special interest in efforts to reduce the societal burden imposed\nby substance abuse. In 2011, 60.8% of full-time college students were current drinkers,\nwhile 39.1% were binge drinkers and 13.6% were heavy drinkers. For young adults who\nwere not enrolled full time in college, these figures were observed at 52.0, 35.4, and 10.5%,\nrespectively (SAMHSA, 2012). An estimated 39.5% of young adults currently use tobacco\nproducts (SAMHSA, 2012). Young adults also abuse illicit substances, of which marijuana\nuse is most prevalent by a wide margin. About 21% of young adults were current users of\nillicit substances, with 19.0% reporting that they were marijuana users (SAMHSA, 2012).\nYoung adult substance abuse has been linked to many adverse outcomes such as\nincreased delinquency (Nation and Heflinger, 2006), impaired cognitive functioning\n(Jacobus, Bava, Cohen-Zion, Mahmood, and Tapert, 2009), emotional distress (Goldstein,\n2011), respiratory problems and lung cancer (CDC, 1994), and accidents or other behaviors\nthat lead to serious medical injury and death (Miller, Naimi, Brewer, and Jones, 2007;\nPompili et al., 2012). This study brings life history theory to bear on substance use during\nyoung adulthood. If life history variables can explain substantial variation in substance use\nduring this period, there may be impetus for leveraging the literature on human life\nhistories to improve substance abuse prevention and treatment.\nLife history theory\nEvolutionary psychology attempts to discover how the brain changes the\nenvironment to facilitate the reproduction of the organism (Hagen, 2005). To transform the\nenvironment in a manner conducive to reproduction, brains must drive humans to find food\nand mates, best competitors, avoid predators and pathogens, and help kin (Buss, 2009;\nHagen, 2005). To accomplish these tasks, humans convert bio-energetic resources into\nsurvival and reproductive strategies (Chisholm, 1993; Del Giudice, 2009; Figueredo et al.,\nLife history theory (LHT) is a mid-level evolutionary theory that provides an\naccount of what survival and reproductive strategies humans invest in given their genes and\nthe environments they inhabit (Chisholm, 1993; Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, and Schlomer,\nalong a spectrum from early reproduction and allocation of resources toward mating effort,\nto later reproduction and devotion of resources toward somatic and parental effort\nof reproductive strategy has recently been referred to as the fast\u00adto\u00adslow life history\ncontinuum in the human behavior and evolution literature (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006).\nLife history and substance abuse\nBehaviors and traits such as risk-taking, short-term thinking, anti-sociality, earlier sexual\ndebut, and acquisition of greater numbers of sexual partners have been observed to reflect a\nfaster life history strategy (LHS). Behaviors and traits such as careful consideration of\nrisks, long-term thinking, cooperation, greater sexual restrictedness, and better mental and\nphysical health have been observed to reflect a slower LHS (for reviews, see Ellis et al.,\n2009; Figueredo et al., 2006). Fast LHS appears to be a facultative response to harsh and\nunpredictable environments, whereas slow LHS seems to stem from safety and\nLife history strategy and substance use\nSeveral scholars have brought LHT to bear on substance use theoretically and\nempirically (Hill and Chow, 2002; Jones and Figueredo, 2007; Richardson and Hardesty,\n2012). They have argued that LHT provides a powerful explanatory tool that can provide\nnew insights into the etiology of substance abuse and also help identify novel targets for\nprevention and treatment interventions (e.g., Richardson and Hardesty, 2012). Research has\nindicated that the brain experiences substances as biologically valuable via their\nmodulation of basic motivational systems (i.e., via their effects on dopamine transmission\nVolkow, Fowler, Wang, Swanson, and Telang, 2007). As mentioned, research also suggests\nthat human behaviors coordinate within overall life history strategies that function to\ntranslate biologically valuable resources (e.g., food) into mating effort or somatic and\ntheoretical synthesis of LHT and dual process models of cognition, Richardson and\nHardesty (2012) used cognitive science to integrate these findings and suggested that once\nwe know where individuals fall along the life history spectrum, we also have information\nabout their liability for substances use. The authors predicted that liability for substance use\nreflects a fast LHS because reliance on implicit or automatic cognitive processing (adapted\nto harsh and unpredictable environments) underpins fast LHS and also renders humans\nvulnerable to the signals of biological value that psychoactive substances provide. From\nthis perspective, substance use is generally seen as a byproduct of a psychological\nadaptation to harsh and unpredictable social conditions.\nConsistent with the above, research has suggested that particular types of substance\nuse coordinate with fast life history traits. For example, studies have linked college student\nmating effort to smoking (Jones and Figueredo, 2007) and also indicated that alcohol use\ncoordinated with fast life history traits (Hill and Chow, 2002). Research has also linked fast\nLHS to lower levels of executive functioning (Figueredo, Gladden, and Beck, 2011). This\nsuggests that fast life history strategists may rely on implicit processing, which operates at\nthe expense of the prefrontal explicit or deliberative processes (Lieberman, 2007; van Honk\nand Schutter, 2007) that underpin executive functions such as attention shifting and\ninhibition (Friedman et al., 2006). Taken together, this research provides some initial\nsupport for the notion that specific types of substance use coordinate with life history traits\nand that implicit processing may drive fast LHS (for further discussion, see Richardson and\nDespite emerging research on how substance use coordinates with life history traits,\nit is not clear to what extent specific types of substance use coordinate with the overall life\nhistory dimension that has subsumed these traits in prior research. It is also not clear how\nLife history and substance abuse\noverall liability for substance use (i.e., the tendency to use a variety of substances)\ncoordinates with life history traits or latent LHS. In this study, we fill these gaps in the\nliterature by examining the extent to which liability for substance use reflects young adult\nLHS and the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse\nResearchers have observed the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse\nand identified explanatory mechanisms such as genetic transmission, history of shared\nenvironments, and a number of family variables including dysfunctional family systems,\npoor parenting, and direct modeling (for a review, see Thornberry, Krohn, and Freeman-\nGallant, 2006). Interestingly, many of the same mechanisms that transmit high levels of\nsubstance use from parents to children have been implicated in the intergenerational\ntransmission of LHS. For example, although the adoption of faster or slower LHS is\ndevelopmentally contingent on environmental cues, studies have illuminated a genetic basis\nfor LHS and indicated that humans inherit a degree of their propensity toward a faster or\nslower strategy. In one study, Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, and Schneider (2004)\nestimated the heritability of LHS at .65. In addition, Figueredo et al. (2006) implicated\nmany of the brain regions responsible for substance abuse (i.e., the frontal cortex,\namygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and dopaminergic pathways; Goldstein and\nYucel, Lubman, Solowij, and Brewer, 2007) in the development and maintenance of LHS,\nsuggesting that perhaps substance abuse and LHS share common genetic and\nneuropsychological bases.\nIntergenerational transmission via shared environment is grounded in the\nassumption that many youths grow up in the same type of environments as their parents.\nFor instance, the literature shows strong support for the intergenerational transmission of\nsocioeconomic status (SES; Carvalho, 2012), which implies that environmental cues for\nfaster or slower life history strategies are often persistent across two generations. In the\nUnited States, for example, greater loss of health and fertility among lower SES women\ncompared with those of higher SES can cue the adoption of faster life history strategies\namong both parents and children (Geronimus 1987, 1992). Consistent with these notions,\npregnancy and high-risk sexual activity among teens have been linked to welfare\ndependence, low SES, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty (for a review, see\nFigueredo et al., 2006). There are likely reciprocal relationships between parental behavior\nand the dimensions of the environments shared by parents and children (e.g., safety and\npredictability). In part, parents may be the passive recipients of the environments they\ninhabit, while some active environmental selection and maintenance likely occurs as well.\nFinally, family variables such as dysfunctional family systems and poor parenting\nhave been identified as manifestations of faster LHS (for a review, see Figueredo et al.,\n2006). As Hill and Kaplan (1999) pointed out, there are two sets of decisions that parents\nhave to make-- one regarding individual fitness, and the other, offspring fitness. Parental\ninvestment decisions often reflect environmental risk and also provide signals that children\ncan use in the facultative development of their own life history strategies (e.g., early\ngenetic fitness, parents who invest in children in an environmentally contingent manner\nLife history and substance abuse\nwill reap benefits, as will children who can respond to parental behavior with the most\nadaptive reproductive strategy available.\nParent LHS may predict LHS in their children because (1) parents and children\nshare genes, (2) parents inhabit and maintain environments that influence LHS\ndevelopment in children, and (3) parents provide behavioral cues that bear on children's\nLHS development. In this study, we examine the possibility that liability for young adult\nsubstance use can be explained by the intergenerational transmission of LHS.\nThe Current Study\nThis study brings LHT to bear on substance use by testing whether LHS and its\nintergenerational transmission can explain substance use among young adults. The\nquestions driving this research are: (1) Among young adults, to what extent can liability for\nsubstance use be understood as a manifestation of LHS? And, (2) does the intergenerational\ntransmission of LHS from parent to child explain young adult substance use?\nMethods\nWe used National Longitudinal Survey data to test the extent to which LHS\nsubsumed young adult substance use and also whether parent LHS could predict child\nsubstance use during young adulthood through young adult children's LHS. We addressed\nour research questions by testing a structural equation model (SEM) using the one step and\nsingle or few best indicator(s) approach advocated by Leslie Hayduk and colleagues (see\nHayduk, Cummings, Boadu, Pazderka-Robinson, and Boulianne, 2007; Hayduk and\nprecision over the use of scales that include many observed variables, and adheres more\nclosely to path modeling tradition than to the factor analytic convention of using many\nindicators and multiple steps of testing (see Hayduk and Glaser, 2000; Mulaik and Millsap,\nHayduk and Litvay (2012) suggested that researchers use theory to locate the\ncorrect latent variables (i.e., construct centroids; see Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade,\n1999) and then model the single or few best indicator(s) of these variables. This approach\nallows for the specification of more complex latent structures due to decreased complexity\nat the measurement level. This is often a necessary trade-off because of sample size\nlimitations, but also because of the increasing likelihood that structural models will fit\npoorly as the number of measurement portions increases. Large models with many multi-\nitem scales will often fail due to redundancy in item wording, greater likelihood that item\ncontent will overlap the meaning of other latent variables and their reflective indicators\n(e.g., because scales have deficient discriminant validity; see McGrath, 2005), and greater\nlikelihood that the latent portions of models will be misspecified (e.g., due to omission of\nlatent variables; see Hayduk and Litvay, 2012).\nLHT provides mid-level rather than proximate explanations for coordination among\na variety of human psychological and behavioral domains. From a causal modeling\nperspective, mid-level explanations describe the behavior of variables that impact their\nobserved indicators indirectly (e.g., LHS impacts responses to items measuring neuroticism\nindirectly through latent neuroticism). If a variable directly impacts its indicators, it is their\nproximate cause, providing proximate explanation of item scores. By traditional factor\nLife history and substance abuse\nanalytic standards, studies of mid-level latent variables like LHS will require measurement\nof many domains to ensure that the latent variables of interest are located. This implies that\nmany scales, each including many items, are needed. This requirement can place a burden\non life history researchers in terms of survey length and sample size, and would seem to\nimply that they could not capitalize on nationally representative sets that may include\nscales that measure some life history domains but only one or two indicators of others.\nFortunately, simulation research has indicated that many items and higher levels of\ninternal consistency, or large factor loadings, are not required to locate construct centroids\nand recover unbiased parameter estimates when a broad selection of indicators are available\nand when confirmatory latent variable modeling is used (Little, Lindenberger, and\nNesselroade, 1999). In other words, a broad selection of indicators can provide valid\nmeasurement even when indicators are only moderately related to their constructs or reflect\nthem indirectly. This is good news for life history researchers because it suggests that\nshorter surveys and smaller samples can be sufficient when strong theory is available to\nprovide precision in indicator selection and model specification (as described in Hayduk\nand Litvay, 2012). This also suggests that nationally representative longitudinal sets such as\nNLSY97, which were not designed to test life history evolution and do not provide full\nscales that measure LHS, can still be quite valuable to life history researchers because they\nprovide indicators of a broad selection of life history domains and their large sample sizes\nfacilitate the testing of models with complex latent portions.\nSample\nThis study examined data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997\n(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2013). The NLSY97 data document the school-to-\nwork or adolescence-to-adulthood transition and are comprised of two samples: a cross-\nsectional sample representing the U.S. population born in the years 1980 through 1984, and\noversamples of the black and Hispanic population born in those years. Participants were\nindividuals were interviewed in round 1 and data for more than 84% of the initial sample\nwere available in round 13. Table 1 presents demographics for the full NLSY97 sample.\nTable 1. Participant demographics\nRace\nSex\nThe NLSY97 contains extensive information on respondent labor market behavior\nand educational experiences, along with family and community background. These data\ncan help researchers examine the longitudinal influence of schooling, environmental, and\nLife history and substance abuse\nother factors on a variety of outcomes. For a full description of the NLS97 data and the\nprocedures by which they were collected, see the NLS97 website\n(http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm).\nWe used life history theory to select 18 indicators of life history traits from the\nvariables available in the national survey. The 18 items were selected as indicators of\nTable 2). In 2009, participants were aged 22 to 26. Because attrition is often a concern with\nlongitudinal data, we conducted a missing data analysis. In this study, we used a custom set\nof survey weights in our analyses that adjusted for the survey design and also for use of\n1997 and 2009 data. We constructed these weights using the web app provided on the NLS\nwebsite (http://www.nlsinfo.org/weights/nlsy97).\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics for survey items\nYear Variable M SD\nMissing data\nIn this study, we conducted a missing data analysis because our data were\nlongitudinal and attrition was a concern. Across 18 variables, 8,984 cases were initially\navailable for analysis. We examined the variables carefully and found that 16.1% of the\ndata was missing on average, with a range from 8.0% missing for mother's age at first\ninvestigated the missing information for our 18 variables further and found substantial\nmean differences for collected information on whether or not missing data were present.\nLife history and substance abuse\nFor example, we observed that cases missing parent income data in 1997 averaged more\nsmoking in 2009 than non-missing cases. These observed mean differences suggested that\nthe missing completely at random assumption (MCAR) for listwise deletion was\ninappropriate. Therefore, we found it necessary to make the relaxed assumption of missing\nat random (MAR; Little and Rubin, 2002). We used multiple imputation to handle the\nmissing data and used 12 auxiliary variables to help satisfy the ignorable missingness\nassumption (Little and Rubin, 2002). These included self-reported data for some of our 18\nvariables that were gathered at other time points and also data for several personality traits.\nWe generated five imputed datasets using the NORM 2.03 package for Windows (Schafer,\nOur study contained several skewed variables that violated the normality\nassumption of our imputation model. While this isn't ideal in theory, the methods literature\nindicates that in the context of ordinal variables and skew, multiple imputation under a\nnormal model preserves important characteristics of the data set as a whole (e.g., variances)\nand makes use of all possible information (Enders, 2010; von Hippel, 2013). The idea is\nthat although the imputed values do not look like the observed values, the imputed variable\nbehaves like the observed variable in the analysis. One strategy that has been recommended\nfor satisfying the normality assumption of imputation models is the transformation of\nskewed variables prior to imputation. However, research suggests this actually hurts the\nimputation of variables that are linearly related because it introduces non-linearity and\nresidual non-normality (von Hippel, 2013). Although transformations help match variables'\nmarginal distributions to the imputation model's assumptions, they create problems with\nthe effects between variables and can skew residuals, which together lead to imputed values\nthat bias estimates in the analysis phase. In this study, we chose multiple imputation under\na normal model and imputed skewed variables as they were, given that this method is\nrobust to departures from normality assumptions and produces reasonably unbiased\nparameter estimates that reflect the uncertainty associated with estimating missing data\nInstruments\nWe selected indicators of parent and child LHS that have been observed to reflect a\nbroad set of domain-specific LHS components in prior research (for a review, see\nOlderbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figueredo, 2014). Following Little, Lindenberger, and\nNesselroade (1999), we expected that this broad selection would enable us to locate the\ncorrect latent LHS variable. We observed the standardized coefficients between latent\nvariables and their reflective indicators for information regarding reliability and construct\nvalidity (Bollen, 1989; Kline, 2010). Because of our focus on theoretically driven latent\nvariables and use of few indicators instead of scales, and because the assumptions of\ncoefficient alpha (see Cronbach, 1951) are unlikely to hold in practice (Bentler, 2009;\nGreen and Yang, 2009; Sijtsma, 2009), we did not report alpha in the discussions of most\nof our instruments, with one exception: We used a scale to measure neuroticism because\nwe theorized that this construct was somewhat ambiguous to participants, and we used\ncoefficient alpha to tentatively assess its reliability.\nParent LHS (1997). In this study, we planned to specify a latent variable\nrepresenting respondent parent's LHS, which manifested as household income, parental\nhealth, mother's age at first childbirth, and quality of the home environment maintained by\nLife history and substance abuse\nparents. We chose income as an indicator of LHS because although research suggests that\ndiverging life history strategies may develop as a function of childhood SES, rather than\nadult SES, higher income during adulthood can be conceptualized as investment in safe but\nlow-yield decisions (e.g., investment in education or other forms of embodied capital),\nwhich are characteristic of slower LHS (Griskevicius, Tybur, Delton, and Robertson,\n2011). This is consistent with the observation that for roughly 99% of the U.S. population,\nincome is occupation-generated (Beeghley, 2004). In addition, the correlation between\nchildhood and adult SES has been observed at r = .41 (Griskevicius et al., 2011). Thus,\ngreater childhood SES may impact the development of slower LHS and the tendency to\nengage in low-yield and safe investing, which in turn manifests as greater education and\nincome during adulthood. In this study, income was measured as household gross income\nreported by parental respondents. We divided income by 10,000 to achieve item variance\nratios that would ensure model convergence.\nWe chose parental health as an indicator of LHS because it reflects somatic effort,\nand prior research has shown that health reflects LHS indirectly through covitality\n(Olderbak et al., 2014). Parental health was measured by self-report and rated on a five-\npoint Likert scale from \"excellent\" to \"poor.\" We reverse coded this variable for conceptual\nclarity. As suggested by Olderbak et al. (2014), we used biological mother's self-reported\nage at first childbirth (i.e., the timing or delay of reproduction) as a life history parameter.\nTo measure the overall quality of the home environment maintained by parents, we used\nthe riskiness of the family home environment index created by the developers of the\nnational survey. The index is based on Caldwell and Bradley's Home Observation for\nMeasurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell and Bradley, 1984; Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2013) and combined responses to items that measured domains such as the\nquality of the youth's physical home environment, family routines in an average week, the\nextent of parental monitoring, and the quality of youth-parent relationships. These items\nmeasured domains that reflected parental investment. Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with\nhigher scores indicating greater risk. We divided riskiness of the home environment by 100\nto ensure model convergence.\nChild LHS during young adulthood (2009). This study examined manifestations of\nyoung adult LHS including neuroticism, delinquency, health, and mating effort. We chose\nto include neuroticism because prior research showed that it reflected LHS indirectly\nthrough the general factor of personality (Olderbak et al., 2014). We measured adolescent\nneuroticism using five self-report items that assessed anxiety and depression (i.e., nervous,\ncalm, down, happy, and depression). An example of item wording is, \"How much of the\ntime during the last month have you been a very nervous person?\" During young\nadulthood, the neuroticism scale had a mean of 11.55, a standard deviation of 2.42, and\nCronbach's  was observed at .79. The latter suggested that this scale's items were\ninternally consistent during young adulthood and might reflect a single dimension. We\nmeasured adolescent health as self-reported general health rated on a five-point scale from\n\"excellent\" to \"poor.\" Item wording was, \"How is your general health?\" We reverse coded\nthis item for conceptual clarity.\nAs suggested by Olderbak et al. (2014), we used respondent children's reported\nnumber of sexual partners during the past 12 months as a life history parameter. We\nspecified this variable and also respondent's reported number of persons dated in the past\n12 months as reflecting young adult mating effort. For number of sexual partners, we\nLife history and substance abuse\nneeded to use a distribution that could handle counts (e.g., negative-binomial or Poisson).\nUnfortunately, number of sexual partners exceeded the max number for counts and\ncategorical variables in MPlus 6.11 and also contained imputed values below zero. We\nconsidered transforming this variable after imputation. However, transformations appear to\nperform poorly in the context of count data, especially when dispersion is large (O'Hara\nand Kotze, 2010). We also theorized that this variable's reliability decreased as counts\nbecame more extreme and the difference between one and two sexual partners was not\nequal in meaning to the difference between, say, 15 and 16 partners. Thus, we planned to\ntreat number of sexual partners as ordinal and bucketed participants into four categories of\nmating effort, ranging from fewest to most partners, on the basis of substantive rationale\nand item distribution. The categories were as follows: none or a single partner, two\npartners, three to six partners, and more than six partners. As a result of multiple\nimputation, the number of people dated item contained some out-of-range values that fell\nbelow zero. We recoded values less than -5 into -2, values between -4 and -1 into -1, and\nthen analyzed the -1s and -2s as they were. According to Enders (2010, p. 265), this is good\npractice when the prevalence of out-of-range values is low. In this study, only 7.1% of the\nvalues were negative for the number of persons dated item. There were five categories of\nthis variable ranging from fewest to most persons dated. The categories were as follows:\nWe used young adult delinquency as an indicator of the antagonistic social\nstrategies and investment in risky but potentially high yield decisions that reflect fast LHS\n(Figueredo et al., 2006; Griskevicius et al., 2011). We measured young adult delinquency\nusing self-reported number of times participants had attacked someone, stolen items worth\nmore than 50 dollars, and committed other crimes in the last 12 months. We planned to\nspecify these items as reflecting latent delinquency and treat them as ordinal for the same\nreasons as number of sexual partners. Similar to the number of persons dated item, the\ndelinquency items contained some out-of-range values that fell below zero. Almost all of\nthese values were -2s or -1s. We recoded values less than -2 into -2 and analyzed the -1s\nand -2s as they were. No more than 7% of the values were negative across the delinquency\nvariables. There were five delinquency categories ranging from fewest to most incidences\nand they were invariant across the items. The categories were as follows: less than or equal\nLiability for young adult substance use (2009). In this study, liability for substance\nuse during young adulthood was measured with items that assessed how often the\nparticipant reported using tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana in the last 30 days. An example\nof item wording is \"How many days have you used marijuana in the last 30 days?\" We\nplanned to specify these three items as reflecting latent liability for substance use. To\nensure model convergence, we divided the substance use items by 30. Unfortunately, the\nNLSY97 does not contain detailed information on a variety of \"harder\" or uncommonly\nused illicit substances. Some items in the survey assessed use of any drugs like \"cocaine or\ncrack or heroine,\" but information about the use of each substance was not available.\nFurther, in 2009 only 3% of participants had ever used any of these hard substances, and far\nfewer participants had used these substances in the last 30 days. Due to the conflation of\nthe use of various hard substances, and because prevalence of use was so low, we did not\nexamine items regarding hard substances.\nLife history and substance abuse\nAnalyses\nThis study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to simultaneously test the\nextent to which young adult substance use reflected latent young adult LHS and also\nwhether parent LHS predicted substance use among young adult children indirectly through\nyoung adult LHS. We used the MPlus 6.11 software package to test our models, used raw\ndata as input, and used Robust Weighted Least Squares (WLSMV) as the estimator. We\nused WLSMV because we needed to treat the number of sexual partners and the\ndelinquency variables as ordinal. In addition, we used WLSMV because there was\nsubstantial skew among the young adult substance use items (i.e., skew statistics slightly\nlarger than 2). Research on the Robust Weighted Least Squared estimator has indicated that\nit yields unbiased estimates when SEM is used in the context of moderate skew (Muth\u00e9n,\ndu Toit, and Spisic, 1997). We observed that the ratio of cases to freely estimated\nparameters exceeded 100 to 1 for all hypothesized models, easily satisfying the minimum\nratio often indicated for SEM studies (Bentler and Chou, 1987). Because we analyzed very\nlarge samples that provided a great deal of statistical power, all significance tests were\nconducted at the p < .001 level. Finally, we used the split-half method to minimize Type I\nerror (i.e., pure sampling error; Pohlmann, 2004) by randomly splitting our data, testing and\nmodifying models using one half, and validating models using the other half.\nSensitivity analyses. We planned a sensitivity analysis because the NLS97 sampled\n3,855 siblings and this introduced some dependence among the data for respondent\nchildren and also the parents of multiple respondent youth. To test whether this dependence\ninfluenced our estimates, we planned to test our models using samples that included all\nrespondents with no NLS97 siblings, plus a random selection of one sibling from each\nhousehold with multiple respondent youths. If we found substantial differences between the\nresults for the full sample and this no-siblings sample, we would report on the latter.\nHypothesized model\nOur hypothesized model (see Figure 1) tested whether young adult LHS subsumed\nliability for young adult substance use. In addition, this model tested whether young adult\nLHS translated parent LHS into liability for young adult substance use. We also tested our\nhypothesized model across the sexes because prior research has documented sex\ndifferences in reproductive strategy (e.g., Mealey, 2000). For conceptual clarity, we\nchanged the valence of parent LHS so that higher scores corresponded to faster LHS and\nlower parent income, poorer parent health, earlier age at first childbirth, and greater home\nrisk. Thus, higher scores on parent and also young adult LHS implied faster LHS.\nGoodness of fit criteria\nThis study used a variety of fit indices because they provide different information\nabout model fit. We considered the substantive meaningfulness of the model, Tucker-Lewis\n(TLI) and comparative fit (CFI) indices greater than .95 (Byrne, 2001; Hu and Bentler,\n1999), and root mean square error of approximation values of less than .05 (RMSEA;\nBrowne and Cudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the data. MPlus 6.11 provides\naverage fit indices and an average 2 likelihood ratio statistic (Byrne, 2001; Kline, 2010)\nwhen multiple imputed sets are analyzed using WLSMV. In this context, the package does\nnot report a pooled likelihood ratio test.\nLife history and substance abuse\nFigure 1. Hypothesized structural model\nResults\nStructural equation modeling\nWe tested our hypothesized structural model and it appeared to be severely miss-\nspecified, observed as a non-positive definite matrix with standardized effects of latent\nvariables on reflective indicators that were greater than 1, very small effects of young adult\nfast LHS on health and neuroticism, and evidence of poor fit to the data (see Table 3).\nTable 3. Models of parent LHS, young adult LHS, and young adult substance use\nModel df 2 RMSEA CFI TLI\nModel 2: Health and neuroticism as correlates\nof young adult fast LHS\nNote. Model 3 = Model 2 + Alcohol use, smoking, and number of persons dated regressed onto parent fast\nLHS + Covariances between calm and happy items from the neuroticism measure.\nGiven the findings related to health and neuroticism, we specified a model that\nincluded these variables as correlates of young adult fast LHS instead of its indicators. We\ntested this model and it was over-identified with 126 degrees of freedom and characterized\nby a RMSEA value below .05, along with CFI and TLI values that fell well below their .95\ncutoffs. Most indices suggested this model provided inadequate fit to the data and should\nhave been rejected (see Table 3). We considered modification indices greater than 100,\nstandardized residuals greater than 2, and substantive rationale in identifying sources of\nmisspecification in the model. We modified the model by regressing smoking and alcohol\nuse on parent fast LHS. These modifications were consistent with prior research that has\nlinked SES and related variables to use of common substances after controlling for other\nlatent variables (e.g., Patrick, Wightman, Schoeni, and Shulenberg, 2012; Richardson,\nLife history and substance abuse\n2011). We also regressed number of persons dated on parent fast LHS given the possibility\nthat, in addition to reflecting young adult mating effort, number of dates might reflect\nslower LHS parents' encouragement to engage in \"official\" dating rituals that allow young\nadults to size each other up for compatibility and show that they might make good parents\nin the future. Consistent with this, research on assortative mating suggests compatibility\nand relationship satisfaction are more important in the context of slow LHS (Olderbak and\nFigueredo, 2010). Finally, we specified covariances between the calm and happy items\nsubsumed by neuroticism due to redundant item wordings.\nWe tested the modified structural model (i.e., Model 3) and it yielded a well-fitting\nsolution (see Table 3). This model was over-identified with 123 degrees of freedom and\nwas characterized by a RMSEA value well below .05, and CFI and TLI values above .95.\nConsistent with this, we found that no areas of substantial strain remained for the modified\nstructural model. To minimize Type I error, we cross-validated Model 3 using the other\nhalf of our data and by testing it across males and females. All fit indices suggested that the\nmodel fit the second half of the data, the male data, and the female data very well (see\nTable 3). Model 3 sex differences are described below.\nIn addition to interpreting the model fit indices, we interpreted the substance of the\nmodel's statistically significant parameter estimates (ps < .001; see Figure 2 and Tables 4\nand 5). First, we observed the effects of the theorized latent variables on their reflective\nindicators. Parent fast LHS had moderate to large effects on its indicators, with s ranging\nfrom .39 to .53 in absolute value. Young adult neuroticism had large effects on its reflective\nindicators, with s ranging from .59 to .73 in absolute value. The effects of liability for\nyoung adult substance use on its indicators were moderate to large in size, with s ranging\nfrom .39 to .52. Young adult mating effort had moderate to large effects on its indicators,\nwhich were number of partners dated ( = .36) and number of sexual partners ( = .67).\nYoung adult delinquency had moderate to large effects on its indicators, with s ranging\nfrom .31 to .42. In Model 3, the first-order latent variables, young adult mating effort,\ndelinquency, and substance use reflected the second-order latent variable--young adult fast\nLHS. Young adult fast LHS had a large positive effect on substance use ( = .78) and\nmoderate positive effects on mating effort ( = .44) and delinquency ( = .42). The\nobserved parameters suggested that the reflective indicators provided broad, reasonably\nreliable, and valid measurement of their respective constructs.\nNext, we observed and interpreted the model's structural regression coefficients.\nWe found that standardized effects were small in size, with s ranging from .13 to .31 in\nabsolute value. We found that parent fast LHS had small positive effects on young adult\nsmoking and neuroticism, small negative effects on number of persons dated and alcohol\nuse, and a moderate negative effect on health. Parent fast LHS did not have any significant\ndirect or indirect effects on young adult fast LHS or liability for substance use. A small\npositive correlation was observed between young adult fast LHS and neuroticism, while\nsmall negative correlations were observed between fast LHS and adolescent health and\nbetween health and neuroticism. In light of parsimony, the substance of the parameter\nestimates, and the observed indices of fit, we accepted Model 3 as the best representation of\nthe relationships between the variables.\nLife history and substance abuse\nFigure 2.

Covariances and correlations, model 3\ncov SE p r\nSex differences. We tested our final model across males and females and the fit to\neach group's data was excellent (see Table 3). No effects varied by sex in terms of\nstatistical significance, and we observed that only one effect of a latent variable on its\nLife history and substance abuse\nreflective indicator appeared to vary substantially by sex. The effect of young adult mating\neffort on number of sexual partners was observed at  = .75 for males and .59 for females.\nWe also observed that only one structural regression coefficient appeared to vary across the\nsexes. The effect of parent fast LHS on young adult neuroticism was observed at  = .18 for\nfemales and .06 for males. We explore these sex differences further in the discussion.\nSensitivity analyses. We tested Model 3 against our no-siblings sample to assess\nwhether dependence among the siblings in NLS97 influenced its estimates. Model fit was\nvery similar between the samples with and without siblings (for the latter, 2 = 381.11; CFI\n= .96; TLI = .95; and RMSEA = .03). Only one effect differed in its level of statistical\nsignificance: For the effect of parent fast LHS on young adult neuroticism, p < .001 for the\nsiblings sample and p = .01 for the no-siblings sample, although its magnitude did not\nappear to vary substantially. We tested the model across the male and female samples with\nand without siblings and observed no apparent differences. Given the single observed\ndifference for Model 3, we reported on the full sample.\nDiscussion\nThis study tested whether LHS and its intergenerational transmission could explain\nsubstance use among young adults. Before tying our results back to our primary research\nquestions, we wish to address the finding that not all of our indicators of young adult LHS\nreflected a life history dimension. In particular, health and neuroticism did not reflect the\nlatent fast LHS variable that subsumed mating effort, delinquency, and liability for\nsubstance use. Brumbach et al. (2009) reported similar findings in a study of adolescent and\nyoung adult LHS that also analyzed longitudinal and nationally representative data. During\nyoung adulthood, Brumbach et al. (2009) found that social deviance, which subsumed\ndelinquency, impulsivity, Machiavellianism, and alcohol use, did not reflect a latent life\nhistory variable that subsumed variables such as health and education. The authors\nsuggested that perhaps life history traits begin to reflect a single dimension during middle\nadulthood. As another possibility, a multi-dimensional structure might subsume life history\ntraits across the lifespan. This would be consistent with the externalizing and internalizing\ndimensions that have emerged from personality traits and behaviors in research on\npathological and normal personality (e.g., Krueger, 2003; Krueger, Markon, Patrick,\nBenning, and Kramer, 2007; Krueger, McGue, and Iacono, 2001; Markon, Krueger, and\nWatson, 2005). Along this line, it is interesting to note that although low levels on the slow\nlife history factors (or K-factors) that emerged in prior research may correspond to higher\nlevels of neuroticism (i.e., anxiety and depression) and lower levels of health, altruism,\nconscientiousness, parental investment, and earning potential (Figueredo, Vasquez,\nBrumbach, and Sneider, 2007), they do not necessarily imply greater mating effort\n(Gladden, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2008; but see Figueredo et al., 2005). For instance,\nseveral studies have reported that slow LHS did not subsume mating effort, which was\ninstead subsumed by latent variables named psychopathy or psychopathic and aggressive\nattitudes (Figueredo, Gladden, and Hohman, 2012; Gladden, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2008;\nOlderbak et al., 2014), a construct that has often reflected an externalizing dimension that is\ndistinct from the internalizing dimension that subsumes anxiety and depression (e.g.,\nKrueger et al., 2007). Taken together, the studies discussed above suggest that mating\neffort and its functional correlates (e.g., dominance seeking, aggression, and risk-taking;\nLife history and substance abuse\nTrivers, 1971) may vary uniquely from the slow life history dimension that subsumes\ntiming of reproduction, somatic effort, and parenting effort. In this study, perhaps young\nadult fast LHS could be better defined as young adult mating competition.\nThere are several reasons why mating competition might be independent of slow\nLHS in large human (i.e., within species) samples. Van Noordwijk and de Jong (1986)\ndescribe a model in which T (total amount of resources available to an individual) = R\n(investment in reproduction) + S (investment in somatic growth or survival). The\nimplication is that, given lots of within-population variation in T, a positive correlation\nbetween R and S might be observed. In other words, with access to more resources,\norganisms have the potential to invest more in mating effort as well as somatic effort. So it\nis possible, in principle, that studies of human LHS could be plagued by suppression effects\nif they fail to control for resource availability. In our study, we controlled for parental\nincome, so this seems to be an unlikely problem. However, perhaps parental income is not\na good indicator of resource availability during this period because parents control their\nresources and young adult have not yet accumulated significant embodied capital of their\nown. However, this would suggest that variation in income may be restricted in range\nduring this period, which should imply that a suppression effect is more unlikely.\nSibly and Brown (2007) note that variation in metabolic efficiency could have an\neffect similar to resource access. We did not have any measure of this parameter, so it is\npossible that this omission suppressed the trade-off between mating competition and slow\nLHS. That is, this trade-off might manifest among people characterized by the same level\nof metabolic efficiency, but not in the U.S. population at large. Perhaps good genes have a\nsimilar effect, with high mate value individuals able to invest more in mating competition\nand also slow LHS.\nexplanation for the independence between mating competition and slow LHS. The authors\ndemonstrated that holding body size constant, species' locations on the slow-fast life\nhistory continuum were functions of two \"lifestyle\" components, including diet and\nmortality. Greater access to energetic resources corresponded to faster strategies, whereas\ndecreased mortality corresponded to slower strategies. Extrapolating to within-species\ntheorizing, it seems possible that independent mating competition and slow LHS systems\ncould have evolved among humans if mortality and access to resources varied with relative\nindependence. Complicating this picture for researchers, however, is the fact that modern\nhumans accumulate extra-somatic wealth that can be invested in warding off death and in\nmating competition.\nFinally, there are plenty of ways that modern Western societies differ from the\nhunter-gatherer ecologies to which humans are generally adapted (Hill and Kaplan, 1999).\nPerhaps the significant extra-somatic capital that modern humans accumulate decouples\nmating competition from slow LHS. Whatever the case, it is clear that more research is\nneeded to confirm the dimensionality of young and middle adult life history traits and also\nidentify how differences between Pleistocene and modern environments bear on human\nLHS. Such research is especially salient given a recent critique of psychological measures\nof LHS that have stemmed from Differential K theory (see Copping, Campbell, and\nMuncer, 2014). The authors suggest that better validation of such measures is needed,\nincluding linkage to life history parameters such as the timing of puberty and reproduction\nas well as number of sexual partners.\nLife history and substance abuse\nOur results indicated that young adult fast LHS explained 61% of the variance in\nyoung adult liability for substance use (see Table 4). In contrast, health and neuroticism\nwere minimally and only indirectly related to substance use through young adult fast LHS.\nPerhaps poor health and neuroticism don't become important correlates of substance use\nuntil middle adulthood. This would be consistent with substance use typologies such as\nCloninger's categorization of alcoholics into Types 1 (associated with anxiety proneness\nand loss of control over alcohol intake after age 25) and 2 (associated with impulsivity and\nantisocial behavior before age 25; Cloninger, Sigvardsson, and Bohman, 1996). Our model\nsuggests that fast LHS is the primary driver of substance use during young adulthood.\nHowever, given our discussion of the dimensionality of life history traits, it might be better\nto conclude that mating competition subsumes most of the variance in young adult\nsubstance use. Future research could shed light on this issue by modeling additional\nindicators of substance use, mating competition, and also timing of reproduction, somatic\neffort, and potential parental effort among young adults.\nParent fast LHS did not predict fast LHS or overall liability for substance use\namong young adults. The absence of a direct effect of parent fast LHS on young adult fast\nLHS was very surprising. Stemming from our discussion of the dimensionality of life\nhistory traits, one potential explanation for this finding is that LHS is transmitted along two\ndimensions--slow LHS (i.e., delayed reproduction coupled with somatic and parental\neffort) and mating competition. Perhaps this study, despite our best efforts to use\ntheoretical precision in indicator selection, located the slow dimension among parents while\nlocating the mating competition dimension among young adults. Slow LHS among parents\nmay predict slow traits but not mating competition among children, whereas mating\ncompetition among parents predicts mating competition but not slow life history traits\namong children. We had access to good indicators of parent slow LHS, including timing of\nreproduction and somatic and parental effort. Perhaps this variable would not also subsume\nparent mating competition. More research is needed to address this possibility, and\nadditional theoretical work is required to determine whether this empirically derived\nproposal can be reconciled with life history theory or is biologically plausible.\nTwo additional potential explanations of the finding discussed above are (1) that the\neffect of parent fast LHS on young adult liability for substance use, through young adult\nfast LHS, was nil because of the lengthy 12-year lag between the measurement of parent\nand child variables, and (2) that unique features of the environments young adults typically\ninhabit in Western societies moderated the effect between parent and child LHS. Regarding\n(2), perhaps young adult fast LHS is relatively uncoordinated with parent fast LHS because\nduring this period children often leave their home environments, inhabit novel young adult\ndominated ecologies (e.g., college), and are integrating themselves into new social groups.\nDuring young adulthood, reproductive strategies among children may not have canalized\nmuch and may not yet reflect their parents' strategies. As young adults find ecological\nniches for themselves and their social statuses and attachments stabilize, perhaps their life\nhistory strategies begin to bear greater resemblance to the strategies maintained by parents.\nIn other words, the observed independence of parent slow LHS and young adult mating\ncompetition dimensions may be an artifact of modern Western environments. The study of\n\"emerging adulthood\" reflects the many unique features and experiences of this population.\nTo address these possibilities, future research could test whether adolescent LHS links\nparent LHS to young adult substance use.\nLife history and substance abuse\nParent fast LHS did have direct effects on the use of specific substances. In particular,\nparent fast LHS had small negative effects on young adult alcohol use and small positive\neffects on young adult smoking. These findings are consistent with research indicating that\nSES, which includes income, predicts greater alcohol use and lesser tobacco smoking\namong young adults in the US (e.g., Patrick et al., 2012). Perhaps LHS explains this\nfinding. Parent fast LHS also had a significant positive effect on young adult neuroticism\nand a moderate negative effect on young adult health. These effects of parent LHS on child\nhealth and neuroticism were persistent across a twelve year lag (i.e., from 1997 to 2009)\nand are consistent with findings that slow life history dimensions are heritable and subsume\ncovitality (i.e., mental and physical health; see Figueredo et al., 2004, 2006). These effects\nare also consistent with the literature on family environment and family functioning that we\ndiscussed in LHS and the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse. After\ncontrolling for young adult fast LHS, parent fast LHS predicted fewer persons dated during\nyoung adulthood. As suggested, this may reflect a greater tendency of slower LHS parents\nto encourage children to go out on \"official\" dates where food and recreation are\npurchased.\nDuring this study, we observed few sex differences in the structure of life history\ntraits. However, young adult fast LHS did appear to have a smaller effect on number of sex\npartners for females than males. This suggests a very interesting avenue for future research.\nAmong young adult females, perhaps mating effort is thwarted by childbirths, which\nimpose less of a burden on males employing a fast LHS. The positive effect between parent\nfast LHS and young adult neuroticism was larger for females, suggesting faster parent\nstrategies may exacerbate anxiety and depression in females to a greater extent than in\nmales. Further research could examine family structure as a moderator of this effect.\nFinally, it is important to note that we have reported on structural sex differences only.\nMean differences on the constructs we studied likely exist as well (for discussion, see\nMealey, 2000), but our primary interest in this study was elucidation of structure.\nRichardson and Hardesty (2012) suggested that life history theory (LHT) provides a\npowerful explanatory tool that can provide new insights into the etiology of substance\nabuse and also help identify novel targets for prevention and treatment interventions.\nIndeed, this study indicates that fast LHS or mating competition explained most of the\nvariance in liability for young adult substance use. Scholars such as Howard Schaffer\n(2012) have recently argued that substance abuse is underpinned by an addiction syndrome,\nof which heightened substance use is just one manifestation. The current study provides\nsome support for this view. Additional research that simultaneously estimates the linkages\nbetween substance use and life history indicators is sorely needed. Such work could help to\nclarify the relationship between slow LHS and mating competition, along with the extent to\nwhich substance use is a byproduct of these dimensions.\nImplications for clinicians and prevention specialists\nMental health model interventions have a long history of targeting parental\nstructuring of the home environment, parental income, and other parent life history traits in\nefforts to improve the mental health and adjustment of children. This study suggests that\nsuch interventions may not have effects on fast LHS (or mating competition) or liability for\nsubstance use that persists into young adulthood. Two exceptions seem to be alcohol use\nand smoking behavior. Controlling for young adult fast LHS, parent fast LHS predicted\nLife history and substance abuse\nhigher levels of smoking into young adulthood, while predicting lesser alcohol use. Perhaps\nfuture research will bear out the notion that a focus on mating competition dimensions\namong parents would be more useful in treatments. If so, this might imply that\ninterventions could focus on cuing decreases in mating competition and externalizing\nbehaviors instead of focusing primarily on increasing slow LHS or mental health.\nPerhaps the most important practical implication of the current research is that\nsubstance use should be considered in a broader ecological context. For clinicians and\npreventionists, adopting an ecological view of substance use will mean attempting to\nimpact dimensions of LHS to indirectly influence a variety of outcomes such as substance\nuse. As the mental health professions move toward a greater focus on comorbidity, we\nbelieve LHT can provide a guiding framework for understanding why certain disorders co-\noccur. From a life history perspective, many psychiatric disorders may co-occur as\nmanifestations of reproductive strategies adapted to particular environmental conditions.\nUltimately, evolutionarily informed research and practice may move the field toward a\nbroader and less pathologizing view of mental disorders.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations complicate our inferences from this study's results. This study is\nlimited by the use of self-report data. Error can be introduced in the retrieval processes\nassociated with memory, and self-presentation bias can sometimes influence results. In\nspite of their limitations, self-report data are economical and robust enough that their use is\nvery common. In this study, the error introduced by memory and self-presentation bias is\nnoted but not thought to be substantially systematic. Causal inferences based on this study's\nresults must remain tentative. As we note in our discussion of the intergenerational\ntransmission of LHS and substance use, parent LHS cannot be understood as completely\nexogenous to child life history traits due to genetic inheritance (i.e., LHS appears to be\nheritable; Figueredo et al., 2004). Genes represent unmeasured variables that could cause\nparent LHS and child life history traits. Future research can use genetic information to\naddress this potential confound.\nAnother limitation of this research is related to NLS97. The national survey was not\ndesigned to test life history evolution. Because of this, we were not able to measure\nfundamental dimensions of environment such as harshness and unpredictability (Ellis et al.,\n2009). We did have access to an index of the quality of the home environment parents\nmaintained for children, but more extensive environmental measures would have added\nimportant information to this study. We also relied on single indicators of several life\nhistory domains. We expected that the use of a broad set of life history indicators would\nallow us to locate the LHS construct centroids and recover the correct between-construct\nparameter estimates (Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade, 1999). However, because a\nsingle dimension did not emerge from our life history indicators, we relied on a single\nindicator of health and did not partial out measurement error variance for this variable.\nBecause the assumption of zero error is often untenable, the estimates associated with\nhealth should be interpreted with some caution. In this study, an adequate measure of the\nuse of uncommon illicit substances was not available. Although this study suggests that fast\nLHS (or mating competition) is the primary driver of young adult substance use, it might be\nthe case that this latent variable does not predict the use of uncommon illicit substances to\nthe same extent that it predicts use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Future studies of the\nLife history and substance abuse\nlinkages between LHS dimensions and substance use should examine data for the use of\nother illicit substances. For now, inferences regarding uncommonly used illicit substances\nshould remain tentative.\nFinally, our findings cast some uncertainty upon the identity of the latent constructs\nwe modeled. The pattern of results seems to suggest that substance use reflected young\nadult mating competition and not where parents fell along a slow life history dimension\n(i.e., delayed reproduction coupled with somatic and parental effort). However, these\nfindings must be interpreted with caution until additional research can bring more data to\nbear on the dimensionality of life history traits and the potential mediating role of LHS in\nthe intergenerational transmission of substance use.\nIn spite of the limitations discussed, we believe this research has made important\ncontributions to the literature at the interface of human LHS and substance abuse etiology,\nincluding some interesting questions and important directions for future research. In\naddition, this work provides information that could be valuable to clinicians and\npreventionists who intervene on substance abuse. Some major strengths of this study lie in\nits careful use of these complex survey data, including the incorporation of complex\nsampling weights, implementation of modern methods for handling missing data, and use\nof sensitivity analyses at key methodological decision points. We hope that other life\nhistory researchers will take advantage of existing nationally representative sets and that\nthis study spurs additional work at the interface of life history theory and substance use\netiology.\nReferences\nBeeghley, L.
