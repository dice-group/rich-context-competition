The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), recognizing both the importance of water disinfection for public health protection and\npotential risks associated with THM exposure, developed disinfection byproduct rules with the parallel goals of ensuring safe drinking water and limiting\nthe levels of THMs in public water systems. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) THM blood data can be used as a\nmeans for assessing US population exposures to THMs; biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) can provide human health risk-based context to those data.\nIn this paper, we examine the blood THM levels in the 1999\u00ad2004 NHANES data to (i) determine weighted population percentiles of blood THMs,\n(ii) explore whether gender and/or age are associated with blood THM levels, (iii) determine whether temporal trends can be discerned over the 6-year\ntimeframe, and (iv) draw comparisons between population THM blood levels and BEs. A statistically significant decrease in blood chloroform levels was\nobserved across the 1999\u00ad2004 time period. Age-related differences in blood chloroform levels were not consistent and no gender-related differences in\nblood chloroform levels were observed. The concentrations of all four THMs in the blood of US residents from the 2003 to 2004 NHANES dataset are\nbelow BEs consistent with the current US EPA reference doses. For bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, the measured median blood\nconcentrations in the United States are within the BEs for the 10\u00c06 and 10\u00c04 cancer risk range, whereas measured values for bromoform generally fall\nbelow the 10\u00c06 cancer risk range. These assessments indicate that general population blood concentrations of THMs are in a range considered to be a low\nto medium priority for risk assessment follow-up, according to the guidelines for interpretation of biomonitoring data using BEs.\nKeywords: THMs, blood, chloroform, biomonitoring equivalent, DBPs, NHANES.\nIntroduction\nTrihalomethanes (THMs, including chloroform, bromodi-\nchloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform)\nare short-lived chemicals to which there is widespread human\nexposure. THMs are produced when chlorine-based chemi-\ncals are used to disinfect public drinking water; the goal of\ndisinfection is to protect human health by reducing human\nexposure to disease-causing pathogens. However, toxico-\nlogical studies have demonstrated the potential for adverse\nhealth effects from THM exposure at elevated levels,\nincluding toxicity to the liver and kidneys and carcinogenicity\naddition, epidemiological studies have suggested potential\nassociations between exposure to THMs and adverse\nreproductive outcomes (Bove et al., 2002; Windham et al.,\nProtection Agency (USEPA), recognizing both the impor-\ntance of water disinfection for public health protection and\nthe potential risks associated with THM exposure, developed\nthe parallel goals of ensuring safe drinking water and limiting\nthe levels of THMs in public water systems.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nhas released nationally representative data on blood levels of\nTHMs in the United States, collected during three sampling\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nused as part of a population-based exposure assessment.\nHowever, limited tools are available for linking the\nbiomonitoring exposure data to human health risk.\n1. Address all correspondence to: Dr. Judy S. LaKind, LaKind\nwww.nature.com/jes\nVarious approaches have been used to attempt to interpret\nthe NHANES biomonitoring data in terms of human health.\nOne approach involves deriving correlations between the\nbiomonitoring levels and health effects from epidemiological\nstudies. These efforts have difficulty reconciling the transient\nand variable nature of the short-lived biomarkers with\nchronic effects/diseases (LaKind et al., 2008). Another\napproach involves estimating the plausible distribution of\ndoses that would yield the resulting distribution of biomo-\nnitoring data. The estimated doses can then be compared\nwith established exposure guidance values derived by\nregulatory agencies, like the reference dose (RfD) established\napproach is complex, especially for compounds with short\nhalf-lives, multiple routes of exposure, and intermittent\nexposure patterns, and the inherent uncertainties of the\nreverse dosimetry approach for short-lived compounds have\nThe concept of biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) was\nintroduced to provide a method for conducting a screening-\nlevel human health risk evaluation of biomonitoring data\n(Hays et al., 2007). BEs, developed to serve as an interpretive\nand risk management tool, are concentrations or ranges of\nconcentrations of a chemical in a biological medium such as\nblood or urine consistent with existing health-based exposure\net al., 2008). BEs are screening tools for assessing whether\nbiomonitoring data indicate a large, small, or no margin of\nsafety compared with existing health-based exposure guide-\nlines. In general, BEs are derived from chemical-specific\nhuman or animal pharmacokinetic data in a manner that\nreconstructs the risk assessment's underlying exposure\nguidance values (e.g. RfDs, reference concentrations) on an\ninternal dose basis. Detailed guidelines for the derivation and\ncommunication of BEs are available (Hays et al., 2008;\nLaKind et al., 2008) and BEs have been developed for\nIn this paper, we examine the blood THM levels in the\npopulation percentiles of blood THMs for each sampling\nperiod, (ii) explore whether gender and/or age are associated\nwith blood THM levels, (iii) determine whether temporal\ntrends can be discerned over the 6-year timeframe, and (iv)\ndraw comparisons between population THM blood levels\nand health-based BEs for individual compounds as well as\nmixtures.\nMethods\nAnalysis of NHANES Blood Data\nTHM levels in blood were measured using solid-phase\nmicroextraction coupled with gas chromatography and\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Bonin et al., 2005).\nThese blood THM data are available for the time periods\nperiods, percentiles for the sampled population were\ncomputed using weights given by CDC (CDC, 2006). For\nweighted quantiles, an R package called Hmisc that contains\na weighted quantile function was used (Harrell et al., 2008; R\nDevelopment Core Team, 2008). Confidence intervals for\nquantiles were calculated using a weighted bootstrap method\ndescribed by Chamberlain and Imbens (2003). For examina-\ntion of percentage non-detects for each of the sampling\nperiods, unweighted data were used. Data on individuals\naged 20\u00ad59 years were given by CDC, and percentiles for the\ndifferent age groups within the population were estimated.\nTemporal trends for the three timeframes were assessed. The\nhypothesis test used is based on finding the largest value of a\nsuch that simultaneous confidence intervals with coverage\nprobability 1-a (based on asymptotic normal approximation\nto the distribution of the median estimates) for the 3 year's\nmedians fail to overlap. Measurements below the limit of\ndetection (LOD) were assigned a value of the LOD/\nffiffiffi\np\n. In\ngeneral, detection limits ranged from 0.2 to 2.4 pg/ml for all\nthree sampling periods. Throughout this paper, the units\nfor blood THMs are pg/ml, or parts per trillion (ppt). A\nsmall number of participants within each sampling period\nhad levels of THMs that were above the calibration range\nbromoform at 310 pg/ml). These values were included in\nthe analyses.\nDevelopment of BEs for THMs\nDetailed information on the method for deriving BEs for\nTHMs is given in Aylward et al. (2008). The BE derivation is\nbased on reproducing the existing cancer and non-cancer risk\nassessments on an internal dose basis to derive estimates of\naverage blood concentrations consistent with external dose\nbenchmarks for cancer (risk-specific doses corresponding to\npoint of departure and RfD). Each BE is derived through\nconsideration of the toxicological data underlying the\nrespective exposure guidance value, understanding of the\npharmacokinetics of THMs in humans, and application of\nappropriate uncertainty factor components to the toxico-\nlogical point of departure. The BEs can be used as screening\ntools to identify whether the measured population concen-\ntrations are in the region of low, medium, or high priority for\nrisk assessment follow-up (Hays et al., 2008; LaKind et al.,\n2008). In accordance with the BE derivation and commu-\nbiomarker concentrations below the BERfD\n(biomarker\nInterpretation of THM blood levels in the U.S.\nLaKind et al.\nconcentration consistent with the RfD) indicate ``low\npriority'' for risk assessment follow-up, whereas concentra-\ntions in excess of the BERfD\nbut below the BEPOD\n(biomarker\nconcentration consistent with the human-equivalent point of\ndeparture) indicate medium priority, and those in excess of\nindicate high priority for risk assessment follow-\nup. For cancer endpoints, the corresponding regions of\npriority are delineated by the BEs associated with the 10\u00c06\nand 10\u00c04 risk levels. The BEs for the four THMs based on\nthe currently available exposure guidance values are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. If alternative risk assessments based on\ndifferent underlying toxicological or epidemiological data are\nconducted, different evaluations of BE values would be\nrequired. Details regarding the assumptions and approaches\nused in their derivation, as well as detailed discussion\nregarding their limitations and appropriate uses, are pre-\nEvaluation of THM Mixtures in Blood\nMultiple THMs tend to be formed during water disinfection\nand likely lead to simultaneous exposure to more than one\nTHM. Therefore, a mixtures risk assessment approach is\nneeded. Regulation of THMs in drinking water is based on a\nsum of the concentrations of the four compounds; however,\nthe differing toxicological potencies among the four com-\npounds necessitates understanding which compounds\ncontribute to the mixture of THMs in blood. One approach\nused for mixtures risk assessment in environmental settings\nfor non-cancer endpoints is the hazard index (HI) approach.\nBriefly, the ratio of the measured dose of each compound\nin a mixture to the chemical-specific reference value (RfD, for\nexample) is calculated, and these hazard quotients are\nsummed to obtain an HI for the suite of chemicals\nconsidered. The current mixtures risk assessment paradigm\nimplies no excess risks when the HI is below 1. Such\nan approach is most defensible when the chemicals of interest\nhave similar modes of action and target organ toxicities\n(USEPA, 2007), and when non-additive interactions\namong the chemicals of interest are neither known nor\nsuspected.\nThe BEs present an opportunity to attempt a similar\napproach to the mixtures biomonitoring data available\nin the NHANES data.

For this\nreason, we focused on chloroform in our analyses of age- and\ngender-related trends. Age-related differences in blood\nchloroform levels were not consistent. For example, median\nlevels generally decreased with increasing age group for\nin levels between youngest and oldest age groups in the\nferences in blood chloroform levels for any of the time periods.\nThe derivation of BE values is one effort to provide\ncontext and information useful for interpretation of\nTable 3.

The non-cancer\nmixture assessment for the four THM compounds using the\nadditive HI approach for each individual resulted in HIs\nbelow 1 at the median and 95th percentile of the population\n(HIs of 0.2 and 0.8, respectively) based on the NHANES\nEPA guidance values, general population blood concentra-\ntions of THMs are in a range that would be considered to be\na low to medium priority for risk assessment follow-up.\nThe statistical evaluation of biomonitoring data from\nNHANES and the comparison of these data to BEs for the\nTHMs presented here must be considered in the context of\nthe characteristics of THM compounds. THMs are volatile\nand are rapidly metabolized and eliminated from blood after\nexposure. Exposures to THMs in water can occur from\nconsumption of water but also after inhalation or dermal\nexposure during use of water for showering, cooking,\ndishwashing, and other activities (Ashley et al., 2005). Such\nexposures can result in rapid increases in blood concentration\nfollowed by rapid declines (Ashley et al., 2005). Thus,\nmeasurement of THM concentrations in blood at any given\ntime does not provide information for an individual\nregarding either long-term or peak exposure levels. However,\nthe cross-sectional nature of the NHANES study does\nprovide a broad overview of the range of values likely to be\nencountered in the general US population on a typical\nongoing basis.\nThe BEs used here to provide a screening level evaluation\nof the NHANES data are based on time-weighted average\n(not peak) daily blood concentrations consistent with the\ncurrent RfDs and cancer risk-specific values for the various\ncompounds (changes in those reference values would\nnecessitate reconsideration of the BEs). These BEs and their\nunderlying reference values are based on an assumption of\nongoing, lifetime exposures, and interpretation of cross-\nsectional data (whether biomonitoring data or data on\nconcentrations in drinking water) must always be made with\nthis limitation in mind. In comparison, someone experiencing\na single, bolus, once per day exposure equivalent to an RfD\ncould experience a peak blood concentration of chloroform\napproximately five times the 24-h theoretical average blood\nconcentration at that same exposure, which is the concentra-\ntion reported as the BE. Thus, comparison of the cross-\nsectional data with these BEs based on the lifetime exposure\nassumption must be made cautiously, given both the inherent\nwithin-day variability as well as the potential for variation\nover longer time frames for these types of data. Comparison\nof the NHANES data to the BEs provide a rational basis for\na screening-level assessment of the public health risks\nindicated by these data, but results at the upper or lower\ntails of the NHANES dataset distributions (which may\nrepresent transient peak or minimum blood concentrations,\nrespectively) should be interpreted in comparison with the\nBEs only with a great deal of caution.\nThe analytical sensitivity achieved in the NHANES\nTHM compounds in the majority of sampled individuals,\nand so avoids the limitations of the earlier NHANES III\net al., 1994). However, given the highly transient nature of\nthese compounds, public health interpretation of ongoing\nexposures would be enhanced by the development of\nbiomarkers of THM exposures that have longer half-lives.\nSuch biomarkers might include urinary metabolites (if stable\nand selective markers could be discovered) or protein adducts\nresulting from the reaction of the THM compounds or their\nmetabolites with proteins in blood. Biomarkers that represent\nmore of an integrative measure of exposure would reduce\nsome of the issues with interpreting the tails of the current\nTHM in blood biomarkers.\nThe NHANES study design is a complex, multistage,\nprobability sample designed to represent the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population and, as such, is not designed to\nnecessarily capture individuals who may be occupationally\nexposed (e.g. people who work in recreational facilities with\nBDCM, pg/ml blood\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\nIncreasing priority for risk\nassessment follow-up\nFigure 1.

The measured blood bromodi-\nchloromethane concentrations fall within this range, indicating a\n``medium'' priority for risk assessment follow-up in the framework\nestablished in the BE guidelines for communication (LaKind et al.,\nInterpretation of THM blood levels in the U.S.\nLaKind et al.\nswimming pools or in water treatment facilities) or special\npopulations such as frequent or competitive swimmers. Thus,\nconclusions drawn from examination of the NHANES blood\nconcentration data are limited to members of the typical\ngeneral population and may not apply to these special\npopulation groups. Furthermore, studies that attempt to\nmeasure potential peak levels of THMs in blood of\nindividuals experiencing temporary and intermittent activities\nthat might be associated with high THM exposures (taking a\nshower and/or swimming in a chlorinated swimming pool)\nshould not be interpreted using the BERfD\nas these BEs are\ndesigned to be associated with interpreting steady-state life-\ntime average blood levels of THMs. Rather, the biomonitor-\ning levels associated with these types of intermittent and\ntemporary elevated exposures may be more appropriate to\ninterpret using a BE associated with an acute exposure\nguidance value such as the acute duration minimal risk level\nset by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\nSuch BEs would likely be several fold higher than the BEs\nbased on lifetime chronic RfD values.\nThe mixture evaluation presented here is drawn from\nmethods used in risk assessments for situations involving\nexposure to multiple compounds. In the case of THM\ncompounds, the similarities in non-cancer response endpoints\nacross compounds (liver toxicity) supports, at least in theory,\nconsideration of the mixture using an HI approach, and\nincorporates an assumption that the exposure levels encoun-\ntered in the general population are not likely to approach\nlevels in which metabolic interactions and inhibition would\noccur (Haddad et al., 2006). We recognize that this approach\nhas not been validated for assessments based on biomonitor-\ning data, but present this analysis as a potential application of\nan existing risk assessment approach. Other approaches to\nmixtures can be contemplated, and the BEs may be useful in\nthose approaches as well.\nConflict of interest\nDr LaKind, Mr. Hays and Ms. Aylward received support\nfor this research from the American Chemistry Council\n(ACC).
