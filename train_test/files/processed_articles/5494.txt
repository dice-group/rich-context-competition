In this article, we\ndiscuss the experiences of students returning to a university campus after long-term addiction treatment. We also explore\nthe role of a Collegiate Recovery Program (CRP) in providing support, and in helping the students develop post-addiction\nidentities that will sustain them. To do so, we draw on Goffman's ideas related to stigma, as well as conceptualizations of\nidentity reconstruction as a practiced, lived experience. Students interviewed faced a double bind; they sought to escape the\nstigmatized identity of \"addict,\" but could not identify as typical students because of their abstinence from alcohol and drugs.\nThe CRP helped them manage the transition to student life, provided a safe haven on campus, and provided an alternate and\npositive identity: a student in recovery.\n",

The 2012\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health found that close to\nsubstance abuse or dependence in the past year; 6.1% of 12-\nto 17-year-olds met this criteria (SubstanceAbuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2013). Rates of\nseeking and receiving treatment are still lower than desirable\n(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2013),\nstance abuse treatment in 2012, roughly half of treatment\noccurring within specialty facilities (SAMHSA, 2013).\nWithin this group, a significant proportion will receive treat-\nment and enter active recovery before or during postsecond-\nary education.As a result, though exact numbers are unknown,\na significant number of students are navigating their college\nyears in recovery from alcohol or drug addiction (Terrion,\nStudents in recovery arrive on college campuses that are\noften \"flooded with alcohol and drugs\" and peers who use\nthem, significant risk factors for relapse (Finch & Karakos,\nfound that 68% of college students reported alcohol use in\nthe last month, and 37% reported using illicit drugs in the\npast year (National Center on Addiction and Substance\nAbuse [CASA], 2007). In response to this challenge,\nCollegiate Recovery Programs (CRPs) have evolved to pro-\nvide campus-based support services to college students in\nrecovery. The first CRP was established at Brown University\nrecovery high schools now offer some level of recovery sup-\nport (Finch & Karakos, 2014). Roughly, two to five new CRP\nprograms emerge each year (Laudet & Humphreys, 2013).\nCRPs currently vary in the services they offer, but a compre-\nhensive CRP incorporates a range of educational, peer, com-\nmunity, and family supports, utilizing a systems-based model\nfor recovery (Harris, Baker, Kimball, & Shumway, 2008).\nExample resources include 12-step support groups, counsel-\ning services, academic advising, service opportunities, and\n1The College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA\n2Shelby County Health Department, Memphis, TN, USA\n3Recovery Communities of North Carolina, Raleigh, NC, USA\n4Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAlison Scott, Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences, The College\nEmail: ascott01@wm.edu\nExperiences of Students in Recovery\non a Rural College Campus: Social\nIdentity and Stigma\nAlison Scott1, Ashton Anderson2, Kristen Harper3,\nand Moya L. Alfonso4\n Keywords\nqualitative research, addiction, undergraduate students, Collegiate Recovery Program\n2 SAGE Open\nAs CRPs spread, there is a growing need for research to\nestablish best practices for campus-based recovery services\n(Smock, Baker, Harris, & D'Sauza, 2011). The growing\nquantitative and qualitative evidence base is shedding light\non the potential that CRPs have to prevent relapse and pro-\nmote academic success (Cleveland, Harris, Baker, Herbert,\n& Dean, 2007), but inquiry related to CRPs is still in early\nstages (Finch & Karakos, 2014) and limited both in scope\nand context. In addition, there has been a call for additional\nresearch into the experience of addiction recovery among\nstudents on college campuses (Laudet & Humphreys, 2013).\nA range of articles have explored dimensions of the sup-\nport provided by CRPs, especially at the Center for the Study\nofAddiction and Recovery (CSAR) at Texas Tech University.\nA review by Smock et al. (2011) described social support as\na key factor in preventing relapse among college students,\nand a number of studies have been conducted teasing out the\nimportance of different dimensions of social support. Bell\net al. (2009) conducted a qualitative study of CSAR students\nand found that the range of social supports provided by the\nCRP was seen as integral to students staying in recovery and\nin school. Casiraghi (2012) found a relationship between\naggregate social support components and perceived quality\nof recovery among students at four CRPs.\nLittle attention has been given to issues of social identity\nand stigma among students in recovery, however. Both are\nimportant considerations in recovery from addiction. The\nidentity reconstruction that occurs as a part of recovery has\nbeen framed differently by different authors. Some focus on\nthe emergence and evolution of new personal narratives\nRevah-Levy, Moro, & Baubet, 2008). From this vantage\npoint, one's ability to change depends on developing new\nstories about one's orientation toward life and the world.\nThis perspective is limited by the profoundly social nature\nof addiction and recovery (T. L. Anderson, 1994; Hughes,\n2007). Other studies of identity reconstruction emphasize\nthat it is a social practice, not simply a thought process.\nAddictions and recoveries are lived out on a daily basis,\nand through networks of people and places. Moving beyond\nthe addicted self involves leaving behind people, places,\nand routines and substituting recovery-based ones as an\nembodied reinvention of self (Hughes, 2007). Those who\ndevelop more sober social supports are more likely to\nremain sober themselves (K. G. Anderson, Ramo, Schulte,\nUnfortunately, stigma may also be a part of this experi-\nence, because although substance use and abuse may be nor-\nmative in many settings, to be labeled an addict is often\nstigmatized (Ahern, Stuber, & Galea, 2007; Dean & Poremba,\nexposed, or \"discredited,\" to use Erving Goffman's (1963)\nterm, by the revelation that they are not \"normal\" (p. 4).\nEven if they are not exposed, their ego identity, or felt sense\nof identity, may exact this punishment on themselves (T. L.\nAnderson, 1994). This is another reason that it is critical to\ndevelop a renewed sense of identity in recovery.\nDespite the focus on identity reconstruction in the addic-\ntion literature, there is little exploration of the topic as it\nrelates to college students in recovery, or the role of CRPs.\nTerrion (2012) touched briefly on this issue in interviews\nwith students in recovery at Canadian universities. She found\nthat being in school helped give the students a renewed, posi-\ntive sense of identity, and a heightened sense of their own\npotential (Terrion, 2012). However, there were no CRPs at\nthe universities involved, and the study did not delve deeply\ninto stigma or issues of social identity. This article explores\nthe social experiences of students in recovery on a rural col-\nlege campus, especially as they relate to identity reconstruc-\ntion and experiences of social stigma. It also examines the\nrole of a CRP on campus in helping students to cope with\nthese challenges.\nMethod\nThis qualitative in-depth interview study was conducted in\ncooperation with a CRP at a public university with approxi-\nmately 20,000 students. The CRP is housed in an accredited\nSchool of Public Health and is available to students who\nhave been in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction for at\nleast 6 months. The average time in recovery of a CRP stu-\ndent is 2\u00bd years. CRP students are 24 years of age, on aver-\nage, older than the average age of the general student\npopulation. CRP students take 12 credits of course work,\nand also work 18 hours a week on- or off-campus. As part\nof the CRP, students participate in weekly seminars focused\non coping skills, receive academic advising, and have\naccess to a range of community-building events (Eisenhart,\n2016). The university is located in a rural setting in the\nsoutheastern United States. The institutional review board\nat the university reviewed the study, and all participants\nprovided written informed consent. Researchers conducted\nin-depth interviews with 17 CRP-participating students.\nInterviewees were purposefully sampled to select students\nwho varied by gender, age, and academic class to incorpo-\nrate a range of perspectives. The CRP Director served as a\nkey informant who assisted in identifying potential partici-\npants and approaching them about the study. Eight partici-\npants were female (47%) and nine were male (53%).\nSixteen of the 17 (94%) were undergraduate students and\none (6%) was a graduate student. All participants were\nWhite. Participants had spent from several months to sev-\neral years in inpatient treatment programs for addiction,\nand some had resided, or still resided, in halfway houses\nclose to campus. Interviews were conducted in a private\nroom at the CRP, and interview lengths ranged from 20 to\n75 min. Interviews were conducted by Ms. Anderson.\nInterview guides were used to conduct the interviews.\nResearchers used the overarching study questions discussed\nabove (What are the social experiences of students in\nScott et al. 3\nrecovery on campus, especially as they relate to identity\nand stigma? What role does the CRP play in student cop-\ning?) to develop interview questions. Emphasis was placed\non developing a mix of questions based on both experi-\nences and perceptions, so students could discuss specific\nlife events and provide narratives around those events,\nwhile also sharing the impressions and emotions that\naccompanied them. The first overarching domain of ques-\ntions focused on students' experiences (a) with substance\nuse and treatment before coming to campus, (b) with the\ninitial transition to campus life, and (c) with coping skills\nand resources they used at these times. Example questions\ninclude \"How did the recovery process start for you?\" and\n\"What was your first week on campus like?\" The second\ndomain explored experiences with the CRP and the role it\nplayed in their coping and identity on campus. Questions\nwere asked about (a) specific CRP services (\"What are your\nimpressions of the weekly seminars?\") as well as (b) the\nbroader role of the CRP in their campus experience (\"How\nhas [the CRP] been a part of your life here on campus?\").\nInterviews were recorded and transcribed. Content analy-\nsis of interview transcripts and field notes was iterative\n(ongoing during data collection), using the editing approach\ndescribed by Crabtree and Miller (1999). This approach was\nselected because it provided a structured way to examine the\ntext data while also providing the ability to work with larger\nsegments of data (up to several paragraphs) as a single ana-\nlytic unit. This allowed narratives about specific experi-\nences to remain intact during analysis. Transcripts were\ncoded to identify text segments related to each question\ndomain, which were grouped together for analysis by code\n(Crabtree & Miller, 1999). The research team collaborated\nto develop the coding schema, and codes were assigned to a\nminimum of two researchers. Coding discrepancies were\nresolved through discussion, to enhance dependability.\nFollowing the coding process, themes were identified within\neach domain and expanded using reflexive memo-writing\n(Birks, Chapman, & Francis, 2008). Dr. Scott took the lead\non this portion of the process. Documentation of this pro-\ncess served as a form of confirmability. Themes that emerged\nfrom content analysis and memo-writing were triangulated\nby having all researchers involved in analysis. Themes iden-\ntified were discussed with select study participants as a form\nof member checking (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), to see whether\nthe research team's conclusions were credible in the eyes of\nthe students.\nFindings\nContent analysis generated five themes. The first three relate\nto the experience of campus life for CRP students. The last\ntwo themes relate to the CRP itself and the role it played as a\nstudent resource for social support and the reconstruction of\nidentity. These themes are discussed individually in the sec-\ntions that follow.\nCampus Life: Returning to College After\nTreatment\nStudents varied in the length of time they spent in inpatient\naddiction treatment, ranging from several months to several\nyears. Coming back to school was part of a process of re-\nentering the world of day-to-day living. In most cases, stu-\ndents were grateful for their time in these programs and\nviewed the experience as life-saving. But for many, the loss\nof the rigid structures and routines of treatment, with the sup-\nport networks they had there, made for a challenging transi-\ntion back into school. \"Rudderless,\" \"self-conscious,\" and\n\"vulnerable\" were terms used to describe the transition. The\nstudents spoke of the adjustment period in terms of starting\nfrom scratch, having to rebuild daily routines, habits, and\ncoping mechanisms. One student described it in this way: \"If\nyou're just getting out of treatment . . . you don't know what\nto do, you don't have the rules to guide you, or any of that\nkind of stuff. That's just the nature of the beast.\" A few\nwomen interviewed said that they found it especially daunt-\ning to relate to men again, because they were isolated from\nthem during treatment:\nI'd been in a halfway house with just sober people for so long,\nand the rules there . . . I couldn't even really talk to boys! And\nthen I come on campus, and it's like, \"Oh, my god!\" . . . it was\nreally uncomfortable and awkward at first.\nThis awkwardness extended more generally to the class-\nroom. Most of those interviewed said they were very quiet in\nclasses at the beginning, trying to \"get social skills back\" and\nre-learn the art of casual interaction.\nLayered upon this was the challenge of remaining sober\non a college campus that had the reputation of being a\n\"party school\" in the region. As explained by one CRP\nstudent, \"Students come here because they think it's a\nparty school, especially from these boring-ass country\ntowns . . . [site of university] is a Mecca, you know. They\nlike to pilgrimage here.\" Alcohol and discussions of it\nwere ubiquitous in class, in dorms, in study groups, walk-\ning on campus, and in the student center, according to\ninterview participants. Hearing these exchanges between\nothers was one challenge; being invited to participate\nposed an even bigger threat to coping. One woman in\nrecovery from alcohol addiction described being invited\nto a bar by a classmate:\nI remember one of my first classes I was in . . . I was still in\ntreatment, and I had a guy ask me to go to a bar . . . I tried to play\nit cool and stuff, like, \"I don't drink or anything like that,\" but it\nmessed me up, cause it was like my first experience with\nsomebody trying to offer.\nClassmates were not the only source of pressure to drink.\nIn some cases, students in recovery reported that professors\ntalked about drinking during class, making the classroom\n4 SAGE Open\nsetting additionally stressful. Here, a student describes a pro-\nfessor's \"drinking talk\":\nI'm almost sure [he] was a drunk, because he mentioned alcohol\nalmost every day in class, and said some things that I would've\nsaid back in the day. . . . When teachers, of all people, are talking\nat length about drinking . . . I don't want to hear about that.\nWith other students, he could draw clear lines about what he\nwould discuss. His professor's discussion, however, was out-\nside of his control.\nCampus Life: Feelings of Exclusion\nCRP students described a campus environment where alco-\nhol and other substances seemed to be everywhere. As a\nresult, alcohol consumption and, to a lesser degree, use of\ndrugs like marijuana or Adderall were perceived as \"typical\"\nby the CRP students. Many CRP students interviewed\nreported that \"Everybody drinks!\" and they were hard-\npressed to find anyone who did not adhere to that norm. As\none woman expressed, \"I think the hardest thing for people\nin recovery here [is that] I don't know anyone who is not\ndrinking, and I'm not going to go somewhere where people\nare drinking. It's not smart for my recovery.\"\nAvoiding functions that might serve alcohol effectively\nexcluded CRP students from most social events on campus,\naccording to interview participants.\nSome participants, while being committed to recovery,\nregretted missing out on the \"partying,\" which was seen as\npart of the college experience, and rite of passage to adult-\nhood in modern American life:\nPart of me feels due that college experience. For a lot of us it's a\nrite of passage, you fly the nest, and you get those years of\nirresponsibility before it's time to have a career. . . . I'm a young\nman, you know. I'd like to chase women, and to go to parties and\nthat kind of thing, but unfortunately . . . I can't successfully drink\nand use drugs, and stuff like that . . . I have a deeper understanding\nof where my place is, but sometimes I just wish . . .\nHe takes responsibility for his situation, but regrets the loss\nof those experiences.\nSome CRP students struggled to find their way in to \"nor-\nmal\" student life. One woman lamented, \"What do I do?\nWhat do I do to fit in, and what do I do to have fun? What do\nI do to be normal, a normal college student? \" For most stu-\ndents interviewed, this frustration was most acute during the\ninitial transition period.\nAbstinence was not the only characteristic that CRP stu-\ndents perceived as setting them apart from their peers. CRP\nstudents tended to be older than their classmates and were\nlikely to be living independently and working outside school,\nunlike many students on campus. They felt that they were\nmore studious and focused than many of their classmates.All\nthese factors contributed to the sense of differentness. One\nman in his mid-20s described how all these issues inter-\ntwined in his early days on campus:\nWhen I first came to school here it was really uncomfortable and\nawkward . . . I was 23 years old, I was in all freshman classes,\nand it was these kids who had just gotten out of high school . . .\nthey were talking about drinking all the time in class. I'm like\nthis nerd who's like doing all my homework, and they're like\n\"Oh, I got so wasted.\" . . . I was also living in a halfway house,\nso I had that fear, like I had \"halfway house addict\" on my\nforehead or something.\nHe was explicit describing his feeling of being stigmatized.\nOthers referred to feeling like \"freaks\" and \"just want[ing] to\nbe normal.\"\nThe stigma here is complex. CRP students long to shed\nthe stigmatized identity of \"addict\" as they transition to life\nas college students; however, by virtue of their sobriety, they\nare atypical on campus as well, because they must resist the\nprevailing norms and cannot take on the identity embraced\nby their student peers. So, in some sense, they are forced to\nexchange one stigmatized identity for another, or perhaps to\ncarry them both at the same time.\nSome CRP students found psychological strategies for\nresolving these mental struggles. One strategy for this\ninvolved focusing on other groups who were outside the per-\nceived mainstream and finding common cause. For example,\none woman related her exclusion to that of students in wheel-\nchairs: \"You see people wheeling around in wheelchairs\naround here. And I mean, some things in life you just don't\nget. I don't get to drink. It's not a big deal, most of the time.\"\nThis thinking helped to neutralize her situation and also gave\nher solidarity with another group of students on campus.\nCampus Life: Disclosure\nWith the burden of non-normative, yet largely hidden, identi-\nties came issues of disclosing these identities, or \"breaking\nanonymity.\" The students interviewed handled this in a range\nof ways. Some CRP students were very open about the fact\nthey were in recovery, both to students and professors:\nHey, I'm [name] and I'm in recovery. I don't even care I just\nbroke my anonymity! . . . I have not found a single person who\nhas been like \"Ewww!\" when I told them I was in recovery. If\nanything they've been like \"Wow, that's really cool. Good for\nyou, and you're in school?\"\nIn her case, disclosure had been a positive experience, and\npeople's reactions had helped her frame her identity as dif-\nferent, but not necessarily negative. Being admired for her\nability to overcome adversity, to deal with addiction, and go\nto school at the same time provided a powerful boost. Most\nCRP students, however, were more equivocal. Some dis-\nclosed to professors but not to other students, others told cer-\ntain classmates as they became acquainted, others were\nScott et al. 5\nhappy to discuss it on campus, but did not want to speak or\nadvocate beyond. The fear of being judged was powerful for\nsome: \"I'm still kind of iffy about all that. I still kind of pick\nand choose, you know. But I'm twenty-one years old and,\nand I still am worried about what others think of me.\"\nThe work of managing disclosure, making decisions\nabout whom to tell and when, and bracing for people's reac-\ntions, constitutes an additional strain for CRP students strug-\ngling to redefine themselves. Next, we examine the role the\nCRP on campus played in buffering these struggles and aid-\ning the students in claiming a positive identity, that of a stu-\ndent in recovery.\nRole of the CRP: Social Support\nIn 2008, a CRP was established at the university. The CRP\nhad a staff comprised of a director and a part-time graduate\nassistant. The director's office served as a gathering space\nfor the CRP during the day. In the evenings, after public\nhealth staff and students departed, 12-step meetings and\nother CRP events convened in the building's lobby.\nAll interview participants were involved with CRP activi-\nties. The CRP provided a range of support services.\nInstrumentally, the CRP served as a gateway for admission to\nthe university for some students. Felony convictions and\nresidence in halfway houses would have served as barriers to\nenrollment for some; for these students, the CRP director\ncould negotiate behavior contracts and offer other support\nupon admission. Once on campus, the CRP helped its stu-\ndents with registration, financial aid applications, and navi-\ngating the large campus grounds.\nStudents described the CRP as representing a \"safe, com-\nforting\" emotional safe space, and CRP peers were a ready-\nmade group of friends. One woman described how all her\nfriends were at the CRP (the Center) and that her sense of\ncommunity was defined by it:\nAll my friends are basically in the Center, and the Center kind of\nbrings us together in a way. And it brings like a community-like\natmosphere, and it's just helpful to just even have an office to\nstep into.\nStudents described the CRP was a safe harbor, a place\nwhere their defenses could come down. One student sum-\nmarized the role of the CRP this way:\nSay . . . an 18 year old kid is coming [to campus], and he's\nterrified . . . because he wants girls, he wants parties, and I'm--\nI'm terrified for him. But at least I know he has a place he can\ncome, where he's not gonna feel like he's a, he's a stranger.\nThe CRP was an important source of social support for\ninterview participants. However, the CRP also provided an\nimportant source of support in the process of identity forma-\ntion, a means of coping with issues of self-redefinition and\nstigma on campus.\nRole of CRP: Identity\nCRP students worked to develop self-definitions that sup-\nported them. One important piece of this puzzle for many\ninterview participants was embracing the idea of recovery.\nFor many students, recovery had become the cornerstone of\ntheir new inner and outer lives. Recovery language was\ntightly tied up with their experiences in treatment and their\nongoing commitment to the 12-step approach. \"Working the\nsteps\" provided the students interviewed with a scaffolding\nfor coping with stresses, both social and psychological.\nRecovery was portrayed as a way of being, a lifestyle, or by\nsome, as an identity:\nEverything kind of foundationed in recovery for me. . . . I'm just\nthe oddball out of the DT, like . . . It's more than just a lifestyle\nfor me, being in recovery has become an identity. . . . If you're\ngonna quit drinking and doing drugs on this campus, you\nprobably need to drop all your friends. And reinvent yourself.\nCreating a recovery-based social world was part of this cop-\ning process for most. Recreating yourself with a recovery\nidentity required a recovery-based social circle, activities\nand hobbies, and places to socialize.\nIt often required new physical geographies as well.\nAlmost every person interviewed had moved after leaving\ntreatment, often to another state. Only one woman inter-\nviewed had been a student at the university before becoming\nsober, and she struggled to reconcile her pre-treatment and\nrecovery worlds.\nI didn't want to lose the people, just the substances, but that\ndoesn't work. It took me probably six months to figure that out.\n. . . It's a little uncomfortable when I see them around town,\nbecause I had to tell them that. \"No, I cannot hang out with you.\nI cannot come see you. I cannot come watch a movie with you.\"\nReinventing herself as someone in recovery was a daunting\ntask, when all the reminders of her life before recovery were\nstill around her every day.\nThe CRP played a critical role for many interview partici-\npants by providing recovery-based activities, friends, and\nsocial settings. Being involved in this social world created a\nsafe space for the recovery identity to take root and grow,\nalong with ties to 12-step groups through the CRP or in the\ncommunity. These activities and friends were all campus-\nbased and campus-oriented; in short, they allowed the par-\nticipants to be students, as well as people in recovery.\nThrough the CRP, then, many found a way to bring together\na \"recovery identity\" and a \"student identity.\" These two\nidentities coalesced around the very existence of the CRP,\nphysically and conceptually. Through the CRP, they were\n\"students in recovery.\"\nClaiming this identity, and assuring that it was one viewed\npositively by the outside world, created work of its own. It\nwas intertwined with the reputation of the CRP, first and\n6 SAGE Open\nforemost, so the image of the program was seen as para-\nmount to the students individually and collectively. Many\nspoke of the need to prove themselves and make a name for\nthe CRP, lest people assume they were still \"just a bunch of\nloser addicts.\" They were quick to point out that the mean\ngrade point average (GPA) of CRP students was higher than\nthe campus average, that many were on the dean's and presi-\ndent's lists, and to describe their broad range of campus and\ncommunity service projects. It was vital to broadcast these\naccomplishments to foster the identity of a student in recov-\nery as someone who was bright, hard working, and someone\nwho \"gave back\" through the CRP.\nThe image of the CRP was seen as a very important\nresponsibility by students interviewed. For example, some\nstudents said they would leave the CRP if their grades fal-\ntered. \"If I dropped my GPA really low, I'd want to leave [the\nCRP]. I wouldn't want to affect [the CRP].\" A low GPA\nwould threaten the positive identity that they struggled to\ncultivate and reinforce the stereotypes that the group served\nto dispel. Removing oneself was seen as an altruistic gesture;\nit also suggested that one would not be worthy of the \"stu-\ndent in recovery\" mantle if she could not perform. Sentiments\nlike this run counter to simple explanations of social support.\nStudents who were struggling might lean more heavily on a\ngroup providing social support only. But in this case, the\nstakes were seen as higher and related to protecting everyone\nfrom the pain of stigma.\nThis sense of responsibility also affected the sense of\nopenness toward new members. Participants shared the idea\nthat the bar for joining the group should be high: \"I don't\nthink it would be fair to just let whoever wants in to come in\nat any time. I think it would tear the program apart.\" This\nsense of protectiveness was understandable but created the\nrisk of insularity and hostility to new members and added a\nshadow of tension to a protected space.\nOn the whole, the CRP provided students in recovery a\nhaven, and an aid in reconstructing positive identities on\ncampus. Most students interviewed had reached a tenuous\nequilibrium, where life was not easy, but their gratitude to be\nalive and learning was plentiful. As one young man mused,\n\"It just blows my mind every day when I walk across campus\nthat I am doing this. . . . [Feigns voice of prison guard] \"Wake\nup, [name], it's time for you to eat. You are still in jail.\"\nDiscussion\nIn this article, we explore the experiences of students return-\ning to college after treatment for addiction, especially experi-\nences related to identity reconstruction. Findings suggested\nthat their transitions to campus life were often ambivalent.\nThey felt both hopeful and awkward around other students, a\nfinding that was echoed by Finch and Wegman (2012).\nFeelings of uncertainty about where they fit in, and who they\nwere, were amplified by the campus environment. Some of\nthe challenges they noted were also noted by students\ninterviewed by Bell et al. (2009). They felt alcohol and some\ndrugs were omnipresent on campus, an idea that is consistent\nwith national data that show substance abuse on campuses to\nbe pervasive (CASA, 2007). This dynamic created a double\nbind for the students interviewed, as they tried to define\nrecovery identities free of stigma. Sobriety itself was per-\nceived as aberrant in this campus setting. Therefore, a \"nor-\nmal\" identity, and the sense of security and belonging that\ncomes with it, was felt to be out of their reach.\nThe CRP stepped into this space and provided the stu-\ndents support, both instrumental and emotional, to cope with\nthese challenges. The CRP provided a gathering space, social\nactivities, and a group of peers, all valuable elements to the\nconstruction of a daily life in recovery. In addition, the CRP\nwas a resource that helped students to establish positive iden-\ntities, both as individuals and as a collective on campus. As a\npart of the CRP, students could claim the identity of \"student\nin recovery.\" The CRP, in turn, was developing a positive\nreputation across campus for its service work and its above-\naverage GPA. The CRP provided an alternate identity that\nwas not completely normative, but was positive, and allowed\nsome place to rest, both physically and symbolically.\nThe success rates of CRP students at this university were\nnot unusual. In a national survey, 90% of CRP students were\nfound to graduate from college, compared with 61% of their\npeers on campus (Harper, 2013). This survey also confirmed\nthat CRP students were more likely to be older than your\ntypical college student, with a mean age of 25 (Laudet et al.,\nThese findings suggested that membership in the CRP\nmay be seen as a form of identity capital, a term coined by\nCote (1997). Sources of identity capital aid in the develop-\nment of stable, viable identities in emerging adults, in the\ncontext of a lack of traditional support structures (Cote &\nSchwartz, 2002). Cote has argued that all present-day youth\nface hostile conditions for identity development, as many\ninstitutional sources of identity formation have waned.\nStudents in recovery, then, represent a group where the need\nfor identity supports is exaggerated. The CRP is a tangible\nasset, or scaffold, for successful identity development work.\nThe findings here confirm the findings of other studies that\nCRPs are important sources of social support, but go further\nto reflect on their added importance as sources of identity\ncapital. It also adds to Terrion's (2012) framework of recov-\nery capital, which examines both internal and external\nresources among students in recovery, and is derived from\nPutnam's (2000) idea of social capital. Identity capital\nreflects the convergence of internal and external resources,\nrather than making a discrete inventory of the two, to aid\nstudents in recovery.\nThe student population here was predominantly White.\nThis is a limitation, but the lack of diversity is typical of\nCRPs. Nationally, 85% of CRP students are White (Laudet\net al., 2013). Other limitations include the lack of inclusion\nof students in recovery who were not involved with the CRP,\nScott et al. 7\nwho were by definition unknown to us, and the lack of inclu-\nsion of non-CRP students. This study did not collect detailed\ndemographic information about study participants, or\ndetailed information about participants' time in treatment or\ntype of treatment received. This is a study weakness that\nshould be addressed in future studies. In addition, CRPs dif-\nfer from campus to campus with regard to the services they\noffer and the roles they play on campus, so the findings here\nmay not transfer to all CRPs. In addition, this was a rural set-\nting, a state university, and a student body of close to 20,000\nstudents, and the experiences of college students in recovery\nmay vary based on these factors. Further research, qualitative\nand quantitative, is needed in this area. Quantitative studies\nare needed to ask whether identity and stigma issues bear on\nrelapse, academic success, or other indicators of well-being\nin this group. How these issues function on different types of\ncampuses and in the presence of CRPs with different struc-\ntures are additional unanswered questions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhern, J., Stuber, J., & Galea, S.
