Cox\nproportional hazards models were speci-\nfied to determine individual and neigh-\nbourhood eVects on homicide, suicide,\nmotor vehicle deaths, and other external\ncauses. Variances are adjusted for the\nclustered sample design of the NHIS.\nrelated deaths over the follow up period.\nMain results--Individual level eVects were\ngenerally robust to the inclusion of neigh-\nbourhood level variables in the models.\nNeighbourhood characteristics had inde-\npendent eVects on the outcome even after\nadjustment for individual variability. For\nexample, there was approximately a two-\nfold increased risk of homicide associated\nwith living in a neighborhood character-\nised by low socioeconomic status, after\nadjusting for individual demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics.\nConclusions--Social inequalities in injury\nmortality exist for both persons and\nplaces. Policies or interventions aimed at\npreventing or controlling injuries should\ntake into account not only the socioeco-\nnomic characteristics of people but also of\nthe places in which they live.\nRecent research in the area of socioeconomic\ndisparities in health has focused on the role of\nthe residential environment in determining\nhealth. A growing body of literature has\ndemonstrated that characteristics of communi-\nties where people live, such as family stability,\nhousing conditions, income and wealth, crime,\nunemployment, segregation, and political em-\npowerment, influence health outcomes and\nbehaviour.1\u00ad6 Social and economic characteris-\ntics of a community determine, in part, local\naccess to goods and services, the built environ-\nment, the level of residential stability, crime,\nsocial norms, and the ability to maintain social\ncontrol over individual behaviour. These analy-\nses take into account the social factors and\nindividual characteristics that contribute to\nindividual health outcomes. The basic goal of\nmost of this research is to diVerentiate between\nindividual risk and the broader societal sources\nof risk.\nA central hypothesis that drives much of the\ncontextual analysis of social inequalities and\nhealth is that area characteristics represent\nmore than simply the sum of its parts (for\nexample, the aggregation of individual\ncharacteristics).7 For instance, neighbourhood\nlevel economic segregation is hypothesised to\naVect all members of a community, regardless\nof their individual economic standing. Thus,\nindividual socioeconomic position may not\nprotect the health of people who are well oV\nwhen they live in poor environments. A\nnumber of recent studies have demonstrated\ncontextual eVects on the health of people using\nthe neighbourhood (that is, census tract, post-\ncode sector, ward) as the context. For example,\nindependent neighbourhood eVects have been\nfound for residential segregation on all cause\nmortality,4 area socioeconomic status6 and\ndeprivation8 on several adult health measures;\narea deprivation and cardiovascular disease risk\nfactors and mortality9; and female headship\nrates and heart disease mortality in women.10\nThe consistent findings of these studies\nstrongly suggest that characteristics of places\nare not simply proxies for individual character-\nistics; indeed, we should be focusing on both\npeople and places.11\nDeath from external causes such as inten-\ntional and unintentional injury has the most\nplausible link to the residential environment as,\nby definition, the source of injury is located\noutside the person. External cause mortality,\nhowever, is not well explored using techniques\nof the type described above. A conceptual\nmodel developed initially to understand motor\nvehicle injuries, the Haddon matrix, describes\nseveral factors related to the risk of injury:\nhuman, agent, and the environment (physical\nand socioeconomic).12 This descriptive frame-\nwork can also be extended to other causes of\ninjury death. We are particularly interested in\nthe impact of the residential socioeconomic\nenvironment on the risk of dying from external\ncauses. To date, there has been no comprehen-\nsive study that focuses on the joint contribution\nof individual and community socioeconomic\nStanford Center for\nResearch in Disease\nPrevention, Stanford\nUniversity School of\nRoad, Palo Alto, CA\nC Cubbin\nLaboratory for Social\nResearch and\nDepartment of\nSociology, University\nof Notre Dame\nF B LeClere\nCenter for Injury\nResearch and Policy,\nThe Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of\nHygiene and Public\nHealth\nG S Smith\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Cubbin\n(ccubbin@leland.stanford.edu)\nAccepted for publication\ncharacteristics to a person's risk of death from\ninjury. Several studies do, however, suggest that\naggregate measures are related to the overall\nrisk of an injury death.13\u00ad17 For example, Baker\net al found that low per capita income in the\ncounty of residence is related to higher\nhomicide and unintentional fatal injury rates\nfor the US and that unintentional injury rates\nare higher in rural compared with urban\nareas.13 Other findings regarding injury mor-\ntality have been based on specific geographical\nThe ecological studies discussed above\nsuggest that geographical measures of socio-\neconomic conditions are related to aggregate\ninjury mortality outcomes. We do not know,\nhowever, whether these measures have a direct\neVect on a person's mortality risk in the\npresence of individual covariates. The purpose\nof this paper is to bridge the gap in the\nliterature between the individual and ecological\nlevels regarding the relation between socioeco-\nnomic status and death because of injury.\nFirstly, we determine whether neighbourhood\nor community characteristics make an inde-\npendent contribution to the risk of injury death\nfor people. Secondly, we determine whether\nthese eVects act as a proxy for a person's socio-\neconomic status or persist in model specifica-\ntions that include both individual and neigh-\nbourhood measures.\nMethods\nDATA\nThis analysis is based on three sources of data:\nthe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)\nSurvey/Multiple Cause of Death Public Use\n1990 US Population Census. The NHIS is a\ncontinuing annual household interview survey\nrepresentative of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalised population of the United\nStates.18 Information is collected regarding\nhealth status, health conditions, sociodemo-\ngraphics, and other characteristics of each\nhousehold member. For the purposes of this\nstudy, we restrict the analysis to adult respond-\nhigh risk of injury mortality.\nThe NHIS/NDI file was produced by\nmatching characteristics common to both the\nNHIS and the National Death Index, which\ncontains the universe of death certificates and\nis searched from the date of interview through\nmethodology results in a score for each record\nbased on the number of characteristics\nmatched between the NHIS and the NDI and\nhas been shown to be highly accurate.20 Once\nmatches are identified, death certificates are\nobtained from the states to ascertain cause of\ndeath information.

Neighbourhood\nlevel variables are first added to a baseline\nmodel with individual demographic character-\nistics. The purpose of this step is to determine\nwhether neighbourhood characteristics are\ncorrelated with injury outcomes. Next, indi-\nvidual socioeconomic status is introduced into\nthe models to determine if neighbourhood\nconditions aVect the risk of a fatal injury net of\nTable 1 Neighbourhood variables and definitions, 1990 US Census Tract level data\nSocioeconomic status\nFamily income median income for all households\nPoverty proportion of persons whose annual income falls at or below 175% of the poverty line\nEducation proportion of persons 25 years and over with less than a high school graduate education\nHousing value median value of owner occupied housing units\nCrowded housing proportion of households with more than one person per room\nBlue collar proportion of employed persons in service occupations, farming and fishing occupations, precision production, craft and repair\noccupations, and operators, fabricators, and labourers\nRacial/ethnic concentration\nBlack proportion of all persons who are black\nHispanic proportion of all persons who are Hispanic\nResidential stability\nMobility proportion of persons ages 5 and older who lived in the same house for past five years\nUnemployment proportion of persons ages 16 and over who are unemployed\nHousing tenure proportion of occupied housing units that are rented\nFamily structure\nFemale headship proportion of families headed by women\nPoor female headship proportion of poor families which are headed by women\nDivorced proportion of persons ages 15 and over who are divorced or separated\nUrbanisation\nMulti-unit housing proportion of housing units with five or more units in structure\nUrban residence in an urban census tract\nTable 2 Sample characteristics,* respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (1987\u00ad1994) and those who died\nVariables\nAll respondents\n(SE)\nHomicide\n(SE)\nSuicide\n(SE)\nMotor vehicle\n(SE)\nOther external\n(SE)\nIndividual level\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nMarital status\nOccupation/employment status\nNeighbourhood level means\u00a7\n*Means, percentages, and standard errors adjusted for sample design, percentages may not add to 100 because of rounding.

If significant neighbourhood ef-\nfects remain after the reintroduction of indi-\nvidual covariates, strong evidence exists that\nthose eVects are real and not attributable to\npopulation composition. Each neighbourhood\ncharacteristic is tested in a separate empirical\nmodel because of extreme multicolinearity\nbetween the neighbourhood variables.\nThe National Health Interview Survey is a\ncomplex multistage probability sample that\nyields clustered observations. Because the\nsample is selected to be nationally representa-\ntive, households are not chosen in a simple\nrandom sample. The households are clustered\nbecause at each stage of the sample selection\nprocess, geographical areas are selected and\neventually targeted for interview. The survey\ndesign eVects that result should be accounted\nfor when producing estimates or multivariate\nmodels.24 For these analyses, the design eVects\nare accounted for by using SUDAAN version\nsoftware product, on the final models, which\naccounts for the sampling design to produce\nvalid variance estimates. It is also true that\nmultilevel research designs such as this intro-\nduce similar diYculties with statistical infer-\nence (related to clustering of people within\ncensus tracts in this case) that the use of\nspecialised software also helps alleviate.25\nResults\nTable 2 contains the characteristics of the sam-\nple. Persons who died of injury tended to be\nmale, unmarried, and of lower income (except\nfor suicide), and educational attainment and\nnot in white collar occupations compared with\nthe total sample. Persons who died from homi-\ncide were more likely to be black and of\nyounger age while those who died of suicide\nwere more likely to be white. The census tract\ncharacteristics indicate that persons who died\nof injury generally resided in neighbourhoods\nwith lower socioeconomic status, higher racial\nconcentration, and greater residential and fam-\nily instability compared with the total sample.\nTable 3 contains the adjusted risk ratios for the\nfour injury mortality outcomes resulting from\nthe Cox proportional hazards analyses in\nSUDAAN for respondents of the NHIS linked\nto the NDI and census data. From the models\nfor homicide, individual socioeconomic status\ndecreases the hazard ratios for black persons\nfrom 5.14 in the models adjusted only for age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity (not shown) to 3.62\nin the models with additional adjustment for\nmarital and socioeconomic status. While there\nis essentially no diVerence in homicide risk by\nincome, persons with low education and those\nwho are unemployed or out of the labour force\nare at significantly increased risk of death from\nhomicide. In the individual level models for\nsuicide, there is a strong increased risk\nassociated with being male, white, previously\nmarried, and out of the labour force. Men are\nat twice the risk for motor vehicle mortality\ncompared with women. Unmarried, low in-\ncome, unemployed, blue collar, and persons\nwithout a high school degree are all at\nsignificantly increased risk of motor vehicle\nfatalities. For other external causes of death,\nwhich include unintentional poisoning, suVo-\ncation, drowning, and falls, socioeconomic sta-\ntus, marital status, and employment status are\neach associated with the risk of death from\nthese causes. These results are consistent with\nprevious research on external causes of death.\nTable 4 presents the neighbourhood level haz-\nard ratio estimates adjusted for individual\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteris-\ntics and the NHIS sample design. One impor-\ntant consideration in multilevel research is that\nthe neighbourhood eVects not be confounded\nby a mis-specified individual level model.\nBecause of space considerations, we have not\nincluded the individual level hazard estimates\nin table 4 and the full tables are available from\nthe authors upon request. No model is\npresented with more than one neighbourhood\nvariable because of extreme multicolinearity\nbetween neighbourhood characteristics. Thus,\neach neighbourhood variable is included in the\nTable 3 Weighted individual level hazard ratios for injury mortality for persons aged\nHomicide Suicide\nMotor\nvehicle\nOther\nexternal\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nMarital status\nIncome to needs\nEducational attainment\nEmployment/occupational status\nEstimates adjusted for sample design. \u00a7For each additional year. \u00b6Includes other race. *p<0.05\nx Individual and neighbourhood character-\nistics are independently associated with\nthe risk of injury mortality.\nx Individual characteristics are generally\nrobust to the inclusion of neighbourhood\ncharacteristics in the models.\nx Individual race and socioeconomic status\ndiVerences in the risk of homicide are\nmediated through the residential environ-\nment.\nTable 4 Weighted neighbourhood level hazard ratios for injury mortality by cause of death and type of model used for\nHomicide Suicide Motor vehicle Other external\nDemo\u00a7 Full\u00b6 Demo Full Demo Full Demo Full\nSocioeconomic status\nFamily income\nPoverty\nEducation\nHousing value\nCrowded housing\nBlue collar\nRacial concentration\nBlack\nHispanic\nResidential stability\nMobility\nUnemployment\nHousing tenure\nFamily structure\nFemale headship\nPoor female headship\nDivorced\nUrbanisation\nMulti-unit housing\nUrban\nEstimates are adjusted for sample design and each neighbourhood variable is entered separately. \u00a7Demo = demographic model\nadjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity. \u00b6Full = full model adjusting for demographic characteristics, marital status, income to\nNeighbourhood determinants of injury 521\ntwo models with the first risk ratio adjusted for\nindividual level demographic variables (age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity) and the second for\nall individual covariates (age, gender, race/\nethnicity, marital status, and socioeconomic\nstatus). The hazard ratios are shown for both\nmodels to demonstrate how the relations can\nchange after adjustment for individual socio-\neconomic status measures in addition to simply\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity.\nHomicide\nThe measures of neighbourhood socioeco-\nnomic status operate in the expected direction\nfor homicide. Residence in neighbourhoods\nwith low family incomes, high poverty, high\nproportions of poorly educated persons, low\nhousing values, and high proportions of\ncrowded housing, each significantly increase a\nperson's risk of death attributable to homicide,\nafter controlling for demographic and socio-\neconomic characteristics. Increased residential\nconcentration of blacks also leads to higher risk\nof death from homicide regardless of a person's\nrace. Family structure, especially female head-\nship, is related to the risk of homicide in a\ngradient fashion where the risk of death\nincreases as the proportion of female headed or\npoor female headed households and divorced/\nseparated persons increases. All the relations\nwere attenuated when the models were ad-\njusted for individual socioeconomic status.\nThis suggests that a proportion of the neigh-\nbourhood eVect shown in the first column is\ncompositional but the remainder can be attrib-\nuted to neighbourhood socioeconomic condi-\ntions that are external to the individual. There\nwas no adjusted increased risk for persons liv-\ning in urban areas despite accepted wisdom of\nthe dangers of urban areas.\nSuicide\nFive neighbourhood characteristics had signifi-\ncant eVects on the risk of suicide. The\nindividual level hazard ratios remain essentially\nunchanged in the presence of neighbourhood\ncharacteristics. For residential mobility, family\nincome, poverty, black racial concentration,\nand poor female headed households, the\nsignificantly increased risks of suicide are seen\nat intermediate levels only. There is little or no\nattenuation with the introduction of individual\nsocioeconomic status.\nMotor vehicle\nThe results for motor vehicle fatalities show\nthat residents of neighbourhoods with lower\nsocioeconomic status and higher proportions\nof poor households headed by women are at\nhigher risk. In contrast, persons living in urban\nareas or highly racially segregated neighbour-\nhoods are at lower risk. As in the models for\nhomicide, the hazard ratios for low socioeco-\nnomic status and unemployed persons are\nslightly attenuated (not shown).\nOther external causes\nThe risk of death from other external causes is\nincreased for people living in poor and crowded\nareas, while persons are at decreased risk in\nurban areas and neighbourhoods with a high\npercentage of Hispanic persons. Individual\nsocioeconomic status seems to account for\nmuch of the observed neighbourhood eVects or\nattenuates the eVects where they remain\nimportant covariates. The individual hazard\nratios for socioeconomic status are attenuated\nin the contextual models (not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn this research, we disentangle the eVects of\nboth socioeconomic status of people and that\nof neighbourhoods on individual injury mor-\ntality risk. The analysis is to our knowledge\nunique in the field of injury mortality research\nand represents an important step toward\nunderstanding how disadvantages, measured\nfor both people and places, can operate to\nincrease mortality from external causes. The\nfindings presented here support the hypothesis\nthat both individual and neighbourhood char-\nacteristics each contribute independently to\nthe risk of injury death. The contribution,\nhowever, varies considerably by external cause.\nFor homicide, even after adjusting for\nindividual and neighbourhood socioeconomic\nstatus, black adults are still at increased risk\ncompared with whites although the magnitude\nis reduced considerably when neighbourhood\ncharacteristics are introduced. The neighbour-\nhood eVects suggest that social, economic, and\nstructural conditions in the community (for\nexample, availability or ownership of firearms)\nare important determinants of homicide. Indi-\nvidual racial and socioeconomic diVerences are\nprobably explained by mechanisms that work\nthrough the residential environment. Indeed,\nCenterwall15 found that when household\ncrowding is used as a measured of neighbour-\nhood socioeconomic conditions, there were no\nstatistical diVerences in domestic homicide by\nrace.\nThe risk of suicide is statistically unrelated to\nindividual socioeconomic status. This is in\ncontrast with the findings of Kellermann et al\nthat demonstrate an increased risk of all\nsuicides for persons with limited education.27\nTheir findings, however, are based on a popu-\nlation from a specific geographical area that\nrestricts their ability to generalise to the nation.\nWe find about a 50% increased risk for persons\nliving in neighbourhoods with the following\ncharacteristics--low socioeconomic status,\nhigh racial concentration, and high residential\nand family instability. These places may\nincrease feelings of hopelessness or social isola-\ntion for people who may be considering suicide\nand, thus, contribute to the increased risk.\nBlacks are at significantly lower risk of suicide\ncompared with whites even after controlling for\nindividual socioeconomic status, marital sta-\ntus, and neighbourhood characteristics. This\nremains relatively unexplored but may be\nbecause of cultural diVerences to the resolution\nof depressive episodes.\nNeighbourhood socioeconomic status, racial\nconcentration, and family structure, net of\nindividual variability, are related to motor vehi-\ncle mortality. Not surprisingly, persons living in\nurban areas were found to be at decreased risk\nreflecting decreased exposure to traYc. This is\nconsistent with the results of a study that\nexamined geographical patterns of motor vehi-\ncle mortality by county and found an inverse\nrelation with population density, most probably\nrelated to the increased distances travelled in\nrural areas28 and less access to nearby medical\ncare, especially trauma facilities. The neigh-\nbourhood eVects suggest that persons in high\nrisk rural areas may have less access to newer,\nmore crashworthy cars and safer roads, have\ngreater distances to travel, and more exposure\nto hazardous driving conditions and behaviour,\nwhich could eVect all residents of a commu-\nnity. The protective eVect of higher black racial\nconcentration may be attributable to its high\ncorrelation with urbanisation.\nOne of the most obvious eVects of the exter-\nnal environment is that experienced by those\nliving in rural (non-urban) settings. For other\nexternal causes, those living in urban areas are\nprotected, probably in part because of the high\nrisk of fatalities in rural areas from farm equip-\nment, less access to medical care, and other\nrisks associated with working in the outdoors.\nWe speculate that the increased risk associated\nwith living in areas characterised by concen-\ntrated poverty and crowded housing is related\nto the hazardous physical environment (for\nexample, deaths attributable to falls), poor fire\nprotection and use of equipment such as ovens\nor space heaters for heating (for example,\ndeaths resulting from fire or suVocation),\nhazardous work environments (for example,\noccupational fatalities from various causes), or\nlimited access to safe recreational facilities (for\nexample, deaths caused by drowning).\nFamily structure and residential stability are\noften used to measure social disorganisation or\na community's inability to maintain eVective\nsocial controls.29 With higher levels of mobility\nand single parent households, it may be more\ndiYcult for a community to collectively sustain\na sense of empowerment or control the appear-\nance of their neighbourhood or the behaviour\nof its residents. Injury mortality is often viewed\nas a consequence of the inability of people to\nprotect themselves from intentional or unin-\ntentional harm. The deterioration of commu-\nnity functions, both formal and informal, asso-\nciated with social disorganisation increases a\npersons exposure to the risk of harm. Such fac-\ntors are believed to be in part responsible for\nthe sudden increase in injury mortality in Rus-\nsia over recent years.30 This research demon-\nstrates that similar people (based on demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic characteristics),\nsuVer disproportionately in disorganised envi-\nronments such as those described here.\nFavourable socioeconomic conditions reflect\nan area's material resources and access to high\nquality municipal services, such as fire and\npolice protection, safe roads, and recreational\nfacilities. For instance, regardless of a person's\nsocioeconomic status, this study shows that\nthat person is more likely to die of an injury\nfrom any cause if they reside in an area with\nhigh poverty levels. AZuent neighbourhoods\nhave lower crime rates, restrict access to cars\nand \"undesirable\" neighbours, and their resi-\ndents are less likely to tolerate deviant behav-\niour, each of which may be protective factors\nagainst injury mortality.\nAdditional analyses were conducted to assess\nthe degree to which missing geocodes aVected\ninferences (analyses not shown). Respondents\nwith missing geocodes were more likely to be\nyounger, white or Hispanic, married, and of\nhigher socioeconomic status when compared\nwith respondents whose records could be\ngeocoded in part because these reflect new\nsuburban developments not assigned geo-\ncodes. In addition, we ran the individual level\nmodels with the full sample (including persons\nwith missing geocodes) to assess the degree to\nwhich the individual level estimates were\naVected by the exclusions. Minor diVerences\nwere found.\nThere are several limitations in this study.\nNeighbourhood characteristics are measured\nin 1990 whereas the date of interview is from\nsimultaneity bias as the neighbourhood charac-\nteristics in some cases are measured after a\nperson has died. However, this is not expected\nto be a major concern because neighbourhoods\ngenerally do not change significantly over the\nshort time period involved.31 What is perhaps\nmore problematic conceptually is that neigh-\nbourhood measures are static; that is, we have\nno information regarding the historical context\nof neighbourhoods, how they are changing, or\nhow long people have been exposed to their\nneighbourhood environments.32 This analysis\nessentially represents a snapshot of the eVects\nof neighbourhood conditions on injury mor-\ntality outcomes.\nThirdly, there was no way to distinguish\nbetween occupational injuries. This is impor-\ntant because people working in high risk occu-\npations and industries have diVerent risk\nprofiles than the rest of the population and may\nbe in part responsible for increased motor\nvehicle rates in blue collar workers.33 The\nanalysis would be strengthened if it were possi-\nble to separate the work related cases from the\n\"other external cause\" category. However,\nusing a method34 to identify causes likely to be\nindustrial, a small proportion of other external\ncauses were likely to be work related (14%) and\nseparate unpublished analyses have shown that\noverall only 4.7% of all injury deaths in our age\ngroup occurred \"at work.\"\nThe main strength of the study is the ability\nto estimate jointly the individual and neigh-\nbourhood level determinants on an individual\nlevel outcome. We used comprehensive meas-\nures of individual socioeconomic status to\nminimise observing neighbourhood eVects\nattributable to confounding.35 This research\nlinks three national and reliable datasets in a\nlongitudinal design that strengthens our exter-\nnal validity, and the ability to generalise to the\npopulation as a whole.\nFuture research needs to analyse neighbour-\nhood eVects for women and men separately.\nSimilarly, cross level interaction eVects ought\nto be investigated to determine whether\nneighbourhood eVects vary by individual\ngender, race, ethnicity, marital status, and\nNeighbourhood determinants of injury 523\nsocioeconomic status. For instance, given the\nvery diVerent neighbourhood environments of\nblacks compared with whites, it is reasonable\nto expect the neighbourhood eVects for homi-\ncide to have diVerent magnitudes for the two\ngroups. Innovative and thoughtful approaches\nto characterising neighbourhoods is sorely\nneeded to understand the most important\nmodifiable determinants of injury risk. Finally,\nadditional research is needed to identify the\nintervening mechanisms between neighbour-\nhood characteristics and injury. For example,\nwhat social processes are involved in how\nunfavourable socioeconomic neighbourhood\nconditions result in increased injury risk to\npeople and how can they be modified?32\nIdentifying neighbourhood eVects has im-\nportant policy implications as characteristics of\na peron's local social and economic environ-\nment can influence injury risk. Thus, social\npolicies, planning practices, and interventions\nat the community level focusing both on places\nand people are likely to be more eVective injury\ncontrol strategies than those focusing on\nchanging individual behaviour. Communities\nought to hold local government policymakers\nand planners accountable to ensure that goods\nand services are eYciently distributed accord-\ning to need. In addition, broader social and\neconomic policies related to taxation, the mini-\nmum wage, labour markets, and social capital\nare likely to have a positive impact on the health\nand well being of residents of disadvantaged\ncommunities and their injury risk. These\nmeasures serve to promote a shift in focus from\npeople to intervening on places using the tools\nof public health practice and advocacy.\nWe would like to thank Stephanie Robert for comments on an\nearlier draft.\nFunding: this work was supported in part by a joint fellowship\nfrom the Association of Schools of Public Health and the Cent-\ners for Disease Control to Dr Cubbin and in part by grant R29\nAA 07700 from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and\nAlcoholism and with assistance from Auckland University\nInjury Prevention Research Centre.\nConflicts of interest: none.\n1 Sampson RJ, Lauritsen JL.
