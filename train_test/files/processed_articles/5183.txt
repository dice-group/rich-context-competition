The relationship between PGLI and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c\n), fluid\noverload (FO), and inflammatory markers was investigated.\nResults: A total of 43 stable PD patients participated in the study. Significant positive correlations\nwere found between PGLI and HbA1c\n, FO, plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and\nplasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. HbA1c\n, FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 levels were\nsignificantly higher in patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared with those with PGLI 3 g/kg/day.\nConclusions: PGLI values >3 g/kg/day may be associated with poor glycaemic control, over\nhydration and augmented inflammation. PGLI might be a useful tool for the quantitative assessment\nof the PGL and could be applied when managing PD patients.\n",

This percentage of\ndiabetic patients is similar to that observed\nin the majority of dialysis units and\nreflects the high proportion of diabetic\npatients requiring renal replacement ther-\napy.

The correlation between peritoneal glucose load index (PGLI) and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) as\nmeasured in stable peritoneal dialysis patients (n \u00bc 43).\n, FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6\nlevels suggest that when PD patients receive\nmore glucose to their peritoneal cavity, this\nmight impair their glycaemic control, result\nin a higher FO and it may exaggerate their\ninflammatory status.\nIn the present study, the hydration status\nwas assessed accurately by whole-body\nbioimpedance spectroscopy and the periton-\neal glucose load was determined accurately\nusing PGLI. PGL leads to the development\nof cumulative peritoneal damage that\nappears over time as a result of prolonged\nexposure to glucose, glucose degradation\nproducts generated during glucose-based\nperitoneal dialysis solution (GBPDS) steril-\nization, advanced glycation end products,\nnon-physiological pH and as a result of a\nhigher incidence of peritonitis among PD\npatients receiving GBPDS.15\u00ad18 The periton-\neal membrane damage activates two vicious\ncircles: first, the increased permeability of\nthe damaged peritoneal membrane leads to\nfluid accumulation that necessitates utiliza-\ntion of hypertonic PD solutions leading to\nhigher PGL and so on (Figure 6). Secondly,\nthe peritoneal membrane damage, increased\nmembrane permeability and fluid accumu-\nlation stimulate the inflammatory pro-\ncess.15\u00ad18 Inflammation, in turn, enhances\nperitoneal membrane impairment and\npermeability leading to more fluid accumu-\nlation and so forth (Figure 6).26 Moreover,\nthe inflammatory process provoked by the\nimpaired peritoneal membrane aggravates\nthe peritoneal membrane damage leading to\nmore inflammation with all that entails\n(Figure 6). Utilization of hypertonic\nGBPDS, FO and chronic inflammation are\ncommon problems in PD patients that con-\ntribute to the development of CV disease\nThis present study demonstrated that\n, PGLI, plasma hsCRP, plasma IL-6\nand FO values were significantly higher in\npatients with diabetes mellitus compared\nwith the nondiabetic patients. The impact\nof the presence of diabetes mellitus on\nhydration status and inflammation in PD\npatients was evaluated in previous studies.\nFor example, in a cross-sectional cohort of\ncountries, which used the same BCM device\nas the present study to assess volume status,\ndiabetes mellitus was shown to be associated\nwith higher relative tissue hydration.29\nMoreover, diabetic PD patients were more\nTable 3.

The\nresults of the present study demonstrated\nthat the PGLI, as well as the presence of\ndiabetes mellitus, may affect the hydration\nstatus and inflammation in PD patients.\nHigher PGLI in diabetic patients may pro-\nvide an explanation for why diabetic PD\npatients had higher levels of HbA1c\n, inflam-\nmatory cytokine levels and FO. Diabetic PD\npatients, especially in cases with poor gly-\ncaemic control, frequently need higher\nGBPDS concentrations that contribute to\nhigher PGLI, more glucose absorption from\nthe peritoneal dialysis fluid, leading to\nhigher HbA1c\n, more peritoneal membrane\ndamage, increased membrane permeability,\nstimulation of the inflammatory process and\nfluid accumulation.9\u00ad12 No significant cor-\nrelations between the analysed parameters\nand the dry weight were observed in the\npresent study.\nThe present study demonstrated that FO,\nplasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values were\nsignificantly higher among diabetic patients\nwith PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared with dia-\nbetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day,\nwhich suggests that the PGLI tool may be\nuseful when applied in diabetic PD patients.\nThe present study also demonstrated that\nFO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values\nwere significantly higher in nondiabetic\npatients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared\nwith diabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/\nday, but the values of the tested parameters\nwere lower than the values in diabetic\npatients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day. These\npresent results suggest that a PGLI >3 g/\nkg/day had a greater negative impact on\nhydration status and inflammation than the\npresence of diabetes mellitus per se in dia-\nbetic PD patients who are known a priori to\nFigure 5. Receiver operating characteristics\n(ROC) curves were applied to determine the validity\nof the influence of peritoneal glucose load index\n(PGLI) on fluid overload (FO), plasma high sensitivity\nC-reactive protein (hsCRP) and plasma interleukin-6\n(IL-6). The results showed that PGLI significantly\ninfluenced all of these parameters.\n50 Journal of International Medical Research 43(1)\nhave higher tissue hydration and are more\nlikely to have inflammation than nondia-\nThe present study demonstrated that the\nFO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values\nwere significantly higher in nondiabetic\npatients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared\nwith nondiabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/\nkg/day, suggesting that the PGLI tool may\nbe useful when applied in nondiabetic PD\npatients. The present study also demon-\nstrated that the FO, plasma hsCRP and\nplasma IL-6 values in diabetic patients with\nPGLI 3 g/kg/day and in nondiabetic PD\npatients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day were\nsimilar, which suggests that PGLI >3 g/kg/\nday had a greater impact on hydration\nstatus and inflammation than the presence\nof diabetes mellitus alone.\nIt is inaccurate to conclude that higher\nPGLI had an influence on FO and inflam-\nmatory status (plasma hsCRP, plasma IL-6)\nwithout excluding the effect of diabetes as a\nconfounder, so hierarchical multiple regres-\nsion and ROC curve analyses were applied,\nwhich demonstrated that PGLI significantly\ninfluenced FO, plasma hsCRP and\nplasma IL-6. This influence was main-\ntained when diabetes was added as a\nconfounder.\nFigure 6. The vicious circles initiated by an increase in peritoneal glucose load (PGL) that lead to peritoneal\nmembrane impairment, fluid overload, augmentation of inflammation, and eventually increased cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality.\nThe results of the present study revealed\nthat the cut-off of PGLI that was associated\n>7%, plasma hsCRP\nlevel >5 mg/dl and plasma IL-6 level\nof PGLI 3 g/kg/day seem to be appropriate\nbut values >3 g/kg/day may be associated\nwith FO and augmented inflammation that\nare considered well known risk factors for\nCV morbidity and mortality in patients with\nend-stage renal disease and on maintenance\ndialysis.\nThe findings of this present study showed\nthat the PGLI may be a promising, simple,\ninexpensive, noninvasive and practical tool\nfor the quantitative assessment and moni-\ntoring of the PGL and may be considered in\nmanaging diabetic as well in nondiabetic PD\npatients at the bedside or in an outpatient\nclinic. Management of PD patients is usually\ncarried out by the patients themselves and\nsometimes by one of their family members.\nConsequently, patients, their relatives,\nfamily physicians and nephrologists should\ncooperate together in managing PD patients\nand all of them could easily use the PGLI\ntool for the assessment of the PGL, hydra-\ntion status and inflammation.\nThe present study had a number of\nlimitations and should be considered a\npilot study that was conducted in a single\ncentre and included a relatively small\nnumber of patients. Additional larger multi-\ncentre, randomized control trials with more\nhomogenous groups are needed to deter-\nmine the target objectives of PGLI.\nIn conclusion, PGLI values >3 g/kg/day\nmay be associated with poor glycaemic\ncontrol, over hydration and augmented\ninflammation in stable PD patients. PGLI\nseems to be a simple, inexpensive, noninva-\nsive and practical tool for the quan-\ntitative assessment of the PGL that could\nbe used during the management of PD\npatients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
