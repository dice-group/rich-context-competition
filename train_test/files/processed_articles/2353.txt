Three hypotheses are proposed and tested: that\nracial prejudice is declining in Britain; that this decline is principally generational\nin nature; and that greater prejudice is shown towards more culturally distinct\nAsian minorities than black minorities. Strong evidence is found for the first two\nhypotheses, with evidence of an overall decline in prejudice and of a sharp decline\nin prejudices among generations who have grown up since mass black and Asian\nimmigration began in the 1950s. Little evidence is found for the third hypothesis:\nBritish reactions towards black and Asian minorities are broadly similar suggest-\ning racial differences may still be the main factor prompting white hostility to\nBritish minorities.\n",

Black and Asian Britons, who constitute nearly a tenth of the\npopulation (Office for National Statistics 2003) are less likely to be employed\nand are more likely to work in worse jobs, live in worse houses and suffer\nAlthough some of these differences are the result of factors like lower quali-\nfications and residence in more depressed parts of the country, academic\nstudies also find a consistent gap or `ethnic penalty' (Heath and Cheung 2007)\nthat cannot be explained by these. White racial prejudices are likely to be an\nimportant explanation for these disadvantages, shown in experimental studies\nwhere black and Asian job applicants with identical qualifications to white\napplicants were disproportionately rejected by employers (Noon 1993; Esmail\nFord (School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester) (Corresponding author email: rob.ford@manchester.ac.uk)\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden,\nWhile the impact of racial prejudices on the lives on Britain's minorities\nhas been much studied, much less academic attention has been paid to exam-\nining the distribution of such prejudices among the white population, despite\ntheir dramatic impact on the lives of black and Asian Britons. There have\nonly been two academic studies specifically attempting to examine the pat-\nterns of white racial prejudice, and these have only undertaken limited\nanalysis using an unreliable measure of racial prejudice (Evans 2002; Rothon\nThis article utilizes two unexamined indicators of white racial prejudice to\nanalyse the trends in and the social distribution of racial prejudice among\nwhite Britons. It makes three key contributions. Firstly, it shows how racial\nattitudes in Britain are structured by generation, with a large decline in expres-\nsions of prejudice among the cohorts who have grown up since immigration\nbegan. Consequently, levels of racial prejudice are falling and are likely to fall\nfurther. Secondly, it casts light on the social distribution of racial prejudice.\nLevels of racial prejudice are much lower among the highly educated, the\nprofessional classes and among women. The attitudes of these groups also\nchange more rapidly between generations, resulting in a divergence in racial\nattitudes among the young. Thirdly, it shows that there are few differences in\nthe levels and social distribution of white prejudice against black and against\nAsian Britons, suggesting the more distinctive cultural and religious practices\nof British Asian communities do not attract greater hostility from the white\npopulation.\nRacism in decline?\nFour major factors may be encouraging a decline in white racial prejudices in\nBritain. Firstly, racial prejudices now lack the intellectual and cultural supports\nthey had in the past.Arguments about white biological, economic and cultural\nsuperiority have lost legitimacy over the past fifty years. Claims of white racial\nsuperiority have been thoroughly debunked by geneticists and biologists, and\nhave been politically and socially marginalized as a result of their strong\nassociation with Nazi fascism and the Holocaust. The belief that white Euro-\npean cultures are economically superior has become harder to maintain in the\nface of rapid economic development in East Asia, India and elsewhere.\nRudyard Kipling's `white man's burden' argument that only white rule can\nproduce stable and democratic governance in poor colonial societies, has been\ndealt a severe blow by the manifold abuses and subsequent collapse of the\nEuropean colonial empires and the white minority regimes in South Africa,\nZimbabwe and the American South.3 While these biological, economic and\npolitical arguments for white superiority are not the only bases on which racial\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nprejudices form, they are powerful supports for such prejudices as they all\nmake a strong and allegedly empirical case for the inferiority of non-white\ngroups.\nSecondly, racially prejudiced arguments have also lost all elite political\nsupport in Britain. The rapid increase in black and Asian immigration in the\nnatory politicians, such as Enoch Powell and his supporters within the Con-\nservative party and the extreme right National Front (Schoen 1977; Husbands\nsharply reduced immigration rates4 and quelled public anxiety, expressions of\nracial prejudice have become unacceptable among Britain's political elites.\nThe need to integrate Britain's growing ethnic minority populations and\ncombat the damaging effects of prejudice and discrimination have lead to a\npolitical consensus built around the celebration of diversity (Solomos 1989;\nLayton-Henry 1992). Public figures who make even mildly prejudiced com-\nments are now roundly condemned and swiftly despatched.\nThirdly, it has become harder to argue that Britain's ethnic minority groups\nare not truly `British'. The white British are exposed on an everyday basis to\nblack and Asian Britons on the television, the radio and the sports field. As a\nresult, the ethnic minorities these elite performers represent occupy a much\nmore prominent place in the `imagined community' (Anderson 1991) of the\nBritish nation. As Paul Gilroy puts it: `Nobody post-Lenny, Lennox and\nLinford, Scarey, Denise and Naomi, could doubt that there is, after all, some\nkind of black somewhere in or rather underneath the Union Jack.' (Gilroy\n2002: xxiv). This argument is supported by empirical analysis of British\nnational identity beliefs, which show a sharp decline in the importance\naccorded to whiteness and British ancestry as markers of `being British' (or\nEnglish, Scottish, Welsh) among those born since mass immigration began\nFourth, social contact with ethnic minorities has also become a much more\nfrequent occurrence for many white Britons. Britain's ethnic minority commu-\nnities have grown rapidly and have become more geographically dispersed,\nwith large numbers migrating internally as they grow older and richer, moving\nfrom the inner city areas where they first settled to the more prosperous and\npreviously all-white suburbs and rural areas (Simpson 2007). Ethnic minorities\nhave also become more socially dispersed. First generation migrants, who\noften lacked British qualifications or English language skills, were concen-\ntrated in poorly paid manual jobs. Their British born children and grandchil-\ndren are much better qualified and many more have succeeded in securing\nwhite-collar jobs, despite continuing discrimination (Berthoud 2000; Heath\nand Cheung 2007). As a result of these developments most white Britons are\nnow much more likely to regularly encounter black and Asian faces in their\nneighbourhoods and in their workplaces. This increases the chances of\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 611\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\ninformal social contact in relaxed environments, which research has shown\nfour prominent social trends all suggest that levels of white prejudice against\nblack and Asian minorities should now be declining.\nHypothesis 1:White prejudice against ethnic minorities is declining in Britain.\nIs racial prejudice an attitude or a `value'?\nAn important issue that has received relatively little attention in debates about\nracism in Britain is the nature of racially prejudiced beliefs. Most beliefs\nexpressed in public opinion can be characterized as either attitudes or as\nvalues. Attitudes are less stable than values, and often less informed. They are\n`off the top of the head' opinions formed `on the basis of whatever consider-\nations are most immediately salient' (Zaller 1992: 266).Values are less respon-\nsive to changes in current conditions, tending instead to be moulded by\nconditions in an individuals' youth and early adulthood, and remaining stable\nexists about where most public attitudes fit on this spectrum it is generally\naccepted that complex political issue debates, which tend to elicit less stable\nand coherent responses from the public, fall more on the `top of the head' side\ngeneral ideological preferences for redistribution or the free market, tend to\nfall more on the `stable, formed in youth' side (Evans, Heath and Lalljee 1996;\nWe may expect racial prejudice to behave more like a value for two reasons.\nFirstly, while policy debates about diversity and multiculturalism are complex\nand multifaceted, the underlying division over race and racism is clear and\nwidely understood: an individual either holds negative views about an ethnic\ngroup or she does not. Secondly, racial attitudes involve an explicit value\njudgment: expressing prejudice means rejecting the right of a racially defined\ngroup to equal regard and equal treatment. Racial prejudices may therefore be\nmore like core value orientations, with individuals retaining throughout their\nlives the general views about ethnic minority groups that they formed in youth.\nThe kind of decline we can expect in racial prejudice will be affected by the\nkind of belief it is. If racial prejudice is primarily an attitudinal response to\ncurrent circumstances, then the shift in attitudes should be more rapid and\nmore evenly distributed across all respondents, as they will all be sensitive to\nthe changed social environment. On the other hand, if prejudices against\nminority groups resemble other core political values, we may expect them to\nchange more slowly, and to show a generational structure. The rapid ethnic\ndiversification of Britain since 1950 means younger generations are far more\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nexposed to black and Asian minorities during the years when values are\nformed, both directly through social contact and indirectly through media and\npolitical elites.We should therefore see progressive declines in racial prejudice\nin generations growing up since the beginning of mass migration, as the\nmembers of each successive cohort will have had progressively more con-\ntact with minorities and minority culture during their impressionable years.\nHowever, although shifts in attitudes between generations may be large, the\noverall pace of attitude change will be much slower, as it will be primarily\ndriven by generational replacement.\nHypothesis 2: The pattern of change in racial prejudice will be affected by\nwhether prejudice behaves like an attitude or a value:\n(a) If prejudice behaves like an attitude, responses will be evenly distributed\nacross age groups and changes in responses will be rapid.\n(b) If racial prejudice is a value, responses will be structured by generation,\nand the overall rate of change in responses will be slower.\nThe nature of British prejudice: aversion to `blackness' or cultural racism?\nMuch of the most insightful writing on race and racism in modern Britain has\nbeen less focused on changes in the overall prevalence of racial prejudices than\nwith understanding the origins and content of racist beliefs and the related\ndevelopment of anti-racist ideologies used to combat them (Centre for Con-\nEarly studies of British racism, while acknowledging that cultural differences\nalso provoke hostility, were in no doubt that the most important factor pro-\nvoking hostility and discrimination was skin colour (Daniel 1968; Rose and\nassociates 1969). Reacting to these findings, anti-racist theorists of the 1970s\nand 1980s argued that the cultural differences between black and Asian\nminorities were less important than their common experience of white dis-\ncrimination and hostility as `black' groups.They believed that the best strategy\nto combat racial prejudice was for all `black' minorities to mobilize against it\nMore recently, Nira Yuval-Davis,Tariq Modood and others have taken issue\nscholars argue that in modern Britain, where biological arguments about race\nhave lost all legitimacy, `colour racism' is a declining problem. Colour matters\nas a means for identifying members of cultural minorities, and it is the percep-\ntion of essential and irreducible differences in values and cultural practices\nbetween such racially identified groups and the majority which generates\nprejudice and discrimination, a phenomenon Modood calls `cultural racism'.\nModood argues that this cultural racism particularly affects Asian minorities,\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 613\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nwhose cultures, languages and religious beliefs differ more from the majority,\nand attract greater white hostility:\nSouth Asians . . . are clearly visible as a non-white group: they are a prin-\ncipal object of racist victimization, of negative treatment by whites on the\ngrounds that they are an undesirable `Other'. They suffer, therefore, from\ncolor racism. But they also suffer from cultural racism: a certain culture is\nattributed to them, is vilified, and is even the ground for discrimination-\n. . . .The perception of Asians . . . is that their defects lie deep in their\nculture rather than in a biology that produces their culture. This means\nthat Asians, more than blacks, suffer a double racism. (Modood 2005: 7,\nemphasis added)\nOne of the original theorists of a unified `blackness' experienced by all British\nminorities, Paul Gilroy, has in recent writing lamented this `turn away from the\nsimple efficacy of blackness'. He claims it has made `anti-racism less politically\nfocused and certainly more difficult if not impossible to organise' (Gilroy 2002,\np. xiv). Gilroy dismisses claims about the primacy of cultural markers of\ndifference as `an imploded, narcissistic obsession with the minutiae of ethnic-\nity', although he provides no empirical evidence for his claim that British\nracism has been, and continues to be, primarily a dualistic black/white\nphenomenon. Modood, by contrast, cites evidence from documentaries and\nacademic studies to support his contention that culture now matters as much\nas colour, to the disadvantage of Asians, who are victims of a `double racism'\n(Modood 2005: 33\u00ad7) as a result. Two competing predictions can therefore be\ndrawn from this debate about the nature of British racism:\nHypothesis 3 (a) If racial prejudice is primarily a matter of `blackness', there\nshould be little difference in the level of prejudice directed at black and Asian\nminorities.\n(b) If racial prejudice also has a significant cultural component,white Britons\nwill express more prejudice against Asians than blacks.\nSocial structural factors: education, class and gender\nThree individual characteristics may also play an important role in attitudes\ntowards minorities: education, social class and gender. Previous work has\nsuggested that education, particularly higher education, encourages tolerant\nattitudes on a range of dimensions (Sullivan, Piereson and Marcus 1982;\nSullivan and Transue 1999). More educated respondents are less likely to\nperceive ethnic minorities as threatening and they are also less likely to hold\nauthoritarian values associated with racial prejudice (Hello, Scheepers and\nSleegers 2006). Educated respondents also pay more attention to the views\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nof political and media elites (Zaller 1992) and are therefore more likely to\nadopt the elite norm against racial prejudice. As a result, prejudice levels are\nlikely to be lower among the highly educated. The second half of the twen-\ntieth century saw large increases in spending on education in Britain.\nYounger Britons are therefore much better qualified than their parents and\ngrandparents, which may contribute to generational declines in prejudice.\nEthnic minority immigrants to Britain have tended to concentrate in lower\nstatus manual occupations. This is the result of the lower English language\nproficiency and qualification levels of black and Asian immigrants, and the\nprejudices of some British employers. If the perception that Britain's minori-\nties are an economic threat is an important source of hostility towards\nminority groups (Bobo 1983) then such hostility is likely to be concentrated\nin the lower social classes, with whom ethnic minorities have in the past\ncompeted most directly for jobs and government welfare assistance. Hostility\nmay also be elevated among those who are directly dependent on govern-\nment assistance, such as the unemployed and those living in council housing,\nwho may also be concerned about competition for these resources from\nminority groups.\nThere may also be a gender gap in racial prejudice. Some recent studies of\nAmerican racial prejudice have found higher levels of hostility to ethnic\nminorities among men (Kuklinski, Cobb and Gilens 1997; Johnson and Marini\n1998). Studies of the European radical right have also suggested that men are\nover-represented among the support base for such parties, which focus promi-\nnently on mobilizing xenophobic hostility to immigrants (Lubbers, Gijsberts\neffect could be the result of gender differences in socialized values: women are\nsocialized to be more `other oriented' than men.As a result they place greater\nvalue on cooperation, interpersonal relationships and providing assistance to\nthose in difficulty \u00ad values which encourage more open and tolerant views\ntowards outgroups. This gender difference in racial attitudes has never been\nquantitatively examined in a British context, but the socialized gender roles of\nwomen and men are similar in Britain to those inAmerica,so we should expect\nthe effect to work similarly.\nHypothesis 4: (a) Prejudice levels will be lower among the highly qualified.\n(b) The rapid rise in qualification levels between generations will contribute\nto generational declines in prejudice\nHypothesis 5: Racial prejudice will be higher among those from lower status\nmanual occupations, those who are unemployed and those living in council\nhousing as they will perceive these groups as competitors for jobs and gov-\nernment assistance.\nHypothesis 6: Racial prejudice will be higher among men than among\nwomen.\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 615\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nData and methods\nThe data employed in this analysis comes from the British Social Attitudes\n(BSA) surveys, a series of national surveys which have been carried out in\nmost years since 1983.5 The surveys used in this analysis were conducted\ntion and ethnic minorities was repeated seven times. This analysis focuses on\ntwo items dealing with how comfortable respondents feel about social contact\nwith ethnic minorities. They are worded as follows:\nEthnic minority boss:\n(a) Do you think most white people in Britain would mind or not mind if a\nsuitably qualified person of black or West Indian/Asian origin were\nappointed as their boss? (If mind) A lot or a little?\n(b) And you personally? Would you mind or not mind? (If mind) A lot or\na little?\nEthnic minority spouse:\n(a) Do you think that most white people in Britain would mind or not mind\nif one of their close relatives were to marry a person of black or West\nIndian/Asian6 origin? (If mind) A lot or a little?\n(b) And you personally? Would you mind or not mind? (If mind) A lot or\na little?\nThe samples were randomly split so that half of white respondents were asked\nabout their views on blacks/West Indians and half were asked about Asians.\nThese racial categories \u00ad `black' and `Asian' \u00ad are rather crude and obscure a\ngreat deal of potentially significant differences, for example between African\nand Caribbean blacks, and between Muslim and Hindu Asians. Unfortunately,\nBritish surveys have not regularly employed detailed ethnic categorizations,\nso data are not available on attitudes towards these more disaggregated\nminorities.The black and Asian categories, while crude, still allow us to broadly\ngauge levels of hostility to racially distinct minorities, and to test Modood's\n`double disadvantage' hypothesis.\nThese two social distance items are chosen for three reasons. Firstly, they\nhave been asked repeatedly over a 13 year run of data, allowing more detailed\nanalysis of the trends and distribution of racial attitudes than has hitherto been\nundertaken. The only other racial prejudice measure available over a long\nperiod in Britain is a question asking respondents to rate their own prejudice,\nwhich was employed in two studies examining white racial attitudes (Evans\nseriously flawed. While respondents who consider themselves prejudiced do\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nhold distinctly more hostile attitudes towards ethnic minorities on a range of\nother items, the conception of prejudice applied by respondents varies system-\natically with education and cohort: older cohorts and less educated respon-\ndents express much greater hostility to ethnic minorities on other measures\nwhile still rating themselves unprejudiced.7 As this analysis is concerned with\nthe change in attitudes over generations, and the effects of education on\nexpressed racial prejudice, these differences in the interpretation render this\nitem an unsuitable indicator.\nThe social distance measures employed here have a high level of theoretical\nand empirical validity. Such items provide concrete examples of the kind of\nirrational hostility towards a group that is considered to be the essence of\nprejudice, but are also rooted in social situations that are easy for respondents\nto comprehend. American studies have employed social distance items to\nmeasure trends and patterns of racial prejudice for over seventy years and\nhave confirmed that these measures correlate closely with other racial atti-\ntudes and measures of racial prejudice (Bogardus 1967; Firebaugh and Davis\nEvidence from the BSA surveys themselves provides further confirmation\nthat these measures are valid and substantively consequential. As Table I\nshows, those who say they dislike social contact with ethnic minorities in the\nworkplace or the family are significantly less supportive of a range of policies\nbenefiting ethnic minorities. These differences in attitudes are largest when\nthe policies in question involve special provision of resources to minority\ngroups, such as aid to ethnic minority immigrants or special lessons for their\nchildren.\nThe analysis begins by examining the trends in these social distance items\nover time and the cohort structure of the attitudes, to test for generational\ndifferences.Attitudes towards black and Asian minority groups are compared,\nto see if there is any evidence of greater aversion to social contact with Asians\nas a result of their greater cultural distinctiveness.\nThe second section conducts multivariate statistical analysis of the social\ndistance items. The third section introduces interaction terms to the models,\nallowing the pattern of generational change in attitudes to vary across social\ngroups.\nThe responses to the social distance questions fall into three categories \u00ad\n`mind a lot',`mind a little', and `don't mind at all'.Although these answers have\na clear ordering, it is not obvious that the categories are equally distant from\neach other. As such, linear regression of the responses is inappropriate. The\ndata are instead analysed using ordered logistic regression (Hoffman 2004:\nch.4; Long and Freese 2006: ch.5). Ordered logistic regression assumes that the\ndifferent response categories form part of a continuous unobserved variable,in\nthis case `aversion to social contact'. When the underlying level of hostility\npasses a threshold, individuals' observed responses change from one category\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 617\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nTable I: Measures of social distance and attitudes on other ethnic minority issues\nSocial distance (spouse) Social distance (boss)\nMind\na lot\nMind\na little\nDon't\nmind\nDiff Mind\na lot\nMind\na little\nDon't\nmind\nDiff\nEqual opportunities policies\nLevels of immigration\nAssistance for immigrants\nNotes:\n* Support present levels of immigration or favour increase in immigration\n** Support present levels of aid or favour increase in aid\nAll differences are significant (p < 0.05)\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nto another.The ordered logit model estimates these threshold points from the\ndata, and presents them as a series of `cut point' coefficients, representing the\nprobability of a particular category occurring.8 The effects of independent\nvariables are assumed to operate equally on all categories, and are reported as\ncoefficients representing the effect of the independent variable on the likeli-\nhood of any particular category occurring. These coefficients can then be\ncombined with the cut points to estimate the probability of each category\noccurring for each value of an independent variable9. The raw coefficients\ngenerated by ordered logistic regression models are not easy to interpret, so\nthe models are accompanied by tables and charts illustrating the effects of\nparticular variables on the probability of intolerant responses on the social\ndistance items.\nThe analysis examines period effects, the change in attitudes between\nsurvey years and cohort effects, the change in attitudes between generations.\nRespondents' attitudes could also, however, be affected by the ageing\nprocess. Hostility towards outgroups is closely associated with authoritarian\nincrease as people age, particularly after significant life cycle changes such as\nmarriage and having children. Older voters may also be more concerned\nabout perceived threats they associate with ethnic minorities, such as crime\nand terrorism, which may encourage greater hostility. If such age differences\ndo exist, they should be separated from the effects of generational attitude\nchange. Thus the models should ideally include measures of age, period and\ncohort simultaneously.\nThis task is complicated by the `identification problem': age, survey period\nand birth cohort are logically linked, so that the effects of two are always\nneed to be made in order to estimate all three effects. Three different sets of\nrestricted models are estimated to address this problem. Firstly, period and\ncohort effects are estimated with age effects restricted to the `social ageing'\nfactors found significant by Altemeyer in relation to authoritarian values\n(Altemeyer 1995): marital status and the presence of children in the\nhousehold. Secondly, cohort and age effects are estimated with period effects\nrestricted to zero. Thirdly, age and period effects are estimated with cohort\neffects restricted to four wide time bands. The reported effects of age, period\nand cohort were robust across these different specifications, so only the results\nfrom the first specification are presented.\nThe effect of education is tested using dummies for possession of a degree,\nA-levels and GCSEs/O-Levels, with the unqualified as a reference group. Class\nis measured using a 5 category Goldthorpe-Heath classification, with the\nworking class as a reference group. Controls for religious observance are also\nincluded, with dummies for self-identified denomination and regularity of\nchurch attendance. Gender is measured using a dummy for men.\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 619\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nResults\nThe trends in social distance attitudes over the period from 1983\u00ad96 are\nplotted in Figure I. The solid lines indicate the total proportion of respon-\ndents expressing opposition to each form of social contact, while the dashed\nlines show the proportion who express strong opposition. Significant hostility\nto contact with ethnic minority exists in the white British population.\nBetween 10 and 20 per cent of British survey respondents object to an ethnic\nminority boss, and between 30 and 50 per cent object to a close relative\nmarrying someone black or Asian. Around half of these respondents register\nstrong objections.\nAs hypothesized, both measures of racial prejudice decline markedly over\nthe period under examination, particularly in the 1990s. Levels of overall\nopposition to both forms of social contact nearly halve after 1989, with levels\nof strong opposition falling even more steeply.There is little evidence of higher\nprejudice against Asians. Respondents do express higher opposition to\nworking for an Asian employer throughout the series, but the difference in\nattitudes is small. Attitudes to racial inter-marriage are almost identical for\nboth groups in every survey.\nFigure II shows how levels of racial prejudice break down by birth\ncohort, using data from all the survey years combined.10 There are large gen-\nerational differences in prejudice levels, with the proportion of respondents\ngiving discriminatory responses falls steeply between cohorts on all four\nitems. The decline is linear for hostility to a black or Asian employer, but\nnon-linear for attitudes to racial inter-marriage. Hostility to relatives taking\na black or Asian spouse is fairly uniform among the oldest generations, then\nfalls rapidly among cohorts born after the mid-1930s. This pattern of genera-\ntional change suggests prejudice may be a value-type attitude, primarily\ninfluenced by conditions in youth. Generations brought up in an ethnically\nhomogenous Britain express high levels of prejudice, while those who have\ncome up since mass migration began express progressively more tolerant\nattitudes.\nThe generational declines in racial prejudices are very steep. Opposition to\nworking for a black or Asian boss falls by half from 30 per cent in the pre-1920\ncohorts to 15 per cent in the cohorts from the 1970s. Strong opposition falls\nfrom 15 per cent to nearly zero. Opposition to racial intermarriage falls even\nfurther, from over 60 per cent in the oldest cohorts to under 20 per cent in the\nyoungest, with strong opposition falling from 40 to 10 per cent. There is again\nlittle evidence of elevated hostility towards Asians. The only notable diver-\ngence in attitudes actually runs in the other direction: the oldest cohorts\nexpress rather more opposition to working under a black boss and are\nmore likely to strongly oppose white\u00adblack intermarriage than white\u00adAsian\nintermarriage.\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nFigure I: Period trends in social distance\n(a) Attitudes to an ethnic minority boss\nYear\n% Who mind contact\nMind Asian boss total\nMind Asian boss a lot\nMind black boss total\nMind black boss a lot\n(b) Attitudes to an ethnic minority spouse\nYear\n% Mind social contact\nMind Asian spouse total\nMind Asian spouse a lot\nMind black spouse total\nMind black spouse a lot\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 621\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nFigure II: Social distance by cohort\n(a) Attitudes to an ethnic minority boss\nCohort birth year\n% Mind social contact\nMind Asian boss total\nMind Asian boss a lot\nMind black boss total\nMind black boss a lot\n(b) Ethnic minority spouse\nCohort birth year\n% Mind social contact\nMind Asian spouse total\nMind Asian spouse a lot\nMind black spouse total\nMind black spouse a lot\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nMultivariate analysis\nInitial analysis thus suggests a declining trend in prejudice which is being\ndriven by generational change.

The figures employ different scales to make presen-\ntation of the effects as clear as possible.\nThere is a significant period effect in all the models.A sharp shift in attitudes\n10 percentage points lower in the 1990s surveys than in those conducted in the\n1980s.11 There is little evidence that this change is a methodological artefact.\nQuestion wordings, question orderings, and the placement of these questions\nin the overall survey were not changed between the surveys from the 1980s and\n1990s.12 Several factors may be contributing to this sharp decline in racial\nprejudices in the 1990s. The political environment may have become more\ntolerant, as the divisive Margaret Thatcher, who had made several controver-\nby the more conciliatory John Major. The main social development of the\nperiod was a deep economic recession in 1990\u00ad1,which may have increased the\nsalience of economic over social issues in most white respondents' minds. We\nmight also expect that the controversy over the Satanic Verses in 1989 and\nBritain's participation in the first Gulf War, fought against a Muslim nation,\nmay have increased the salience of religious divisions over racial ones\n(Modood 1990).The period change in attitudes is somewhat larger for views of\nblacks than it is for attitudes to Asians, but unfortunately no data are available\non attitudes towards Muslims specifically that might enable closer examination\nof this question.\nWhile prejudice does shift significantly downwards in surveys from the 1990s,\nthe most important predictor of hostility to minorities in all the models is birth\ncohort.13 Younger generations consistently show much less hostility to social\ncontact with black and Asian Britons. This cohort effect is nonlinear for the\nspouse item, with a significant widening of the generation gap in attitudes for\ncohorts born after the 1930s.14 Predicted opposition to racial intermarriage falls\nThe proportion strongly objecting falls from over one third to around one tenth.\nCohort also has the largest impact on attitudes to a black employer, with\nopposition levels falling from over a quarter of the 1910 cohort to under a tenth\nof the 1970 cohort. Generational shifts in attitudes to an Asian employer are\nsmaller, though they remain the second largest effect in the model: opposition\nfalls 7 percentage points between these cohorts,from 20 per cent to 13 per cent.\nThere is little evidence that life cycle changes or ageing processes are\nresponsible for these cohort differences. Social ageing events such as marriage\nand family formation have little impact on prejudice. Only those who are\nsingle show any difference in attitudes, and these effects are only marginally\nsignificant. Models including a continuous age term and a restricted cohort\nterm did not fit the data as well as the reported models. The size, significance\nand robustness of these cohort effects suggest that racial prejudices are indeed\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 625\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nvalue-type attitudes: older generations have adopted the discriminatory views\nabout race which were prevalent when they grew up and retained them despite\ntheir declining legitimacy and social unacceptability.\nThe level and social distribution of prejudices against black and Asian\nBritons are very similar, suggesting that Gilroy and his colleagues may be right\nto argue that visible racial differences are the most important factor driving\nwhite reactions.The models do suggest some differential discrimination among\nthe oldest generations, but in the opposite direction to that expected by\nModood. Britons born in the 1930s or earlier tend to express more hostility\ntowards blacks than Asians on both items, with prejudice against blacks 5 to 10\npercentage points higher than prejudice against Asians. This difference is\nperhaps the result of more hostile stereotypes about the backwardness of\nblack cultures formed in the colonial era. Black prejudice declines more\nrapidly between generations, eliminating this differential discrimination com-\npletely among the post-WWII cohorts.\nAs hypothesized, highly educated individuals express significantly less\nprejudice on all items, with prejudice levels among degree holders between 5\nand 15 percentage points lower than among the unqualified. The rapid rise in\nqualification levels does not, however, account for much of the generational\nshift in attitudes: the cohort effects are little altered by the introduction of\ncontrols for education.There is a significant difference in how racial intermar-\nriage is regarded by degree holders and the uneducated. Those with degrees\nexpress greater opposition to white\u00adblack intermarriage, with opposition\nlevels 8 percentage points higher than to white\u00adAsian intermarriage, while the\nuneducated regard both groups similarly on this item.This difference is due to\nthe greater hostility shown to black\u00adwhite intermarriage by older white degree\nholders and will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.\nContrary to expectations, there is no evidence of elevated hostility to black\nand Asian minorities among the working classes or those dependent on state\nresources. The main effects of class are limited to one group: the salariat\nconsistently express significantly less prejudice than the other social classes.\nThose in salariat occupations are more tolerant of their relatives taking a black\nor Asian spouse, and of working for an Asian employer. Professional workers\nin the salariat have the most secure and high status jobs in the economy,so they\nare perhaps less worried about competition from ethnic minorities who tend to\nbe concentrated in lower status professions. Professional workers are also\nmore likely to work for large multinational firms that operate in and recruit\nfrom many countries. Globally mobile professional workers are more likely to\nhave experience working in different countries, or dealing with foreign col-\nleagues or customers, which may encourage them to develop a more cosmo-\npolitan outlook towards minority groups.\nMen are more hostile to an ethnic minority employer, particularly an Asian\nboss, but no gender difference is found in attitudes towards ethnic minority\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nspouses. However, looking only at the main effects of gender understates the\nimportance of gender divides in racial attitudes, as further analysis reveals\ndiffering patterns of generational attitude change for men and women. Cohort\neffects also depend on education and social class.These interaction effects are\ndiscussed in the next section.\nReligious identity and church attendance also have significant effects on\nsocial distance attitudes.The substantive impact of these variables is relatively\nsmall and so they are not shown in Figure III. Identification with the Church of\nEngland encourages somewhat elevated levels of hostility to minorities, par-\nticularly towards Asians who are predominantly non-Christian. Actually\nattending church, however, has the opposite effect: those who attend once a\nmonth or more have significantly lower social distance on both items. Those\nwho attend church regularly may be internalizing the tolerant norms of Chris-\ntian doctrine, or may at least feel a greater need to appear more tolerant\ntowards minorities in their public attitudes, perhaps due to greater awareness\nof the social norm against racial prejudice.\nInteraction effects: diverging attitudes among the young\nThe second set of models shown in Table III adds interaction effects between\ncohort and social characteristics, enabling the pattern of generational change\nto vary for different social groups.15 These interactions significantly improve\nthe fit of the models, suggesting important variations in the pattern of genera-\ntional change between social groups. The main effect of cohort remains sig-\nnificant in three of the four models, suggesting that a general generational\ndecline in prejudice occurs in these cases. Cohort has no significant main effect\non attitudes towards an Asian boss suggesting no general pattern of genera-\ntional change in attitudes on this item.The main period and cohort effects are\nlarger for attitudes towards blacks. The gender interaction term is also larger\nfor attitudes towards blacks, suggesting more divergent patterns of genera-\ntional change in attitudes towards blacks than in attitudes towards Asians.\nLarger generational shifts are seen among the salariat and women in all four\nmodels. In the ethnic spouse models, significantly larger generational shifts are\nalso found among those with degrees or A-level qualifications.\nThe meaning of these different patterns of change is illustrated in Table IV,\nwhich shows the pattern of generational change in hostility to racial intermar-\nriage for different social groups.16 The generational interactions fall into two\ndifferent patterns. The first is divergence from similar starting points, seen in\nthe education and class interactions. Levels of prejudice start off similarly for\nall groups and then begin to diverge for cohorts born in the 1930s and after\nwho came of age after mass black and Asian immigration to Britain had\ncommenced.This pattern of divergence fits with the idea that the educated and\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 627\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nprivileged are more responsive to the various social pressures encouraging the\nadopting of tolerant views.The generational shift in these groups began earlier\nand has progressed further than among the uneducated and the working\nclasses, though evidence from the youngest cohorts suggests that they too are\nnow adopting more tolerant views of minorities.\nThe interactions between generation and gender follow a different pattern.\nWomen start with higher levels of prejudice which decline rapidly while male\nprejudices barely change at all.As a result, a gender gap is seen in attitudes to\nracial intermarriage among pre-immigration cohorts which is then reversed\namong the youngest cohorts. Female hostility to an Asian spouse declines by\nTable III: Interaction effects\nDislike social contact with\nMinority boss Minority spouse\nAsian Black Asian Black\nEducation (reference: no qualifications)\nClass (reference group: working class)\nGender\nInteraction effects\nEducation\nGender\nClass\nNotes: In model but not shown: economic conflict, religion and lifecycle events variables\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nblack spouse falls by 38 points. Male hostility levels fall by 7 and 13 points\ndifference between growing female tolerance and more persistent male hos-\ntility is just as pronounced in attitudes to an ethnic minority boss.This pattern\nsuggests that women are more responsive to prevalent social norms about\nrace.Women brought up when prejudice was socially acceptable express more\nprejudice than men, while the youngest generations have more rapidly\nadopted a tolerant view of ethnic minorities.\nThese interaction effects show that while racial prejudice is relatively evenly\ndistributed among older Britons, among the young it has remained prevalent\nin some social groups and virtually disappeared in others. This social diver-\ngence can be most clearly illustrated using combined social categories, as is\nshown in Figure IV.This compares levels of prejudice among graduate women\nwith degrees with those of men with no qualifications. These are large social\nTable IV: Interaction effects illustrated: predicted total opposition by gender, education level and\nsocial class\nEthnic minority spouse\nGender\nEducation\nClass\nEthnic minority boss\nGender\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 629\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\ngroups \u00ad women with degrees constitute 5 per cent of the total sample (and 8\nper cent of those born after 1960), men with no qualifications 28 per cent.\nThere is a dramatic difference in the generational structure of the two groups'\nattitudes. Opposition to racial intermarriage among degree holding women\nfalls from over 60 per cent among the oldest cohorts to under 10 per cent\namong the youngest, while unqualified male opposition remains flat at around\n50 per cent for most generations, only beginning to decline among the very\nyoungest cohorts.\nDiscussion\nThe evidence from this analysis suggests that a large and growing segment of\nBritain's white population is at ease with racial diversity. Opposition to contact\nwith black and Asian minorities in both family and workplace was markedly\nshift in white attitudes towards ethnic minorities is the most important driver\nof this trend. Older generations who grew up in an ethnically homogeneous\nBritain before mass immigration began are much more hostile about social\ncontact with minority groups than their children and grandchildren. Racial\nprejudices thus resemble core political and social values (Inglehart 1997; Tilley\n2005): they are strongly structured by generation and seem to be primarily\ninfluenced by the social conditions prevalent during an individual's youth.\nFigure IV: Diverging social groups \u00ad degree holding women and unqualified men\nCohort birth year\n% Who mind\nGraduate woman: Mind Asian spouse\nUnqualified man: Mind Asian spouse\nGraduate woman: Mind black spouse\nUnqualified man: Mind black spouse\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nWhile considerable evidence was found for a decline in discrimination based\non colour, little evidence was found to support the contention that race-based\ndiscrimination is being replaced by new barriers based on perceived cultural\ndifference. British respondents did not express greater hostility towards Asian\nminority groups, despite their greater cultural and religious distinctiveness.\nThere is a larger generational shift in attitudes towards black Britons, but this\nis because they are regarded with greater hostility by older cohorts, not\nbecause they enjoy greater acceptance from the young.While the groups asked\nabout here are rather simplified racial categories, they provide some evidence\nto support the contention from Gilroy and others that racial difference\nremains more salient than cultural difference as a source of prejudice. Further\nresearch is needed to investigate whether this finding is robust when more\ncarefully defined groups, particularly groups defined by religion, are asked\nabout.\nHow does Britain's growing acceptance of ethnic minorities compare with\nattitudes in other rapidly diversifying developed nations? Research examining\ntrends in attitudes to immigrant minorities in Europe has been relatively\nlimited, but recent studies have found significantly lower hostility to immigrant\nminorities among younger cohorts in a range of immigrant receiving West\nEuropean nations (Pettigrew and Meertens 1995; Gijsberts, Hagendoorn and\nScheepers 2004). These findings suggest that the generational shift towards\nmore tolerance of diversity in Britain may be part of a general trend in\ndiversifying European democracies, although research in Holland suggests\nthat deteriorating economic conditions and high immigration rates can halt\nor reverse such shifts (Coenders and Scheepers 1998). More comparative\nresearch is needed to examine the extent of this general trend and how it is\naffected by conditions within individual nations.\nTrends in racial attitudes have been also been extensively researched in\nAmerica, where scholars have also found evidence for a similar generational\nshift in attitudes towards ethnic minorities. While America has been racially\ndiverse since its foundation, black Americans only gained full acceptance to\nthe American political community following the Civil Rights reforms of the\nmid-1960s.As in Britain, white American attitudes towards African Americans\nare strongly influenced by conditions in a respondent's youth, with sustained\ndeclines in many measures of prejudice against blacks among those coming of\nage after the Civil Rights era (Firebaugh and Davis 1989; Kinder and Sanders\n1996). Studies examining social distance from a range of minority groups over\na seventy year period have also found sustained falls in the hostility white\nAmericans express towards social contact with minority groups (Kleg and\nYamamoto 1998). The relative ranking of groups has remained the same over\ntime, but the difference in attitudes between most and least liked groups has\ndeclined as hostility to contact with the least favoured groups has declined\nmost rapidly.\nIs racial prejudice declining in Britain? 631\nBritish Journal of Sociology 59(4) \u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008\nEvidence of persistent discrimination against African Americans despite the\napparent survey evidence of a sharp decline in prejudice in post-Civil Rights\nAmerica has lead some American scholars to question whether the survey\nevidence is capturing a real shift in attitudes. Proponents of `new' or `symbolic'\nprejudice theories have contended that the apparent decline in American\nracial prejudice actually reflects a growing reluctance to express in public\nracial prejudices which are no longer considered socially acceptable, while\nprivate racial prejudices remain widespread and continue to motive discrimi-\nscholars point to evidence from more subtle survey measures which suggest\ncontinuing opposition to providing assistance to African Americans (Gilens\nthat survey respondents express elevated prejudice when they believe they can\ndo so anonymously (Kuklinski, Cobb and Gilens 1997).\nThe `new prejudice' arguments have been intensely debated in America\n(Quillian 2006 provides an excellent summary), but they provide cause for\ncaution in interpreting the declining trend in British prejudice. The social\ndistance items employed here are similar to the `blatant prejudice' measures\nwhich new racism scholars argue no longer accurately capture racial attitudes\nin America.There is therefore a risk that part of the trend seen in this analysis\nactually reflects a generational shift in the social acceptability of admitting to\nracial prejudice. However, we can draw some confidence from the fact that\nrising British acceptance of ethnic minorities is also reflected in the prefer-\nences revealed in the housing and marriage markets: Britain's ethnic minori-\nties are becoming less residentially segregated from the white population,\n(Simpson 2007) and rates of intermarriage between whites and all minority\nWhile the indicators employed may not be perfectly reliable, the shifts in\nattitudes examined here thus seem to reflect a genuine increase in the social\nacceptance of British ethnic minorities. The generational basis to the trend\nmean it is also likely to have continued beyond the end of the survey series\nexamined here, as younger and more tolerant cohorts replace the ageing and\nhighly prejudiced pre-immigration cohorts.18 While prejudice is therefore\nlikely to be less of a problem in the future, it is unlikely to disappear overnight.\nCohort replacement is a slow process, and significant levels of hostility to\nethnic minorities remain even in the youngest cohorts surveyed here. The\ngenerational decline in racial prejudices is also not evenly spread. Genera-\ntional shifts in attitudes have been most rapid among highly educated Britons,\nthose in high status occupations and among women. Younger generations of\nthese groups seem to have been completely socialized into a tolerant set of\n`multicultural' norms, and rarely express any discomfort about social contact\nwith ethnic minorities. By contrast, significant pools of hostility to ethnic\nminorities remain among less qualified, working-class young men. Researchers\n\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2008 British Journal of Sociology 59(4)\nand policymakers interested in understanding and combating prejudice should\nfocus on these groups, and particularly on examining how exactly education\nencourages more tolerant attitudes, and on why British racial prejudice is\nbecoming an increasingly male phenomenon among the young.\nNotes\n1.

The measure they employed asks\nrespondents to rate their own racial preju-\ndice, without providing any explanation\nof `prejudice'. Respondents interpret this\nabstract term in very different ways, render-\ning the measure unreliable.\n3. In America, the demise of the `Jim\nCrow' regime of segregation and black\npolitical disenfranchisement has been\naccompanied by a sharp decrease in racial\nprejudice, in both segregated and integrated\n4.

Full technical details of the British\nSocial Attitudes surveys are available at this\nsite, or in the annually published British\nSocial Attitudes reports.\n6. For both items, the sample is randomly\nsplit and half of the respondents are asked\nabout `blacks or West Indians' and half\nasked about `Asians'.\n7. For example, respondents from older\ncohorts who consider themselves `unpreju-\ndiced' express much higher rates of opposi-\ntion to race relations legislation, ethnic\nminority immigration and assistance to\nethnic minorities than `unprejudiced' people\nin younger cohorts. This pattern suggests a\ngenerational shift in the standards of racial\ntolerance, with younger generations being\nstricter when they rate their own prejudice.\n8. Technically, the log odds of a particular\ncategory occurring, but it is straightforward\nto derive the probability from this figure.\n9. The ordered logit model makes an\nimportant `proportional odds' assumption\nwhich prevents the slopes from varying\nbetween different categories. The validity of\nthis assumption was tested by comparing\nthe results with a multinomial logit model,\nwhich does not assume constant slopes. The\nmodel fit and results were very similar.\n10.

In 1994, three\nquestions were asked about anti-\ndiscrimination legislation rather than one.\nThis may have encouraged respondents to\nthink of discriminatory attitudes towards\nminorities as socially unacceptable, and\nreduced admissions of prejudice. However,\nthe responses in the 1994 survey were not\nsignificantly different from those in 1996,\nwhen only one questions was asked about\nanti-discrimination law.\n13. Cohort is measured using a centred\nyear of birth variable, so the coefficients in\nthe model represent the effect of changing\nthe year of birth by one year.\n14. Analysis of this nonlinearity using a\nnon-parametric smoothed regression (Fox\n2000) suggests attitudes on this item are\nroughly constant among generations born\nbefore 1935, and become continuously more\nliberal among generations born later.\n15. Interactions between gender and\nother social characteristics, and period and\nother social characteristics were also tested\nbut were not found to be significant and\nwere dropped from the final model. Non-\nlinear interactions between the squared\ncohort term and social characteristics were\nalso tested, and found to be insignificant.\n16.
