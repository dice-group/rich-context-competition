We sought to compare age at menarche between adolescent females with T1DM and\nnational data, and to identify factors associated with delayed menarche and menstrual irregularity in T1DM.\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional study and females ages 12- 24 years (n = 228) with at least one menstrual\nperiod were recruited during their outpatient diabetes clinic appointment. The National Health and Nutrition\nResults: Age at menarche was later in adolescent females with T1DM diagnosed prior to menarche (12.81 +/- 0.09\n(n = 43). Average age of menarche in NHANES was 12.27 +/- 0.038 years, which was significantly earlier than\nadolescent females with T1DM prior to menarche (p < 0.0001) and similar to adolescent females diagnosed after\nmenarche (p = 0.77). Older age at menarche was negatively correlated with BMI z-score (r = -0.23 p = 0.0029) but\nyears post menarche, 63 (35%) reported usually or always irregular cycles.\nConclusion: Adolescent females with T1DM had a later onset of menarche than both adolescent females who\ndeveloped T1DM after menarche and NHANES data. Menarche age was negatively associated with BMI z-score, but\nnot A1c. Despite improved treatment in recent decades, menarche delay and high prevalence of menstrual\nirregularity is still observed among adolescent females with T1DM.\nBackground\nThe delay in menstruation in females with type 1 dia-\nbetes (T1DM) was appreciated well before the more\nrecent improvement and advances in diabetes treatment\nintroduced by the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial DCCT [1-3]. As a result of the DCCT trial [4],\nintensive treatment has become the standard of care.\nHowever, little research has been done post DCCT to\nsee the effect of improved glycemic control on menar-\nchal timing and menstrual regularity in adolescent\nfemales with T1DM, and recent data are limited and\noften conflicting. Some studies show that menarche is\nstill delayed [5-9], but others have found no delay [10].\nMost studies have found that there is a delay in the\nage of menarche if the onset of diabetes occurs before\n10 or 11 years of age or near the onset of puberty\n[11-15] and that this delay increases with poor glycemic\ncontrol [16]. However, one study did not find any asso-\nciation between age at menarche and age of onset of\nT1DM [7]. Another study conducted a retrospective\nevaluation of 62 adolescent male and females followed\nlongitudinally from the onset of T1DM until final height\nwas reached and found that pubertal development and\nprogression occurred independent of the age at onset of\nT1DM and glycemic control [17].\nIt is important to better understand the relationship\nbetween T1DM and onset of menarche because men-\nstrual delay can be associated with decreased bone\nAlso, women with T1DM have been reported to have\nearlier natural menopause, fewer pregnancies, more still-\nbirths [9] and a higher frequency of hyperandrogenism\nand polycystic ovarian syndrome [25,26] than women\nwithout diabetes. Furthermore, women with T1DM are\nmore likely to have 21- hydroxylase autoantibodies (21-\n* Correspondence: schweim@ccf.org\nBarbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver,\nThe Children's Hospital Aurora, Colorado, USA\n\u00a9 2011 Schweiger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

We evaluated factors including A1c,\nBMI z-score, presence of 21-OH antibodies, episodes of\nsevere hypoglycemia, and episodes of diabetic ketoacido-\nsis (DKA) since these factors have an impact on diabetes\nmanagement and metabolic outcomes. We sought to\nidentify their potential role in delayed menarche and\nmenstrual irregularity in adolescents with T1D. Addi-\ntionally, since level of regular physical activity can affect\nmenstrual regularity [28], we also assessed level of phy-\nsical activity in study subjects.\nMethods\nSubjects with T1DM were recruited from the Barbara\nDavis Center for Childhood Diabetes (BDC). The recrui-\nter was blinded to the presence or absence of menarche\nprior to approaching the subjects for participation.\nFemales of all ethnicities and ages who had at least one\nmenstrual period and received their care in the pediatric\ndepartment of the BDC were enrolled in the study. Sub-\njects with a preexisting diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroi-\nditis were included if their initial diagnosis was made by\nclose surveillance and if they had a longstanding history\nof being clinically and biochemically euthyroid. Subjects\nwith celiac disease and any other chronic disease in\naddition to TIDM were excluded from the study. A\nyears of age were enrolled in the study between Novem-\nT1DM, complete data on age at menarche and age at\nT1DM diagnosis were available for 228. The age of diag-\nnosis of T1DM was not available in four subjects and\ntwo subjects, both 15 years of age, had not yet started\ntheir menstrual periods. These six subjects were\nexcluded from the analysis. There were 23 subjects with\nstable, treated hypothyroidism included in the analysis.\nCharacteristics of the study participants are shown in\npants had diabetes onset prior to menarche and 43 were\ndiagnosed with T1DM after menarche.\nStudy approval was obtained from the institutional\nreview board at the University of Colorado Denver and\nparticipants provided written informed consent and\nassent, if appropriate, at enrollment.\nThe National Heath and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nused as a population-representative comparative control\nsample of women. The survey is designed to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of the non-institutionalized\ncivilian US population using a complex multi-stage, stra-\ntime period was specifically selected as it is the most\nrecent set of data available and the time period is similar\nto the time of onset of menarche for our subjects.\nNHANES data are available in 2-yr sets. We selected\nthe three latest sets of data in order to have enough\npower to analyze the groups by ethnicity.\nData collection\nThe clinical diabetes type assigned by the health care\nprovider was obtained from the medical records and\nTable 1 Demographics of subjects with T1DM\nParticipants\ndiagnosed with\nT1DM before\nParticipants with\nT1DM diagnosed\nafter menarche\nInsulin dose (units/kg\nbody weight/day)\npercentile for age) (%)\nTotal physical activity\nNumber of days of\nphysical activity over\nlast 7 days that the\nsubject was physically\nactive for at least 60\nminutes per day\nIn a typical week the\nnumber of days that\nthey are physically\nactive for at least 60\nminutes per day\nRace/Ethnicity (%)\nBreast tanner staging\n(%)\nPubic tanner staging\nIrregular menstrual\nperiods (%)\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SE or as % (n)\ncategorized as T1DM if the provider assignment was\ntype 1, type 1a or type 1b diabetes [30]. Height, weight,\nand A1c were measured. A1c was measured on a DCA\n2000 (Bayer Diabetes Care, Tarrytown, NY). The refer-\nence value for healthy persons is 4-6%. Weight was\nmeasured in kg using a Detecto (Webb City, MO) scale.\nHeight was measured in centimeters using a Holtain\nLimited Stadiometer (Crosswell, UK). Physical examina-\ntion including Tanner staging was performed by a\npediatric endocrinologist. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as kg/m2, and BMI z-score was determined\nusing age and sex specific BMI percentiles from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDemographic data, including race and ethnicity, was\ncollected by self-report. Physical activity was obtained\nusing the Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity Screen-\ning Measure (MVPA) and was categorized as the number\nof days subjects had accumulated 60 minutes of MVPA\nduring the past 7 days and for a typical week [31]. Age of\nthe first menstrual period and menstrual cycle pattern\nand length was obtained by self-report using a question-\nnaire adapted from the NHANES reproductive health\nquestionnaire. Questions regarding cycle pattern and\nlength were based on times when the subject was not\ntaking hormone therapy (oral contraceptives, depo pro-\nvera, norplant, etc). Subjects were asked to recall their\nage at the time of their first menstrual period. Probing\nquestions were asked to help the subjects if they had dif-\nficulty remembering the exact age, such as remembering\nthe season, grade or proximity to a birthday [32]. An\nInsulin Record Questionnaire was used to collect insulin\nregimen and dose. Insulin dose was analyzed as average\nunits of insulin used per kilogram of weight per day.\nA retrospective review of the chart was performed to\nobtain the A1c and BMI within 3 months of the age of\nmenarche on the 185 subjects diagnosed with T1DM\nbefore menarche. As an additional measure of glucose\ncontrol and variability, data were also obtained through\nretrospective review of the chart on the number of epi-\nsodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), defined as ph < 7.3\nand serum bicarbonate < 15, and severe hypoglycemia\n(defined as documented blood glucose < 50 mg/dl and\nrequiring assistance of another person or associated with\nloss of consciousness or seizure like activity requiring\ntreatment with glucagon or IV dextrose) within the two\nyears prior to menarche. In addition, 21 OH antibodies\nare routinely measured on all patients with TIDM receiv-\ning their care at BDC and were collected as part of the\nretrospective chart review.\nResults\nStatistical analysis\nAn independent samples t-test was used to test the dif-\nference in age at menarche between study participants\nwho developed T1DM before menarche and those who\ndeveloped T1DM after menarche. Due to the complex\nweights were used in PROC SURVEYMEANS (SAS ver-\nsion 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to obtain sample esti-\nmates and confidence intervals. A one sample Z-test\nwas used to compare the study sample to the NHANES\ndata. An independent samples t-test was used to test the\ndifference in age of menarche between study partici-\npants who had 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies compared\nto those without, and to compare age of menarche\namong study participants with a history of diabetic\nketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia compared to\nthose without. A Chi-square test was used to compare a\nhistory of menstrual irregularity between study partici-\npants with and without a history of DKA, and between\nadolescent females diagnosed with T1DM pre- vs. post-\nmenarche.\nLinear regression analysis was used to examine rela-\ntionships of age at menarche with clinical factors,\nincluding body mass index (BMI) and A1c at the time\nof menarche, and to examine age at menarche between\nstudy participants who developed T1DM before\nmenarche vs. study participants who developed T1DM\nafter menarche, adjusting for age at visit.\nAverage age of menarche in adolescents with T1DM\nCharacteristics of study participants with T1DM are\nshown in Table 1, by diagnosis of T1DM before vs. after\nmenarche. There was no difference in age at visit, A1c,\nBMI, BMI z-score, prevalence of overweight, race/ethni-\ncity, Tanner Stage, or menstrual irregularity between\nthese groups. Adolescent females diagnosed pre-\nmenarche had a longer duration of diabetes and a\nhigher daily insulin dose per kg than the group diag-\nnosed with T1DM after menarche.\nThe overall mean age of menarche among females with\ndeveloped diabetes before menarche had an average age of\nbetes after menarche.

There is conflicting\nevidence as to whether the age at menarche in the gen-\neral population has remained the same [33] or has\ndeclined [34]. The results from this study suggest that,\ndespite improvements and advances in diabetes treat-\nment and insulin regimens, the age of menarche in ado-\nlescent females with premenarchal presentation of\nT1DM continues to be delayed. Further, menstrual irre-\ngularity is common in youth with T1DM, affecting more\nthan a third of the adolescent females studied.\nWe observed a negative correlation between age of\nmenarche and BMI z-score, consistent with other stu-\ndies which have also found that pubertal development\n[6] and menarche [8] tended to occur earlier in young\nwomen with T1DM whose BMI z-score was high than\nin those with a low BMI z-score. While this might sug-\ngest that poor metabolic control predicts later\nmenarche, we found no correlation between age of\nmenarche and A1c at menarche. Alternatively, the rela-\ntionship between BMI z-score and menarche in young\nwomen with T1DM may mirror what has been shown\nin the general population [35].\nTo further explore glycemic control and age of\nmenarche, we looked at episodes of DKA and severe\nhypoglycemia two years prior to starting menarche as\nmeasures of glycemic stability, and found that these fac-\ntors were not associated with menarche delay, again\npointing away from glycemic control as the explanation\nfor delayed menarche.\nSince the delay in menarche among adolescent\nfemales with T1DM has not significantly changed in the\nlast several decades [13,15] despite improvements in dia-\nbetes management, this suggests that perhaps other fac-\ntors besides glycemic control could be contributing to\nthe menarchal delay in adolescents with TIDM. We\nexamined whether the presence of 21 OH autoantibo-\ndies was associated with menarche delay and did not\nfind a significant association, but since only a small\nnumber of subjects had positive 21 OH antibodies we\nare unable to draw any conclusions. To our knowledge\nthere have been no other studies that have looked at the\nassociation of menarchal delay in adolescents with\nT1DM and positive 21-OH autoantibodies. It is possible\nthat the presence of autoantibodies that have been\nlinked to the menstrual cycle disturbances experienced\nin T1DM females [36] and premature ovarian failure in\nnon-diabetic individuals [37-40] could be contributing\nto the delay in menarche. However, since positive 21-\nOH antibodies were not common in our study popula-\ntion, this mechanism is unlikely to explain the menarche\ndelay we observed.\nIt is possible that the significant period of weight loss\n[41] and physiologic stress preceding the diagnosis of\nT1DM could contribute to the delay in menarche. In a\nstudy looking at 928 randomly selected adolescent school-\ngirls aged 12-18 years with malnutrition it was found that\nmenarche and start of puberty were delayed by approxi-\nmately 1.5-2 years compared to a US reference population\n[42]. It is also known that chronic medical diseases other\nthan TIDM, such as sickle cell disease [43] are associated\nwith menarchal delay. Thus, it's possible that the initial\nweight loss period prior to diagnosis of T1DM, as well as\nthe presence of chronically abnormal metabolism asso-\nciated with T1DM could contribute to menarchal delay.\nApproximately one third of young women with T1DM\nof reproductive age will suffer some form of menstrual\ndysfunction [44] and our results are consistent with this\nfinding. In contrast, reported rates of menstrual irregu-\nlarity in women without T1DM are 50% less than those\nwith T1DM [15,45]. We found that there was no differ-\nence in age of menarche or A1c at study visit between\nthose who had regular versus irregular menstrual peri-\nods. It is possible that other factors besides glycemic\ncontrol are involved in menstrual regularity in women\nwith T1DM. In a study looking at 53 T1DM girls, Snaj-\nderova found ovarian autoantibodies in 67.9% of the\ngirls and speculated that the presence of these antibo-\ndies and other autoantibodies could somehow be linked\nto the menstrual cycle disturbances experienced in\nT1DM females (36). However, in our study we found\nthat the presence of 21-OH autoantibodies was not\nincreased in subjects with menstrual irregularity (Data\nnot shown). However, even in patients with chronic spe-\ncific organ specific autoimmune disease the presence of\n21 OH antibodies is uncommon [45]. Thus, the young\nage of our study participants and small sample size the\nnumber of subjects with positive 21 OH antibodies were\nlimited, making these results difficult to interpret.\nOthers have speculated that the oligomenorrhea noted\nin T1DM is principally hypothalamic in origin and may\nrepresent intermittent (and perhaps reversible) failure of\nthe GnRH pulse generator [46].\nThere were some limitations to our study. First, the\nparticipants were predominantly of NHW and Hispanic\nrace/ethnicity, and so we were not able to provide reli-\nable estimates of age of menarche in other racial/ethnic\ngroups. Also, we did not have a non-diabetic control\ngroup from our population with whom to compare\nmenstrual irregularity. In addition, there is also the\npotential for recall bias with the use of self reported\nquestionnaires. However, the age of menarche has been\nshown to be reliable by recall, as it is usually a date that\nis well remembered [47]. Because the majority of our\nsubjects were adolescent and relatively close to\nmenarche, their recall may even be more reliable than\nin older women. The small sample size for some groups\nalso limits the interpretation of negative findings, as it is\nlikely that some of these findings could be explained by\nlack of power.\nIn conclusion, despite improved diabetes treatment\nin recent decades, a delay in menarche, although clini-\ncally modest, is still observed among girls with T1DM.\nAdolescent females who developed T1DM before\nmenarche had a later onset of menarche than both\nadolescent females who developed T1DM after\nmenarche and adolescent females those without dia-\nage of menarche was not associated with A1c, even\nwhen comparing those with good control (A1C <7.5%)\nto those with less adequate control. Menstrual irregu-\nlarity was common in our study participants, but was\nnot associated with age of menarche, age of T1DM\ndiagnosis, A1c, current BMI, physical activity or insulin\ndose. There are most likely other factors involved in\nthe timing of menarche and menstrual regularity in\ngirls with TIDM, and more research is needed in this\narea so that the etiology and consequences of delayed\nage at menarche in this population can be better\nunderstood.\nAcknowledgements\n07-08 and Dr. Snell-Bergeon was supported by ADA Takeda Post-Doctoral\nAuthors' contributions\nBoth GJK and JS contributed to the discussion and revisions and edits of the\nmanuscript.
