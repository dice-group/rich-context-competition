The NHANES has been used to monitor the\nuse of dietary supplements since the 1970s. In NHANES I\nwas 28% and 38% among adult males and females, respectively;\nwas 35% for males and 43% among females (ages $ 2 mo) and\nuse increased with advancing age (2). Since 1999, NHANES\ndata have been collected continuously in 2-y cycles.

Detailed information about type, consumption\nfrequency, duration, and amount taken is also collected for each reported\ndietary supplement use. Dietary supplement use was also examined in 3\nmajor classes: multi-vitamin, multi-mineral (MVMM),5 botanicals, and\namino acids. For MVMM use, we constructed \"use\" as a product\ncontaining 3 or more vitamins (DSDCNTV) and 1 or more mineral\ncounts (DSDCNTM) per supplement. Similarly, use of a botanical\ningredient product was determined by the botanical count variable\n(DSDCNTB) and use of an amino acid-containing product was deter-\nmined with the amino acid count variable (DSDCNTA).\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS\n(version 9, SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 9,\nResearch Triangle Institute) software. Sample weights were used to\naccount for differential nonresponse, noncoverage, and to adjust for\nplanned over-sampling of some groups. SE for all statistics of interest\nwere approximated by Taylor Series Linearization. Data were analyzed\nby the age groups specified in the DRI developed by the Food and\nNutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences (8).\nDescriptive data are presented for the population, for adults only, and\nby gender and DRI age group using proc descript in SAS-callable Sudaan.\nFor prevalence rates across age groups, we used Hsu's procedure (9) to\ndetermine (for the population and within gender) which age groups had\nthe highest and lowest value(s) for dietary supplement use (10). Hsu's\nprocedure was employed once to find the largest and once to find the\nsmallest population prevalence(s); P-value was set at 0.025.\nAdults ($20 y) were also analyzed separately from children to\nexamine relationships with BMI, race/ethnicity, and educational attain-\nment. BMI was defined as kg/m2 and the CDC BMI classifications were\nindividuals (BMI , 24.9). Education was divided into 3 groups: less than\nhigh school (HS), HS diploma or equivalent, and those with more than a\nHS education. Three race/ethnic groups are available in the NHANES\ndata: non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-\nAmerican. Group differences for the prevalence of daily supplement use\nwithin BMI, education, and race/ethnic groups were analyzed using a\ncontrast statement in proc descript; significance was set at P # 0.025.\nResults\nDietary supplement use was reported by 49% (44% of males,\n53% of females) of the U.S. population aged 1 y and older (Table\n1). In general, dietary supplement use in all categories increased\nwith age. Most people reported taking only 1 dietary supplement\n(Fig. 1). The majority of users (79%) reported taking them every\nshown). Across the 3 major categories of use, the prevalence of\nMVMM use was highest (33%) followed by use of botanical\nsupplements (14%) and amino acids (4%; data not shown).\nMVMM use was highest among those $ 51 y and was also high\namong males 4\u00ad8 y.

Obese\nindividuals took fewer dietary supplements (48%) than over-\nweight (57%) or normal-weight individuals (56%) (Fig. 2).\nDietary supplement use was different among all education levels,\nwith the highest use in those with more than a HS education\n(61%) and lowest use in those with less than a HS education\n(37%).

Similar to\nother studies, overweight and obese individuals were less likely\nto use dietary supplements, those with higher educational\nattainments were more likely to use dietary supplements, and\nNHW were more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to\nuse dietary supplements (11,12). Picciano et al. (6) reported\n32% dietary supplement use in children from birth to 18 y in\nold children (49%). Our results show that \"any\" dietary\nAmong both adults and children, MVMM were the most\ncommonly reported dietary supplement, consistent with results\nfrom previous studies (5,6,11,12). However, the definitions and\ncategorization of MVMM dietary supplements are not stan-\ndardized (13). This lack of standardization makes it difficult to\ncompare prevalence estimates between populations and even\nwithin populations. Radimer et al. (5) defined a MVMM as\ncontaining 3 or more vitamins with or without minerals; 35% of\nadults reported use of a MVMM by this definition in 1999\u00ad\n2000. In the present analysis, we define a MVMM as containing\n3 or more vitamins but required at least 1 mineral to be present\nto call it a multimineral; 33% of the U.S. population reported\nuse of a MVMM by this definition. For comparison, we analyzed\nTABLE 3 Prevalence of mineral-containing dietary supplement use in the past month among the US\npopulation aged $1 y by gender and DRI age groups1,2\nn Age, y Iron Zinc Magnesium Selenium Chromium\nTotal\nMales\nFemales\n1 All values are percentages 6 SE.

Thus, one clear pattern is that MVMM use is high and\nhas increased over time in adults and MVMM use increases with\nage through adulthood.\nPicciano et al.

Data\nfrom the 2007 National Health Interview Survey indicated that\n;18% of adults and ;12% of children used \"nonvitamin,\nnonmineral natural products\" (14). As with MVMM, classifi-\ncation and definitions of nonvitamin, nonmineral, or botanical\ndietary supplement is inconsistent (3). Current efforts at the\nfederal level to initiate a LanguaL classification system for\ndietary supplements are being investigated. LanguaL is an\nautomated method for describing dietary supplements (15\u00ad17);\nthis type of system would harmonize reporting of dietary\nsupplements and allow for cross study comparison on dietary\nsupplement use.\ndietary supplements containing calcium (10), vitamin A (6), or\nfolic acid (18,19). However, for iron-containing dietary supple-\nments, there was a 5 percentage point decrease in 1\u00ad3 and 9\u00ad13 y\nolds, and a 7 percentage point decrease in 4\u00ad8 y olds from\nevaluated). This may be of concern given that toddlers are at\nhigh risk for iron deficiency in the US (20,21).\nThe methods used in NHANES to accurately identify and\nrecord the specific dietary supplements reported by participants\nensures high quality data. Although the dietary supplement data\nare self-reported, 85% of the time, NHANES interviewers saw\nthe dietary supplement bottles and labels that participants\nreported using to verify accuracy. We did not present data for\npregnant females and this information is virtually unknown\n(22). The small sample size of pregnant females in NHANES has\nbeen the primary challenge in ascertaining reliable estimates of\ndietary supplement use in this population subgroup. Calcium,\nvitamin D, and folic acid dietary supplement use has been\nchildren and is therefore not presented in this report (10,18,19).\nIn conclusion, dietary supplements are used by one-half of the\nU.S. population and appears to have increased slightly in adults\ndietary supplement across all age groups. Botanical use is\nreported by ~20% of adults. In children, more than one-third\nreport using supplements containing vitamins B-6, B-12, C, A,\nand E. Dietary supplements may contain nutrients in amounts as\nhigh as or higher than DRI recommendations and can contribute\nsubstantially to total nutrient intake. Without consideration of\nnutrient intakes from dietary supplements, there is a potential to\nmisclassify the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy and excess\nsupplement use in the U.S. population.\n"
