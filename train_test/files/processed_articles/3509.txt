In view of this, this study uses a triple sector approach of the pluralistic health care system as advocated\nby Kleinman to assess care-seeking behaviors of residents in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa District (Ghana). The results of\ncross-tabulation analysis demonstrate that respondents' general care\u00adseeking behavior is different from the type of care\nsought for last illness before the study. Data for the study were obtained from 227 urban and rural respondents in the study\ndistrict in 2013. The findings indicate that factors such as geographic location, health insurance, and perception of the cost of\nprofessional care had a bearing on residents' general care\u00adseeking behavior. However, age, sex, relationship status, economic\nstatus, and proximity to nearest biomedical care service influenced the type of treatment sought for last illness. The approach\nuse of the study demonstrates that self-care remains a general avenue of care for residents, whereas in times of severe illness,\nrespondents often rely on professional biomedical care. The use of professional indigenous care services is generally low due\nto the financial burden associated with its use.\n",

The concept of pluralistic health\nenvironment often differs from studies and research on the\nsubject based on place or location of studies (Amegbor,\n2014). Studies in western industrialized societies often use\nthe concept in reference to the parallel existence of a bio-\nmedical health care system and other forms of natural and\nscientific health care (postmodern scientific health care)\nsuch as chiropractic, naturopathy, homoeopathy, and aroma-\ntherapy (Raffaet\u00e0, 2013; Stevenson, Britten, Barry, Bradley,\noften ignores the indigenous health care system of natives\nsuch the Aboriginal people of North America, Europe, and\nAustralia. Similarly, in most developing countries, especially\nsub-Saharan Africa, the concept of medical/health pluralism\nfrequently refers to the existence of western biomedical ther-\napies, and indigenous healing practices and traditions (Digby\nwhich healing practices constitute a pluralistic health envi-\nronment is confined to professional care therapies. However,\nstudies increasingly point to the predominance of self-care\nand/or home care as the major health care management\noption for most people in both the developed and developing\nworlds (Asenso-Okyere, Anum, Osei-Akoto, & Adukonu,\net al., 2003). Thus, self-care is not given its due diligence as\na vital health care sector, in the discourse on health care sys-\ntems and medical/health pluralism.\nResearch and literature on the phenomenon of medical/\nhealth pluralism in Ghana usually acknowledge two systems\napproach to medical/health pluralism--biomedicine versus\nthe others--shrouds the reality of the health care system of\nmost contemporary societies, as well as treatment-seeking\nbehavior of patients. As indicated earlier, the dual approach\ndownplays the vital role and the predominance of self-care as\na major treatment system in any pluralistic health society\n1Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nP.

M. Amegbor1\n Keywords\ncare-seeking behavior, medical pluralism, self-care, Ghana\n2 SAGE Open\nWhereas some studies have acknowledged and explored the\ncritical role of self-care in treatment-seeking behavior of\npatients in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa, such studies usu-\nally do not emphasize this treatment avenue as part of the\nhealth care structure. In addition, the use of the dual approach\nskews reality about patients' preference and choice of treat-\nment in favor of the alternative and/or traditional medicine\n(Amoah, Sandjo, Bazzo, Leite, & Biavatti, 2014; Anyinam,\n2013). This misrepresentation is largely due to confinement\nof biomedical care to professional and institutional-based\ncare, whereas indigenous/traditional medicine is loosely\napplied care in professional setting and self-care setting. To\ntackle these shortfalls and the conceptual challenges associ-\nated with the use of dual systems approach, this study adopts\na modified version of Kleinman's model of health care sys-\ntem (Kleinman, 1978) to assess treatment-seeking behaviors\nof people in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of Ghana.\nIn view of this, I use a modified version of Kleinman's model\nto assess preference and actual use of professional biomedi-\ncal, professional indigenous, and self-care forms of health\ncare in addressing acute illness in the Asikuma-Odoben-\nBrakwa district of Ghana. Furthermore, I synchronize this\nnew modified model of health care system with the existing\nbehavioral model of access and use of health care services to\nenhance the discourse and knowledge on exiting studies.\nThe remainder of the study is five substantive sections.\nThe section \"A Triple-Systems Model Approach to Medical/\nHealth Pluralism in Ghana\" covers the adopted pluralistic\nhealth system models and the behavioral model of access to\nhealth care. It further discusses the logic in blending the two\nmodels into a new model of access and use of health care\nservices with a pluralistic outlook. The section \"Study\nContext\" gives the context of the study area and rational for\nchoosing it. The section \"Method and Data Analysis\"\nexplains the methods of data collections, techniques of sam-\npling, measures of study variables, and statistical analyses\nused. The section \"Results\" presents a summary of the results\nof the descriptive, bivariate (cross-tabulation), and the multi-\nnomial logistic regression models generated from the study\ndata. The section \"Discussion\" critical discusses the findings\nin relation to the conceptual framework and existing litera-\nture on the subject. It further delves into the limitations of the\nstudy. The \"Conclusion\" section discusses the implication of\nthe study and the model for future research and discourse on\nhealth-seeking behavior in pluralistic health environment\nA Triple-Systems Model Approach to\nMedical/Health Pluralism in Ghana\nThe Ghana health care system such as many contemporary\nsystems of care is usually described as pluralistic in practice\nwhole, the health care system is characterized by a diversity\nof health knowledge, beliefs, and practices. Ghanaians use a\nplethora of cures and remedies to treat and meet their every-\nNonetheless, these remedies for treating acute illnesses and\ncomplex health conditions are drawn from two main medical\ntraditions: biomedical and traditional (indigenous). Whereas\nthe former system of care was introduced into the country\nthrough Christian missionary activities and colonialism, the\nlatter is embedded in the socioculture orientation of Ghanaian\n1981). Researchers are often been intrigued by the parallel\ntraditions of these medical systems, yet their integration by\npatients in addressing health problems (Aikins, 2003;\nSato, 2012b). The phenomenon is termed as \"healer shop-\nerature exists on the predominant use of the indigenous\nmedicalsystemanditsremedies(Albertyn,Berg,Numanoglu,\nTwumasi, 1979). However, the biomedical health care sys-\ntem has a monopolistic hold as the official and legally sanc-\ntioned medical system in Ghana and many other sub-Saharan\nReports estimate that more than 60% to 80% of Ghanaians\nand residents of other sub-Saharan Africa countries use\nindigenous medical remedies in meeting their everyday\nhealth care needs (McFarlane, 2015; Thorsen & Pouliot,\nthat access to biomedical health care remains elusive to many\npatients, especially the poor and rural dwellers in Ghana and\nthe subregion (Aikins & Marks, 2007; Helmchen & Lo\nSasso, 2010; Powell-Jackson, Hanson, Whitty, & Ansah,\n2014). Scholars and researchers criticize the structure of bio-\nmedical care, and opine its inability to reach the mass is due\nto social distance, economic and financial constraints, and\nthe uneven distribution of health and medical resources in\nthis part of the world (Haddad, Makin, Pattinson, & Forsyth,\nand early 1990s observed a drastic fall in the use of biomedi-\ncal care among Ghanaians due to the introduction of user\nfees during the structural adjustment era (Anyinam, 1994;\nInterestingly, this period coincided with global acknowledg-\nment of indigenous medical practices and their role in pro-\nmoting access primary health care, as well as, improving\noverall health (Gilbert & Gilbert, 2004; Green & Makhubu,\nthis period, Ghana passed several decrees and laws aimed at\nregulating and ensuring the safety of indigenous medical\npractices (Romero-Daza, 2002). These legislations, as well\nas efforts to integrate the indigenous healing system into the\nnational health care system, contributed to the transforma-\ntions of the indigenous medical practices (Anyinam, 1987b;\nRomero-Daza, 2002). Hitherto, the indigenous medical prac-\ntices were usually noncommercial communal-based healing\nsystems, and hence were described as affordable, culturally\nacceptable, and physically close to it users (Ae-Ngibise\n2000). For instance, some studies assert that in some com-\nmunities, money or paying for health destroys the potency of\npolicies and licensing of indigenous medical practitioners\ncoupled with direct out-of-pocket payment for biomedical\ncare provided an ideal incentive for professionalization of\nhealers through setting of standards (Janes, 1999). The end\nresult was the commodification of some aspects of the indig-\nenous healing practices, particularly herbal and plant medi-\nThe commodification of indigenous medical care systems\ncreated a professional body of healers whose activities are\nhighly formal and commercially oriented. Thus, the current\nindigenous medical care system is not as that purported by\nand Twumasi (1975). In addition, certain key policies such as\nthe introduction of a national risk-pooling health insurance\nscheme and community health posts (CHPs) in deprived\nrural areas have changed the landscape of access to biomedi-\nJehu-Appiah et al., 2011). For instance, the National Health\nInsurance Scheme (NHIS) aims to mitigate direct out-of-\npocket payment for biomedical health care, thus reducing the\nfinancial burden and constraints of Ghanaians especially the\npoor and vulnerable (Gobah & Zhang, 2011; Witter &\nGarshong, 2009). Likewise, the introduction of community-\nbased health planning and services (CHPS) seeks to reduce\ngeographical distance between people in deprived communi-\nties and biomedical care services, as well as, foster an inclu-\nsive program of community-based health services (Akazili,\nGarshong, Aikins, Gyapong, & McIntyre, 2012; Fenny,\nAsante, Enemark, & Hansen, 2015; Kuuire, Bisung,\nRishworth, Dixon, & Luginaah, 2015). The CHPS health\ncenters in these deprived communities are crucial for pri-\nmary health care needs while district- and regional-based\nhospitals and clinics provide secondary services to residents\nin times of urgent need (Fenny et al., 2015; Tawiah et al.,\n2016). Studies have explored how these transformations are\nimproving or affecting access to health care, albeit this has\nnot been done as a pluralistic health system perspective. The\ncontinued use of a dual health care systems approach to ana-\nlyze treatment-seeking behaviors of Ghanaians (J\u00f8rgensen,\ncare systems approach (either biomedical or indigenous care;\nGyasi, Mensah, & Siaw, 2015), shrouds the current reality of\nthe health scape in Ghana.\nTo mitigate these challenges while acknowledging the\ntransformations that have characterized both the biomedical\nand indigenous health care systems in Ghana, this study\nadopts a modified version of Kleinman's (1978) model of\nhealth care systems in a pluralistic society. In his model,\nKleinman argues that the health care system in a pluralistic\nenvironment comprises of three overlapping parts: the popu-\nlar, the professional, and the folk sectors (Kleinman, 1978;\nStevenson et al., 2003). The popular sector refers to informal\ncare and treatment in the family or home context, including\nsocial network and community activities (Kleinman, 1978).\nThe professional sector comprises professional healers in the\nscientific (biomedical) and indigenous healing traditions,\nwhile the folk sector is a nonprofessional healing specialist\noften classified into secular and sacred groups (Kleinman,\n1978). In his work, he acknowledges those studies that over-\nemphasize the folk sector while playing down the popular\nsector. This assertion highlights the neglect of the popular\nsector in pluralistic health care system discourse. Although\nthis model is more than three decades old, compared with the\ndual model (posited by Good, Hunter, Katz, & Katz, 1979, &\nTwumasi, 1979), it accurately and adequately reflects the\ncurrent Ghanaian health care system.\nIn this study's model (Figure 1), the popular sector is con-\nceptualized as the self-care sector of the Ghanaian health care\nsystem. Like Kleinman's popular sector, the self-care is a\nnonspecialist popular arena of the Ghanaian health care sys-\ntem, where disease and illness are first identified, defined,\nand decision on treatments is made. The use of self-medica-\ntion or self-treatment as the first health care option for patients\nis not only peculiar to Ghanaians or residents of sub-Saharan\nFigure 1. Study's conceptual framework.\n4 SAGE Open\nAfrica (SSA) (Bussing, Koro-Ljungberg, Williamson, Gary,\nStevenson et al., 2003). A large volume of literature points to\nthe large proportion of patient's in western industrialized\nnations and other parts of the global south who depend on this\nsector for their basic health care need (Paterson et al., 2012;\nStevenson et al., 2003). In Ghana, studies indicate that a large\nsection of the Ghanaian population heavily rely on this form\nof treatment for common illness such as malaria, fever, pains,\nand aches. The treatment of diseases and illness in this sector\ninvolves the use remedies, drugs, and treatment resources\nfrom both the biomedical and indigenous medical systems\n2006). Existing literature on health-seeking behavior in\nGhana and other parts of SSA reports the use of biomedical\ndrugs for self-medication, especially pain killers purchased\nfrom \"chemical/drug stores\" (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998;\net al., 2007; Goodman, Kachur, Abdulla, Bloland, & Mills,\na recent study by Febir et al. (2016) reveals that members in\nthe study community purchased drugs they deemed appropri-\nate from drug stores for their perceived health condition or\nalternatively relied on the advice of the vendor. The study\nsimilarly noticed the use of herbal preparation or left over\npharmaceutical drugs from previous illness for treatment.\nFurthermore, the study's model distinguishes between\nprofessional care in a biomedical care and indigenous care\nsettings. This distinction is appropriate given the health\ncare system in Ghana has not formally integrated healers\nfrom biomedical and indigenous health care system. The\nsystem of integration in Ghana is what Stepan (1983) terms\nthe tolerate system. This system of integration gives legal\nrecognition to scientific-based indigenous medical prac-\ntices or remedies such as herbal medicine, while the nonsci-\nentific aspects are tolerated by the law. However, the\nChinese health care system, which was the context of\nKleinman's study, has a formal integration of traditional\nChinese medicine and biomedical treatment--that is an\ninclusive system of pluralistic health care integration\nbiomedical health care sector in this model refers to the\nofficial legally backed health care system in Ghana. Care\nand treatment in this sector are provided by professionals\nsuch as physicians, nurses, midwives, and surgeons who\nare trained in formal education systems. In addition, care\nand treatment are provided in hospitals, clinics, or CHPs\n(Fenny et al., 2015). The professional indigenous care sec-\ntor as used in this model refers to both licensed and com-\nmunally recognized indigenous healers including faith\nhealers whose activities are generally commercially ori-\nented. As noted earlier, although some indigenous healers\nand their practices are licensed and recognized by law, they\nare not part of the formal health care structure, and hence\ntheir separation from biomedical professionals.\nIn furthering current understanding on care-seeking\nbehaviors in a pluralistic health environment, the study syn-\nchronizes the triple systems approach of Kleinman and\nBuor's behavioral model of health care access and utiliza-\ntion. Buor's (2003) behavioral model of health care utiliza-\ntion (Buor, 2003) is an improvement ofAndersen's behavioral\nmodel. Andersen's model generally recognizes three group\nfactors (predisposing, enabling, and need) that influence\npatient's access and use of health service (Aday & Andersen,\ntors, Buor's model incorporates spatial characteristics, pro-\nvider characteristics, and restrictive factors (combination of\ngovernment policy that determines service, location, and dis-\ntance of coverage) to the list of factors that influence and\nopines that the use of health care services is dependent on\nbroad socioeconomic, spatial, health, and provider character-\nistics operating in an organized user environment (Buor,\n2003). The model used in this study does not exhaustively\ninclude all factors identified by Andersen and Buor as influ-\nences of patient's health-seeking behavior. Nevertheless, the\nmodel includes key geographical, sociodemographic, eco-\nnomic, and restrictive factors (health financing and cost of\ncare).\nStudy Context\nThe study district, Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa, is located in\nthe north-central portion of the Central Region of Ghana.\nWest. The district lies in the moist semideciduous rainforest\nvegetation cover of Ghana; hence, agriculture is the predom-\ninant occupation. It is currently estimated that agriculture\nemploys for 65% of the district's labor force (Ghana\nStatistical Service [GSS], 2014a). In addition, about 52% of\nthe population engaged in other economic activities engage\nin agriculture as a secondary occupation (GSS, 2014a). The\nrural Akan communities, household units in the district are\nstill traditional; that is, extended family members often live\nin the same housing units (popularly termed compound\nhouses). Individual family dwelling or nuclear family house-\nhold systems account for a third (33.4%) of the total house-\nhold number in the district (GSS, 2014a). In addition, there\nare more females per household than males.\nThe district is characterized as the most deprived district in\nthe Central Region according to the 2006 Ghana Health Service\nregional report (Ghana Health Service, 2007). Current national\nand regional public health policy planning coupled with the\ndistribution of health care facilities in Ghana are largely urban\nbiased and hence neglect or do not favor most rural communi-\nties including Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district. The entire\ndistrict is served by one hospital, two clinics, and 10 CHPs.\nThese facilities are manned by nine medical officers, six medi-\ncal assistants, with the help of 23 midwives, 18 staffed nurses,\n12 enrolled nurses (student nurses), and eight public health\nnurses. Furthermore, the main hospital--Our Lady of Grace\nHospital--also serves surrounding communities and districts,\nwhich places an undue burden on the limited human resources\nin the facility, resulting in long waiting hours for most patients\n(Amegbor, 2014). For instance, the ophthalmology clinic in the\ndistrict hospital (Our Lady of Grace) is the main eye care facil-\nity serving the district and more than five surrounding and\nnearby districts such as Assin North and South districts, Agona\nEast and West districts, Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam district, and\nthe Gomoa districts (Abokyi, Koffuor, Abu, Kyei, & Abraham,\nCoupled with these health care provision challenges, the\ndistrict has one of the highest major population growth indi-\ncators as well as mortality cases in the region (GSS, 2014b).\nFor instance, the total fertility rate is 4.68 (the highest in the\nregion), whereas deaths in household and crude death rates\ntion, borehole, pump, and tube well constitute major sources\nof drinking water (37.8%), with an additional estimated\n18.2% of households resorting to rivers and streams for their\nwater consumption supply (GSS, 2014a). These health and\ndevelopment challenges make the district an ideal location to\nassess health care usage behavior in a pluralistic framework\nthat incorporates self-care/home-care (nonprofessional\nadministered care).\nMethod and Data Analysis\nThe primary data used in this study are from a cross-sectional\nsurvey conducted in the Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of\nGhana between June and July 2013. The survey was con-\nducted in relation to an MPhil thesis on health-seeking\nbehavior in a pluralistic health care environment. The survey\nsolicited the views and responses of 227 respondents in three\ncommunities--Asikuma, Bedum, and Fosuansa--in the dis-\ntrict. These communities were selected through a cluster area\nand lottery sampling techniques. Recognizing intraregional\ndifferences in the study district in terms of population size\nand social amenities allocations, that is, the degree of urban-\nity, I grouped the communities in the district into three settle-\nment categories--urban areas, semiurban or semiurban\nareas, and rural areas. The list of the communities in the dis-\ntrict was obtained from the district assembly planning office,\nand the help of the planning officer was sought in determin-\ning which communities fit the set categories based on the\ndistrict planning agenda. This was also complemented with\nthe criteria for rural\u00adurban classification used by GSS--pop-\nulation size and predominant occupation. Thus, communities\nwith a population size of 10,000 or more were placed in an\nurban category, while those with a population of 6,000 and\nbelow were placed in the rural category. I proceeded with\nusing lottery sampling technique to draw one potential data\ncollection site from the urban category (there were only three\ncommunities in this category), and two potential data collec-\ntion sites from the rural category. The target population for\nthe study was all persons aged 18 years or above in the three\nselected communities--Asikuma (urban community), and\nBedum and Fosuansa (rural communities). In each cluster, an\nadult aged 18 or older in a randomly selected household or\nworkplace was sampled to answer a face-to-face survey\nadministered.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the\nDepartment of Sociology and Human Geography, University\nof Oslo, and the supervisor for the MPhil project. With the\nhelp of the district coordinator and the district planning offi-\ncer, a daylong training session on the survey administration\nand research ethics was conducted for the two research assis-\ntants on the premises of the district assembly office. Data\ngathering at each site was done concurrently between me and\none research assistant to ensure adherence to ethical stan-\ndards and sampling techniques. In the data collection site, a\nhousehold was randomly selected and an adult aged 18 years\nor above was sampled for a face-to-face survey administra-\ntion. In Asikuma, household sampling was interlaced with\noffices and trading posts, given the administrative function\nof the location as the district capital and the major market\nhub. That is, some potential respondents for the survey on\nthis site were mostly likely to be in their offices or trading\nsites during the time of administering the survey. The pur-\npose of the survey was explained to each respondent, and\ntheir right to withdraw from the survey (including any infor-\nmation divulged) before, during, and after the survey was\nmade known to them.\nMeasures\nThe focus of this study was on the health-seeking behavior\nof respondents in a pluralistic health care environment,\nmodeling self-care or home-care as a health care alterna-\ntive. The search for respondents' health-seeking behavior\nwas not confined to last illness, as a health care option\nused for a recent episode of illness may not be a true reflec-\ntion of normal health care\u00adseeking behavior. Thus, respon-\ndents were asked to identify the predominant form of care\nthey use in addressing their health care needs, as well as,\nthe treatment used for last illness. The former allows for an\nassessment of the general health care\u00adseeking behavior of\nthe respondent, whereas the latter assesses recent health\ncare\u00adseeking behavior, which may or may not be similar to\nthe general behavior. The dependent variables for this\nstudy were obtained from two prime questions: What is the\npreferred or usual choice of treatment for your health care\nneeds? and What type of care was sought for the last epi-\nsode of ailment? Both questions had three response catego-\nries: professional biomedical care, professional indigenous\nmedical care, and self-care. These responses were created\n6 SAGE Open\nfrom an original response list: hospital, clinic, CHP com-\npound, drug store, traditional healer, prayer camp, herbal\nclinic, and self-medication. Care sought in hospitals, clin-\nics, and CHP compounds was coded as professional bio-\nmedical care; care sought from a traditional healer, prayer\ncamps, and herbal clinics was coded as professional indig-\nenous medical care; and care sought by the use of drug\nstore and self-medication was coded as self-care. The term\nprofessional is attached to biomedical and indigenous care\nto distinguish them from the use of biomedical or indige-\nnous remedies in a self-care context. Thus, professional\ncare as used in this study refers to licensed and legally\nsanctioned biomedical and indigenous medical care ser-\nvices. However, in the case of the latter (indigenous medi-\ncal care), the term is loosely applied to embrace\n\"professional care\" provided by faith healers, spiritualists,\nand diviners whose activities may or may not be legally\nsanctioned. These indigenous professional healers charge\npatients for their services either in cash or kind. These\nresponses represent the conceptualized systems of care in\na pluralistic health care environment.\nThe choice of independent variables for this study was\ninformed by an adopted behavioral model of health care\nutilization. This model was adopted due to its acknowl-\nedgment of geographical (spatial setting), socioeconomic,\nand health policy dynamics (such as the distribution of\nhealth resources, health insurance, and cost of services) as\nvital factors that determine the use of health care services.\nThus, basic sociodemographic characteristics, place of\nresidency, perception on distance to nearest professional\ncare facilities, as well as respondents' perceptions of their\neconomic status, and the relative cost of professional care,\nwere used as independent variables. Sociodemographic\nvariables such as age, sex, highest level of education, and\nrelationship status were selected as independent variables\nfor statistical analysis. Economic indicators such as the\ntype of employment and perceived economic status were\nalso used as independent variables. The question on type\nof employment had two categories: formal sector and\ninformal sector. Similarly, respondents' perception of\ntheir economic status had two categories: okay and not\nokay. Respondents were asked about their NHIS status\nand they were to choose either yes (for registered mem-\nber) or no (for nonregistered member). Respondents were\nalso asked about their perception of which professional\ncare was relatively costly based on their personal experi-\nence or that of a close social relation: professional bio-\nmedical care and professional indigenous care. Whereas\nrespondents were not asked for their place of residence,\nthe questionnaires distributed in each sampled data site\n002 signifies a rural location, thus, helping to determine\nwhether the respondent was an urban or a rural dweller.\nData Analysis\nThe study used three levels of statistical analysis--descrip-\ntive, bivariate, and multivariate--to assess the relationship\nbetween general and last illness care\u00adseeking behaviors, and\nrelevant independent variables identified above. The data\nwere analyzed using STATA statistical software (version 13).\nA chi-square test of independence was used to determine the\nassociation between the study's dependent variables and\nindependent variables. The strength of this relationship was\nthen determined using Cramer's V test. Furthermore, a mul-\ntinomial logistic regression model was used to examine the\ninfluence of the selected independent variables on the choice\nand the use of professional biomedical care, professional\nindigenous medical care, or self-care as general care\u00adseeking\nbehavior and last illness care\u00adseeking behavior. This analytic\ntechnique was selected for computing because both depen-\ndent variables and their responses are categorical with no\ninherent order.\nThe first multivariate logistic test (Model 1) used respon-\ndents' general care\u00adseeking behavior as the dependent vari-\nable, whereas the second test (Model 2) used the type of\ntreatment sought for in the last episode of illness as the\ndependent variable. The models report the relative risk ratio\n(RRR) and the standard error.\nResults\nA general summary of the study is presented in Table 1. A sig-\nnificant proportion of the study's respondents were female\nand 66.1%, respectively). In addition, a relatively high propor-\ntion of this study's respondents were either married or in a form\nof a union and had no formal education or only basic education\nemployed in the informal sector (75.8%) and viewed their eco-\nnomic status as being okay (72.7%). In terms of health insur-\nance coverage, a highly significant number (72.7%) of this\nstudy's respondents were registered members of the national\nrisk-pooling insurance scheme (the NHIS). This nation-wide\nhealth insurance scheme is limited to only hospital or biomedi-\ncal based care. Notwithstanding, a sizable proportion of the\nrespondents still viewed professional biomedical care (i.e., care\nsought in established health care facilities) as being costly\n(40.5%). However, the majority (59.5%) were of the view that\nprofessional indigenous care is relatively costlier than biomed-\nical-based care. Furthermore, a relatively higher proportion of\nrespondents surveyed (75.8%) were of the view they were in\nclose proximity to the nearest professional biomedical care ser-\nvices compared with professional indigenous care services\n(55.5%). The result for care-seeking behavior of this study's\nrespondents reveals a sharp contrast between the general health\ncare behavior and the care-seeking behavior for the last episode\nof illness suffered by the respondent. In the case of the former,\na little above half (52.9%) of respondents indicate the use of\nself-care as the general health care behavior. However, in terms\nof the type of care sought for their last illness, most respondents\n(61.2%) indicated seeking professional biomedical-based care\neither in the hospital, the clinic, or from a CHP compound.\nInterestingly, the proportions of respondents using professional\nindigenous care as both general care\u00adseeking behavior and last\nillness care\u00adseeking behavior were significantly low (4.8% and\nFindings of Bivariate Analysis\nIn determining the relationship between respondents' health\ncare\u00adseeking behaviors on one hand and their sociodemo-\ngraphic, economic, geographic, and health financing and\ncost on the other, I compute a series of cross-tabulation tests\n(Table 2). These tests set the premise for the multinomial\nlogistic regression models that follow. A relatively higher\nproportion of respondents in urban and rural areas (55.9% in\nthe urban location and 50.4% in the rural locations) generally\nindicate self-care as their general care\u00adseeking behavior as\ncompared with professional biomedical care and profes-\nsional indigenous care. Interestingly, in the two geographical\nlocations, professional indigenous care as the general care\noption is significantly low (1.0% and 8.0% of urban and rural\nrespondents, respectively). There is a weak statistically sig-\nnificant relationship between respondents'place of residence\n(urban and rural) and the type of treatment they indicate as\ntheir general care\u00adseeking behavior (p < .05, V = .163).

As stated previ-\nously, the results of the cross-tabulation test informed these\nmultinomial regression models. The two models (Table 3)\nstrengthen the bivariate cross-tabulation findings in predict-\ning the health care\u00adseeking behaviors of respondents in dif-\nferent socioeconomic, geographic, and health care cost and\nfinancing. The interpretations of the RRR for the multino-\nmial logistic regression models are in reference to the base\noutcome of using or selecting self-care as the general and last\nillness care\u00adseeking behavior. The first model (Model 1)\nexamines the relationship between general care\u00adseeking\nbehavior and the socioeconomic, geographical, and national\npolicy characteristics. In Model 1, NHIS members as com-\npared with nonmembers were three times more likely to\nselect professional biomedical care as general care\u00adseeking\ntrolling for all other factors. In addition, urban residents as\ncompared with their rural counterparts were less likely to\nselect professional indigenous care as their general care\u00ad\nseeking behavior (RRR = 0.079, p < .1). Residents who were\nof the opinion professional biomedical care was relatively\nexpensive compared with professional indigenous care were\nnearly six times more likely to indicate professional indige-\nnous care as their general care\u00adseeking behavior rather than\nfactors. Overall, the model was statistically significant and\nthe predictor variables used in the model accounts for 25% of\nthe variance in the general care\u00adseeking behavior.\nModel 2 examines the relationship between the type of\ntreatment sought for last illness (last illness care\u00adseeking\nbehavior), and socioeconomic, geographic, and health care\nand financing characteristics. The results of the test show\nthat residents who perceive professional biomedical care\nbeing close, as compared with those who view it as far, are\nnearly three times more likely to have used professional bio-\nmedical care rather than self-care for the last illness they\naddition, residents aged 18 to 50 years (compared with those\naged 51 years and above) are five times more likely to have\nused professional biomedical care rather than self-care for\ncompared with females are almost 63% less likely to have\nused professional biomedical care rather than self-care for\nthe last illness experienced prior to the study (RRR = 0.369,\np < .05). However, individuals in a relationship as compared\nwith those not in a relationship are twice more likely to have\nused professional biomedical care rather than self-care in\ntreating the last illness they experienced prior to this study\n(RRR = 2.022, p < .1).

Whereas resi-\ndents usually tend to self-medicate, most of the residents\nsought care from a professional biomedical care center for\ntheir last illness. The difference in general health\u00adseeking\nbehavior and the type of treatment sought for last illness can\nbe understood from both health and socioeconomic perspec-\ntives. In the case of the former, numerous studies in Ghana\nindicate that patients mainly delay in seeking treatment from\nprofessional healers for their bad health (Ahorlu, Koram,\nAhorlu, De Savigny, & Weiss, 2006; Asenso-Okyere et al.,\nself-care for illness they perceive less chronic; remedies used\nin the self-care context include both biomedical drugs and\ntraditional herbal medicine. For instance, numerous studies\non malaria care\u00adseeking behavior in Ghana indicate that the\npoor and vulnerable usually delay in seeking treatment for\nthis prevalent disease (Ahorlu et al., 2006; Amexo, Tolhurst,\ndelay in seeking professional care results in high mortality\ncases attributed to the disease (Dzator & Asafu-Adjaye,\nand patient's perception on the severity are noted as contrib-\nuting to delay in seeking treatment, cost of care and inability\nto pay for professional health care are the major reasons for\npatients' delay in seeking professional care (Asenso-Okyere\nThe influence of economic and financial factors on resi-\ndents' care\u00adseeking behavior is evident from the findings of\nthis study. Cross-tabulation computation of the study vari-\nables shows that residents with secondary education or higher,\nemployed in the formal sector, and active members of the\nNHIS tend to use professional biomedical care as their gen-\ntively). The inability of the poor and marginally poor to pay\nfor treatment contributes to their delay in seeking cure for\nacute health conditions, hence the use of self-medication\nThe decision to seek professional care is made when the dis-\nease or illness deteriorates (Ansah et al., 2009; Kiwuwa,\nCharles, & Harriet, 2005; Mugisha, Kouyate, Gbangou, &\nSauerborn, 2002) and, even in such situation, they usually\nborrow money or pawn their goods to pay for care (Aikins,\nIn addition, the findings of these studies such as many others\nreveal that policy interventions in the biomedical health care\nsystem such as the NHIS has improved access and use of\nprofessional care in this sector of Ghana's health system\nTawiah et al., 2016). Notwithstanding, registered members of\nthe NHIS still face fiscal burden in their use of biomedical\nservices. The heavy financial burden on registered members\nmainly emanates from payment for prescribed drugs\nTable 3.

Existing stud-\nies on Ghana's NHIS as well as other's in the subregion indi-\ncate that registered members complain about the need to pay\nfor most of their prescription drugs (Abdou Illou, Haddad,\nThis contributes to the significant number (48.5%) of regis-\ntered members who selected self-care as their general care\nbehavior. In view of such challenges, it is acknowledged that\nit is difficult to isolate health insurance as the key factor influ-\nencing the use of biomedical services (Fenny et al., 2015).\nAlthough the indigenous health care system is becoming\nincreasingly commercialized, currently there is no existing\npolicy that relieves its users of the financial burden they face.\nThe NHIS does not cover indigenous medical care; hence,\npatients using this professional system of care pay directly\nfinancial burden may have contributed to the lower propor-\ntions of respondents who indicate its use as a general care\u00ad\nseeking behavior and as care sought for last illness (Table 2).\nLikewise, the financial burden of using professional indige-\nnous medical care may account for the low RRR of residents\nin an urban settlement, indicating this treatment option as\ntheir general care\u00adseeking option compared with self-care\n(RRR = 0.079, p < .1). It is generally recognized that the cost\nof treatment in urban areas tends to be higher than rural areas\n(Romay-Barja et al., 2015). In addition, professional indige-\nnous healers in the rural areas may be less commercially ori-\nented due to high levels of close social relations among rural\nresidents compared with the anonymity of urban life\nview of the heavy financial burdens Ghanaians face using the\nprofessional indigenous health care sector, some researchers\nadvocate for the need to include traditional healers (espe-\ncially licensed or registered healers) as service providers in\nthe country's NHIS (Barimah, 2013). The commodification\nof some aspects of the indigenous health care system through\nprofessionalization of healers (licensing) and regulations has\nsaddled patients and nonpatients with the financial burden\nthat once inhibited a large number of Ghanaians from using\nbiomedical care (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998;Asenso-Okyere\nWhereas self-care or self-medication remains a popular\ntreatment-seeking avenue for general care behavior, the use\nof professional biomedical care for severe or chronic, as well\nas, other acute illness remains popular among residents in the\nstudy district. This finding challenges long-held assertion\nthat biomedical care remains highly unpopular among\nGhanaians and people in sub-Saharan Africa (Ae-Ngibise\nworth noting that other studies have similarly acknowledged\nthe popularity of biomedical remedies and therapeutic drugs\namong younger people (Asenso-Okyere et al., 1998). The\nsecond model (Model 2) of this study confirms this intergen-\nerational gap in the use of biomedical care. The relative risk\nof the young (18-50 years) seeking professional biomedical\ncare for their last illness as compared with self-care is more\n(Table 3). There is the gendered aspect in the use of profes-\nsional biomedical care, as males are less likely than females\ncal care rather than use self-care for the last illness experi-\nenced prior to this study. Likewise, males are less likely to\nhave sought professional indigenous care for the last illness\nStudies by de-Graft Aikins and Sato demonstrate the prefer-\nence for biomedical care in the initial stages of professional\nthe latter's study, the use of indigenous medicine was rela-\ntively low at the first recourse of treatment, while it doubles\nor triples in the second stage (Sato, 2012b). Thus, profes-\nsional biomedical care, contrary to popular belief, is widely\naccepted by Ghanaians. However, patients often seek profes-\nsional indigenous care for diseases and illness that could not\nIn addition, the changing socioeconomic structure of\nGhana influences the use of biomedicine and indigenous\nmedicine. In his study on the role of socioeconomic status on\nthe use of biomedicine and indigenous medicine, Sato\n(2012a) notes that rising income is associated with the\nincreasing use of the former and the decreasing use of the\nlatter (indigenous medicine). From the study's model, the\nrelative risk of using professional biomedical for the last ill-\nness experienced by residents who perceive their economic\nstatus as okay compared with the poor, is less likely by a\nfactor 0.235 (p < .01), all else being equal. This finding is\ncounterintuitive to Sato's assertion. However, factors such as\ntime spent seeking for care and existing social security pro-\ngram for the poor may explain the difference. Individuals\nwho are economically active are less likely to trade off their\neconomic activity for professional care in acute health condi-\ntions (Buor, 2004). In addition, the NHIS provides exemp-\ntions for individuals without adequate financial resources to\npay the premium (Aryeetey et al., 2013; Durairaj et al.,\nnorm of exemption excludes the marginally poor, existing\nsocial intervention programs by international and local civil\nsociety organizations such as International Labour\nOrganisation (ILO) and local nongovernmental organiza-\ntions (NGOs) have helped this category of Ghanaians to pay\nfor the NHIS premium (Durairaj, D'Almeida, & Kirigia,\nfor the relatively high use of professional biomedical care by\nthe residents in the study who perceived their economic sta-\ntus as poor.\nThe effect of distance on patients' treatment-seeking\nbehavior is well noted in geographic and social science\nresearch. Distance as a barrier to access and use of health\ncare services is not only confined to physical proximity but\nalso pertains to the ability to overcome the cost of travel in\nYantzi & Rosenberg, 2008). Studies on Ghana's biomedical\nhealth care system increasingly point to the influence that\ndistance to care facilities and cost of travel exert on the poor\nand rural dwellers in their access biomedical care (J\u00f8rgensen,\nthat patients especially the poor and vulnerable prefer to\ntravel shorter distances for care (Aikins & Marks, 2007;\nLeonard, 2003). It is generally asserted that longer distance\nand cost of travel to biomedical care facilities promote pref-\nerence for indigenous medicine (de Wet & Ngubane, 2014;\nGyasi, Mensah, Adjei, & Agyemang, 2011). The findings of\nthis study similarly indicate that residents' perception on the\nproximity of the nearest biomedical care facility influences\nthe type of care sought for last illness experienced prior to\nthis study. Residents who opined that biomedical services\nwere close were more than twice likely to have sought pro-\nfessional biomedical care rather than self-care for the last ill-\nness they experienced compared with those who viewed such\nservices as far (RRR = 2.776, p < .05). Whereas the influence\nof distance on access and use of biomedical care is widely\nrecognized in studies, its effect on the new professional\nindigenous care system is less known. Nevertheless, this\nstudy can infer from Van Andel, Myren, and Van Onselen\n(2012) that, distance as a barrier to care has a similar effect\non the use of professional indigenous care services. In their\nstudy on Ghana's herbal market, they found out that products\ntransported from long distances were quite expensive (Van\nAndel et al., 2012). There is the need, therefore, to deeply\nand critically examine the effect of distance as geographic\nand economic factors on the use of professional indigenous\nmedical care services given the changes that have character-\nized the indigenous health care system.\nThis study has few conceptual and methodological limita-\ntions which presents avenues for future studies. The first\nlimitation relates to the conceptual model used in statistical\nand analytical discussion. In this present study, respondent's\nhealth need and how it may have influenced their care-seek-\ning behaviors is not captured. Thus, further studies are neces-\nsary to explore the influence of self-rated health status, and\nexistence of chronic illness on last seeking behaviors of\nGhanaians within this pluralistic perspective. In addition,\nrespondents were not asked the severity of the last illness\nexperienced prior to the study; hence it is difficult to assert\nwhether the severity may have contributed to the difference\nin care\u00adseeking behavior (general care seeking and last ill-\nness care\u00adseeking behavior). The second limitation concerns\nthe cross-sectional nature of the study and the small sample\nsize. The former limits the ability of this study to make causal\nrelationship among the study variables. However, this limita-\ntion is overcome by cross-referencing findings of this study\nwith others of similar theme or topic. Finally, the number of\ntotal respondents in this quantitative study was not large\nenough, hence the response categories of the study variables\nwere collapsed to into dichotomous responses. This was\ndone to address the issue of no response or small number of\nresponses for certain categories.\nConclusion\nThis study to the best of my knowledge, is the first to investi-\ngate the treatment seeking behaviors of Ghanaians in a plural-\nistic health system perspective by conceptualizing self-care as\na health care sector in modern Ghanaian health care system.\nThe study argues for the inclusion of self-care or self-medica-\ntion in any pluralistic health system analysis especially in a\nGhanaian and sub-Saharan Africa context, given the transfor-\nmations that have occurred in both the biomedical and indig-\nenous health care systems. The findings of this study show that\nresidents in Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa district of Ghana have\na distinction general care\u00adseeking behavior and last illness\ncare\u00adseeking behavior. Whereas, majority of the resident tend\nto indicate self-care as their general care\u00adseeking behavior, a\nsignificantly high proportion used professional biomedical\nservices for the last illness they experienced prior to this study.\nSelf-care as a predominant avenue of treatment in Ghana has\nbeen acknowledged in a number of studies (Asenso-Okyere\n1989), though not from a pluralistic health systems perspec-\ntive as done in this study.\nThe study further reveals that policy and planning interven-\ntions in the biomedical health care system has improved access\nand use of its services in the study area. The NHIS for example\nwas seen to have influence on the general care\u00adseeking behav-\nior of residents, as members tend to use biomedical care ser-\nvices due to the financial cushion the scheme provides in access\nto services. Similarly, location of CHPs health center in\ndeprived areas has also boost access and use of biomedical care\nservices compared with self-care and professional indigenous\ncare in terms of the type of treatment residents sought for their\nlast illness. The study further demonstrates that the commer-\ncialization and professionalization of the indigenous health\ncare system has significantly introduced economic burdens in it\naccess and use, especially among the poor and urban dwellers.\nIn view of this study opens a pathway for the need critically\nre-examine Ghana's indigenous medical care system and how\ncontemporary transformations are influencing access to ser-\nvices in the professionalized sector. It is my hope that the find-\nings of this study will guide and inform discourse on Ghana's\npluralistic health care systems from a triple sector perspective\nrather than the dual system approach advocated by Good et al.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthor acknowledges the Norwegian Quota Scheme for financial\nsupport for the research.\nReferences\nAbdou Illou, M.
