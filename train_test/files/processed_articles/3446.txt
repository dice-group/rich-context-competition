    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) is a widely used measure of general intelligence (g), both across settings\nand cultures. Due to its lengthy 40-min administration time, several researchers have developed short-form scales, yet these\nforms typically yield a significantly lower reliability. This article describes the creation of an 18-item short form (APM-18)\nand its validation in three samples of Southwestern U.S. university students (total N = 633). The APM-18 shows similar\npsychometric properties to both the previously published 36-item long form and 12-item short form, but retains a reliability\nestimate closer to the original APM. This, plus the shorter administration time (25 min) relative to the complete APM (40-60\nmin), makes it useful for time-constrained or mass-testing situations.\n",

The most recent published version\nis the Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM; Raven,\nRaven, & Court, 1993), which was developed for higher\nability adult populations (i.e., college-level and above). This\ntest is constructed of 36 items of increasing difficulty broken\ninto three 12-item sets; in each item, the examinee is asked to\ncomplete a visual pattern by choosing one of eight possible\nsolutions.\nDue to its nonverbal format, the APM is purported to be a\nculturally fair, unbiased measure of fluid intelligence (Cattell,\nrefer to it, general intelligence (g; Spearman, 1927), and has\nshown itself to be especially useful in situations where English\nis not an individual's primary language. As such, the Standard\nand Advanced Progressive Matrices have been used exten-\nsively in many applied settings in the United States (e.g.,\nthe positive aspects of this test are marred by its lengthy\nadministration time (40-60 min), making it difficult to use in\ntime-constrained multivariate research or classroom settings.\nIn answer to these various limitations, Arthur and Day\nwe call APM-12), with an administration time of 15 min.\nSeveral studies have shown that this 12-item form shows\nacceptable psychometric properties (e.g., Cronbach's alpha,\ntest\u00adretest reliability, convergent validity; see Arthur, Tubre,\nPaul, & Sanchez-Ku, 1999, for review). However, this short\nform shows relatively low and variable internal consistency\n(IC). For example, Cronbach's alphas range from .58 to .66\nfor short form itself to and .72 to .73 for the 12 short-form\nitems extracted from the full 36-item version (Arthur & Day,\nMore recently, Hamel and Schmittmann (2006) have\nargued that the complete 36-item APM can be administered\nas a 20-min speed test. Scores on this speeded form of the\nAPM show strong correlations with scores on slower timed\n(40 min, r = .74) and untimed versions (r = .75) of the APM.\nHowever, these authors failed to report the IC of the Speed\nTest Scale. We also suspect that giving typical adults only 20\nmin to complete 36 very challenging abstract reasoning\nproblems might impose undue stress.\nThe purpose of the current study was to develop a medium-\nform version of the APM that resulted in higher IC than the\n12-item version (APM-12), but shorter administration time\nthan the full 36-item APM (APM-36)--a combination of\n1Kent State University at Ashtabula, OH, USA\n2The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA\n3The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJon A.

Here, we report the development and con-\nstruct validity of this 18-item scale.\nStudy 1: Scale Construction and\nConstruct Validity\nMethod\nfrom three southwestern universities participated in this\nstudy as a partial requirement for experimental course credit.\n=\nMeasures\nThe Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices 18-Item Short\nForm (APM-18).This 18-item short-form version of the\nAPM is printed in a booklet format on 8\u00bd by 11 white\npaper, with each test item printed on a separate page. The\nfirst four pages of the test booklet contain three example\nitems (Practice Items 1, 5, and 9 from APM-36) to explain\nthe task.\nThe 18 actual test items were derived by adding six items\n35 from the 36-item APM based on a set of three decision\nrules, which can be summed up as (a) dividing the APM into\n12, three-item sections based on difficulty; (b) taking the\nitem with the highest item-total correlation for each section;\nand (c) in the case of a tie, including the item that resulted in\nthe largest drop in IC if it was excluded from the full test.\nFollowing these same rules, we added six more items of\nincreasing difficulty--two that were easy (96% and 75% of\nexaminees from the normative sample answered correctly),\ntwo that were moderate (50% and 48% of examinees from\nthe normative sample answered correctly), and two that were\ndifficult (37% and 32% of examinees from the normative\nand 32) were integrated of difficulty to mimic their presenta-\ntion order in the original APM.\nProcedure. The new APM-18 test was given in classroom set-\ntings with several examinees at a time. This was done\nbecause this test was developed as a measure of g that could\nbe used in environments such as classrooms, where there are\ntime limits on research sessions. In one subsample (n = 175),\ntests were given with no time constraints, but with comple-\ntion times recorded, to determine the average time needed\nfor completion. The other two subsamples (n = 232 and n =\n226) were constrained to finish the test within 25 min, with\nno individual completion times recorded.\nAnalyses.All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS\nbivariate correlations were computed using the PROC CORR\nprocedure. Tests for mean differences between sexes were\ncalculated through t test (PROC TTEST) procedures. Hierar-\nchical general linear models (GLMs) were tested using\nResults\nIC estimates were computed by using Cronbach's alpha. The\nIC of the APM-18 scale yielded moderate reliability ( =\n.79). This alpha is lower than normative IC reports for the\nthat of the embedded APM-12 ( = .73). Table 1 shows the\nresults for each of the APM-18 items, with respect to their\nitem-total correlations, item difficulties, and scale  of the\noverall scale if the item is deleted. As seen, deleting any item\nreduces the overall reliability of the scale, suggesting that all\nitems should be retained.\n=\nrange of 18. For the subsample in which completion times\nwere recorded (n = 175), the mean test completion time was\nparticipants took longer than 20 min, but no one took longer\nthan 25 min. In this subsample, there was a significant posi-\ntive relationship between the amount of time it took for par-\nticipants to take the test and their APM-18 score (r = .41, p <\n.001), but there was no relationship between age and APM-\n18 score, or age and time required to complete the test (for\neach r  .03, p  .71). However, for the complete sample (N\n= 633), younger participants scored a little higher (age and\nscored a little higher--sex (female = 0, male = 1) and APM-\nHierarchical GLMs were tested to explore whether the\napparent differences in male and female APM-18 scores\nmight have been indirectly attributable to the relationship\nbetween age and APM-18 scores. This model defined the\nAPM-18 score as the criterion variable, with the ordered pre-\ndictor variables being age and then sex. The hierarchical\nmodel was designed to allow age to absorb as much variance\nas possible, with sex entered into the model only afterward.\nUsing this model, both GLMs indicated a significant effect\nDiscussion\nThe results presented here suggest that the APM-18 may\nserve as a useful compromise between the lower reliability\nAPM-12 and the much longer APM-36. The hierarchical\nSefcek et al. 3\nGLMs identify both age and sex to be significant predictors\nof APM-18 scores, with younger individuals and males gen-\nerally scoring higher. These results are consistent with many\nprevious studies looking at general intelligence (e.g., Jackson\n& Rushton, 2006). Results of Study 1, however, do not test\nthe convergent validity of this scale relative to other mea-\nsures of intelligence. Study 2 was designed to do this.\nStudy 2: Convergent Validity\nStudy 2 was conducted to assess the convergent validity of\nthe APM-18 with other measures of intelligence, academic\nachievement, and personality. To do so, we tested two sepa-\neach of which used different criterion measures. In Sample 1,\ntwo widely used measures of adult intelligence were used:\nthe Mill\u00adHill Vocabulary Scale\u00adMultiple Choice Sets A & B\n(MHV-MC; J. Raven, Raven, & Court, 1997), developed to\nbe used in conjunction with the APM-36 as a measure of\nreproductive ability, that is, the ability to store and retrieve\ninformation (J. C. Raven, 1989); and the Shipley Institute of\nLiving Scale (SILS; Zachary, 1986), which is a stand-alone\nintelligence test comprised of two subscales--Vocabulary,\nwhich tests crystallized intelligence, and Abstraction, which\ntests fluid intelligence. Also, we examined academic perfor-\nmance via self-reported grade point average (GPA) and scho-\nlastic aptitude test (SAT) scores. In Sample 2, we examined\ncorrelations between APM-18 scores and Big Five personal-\nity dimensions assessed with the NEO Five-Factor Inventory\n(NEO-FFI) Scale (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and verbal and\ndrawing creativity (Miller & Tal, 2007). In addition, ACT\nscores were collected in this second sample.\nMethod\nParticipants. Sample 1 was comprised of 193 students (94 male,\n99 female) from an introductory psychology course at the Uni-\nversity of Arizona. Mean age of participants was 19.11, SD =\n=\n2.00). Due to the length of time required to administer the APM-\n18, the Shipley, and the Mill\u00adHill, 10 participants did not com-\nplete the Mill\u00adHill Test. We urged participants to record their\nSAT, ACT, and GPA scores only if they were certain of them;\ndue to this constraint, many of these scores were also missing.\nfemale) from various undergraduate courses at the University\nof New Mexico.

Again, we urged participants to record their ACT\nscores only if they were certain of them, leaving us withACT\nscores for only 129 participants.\nMeasures\nAPM-18. The APM-18 consisted of the same items identi-\nfied in Study 1. In Sample 1, the form was presented first in\na series of measures examining adult intelligence. In Sample\n2, it was presented in the middle of a questionnaire packet\nconcerning personality, creativity, sexual behavior, and intel-\nligence.\nper subscale), 60-item self-report measure that examines\nboth verbal intelligence (40 items) and abstract intelligence\n(20 items). The test is considered appropriate for average\nEnglish-speaking individuals from 14 to adult ages, who\nare motivated test takers. Validities and norms published in\nthe manual were taken from a sample of 322 army recruits.\nSplit-half reliabilities for each subscale are reported as .87\nfor Vocabulary, .89 for Abstraction, and .92 for the total\nscore.\nThe MHV-MC.The MHV-MC (J. Raven et al., 1997) is a\n68-item self-administered multiple-choice vocabulary test\ndesigned to complement the APM-36. Whereas the APM\naimed to measure an individual's ability to solve novel prob-\nlems and think in novel ways (i.e., fluid intelligence), the Mill\u00ad\nHill aimed to measure an individual's ability to recall learned\ninformation (i.e., crystallized intelligence). To this extent, it\nindicates educational attainments, cultural background, and\nfamiliarity with the test's language. The Mill\u00adHill typically\nshows split-half reliabilities more than .90 and test\u00adretest reli-\nAcademic performance.Academic performance was mea-\nsured by self-reported GPAs and SAT scores in Sample 1.\nTable 1.

In our version, participants rated\ndegree of agreement with statements about their personali-\nties and behavioral propensities on a 5-point scale ranging\nfrom -2 (strongly disagree) to 0 (neutral) to +2 (strongly\nagree). This scale has shown strong IC, with Cronbach's\nalphas ranging between .74 to .89, for each factor, and con-\nsistent cross-cultural validity (McCrae & Costa, 1997).\nVerbal and drawing creativity tasks. Participants completed\nsix 2-min verbal creativity tasks and eight 1-min drawing\ncreativity tasks (Miller & Tal, 2007). Because a mating-ori-\nented mind-set promotes creativity (Griskevicius, Cialdini,\n& Kenrick, 2006), participants were asked to complete these\ntasks as creatively as possible with the intention of attracting\na romantic partner. Examples of verbal tasks included writ-\ning answers to thought-provoking questions, such as \"How\nwould you keep a marriage exciting after the first couple of\nyears?\" \"What do you hope the world will be like in a 100\nyears?\" and \"Imagine that all clouds had really long strings\nhanging from them--strings hundreds of feet long. What\nwould be the implications of that fact for nature and soci-\nety?\" There were two types of drawing tasks, four abstract\n(e.g., \"Please draw an abstract symbol, pattern, or composi-\ntion that represents your happiness as a child doing a favorite\nactivity\") and four representational (e.g., \"In the space below,\nplease draw an animal that you admire for its strength, grace,\nspeed, or beauty\"). Each participant's responses to each of\nthe 14 creativity tasks were scored independently by four rat-\ners on a 1- to 5-point creativity scale. The resulting compos-\nite verbal creativity and drawing creativity measures showed\nhigh interrater reliability and IC (Cronbach's alphas = .91\nResults\nIC estimates were computed using Cronbach's alpha.

Mean scores for each of the measures of intelligence\ncan be seen in Table 2.

Specifically, both the APM scales cor-\nrelated positively and significantly most strongly with the\nShipley Abstraction scale and self-report SAT scores. This is\nnot surprising as the APM is designed to be a measure of g,\nwhich may be most easily identified in relation to abstract,\nanalytical measures, of which the Shipley abstraction is one,\nand the SAT contains an analytical subscale.\nSefcek et al. 5\nIC estimates were again computed using Cronbach's alpha.\nAs in Study 1 and Sample 1 of this study, the APM-18\nshowed moderate reliability ( = .79), whereas the embedded\nAPM-12 again shows slightly lower reliability ( = .74).

Both studies confirmed that the APM-18 is\nrelated to these measures in a predictable manner. Generally\nspeaking, both the APM-18 and the embedded APM-12\nshowed the same pattern of correlations with the other mea-\nsures used in these studies. However, the higher IC of the\nAPM-18 suggests that it may be better at detecting individual\nvariation in g.\nConclusion\nEach of the 18 items used in this new APM-18 test was cho-\nsen to maintain the progressive difficulty of both the long\nform(APM-36)andtheshortform(APM-12).Unsurprisingly,\nalthough the APM-18's reliability was lower than that of the\nAPM-36, it was higher than that of the APM-12 developed\nby Arthur and Day (1994). Furthermore, the patterns of cor-\nrelation with other measures of intelligence are virtually\nidentical to theAPM-12, which has, in previous studies, been\nArthur et al., 1999). Combined with an average administra-\nsuggest that the APM-18 may work well as a compromise for\nresearchers who want a quite accurate measure of general\nintelligence in a quite short amount of time. The cross-vali-\ndation in the three samples reported here is an initial attempt\nto collect normative data for the APM-18. Our results may\ngeneralize only to other college students. However, the\nAPM-18's short administration time, high IC, reasonable\nvalidity, and ease of administration by paper and pencil in\nlarge college classroom settings make it ideal for behavioral\nscience studies where researchers want a reasonably fast,\naccurate intelligence score as part of a larger questionnaire\nbattery.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAckerman, P.
