The Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) and\nthe Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ X5) were completed by leaders and subordinates severely (Avolio & Bass,\n2004; Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau, & Thoma, 1999).

The public sector, especially\ncivil service as a concept connotes a permanent body of\nofficials responsible for the execution of programs and pol-\nicies of government. There are staffs of various parastatals,\nministries, or departments under the executive arm of gov-\nernment. The concept ethics means standards of what are\nright or wrong behaviors, motives and, its consequences; it\nis equally a set of acceptable values and norms that relates\nto human conduct regarded as appropriate or inappropriate\n(Sorkaa, 2003). In the public service, achieving a private\ngain to the detriment of the citizenry is a good example of\nunethical conduct. Ethical reasoning is a matter of value\njudgment on professional and occupational beliefs and\nmorality; they are the normative values underpinning the\npublic sector administration. Thus, these are an ethical\nvalue that upholds the fabric of efficiency and service\ndelivery within the sector. Basically, effective and efficient\nmanagement of resources and accountability is a global\nphenomenon, especially in a developing economy like\nNigeria, which is bedeviled by ethical decline and leader-\nship lapses.\nFurthermore, the public sector administration in Nigeria\nis abysmal, and engulfed in leadership crisis and moral ethi-\ncal decline. These are attributed to unethical moral reasoning\nand behavior of the public officials. More often than not,\nsome ethical lapses are the outcome of poor moral judgment,\nblatant disregard for code of ethics and law, outright corrup-\ntion, favoritisms, and other evil intentions of public leaders\n(Kellerman, 2004), and reasons for leader's failures are as\nmany as the ethical lapses. Thus, unethical conduct, actions,\nand porous judgment have created and nourished a leader-\nship crisis that has adversely affected the quality of gover-\nnance in all spheres and levels of the public service.Anotable\nNigerian writer and a social critic (Achebe, 1983) posited\nthat one major problem of Nigeria is leadership failure and\nits attendant consequences.\nMoreover, absence of good leadership and governance\nhas been identified as the major setback in socio-economic\nand political development efforts in the Third World coun-\ntries (Kurtz & Schrank, 2007).

A better mechanism for restoring trust and confidence\nof the populace is through ethical reasoning and moral\nbehavior on the part of the leadership which will enhance the\nethicality of subordinates in the work situation. Ethical issues\nand lapses remain one of the most pronounced gray areas of\nconcern among organizational theorists and leadership schol-\nars. Leadership style and its impact on followers have been\ncentral to our everyday life from ages.\nHowever, leaders' \"and subordinates'\" degree of moral\ndevelopment has attracted the attention of scholars and prac-\ntitioners for decades. Nowadays, credible organizations\nencourage post-conventional ethical reasoning and behavior\nfor efficiency and effectiveness. Similarly, the increasing\nnature and momentum of ethical decline and leadership fail-\nures elicits academic curiosity. Transformational leadership\n(TFL) style and transactional leadership style focus on\nemployee relationship with leaders, which constitutes com-\nplex methodological and theoretical challenges to scholars.\nMoreover, the impact of individual value orientation remains\nunder explored, while leadership plays crucial role toward\nblending man and materials for effective organizational\noutcome.\nIn the contemporary world of today, most especially the\nNigerian public sector, leadership failure and crisis are usu-\nally attributed to lack of ethical practices and behavior among\nthe leaders. Equally significant is that most of the values usu-\nally linked to ethics in the public sector are always examined\nindependently of the broader issue of leadership (Seifert &\nYukl, 2010); in line with this, it is believed that ethic and\nleadership will be an illusion, if both concepts are not\nblended. Despite the important role both play in organiza-\ntions, only few researches have been documented in the\nNigerian context at this time, and in particular no study\nexamined the influence of personal, individual value orienta-\ntion on cognitive moral development (CMD) of leaders and\nfollowers (Achebe, 1983). However, researchers on ethics\npoint out that individuals frequently rationalize or disagree\nover the most moral action to an ethical dilemma, as an\naction is morally right or wrong depends on the norms of the\nsociety.\nTFL\nLiterature evidenced that high ethical standards are the hall-\nvision and values are based on shared ideology. The impact\nof transformational leadership in the public sector is being\ncontested as scholars maintain that the organizational struc-\nture and size of the public sector inhibits or even out rightly\nmakes transformational leadership unethical venture (Seifert\n& Yukl, 2010), hence the rational for a moderating factor\nsometimes to cushion negative impediments.Although atten-\ntion has been focused on TFL due largely to its positive\neffects, very little has been done to establish its processes.\nScholars have therefore made calls for more study to exam-\nine the mechanism of TFL style (Judge & Piccolo, 2006).\nPrevious studies supports that the features of the leader, the\nfollowers, and situations enhances the chances for a leader to\nbe transformational and to exhibit such behavior (Avolio,\nReichard, Hannah, Walumbwa, & Chan, 2009; Yukl &\nMahsud, 2010). Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the\ninfluence of CMD on TFL style and subordinates' ethicality\nin the Nigerian public sector.\nCMD and TFL Style\nThe TFL style sometimes referred to as charismatic or vision-\nary leadership exhibits higher level of moral maturity\nand it uplifts the moral behavioral standards of followers\n(Burns, 1978). True transformational leaders are known to be\noptimistic, committed, risk takers, strong willed in character,\nand possess a great inner sense of direction and judgment\n(House & Aditya, 1997; Shamir, Zakay, Breinin, & Popper,\n1998), equally, empirical research related TFL to the higher\nmoral development (Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999; Kuhnert &\nLewis, 1987). Transformational leaders are visionaries who\nempower, develop, support, create innovations, are charis-\nmatic, and lead by example; it has demonstrated a positive\nrelationship on subordinates' attitudes and organizational\noutcome and impacts positively on subordinates' general\nethicality.\nPost-conventional moral judgment is based on sound rea-\nsoning. It is an acceptable solution to an ethical dilemma or\nbetween conflicting systems, values, beliefs which require\nthat a leader must make a decision to follow in achieving a\nset objective. It is important to note that each decision made\nby a leader is usually based on one criterion or the other;\ntherefore, ethical reasoning and ethical decisions sometimes\nare based on more than one ethical theory or ethical princi-\nple. For example, scholars are of the view that different ethi-\ncal contents will naturally invoke a different ethical reasoning\napproach as in cases of coercion and control; this normally\nwill invoke the act utilitarianism ethical reasoning (Fritzsche\n& Becker, 1984). Ethics could be regarded as a road map\nwhich points out the difference between the right and wrong\nbehavior and this equally acts as a standard against which the\nbehavior and actions of the public officials and political\noffice holders can be measured. The complexities and dyna-\nmism of human decisions often demand more than one the-\nory to meet the exigencies of an ethical dilemma (Felix,\nLawrence Kohlberg (1969) remains a reference point\nwhenever moral judgment level is being considered, and his\ntheory of CMD highlights the processes of moral judgment.\nIndividuals move from the stages to the highest which is the\npost-conventional stage; therefore, principled reasoning or\nethical reasoning is based on individual capacity to develop\nFelix et al. 3\nto the highest level. Individuals at the early stage occupy\nthemselves with what is right due largely to fear of punish-\nment (Stage 1), or exchange in relationship a sort of give and\ntake (Stage 2), while those on conventional level do what is\nright based on expectation of others (Stage 3). By Stage 4,\nindividuals are principle minded and decide what is right due\nto their cherished values and standards irrespective of diver-\ngent views, and at Stage 5, individuals are concerned with\njustice, rights, and fair play, while Stage 6 is more of a theory\nthan practicable as at now.\nKohlberg's theory has been simplified into a manageable\nform (Rest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 1999) while retain-\ning the core elements of the old theory. Those individuals\nwith a higher level of moral reasoning are admired by subor-\ndinates as transformational leaders (Turner, Barling,\nEpitropaki, Butcher, & Milner, 2002). From an individual\nvalues perspective, power and achievement will attract an\nobserver's attention and will likely enhance the observer's\ndesire to emulate the modeled individual behavior. Empirical\nstudies that examined cognitive moral reasoning and TFL are\nrare. Equally, managers with high level of ethical reasoning\nwere perceived as transformational leaders (Turner et\nal.,\n2002), leadership motivated by ethics and shared values, a\nsocial learning process (Brown & Trevi\u00f1o, 2006). Therefore,\nfrom empirical results and related theories, it is posited that\ncognitive moral reasoning will positively enhance TFL\nbehavior to impact significantly on followers' general moral\nbehavior and level reasoning.\nLeadership connotes exchange, expectation, and reciproc-\nity which are the hallmarks of subordinates\u00adleadership rela-\ntionship. Thus, we argue that compromising high ethical\nbehavior in TFL will engender such relationships, as leaders\nwith low or high level CMD will exhibit commensurate or\ndiscriminating behavioral pattern. Bass (1985) empirically\nanalyzed TFL and developed four items of measure as pro-\npelling follower's perception of values and mission and\nvision, make followers abandon personal interest for organi-\nzational needs\nMethod\nThis study is a quantitative research conducted in a cross-\nsectional design to examine the effect of cognitive moral\nreasoning on TFL style in the Nigerian public sector. The\ntarget populations of this study are the employees of the\nKebbi State public service, and the population frame was\nobtained from the State's Civil Service Commission (2013)\nKebbi that controls the various ministries in the state. Kebbi\nState is in the Northwestern part of Nigeria and it was pri-\nmarily selected for this study because it is one of the largest\nand most populated geopolitical zones in the country with\nan estimated population of about 10 million out of the total\nestimated Nigerian population of 140 million; therefore,\nKebbi State represents a viable zone in Nigeria's public sec-\ntor organization.\nSample and Sampling Technique\nA stratified sampling method was adopted due to the diver-\nsity of ministries mandate and the likely diversity equally in\nstyle of leadership and individual belief system. The essence\nis to gain more insight into the perception of employees on\nleadership styles (Sekaran, 2009). Four ministries were ran-\ndomly selected from the 10 ministries that were not affected\nby the recent mergers and equally are the core ministries with\nthe largest population based on statistical report (The Civil\nService Commission, 2013). The total of employees of the\nfour ministries is 14,337. Using the simplified sampling\ntable by Krejcie and Morgan (1970), a total sample size of\n375 is deemed adequate for the study. However, the researcher\ndecided to even it up to 400, the reason is to enhance a large\nresponse rate as Nigeria is characterized by a poor response\nto survey research.\nInstrumentation\nA survey questionnaire was used to collect data from respon-\ndents to achieve the desired objectives. This is in respect to\nthe nature of the formulated hypotheses in this study. For\ncognitive, moral development (CMD; Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau\netal., 1999) v the DIT-2 questionnaire, which is in two parts\ncontaining the instructions and stories of ethical, social prob-\nlems, as well as questions on ethical issues raised was used,\nrespondents were to rate and rank most important arguments\nthat influenced their decisions (p score). The dimensions of\nTFL style were measured using the Multifactor Leadership\nQuestionnaire (MLQ X5; Avolio & Bass, 2004). The instru-\nment was divided into three sections, namely, demographic\nfactors, ethical reasoning, and the transformational leader-\nship style. Respondents were required to answer questions\non ethical reasoning/value orientation (CMD) using a 5-point\nLikert-type scale adopted from a series of ethical dilemmas/\nvalue estimates and scenarios developed by eminent scholars\nData Analysis\nPartial Least Square\u00adStructural Equation Modeling (PLS-\nSEM) software (Ringle, Wende, & Will, 2005) was used for\nthe analysis of the collected data in this study. In addition,\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for\nthe descriptive analyses of the respondents. To measure the\nsignificance of linear bivariate, between the cognitive,\nmoral development (CMD), and transformational leader-\nship. A regression analysis was used to meet the objective\nof the research. The choice of PLS-SEM in this study is\nbased on the fact that PLS suits complexities of models due\nlargely to its flexibility in development and validation of\nmodels. Therefore, SmartPLS 2.0 (M3) was chosen to\nestablish, construct, measurement and structural models in\nthis study.\n4 SAGE Open\nMeasurement Model\nThe measurement model was evaluated by assessing the con-\nvergent validity, which is measured by loading, the average\nvariance extracted (AVE), and the composite reliability (CR)\nresult. The result revealed good items loading above the rec-\nommended threshold (0.5) by Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson,\nand Tatham (2014). Also, the result of the AVE indicates a\nvalue of 0.580 for TFL style, but no value for CMD because\nit was measured by a single item. Concerning the CR result\nwhich measures the internal consistency of the measurement\ninstrument, the analysis found a value of 0.846 for TFL style.\nThe values of the CR are greater than the threshold value of\ngood reliable measure of the measurement instrument. In\naddition, the finding revealed an R2 value of .142, indicating\nthat 14.2% variance in TFL style was explained by the cogni-\ntive moral reasoning (CMD). The summary of the measure-\nment model in this study is presented in Table 1.\nIn this study, SmartPLS 2.0 software from Ringle et\nal.\n(2005) was used for the model parameter estimation to enhance\nthe maximization of the variance in TFL explained by CMD.\nHence, the study used a non-parametric method with 2,000\nbootstrappedsamplestoestimatethestandarderrors(Tenenhaus,\nVinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro, 2005). The next section presents the\nassessment of the measurement model of the study.\nDiscriminant Validity\nThe discriminant validity indicates whether the concept\nunder investigation in a study is unique in a model (Hair,\nRingle, & Sarstedt, 2013). Applying the Fornel and Lackers\ncriterion, achieved by comparing the square root of the aver-\nage variance extracted values with the correlation values of\neach latent variable in the model (Fornell & Larcker, 1981),\nthe result shows that the AVE value of each construct is\ngreater than its highest correlation with any other constructs\nin the model, which thereby indicates the achievement of\ndiscriminant validity (Hair etal., 2014). Table 2 presents the\nresult of the discriminant validity.\nStructural Model\nStructural model captures the linear regression effects endog-\nenous constructs on each other and the structural model gives\nan insight into the relationships of the constructs. An innova-\ntive and evolving model in its ability to test directly theories\nof interest (Li & Wong, 2001) and its validation was done\nthrough the application of the SmartPLS 2.0.M3.\nFindings\nEmpirical results of previous studies are inconsistent largely\ndue to factor optimal structure which requires further confir-\nmatory analysis. The analysis of the demographic profile of\nthe respondents revealed that the largest proportion represent-\ning 79% of the respondents are from the ministry of education.\nworking experience, 22.5% have between 1 and 5 years work-\ning experience, and only 23.5% of the respondents have more\nthan 16 years of working experience. In addition, 56.5% of the\nrespondents are male, while 43.5% are female. Moreover, the\nChristians; and 13.0% are in the group of other religions.\nConcerning the age of the respondents, 26.3% are between 30\n50 years of age. Furthermore, 22.5% of the respondents are\nsenior executive officers of their respective organizations,\n17.9% are chief executive officers, and 26.3% are supervisors,\nwhile the remaining 33.3% are at a non-supervisory grade posi-\ntion. In the aspect of the respondents'educational qualification,\nbachelor's degree, and 12.3% are doctoral degree holders,\nhigher school qualifications. The results of the demographic\nanalysis are presented in Table 3.\nResearch Question 1: What is the level of CMD of the\nNigerian public sector officials?\nTable 1.

The result\nshows that the major proportion, 65.61%, of the respondents\nare at the preconvention stage of moral reasoning and 20%\nare at the conventional stage, while 14.39% are at the post-\nconventional stage of moral reasoning. Table 4 presents the\nsummary of the moral reasoning level of the respondents.\nResearch Question 2: To what extent does CMD relate to\nTFL style in the Nigerian public sector?\nIn testing the stated research questions of this study, the\nstructural model was assessed through the PLS path analysis.\nTable 5 shows the result of the standard path coefficients (),\nstandard error, t value, and the decision taken on the hypoth-\neses. The result found a statistical significant relationship\nResearch Question 3: What is the level of CMD and TFL\nin the various ministries?\nTable 6 depicts the mean value and the standard devia-\ntion of TFL style in the various ministries understudy in\nrespect to post-conventional reasoning application to\nsolve ethical dilemmas in the workplace. As observed,\nthe ministry of finance with 3.26 mean value, has an\nedge, followed by the ministry of health 3.24 mean value,\nthen the ministry of works and housing 3.20 and the least\nis the ministry of education 3.12 mean value in that order.\nThe reason could be attributed to the fact that the ministry\nof works and housing seems to be business orientated as\ncontingent reward manifests in the day-to-day allocations\nof duties and responsibilities, while the ministry of edu-\ncation relies more on prescribed rules and curriculum,\nunlike the ministries of health and finance where their\nethical code of conduct is more pronounced and ser-\nvice oriented.\nDiscussion\nThe motive behind this study was to examine the degree of\npublic sector officials' CMD and its relationship with TFL\nbehavior as perceived by the subordinates. We proposed that\nCMD is related to TFL style as perceived by the subordinates\nand it was significantly supported as leaders operating at a\nTable 3.

Idealized influence attracts respect and admiration\nof subordinates, demonstrate the features of a moral individ-\nual and moral leadership (Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999). It\ninstills respect and trust on followers. Inspirational motiva-\ntion compels transformational leaders reflect on moral caring\nattitude and sincere interest in the development of their fol-\nlowers as they lead by example, acceptable to the subordi-\nnates who equally emulate them. While through intellectual\nstimulation and individualized consideration, transforma-\ntional leaders appreciate the subordinates'personal attributes\nand potentials with regard to their individual requirements\nand aspirations.\nThese findings seem predictive, as transformational\nleaders motivate and mentor their subordinates for self and\norganizational benefits, and this is direct opposite of trans-\nactional leadership which is more assertive and perfor-\nmance oriented. Leaders with low level moral reasoning\nstage exhibit less transformational leadership qualities,\nwhile those in the middle (Conventional Stage) apply either\npre-conventional or post-conventional reasoning, and this\nsupports earlier theorists (e.g., Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999;\n2002). Therefore, our argument is that public leaders with\nhigher CMD exhibit more TFL behaviors, and impact more\npositively on subordinates' general ethical make-up and\nmoral behavior. Transactional leadership behavior is more\nin use between subordinate-leaders relations in the Nigeria\npublic sector.\nConclusion\nWe gave an insight to further buttress current knowledge\nabout CMD and TFL behavior and advocated an agenda for\nfurther studies. Leaders exhibiting post-conventional moral\nreasoning are inclined to use TFL behavior and are perceived\nas such by the subordinates (Trevino, 1986; Turner etal.,\n2002). Ethical reasoning is not the only barometer to mea-\nsure moral development as they are varieties of models\n(Chen McCain, Tsai, & Bellino, 2010). This adds value and\nincreased our understanding of both concepts as it will guide\nleadership training tailor measured to suit the realities on the\nground. Therefore, further studies are advocated to investi-\ngate other intervening elements as other individual moral\nmotivational values and TFL behavior. Similarly, an insight\ninto other mechanisms will spur future studies. The research\nreveals that ethical reasoning correlates to TFL style, which\nenhances ethicality of followers and the organization. Thus,\nthis research work maintains and concludes that the findings\nhave been able to address the research questions and the\nstudy's objectives.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAchebe, C.
