The\nargument, briefly put, is that political philosophies based\nupon the search for an ideal state of affairs to anchor their\ncritical and prescriptive ambitions, so-called \"ideal theo-\nries,\" are bound to fail:\nunder the conditions of human existence, we cannot know\nwhat such an ideal would be...only those in a morally\nheterogeneous society have a reasonable hope of actually\nunderstanding what an ideal society would be like, but in such\na society we will never be collectively devoted to any single\nThus, the argument is composed of two smaller claims. The\nfirst, the \"Ideal theory claim,\" is that ideal theory cannot\nconceptually live up to its billing: the best possible case for\ndoing ideal theory should lead us to recognize that such\nendeavors are conceptually incoherent or lead to morally\nperverse outcomes. The second claim, the \"Open Society\nclaim,\" is that the best way to approximate a knowledge of\nthe optimal institutional state of affairs is to organize insti-\ntutions around the goal of maximizing perspectival diver-\nsity, not according to an ideal blueprint. Put together, Gaus\nclaims that ideal theory leads to irresolvable dilemmas, and\nthat the best way to make good on what ideal theory strives\nfor is to not strive for ideal theory at all.\nThe problem for Gaus, I argue, is that the \"ideal theory\nclaim\" is so well established that it undermines his \"Open\nSociety claim.\" Precisely because ideal theory has the\nproblems that Gaus skillfully illuminates, we should be\nskeptical about the picture he paints of the Open Society. I\nbegin this short commentary by rehearsing Gaus's argu-\nments about ideal theory and the Open Society, and then\nshow that the Open Society suffers the same pathologies as\nideal theory, which I illustrate through a discussion of the\ncurrent debate surrounding free speech.\nIdeal Theory and \"The Choice\"\nany political import must satisfy two desiderata: the \"social\n\"Gaus's choice\": The Open Society\nas an ideal\nAbraham Singer\n Keywords\nIdeal theory, Open Society, Gerald Gaus, markets, liberal democracy, institutional interdependency\nDepartment of Management, Quinlan School of Business, Loyola\nUniversity Chicago, USA\nCorresponding author:\nAbraham Singer, Department of Management, Quinlan School of\nBusiness, Loyola University Chicago, 820 N.

Ideal theory is both\npractical1 and necessary when it can tell us how just a state\nof the world is, and whether moving toward some particular\nstate of the world will move us in the direction of the opti-\nmal state of the world.\nThe \"orientation condition\" is where the action is in\nGaus's argument. What distinguishes an ideal theory from\na more pragmatic, problem-solving approach, or Sen's\n\"climbing model,\" is that an ideal theory is oriented toward\nsomething beyond the moral problems of the day, or mere\nnormative evaluation. Making the claim \"state of affairs X\nis intolerably inegalitarian or illiberal or inefficient\" does\nnot require imagining an ideal state of affairs U where\nequality, liberalism, or efficiency is perfectly achieved.\nWhereas Sen or a pragmatist will advocate \"climbing\" the\nmountain we find ourselves upon with the evaluative crite-\nria at hand, ideal theory, if it's adding anything other than a\nrhetorical flourish to a set of evaluative criteria, must also\nbe in the business of orienting us toward the ideal\nmountaintop.\nThe reason why this matters is because the evaluative\ncriteria and the ideal orientation can pull in opposite direc-\ntions. Because institutions are complex and interdependent,\nparticularly when it comes to their relationship to justice,\n\"the justice of an institution, practice, or policy can be\ndependent on what other institutions or policies are in\nexample, may very well think that, all things being equal, a\nmore just society would be one where universities have no\ntuition, since that would make higher education accessible\nto people of all socio-economic backgrounds. However,\nthis conclusion will likely be conditional on other institu-\ntions and policies obtaining: relative equality in secondary\neducation, equal access to information about universities,\nand publicly provided SAT prep programs. Absent these\npre-conditions, pursuing a tuition-free university could be\ncounterproductive from a social democratic perspective, as\nit would essentially be subsidizing richer students' access\nto university. While we may move closer to the more just\ninstitutional arrangement by implementing tuition-freeness,\nour society is made less just because we have not secured\nthe background conditions necessary to make that institu-\ntional innovation justice-promoting.\nAs Gaus puts it, institutional complexity and interde-\npendency create a \"rugged optimization landscape,\"\nwhere institutional similarity is not well-correlated with\njustice. The landscape is rugged because the route to the\n\"peak\" optimal institutional arrangement will involve\ninnovations resulting in \"valleys\" of less just states of\naffairs. Creating the institutions necessary to secure opti-\nmal justice, in other words, will involve \"worse-before-it-\ngets-better\" movements en route to the optimum. We\ncannot assume that getting closer, in terms of institutional\ndesign, to the ideal will be justice-promoting, and we can-\nnot assume that justice-promoting improvements move us\ncloser to the ideal institutional configuration.\nConsequently, a theory that makes use of an ideal model\nwill produce evaluative criteria and an orientation that\npull in different directions: there is no reason to assume\nthat making things more just here and now will orient us\ntoward the ideal.\nThe ideal theorist's response to this is simple enough:\nsacrificing small improvements in justice is worth the end-\nresult of reaching optimal justice.After all, it's an optimum!\nThis response, however, assumes a heroic amount of\nknowledge and confidence in our assessments: it ignores\nthe fact that we know much more about social worlds that\nare like our own, that are in our \"neighborhood\" (Gaus,\nan institution that would incrementally improve the justice\nof our society, and one that would lead us toward the ideal,\nwe have good reason to be more confident in our assess-\nments of the former than the latter. The complexity, interde-\npendency,andnoveltyoftheidealinstitutionalconfiguration\nconspire to rob us of our confidence in it.\nBecause of this, ideal theorists invariably face \"The\nChoice\":\nincaseswherethereisaclearoptimumwithinourneighborhood\nthat requires movement away from our understanding of the\nideal, we often must choose between relatively certain (perhaps\nlarge) local improvements in justice and pursuit of a\nconsiderably less certain ideal, which would yield optimal\nThis is the crux of the ideal theory claim: ideal theorists\nmust be committed to an orientation condition of their the-\nory; however, because of institutional interdependency and\nour better knowledge of more proximate social worlds,\nlocal justice and optimal justice will often pull in opposite\ndirections, with our confidence in achieving the former\nbeing much greater than the latter. The Choice, which\nresults, is the unpalatable consequence of being committed\nto articulating ideals and using them as guides in our nor-\nmative analyses.\nThe Open Society\nGiven the problems that ideal theory faces, Gaus offers an\nargument for an Open Society. The Choice arises because\nof our inability to be confident in the ideal, our lack of\nknowledge of its shape and functioning, relative to our\nunderstanding of more local improvements. So, a way of\nalleviating the problem is by increasing our knowledge of\nwhat we want to achieve in society and our confidence in\nits achievability and workability. Gaus contends that our\nability to make accurate predictions is increased by (1) the\nexistence of perspectival diversity and (2) the ability for\nthese diverse perspectives to communicate with one\nanother. Gaus's Open Society is meant to achieve both.\nFirst, the Open Society requires the existence of secure, sta-\nble, and recognized institutions: by establishing institu-\ntions, an open society creates common ontological\ncategories for citizens and \"common sources of interpreting\nbasis for, and conduits of, communication amongst them.\nSecond, and most important, is that in an open society,\nthe design of these institutions is not based on a pre-decided\nideal of what we want out of social cooperation. Instead,\ninstitutions ought to be designed with the aim of accom-\nmodating extant diverse perspectives and allowing the\nintroduction and development of new diverse perspectives\nasset for answering the question of which ends we want our\nsocial institutions to be oriented towards. Put differently,\nperspectival diversity can contribute to discovering the\nknowledge of the ends that ideal theory tries to find; how-\never, achieving that diversity requires giving up attempts to\norganize our institutions around such knowledge.\nSo, which institutions are required for an \"open soci-\nety\"? Gaus offers three basic categories, and implies a\nfourth. First, law and morality ought to be organized around\n198). Because an open society seeks to achieve maximal\nperspectival diversity, permissiveness should be the default;\nin the Open Society, the basic idea is \"Do it unless we say\nnot to\" and not \"Don't do it unless we say you can.\" Going\nthe other way, thinking that an action is permitted only\nwhen a moral rule permits it, will unduly limit the sorts of\nlifestyles, perspectives, and ideological viewpoints that\npopulate the Open Society.\nSecond, the Open Society requires that there be \"juris-\ndictional rights,\" in order to mitigate the complexity that a\nmaximally diverse society will necessarily engender.\nBecause a public order based on the actually-existing per-\nspectives of its members will be constantly in flux, as views\nand perspectives come and go, we must provide individuals\nwith the ability to establish \"jurisdictions\" within which\nthey have control over what happens. Private property\nrights, for Gaus, are the quintessential jurisdictional rights,\nallowing people to make \"small social worlds\" for them-\nselves without negotiating with, or concerning ourselves\nally, the basic rights familiar to liberal society (association,\nreligion, privacy) are jurisdictional rights, in that they\nestablish protected individual and associational realms in\nwhich one's perspective can hold court.\nThe third institution follows from the emphasis placed\non private property: markets, the institution par excellence\nof facilitating cooperation without thick agreement (Gaus,\nuisite agreement on relatively less controversial things (like\nwhat is being traded and the terms on which it is being\ntraded) without requiring agreement on the metaphysical\nnature or moral worth of things. A society wishing to avoid\nimposing values upon others, like the diversity-oriented\nOpen Society, must be a market society of some sort.\nFourth, though stated less explicitly, the Open Society\nrequires some brand of democratic politics. The basic idea\nof the Open Society--that we ought not, and cannot, know\nor decide upon what we ought to strive for a priori, and\ntherefore must allow for a diverse and pluralistic society to\nfigure such things out themselves--presumes some mecha-\nnisms for translating these diverse perspectives into public\npolicy, and procedures to enact and pursue some measures\nand not others. Gaus suggests that this is the domain of\none of the many democratic choice procedures in the\nof some sort is still necessary to produce a social choice.\nThis is the Open Society claim. Perspectival diversity is\nthe best bet for achieving the knowledge presupposed by\nideal theory, yet achieving this diversity requires us giving\nup designing institutions according to some ideal. Instead,\nwe should seek to create the institutions of an open society,\ndesigned to maximize diverse perspectives, and facilitate\ncommunication between them: permissive moral-legal\ncodes; jurisdictional rights; markets; and democratic proce-\ndures and institutions.\nThe Open Society as an Ideal\nThe question that suggests itself is this: If \"the ideal theory\nclaim\" is accurate, is Gaus entitled to offer the \"Open\nSociety claim\"? Gaus wants to say that because its content\nis not pre-ordained, that its institutions are designed to\nmake that content an ongoing debate, the Open Society\ndoes not fall victim to the pathologies of ideal theory. In\nideal theory, the moral principles set the stage for deriving\ninstitutions; in the Open Society, the institutions set the\nstage for deriving moral principles. And yet, according to\nGaus, a commitment to openness and perspectival diversity\ndoes direct us toward certain institutional configurations.\nWe can say that the Open Society displays the pathologies\nof ideal theory if its institutional configuration entails insti-\ntutional interdependency such that getting one aspect of the\nOpen Society correct without others could be less desirable\nthan an otherwise sub-optimal alternative. Or, put differ-\nently, it has the trappings of ideal theory if it gives rise to\nThe Choice. Even with a commitment as minimal as the\nOpen Society, I argue, we still find ourselves facing The\nChoice; pursuing the Open Society entails foregoing local\n4 Research and Politics \nimprovements to justice, requiring something like an article\nof faith when weighing it against other alternatives.\nGaus's insistence upon markets as an institutional core of\nthe Open Society is important to note here, since markets are\ncomplex, requiring several interdependent institutions. As\nnents: property rights, regulatory institutions, stabilizing insti-\ntutions, institutions for providing social insurance, and\ninstitutions for conflict management. This is true of the institu-\ntions necessary for the Open Society more generally: the pro-\ntection of liberal \"jurisdictional\" rights requires a variety of\neffective governance structures, legal codes with roughly-\naccepted interpretations, and so forth. All of which is to say:\nthe institutions of the Open Society, as minimal as they are, are\nnot inherently a \"package deal.\" One can have property rights\nwithout the institutions necessary to secure that exchanges are\nhappening voluntarily or fairly; the ability to exchange prop-\nerty rights can be secured without establishing competitive\nmarkets; we can have corporations without the bureaucratic\nand legal bodies necessary to effect legitimate corporate gov-\nernance regimes, etc. Furthermore, one can have these things\nwithout having other aspects of a liberal society that an open\nsociety seems to require: a society can have competitive and\nsmoothly running markets with secure private property rights,\nbut also not have established institutions protecting free speech\nThis becomes even more complicated when we consider\nthe democratic institutions presumed by the Open Society.\nAgain, Gaus is agnostic on the precise nature of these dem-\nocratic politics. Still, we note that even a minimal concep-\ntion of democracy has several institutional prerequisites:\nregular and free elections; universal suffrage; protection of\ncivil liberties; and so forth. Each of these can be had with-\nout the others, resulting in authoritarianism, not democracy\n(Levitsky and Way, 2010). Democratic procedures--like\nthe permissive codes, the jurisdictional rights, and the mar-\nket economy, which are part and parcel of the Open\nSociety--exhibit high levels of institutional complexity\nand interdependency: there is no reason to think that mov-\ning toward this institutional configuration in part, but not in\ntotal, is an inherently positive thing.\nFaced with moving toward this Open Society or invest-\ning time and resources into, say, industrialization or growth,\none faces precisely \"The Choice\" that Gaus warns of ideal\ntheory. We must choose to pursue this Open Society despite\nthe institutional interdependence that will render the pursuit\na \"rugged optimization landscape.\" This means potentially\nforgoing surer local improvements to achieve a grander\npicture of society, the preferability of which is based on\nwhat looks an awful lot like an ideal theory, Gaus's protes-\ntations to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe fact of this complexity and interdependence makes\nsense of the actual historical development of such institu-\ntional configurations. As we know, private property, com-\npetitive markets, liberal rights and institutions, and\ndemocratic government were not established ex nihilio, but\nagainst a background of local norms, customs, and specific\npractices of exchange and ownership. Thus, even if we\napprove of the liberal societies that came later, the fact is\nthat they required a large amount of \"worse-before-it-gets-\nbetter\" moves to develop. Private property required break-\ning up and disrupting established patterns and relationships\ncausing hardship and pain for those accustomed to such\npractices, only to get an initially fledgling, unequal, and\nimperfect system of property rights in return. Establishing\ncompetitive markets has required the displacement and dis-\nciplining of large swaths of population in order transform\nthem from peasant workers to wage laborers (Polanyi,\n1944). This, again, was not simply a matter of moving incre-\nmentally toward the market, but rather disrupting extant\nrelationships and imposing costs upon people with the\npromise of a better institutional configuration in the future.\nSimilarly, the rights and procedures associated with lib-\neral democracy have often not been developed spontane-\nously and without harm, but through violent and colonial\nmeans. Armed with ideas about the preferability and right-\neousness of liberal democratic institutions and norms, colo-\nnialists have been all too willing to subject peoples to\nhardships in the pursuit of an ideal--even when the ideal is\nliberal openness and inclusivity (e.g. Mehta, 1999). Now, no\ndoubt Gaus is aware of this history, and is certainly no pro-\nponent of such actions. One may think we ought to pursue\nthe Open Society, and still be critical of how we have his-\ntorically gone about pursuing it. Still, this history should\ngive us pause as it illustrates the more general point: the\nOpen Society is not something that can be created spontane-\nously and all at once. Instead, choices must be made to enact\nit, choices which will involve breaking up past ways of\ndoing things and foregoing other potential alternatives. This\nmakes the force and violence underlying transformations to\nliberalism look less like an unfortunate historical hypocrisy,\nand more like the consequences of pursuing a set of institu-\ntions far from the neighborhood in which one finds oneself.\nIn this light, maximizing perspectival diversity, and\nthe institutions necessary to achieve it, looks more like an\nideal that, if we heed its call, will orient policy and insti-\ntutional design away from local improvements in justice.\nA society that finds itself in a traditional sort of gift econ-\nomy, or organized around norms that privilege group-\noriented modes of consensus or elder rule, may eventually\nbe improved if it were to develop markets, \"jurisdic-\ntional\" rights, permissive legal/moral orders, and demo-\ncratic procedures. However, moving closer to this\ninstitutional configuration does not mean we are approxi-\nmating or moving closer to the freedom and perspectival\ndiversity such a configuration promises: instilling prop-\nerty rights without competition or exchange will likely\ncreate more power imbalances than it will mitigate; creat-\ning \"markets\" without recognized and legitimate legal\nregimes to enforce property rights can give moral cover\nto coercive market \"exchanges\"; establishing electoral\nprocedures without universal suffrage or fair competition\nis not obviously an improvement upon the local and tra-\nditional means of decision-making; and so forth. Put dif-\nferently, the decision to create such institutions will look\nmuch like \"The Choice\" that generically plagues ideal\ntheory, because such institutions are complex, interde-\npendent, and imperfectly correlated with the outcome\nthey strive to achieve.\nIn attempting to deal with the problems raised by ideal\ntheory, Gaus inadvertently demonstrates their ubiquity.\nThe Case of Free Speech\nTo put all this another way: a principled commitment to open-\nness is in inherent tension with the conservatism (cf. Estlund.\n2017) inherent to Gaus's principled resistance to ideal theory.\nBy way of illustration, consider the current debate surround-\ning the protection of hate speech. Park's (2017) New York\nTimes op-ed is exemplary of a growing attraction to the idea\nthat speech ought to be restricted because of its ability to\ninjure or harm. Park argues that theACLU's current policy of\nprotecting all free speech claims regardless of its content--\nfor example, protecting the speech rights of the KKK or neo-\nNazis--is misguided because it ignores the current context in\nwhich such speech takes place: \"the question [the ACLU]\nshould ask itself is this: could prioritizing first amendment\nrights make the distribution of power in this country even\nmore unequal and further silence the communities most bur-\ndened by histories of censorship?\"\nI discuss this stance here not to endorse it, but to point\nout that there is a Gausian logic to Park's rather un-Gausian\nargument. Here, the ACLU looks like an organization\nenraptured by the ideal of free speech; pursuing this ideal\nleads the ACLU away from a more local optimum, where\nextant injustices are taken into account and inform our pro-\ntection of public speech. Allowing the KKK or neo-Nazis\nto march results from The Choice to pursue the open ideal\ninstead of a more local improvement where hatemongers\nare not empowered to spread their vitriol.\nUndoubtedly Gaus would demur. Perhaps there are good\nreasons to restrict speech in some circumstances; however,\nwe would only have epistemic confidence in the justice of\nsuch an intervention given the initial achievement of a per-\nspectivally diverse Open Society. To know whether the\nACLU ought to be restricted, something like the current\nACLU position would have to prevail. But Park has a handy\nresponse: why should we have confidence that such a state\nof affairs is achievable and desirable now? As Wiens (2018:\n25) puts it: \"Gaus has yet to explore the causal mechanisms\nby which we could bring about the Open Society given the\nmechanisms that are operative at the status quo.\"2 Not\nallowing Nazis to speak seems to allow us to reach a more\nlocal optimum, where minorities and the oppressed don't\nhave to suffer the indignities of hate speech (Waldron,\n2014). It's not obvious why we should forego that optimum\nto pursue the less proximate, and therefore less sure, condi-\ntion of perspectival diversity.\nThe dilemma turns on what \"neighborhood\" we think\nwe're in. If we are in the neighborhood of the Open Society\nthen it would make sense to follow the current ACLU pol-\nicy. If, however, we are far off from such a neighborhood,\nwe would have no reason to follow such a policy, and it\nwould appear prudent to heed Park's advice. Now, maybe\nwe have some reason to believe that we currently are or\naren't in the neighborhood of the Open Society. But for\nGaus's claim to work--for the Open Society to be a \"non-\nideal\" and thereby escape The Choice--we'd need to think\nthat it is always optimizing to pursue openness, that pursu-\ning it would never require foregoing a surer improvement\nto justice. Otherwise the Open Society looks more like any\nother hypothetical institutional configuration, the wisdom\nof pursuing which will be a function of our proximity to it.\nConclusion\nWhile my discussion in this short memo has been focused\nspecifically on Gaus's arguments against ideal theory and for\nthe Open Society, by discussing the problem of hate speech,\nmy hope is to suggest a more general point. I have sought to\nchallenge the idea that by minimizing the standards of one's\nnormative theory, one is divesting oneself of the pathologies\nof ideal theory. A commitment to openness as a normative\nideal is still a normative ideal. If one wishes to articulate an\nintegrated normative political theory (see Simmons, 2010:\n21\u00ad24) with any sort of institutional detail, then, given exist-\ning norms and practices, pursuing a \"nonideal\" like the Open\nSociety will involve many of the same dilemmas that pursu-\ning the ideal society raises. In light of this, perhaps ideals are\nnecessary not because we can always act on their behalf, but\nprecisely because we will unavoidably face difficult practical\nchoices that force us to stray from them. If The Choice is\nubiquitous, then perhaps we need an ideal not for purposes of\ncan keep in mind \"the difference between what we should\nembrace and what we should only endure.\"\n"
