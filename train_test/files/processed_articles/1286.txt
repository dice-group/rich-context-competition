Stack*\n*Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical School at\nHouston, Houston, Texas; and Regional Kidney Center, Health Services Executive North-West Area, Letterkenny\nGeneral Hospital, Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland\nDifferences in coronary disease have been reported among ethnic minorities in the US population. Whether these persist in\npatients with chronic kidney disease is unknown. The prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) and angina was compared by\nrace and GFR in the Third National   using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\nStudy equation. Age\u00adgender standardized estimates were computed for each GFR category (>90, 60 to 89, and <60 ml/min per\n1.73 m2), and odds ratios were compared using weighted multivariable logistic regression for each race. The age\u00adgender\nand 3.8% in Mexican-American individuals in each category: >90, 60 to 89, and <60 ml/min, respectively. Compared with the\nreferent (Mexican-American; GFR >90 ml/min; odds ratio 1.00), Mexican-American individuals with GFR of 60 to 89 and <60\nml/min had more than four and nine times the odds for MI; black individuals at successively lower GFR levels had 1.6, 6.1,\nand 16.3 times the odds for MI, whereas white individuals had 1.9, 4.7, and 20.2 times that of the referent, respectively. After\nadjustment for traditional risk factors, the inverse association of GFR with MI was substantially attenuated in black and white\nindividuals and completely abolished in Mexican-American individuals. The burden of coronary disease is lower in Mexican-\nAmerican than in white or black individuals with reduced kidney function even accounting for differences in traditional risk\nfactors.\nCardiovascular (CV) mortality rates are exceedingly\nhigh in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) compared with the general population, a phe-\nnomenon that is due partly to the high prevalence of CV\ndisease as well as the strikingly low use of proven cardiovas-\ncular interventions (1\u00ad6). Recent data suggest that the risk for\nCV death is not equal among race groups with reduced kidney\nfunction and may represent inherent differences in underlying\nCV risk as well as differences in access to and use of effective\nCV interventions (6,7). The identification of true differences in\nCV risk factor profiles among race groups and the extent to\nwhich they might account for differences in underlying coro-\nnary disease prevalence may improve our understanding of\ncoronary disease in those with CKD and help unravel racial\ndisparities in CV outcomes.\nIn the general population, Hispanic individuals experience\nlower all-cause and CV mortality rates than their non-Hispanic\ncounterparts (8\u00ad11). This apparent CV benefit is present despite\nthat Hispanics tend to have more unfavorable CV profiles with\nhigher rates of diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance com-\npared with whites or black individuals (12\u00ad15). Moreover, this\n\"paradoxic advantage\" of Hispanic ethnicity over non-His-\npanic persists even when consideration is made for several\nnontraditional CV factors. Although patients with CKD are at\nincreased risk for CV disease overall, it is unclear whether this\nrisk is differentially distributed among racial/ethnic groups. In\naddition, it is unclear whether the favorable risk that is present\nfor Hispanic individuals in the general population also extends\nto those with reduced kidney function.\nThe goals of this study were to (1) describe the prevalence of\nself-reported physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI) and\nangina by race among individuals with reduced kidney function\nin the US population, (2) compare the prevalence of traditional\nrisk factors and nontraditional risk factors among racial/ethnic\ncategories, and (3) determine the extent to which differences in the\nprevalence of MI across race could be accounted for by differences\nin traditional and nontraditional risk factor burden. The oversam-\npling of minorities from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) allowed us a unique oppor-\ntunity to evaluate these differences in patients with reduced kid-\nney function in the US population.\nPublished online ahead of print.

The\nsurvey was designed to provide accurate information on a representa-\ntive sample of noninstitutionalized individuals who were living in the\nhave been published previously. The NHANES III used a complex\nstratified multistage sampling design that included oversampling of the\nvery young, elderly, and ethnic minorities, allowing calculation of\nstable prevalence estimates in these vulnerable groups. Data collection\nconsisted of a standardized questionnaire that was administered dur-\ning a home interview followed by a detailed physical examination that\nincluded collection of blood specimens at a mobile examination center\nor at the participant's home.\nSample\nOur analysis was restricted to adult (20 yr or older), nonpregnant\nparticipants (n  18,595) who reported their race and ethnicity as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican-American (n \n17,885). Respondents who did not participate in the examination com-\nponent (n  1752) or had missing serum creatinine measurements (n \n1123) were excluded. The final sample used in this study contained\nulation.\nMeasurements\nThe NHANES III provided data that were collected from face-to-face\ninterviews, physical examinations, and laboratory results. The follow-\ning self-reported variables were extracted from the interview portion:\nage; gender; race/ethnicity; family history of premature (50 yr) MI;\ntobacco use; physical inactivity; and self-report of a previous physician\ndiagnosis of MI, hypertension, and diabetes. In addition, a diagnosis of\nangina was ascertained from questions based on the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) Rose Angina questionnaire (17). These measures\nhave been used widely to study the prevalence and the natural history\nof ischemic heart disease, to predict morbidity and mortality in diverse\npopulations, and to make population comparisons (18\u00ad20).\nData that were collected from the physical examination included\nheight, weight, waist circumference, and the average of at least three BP\nreadings. Body mass index was classified according to World Health\nOrganization guidelines. Abdominal obesity, defined as a waist circum-\nference (cm) 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women, served as an\nadditional index of overweight.\nWhite blood cells (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum\ncholesterol, and serum creatinine values were obtained from the labo-\nratory results data file. The predictive impact of CRP on MI occurrence\nand its prognostic role in assessing global CV risk has been demon-\nstrated in the general population, and recent studies have validated its\ncontribution in patients with CKD (21\u00ad24). Similarly, emerging data\nhave identified strong associations of elevated WBC count with in-\ncreased CV risk in the general population, although data in CKD\nGFR was estimated from the abbreviated Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease (MDRD) Study formula (28,29) as follows: Estimated\nfemale)  (1.21 if black). Serum creatinine measurements were recali-\nbrated to the Cleveland Clinic to ensure validity of the results (28,29).\nAnalytical Methods\nParticipants were categorized into one of three GFR groups: 90, 60\nspecified categorization would have been desirable, the current classi-\nfication ensured adequate power for comparisons among race groups\nand is consistent with previous studies (31). GFR estimates that were\n200 ml/min were deemed physiologically implausible, and these\npatients were assigned a maximal GFR value of 200 for these analyses.\nThe prevalence of MI, angina, CV risk factors, and inflammatory factors\nwere calculated for the entire cohort and for each GFR category across\nrace groups. To account for age and gender differences in the demo-\ngraphic distribution among racial groups, the prevalence was adjusted\nto a standardized population. The US population during the NHANES\nnon-Hispanic black, 5% Mexican American, and 8% other race or\nethnicity served as the reference standard.\nSeparate univariate and multivariable logistic regression models\nwere developed to explore the associations of GFR with MI for each\nrace group with GFR 90 ml/min as the referent category. Model\nbuilding was based on an a priori decision to include covariates that\npreviously were determined to be associated with MI. All traditional\nfactors and many additional markers of representative measures of\ninflammation were considered. Ultimately, three models were con-\nstructed for each race group: An unadjusted model, a model that\nadjusted for all traditional risk factors, and finally a model that adjusted\nfor traditional factors and inflammatory markers combined. In addi-\ntion, a second series of analyses explored the conjoint associations of\nGFR and race in a single logistic model. For these, Mexican Americans\nwith a GFR 90 ml/min served as the referent category, and all other\nGFR categories within each racial/ethnic group were compared with\nthis referent. All multivariable models were restricted to participants\nwith valid values for all variables, resulting in a final sample size of\n14,043 participants. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable\nSUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) with the appropriate sampling weights and survey\ndesign variables.\nResults\nPrevalence of MI and Angina by Level of GFR\nOf the 15,010 NHANES III participants included in the final\nwhite, 10.9% were black, and 5.1% were Mexican-American.\nThe overall prevalence of MI was 3.6% in black individuals,\n3.5% in white individuals, and 2.5% in Mexican-American in-\ndividuals. The age\u00adgender standardized prevalence of MI in-\ncreased with declining GFR for each racial/ethnic category,\nwith the greatest increases occurring for those with GFR 60\nml/min per 1.73 m2 as shown in Figure 1. Within GFR catego-\nries, prevalence was greatest for black and white individuals\nand lowest for Mexican-American individuals. These differ-\nences were most marked among groups with GFR 60 ml/min,\nin which black individuals (9.9%) had twice the prevalence of\nMI than white individuals (4.9%) and almost three times that of\nMexican-American individuals (3.8%).\nIn contrast to MI, the prevalence of angina did not increase in\na graded manner with declining GFR (Figure 2). Among indi-\nviduals with a GFR 60 ml/min, the prevalence of angina was\nalmost five-fold higher than in Mexican-American individuals\nRacial Differences in the Prevalence of Traditional Risk\nFactors by GFR levels\nThe pattern of association of traditional and nontraditional\nrisk factors with race/ethnicity for each GFR category is shown\nin Table 1. In general, the prevalence of risk factors increased\nwith declining GFR for each race group, although significant\ndifferences were present among groups. Among participants\nwith GFR 60 ml/min, the prevalence of diabetes and hyper-\ntension was greater in Mexican-American and black individu-\nals compared with white individuals. Moreover, mean systolic\nBP and pulse pressure were significantly greater in ethnic mi-\nnorities with GFR 60 ml/min compared with white individ-\nuals. Indeed, when we classified individuals according to the\nstage of hypertension, white individuals with CKD had the\nhighest percentage of patients with normal BP (73.7% in white\nindividuals versus 45% in black individuals and 51% in Mexi-\ncan-American individuals), whereas black and Mexican-Amer-\nican individuals had the highest percentages of individuals\nwith either stage I or II hypertension.\nThe prevalence of tobacco use (current or former smokers)\nwas greater in those with GFR 60 ml/min compared with\nthose with normal kidney function for all race categories.\nWithin race groups, prevalence was greatest in white individ-\nuals (73.1%) and lowest in Mexican-American individuals\nThe prevalence of obesity increased with declining GFR for\nindividuals. Obesity prevalence was highest among white in-\ndividuals (52.6%) and lowest among black individuals (28.6%)\nwith GFR 60 ml/min. The findings were similar when obesity\nwas defined in terms of waist circumference. Physical inactivity\nalso increased with declining GFR for all race categories in the\nUS population. Prevalence of physical inactivity was consis-\ntently highest among Mexican-American individuals and low-\nest among white individuals in each GFR category.\nThe pattern of cholesterol and its subfractions also is dem-\nonstrated in Table 1. Mean serum total cholesterol levels in-\ncreased with declining kidney function and were highest for\nuals and lowest for Mexican-American individuals (213  7.8\nmg/dl). Much of this was attributed to a rise in non-HDL\ncholesterol, for which mean levels were highest in white indi-\nviduals and lowest in Mexican-American individuals with\nCKD. In contrast, HDL levels were lowest in white individuals\nmg/dl) with CKD.\nRacial Differences in the Prevalence of Inflammatory\nMarkers by GFR Level\nOverall, 20.8% of individuals had detectable CRP levels, and\nan additional 7.6% had levels that are considered clinically\nelevated (10.0 mg/L). The prevalence of clinically elevated\nCRP levels was highest in black individuals (12.2%) and lowest\nin white individuals (7.0%). In general, the prevalence of de-\ntectable and clinically elevated CRP increased with declining\nkidney function. The prevalence of clinically elevated CRP was\nhighest in black individuals at each level of GFR and lowest for\nMexican-American individuals with a GFR 60 ml/min. Mean\nvalues of WBC count followed a similar trend, increasing with\ndeclining GFR for all race groups. However, in contrast to CRP\nlevels, mean WBC levels were highest for Mexican-American\nindividuals and lowest for black individuals with CKD.\nMultivariate Models of MI\nResults from the logistic regression analyses are illustrated in\nTable 2. In univariate analysis, white individuals with reduced\nkidney function experienced higher odds of MI (odds ratio\nFigure 1.

Among white individuals, the\nthe discrimination index of the models was excellent, ranging\nfrom 82.1% in white individuals to 86.8% in black individuals.\nFurthermore, in the fully adjusted model, in which we included\nadditional covariates that represented CRP and WBC count, the\nassociations of GFR with MI in each group were virtually un-\nchanged and the c-statistic showed no further improvement.\nThe conjoint associations of race and GFR with likelihood of MI\nare demonstrated in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. In univariate\nanalysis, Mexican-American individuals with a GFR of 60 to 89\nand 60/ml per min had more than four times and nine times the\nodds of MI, respectively, compared with the referent category\n(Mexican-American individuals with GFR 90 ml/min, OR 1.00).\nFor black individuals, the likelihood of MI at each GFR category\nwere 1.6, 6.1, and 16 times higher than the referent, whereas for\nwhite individuals, the corresponding odds were 1.9, 4.7, and 20\ntimes higher, respectively. With adjustment for traditional risk\nfactors and inflammatory markers, the magnitude and strength of\nthese associations were substantially reduced in white and black\nindividuals and were completely abolished in Mexican-American\nindividuals (Figure 4).\nTable 1.

As GFR declined,\nthe prevalence of MI increased disproportionately among\nwhite, black, and Mexican-American individuals. Within GFR\ncategory, overall MI prevalence was significantly lower in Mex-\nican-American compared with black or white individuals, and\nthese differences were most pronounced among those with\nCKD. Moreover, the finding of lower prevalence of MI in\nMexican-American individuals despite having an excess of sev-\neral traditional risk factors was consistent with what literature\nhas labeled the \"Hispanic paradox\" (32). Finally, our study\nfound that a large percentage of coronary disease in black and\nwhite individuals with reduced kidney function was accounted\nfor by traditional risk factors, and an even larger percentage\nTable 2.

The referent\ngroup, with which all other groups are compared, is Mexican-\nthat was found in Mexican-American individuals was ex-\nplained by these same risk factors. These observations suggest\nthat whereas declining kidney function is accompanied by in-\ncreasing prevalence of coronary disease and associated risk\nfactors in all race groups, Mexican-American individuals seem\nto be protected despite their unfavorable CV profiles.\nRecent studies have demonstrated a graded association of\nreduced kidney function with increased CV risk, suggesting\nthat loss of renal function in itself may independently predict\nCV outcomes (33\u00ad36). Many of these studies have focused on\nthe magnitude of risk in diverse populations and its prognostic\nimportance. An unanswered question, however, is whether CV\nrisk profiles among individuals with reduced GFR differ by\nrace and whether such differences contribute to clinically im-\nportant differences in CV disease prevalence. In this analysis of\nNHANES data, we demonstrated that although a reduction in\nGFR was associated with increased coronary prevalence, sig-\nnificant race differences were found. We speculated that these\ndifferences might be accounted for by differential increases\neither in traditional risk factors or in inflammatory factors.\nSurprising, the prevalence of several Framingham risk factors\nwas higher in Mexican-American individuals or at least equal\nto those in black or in white individuals, especially among\nthose with CKD. Diabetes and physical inactivity were far more\nprevalent in Hispanic individuals with CKD. Moreover, hyper-\ntension as defined by history or by BP measurements and\nobesity as defined by elevated body mass index or increased\nwaist circumference were higher or equal to those of other race\ngroups. These observations are consistent with the theory that\nMexican-American individuals, despite having adverse CV risk\nprofiles, especially with regard to the distribution of traditional\nrisk factors, have \"paradoxically\" better CV outcomes\nThe low prevalence of coronary disease among Mexican-\nAmerican individuals compared with other race groups also\nmay reflect favorable distributions of some traditional risk fac-\ntors. First, nonsmokers were more common among Mexican-\nAmerican individuals with CKD than other racial groups.\nMean values for total serum cholesterol also were significantly\nlower in Hispanic individuals. Perhaps even more important,\nmean values for non-HDL cholesterol, a more accurate measure\nof atherogenic lipoprotein burden, were lower in the Mexican-\nAmerican individuals with CKD compared with their counter-\nparts. Finally, CRP, an emerging nontraditional CV risk factor,\nwas lower in Mexican-American individuals than in other race\ngroups in the CKD setting. The combined contributions of these\nfavorable risk profiles may reflect in part a lower disease bur-\nden in Mexican-American individuals and protect against fu-\nture CV events.\nIn the general population, conflicting opinions exist as to\nwhether Mexican-American individuals are at greater or lesser\nrisk for CV disease compared with other racial groups. On the\none hand, data from some cohort studies have demonstrated\nhigher incidence rates of CV events among Hispanic individu-\nals, findings that certainly are consistent with their adverse CV\nrisk profiles (38\u00ad41). On the other hand, recent comparisons of\nCV risk indicators have found lower levels of carotid intima\nmedia thickness and lower coronary calcium scores in Mexican-\nAmerican individuals compared with non-Hispanic white in-\ndividuals, findings that favor CV protection (42,43). However,\nunlike the general population, individuals with reduced kidney\nfunction have considerably increased CV risk. Whether find-\nings in the general population can be extended to those with\nreduced kidney function is not entirely clear. Our analysis\nfound lower prevalence of clinical coronary disease among\nMexican-American individuals with CKD compared with black\nor white individuals and is consistent with the theory of CV\nprotection as proposed in the general population. It is unclear,\nhowever, whether this observation represents low incident\nrates of coronary disease as a result of favorable distribution of\nCV risk factors or even high mortality rates from fatal coronary\ndisease, which also could lead to the same result as suggested\nin a recent paper by Muntner et al. (35).\nThis study has several limitations. First, the principal out-\ncome was based on self-report, whereby individuals were in-\nformed by their physician of the diagnosis with potential for\nrecall and misclassification bias. Racial differences in knowl-\nedge of MI could bias the reported prevalence. The requirement\nthat a diagnosis of MI be made by a physician should narrow\nthe variability in knowledge between racial groups, although\nracial differences in help-seeking patterns and access to care\nremained. The prevalence of angina showed a significantly\nhigher prevalence in minority groups than in white individual,\nsuggesting that the true prevalence of MI may be biased down-\nward in minority group. Although no validation studies were\nconducted independently for self-reported disease in the\nNHANES, previous validation studies in equally large samples\nFurthermore, although this may result in a nondifferential mis-\nclassification of MI, it usually underestimates rather than over-\nestimates the true OR.\nSecond, kidney function was estimated using the MDRD\nformula, a prediction equation that was developed in individ-\nuals with reduced kidney function and consisted only of white\nand black individuals (29). Although we assumed that Mexi-\ncan-American individuals are similar to white individuals\nwhen estimating GFR using this equation, future studies are\nrequired to confirm this. Furthermore, this equation's accuracy\nis greatest among those with moderate reductions in kidney\nfunction and is less precise for predicting GFR at higher levels\n(47). Third, despite the oversampling of minorities in NHANES\nIII, sufficient numbers were not available to assess prevalence\nestimates in GFR categories of 30 and 15 ml/min. Finally,\nthe cross-sectional design of the NHANES study limited causal\ninference. The findings from this cross-sectional analysis, how-\never, provide important information for the design of future\nlongitudinal studies.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this study has several\nstrengths. First, it is the most comprehensive national survey to\nestimate coronary disease prevalence among race groups with\nreduced kidney function. Second, the oversampling of minority\ngroups in NHANES III allowed for accurate estimation of dis-\nease prevalence for all race groups by GFR. Third, the avail-\nability of extensive and complete data on a range of CV risk\nfactors, both traditional and inflammatory, allowed us to assess\ntheir combined associations with coronary disease.\nThis study highlights significant differences in the prevalence\nof clinical coronary disease among race groups in the adult US\npopulation with reduced kidney function. Although the prev-\nalence increased with declining kidney function in each group,\nincreases were lowest in Mexican-American individuals. It is\nplausible that favorable distributions of some traditional and\nnovel risk factors accounted for the lower prevalence in Mexi-\ncan-American individuals compared with other race groups.\nThese results support the continuing Hispanic paradox of CV\nprotection in Hispanic individuals with CKD that is seen in the\ngeneral population despite adverse CV risk profiles. Future\nstudies should assess whether these findings translate into\nfewer CV events for Mexican-American individuals using pro-\nspectively designed cohorts.\n"
