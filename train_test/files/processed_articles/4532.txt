Previous studies reported\nbehavioral oscillations using target detection tasks. Whether the influence of periodic attention\nextends to cognitively demanding tasks remains unclear. To assess this, we examined the effects of\nperiodic attention on the perception of duration. In the experiment, participants performed a\ntemporal bisection task while a cue was presented with various cue-to-target intervals.

The phenomenon of duration distortion has long\nbeen used to investigate mechanisms of duration perception in the millisecond range.\nDuration distortion refers to the phenomenon whereby perceived duration deviates from\nphysical duration. For example, flickering stimuli (Hashimoto & Yotsumoto, 2015; Herbst,\nJavadi, van der Meer, & Busch, 2013), adaptation to a specific duration (Heron et al., 2012;\nShima, Murai, Hashimoto, & Yotsumoto, 2016), adaptation to a specific temporal frequency\n(Johnston, Arnold, & Nishida, 2006), and the eccentricity of the stimulus (Kliegl & Huckauf,\n2014) have all been shown to distort perceived duration; the knowledge obtained from these\nstudies has contributed to revealing the mechanisms of time perception.\nAttention is also a factor that alters perceived duration. Many studies have reported that\nthe duration of an attended stimulus is perceived as longer than an unattended stimulus. For\nexample, an oddball stimulus, which attracts more attention, embedded in a sequence of\nstandard stimuli is perceived as longer than a standard stimulus (Tse, Intriligator, Rivest, &\nThe overestimation of duration for an attended stimulus has also been reported using the\nPosner cueing paradigm. In a typical Posner cueing task, a brief flash called an attentional cue\nis first presented on either side of a fixation point. Then, a target stimulus is presented on the\nsame or opposite side of the attentional cue. The participants are instructed to detect the\ntarget stimulus as fast as possible. Previous studies have shown an attentional facilitation\nsuch that the reaction time was faster when the target stimulus was presented in the same side\nas the attentional cue (cued location) than when the target stimulus was presented opposite of\nthe attentional cue (uncued location; Chica, Martin-Arevalo, Botta, & Lupianez, 2014;\nPosner & Cohen, 1984). Studies using the Posner cueing paradigm to measure time\nperception require participants to judge the duration of the target stimulus. These studies\nhave shown that the target stimulus presented on the cued location is perceived longer (Enns,\nThese attention-induced distortions of perceived duration can be explained not only by the\ndistortion of the duration itself but also by the misperception of the stimulus onset or offset.\nIn fact, attention is known to alter the temporal resolution of vision (Hein, Rolke, & Ulrich,\n2006; Rolke, Dinkelbach, Hein, & Ulrich, 2008). For example, the onset of the attended\nstimulus can be perceived earlier (Enns et al., 1997; Rolke, Ulrich, & Bausenhart, 2006;\nShore, Spence, & Klein, 2001), while the offset of the attended stimulus can be perceived\nlater (Rolke et al., 2006). However, it should be noted that the perceived onset and offset\ntiming alone do not determine the perceived duration. For example, the interval between the\nperceived onset and the perceived offset does not necessarily match the perceived duration\n(Bendixen, Grimm, & Schro\n\u00a8 ger, 2006). Furthermore, duration distortion can be observed\nwithout changes in the perceived timing of the onset or offset (Johnston et al., 2006; Kaneko\nIn a classical Posner cueing paradigm, a shortening of the interval between the attentional\ncue and the target onset (cue-to-target interval) leads to a faster reaction time in the cued\n2 i-Perception\nversus uncued location (attentional facilitation). Conversely, when the cue-to-target interval\nis long, the reaction time is slower in the cued versus uncued location (inhibition of return\n[IOR]; Posner & Cohen, 1984). Recently, periodic fluctuations in behavioral performance\nhave been reported using densely sampled cue-to-target intervals in the Posner\nSong, Meng, Chen, Zhou, & Luo, 2014). This periodic fluctuation, called behavioral\noscillation, is different from the classical time course of attention (attentional facilitation\nand IOR) in that the behavioral oscillation has higher frequencies of performance\nfluctuation. It has been suggested that these behavioral oscillations reflect the periodic\nmechanism of attention (VanRullen, Carlson, & Cavanagh, 2007; VanRullen & Dubois,\n2011). Studies of behavioral oscillation report performance fluctuations at the theta\nfrequencies (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013; Hickok, Farahbod, & Saberi, 2015; Landau & Fries,\n2012; Tomassini, Spinelli, Jacono, Sandini, & Morrone, 2015) or at the alpha frequencies\nbehavioral oscillation occurs in antiphase between the cued and uncued locations (Landau &\nFries, 2012), suggesting that once the attentional cue attracts attention to the cued location,\nattention is alternately directed to cued and uncued locations.\nThe purpose of this study was twofold. The first aim was to investigate the periodic\nmechanism of attention. Most studies of behavioral oscillation employ a simple target\ndetection task with brief target stimuli. However, it is unknown if the behavioral\noscillation observed in that task can also be observed in cognitively demanding tasks with\nlonger target stimuli. Such differences in task and target duration are known to alter the effect\nof attention. For example, IOR occurs earlier in detection tasks than in discrimination tasks\n\u00b4 n\n~ ez, Mila\n\u00b4 n, Tornay, Madrid, & Tudela, 1997). Also, a longer target\nduration induces stronger attentional facilitation than brief target duration\n(Marti\u00b4n-Are\n\u00b4 valo, Chica, & Lupia\n\u00b4 n\n~ ez, 2013; Maruff, Yucel, Danckert, Stuart, & Currie,\n1999). In this study, we investigated whether the periodic mechanism of attention\ninfluences performance on the duration judgment task, which is cognitively demanding\nwith a longer target durations. If periodic attention influences the perception of duration,\nthe perceived duration of a target stimulus presented after the attentional cue should fluctuate\nrhythmically as a function of the cue-to-target interval.\nThe second aim of our study was to investigate the role of periodic attention on duration\nperception. As mentioned previously, attention distorts perceived duration by distorting\nperceived duration itself or by misperception of the onset or offset of a stimulus. In this\nstudy, we investigated whether the perception of duration was influenced by periodic\nattention to the timing of the stimulus onset. The cue-to-target interval was defined as the\ninterval between the attentional cue and the target onset. The cue-to-target interval was\nsampled densely to carefully manipulate attention to target onset timing.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTen students from the University of Tokyo (one author and nine naive participants, eight\nmales and two females, two left-handed and eight right-handed individuals, 21.2 \u00c6 1.2 years\nof age) participated in this experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the experiment in\naccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the institutional\nreview boards of the University of Tokyo, and all experiments were carried out in accordance\nwith the guidelines set by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo.\nShima et al. 3\nApparatus\nStimuli were generated using Matlab [v. 2012b], Psychtoolbox [v. 3.0.11], Palamedes toolbox\nmonitor (DiamondtronM2 RDF223H, Mitsubishi, Tokyo, Japan) controlled by iMac OS X\ndark room. The viewing distance was 57.3 cm, and participants were asked to stabilize their\nhead on a chin rest.\nStimuli\nThe stimuli used in this experiment are shown in Figure 1. The standard and target stimuli\nwere white disks (92 cd/m2, 4 in diameter) presented on either side of the fixation point\nfixation point and the center of the disk was 5. The fixation point was presented at the center\nof the screen throughout the sessions. The attentional cue was a white rectangle (92 cd/m2,\n4 \u00c2 1) briefly presented (50 ms) on either side of the fixation point. The distance between the\ncenter of the fixation point and the closer side of the rectangle was 8.\nProcedure\nParticipants performed a temporal bisection task which was composed of a learning phase\nand a testing phase. In the learning phase, a short standard stimulus (325 ms) and a long\nstandard stimulus (775 ms) were randomly presented on either side of the fixation point at the\ncenter of the screen. Participants were asked to learn these two standard durations and\nindicate whether the presented stimulus was short or long by pressing a button. After the\nlearning phase, a testing phase started. The attentional cue was briefly presented on either\nFigure 1. The stimuli used in the experiment. Left: The attentional cue was briefly presented on either side of\nthe fixation point. Right: Following the cue and cue-to-target interval, a target stimulus was presented on either\nside of the fixation point.

In the uncued condition, they were presented on the opposite side (dashed lines).\n4 i-Perception\nside of the fixation point. Following the cue, a target stimulus was presented on either side of\nthe fixation point. The duration of the target stimulus was chosen randomly from seven\ndurations (325\u00ad775 ms, 75-ms step), and the cue-to-target interval (interval between the\nonset of the attentional cue and the onset of the target stimulus) was randomly chosen\nwas presented on the same side as the attentional cue (cued location). In the uncued\ncondition, it was presented on the opposite side of the attentional cue (uncued location).\nParticipants were asked to judge which of the two standard durations from the learning phase\nmost closely matched the duration of the target stimulus. The intertrial interval (interval\nbetween the response and the onset of the attentional cue in the next trial) was randomly\nParticipants registered their responses by pressing an up-arrow key or a down-arrow key\nwith the forefinger of their dominant hand. The key assignments were counterbalanced across\nparticipants. They were also instructed to fixate on the fixation point throughout the sessions\nand to not count the durations (Rattat & Droit-Volet, 2012).\nThe number of trials in the testing phase was 9,240, and these trials were divided into\n60 blocks across 10 days, resulting in 154 trials per block and 6 blocks per day. Half of the\ntrials were cued conditions, and the other half were uncued conditions. The cued trials and\nthe uncued trials were randomly presented. The number of trials per target duration per cue-\nto-target interval was 20. To learn and retain the internal representation of the standard\ndurations, learning phases were embedded in the testing phase. Each block was separated\ninto four parts, and learning phases were inserted at the beginning of each part: 12 learning\ntrials were inserted before the first trial of each block, and 4 learning trials were inserted\nOn the first day of the experiment, participants underwent a practice block with 140 trials\nto accustom themselves to the temporal bisection task before the main experiment. Thus, the\nnumber of blocks on the first day was seven: one practice block and six experimental blocks.\nThe procedure was the same as the main experiment except that the attentional cue was not\npresented before the target stimulus.\nData Analysis\nTo improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we performed a binning procedure used in Fiebelkorn\nmerged per target duration, and these merged trials were considered as trials from the 275-ms\ncue-to-target interval. This 50-ms bin was shifted forward by 25 ms, and trials from the 275 -,\n300 -, and 325-ms cue-to-target intervals were merged per target duration and considered as\ntrials from the 300-ms cue-to-target interval. This procedure was repeated throughout the\nduration of the cue-to-target interval (250\u00ad1,050 ms). As a result, cue-to-target intervals\ntrials per cue-to-target interval was 20 per one target duration. After binning, the number\nof trials per cue-to-target interval increased to 60 per one target duration.\nIn each cue-to-target interval, the proportions of long responses were calculated for each\ntarget duration, plotted as a function of target duration, and then fit with a cumulative\nnormal distribution function:\ny \u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\np\nZ\nx\nexp \u00c0\n \nShima et al. 5\n. Next, the parameters  and  were estimated. Fitting and estimation were conducted using\nPalamedes toolbox for Matlab (Prins & Kingdom, 2009). The parameter , which\nindicates the duration that gives 50% long responses, was determined as the bisection\npoint at a particular cue-to-target interval and indicated perceived duration. The bisection\npoints were calculated for each cue-to-target interval and calculated separately for cued\nand uncued conditions.\nAfter estimating the bisection points, we tested whether the bisection points of the cued\nand uncued conditions fluctuated rhythmically. The fluctuation of bisection points may\ncontain both the slower temporal component reflecting the classical time course of\nattention (attentional facilitation and IOR) and the faster temporal component reflecting\nperiodic attention. We first removed this slower component by detrending with a first-\norder linear function and filtered by a third-order Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency:\n3 Hz; see Fiebelkorn et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014). A single-frequency sine function was\nthen fit to this high-passed fluctuation of bisection points in each condition and in each\nparticipant with the least squares method. The best fit frequency of the sine function was\nestimated. The coefficient of determination (R2) of this fitting procedure was used as an index\nof periodicity in the bisection points (de Graaf et al., 2013; Fiebelkorn et al., 2011; Picazio\nP\nyi\n\u00c0 ^\nyi\nP\nyi \u00c0 \nyi\ngroup R2 \u00bc\nP\nindividual R2\nn\nwhere yi\nis the bisection point at the ith cue-to-target interval, ^\nyi\nis the value of the fit sine\nfunction at the ith cue-to-target interval, \ny is the mean of the bisection points across all cue-\nto-target intervals, and n is the number of participants. Note that the group R2 value was the\nsimple mean of the individual R2 values, thus the fitting of psychometric functions,\ndetrending, and the fitting of sine functions were always performed at an individual level.\nThe individual R2 and group R2 show the extent to which the single-frequency sine function\nfits the fluctuation of bisection points at an individual level and at a group level, respectively\n(Fiebelkorn et al., 2011). In other words, a significantly high R2 value indicates rhythmic\nfluctuation of the bisection points.\nPermutation testing was conducted to test whether the R2 value was statistically\nsignificant. The proportion of long responses was permutated across cue-to-target\nintervals, before applying the 50-ms binning process. This permutation procedure was\nconducted separately for each participant and target duration. The permutated data were\nthen binned, and the R2 value was calculated for each permutation. After 2,500 iterations, a\nsampling distribution of R2 values was constructed. If the R2 value from the real data set was\nlarger than the top 5% of R2 values from the sampling distribution, the R2 value was\nconsidered to be significant. We analyzed not only raw bisection points but also the\ndifference between bisection points in the cued and uncued conditions to determine\nthe spatial effect of attention. After calculating the difference in bisection points' between\nthe two conditions, the same procedure (fitting to a single-frequency sine function, R2 value\ncalculation, and permutation testing) was conducted.\nLandau and Fries (2012) reported that the effect of periodic attention is stronger when the\nattentional cue is presented on the right hemifield. To confirm this attentional benefit, the\nsame analysis was conducted only using trials in which the attentional cue was presented on\n6 i-Perception\nthe right hemifield. In addition, we investigated whether discrimination accuracy fluctuated\nrhythmically. The slope of the psychometric function (i.e., the parameter ) was regarded as\nan indicator of discrimination accuracy. The same procedure was conducted to the slope\nparameters in the cued and the uncued conditions, and the difference in slopes between the\ncued and the uncued conditions.\nIn addition to the analysis of periodicity, the classical time course of attention, such as\nattentional facilitation and IOR, was also examined via a two-way repeated measures\nanalysis of covariance. The null hypothesis was that there would be no bisection point\ndifference between the cued and uncued conditions and no linear trend of the bisection\npoint sequences. The factors were 2 conditions (cued and uncued) \u00c2 31 cue-to-target\nintervals.\nResults\nPsychometric functions in a typical participant are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The\nfluctuation of bisection points in the cued and the uncued conditions in a typical participant\nis shown in Figure 2 and in all participants in Supplementary Figure 2. After detrending with\na first-order linear function, filtered by a third-order Butterworth filter, and fitting to a single-\nfrequency sine function, the R2 value was calculated. The fit results for all participants in the\ncued and the uncued conditions are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. Group-level\npermutation testing showed that the group R2 value for the observed data was\nsignificantly higher than that of the permutated data in the cued condition (p \u00bc .029) but\nnot in the uncued condition nor in the difference between bisection points (p > .05; Figure 3).\nThis result indicates that single-frequency sine functions fit well with the fluctuation of\nbisection points in the cued condition at a group level. In other words, the bisection points\nfluctuated rhythmically as a function of the cue-to-target interval. In addition, to determine\nwhether such rhythmic fluctuations were observed at an individual level, individual\npermutation testing was conducted using individual R2 values. R2 values were not\nFigure 2. The bisection points as a function of the cue-to-target interval in a typical participant. The red\nlines show the cued condition and the blue lines show the uncued condition.\nShima et al. 7\nsignificant in almost all participants (p > .05) except one participant in the cued condition\n(p \u00bc .01) and one participant in the difference between bisection points (p \u00bc .05). These results\nindicate that single-frequency sine functions did not fit well with the fluctuation of the\nbisection points at an individual level. Therefore, the rhythmic fluctuation of the bisection\npoints could not be observed at an individual level. The frequencies of the sine function, R2\nvalues, and p values calculated for both group and individual assessments are shown in\nSupplementary Table 1. In the cued condition, the frequencies of the best fit sine functions\nwere around the theta band (4.9 \u00c6 1.5 Hz (SD)). In addition, the group R2 values were\ncalculated with the same procedure using trials where the attentional cue was presented in\nthe right hemifield only. No significant difference was found in any conditions (p > .05). Also,\nwe did not observe significant periodic fluctuations of the slope parameters in any conditions\nThe bisection points between the cued and the uncued conditions were also compared\n(Figure 4). A two-way repeated measures analysis of covariance revealed a significant\ndifference in the bisection points between the cued and the uncued conditions, F(1,9) \u00bc 35.7,\nFigure 3.

It was found that perceived duration fluctuated rhythmically as a\nfunction of cue-to-target interval in the cued condition at a group level but not at an\nindividual level. Periodic fluctuations in behavioral performance have been reported using\nrather simple target detection tasks for briefly presented target stimuli. Although previous\nresearch on spatial attention has pointed out that longer target duration and difficult tasks\nalter, or sometimes negate, the effect of attention (Klein, 2000; Marti\u00b4n-Are\nMaruff et al., 1999), here we suggested the possibility that the periodic mechanism\nof attention also influences the performance of a cognitively demanding task such as the\nduration perception task.\nIn the experiment, attention to the timing of the target onset was manipulated by densely\nsampled cue-to-target intervals. We will introduce two explanations for the periodic\nfluctuation of perceived duration. One is that attention to the timing of the target onset\nAlthough the perceived onset timing itself was not measured directly in our study, altered\nperceived onset could influence perceived duration. The other plausible explanation is that\nattention to the timing of the target onset altered the perceived duration itself and not via the\nchange in the perceived onset timing. Further research is needed to dissociate these two\npossibilities.\nThe results of our study can be interpreted in the context of the pacemaker\u00adaccumulator\nmodel (Gibbon, Church, & Meck, 1984; Treisman, 1963) that is one of the classical models\nFigure 4. Averaged data across all cue-to-target intervals. Left: The averaged bisection points. Right: The\naveraged psychometric functions across all cue-to-target intervals and all participants. Red shows the cued\ncondition and blue shows the uncued condition. Solid black lines indicate bisection points and dashed black\nline indicates intermediate target duration.\nShima et al. 9\nfor time perception. This model includes three components: the pacemaker that emits pulses\nto the accumulator and switch that lies between the pacemaker and accumulator. When we\nstart measuring time, the switch is turned on and the accumulator starts to accumulate pulses\nfrom the pacemaker. When we stop measuring time, the switch is turned off, and the pulses\nfrom the pacemaker are stopped and are no longer transmitted to the accumulator. The\nnumber of accumulated pulses represents perceived duration. The attentional-gate model\n(Zakay & Block, 1995) suggests that the switch is influenced by attention. When attention\nis directed to the target stimulus, the switch can be turned on earlier and pulse transmission\ncan start sooner. The accumulator can then accumulate more pulses that result in longer\nperceived duration. If periodic attention alters the switch onset timing, the number of\naccumulated pulses would fluctuate periodically, which would result in the periodic\nfluctuation of perceived duration.\nSome studies have assumed that the frequency of behavioral oscillation is the same\nbetween individuals, and their analyses were conducted to fit only one frequency to the\ngroup-level mean of behavioral performance (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013; Landau & Fries,\n2012). In contrast, other studies report that the frequencies of behavioral oscillations are\nIn our experiment, different frequencies were fit to each individual's data, as in Fiebelkorn\net al. (2011), to observe behavioral oscillations both when the frequencies of behavioral\noscillations are the same across individuals and when the frequencies of behavioral\noscillations are different across individuals. As a result, in the cued condition, we observed\nbehavioral fluctuations at theta frequencies, which are consistent with studies that reported\nbehavioral oscillations using target detection tasks (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013; Landau & Fries,\nSignificant behavioral oscillations were not detected at the individual level in our study,\nwhich may be due to the effect size of behavioral oscillation. In fact, many studies only report\nbehavioral oscillation at a group level and not at an individual level (Drewes, Zhu, Wutz, &\n2012). A group-level analysis has greater statistical power than an individual analysis (Biau,\nKerne\n\u00b4 is, & Porcher, 2008), which may lead to detection of behavioral oscillation despite a\nsmall effect size. In this study, the observed amplitude of the individual fluctuation of\nbisection points was small (\u00c66 ms) relative to standard durations (325 ms and 775 ms), and\nstandard error of each bisection point was at around \u00c68 ms. Such a small effect size might be\nthe reason why behavioral oscillations were not detected at the individual level in our\nexperiment.\nWe speculate that the small effect size might be a result of the experimental manipulation.\nFor example, when the onsets of seven target durations were aligned, the offsets were not\ntemporally aligned. This problem was inevitable because seven target durations had to be\nused to calculate a psychometric function for each cue-to-target interval in the temporal\nbisection task. There are tasks that only require one target duration such as the temporal\nreproduction task; however, we did not use the temporal reproduction task because it is\nknown to have reproduction bias, especially in subsecond durations when participants\nreproduce the duration by pressing a button (Shi, Ganzenmu\n\u00a8 ller, & Mu\nAnother plausible reason for the small effect size could be the large number of trials\nrequired to complete the experiments. In the experiment, participants performed six blocks\nper day, which took 1.5 hr each day, for 10 days. The prolonged experimental sessions seem\nto have induced a learning effect. Bisection points obtained in the first day were smaller\nthan bisection points obtained in the last day, t(9) \u00bc 2.63, p \u00bc .027, while the difference in\nbisection points between the cued and uncued conditions was not different between the\nfirst and last days, t(9) \u00bc 1.33, p \u00bc .21. This learning effect was represented by the change in\nthe bisection point itself, not the change in the fluctuation of bisection points, indicating that\nthe learning effect did not influence periodic attention. However, such a long experiment\nmight result in a practice effect that decreased the effect of attention (Lupia\n\u00b4 n\n~ ez, Weaver,\nTipper, & Madrid, 2001) and led to a decrease in periodic attention. This problem was\ninevitable because many cue-to-target intervals had to be used to observe high-frequency\nbehavioral oscillations. Similarly, multiple long durations had to be used in order to estimate\na psychometric function.\nThe effect of periodic attention is known to be stronger in the right hemifield than in the\nleft hemifield (Landau & Fries, 2012). To determine whether such an attentional benefit\nexisted in our experiment, we conducted the same analysis using only trials in which the\nattentional cue was presented in the right hemifield. However, we did not find periodic\nfluctuations of perceived duration in either hemifield. To evaluate the hemifield-specific\neffect in this analysis, the number of trials had to be cut by half, which decreased the\neffect size. More trials will be required to examine hemifield-specific effects.\nAs saccadic eye movement can also affect duration perception (Morrone, Ross, & Burr,\n2005), some may wonder whether behavioral oscillations might have resulted from\neye movements. Several studies observed behavioral oscillations after excluding trials with\neye movement, suggesting that behavioral oscillations are not completely a result of eye\nSeveral previous studies suggested that behavioral oscillation is associated with neural\noscillation. For example, the frequency of behavioral oscillation correlates with individual\nalpha frequency in the brain (de Graaf et al., 2013; Romei et al., 2012). A study reported that\nbehavioral oscillation derives from entrainment of neural activity in the visual cortex to\nexternal flickering stimuli (Spaak et al., 2014). Behavioral performance correlates with the\nphase of neural oscillation following particular timing (Busch, Dubois, & VanRullen, 2009;\nBusch & VanRullen, 2010; Landau, Schreyer, van Pelt, & Fries, 2015; Sherman, Kanai, Seth,\n& VanRullen, 2016). Future studies should investigate the neural implementation of periodic\nattention altering perceived duration.\nAttention-induced distortion of perceived duration can be induced not only by\nmisperception of the onset but also by misperception of the stimulus offset (Enns et al.,\nattention on the timing of target onset in the perception of duration by densely sampling\nintervals between the attentional cue and target onset. Further studies will be needed to\ndiscuss the effects of periodic attention on the target offset.\nBias Induced by an Attentional Cue Might Explain Shorter Perceived Duration in\nthe Cued Condition\nBisection points were larger in the cued condition than in the uncued condition. In other\nwords, perceived duration was shorter in the cued condition than in the uncued condition.\nThis result is inconsistent with studies that report an expansion of perceived duration in the\ncued compared to uncued condition (Enns et al., 1997; Mattes & Ulrich, 1998; Seifried &\ncompression that induces shorter perceived duration in the cued condition than in the\nuncued condition when the cue-to-target interval is long (Osugi, Takeda, & Murakami,\n2016). To test this possibility, we conducted an additional experiment with a shorter cue-\nto-target interval (50 ms). The detailed experimental procedure and results are provided in\nSupplementary Materials. We did not observe a longer perceived duration in the cued\ncondition even in the short cue-to-target interval. This result denied the possibility of IOR-\ninduced duration compression. The perceived duration was shorter in the cued condition\nindependently of the cue-to-target interval.\nAn alternative explanation for the shorter perceived duration in the cued condition is a\nbias induced by an attentional cue. In the cued condition, an attentional cue was presented in\nthe same location as the target stimulus. The short duration of the attentional cue (50 ms)\nmight bias participants' judgment about the duration of the subsequent target, if presented in\nthe same location, as being shorter. Such bias has been reported in one previous study\n(Wiener, Thompson, & Branch Coslett, 2014).\nWe did not observe the typical attentional effect (i.e., duration expansion in the cued\ncondition); thus, the typical attentional effect may be obscured by bias induced by the\nattentional cue. This does not necessarily deny the possibility of periodic attentional\nmodulation; periodic attention and bias can occur simultaneously because attention-induced\nduration distortion is a perceptual phenomenon and bias is a cognitive phenomenon (Wiener\net al., 2014). In addition, some behavioral oscillation studies reported periodic attention but not\ntypical attentional effects (Fiebelkorn et al., 2013; Landau & Fries, 2012). They indicate that\nperiodic attention can occur even in the absence of typical attentional effects. In fact, some\nstudies report behavioral oscillations that do not reflect periodic attentional modulation but\nrather reflect periodic modulation of visual processing such as priming (Huang, Chen, & Luo,\n2015) or visual categorization (Drewes et al., 2015). Therefore, the results reported in this study\ndo not deny the possibility that the observed oscillation reflects a periodic modulation of other\ntypes of visual processing but not attention.\nOne candidate for a periodically modulated visual processing is duration perception.\nUsing a priming task, Huang et al. (2015) interpreted the behavioral modulations as the\nperiodic modulation of priming. Also, using a visual categorization task, Drewes et al.\n(2015) interpreted the behavioral modulations as the periodic modulation of visual\ncategorization. By the same logic, using a duration perception task, our results can be\ninterpreted as the periodic modulation of duration perception. If periodic mechanism\nexists in the duration perception, it would periodically change the perceived duration\ndirectly not via periodic changes of attention. Further study is needed to explore what was\nactually modulated during periodic fluctuation of the perceived duration.\nPeriodic Fluctuation of Perceived Duration Was Observed Only in the Cued Condition\nIn this study, significant behavioral oscillation was observed only in the cued condition. This\nresult is partially inconsistent with Landau and Fries (2012) who reported that the behavioral\noscillations were in antiphase between the cued and uncued locations and concluded that\nmultiple locations were alternately attended to. To explain this discrepancy, we need to\nassume multiple periodic attentional mechanisms for different locations, instead of one\nperiodic attentional mechanism with a periodic spatial modulation. Fiebelkorn et al. (2013)\nreported behavioral oscillation only in the uncued condition and not in the cued condition.\nThey also reported that the frequencies of behavioral oscillations in the uncued condition differ\ndepending on the location relative to the cue. Their study suggested multiple periodic\nattentional modulations in different locations relative to the cue not one periodic attentional\nmodulation mechanism that alternately attends to multiple locations. If different periodic\nattentional mechanisms separately regulate behavioral oscillations of perceived duration in\nthe cued and uncued locations, periodic fluctuations would not necessarily be antiphase but\ncould have different characteristics between in the cued condition and in the uncued condition.\nUnder this assumption, the reason of periodic fluctuation being observed only in the cued\ncondition can be explained by the stimulus property used in our study. The effect of attention\nis known to decrease when the size of the attentional focus is larger because attention is\nallocated evenly across the broad area (Castiello & Umilta\nconfiguration of the Posner cueing paradigm, placeholders marked the location where the\ntarget stimulus would appear (Chica et al., 2014) and restricted the size of the attentional\nfocus in both cued and uncued locations. In the present experiment, such placeholders\nindicating potential target positions were not used, in an attempt to simplify stimulus sets.\nInstead of placeholders, the attentional cue might work as the location cue that restricted the\nsize of the attentional focus in the cued location, and the size of the attentional focus was\nrestricted near the position of the attentional cue. However, the attentional cue could not\nrestrict the size of the attentional focus in the uncued location, and therefore, the attention\nmight be allocated evenly within the side of the screen opposite to the attentional cue. In the\ncued condition, the target stimulus was presented in the cued location, where the size of the\nattentional focus was restricted. Thus, the effect of attention might not decrease in the cued\ncondition. On the other hand, in the uncued condition, the target stimulus was presented in\nthe uncued location, where the size of the attentional focus was not restricted. Thus,\ndecreased attentional effects in the uncued location could have made the behavioral\noscillation in the uncued condition unobservable.\nConclusion\nWe investigated whether the perception of duration is influenced by periodic attention.\nPerceived duration fluctuated rhythmically as a function of the cue-to-target interval\nonly in the cued condition. This result suggested the possibility that perceived duration is\ndistorted periodically by the periodic mechanism of attention, and that periodic\nattention influences performance in a cognitively demanding task such as the perception of\nstimulus duration.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research\nUniversity of Tokyo.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material for this article is available online.\nReferences\nBendixen, A., Grimm, S., & Schro\n\u00a8 ger, E.
