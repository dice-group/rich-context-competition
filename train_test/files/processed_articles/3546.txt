    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council's decision to refuse the\nresettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought\nto bear on the council as a result of the media \"hype.\" The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media\nplay a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by\nmedia framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the\ncouncil and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in\nmaking visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that\ncontribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.\n",

The \"Tamworth Case\"\nIn 2006, the federal government of Australia made a request\nto the Tamworth City Council for the town to become a\nregional resettlement location (ABC News, 2006) under the\nbroader Humanitarian Settlement in Regional Australia\nProgram (Department of Immigration and Citizenship\n[DIAC], 2011). The Tamworth Scheme would be similar to\nthe Regional Humanitarian Settlement Pilot programs\n\"already running in Goulburn, Wagga Wagga and Coffs\nHarbour, and other towns across the country\" (Munro &\nSudanese families would be resettled in the town each year.\nHowever, according to the ABC News (2006),\nThe council [ . . . ] made it clear [to the government] it will only\naccept the refugees if the proposal has widespread community\nsupport. A public meeting held [in August 2006] highlighted deep\nresentment to the idea and a survey [ . . . conducted thereafter]\nexposed further opposition to the move. [When] the council [ . . . ]\nreleased the survey results, [ . . . ] [they showed] only 96 of 393\nparticipants [ . . . were] in favour of accepting the refugees.\nAs a result, at a meeting in December 2006, the Tamworth\nCouncil refused the federal government's proposal for an\ninitial resettlement of five Sudanese families in the town.\nAccording to media reports, the council voted six to three,\n\"to spurn the offer by the Department of Immigration to\nresettle the families\" (Norrie, 2006, p. 3). The council's deci-\nsion attracted negative (national and international) media\ncoverage and attention: On the 15th of December, newspa-\npers all over Australia, and indeed internationally, widely\nreported and condemned the decision as a race-based deci-\nsion, that is, based on racial prejudice and stereotypes (of\nSudanese people and culture). The decision was reported and\ncondemned as an act of racism. \"The mayor, James Treloar,\ncame under fire for what were regarded as racist comments\nwhen he said the town wasn't coping with the 15 Sudanese\n\"said the city was struggling with the 15 refugees it already\nhad, stating they were having problems assimilating\" (Clifton,\n1Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n2Western Sydney University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nKwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, Department of Media and Communication,\nFaculty of Health, Arts, and Design, Swinburne University of Technology,\nEmail: kkwansah@swin.edu.au\nMedia Event, Racial Ramblings, or Both?\nAn Analysis of Media Coverage of the\nTamworth Council Sudanese Refugees\nKwamena Kwansah-Aidoo1 and Virginia Mapedzahama2\n Keywords\nTamworth, Sudanese, media, framing, racism, refugees\n2 SAGE Open\nSo, did the media really report an act of racism or was this\njust another instance of media-fuelled racism? Or, could it\nhave been both?\nIntroduction\nSome researchers have suggested that media coverage of any\nsocietal happening(s) can be done in such a way as to turn it\ninto a \"media event,\" and elevate such happenings to a level\nof importance that would otherwise not be attained (see, for\nThey suggest that this happens as a result of the \"heavy\nmediation,\" in terms of coverage that goes on, and also the\nnature of such mediation, in terms of the frames adopted for\ncovering what is happening, which eventually influence the\nway people think about it (see, for example, de Vreese,\ncan influence the importance people attach to issues or events\nthrough the subtle means of \"framing.\" In a similar vein, the\nrole the media play in the construction and reproduction of\nthe \"refugee narrative\" has been the focus of much research\nin recent years. In remaining critical of the media's signifi-\ncant (albeit subtle) role in shaping and amplifying public atti-\ntudes and perceptions toward refugees, much of this\nsignificant body of work has focused not only on media mis-\ninformation, but also on how the media presents negative\nand distorted images of refugees thereby influencing public\nopinion. The power of the media to influence what people\nthink about through their agenda-setting function has been\nestablished through over 200 publications on the subject\n(see, Kwansah-Aidoo, 2005) and how people think about\nwhat is presented to them, through framing has also been\nwell documented (see, for example, de Vreese et al., 2011).\nThis article adds to the body of work described above by\nanalyzing the media reporting of the Tamworth Sudanese\nrefugee case described in the prologue. In this particular\ncase, it can be argued that the issue at stake (refugee resettle-\nment and also race relations in Australia) was a complex one,\nmaking public opinion about it unstable, and therefore sub-\nject to influence through framing of the issue by both the\npolitical elites and the news media (de Vreese et al., 2011).\nInformed by Media Framing theory, we argue that while\nthe media reports exposed the \"ordinariness\" of racism, the\nmedia reporting in itself, that is, the framing of it, was done\nin such a way as to turn the issue into a media event \"par\nstruct the council's decision as based on race, thereby mak-\ning the whole event an act of \"racial consumption\" (Carbado,\n\"normalised\" reporting of the \"other\" that, though presented\nas an egalitarian and objective attempt to expose racism and\n\"close\" the racial gap, was imbued with racial overtones con-\nsumed by the White majority. Framing can help us understand\nthe way in which the media attempt to influence individuals\nin their efforts to make sense of everyday issues that occur in\nthe socio-political and economic realms of their lives (Chong\nVreese, 2010). Framing can also present us with a more criti-\ncal way of looking at the media reporting that took place and\nthereby make a valuable contribution to the literature on the\n\"refugee narrative.\"\nInterrogating media coverage of the Tamworth Case using\nthe conceptual framework offered by Framing is pertinent\nfor a number of reasons. First, apart from economic and\npolitical/geo-strategic considerations, the issue also contains\ncultural dimensions (de Vreese et al., 2011) and is therefore\nsignificant in the light of on-going attempts at addressing\nracism in Australia (see, for example, The Australian Human\nRights Commission, 2012), public discourses about multi-\nculturalism, and also the choice of multiculturalism as offi-\ncial cultural policy. Second, the subject matter provides an\ninteresting case to study how news frames can affect/influ-\nence the decision making of elected bodies (in this case, pos-\nsibly cause a change of mind/decision by the Tamworth\nCouncil). Third, the issue is of major importance to the future\ndirection of government refugee settlement policy, and for\ngaining both public and council support for such policy, as\nwell as for the future of multiculturalism inAustralia. Finally,\nit can help in understanding the subtle and incessant way in\nwhich racism reproduces itself in the Australian society,\nthrough seemingly objective and benevolent ways of report-\ning the \"other.\"\nWhereas some commentators have argued that \"there is a\ngeneral expectation that the media will provide accurate,\nunbiased and complete information\" (Wilson, Bonevski,\nJones, & Henry, 2009), the discussion in this article will\nshow that the information that the media disseminated was\nnot in itself unbiased, rather it was framed in particular ways,\n\"stressing certain aspects of reality\" while \"pushing others\ninto the background\" and suggesting \"certain issue attri-\nbutes, judgments and decisions\" (Lecheler & deVreese,\nposes of this article, only online print media coverage is pre-\nsented and analyzed, hence all reference to \"media\" in this\narticle refers to \"online print media.\" This is due to the fact\nthat the search for media reports was conducted more than 5\nyears after the event occurred, and the easiest access to\nreporting of the event was through online print media. An\ninitial search for media reporting on the Tamworth event\nfound only one video, hence the decision to limit the analy-\nses to print media.\nNews Framing and Audience\nUnderstanding\nThe issue and nature of refugee settlement is such that media\ncoverage can offer multiple and varying points of under-\nstanding. As a result, it is important to identify which par-\nticular aspects of the entire Tamworth Refugee Settlement\nKwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 3\nissue of 2006 were highlighted at the expense of others. In an\nattempt to understand how framing works, many studies\nhave specifically investigated the ways in which the news\nmedia frame messages, how news frames affect audiences,\nand the circumstances under which audiences are influenced\n(de Vreese et al., 2011). Historically \"framing\" was applied\nto how journalists and editors selected certain facts, themes,\nand so on, to present (frame) a story in a way that will gener-\nate maximum interest and understanding among audiences\nattention to some aspects of reality while obscuring other\nelements, which might lead audiences to have different reac-\ntions\" (p. 394). He explains further,\nTo frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and\nmake them more salient in a communicating context, in such a\nway as to promote a particular problem definition, causal\ninterpretation, moral evaluation and / or treatment\nThis means that in discussing issues, events, or objects\nthat the media present, framing ensures that attention is paid\nto only a small number of attributes (McCombs & Estrada,\nthe subtle selection of certain aspects of an issue by the\nmedia to make them more important and thus to emphasize a\nparticular cause of some phenomena.\" A media frame there-\nfore is \"the central organising idea for news content that sup-\nplies a context and suggest what the issue is through the use\nof selection, emphasis, exclusion and elaboration\" (Tankard,\nHendrickson, Silberman, Bliss, & Ghanem, 1991, p. 3).\nFraming is important in assessing media coverage because\nif the media can tell people what to think about, as has been\nproved overwhelmingly in agenda-setting research, \"then it\nstands to reason that the media can also influence how peo-\nple think about what they tell them to think about\" (Kwansah-\nhave argued that not only do the media provide cues about\nthe salience of certain topics and issues, but they also tell\npeople how to think about these topics and issues (McCombs,\nSome scholars have observed that frames, apart from\ninfluencing the way people think about an issue, can also\naffect the content of people's beliefs (Shah, Kwak,\nthat frames not only affect the importance of beliefs but also\ndirectly affect attitudes. This may happen either through the\nprovision of valence to the frame or by offering new consid-\nalso been suggested that some frames carry more \"weight\"\nthan others thus making the valence of some frames stronger\nthan others, and their consideration important (Chong &\nDruckman, 2007). Valenced news frames, as de Vreese et al.\n(2011) note, provide an indication of the \"inherent good and\npositive or bad and negative aspects\" of the news story. Some\nand Schuck and de Vreese (2006) have argued that the\nvalence news frame is important because it can affect both\ncognitive responses and attitudes.\nEntman (2002) points out that \"frames highlight some bits\nof information about an item that is a subject of a communi-\ncation, thereby elevating them to salience,\" and defines\nsalience as \"a piece of information more noticeable, mean-\ningful or memorable to an audience\" (p. 392). In that regard,\nresearch has shown that negative information tends to be\nmore salient and memorable than positive information (de\nThere is conflicting research evidence regarding how\nframing interacts with political sophistication to produce\neffects. While some studies (see for example, Kinder &\nshown that less politically sophisticated people have a higher\nsusceptibility to framing effects, others such as Druckman\nrelationship, showing \"the moderately or most politically\naware to be more responsive to news framing,\" particularly\nwhere the issue concerned is multi-faceted (de Vreese et al.,\nbeing equal, the negative valenced news frames used in the\ncoverage of the Tamworth refugee case had a strong effect on\nthe council.\nMethod\nThe analyses in this article are drawn from the content of 29\nnewspaper articles (online print media) sourced from an\nonline search of Google and the newspaper database: News\nBank conducted from April to November 2012 (refer to\nFor purposes of this article, articles by the same author(s)\nthat were published as (slightly) different editions/versions\nunder different headlines have been considered as different\narticles.

Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the\nresponses are significant in that they not only expose how\npeople respond to reports (hence the power of the media),\nthey may also be useful for insights into broader community\nattitudes.\nOf the 29 newspaper articles, 15 were published before\nthe council reversed its decision, that is, they were about the\nCouncil's initial decision of rejecting the refugees, and the\nremaining 14 reports were about the council's rescinded\ndecision. Very few of the 29 articles did not make references\nto race. A content analysis revealed that out of the 15 articles\nthat reported on the council's initial decision, 13 used the\nwords race, racism, or racial, and these words altogether\noccurred a total of 31 times in these articles. The words/\nphrases Cronulla, Cronulla riots, and Cronulla type situation\nwere used in 11 publications, occurring a total of 19 times.\nOut of the 14 reports that dealt with the council's reversal of\ntheir initial decision, only four mentioned race, racism, or\nracial, with these words occurring a total of 14 times, while\nthe words/phrases Cronulla, Cronulla riots, and Cronulla\ntype situation occurred only once in a publication. While\nthese findings about word count are important, what is even\nmore significant is the discourses that were circulated within\nthese media reports and how these words were used to frame\nthe reports to paint a certain kind of picture for readers\nthrough emphasizing a particular cause of this phenomena\n(Iyengar, 1991) and influencing how people would think\nabout what they were telling them to think about (Kwansah-\nAidoo, 2003). Consequently, the discussions here apply ele-\nments from content analysis to the media language and\ndiscourse to highlight the biases in the ways in which media\nreported the events surrounding this case. Schulz (2008)\nnotes that\n[A] major tool in modern communication management is\ndiscourse analysis. The rationale behind discourse analysis\nholds that discourses (linguistic constructions) are used within\nand describe cultural, political and community ideas and, so,\nboth construct and sustain the specific forms of knowledge and\nunderstanding among the general public. (p. 225)\nThe approach we adopt here to determine the media\nframes adopted in the coverage of the Tamworth case is\npartly in line with that suggested by Matthes and Kohring\nthe most concrete, measurable subsidiary attributes of media\ndiscourse at a granular level of analysis rather than making\nbroad thematic statements about news coverage\" (p. 555). To\nmake a case for framing and also racialization, we are espe-\ncially interested in how the media supplied information that\nwould enable and encourage citizens and politicians, in par-\nticular ways as suggested by Delli Carpini and Keeter (1997),\nthe Tamworth Council's initial decision as racist and the\nwhole issue as being about racism. Specifically, we adopted\na consistent system of analysis in dealing with the reports.\nFirst, the reports were searched to identify recurring regulari-\nties in terms of discourses. It was then determined that these\ndiscourses or discursive regularities contained and reflected\ncertain themes; these themes were further sorted into frames.\nThe frames were determined from the number of times cer-\ntain words or combination of words (phrases), that served to\nhighlight some bits of information making them more\n\"noticeable, meaningful or memorable\" (Entman, 2002,\np. 392), were used in the reports. Afterwards, the reports\nwere carefully examined to ensure that the frames within\neach theme were the same and deserved to be grouped\ntogether. In the same vein, the themes were carefully exam-\nined for differences so as to ascertain that words/phrases\nthat had been grouped under the different frames were dis-\nsimilar and could be classified under the determined frames.\nThis process ensured that all aspects of the reports received\nthe same attention and treatment. It is worth pointing out\nthough that our analyses here does not attempt to discuss\nevery element of the articles, but as is acceptable in these\nkinds of analyses, we only focused on the aspects that\nseemed useful to answering the concerns of framing and\nAccording to Schulz (2008), the \"recurrent and patterned\nuse of language elements such as lexical choice, syntactical\nstructuring, genres and rhetorical constructs can deliver pre-\nferred versions of understanding on a specific subject\"\n(p. 225), similar to framing as previously discussed. Our\nanalyses in the discussion that ensues concentrates on two\nsignificant issues that we argue are evident in the media's\nlanguage, highlighting that the media coverage was inten-\ntionally meant to portray racism or race as \"the\" factor in the\ncouncils' decision. First are the headlines, whose wording\nwas not only deliberately meant to \"catch\" the reader's atten-\ntion but also to \"shock.\" Second, is the methodical centering\nof, and emphasis on, the aspects of the case, to the exclusion\nof others (framing) that can readily and easily be interpreted\nas racist. Here we concentrate in particular on the strategic\nand constant citing of the Tamworth City Council Mayor's\n(Mayor Treloar; implicit and explicit) race-based comments\non the decision. In addition, it follows that in a discussion of\nthis nature, a question be asked on whether the media \"raced\"\nthis event: Did they make a racism case out of a non-raced\ndecision, or did they simply report on racism? Our conten-\ntion is that while the council may have had legitimate reason\nto refuse the resettlement on the basis of inadequate resources,\nracial stereotyping and prejudice also played a part in com-\ning to that decision. We conclude our analyses by discussing\nhow the media coverage, though it may be interpreted as\n\"pro-Sudanese refugees,\" may have also re/produced certain\nnegative and problematized images of Sudanese refugee\nsubjectivity.\n6 SAGE Open\nPutting Race Upfront: What's in a\nHeadline?\nHeadlines seem to matter on their own . . . they inevitably\nenhance or \"play up\" some information while suppressing other\nAndrew (2007) observes that \"functionally speaking, head-\nlines are simplifying mechanisms that summarize and attract\nattention to what lies ahead (or below)\" (p. 24). A news head-\nand to that extent, it can be argued that, to all intents and\npurposes headlines constitute part of the framing mecha-\nnisms used by journalists and that, perhaps more than any\nother aspect of the news story/article they (the headlines)\nhighlight particular frames adopted in a story.\nAccordingly, it is now widely acknowledged that head-\nlines \"can have a powerful effect on the attitudes that people\nSchulz (2010) notes that \"when a specific position is consis-\ntently highlighted throughout media headlines [and reports]\nit establishes a theme or recurrent motif\" (p. 70), which is\n\"used then in a promotional type of role to sustain reader\ninterest or shock\" (Schulz, 2012, p. 4). Citing van Dijk\ntic macrostructures, which lead media consumers into what\nto think\" (p. 6). One could argue therefore, that in the case of\nthe Tamworth Council's decision, the media headlines repre-\nsented framing that was meant to present the case as being\nabout race and provoke reactions or attitudes to racism.\nSome of the headlines explicitly included the word racist,\nracial, or race, clearly intended to incite outrage toward an\nact of racism. The examples below are illustrative:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Racism Alive, Sick in Tamworth\" (Mirko Bagaric;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"NSW City Refuses Refugees Claims of Racial\nHatred\" (Susanna Dunkerley, The Mercury (Hobart),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Singing From a Different Songsheet: Race Row\nCouncil Still Divided\" (Lillian Saleh, The Daily\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"`Racist' Council's Apology of Sorts--Tamworth's\nAbout-Face\" (Lillian Saleh, The Daily Telegraph,\nMoreover, the articles that were explicit about racism in\nthe headlines tended to have lead paragraphs that also linked\nthe decision directly to racism. The lead paragraph for\nBagaric's (2006) article, for example, said,\nSUDANESE have black skin and are often Muslim but in every\nmeaningful respect they are the same as every other person in\nAustralia. That's a lesson civic leaders in Tamworth who have\nrefused to re-settle five Sudanese families need to have drilled\ninto them. Otherwise, their town, which has been votedAustralia's\nmost friendly, might also get the mantle as the most racist.\n(p. 17, emphasis added)\nThe lead above is not surprising and only goes to buttress\nthe point about the intended frame of the report as repre-\nsented in the headline. Journalistically, the lead immediately\nfollows the headline in order of importance, and together\nthey represent the most notable part of the story. They com-\nbine to provide a gist of what the story is about and what is\nmost significant, and must therefore necessarily work\ntogether. In fact, in journalistic terms, the lead is merely an\nexpansion of/on the headline. Consequently, those two parts\nof the story taken together will offer the most clues about the\nframe/s adopted by any story. The lead cited above therefore\nproves that the story was racially framed. The tone of the\nlead and the subtle reference (Iyengar, 1991) to skin color,\nreligion, and so on, as well as the suggestion that Tamworth\nwill become known as the most racist town in Australia, all\npoint to an intention to highlight race and to make race and\nracism the most important aspect of the case/story.\nSimilarly, Saleh's (2007) article \"`Racist' Council's\nApology of Sorts--Tamworth's About-Face\" had the follow-\ning lead paragraph/sentence:\nA COUNCIL accused of racism for refusing to take more\noverseas refugees apologised to its African population last night\nand reconsidered its stance. (p. 12)\nAgain, here the headline and lead work in tandem in the\neffort to frame the case/story as being about race/racism. The\nchoice of words and the inclusion of the words race and rac-\nism in the headline and lead are all pointers. Also, by high-\nlighting that a council that had been previously \"accused of\nracism\" had now apologized, Saleh infers that the council\nknew it was being racist, and was apologizing for the act of\nracism. All of these provide hints and show coverage in par-\nticular ways (framing) that encourage the audience to see the\nCouncil's initial decision as racist (Delli Carpini & Keeter,\nmayor's clarification of his earlier statement that compared\nhaving Sudanese in Tamworth to Cronulla riots (discussed in\ndetail in the ensuing section), this reinforced the inference\nthat the council was apologizing for racist behavior:\nI used them as an example of where the program had failed--not\nto say they were a lawless mob running riots in Tamworth or that\nI was concerned about them forming gangs and getting like\nCronulla . . . (p. 12)\nMost of the headlines, however, were only implicit in\ntheir reference to race: that is, they did not explicitly reflect\nthe discussion about race and racism in the article. For exam-\nple the Daily Telegraph's \"Sour Notes--Shame of a Town\nCalled Malice\" (Clare Masters, 2007) was in fact extensive\nin its coverage/discussion of race relations in Tamworth. The\narticle focused on the Council's explanation of its decision\nKwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 7\nand was one of the few that sought to include multiple voices.\nThere were at least three voices included: the Tamworth\nSudanese refugee voice (including their thoughts on/reac-\ntions to the mayor's comments/Council's decision, as well as\ntheir general racial realities in Tamworth), the mayor's com-\nments, and Tamworth residents (both those who supported\nthe resettlement and those who opposed it).\nFurthermore, some of the articles only implied race, rac-\nism, or racial prejudice in the headline, yet also often had\nlead paragraphs/sentences that made reference to race/rac-\nism. For example, the lead paragraph of the Sydney Morning\nHerald's article, \"You're Not Welcome, Town Tells\nRefugees,\" had the following lead sentence:\nA month before Tamworth hosts overseas musicians and fans at\nits world-renowned country music festival, the NSW town has\nbecome embroiled in a racism row over a decision to reject five\nSudanese refugee families. (Norrie, 2006)\nIt can also be argued here, that while most of the headlines\nwere racially implicit, they were nonetheless framed in ways\nthat portrayed the council's decision as morally appalling\nthus confirming Entman's (2002) suggestion that framing\nseeks to promote a particular way of defining a problem and\nmoral evaluation. This kind of framing can potentially con-\npotentially create a moral panic about racism or perhaps\nmore specifically racial panic or racial anxiety (Abel, 2011,\np. 5) among the readers or the wider Australian community.\nThe headlines below again exemplify this point:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Rejection of Sudanese Refugees Sparks Outrage\"\n(Justin Norrie, Sydney Morning Herald, December\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Chorus of Outrage at Rejection of Sudanese\nRefugees\" (Justin Norrie, Sydney Morning Herald,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Home of Country Music Slams Door on Refugees\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"No More Refugees--Tamworth Mayor Defends Vote\nto Slam the Gate\" (Lillian Saleh and Neil Keene,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Tamworth Tainted by Small Minds\" (Sydney\n\"If That is Racism, Then Call Me a\nRacist!\" The Utterances of Mayor\nTreloar\nAlmost all of the articles reviewed began with the mayor's\nracially provocative comments.

One\ncould argue therefore that the media highlighting of the may-\nor's statement that equates bringing in Sudanese refugees to\nCronulla riots, which were themselves branded an epitome\nof difficult race relations and racism in Australia, infers two\nsignificant things about the council's decision. First, that the\nmayor or the council in fact considered this as a decision\nabout race, not resources. The mayor's statement that \"allow-\ning (the families) to move here could lead to a Cronulla riots-\ntype situation\" implies that it will be inevitable that allowing\nthe families to settle in the town would result in race-based\nsocial unrest or social problems (regardless of the availabil-\nity of resources). Second, the reference to a violent act\n(Cronulla riots) implies racial stereotyping that constructs\nthe Sudanese refugees as a violent group. For purposes of\ncontextualization, it is worth pointing out that, at the core of\nthe Cronulla riots was a gang fight between the established\n\"Ozzie\" gang and intruding new ethnic gangs, largely\nLebanese (who were harassing Australian European women\ndressed in bikinis and calling them names). There is no evi-\ndence that there were any Sudanese involved. Hence, linking\nSudanese families to a Cronulla risk (as the mayor did)\nwould seem to be wrong and the only connection is that they\nare a different racial group from overseas so the mayor's\ncomments in this respect were patently racist and the framing\ninsofar as it accused the mayor of racism is accurate. Our\nargument here, however, is not about the racist nature of the\nmayor's comments, but rather the focus on those comments\nto the exclusion of other non-racist comments that were\nequally important and worth noting.\nNot surprisingly then, only one of the reports (Norrie,\n2006) made explicit reference to the mayor's utterances\nabout the council's concern regarding the lack of resources to\nsupport the program, but even then, only one sentence was\n8 SAGE Open\ndevoted to it: \"The town did not have enough health and edu-\ncation services to support the refugees, he said.\" This is a\nclear indication of intent to frame the issue in racial terms on\nthe part of many. Here, we can talk about framing by exclu-\nsion/omission (Entman, 2002) or framing by paying atten-\ntion to only a small number of attributes at the expense of\nothers (McCombs & Estrada, 1997). Furthermore, in some\ncases, the media reports even disputed the mayor's claim of\nlack of resources:\nTamworth City Council voted to reject an offer by the department\nto resettle the families, saying the town did not have the\nresources to cope. But detractors say the decision was simply\nracist, arguing the city has the resources to look after 50,000\nextra people every year when it holds its famous country music\nfestival. (\"Troubled Tamworth Gets Govt Support,\" 2007,\nemphasis added)\nSome reports even painted the mayor himself, not the\ncouncil as an entity, as the racist one:\nWhile Treloar keeps running off at the mouth about resident\nSudanese, the Oxley Local Area commander, Superintendent\nTony Jefferson, gives the lie to the Mayor's words. He says\nsome have been charged with assault, traffic and domestic\nmatters--but \"they do not stand out over any other ethnic group\nin the community.\" Unrepentant, Treloar says: \"If this is racist,\nwell so be it. Call me a racist then.\" (Murphy, 2006)\nIn some cases, the council's concern about lack of ser-\nvices was subsumed under a more intense discussion about\nconcern with the \"difference\" of the problematized Sudanese\nrefugees:\nTamworth City Council has voted to refuse an offer by the\nImmigration Department to resettle five refugee families from\nthe war-torn African nation. It feared cultural differences and a\nlack of services could lead to increased violence in the city,\nwhich is home to the world-renowned country music festival.\nMayor James Treloar said public submissions showed there was\na clear sense of mistrust in the town, after several existing\nSudanese residents were charged with driving offences and one\nwith sexual assault. (Dunkerley, 2006, emphasis added)\nWhat seems clear from these reports then is that the coun-\ncil's decision was not solely about race, as one report cites\nthe mayor: \"It was a rejection of the government's program,\nnot of the Sudanese.\" This reaffirms Schulz's (2008) conten-\ntion that \"modern media practice includes selective processes\nwithin the newsroom environment, and journalists abide by\ncertain clearly defined `news values' that prescribe the ele-\nments of a `good story.'Such elements generally include \"the\nsensational and the dramatic\" (p. 224). It also aligns with the\nview put forth by certain framing scholars that valenced\nnews frames provide an indication of what is inherently good\nand positive or bad and negative in the news story (de Vreese\net al., 2011) while confirming that negative information\ntends to have greater salience and memorability than infor-\nmation which is positive (de Vreese et al., 2011; Johnson-\nFurthermore, where the mayor was quoted citing statistics\nto validate the council's decision, these were presented as\neither unsubstantiated or motivated by bigotry (Leader,\nDiamond Valley News, 2007). This again points to framing\nwhich is about highlighting and/or downplaying some bits of\ninformation about an item to either make them more notice-\nable, meaningful, or memorable to an audience on the one\nhand, or less noticeable, less meaningful, or less memorable\nOne other important observation about the reporting of\nthe council's reversal of the decision is how the media cover-\nage magnified the role of external pressures (for example\nfrom the church) or widespread outrage (for example from\nthe media \"bashing,\" community outrage, etc.) that implied\nthat the \"racist council\" could not come to this decision on its\nown, without these outside/external pressures. For example,\ntwo of the articles included in this review reported on the role\nof the churches in the reversal of the decision (Wilson, 2007a,\nRace/ing the Tamworth Case?\nThe media coverage of the issue was largely devoted to trying to\nprove that residents of Tamworth (and, by extension, most\nAustralians) were racist, while failing to address the basic\nquestion of why the local council was voting on the issue in the\nfirst place and how they actually had the power to veto the\ndecision to locate the refugees in the town. (Allsop, 2007, p. 27)\nThe question therefore arises, given the foregone discussion\nas well as Allsop's contention above, did the media \"race\"\nthe Tamworth council's decision? In other words, was the\nTamworth council's decision inherently racist, implying that\nthe media were simply reporting/exposing an act of racism?\nAs discussed already, clearly some of the reports privileged\nracism above all else, giving the impression that racism was\nat the core of the council's decision, as Mirko Bagaric (2006),\na social commentator (Geelong Advertiser), writes,\nRacism, pure and simple is the only reason the council rejected\nthe re-settlement of the Sudanese families. Service provision has\nnothing to do with it. Tamworth has 40,000 people.An additional\nfew families won't break the bank. In case it decides to stay\nopen, here are some lessons for the councillors. (p. 21)\nBagaric's statement does not leave room for any other expla-\nnation for the council's decision, in spite of some other com-\nmentators'claims that \"the broader concerns of the council, in\ntune with community sentiment, were that the existing gov-\nernment HRRP was ill-equipped to deliver full services to\nnewly arrived refugee families, threatening the longer-term\nsuccess of the pilot scheme\" (Fraser, 2007, p. 17). The racism\nframe adopted by the writer from the Geelong Advertiser and\nKwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 9\nthe emphatic nature of the claim again fits well with the\nobservation made earlier that framing seeks to \"promote a\nparticular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral\nevaluation and/or treatment recommendation for the item\nsize a particular cause of some phenomena\" (Iyengar, 1991,\nNonetheless, we contend, that while the media did give\nmost of their attention to race (to the extent of almost disre-\ngarding any other basis for the decision), they did not \"race\nit.\" To start with, as Fraser (2007) notes,\nThe Tamworth incident was played out at a time of glaring\nmedia profile for the Sudanese community in Australia. The\nrecent cases of convicted rapist Hakeem Hakeem, and of Taban\nGany, sentenced for drink driving causing serious injury, have\nsubjected the wider Sudanese population to columns of outrage\nin the press and to simmering distrust from within sections of the\nOne could argue therefore that the council's decision was\nmade in the context of attitudes and understandings emanat-\ning from discourses of the racially problematized Sudanese\nrefugee and that they were influenced by these discourses,\nwhile at the same time contributing to them. As Fairclough\n(1989) rightly points out, \"Social conditions determine prop-\nerties of discourse\" (p. 9)\" and \"the language activity which\ngoes on in social contexts is not merely a reflection or expres-\nsion of social processes and practices; it is part of those pro-\ncesses and practices\" (p. 23).\nMedia (Re)Producing the\nProblematized (Sudanese) Refugee\nSubject\nAn important (perhaps unintended) effect of the media's\nframing of the Tamworth case as a racist event is how the\nSudanese subject was portrayed and positioned. The por-\ntrayal of the Sudanese refugee--oftentimes reported by\nquoting the words of Tamworth city councilor and local pub-\nlican, Robert Schofield--also propagated and perpetuated an\nimage of Sudanese subjectivity defined in terms of victim-\nhood and abject poverty, thereby reinforcing the \"us\" and\n\"them\" dichotomy:\nCouncillor and local publican Robert Schofield said: \"These are\npeople escaping war and persecution. I'm sickened by the lack\nof compassion.\" (Norrie, 2006, emphasis added)\nWe've got many, many volunteers up here. There's lots of\nvolunteer groups, they're only too pleased to help the Sudanese,\nthe poor souls, to get a new life back in Tamworth, Mr Schofield\ntold Southern Cross Radio. \"We're a wealthy country and it's\nonly five families, and the poor souls have got absolutely\nnothing. They come from a war-torn country where they've been\nfighting there for 21 years, that's all they've known. (Geelong\nThe emotive appeal of the excerpts above is evident,\n(\"sickened by the lack of compassion\"; \"poor souls\").\nFurther, the paternalistic overtones constructed and repro-\nduced an \"other\" who is abjectly poor, hence different from\n\"us\" a \"wealthy country.\" Perhaps more important in the\nexcerpts is the references made to war and persecution.\nThese have more enduring and possibly even inimical conse-\nquences for portrayal of the Sudanese subject--as victims,\nwho as Mayor Treloar argued, \"fly out of Sudan, arrive in\nSydney, pop on a plane and come to Tamworth--and they\ncome with trauma, . . . [to a place where they] don't have the\ntrauma counsellors to help them\" (Saleh & Keene, 2006).\nThus, rather than centre the resilience of Sudanese to survive\nunder crisis situations, such reporting instead associates\nthem with violence:\nFew people could have greater claims to being given safe haven\nin Australia than the Sudanese. Apart from a hiatus from 1972 to\nclaimed close to two million lives and displaced about four\nmillion people. Despite international efforts to broker a peace\ndeal between rebel forces and government troops allied with\nArab janjaweed militia, the conflict in the Darfur region shows\nAdopting the frames of war, persecution, and violence,\ninstead of resilience and survival in the discussion of\nSudanese subjectivity meant that attention was paid to only a\nsmall number of attributes, which would subsequently ensure\nthat Sudanese refugees are seen only in a certain light\n(McCombs & Estrada, 1997). Such reporting/framing rein-\nforces Councilor Schofield's statement that war is \"all they\n[Sudanese refugees] have known.\" A consequence of such\nreporting is that it can conjure up images and constructs of an\n\"other\" sufficiently different from \"us\" (one who's only ever\nknown violence) that there is the possibility of a \"clash of\ncivilisations.\" Not surprising then that the Sudanese subject\nwould be subsequently associated with violent behavior, as\nMayo Treloar argued. This \"violent\" subject, \"different from\nus\" is highlighted in the reporting of the sentiments of a\nTamworth resident below:\nA few doors up, a single mother shoos her young daughter\ninside. She is a large woman, and stands barefoot on her dying\nfront lawn, pointing angrily at her neighbours. \"Did you ask\nthem about the 11-year-old-girls that go into that house? It's\ntotally inappropriate,\" she says, her eyes welling with tears of\nrage. \"Did you ask them about driving off and not paying for\npetrol? We don't do that. Why are the Aborigines scared of\nthem? They stand outside here on the street yabbering away on\ntheir mobile phones. They just stare at you. Everybody's terrified\nof them in the street. Why can't they just go back where they\nThe excerpt above not only frames the Tamworth case as\na racist event, but exposes the fear and uneasiness of some of\nTamworth residents with the Sudanese subject. We argue that\nit is this fear and uneasiness that is behind such residents'\nsupport of the council's decision: Allowing more Sudanese\nrefugees into the town meant the potential to increase vio-\nlence (and crime) in an otherwise peaceful town.\nMoreover, some of the reporting highlighted the Sudanese\nrefugee as not only \"different,\" but also \"raced\":\nSudanese have black skin and are often Muslim but in every\nmeaningful respect they are the same as every other person in\nAustralia. That's a lesson civic leaders in Tamworth who have\nrefused to re-settle five Sudanese families need to have drilled\ninto them. Otherwise, their town, which has been voted\nAustralia's most friendly, might also get the mantle as the most\nracist [ . . . ] Sure some Sudanese might express themselves in\nslightly different ways, prefer different music and eat different\nfood but these no more differentiate them from the rest of us\nthan does the fact most of us follow different football teams.\nSuch descriptions though purporting to be benign, serve\nto subtly prop up \"the structural relation in which `whiteness'\nis defined against a homogenized Other constructed as black\"\nIt is worth pointing out that the Sudanese refugee subject\nwho is re/produced in the reports is one who is silenced. In\nanalyzing the media reporting of the Tamworth case, what is\nglaringly obvious is the lack of the Sudanese voice in most of\nthe reports, that is, the views/opinions of the Sudanese refu-\ngees living in Tamworth in relation to the vote. In this sense,\nthe media not only reproduced the problematized Sudanese\nrefugee, it also silenced them, thereby committing what\nSpivak (1994), calls an act of \"epistemic violence\" (p. 78).\nInterestingly, of the few articles that included comments\nfrom migrants of Sudanese background, none was from\nSudanese living in Tamworth. For example, Saleh and\nKeene's article: \"No More Refugees--Tamworth Mayor\nDefends Vote to Slam the Gate\" references the experiences\nof Marial Fieg, residing in Newcastle. Similarly, Saleh's arti-\ncles: \"`Racist' Council's Apology of Sorts--Tamworth's\nAbout-Face\" and \"Council Reconsiders: Tamworth Says\nSorry to its Sudan Refugees\" also include \"the voice\" of\nSudanese refugees residing in Blacktown. Our contention\nthen is that the media failed in their role of serving as \"a cru-\ncial arena for challenging prevailing attitudes regarding the\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis article has presented analyses of online print media\nreporting of the Tamworth City council's 2006 decision (and\nsubsequent reversal of that decision) to refuse the resettle-\nment of five refugee families into the town, which gained\nmedia attention and condemnation as an act of racism: a\ndecision based mainly on racial prejudice. Bullimore (1999)\nwrites that\nThe Australian media, like the media of many Westernised\ncountries, plays a significant role in not only providing\ninformation about the society in which we live but also in\nactively constructing for us a picture of that society. (p. 72)\nWhat picture of society did the media paint in the\nTamworth case then? We have argued in this article that the\nmedia framed the Tamworth Sudanese issue in particular\nways that would encourage the audience to see the Tamworth\nCouncil's initial decision as racist and the whole issue as\nbeing about racism (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1997; Hacker &\nare persistent patterns of cognition, interpretation, and pre-\nsentation, of selection, emphasis and exclusion, by which\nsymbol-handlers routinely handle discourse\" (p. 7). Our dis-\ncussion here has shown that the media's selection, interpreta-\ntion, and presentation of the events surrounding theTamworth\nCouncil's decisions--rejection and subsequent reversal--\nwere meant to introduce patterns of cognition to the audience\nthat would more than likely make them see the case as being\nabout race and racism. Tamworth council was constructed in\nthe media coverage and discourses as having made a deci-\nsion based on racial prejudice. In other words, through their\nframing, the media painted a picture of a \"racist\" council, by\nextension, a racist Tamworth, and by inference a racist coun-\ntry/rural Australia (at the very least).\nThe heavy mediation and the frame(s) adopted by the\nmedia, which linked the Council's decisions to the wider\nissue of race, racism, and racial harmony, turned what could\nhave easily passed for an innocuous everyday occurrence--a\nFederal Government request to a City Council, and their neg-\native response to the said request--into a media event \"par\nmedia provided \"a society-wide forum where values, norms,\nand social structures were scrutinized, challenged, and cele-\nmoral outrage and harmonious race relations.\nMoreover, when one applies Essed's concept of everyday\nracism to the case, it is evident that the decision was an act of\neveryday racism. Essed (1991) describes everyday racism as\nthe everyday manifestations and (re)production of systemic\ninequality based on race and/or assumptions around race,\nwhether intended or unintended. Though other factors may/\ncould have influenced the decision-making and attitudes of\ndecision makers in this case, it is not far-fetched to argue that\nthe structural forces of racism, represented by attitudes and\nunderstandings that permeate the circulating media dis-\ncourses around Sudanese refugees that problematize and\npresent them as the \"racialized other,\" would have played a\nrole in influencing the council, acting in an everyday routine\nsituation, to take a decision that would discriminate against\nthe refugees. And as Stratton suggests, these attitudes and\nKwansah-Aidoo and Mapedzahama 11\nunderstandings are so embedded in the everyday life of a\nracialized Australian culture that its members don't even rec-\nognize themselves as making decisions based on a racialized\nOur conclusions about the media's framing notwithstand-\ning, it remains debatable whether the media reporting mir-\nrored or portrayed community attitudes and perceptions\ntoward Sudanese refugees. While some may hail the report-\ning of the Tamworth case as an expos\u00e9 of a case of racism, it\ncould also be critiqued as sensationalist reporting that pushed\nthe media agenda and exaggerated a race issue for the sake of\nMoreover, as has been discussed in detail in this article,\nthe media, in their reporting still reproduced the current neg-\native discourses of refugees that are not only paternalistic\nand patronizing, but also problematize and pathologize refu-\ngees. In so doing, the media became a site for the perpetua-\ntion of negative stereotypes of Sudanese (and by extension\nAfrican) refugeehood that were in themselves racist. In our\nview, what the media did qualifies as racial ramblings\nbecause of the nature of their coverage and their insistent and\npersistent focus on race and racism, and the presentation of\nstereotypes, which while supposedly intended to be benign,\nultimately served as a platform for (re)producing and enhanc-\ning both everyday and systemic racism. The analyses in this\narticle illustrates that the Tamworth Case contained base\nmaterials for different frames and that there was an opportu-\nnity to offer multiple explanations as to why the Tamworth\nCouncil made their initial decision to reject the Federal\nGovernment's request, but that did not happen. This article\ntherefore shows that explanations offered in news coverage\nof such issues while at least partially inherent, are influenced\nto a great extent by \"social, cultural, and historical forces\ninfluencing the institution and practice of journalism\" (Park,\nIn terms of value, this article has provided insights into an\nissue that is of politico-cultural significance within the\nAustralian society--the issue of race, racism, and racial rela-\ntions. Given the on-going discussions about racism in\nAustralia and how to deal with it, and also public discourses\nabout multiculturalism as official cultural policy, the discus-\nsions in this article help us to understand the mass media's\nrole in highlighting racism as a problem for public and politi-\ncal concern while providing valuable insights into how the\nmedia can act as a double-edged sword: helping to unearth\nand fight racism, thereby championing racial harmony on\none hand, while providing a platform for (re)producing racial\nstereotypes and subsequently everyday racism.\nThe article is also important because it has shown that\nnews frames can affect/influence the decision making of\nelected bodies (in this case, cause a change of mind/decision\nby the Tamworth Council), thereby confirming research\nfindings that suggest that people who are moderately or most\npolitically aware are more responsive to media framing (see,\nfor example, de Vreese et al., 2011; Druckman & Nelson,\n& Theriault, 2004). Also by providing some understanding of\nthe \"dynamics between media coverage and what people\nmake of the issues presented to them on one hand, and how\nthis coverage interacts with societal factors to produce\nrevelations here can inform discussions around the future\ndirection of government refugee settlement policy. It can also\nhelp in designing programs that seek to gain both public and\ncouncil support for such policy, as well as helping in discus-\nsions of a more robust multicultural policy for Australia. Last\nbut not least, the worth of this article can be seen in the way\nin which it has shown why despite all the talk about racism\nand the efforts at ending it, race and racial matters continue to\nbe issues of everyday concern. Our discussions have exposed\nthe subtle and yet persistent way in which racism reproduces\nitself in the Australian society, through seemingly objective\nand benevolent ways of reporting the \"other.\"\nTo sum up, we revisit the question in our title and con-\nclude based on our discussions so far, that the media through\ntheir intense coverage and the negatively valenced frames\nthat they used in their articles/stories, turned the Tamworth\nSudanese Resettlement Case of 2006 into a media event\ncontend that in the process of doing so they engaged in\nreporting, which inadvertently served to enhance stereotypi-\ncal ways of viewing the migrant Sudanese, and by extension\nAfrican \"other,\" thereby contributing to the reproduction of\nboth everyday and systemic racism (Essed, 1991; Stratton,\n2006) and thus qualifying it as racial rumblings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nrefugee resettlement plan.
