ERCP can be impossible when pre-\nvious surgery or proximal digestive obstruction\nhas made the papilla inaccessible. In such cases,\nendoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage\n(EUBD), a recent development of interventional\nendoscopic ultrasound (EUS), can be offered as\nan alternative to more conventional instrumental\n(percutaneous transhepatic) or surgical drainage\nmethods. Because EUBD is generally proposed in\nthe case of distal biliary obstruction, there has\nbeen no systematic report of the results of EUBD\nin the case of proximal hilar biliary obstruction.\nMoreover, ERCP in non-operable hilar stenosis is\nmore challenging than distal obstruction, with a\nfailure rate of up to 27%, and lower clinical effi-\ncacy, even after successful stenting.1 For these\nreasons, we decided to study the outcomes of\npatients treated by EUBD for proximal malignant\nbiliary obstruction.\nIs EUS-guided drainage a suitable\nalternative technique in case of proximal\nbiliary obstruction?\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Moryoussef, Adrien Sportes, Sarah Leblanc, Jean Baptiste Bachet,\nStanislas Chaussade and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prat\n Keywords: bridge-trans-hilar stenting, endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage,\nendoscopic ultrasound hepaticogastrostomy, hilar strictures, modified anatomy\nCorrespondence to:\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prat\nDepartment of Gastro-\nEnterology, Cochin\nTeaching Hospital,\nAP-HP, Universit\u00e9 Paris\nDescartes, Sorbonne Paris\nCite, Paris, France\nfrederic.prat@aphp.fr\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Moryoussef\nJean Baptiste Bachet\nDepartment of Gastro-\nEnterology, La Piti\u00e9\nSalpetri\u00e8re Teaching\nHospital, AP-HP,\nUniversit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie\nCurie, Paris, France\nAdrien Sportes\nSarah Leblanc\nStanislas Chaussade\nDepartment of Gastro-\nEnterology, Cochin\nTeaching Hospital,\nAP-HP, Universit\u00e9 Paris\nDescartes, Sorbonne Paris\nCite, Paris, France\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(7)\n538 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThis is an observational cohort study including\nconsecutive patients with a mostly prospective\ncollection of data. Out of a prospectively main-\ntained and incremented database of EUS-guided\ninterventional procedures starting in November\n2013, consecutive patients undergoing EUBD\nwho presented hilar bile duct obstruction were\nextracted over a period of 2 years, ending in\nNovember 2015. Inclusion criteria were: age\n>18, histologically proven malignant obstruction\ninvolving the main biliary confluence (as assessed\nfrom MRI) with no access to the papilla or a pre-\nvious failure to achieve retrograde endoscopic\ndrainage. Exclusion criteria included severe coag-\nulation disorders not amenable to rapid and sus-\ntainable correction, large volume ascites (a small\namount of ascites was considered acceptable),\nprevious left hepatectomy, CT-scan or MRI\nshowing severe atrophy or massive tumor involve-\nment of the left liver lobe, and non-dilated bile\nducts. The study received IRB approval and writ-\nten informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants.\nBaseline data\nBaseline demographic and biological data,\ninformation on the patients' clinical history and\ncurrent condition were collected prospectively\non inclusion. Most short-term follow-up data\nwere also obtained prospectively on patient dis-\ncharge or from referring physicians. Additional\ndata, both clinical and biological, were obtained\nwhen necessary by a retrospective review of\nmedical records. Endoscopic procedure details\nwere immediately recorded. Clinical data\nincluded World Health Organization (WHO)\nstatus at inclusion, underlying neoplasia, surgi-\ncal history, previous interventional procedures,\nsignificant clinical events, length of hospital\nstay, medical decisions made after EUBD\n(chemotherapy, care limitation), clinical events\nduring the first 3 months following EUBD (such\nas procedure-related complications and reinter-\nventions \u00ad whether endoscopic or not) and sur-\nvival time. Biological data included only total\nserum bilirubin level (mg/dl) before drainage, 7\ndays and 30 days after drainage. Patients were\nfollowed until death or date of transfer to a pal-\nliative care unit.\nOutcomes measures\nThe main outcome measure was clinical success\ndefined by a decrease of total serum bilirubin\nlevel to less than half the pre-operative level within\n7 (early success) and 30 days (sustained success)\nof procedure.\nSecondary outcome measures included technical\nsuccess (defined by the possibility of puncturing\nbiliary ducts and inserting a stent between the bil-\niary tree and the stomach or the duodenum), pro-\ncedure-related complications (within 30 days)\nand overall complications (within 3 months),\nadministration of chemotherapy, length of hospi-\ntal stays, reintervention rate and overall survival.\nProcedure\nAll procedures were performed in supine position\nunder monitored general anesthesia with airway\nintubation. Prophylactic antibiotics were admin-\nistered before all procedures. One endoscopist\n(FP) with expertise in ERCP, EUS and EUS-BD\nperformed all procedures.\nBy using a large-channel curved linear array\nTokyo, Japan), the left hepatic duct was identi-\nfied from the proximal gastric body and punc-\ntured with a 19-gauge needle (EUSN-19A; Cook\nEndoscopy, Winston-Salem, NC, USA). Color\nDoppler was used to detect any intervening ves-\nsel. After confirming bile aspiration, contrast was\ninjected to obtain a cholangiogram (Figure 1). A\n0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire; Boston Scientific,\nNatick, MA, USA) was then advanced into the\nintrahepatic biliary ducts. The needle was\nremoved, and the track was coagulated by using a\n6 Fr cystostome (Endoflex, Belgium) to facilitate\nthe insertion of a 10 mm large fully covered self-\nexpandable metal stent (FCSEMS) (WallFlex;\nBoston Scientific or Hanarostent, MI-Tech, Life\nPartners Europe, Bagnolet, France), generally 80\nmm in length, in the left hepatic duct. When the\nright liver bile ducts appeared to be accessible\nfrom the left ducts, an uncovered SEMS bridging\nthe confluence (Zilverstent; Cook Medical) was\ninserted after guidewire cannulation and balloon\ndilation if necessary, and before FCSEMS\ntransgastric placement (Figures 2 and 3). A sin-\ngle hemostatic clip was generally used to secure\nthe gastric stent end and reduce the risk of stent\nmigration.\nF Moryoussef, A Sportes et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 539\nStatistical analysis\nOnly descriptive statistics have been used. Patient\ncharacteristics and main results are expressed in\nthis report as proportions. Age, survival and\nlength of hospital stay in days are expressed as\nmean (\u00b1 SD) and median (range), whereas bili-\nrubin levels are expressed as mean (\u00b1 SD).\nResults\nPatients\nDuring the study period, 18 patients fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria, out of 52 undergoing EUBD\npatients had EUBD by the transgastric route.

All\npatients had clinical jaundice at the time of\nEUBD, but general condition remained good or\nfair in most patients. The main cause of biliary\nobstruction was loco-regional recurrence of previ-\nously resected biliary (n = 2), gastric (n = 1), and\npancreatic (n = 3) adenocarcinoma in six patients\n(33.3%) followed by hepatic hilar metastases in\nfour patients (22.2%) from colorectal adenocarci-\nnoma (n = 3) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma\n(n = 1). Pancreatic mass from metastatic adeno-\ncarcinoma (n = 3, 16.7%), primary hilar cholan-\ngiocarcinoma (Klatskin's tumor) (n = 3,16.7%)\nand peritoneal carcinomatosis in two patients\n(7.6%) from gastric (n = 1) and pancreatic cancers\n(n = 1) represented following causes of obstruc-\ntion. Because of previous hepatectomy, only 15\npatients presented classable stenosis on Bismuth\nClassification. Thus, we had seven (47%) patients\nwith Bismuth I\u00adII stenosis, seven (47%) patients\nwith Bismuth III stenosis and one (6.7%) with\nBismuth IV stenosis. ERCP was not achievable in\n10 patients (55.6%) as a consequence of a modified\nanatomy after total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y\noeso-jejunal anastomosis (n = 3), duodenopan-\ncreatectomy with Roux-en Y gastro-jejunal\nFigure 1.

Many reports have recently shown\nthat EUBD is an interesting technique when\nERCP is not possible, whether due to a surgically\naltered anatomy or to a proximal gastroduodenal\nobstruction.2\u00ad5 However, since the right liver\naccounts for approximately 60\u00ad70% of the hepa-\ntocellular mass and EUBD gives access in most\ncases to the left ducts (except, but randomly, in\ncase of transduodenal EUBD), this technique\ntends to be limited to distal obstruction, in which\nall EUBD approaches (transduodenal, transgas-\ntric and by transhepatic rendezvous) are in theory\nequally valid.4,6,7 The common approach to cases\nof hilar obstruction after ERCP failure or when\naccess to the major papilla is barred is to refer the\npatient to the interventional radiologist for a per-\ncutaneous transhepatic drainage, in which case\nleft and right liver accesses are available and\nmultiple stenting is possible even for advanced\nstrictures. However, percutaneous drainage is\nassociated with higher morbidity than ERCP and\nis not recommended in case of ascites and mas-\nsive one-sided tumor involvement, thus some-\ntimes restricting available access routes.8\u00ad10 The\nother alternative interventional option of enteros-\ncopy-guided retrograde drainage is poorly attrac-\ntive since papillary access is successful in only\n60\u00ad70% of patients, is very time-consuming and\nhas few drainage options for advanced strictures\nas a consequence of small scope working channel\nand fewer ancillary devices to conduct complex\nprocedures.4 It was therefore interesting to inves-\ntigate to what extent EUBD could provide jaun-\ndice relief even when limited to the left liver lobe,\nwith the knowledge acquired from ERCP studies\nshowing that in selected cases one-sided ERCP\ndrainage of advanced hilar strictures could be effi-\ncient.1,11 Our study shows that EUBD in such\npatients has a high technical success rate (94%),\nwhich was expected, but also a satisfactory rate of\nclinical success (around 70%), allowing patients\nto receive additional chemotherapy (55.6%)\notherwise precluded by obstructive jaundice, and\na low rate of complications (16.7%).\nTechnical EUBD success rate was similar to other\nEUBD studies.12 In only one patient did the left\nduct puncture and stenting fail because bile ducts\nwere not dilated. When comparing patients in this\nstudy with our experience of EUBD in patients\nwith distal obstruction, we found a similar techni-\ncal success rate (100%). It is important to note\nthat all patients with proximal obstruction in our\nseries had EUBD through the transgastric route.\nThis approach has been preferred in our experi-\nence for its absence of significant infectious com-\nplications and possibly lower rate of bile leaks.\nMoreover, EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy is\noften the only available EUBD option, since the\ntransduodenal route does not permit the punc-\nture of intrahepatic ducts and the rendezvous\ntechnique is either impossible (previous surgery)\nor difficult for the same reasons that led to ERCP\nhave been reported after EUBD, but poorly\ndefined criteria for clinical success and inclusion of\nmostly distal strictures may account for the differ-\nence, with a much higher chance of rapid jaundice\nrelief in distal strictures.12 In our own experience of\nEUBD in distal biliary strictures, clinical success\nwas 86%.13 Moreover, since it has been previously\nproven that draining >50% of the liver volume\nmay be an important predictor of success (espe-\ncially in advanced Bismuth III\u00adIV hilar strictures),\nleft lobe drainage could be sufficient in patients\nwith a large left liver.1,11,14 However, clinical suc-\ncess was more rapid when bridging the obstructed\nmain confluence with an uncovered stent when\nsuccessfully attempted, although 3/5 such attempts\nfailed. Such procedures can be very demanding\nand must probably be attempted in only some spe-\ncific, carefully selected cases, when the right\u00adleft\nbalance of functional liver mass suggests a particu-\nlar advantage of draining at least part of the right\nlobe and provided that guidewire loops in the\nhilum can be avoided or reduced before reaching\nthe right sectors.\nArtifon and colleagues, in a single-center randomized\nstudy, did not find any difference after ERCP failure\nbetween EUS-choledochoduodenostomy and percu-\ntaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in\nterms of efficacy and safety, but only distal stenosis\nwere studied (malignant involvement of the second\nF Moryoussef, A Sportes et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 543\nportion of the duodenum and the major papilla).15\nIn a recent work of percutaneous transhepatic bil-\niary metal stenting for malignant hilar obstruction\nlooking at predictive factors for efficacy in 159\npatients from a single center, Li and colleagues\nreported a technical success rate of 100% and a\nsimilar to ours, except that clinical success in Li's\nstudy was defined by a decrease of only 30% at 7\ndays. Morbidity results from Li's study (26.4%)\nsuggest more severe and more frequent complica-\ntions than after EUBD. Direct comparisons with\nour results are not possible, but this indicates that\nEUBD and PTBD might have similar efficacies in\nhilar obstructions. Moreover, PTBD may need\nreinterventions especially when the most com-\nmon two-step approach is chosen, with an exter-\nnal drain in place for a few days before stenting.\nAs with Artifon and colleagues, a recent prospec-\ntive study comparing EUBD in our center and\nPTBD by an expert interventional radiologist\nfor proximal and distal biliary obstruction found\nsimilar success and adverse events rate but a lower\nnumber of reintervention and length of hospitali-\nzation favoring EUBD.\nAs long as a patient with non-curable malignant\ndisease remains in fair condition and is willing to\nundergo additional treatments to extend survival\nand improve comfort, the current trend in clinical\noncology is to offer chemotherapy whenever\npossible. Most chemotherapy requires good\nliver function and an effective biliary clearance.\nEffective biliary drainage is therefore a prerequi-\nsite, not only for the patient's quality of life and\nnutritional stabilization, but also to allow chemo-\ntherapy to be administered. We found no pub-\nlished result of that kind in EUBD studies, but in\na retrospective study of 71 patients with advanced\nsolid malignancies and hilar biliary obstruction\ntreated with PTBD, chemotherapy administra-\ntion was possible in 55% of patients17 \u00ad that is,\nexactly the same rate as in the present study.\nMoreover, EUBD in this subgroup of patients\nwho could receive chemotherapy allowed high\nThe complication rate of 16.7% is lower than the\n22% rate reported in Park's meta-analysis,12 and\ncan be deemed acceptable, but it must be noted\nthat one of our patients died from severe bleeding\na few days after EUBD. Bleeding and bile leak are\nthe two most serious complications to be antici-\npated after EUBD and must be prevented as\nmuch as possible by a perfect correction of coagu-\nlation and an expert handling of the EUBD\nprocedure.\nThe present work presented one main limitation,\nwhich was the small number of patients because\nEUBD after ERCP failure is not well known\namong oncologists, who still address patients for\nConclusion\nEUBD is a feasible and effective technique for\nproximal biliary obstruction after ERCP failure,\nas well as in patients with surgically altered anat-\nomy. Bridge-trans-hilar stenting can be attempted\nin selected cases, with a lower feasibility rate but\ngood clinical outcome when successful. EUBD\ncan make chemotherapy feasible.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1.
