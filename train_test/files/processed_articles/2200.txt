Over 30% of women in the\nUnited States (U.S.) are physically victimized by their intimate\npartners at some point during their lives.1 Although similar\nrates have been found for men and women, the consequences\nof male-to-female IPV are decidedly more severe; the majority\nof patients who visit emergency departments for IPV-related\ninjuries are women,2 and far more women are killed at the\nhands of male partners than the converse.3 This study analyzed\nlongitudinal data on women's experiences of IPV\nvictimization to test whether there is a single trajectory of IPV\nacross time that represents all women or if there are multiple\ntrajectories.\nBecause IPV occurs within the context of intimate\nrelationships, it is common for women to be repeatedly\nvictimized: one in three victims of IPV reported experiencing\n4 or more incidents of physical violence committed by the\nsame partner.4 In fact, the strongest predictor of IPV\nvictimization is previous victimization.5 Researchers know\nmore about characteristics of perpetrators who commit\nmultiple acts of IPV, than about victims.6,7 Researchers also\nknow a large proportion of IPV victims were also victims of\nchildhood abuse, a phenomenon known as revictimization.8,9\nRevictimized women report experiencing significantly more\ndepression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder related\nWestern Journal of Emergency Medicine Volume XIII, NO. 3 : August 2012\nsymptomology than women without a history of\nThe purpose of this investigation is to determine whether\nlatent trajectories of physical IPV victimization exist, and if so,\nthe role of revictimization in these trajectories. We tested a\nseries of latent class growth models to assess meaningful\npatterns of IPV experiences using longitudinal data collected\nfrom female college students. Latent class growth analysis\n(LCGA) is a simplified case of growth mixture modeling where\nwithin-class variances are fixed at zero.11,12 This technique has\nbeen used previously to explore trajectories of female sexual\nOur first research question concerned latent heterogeneity\nwithin our sample in terms of the frequency of IPVexperiences\nacross time. Based on the previous literature, we expected to\nfind at least 2 distinct subgroups: a large group of women who\nwere not victimized during adolescence or college and a\nsmaller group of women who were consistently victimized\nacross this time period.5\nOur second research question examined whether negative\nchildhood experiences could differentiate between groups that\nemerged. To test this question we explored whether childhood\nsexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence and parental\nphysical punishment predicted latent trajectory membership.\nConsistent with previous literature, we hypothesized these\nnegative childhood experiences would differentially predict\nIPV trajectory membership.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nData for this study are part of a large longitudinal dataset\nof social experiences (data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.\nwomen enrolled at a medium-sized university in the\nsoutheastern U.S. Two incoming classes of first-year women\nwere invited to complete a series of 5 surveys over 4 years of\ncollege; 85% of women invited agreed to participate by\ncompleting the initial survey (n \u00bc 1,575). Approximately\nas Caucasian, and 3.8% identified with other ethnic groups.\nParticipants' average age was 18.3 years; 92.8% had never been\nmarried.\nProcedure\nThe local institutional review board approved all\nprocedures. The surveys gauged a number of social\nexperiences including predictors, correlates, and\nconsequences of interpersonal violence. Data collection at the\nfirst time-point--negative childhood experiences and\nadolescent IPV victimization--was conducted during the\nuniversity's fall first-year orientation for 2 consecutive years\nwith hour-long sessions conducted by trained undergraduate\norientation leaders. Leaders acquired informed consent before\nsurvey administration after explaining the purpose and\nmethod of data collection. Experiences during each year of\ncollege--collegiate IPV victimization--were assessed at the\nend of the spring semester over the subsequent four years.\nParticipants were given $15 in exchange for each survey\ncompleted. To protect confidentiality, the third author\nobtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality from the\nNational Institutes of Mental Health. Yearly participant\n47.2% of the initial sample completed all 5 time-points of the\nstudy.\nMeasures\nIntimate Partner Violence (IPV). The Conflict Tactics Scale\n(CTS)14,15 assessed physical IPV victimization during\nadolescence and college. The CTS has been the most widely\nused measure over 3 decades of research on conflict and\nviolence within intimate relationships. Participants are asked to\nindicate the number of times they have experienced: (1) threats\nto hit or throw something at the participant; (2) throwing\nsomething; (3) pushing, grabbing, or shoving; (4) hitting or\nattempting to hit, but not with anything; or (5) hitting or\nattempting to hit with something hard. The item assessing\nwhether a respondent was ``beaten up'' was excluded due to low\nendorsement-rates during pilot testing. Participants responded\nto each item on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1\u00bc``never,'' 2\nthan 10 times.'' IPV experiences during high school were\nassessed at the first time point, and experiences during each\nyear of college were measured during each subsequent time\npoints. Responses were coded so ``never'' was scored 0, ``once''\nscored 6, and ``more than 10 times'' was scored 11.\nNegative Childhood Experiences. Participants provided\nretrospective reports of childhood sexual abuse, parental\nphysical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence during initial\ndata collection. Each form of abuse was assessed based on\nmeasures used by Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski.16\nChildhood Sexual Abuse. Childhood sexual abuse was defined\nas being a victim of sexual acts perpetrated by an adult or any\ncoercive sexual act perpetrated by a similarly-aged peer prior\nto the age of 14 (e.g., ``A person fondled you in a sexual way\nor touched your sex organs or asked you to touch their sex\norgans''). Four items were recorded on 5-point scales ranging\nfrom ``Never had this experience'' to ``More than 5 times;'' the\nresulting childhood sexual abuse frequency ranged from 0 to\nParental Physical Abuse. Parental physical abuse was defined\nas recurrent experiences, rather than rare events, during\nchildhood. Participants read the following: ``Physical blows\n(like hitting, kicking, throwing someone down) sometimes\noccur between family members. For an average month, when\nSwartout et al Trajectories of IPV\nVolume XIII, NO. 3 : August 2012 Western Journal of Emergency Medicine\nyou were growing up (i.e., ages 8 to 14 years), indicate how\noften one of your parents did this to you.'' Participants\nresponded on a 5-point scale ranging from ``Never'' to ``Over\n20 times.'' Responses were recoded to yield a frequency score\nWitnessing Domestic Violence. Witnessing domestic\nviolence was defined by the statement: ``For an average month,\nindicate how often one of your parents or stepparents delivered\nphysical blows to the other.'' Participants responded on a 5-\npoint scale ranging from ``Never'' to ``Over 20 times.''\nResponses were recoded to yield a witnessing domestic\nviolence frequency that ranged from 0 to 21.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe conducted an LCGA with Mplus version 5.1 to\nestimate models using maximum likelihood estimation with\nrobust standard errors.17 Because this estimator assumes data\nare missing at random, it uses all cases and all data to estimate\nmodel parameters.18 Please see White and Smith (2009) for an\noverview of attrition within this sample.19 The frequency of\nphysical victimization at each time-point was entered as an\nindicator in the analysis. Thus, the latent trajectory class\nstructure is based on patterns of physical victimization\nfrequency across time. We designated the frequency variables\nas count, which prompted the software to use a Poisson\ndistribution--where the mean equals the conditional\nvariance.20 To assess the power of past negative childhood\nexperiences in discriminating between latent trajectory classes,\nwe regressed class membership on childhood sexual abuse,\nparental physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence;\nalthough these three variables were not used to estimate the\nlatent groups or classes.\nThe data were fit to LCGA models ranging from 1 to 5\nclasses. When building a mixture model there is no singular\nindicator of model fit; multiple statistical indicators must be\npaired with a theoretical understanding of the constructs to\ndetermine an appropriate class structure.21,22 We used the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Lo-Mendell-\nRubin adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test to compare model fit, and\nentropy and posterior probabilities to compare how cleanly\neach model classified cases into each class structure.23 In\naddition, we reviewed plots of estimated means for each model\nto compare heterogeneous class structures with past theoretical\nand empirical information concerning frequency of sexual\nvictimization. We used negative childhood experience\ncovariates to establish additional discriminant validity between\nthe latent trajectory classes.24\nRESULTS\nMeans, standard deviations, and correlations between\nvariables used in the modeling process are presented in Table 1.\nThe five-class model best fit the data, significantly better than\nthe 4-class model (p\u00bc0.04) according to the Lo-Mendell-Rubin\nadjusted Likelihood Ratio Test. The 5-class model has a higher\nBIC compared with the 4-class model; although the entropy is a\nbit lower for the 5-class model compared with the 4-class model\n(.904 versus .921), both exhibited respectable classification\nquality. Finally, we selected the 5-class model because we\nfound it most interpretable; see Figure 1 for the estimated\nmeans plot of the 5-class model. We interpreted each of the\nlatent trajectory classes below based on parameters noted in\nTable 2 and the plot depicted in Figure 1.\nLow or No IPV\nOf the 5 classes, this class had the highest most-likely\nclass is significantly lower than the average frequency at\nbaseline (see Table 3). Although the linear and quadratic slopes\nare significant, the frequency of IPV in this trajectory starts and\nstays low across the 5 time-points (Figure 1). Because most-\nlikely members of this class experienced little to no\nvictimization across the study, this class was used as the\nreference group for the multinomial logistic regressions of\nlatent trajectory class membership on the negative childhood\nexperience variables.\nLow to Moderate IPV\nThis class is estimated to account for over 12% of the\nsample (n\u00bc200). The intercept of this trajectory class is not\nsignificantly different from average, but its linear slope is\nsignificantly positive and its quadratic slope is significantly\nnegative (Table 3). This translates to a trajectory including\nwomen who have slightly elevated levels of victimization\nduring adolescence and then experience more IPV as they\nprogress through college, although this increase is somewhat\nattenuated during their fourth year of college (Figure 1). We\ninterpreted this latent class as the low to moderate IPV\ntrajectory for these reasons.\nModerate to Low IPV\nThis class accounted for over an estimated 14% of the\nsample (n\u00bc218). The intercept of this trajectory class is\nsignificantly higher than average, the linear slope is\nsignificantly negative, and the quadratic slope is significantly\npositive (see Table 3). Figure 1 and Table 4 show IPV\nfrequency is elevated during adolescence but drops sharply\nbeginning at year 1 of college to a consistently low frequency\nthereafter. For this reason we interpreted this latent class as the\nmoderate to low IPV trajectory.\nHigh to Moderate IPV\nThis class is one of the smaller groups in terms of most-\nlikely membership (n\u00bc47, 3.0%). In a similar pattern to the\nmoderate to low trajectory, this trajectory has a significantly\nabove average intercept, a significantly negative linear slope,\nand a significantly positive quadratic slope. The obvious\ndifference between these two trajectories--as depicted in\nTrajectories of IPV Swartout et al\nWestern Journal of Emergency Medicine Volume XIII, NO. 3 : August 2012\nFigure 1--is the intercept of this trajectory greatly exceeds that\nof the moderate-to-low IPV trajectory. Women in this IPV\ntrajectory are the most highly victimized group during\nadolescence, but these levels drop sharply at year 1 of college,\nalthough a moderate level of victimization persists across\ncollege. We interpreted this latent class as the high to moderate\nIPV trajectory.\nHigh to Increasing IPV\nThe final class is the smallest group in terms of most likely\nmembership (n\u00bc44, 2.8%). The intercept of this class trajectory\nis significantly higher than the average, the linear slope is\nsignificantly positive, but the quadratic slope is significantly\nnegative (Table 3). This translates to a trajectory of women who\nare highly victimized during adolescence and whose average\nfrequency of victimization experiences actually increase in\nnumber after they enter college, although this increase is\nsomewhat attenuated toward their later 2 years of college\n(Figure 1). These factors let us to interpret this latent class as\nthe high to increasing IPV trajectory.\nNegative Childhood Experiences\nWe specified observed negative childhood experience\nvariables as auxiliary covariates to predict latent trajectory class\nmembership. With the low or no trajectory class as the\nreference group, multinomial logistic regressions suggested\nthat negative childhood experiences predicted IPV\nvictimization trajectory membership (Table 3). Childhood\nsexual abuse predicted membership in all of the elevated IPV\nvictimization trajectories when compared with the low or no\nvictimization trajectory. Furthermore, witnessing domestic\nviolence predicted membership in the high to moderate\ntrajectory, and parental physical abuse marginally predicted\nhigh to increasing trajectory membership.\nDISCUSSION\nOur primary goal was to investigate the heterogeneity of\nwomen's experiences of IPV beginning in adolescence and\nspanning their 4 years of college. Using a person-centered\napproach to longitudinal data analysis, we identified 5 clearly\narticulated trajectories. Based upon estimated intercepts and\nslopes for each trajectory, the 5 IPV trajectories were\ninterpreted as low or no, low to moderate, moderate to low, high\nto moderate, and high to increasing. This distribution of\ntrajectories suggests college women have very diverse\nTable 1.

The\nperiod between adolescence and the end of the first year of\ncollege seems to be where most of the change occurs, in both\npositive and negative directions.\nOur second goal was to predict trajectory membership with\nnegative childhood experiences. Women who were victims of\nchildhood physical abuse are more likely to be in the trajectory\ncharacterized by frequent and consistent IPV--findings\nconsistent with the revictimization literature.8\u00ad10 Childhood\nsexual abuse predicted membership in all 4 elevated IPV\ntrajectories, underscoring its central role in future victimization\nexperiences. Witnessing domestic violence predicted\nmembership in the high to moderate trajectory and childhood\nphysical abuse predicted membership in the high to increasing\ntrajectory, the 2 most worrisome trajectories.\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to decrease or even\nprevent IPV. To prevent IPV, we must understand patterns of\nrisk. Our analyses suggest how IPV risk can change over time\nfor different groups of women. Many IPV prevention and\nintervention programs are indiscriminately applied with the\nbelief that all girls and women are at relatively equal risk of\nbecoming victims, although the literature has indicated\notherwise for some time.4,5 Differential patterns of IPV\napparent in our data suggest the need for prevention strategies\nfor women that consider victimization experiences in childhood\nand early adulthood. Future investigation should focus on other\nchildhood variables predicting future IPV trajectories, such as\nfamily income, parents' education, and the presence of\nsubstance use in the home. Future research should also assess\nfactors leading to these increases and decreases in IPV shortly\nafter college matriculation to better understand IPV risk and\nprotective factors.\nLIMITATIONS\nAll data used for these analyses were collected from\nstudents at 1 Southeastern university. Although the Carnegie\nFoundation has found students at this institution to be\nrepresentative of all students at U.S. state colleges and\nuniversities,25 the findings of this study may not generalize to\nall female U.S. college students, students from other countries,\nor non-college populations. The IPV literature does not suggest\ntrajectories would differ across subpopulations of women;\nhowever, caution should be used in generalizing these findings.\nAnother limitation of this work was its primary focus on the\nfrequency of women's IPV experiences. By limiting the scope\nof the current research to frequency of victimization, all IPV\nexperiences are given the same weight in the analysis. Future\nresearch designs that include examinations of IPV severity or\nother assault characteristics will extend the current findings.\nFinally, witnessing domestic violence and physical abuse\nduring childhood each were measured with 1 item; future\nresearch should use validated measures including multiple\nitems to assess each construct.\nCONCLUSION\nThe present study makes the case for subgroups of college\nwomen in terms of their patterns of IPV frequency across time.\nLCGA identified 5 classes across adolescence and 4 years of\ncollege. These 5 classes are interpreted as low or no, low to\nmoderate, moderate to low, high to moderate, and high to\nincreasing IPV trajectories of victimization across time.\nNegative childhood experiences--childhood sexual abuse,\nwitnessing domestic violence, and parental physical\npunishment--distinguished between the latent trajectories.\nApplication of research that distinguishes cohesive subgroups\nof victims may inform the disparate efforts of IPV prevention\nprograms.\nAddress for Correspondence: Kevin M Swartout, PhD, Georgia\nState University, Atlanta, Georgia.
