    "abstract": "Abstract. Objective: To compare the effects of\nHMOs with the effects of other types of private health\ninsurance on nonurgent ED visits in the pediatric\npopulation. Methods: Secondary analysis of the\nemergency component of the 1994 National Hospital\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) on pa-\ntients aged 15 years or less. Variables of interest in-\ncluded urgency of visit, age, sex, race, ethnicity,\nmethod of payment (HMO, private insurance/non-\nHMO, and others), and chief complaint. A p-value of\n0.01 was used as the threshold for significance to off-\nset the effects of increases in variability and signifi-\ncance of p-values and narrow confidence intervals.\nResults: There were 6,744 observations. The overall\nrate of nonurgent ED visits was 58%. The rate of non-\nurgent visits for HMO patients was 51%, for private\nnon-HMO insurance 56%, and for other types of pay-\nment (Medicare, Medicaid, patient paid, no charge,\nand other government) 60%. Chief complaints for\nnonurgent visits were general symptoms, EENT (ear,\neyes, nose, and throat) symptoms, and dermatologic\nsymptoms. After multivariate analysis, the odds ratio\nfor patients with private insurance for a nonurgent\nvisit compared with HMO patients was 1.27, with a\nand chief complaint. Conclusion: Pediatric patients\nwith private insurance were more likely to present\nfor emergency care for nonurgent reasons when com-\npared with HMO patients after adjusting for the\nabove listed variables. The reasons for this disparity\nshould be further explored. ",

ACADEMIC\nTRADITIONALLY, EDs were developed pri-\nmarily to provide treatment for patients with\nunanticipated life-threatening and urgent condi-\ntions. However, the utilization of the ED has in-\ncreased in both volume and scope over the past ten\nyears, with a rising percentage of nonurgent\ncases.1,2 Nonurgent ED visits can lead to inefficient\nutilization of resources, ED case overload, and\novercrowding.3,4 Most nonurgent ED problems\nhave been shown to be more effectively and effi-\nciently dealt with in a primary care setting.3,4\nNonurgent ED visits seem to be particularly\nprevalent in the pediatric population, as evidenced\nby a nationwide ED survey of 240 EDs. These re-\nsearchers found that 70% of all ED visits were non-\nurgent.5 Previous studies have demonstrated that\nnon\u00admanaged-care patients have higher rates of\nnonurgent ED presentations compared with pa-\ntients who required prior physician approval.\nMacKoul et al.6 found that Medicaid patients who\npresented to the ED were younger and had lower\nFrom the Division of Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital,\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, MA (CF).\nemy of Pediatrics annual meeting, San Francisco, CA, October\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Christina Fong, MB,\nBS, MPH, Academic Department of Accident and Emergency\nMedicine, Imperial College School of Medicine, St. Mary's Hos-\npital, Praed Street, London, W2 1NY, United Kingdom. e-mail:\ncfong@cwcom.net\nillness severity scores. In another consumer survey\nperformed by Chande et al.,7 patients with medical\nassistance (i.e., Medicaid) used the ED more for\nminor illnesses than did patients with commercial\ninsurance, despite the fact that almost all patients\nidentified a primary care provider. One of the main\ndifferences in patient management of HMOs as op-\nposed to non-HMO private insurance is gatekeep-\ning. Could this be an effective mechanism for re-\nducing nonurgent ED visits?\nFranco et al.8 showed this to be true. They stud-\nied a program (KenPAC) that required 24-hour ac-\ncess to a primary care physician with ED gate-\nkeeping responsibility before and after it was\ncommenced. They found that nonurgent ED visits\nKenPAC and after KenPAC was instituted, respec-\ntively.\nHowever, apart from gatekeeping or prior phy-\nsician approval, other factors have been purported\nto affect the utilization of the ED by children.\nThese include difficulties with transportation or\naccess, parents' work responsibilities, problems\nwith sibling care, acuity of illness, reduced avail-\nability of alternate health services, parents' per-\nceptions of the child's condition, and insurance\nThe main objective of this study was to compare\nthe patterns of ED use of individuals participating\nin HMOs with those of individuals having other\ntypes of private health insurance in the pediatric\npopulation. The main hypothesis was that HMO\npatients are less likely to present to the ED for\nnonurgent reasons than private health insurance\npatients. It is theorized that HMOs have reduced\nthese unnecessary ED visits by gatekeeping and\nthe provision of more primary care providers to\ntheir subscribers. This study sought to compare\nthese two populations assuming that the services\nprovided by private insurance and HMOs were\nsimilar, with the exception of gatekeeping prac-\ntices.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design. The National Hospital Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) 1994 is a na-\ntional probability survey conducted by the Division\nof Health Care Statistics, CDC.12,13 This cross-sec-\noutpatient departments of a national sample of\nhospitals. The NHAMCS used a four-stage proba-\nbility design with clustered samples described as\nprimary sampling units. The effect of clustered\nsampling is to increase the significance of p-values\nand narrow confidence intervals. Therefore, the\nthreshold for significance in the analyses was set\nat p = 0.01.14 The retrospective nature of this study\nusing an existing database made it exempt from\ninstitutional review board review.\nStudy Protocol. Data collection was carried out\nover a four-week reporting period during which a\ntrained member of the ED staff completed a pa-\ntient record form. Patient visit data were recorded\nfor each sample visit using either a prospective or\na retrospective data collection method. In the pro-\nspective approach, the hospital sampled patient\nvisits and then completed the patient record forms\n(largely through observation) during or shortly af-\nter the sample visit. In the retrospective approach,\nhospital staff sampled visits after the patients\nwere seen and then completed patient record forms\nthrough medical record abstraction.15\nAmong the variables collected on the form are\nage, race, sex, and ethnicity of the patient, reason\nfor the visit, physician's diagnosis, cause of injury,\nsurgical procedures, medication therapy, expected\nsource of payment, diagnostic/screening services,\nurgency of the visit, providers seen during the\nvisit, and disposition of the visit. To maintain ac-\ncuracy of the measure, the survey was tested by\nreinterviewing a selected subsample over the sub-\nsequent one and two years.\nModifications to the survey were carried out\nthroughout the sampling frame of ten years to ad-\njust for secular changes in the domains measured.\nFurthermore, internal validity checks included\nNHAMCS field representative training, hospital\ninduction courses, periodic supervised patient\nsampling, editing completed forms, and retrieving\nmissing data. Missing data were imputed as de-\nscribed by Massey.16\npublic datafile available from the U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services, National Center\nlease. During the 12-month period from January\nwere made to hospital EDs of nonfederal, short-\nstay, or general hospitals in the United States.\nChildren under 15 years of age made up one fourth\npatient visits. This analysis included those pa-\ntients of all ages.\nMeasures. The variables extracted from the sur-\nvey datafile included:\n\u00b7 Urgency of the ED presentation (urgent vs non-\nurgent vs emergent): Nonurgent visits were de-\nfined as visits for ``patients who do not require at-\ntention immediately or within a few hours.''\n\u00b7 Patient characteristics: age (patients of 15 years\nor less), sex, race, and ethnicity.\n\u00b7 Method of payment: HMO, private insurance\n(non-HMO), and other (which comprised Medicare,\nMedicaid, other government insurance, no pay-\nment, self-payment, and unspecified). We were un-\nable to determine what percentage of HMOs pri-\nmarily served Medicaid patients; however, the\nsurvey was performed at a time where Medicaid\nmanaged care systems were less prevalent than it\nis now.\n\u00b7 Primary reason for presentation as categorized\nby symptom module: general symptoms (refers to\nconstitutional symptoms such as chills, fever, fa-\ntigue, and weight loss); psychiatric symptoms; and\nsymptoms pertaining to the nervous, cardiovascu-\nlar, eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT), respiratory,\ndigestive, genitourinary, dermatologic, or muscu-\nloskeletal systems.\nData Analysis. The sample weights provided in\nthe datafile were used so that the descriptive sta-\ntistics and analyses reflected a sample of children\naged 15 years or less representative of similarly\naged children in the United States. This was done\nto compensate for the oversampling of the aged,\nHispanics, blacks, and the lower socioeconomic\nstrata of the NHAMCS.10\nAll variables of interest were kept as discrete\nvariables, except for age, which was left as a con-\ntinuous variable. In the analysis of the raw data,\nit was found that there were some patients who\noverlapped into both HMO and private insurance\ngroups. Because the objective of the study was to\nspecifically compare HMOs with other forms of pri-\nvate insurances, mixed-model HMOs were coded\nunder the HMO group.\nTABLE 1.

The pri-\nmary outcome variable was the urgency status of\nthe ED visit (urgent/nonurgent). A stepwise selec-\ntion procedure was used to identify significant pre-\ndictors of nonurgent visits in addition to type of\ninsurance to construct the most parsimonious\nmodel. Variables that were not retained in the final\nmodel by stepwise selection were later examined\nas potential confounders. This was done by includ-\ning each variable in the final model to determine\nwhether the parameter estimates of the variable of\ninterest (HMO patients) were changed by more\nthan 10%. As noted above, variables were retained\nin the final model that was significant at the 0.01\nlevel. The SAS statistical software package was\nused for all analyses. Continuous data are ex-\npressed as mean  standard deviation.\nRESULTS\nPatient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\nThere were 6,744 weighted observations in the\ndata set for children aged 15 years or less. There\nwere 3,894 nonurgent visits made to the ED,\nwhere the overall rate was 58%. The mean age of\npresentation for nonurgent visits was 5.3  4.8\nyears and for urgent visits, 5.9  5.0 years. Forty-\neight percent of nonurgent visits were made by fe-\nmales and 52% by males. In the urgent ED visit\ngroup, 43% were females and 57% were males. The\ndistributions of race and ethnicity were similar for\nnonurgent and urgent visits.\ninsured patients, 30% had private insurance, and\n60% received other types of payment. In contrast,\nHMOs, 33% had non-HMO private insurance, and\n55% had other forms of payment.\nInsurance types of patients with nonurgent vis-\nits are outlined in Table 2. The rate of nonurgent\nvisits in patients with HMOs was 51%. This rate\nwas marginally higher in the non-HMO private in-\nsurance patients, who had a nonurgent ED visit\nrate of 56%, and highest in the other payment\ngroup, which was 60%.\nPrimary complaint for presentation according\nto symptom is detailed in Table 3. Seventy percent\nof all visits were coded by symptoms of different\nsystems. Of these, the most common complaints of\nnonurgent visits were general symptoms, EENT\nsymptoms, and dermatologic symptoms.\nThe multivariate analysis (Table 4) demon-\nstrated the rates of nonurgent visits, and crude\nand adjusted ORs of significant variables identified\nby logistic regression.

Therefore, having HMO in-\nsurance appears to be preventive of nonurgent\nvisits.\nThe private non-HMO insurance odds ratio was\ninitially predictive of nonurgent visits, with an OR\nof 1.20. After controlling for age, sex, and general,\nEENT, and dermatologic symptoms, the OR in-\ncreased to 1.27. This change may be due to the\nconfounding effects of the primary complaints that\nare predictive of nonurgent visits. General symp-\ntoms, dermatologic problems, and EENT symp-\ntoms were found to be statistically significant uni-\nvariate predictors of nonurgent visits (Table 3). In\na subgroup analysis of the three methods of pay-\nment, the private non-HMO patients had a lower\nrate of the primary complaints that were corre-\nlated with nonurgent visits (Table 5). Therefore, by\ncontrolling for these and other potential variables\nthat might affect the outcome of the primary var-\niable (nonurgent visits) by logistic regression, we\nwere able to calculate an OR that reflected a more\naccurate effect of insurance status on nonurgent\nvisits.\nAnother potential confounder, socioeconomic\nstatus, which was not available in the data set, is\nlikely to be related to the type of insurance.11 To\nprevent socioeconomic status from confounding the\nOR for insurance type, government health insur-\nance and Medicaid were not included in the private\ninsurance group because these patients may be of\na lower socioeconomic status. It was assumed that\nthe socioeconomic statuses of patients with HMOs\nand private insurance were similar.\nThe effect of the type of insurance on nonurgent\nED visits may be due not only to gatekeeping but\nalso to other potential factors such as access to\nhealth care and the presence of a regular physi-\ncian. It may be that patients with HMOs have bet-\nter access to a regular primary care physician,\nwhich would be another reason for a lower rate of\nnonurgent visit to the ED. Smith and McNamara11\ndemonstrated that a substantial proportion of chil-\ndren seen in their ED for minor illness had no des-\nignated pediatric provider or had a provider to\nwhom access was difficult.\nOne of the major limitations of this study is that\nthe rate of actual ``gatekeeping'' was not measured.\nIt is unknown how many HMO patients who were\nseen in the ED actually had prior contact with\ntheir HMOs. Similarly, we do not know how many\npatients who actually communicated with their\nHMOs appropriately were advised to not present\nto the ED. Therefore, by not capturing the patients\nin both the HMO and privately insured groups who\ndid not present to the ED for nonurgent problems,\nwe are not able to estimate the true rates of non-\nurgent ED visits. In future studies, this factor\ncould be explored by obtaining from HMOs how\nmany patients communicated with their gatekeep-\ners prior to their ED presentation and by parental\ninterview to determine what factors led to the ED\nvisit.\nAnother limitation of this study is that the time\nof presentation of these nonurgent visits was not\navailable. The inclusion of this missing factor in\nthe analysis could demonstrate entirely different\nED utilization patterns in the different groups of\npatients. A nonurgent ED visit may be entirely ap-\npropriate at a time when no other alternate health\ncare is available.\nAs mentioned under statistical analysis, we at-\ntempted to avoid excluding patients with private\ninsurance and HMOs as coding them in the HMO\ngroup. However, we were unable to identify any\nMedicaid managed care patients that may have\nHMOs (since the insurance status was classified as\nMedicaid only). This missing variable may have\nunderestimated the rate of nonurgent ED visits in\nthe HMO group if patients with Medicaid and\nHMOs who presented with nonurgent problems\nwere excluded from the HMO group. This would\npotentially bias the result, favoring HMOs as bet-\nter than private non-HMO insurers in preventing\nnonurgent visits to the ED.\nThe definition of ``nonurgency'' used in the\nNHAMCS does not directly address visits for\nsymptoms that would cause a ``prudent layperson''\nto seek emergency care but for which it was later\ndeemed by the ED staff to be unnecessary. For the\npurposes of the survey, nonurgent visits were de-\nfined as visits for ``patients who do not require\nattention immediately or within a few hours.'' Such\npatients won't be considered urgent or appropriate\nbased on the parent's definition/perception,\nwhereas the NHAMCS respondents may have de-\ntermined the level of urgency based on the pa-\ntient's symptoms, diagnostic tests, the physician's\ndiagnosis, or the treatment provided. Further-\nmore, a nonurgent problem may be entirely appro-\npriate if other alternatives are unavailable. In a\nsurvey of 268 ED patients considered to be non-\nurgent by the triage nurse in an urban ED, Gill\nand Riley17 found that 82% of patients rated their\nproblems as urgent and appropriate. It is hoped\nthat prospective studies will define the difference\nbetween nonurgent and inappropriate presenta-\ntions.\nFinally, the objectives of the NHAMCS data-\nbase were to produce descriptive statistics about\nthe health and health-related parameters of the\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population of the\nUnited States. One of their basic variables of in-\nterest is the utilization of the ED. Therefore, the\nNHAMCS definition of nonurgent may not be ideal\nfor our study hypothesis. However, this survey is\ncurrently the closest measure for evaluating the\nincidence of nonurgent visits.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite its limitations, this study supports the hy-\npothesis that patients with HMOs present to the\nED less often with nonurgent complaints than do\nthose with other private health insurance. The\ncause of this effect remains to be investigated in\nfuture prospective studies.\nThe author thanks Stephen Gilman for his assistance in the\npreparation of the manuscript. Drs.
