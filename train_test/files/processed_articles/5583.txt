    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is a need to better understand contemporary issues of nomenclature and group construction around people with\nintersex variations shaping health research and practices--including their framing within concepts like disorders of sex\ndevelopment (DSD), intersex, or the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) umbrella. This article reviews\nhealth literature in the broad field of Intersex Studies since 2015. It outlines the contexts, theoretical lenses, methods and\nparticipant numbers, framing of participants, and health findings around interventions evident in 61 sources. Sources came\nfrom the African region, American Canadian region, Asia-Pacific region, European region, and the Middle East. While health-\nrelated work was largely found in medical journals, it was also located in publications focused on a range of other fields\nincluding, for example, bioethics, education, and legal studies. The piece discusses the tensions between institutional expert-\ncentered work with a traditional clinical/medical lens and the arguments found in a range of other patient-centered, community\ngroup\u00adcentered, and theory-centered sources applying innovative perspectives onto key issues. Liberal Constructivist,\nBioethical Narrative Inquiry, Critical Intersex Studies, and Critical LGBTI Liberationist lenses have introduced a range of\nmethods (from autobiographical analyses through to large-scale online surveys) to questions of the need for and processes\nof certain health care interventions and norms in the treatment of patients with intersex variations. Problematic practices\nin clinical health care and research are identified and discussed: particularly the lack of adequate information dissemination\nand consent-gleaning in areas ranging from anatomical photography through to application of \"corrective\" genital surgeries.\n",

Intersex variations are atypical sex characteristics\n(Organisation Intersex International [OII] Australia, 2012b);\nthese sex characteristics potentially include our chromo-\nsomes, genes, external genitalia, internal reproductive\norgans, hormones, or secondary characteristics (like body\nhair). In the last decade, people with intersex variations have\nbeen increasingly studied or referred to as part of an umbrella\ngroup, rather than seen only as those with a specific variation\nsuch as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) or androgen\ninsensitivity syndromes (AIS). This group has been termed\n(however, incorrectly or inappropriately) hermaphroditic,\nintersex, as having disorders or differentiation of sex devel-\nopment, or otherwise.\nProblems in research beyond variable terminology include\nvariable population estimates. Research has generally esti-\nmated that 1.7% to 4% of people go on to actually have intersex\n2012b). Given that many elements of sex (chromosomes,\ngenes, hormones) are not apparent without testing, current esti-\nmates of the incidence and types of intersex variations seen in\nhumans may be conservative. Some common intersex varia-\ntions are diagnosed prenatally, some at birth; others may only\nbecome apparent at puberty, when trying to conceive, or\nthrough random chance; and it is important to emphasize that\nmany people will never know they have intersex variations.\nMany individuals with intersex variations have two or more\nvariations (Jones et al., 2016). Numbers can also be impacted\nby the inclusion of congenital variations stemming from hor-\nmone-related conditions; some researchers have included\nextreme polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\u00adrelated hyperan-\ndrogenism within the umbrella of intersex variations (Huang,\nresearchers may intentionally or unintentionally include indi-\nviduals who identify as intersex as a gender or political identity\n1Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nTiffany Jones, ARC DECRA Fellow, Department of Educational Studies,\nMacquarie University, Balaclava Rd., Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.\nEmail: tiffany.jones@mq.edu.au\nIntersex Studies: A Systematic\nReview of International Health Literature\nTiffany Jones1\n Keywords\nintersex, DSD, LGBTI, health, intervention\n2 SAGE Open\nchoice--without having somatic intersex variations. There is,\nhowever, a need in health research to limit the group to only\nthose with somatic intersex variations (regardless of gender/\npolitical identity), due to their distinct medical experiences\nAnother complicating issue is that the health of people\nwith intersex variations is sometimes studied in relation to\ntheir sex traits, disabilities, rights, or a range of issues that\nseem to lend themselves to divergent theoretical lenses\nunderstanding this group and their needs in very different\nways. There is a need to understand how issues of group con-\nstruction and nomenclature shape health research around\npeople with intersex variations. This article reviews the\nrange of ways in which the health and well-being of people\nwith somatic intersex variations have been recently studied\nin international research literature. It uses a critical sociology\nof health frame, responding to and foregrounding recent\nintersex activist movements casting intersex variations as a\nbiological variation rather than a medical pathology (Holmes,\nintersex individuals' own research on their own health and\nwell-being experience as part of the key literature to be\nexplored (rather than limiting the parameters of health litera-\nture purely to that produced by traditionally conceived medi-\ncal experts).The method for the review is explained, followed\nby key trends in the literature sources--their contexts, theo-\nretical lenses, methods and participant numbers, and framing\nof participants and interventions. This article then discusses\nissues that arise from these trends and draws conclusions on\nkey tensions in the field.\nMethod\nThe review aimed to explore how people with somatic inter-\nsex variations have been studied \"as a holistic group\" to bet-\nter understand how the health of \"the group as a whole\" has\nbeen constructed in recent research. A formal systematic\nreview was completed through the ProQuest Central data-\nbase (selected for its broad coverage of health-related litera-\nture from a multi-disciplinary range of approaches and\nlenses). An Advanced Search was completed for the key\nterms \"intersex\" or \"disorder of sex development (DSD).\"\nThis was applied across the Source Type categories\n\"Scholarly Journals.\" The search was initially limited to\nin English for (the researcher's) ease of review. As a search\nfrom the last decade yielded 2,101 results, only the texts\npoint and ensure the review was contained. Each title and\nabstract were read to ensure relevance, and then the full arti-\ncle was read for further clarity. Only 61 of these texts were\ndeemed relevant, based on their focus on humans with\nsomatic intersex variations/disorders of sex development/\ndifferences in sex development (DSDs) and health care (in\nits broadest sense ranging from clinical conceptualizations to\nholistic well-being). Those focused on intersex expression in\nanimals, human sex development more broadly without any\nconsideration of variations, unrelated disorders or themes\n(such as works solely on autism), or nonhealth related topics\nwere manually eliminated from the search results.\nThe texts were then read again in full and analyzed with\nreference to a previous discourse analysis of key theoretical\nindicators in the field (detailed in Jones et al., 2016). Specific\ninformation was gleaned on their context from the publica-\ntion and author location information recorded in the database\nand on the documents themselves. The sources' theoretical\nlenses were deduced from a combination of both their stated\ntheory applications (if available) and/or other indicators\nincluding language and concept usage, data type, and meth-\nodological and analytical stances (whether positivist, con-\nstructivist, relativist, deconstructive, subversive, or\notherwise, for example) in relation to their data collected.\nThe sources were allocated a roman numeral for ease of ref-\nerence. The sources' specific methods, participant numbers,\nand ages were directly gleaned from the sources' own\ndescriptive text in the abstract and the full text source, or\nnoted as absent. The sources' construction of people with\nintersex variations (including nomenclature and variations\nrecognized) were directly gleaned from the sources' abstract\nand full text. Finally, the health-related findings were gleaned\nfrom direct statements (or their absence) on health-related\nissues (especially interventions, including diagnosis, analy-\nsis, treatment, and evaluation of any kind) experienced by\nany people with intersex variations featured in the sources\n(variably including the authors themselves, study partici-\npants of any kind, or any generally conceptualized version of\nthe group as constructed in a given source). These data were\nsystematically tabulated and are reported in this article in a\ncombination of qualitative and quantitative summaries, with\nsome basic figures to enhance accessibility.\nResults\nSource Contexts\nOverall, the 61 textual sources in this literature review came\nfrom studies based in several global regions--see the appen-\ndix (Achermann, Domenice, Bachega, Nishi, & Mendonca,\nKarkazis, 2015; Bonanni, Pasetti, Ghiggeri, & Gandolfo,\nGarcia, 2015; Grimbly, Caluseriu, Metcalfe, Jetha, &\nMohammed El Hassan, Chra\u00efbi, & Gaouzi, 2015; Lin-Su,\nHerald et al., 2015; Mannaerts, Muys, Blaumeiser, &\nMutlu et al., 2015; Oliveira, de Paiva-e-Silva, Guerra-Junior,\nsources from the American Canadian region (Amarillo et al.,\net al., 2015), three from Africa (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula,\nFigure 1. The sources specifically featured studies from a\ntotal of 21 countries. Over half (31) of the studies were based\nFour studies were based in India (Kalra et al., 2016; Khadilkar\nstudies were based in Belgium (Mannaerts et al., 2015),\nItaly (Bonanni et al., 2015), Malaysia (Mohamed & Noor,\nMorocco (Latrech et al., 2015), New Zealand (Anonymous,\n& Fadl-Elmula, 2016). One study largely based in Germany\nincluded collaborative multi-national input (Kim et al.,\nThe overwhelming majority of the sources came from\npeer-reviewed journals (Achermann et al., 2015; Ahmed &\nOne was from a peer-reviewed book series (Dreger, 2015).\nMost of the journals represented were either medical journals\nor at least broadly covering a thematic remit inclusive of\nmedical science issues. The largest number of articles (18)\nfrom a repeatedly represented journal came from Narrative\nInquiry in Bioethics due to its release of a special issue\n(Volume 5, Issue 2) focused solely on intersex themes not\notherwise typical for that journal (Amanda, 2015; Baratz &\nNo. of Sources\nGlobal Region\nFigure 1. Number of sources by global region.\n4 SAGE Open\nZieselman, 2015). Multiple articles also came from Journal\nof Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism (Brasileiro\narticles from International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology\net al., 2015). Two articles came from Archives of Sexual\nEndocrine Practice (Khadilkar et al., 2015; Saraswat et al.,\n2015), Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism\ntorically appeared to have evidenced regular past attention to\nintersex themes over time outside of the pieces represented\nin this literature review. Of the remaining sources, most (15)\ncame from individual journals/publishing series in areas of\nthe medical or broader health sciences that have had some\nassociation with intersex themes in the past--in genetics\nendocrinology (Achermann et al., 2015; Khadilkar et al.,\nAnonymous, 2016), pediatric or other surgery (Ekenze et al.,\n(Ceci et al., 2015). Only nine sources came from nonmedical\nThese latter journals did not otherwise evidence regular past\ncoverage of intersex themes.\nTheoretical Lenses\nDirect explanations of the theoretical lenses applied in the\nstudies behind the sources were rare. However, the concep-\ntual framings used in the studies were nevertheless apparent\nin the way the sources framed people with intersex variations\n(whether in pathologizing through to deconstructive views),\npositioned the researcher (whether as the subject, object, or\ncontext of inquiry) reported on data (whether using positivist\nthrough to poststructuralist approaches), and so on. The theo-\nretical lenses applied in the studies were alternately expert-\ncentered,patient-centered,group-centered,ortheory-centered\n(see Table 1).\nInstitutional expert-centered. Over a third (23) of the sources\nfeatured studies with a Traditional Clinical/Medical lens or\nconceptual framing (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Amarillo\nleged a view of people with intersex variations as patients\nwith DSD and consideration of pathology in (usually some\ncombination of any of) their anatomy (Dong et al., 2016),\nbiology (Rios et al., 2015), endocrinology (Mutlu et al.,\net al., 2015). The group was thus cast in these sources as in\nneed of expert-centered clinically/institutionally based anal-\nysis, diagnosis, and often corrective treatment, for example,\nhormone therapy (Grover et al., 2015) or genital surgeries\n(Brasileiro et al., 2016). The researchers creating the sources\nwere generally medical doctors, surgeons, or scientists, and\napplied their interrogative work to their patients or the\npatients' perceived disorders (rather than to their own medi-\ncal practices, biases, or philosophies, for example). Their\nreports were pitched at, for example, improving DSD diag-\nnosis methods (Grimbly et al., 2016), refining analysis tech-\nniques and/or intervention techniques or practices (Khadilkar\net al., 2015), and/or drawing attention to rare cases\n(Palanisamy et al., 2015). Data and standards for data were\ntreated in a positivist manner (as being self-evident and not\nTable 1.

A more unique theoretical lens\nwhich otherwise supported traditional views of patients as\nhaving DSDs in a largely pathologizing manner and which\nrelied on expert-centered (religious and clinical) analysis\nwas seen in one additional source which used a Maqasid al-\nShari'ah lens: requiring the mechanistic interpretation of\nQur'an and Hadith toward Islamic views on health care for\npatients with DSD (Mohamed & Noor, 2015).\nPatient-centered. A small portion of the sources (five sources)\nfeatured Liberal Constructivist views on clinical practice\nprivileging patient-centered care and some element of patient\n& Tian, 2015). The researchers creating the sources were a\ncombination of people with medical and other academic\nbackgrounds, who applied their interrogative work to\npatients' or represented parties' perceptions of their own\nneeds, experiences, and identities, sometimes including in\nliterature (Kalra et al., 2016) or diagnostic manuals. Their\nreports were pitched at improving patient quality of life and\nholistic experience (Lin-Su et al., 2015), and/or some ele-\nments of clinical practices to enable a greater range of options\nto patients (Achermann et al., 2015). Data and standards for\ndata were treated in a progressive manner (as being subjec-\ntive and individually specific). More unique theoretical\nlenses which otherwise supported liberal views on patients\nas having DSDs (sometimes called \"differences\" in sex\ndevelopment in a destigmatizing manner) were seen in two\nused a Phenomenology lens: requiring the interpretation of\nan individual patient's experiences--in this case, of gen-\ndered psychotic delusions in relation to their social experi-\nence of intersex diagnosis (G\u00fcl et al., 2015). Another used a\nLiberal Literary Forensic Analysis lens: requiring consider-\nation of ancient textual characters' reported experiences as\npotentially aligned with modern experiences of DSDs (Kalra\nCommunity group-centered.There was strong representation\n(in 18 sources) of the Bioethical Narrative Inquiry lens spe-\ncifically from Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics Volume 5, Issue\ntor Georgiann Davis had actively described the issue as\nintentionally pitched at disrupting the dominance of Medi-\ncal/Clinical lenses for work on people with intersex varia-\ntions (Davis, 2015b). The lens privileged a critical view of\npeople with intersex variations as members of a marginalized\ncommunity group overall who had collectively been at risk\nof poor access to medical information about their conditions\nor structures privileging bodily autonomy in medical set-\ntings. The use in this frame of autobiography or personal\nrecall of conversations with individuals from the group also\ncast intersex people as individuals with underrepresented\nexperiences of specific variations, stories, personalities,\ndesires, and health care phenomena (such as interactions and\ndynamics with family members and medical staff) impacting\ntheir different health care needs. Standards for data were de-\ninstitutionalized; the sources valued visibility or other rights-\nbased goals for the collective social group rather than\ntraditional notions of rigor or precision. Other group-cen-\ntered lenses represented included Critical Intersex Studies\nlenses (in three sources) focused on human rights and bodily\nautonomy for intersex people as a specific group, via philo-\nsophical or textual analysis (Anderson, 2015; Anonymous,\nthree sources) focused on nondiscrimination rights for\nLGBTI people more broadly (Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard,\nclear conceptualization of intersex people as separate from\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and\ntherefore examples did not feature clear active intersex\nparticipation.\nTheory-centered.The remaining sources (six sources) fea-\ntured variously conceived deconstructive lenses which gen-\nerally required conceptual critique of other theoretical\napproaches to people with intersex variations seen in health-\nrelated research, polity, or literature (Dreger, 2015; Grimes,\nThese lenses included application of Queer historiography of\nhealth science (Dreger, 2015): a Critical-Queer feminist the-\nology (Grimes, 2016), a Transnational feminist frame (Rubin,\n2015), a Postmodern and critical sociology of health (Jones,\nand Queer theory (Miller, 2015). In these lenses, theory or\nphilosophy itself (including nomenclature and theoretical\nconstructions of people with intersex variations and their\nhealth care needs) are interrogated whether in law or polity\n(Lalor, 2015), in literature or theological texts, and/or in\nfields of language and conceptualization impacting health\nand were cast as limited by their sociohistoric and location-\nbased contexts, field-based biases and constraints, and expo-\nsures to diverse visions of health care (Dreger, 2015; Rubin,\nMethods and Participant Numbers\nOverall, the sources represented studies using a range of\nmethods, including clinical, textual, and socially oriented\napproaches. The sources included a broad array of partici-\npant numbers, ranging from sources with unclear numbers of\n6 SAGE Open\nFigure 2. Number of textual sources reporting on particular study method types (n = 61).\npeople with intersex variations (Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard,\nwith 272 participants specifically from the group (Jones,\n2016). Higher numbers were rare, however, as over a third of\nthe sources focused on only one participant (Amanda, 2015;\n2015). Almost as many had no direct participants with inter-\nsex variations and, instead, used the general existence of the\ngroup, other participants, or secondary sources to make key\narguments about intersex variations (Achermann et al., 2015;\nincluded a wide span of ages ranging from 1 day (Lucas-\nthird of the sources did not specify the precise ages of partici-\npants or the group being referred to (Achermann et al., 2015;\n2015). Around a third focused on (or could be assumed to\nhave focused on, given the span of time covered in the piece)\nZieselman, 2015). Ten sources focused purely on infants\net al., 2015). Five explicitly focused on a precise participant\ngroup, age-range crossing over younger and adult age groups\nFigure 2 shows the seven types of methods described in\nthe sources. The most common methods in 18 sources consti-\ntuted autobiographical critical analyses/narratives of author's\nintervention impacts, observations, and/or views (Amanda,\non one adult individual (usually a community member rather\nthan an MD or academic) considering his or her own experi-\nences across his or her lifetime, especially the negative well-\nbeing impacts of receiving a lack of information and/or\nnegative well-being and health impacts of early intervention\nwithout express consent (including feelings of disconnection\nfrom health care processes, trauma and depression, infertil-\nity, decreased sexual function/pleasure, undesired sex-based\npresentations, and/or surgical complications). Two of these\npieces focused on secondary data (observations) about the\nlack of dissemination of information or consultation with\npeople with intersex variations about their health needs and\nexperiences, seen as an abuse of the group leading to\nunwanted outcomes (Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Frader,\n2015). In one example, a pediatrician expressed concern\nabout his and others' own endorsements of past gonad\nremovals (e.g., removing testes from females) on the basis of\npotentially imagined cancer and \"corrective\" clinical con-\ncerns, given retained gonads can provide patients with a\n\"natural\" form of hormone production (Frader, 2015).\nThe second most common methods were random case\nreports (15 sources) on analyses of patients toward diagnosis\nand/or interventions (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Bonanni\nwere pieces written by MDs/academics on variably one to\n108 participants with intersex variations whom they had ana-\nlyzed and treated clinically--mainly just one infant or young\nperson who had been subjected to tests (anatomical, cytoge-\nnetic, hormonal, and/or radiological evaluations) and often\nhormonal and/or surgical interventions (e.g., genital surger-\nies such as gonad removals or cosmetic constructive work,\nfor example, or mastectomies and so on). Evaluations of the\ncases strongly privileged the MDs/academics assessment of\nanalytical or intervention \"success,\" and the pieces gave a\nstrong overall message that in the authors' own views, the\ninterventions they had applied were successful overall. In\nfairness, the purpose of such papers is usually to present a\nnovel approach to medical management, and as such would\nbe expected to treat the \"case\" as a medical condition need-\ning treatment. However, this meant the sources largely did\nnot report on the participants'own assessment of the need for\nor success of the treatments, which could be relevant mea-\nsures. Several contained direct photographs of patients'\ninternal and external genitalia (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016;\n2015); in some of the photos, children's external genitalia\nwere arranged for display by another party's bare (not\ngloved) hands (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Brasileiro\nclarity about what permissions were obtained or what ethical\nconsideration was given to the photography process or the\nindividual's international online exposure, constructing the\nbodies of this group as quite freely intimately accessible\nwithout obvious ethical or hygiene considerations to medical\nexperts, and to any interested viewers globally.\nThe third most common methods were largely text-based\nanalyses (13 sources) including literature reviews and socio-\nhistorical analyses of secondary records of people with\nintersex variations/diagnoses/intersex groups/relevant events\nThese analyses were conducted mainly by academics with a\nrange of training (health sciences, law, sociology, education,\netc.) on no (Grimes, 2016), through to unclear (Dwyer et al.,\n2015), numbers of participants with intersex variations. The\nstudies mainly used the general existence of, or cited textual\nor historical incidences of, people with intersex variations--\nor else their fictional existence or classification/construction\nThese studies mostly problematized the way people with\nintersex variations have been presented in classifications,\nhistorical incidences, or socially. The fourth most common\nmethods could be considered systematic experimental group\ntesting/modeling (eight sources) of a novel medical approach\nor hypothesis like, for example, Magnetic Resonance\nImaging, Copy Number Variation and cell transgenic experi-\nments, gene network modeling, and so on (Amarillo et al.,\nparticipants with intersex variations. The study with no par-\nticipants with intersex variations modeled measures for the\nintersex females'internal genitalia based on another group--\nonly what it termed \"healthy females\" aged 0 to 40 years\n(Kelsey et al., 2016). The pieces gave a strong overall mes-\nsage that in the authors' own views, the medical approaches\nor hypotheses they had applied had been largely successful\noverall.\nA less common method (three sources) included the use\nof a large-scale survey/questionnaire (Jones, 2016; Lin-Su\nparticipants with intersex variations: variably 87 (Wang &\nteenagers through to significantly older adults' perspectives\non their own experiences of quality of life, nomenclature,\nand/or a combination of medical and social experiences and\nservices. These studies problematized a range of health care\u00ad\nrelated issues including casting use of DSD as a disordering\nterm and conceptualization (Jones, 2016; Lin-Su et al.,\n2015), noting problems with interventions and/or sexual\nexperiences postinterventions (Jones, 2016; Wang & Tian,\n2015), and decrying the lack of direct consultation around\nthe groups' needs generally in relation to a range of general\nhealth care (Wang & Tian, 2015), mental health (Lin-Su\net al., 2015), and school-based health education services\n(Jones, 2016). Another less common method (three sources)\nOliveira et al., 2015). These studies had variably zero\n8 SAGE Open\nSEXUAL\nDIFFERENTIATION\nFigure 3. Number of textual sources using particular group nomenclature for people with intersex variations (n = 61).\nwith intersex variations. One article discussed interviews of\nparents on how health workers disclosed their child's \"DSD\"\ndiagnoses (Oliveira et al., 2015), one discussed an interview\nwith an expert on interventions (Anonymous, 2016), and one\na set of clinical psychological interviews (Ediati et al., 2015).\nAges of specific interviewees were not consistently clearly\nspecified in these studies, although participants could mostly\nbe inferred to be adults. These articles problematized the lack\nof health care information dissemination and psychological\nfollow-up for people with intersex variations from their dif-\nferent stakeholders' perspectives (parents, experts, and\npatients). While the Indonesian interviewers argued for inter-\nvention based on its infrequency in their context and their\nperception was that their context was therefore lacking\n(Ediati et al., 2015), the interviewed expert--a nursing clini-\ncian from New Zealand--argued that intervention on inter-\nsex infants was traumatizing and unnecessary (Anonymous,\n2016). One unique study constituted a photographic essay\ndocumentation and analysis of public change and continuity\nin Rankin County's LGBTI citizens (Howard, 2015). It was\nunclear which or how many participants were specifically\nintersex in the original photographic data, or whether the\nterm LGBTI was simply applied as an umbrella term in an\ninclusive spirit or in evaluation of perceived likely participa-\ntion. The essay argued that LGBTI people were generally\nmarginalized in a range of local health and care services.\nFraming of Participants and Health-Related\nMessages About Interventions\nThe sources provided a mixture of messages about health care\nintervention for people with intersex variations: 27 sources\ncast medical interventions as potentially problematic for the\ngroup's health or well-being (Amanda, 2015; Anderson,\nventions as unproblematic (Achermann et al., 2015; Ahmed\nThese messages roughly aligned with the use of nomenclature\nand sometimes certain theoretical lenses. Noticeably, the\nstrongest divide was between the use of community-related\nterms and medically related terms (Figure 3). Over a third of\nsources (26 of 61, including all 18 sources using the Bioethical\nNarrative Inquiry theoretical lens) applied the term \"intersex\"\nto the group, largely framing the group as a marginalized\ngroup with specific service needs, sex traits not considered\nstandard socially/theologically, and a need for protection\nfrom unwanted discrimination (Amanda, 2015; Anonymous,\nZieselman, 2015). Some studies using this nomenclature\nincluded people with specific variations, including, for exam-\nple, 47XXY, AIS, CAH, Kallman's, Klinefelter's, PCOS-\nwhile other studies were more generalized in discussing indi-\nviduals born with sexual anatomies that various societies\ndeem to be nonstandard (Rubin, 2015), or \"endocrinology-\nrelated features\" that can be read as intersex (Kalra et al.,\n2016). A few studies applying Queer conceptualizations of\nthe word intersex described the group as disrupting the sex\nbinary (male/female) or dominant sex and gender discourse\n(Grimes, 2016). Most sources using the \"intersex\" nomencla-\nture cast the group as unfairly subjected to cosmetic surgery\nin problematic ways as infants and young people with nega-\ntive outcomes for their health and well-being (Anonymous,\n2016), and having largely unheard perspectives on their\nchoices and negative experiences that needed to be privileged\n(Davis, 2015b). These studies called for greater consultation\nin health care, health care policy production, and the develop-\nment of mental health services.\n23 sources featuring the Traditional Clinical/Medical theo-\nretical lens) applied the phrase \"patients with disorders of\nsex development/DSD\" to the group, largely framing the\ngroup as containing smaller groups of patients with specific\nsets of disorders to be analyzed, with a range of medical\nneeds sometimes confronting to family or medical staff\nconcepts considered offensive or inaccurate to community\nmembers were applied as types of subclassifications where\nthis DSD language was used, such as pieces casting the\ngroup as presenting in \"pseudohermaphroditism\"/\"true her-\nmaphroditism\" (G\u00fcl et al., 2015) and having \"abnormal\"\nchromosomal, hormonal, or anatomical traits (Ahmed &\nFadl-Elmula, 2016). Several of the studies actually con-\ntrasted the group against what they termed \"normal\" people\nin terms of anatomy or other traits (Camats et al., 2015).\nThere was a strong focus in sources using DSD nomencla-\nture on the cause of the group's \"abnormal\" traits (Camats\nmanaging parents' experiences of shock and stigma and aid-\ning their intervention choices for their child rather than\nand an assumption of the value and success of early interven-\ntion (Paula et al., 2015). A smaller group (four of 61) exclu-\nsively used the specific diagnosis or condition in focus only,\nframing the group in terms of particular condition-based\nincluded patients with persistent mullerian duct syndrome\n(PMDS; Palanisamy et al., 2015), patients with CAH (Lin-Su\net al., 2015), patients with Turner syndrome (TS; Bonanni\net al., 2015), and children with suspected disorders of ste-\nroid/hormone synthesis (Lucas-Herald et al., 2015). The\nsources using group-specific nomenclature were mostly\naffirming and unquestioning about the need for early analy-\nsis and intervention, although one considered the need for\ngreater consultation with the patient group (Lin-Su et al.,\nThere was a small portion of sources (four of 61, including\nall sources using the Critical LGBTI Liberationist theoretical\nlens) that mainly applied the phrase \"lesbian, gay, bisexual,\ntransgender and intersex/LGBTI\" or similar acronyms\nyouth (*IAGCQ included intersex, agender/asexual, gender\ncreative, and questioning) was used (Miller, 2015). These\nsources framed the group within a broader politically and\nsocially marginalized community, usually with rights protec-\ntions in law, policy, or ethical frames which need to be\nasserted. Even within this group, the intersex people were\ncast as the subgroup for which mental health information,\nspecifically for older people, was most minimal (Tinney\net al., 2015). These studies took mixed or neutral approaches\nto corrective intervention, however, not collectively provid-\ning critique or endorsement. Finally, the smallest portion\n(three of 61 sources, including two using the Traditional\nClinical/Medical theoretical lens) applied the phrase\n\"Disorders of sexual differentiation/DSD,\" a term used in a\nsimilar manner to the other DSD acronym with emphasis on\nsex trait and genital ambiguity (Anderson, 2015; Ceci et al.,\nless pathologizing--although given it was used in one of the\narticles used in conjunction with the terms \"disorder\" and\n\"hermaphroditism,\" the possibility of any depathologizing\nrationale was in question (Ceci et al., 2015). No clear rela-\ntionship between this nomenclature and approaches to health\ncare or intervention could be determined.\nDiscussion\nThe data suggested a developing divergence in the literature\nfrom the long-established location of health-related studies\non people with intersex variations within the institutional\nexpert-based orientation, particularly Traditional Medical/\nClinical framings and their remaining overall dominant con-\ncentration in medical journals. This was particularly affected\nby not only American and Australian work, for example, but\nalso other contexts. Clearly, more patient-centered, commu-\nnity-centered, and theory-centered work is emerging in this\nfield--particularly a range of Critical Bioethics and Intersex\nStudies perspectives which have emerged and are actively\nchallenging the way this group is framed. This has included\na trend toward new nomenclature and considerations. In this\nliterature review, the large number of expert-centered sources\npromoting interventionalist pathologizing views on \"patients\nwith DSDs\" were equaled by the large number of community\ngroup\u00adcentered and other sources promoting a critique of\nthese dominant health care attitudes on the basis of marginal-\nized \"intersex\" peoples' perspectives, bodily autonomy, and\nrights. This reflected broader debates in the field discussed in\nother papers chronicling recent resistance to the assumption\npeople with intersex variations need cosmetic correction\nfrom international human rights organizations, Queer theo-\nretical work, and community-based sources (Davis, 2015a;\nNations, 2012). This literature evidenced a shift toward a\nview of medical intervention as problematic.\nHowever, older conceptualizations of clinicians as having\nunmitigated rights over patients remain in a significant portion\nof the literature--this was particularly evident in the lack of\nconsideration some researchers gave to patients' perspectives\non their health care in the sources, and moreover the problem-\natic use of photographs of participants'external genitalia illus-\ntrated in several case studies. Researchers are in an extremely\npowerful position over these studies'participants (especially if\ntheir participants are also their patients and at their mercy for\nmedical care, moreover if they are children). People with\nintersex variations have complained about feelings of being\nabused in medical and research scenarios where their varia-\ntions were shared without their permission, let alone access to\ntheir bodies (especially their genitalia) whether put on display\nor touched and photographed (Jones et al., 2016).Anonymized\ndiagrams would have sufficed in outlining specific anatomical\nindicators of intersex variations without compromising an\nindividual patient's respectful treatment (recalling the lack of\nglove use) or right to control over their genitalia and its depic-\ntion (recalling that permissions were either unobtainable for\ninfants or not reported from adults).Alimitation of this review\nis that it is unclear from examining the literature itself with\nwhom the responsibility would legally lie to ensure permis-\nsions for procedures or photographs were obtained, or if any\nsuch responsibility is allocated in various global contexts. In\nfuture, clinicians will need to start listening to the growing\npush from people with intersex variations for greater consul-\ntancy around interventions impacting sex traits (especially\nhormones and genitalia) by ideally holding off on such inter-\nvention and only pursuing it in consultation with and consider-\nation of the recipient (at an age where this is possible).Another\nlimit of this review is that constructions of ages by which\ninformed consent might be possible were not examined; this is\nan area for researchers and policy makers to start considering.\nTo a smaller extent, another concern in the literature was that\npublications claiming to be on \"LGBTI\" people appeared not\nto have been reviewed for whether they actually contain peo-\nple with intersex variations; this issue could be better addressed\nin advice given to researchers from both ethics committees in\nresearch institutions and research publishers and peer-review-\ners, as relevant. Intersex activists have mixed views on inclu-\nsion in LGBTI studies--some argue heteronormativity marks\nintersex bodies as \"queer bodies\" making LGBTI and anti-\nhomophobia perspectives applicable (Holmes, 1994). Others\nargue that LGBTI work exposes intersex people to added\nhomophobia and \"pinkwashing\"--having their goals depriori-\ntized against gay groups' goals (Koyama & Weasel, 2001;\nConclusion\nClinicians' analyses of clinical processes around people\nwith intersex variations may indeed provide some valuable\ninformation and cast intervention work in affirming ways.\nHowever, external analyses from lenses that really privilege\npeople with intersex variations themselves as agentic sub-\njects in a more empowering dynamic, than simply a patient-\nobject, show a strong disconnection between how clinicians\nand people with intersex variations consider health care pro-\nvision. Notably, there has been an increasing level of con-\nsultancy with patient advocate groups in some contexts in\nrecent years, and major shifts away from performing unnec-\nessary procedures on infants (in the reported experiences of\nboth the author, who has worked with Government Advisory\nGroups on intersex policy issues in Victoria Australia, and\nof members of this article's peer review team). It is impor-\ntant for more clinicians to respond to the largely commu-\nnity-based and rights-based pushes for a patient-centered\nmodel of intersex health care. Patient-centered care litera-\nture broadly privileges principles of prioritizing an individ-\nual patient's goals and well-being, building a relationship\nwhich empowers a patient, making accessible clinician\ncommunication with the patient routine, and using patient\nexperience narratives and feedback toward service improve-\nment (Koyama & Weasel, 2001). A patient-centered\napproach to patients with intersex variations would there-\nfore foreground greater valuing of the holistic well-being of\nthe individual in the long term, their diverse needs and iden-\ntity potentials, their possible fertility and hormone balance,\ntheir sexual function (not just in a simplistic valuing of pen-\netrative sex but in a valuing of the full range of human sex-\nual pleasures and possibilities), and their many other\nautonomous considerations only discoverable through plac-\ning proper consultation and support processes in place in all\nclinical settings. It would acknowledge that many patients\nlater in life have bodily autonomy goals which differ from\nguardians' goals to have their childrens' bodies become\n\"normalised\" (Jones et al., 2016). Contemporary clinicians\nshould seek and prioritize their patient's own language and\ngoals around their intersex variations and bodily difference\n(rather than imposing DSD terminology), should acknowl-\nedge that young patient's goals may ultimately differ from\ntheir family's goals long term through putting off any unnec-\nessary interventions until the patient is old enough to seek\nthem out and give informed consent, and should source\npatient support information from large-scale internationally\nrecognized intersex organizations (including those for all\nintersex people such as OII, and local chapters for patients'\nspecific variations such as TS and AIS societies).\nSimilarly, research institutions, researchers, and publish-\ners could take a more active share in the responsibility of\navoiding the exploitation of people with intersex variations\nthrough the health-related studies they publish. This could\ninclude standardizing indicator questions for people with\ncongenital intersex variations (so that studies claiming inter-\nsex participants must actually include them), and standard-\nizing requirements of evidence of informed consent for any\nexternal genitalia photography published or even key prob-\nlematic intervention practices described within studies pub-\nlished (such as cosmetic genital surgeries). Indeed, the divide\nbetween the clinical and the nonclinical literature exposes\npossibilities for improving not only treatment outcomes but\nalso opportunities for changing the relationship between bio-\nmedical expertise and patient- and theory-centered knowl-\nedge production. In particular, involving diverse groups of\npeople with intersex variations in research development and\nknowledge development around biomedical and theoretical\nknowledge, and in the creation of success measures for treat-\nment evaluations, would be key steps forward. Methods\nmight include (but are not limited to) involving intersex peo-\nple in study reference groups, focus groups, professional\ndevelopment training sessions, or paid consultants and team\nmembers. Where LGBTI work seeks to include intersex peo-\nple, this should be achieved directly via consultation with\nintersex groups and active recruitment strategies, to over-\ncome tendencies toward pinkwashing or assuming intersex\npeople are included where they are not (Holmes, 1994;\nUnited Nations, 2012). LGBTI work should only include\nintersex people where their goals align with the work or are\nactively prioritized in the work, and where an understanding\nof the particular impacts of homophobia on intersex people\ncan be understood and worked against. A pro-active stance\ntoward aligning the range of perspectives on health care for\npeople with intersex variations needs to be taken by a range\nof stakeholders (from policy makers to health care providers\nand publishers) if the tensions are to be resolved in this\nfield--and ultimately used to improve it.\nAppendix\nAll sources, categorized by type and perspective on corrective intervention.\nSource Country Theory/lens Methods\nNo. of participants\nwith intersex\nvariations\nFraming of participants with intersex\nvariations\nHealth messages\ncast intervention\nfor people with\nintersex variations\nas (unproblematic,\nproblematic, or\nunclarified/mixed)?\nAmarillo et al.
