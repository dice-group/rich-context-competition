A study\nthat was performed in Rhode Island\nHospital showed that the cost of patients\nwith hospital-acquired infections was more\nthan three times higher than that of those\nwithout infectious diseases.3 Nosocomial\ninfections are usually transmitted by poor\nhygiene practice, followed by the provision\nof outpatient treatment and invasive med-\nical procedures. Patients' impaired defence\nagainst bacteria (e.g., because of pre-term\nbirth or immunodeficiency) increases the\nchance of infection.4 Additionally, because\nmedical staff are associated with patients in\ndifferent units, they may carry and spread\npathogens.5\nOne of the major gram-negative bacteria\nresponsible for nosocomial infections is\nAcinetobacter. Acinetobacter may cause\nsevere pneumonia and infections of the urin-\nary tract, bloodstream, and other parts of the\nbody. Acinetobacter is primarily found in\nhospitalized patients with a reduced immune\ndefence who are affected by drug-resistant\ngram-negative germs. These bacteria can\nsurvive on surfaces in the hospital for a long\ntime and attack the body through wounds\nand invasive devices. According to recent\ndata from the U.S. National Healthcare\nSafety Network, more than 30% of hospi-\ntal-acquired infections are due to gram-\nnegative bacteria, and the majority of venti-\nlator-associated pneumonia (47%) and urin-\nary tract infection (45%) cases are associated\nwith these bacteria.6 Acinetobacter baumannii\nalso causes community-acquired infections,\nalbeit at a lower percentage than hospital-\nacquired infections.\nManagement of A. baumannii infections\nmay be difficult because of intrinsic resist-\nance to some antibiotics, as well as new\nmechanisms of resistance throughout treat-\nment.7 These infections form a large pro-\nportion of hospital infections. A report from\nTurkish hospitals showed that 16.6% of\nnosocomial infections were due to A. bau-\nmannii, with the majority (68.9%) of them in\nICU (Intensive care unit) patients; more\nthan half (52.5%) of these patients suffered\nfrom respiratory tract infections.8 A. bau-\nmannii is the most common species of\ngenus,9 which is widely present in the hos-\npital environment. A. baumannii can cause\nsevere or fatal illnesses, especially in critic-\nally ill patients with low immune responses,5\nand can increase patient mortality along\nwith hospital costs. Therefore, multi-drug\nresistance is a major public health emer-\ngency. Additionally, A. baumannii is a spe-\ncies of pathogenic bacteria and is an\naerobic gram-negative bacterium known\nfor resistance to most antibiotics. A. bauman-\nnii can survive in dry environments for weeks,\nwhich enables transmission through contam-\ninants in hospitals.10 Patients, who are the\nmain reservoirs of A. baumannii, can con-\ntaminate attending staff, leading to further\ncross-transmission11 Therefore, hospitals are\nthought to be the main source of A. bauman-\nnii infections. A study carried out in Spain\nshowed that more than 90% of A. baumannii\ninfections were of nosocomial origin, and\nonly 4% originated from the community.12\nWhile antimicrobial agents are considered\nas a solution for infectious disease, resistance\nof microorganisms to various drugs has\nraised new problems, especially for hospital-\nacquired infections. There has been an\nincreasing amount of research conducted on\nfactors related to the transmission of such\ninfections. However, multi-drug resistance\nmakes the illnesses more serious because of\nlimited treatment options.\nSeveral studies have identified general\ncharacteristics of patients that place them\nat increased risk for acquisition of multi-\ndrug-resistant outbreak strains.4 However,\nthe diversity of risk factors suggests that\nseparate investigations should be performed\nin each hospital setting.7 Therefore, asso-\nciated factors contributing to infection\nshould be assessed to apply basic prevention\nand control measures.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nWe performed a hospital-based, retrospect-\nive case\u00adcontrol study to determine the\ndemographic characteristics and factors\nthat may be associated with mortality and\nmorbidity related to multi-drug-resistant A.\nbaumannii (MDR-AB) nosocomial infec-\ntion. We included patients in Al Noor\nSpecialist Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia.\nThe study was conducted at an approxi-\nmately 500-bed tertiary care hospital\nproviding all major specialties (e.g., adult\ncardiology, internal medicine, nephrology,\nurology, neurology, plastic surgery, dental\nhealth, emergency medicine, and adult\nintensive care; 29 beds). Patients requiring\npaediatrics and maternity care are trans-\nferred to the regional maternity and chil-\ndren's hospital in Makkah. Al-Noor\nSpecialist Hospital is a referral hospital for\nHajj and Umrah pilgrims with multiple\nnationalities.\nThis hospital deals with a variety of\npatients with multiple risk factors.\nTherefore, there are strict infection control\nmeasures in hospital in general and intensive\ncare unit to control the spread of infections.\nMeasures are implemented and supervised\nby the infection control department.\nStandard precautions are taken (e.g., hand\nhygiene and use of protective devices) health\ncare professionals to prevent spreading\ninfection.\nThe study population consisted of all\npatients aged 18 years and older in the\nintensive care unit, and surgery, medicine,\nneurology, and urology wards in this hospital\nThe cases were patients with one or more\nclinically positive cultures for MDR-AB,\nwhere clinical evidence of infection was\npresent 48 hours after admission.13 Multi-\ndrug resistance was defined as resistance to\nmore than three classes of antibiotics (ami-\nnoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones, and\ntetracyclines).13 Therefore, patients who had\nisolated MDR-AB from their clinical speci-\nmen within 48 hours of admission were not\nincluded in the case group. Each A. bau-\nmannii infection case was matched by age\n(within 5 years) and ward of admission with\ntwo control patients without A. baumannii.\nMatching of the controls to cases was per-\nformed by enrolling the same percentage of\npatients without isolated A. baumannii in\ntheir clinical specimen who were within the\nsame age category and who stayed in the\nsame ward as the cases.\nData collection. Specially designed data col-\nlection forms were used to collect demo-\ngraphic and clinical data. Two slightly\ndifferent forms, specific to the case and\ncontrol groups, were used. Data on demo-\ngraphic characteristics, host and therapeutic\nfactors, laboratory and bacteriology results,\nantibiotic therapy, and outcomes were col-\nlected using medical and laboratory records.\nData on a previous history were collected\nfrom previous medical records.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis. In this study, a single\nvariable was analysed at a time. No com-\nparisons were made between variables. For\nnominal or ordinal (categorical) variables,\nthe frequency and proportion were used,\nwhile for continuous or discrete (numerical)\nvariables, the mean and standard deviation\nare shown. After processing the analysis\nusing SPSS, independent variables are\ndescribed using tables, pie charts, and bar\ncharts. Distribution of the study sample by\ndemographic and clinical variables was\nanalysed using this method.\nMultivariate analysis. Factors with a p\nvalue < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant and analysed using multivariate\nregression. A multivariate logistic regression\nmodel was created with MDR-AB (and\nclinical outcomes of these cases) as the\ndependent variable. All variables with\np < 0.05 in univariate analysis were included\nin the multivariate model as independent\nvariables to identify independent predictors\nof multi-resistance. A p value was con-\nsidered to be two-tailed and p < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nThis study was first approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Al-Noor\nSpecialist Hospital, Ministry of Health\n(approval #: HJ/3065). The study was con-\nducted retrospectively and the patients'\ninformation was retrieved from medical\nrecords. Therefore, written consent was not\nnecessary.\nResults\nIn the study population, 57% were males\nand 43% were females. The mean age was\nyears for controls (Table 1). The majority\n(80.3%) of patients in the case group\nremained in hospital for longer than 1\nweek (Figure 1). The most frequent site of\ninfection was the respiratory tract (77.3%,\nFigure 2). A total of 92% of A. baumannii\ncases were susceptible to ceftazidime and\nciprofloxacin, 83% to trimethoprim, and\n79% to amikacin. The highest resistance\n(Figure 3) was observed for imipenem\nthe isolates were susceptible to colistin and\ntigecycline.\nThe results of multiple logistic regression\nof risk factors associated with MDR-AB are\nshown in Table 2. Immunosuppression was\na significant risk factor. Patients with\nimmunosuppression were three times more\nlikely to become infected than those with a\ngood immune status [Odd ratio (OR) \u00bc 2.9;\ninvasive procedures had a significant and\nTable 1.

This phenomenon is not specific\nto this hospital alone because an increased\nrate of MDR-AB has been reported5,6,9 in\nhealth care settings elsewhere. A previous\nstudy showed that male sex was among\nthe major predictors for MDR-AB.14 In\nthis study, we found that the majority\n(80.3%) of patients in the case group\nstayed in the hospital for longer than 1\nFigure 3.

Another study in Taiwan found that\nprolonged hospital stay affected disease\noutcome and increased the mortality rate\nIn the present study, the respiratory tract\nwas the most frequent site of infection. This\nfinding is similar to a previous report.8\nThe most resistant antibiotics were imipenem\nand gentamicin. This finding is comparable\nwith previous findings where patients who\nwere treated with imipenem had increased\nmortality (17.5%) because of underlying\nillnesses and lowered immunity.15 Our find-\nings are also in agreement with other\nstudies16\u00ad18 that reported that A. baumannii\nwas resistant to several antibiotics. In our\nstudy, patients with immunosuppression\nwere three times more likely to be infected\ncompared with those without immunosup-\nSaudi Arabia, supports this finding, showing\nthat A. baumannii is more common in\npatients who have intravascular catheters,\nhave prior antibiotic use, and use ventilator\nsupport. Our results are also consistent with\nfindings of study15 that reported the anti-\nmicrobial resistance pattern among commu-\nnity-acquired organisms in pilgrims. A.\nbaumannii is highly resistant to carbapenems\nand quinolones.\nFurthermore, in our study, invasive\nprocedures had a significant effect and\nwere strongly associated with A. baumannii\ninfection (Table 2). In particular, patients\nwho had a central venous catheters or\nendotracheal tube were more susceptible to\nA. baumannii infection (Table 3). These\nfindings are similar to previous studies19\u00ad21\nthat reported that previous antibiotic treat-\nment, major surgical procedures, burns,\nimmunosuppression and using invasive\ndevices, especially mechanical ventilation,\npredisposed patients to acquiring A. bau-\nmannii infection.\nConclusion\nWidespread A. baumannii nosocomial\ninfections are increasing, and the situation\nis becoming more serious each day, with\ngrowing drug resistance. Difficulties in\ntreatment are hard to manage. Some of\nthese infections may be reduced if pre-\nvention programmes are timely and effect-\nively applied. Avoidance of unnecessary\nantimicrobial treatment, invasive devices,\nand some other procedures, as well as\nshortening the length of hospital stay by\napplying effective treatment for underlying\nillnesses, may make infections easier to\ncontrol. Furthermore, good sanitation\npractices and staff hygiene may also con-\ntribute to controlling the threat of A.\nbaumannii.\n"
