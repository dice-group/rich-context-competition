    "abstract": "Abstract\nOngoing research has demonstrated that culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students may be disproportionately\nrepresented among students with learning disabilities (LDs). The main aim of this research was to identify groups of CLD\nstudents at risk for LDs using the achievement criterion. To that end, 158 students participated in the current research:\n78 Greeks and 80 Pontian Greeks from the former Soviet Union (Greek FSU-Pontian). Research findings indicated that\nthe use of the achievement criterion alone is inadequate to accurately identify a student being at risk for LDs, given that\nCLD students' language competence and achievement are low mainly due to their bilingualism and that language acquisition\ncompetence is positively associated to language achievement. Professional judgments based on psychoeducational evaluation\ndata are used to classify a student as having a LD. Professional judgment is presented as a possible explanation for the\ndisproportionate representation of CLD students among students with LDs.\n",

This may explain the variety of definitions of LD\n(e.g., Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement\nthe prevalence of LD among student populations internation-\nally, fluctuating from 4% to 30% (Lambert & Sandoval,\n& Shaywitz, 2008); and the disproportionate representation\nof CLD students in LD (Artiles, Kozleski, Trent, Osher, &\nMost LD definitions do not include learning problems\nthat are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor dis-\nabilities; of mental retardation; of emotional disturbance; or\nof environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage\n(IDEIA, 2004). However, according to research data, dispro-\nportionate representation in LD occurs mainly in vulnerable\nsocial groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status\n(SES) and CLD students (Coutinho & Oswald, 2005; Field,\nJette, & Martin, 2006). Consequently, students from vulner-\nable social groups are being placed in special education, cat-\negorized as having LDs, intellectual disabilities, or\nbehavioral-emotional disorders.\nabout 2.8 million CLD students aged 6 years to 21 years\nwere diagnosed with LDs, slightly more than 50% of all stu-\ndents referred for disabilities and special needs (Coutinho\net al., 2002). Moreover, in a nationally representative U.S.\nsample of high-school students, data indicated that CLD stu-\ndents were more likely to be identified as manifesting a LD\n(Shifrer, Muller, & Callahan, 2011). To note, among CLD\nstudents, the LD percentage rates increased whereas rates of\nstudents with intellectual disabilities decreased (Coutinho\net al., 2002). A similar pattern was identified in the general\n1Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece\n2The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nConstantinos Vouyoukas, Faculty of Education, University of Thessaloniki,\nEducational Tower, University Campus, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.\nEmail: costasv@nured.auth.gr\nRepresentation of Culturally and\nLinguistically Diverse Students Among\nStudents With Learning Disabilities: A\nGreek Paradigm\nConstantinos Vouyoukas1, Maria Tzouriadou1,\nEleni Anagnostopoulou1, and Lito E.

According to the Office of Special Education\nPrograms (2007), the numbers of students from vulnerable\nsocial groups placed in special education increased by 6% to\nCummins (1996) associated CLD students' academic dif-\nficulties with their overrepresentation in special education.\nAfter the 1990s, research findings in the United States and\nEuropean Union (EU) countries indicated that CLD students\nexhibited low language achievement and high rates of school\ndropout, and were classified in lower ability groups than\nnative-speaking students (Luciak, 2004; Luciak & Binder,\n2004; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\nIn a synthesis of research findings, focused on Spanish-\nspeaking students of low SES, language competence was\npositively associated with literacy along with a concomitant\nreduction in students' comprehension and writing skills\n(Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, & Christian, 2005).\nOverrepresentation of these students in LD has puzzled\nexperts because (a) students may be referred to special edu-\ncation in response to issues other than LDs, for instance, lim-\nited second language competence, and (b) the identification\nprocess may be inconsistent.\nOther research findings, by contrast, indicate that CLD\nstudents are underrepresented in LD (Hibel, Farkas, &\nMorgan, 2010). This underrepresentation may be associated\nwith lack of access to mental health services or fear of stig-\nmatization (Zuckerman et al., 2014). Furthermore, research\nfindings have indicated that minority students experience\nsystematic victimization and prejudice that leads to their\ncharacterization as problematic and atypical (Hays, Prosek,\n& McLeod, 2010). Similar research findings are reported in\nGreece (Maniatis, Nikolaou, & Papadopoulos, 2009; Psalti\n& Konsantinou, 2007). According to recent research data\n(Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & Maczuga, 2012), the per-\ncentages of CLD students with LDs are low in kindergarten\nand the first three primary school grades and increase from\nthe fourth grade onward when educational demands become\ngreater. Morgan et al. (2012) also claimed that the learning-\ncognitive profiles of CLD students and native-speaking stu-\ndents of low SES do not appear very different from each\nother, so that they equally likely to be considered at risk for\ndevelopmental disorders. Under IDEIA (2004), the LD diag-\nnosis should exclude social, economic, and cultural disad-\nvantaged conditions, inadequate instructional opportunities,\nor limited language competence; however, some LD defini-\ntions include these conditions, possibly leading to dispropor-\ntionate representation patterns (Algozzine & Ysseldyke,\nA common linking factor between CLD students and LDs\nis the type of language competence expected in schools.\nFrom the 1960s, it was noted that children from vulnerable\nsocial groups--particularly low-SES and CLD children--\nunderperform compared with their middle-class, White\nclassmates. This was attributed to low-SES and CLD stu-\ndents' different--but not deficient--language skills, and to a\nmismatch between children's language skills and the type of\nlanguage competence expected in schools (Hoff, 2013).\nUnderperformance of low-SES and CLD children is also due\nto the distinction between limited language competence, and\nLD is not easily detected. In a research review, it was found\nthat CLD students who had been identified with a LD by\ntheir school seemed to be experiencing learning difficulties\nfor reasons other than disability (Wilkinson, Ortiz, Robertson,\n& Kushner, 2006). It is difficult to assess CLD students' lan-\nguage competence, which, if poor, can sometimes be inter-\npreted as a sign of low ability, low school achievement, or\nthe types of assessment tools used (Samson & Lesaux, 2009)\nand to LD diagnosis, which is not only based on measure-\nments but also on judgments made by professionals (Waber,\n2010). Additional social and demographic risk factors for a\nLD diagnosis for CLD students may include poverty and\nlimited access to appropriate school education (Harry,\nAs regards teachers' assessments on students for disabil-\nity, Scott, Boynton Hauerwas, and Brown (2014) argued that\nthe process for determining whether students' difficulties are\ndue to second language acquisition is not well understood or\napplied by schoolteachers, especially as regards the imple-\nmentation of Response to Intervention (RtI; Orosco &\nKlingner, 2010). Research findings from Greece indicate that\nto evaluate both Greek and CLD students for disability,\nschoolteachers mainly give emphasis on students' school\nachievement, which may not be considered as the most\nappropriate form of evaluation (Tzouriadou, Vouyoukas,\nAnagnostopoulou, & Menexes, in press).\nLDs Assessment Models\nUntil 2004, three basic models were employed worldwide\nfor LD diagnosis: the ability-achievement discrepancy\nmodel, the low achievement model, and the intraindividual\ndiscrepancy model. The classic model of LD diagnosis is the\nability-achievement discrepancy model, which aligns with\nthe archetypal notion of LD. Once a student is identified with\nlow achievement without the primal interference of environ-\nmental factors (e.g., behavior, family, social), a specific\ndegree of difference between intellectual ability and perfor-\nmance must be established to classify that student with LDs\n(Kavale, Kauffman, Bachmeier, & LeFever, 2008). This\nmodel has been criticized because it does not differentiate\nthe group of students identified with LDs by the discrepancy\nmodel from the low achievers (Shinn, 2007). The low\nachievement model, in which any student unexpectedly per-\nforming below a certain threshold can be identified with\nVouyoukas et al. 3\nLDs, has also been widely criticized, mainly because it was\nassociated with the tendency to overrepresentation of CLD\nstudents (Fletcher et al., 2005). It has also been criticized for\nnot facilitating the identification of high ability students with\nLDs or average achievement (Giovingo, Proctor, & Prevatt,\n2005). The intraindividual discrepancy model compares spe-\ncific cognitive areas of individual students. It is based on the\npsychology of individual differences psychometric criteria\nand is mainly used by clinicians to apply prescribed interven-\ntions. An uneven student profile with strengths in some areas\nand weaknesses in other suggests a LD, whereas a flat profile\nis an indicator of expected underachievement. This model is\nalso criticized for leading to overrepresentation patterns\namong CLD students in special education (Fletcher et al.,\nAfter 2004, in the United States, the model of RtI was\nincluded in the LD diagnostic process (Fuchs & Fuchs,\n2006). RtI is a multitiered system of supports, according to\nwhich systematic evaluation and intensive individualized\ninstruction are given to refer or not students to special educa-\ntion settings. RtI has been recommended for practitioners\nwho are interested in minority over- or underrepresentation\nin special education as a viable method to assess minority\nstudents (Cohen, Burns, Riley-Tillman, & Hosp, 2015).\nHowever, this model also does not avoid the risk of CLD\nstudents' disproportionate representation in the numbers of\nlearning disabled students (Orosco & Klingner, 2010).\nThe Greek Paradigm\nSince the 1990s, Greece has become host to many CLD\ngroups, both to immigrants and to repatriated Greeks. Most\nof the immigrants have arrived from Albania, and the vast\nmajority of the repatriated Greeks have arrived from the for-\nmer Soviet Union (Luciak, 2004). Most of the repatriated are\nPontians, a group of ancient Greek origin mostly settled\nalong the coast of the Black Sea, who migrated to the Russian\nEmpire over the years of Ottoman domination where they\nThe migration wave has been associated with sociopolitical\nchanges in Eastern Europe, including the reformation of\nSoviet Union and the opening of borders to EU countries\n(Diamanti-Karanou, 2003). Like most immigrants and repa-\ntriated individuals around the world, immigrants and repatri-\nated individuals in Greece face economic and social\ndifficulties. Most immigrants are not competent in the Greek\nlanguage and have not attended the Greek educational\nsystem.\nThe same applies to the Pontian Greeks from the former\nSoviet Union (Greek FSU-Pontian), as neither they nor their\nrecent ancestors had lived in Greece. Immigrants and repatri-\nated individuals in Greece are mostly unemployed or semiem-\nployed, experience communication difficulties with the native\nspeakers, and settle in underprivileged and low-SES areas\nstudents from such backgrounds have insufficient knowledge\nof the Greek language, as they prefer speaking the language of\nthe country of origin at home and to communicate mostly with\ntheir compatriot peers (Papastylianou, 1998). The languages\nGreek FSU-Pontian use to communicate on a daily basis are\nthe Pontian dialect or/and the Russian language. The Pontian\ndialect is the language used by the Greek FSU-Pontian, which\nhas been spoken in the region from ancient times through the\n1920s and continues to be in use by the descendants of those\nresidents mainly in Greece (Chatzissavidis, 2012). The Greek\nFSU-Pontian families use the Greek-Pontial dialect and the\nRussian language in their everyday communication, whereas\nin school their children speak Greek. In this way, the Greek\nFSU-Pontian children are both diglossic and bilingual, as they\nuse a Greek dialect and Russian as primary languages, whereas\nModern Greek is the language of formal education and is used\nfor written and formal spoken purposes (Chatzissavidis, 2012;\nFrom 1994 onward, EU-funded research projects were\ndeveloped to meet immigrant and repatriated students'educa-\ntional and social needs in Greece. The main research projects\nPrograms for Teaching Greek to Immigrant and Repatriated\nThese research projects documented the immigrant and repa-\ntriated student population; identified their language, aca-\ndemic, and social needs; and set up various educational and\nteaching methods for meeting these needs. Data from these\nresearch projects formed the Greek policy that first intro-\nmore recently developed remedial Greek-language courses in\ngeneral education settings for CLD students (Anastasiadi-\nAccording to the latest published statistics of the Greek\nInstitute of Intercultural Education (Instituto Paideias\nOmogenon & Diapolitismikis Ekpaideusis [IPODE], 2010),\nfrom a total of 568,797 students attending primary schools in\nrepatriated were in the Greek region of Central Macedonia,\nnorthern Greece. Similarly, half of the repatriated students\nwere enrolled in schools in Central Macedonia. According to\nKogkidou, Tressou-Milona, and Tsiakalos (1997), most repa-\ntriated families live in the western industrial and underprivi-\nleged city districts of Thessaloniki, the largest city of northern\nGreece and traditionally home to ethnic and religious minor-\nities, such as Roma and Muslims. The rest are scattered\naround Greece. Despite the EU research projects, published\nempirical studies on CLD students in Greece are limited and\nare mainly related to their difficulties in school adaptation\nand participation (e.g., Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf, &\nMasten, 2012; Motti-Stefanidi, Pavlopoulos, Obradovic, &\n4 SAGE Open\npublished records of CLD students' low achievement; pri-\nmarily, there is no published research for those CLD students\nattending primary Greek education (Damanakis, 1997;\n1997). Nonempirical Greek studies have suggested that CLD\nstudents' school difficulties can be attributed to bilingualism\nand low parental expectations (Fillipardou, 1997), which\nmay explain CLD students' high dropout rate from second-\nary education (Vakalios, 1999). Other empirical Greek stud-\nies have associated the difficulties CLD students encounter\nat school with their poor language competence, as well as\nlow SES and poverty (Tzouriadou et al., 2007; Tzouriadou,\nKoutsou, Kidoniatou, Stagiopoulos, & Tzelepi, 2000). To\ndate, no Greek research study has revealed any association\nbetween CLD students' low school achievement and LD\nclassification. This may be attributed to an overgeneraliza-\ntion tendency in interpreting the Law of Special Education\nstudents should not be classified as pupils with LDs because\nof their bilingualism. For the aforementioned reasons, in\nGreece, there are no available data on the possible dispropor-\ntionate representation of CLD students in LDs.\nResearch Questions\nTo better understand the representation patterns among CLD\nstudents in the disability category of LDs, the following\nresearch questions are being addressed in this study:\nResearch Question 1: What are the differences between\nCLD students and their Greek counterparts in terms of\nlanguage acquisition competence and language achieve-\nment, when provided with the same educational opportu-\nnities and belonging to the same SES background?\nResearch Question 2: What is the association between lan-\nguage acquisition competence and language achievement?\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe research sample included 239 students who, according\nto their teachers, had LDs, particularly in reading and writ-\ning. Students were in Grades 4 to 6 at public primary schools\nin underprivileged and low-SES neighborhoods in the west-\nern part of Thessaloniki. The standardized Greek version of\nDetroit Test of Learning Aptitude (DTLA-4; Hammill &\nBryant, 2005; Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, Toutountzi, &\nwhom were shown to have a general learning aptitude quo-\ntient (GlearnAQ) of <70 with no intraindividual differences\nand considered at risk of intellectual disabilities (American\nAssociation on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities\napproximately 80, which is DTLA-4 benchmark for average\naptitude quotient (Hammill & Bryant, 2005; Tzouriadou,\nwere Greek and 116 were CLD students. Among the CLD\nstudents, 36 were Albanians, Roma, or from other countries\noutside Greece, and 80 were Greek FSU-Pontian. Greek\nFSU-Pontian students were selected because they are the\nlargest group of CLD students and, as mentioned above, they\nare mainly concentrated in the low-SES areas ofThessaloniki,\nnorthern Greece. Therefore, the study sample consisted of\nticipants were either born in Greece or had been in the Greek\neducational system for at least 4 years (Cummins, 1996; see\nMeasures\nDTLA-4. GlearnAQ was assessed by administering the Greek\nversion of DTLA-4, which is standardized on the general\nGreek population, including CLD students, to children aged 8\nyears to 15 years 11 months. It consists of nine subtests, which\nprovide a general learning acquisition composite and contrast-\ning domain composite scores (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou,\net al., 2008). Language, attention, and manual dexterity tasks\nform verbal\u00adnonverbal, attention enhanced\u00adattention reduced,\nand motor enhanced\u00admotor reduced composite scores. This\nparticular test was chosen because the composite scores of\nverbal\u00adnonverbal indicate signs of LD. This test holds evi-\ndence of content validity and construct validity, including con-\nvergent and divergent validity (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou,\net al., 2008). Internal consistency reliability coefficients range\nfrom .87 to .95 for the domain composites and are .98 for the\noverall composite (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, et al.,\n--T- (Lato) Language Acquisition Competence Test.Greek\nlanguage acquisition competence was assessed by adminis-\ntering the --T- (Lato) Language Acquisition Competence\nTest, Level II (Tzouriadou, Sigkollitou, Anagnostopoulou, &\nVakola, 2008). As there were no language psychometric tests\nfor use in Greek, the --T- was developed and standard-\nized in the Greek language using a representative sample of\nGreek and CLD students. The --T- is a language acquisi-\ntion test that measures the acquisition process on two levels\n(Level I: 4 years to 7 years 11 months and Level II: 8 years to\nTable 1.

Evidence\nof content and construct validity, including convergent and\ndivergent validity, has been demonstrated (Tzouriadou, Sig-\nkollitou, et al., 2008). The size of the observed correlations\nbetween --T- language acquisition composites and\nDTLA-4 domains revealed congruent validity (Tzouriadou,\nAnagnostopoulou, et al., 2008; Tzouriadou, Sigkollitou,\nAchievement testing.Students' language achievement was\nassessed with an informal test developed by schoolteachers\naccording to the Greek language school curriculum for\nGrades 4 to 6 and measured the following language ele-\nments: story retelling, reading comprehension, grammar,\nsyntax, vocabulary, and spelling (Cronbach's  = .84). This\ntest is used by schoolteachers to measure Greek and CLD\nstudents'language achievement. Objective scoring standards\nto assess language achievement were developed. A score of\n100 was the maximum possible score for each language ele-\nment. Language achievement element scores were converted\nto t scores to enable correlation compatibility with the stan-\ndardized language acquisition composites of the --T-\nLanguage Competence Test, Level II.\nProcedure\nFor the data to be collected, written permission was obtained\nfrom students' parents prior to the assessment procedure.\nData collection was initiated in February 2014 and was com-\npleted in May 2015. In the first stage, the DTLA-4 was\nadministered to students to check for LDs. In the second\nstage, students who scored a GlearnAQ >80 then sat for the\n--T- test. According to DTLA-4 and --T- Level II,\nstudents who were considered to be at risk for LDs met two\ncriteria: (a) an uneven DTLA-4 linguistic profile with a SD\n\u00b13 between the higher nonverbal and lower verbal compos-\nites, and (b) a SD \u00b115 between the higher GlearnAQ and the\nlower general language acquisition quotient (GLAQ;\nTzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, et al., 2008; Tzouriadou,\nStatistical Analysis\nMann\u00adWhitney tests, after a significant omnibus Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis test, were used to explore differences between Greek\nand Greek FSU-Pontian students at risk for LDs and Greek\nand Greek FSU-Pontian typically developed students on the\nGLAQ, the scores in language acquisition composites and\nmodalities, the general language achievement (GLA) scores,\nand the language achievement domain scores.\nSpearman's rho correlation coefficients were used to evalu-\nate the associations between GLAQ and the GLA in the study\nsample. To explore graphically the abovementioned associa-\ntions, the Loess curve, the optimally fitted curve that best\ndescribes the relationship between the examined variables,\nwas plotted on the corresponding scatterplots (Jacoby, 2000).\nThe observed significance level (p value) in all statistical\nhypothesis testing procedures was estimated by the Monte\nCarlo simulation method. This method leads to valid inferen-\ntial conclusions, even in cases where the methodological pre-\nsuppositions (random sampling, independent observations,\nsymmetrical distributions and absence of outliers) of the\nnonparametric tests are not satisfied (Mehta & Patel, 1996).\nResults\nAccording to DTLA-4 and --T- Level II, 56 students out\nof the 158 students in the study sample were considered at\nrisk for LDs. Of these, 25 were Greeks and 31 were Greek\nFSU-Pontian. The remaining 102 students were considered\ntypically developed without an uneven DTLA-4 linguistic\nprofile (nonverbal\u00adverbal) or differences between general\nlearning acquisition quotient and GLAQ. Of these, 49 were\nGreeks and 31 were Greek FSU-Pontian (see Table 2). This\nfinding highlights the increased danger of CLD and low-SES\nstudents' disproportionate representation in LDs (Artiles &\nsupports the view that the use of the achievement criterion\nalone is inadequate for identifying a student at risk for LDs\nStatistically significant differences were detected between\nGreek students at risk for LDs (GLD) and Pontian Greek stu-\ndents from the former Soviet Union at risk for LDs (Greek\nFSU-Pontian LD) in GLAQ (p < .015), in reception language\ncomposite (p < .002), in organization language composite (p <\n.046), and in morphological language modality (p < .008), the\nGLD group of students scoring more highly than the others\n(see Table 3). This finding can be attributed to CLD students'\nbilingualism. These students lack a deep understanding of the\nGreek language as compared with their Greek classmates of\nsimilar SES and educational opportunities. This deficit can be\nseen particularly in the differences found in the morphological\nlanguage modality, which is associated with deep language\nstructure (Chomsky, 1965). These differences may imply that\nTable 2. Study Sample Description.\nGreek FSU-\nPontianTD\nGreek FSU-\nPontianLD\nNote. n = 158.

It seems that lan-\nguage acquisition competence is associated with language\nachievement. Other research evidence supports this finding\nthere is no other psychometric test that measures language\nacquisition competence, and --T- test may be used to\npredict school language achievement.\nDiscussion\nTeachers'judgments on CLD and low-SES students at risk for\nLDs based on the school achievement criterion were not\naccurate. School achievement is considered a social construct\nmainly concerning native-speaking, middle-class students\n(Peske & Haycock, 2006). School achievement is also based\non teachers'subjective perceptions and knowledge, which are\nshaped by their teaching experience. For these reasons, and\nbearing in mind that in Greece there are no standardized\nachievement tests in use, it came as no surprise that the\nresearch sample included students at risk for intellectual dis-\nabilities. Moreover, as has already been mentioned, a LD\ndiagnosis is based on judgments made by professionals,\nwhich often, but not exclusively, follow measurements\nTo reduce the possibility of inconsistent and inaccurate\njudgments on LDs, given the unknown nature of its causes,\nresearchers could use samples of participants with similar\ncharacteristics. This research study sample consisted entirely\nof students from low-SES areas who attended underprivi-\nleged schools with low educational opportunities. One group\nwas bilingual and diglossic (Greek FSU-Pontian).\nConvenience sampling was used, in which students were\nselected to participate from available areas and populations.\nBecause of the small sample size, it is unclear whether the\nresults can be generalized to the wider population. Still, this\nstudy can be considered for future research. The fact that all\nstudy sample students came from the same population may\nexplain why both native and minority students had similar\nlanguage and achievement profiles and why language com-\npetence and achievement differences between them could be\nassumed to be due to CLD students' bilingualism. The stan-\ndardized Language Acquisition Competence Test (Lato)\nused in this research proved that it can be a prediction tool\nfor language achievement, as strong and positive correlations\nwere found between this test and the informal language\nachievement test.\nAnother research finding was that both native speakers\nand CLD students were identified as being at risk for LDs,\nwith similar learning and language competence profiles.\nNowadays, LD is best understood as a function of the devel-\nopmental interaction between the child's inherent difficulties,\nwhose causes are still unknown, and environmental factors\n(Waber, 2010). LD appears in the early developmental stages,\nwith indications mostly found in language development,\nwhich comprises the basis of general learning competence.\nSpecial education legislation in Greece has aimed to reduce\nprejudices toward CLD students and, as already mentioned,\nthus excludes these students from being classified as learning\ndisabled. In a recent Greek study, it was found that in-service\nschoolteachers believe that dyslexia--another term used to\ndescribe students with a specific LD--is not related to CLD\nstudents, whereas university students, who have more up-to-\ndate theoretical knowledge, believe that CLD students can\nhave dyslexia (Tzouriadou et al., in press).\nConclusion\nTaking all these factors into account, it is impossible to state\nwith certainty whether CLD students in Greece are dispro-\nportionately represented among students with LDs. This is a\nhindrance to tackling prejudice and victimization, because\nno suitable teaching practices are provided for CLD students\nin need. The remedial Greek language instruction applied\nwith some groups of CLD students is not based on any evalu-\nation of their needs, and it appears that second-generation\nCLD students (Greek FSU-Pontians) are underachievers at\nschool (Kessidou, 2008). CLD students' integration from\nintercultural schools and classes into general Greek educa-\ntion was not based on evaluation of their language skills but\nwas intended primarily to reduce prejudices toward cultural\nand language diversity. Further research is needed in larger\nsamples of various CLD student populations in Greece to test\nthe possibility that CLD students may have LDs, but not only\non the basis of the achievement criterion. Accordingly, CLD\nstudents' evaluation for disability should focus on assessing\ntheir language acquisition. Furthermore, CLD students' edu-\ncation should concentrate on language subjects, being taught\nwith special teaching methods.\nFigure 1.
