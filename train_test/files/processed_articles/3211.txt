Firms insure themselves\nagainst this risk by securing backup lines of credit from banks that they may\nuse should market liquidity dry up. In a first step, this paper explains why\nhigh quality firms introduce a maturity mismatch into their balance sheets\nand do not simply use long-term direct finance. It also highlights why banks\nmay be willing to roll over a firm's debt while direct investors may not. In a\nsecond step, I extend the model to allow for different levels of firm's publicly\nobservable credit quality. Under plausible assumptions about the cost of bank\nborrowing the model generates a maturity structure choice broadly consistent\nwith observed financing patterns: Low quality firms issue short-term direct\ndebt, medium quality firms issue long-term direct debt, and high quality firms\nuse short-term direct debt in normal times and bank debt in adverse times. The\npaper suggests that better publicly available information about firm quality and\nthe moderation of the business cycle over the past decade help to explain the\ndecrease in nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding since the beginning of\nthe decade.\n",

This\npaper lays out a simple model that aims to answer two important questions about\nthe commercial paper market and firms' choice of financing arrangements. First,\nwhy are firms of the highest credit quality sometimes denied short-term credit in\npublic markets though their default risk is minuscule? Second, why do they pre-\nfer a financing arrangement whereby they use short-term direct finance in \"good\"\ntimes and short-term bank debt in \"bad\" times instead of simply issuing long-term\ndirect debt and getting rid of the maturity mismatch? The model proposes that\nwhile high-quality firms have no default risk during good times, some of these firms'\nprospects deteriorate during bad times. Direct investors who do not know which\nfirms' prospects worsen in case of recession are better off denying credit to all firms\nduring bad times. Asymmetric information between investors and the firm hence\nmatters during recessions. However, in good times direct investors refinance all firms\nand asymmetric information does not play a role.\nBy contrast, banks by screening borrowers who they committed to lend on a\ncontingent basis are able to differentiate between good and bad firms. However, as\nscreening is costly it is only used when needed (i.e. during recessions). Borrowing\nshort-term and making the choice between direct and intermediated finance depen-\ndent on the aggregate state of the economy may in the end be a cheaper option for\nfirms than simply issuing long-term direct debt. In the latter case direct investors\nneed to be compensated for the risk of making a loss as a result of being unable to\nidentify and liquidate bad firms during a recession.\nExtending the model to allow for differences in firms' publicly observable risk\ncharacteristics (i.e. credit rating) it is possible to derive firms' debt maturity choice\nas a function of their ratings. Firms with the highest ratings are able and willing to\nissue commercial paper and secure a backup line of credit. Firms with slightly lower\nratings issue long-term direct debt and firms with still lower ratings are restricted to\nborrow short-term. These latter firms will always be liquidated during bad times.\nFinally, the paper examines the comparative statics with respect to changes in\nthe degree of asymmetric information and the probability of the economy entering\na recession. Information between investors and the firm becoming more symmetric\n(e.g. as a result of the 'IT revolution') and/or recessions becoming less likely ('Great\nModeration') lead to an increase in direct lending and fewer firms issuing commercial\npaper and securing a backup line of credit. These structural reasons may help explain\nthe large decline in nonfinancial commercial paper issuance since the beginning of\nthe decade.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nKapitalmarktf\u00a8\nahige Unternehmen k\u00a8\nonnen sich nur dann durch die Ausgabe von\nkurzfristigen Geldmarktpapieren (Commercial Paper - CP) refinanzieren, wenn sie\neine vernachl\u00a8\nassigbare Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit aufweisen. Gleichwohl ist es diesen\nFirmen bisweilen nicht m\u00a8\noglich, eine Anschlussfinanzierung vorzunehmen. In solchen\nSituationen k\u00a8\nonnen CP-Emittenten auf Kreditlinien ausweichen, sofern sie diese\nzuvor mit Banken vereinbart haben und sich ihre Kreditqualit\u00a8\nat bei Inanspruch-\nnahme der Kreditlinie nicht verschlechtert hat. In dem vorliegenden Papier wer-\nden zun\u00a8\nachst zwei Fragenkomplexe n\u00a8\naher untersucht. Erstens, warum bekommen\nFirmen von h\u00a8\nochster Kreditqualit\u00a8\nat zu bestimmten Zeiten keinen Kredit, obwohl\nihre tats\u00a8\nachliche Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit nahe null liegt? Zweitens, warum w\u00a8\nahlen\ndiese Firmen eine Finanzierungsform, bei der sie sich in guten Zeiten \u00a8\nuber die Aus-\ngabe von Geldmarktpapieren finanzieren und in schlechten Zeiten einen Bankkredit\nin Anspruch nehmen? Warum nehmen sie eine Inkongruenz der Laufzeiten zwischen\nAktiv- und Passivseite in Kauf, anstatt lang laufende Anleihen zu emittieren und\nsich somit keinem Refinanzierungsrisiko auszusetzen?\nIn dem vorgestellten Modell haben s\u00a8\namtliche Firmen im normalen Zustand der\n\u00a8\nOkonomie zun\u00a8\nachst kein Ausfallrisiko. Bei einer Rezession verschlechtern sich die\nAussichten eines Teils dieser Firmen allerdings betr\u00a8\nachtlich. Direkte Investoren\nk\u00a8\nonnen zwischen solchen Firmen, deren Ausblick unabh\u00a8\nangig vom Zustand der\n\u00a8\nOkonomie ist, und solchen, deren Ausblick sich bei Rezessionen deutlich verschlech-\ntert, nicht unterscheiden und verweigern deshalb im Falle eines wirtschaftlichen Ab-\nschwungs allen Firmen einen Kredit. Asymmetrische Information zwischen Fir-\nmen und direkten Investoren spielt folglich nur in Rezessionsphasen eine Rolle. In\nguten Zeiten werden hingegen alle Firmen refinanziert. Im Unterschied zu direk-\nten Investoren k\u00a8\nonnen Banken private Informationen \u00a8\nuber potentielle Kreditnehmer\ngewinnen, vorausgesetzt, sie unterhalten bereits eine Gesch\u00a8\naftsbeziehung zu der\nFirma. Diese Informationen versetzen sie in die Lage, zwischen guten und schlechten\nKreditnehmern zu unterscheiden und in einer Abschwungphase nur gute zu refi-\nnanzieren. Da das Screening durch Banken allerdings teuer ist, werden Bankkre-\ndite nur dann in Anspruch genommen, wenn eine andere Finanzierungsform nicht\nverf\u00a8\nugbar ist (d.h. in Rezessionen). Die kurzfristige Finanzierung erm\u00a8\noglicht eine\nflexible Anpassung an ver\u00a8\nanderte Zust\u00a8\nande der Gesamtwirtschaft und kann dabei\ng\u00a8\nunstiger sein als die Ausgabe von l\u00a8\nangerfristigen Bonds. Insbesondere muss eine\nl\u00a8\nangerfristige Finanzierung nicht-informierte Investoren f\u00a8\nur das Risiko kompensieren,\nin Rezessionen schlechte Firmen nicht erkennen und liquidieren zu k\u00a8\nonnen.\nBei einer Erweiterung des Modells um Firmen mit in normalen Zeiten posi-\ntiven und \u00a8\noffentlich bekannten Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten (Ratings), l\u00a8\nasst sich die\nWahl der F\u00a8\nalligkeit von Verbindlichkeiten in Abh\u00a8\nangigkeit des Ratings bestim-\nmen. Firmen mit der h\u00a8\nochsten Kreditqualit\u00a8\nat emittieren CP und sichern ihre Re-\nfinanzierung durch eine Kreditlinie bei Banken ab. Firmen mit etwas geringerem\nRating emittieren langfristige Anleihen. Firmen, deren Rating gerade noch eine Di-\nrektfinanzierung erlaubt, k\u00a8\nonnen nur kurzfristige Anleihen emittieren und m\u00a8\nussen\nauf eine Liquidit\u00a8\natsgarantie durch Banken verzichten. Diese theoretischen Ergeb-\nnisse sind weitestgehend konsistent mit empirischen Untersuchungen zur Wahl der\nLaufzeiten von Unternehmensverbindlichkeiten.\nIn einem letzten Schritt wird der Einfluss einer \u00a8\nAnderung des Grades an asym-\nmetrischer Information und der Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Rezession untersucht. Dabei\nzeigt sich, dass mit zunehmend symmetrischer Information - etwa infolge besserer\nVerbreitung von Information durch das Internet - und mit abnehmender Rezessions-\nwahrscheinlichkeit (\"Great Moderation\") sich mehr Firmen direkt am Kapitalmarkt\nrefinanzieren und weniger \u00a8\nuber die Ausgabe von CP in Verbindung mit einer Kredit-\nlinie.

As uncertainty about\ncredit losses related to the US subprime housing market surged in the summer of\n2007, investors began to shun any security for which such losses were deemed pos-\nsible. In particular, this included asset-backed commercial papers (ABCPs), which\nare collateralized short-term debt instruments that are continuously rolled over to\nprovide financing to an issuing programme. With major banks providing backup\nliquidity to ABCP programmes, resulting rollover problems quickly translated into\nhigh demands for liquidity from banks. This appears to have taken some CP issuers\nand banks by surprise during this episode.\nBy contrast, in the market for nonfinancial CP rollover problems and resulting\ndemands for liquidity from banks have been well-known phenomena ever since the\nPenn Central bankruptcy episode in 1970. In the aftermath of the recession of\nCentral Transportation Company failed in June 1970 and defaulted on its USD 82m\noutstanding CP. As described by Davis (1999) investors, uncertain over credit risk,\nwere driven away from the CP market. Companies in turn proved unable to roll\nover their CP and without alternative funding sources fears of a wave of corporate\nbankruptcies spread. Intervention was deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve and\ntook the form of suspension of interest rate ceilings on banks' certificate of deposits\n1I would like to thank Ben Craig, Klaus D\u00a8\nullmann, Falko Fecht, Thilo Liebig, Reinhard Schmidt,\nRainer Schulz, and seminar participants at the Deutsche Bundesbank and the University of Ab-\nerdeen for helpful comments. All remaining errors are my own.\nand notification that the discount window was available for banks needing reserves to\nextend loans to companies. No other commercial paper issuer defaulted thereafter.\nAfter the Penn Central crisis, companies routinely arranged back-up lines of credit\nat banks, which they could rely on during times when the commercial paper market\nturned unreceptive. This greatly enhanced funding stability. For example, during\nthe Russian/LTCM crisis in 1998 and the Enron/Worldcom crisis in 2002 there were\nagain rollover problems in the market for nonfinancial CP. However, during these\nepisodes US non-financial firms were able to switch between markets and backup\nlines of credit with banks. Moreover, banks experienced larger inflows of funds -\npossibly from investors fleeing financial markets - just when firms unable to access\ncapital markets drew down backup lines of credit (see Gatev and Strahan (2006)).\nThus, banks helped intermediate liquidity back into the system.\nIn this paper I focus on the market for nonfinancial commercial paper and on\nfirms' debt maturity choice. Interestingly, despite rollover risk CP (in combination\nwith backstop liquidity facilities) has remained an important funding source for top-\nrated corporate borrowers. Given the episodes described, two important questions\nappear to be particularly important. First, given that only firms with virtually\nno default risk have access to the nonfinancial CP market why are they sometimes\ndenied credit? Second, why are banks willing to supply funding to (at least some)\nfirms when direct investors deny credit? It is important to note that backup lines of\ncredit usually contain 'material adverse change' clauses which allow banks to cancel\ncredit lines if the financial condition of a the would-be borrowing firm significantly\nchanges. This implies that banks do not extend credit in adverse times because\nthey are willing to hold higher credit risk. For backup lines to be of any use to the\nborrower it must hence be the case that banks at times come to different conclusions\nabout a firms' credit risk than direct investors do. Furthermore, it is important to\nnote that - unlike deposit insurance in the case of banks - backup lines of credit\nhave not prevented the CP market from drying up at times.2 This may suggest\n2For simplicity, nonfinancial commercial paper is henceforth referred to only as 'commercial\nthat rollover crises in the CP market are not the result of a coordination problem\n(i.e. a 'panic' equilibrium) among dispersed investors but instead are driven by\nfundamentals.\nIn contrast to today's observed borrowing arrangements by top quality firms most\nmodels that explain the choice of firms between bank loans and publicly traded debt\nignore contingent bank lending. Instead, these models claim that firms either choose\nbank loans or issue bonds (e.g. Bolton and Freixas (2000), Holmstr\u00a8\nom and Tirole\n(1997), Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1994)). Though banks are seen to be particularly\ngood at helping borrowers through times of financial difficulties, banking finance is\nassumed more costly than direct finance. Hence, according to these models firms\nwith a low probability of financial distress prefer to tap the bond markets and refrain\nfrom bank borrowing at all times. Why then do we observe contingent bank lending\nin the form of backup liquidity facilities that nowadays almost always accompany\nCP programs? The higher costs of using banking finance should be reflected in any\nfee banks charge for providing backup liquidity facilities and hence should ultimately\nbe borne by firms. Does this not counteract the advantage of using short-term direct\nfinance? Why does the firm not get rid of these costs and the maturity mismatch\nthat gives rise to rollover risk by simply issuing a long-term bond?3\nThis paper presents a model in which asymmetric information between investors\nand the firm only matters in some states of the business cycle. More specifically, I\nassume that in normal times information about firm quality is broadly symmetric.\nHaving a relationship with a bank is not particularly important for high quality firms\nin these times as direct lenders will be willing to provide funding. However, during a\nrecession only some firms are hit by a shock that makes their prospects deteriorate.\nInformation about the impact of a shock is however asymmetric. Whereas the firm\npaper.'\n3Indeed, as Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1995) point out, though CP has a short-term\nmaturity, it is not only used to finance short-term needs. Nonfinancial firms indeed often use CP\nas financing for capital expenditures and roll it over continuously or until alternative financing is\nfound.\nknows whether it has been hit, direct investors do not. Direct investors are hence\nunable to sort out firms whose prospects have deteriorated substantially from those\nthat have not. As a consequence, they are unwilling to renew lending even to high\nquality firms. By contrast, a bank is assumed to gain private information about\nborrowers when it commits to lend to the firm on a contingent basis. This enables\nthe bank to sort out high quality firms during times of recession and renew lending\nto these firms.\nHowever, because of screening costs banking finance is more expensive than di-\nrect finance. It thus never makes sense for high quality firms to use intermediated\nfinance during normal times when asymmetric information does not affect outcomes.\nBy setting up a financing arrangement whereby the firm borrows from short-term\ndirect investors during normal times and switches to banking finance in case of reces-\nsion the firm minimizes intermediation costs while still enjoying the benefit of being\nrefinanced in bad times. Provided there is a sufficient degree of asymmetric infor-\nmation between direct investors and the firm and intermediation costs are not too\nhigh the firm may actually prefer this financing arrangement over issuing long-term\ndirect debt. This is so because the firm has to compensate LT direct investors for\nthe potential agency problem at the intermediate stage which might be more costly\nthan using short-term finance together with a backup line of credit. Furthermore,\nif the cost of using banking finance falls with a higher credit rating it is possible\nto derive theoretical results about firms' debt maturity choice which are broadly\nconsistent with observed practice. Top quality firms are able and willing to issue\ncommercial paper and secure a backup line of credit. Firms with a slightly lower\nrating issue long-term direct debt and firms with a still lower rating are restricted to\nborrow short-term. These latter firms will always be liquidated during bad times.\nThere is empirical evidence that maturity mismatch and liquidity risk are real\nconcerns for firms and that it affects their choice of debt maturity. In a survey among\nfinancial executives Graham and Harvey (2001) report that the two most important\nfactors affecting firms' debt maturity choice were \"matching the maturity of debt\nwith the life of assets\" and \"the cost of refinancing in bad times\" - much in line with\nthe proposed model.\nThe paper adds to the theoretical literature concerned with the coexistence of\nbank lending and direct lending, most notably, Bolton and Freixas (2000), Boot and\nRepullo and Suarez (1998). The main contribution to this literature is to view the\nchoice of top quality firms between direct and intermediated debt as dependent on\nthe aggregate state of the economy rather than a static, one-off choice. Empirically,\nthe fact that banks often experience an increase in asset growth due to a drawdown\nof credit lines by firms unable to tap CP markets has recently been documented by\nsome authors (e.g. Gatev and Strahan (2006)).\nFinally, there are some papers concerned with firms' debt maturity choice. Most\nnotably, in Diamond (1991) firms with a higher credit rating use more short-term\ndebt than firms with lower credit ratings. The reason is that a firm's insiders have\ninformation about the firm's default risk that is superior to that of its creditors.\nThis is a problem for a firm that is truly more creditworthy than other firms. Unless\nit can find some way to signal its private information, it will end up borrowing at\ntoo high a rate. Diamond argues that one possible way for the low-risk firm to lower\nits borrowing costs is to shorten its debt maturity since private information will\ngradually become more public in the course of time. My model also stresses a firm's\nconcern about being pooled with lower quality borrowers. However, the reason for\nthe firm being concerned is that it fears not being refinanced in case of recession.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines the model. Section III\nderives the optimal mode of financing for firms without (publicly observable) credit\nrisk. Section IV introduces publicly observable credit risk and derives a firm's debt\nmaturity choice as a function of its rating. Section V discusses comparative static\nresults. Finally, Section VI offers some conclusions.\n2 The Model\nConsider an economy with three types of risk-neutral agents: firms, banks and\ndirect investors. All agents are protected by limited liability. Firms are run by\nentrepreneurs who do not have any initial wealth and therefore need to raise outside\nfunds for investment by selling bonds to direct investors or by obtaining bank loans.\nAll contracts are thus restricted to be debt contracts.\nThere are three dates (t = 0, 1, 2) in the economy and a continuum of firms. Each\nfirm (entrepreneur) has the opportunity of undertaking a project that requires an\ninvestment of 1 at t = 0 and pays off a return at t = 2. Firms differ in the way their\nprojects are affected by the state of the economy which is revealed at t = 1 after the\ninitial investment has been made, but before any short-term loans are rolled over.\nWith probability  the economy is in a good state and the return of each project in\nthe economy is H. With probability 1 -  a recession occurs which affects some\nfirms in the economy in such a way that their projects return only L (L\n< H)\nat t = 2 subject to continuation. All other projects are unaffected by the recession\nand still return H.\nIf instead of being continued a project is liquidated at t = 1 it yields a liquidation\nvalue of AH if it is a firm with a high cash flow realization in a recession or AL if it\nis a firm with a low cash flow realization in a recession. Firms are labelled according\nto their return in recessions (alternatively, their liquidation value at t = 1): 'Good'\nfirms return H (and have a liquidation value of AH), whereas 'bad' firms only return\nL (and have a liquidation value of AL). Regardless of their project's observable\nreturn firms (entrepreneurs) receive a non-transferable private benefit B > 0 at date\nt = 2 provided the firm is not liquidated. I assume that H\n> AH\n>\nL +B > 0 which implies - inter alia - that neither from a lender's nor from a social\npoint of view does it make sense to finance a bad firm, i.e. (H +B)+(1-)AL\nHowever, the presence of the non-transferable private benefit makes bad firms want\nto get financing since they are able to gain B in the good state while they cannot\nlose anything in the bad state (limited liability). This is similar to Holmstr\u00a8\nom and\nAs in Bolton and Freixas (2000) firms differ in the probability pR of having a\nhigh cash flow realization at date t = 2 in case of recession (or, if abandoned, a\nhigh liquidation value at date t = 1). The range of possible values for pR is simply\n{0, 1}. Agents are assumed to have different information about the value of pR. More\nspecifically, I assume that pR is information private to the firm at date t = 0 and may\nbe revealed to a bank at date t = 1 but only if the bank engaged in a relationship\nwith the firm at date t = 0. A relationship here involves regular visits with the firm\nto learn about its business and possibly to get access to private information. A bank\nand a firm only engage in a relationship at t = 0 if the bank either provides outright\nfunding at t = 0 or commits to provide funding on a contingent basis at t = 1. For\ndirect investors or banks that did not engage in a relationship, pR is revealed at\ndate t = 1 only if the firm is liquidated. By contrast, in case of continuation these\ninvestors learn firms' type not before t = 2 . At date t = 0 lenders' prior belief about\nthe value of pR is pR = 1 with probability  and pR = 0 with probability 1 -  so\nthat E[pR] = .\n[Figure 1 about here.]\nTo make matters interesting, I further make the following assumption:\nH + (1 - )L\ni.e. the continuation value of a firm of unknown type is less than 1 which in turn\nis less than the firm's liquidation value. This assumption is equivalent to lenders'\nprior belief about a given firm's type, , lying within the range (, \u00af\n) defined by\nAH\nand \u00af\nH\n-L\n. It implies that given a recession a short-term investor\nnot knowing a firm's type will always liquidate the firm instead of rolling over its\ndebt and waiting until t = 2 for project returns to realize.4 If the continuation\nvalue of the firm was greater or equal to 1, there would always be an investor willing\nto extend a loan of size 1 at date 1 to a firm of unknown type. Hence maturing\nshort-term debt would always be refinanced. Lending between dates 0 and 1 would\nthen be riskless and the interest rate in this period would equal the direct investor's\nopportunity cost of capital, which is 1. If the continuation value was greater than\nits liquidation value the firm's debt would be rolled over in a recession since initial\ninvestors in the firm would fare better than if they liquidated the firm. However,\nthe liquidation decision under direct (uninformed) finance is not socially optimal ex\npost. Instead, it would be optimal to liquidate bad projects (as L + B < AL) but\nto continue good projects (as H + B > AH).\nIt is important to note that the presence of (non-discriminable) good firms en-\nables bad firms to receive funding at all. A bad firm therefore never wants to signal\nits type to an investor and always wants to mimic a good firm, for otherwise it would\nnot be able to carry out its project and receive the private benefit B.\n2.2 Financing Options\nFirms have the possibility of financing a project either by using direct finance or by\nusing intermediated (banking) finance or a combination of the two. These financing\noptions differ in the costs/benefits they offer to firms.\nUnder direct finance firms simply have to offer the opportunity cost of capital\n(in expected value terms), i.e. the gross market rate of return, which is normalized\nto 1. Direct investors never screen firms because they do not have the expertise\nto generate valuable information. By contrast, banks, engage in costly screening\nactivity whenever they extend a loan which enables them to determine a given\n4Note that the above assumption is somewhat stronger than necessary to guarantee liquidation\nduring a recession. In fact, for short-term debt not to be rolled it is sufficient that H\n<\n< AH\n+ (1 - )AL\n. However, to facilitate the ongoing analysis I will stick\nto the stronger assumption.\nfirm's type. Banks may actually determine the firm's type before extending the\nloan.5 However, to be able to do so they need to have some prior relationship\nwith the firm. For simplicity, the bank's one-off screening cost c  0 is taken to\nbe exogenous. Extending a bank loan of amount 1 at date t = i thus leads to a\nminimum repayment of 1 + c at date t = i + 1.\n2.3 State-Contingent Contracts\nAs in Bolton and Freixas (2000) I first consider, as a benchmark, the financing choice\nof a firm that is able to offer state-contingent returns to investors, i.e. returns that\ndepend on the aggregate state of the economy and the firm's type. I will just con-\nsider the contracting problem of a good firm that knows that every contract it offers\nwill be mimicked by a bad firm. Any deviation by the bad firm would reveal its type\nand would make borrowing impossible. There is hence no possibility in the model\nfor the good firm to escape this pooling equilibrium.\nDirect lending. The contracting problem of a good firm that is able to obtain\nfinancing from uninformed investors only is to offer state-contingent returns {RN\n,\nRR\n, RR\n, RR\n, RR\n} so as to maximize its total surplus, where RN\nis the date 2\nreturn in normal times and RR\n, RR\nand RR\n, RR\nare the date 1 and 2 returns in\na recession dependent on the firm being good or bad, respectively. Quite crucially,\nthe firm also has to decide whether it wants its project to be liquidated in case of\nrecession or not. Let x  {0, 1} be the firm's decision variable which is equal to 1 if\nit wants to continue its project during a recession and 0 otherwise. The good firm\nthen sets state-contingent returns and x to solve\nmax  H + B - RN\n+ (1 - ) x(H + B - RR\n) + (1 - x)(AH\n- RR\nsubject to\nRN\n+ (1 - )RR\n) + x(RR\n+ (1 - )RR\n5In other words, screening without lending is possible but lending without screening is not.\nand RN\n H, RR\n H, RR\n L. It is quite obvious\nthat the good firm will set RR\n= AL, RR\n= L, and RN\n= H. The good firm\nwill pledge the highest amounts possible in case of being revealed a bad firm during\na recession, as it will never have to pay these amounts anyway. Moreover, the firm\nprefers repayment in normal times as it has to compensate investors for asymmetric\ninformation only during recessionary episodes. Hence, it will set RN\nequal to the\nmaximum amount possible, H.6 The good firm's repayment in a recession now\ndepends on its decision whether or not to continue its project. In each case it will\nset the amount, RR\nor RR\n, equal to the lowest value satisfying the constraint\n(equation 3). Therefore, for x = 1 the good firm's repayment in case of recession is\ngiven by\nRR\n=\nBy contrast, if the firm chooses not to continue its project during a recession (i.e.\nx = 0) its repayment is given by\nRR\n=\n> L the amount the firm has to pay in a recession is lower if the project is\nliquidated. However, in this case the firm loses its private benefit B. Quite clearly,\nwhether or not the firm wants its project to be completed in bad times, i.e. whether\nx = 1 or x = 0, depends on the magnitude of B. If B is 'small' the firm may actually\nprefer liquidation in bad times.7\nAssume that B is sufficiently high so that continuation in a recession is actually\npreferred. It is then possible to determine the extra cost the firm has to pay in a\n6Note that pledging 1 unit less in the good state while pledging /(1 - ) more in the bad\nstate does not matter to the firm. However, pledging 1 unit less in the good state while pledging\n/[(1 - )] in the bad state with 0 <  < 1, which would not matter to the investor, is clearly less\nfavorable to the firm. Hence, the firm will choose maximum repayment in normal times.\n7More specifically, for liquidation to be preferred B must be such that B + (1 -\n) H\n+ B < B+(1-) AH\nor H\n<\n\n- L\n]. Hence for liquidation to be preferred by a good firm it must be the case that infor-\nmation is asymmetric, i.e.  < 1.\nrecession which is due to direct investors not being able to distinguish between good\nand bad firms (henceforth denoted 'asymmetric information cost'). Let RR\nbe the return the good firm has to pledge in the full information case. Then the\nasymmetric information cost under direct lending is given by\nRR\n- RR\n=\n\n=\n\nNote that H + (1 - )L is the return that each firm (independent of its type\nand the state of the economy) is able to pay with certainty, i.e. this is the portion\nof the cash flow on which there is no asymmetric information. For a firm to finance\nits project, however, it must raise additional capital of 1 - (H + (1 - )L) > 0\nat date t = 0. In the full information case the good firm would simply promise to\n[1 - (H + (1 - )L)] in the recessionary state to ensure financing. By\ncontrast, under asymmetric information the good firm has to incur an additional\ncost of 1-\n\nper unit pledged in the recessionary state.8\nBanking finance. In contrast to direct investors, a bank that extends a loan at\ndate t = 0 and thereby engages in screening activity is able to distinguish between\ngood and bad firms at date t = 1. Of course, screening is only valuable if a reces-\nsion occurs with some positive probability. Given the assumptions about screening\ncosts the maximization problem the firm faces when it only relies on bank lending\nis to offer 1) state-contingent returns {RN\n, RR\n, RR\n, RR\n} and 2) a continuation\ndecision at date t = 1 in case of recession that is given by x  {0, 1} to solve\nmax (H + B - RN\n) + (1 - )x(H + B - RR\n) + (1 - )(1 - x)(AH\n- RR\nsubject to\nRN\n+ (1 - )[xRR\n+ (1 - x)RR\n+ (1 - )RR\n8It can easily be checked that the asymmetric information cost that the firm incurs should it\nprefer to be liquidated during a recession is equal to 1-\n\n+ (1 - )AL\n)) .\nand RR\n H, and RN\n H.\nAs in the direct lending case it is quite obvious that the good firm will set\nRN\n= H and RR\n= AL. Furthermore, the firm will always choose to continue (i.e.\nx = 1) in case of recession since it is always able to pay at least the amount as under\nliquidation while still being better off. Again, the good firm sets RR\nequal to the\nlowest value satisfying the bank's participation constraint (equation 9) or\nRR\n=\n\n- (1 - )AL\nThe asymmetric information cost that the firm has to incur when using banking\nfinance becomes\nRR\n- RR\n=\n\nNote that the asymmetric information cost under bank lending may actually be\nlower than under direct lending provided the extra cost of banking finance is lower\nthan its expected benefit, i.e. c < (1 - )[AL\n- L].\nHowever, if the firm's private benefit B is low and the firm actually prefers being\nliquidated in a recession under direct finance, the asymmetric information cost under\nbank lending will be indisputably higher as c > 0. Nonetheless, as the good firm's\nproject has a higher continuation than liquidation value (i.e. H + B > AH) the\nfirm may still decide to use banking finance. More specifically, the firm will borrow\nfrom banks whenever9\n\nThe right-hand side of the inequality is the expected benefit of using banking finance.\nQuite intuitively, this is the difference between the continuation value and the liqui-\ndation value of the good project (in expected value terms). The left-hand side is the\nexpected extra cost of bank lending. Note that this is more than the bank's screen-\ning cost as  < 1. More specifically, it also encompasses the difference in expected\n9From (2) and (8) with values inserted.\nasymmetric information costs between bank lending and direct lending10, i.e.\n\nc =\n\nc\nDifference in expected AI costs\n+ c\nScreening cost\nIn practice, the state-contingent contracts discussed do not exist. One reason might\nbe that the recessionary state of the economy is difficult to verify by judges. In fact,\nstandard debt contracts do not make repayments dependent on the aggregate state\nof the economy nor let they firms generate observable profits only during recessions.\nNonetheless, note that the theoretical results developed here are somewhat in line\nwith responses to the survey by Graham and Harvey (2001). In particular, in the\nsurvey financial executives cited the 'cost of refinancing in bad times' as the second\nmost important factor affecting their debt maturity choice. Refinancing in bad times\nshould be more expensive (or even not possible) because a good firm would have to\ncompensate investors for being unable to distinguish it from bad firms. Similarly, in\nthe previous discussion good firms wanted to avoid repayment in bad times as they\nwould have to compensate investors for information being asymmetric.\n3 Firms' Choice among Standard Debt Instruments\nIn this section I focus on standard debt instruments where the firm's repayment\ndoes not depend on the state of the economy. More specifically, the firm can now\nchoose between issuing long-term bonds or short-term bonds, using banking finance\nor issuing commercial paper together with securing a backup line of credit.\nLong-term bonds. For the firm to issue long-term bonds it has to ensure that\ndirect investors' expected return is at least equal to their opportunity cost of pro-\nviding finance, i.e.\nRLT + (1 - )[RLT\nH\n\nc .\nor\nwhere RLT is the long-term (gross) interest rate. Note that RLT > 1 as long as\n < 1, i.e. as long as there is asymmetric information present (otherwise, very intu-\nitively, RLT = 1). In addition, for RLT > 1 there must be a positive probability of\na recession occurring for otherwise the return of all firms would be H with certainty.\nShort-term bonds. With short-term bonds investors are given the opportunity to\nrethink their investment decision at t = 1 upon the arrival of new information, i.e.\nthey are effectively given an option to liquidate the firm at this date. Due to the\nunderlying assumptions11 short-term debt will never be rolled over at t = 1 since in\nthe presence of asymmetric information the investor is always better off liquidating\nthe firm. In order to determine the short-term interest rates first note that the\ninterest rate between dates 1 and 2 in the good state, RST\n, must be 1 as there is\nno credit risk in this period. Hence the interest rate between dates 0 and 1, RST\n, is\ngiven by\nRST\n+ (1 - )[RST\nor\nRST\n=\nfor RST\n> L borrowing short-term is cheaper than borrowing\nlong-term, i.e. RST  RST\n< RLT , provided there is asymmetric\ninformation ( < 1). There is thus a very simple explanation for the long-term\ninterest rate being higher than the short-term interest rate. The long-term investor\nhas to be compensated for a lower profit outcome at date t = 2 in case of continuation\nduring a recession. Note that the difference between the long-term and the short-\nterm interest rate increases with  falling (i.e. (RLT - RST )/ < 0). This means\n+ (1 - )AL\n.\n> AL\nthe firm just pays back its liquidation value in case of recession.\nthat the higher the degree of asymmetric information, the wider the interest rate\nspread.\nFor ST finance to be actually preferred by a good firm it is necessary that the\ncost of using LT debt outweighs its benefit, i.e. RLT -RST > (1-)[H +B -AH].\nPlugging the derived values for RST , RLT into this inequality we get13\n <  =\nAL\n- L\n- (H + B - AH)\nAL\n- L + (1 - )(H + B - AH)\nBanking. A bank that extended a loan at t = 0 and engaged in screening ac-\ntivity is assumed to know a given firm's type at date t = 1. A bank is therefore\nable to make the right continuation versus liquidation decision, i.e. it liquidates bad\nfirms and continues good firms. The interest rate on bank lending is therefore given\nby\nRB =\nFor pure banking finance to have a potential role, it must be that RB < RLT .\nOtherwise the good firm would always be able to complete its project at lower cost.\nThis is equivalent to\nwhich means that the extra cost of bank lending (i.e. the screening cost) has to be\nlower than the extra benefit of using it.\nHowever, given that direct investors are always willing to extent credit between\ndates 0 and 1, bank borrowing (and screening) is actually not needed during this\nperiod. Banking finance may be needed at t = 1 in case of recession when direct\ninvestors are unwilling to roll over short-term loans. As a prerequisite for lending\nat this stage, however, the bank needs to verify in a timely manner that the firm is\nof good type. As has been pointed out, this is only possible if the bank engaged in\n13For the following critical  to be greater than 0 we further require  < (AL\n-L\n)/(H\n).\na relationship at t = 0 with the firm, such as a commitment to lend on a contingent\nbasis in return for a fee. For firms, lending on a contingent basis may be an attrac-\ntive option as they only need to compensate banks for screening in the recessionary\nstate and not for screening in the good state when it is actually not needed.\nMixed finance: Commercial Paper and Backup Line of Credit. If banking\nis not too costly and the firm is given the option it might use direct finance in nor-\nmal, i.e. non-recessionary, states of the economy and banking finance in recessionary\nstates. However, for banking finance to actually play a superior role in recessionary\nstates banks in the model have to commit to lend on a contingent basis, thereby\nengaging in a relationship with the firm at t = 0.\nIn practice, most commercial paper issuers maintain backup liquidity through\nbank lines of credit. These are often being structured as multi-year revolver agree-\nments in which a bank commits to loan funds to a firm on demand at a floating base\nrate that is tied to the prime rate, LIBOR rate, or certificate of deposit rate. As com-\npensation, the bank receives various fees from the firm. In particular, banks often\nreceive a commitment fee that is a percentage of the unused credit line.14 In what\nfollows I will look at this financing arrangement in the context of the stated model.\nFor simplicity, I assume that the firm either uses the total amount of the funds\ncommitted by the bank or nothing at all. Furthermore, the (gross) rate charged in\ncase of recession is assumed to equal the rate charged under direct finance (which\nwas normalized to 1).\nThe commitment fee F that the bank requires the firm to pay is then given by\nF + (1 - )[ + (1 - )AL\nor\nF =\n- ]\n\n14Alternatively, the firm pays a facility fee that is a percentage of the credit line and is paid\nwhether or not the line is activated.\nThe expected total cost for the firm to finance its project now becomes (1 - )[1 +\nc - (1 - )AL\n- ] + 1. Note that the good firm's project will now be refinanced at\nt = 1 with certainty.\nProposition 1: Faced with different financing options, a good firm that wants\nto continue its project in case of recession will prefer using mixed finance to issuing\nlong-term bonds whenever the degree of asymmetric information is sufficiently high.\nProof: See the appendix.\nNote that if there was no asymmetric information in the economy, the good\nfirm would always prefer to issue long-term debt as long as using banking finance is\nmore costly, i.e. as long as c > 0. Interestingly, the good firm's payment in normal\ntimes, i.e. 1 + F, is higher than its payment in bad times which simply equals 1.\nWith this form of financing the firm therefore comes closer to the optimal financing\narrangement in the state contingent contract case.\n4 Publicly observable Credit Risk\nThe preceding section focused on firms with projects that are riskless in normal\ntimes. In this section I broaden the analysis to include firms that differ in the\nobservable riskiness of their projects.15 More specifically, projects now generate a\nverifiable return H at t = 2 with probability p (and L with probability 1 - p)\nsubject to continuation at t = 1.16 The success probability p is publicly observable\nand can be thought of as a credit rating. Projects again generate a private benefit\nB > 0, which entrepreneurs obtain at t = 2 if the firm is not liquidated.\nFirms within a given risk class (defined by p) differ in the way their projects are\n15A numerical example for purposes of illustration is available from the author upon request.\n16Obviously, the previous section can be considered a special case with p = 1 in this more general\nsetting.\naffected by a recession. Some projects are unaffected and still return pH +(1-p)L\nin expected value terms whereas others return only L at t = 2 with certainty. The\nprobability pR\n{0, 1} of the firm's project being affected by a recession is again\ninformation private to the firm at t = 0 and revealed to a bank at t = 1 only if the\nbank set up a relationship with the firm at t = 0. Direct investors or banks without\na relationship learn about the firm's type at t = 1 only if the firm is liquidated.\nQuite intuitively, the liquidation value of a good firm - like the expected return at\ndate 2 - now depends on the firm's credit rating and is given by A(p) = pAH. By\ncontrast, the liquidation value of a bad firm, AL, is for simplicity assumed to be\nindependent of the firm's credit rating.17\nAs in the previous section, lenders believe that a given firm is of type pR = 1\nwith probability  and pR = 0 with probability 1- so that E[pR] = .18 To simplify\nthe ongoing analysis I will further set L = 0.\n[Figure 2 about here.]\n4.1 Financing Options\nLong-term direct finance. When buying long-term debt investors have to wait\nuntil date 2 to realize returns and hence do not have the opportunity to react to\nnew information being revealed at date 1. Direct investors are therefore willing to\nprovide long-term finance as long as\nalso ensures that good firms with a low success probability do not get funding just\nbecause they will be liquidated at t = 1. Making the liquidation value of bad firms also dependent\non the credit rating unnecessarily burdens the analysis.\n18For simplicity I assume that lenders' prior belief about the value of pR\nis independent of the\nfirm's credit rating. Firms with a lower credit rating may well have a higher proportion of firms\naffected by a recession, in which case  would be a decreasing function of p. However, this unnec-\nessarily burdens the analysis.\nor\nRLT (p) =\np[ + (1 - )]\nwhere RLT (p) < H is the long-term interest rate. The required repayment in\ncase of success is thus determined by the firm's credit rating p and, as before, the\ndegree of asymmetric information  and the probability of the economy being in\na good state . A higher credit rating, less asymmetric information, and a higher\nprobability of a good state all lead to a lower individual interest rate.\nThe expected repayment of a good firm (i.e. one whose project return will be\nunaffected by a recession) is then given by\npRLT (p) =\nwhich is greater than 1 whenever information is asymmetric ( < 1) and equal to 1\nwhenever information is symmetric ( = 1). Good firms' expected repayment under\nasymmetric information surpasses investors' investment contribution because they\nhave to cross-subsidize bad firms whose expected repayment is less than 1. Bad\nfirms always imitate good firms because otherwise they would not receive funding\nand would thus be unable to receive the private benefit B.\nShort-term direct finance. By lending short-term the investor is given the oppor-\ntunity to rethink his investment decision at t = 1 upon the arrival of new information,\ni.e. he is given the option to liquidate a firm's project. Under certain assumptions\nabout the degree of asymmetric information being present the investor will exercise\nhis liquidation option whenever the economy is in a recession and abstain from doing\nso whenever it is in a good state.\nProposition 2: An uninformed investor who provided short-term funding to a\nfirm at t = 0 will always roll over the firm's debt at t = 1 when the economy\nis in a good state. He will not roll over the firm's debt when the economy is in\na recession provided the degree of asymmetric information is sufficiently high, i.e.\nH\n, AL\nH\nProof: See the appendix.\nIn what follows I assume that asymmetric information is sufficiently high so that\nuninformed short-term investors will not roll over the firm's debt in a recession. In\nthe context of the model the short-term interest rate between dates 1 and 2, RST\n(p),\nis then simply 1/p as lending in this period only takes place in the good state of\nthe economy and the firm's interest rate is determined by its individual success\nprobability. The short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1, RST\n(p), is then\nimplicitly defined by\n(p)RST\n(p) + (1 - )[ min{RST\n(p), pAH\nfor all RST\n(p)/p < H. Note in particular that in a recession a good firm pays\nback RST\n(p) as long as this is less or equal to the firm's liquidation value pAH.\n(p) > pAH the firm just pays back its liquidation value. The interest rate\ntherefore displays a kink at the critical probability level pk defined by RST\n(p) =\npkAH. More specifically, the short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1 for\ndifferent values of the firm's credit rating p is given by\nRST\n(p) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np  pk\n\n[1 - (1 - )(pAH + (1 - )AL)] p < pk\nNo ST funding available p < pST\nAH [+(1-)]\nis the probability value at which the short-term interest\nrate displays a kink and pST = 1-(1-)(1-)AL\nis the critical value below which\ninvestors are unwilling to lend short-term.19 It is obvious that pST < pk as H\n> AH\n19The maximum repayment a firm is able to offer over the two periods is H\nso that the minimum\ncredit rating for which financing is still possible is implicitly defined by H\n(pST )\u00b7RST\n(pST ).\nNote that the good firm actually has two short-term interest options to choose from as long as\nso that the short-term interest rate will always exhibit a kink for the relevant range\nof p.\nProvided an investor receives a higher return during a recession by liquidating a\nfirm's project, the long-term interest rate lies above the cumulative short-term rate\nover two periods. Quite intuitively, the firm has to compensate investors for a lower\nprofit outcome in case of continuation in the bad state by pledging a higher return\nin the good state.\nLemma 1: As long as it is optimal for a short-term investor to liquidate a firm\nduring a recession, the cumulative short-term interest rate over two periods lies be-\nlow the long-term rate for all firms with credit rating p > pLT .\nProof: See the appendix.\nNote that for the short-term rate to lie below the long-term rate it is crucial that\nthere is a sufficiently high degree of asymmetric information. If information were\nsymmetric (or marginally asymmetric) an investor would always roll over a firm's\ndebt in a recession. Hence, in this case the short-term rate would equal the long-\nterm rate. From the discussion above it should also be clear that there are some\nfirms with credit rating p < pLT for which short-term borrowing is the only available\nfinancing option. Since at pLT the short-term interest rate is strictly less than the\nmaximum pledgeable income in the good state (which is H) by continuity there\nare some firms with credit rating p < pLT (and p > pST ) that can pledge enough\nincome to secure short-term financing. Quite crucially, these firms are restricted to\nborrow short-term and cannot borrow long-term. By contrast, firms with success\nprobability p > pLT can choose between long-term and short-term borrowing.\nRST\n(p) < pAH\n: It may pay the same return in the good and the bad state of the economy or it\nmay pledge its full liquidation value in the bad state and pay a lower return in the good state. It\nis easy to verify that the firm always prefers the first option and pays the same return in the good\nand the bad state whenever this is possible.\nIn what follows I assume that all firms that have the option to choose between\nthe two financing modes prefer long-term financing. In effect, this means that the\nutility of using LT finance outweighs the utility of using ST finance for all firms with\ncredit rating p > pLT or\np[H\n- RLT (p)] + B > [pH\nfor all p with pLT < p < pk and\np[H\n- RLT (p)] + B > [p(H\n- RST (p)) + B] + (1 - )[pAH\nfor all p > pk.20 This basically means that the private benefit B that firms receive\nat t = 2 in case of project continuation is large enough to make them choose the\nlong-term financing option whenever this is possible. By inspection, it is obvious\nthat there always exists such a B so that all firms prefer the long-term option.\nCP + Backup line of credit. Instead of long-term finance the firm may use\nshort-term direct finance together with a backup line of credit. The important\nthing to keep in mind is that backup lines of credit are not credit enhancements.\nIf a company goes bankrupt, the bank will not pay off its maturing CP. They are\ntherefore not an insurance against a deterioration in the firm's credit quality but\nan insurance against a rollover crisis in the CP market. If the CP market dries up,\na backup line allows an issuer whose credit quality has not changed to substitute\nbank borrowing for CP borrowing. For backup lines to play any role it must there-\nfore be that information becomes symmetric between banks and firms at t = 2 but\nremains asymmetric between direct investors and firms (otherwise direct investors\nwould always refinance good firms). However, note that information between banks\nand firms cannot already be symmetric at t = 1. Otherwise by offering credit only\nto good firms on slightly more attractive terms than direct investors banks would\n20Notice that it is not sufficient to just focus on the first equation as the RHS of the second\nequation is higher than the RHS of the first equation for all p < pk.\ncapture all good firms while bad firms would turn to direct finance. Under these\ncircumstances, the market for direct debt would break down.\nWhenever there is a recession a bank that has committed to a backup line thus\npays direct investors the firm's promised short-term rate RST\n(p) at t = 1 if the firm\nhas been identified as good. Whenever the firm is revealed as bad banks invoke the\n'material adverse change clause'. The investor is then left with the firm's liquidation\nvalue AL. Implicitly, I assume that enforceability of contracts is not an issue. The\nbank always refinances a good firm in a recession even if it will make a loss. In the\ncontext of the model this is quite plausible as every firm can be perfectly identified\nafter either liquidation or continuation and thus every breach of contract is publicly\nobservable.\nThe uninformed short-term investor's required return is then given by:\nRST\n+ (1 - )[RST\nor\nRST\n=\n + (1 - ).\nBy comparison, this is simply the short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1\nthat applies to all firms with credit rating p > pk. However, in the present case this\ninterest rate may even apply to firms with a credit rating below pk as good firms'\nprojects will always be continued and their maximum repayment in a recession will\ntherefore be higher than their liquidation value pAH. The maximum interest rate\n(or lowest credit rating for which short-term finance together with a backup line is\nstill available) is now determined by what the firm can pay in the good state taking\ninto account the fee it has to pay for the backup line of credit. In the context of the\nmodel the firm always prefers a commitment fee that is a percentage of the unused\ncredit line to a facility fee that is a percentage of the credit line and is paid whether\nor not the line is activated.21 This is so because the firm wants to avoid asymmetric\ninformation costs that it has to pay during a recession. For simplicity, I assume that\n21Of course, a firm that is unable to pay the full commitment fee (plus the short-term interest rate\nthe firm either uses the total amount of the funds committed by the bank or nothing\nat all.\nQuite crucially, banks' screening costs are now assumed to be decreasing in the\nfirm's probability of success p, i.e. c(p) = c + 1 - p.22 Screening costs may actually\nbe lower for higher rated companies as these firms are often active in more mature\nindustries and often have more transparent business models. Banks therefore may\nfind it less costly to determine whether or not these firms' prospects have been\nseverely impacted by an impending recession.\nGiven that bank borrowing costs are decreasing in p, the commitment fee that\nthe bank charges in the good state is defined by\nF(p) + (1 - )  RST\n- (1 + c(p))RST\nor\nF(p) = \u00af\nc(p)RST\nwith \u00af\n\n.\nIn the good state the bank receives the commitment fee F(p) at t = 1 from all\nfirms whose projects have been successful, independent of whether the particular\nfirm is good or bad.23 In a recession the bank receives the cumulative short-term\ninterest rate at t = 2 only from good firms with successful projects. In this state of\nthe economy, the bank pays direct investors who invested in a good firm the short-\nterm interest rate at t = 1 for which it incurs total costs of 1 + c(p) per unit at\nbetween dates 0 and 1 and both multiplied by 1/p) may, in principle, prefer paying some fee also in\nthe bad state to issuing long-term direct debt. However, for a sufficiently high cost of using banking\nfinance firms with a credit rating that would permit both sorts of finance nonetheless prefer direct\ndebt. Hence the assumption that firms may only pay a commitment fee is not overly restrictive in\nthe context of the model.\n22Obviously, for p = 1 the screening cost is simply c, as in the previous section when there was\nno publicly observable credit risk on the part of the firm.\n23One may think of a firm taking up another short-term loan at t = 1 of size F(p) and promising\nto repay 1/p \u00b7 F(p) at t = 2.\nFirms are able to issue commercial paper and secure a backup line of credit as\nlong as their required repayment at t = 2 is less or equal to the maximum amount\nthey can pledge, i.e. H. The lowest credit rating for which this financing option is\navailable is hence given by\nRST\n+ F pCP /pCP = H (34)\nor\npCP =\nRST\n+ \u00af\n(1 + c)RST\nH + \u00af\nRST\nIt is obvious that banking must not be too costly for otherwise no firm would be able\nto finance itself by issuing CP and securing a backup line of credit.24 Furthermore,\nfirms that are able to choose this financing form are also able to choose long-term\ndirect finance.\nLemma 2: Provided that H is large enough, firms with a credit rating that allows\nfor CP + CL financing are also able to use long-term direct finance, i.e. pCP > pLT .\nProof: See the appendix.\nFrom this it is obvious that there may be some firms who would actually prefer\nissuing CP together with securing a backup line but are, in fact, restricted to issue\nlong-term debt. However, it may also be the case that all firms prefer LT debt, even\nthose with virtually no default risk who are able to issue CP.\n4.2 Firms' Choice between Long-term Direct Debt and CP with\nBackup Line of Credit\nObviously, if bank lending did not entail extra costs, i.e. c(p) = 0, and information\nwas asymmetric, all firms with p > pCP would choose to issue commercial paper\n24The upper limit for c so that only firms with the highest credit rating (i.e. p = 1) will choose\nCP + CL can be derived by setting pCP = 1 in (35) and solving for c.\nand secure a backup line of credit at t = 0 and switch to bank borrowing in case\nof recession at t = 1.25 Their expected total cost would then be RST\n(p) which is\nstrictly less than the expected total cost of issuing long-term direct debt, pRLT (p).\nIn fact, there would not even be a role for commercial paper as investors would be\nequally well off borrowing from banks between dates 0 and 1.\nBy contrast, if bank borrowing did entail extra costs but information was sym-\nmetric, a good firm would never choose to issue CP and secure a backup line of\ncredit as it would be a costlier option without any extra benefit. However, the firm\nwould be indifferent between long-term and short-term direct finance (as short-term\nfinance would always be rolled over). By the same reasoning, if bank borrowing was\ncostless and information was symmetric, firms would be indifferent between all three\nfinancing options.\nAs a consequence, for firms to prefer different long-term financing arrangements\ninformation needs to be asymmetric and bank borrowing must entail extra costs.\nQuite intuitively, when considering the two long-term options firms face a trade-off:\nBy using direct finance they incur asymmetric information costs but not bank bor-\nrowing costs. By issuing CP plus a backup line of credit they incur bank borrowing\ncosts but possibly lower asymmetric information costs. As bank borrowing costs are\nlower when a firm's success probability is higher, there is a critical credit rating above\nwhich all firms prefer to issue CP together with securing a backup line of credit. To\ndetermine this critical level note that firms prefer issuing CP together with securing\na backup line whenever their expected cost is lower than issuing long-term debt or\nRST\n25If bank lending does not entail extra costs the commitment fee that the bank charges, F(p), is\nzero, independent of the firm's credit rating. The lowest credit rating at which this financing option\nis still possible is then less or equal to the lowest credit rating at which long-term direct finance is\npossible, i.e. pCP = 1-(1-)(1-)AL\n= pLT .\nwhich is equivalent to\np  1 + c -\n pCP\n\nFor some firms to actually choose this financing arrangement it is necessary that\nthese firms are both able and willing to issue CP and secure backup liquidity.\nProposition 3: For some c  0 there are some firms with credit rating p < 1\nthat choose to be financed by issuing CP together with securing a backup line of\ncredit.\nProof: See the appendix.\nGiven Lemma 2 and Proposition 3 the firm's theoretically derived debt maturity\nchoice - which is broadly consistent with observed practice - is illustrated in figure\n[Figure 3 about here.]\nFirms of the highest credit quality choose to issue CP together with a backup line\nof credit. Firms of slightly lower credit quality prefer (or are restricted) to issue\nlong-term bonds. Finally, firms of even lower credit quality are restricted to issue\nshort-term bonds.26 Note that the focus of the analysis has been firms with a credit\n26One might wonder why bad firms with a high credit rating do not use short-term finance only\n(without a backup line of credit). They would thereby be able to obtain the same effective financing\narrangement, i.e. short term finance in the first period and short term finance in the second period\nif the economy is in a good state and no finance in the second period if the economy is in a bad\nstate. However, they would not have to pay the commitment fee for the provision of the backup\nline of credit and would therefore be better off.\nThis is so because firms have to have a (publicly observable) credit rating to be able to tap public\ndebt markets. If a firm with a high rating wants to issue a short-term bond without securing a\nbackup line of credit it signals that it is a bad firm. But then it does not receive any financing at\nall. It hence prefers to secure a backup line and to pool with good firms of the same high rating\ncategory.\nrating high enough to issue direct debt. In the context of the model, banks just have\na screening role. To explain bank lending for lower rated companies (below pST )\nbanks would also need to improve profitability somehow to make lending worthwhile.\n5 Comparative Statics\nThe total volume of US nonfinancial firms' outstanding CP peaked at USD 351 bn\nin November 2000 and declined by more than 70 percent until it reached a nadir\nin December 2003. Since then the market has recovered strongly. However, as of\nNovember 2007 outstanding CP remains about 50 percent below its peak in the fall of\n2000. Relative to historical patterns, the decline has been unusually pronounced. As\ndocumented by Shen (2003) in the previous five episodes of recession-related market\nshrinkage, the largest reduction in volume outstanding was about 27 percent.\nHow may the model help to explain these developments? In general, the model\npredicts that if the economy enters a recession short-term finance will not be rolled\nover by direct investors. Firms with a low credit rating and bad firms with a high\ncredit rating will thus be liquidated during bad times. However, good firms with\na high rating are able to replace short-term direct finance with short-term bank\nlending if they secured a backup line of credit ex ante. Overall, we should therefore\nobserve a decrease in short-term direct finance during recessions and an increase in\nshort-term bank lending ceteris paribus. However, besides cyclical factors structural\nfactors may also influence the amount of direct finance outstanding and may alter\nthe critical credit ratings at which firms choose different financing options. In what\nfollows I consider an increase in the probability that the economy is in the good\nstate (which for obvious reasons I call 'Great Moderation'). Furthermore, I will look\nat how an increase in computing power and wider availability of information ('IT\nRevolution') alters firms' debt maturity choice in the context of the model.\nAn increase in the probability of the economy being in the good state, , means\nthat the economy is less likely to enter a recession where some firms generate a\nreturn of zero with certainty. Hence at any given credit rating a firm of unknown\ntype has a higher overall success probability. The interest rate for any given credit\nrating should therefore be lower. However, it is then obvious that at the lowest\ncredit rating at which short-term direct finance was previously possible, the firm's\nmaximum pledgeable income, H, lies above the total interest the firm is expected\nto pay over the two periods. Hence, a firm with a slightly lower credit rating will\nstill have enough pledgeable income to be financed via short-term direct debt. As\na consequence, a higher  will lead to an increase in direct lending to higher risk\nfirms (or equivalently to a lower pST ). What happens to the amount of CP issued\ntogether with a backup line of credit? Certainly, the expected cost of this financ-\ning arrangement, RST\n+ F(p), falls when  rises. But so does the expected cost\nof long-term direct finance, pRLT . In fact, it turns out that the expected cost of\nlong-term direct finance falls even more strongly so that issuing CP together with a\ncredit line becomes less attractive and pCP\n\nincreases.\nProposition 4: If the economy becomes less likely to experience a recession, inter-\nest rates and the bank's commitment fee for any given credit rating decline. More\nfirms are able to use direct finance, i.e. pST decreases, and fewer firms issue CP\ntogether with securing a credit line ex ante, i.e. pCP\n\nincreases.\nProof: See the appendix.\nI next turn to the impact of information becoming more easily available. This,\nin particular, may be associated with lower costs of computing power, improved\nsoftware, and, above all, the better accessibility of information via the Internet. In\nthe context of the model, the 'IT revolution' may have affected two important pa-\nrameters with different consequences for the total amount of direct finance being\nissued and firms' choice of financing arrangements.\nOn the one hand, it may have lowered banks' screening costs, resulting in a\nlower c, which, in turn, would have led to a lower cost of providing backup lines of\ncredit, F(p). More firms would then be able and willing to issue CP and secure a\nbackup line of credit. CP issuance should therefore have gone up over the last two\ndecades ceteris paribus. On the other hand, better accessibility of information at\nlower cost should have made it easier for direct investors to identify bad firms. As\na consequence, the share of bad firms obtaining finance should have declined, or,\nequivalently, information should have become more symmetric, i.e.  should have\nincreased. Ceteris paribus, an increase in  leads to more firms being able to obtain\ndirect finance and to more long-term direct finance being issued (partly at the ex-\npense of CP being issued together with a backup line of credit).\nProposition 5: If information becomes more symmetric, i.e.  increases, some\nfirms of lower credit quality that were previously denied credit are now able use di-\nrect finance. Furthermore, more long-term direct finance and less CP will be issued.\nProof: See the appendix.\nIn sum, the model suggests that while there will always be a decrease in CP is-\nsuance during bad times, structural factors (e.g. a lower probability of a recession\nand/or more symmetric information) may lead firms of the highest credit quality to\nissue fewer CP even in good times. The reason is that the total cost for this long-\nterm financing arrangement (i.e. also taking into account the cost of the backup\nline of credit) may not decrease as much as the cost of just issuing long-term direct\ndebt. These structural changes may therefore help to explain why the market for\nnonfinancial CP has remained far below its former peak level despite a strong in-\ncrease in risk tolerance and a marked upturn in credit quality up until the summer\n6 Discussion and Conclusion\nThe simple model developed here generates qualitative predictions about the equi-\nlibrium in debt markets that appear broadly consistent with some stylized facts.\nFirms of the highest credit quality issue commercial paper and secure backup lines\nof credit ex ante. During periods when public credit markets prove unreceptive,\nbanks often experience an increase in asset growth due to a drawdown of credit lines\nby firms as documented in Gatev and Strahan (2006). The model stresses that this is\npart of intended financing arrangement whereby high quality firms use direct finance\nduring 'normal' times when asymmetric information between lenders and the firm\ndoes not matter and use intermediated finance when asymmetric information does\nmatter. Short-term finance then provides the necessary flexibility to adjust to chang-\ning economic circumstances. In this sense, financial systems naturally become more\n'bank-based' during recessionary episodes and more 'market-based' during normal\nIn practice, only firms of the highest credit quality opt for this financing ar-\nrangement. Firms of slightly lower quality choose long-term direct finance instead.\nThe model claims that good firms of less than top quality prefer long-term direct\ndebt not because of the longer maturity since by issuing CP (and securing a backup\nline) they are not at risk of refinancing either. Rather, for these firms contingent\nbank lending becomes too expensive and therefore unattractive. Finally, firms of\nstill lower credit quality are restricted to borrow short-term since they do not have\nenough pledgeable income to borrow long-term. Studies of large firms with access\nto public securities markets support the view that a firm's debt maturity increases\nas its credit rating falls, at least until its credit rating becomes speculative. They\nalso find that firms without a credit rating typically use more short-term debt.28\nThe model identifies structural factors that may explain why the nonfinancial\n27This in a way differs from the widely held view that financial systems are either bank- or market\nbased.\ncommercial paper has shrunk since the start of the decade. In particular, better\naccessibility of information ('IT revolution') may have led to information between\ndirect investors and the firm having become more symmetric. Furthermore, the\nprobability of recessions may have decreased ('Great Moderation'). Both factors\nshould have contributed to CP being a less attractive financing option today.\nIt should be noted that the model just focuses on firms on the lower end of\nthe credit risk spectrum, i.e. firms that have a credit rating and are able to tap\nbond markets. More risky firms, by contrast, typically borrow from banks or from\nfinance companies rather than by selling bonds to the public. Banks may play quite\na different role for these borrowers. In particular, they may not just screen firms but\nmay also engage in close monitoring and may thereby lower individual credit risk.\nFurthermore, the applicability of the model to other parts of the commercial\npaper market appears somewhat limited. In particular, the rollover crisis in the\nmarket for asset-backed commercial paper in the second half of 2007 appears difficult\nto reconcile with the notion of an intended financing arrangement. Instead, banks\nmay have been overly optimistic about liquidity in this part of the commercial paper\nin general. Or they may have used this financing arrangement to extend lending\nwithout incurring a capital charge29 ('regulatory arbitrage') and relying on central\nbank liquidity if liquidity demands prove too high ('moral hazard'). Further research\nabout this part of the CP market is certainly needed.\n29Under Basel I banks do not have to hold capital against backup lines of credits.\n7 Appendix\nProof of Proposition 1\nFor a good firm to issue CP along with securing a backup line of credit instead of\nissuing long-term bonds it must be that the cost of long-term finance is higher than\nthe cost of mixed finance, i.e.\n= L +\nSolving for  we obtain:\n>\nz\ny\n+\nx\n-\nx\n< -\nz\ny\n+\nx\n-\nx\nwith x = 1 - L + (AL\n- 1) + (1 - )(1 + c - AL), y = (1 - )(AL\n- (1 + c - AL).\nNote that for a solution we also require that either 1 or 2 lie in the interval\nbetween 0 and 1. Since -x/2y > 1 the only possible solution to the inequality is\n2. Define the critical level of asymmetric information by c = - z\ny\n+ x\n- x\n.\nThen as long as  < c good firms will prefer to issue CP along with securing a\nbackup line of credit instead of issuing long-term bonds. Q.E.D.\nProof of Proposition 2\nThe first part follows straight from the firm's liquidation value function. Given that\nthe continuation value of a firm in the good state is pH, the sufficient condition\nfor an investor to roll over a firm's debt is30: pH\n> pAH + (1 - )AL which is\nequivalent to\np >\nH\n- AH\n30It is not a necessary condition as a firm's project might be continued even if its continuation\nvalue is below its liquidation value as long as the continuation value is  1.\nSince the RHS of this inequality is a decreasing function of  we simply have to\nprove that for  = 0 or p = AL\n/H the firm is unable to get short-term funding.\nWe thereby insure that for all relevant values of p (i.e. those at which financing\ntakes place) the firm's continuation value is higher than its liquidation value. To\nsee this simply note that for p = AL\n/H the continuation value of a firm in nor-\nmal times is AL\nH\nH = AL\n< 1 and the liquidation value of an unknown firm is\nH\nAH + (1 - )AL\n< 1. Hence no matter whether he refinances or liquidates\nthe firm at the interim stage the investor is unable to recoup his initial investment.\nHe thus refrains from financing the firm at t = 0. Q.E.D.\nTo prove the second part it is necessary to show that in a recession the contin-\nuation value of a firm of unknown type is 1) less than the initial investment re-\n< 1, and also 2) less than the firm's liquidation value, i.e.\npH\n< pAH + (1 - )AL. It is easy to see that as long as   1/H condition\n1) is fulfilled, regardless of the firm's credit rating p. Furthermore condition 2) is\nfulfilled as long as\np <\n(H\n- AH)\nHence, whenever   AL\nH\n< 1 the firm's liquidation value is higher than its\ncontinuation value, regardless of its credit rating. As a result, in a recession a firm of\nunknown type will be liquidated whenever   min 1\nH\n, AL\nH\n< 1. Q.E.D.\nProof of Lemma 1\nFor firms with credit ratings p > pk the cumulative short-term rate over two periods\nlies below the long-term rate whenever\np[ + (1 - )]\n<\np[ + (1 - )]\nwhich is obviously true for all p.\n31Otherwise the investor would always be able to recoup his initial investment contribution and\nthus would never liquidate the project.\nFor firms with credit rating p, pLT < p < pk, the short-term interest rate is given\np\n. Rewrite the investor's participation constraint for\nproviding long-term finance to get\np\nAs pAH +(1-)AL\n> pH\n pRLT for all   min 1\nH\n, AL\nH\nthe short\nterm interest rate lies below the long-term rate for all p with pLT < p < pk . Q.E.D.\nProof of Lemma 2\nTo see that issuing long-term direct finance is always possible for a firm able to issue\nCP together with securing a backup line of credit provided that H is large enough\nfirst note that if pCP > pLT for c = 0 then it also holds for c > 0. For c = 0 rewrite\npCP > pLT to get\nH\n-\n>\nNow, assume that the above statement was not true. Then even for the largest pos-\nsible value of H the inequality would not hold true. H is bounded above by the\n'no rollover' condition, i.e. H\n\nthe above inequality simplifies\nto AL\n< 1 which is true by assumption. Hence, for H large enough pCP > pLT .\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Proposition 3\nTo prove that under the given assumptions some firms will actually choose to be\nfinanced via CP + CL, it is necessary to show that for some c > 0 1) some firms\nwith credit rating p < 1 are able to use CP + CL and 2) some firms with credit\nrating p < 1 prefer using CP + CL to issuing long-term direct debt.\nTo prove the first part it is necessary to show that p\nCP\n< 1 for some c > 0 or\nRST\n\n(1 + c)RST\n\nRST\nFor c = 0, it is obvious that this inequality holds true as RST\n< H. However, then,\nby continuity, it must also hold true for c slightly above 0. Q.E.D.\nThe second part is true as long as p\nCP\nAgain, for c = 0, it is obvious that this inequality holds as long as AL\nthen, again, by continuity, it must also hold for c slightly above 0. Q.E.D.\nProof of Proposition 4\nIt is straightforward to show that RLT (p), RST\n(p) for p  pk, and F(p) all fall in .\nIn addition, RST\n(p) for pST  p < pk also falls in  as long as pAH +(1-)AL\nwhich is the case for p = pk and hence also for all p < pk.\nTurning to the critical credit ratings, it is straightforward to show that pCP\n\nincreases in . Furthermore, the lowest credit rating at which short-term direct\nfinance is still available, pST , falls with  increasing as long as\n <\nH\nAH\nIt is obvious that the RHS is larger than 1 as H\n> AH by assumption and the\nrestriction is therefore not binding. Hence, pST also falls in . Q.E.D.\nProof of Proposition 5\nIt is straightforward to show that pLT falls and pCP\n\nrises in . In addition, pST falls\nin  as long as\n <\nAH\n- AL\nAH\nALH\n- AL\nAH\nHowever, we know that bad firms are not worth financing, i.e. H +(1-)AL+B <\n1, which is equivalent to\n <\n- B\nH\n- AL\nNo matter what value B assumes  cannot exceed 1-AL\nH\n. However, this is less than\nthe restriction required for pST to fall in . Hence, pST always falls in . Q.E.D.\nReferences\nBarclay, M. J., and C. W.
