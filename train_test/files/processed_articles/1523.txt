Although population-based studies of\naging are increasingly collecting biological measures to ex-\nplore social-physiological hypotheses about health (Lindau\n& McDade, 2007), NSHAP is unique in its collection of sex\nhormonal data for this purpose. Conducted between July\nself-administered salivary specimen collection to begin to\nexplore the relationship between sex hormone status, rela-\ntionships, and health in later life.\nSex hormonal evaluation in the clinical setting is typically\nperformed on a serum or plasma specimen (Kaufman &\nVermeulen, 2005) and can provide information about total\nand free circulating sex hormones. This involves an invasive\nprocedure (venipuncture). Most steroid hormones in blood\nare bound to specific proteins (e.g., sex hormone\u00adbinding\nglobulin [SHBG]).A tiny fraction (less than 5%) of nonbound\nor free fraction of sex hormone accounts for actual sex hor-\nmone activity at the tissue level. Free sex hormone molecules\nare small relative to their bound, protein\u00adsteroid complex;\nwhen free, these molecules can penetrate small membranes\nsuch as those found in the salivary gland. Salivary sex hor-\nmone measures quantify free, or bioactive, sex hormone con-\ncentration (Lu, Bentley, Gann, Hodges, & Chatterton, 1999;\nWorthman, Stallings, & Hofman, 1990). Salivary measures of-\nfer a relatively convenient and minimally invasive approach\nfor obtaining sex hormone data (Granger, Shirtcliff, Booth,\nWorthman et al., 1990)--an advantage when working with\nolder, infirm, and/or population-based health study partici-\npants. Saliva specimens can be self-collected and safely han-\ndled by lay personnel (Granger et al., 2007).\nThe methods used for, correlates of cooperation with, and\nvalidity of in-home salivary specimens collected from older\nadults in NSHAP are described.\nBackground\nSex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,\nDHEA) derive from the precursor cholesterol (Greenspan &\nGardner, 2001) and play an important role in human physi-\nology throughout the life course. Estrogens are more preva-\nlent in women of reproductive age compared with men and\nare responsible for development of female secondary sex\ncharacteristics. Three major estrogens are found naturally in\nthe human body: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3),\nSalivary Sex Hormone Measurement in a National,\nPopulation-Based Study of Older Adults\nNatalia Gavrilova1,2 and Stacy Tessler Lindau1,2,3\n1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chicago, Illinois.\n2Center on Demography and Economics of Aging Core on Biomarkers in Population-Based Health and\nAging Research, NORC (note NORC no longer goes by National Opinion Research Center), and the\nUniversity of Chicago, Illinois.\n3Department of Medicine\u00adGeriatrics, University of Chicago, Illinois.\nObjectives. To describe the methods used for, correlates of cooperation with, and validity of in-home salivary speci-\nmens collected from older adults.\nMethods. Salivary specimens were collected between 2005 and 2006 during in-home interviews with a probability\nsample of 3,005 U.S. men and women, ages 57\u00ad85 years. Sex hormone levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-\nassay conducted at Salimetrics, LLC (State College, PA). Mean salivary sex hormone concentrations were compared by\ngender and in relation to medication use and health conditions.\nResults. Self-collected saliva specimens were provided by 2,722 (90.6%) individuals; 95.8% of these were adequate for\nanalysis. Black participants were significantly less likely than individuals of other racial/ethnic groups to provide a salivary\nspecimen; age, gender, education, and self-rated health were not associated with participation. Mean testosterone levels were\nhigher in men compared with women, and estradiol levels were higher in women using estrogens. Salivary hormone measure-\nments obtained in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) and other studies are of similar magnitude.\nConclusion. NSHAP is the first large, population-based study of older adults to measure salivary estradiol, progesterone,\ndehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and, in women, testosterone. These data demonstrate a high cooperation rate with\nin-home salivary specimen collection from older adults and good validity of sex hormone measurements.\nKeyWords: Sex hormone--Aging--Salivary--Saliva collection--Estrogen--Testosterone--Progesterone--DHEA--\nEstradiol--Older--Validity.\nwith the weak estrogen. estriol. being the most abundant\nEstradiol (17-beta-estradiol), the most potent bioactive estro-\ngen, is primarily synthesized from testosterone in the ovarian\nfollicles in females whereas in males, it is produced by the\ntestes and extraglandular conversion of androgens (Salimet-\ntrogen exerts central (brain) (Rehman & Masson, 2005) and\nperipheral (reproductive tract, mammary gland, skeletal, car-\ndiovascular) effects (Hall, Couse, & Korach, 2001).\nEstrogen metabolism and synthesis in men appear to re-\nmain relatively stable across the life course (Kaufman &\nVermeulen, 2005). In contrast, major changes in sex hor-\nmone metabolism occur in women around natural meno-\npause, most notably due to a decline in ovarian estrogen\nproduction (Manly et al., 2000). Although the human\nlifespan is increasing, the mean age of menopause has not\nchanged as rapidly. Life expectancy at birth for American\n(Bell & Miller, 2002). At the same time, the mean age at\nnatural menopause for U.S. women born in 1915 versus\ncrease) (Nichols et al., 2006). Women are therefore living\nincreasingly longer in a menopausal state.\nRelative estrogen depletion in women in later life has\nbeen associated with a variety of age-related changes in\nphysical and cognitive function as well as disease. Among\nmen and women, serum estradiol concentration has been\nassociated with bone turnover and risk for osteoporotic\nfractures (lower estrogen is associated with skeletal vulner-\nability) (Kuchuk et al., 2007). Likewise, estradiol concen-\ntration has been associated with cognition (Carlson et al.,\nmemory (Tivis et al., 2005) in women and, in combination\nwith testosterone levels and other factors, with preservation\nof memory and cognitive function in men (Barrett-Connor,\nGoodman-Gruen, & Patay, 1999; Carlson & Sherwin,\n2000). A number of studies have linked higher levels of se-\nrum estradiol to increased risk for developing breast cancer\net al., 2005) and coronary problems (Chlebowski et al.,\nal., 2005) in women. Much less is known about the role of\nestrogen in social functioning in general or in later life.\nEstrogen depletion in menopause and sustained, low lev-\nels of circulating estrogen throughout the postmenopausal\nlifespan significantly affect the condition and function of\nthe female genital tract. Estrogen is important for maintain-\ning skin, subcutaneous, mucosal (vaginal, bladder, and\nrectal) and musculoskeletal integrity, the vaginal microen-\nvironment (pH balance and microflora), vascular flow to the\nvagina and clitoris, and sensory perception. Over time, in\nthe genital tract, low estrogen results in vaginal dryness,\nloss of epithelial cell glycogen, shortening of the vagina,\nnarrowing of the introitus, thinning of the labia, and dimi-\nnution of the fat pad underlying the mons pubis. Though the\nrole of estrogen in female sexuality is not fully understood,\nit may influence sexual desire (Dennerstein, Gotts, et al.,\ntherapy may indirectly enhance female sexual performance,\nby restoring vaginal lubrication (Meston & Frohlich) and\npromoting positive body image and an overall positive sense\nof well-being (Bachmann & Leiblum, 2004). Additionally,\nsexual activity and other forms of physical contact may\nmitigate estrogen-related decline in sensory perception and\nfunction with age and may play a role in female attractive-\nness. Largely due to highly publicized findings in 2002 from\nthe randomized, controlled hormone therapy trials of the\nU.S. Women's Health Initiative Study (comparing use of\nequine estrogen alone or in combination with medroxypro-\ngesterone to placebo among post menopausal women ages\nof women currently initiate estrogen therapy for treatment\nof menopausal symptoms or preservation of sexual function\nProgesterone is found in both women and men, although the\nphysiological role in men is poorly understood (Andersen &\nTufik, 2006). In reproductive age females, the primary function\nof progesterone involves preparation and maintenance of the\nendometrium for implantation of fertilized oocytes (Speroff\net al., 1999). In women, progesterone is synthesized from preg-\nnenolone in the adrenal cortex, corpus luteum of the ovary, in\nthe brain, and during pregnancy, by the placenta. Due to decline\nin ovarian production, progesterone production is markedly de-\ncreased following menopause. This decline may result in di-\nminished sexual function and desire (Dennerstein, Alexander,\n& Kotz, 2003). Increased levels of progesterone have been\nfound in states of stress and anxiety in men and women; this\nmay relate to its sedative or stress-counteracting effects (Wirth,\nMeier, Fredrickson, & Shcultheiss, 2007; Wirth & Schultheiss,\n2006). Exogenous progesterone is used in older women primar-\nily in combination with estrogen therapy to protect against es-\ntrogen's growth-promoting effects on the uterine endometrial\nlining and to treat pathological processes of the uterine endo-\nmetrium. In men, exogenous progesterone has been used to re-\nduce sexual activity, a mechanism of action that may relate to its\nantiandrogenic properties (Andersen & Tufik, 2006).\nTestosterone is the defining male sex hormone, is more\nabundant in males than females, but appears to play an im-\nportant physiological role in sexual functioning of both.\nTestosterone is synthesized in the male testes, the female\novaries, and the adrenal glands in both sexes (Davis & Tran,\none levels gradually decline in both sexes (Davis & Tran;\nTenover, 1997). Because the ovaries are a primary, and rela-\ntively stable, source of female testosterone production\nthroughout the life course (Davis & Tran, 2001), premeno-\npausal bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of both\novaries prior to onset of natural menopause) results in abrupt\nand irreversible loss of the major source of testosterone in\nwomen (Hendrix, 2005; Laughlin, Barrett-Connor, Kritz-\nundergo surgical menopause each year in the United States\n(Keshavarz, Hillis, Kieke, & Marchbanks, 2002). Because\nestrogen synthesis largely derives from ovarian testosterone\npostmenopausally, surgical removal of the ovaries also ex-\nacerbates the estrogen deficit in these women.\nIn both sexes, decline in testosterone levels leads to bone\ndensity loss (Davis & Tran, 2001; Jassal, Barrett-Connor, &\none, along with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), plays an\nimportant role in female libido, arousal, genital sensation,\nand orgasm. Loss of testosterone can exacerbate vaginal\nmucosal atrophy, thinning of public hair, and may compro-\nmise an older woman's sense of general well-being. Low\nlevels of testosterone have been correlated with lower coital\nfrequency and loss of sexual desire in men and women\n(Davis & Tran, 2001), although the relationship between\nfemale sexual interest in later life and testosterone levels is\ncontroversial (Davis & Tran, 2001; Dennerstein, Smith,\nMorse, & Burger, 1994). Testosterone administration may\nimprove mood and well-being in both sexes, especially\nJassal et al., 1995). Circulating testosterone in women is a\nstrong correlate of ovarian function and androgen production,\nthough approximately one third of circulating levels are de-\nrived via precursors from the adrenal gland (Lobo, 2001).\nDHEA and its sulfate (DHEA-S) are produced by the\ncortex of the adrenal gland (Williams & Wilson, 1998) and\nact as precursors to approximately half of the active andro-\ngen concentration in adult men (Regelson, Loria, & Kalimi,\n1994). DHEA production and concentration decline is\nsignificant and steady during human aging (Hackbert &\nVillareal & Holloszy, 2004) in both males and females\n(Labrie, Belanger, Cusan, Gomez, & Candas, 1997; Panjari\n& Davis, 2007) and, therefore, has been suggested as a puta-\ntive biomarker of physiologic aging (Johnson, Bebb, & Sirrs,\n2002). Low levels of endogenous DHEA concentration are\nassociated with cardiovascular disease (Alexandersen,\nHaarbo, & Christiansen, 1996), progression of HIV infec-\ntion (Christeff et al., 1996), symptomatic progression of sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus (Spark, 2002), presence of\nrheumatoid arthritis among postmenopausal women (Masi,\nDHEA has been studied for its role in mood and well-being\nogy, and treatment of sexual problems (Spark, 2002).\nMethods\nDetails of the NSHAP sample design and participant char-\nacteristics have been previously described (Lindau et al.,\nresponse rate was 75.5%. Here, we describe the collection of\nsaliva specimens and details of the sex hormone assays. In\naddition to assays for DHEA, testosterone, progesterone, and\nestradiol, an assay for cotinine (a primary metabolite of nico-\ntine) was performed. The salivary cotinine measure is de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere (Drum, Shiovitz-Ezra, Gaumer, &\nLindau, in press).\nSaliva Specimen Collection and Processing\nDetails of the salivary assays collected in the NSHAP\nstudy have been previously described (Mendoza, Curran, &\n& Lindau, 2007). Approximately midway through the in-\nhome interview, salivary specimens were collected from all\nwilling respondents. Following procedures developed by\nGranger and colleagues (2007), whole unstimulated saliva\nwas collected by passive drool. Approximately 2 mililiters\nof saliva was donated into a small, code-labeled polypropyl-\nene collection vial via a 5 centimeter section of a household\nplastic straw. The time of last food consumption and time of\nthe saliva specimen collection were recorded. To minimize\nthe effects of room temperature on salivary analyte levels\n(Whembolua, Granger, Kivlighan, Marguin, & Singer,\n2006), samples were transported on cold packs immediately\nafter collection, from the interview site to a residential-\ngrade freezer (-20 \u00b0C) where they were stored until shipped\nvia overnight delivery on dry ice to Salimetrics laboratories\n(State College, PA). Upon receipt, specimens were invento-\nried and then archived at -80 \u00b0C until the day of assay.\nHormone Assays\nThe salivary enzyme immunoassays were conducted at\nSalimetrics, LLC. On the day of assay, specimens were\nthawed completely, vortexed, and centrifuged at 1,500 \u00d7 g\nduplicate into test wells using a 96-well plate format. To\nminimize the effects of freeze thaw cycles on assay results,\nthe analyses were scheduled in the following priority order:\n(a) estradiol, (b) progesterone, (c) DHEA, (d) testosterone,\nand (e) cotinine. All assays were conducted using commer-\ncially available immunoassay kits without modification to\nthe manufacturer's recommended protocol (Salimetrics).\nAssays were performed in duplicate with the average of the\nduplicate tests used in all analyses. The criteria for repeated\ntesting was variation greater than 20% between duplicates,\nand on average, the assay protocols had intra- and interas-\nsay coefficients of variation less than 10% and 15%, re-\nspectively. Hormone values were measured in picograms\nper milliliter and cotinine in nanograms per milliliter. As\nexpected, hormonal therapies (oral, transdermal, topical)\ncross-react with the detection antibodies used in these\nassays, resulting in high salivary hormone measurements.\nSex hormone measurements that exceeded the upper bound-\nary of assay and results below the assay limit of sensitivity\nare flagged in the publicly available NSHAP data set and\nsummarized in Table 1. More details on the quality control\nissues regarding each sex hormone assay can be found in\npreviously published NSHAP Technical Reports (Mendoza\nValues for each duplicate assay are included in the public-use\ndata set. Missing codes and flags describe problems encoun-\ntered in obtaining an adequate specimen for sex hormone anal-\nysis (e.g., insufficient sample quantity, equipment problems).\nVariables Used in the Analysis\nData are presented for three age strata to correspond with\nyears, and 75\u00ad85 years (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &\nSmith, in review). Gender was assessed by field staff observa-\ntion. Race and ethnicity were self-reported and categorized as\nWhite, Black, Hispanic, and other. Education level was di-\nchotomized as \"high school and below\" and \"some college\nand higher.\" Respondents were asked to rate their physical\nhealth using the standard 5-point scale with responses \"excel-\nlent,\" \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\" and \"poor.\" For these ana-\nlyses, we use three self-rated health categories: \"very good/\nexcellent,\" \"good,\" and \"fair/poor.\"\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using the Stata statistical\nsoftware package, release 9 (StataCorp, 2005). Logistic re-\ngression (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989) was used to model\nthe likelihood of participating in the saliva collection. This\nmodel included age group, gender, race/ethnicity, education,\nand self-rated health as covariates. Results are presented as\nodds ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. To ac-\ncount for the unequal probabilities of selection, we performed\nweighted analyses using the probability weights with a post-\nstratification adjustment based on age and urbanicity. Infer-\nence was conducted using design-based variance estimates,\nobtained via the linearization method (Binder, 1983) as im-\nplemented in Stata (StataCorp, 2005). Differences between\nmeans were evaluated using the adjusted Wald test. All p val-\nues reported are two sided from the adjusted Wald test.\nAssessment of Internal and External Validity\nInternal validity of sex hormone measurements was first\nassessed by gender comparison of saliva testosterone levels,\nwhich are expected to be higher in men compared with\nwomen (Shirtcliff, Granger, & Likos, 2002). Internal valid-\nity of the saliva sex hormone measurements was further\nassessed by evaluation of association between specific sex\nhormone concentrations and corresponding health condi-\ntions or behaviors, including use of exogenous sex hor-\nmones or hormone blockers, obesity, and oophorectomy.\nHistory of ovary removal (oophorectomy) was determined\non the basis of self-report. Medication data were collected\nduring the in-home interview by direct observation using a\ncomputer-based medication log.

The mean salivary estra-\ndiol levels were nearly equivalent for men and women.\nTable 4 reports salivary sex hormone concentrations in\nwomen in relation to exogenous sex hormone use. Of\nTable 2.

Of these, 24 were using\nestrogen in combination with a progestin and 6 were using\nestrogen in combination with an androgen product. One\nwoman used only androgen and one woman used only pro-\ngestin supplementation. Women taking estrogen alone or in\nnificantly higher levels of salivary estradiol compared with\nnonusers (see Table 4).\nInternal validity of the saliva sex hormone measurements\nwas further assessed by evaluation of sex hormone levels in\nobese men and women, men taking drugs with antiandro-\ngenic and androgenic activity, and women with a history of\nbilateral oophorectomy (Table 5).\nFew men (n = 39, 2.5% overall) reported exogenous sex\nhormone use or use of other medications affecting sex hor-\nmone metabolism. Of these, 32 were using 5-alpha-reductase\ninhibitors. These drugs reduce circulating androgens by re-\nducing conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and\nare used most commonly in the treatment of benign prostatic\nhyperplasia. Six men used androgens or anabolic steroids and\none man reported progestin use. Although the associations\nwere not statistically significant (the subgroups were very\nsmall), men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors exhibit\nslightly lower concentrations of salivary testosterone com-\npared with nonusers of this drug. Likewise, men taking andro-\ngens or anabolic steroids exhibit higher levels of testosterone\n(again, this association was not statistically significant due to\nthe small number of men taking anabolic steroids).\nBilateral oophorectomy was reported by 392 women in\nthe sample. Ovaries are the predominant source of androgen\nproduction in postmenopausal women. Testosterone levels\nas compared with women with at least one ovary (47.03 \u00b1\n0.94 pg/ml), but this difference was not statistically signifi-\ncant. Only 6 of 392 ovariectomized women used androgen\nreplacement therapy. Salivary testosterone concentration in\nthese women was only slightly higher as compared with\n44.1 \u00b1 1.31 pg/ml, respectively); this difference was not sta-\ntistically significant. Obese men and women demonstrate\nhigher levels of testosterone compared with nonobese par-\nticipants; testosterone levels among obese women were sig-\nnificantly higher than among nonobese women (Table 5).\nTables 6 and 7 compare salivary measurements of estra-\ndiol, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone in women and\nmen with those reported by other studies. Overall, salivary\nlevels of sex hormones demonstrate significant variability\ndependent on age, gender, season of the year, and time of the\nday (see Tables 6 and 7). Where comparable data are avail-\nable, salivary sex hormone data from NSHAP are similar to\nother published findings for progesterone, testosterone, and\nestradiol (Tables 6 and 7). The mean estradiol concentration\nreported by Krause and colleagues for older men (Krause,\nMueller, & Mazur, 2002) is very similar to estradiol levels\nfound in NSHAP for older women and men (Tables 6\nand 7). Salivary DHEA concentrations in NSHAP are lower\nthan those reported in the literature for younger people.\nTable 3.

Use of minimally inva-\nsive methods for collection of sex hormonal data is feasible\nand provides information relevant to furthering an under-\nstanding of the role of sex hormones in relation to sexuality\nin later life, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other chronic\nconditions of aging. Population data complement clinical\ndata by providing normative information.\nAlthough saliva collection via passive drool may be dif-\nficult for older adults due to aging-related changes in saliva\nproduction (Hodgson, Freedman, Granger, & Erno, 2004),\nmedication side effects causing dry mouth, and manual\nmanipulation of the small collection devices, overall coop-\neration with the home-based protocol was high in this pop-\nulation-based sample of older adults. Blacks were less likely\nto provide saliva samples during the interview. The National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has\nalso reported relatively lower participation of this racial\ngroup in biological measure protocols, specifically collection\nof DNA from blood. In that study, removal of language in\nthe consent process that linked blood collection to genetic\nresearch increased participation in every demographic cat-\negory (McQuillan, Pan, & Porter, 2006).

Although, in the case of\nvaginal swab sampling, differences in cooperation were\nfound by age and education (older age, less educated were\nless likely to participate) but not by race/ethnicity (Lindau\net al., in press). This may be due to the relative invasiveness\nof the collection protocols or other factors and requires\nmore investigation.\nInternal validity of the salivary sex hormone measure-\nments is suggested by the expected findings of higher tes-\ntosterone concentrations in men versus women (Shirtcliff\net al., 2002) and similar estradiol concentrations in women\nand men (Greenblatt, Oettinger, & Bohler, 1976; Shirtcliff\net al., 2002). The proportion of individuals using exogenous\nhormones was small in the NSHAP sample, as is true in the\npopulation as a whole (Wysowski, Golden, & Burke, 1995).\nSalivary testosterone concentrations in ovariectomized\nwomen and in men using androgens were also shifted in\nEstrogen use in women was significantly correlated with\nhigher salivary estradiol concentrations as reported by other\nauthors (Tivis et al., 2005). Obesity is associated with lower\nproduction of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in both\nwomen and men; consistent with this, and as has been ob-\nserved previously (Cappola et al., 2007; Lukanova et al.,\nhigher levels of free salivary testosterone. The expected rela-\ntionship between obesity and free testosterone in men is less\nclear, and in NSHAP, obese men do not demonstrate signifi-\ncantly different levels of free testosterone than non-obese\nmen. This may be because both SHBG and total testosterone\narelowerinobeseascomparedwithothermen(Allan,Strauss,\nBurger, Forbes, & McLachlan, 2006; Derby, Zilber, Bram-\nbilla, Morales, & McKinlay, 2006; Giagulli, Kaufman, &\nNormative data on salivary sex hormone concentrations\nin later life are scarce. As a result, external validation of\nNSHAP data is particularly difficult for progesterone and\nDHEA in men and estradiol, DHEA, and testosterone in\nwomen. Most existing data derive from small, clinical\npopulations of young volunteers. One population-based\nstudy collected salivary specimens from 48 \"randomly se-\nlected,\" healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men ages 50\u00ad80\nyears, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 similar men\nfrom State College, Pennsylvania (Krause et al., 2002). In\nthat study, salivary measures of DHEA-S (but not DHEA),\ntestosterone, and estradiol were obtained (see Table 7).\nThe concentrations of testosterone and estradiol are simi-\nlar to those obtained in the NSHAP study. Some studies\nreport lower levels of estradiol (Schultheiss, Dargel, &\nNSHAP study, although other authors report similar levels\nof salivary estradiol (Emaus et al., 2008; Nunez-De La\nMora, Bentley, Choudhury, Napolitano, & Chatterton, 2008;\nRantala, Enksson, Vainikka, & Kortet, 2006). Estradiol mea-\nsurements in the NSHAP study contain a small number of\ncases with very high values. For this reason, median (rather\nthan mean) values of salivary estradiol in the NSHAP study\nTable 7.

As in the case of estradiol, progesterone measure-\nments contain outliers, so median levels of salivary proges-\npg/ml for women) demonstrate better agreement with the re-\nported data from other studies (Celec et al., 2006; Jasienska\nvalues (see Tables 6 and 7).\nSalivary DHEA measurements reported for younger\nadults by other studies (Granger, Schwartz, Booth, Curran,\n& Herbert, 2001) are higher than found in the NSHAP\nstudy, as expected due to age-related decline of DHEA\n(Ahn, Lee, Choi, Kwon, & Chun, 2007; Granger et al.,\n1999). DHEA concentrations measured in serum have gen-\nerally been reported to be similar in men and women, al-\nthough DHEA levels in men are nearly always higher than\nin women (Rehman & Carr, 2004). In the NSHAP sample,\nmen exhibit consistently higher concentrations of DHEA\ncompared with women. This may be related to more rapid\ndecline of DHEA levels with age in women than in men,\nalthough more studies are needed to clarify this gender\ndifference.\nCompared with younger adults (Brown et al., 2008; Flegr,\none levels obtained in the NSHAP study are lower. For older\nmen, the levels of salivary testosterone obtained in the NS-\nHAP study and in another population-based study (Krause\net al., 2002) are very similar (see Tables 6 and 7). Overall,\ndue to varying assay techniques, study populations and\nstudy conditions, salivary hormone measurements obtained\nacross studies are difficult to compare; those reported here\nare of similar magnitude to findings in the most comparable\nstudies.\nMinimally invasive, valid, and reliable methods of sex hor-\nmone measurements in saliva can enhance the application of\npopulation-based aging research to understanding of disease\nand function in later life. For example, low levels of endoge-\nnous DHEA and testosterone in men are related to decreased\nMatsumoto, Sloan, & Kivlahan, 2006), higher risk for car-\ndiovascular diseases (Choi & McLaughlin, 2007;\n(Morsink et al., 2007). Overall, circulating endogenous sex\nhormones including estrogens have a neutral or beneficial ef-\nfect on cardiovascular disease in men (Muller, van der Schouw,\nThijssen, & Grobbee, 2003). High estrogen levels in women\nmay be linked to increased risk of breast (Dorgan et al.,\nkhanov, Zeleniuch-Jacquotte, & Toniolo, 2001) cancer. The\nassociation between estradiol and cognitive function is\ncomplex. Although in vitro studies demonstrated beneficial\neffects of estrogen on the brain (Ravaglia et al., 2007), recent\nlongitudinal studies showed positive association of endoge-\nnous estradiol and risk for vascular dementia (Geerlings\nin women but not in men. The NSHAP data set can be used\nto further explore the relationships between disease, function,\nand sex hormones in later life. For example, our recent study\nusing NSHAP data shows that higher levels of some sex hor-\nmones are correlated with better sexual performance in\nConclusion\nExperience from the NSHAP study demonstrates that\ncollection of salivary specimens from older men and women\nin an in-home, population-based study using nonmedical\nfield staff is feasible and that the data are internally and ex-\nternally valid. The cooperation rate for this minimally inva-\nsive procedure is high. Saliva specimens provide novel sex\nhormone data of relevance to studying health and illness in\nlater life.\nFunding\nThe National Health, Social Life, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is sup-\nported by the National Institutes of Health, including the National Insti-\ntute on Aging, the Office of Research on Women's Health, the Office of\nAIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Re-\nstaff was responsible for the data collection.
