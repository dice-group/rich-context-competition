We determined the proportion of\noffice visits at which physicians identi-\nfied an adolescent's smoking status and\ncounseled about smoking and then\nidentified predictors of these outcomes\nwith logistic regression.

Younger and nonwhite ado-\nlescents were less likely to be counseled\nabout smoking than older and white\nteens. Conclusions: We found that phy-\nsicians frequently identified adoles-\ncents' smoking status but rarely coun-\nseled them about smoking. Physicians'\npractices did not improve in the first\nsensus about the importance of this ac-\ntivity and the publication of physician\nguidelines targeting this population.\nPhysicians treating adolescents are\nmissing opportunities to discourage to-\nbacco use among teens. [J Natl Cancer\nNearly 90% of cigarette smokers\nsmoke their first cigarette before the age\nof 18 years (1), and it is estimated that 5\nmillion premature smoking-related deaths\nwill occur among the youths who were\ncoupled with the rising prevalence of\nsmoking among U.S. adolescents (3),\nhave led to a national focus on preventing\nand treating smoking in this age group.\nBecause more than 70% of adolescents\nare seen by a physician yearly (4,5), the\nhealth care system provides an important\nopportunity for addressing smoking\namong youths. Children and adolescents\nperceive physicians to be credible health\nexperts and may heed their advice more\nthan that of their parents or other adults\n(1,6). The American Medical Associa-\ntion's Guidelines for Adolescent Preven-\ntive Services (AMA GAPS) recommends\nthat adolescents from ages 11 to 21 years\nvisit the physician annually (7). These\nvisits provide an opportunity for physi-\ncians to prevent and deter tobacco use (1).\nBrief physician counseling has been\nshown to increase the smoking cessation\nrates of adult patients (8\u00ad10), but the ef-\nficacy of physician counseling to prevent\ntobacco use among adolescents has not\nyet been demonstrated. Nonetheless,\nsince the late 1980s, numerous organiza-\ntions have made recommendations about\nsmoking prevention and cessation for\nphysicians who treat children and adoles-\nfor adolescents and young adults devel-\noped by the National Cancer Institute and\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics en-\ncourage physicians to make repeated brief\ninterventions that include the following:\n1) asking adolescents at every visit\nwhether they or their friends use tobacco,\n2) advising tobacco users to stop, 3) con-\ngratulating patients who do not use to-\nbacco, and 4) advising abstinence (13). In\naddition, the American Academy of Fam-\nily Physicians, the AMA GAPS, the U.S.\nPreventive Services Task Force, the Ma-\nternal and Child Health Bureau, and the\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Re-\nsearch recommend that physicians ac-\ntively screen and counsel adolescents\nhealth promotion goals for the year 2000\ninclude decreasing the rate of adolescent\nsmoking and increasing the rate of physi-\ncian counseling (14).\nDespite consensus that physicians\nshould address smoking with adolescent\npatients, there is little information about\nhow well physicians comply with these\nrecommendations. A majority of Massa-\nsmoking status and provided advice to\nstop smoking to \"most\" or \"all\" of their\npatients and that they encouraged \"most\"\nor \"all\" of the children and adolescents\nnot to start using tobacco (16). However,\nin a retrospective review of 250 preven-\ntive visits by adolescents, physicians in a\nhealth maintenance organization provided\n\"anticipatory guidance\" about use of ciga-\nrettes at only 6% of all visits (17), and in\nNorthern California surveys conducted\nof the adolescent smokers who had seen\na physician in the past year reported ever\nbeing advised by a physician to quit (5).\nlatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)\nreported that physicians counseled ado-\nlescents about smoking at only 1% of\nthe visits (18).

Doctors of\nmedicine and osteopathy are selected by stratified\nrandom sampling from American Medical Associa-\ntion and American Osteopathic Association listings\nof all practicing office-based physicians in the\nUnited States. The unit of analysis is the patient\nvisit. Each participating physician, aided by his or\nher office staff, completes a one-page encounter\nform after ambulatory care visits. Outpatient care\nprovided in hospital settings and by telephone is\nexcluded. Physicians record information about pa-\ntient demographics, smoking status, expected source\nof payment, reasons for the visit, diagnoses, coun-\nseling and education provided, and current medica-\ntions. The cross-sectional nature of NAMCS permits\npatterns in physician practices to be followed over\ntime but does not allow individual physicians or pa-\ntients to be followed longitudinally.\nThe NCHS uses a complex three-stage sampling\ndesign, which has previously been described in de-\ntail (25). The first stage involves probability samples\nof counties or groups of counties, and the second\nstage consists of a probability sample of practicing\nphysicians stratified by specialty. The final stage\ninvolves sampling of patient visits from a random\nweek of a physician's practice and a systematic ran-\ndom sample of those visits (i.e., every third visit),\ndepending on the size of the practice (24). To pro-\nduce unbiased national estimates, each patient visit\nis assigned an inflation factor called the \"patient\nvisit weight\" on the basis of the probability of se-\nlection, the differences in physicians' response rates,\nand the specialty distributions. We modified these\nweights by use of proportional scaling via the\nmethod of Potthoff et al. (26) to derive effective\nsample sizes for use in statistical testing. All esti-\nmates presented in the results of this study are per-\ncentages weighted to reflect national estimates. The\nweighted percentages presented in this report may\nnot always match percentage directly calculated\nfrom the different outcome data described here with-\nout taking into consideration the weighting. The\nNCHS provides relative standard errors for esti-\nmates to gauge the reliability of an estimate for an\nindividual year (24). The relative standard error of\nan estimate is obtained by dividing the standard er-\nror of the estimate by the estimate itself and is ex-\npressed as a percentage of the estimate (24). An\nestimate with a relative standard error greater than\nWe analyzed data collected from 1991, when\nsmoking status was first included on the survey,\nthrough 1996, the most recent year available. The\nmethods were similar to our previous analysis of the\ntreatment of smoking in adult patients (19). Physi-\ncian response rates varied between 70% and 73% for\nthe 6 years (24). All visits by adolescent patients\namined changes in physician practices from 1991\nthrough 1996 and then combined data from all six\nannual surveys to describe factors associated with\nthese practices. We examined three outcomes: 1)\nidentification of patients' smoking status, 2) provi-\nsion of smoking counseling at all visits, and 3) pro-\nvision of smoking counseling at visits by smokers.\nPhysicians identified a patient's smoking status by\nanswering the question, \"Does patient smoke ciga-\nrettes?\" Smoking status was categorized as known if\nthe box was checked \"yes\" or \"no.\" Smoking status\nwas unknown if the box was checked \"unknown\" or\nif no answer was provided. Physicians recorded\nsmoking counseling by checking the appropriate box\nunder the section \"counseling/education.\" For the\nthe box was labeled \"tobacco use/exposure.\" Data\nfice visits by adolescent patients from 1991 through\nStatistical Analysis\nIndependent predictors of smoking status identi-\nfication and smoking counseling were determined\nwith multiple logistic regression (28). Adjusted odds\nratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nwere calculated from these multiple logistic regres-\nsion models. Tests of statistical significance were\ntwo-sided. Covariates included in the models for the\nthree outcomes and used for adjustment of the ORs\nwere survey year, patient demographics (age, sex,\nand race), metropolitan statistical area, expected\npayment source for the visit, diagnoses, and physi-\ncian specialty. Race was categorized as white (non-\nHispanic) and nonwhite. The nonwhite category\ncould not be subdivided further because of small\nnumbers. Three categories of diagnoses were as-\nsessed as predictor variables because of their asso-\nciation with adverse outcomes from continued\nsmoking: asthma, lower respiratory infection, and\npregnancy. A fourth category, general medical ex-\namination, was included because data from adults\nhave shown that physicians are more likely to iden-\ntify patients' smoking status and to counsel smokers\nat this type of visit (19). Each category was defined\nby the use of the International Classification of Dis-\neases, 9th revision, diagnosis codes (29). All diag-\nnosis categories were created as binary variables,\ne.g., asthma versus no asthma; therefore, each visit\ncould be included in more than one diagnosis cat-\negory. Physicians were categorized as primary care\n(pediatricians, family practitioners, general inter-\nnists, and obstetrician/gynecologists) or specialists\n(all other specialties). Expected payment source for\nthe visit was divided into five categories: health\nmaintenance organization, private insurance, Med-\nicaid, Medicare, and \"other\" insurance providers.\nTo further explore the association between phy-\nsician intervention and the specific problem ad-\ndressed during the visit, we calculated the rate of\nsmoking counseling for the 10 most common pri-\nmary diagnoses of adolescent smokers visiting pri-\nmary care physicians. A primary diagnosis is the\ndiagnosis associated with the patient's primary rea-\nson for making the visit. We grouped clinically re-\nlated primary diagnoses by use of Schneeweiss di-\nagnosis clusters (30).\nRESULTS\ncent patient visits to 5087 physicians from\nshown in this study are weighted to reflect\nnational estimates (see \"Materials and\nMethods\" section). Smoking status was\ncounseling was provided at 286 visits,\nvisits, respectively. Patients were identi-\nfied as smokers at 1005 visits, which rep-\nresented 6.0% of all visits, and 8.5% of\nvisits where smoking status was identi-\nfied. Smokers were identified at 0.8% of\ncounseling was provided at 168 of the vis-\nits by smokers, representing 16.9% of the\nvisits by patients identified as smokers.\nWe caution that some of the estimates for\ncounseling at smokers' visits may be un-\nreliable, as shown in Table 1, because the\nrelative standard errors are greater than\n30% (see \"Materials and Methods\" sec-\nportion of visits at which physicians iden-\ntified smoking status decreased from\n<.0001), but the proportion of visits where\nphysicians provided smoking counseling\nor identified the patient as a smoker did\nnot change significantly (Fig. 1).\nTable 1 shows factors independently\nassociated with identification of smoking\nstatus, provision of smoking counseling at\nall adolescent visits, and provision of\nsmoking counseling at visits by adoles-\ncents identified as smokers. An adoles-\ncent's age and race, but not sex, influ-\nenced the frequency at which physicians\nasked or counseled about smoking. As an\nadolescent's age increased, physicians\nwere less likely to know the patient's\nsmoking status but more likely to counsel\nabout smoking. Physicians were more\nlikely to identify smoking status and to\ndiscuss smoking with white than with\nnonwhite adolescents. Physician specialty\nand patient diagnosis also affected the\nlikelihood of smoking being addressed\nduring an office visit. Primary care phy-\nsicians were more likely than specialists\nto identify an adolescent's smoking status\nand to discuss smoking. All physicians\nwere more likely to address smoking at\nvisits by patients with asthma, pregnancy,\nor lower respiratory tract infections, and\nan adolescent was almost five times more\nlikely to be counseled about smoking at a\ngeneral medical examination than at a\nproblem visit. Similar patterns occurred\nfor smoking counseling at visits by ado-\nlescents known to be smokers, and the\nassociations with physician specialty,\ngeneral medical examination, pregnancy,\nand lower respiratory tract infection were\nstatistically significant.\nFig. 2 shows in greater detail the vari-\nability in smoking treatment by physician\nlescent visits were to pediatricians, 22.1%\nspecialists. Pediatricians identified the\nsmoking status of adolescents at 81.7% of\nall office visits, and the corresponding\nrates for family practitioners, obstetrician/\ngynecologists, and internists (75.3%\u00ad\n76.4%) were not statistically significantly\ndifferent. Counseling adolescents about\nsmoking occurred at 3.5% of all office\nvisits to pediatricians, at 2.5% of all visits\nto family practitioners, at 3.7% of all vis-\nits to obstetrician/gynecologists, and at\n1.7% of all visits to internists. Compared\nwith pediatricians, counseling occurred\nsignificantly less often at adolescent visits\nto family practitioners (P  .01 after ad-\njustment with multiple logistic regres-\nsion) and internists (P  .02 after adjust-\nment). Specialists identified smoking\nstatus and counseled about smoking sta-\ntistically significantly less than pediatri-\nFig. 3 shows the rates of smoking\ncounseling at the 10 most common pri-\nmary diagnoses of adolescent smokers.\nSmoking counseling occurred most fre-\nquently (>20% of smokers' visits) at gen-\neral medical examinations and at visits for\nacute respiratory tract infections and\npregnancy care and abortion, diagnoses\npotentially complicated by smoking.

We report that be-\nquently identified an adolescent's smok-\ning status but rarely discussed smoking in\nany further detail. Even when the patient\nwas known to be a smoker and the pur-\npose of the visit was a general medical\nexamination, smoking counseling oc-\ncurred only 34.6% of the time. The rate of\ndiscussing smoking at a general medical\nexamination with any teen, regardless of\nsmoking status, was even lower (6.3%),\ndespite numerous recommendations to\ndiscuss smoking at visits by all teens,\neven those who do not smoke (7,9\u00ad\nsensus among professional organizations\nabout the importance of addressing smok-\ning with teens and the development of\nguidelines and health promotion goals on\nthe subject.\nThe factors that were related to wheth-\ner smoking was addressed at an adoles-\ncent's visit included a physician's spe-\ncialty and a patient's age, race, and\ndiagnosis. Primary care physicians were\nmore likely to identify an adolescent's\nsmoking status and to counsel a teen\nabout smoking than were specialists. This\npattern also has been found among phy-\nsicians treating adult patients (19). The\ndifferent types of primary care physicians\nwho see adolescent patients were equally\nlikely to identify a teen's smoking status\n(Fig. 2, A), but pediatricians were more\nlikely than family practitioners and inter-\nnists to counsel (Fig. 2, B). However, the\nspecialty differences were small, and all\ntypes of physicians did little counseling.\nAn adolescent's diagnosis was also\nstrongly associated with the provision of\nsmoking counseling at an office visit. Pa-\ntients with diagnoses potentially compli-\ncated by smoking, such as asthma or preg-\nnancy, were more likely to be counseled\nabout smoking than patients with other\ndiagnoses. This is consistent with another\n30% of the patients with sickle cell dis-\nease or cystic fibrosis, chronic diseases\ncomplicated by smoking, recalled being\ncounseled by their physician about to-\nbacco use in the past year. A similar pat-\nFig. 3. Smoking counseling at visits (% of visits by smokers \u00b1 95% confidence intervals) for the 10 most\ncommon primary diagnoses of adolescent smokers.\nFig. 2. A) Smoking status identification (% of all visits \u00b1 95% confidence intervals) and B) smoking\ncounseling provided (% of all visits \u00b1 95% confidence intervals) by primary care physicians (pediatricians,\nfamily practitioners, obstetricians and gynecologists, and internists) and by all other specialist physicians.\nAfter adjustment for year, sex, age, race, diagnosis, type of visit, metropolitan statistical area, and insurance\nstatus, all strata were compared with pediatric specialty (multiple logistic regression analysis two-sided P\ntern has been reported for adults, although\nsome of the smoking-related diagnoses\nwere different (19). For adolescents, visits\nfor diagnoses not related to smoking are\nimportant missed opportunities for coun-\nseling to prevent tobacco use.\nNonwhite adolescents were less likely\nthan white teens to have their smoking\nstatus identified and to be counseled\nabout smoking. This result is similar to\nstudies of adult smokers that have shown\nthat members of nonwhite racial/ethnic\ngroups are less likely than whites to re-\nceive advice on quitting from their physi-\ncians (32). It is particularly concerning\nbecause the prevalence of adolescent\nsmoking is rising faster among African-\nAmerican and Hispanic teens than among\nwhite teens (3,32). Physicians counseled\nsignificantly more frequently than pa-\ntients aged 11\u00ad13 years. This increase in\ncounseling with age is most likely attrib-\nutable to the increasing prevalence of\nsmoking with age, since counseling at vis-\nits by known smokers did not vary with\nthe age of the patient. It is especially im-\nportant to address smoking with younger\nadolescents because smoking initiation\nrates increase rapidly after age 10 years\nOur results should be considered in the\ncontext of factors that have been shown to\nbe associated with physician counseling\nof both adult and adolescent smokers.\nThese include previous physician training\nin smoking counseling (16), physician in-\nvolvement in community tobacco control\nefforts (16), and office reminder systems\nto address tobacco use during a visit\nthese factors in our analysis, because the\nNAMCS does not assess physician or of-\nfice characteristics other than specialty\nand region of practice. These factors may\npartially explain the relationship between\nphysician specialty and smoking counsel-\ning that we observed. Alternatively, these\nfactors are potential confounders of this\nobserved relationship. Future studies\nshould collect data on all of these factors\nto better determine predictors of physi-\ncian counseling. Other factors, such as\nphysician beliefs about the lack of effi-\ncacy of counseling adolescents about\nsmoking, may also explain the low rates\nof counseling. Evidence of the efficacy of\nphysician counseling of adolescent pa-\ntients is lacking, and future research to\nestablish this efficacy is needed.\nThe prevalence of adolescent smoking\ndetected by physicians in our study was\nlower than the teen smoking prevalence\nfrom the Youth Risk Behavior Survey\n(YRBS), a survey in which adolescents\nreported their smoking habits. According\nto the YRBS, the prevalence of current\nsmoking (smoking one cigarette in the\npast 30 days) among U.S. high school stu-\nof frequent smoking (smoking on 20 or\nmore of the past 30 days) increased from\ncians in our study identified smokers at\nold adolescents and at 11% of the visits\nby 18- to 21-year-old adolescents. There\nare several possible reasons why our data\nmay underestimate the prevalence of\nsmoking among adolescents visiting the\nphysician. First, it is possible that adoles-\ncent smokers visit physicians less fre-\nquently than nonsmokers. Second, adoles-\ncents seeing a doctor may not have been\ntruthful about smoking because they did\nnot want to be reprimanded for their be-\nhavior or they were concerned about con-\nfidentiality. Finally, many of the physi-\ncians and patients may have defined a\n\"smoker\" to be an adolescent who smokes\non a daily basis (3). For these reasons, it is\nessential that physicians counsel all ado-\nlescents about smoking, even if the ado-\nlescent identifies himself or herself as a\nnonsmoker.\nThere are some limitations to our\nanalysis. First, the NAMCS is a visit-\nbased survey and, therefore, our estimates\nreflect only the probability of being coun-\nseled at a visit and not the probability of\nan individual patient being counseled\nover a given period, such as 1 year. Pa-\ntients who visit physicians frequently\nmight be less likely to be counseled about\nsmoking at an individual visit but more\nlikely to be counseled over 1 year. How-\never, the visit-based nature of the survey\nis not a limitation for assessing the iden-\ntification of smoking status because cur-\nrent guidelines advise physicians to ask\nabout smoking at every visit. Second,\nphysicians may have interpreted the defi-\nnition of smoking counseling differently.\ncounseling check box on the survey was\nlabeled as \"smoking cessation,\" while for\nlabeled \"tobacco use/exposure.\" It might\nbe expected that \"tobacco use/exposure\"\nwould be interpreted more broadly and\nbias the rate of counseling upward for\nthose years. However, the rates of smok-\ning counseling did not rise with the\nchange in labels, and it is unlikely that\nthis change substantially affected our es-\ntimates of counseling. Finally, the\nNAMCS might underestimate the amount\nof counseling provided by physicians be-\ncause the survey is completed after the\npatient visit. However, a recent direct ob-\nservation study of family physicians dem-\nonstrated that the rate of providing coun-\nwhich was similar to the rate of counsel-\ning by physicians in an analysis of\nNAMCS for patients 18 years of age or\nIn conclusion, it is clear that physi-\ncians are not adequately addressing smok-\ning among their adolescent patients. De-\nspite the national public health and public\npolicy emphasis on preventing smoking\namong teens, physicians are doing even\nless smoking counseling among adoles-\ncents than among adults (19). Further-\nmore, we find no evidence that the initial\nefforts to encourage physician involve-\nment by disseminating guidelines about\naddressing teen smoking have influenced\nphysician practices. If the medical com-\nmunity is to play its part in the national\neffort to reduce smoking among teens,\nmore intensive interventions to change\nphysician behavior are necessary. These\ninterventions should include 1) training\nprograms for residents and practicing\nphysicians treating adolescents, 2)\nchanges in office practice and information\nsystems to encourage physicians to ad-\ndress smoking, 3) adequate reimburse-\nment to physicians for counseling adoles-\ncents about tobacco use, and 4) the\ninclusion of smoking status identification\nand counseling about tobacco use as qual-\nity indicators for the treatment of adoles-\nabout counseling adolescents should ad-\ndress which of these interventions are\nmost effective. Physicians and other\nhealth care professionals who care for\nadolescents should take better advantage\nof their opportunity to discourage smok-\ning among their adolescent patients.\nREFERENCES\n(1) US Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices.
