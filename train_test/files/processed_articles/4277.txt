    "abstract": "Abstract\nInspired by critical discourse analysis and regarding language as a social medium whereby individuals, social groups, and\ninstitutions tend to express their beliefs and values, this study seeks to explore the persuasion and discourse strategies utilized\nin sermons. By focusing on the sermon of an influential native English orator and by employing Wodak's discourse\u00adhistorical\napproach, it aims to investigate how the targeted religious genre unfolds to disclose the persuasive powers of the orator and\nits impact on the audience. The results obtained from the qualitative analysis of the corpus under investigation revealed that\nthe speaker resorts to significant presentation of a wide range of topics to establish the oratory, and constructs the social\nactors through the application of nomination tools to qualify the selected actors through carefully formulated predication\ndevices by laying out discursively logical justifications concerning various topos. Alternatively, the complementary quantitative\ncorpus analysis using Corpus Presenter software also provided an insightful evidential basis reflecting orator's involvement,\nintensification of the intended illocutionary force, and his utilization of thought-provoking linguistic resources. Notably, the\nresults presented here may shed light on the function of intertextuality in the genre of the sermon operationalized and\nactivated through nomination strategies, the tools of argumentation theory, and interdiscursivity. Second, language learners'\nawareness of such elements may have an overriding importance in the process of text generation in speaking and writing\nprocesses.\n",

The power of orators and\nthe significant role of their speech have irrefutably been\ninfluential in affecting the results of different types of social\nunrests and revolutions, with the goal of motivating the pub-\nlic to oppose discrimination and unfair situations, overturn-\ning the oppressors, and building the cornerstones of a\nflourishing society. Orators skillfully utilize particular intel-\nligible semantic and grammatical structures to comfort the\nupset, to praise the people and events deserving respect and\npride, to inspire people to surpass for altruistic activities, to\nendanger their lives by taking daunting risks, to cry, and/or to\nlaugh aloud. Therefore, speech makers usually carry a heavy\nresponsibility on their shoulders whatever their purpose is,\ngood or evil, and their sermon is an interesting area of\nresearch because it has a determinant of part in the final\ndestination and directions of the societies to which they\nAn evidence from etymology indicates that the term ser-\nmon originated from a Middle English word borrowed from\nold French, which had in turn been taken from the Latin\nword \"sermo\" signifying \"discourse.\" Involving such dis-\ncourse components such as clear and detailed explanation,\nadmonishment, and reasonable application, sermon stylisti-\ncally adopts a scriptural, philosophical, religious, or moral\n1English Department, Najafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University,\nNajafabad, Iran\n2Department of English language, Islamic Azad University (Isfahan),\nKhorasgan Branch, Isfahan, Iran\n3Department of Computer Science, Payame Noor University (PNU),\nTehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nSara Mansouri, English Department, Najafabad Branch, Islamic Azad\nUniversity, Najafabad, Iran.\nEmail: sara-mansouri@phu.iaun.ac.ir\nNomination and Argumentation\nStrategies in Oratory Discourse:\nThe Case of an English Sermon\nSara Mansouri1, Reza Biria2, Mohammad Mohammadi Najafabadi3,\nand Susan Sattar Boroujeni1\n Keywords\nargumentation theory, critical discourse analysis, discourse\u00adhistorical approach, nomination strategies, oratory discourse,\nsermon\n2 SAGE Open\npoint and usually aims to clarify a kind of law over a wide\nperiod of time. Not surprisingly, we likewise regard the pres-\nent-day language meaning of sermon as a monolog, which in\nits mainstream sense derogatorily portrays a protracted and\nmonotonous type of discourse conveyed with incredible\nenthusiasm by any individual to an uninterested group of\nonlookers.\nCritical discourse analysis as a well-established model in\nmodern linguistics was introduced in the early 1990s under\nan opportunity provided by the University of Amsterdam to\nbring together scholars such as Van Dijk, Fairclough, Kress\nand Leeuwen, and Wodak (Wodak, 2001) to specify its dif-\nferent approaches. Critical discourse analysis considers sci-\nence to be confined but not free in different principles\n(Schiffrin, Tannen, & Hamilton, 2001); furthermore, it sees\nlanguage as a value-constructed structure (Fairclough &\nWodak, 1997). Its grand antecedent, critical linguistics, was\nstrongly influenced by the College of East Anglia in England\namid 1970s. It tried to establish a social view of linguistics\nfocusing on force connections as a focal hypothetical issue\nand text as its primary unit of analysis. Critical discourse\nanalysis incorporates discourse as the most widely used lan-\nguage specifically used by a particular group under specific\nsocial implications and qualities, for example, Muslims dis-\ncourse or Christians discourse (Flowerdew, 2013). The\ninvestigation of social issues, power relations, society, and\nculture is addressed in critical discourse analysis to fathom\nout the possible ideological and historical orientations\nembedded in texts created by their authors (Fairclough &\nThere are different approaches to critical discourse analy-\nsis (CDA) of which the most current ones are historical, cog-\nnitive, and relational- dialectic. The first one suggested by\nWodak (2001) assumes power, ideology, and history from a\ncommon ground for professionals in linguistics, semiotics,\nand discourse analysis despite the seemingly different back-\nground knowledge they advocate. This approach is problem\noriented and mainly focuses on the inquiry of changes in dis-\ncourse practice over a long period of time and across differ-\nent genres. The second is the cognitive approach adopted by\nVan Dijk (1993), whose fundamental aim was to explore rac-\nism and discrimination by examining the belief system, set-\nting, and information comprising a particular discourse.\nFinally, the third was introduced by Fairclough (1989) and\naimed to investigate important changes happening in our\nadvanced world and their impact on the general population's\nstrategies for communication.\nLiterature Review\nUtilizing Fairclough's (1989) relational\u00addialectic approach,\nGowhary, Rahimi, Azizifar, and Jamalinesari (2015) exam-\nined the Iranian presidential talks and demonstrated that the\ntargeted candidates were extraordinarily influenced by their\ndiverse political strands, making them take different positions\nin their political, social, and ideological viewpoints in por-\ntrayals, explanations, clarifications, and description of numer-\nous texts within the same topic. Dastpak and Taghinezhad\n(2015) studied the persuasion strategies in Obama's political\nspeeches demonstrating a comprehensive picture of U.S.\nsociety and the need for solidarity. In another study, Weiwei\nand Weihua (2015) examined news reports from critical dis-\ncourse analysis perspective and described how belief systems\nmay be uncovered through lexical order, transitivity, and\nchange affecting news reports as a result of social practice.\nAlternatively, Zhang's (2014) investigation of political news\nreports on Iraq war by U.S. media demonstrated that the news\nreport language is one sided and affected by social qualities\nand belief systems.\nSimilarly, Poorebrahim and Zarei (2013) considered\nIslam's delineation in western media in light of Van Dijk's\nidea of \"ideological square\" and Edward Said's thought of\n\"orientalism\" and showed that Islam and Muslims are\nadversely depicted through special constructions and linguis-\ntic choices imposed on headlines. In a different CDA study,\nBiria and Mohammadi (2012) examined Obama and Bush's\ninaugural discourse to shed light on the logical gadgets and\nverbose procedures utilized by the presidents to express their\npolitical perspectives. The writers utilized two CDA models,\nboth speakers made an objective use of positive self-presen-\ntation and negative other presentation, which were rooted in\ntheir distinct political belief systems. This methodology was\nlikewise put into practice by Keshavarz and Alimadadi\nZonoozi (2011) focusing on grammatical and lexical ele-\nments comprising the nature of the belief systems in transla-\ntion of political writings. They found that syntactic structures\nand semantic discourse strategies are fundamental devices in\nthe hand of the translator to force positive self-presentation\nand negative other presentation.\nSurprisingly, more current investigations in the field of\nCDA have prompted a recharged enthusiasm for the exami-\nnation of religious speeches. Sharaf Eldin (2014) utilized\nCDA for Amr Khalid's sermons to explore the Islamic talk\nand to locate the ideological resources taking into account\nThompson's (1990) five philosophy modes. He explained\nthat the speaker made an intelligent use of "
