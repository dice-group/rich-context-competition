Yet despite the growing literature on allotments, and\nincreasing attention to gender, there remains little attention to the spatial\ndimensions of allotment practices, particularly involving young people, and\nespecially young queer people. We offer a redescription of the YWG allotment,\nso that, as Haraway suggests `it becomes thicker than it first seems' (Haraway\nand Goodeve, 2000: 108), highlighting how the YWG allotment is an almost\nunimaginable space. In so doing we explore how the allotment project might be\nunderstood to be intensely engaged in `growing intimate publics', or what we\nterm `privatepublics'. These are paradoxical intimacies, privatepublic spaces\nwhich are not necessarily made possible in the usual private sphere of domestic\nhomes, but which materialise on an apparently public allotment site in\nManchester. These intimate privatepublics might be understood to offer a\nresourceful counter to tendencies towards privatising that which was previously\npublic (e.g. in processes of urban development and regeneration, often relying\non rather different public\u00adprivate partnerships), whilst at the same time\nappearing to bring into the public domain that which has been seen to be\nprivate and domestic: sexuality. These growing privatepublics emerge in ways\nthat create intimate private spaces in the apparently public domain, necessarily\nreconfiguring the boundaries of public and private. By exploring how young\nlesbian and bisexual women may be marginalised in both public and private\nrealms, and how a focus on questions of `public' and `private' spaces can leave\nquestions of `nature' excluded, we understand the process of materialising an\nallotment run by young lesbian and bisexual women as an `everyday utopia'\n(Cooper, 2014), through which we might understand the radical possibilities of\nQueering allotments\nWhile home gardening and allotmenting garner increasing attention, young lesbian\nand bisexual women have yet to figure in the literature (Bhatti and Church, 2000,\nmen's spaces, as a way to get away from the domestic, the feminine domestic; that\nsheds are not only for tools \u00ad they are for men and cups of tea, and escaping\nnagging wives (Crouch and Ward, 1988). Allotments, and sheds, have acted as a\nmasculine, heteronormative private sphere. Allotments have sexual politics.\nAlthough, in their classic text, The Allotment: Its Landscape and Culture, Crouch\nand Ward suggest that the stereotype of the allotment as `for men only' may never\nhave been entirely true, their reimagining of the allotment, that it `was always more\nof a family affair than was supposed', nonetheless still seems limited (1988: 90).\nReflecting on the increasing popularity of home gardening, Bhatti and Church\n(2000, 2001) identify gardens as a key site of leisure and of home-making, and one\nwhere gender relations are played out in particular ways. Johnston and Longhurst\nnote that much less attention has been focussed on sexuality and gardens, with\ndream homes in the suburbs being associated with nuclear families and a gendered\ndivision of flowers (women) and vegetables (men). They describe the `Fifth Season\ngarden group', made up of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender gardeners, who\norganised the Heroic Gardens festival in Auckland, New Zealand. They also cite an\naccount of a gay garden: `[t]o create a small kingdom \u00ad an area of sovereignty \u00ad has\nbeen an essential survival strategy. More than this, it is, in some sense, a triumph.\nCreating \u00ad as in this case, gardening \u00ad is how we stay sane' (Wells, 2000: 109 in\nBut we suggest there is much more to be said about queer gardening, and many\nmore possibilities than heroism, or a defensive queer sovereignty. Elsewhere\nLonghurst notes that gardens can both reflect and reinforce emancipatory and\noppressive power relations, noting that `[g]ardening can be a highly exclusionary\npractice' (Longhurst, 2006: 590) requiring cultural capital and money, often impli-\ncated in reinforcing (neo)colonial relations. Studies of allotments and community\ngardens where food growing occurs have also revealed how they both challenge and\nconfirm power relations. In the USA research suggests that whilst community food\ngrowing gardens can offer sites of meaning for deprived communities, these spaces\ncan also become aligned with neo-liberal gentrifying processes that seek to exclude\npoorer residents from urban redevelopment areas. The small number of studies\nthat have explored gender and food growing projects have observed how these\nspaces offer opportunities for women, often from low income backgrounds, to\nchallenge masculine approaches to gardening and enhance cultural identities\n(Buckingham, 2005; Metcalf et al., 2012). However, certain practices and activities\nin allotments, such as digging and growing particular products, are often pre-\nand Pitt (2014) found that young women in urban South Wales still view commu-\nnal food growing gardens as masculine spaces.\nIf gender and sexuality are little explored with respect to gardens, or allotments,\nthen questions of age, and specifically of young people, are rarely addressed.\nExceptions include the ideal of children growing up in nuclear families enjoying\nsuburban gardens, or more recently allotment and growing projects in schools\n(though here more commonly with young children than with teenagers). There is\nlittle association of home gardening or allotmenting with young people, except\nperhaps vandalism. Arguably one of gardening and allotmenting's exclusions\nmay be young people who are less likely to garden partly because they may lack\ntime, money and the access to gardening spaces (Mintel, 2007). In this sense allot-\nments appear as a queer space in which to find young people, and maybe an even\nqueerer space to find young queer people, reminiscent of behind the bike shed, or in\nthe closet. Crouch and Ward's account of the allotment as a `family affair' only\nconfirms that a lesbian and bisexual women's youth group appears inconceivable in\nthe space of the allotment. Yet the YWG allotment does exist, and here we seek to\nexplore what it means to materialise, to grow, a young lesbian and bisexual\nwomen's allotment. What queer privatepublic natureculture, more-than-human,\nfeminist science fiction is this?\nThe Young Women's Group allotment\nThe Young Women's Group allotment is one of the activities offered as part of a\nyouth group for lesbian and bisexual women. The Young Women's Group (YWG)\nhas been running as a peer health project since 2005, meeting approximately weekly\nin the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre just off the busy Oxford Road in central\nManchester. On the website, the group describes itself:\nWe are the Young Women's Peer Health Project run by and for young lesbian and\nbisexual women. We work to improve young lesbian and bisexual women's health by\npromoting various activities designed around six areas of wellness which are: physical,\nemotional, intellectual, spiritual, occupational and social/community. (http://\nwww.likt.org.uk/)\nThe group offers a range of activities and projects around art and crafts, politics,\nsport, and literature, and tries to respond to any requests for particular activities\nfrom within the group.\nIn 2006 the Young Women's Group took on the allotment after it was given up\nby a previous adult gay and lesbian (though in practice lesbian only) group which\nhad had the plot for a year, and which Niamh Moore had been part of. When the\nYWG took over the allotment, Niamh stayed on, and with Amelia Lee, supported\nyoung women's work at the plot. Later Claire Holmes joined and took on the work\nof Allotment Co-ordinator. Involvement in the allotment (and any of the activities\nthe group runs) is voluntary. Young women meet at the Centre and then travel\ntogether by bus or bike to the plot, which is about two miles south of the youth\ncentre. The YWG also overlaps with an LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans)\nyouth group which meets in the same youth centre, and sometimes joins the YWG\nat the allotment. The allotment is sometimes described as `LGYM Outdoors' \u00ad the\noutdoor space for Lesbian and Gay Youth Manchester (LGYM). While the plot\nwas very overgrown, and initial years were spent digging and clearing the site, after\nsome years of perseverance it is now thriving. The allotment continues to develop\nand change: it now, for example, provides produce to the community cafe\n\u00b4 set up in\nQueer privatepublics\nIn seeking to provide an account of the YWG allotment, we take up an observation\nmade by Bhatti and Church, who intriguingly noted that some of their respondents\nseek privacy in the garden, even though it is a semi-public space (Bhatti and\nChurch, 2000: 187). While allotments may seem, even more so than the garden,\nto be thoroughly public spaces, we noted that there is a lot that is still private\namong the brambles at the YWG allotment. This apparently contradictory finding\nechoes Longhurst's turn to Gillian Rose's work on `paradoxical spaces' to describe\ngardens as spaces that are `imbued with contradictions and allow for the simultan-\neous occupation of dualist categories', `troubling the binary divisions between\nnature and culture, private and public, individuality and sociality, leisure and\nexplain, the YWG allotment certainly seems to trouble existent understandings\nof public and private. We offer privatepublics as a way into understanding the\nimbrications of public and private at this site, drawing on Haraway's use of neolo-\ngisms to resist dualisms. In this we echo Haraway's turn to the possibilities of\n`naturecultures' to attend to how `all actors become who they are in the dance of\nrelating, not from scratch, not ex nihilo, but full of the patterns of their sometimes\njoined, sometimes separate heritages both before and lateral to this encounter'\n(Haraway, 2008: 25). Likewise we see privatepublics as drawing attention to the\nways in which public and private are categories that cannot be assumed in advance\nbut rather come into being in relation.\nIn turning to privatepublics we also seek to extend Berlant and Warner's work\non `sex in public' (1998). Berlant and Warner have highlighted the ways in which\ncertain privileged forms of heterosexuality have been allowed privacy while the\npublicness of queer venues such as bars, saunas and clubs was called into ques-\ntion for appearing to flaunt homosexuality. Their paper is not about `sex in\npublic' as might be commonly understood; rather they want to describe what\nthey `want to promote as the radical aspirations of queer culture building: not\njust a safe zone for queer sex but the changed possibilities of identity, intelligi-\nbility, publics, culture, and sex that appear when the heterosexual couple is no\nlonger the referent or the privileged example of sexual culture' (Berlant and\nwomen's efforts to renegotiate the possibilities of privacy in the apparently\nsemi-public spaces of the garden: we suggest that the YWG allotment offers a\nmanifestation of Berlant and Warner's queer culture building. But first we return\nto the supposed public nature of allotments.\nPublic allotments or allotments for the public?\nAllotments can seem to be thoroughly public entities. In the UK allotments are\ngenerally provided by local councils who have a statutory responsibility to make\nplots of publicly owned land available to members of the public for a small rent.\nThe controversy around the setting up of The New Allotment Company Ltd in\n2010, a private company providing allotments on the grounds that local authorities\nare not doing enough to meet public demand, suggests just how important the\nnotion of the `publicness' of allotments is.4 The New Allotment Company Ltd\ndescribes allotments not as a public good, but as an extension of the private.\nHowever, this is not framed as the extension of a private limited company into\nthe public domain, but rather as an extension of the domestic private: `[a]n allot-\nment is an area of land where fruits, vegetables and herbs are grown for you to eat\nat home. It's really an extension of the garden and the kitchen table'.5\nIn this light, it is useful to briefly trace the history of the allotment. In the UK\nthe origins of allotments are often traced to the enclosures of common land (the\ngrazing animals and gathering timber and sometimes growing crops. Following the\nInclosure Acts, the Commons Act 1876 recognised a need for land for cultivation\nby the poor. The law regarding allotments was first explicitly outlined in the Small\nHoldings and Allotments Act 1908.6 Allotments might be understood as the `illegit-\nimate offspring' of the enclosures (cf. Haraway, 1985), undermining the privatisa-\ntion of once public, common land. In this sense then, The New Allotment\nCompany Ltd is merely the latest instance of the privatisation of land in the UK\n(Ravenscroft, Church and Parker, 2012). Nonetheless private allotments are still\nuncommon in the UK; most sites are public, provided by local councils.\nAllotments, and the huge growth in interest in them, might be understood to\noffer a counter to other ways of framing the city, and its rough edges, through\nurban regeneration and rather different publicprivate partnerships.\nYet, for supposedly public sites, allotments are often curiously hidden away,\nclassically glimpsed in passing only from train windows, visible only fleetingly from\nthe corner of one's eye, there for a blurred second and gone again before they have\nquite registered, framing the city and journeys between cities, so that you might\nalmost have imagined this other higgledy-piggledy world. So we suggest that allot-\nments are also intriguingly hidden publics.\nIntroducing young women from the youth group to the allotment often throws\nup interesting questions. When one young woman, Liz, came to the allotment for\nthe first time, she said she had not actually known what an allotment was. She\nprobably wasn't the only one. So while allotments may be public, they are often\nnot just hidden from view, but may be utterly unknown entities for some. Initially\nshe seemed almost overwhelmed trying to take this new thing in, struggling to get\nsome grasp of `it'. She asked if it was `ours', belonging to the Young Women's\nGroup. Niamh explained that it was rented from the council. Nonetheless she\nrepeated `but you mean it's ours?' The answer that the allotment was rented\nfrom the council was clearly not the main point. This was not a notion of private\nproperty ownership then. Rather Liz seemed to suggest that such a rambling over-\ngrown space could appear vast, unanticipated, unimaginable, and how little there\nmight be sometimes that might be `ours'; conveying a sense of a new world opening\nup. She also said `it's all our own work'; implying a different kind of ownership, the\nownership of collective labour, where something is earned, created and materialised\ntogether. It was in fact her first visit to the allotment; although not her first time to\nthe Young Women's Group, but she already felt that she could insert herself into\nthe history, and labour, of the allotment. The transformations then are not just of\nthe `land', but of a group transformed by the force of this encounter with a scrubby\npiece of earth, reconfiguring relationships and possibilities. This quasi public\nnature seemed to offer possibilities for those often excluded from both private\nand public spaces; figuratively, and as we explore later, sometimes literally, home-\nless. So allotments are public, but somewhat hidden from view and perhaps in the\ncase of the YWG allotment, still private enough.\nPublic, but still private (enough): On (not) being `out'\nat the allotment\nBeing at the allotment might appear to mean being in public \u00ad after all, everyone\nhas left `home', the so-called private sphere, to be there. Although it is not clear\nwhat public or private might mean for those young lesbian and bisexual women in\ntheir mid to late teens and early twenties who generally (have to) inhabit someone\nelse's space; the allotment offers an alternative to the limits of `bedroom cultures'\n(McRobbie and Garber, 1976). For many home may be neither private, nor domes-\ntic, as usually understood, and at the same time young people are not always\nwelcomed in civic public spaces. The chaotic cosiness of the youth centre has\nalso been left behind, as young women travel by public transport (or bikes now)\nto the allotment. Despite the appearance of being in public, not all the group\nmembers are `out', either at home, or at the allotment. On the one hand there is\nthe shared unspoken out-ness, not necessary to say out loud; on the other hand\nthere are, for instance, conversations about going to Pride and some not going to\navoid being `seen'. In public `down the allotment' might be okay, but for some\nbeing seen at Pride might be more risky. So there is a lot that is still private in this\nhidden public among the brambles. And it's not clear what public or private means\nto those who have been, or still are, in foster care or `supported' accommodation,\nlike The Foyer, whose name suggests a public space to be passed through briefly,\nbut not inhabited, not lived in, not home, not obviously much better than a closet.7\nThe Foyer offers `a room of one's own' to young people between the ages of sixteen\nand twenty-five, who are in full-time education, though, decades later, it appears\na more cramped space than Virginia Woolf envisaged with her call for a space for\nwomen's writing ([1929] 2002). Certainly today's `benefits' for under twenty-fives\ndo not amount to 500 guineas a year. Possibly for some the allotment is as private\nas it gets. Even those young people who do, or did, live in houses with gardens\n(and possibly nuclear families) do not necessarily have access to the gardens.\nLiz recounted that her father would not let her help in the garden; although a\nfew weeks later she came back and told of asking her father about whether there\nwas anything that could be done about the horsetails (no there was not).\nThe YWG allotment then is another materialisation of possibilities, beyond\nhomes and supported accommodation, and even beyond the youth centre,\nwhich however necessary, also has its limits. The allotment has been called\n`LGYM Outdoors' \u00ad Lesbian and Gay Youth Manchester Outdoors \u00ad in recognition\nof its importance to, and relationship with, the work that goes on in the youth centre.\nAlbert Kennedy, Cath Hall and Joyce Layland:\nNames we call home\nIn a city where a young gay boy died falling from a car park roof as he was chased,\nwhere running was the only space left, it is salutary to reflect on the complexities of\nhome and on any easy assumptions that the bright lights of the city offer sanctuary\nfor LGBT people, and particularly young people. The Albert Kennedy Trust\n(AKT) is named after this sixteen-year-old, who was a runaway from a children's\nhome in Salford. The AKT was founded in 1989, a year after Albert Kennedy's\ndeath, by Cath Hall, a foster carer who was working with Manchester's LGBT\nyouth group at the time. Hall recognised the need for support for young LGBT\npeople who were homeless or in a housing crisis, acknowledging that neither par-\nental homes, nor so-called care homes, were necessarily adequate for the needs of\nyoung LGBT people.8\nIn a city, like many other places around the world, where young people are\nkicked out of home or flee before they are kicked and more (again and again); in a\ncity which is the supposedly safe landing point after a smuggled journey out of\n`other' countries where it is not safe to be gay, it is not insignificant that the LGBT\nCentre was renamed the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre, after the mother of a young\ngay man who helped found the original centre.9 When her son came out to her as\ngay, Joyce Layland did not kick him out of home; rather it seems that she recog-\nnised her limits and perhaps also a sense of responsibility, and the needs of her son\nfor other safe spaces. When she found that, even in a city with a large lesbian and\ngay population, there were no specific facilities for LGBT young people, she went\nabout setting some up. That a mother recognised that she was not enough, that\n(one) home is sometimes not enough, and was not threatened by this but rather\nsought to expand the places her son might call safe, is a significant story. Yet to\ndomesticate the youth centre as another home for young people would perhaps be\nto miss part of the point; the name is intentional \u00ad a message to other parents that\nthere are options beyond kicking your child out of their home. The story of the\nname of the building gets told and retold because it serves a very important\npolitical purpose. The dangers to young LGBT people are not only flying through\nthe air, the dangers include the multiple displacements that put young people `on\nthe street'. The Joyce Layland LGBT Centre offers a kind of home to young people\nwho may, or may not, have other options, but it also reminds parents not to make\ntheir children homeless, and so is as much a role model, an ideal, for parents.\nJust as homes are not always enough, sometimes too the youth centre is also not\nenough; it is often noisy and full of chaos. The allotment offers yet another space of\npossibility. The beds, and the work of weeding them while hunkered down in the\npaths between, offer a cramped, constrained, but big enough space for conversa-\ntions to spill out, sometimes loud and noisy and shared, sometimes quiet and low\nand private, sometimes conversations that cannot quite happen in the youth centre\nbecause there is not quite enough space there.\nIt was at the allotment for instance that H took out a carefully folded-up letter,\nto show those present her offer of a place on a course at a local university, where\nshe made everyone read all the words, where she shared her excitement, hopes and\nfears, about how she would be able to manage, this life that she once never ima-\ngined, that was never imagined for her, that she had to work hard at to imagine\ninto being. And a place at university meant she would be around for at least\nanother three years, and be able to stay involved with the allotment. As well as\nstarting her university course, she also took a course at a local community garden\ncentre, so that she could learn more about growing vegetables organically.\nSo it was quite a shock when she announced she was getting an allotment of her\nown. Such apparent individualism seemed so contrary to the ethos of a collective\nproject. But H's new plot was adjacent to the YWG plot. It was less about cutting\nties and going it alone, than stretching one's toes just a little, growing into a more\nexpansive project. And in any case, it was like the YWG plot at the beginning, huge\nand hugely overgrown, so the plan was to share tools and labour and help her clear\nit. And, after all, Claire, the Allotment Co-ordinator, and Niamh actually had\nallotments of their `own'; though these were with partners and friends. Indeed,\nClaire gave up her plot at another site and got one just along from the YWG\nallotment to make it easier to work both plots. While Niamh moved house and\ngot an allotment elsewhere, she still `came back', even though this meant a two to\nthree hour round trip by inconvenient trains and buses, or a twenty-mile bike ride\neach way. So an allotment of one's own was hardly about cutting ties with the\nYWG allotment (perhaps more a desire for vegetables of our own, for even more\npossibilities of growing), and the boundaries between plots not so distinct as tools,\nseeds and labour are shared back and forth. These boundaries were made literally\neven more fluid one day when a plan for a day's solid digging was undone. When H\narrived she found hundreds of tadpoles swimming in an inch of water in the creases\nof a sheet of plastic covering the ground of her plot. There had been a plan for the\nday, but it unravelled in the moments of standing around the sheet of plastic in the\nrare burning sun in Manchester, silently watching the teeming life, and contemplat-\ning what had been plotted for the day, and what to do now, as if there was\nany decision to make. Then two were sent off to get a pond liner while everyone\nelse dug a pond on the putative borders of the plots, moved by the `significant\notherness' (Gabb, 2011) of the tadpoles still wriggling furiously in the water.\nQueer naturecultures\nIn turning to privatepublics to understand allotment life we are referencing Donna\nHaraway's `naturecultures'. Our aim here is to draw attention to the ways in which\nprivatepublics and naturecultures are entangled. A focus on public/private dualism,\nwith private signalling the domestic, and public often conjuring up civic, urban\nspaces, has often meant that nature disappears from consideration. Yet the queer-\nnaturecultures of the allotment bring privatepublics back into view.\nDavid Bell's (2010) account of `queernaturecultures' includes the utopian pastor-\nalism of Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter, as well as lesbian separatist com-\nmunes, radical faeries, and phenomena such as the popularity of the film Brokeback\nMountain (2005) and the practice of dogging. Histories of lesbian land, of les-\nbian separatist communities, of efforts to make space for women and a relationship\nwith land, can be considered part of the genealogy of the YWG allotment\nqueer natures are often counters to assumptions that cities offer the appropriate\nliberatory space for gay politics, against the supposed conservatism of the rural.\nOne of the ongoing challenges for feminists and queers is the apparently\ndoubled-nature of nature. Nature has been understood as that which is other\nthan human, as the non-human. Yet nature is also that which is precisely the\nessence of being human, as in `human nature'. For feminists questions of\n`women's nature' have often become more troubling when women are seen to be\n`in' or `for' nature. Thus lesbian separatists creating lesbian land are often held up\nas paradigmatic essentialists, even while they are engaged in the intense labour of\nbuilding women's culture. Similarly when feminists are also environmentalists,\nnot only `in' nature, but `for' nature, they too are often vilified as essentialists,\nas eco/feminists have discovered to their cost (Moore, 2014).\nHaraway's work, and that of (other) eco/feminists, has been useful for troubling\nany notion that humans are separate from nature, or that human nature might be\nbest understood as about deterministic essences. Haraway directly addressed the\nquestion of nature in `The Promises of Monsters: A Regenerative Politics for\nInappropriate/d Others', where she proposed that `nature is made, but not entirely\nby humans; it is a co-construction among humans and non-humans' (1992: 298).\nShe argued:\nSo, nature is not a physical place to which one can go, nor a treasure to fence in or\nbank, nor as essence to be saved or violated. Nature is not hidden and so does not\nneed to be unveiled. Nature is not a text to be read in the codes of mathematics and\nbiomedicine. It is not the `other' who offers origin, replenishment, and service. Neither\nmother, nurse, nor slave, nature is not matrix, resource, or tool for the reproduction of\nman. [. . .] Nature is also a tropos, a trope. It is figure, construction, artifact,\nmovement, displacement. Nature cannot pre-exist its construction. [. . .] Nature is a\ntopic of public discourse on which much turns, even the earth. (Haraway, 1992: 296)\nHaraway usefully implodes any separation of nature and culture, alongside any\nnotion of nature's passivity \u00ad while insisting that the public is a key site for rework-\ning nature/s.\nThis attention to the public is taken up in David Bell's (2010) use of `queer-\nnaturecultures' to address `the nature of our sexual natures' (Weeks, 1991: 86, cited\nin Bell, 2010: 134), to think through the nature of sex and the sex of nature. While\nthe focus here is on questions of sexuality, rather than sex per se, Bell's work clearly\nremains pertinent. Both Haraway and Bell pick up on the questions of publics.\nHaraway suggests, perhaps counter-intuitively for some, that nature is `the place to\nrebuild public culture' (1992: 296). Bell concludes his reflections on queernature-\ncultures with a series of questions: what does it mean to talk about the publicness\nof nature? And if we can speak of more-than-human publics, what does that mean\nfor the politics of nature and the politics of sex (Bell, 2010: 144)? While Bell is\naddressing the naturalisation of sex, alongside its `relegation' to the private sphere,\nhere we focus on the limits of the public, through suggesting how allotments undo\nneat distinctions between public and private, nature and culture, rural and urban,\ndomestic and civic.\nGrowing intimate privatepublic naturecultures:\nThe YWG allotment as `everyday utopia'\nSo what does it mean to materialise, to grow, a young lesbian and bisexual\nwomen's allotment? What queer privatepublic natureculture, more-than-human,\nfeminist science fiction is this? We suggest here that it means to make something\nup, to imagine something into being that does not exist, or only barely exists,\nthreatening to disappear any second. The allotment might be seen as a site of\nwhat Davina Cooper terms `everyday utopia' \u00ad `sites and spaces which aspire to\naccomplish some routine aspect of social life in a more democratic, equal or freer\nfashion'.\nThere is little explicitly said within the Young Women's Group about what a\nlesbian and bisexual women's allotment might mean. But the process of producing\nYouTube videos as part of a research project allowed new conversations to\nemerge.10 In the YouTube videos there is a repetition of the allotment as a space\napart from the stress of other daily life, which, for a few hours, recedes; a space for\nregeneration all round. Typical of this is the following exchange between four\nyoung women in a focus group after the making of the videos, in response to a\nprompt about what about the allotment makes them happy:\nI think it makes me a lot happier when I go to do other things. Like it's like a thing at\nthe end of the week like. It's fine, I can do all of this hard work' cause I'll get to spend\nfour hours on the allotment on some days.\nIt's very therapeutic. So like weeding and weeding [all laugh] and yes, more weeding\n[all laugh] and, you know, just kind of just getting really stuck in. I think it gives you\nthat head space where, you know, you're able to kind of relieve maybe some kind of\ntroubles and then you come out feeling refreshed, renewed and ready to carry on.\nI think it's like for me, it gives me that sense of having a group which I feel comfort-\nable in and kind of that whole thing of community or our own little community . . . it\nmakes me happy [laughs].\nIn this conversation there are the `shadows' of other aspects of lives, other\nworlds, which do not appear to be so nourishing. Ecofeminist philosopher,\nVal Plumwood, used the term `shadow places' to reference north/south inequal-\nities. Plumwood was reworking the grounding of environmental ethics in a\nreified `sense of place', and suggested that what was needed in its stead was\n`an ethic of place' (see also de la Bellacasa, 2012). She suggested that the reifi-\ncation of place in much environmental discourse requires the privileging of one's\nown place and relationships, at the expense of other `hidden places' (Plumwood,\ndiscourses of place and belonging marginalise denied, dislocated and dispossessed\nidentities, privileging `the self-identical and well-rooted ones who have natural\nto maintain access (unproblematically) to a special homeplace and to protect it not at\nleast partly a function of one's privilege/power in the world. (2008: 140)\nGiven Plumwood's attention to interlocking matrices of oppression, she would\nlikely not have objected to using shadow places to think through the implications\nof heteronormative places and their shadow lands. Indeed such an account is\nimplicit in her commentary on the recent attention to the figure of the child:\nI am not of course arguing that there's necessarily anything wrong with loving a\nspecial place, or that justice demands that we each love and care for all places equally,\nany more than it requires one love one's child only as much as all other children and\nno more. But justice does require that we take some account of other children, and of\nour own and our child's relationship to them, perhaps even that we not aim to have\nour child thrive at the expense of these other children. (Plumwood, 2008: 147)\nThis version of an ecofeminist maternal ethic of care offers something quite other\nthan `reproductive futurism' (Edelman, 2004). With her call for more multiple\nrelationships to place against a `monogamous ideal' (Plumwood, 2008: 147) of\nrelationships with singular and special places, Plumwood's ecofeminist ethic and\npolitics of place was already queer. It is the kind of queer ethic of place/home which\nJoyce Layland articulated and which is carried on in the visionary practices of\nprofessional youth and community workers like Sally Carr, Claire Holmes,\nAmelia Lee and many others who continue Joyce Layland's work. As feminists\nhave long noted, home is a difficult space for many women. As Caren Kaplan\narticulates it:\nWe must leave home, as it were, because our homes are often the sites of sexism,\nracism, and other damaging social practices. Where we come to locate ourselves in\nterms of our specific histories and differences must be a place with room for what can\nbe salvaged from the past and what can be made new. What we gain is a reterritor-\nEco/feminists might stress that the `our' of `a world of our making' is not all\nhuman.\nThis everyday utopia offers not a reified sense of place, but as Davina Cooper\nhas articulated:\nthe movement of members between everyday utopias and a wide array of other\nsites \u00ad indeed the interwoven character of the sites themselves in their multiple\nentangled relationships to other places and process \u00ad highlights a crucial dimension\nof everyday utopias. Far from offering totalizing expressions of what an ideal self-\nsufficient life could be, everyday utopias are more akin to hot spots of innovative\nThe YWG allotment was never intended to sustain a nuclear family of four. It is\nnot even clear if the plot has managed to sustain the hedgehog that came to the\nallotment from a hedgehog sanctuary (though, more precisely, it was never likely\nthat the hedgehog needed us in any case, but we hope he is living happily some-\nwhere amongst the undergrowth). For a long time, it was not possible to pretend\nthat the vegetables were sustaining anyone, although the idea, the promise, of\nvegetables, gathered young and older women together at the allotment, even\nthose who say on video that they `don't like veg', for the hard work of digging,\nand digging, and more digging. Nonetheless, the ambitions for the plot change and\ngrow, from being `LGYM Outdoors', to bringing fruit and vegetables back to the\nCentre and cooking and eating together; to supporting the new Sidney Street\nCommunity Cafe11 and creating opportunities for training and employment; to a\nrearticulation of the work at the allotment as a transgenerational project; and a\ntransformed notion of the interconnections which might be community.\nIn seeking to create alternatives to Manchester's gay scene, not only spaces for\nyoung people, but also alternatives to the scene, the YWG, and the allotment, offer\na manifestation of Berlant and Warner's call for a queer culture that would make\nroom for `the development of kinds of intimacy that bear no necessary relation to\ndomestic space, to kinship, to the couple form, to property, or to the nation'\n(Berlant and Warner, 1998: 558). We suggest that the YWG allotment offers a\nqueer eco/feminist re-vision (cf. Rich, 1979) of Virginia Woolf's A Room of\nOne's Own (Woolf, 2002), anticipated by Alice Walker in In Search of Our\nMothers' Gardens (Walker, 1983). This vision pushes the possibilities of a room of\none's own, of a garden of one's own, even of Our Bodies, Ourselves (Boston\nWomen's Health Collective, 1973), to encompass an allotment, and a demand\nfor a whole joined up planet, a queer ethic of place, a worlding of privatepublic\nnaturecultures. A world where, for a short while, the blur of the allotment from the\ntrain window is reversed and the view from, and the experience of, the allotment\nallows a recentring, so the rest of the world, the rest of the week, a shadow world,\ntemporarily recedes into the corner of one's eye, and for a while a different world,\nan everyday utopia of an almost unimaginable intimate privatepublic naturecul-\nture, comes into being.\n"
