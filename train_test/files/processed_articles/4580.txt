To test whether GFAP itself can serve as a\nbiomarker of disease status or progression, we investigated\ntwo independent measures of GFAP expression in AxD mouse\nmodels, one using a genetic reporter of promoter activity and\nthe other quantifying GFAP protein directly in a manner that\ncould also be employed in human studies. Using a trans-\ngenic reporter line that expresses firefly luciferase under the\ncontrol of the murine Gfap promoter (Gfap-luc), we found\nthat luciferase activity reflected the regional CNS (central\nnervous system) variability of Gfap mRNA in Gfap+ / + mice,\nand increased in mice containing a point mutation in Gfap\nthat mimics a common human mutation in AxD (R239H in\nthe human sequence, and R236H in the murine sequence).\nIn a second set of studies, we quantified GFAP protein in CSF\n(cerebrospinal fluid) taken from three different AxD mouse\nmodels and littermate controls. GFAP levels in CSF were in-\ncreased in all three AxD models, in a manner corresponding\nto the concentrations of GFAP in brain. These studies demon-\nstrate that transactivation of the Gfap promoter is an early\nand sustained indicator of the disease process in the mouse.\nFurthermore, GFAP in CSF serves as a potential biomarker\nthat is comparable between mouse models and human\npatients.\n",

The mu-\ntations appear to act in a gain-of-function fashion, with a rise\nin GFAP levels above a toxic threshold serving as a key step in\npathogenesis (Brenner et al., 2009). However, the mecha-\nnisms underlying the accumulation of GFAP are not com-\npletely understood. Studies from cell culture models impli-\ncate impaired degradation through the proteasomal pathway\nas one cause of GFAP increase, despite a near simultaneous\nanalysis of both human tissues and mouse models reveal\ngesting that increased synthesis could also contribute to an\naccumulation of GFAP protein. Given the very slow turnover\nrate for GFAP protein (Chiu and Goldman, 1984; Morrison\nchanges in GFAP promoter activity and increased synthe-\nsis would have long-lasting effects. GFAP accumulation may\nalso exacerbate pathology through the formation of positive\nfeedback loops that impact both synthesis and degradation\nRegulation of GFAP expression occurs primarily at the\nlevel of GFAP transcription, rather than through alterations\nin mRNA stability or translational efficiency (Brenner, 1994).\nWhether the changes in GFAP mRNA noted above reflect\nfeedback stimulation of Gfap promoter activity is not known.\nP.L. Jany, T.L. Hagemann and A. Messing\nMethods for investigating promoter activity in vivo have been\ngreatly facilitated by the development of transgenic models\nthat carry reporter genes under the control of cell-specific\nregulatory elements (Cui et al., 1994). One such reporter is\nthe Gfap-luc mouse, which expresses the firefly luciferase\ngene under the control of a 12 kb 5 flanking region from\nthe murine Gfap gene (Zhu et al., 2004). These mice have\npreviously been shown to exhibit increases in luciferase ac-\ntivity in response to a variety of insults or diseases that also\nresult in astrogliosis and raised levels of GFAP mRNA, includ-\ning kainic acid-induced seizures (Zhu et al., 2004), bacterial\ninfection (Kadurugamuwa et al., 2005), inflammation (Luo\nuney\nand expression of mutant APP (amyloid precursor protein)\nWith the goal of identifying indicators of disease sever-\nity and progression that could be easily monitored in mouse\nmodels of AxD, we sought to test whether the Gfap-luc re-\nporter is responsive to the novel genetic injury represented by\nthe expression of mutant GFAP. We also tested the hypothe-\nsis that the elevations in GFAP protein previously detected in\nbrain parenchyma are also reflected at the level of CSF (cere-\nbrospinal fluid), a site that is readily amenable to biopsy in hu-\nman patients and in which increased GFAP has been observed\nin AxD patients (Kyllerman et al., 2005). We found distinct\nvariations in GFAP expression and response to AxD mutations\nin different brain regions of the mouse models. Increased ac-\ntivity from the Gfap-luc reporter is evident at the whole\nbrain level as soon as 14 days after birth and this increase is\nsustained through at least 6 months of age. We also found\nthat GFAP is detectable at low levels in the CSF of control\nmice, but is elevated in three different AxD models to degrees\ncorresponding to the amount of GFAP accumulation in brain.\nMice\nThe experiments described here were approved by the An-\nimal Care and Use Committee for the Graduate School at\nthe University of Wisconsin, Madison. The GfapR236H/ + and\nGfapR76H/ + lines of mice contain knock-in mutations at the\nendogenous Gfap locus that are homologous to common\nhuman AxD-associated mutations (R239H and R79H, respec-\ntively) (Hagemann et al., 2006). The GFAPTg mice are a trans-\ngenic line (Tg73.7) that overexpresses wild-type human GFAP\n(Messing et al., 1998). The Gfap-luc mice are a transgenic line\nthat expresses firefly luciferase under the control of a 12 kb\nmurine Gfap promoter (Zhu et al., 2004). Gfaptm1Mes mice\ncarry a null mutation at the Gfap locus (McCall et al., 1996),\nand were used as negative controls in the validation of the\nGFAP ELISA (see below). All mice were maintained in the\nFVB/N background and were housed under a 14\u00ad10 light\u00ad\ndark cycle with ad libitum access to food. Samples were col-\nlected from mice at 8 weeks of age. Brains were either divided\nsagittally into two equal halves, or dissected into individual\nregions [olfactory bulb, frontal cortex (anterior to Bregma,\ndorsal grey matter containing little or no white matter), hip-\npocampus, cerebellum and brain stem] along with cervical\nspinal cord. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitro-\ngen and stored at - 80C until further processing.\nQuantification of Gfap promoter activity\nGfap-luc transgenic mice were used as indirect reporters of\nGfap promoter activity. Firefly luciferase activity was quanti-\nfied using the Dual-Glo luciferase kit (Promega), according to\nthe manufacturer's directions. Briefly, tissues were homoge-\nnized in reporter lysis buffer (125 mg tissue per ml buffer),\nnatant taken for analysis. An aliquot of this supernatant\n(40 l for half brains, 20 l for smaller pieces) was diluted\n1:1 in firefly luciferase reagent and allowed it to incubate\ntensity was then determined with a GloRunner Microplate\nLuminometer (Turner Biosystems). A separate aliquot was as-\nsayed for total protein using a BCA Protein Assay kit with\nBSA as a standard (Thermo Scientific). Values are expressed\nin arbitrary luminescent units per mg protein.\nQuantification of Gfap mRNA\nTissues were homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) ac-\ncording to the manufacturer's directions. cDNA was synthe-\nsized using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the man-\nufacturer's protocol. Specific transcripts were then quantified\nby real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green Master Mix and an\nApplied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR system as described\npreviously (Hagemann et al., 2005). Primer sets were the fol-\nlowing: Gfap (forward: 5 -CAACGTTAAGCTAGCCCTGGACAT-\n3 , reverse: 5 -CTCACCATCCCGCATCTCCACAGT-3 ), 18S ri-\nbosomal RNA (forward: 5 -CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCT-3 ,\nreverse: 5 -CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT-3 ) and TATA-box-\nbinding protein (forward 5 -GCACAGGAGCCAAGAGTGA-3 ,\nreverse 5 -CCCACCATGTTCTGGATCTT-3 ). Gfap transcript lev-\nels were normalized to both the 18S ribosomal and TATA-\nbox-binding protein RNAs. Both normalizations yielded simi-\nlar results. Data shown were normalized to the 18S ribosomal\nCollection of CSF\nCSF was collected from mice according to the method of\nDeMattos et al. (2002). Mice were anaesthetized with avertin\nsion was made over the dorsal aspect of the hindbrain and\nthree muscle layers carefully peeled back to expose the cis-\nterna magna.

Approximately\n10 l of CSF was collected per animal, and stored at - 80C\nuntil further processing.\nQuantification of GFAP protein\nBrain samples were homogenized (w/v, 1:16) in 2% SDS,\nblocSC (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1\u00d7 Complete Proteinase In-\nhibitor (Roche) using a Geno/Grinder tissue homogenizer\n(SPEX CertiPrep). After homogenization, samples were boiled\nfor 15 min. Samples were then diluted in PBS (Fisher, #BP399-\n4) and protein concentration determined using a BCA Protein\nAssay kit with BSA as a standard (Pierce). This same diluted\nsample was then used for the GFAP ELISA as described below.\nGFAP protein was quantified using a sandwich ELISA as\npreviously described (Petzold et al., 2004; Hagemann et al.,\n2009), with minor modifications. Briefly, a microtitre plate\n(Nunc MaxiSorp) was coated with a cocktail of monoclonal\nantibodies (Covance, SMI-26R) diluted in PBS (Fisher). Plates\nwere blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk\npowder in PBS before addition of samples or standards diluted\n#A7030). Antibody incubation steps were performed in 5%\n(w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder\u00adPBS, and washing\nsteps were performed in PBS\u00adTween 20 (without BSA). Stan-\ndard curves were generated using bovine GFAP (Fitzgerald\nIndustries International, # RDI-PRO62007) diluted in PBS\u00ad\n1% BSA. Assay volumes consisted of 100 l per well when\nanalysing brain samples or 50 l per well when analysing CSF.\nSamples were diluted with PBS\u00adTween 20\u00adBSA as needed to\nbring their GFAP values within the linear range of the stan-\ndard curve.\nIn the case of CSF samples from controls, which typically\nhad low levels of GFAP, the dilutions required to bring the\nreaction volume up to the minimum 100 l for duplicate\nwells often meant that the values fell below the BLD (bi-\nological limit of detection) (see below). We therefore used\npooled samples for controls, replicated as four independent\nsets derived from 3\u00ad4 animals per group, and diluted a mini-\nmal amount (36 l CSF + 64 l ELISA buffer). Mice from the\nAxD models had high-enough levels of GFAP to allow di-\nwashing, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako, # Z334) was\nused to detect the GFAP followed by a peroxidase conju-\ngated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma, # A6154).\nThe peroxidase activity was detected with SuperSignal ELISA\nPico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Thermo Scientific)\nand quantified with a GloRunner Microplate Luminometer\n(Turner Biosystems). GFAP values for the brain samples were\nexpressed as per mg total protein and for the CSF samples as\nng/l.\nUnder these conditions the lower limit of detection (de-\nfined as three S.D. above the mean of replicate blank samples)\nwas 11 ng/l, and the BLD (defined as the lower limit of detec-\ntion plus three S.D. of a known low-concentration sample)\nintra-assay COV (coefficient of variation), determined using\nthe bovine GFAP standard at 33 ng/l in ten sets of triplicate\nwells, was 13%. The inter-assay COV, determined from the\npooled CSF samples taken from GFAPTg mice (with values\nhigher on the standard curve), divided into multiple iden-\ntical aliquots to allow ten independent assays on different\ndays, was 11%. Samples from Gfap-null mice give readings\nthat are below the BLD in this assay (results not shown), thus\nvalidating its specificity.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the comparisons of Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and\nprotein shown in Figure 2, data were first log transformed\n[Y = log(Y)] to equalize the S.D. (the Figure shows the orig-\ninal untransformed data) and then analysed using a two-\nway ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. All\nother data analyses used a one-way ANOVA with post-\nhoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests between GfapR236H/ + and\nGfap+ / + . The error shown for the fold-changes between\nGfapR236H/ + and Gfap+ / + mice in Figure 2 is the calculated\npropagated error for each data point. The CSF analysis also\nrequired log transformation of the data to equalize the S.D.,\nand was then analysed using a one-way ANOVA with post-\nhoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests.\nRESULTS\nGfap promoter activity, mRNA and protein vary\nby brain regions in Gfap+ / + mice\nWe sought to test whether Gfap-luc transgenic reporter mice,\nwhich express the firefly luciferase under the control of the\nmurine Gfap promoter, thus serving as an indirect monitor\nof promoter activity, faithfully reflect the regional varia-\ntion in GFAP expression that is known to exist in the rodent\nCNS (central nervous system). In Gfap-luc transgenics that\nare wild-type at the Gfap locus (Gfap+ / + ), luciferase activity\nwas highest in the spinal cord, intermediate in olfactory bulb,\nhippocampus and brain stem, and lowest in cerebral cortex\nand cerebellum (Figure 1A). For comparison, we measured\nGfap mRNA levels in these same regions, and found that\nspinal cord and brain stem had the highest levels, and cere-\nbellum and cerebral cortex the lowest (Figure 1B). Total GFAP\nprotein levels, as measured by ELISA, followed essentially the\nsame pattern as mRNA (Figure 1C). Hence, luciferase activity\nfrom the reporter mice mirrored relative mRNA and protein\nlevels for all regions that were examined, with the exception\nof brain stem.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nP.L.

The largest fold-increase of Gfap\npromoter activity was in the olfactory bulb (7.6 +\nthe smallest in cerebellum (2.1 +\n- 0.4), with intermediate\nchanges for the other regions. Quantification of Gfap mRNA\nlevels in the same mice revealed fold changes similar to those\nfound for promoter activity in olfactory bulb, hippocampus,\ncerebral cortex and cerebellum, and more modest increases\nin brain stem and spinal cord.\nFigure 2 Levels of Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and protein in\nGfapR236H/ + mice compared with Gfap+ / + mice\nA comparison of the fold changes seen in Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and\nprotein shows that all three are reflective of the other except in spinal cord\nand brain stem (two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni t-test; ns, not\nsignificant; **P < 0.01;*** P < 0.001 compared with wild-type). Presented as\nan average fold-change +\n- 1 S.D. on log 2 scale (n = 3\u00ad6 per genotype, males).\nWe then measured total GFAP protein levels in the same\nbrain regions from Gfap mutant compared with wild-type\nmice. As previously described (Hagemann et al., 2006; LaPash\nDaniels et al., 2012), both olfactory bulb and hippocampus\ndisplayed substantially increased levels of GFAP (40-fold +\nfor olfactory bulb; 30 +\n- 3 for hippocampus), but well be-\nyond the fold changes observed for promoter activity and\nmRNA. Cerebellar GFAP increased by a modest amount, com-\nmensurate with the changes in promoter activity and mRNA.\nInterestingly, the two regions of the CNS with the highest\nbasal levels of GFAP protein in wild-type mice, brain stem\nand spinal cord (see Figure 1C), displayed marked discrep-\nancies between promoter activity/mRNA levels and protein\nlevels when evaluated in the GfapR236H/ + mutants. Although\npromoter activity increased about 5-fold in both the brain\nstem and the spinal cord, mRNA levels increased by a lesser\namount, and protein remained unchanged in brain stem and\nactually decreased in spinal cord. Hence, when examined in\nthe context of the injury response associated with expression\nof mutant GFAP, the precise relationships between promoter\nactivity, transcription and protein accumulation is complex\nand varies considerably between different regions of the CNS.\nInduction of Gfap promoter and increase in\nmRNA is not affected by gender\nPrevious studies have implicated oestrogens in the hormonal\nregulation of GFAP expression (Laping et al., 1994; Stone\nCho et al., 2010). We therefore tested whether the changes\nin Gfap promoter activity and mRNA observed in the con-\ntext of the R236H point mutation were influenced by gen-\nder. However, none of the regions examined showed any\ndifferences between males and females [olfactory bulb illus-\ntrated in Figure 3, other regions (results not shown)].\n84 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGFAP expression in Alexander disease models\nFigure 3 Gfap promoter and mRNA levels by gender\nWhile Gfap promoter activity and mRNA are elevated in GfapR236H/ + mice\ncompared with Gfap+ / + , the effect is similar in males and females in olfactory\nbulb (illustrated) as well as in other brain regions (results not shown).

Using\na different luciferase assay, we examined mice at 6 months\nof age, and found that elevated promoter activity was still\nevident (results not shown).\nGFAP in CSF of Gfap mutant and GFAP\ntransgenic mice\nIn pilot studies of CSF from individual control mice using\nstandard dilutions required to reach minimal assay reaction\nvolumes (see the Materials and Methods section), one-third\nof the samples yielded values that were below the BLD of the\nassay.

Messing\nFigure 5 GFAP protein in CSF of mouse models of AxD\nGFAP is elevated in CSF of all three mouse models of AxD (GfapR76H/ + ,\nGfapR236H/ + and GFAPTg) compared with Gfap+ / + controls. Presented as\nmeans +\n- 1 S.D. on a split linear scale (n = 9\u00ad14, males). (One-way ANOVA\nWhat accounts for this increase is not clearly understood, al-\nthough changes in the rates of both degradation and synthe-\nsis have been proposed (Messing and Brenner, 2013). Whether\ndocumented elevations in GFAP mRNA can be accounted for\nby increased activity of the GFAP promoter has not previ-\nously been addressed, and whether the putative changes in\npromoter activity and increases in protein can be exploited\nfor drug discovery and clinical studies is also not known. Here\nwe demonstrate, using several mouse models of AxD, that the\nactivity of the murine Gfap promoter is indeed increased as\nan early and sustained response following the expression of\nmutant GFAP in vivo. Furthermore, we find that the levels\nof GFAP in CSF increase, roughly in parallel with the degree of\nincrease present in brain. These results provide a foundation\non which to build future studies seeking to interfere with the\ntoxic increase in GFAP as a therapeutic goal (Messing et al.,\nActivation of the GFAP promoter with resulting increase in\nsynthesis is considered a fundamental property of reactive as-\ntrocytes. Although the precise mechanisms mediating this in-\ncrease are still topics of active investigation, numerous stud-\nies suggest that at least some of the regulatory elements for\nthe reactive response lie within a 2.2 kb fragment of the 5 re-\ngion of the gene. Previous studies from our laboratory utilized\nthis 2.2 kb human GFAP promoter construct to create dual\nluciferase reporter mice for monitoring of GFAP promoter\nactivity, and in crosses of these luciferase reporters with the\nGfapR236H/ + mutants we found only a modest increase in lu-\nciferase activity, which disappeared by 8 weeks of age (Cho\net al., 2009). In contrast, the Gfap-luc mouse utilized in the\npresent study, which differs from our dual luciferase mouse\nin several respects, reports a much larger and sustained in-\ncrease in promoter activity. In addition, the fold-increase in\nluciferase activity more closely resembles the fold change\nin mRNA levels, suggesting as well that the predominant\nregulation of GFAP expression occurs at the level of tran-\nscriptional activation.\nThe degree to which elevated levels of GFAP protein per se\nprovide the initial stimulus leading to promoter activation is\nnot yet clear. Future studies will examine the response of the\nGfap-luc reporter in transgenic lines that overexpress wild-\ntype rather than mutant GFAP, although it will be important\nto closely match the levels of GFAP protein between lines.\nIt is possible that mutant GFAP acts in essentially the same\nmanner as wild-type, but more efficiently and at lower levels\nof overexpression.\nThat expression of GFAP varies considerably in different\nregions of the CNS and in different populations of astro-\ncytes is well known. For instance, both mouse and human\ndata reveal the highest levels of both mRNA and protein\nin spinal cord and brain stem, followed in descending or-\nder by hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and cerebral\nrats found cerebellum to be higher than hippocampus (Martin\nand O'Callaghan, 1995). The reasons for these differences are\nnot clear, but could reflect variations in either the number\nor composition of astrocyte sub-types among regions. Re-\ncent studies of human astrocytes differentiated in vitro from\nembryonic stem cells reveal that those induced to a `cau-\ndalized' phenotype through exposure to retinoic acid express\nhigher levels of GFAP than those following the default rostral\npathway of differentiation (Krencik et al., 2011). Our studies\nsupport the idea that regulation of GFAP levels occurs pri-\nmarily at the level of transcription, as originally proposed by\nBrenner (1994), with a notable exception being spinal cord of\nthe GFAP mutants. It is interesting that while the type I form\nof AxD is characterized by predominance of forebrain lesions,\nthe type II form shifts to a hindbrain distribution, with many\nadult-onset patients experiencing atrophy of the medulla and\nWhy GFAP should appear in the CSF is not at all clear.\nStudies in a wide variety of human disorders document el-\nevations of GFAP that are typically attributed to cell death,\nalthough most of these studies also find detectable levels\neven in healthy controls (Liem and Messing, 2009). One pos-\nsibility is that GFAP, despite being a cytoskeletal protein,\nis normally secreted from astrocytes, as has been found to\noccur for vimentin from macrophages (Mor-Vaknin et al.,\n2003). Studies of the astrocyte secretome have largely uti-\nlized cell cultures and are complicated by the problem of\ncorrecting for contamination by cytoplasmic contents \u00ad most\nreports finding that vimentin and not GFAP is secreted (Del-\nDowell et al.

The amount of GFAP present in the CSF\nof GFAPTg mice is sufficiently high as to be detectable by mass\nspectrometry, thus opening new possibilities for methods\nof quantification and characterization (Cunningham et al.,\nA major problem facing therapeutic research is the iden-\ntification of suitable biomarkers that reflect key pathways of\ndisease and could be responsive to drugs or other types of\ntreatment. The response of the Gfap-luc reporter mouse\nclearly demonstrates transactivation of the Gfap promoter,\nperhaps as a final common pathway in the putative posi-\ntive feedback loops that lead to toxic accumulation of GFAP\n(Messing et al., 2012). Activation of the Gfap promoter may\nalso represent a step in pathogenesis that is amenable to\ndrug discovery or screening efforts (Cho et al., 2010; Messing\net al., 2010). In addition, the elevation of GFAP that occurs\nin CSF may prove useful as a biomarker of disease severity\nor progression in clinical studies of AxD. Indeed, Kyllerman\net al. (2005) studied three patients, each of whom exhibited\nmarkedly elevated levels in their CSF compared with con-\ntrols. A study of CSF levels of GFAP in a larger cohort of\nAxD patients is currently underway, along with an evalua-\ntion of blood levels. The validation of biomarkers that occur\nboth in human patients as well as animal models will greatly\nfacilitate the evaluation of candidate therapies in the future.\n"
