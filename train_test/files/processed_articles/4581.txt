    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent quantitative research has identified similar detrimental effects on victims of cyberstalking as those that arise from\ntraditional stalking. The current study thematically analyzed one hundred victim narratives gathered by means of an online\nsurvey with a view to assessing the mental health and well-being implications of the experience of cyberstalking. Coping\nstrategies employed by victims and the perceived effectiveness of each strategy were also explored. The findings suggest that\nthe emotional impact of cyberstalking predominantly includes comorbid anxiety and depression. Common coping strategies\nadopted by victims in our sample include avoidant coping, ignoring the perpetrator, confrontational coping, support seeking,\nand cognitive reframing. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the ramifications of cyberstalking are widespread,\naffecting psychological, social, interpersonal, and economic aspects of life. To adapt, some victims made major changes to both\ntheir work and social life, with some ceasing employment and others modifying their usual daily activities. The widespread\nnegative effects of cyberstalking identified in this study highlight that this phenomenon should be a concern to both legal and\nmental health professionals, particularly as the comments made by our sample illustrate the current inadequacy of response\nand provision. Recommendations are discussed and provided for law enforcement and mental health professionals.\n",

Ubiquitous\naccess to the Internet has dramatically altered communication\nin contemporary society, and these electronic means provide\nperpetrators with novel ways of pursuing individuals. In light\nof this, a phenomenon known as cyberstalking has emerged\nthat can be defined as the repeated pursuit of an individual\nutilizing electronic means to induce fear or distress (Maple,\nShort, & Brown, 2011). As the Internet is a rapidly evolving\nmedium, many new forms of cyberstalking are emerging and\nprovide additional tools for stalkers' arsenal. Cyberstalking\ncan take many forms including sending direct threats via\nemail, encouraging others to threaten or harass the victim,\ndistributing intimate photographs online, impersonating the\nvictim online, and seeking and compiling information on the\nvictim (Short, Linford, Wheatcroft, & Maple, 2014). Social\nnetworking sites provide a novel way to gather information\nabout an individual and, as such sites facilitate intrusion-like\nbehaviors, they are being used as conduits for stalking and\nonline harassment (Fox, 2016). Indeed, according to Kraft\nand Wang (2010), social media has made stalking much eas-\nier and visiting social networking sites can lead to an increased\nlikelihood of becoming a victim of cyberstalking. However,\nin many cases, the perpetrator makes use of both online and\noffline stalking techniques (Maple et al., 2011; Sheridan &\nGrant, 2007) and other researchers have also reported that it is\ncommon for cyberstalking to begin with the issuing of threats,\nandescalatetophysicalassault(Bocij,Griffiths,&McFarlane,\nStalking is one of the most common forms of interper-\nsonal violence. Figures from the British Crime Survey 2011\ndemonstrate that one in five women and one in 10 men will\nbe stalked at some point during their life (Smith, Coleman,\nEder, & Hall, 2011) and more recent figures from the\n1University of Liverpool, UK\n2University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJoanne D.

Worsley1, Jacqueline M. Wheatcroft1, Emma Short2,\nand Rhiannon Corcoran1\n Keywords\ncyberstalking, victims, emotional impact, well-being, coping strategies\n2 SAGE Open\nto 59 reported experiencing stalking over a period of 1 year\n(Office for National Statistics, 2015). Using data from a sup-\nplement to the 2006 National Crime Victimisation Survey\n(NCVS), Baum, Catalano, Rand, and Rose (2009) reported\nthat during a 12-month period, 1.4% of adults in the United\nStates were victims of stalking, and cyberstalking behavior\nwas reported in one in four stalking cases (26.1%). Taken\ntogether, the characteristics of both online and offline vari-\nants of stalking consist of repeated nuisance behaviors that\nare intrusive and that result in negative impacts in the victim\nA burgeoning literature reports the negative impacts of\ntraditional stalking in terms of victims' mental health and\nwell-being (Blaauw, Winkel, Arensman, Sheridan, & Freeve,\nPath\u00e9 & Mullen, 1997). Lifestyle changes also appear to be a\nuniversal response to being stalked offline with a diverse\narray of responses reported by victims. For instance, some\nvictims changed workplace or school. Others relocated resi-\ndence and many victims eschewed social outlets in favor of\nstaying at home through fear of encountering their stalker\n(Path\u00e9 & Mullen, 1997). With regard to the emotional impact\nof traditional stalking, Path\u00e9 and Mullen (1997) found that\nvictims' mental health deteriorated after the onset of harass-\nment. More specifically, victims reported heightened anxiety\nlevels, vivid flashbacks of their stalking ordeal, and persis-\ntent nausea. Purcell, Path\u00e9, and Mullen (2005) reported that\nstalking victims had elevated levels of general psychological\nsymptoms compared with short-lived harassment victims\nand controls, and almost one in five victims reported post-\ntraumatic stress symptomology. Similarly, Kamphuis and\nEmmelkamp (2001) also documented that many victims\nexperienced clinical or subclinical manifestations of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a consequence of their\nstalking ordeal. In addition, Kuehner et al. (2007) found\nassociations between stalking victimization and specific\nmental health problems, classified according to the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th\ned., DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) with\nthe most prevalent mental health problems being major\ndepression and panic disorder. Collectively, such studies\nhighlight that traditional stalking poses a serious threat to the\nmental health of victims. One factor shown to play an impor-\ntant role in the relationship between interpersonal stressors\nand psychological difficulties is coping (Lazarus, 1998).\nCoping refers to the cognitive and behavioral efforts a\nperson utilizes to manage stress (Lazarus & Folkman,\n1984). Various conceptualizations of coping are reported\nin the psychological literature, and many are underpinned\nby Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory which dichoto-\nmizes coping into problem-focused strategies (e.g., engag-\ning in behavior to change the situation such as seeking\nprofessional support) and emotion-focused strategies (e.g.,\ntrying to avoid the source of stress). Victims of traditional\nstalking employ a wide array of coping strategies to deter\nperpetrators and manage the negative emotional impact of\nthe unwanted pursuit. Cupach and Spitzberg (2004) and\nSpitzberg (2002) developed a typology of common coping\nstrategies employed by stalking victims. Coping strategies\nare conceptualized into the following five categories: mov-\ning inward, moving outward, moving away, moving\ntoward, and moving against (Cupach & Spitzberg, 2004).\nThe moving inward category reflects the victim using idio-\nsyncratic problem-solving skills, discounting help from\nothers, ignoring the problem, and blaming the self. In\ndirect contrast, the moving outward category reflects the\nvictim seeking guidance and support from others and this\nincludes both formal support from law enforcement as well\nas social support from family and friends. Moving away\ncoping strategies aim to avoid and limit access from the\nperpetrator, and specific behaviors include restricting\naccessibility and relocating. Last, both moving toward and\nmoving against coping strategies involve attempts to rea-\nson with the perpetrator. However, moving against coping\nstrategies include issuing verbal threats and using physical\nviolence to deter perpetrators. More recent studies (e.g.,\nGeistman, Smith, Lambert, & Cluse-Tolar, 2013; Johansen\n& Tj\u00f8rnh\u00f8j-Thomsen, 2016) have categorized victims'\ncoping responses as either formal responses (i.e., contact-\ning law enforcement) versus informal responses (i.e., deal-\ning with the perpetrator on their own or with the help of\nsignificant others) or external strategies (i.e., seeking\nassistance from external resources such as law enforce-\nment and/or family and friends) versus internal strategies\n(i.e., changing everyday routines and employing \"safety\"\nbehaviors).\nMoving to the cyberstalking literature, it is interesting to\nnote that the majority of this literature is quantitative. Using\ndata from the 2006 NCVS to compare traditional stalking\nand cyberstalking victims, Nobles, Reyns, Fox, and Fisher\n(2014) reported that individuals stalked via electronic means\nemployed more self-protective behaviors, such as changing\nusual activities and changing email addresses, in comparison\nwith traditional stalking victims. The authors offered an\nexplanation for their findings couched in the dynamics of\nonline interaction as they suggested that communication via\nelectronic means is just as personal as, or more personal\nthan, face-to-face communication and therefore cyberstalk-\ning may elicit a personal violation, which consequently elic-\nits more diverse self-protective behaviors. Alternatively,\ngiven the pervasive and public nature of social media, stalk-\ning occurring via these means may influence victims' behav-\niors as humiliating content is visible to a larger audience and,\nas it is challenging to completely remove content from the\nInternet, it cannot be easily overlooked. In light of this,\ncyberstalking may be more detrimental to victims'emotional\nhealth and reputation, and consequently, victims may employ\nadditional self-protective behaviors.\nDespite this difference, previous research has revealed a\ngeneral picture of similarity between traditional stalking\nWorsley et al. 3\nvictims and those stalked via electronic means with regard to\nthe victims' general responses to the ordeal. Specifically,\nSheridan and Grant (2007) reported that the extent of physi-\ncal and emotional consequences did not differ significantly\naccording to the degree of cyberinvolvement. With regard to\nsocial consequences, the only difference was that traditional\nstalking was associated more with changes to the victim's\nemployment status and social routines whereas cyberstalking\nwas more strongly associated with loss of significant rela-\ntionships. More recently, using standardized measures of\nanxiety and PTSD, Short, Guppy, Hart, and Barnes (2015)\nreported that both traditional stalking and cyberstalking vic-\ntims experience comparable elevated levels of psychological\ndistress as a consequence of the ordeal. In line with this,\nwhen Dre\u00dfing, Bailer, Anders, Wagner, and Gallas (2014)\npresented users of a German social networking site with a list\nof psychosomatic and psychosocial symptoms, over half of\nthe individuals who had experienced cyberstalking reported\nanger, helplessness, and anxiety. They also found that vic-\ntims of cyberstalking scored significantly lower on a stan-\ndardized measure of well-being than a comparison group\nwho had not experienced cyberstalking. Thus, there were\nstill significant negative outcomes for victims despite these\ninteractions taking place online.\nGiven the limited existing cyberstalking research is\nlargely quantitative, the perspectives of victims themselves\nare currently underrepresented in this literature. Experiential\ndata can provide valuable insights about the impact of\ncyberstalking, the coping strategies employed by victims,\nand the experience of responses and provisions from rele-\nvant professional bodies during and following the ordeal. In\nlight of this, the current research aims to qualitatively exam-\nine the narratives of victims, specifically with regard to the\nmental health and well-being consequences of cyberstalking\nas well as the coping strategies used to manage the ordeal\neffectively. As far as the authors are aware, no research has\nexamined these issues in this context to date. Furthermore,\nvictims' experiences of professional involvement, particu-\nlarly law enforcement, during and following the cyberstalk-\ning ordeal are explored.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData from a self-identified sample of 100 anonymous par-\nticipants who defined themselves as victims of cyberstalking\nwere gathered by an online survey. The sample comprised 65\nfemales and 34 males (one participant's gender was unspeci-\nSD = \u00b111.42) and the majority of participants were from the\nUnited Kingdom. This sample of 100 victims was obtained\nas a random sample from the Electronic Communication\nHarassment Observation (ECHO) project and represented\nIn half of all cases, there had been little or no prior relation-\nship between the stalker and the victim with 25.53% of cases\nreporting that the stalker was an acquaintance and 24.47% of\ncases reporting that the stalker was a stranger. Other relation-\nships between the stalker and victim included someone dated\ncasually (13.83%), lived with/was married to/have children\nand relative (1.06%). Ethical approval was obtained from the\nUniversity's Ethics Committee. All participants were pro-\nvided with information prior to taking part and provided\ninformed consent on that basis. All participants were assured\nof their anonymity. No incentives were provided for\nparticipation.\nThe Online Survey\nThe online survey was launched by the National Centre for\nCyberstalking Research (NCCR) and hosted on the website\nof the British Charity Network for Surviving Stalking (NSS).\nParticipants were invited through a NSS newsletter, national\nbroadcasts, and print media in news stories related to cyber-\nstalking. The questions were developed iteratively by profes-\nsionals and researchers. There was an inbuilt check for the\nkind of experiences that people were reporting in the form of\na definition: \"cyberstalking is a course of action that involves\nmore than one incident perpetrated through or utilizing elec-\ntronic means (such as the Internet or mobile technology) that\ncauses distress, fear, or alarm. Have you experienced cyber-\nstalking which meets this definition?\"\nThe online survey was designed to capture information\nabout the experiences of cyberstalking and, importantly, it\ndid not explicitly address the effects of the experience on the\nvictims. The survey participants, all victims of cyberstalking,\nwere asked to respond to the following broad open-ended\nquestions: (a) How did it all begin? When did you realize it\nwas becoming a problem? (b) Give examples of each of the\nharassment behaviors experienced. (c) Did any actions\nimprove the situation? (d) Did any actions make the situation\nworse? (e) Are there any actions that you feel would have\nprotected you better if they had been available to you? (f)\nWhat else could have helped improve the situation?\nMethod of Analysis\nSurvey responses were analyzed using the thematic analysis\nprocedure described by Braun and Clarke (2006). Thematic\nanalysis is a flexible qualitative methodology that aims to\nidentify, analyze, and report recurrent themes in data (Braun\n& Clarke, 2006). This analysis takes a realist epistemological\nstandpoint, treating participants' narratives as representative\nof their lived \"reality\". Thematic analysis was selected for\nseveral reasons: First, the narratives may be varied, specifi-\ncally with regard to individual experience, and therefore may\nnot yield a single overarching theory. Second, as no prior\n4 SAGE Open\nqualitative research had been conducted specifically assess-\ning the mental health and well-being implications of cyber-\nstalking, this methodology was considered most useful for\nproviding an initial description of the consequences of cyber-\nstalking and last, thematic analysis is sensitive to individual\nnuance. However, as this analysis does not attempt to\ndescribe the content of the entire dataset, the analysis could\nbe described as more theoretical than inductive as the coding\nprocess was driven by our analytical interest in the mental\nhealth and well-being consequences of cyberstalking rather\nthan to provide an overall description of the dataset.\nThe steps for conducting thematic analysis as outlined in\ndetail by Braun and Clarke (2006) were followed: First, the\ndata were read carefully to identify meaningful units of text\nrelevant to the research topic and initial codes were gener-\nated. The codes dealing with the same issue were then\ngrouped together to generate the thematic structures. The\nanalysis was conducted across all the aforementioned ques-\ntions, rather than for each question independently to identify\nthemes across the data as a whole. The themes, drawn purely\nfrom within the data, are illustrated by anonymous direct\nquotations. As the data were supplied from the NCCR and\nprovided online, there are no line numbers present to report.\nHowever, to illustrate the breadth of participant contribution\nto the study, we have included the participant number beside\neach quotation.\nAnalysis\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has described health\nas \" . . . a state of complete physical, mental and social well-\nbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\"\ninfluence health in a number of ways, and the ramifications of\nthis ordeal are therefore potentially multilayered with serious\npotential outcomes. Using the method of analysis described\nabove, the participants' descriptions of the emotional, cogni-\ntive, and lifestyle impact of cyberstalking were explored. The\nemergent themes and associated subordinate themes, summa-\nrized in Table 1, illustrate the number of ways that cyberstalk-\ning can influence health and are each discussed in turn.\nFear\nIn line with the definition of cyberstalking, a preponderance of\nvictims experience a heightened sense of fear as a conse-\nquence of the cyberstalking ordeal, and fear as an intense emo-\ntion may overshadow every other aspect of life, for instance:\nMy whole life stopped because I was in so much fear. (Participant\nIn the end I became phobic. (Participant 92)\nThere are about 6 people who write things about me and to me\nthat make me fearful. (Participant 9)\nAlso, it seemed that victims found it difficult to determine\nwhich self-protective strategy to adopt in response to their\nfear:\nWhen under fear, in panick [sic] it is difficult to work out what\nis the best solution. (Participant 54)\nThus fear was a consequence of the repeated pursuit felt by\nthe victims and it is possible that victims develop anxiety as\na consequence of the fear response and the helpless position\nthey find themselves in to relieve this fear.\nAnxiety\nIt appeared that anxiety could manifest as a posttraumatic\nstress response or as acute physiologically based responses\nsuch as panic attacks. Some participants reported experiencing\nintense, disabling anxiety which can be linked specifically to\nthe cyberstalking ordeal. When anxiety is tied to such a trau-\nmatic event, it is sometimes accompanied by flashbacks:\nI still have flashbacks and experience anxiety when going into\nmy inbox. (Participant 81)\nTo this day I still have flashbacks when sat in my front room.\nTaken together, such quotations serve to highlight that vivid\nmemories of the cyberstalking ordeal are relived involun-\ntarily and ultimately this can have a severe emotional impact.\nIn addition to vivid flashbacks, intrusive recollections were\nalso reported:\nI imagine I see his face in every car that passes. (Participant 2)\nCollectively, intrusive recollections and vivid flashbacks are\ncommonly reported symptoms of PTSD. Although some par-\nticipants reported posttraumatic stress symptomology, others\novertly stated that they have suffered PTSD as a consequence\nof the traumatic ordeal:\nTable 1. The Impact of Cyberstalking on Mental Health and\nWell-Being.\nThemes Subordinate themes\nFear \nAnxiety Specific anxiety symptoms\nPhysiological responses\nPersistent/chronic anxiety\nDepressive symptoms Low mood\nLack of control\nHelplessness\nSecondary emotional responses \nGlobal well-being consequences \nLack of effective victim support Police\nOther\nWorsley et al. 5\nI became very ill in August 2009 and now suffer complex\nPTSD/depression as a result of the harassment and abuse.\nTaken together, many victims reported suffering from\nclinical or subclinical manifestations of PTSD. In addition\nto distressing recollections and flashbacks, other partici-\npants described distress in the form of paranoia and\nmistrust:\nI get paranoyed [sic] very easily and reluctant to trust indirect\ncommunications. (Participant 54)\nI found myself being suspicious of friends and customers who I\nhad known well for years. (Participant 63)\nMoreover, some participants described that the various\nstates of anxiety exemplified above may also take the form\nof panic attacks:\nI had panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. (Participant 68)\nI still have anxiety attacks when the phone rings. (Participant 67)\nThus, as a consequence of the cyberstalking ordeal, some\nparticipants experienced intense periods of overwhelming\nanxiety alongside pronounced physiological effects.\nPersistent nausea was reported by one participant who\nexperienced the urge to vomit every time she addressed her\nincoming mail:\nI began to fall apart and would be sick when I had to address\nincoming email. (Participant 93)\nIn line with this, heightened anxiety levels manifested as\n\"shakes\" in another participant:\nHer last email left me shaking. (Participant 72)\nIn addition, some participants also experienced persistent/\nchronic anxiety which manifested in the form of constant\nhypervigilance:\nI am constantly looking around my shoulder when leaving\nschool. (Participant 1)\nThe stress and fear of having to look over your shoulder all the\ntime. (Participant 64)\nThe emotional impact of cyberstalking could be long-lasting\nas some participants still experienced anxiety when access-\ning emails or hearing the phone ringing:\nI still experience anxiety when going to my inbox. My health\nhas not been the same since. (Participant 81)\nI still have anxiety attacks when the phone rings. (Participant 67)\nDepressive Symptoms\nReflecting the fact that anxiety and depression very com-\nmonly occur together, profound anxiety was often reported\nalongside depressive symptoms. For instance, one partici-\npant stated she now suffers:\nComplex PTSD/depression as a result of the harassment and\nabuse. (Participant 92)\nDepression encompasses a wide array of symptoms includ-\ning loss of control, low mood, rumination, and feelings of\nhelplessness and hopelessness. Some participants expressed\na lack of control over the situation:\nYou are made to feel with less control of your life. (Participant 54)\nI realised then I had lost all control of the situation. A low point.\nTaken together, such cognitions may contribute to the low\nmood experienced by victims. For others, low mood was\ntriggered by the stalker's specific tactic:\nHer two replies accusing me of all sorts of things I hadn't ever\ndone made me feel pretty low. (Participant 3)\nLow mood is accompanied by negative automatic cogni-\ntions, which consequently lead to the emotional elements of\ndepression. In line with this, rumination also arises among\nvictims as one participant stated:\nThewholesituationoccupiedmythoughtsconstantly.(Participant\nIn addition, feelings of helplessness were prominent\namongst victims, for instance,\nImpotence at how little I can do is the main emotion I fee(l).\nI was helpless to defend myself. (Participant 19)\nI was also made to feel helpless about the situation. (Participant 64)\nSimilarly, participants also expressed pessimistic views of\nthe future, such as,\nI feel it is something I will never entirely escape. (Participant 53)\nHe will follow me for the rest of my life and I can do nothing.\n(Participant 2)\nI realised it was a problem fairly early on, but there was nothing\nI could do about it. (Participant 95)\nThus participants felt unable to change the situation; how-\never, by remaining passive, victims may exacerbate their\n6 SAGE Open\ndepressive symptoms. Taken together, the cyberstalking\nordeal leaves victims with a low opinion of the control they\nhave over their own lives and thus, with a pessimistic future\noutlook.\nSecondary Emotional Responses\nIn addition to the primary emotional consequences detailed\nabove, it appears as though once the acute fear abates, anger\nor annoyance at the situation is expressed. For instance,\nI stopped getting afraid quite some time ago, now I'm more\nannoyed. (Participant 14)\nDespite resolving this amicably four weeks or so ago, there's\nstill an element of trauma for want of a better term, and I still\nhave a reasonably short fuse. (Participant 42)\nOne participant entertained aggressive thoughts and claimed\nthat she wanted to physically assault her stalker:\nPunching him in the face! I know that sounds stupid but it made\nme so angry and upset. (Participant 21)\nIn addition to anger and annoyance, other participants felt\nembarrassed by the situation and such negative self-directed\naffect may serve to deter victims from seeking help, for instance:\nI probably should have entered counselling earlier although I\nfelt too ashamed. (Participant 98)\nEmbarrassment has made me reluctant to involve the police.\nGlobal Well-Being Consequences\nIn addition to specific forms of distress and emotion, some\nparticipants acknowledged the breadth of potential well-\nbeing consequences of cyberstalking as for some the impact\nwas all-encompassing:\nOn the whole this stalker has had a huge affect on my life and\nmental stability. (Participant 63)\nWhen I look back I think I was an emotional wreck who didn't\nknow which way to turn. (Participant 63)\nI nearly had a breakdown and I am a psychotherapist. (Participant\nIt was the worst experience of my life. (Participant 80)\nThe breadth of potential consequences were also\nhighlighted:\nI had a friend who killed himself over the EXACT SAME\nincidents that I experienced, but he did not leave facebook, and\ntherefore took his own life. (Participant 27)\nI am no child, but if this was a child, I could see them driven to\nsuicide because of this kind of bullying. (Participant 61)\nVictims also reported that the cyberstalking ordeal\naffected social, interpersonal, and economic aspects of their\nlives. More specifically, the profound states of chronic anxi-\nety and low mood evidenced above negatively influenced\nvictims' working lives and impaired their relationships with\nsignificant others. Job losses can have damaging effects on\nindividuals' well-being and many participants were required\nto withdraw from their job:\nMy only response was to withdraw from the public eye almost\nentirely--pulling out of several high profile jobs. (Participant 53)\nProving that they can hear my conversations and read my emails\nand files in a deliberate attempt to intimidate me and \"still\" me\ninto inactivity which has affected my work and lost me jobs.\nI now have NO email what so ever so makes it hard for me to\napply for jobs online. (Participant 17)\nIn addition to withdrawing from jobs, other victims termi-\nnated their use of particular websites, for instance,\nI am deaf, and have to leave this site and the many freonds [sic]\nI have made as it provokes this man. (Participant 9)\nHence some victims lost contact with their online friends as\na consequence of curtailing their Internet use, and this may\ninduce feelings of isolation. Similarly, many victims\nreported that the cyberstalking ordeal placed an undue\namount of strain on their relationships with significant oth-\ners. For instance,\nShe turned a lot of my friends against me and destroyed one\ngood friendship for several years. (Participant 77)\nThe resulting consequence is that my husband and I had to cut\nhis family out of our lives for good as it is too painful a reminder\nof the trauma we went through. (Participant 6)\nTaken together, the loss of such significant relationships as a\nconsequence of the ordeal may negatively affect victims'\nwell-being.\nLack of Effective Victim Support\nIn light of such negative consequences, it is not surprising\nthat victims seek professional help. However, the majority\nof participants expressed strong dissatisfaction with the\nlack of support they received in relation to the cyberstalk-\ning ordeal. Most victims reported that they were not taken\nseriously by law enforcement and, in light of this, many\nvictims suggested that an increased awareness of the seri-\nous nature of this phenomenon among police officers is\nwarranted:\nWorsley et al. 7\nThe police didn't take this seriously enough and I felt really\nstupid and humiliated. (Participant 19)\nIt was such a struggle to get the police to take it seriously and\nconvince them it was more than just a few words on websites/\nemails, texts etc. (Participant 20)\nSome police officers even found the situation comical during the\nyears. (Participant 56)\nI think law enforcement people should be taking cyber harassment\nmore seriously than they are at the moment. It is not just children\nand teenagers who are affected by it but also adults and so more\nattention needs to be given to this issue. (Participant 16)\nApreponderance of victims reported that they did not receive\nany support at all and some victims expressed dissatisfaction\nwith the continuity of support. For instance,\nI was left on my own with no support. (Participant 19)\nThe police never referred me to any support organisations.\nI had little continuity from the police which meant that I was\noften re-telling all the information to different officers.\nMore support from the police would have been really helpful.\nIn light of this, participants highlighted that law enforcement\npersonnel should signpost victims to antistalking\norganizations:\nIt would have been better if I had received more proactive advice\nsuch as putting me onto an anti-stalking organisation, and\nempowering me to enable me to deal with it. (Participant 64)\nIf the police don't have time, they could give the victim the\ncontact details of an anti-stalking organisation. (Participant 63)\nIn addition, it appeared as though the police did not take\naction if the victim's physical health was not in jeopardy:\nWithout physical attack, they seem unwilling to do much.\nAs long as you are not physically injured, the police do not act.\nIn line with this, one participant suggested that law enforcers\nshould be made aware of the extent of psychological damage\nsustained by victims of cyberstalking:\nPolice should be made aware of the distress that the victim is put\nunder. Some sort of leaflet would be very useful of best actions\nto take i.e. do not reply, gather evidence etc. (Participant 59)\nMore worryingly, some participants believe that the way\nthey were dealt with by professionals directly contributed to\nescalation of negative impact. For instance,\nI do not believe that I would have become ill if the Police had\ntaken effective action at a much earlier stage to protect myself\nand my children. (Participant 92)\nSimilarly, in other cases, law enforcers exacerbated the vic-\ntim's feelings of helplessness:\nReporting him (police, website/service providers) made the\nsituation worse too, because it did nothing and therefore I felt more\nhelpless, and like the system was on his side. (Participant 24)\nThe police did take me seriously but I was also made to feel\nhelpless about the situation. (Participant 64)\nSuch negative experiences with law enforcement may add\nto victims' feelings of vulnerability. Thus, victims may\nfeel further disempowered by this apparent lack of effec-\ntive support and as a consequence of reporting the ordeal\nto police without an effective response, they may feel,\nparadoxically, that the cyberstalker is empowered. Last,\nsome victims were made to feel as though they were at\nfault:\nThe police made us feel like we were almost to blame.\nThey said it was my fault for putting the information online in\nteh [sic] first place. (Participant 92)\nIn addition to the lack of support provided by law enforce-\nment personnel, many participants also expressed strong dis-\nsatisfaction with the lack of support they received from other\nexpected sources of help. With regard to social networking\nsites, a preponderance of victims reported that they did not\nreceive any response from Facebook after they reported the\nordeal. For instance,\nThere was no reponse [sic] from hotmail or facebook in regards\nto the breach of security--which totally appalled me that they\ncontinued to allow this woman to impersonate and abuse me\nonline. (Participant 6)\nMore worryingly, some participants believed that as they\nwere not offered any form of protection or help from expected\nsources, this contributed to the escalation of negative impact:\nThe university did not do anything to protect me, and I feel that\na system that was less lenient would have spared me a lot of\ndistress and psychological abuse. I was given no support\nthroughout the whole thing. (Participant 68)\nEven health professional friends washed their hands of me and\nso in that sense, colluded in the abuse of me. (Participant 77)\n8 SAGE Open\nHaving more friends on my side would have given me strength\nto take steps to stop things much earlier--and probably before it\ngot so out of hand that I had panic attacks and nervous\nbreakdowns. (Participant 68)\nIn line with this, many victims suggested that increasing gen-\neral awareness is vital in combating cyberstalking and the\nnegative emotional consequences. When victims were asked\nwhat could have improved the situation, many victims\nacknowledged the urgent need for increased public aware-\nness, for instance:\nPeople having a better understanding of cyberstalking. My\nfriends, family and employers all reacted very strongly and\njudged me. (Participant 96)\nIf my friends had known a little more about what harassment\nand stalking is, they wouldn't have brushed him off as harmless\nas long as they did (some of them still do) and refuse to believe\nthat he was a problem for me. (Participant 68)\nEven the friends and family who really understand my whole\nlong story still feel obliged to talk to the harasser in social\nsituations leaving me feeling extremely angry that they belittle\nmy experience. (Participant 62)\nCoping\nGiven the negative impact of cyberstalking outlined above,\nthe specific ways that victims reported coping with cyber-\nstalking were also explored. Coping responses can be seen as\nattempts to respond to an interpersonal stressor and the emer-\ngent themes were organized into restrictive behavioral\napproaches (e.g., avoiding and ignoring the perpetrator) and\nnonrestrictive approaches (e.g., confrontational coping, sup-\nport seeking, and cognitive reframing). These approaches\nencompass the different coping strategies drawn on by vic-\ntims to deal with the situation.\nRestrictive behavioral approaches predominately include\nboth avoiding and/or ignoring the perpetrator. For instance,\nmost victims modified their usual daily activities through\nfear of encountering the perpetrator:\nI stopped answering all phone calls. I also stopped looking out\nmy window when being attracted to do so. (Participant 74)\nI had to modify my day-to-day schedule so I wouldn't see him.\nI also avoided places where I knew he would normally be.\nSimilarly, many victims restricted their social media activity\nto avoid coming into contact with the perpetrator online.\nSpecifically, many victims avoided particular webpages, and\nchanged both their email address and/or privacy settings on\nsocial networking sites to limit the perpetrator's access:\nI don't go on social networking sites anymore or even own a\nmobile phone. (Participant 20)\nI left the forum and all my blog/other social networking have\nprivacy settings to friends only. (Participant 21)\nI changed my email address after a couple of months. (Participant\nTherefore, many participants used some form of avoidant\ncoping for short-term relief and although this coping strategy\ndoes not appear to improve victims' quality of life, it appears\nto be effective as, in most cases, it successfully terminated\nunwanted intrusions:\nI quit the internet totally and that pretty much blocked off his\ncommunications with me. (Participant 50)\nWhen I stopped using social networking sites, I did not have to\nbe subjected to the abuse that I received on them. (Participant 27)\nBy adopting this coping strategy, victims appear to be proac-\ntively trying to protect themselves and this coping strategy\nsuccessfully made individuals less accessible to the perpetra-\ntor. However, one participant expressed resistance to adopt-\ning this coping strategy as, by avoiding particular social\nmedia platforms, the victim felt paradoxically that the cyber-\nstalker was given more control:\nWhen I approached an anti-stalking organisation about it, they\nreplied and suggested I stop using the forums, stop my blog or\nuse a different name. I already did that once, and as far as I can\nsee, that's making me act like a victim and playing right into a\nstalker's hands. I would prefer it if I was the one empowered,\nrather than the stalker. (Participant 3)\nIn contrast, other victims took control of the situation by\nignoring the perpetrator, for instance:\nI ignored the problems which was quite difficult. (Participant\nFor some victims, adopting this coping strategy also\nappeared to effectively deal with the unwanted intrusions:\nIgnoring him was probably the best response as any response\nfrom me appeared to either inflame him or make him happy.\nThe only thing that helped was refusing to communicate with\nhim at all. (Participant 67)\nIgnoring and not reacting if possible, is quite effective.\nIn contrast to taking control by ignoring the perpetrator,\nother participants took a more agentic stance by directly\nWorsley et al. 9\nconfronting the perpetrator. By adopting this coping strategy,\nvictims appeared to be addressing the command imbalance\nby attempting to regain power, for instance:\nI told them to leave me alone. The e-mails stopped but stalking\nonline didn't. (Participant 19)\nHowever, this coping strategy may be psychologically\nrewarding for the perpetrator and thus, in some cases directly\ncommunicating with the perpetrator inflamed the situation,\nfor instance:\nResponding did not help. He just learned that the price for\ntalking to me was calling 30+ times in a row. (Participant 67)\nConfronting her via email just made her send more abusive\nemails. (Participant 76)\nAny attempt to tell her to stop just makes it worse. She ramps it\nup even more. (Participant 7)\nMoreover, for other victims, an authoritative figure\ndirectly contacted the perpetrator. It appears as though when\nperpetrators are addressed by a figure of authority, this may\nreduce the victim's vulnerability in the perpetrator's mind as\nadopting this coping strategy appeared to culminate in desis-\ntance, for instance:\nWhen the police finally took action and issued a harassment\norder things seemed to improve. (Participant 100)\nI contacted the head of my college department, as my harasser\nwas in the same major as me, and he interceded. After that the\nharassment stopped. (Participant 75)\nSocial support seeking was also evident and primarily\nincluded disclosing the situation to friends and family\nmembers:\nI contacted friends and circulated messages which had been sent\nprivately. They then provided a barrier between myself and the\nindividual. (Participant 22)\nBy sharing the abuse with a close circle of friends/relatives and\ndealing with it in journalistic terms, at no time have I become\nparanoid, despite much anxiety suffered. (Participant 85)\nMy father wrote him a priority letter threatening him that if he\ndid not desist we would get the police involved. (Participant 69)\nHowever, indirectly communicating with the perpetrator\nmay in some cases inflame the situation, for instance:\nAllowing a friend to respond on my behalf inflamed the\nsituation. (Participant 48)\nAlthough for others, this coping strategy was effective:\nIt only improved after my father rang him to ask him to stop.\nLast, a preponderance of victims adopted a coping strat-\negy known as cognitive reframing. These participants\nattempted to reframe the meaning of their experiences and\ntried to understand the perpetrator's behavior by basing it in\na framework, for instance:\nEven after everything she has done, I don't hate her. I just want\nher to get some treatment and leave me alone. (Participant 7)\nShe needs mental health support. I was scared but understand\nshe needs care. (Participant 19)\nHere, victims were trying to find a way to construe the ordeal\nas filled with meaning and these participants did not accept\nvictimhood or blame themselves for the ordeal. Thus, the\nability to cognitively reframe thoughts could enable the rees-\ntablishment of some emotional control, laying the course to\na more resilient path. By empathically representing their\nstalker as a person in distress and in need of help, a reposi-\ntioning of their own responsive behavior and stance was\nenabled. Thus, reframing the experience less as a self-\nfocused emotional ordeal and more in terms of other-focused\nemotional understanding changes how the victim experi-\nences and reacts to the ordeal placing it in an understandable\nframework while also making it even less about \"blaming\"\nthe self. In fact, a preponderance of victims were empathic\ntoward their stalker, stating that such behavior must emerge\nas a result of a mental health difficulty in the perpetrator. For\nexample,\nWorrying emails that obviously came from a mentally ill mind.\nBy this time I was aware that he had multiple addictions and\nappeared delusional. (Participant 93)\nThe extent to which such representations reduced or exacer-\nbated fear or anxiety could not be extracted from the data\nhowever.\nDiscussion\nFindings and Implications\nThe thematic analysis of material voluntarily offered within\nan online survey launched by the NCCR has provided\nnuanced insights about both the emotional and restrictive\nlifestyle consequences of cyberstalking, and the experience\nof care from law enforcement and other professional agen-\ncies. The current findings suggest that the emotional impact\nof cyberstalking predominantly includes comorbid anxiety\nand depression. Profound states of chronic anxiety and low\nmood negatively influenced victims' working lives and\nimpaired their relationships with significant others. Victims\nemployed a wide array of coping strategies to deter perpetra-\ntors and manage the negative emotional impact of the\nunwanted pursuit. Common coping strategies adopted by\nvictims included avoidant coping, ignoring the perpetrator,\nconfrontational coping, support seeking, and cognitive\nreframing. Unfortunately, when victims sought help, it seems\nthat the way they were dealt with by police officers and sig-\nnificant others increased, rather than decreased, the negative\nimpact of the ordeal.\nIt appears that the psychological consequences of experi-\nencing cyberstalking are broadly comparable with those of\ntraditional stalking, including depressive symptoms, height-\nened anxiety levels, and posttraumatic stress responses\n2005). The qualitative findings reported here are also in line\nwith earlier quantitative cyberstalking research which\nshowed that over half of victims reported feelings of help-\nlessness and anxiety (Dre\u00dfing et al., 2014). Further to this,\nthe coping strategies employed by victims of cyberstalking\nare consistent with the typology of common coping strate-\ngies offered by Cupach and Spitzberg (2004) as being\nemployed by victims of traditional stalking. For instance,\nconfronting the perpetrator and cognitive reframing reflect\n\"moving toward\" coping strategies, avoidant coping reflects\n\"moving away\" coping strategies, ignoring the perpetrator\nreflects \"moving inward\" coping strategies, and seeking sup-\nport from external sources reflects \"moving outward\" coping\nstrategies.\nThe relationship between cyberstalking victimization and\nemotional distress is likely to be influenced by the resilience\nor vulnerabilities of the victims and, as coping strategies\nhave been linked to psychological functioning, they repre-\nsent viable targets for intervention. The ability to cognitively\nrestructure thoughts may enable resilience as, based on the\ncomments made by our sample, being able to empathically\nrepresent the stalker as themselves a distressed person and\ninternally framing their behavior appears to form part of\ndealing with the ordeal effectively. However, the reports of\nmany victims did not indicate that this cognitive coping strat-\negy was adopted, instead they reported modifying their usual\ndaily activities and restricted their social media activity to\navoid coming into contact with the perpetrator. Although this\ncoping strategy successfully made victims less accessible to\ntheir stalker, as the Internet has become increasingly impor-\ntant in many facets of life, especially communication and\nsocial interaction, there were negative social consequences\nassociated with avoiding the online milieu, such as social\ndisconnectedness and job losses. More specifically, restrict-\ning access to social media platforms often separates victims\nfrom positive social connections with friends and family, and\nthis may subsequently reduce access to social support and\nincrease feelings of isolation. As coping strategies have the\npotential to determine the mental health outcomes experi-\nenced by victims, coping responses should represent a key\ntarget for therapeutic intervention, and establishing adaptive,\ncognitive coping strategies may be beneficial in helping vic-\ntims regain a sense of empowerment and mastery.\nLessons for Law Enforcement Personnel\nThe current findings also suggest that victims frequently\nengage with law enforcement personnel to both gain support\nand to provide evidence for investigation. Victims' feedback\nabout this engagement provides insights for practitioners as\ncurrently the support and protection available to victims of\ncyberstalking seems unreliable and inadequate. Most nota-\nbly, the victims acknowledged that during the cyberstalking\nordeal, a supportive police officer who understands the com-\nplex nature of cyberstalking is required as most victims\nreported that the actions of expected sources of help were\nineffectual and often, victims were made to feel as though\nthey were to blame. It is notable that, unlike preferred prac-\ntice in relation to victims of face-to-face harassment, partici-\npants in this survey reported lack of consistency in their\ndealings with the police. Given the intense distress experi-\nenced in response to cyberstalking, parity of practice is\nclearly needed. Instead, victims reported being questioned\nby a number of different police officers, and expressed frus-\ntration due to this inconsistency. Hence, in future, the num-\nber of officers interacting with the victim should be limited\nto enhance consistency and continuity. Finally, in the limited\nnumber of cases where the police did act, the victims were\nnot kept informed about the progress of the case. Thus, a\nfurther recommendation is that all victims should be informed\nas the case progresses according to the protocol. On balance,\nit is clear that victims of cyberstalking have to deal with a\nnumber of additional stressors; first as a direct consequence\nof the perpetrators' behavior followed by what is viewed as\nineffectual support from law enforcement personnel. To min-\nimize the feeling of revictimization, police officers should\ndemonstrate appropriate empathy as instantiated in best\npractice guidance procedures associated with traditional\nstalking. To this end, workshops and training courses should\nbe provided to law enforcers to increase awareness of the\nextent of psychological damage sustained by victims and the\nimportance of treating cyberstalking offenses seriously from\nfirst responder. Overall, the process should culminate in a\nreferral to suitable support agencies when necessary.\nLessons for Mental Health Professionals\nIn line with this, given the extent of psychological damage\nsustained by victims of cyberstalking, a referral to psycho-\nlogical therapy should be made available for victims when\nnecessary as the current findings demonstrate that the experi-\nence prompts negative evaluations about themselves, others,\nand/or the world. More specifically, a course of cognitive-\nbehavioral therapy focusing on the victim's cognitions may\nassist in restructuring any morbid perceptions as it is common\nfor victims of cyberstalking to become hypervigilant and\ndevelop a view of the world as unsafe, a view of the self as\nhelpless and to blame, and a view of the future that is hopeless\nand pessimistic. Thus, restoring the victim's view of himself\nor herself as a worthwhile individual, and correcting general-\nized threat-focused evaluations about the world should be of\nprincipal importance. In addition, therapists should focus not\nonly on the victim's cognitions but also equally on their\navoidance responses/\"safety\" behaviors. The current findings\ndemonstrate that victims frequently avoid external cues asso-\nciated with the ordeal, such as the phone ringing, incoming\nmail, certain websites, and places associated with the perpe-\ntrator to prevent becoming overwhelmed with difficult emo-\ntions. However, such avoidant coping or \"safety\" behaviors\nare often counterproductive as although in the short term,\navoidance behaviors will be rewarded by a reduction in dis-\ntress; in the long term, such behaviors may exacerbate the\nvictim's restrictive behaviors and feelings of isolation, which\nmay lead to detachment. For instance, one participant was\nadvised by law enforcement personnel to restrict their social\nmedia activity by withdrawing from a particular website;\nhowever, as a consequence, the victim lost contact with his\nsocial connections and may have felt paradoxically, that the\ncyberstalker was empowered. Avoidance may respond to\nbehavioral techniques, which assist victims to gradually\nresume abandoned daily activities such as answering the\nphone or addressing incoming mail and manage the associ-\nated anxiety. Taken together, interventions should focus on\nboth restructuring any morbid perceptions and teaching vic-\ntims not to adopt habitual avoidant coping strategies or\n\"safety\" behaviors.\nLimitations\nDespite the practical implications of the current study, there\nare several limitations that require consideration when inter-\npreting the findings. First, as the survey was disseminated\nthrough online channels, those victims with limited access to\ndigital technologies may not be represented, particularly as\nthe current findings demonstrated that it is common for vic-\ntims to avoid the Internet as a consequence of their cyber-\nstalkingordeal.Second,asthesampleconsistedofindividuals\nwho were self-identified victims, there is potential for bias in\nthe responses. Participants may have already been aware of\nthe NSS as a result of their cyberstalking ordeal. Therefore,\nthe current sample may be considered unrepresentative of\ncyberstalking victims in the general population. The sample\nmay have recruited those more aware and distressed victims,\nwhichmayhaveinfluencedthecurrentanalysis.Nevertheless,\nthese criticisms can in part be balanced against the number of\nresponders. Equally, it is important to highlight that the\nreports of the victims in this particular survey may be an\nunderestimation of the extent of negative consequences of\ncyberstalking. This is because the survey questions did not\nexplicitly ask participants to reflect on their emotional\nresponses. As the data were extracted from a series of broad\nopen-ended questions not tailored specifically toward mental\nhealth and well-being, the analysis is an emerging,\nunprompted story and this therefore is considered one of the\nkey strengths of the current study. Thus, using the open-\nended questions enabled an untainted and potentially more\naccurate story to be elicited and adopting this approach also\nenabled those critical aspects of mental health and well-\nbeing to emerge.\nFuture Directions\nBased on the sheer number of victims reporting or suspecting\nthe presence of psychological difficulties in their stalkers,\nfurther research should investigate the link between mental\nhealth difficulties and cyberstalking behavior. Qualitative\ndata from the perpetrators of this crime would be extremely\neffective in ascertaining the nature of cyberstalking and, in\nparticular, the association between life experiences, mental\nhealth difficulties, and cyberstalking behavior. In line with\nthis, some victims were empathic toward their stalker by\nacknowledging that their perpetrator needs mental health\nsupport. Further research could therefore explore gender dif-\nferences among cyberstalking victims as, in line with the fear\nof crime literature (e.g., Warr & Ellison, 2000), female\ncyberstalking victims may be more likely to express fear for\nthemselves whereas male cyberstalking victims may be more\nlikely to express concern for their stalker. Last, as revenge\nporn is becoming increasingly prevalent (Kamal & Newman,\n2016), future research should qualitatively examine the nar-\nratives of revenge porn victims, specifically with regard to\nthe mental health and well-being consequences as well as the\ncoping strategies used to manage the ordeal effectively. The\nauthors are currently investigating this issue as to date, this\nphenomenon has received very little empirical attention.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, this study is the first to qualitatively examine\nboth the negative emotional impact of cyberstalking and\nindividuals' coping responses. Data analysis indicates the\nextent of the psychological and social impairments experi-\nenced by victims of cyberstalking behavior and highlights\nthat this phenomenon should be an immediate concern to\nboth legal and mental health professionals alike. There is\nscope for improvement in how victims are dealt with and\nincreasing general awareness is vital. It is noteworthy that\nthe stalking threat does not have to be physical to cause psy-\nchological damage, and in this, the findings appear to con-\nsolidate previous results of quantitative studies of\ncyberstalking, such as those presented by Dre\u00dfing et al.\n(2014). The relationship between cyberstalking victimiza-\ntion and emotional distress is likely to be influenced by the\nresilience or vulnerabilities of the victims and, as coping\nstrategies have been linked to psychological functioning,\nthey represent viable targets for intervention. Specifically,\nthe ability to cognitively restructure thoughts may enable\nresilience as being able to empathically represent the stalker\nas themselves a distressed person appears to form part of\ndealing with the ordeal effectively. However, many victims\nfrequently engaged in avoidance/\"safety\" behaviors in\nattempt to both avoid feelings of distress regarding their vic-\ntimization and avoid coming into contact with the perpetra-\ntor. Consequently, interventions should focus on getting\nvictims to not habitually rely on avoidant coping strategies\nin addition to restructuring any morbid perceptions.\nIntervening before avoidance or \"safety\" behaviors become\ningrained and fostering adaptive cognitive coping strategies\nmay enable victims to regain a sense of empowerment. In\nsum, as technology continues to develop, cyberstalking\nrates will continue to rise, therefore, a more coherent\napproach to understanding and addressing this nuisance\nbehavior is necessary to prevent cyberstalking from occur-\nring and also to mitigate the effects after such cybervictim-\nization has occurred.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nProfessor Rhiannon Corcoran is part funded by the National\nInstitute of Health Research Collaborative Leadership in Applied\nHealth Research and Care North West Coast (NIHR CLAHRC\nNWC).
