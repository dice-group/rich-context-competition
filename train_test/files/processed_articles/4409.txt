The increasing global competition\nand growth of marketplaces has created a competitive\nincentive among many companies to consolidate and\nreconcile their knowledge assets as a means of creating\nvalue that is sustainable over time. Recent studies\n(Moon & Lee, 2014) have concluded that culture and\nknowledge-sharing processes contribute to knowledge\nmanagement (KM) effectiveness. Business organizations\nview knowledge as their most valuable and strategic\nresourceforachievingsustainablecompetitiveadvantage\n(Davenport & Prusak, 2000). Thus, organizations\nhave initiated knowledge management (KM) projects\nand programmes and have also emphasized on the\nknowledge-sharing aspects (Wang, Noe, & Wang, 2014).\nThe organizations have started to recognize, create,\ntransform, and distribute knowledge and have a KM\nsystem in place (Gold, Malhotra, & Segars, 2001).\nThe primary focus of many organizations has been to\ndevelop new applications of information technology\n(IT) to support the digital capture, storage, retrieval, and\ndistribution of organization's explicitly documented\nknowledge (North & Kumta, 2014). Other organizations\nbelieve that most important knowledge is tacit\nknowledge which can be shared by creating a culture\nin the organization. It has also been observed that KM\nis not just about capturing, storing, and transferring\ninformation; the pattern of interaction between\npeople, technologies, and techniques is also important\n(Bhatt, 2001). The impact of KM has been studied on\nperformance and knowledge effectiveness in developed\nnations; however, how the developing nations are\nbuilding these capabilities has not been studied. This\nmotivated the researchers to take up the study of KM\ncapabilities and their impact in Indian organizations.\nAkeytounderstandthesuccessandfailureofKMwithin\norganizations is the identification and assessment\nof capabilities for successful KM effectiveness and\norganizational performance. In this study, therefore,\nthe research questions are:\nWhich KM capabilities would impact knowledge\neffectiveness in the organizations?\nWhich capability is more critical in impacting\nknowledge effectiveness: knowledge infrastructure\ncapabilities or knowledge process capabilities?\nKnowledge Management Capabilities\nTocompeteeffectively,firmsmustleveragetheirexisting\nknowledge and create new knowledge that favourably\npositions them in their chosen markets. In order to\naccomplish this, firms must develop an `absorptive\ncapacity'--the ability to use prior knowledge to\nrecognize the value of new information, assimilate it,\nand apply it to create new knowledge and capabilities.\nGold et al. (2001) have developed a model of KM based\non the capabilities perspective. They refer to three key\ninfrastructure capabilities--technical, structural, and\ncultural--that enable the maximization of social capital\n(intangible capital).\nIn order to leverage infrastructure, KM processes\nmust also be present in order to store, transform, and\ntransport knowledge throughout the organization\nenable the organization to capture, reconcile, and\ntransfer knowledge in an efficient manner. Together, the\nperspectives of infrastructure and processes provide a\nuseful theoretical foundation for defining important\naspects of knowledge effectiveness in organizations\n(Figure 1).\nInfrastructure Capabilities\nInformation Technology\nAccording to Gold et al. (2001), technology comprises\na crucial element of the structural dimension needed\nto mobilize social capital for the creation of new\nknowledge. `Technology is able to overcome the\nbarriers of time and space that would otherwise be\nlimiting factors in KM activities. It also serves as a\nrepository in which knowledge can be reliably stored\nand efficiently retrieved' (Chua, 2004). The entire\ntechnology infrastructure used in Organizational\nKnowledge Management Systems (OKMS) is tangible\nand it acts as an enabler for facilitating KM initiatives\nin the organizations.\nAccording to Meso and Smith (2000), technology\ninfrastructure comprises the hardware, software,\nmiddleware, and protocols that allow for the encoding\nand electronic exchange of knowledge. Four types of\ntechnology infrastructure are found in an OKMS:\nFigure 1: Knowledge Management Capabilities and Organizational Effectiveness\nSource: Authors' conceptualization.\n1. Knowledge-oriented technologies, such as groupware\nand web browsers that directly process knowledge\nwork and facilitate sharing of knowledge within\nthe organization.\n2. Function-oriented technologies, such as office\nautomation, robotics, and desktop computing\ntechnologies support operational level activities\nsuch as data processing, production, and service\ndelivery while collecting the data.\n3. Specialty oriented technologies support highly\nspecialized functions within the firm and usually\nrequire high levels of know-how. Examples of these\ntechnologies include computer-aided design and\nmanufacture (CAD/CAM) software, and expert\nsystems software (Davenport, De Long, & Beers,\n4. Social networking technologies supported through Web\n2.0 is seen as a major facilitator of collaboration and\ninformation dissemination in an organization (Nieves\nTechnology infrastructure provides the base or plat-\nform upon which KM solutions are built. It consists of\nthe repositories for unstructured data (document and\ncontent management) and structured data (data ware-\nhousing, generation, and management). Groupware is\nalso a part of infrastructure as it supports the collabora-\ntion needed for knowledge sharing (Duffy, 2001).\nAccording to Yeh, Lai, and Ho (2006), IT that supports\nand coordinates KM are: databases, knowledge\nplatforms, performance evaluation management\nsystem, and integrated performance support system.\nZack (1999) believes that IT plays four different roles\nin KM: (a) obtaining knowledge; (b) defining, storing,\ncategorizing, indexing, and linking knowledge-related\ndigital items; (c) seeking and identifying related\ncontents; and (d) flexibly expressing the content based\non the various utilization backgrounds.\nThe technology-centred OKMS today are employing\none technology or a combination of several key\ntechnologies like groupware, messaging, web browsers,\ndocument management, search and retrieval, data and\ntext mining, visualization, push technology, group\ndecision support, and intelligent agents. Knowledge\nportals (internet and intranet) are the most common\ninfrastructure and play an important role in KM.\n \nAccording to Gold et al. (2001), structure is defined as\nthe rules, policies, procedures, and processes, hierarchy\nof reporting relationships, incentive systems, and\ndepartmental boundaries that organize designs within\nthe firm. Maturana and Varela (1980) define structure as\n`the actual static or dynamic components plus the actual\nrelations that take place between them'. According to\nMintzberg (1994), the organizations most frequently\ngroup their employees based on knowledge and skills,\nwork process and function, time, output, client, or\nplace. An organization's structure is largely determined\nby the variety one finds in its environment. Mintzberg\nidentifies four types of organizational forms, which are\nassociated with four combinations of complexity.\nEbert and Griffin (2005) define organizational\nstructure as the specification of jobs to be done within\nan organization and the ways in which those jobs\nrelate to one another. According to Gold et al. (2001),\norganizational structure is the second most critical\nfactor for successful KM implementation. Hasanali\n(2002) highlights structure as one among five critical\nsuccess factors for KM. Organizational structure\nhas been identified as a major KM enabler by many\nresearchers in literature (Bose, 2004; Chourides,\nAlthoughintendedtorationalizeindividualfunctionsor\nunits within an organization, structural elements have\noften had the unintended consequence of inhibiting\ncollaboration and sharing of knowledge across internal\norganizational boundaries. It is important that the\norganizational structures be designed for flexibility (as\nopposed to rigidity) so that they encourage sharing and\ncollaboration. Managers have realized that bureaucratic\nstructuresslowdowntheprocessesandraiseconstraints\non information flow. In addition, such procedures often\nconsume great amount of time in order for knowledge\nto filter through every level. Al-Alawi, Marzooqi, and\nMohammed (2007) and Syed-Ikhsan and Rowland\n(2004) argue that knowledge sharing prospers with\nstructures that support ease of information flow with\nfewer boundaries between divisions.\nAs the traditional orthodox organizational structure is\ninadequateforaknowledge-basedorganization(Nonaka\n& Takeuchi, 1995), a new organic organization structure\nthat encourages effective and efficient communication is\nrequiredtofosterknowledgecreationandsharing.Often\nKM models report the need for flatter organizational\nstructures based on loosely coupled teams that form\nnetworks of functions for the organization (Van Beveren,\n2003). A flexible structure would allow the formation of\nad hoc cross-functional teams in which experts from\ndifferent departments can be gathered to facilitate the\nflow of ideas across departments, or provide venues for\nemployees to communicate informally. Conventional\norganizational structures need to be transformed to\nsupport the development of a knowledge structure\nNonaka and Takeuchi (1995) develop a new\norganizational structure, the hypertext organization\nthat enables their five-stage process of knowledge\ncreationtooccurefficientlywithintheorganization.This\nis a combination of a formal organizational structure\nand a non-hierarchical, self-organizing organizational\nstructure. However, a similar effect can be achieved\nthrough maintaining the formal hierarchical structure\nand adding the dimension of flexibility. Gold et al.\na hybrid organization structure for smooth KM\nimplementation. In such a structure, there are mixed\npositions with varying degree of KM and functional\nroles. Matrix structures and an emphasis on leadership\nfacilitate greater knowledge sharing primarily by\ncutting across departmental boundaries.\nAs discussed earlier, some of the constituents of\norganization structure are flexibility, modularity, policy,\nand processes like rewards and incentive systems.\nStudies have also proposed creation of several KM roles\n(rather than exclusive KM jobs) which include chief\nknowledge officer (CKO), knowledge programmers,\nportal managers, content managers, and knowledge\nthe view that some specialist positions are necessary for\ndeveloping knowledge structure in the organizations.\nThese structures are sustainable because: (a) people\nin KM positions are also involved in core business\nactivities; (b) each functional division undertakes a\npart of KM costs with embedded KM roles; (c) KM\nprogrammes are integrated with functional divisions.\nAnother constituent of organization structure is the\nimportance given to team work. If the organization\nstructure is matrix-based as opposed to a bureaucratic\nhierarchical base, it encourages team work. In module\nand hypertext structure mentioned earlier, teams may\nbe formed for specific objectives, for example, R&D. A\nflexible structure would allow the formation of ad hoc\ncross-functional teams in which experts from different\ndepartments can be gathered to ease the flow of ideas\nacross departments, or provide venues for employees\nto communicate informally.\nMany researchers have discovered that incentives and\nrewards play a major role in KM (Alavi & Leidner,\nimprove the amount of support that employees are\nwilling to give to activities of KM (Yeh et al., 2006) but\nalso enhance willingness to participate in knowledge\ncreation and sharing. Choy (2006) refers to performance\nmeasurement as the key KM component for successful\nKM implementation. Al-Alawi et al. (2007) state that\nrewards must be based on group/team rather than\nindividual performance. Oliver and Kandadi (2006)\nemphasize two points: (a) indirect rewards such as\nappreciation and recognition play a greater role than\nthe monetary incentives; (b) long-term rewards such as\nprofit sharing and employee share option (ESOPs) are\nmore effective means than the short-term incentives.\nWalczak (2005) observes that any knowledge that is\nexternalized into explicit form should be rewarded.\nHowever, this knowledge being further reused by\nother employees within the organization should also\nbe associated with rewards.\n \nOrganizational culture is very important in leveraging\nKM. It has been considered both as a facilitator\nand a hurdle/barrier for effective KM. Culture of\nan organization has key influence on KM, more\nspecifically, on the effectiveness of knowledge (Chase,\nTyler (1871) was the first to provide a formal description\nof the term `culture'. He defined the term as: `that\ncomplex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art,\nmorals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and\nhabits acquired by man as a member of society'. Steven\n(1989) notes that organizational culture is akin to the\nculture of the society in which the organization operates.\nThis view considers organizational culture as a micro-\nculture within the culture of a given society or nation.\nSince then many authors have defined organizational\ncultureasthecombinationofvalue,corebelief,behaviour\nmodel, and emblem. It represents the value system of\nthe company and will become the employees' behaviour\nnorm. Every organization's culture is an independent\nentity different from any other organization (Yeh et\nal., 2006). These cultural features of an organization\nmay deviate from cultures of their respective societies\nSince there is a crucial role of organizational culture\nin KM, it is imperative to know how to influence and\ndevelop knowledge culture in an organization. Oliver\nand Kandadi (2006) have defined knowledge culture as:\n`Away of organizational life that enables and motivates\npeople to create, share and utilize knowledge for the\nbenefit and enduring success of the organization.'\nThe presence of a `knowledge culture' is critical to\nthe success of KM within an organization (De Long &\nas it signals a managerial commitment to KM initiatives\nand promotes sharing of tacit knowledge for higher\nquality decision-making.\nIn the KM literature, a wide array of factors and concepts\nare cited as influencing elements for the creation and\ndevelopment of knowledge culture. These include\norganizational structure, people, reward systems,\nleadership, business processes, and information systems\n(Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000; Wenger, McDermott, &\nSnyder, 2002). Shaping culture is central to firm's ability\nto manage its knowledge more effectively (De Long,\n1997). This article discusses several variables studied\nin the literature that build the knowledge culture in\nan organization. Interaction between individuals is\nessential in building innovative culture (Arrow, 1962;\nbetween individuals or groups are often the basis for the\ncreation of new ideas and can, therefore, be viewed as\nhaving the potential for creating knowledge.\nEmployee interactions should be encouraged, both\nformally and informally. This type of interaction and\ncollaboration is important in shaping organizational\nculture conducive for KM. Instances like sharing\ninformation freely, working closely with others, and\ndeveloping friends at work relate to interaction and\ncollaboration. Many authors have defined a form of\ninteraction where experienced workers or managers\ntransfer knowledge to new or less experienced workers\naspartoftheirorganizationculture.Al-Alawietal.(2007)\nrefer to the communication between staff measured by\nhigh level of face-to-face interaction, use of common\nlanguage, and team work discussion and collaboration\nas constituents of a knowledge enhancing culture.\nAnother important component of culture is corporate\nthat permeates the organization to provide people with\na needed sense of purpose that transcends everyday\nactivities. Through an articulated and communicated\nvision, it is possible to engender a sense of involvement\nand contribution among employees (O'Dell & Grayson,\n1998). A system of corporate values determines the\ntypes of knowledge that are desired and the types of\nknowledge related activities that are tolerated and\nand openness are commonly cited as two of these\nexplicitly stated values that promote KM behaviours.\nOliver and Kandadi (2006) refer to openness, to change,\nand to experimentation as important constituents of a\nknowledge enhancing culture.\nLeadership at various levels of management (Oliver\n& Kandadi, 2006) is also an important constituent\nfor developing knowledge culture in organizations.\nThe attributes include empowering and involving\nemployees. Leadership is required to develop a desired\nculture and, hence, to develop knowledge culture\nas well. The middle and front level managers play\nan important role in developing knowledge culture\nthrough the manifestation of various leadership\ncharacteristics. Senior managers need to understand\nthe value of KM and are willing to support and play\nan aggressive role in decision-making. According\nto Davenport et al. (1998), one of the key successful\nfactors is the support of senior managers and it\nincludes: (a) conveying the information that KM and\norganizational learning are key to the success of an\norganization; (b) clarifying what kind of knowledge\nis important to the organization; and (c) providing\nfinancial and other resources to build the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of KM.\nKnowledge Process Capabilities\nIn today's globally competitive environment,\nknowledge-intensive organizations gain knowledge\nand wisdom through their business activities. The\nadherence of organizations to inflexible, ad hoc,\nand indirect approaches can enable them to build\nan environment facilitating KM but have limited\ncontribution towards facilitating knowledge as a\nstrategic asset and, thus, is a big corporate challenge.\nThus, we look at KM processes as those that would help\nus build knowledge as a strategic resource which along\nwith infrastructure capabilities will drive knowledge\neffectiveness and organizational performance.\nDistinct knowledge processes are modelled in a\nlife cycle model which permits further analysis of\nrequirements for the support of KM activity in each\nprocess. The processes of KM lifecycle approach\nrelate to the fact that organizations utilize internal\nand external sources of knowledge. This knowledge\nhas to be made available to the concerned people\nin the organization. Thus, a KM cycle starts with\ncreation and/or acquisition of knowledge which\nhas to be organized, mapped, and/or formalized\nto transform it in reusable form. It has to be made\naccessible to people, or disseminated, and/or shared\nwith everyone in the organization. Finally, it has to be\napplied, used, reused, and/or exploited for achieving\nthe organizational benefits. Gold et al. (2001) have\ngrouped them into four broad dimensions of process\ncapability acquiring knowledge, converting it into\nuseful form, applying or using it, and protecting it.\nAcquisition, storage, dissemination, and application\nare identified as dimensions of process capability.\nAcquisition Process\nAcquisition-oriented KM processes are oriented\ntowards obtaining knowledge. However, prior to\nacquisition, an organization must know the knowledge\nit has within the organization in some form or other,\nand the knowledge gaps. This sub-process is called\nknowledge audit. Along with knowing the current\nposition, an organization should make efforts to\nacquire knowledge and create new knowledge by using\nprocesses and tools for the same. Many terms have\nbeen used to describe these processes: acquire, discover,\nseek, generate, create, capture, and collaborate. All of these\nterms have a common theme--the accumulation of\nknowledge. Innovation, another aspect of acquisition,\nis the creation of new knowledge from the application\nof existing knowledge. This requires concerted effort\nand a high degree of experience in recognizing and\ncapturing new knowledge (Drucker, 1993). Improved\nuse of existing knowledge and more effective\nacquisition of new knowledge is also a key aspect of\nacquisition (Thurow, 1996). These processes take place\nsimultaneously rather than in a sequential manner.\nThe creation of organizational knowledge requires\ncollaboration of personal experiences (Inkpen & Dinur,\n1998). Collaboration takes place at two levels within\nthe organization: between individuals and between\nthe organization and its network of business partners.\nCollaboration between individuals brings together\nindividual differences (e.g., cognitive style, preferred\ntools, backgrounds, experiences, etc.) and can be used to\ncreate knowledge (Leonard-Barton, 1995). This assumes\nthat interaction between the individuals will promote\nlearning(Teece,1998).Collaborationbetweenindividuals\nis also the basis for socialization (Nonaka & Takeuchi,\n1995).However,theabilitytoacquireknowledgeispartly\nbased on an organization's absorptive capacity (Cohen\n& Levinthal, 1990). This is because all the necessary\nskills for innovation may not be found within a single\norganization (Inkpen & Beamish, 1997) and, hence, is the\nneed to collaborate with partners.\nStorage Process\nStorage KM processes are oriented towards making\nexisting knowledge available at a central location,\neasily accessible by everyone. Some of the processes\nthat enable knowledge conversion are a firm's ability to\norganize (Davenport & Klahr, 1998), integrate (Grant,\n1996), combine, structure, coordinate (Miller, Friesen,\norganization must develop a framework for organizing\nor structuring its knowledge (O'Dell & Grayson,\n1998). Without common representation standards,\nconsistency or common dialogue of knowledge would\nnot exist. This would make it difficult to effectively\nmanage the asset. Knowledge about a particular subject\nmay reside in different parts of the organization or in\ndifferent systems within the organization. Combining\nor integrating this knowledge reduces redundancy,\nenhances consistent representation, and improves\nefficiency by eliminating excess volume.\nThus, it is important for organizations to store\nknowledge in a user-friendly, easily accessible form.\nExplicit knowledge can be stored as best practices or\nlessons learned databases. For tacit knowledge, the\nconversion process makes available corporate portals\nfor accessing the expertise locator system.\nDissemination Process\nKnowledge dissemination process refers to the\nprocess of sharing among the employees in an\norganization. Many organizations may just hoard\nthe knowledge, thinking that people will access\nthe same and use it. Effective retrieval mechanisms\nallow for quick and easy access and sharing of\nknowledge. For explicit knowledge, web portals and\norganization intranet can play a crucial role. Using\ntext mining techniques to mine relevant knowledge\nis characteristic of knowledge dissemination of\nunstructured knowledge. Using intelligent agents\nto actively build user profiles and push appropriate\nlessons learned and material to user is another way\nof knowledge dissemination. Chat rooms, bulletin\nboards, online communications, communities of\npractices, etc., on organization intranet also facilitate\nknowledge sharing. However, for tacit knowledge\nsharing, the knowledge conversion process makes\navailable corporate portals for accessing the expertise\nlocator system, but the dissemination process should\nfacilitate frequent get-togethers such as knowledge\nfairs, seminars, and informal gatherings.\nApplication Process\nKnowledge application processes are processes\noriented towards the use of knowledge. Having a\ncomprehensive KM system is of no utility if employees\nof the organization are not using the same and\norganization is not able to see the impact of the same\non its business performance.\nIt is important that KM helps the organization to use\nthe acquired knowledge to adjust strategic direction,\nsolve new problems, and improve efficiency. A regular\nreview is, therefore, required to know what has worked\nwell and what has not during the lifecycle of KM.\nThese processes also enable the organization to replace\nknowledge that has become outdated.\nKnowledge Management Effectiveness\nMeasuring KM effectiveness and its contribution to the\norganizational performance is a key concern of many\norganizations. As knowledge is an intangible strategic\nasset of an organization, measuring it is a challenge.\nSeveral approaches have been tried to measure this\nintangibleassetbutcontributiontobusinessperformance\nis still a major research agenda. In our KM model, we\npropose that a good KM infrastructure and process\nwould improve KM effectiveness and would lead to\nbetter organization performance. Thus, an organization\nmay invest in the KM systems but organizational\nperformance would depend on the effectiveness of KM\nsystems, which in turn depend on infrastructure and\nprocess capabilities of an organization. Anantatmula\n(2007) defines KM effectiveness in terms of useful\nKM outcomes, such as improved communication,\nenhanced collaboration, improved employee skills,\nbetter decision-making, and improved productivity.\nAnantatmula's (2007) research has shown that the\nattributes of KM effectiveness can lead to improvements\nin performance such as customer satisfaction through\nbetter product or service quality. This is possible due\nto a learning environment, employee development,\neffective communication tools, and knowledge sharing.\nEmpirical Studies on Knowledge Management\nEffectiveness and Processes\nPrevious studies have considered relationship between\norganizational culture and organizational effectiveness\n(Park et al., 2014). Also studied is the impact of\norganizational culture on KM success (Zheng, 2005).\nOrganization culture and processes have influence\non KM effectiveness (Park, 2006). Mooradian, Renzl,\nand Matzler (2006) study the relationship between\norganizational culture and the knowledge sharing\nprocess at the team level. Moon and Lee (2014) study\nthe mediating effect of the knowledge sharing process.\nTeo and Bhattacherjee (2014) examine infrastructural\ncapability as an antecedent of knowledge transfer and\nutilization. Further, infrastructural capabilities have also\nbeen studied in terms of a KM capability between supply\nrelationship management and performance (Tseng, 2014).\nDespite different theoretical studies and assertion, the\ndirectimpactoftheinfrastructuralandprocesscapabilities\nhas not been studied. This study explores the impact of\nthese capabilities. Thus, our research hypothesis is:\nHypothesis 1: There is significant impact of organization\nKM infrastructure capabilities on KM effectiveness.\nHypothesis 2: There is significant impact of organization\nKM processes capabilities on KM effectiveness.\nInstrument Development and Data Collection\nThe unit of analysis in this study was an organization.\nThe objective was to measure the KM practices of\nlarge Indian organizations. The latest list of 1,000 large\nIndian organizations available in The Economics Times\n(2010) was taken as the sample. The literature related\nto KM capabilities was reviewed in order to specify the\nmeasures. Data was gathered through a survey that\ntapped responses from ET 1000 companies in India.\nDirect telephonic conversations were made to introduce\nthe objectives and to identify the contact person for\nthe survey. A total of 156 filled questionnaires were\nreceived, the response rate being 15.6 per cent. The\nrespondents were asked to evaluate the items using\nthe Likert scale of 1\u00ad5 (1 being strongly disagree and 5\nbeing strongly agree).\nData Analysis and Results\nThe goal of structured equation modelling (SEM) is\nto determine a valid causal model. The advantage\nof structured equation model is that, it can test the\nentire system of variables in a hypothesized model.\nThus it enables the assessment of the consistency of\nthe model with data (Byrne, 1998). SEM is chosen so\nthat the causal relationships between construct and\nmultiple measurement items could be tested (J\u00f6reskog\nReliability of Constructs\nCronbach's a was used to assess the internal consistency\nof the proposed constructs. Cronbach's a is a widely\nused metrics for reliability evaluation (Koufteros et\nconsidered reliable (Field, 2009). Table 1 shows that\nthere is high internal consistency for every variable.\nTable 1: Validity and Internal Consistency Check\nComposite\nReliability\nAverage Variance\nExtracted\nMaximum Shared\nVariance\nAverage Shared\nVariance\nCronbach's a\nSource: Authors' assessment.\nTable 2: Model Fit Summary for the Research Model\nFit Index Model Recommendation\nDegrees of Freedom 25 n/a\nAdjusted Goodness of Fit\nRoot Means Square Error\nSource: Authors' computation.\nPath Model\nThe path model and the hypotheses (H1 and H2)\nwere examined. The path coefficients and p-values\nare shown in Table 3. Hypothesis H1 is supported,\nwhich means knowledge infrastructural capabilities\nhave a significant positive impact on organizational\nH2 is also supported, that is, process capabilities\nhave a significant positive impact on organizational\nshows the results of the research model.\nTable 3: Path Coefficients and p-Value\nHypotheses Paths Path\nCoefficient\nResults\nKnowledge Management\nInfrastructural\nCapabilities->\nKnowledge Management\nEffectiveness\nKnowledge Management\nProcess Capabilities->\nKnowledge Management\nEffectiveness\nSource: Authors' computation.\nStructured Equation Model\nThe model was examined using SEM in AMOS 4 in two\nportions: (a) the measurement model, for checking the\nadequacy of measurement properties of the variables\nand (b) the path model, for checking the significance\nin the relationships among variables. The overall fit of\na hypothesized model was tested by using AMOS (a\nsoftware package for SEM) output and other fit indices\nsuch as the ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom,\ngoodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted GFI (AGFI),\ncomparative fit index (CFI), root mean square residual\n(RMSR), root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA), standardized residual, and modification\nindex (MI).\nMeasurement Model\nThe measurement model was checked for internal\nconsistency, convergent validity, and discriminant\nvalidity. For convergent validity, the values of\nComposite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance\nExtracted (AVE) should be greater than 0.7 and 0.5,\nrespectively. For discriminant validity of the constructs,\nthe values of Maximum Shared Variance (MSV) and\nAverage Shared Variance (ASV) should be less than\nAVE (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2010).\nTable 1 shows that all the variables exhibit a convergent\nand discriminant validity.\nThe measurement model with three variables constructs\nwas assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. All\nthe factor loadings exceeded 0.5 and each indicator\nwas found to be significant at 0.01 significant levels. To\nassess the model fit, the chi-square (c\u00b2) values (Kline,\nmean square error of approximation (Steiger, 1990)\nwere reported. These indexes ensure that an improved\noverall fit is provided relative to the null model. The CFI\nand GFI have been considered the best approximations,\nwith values greater than or equal to 0.90 considered\nSegars & Grover, 1993). RMSEA is a measure of the\naverage standardized residual per degree of freedom; a\nfavourable value is less than or equal to 0.10 (Browne &\nThe results shown in Table 2 confirm a good level of fit\nfor the model.\nFigure 2: Path Coefficients in the Research Model\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nThis is the first study for large Indian organizations\nand is in line with the other studies conducted\nelsewhere. Large Indian organizations have started\nrealizing the importance of managing knowledge\nas a strategic asset. However, the approach towards\nKM varies. Some organizations rely more on creating\na knowledge culture in an organization while\nothers emphasize the need for a process approach\nto manage both tacit and explicit knowledge within\nthe organization. As illustrated in Table 3, the\npaths between KM infrastructure capabilities and\nknowledge effectiveness are positive and significant.\nHence, it can be concluded that infrastructure\ncapabilities that constitute culture, structure, and IT\ninfrastructure play an important role in improving\norganization effectiveness mainly resulting in\nimproved communication, enhanced collaboration,\nimproved employee skills, better decision-making,\nand improved productivity. It has been observed that\nculture of an organization is very deep rooted and to\nbring about structural changes within an organization\nis not that easy as it requires policy level changes.\nHowever, large organizations are process centric and\nimplementing processes is easier. Thus, technology\nimplementation and building and implementing KM\nprocesses would impact knowledge effectiveness\nsignificantly as it is easy to implement processes than\nto bring about changes in culture and structure.\nA response rate of 15.6 per cent can give rise to\ninaccuracy in the survey data due to sampling bias. It\nis a limitation and effort should be made to improve\nit. Together, these results suggest that capabilities can\nprovide a useful benchmark for KM within the firm.\nHowever, it is important to carry out further research\nin linking infrastructure and process variables of\nKM with the firm's performance. It will, thus, give a\nsignificant tool to the managers to further implement\nsuch activities in their organizations.\nREFERENCES\nAl-Alawi, A. I., Al-Marzooqi, N. Y., & Mohammed, Y. F.\n(2007).
