    "abstract": "Abstract--Increased production of organic acid can result in an elevated serum anion gap and may play a role in the\ndevelopment of hypertension. We studied the cross-sectional associations between anion gap and blood pressure and\nExamination Surveys. We included 5043 adult participants who were not taking antihypertensive medications or\ndiuretics and who denied hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other diseases. Linear regression was used\nto adjust for age, race, body mass index, creatinine, albumin, and other factors. Sample weights were used to produce\nweighted regression parameters. In the lowest quintile of anion gap, mean values of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate\nwere 139 mEq/L, 105 mEq/L, and 25 mEq/L, respectively. In the highest quintile, mean values of sodium, chloride, and\nmultivariable adjustment, participants in the highest quintile of anion gap had systolic blood pressure 3.73 mm Hg\nhigher (95% CI: 1.83 to 5.63 mm Hg; P for trend: 0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile. Participants in the\nhighest quintile of bicarbonate had systolic blood pressure 2.73 mm Hg lower (95% CI: 1.26 to 4.20 mm Hg; P for trend:\n0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile. No associations were observed between anion gap or bicarbonate and\ndiastolic blood pressure. The results were unchanged after excluding participants with estimated glomerular filtration\nrate 60 cc/min per 1.73 m2. The anion gap is independently associated with higher blood pressure.

Farwell\n Key Words: epidemiology  hypertension  anion gap  metabolic acidosis  NHANES\nHypertension affects 65 million individuals in the\nUnited States1,2 and is an important independent risk\nfactor for cardiovascular disease3\u00ad6 and renal failure.7\u00ad9 The\npathogenesis of hypertension is poorly understood and re-\nmains under active investigation. It has been suggested that\nincreased production of organic acid may lead to the devel-\nopment of hypertension.10\nMetabolic acidosis, increased renal acid excretion, and in-\ncreased metabolic production of acid have been reported in rat\nmodels of hypertension and in salt-sensitive humans. For exam-\nple, plasma pH and bicarbonate were lower in spontaneously\nhypertensive rats than in normotensive controls.11,12 Metabolic\nacidosis preceded the development of hypertension in the hy-\npertensive rats, suggesting that the acid-base changes were not\nthe product of elevated blood pressure or associated renal\ninsufficiency.12 Metabolic studies of rats on both high- and\nlow-salt diets have demonstrated increased urinary acid excre-\ntion in salt-sensitive compared with salt-resistant rats.13 Of note,\nthe higher levels of acid excretion in the salt-sensitive rats\nappeared to be because of increased metabolic production of acid.13\nAnalogous results have been reported in salt-sensitive humans.14,15\nThe results of a recent study analyzing the 24-hour excre-\ntion of urinary citrate in 3000 men and women are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of organic\nacid production may be related to high blood pressure. The\nexcretion of urinary citrate is regulated most prominently by\nacid-base status, with acidosis resulting in a marked reduction\nin citrate excretion.16 After adjustment for age, body mass\nindex (BMI), diet, and other urinary factors, participants with\nhypocitraturia were 2.5 times more likely to have prevalent\nhypertension than those without hypocitraturia.17\nTo date, there have been no population-based studies of\nacid-base status and blood pressure. An increase in unmea-\nsured anions, as seen in many causes of metabolic acidosis,\nresults in an elevated serum anion gap. We examined the\nassociations between serum anion gap and blood pressure and\nbetween serum bicarbonate and blood pressure in the 1999\u00ad\nnation Surveys (NHANES).\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe design and operation of NHANES has been described previously\n(data downloaded from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/\nFrom the Renal Division and Channing Laboratory (E.N.T., J.P.F.) and Division of Aging (W.R.F.), Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's\nHospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass; and the Department of Medicine (W.R.F.), Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boston, Mass.\nCorrespondence to Eric N.

After selection in a\ncomplex survey design, participants were interviewed and examined.\nParticipants over the age of 12 years without hemophilia or recent\ncancer chemotherapy were eligible for measurement of a biochem-\nistry profile that included serum chemistries and creatinine. In the\ninterview, participants were asked about their medical history, including\nthe presence or absence of health professional\u00addiagnosed hypertension,\nkidney disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, coronary\nheart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and other\ndiseases. Participants were also queried about the use of specific\nmedications, including antihypertensive medications and diuretics. Par-\nticipants were defined as current smokers if they reported that they were\ncurrently smoking and had smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire life.\nA dietary interview collected data for estimating the daily intake of\ndietary factors, including total protein and potassium, on the basis of\nfoods and beverages that participants consumed during the 24-hour\nperiod preceding the interview (midnight to midnight).\nMeasurement of Serum Electrolytes\nand Creatinine\nSerum electrolytes, albumin, and creatinine were measured with a\nHitachi Model 704 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim\nDiagnostics). We calculated anion gap according to the following\nequation:\nAnion gapserum sodium (mEq/L)\n[serum chloride (mEq/L)serum bicarbonate (mEq/L)]\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the\nsimplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study prediction\nequation.20 Specifically, estimated GFR186.3(serum creatinine in\nvalues with the creatinine assay used in the development of the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.21,22 Serum creati-\nMeasurement of Blood Pressure\nBlood pressure was determined by mercury sphygmomanometer\naccording to American Heart Association guidelines.23 Three or 4\nblood pressure determinations (systolic and diastolic) were taken on\nall of the eligible individuals.

We divided the serum anion gap\ninto quintiles. Within each quintile of anion gap, we calculated the\npercentage of each categorical demographic characteristic and the\nmean value (SE) of age, BMI, each laboratory measurement, and\nblood pressure. Race-ethnicity was predefined in NHANES 1999\u00ad\nMexican American, or other. In linear regression analyses, systolic\nand diastolic blood pressures were examined as dependent variables,\nwith quintiles of serum anion gap (or continuous anion gap) as the\nindependent variables. Covariates considered were age; gender;\nrace/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,\nother); BMI (continuous); smoking (current, past, or never); serum\nlevels of creatinine, albumin, calcium, and potassium (continuous);\nand daily intakes of total protein and potassium (continuous). We\ncalculated 95% CIs for parameter estimates of both systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure. Tests of trend were calculated across\nquintiles of anion gap with the median value of each quintile serving\nas an ordinal variable. All Ps were 2 sided. We also used logistic\nregression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs of abnormal\nblood pressure (defined by the seventh report of the Joint National\nCommittee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nHigh Blood Pressure as systolic blood pressure 120, diastolic\nblood pressure 80, or both1) by quintile of anion gap. We\nperformed similar analyses with bicarbonate, rather than anion gap,\nas the independent variable.\nData analysis was performed with SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0.\nNational Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nmeasurements of serum electrolytes and creatinine and de-\nnied the use of antihypertensive medications or diuretics.\nAfter excluding individuals with self-reported hypertension,\nchronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart fail-\nure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina,\ncerebrovascular disease, and cancer (except nonmelanoma skin\ncancer) and individuals with measured albumin 3.5 g/dL\nparticipants remaining in the study population. Characteristics of\nthese participants are shown in Table 1. Because the relations\namong anion gap, serum bicarbonate, and blood pressure did not\nvary by sex, results for men and women were combined.\nSerum anion gap was positively associated with systolic\nblood pressure in age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted\nanalyses (Table 2). After adjusting for age, gender, race,\nBMI, creatinine, and albumin, systolic blood pressure in-\neach milliequivalent-per-liter increase in serum anion gap.\nAfter multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest\nquintile of anion gap had systolic blood pressure 3.73 mm Hg\nparticipants in the lowest quintile.

To determine the association between\nbicarbonate and blood pressure independent of serum sodium\nand chloride concentrations, we included serum sodium and\nchloride in the multivariable models.

The\nTaylor et al Anion Gap and Blood Pressure 321\nrelation between bicarbonate and diastolic blood pressure was\nnot statistically significant.\nFinally, we performed analyses excluding the 126 partici-\npants with chronic kidney disease (defined by calculated GFR\nresults were similar to the primary analysis. After adjusting\nfor age, gender, race, BMI, creatinine, and albumin, partici-\npants in the highest quintile of anion gap had systolic blood\nP for trend: 0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile.\nFurther adjustment for smoking, serum calcium, serum po-\ntassium, and dietary intake of total protein and potassium did\nnot materially change the results.\nDiscussion\nof serum anion gap were associated with higher blood\npressure. This relation was independent of age, gender, race,\nBMI, and levels of serum creatinine and albumin. Because\nour study excluded participants who reported cardiovascular\ndisease, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, or other\ndiseases and excluded participants taking antihypertensive\nmedications or diuretics, it is unlikely that illness or medica-\ntion use confounded the observed relation between serum\nanion gap and blood pressure. Of note, the mean values of\nserum electrolytes and blood pressure in our study were in\nranges considered normal.\nThe cause of the observed association between higher anion\ngap and higher blood pressure is unknown. Elevations in the\nserum anion gap can result from an increase in unmeasured\nanions, as in several causes of metabolic acidosis, or from a\ndecrease in unmeasured cations.24 In general, reductions in\nserum calcium and potassium concentrations are unusual causes\nTABLE 1.

Serum albumin can also affect the anion gap,25\nbut we excluded individuals with low serum albumin, and we\nadjusted for albumin in the multivariate analyses. A mild\nelevation in anion gap has been reported in metabolic alkalosis,26\nbut we are unaware of data linking metabolic alkalosis to higher\nblood pressure, and in our study higher serum bicarbonate was\nnot associated with higher blood pressure.\nIt is possible that the participants in our study with higher\nanion gap had a circulating unmeasured anion that contrib-\nuted to higher blood pressure. The inverse relation between\nserum bicarbonate and blood pressure suggests that such an\nanion, if present, may be the conjugate base of an organic\nacid. Of interest, metabolic acidosis, increased renal acid\nexcretion, and increased metabolic production of acid have been\nreported in rat models of hypertension. For example, lower\nplasma pH and bicarbonate have been reported in spontaneously\nhypertensive rats and Milan hypertensive rats compared with\nWistar Kyoto and Milan normotensive control rats.11,12 Meta-\nbolic acidosis preceded the development of hypertension in\nyoung spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting that the\nacid-base changes were not the product of elevated blood\npressure or associated renal insufficiency.12 Metabolic studies of\nDahl/Rapp salt-sensitive and salt-resistant control rats on both\nhigh- and low-salt diets have demonstrated increased urinary\nacid excretion in salt-sensitive compared with salt-resistant\ncontrol rats.13 Of note, the higher levels of acid excretion in the\nDahl/Rapp salt-sensitive rats appeared to be because of in-\ncreased metabolic production of acid.13\nHuman data suggesting a possible link between organic acid\nproduction and high blood pressure are sparse but provocative.\nIn a metabolic study of 40 healthy normotensive young men\nconsuming controlled diets, there was an inverse association\nbetween increases in blood pressure induced by a high-sodium\ndiet and both arterial pH and serum bicarbonate (of note, levels\nof arterial pH and bicarbonate were in ranges considered normal\nin both salt-sensitive and salt-resistant participants).15 The inves-\ntigators then administered an ammonium chloride load to a\nsubset of these study participants, who again consumed con-\ntrolled high- and low-sodium diets.14 There was no difference in\nrenal net acid excretion between the salt-sensitive and salt-resis-\ntant groups, suggesting that the relative metabolic acidosis in\nsalt-sensitive individuals was a result of increased production of\nacid rather than a defect in renal acid excretion.\nMore recent data are also consistent with the hypothesis\nthat increased metabolic production of acid results in higher\nblood pressure. The excretion of urinary citrate is regulated\nmost prominently by acid-base status (acidosis results in a\nmarked reduction in urinary citrate),16 and hypertensive\nindividuals excrete less urinary citrate than normotensive\nHealth Study I, the Nurses' Health Study II, and the Health\nProfessionals Follow-up Study, the multivariable ORs of\nprevalent hypertension for those in the highest quartile of\n24-hour urinary citrate excretion compared with the lowest\nsionals Follow-up Study.17 These results were adjusted for age,\nweight, the intake of animal protein and potassium, and urinary\nfactors including calcium, citrate, oxalate, uric acid, sodium,\nmagnesium, potassium, phosphorus, creatinine, pH, and total\nvolume. Finally, we suggest, in a broad and purely speculative\nfashion, that the higher blood pressures observed after adminis-\ntration of sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate or sodium\ncitrate27\u00ad30 may represent a protective effect of alkali on sodium-\nmediated increases in blood pressure.\nOur study has limitations. Because the data are cross-\nsectional, we cannot conclude that an elevated serum anion\ngap is a risk factor for the development of higher blood\npressure. Instead, it is possible that higher blood pressure\nresults in an elevated anion gap because of an unknown\nmechanism. An important limitation to any study of serum\nelectrolytes and blood pressure is that reduced kidney func-\ntion is associated with higher anion gap, lower levels of\nserum bicarbonate, and elevated blood pressure. Previous\nNHANES data demonstrated that serum anion gap started to\nincrease and serum bicarbonate levels started to decrease\nwhen estimated glomerular filtration was 20 cc/min.31\nHowever, in our study we excluded participants with self-\nreported chronic kidney disease, and we adjusted our analyses\nfor serum creatinine. In addition, we performed analyses exclud-\nTABLE 3.

However, we excluded\nparticipants who reported the use of such medications. An\nadditional limitation is that study participants were not eating\ncontrolled diets. Net endogenous acid production is affected by\ndiet,33 and dietary factors play an important role in blood\npressure.34 However, the primary dietary determinants of net\nendogenous acid production are total protein and potassium,35\nand adjustment for the intake of these factors did not change our\nresults. Finally, we did not have measurements of arterial pH or\npartial pressure of carbon dioxide, and we did not have urinary\nparameters to measure renal net acid excretion. Thus, we are\nunable to fully assess the acid-base status of the participants in\nthe study.\nPerspectives\nHigher serum anion gap is independently associated with\nhigher blood pressure. Prospective studies of the relation\nbetween serum anion gap and incident hypertension are\nneeded. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that in-\ncreased production of organic acid plays a role in hypertension\nand should encourage further research into the relation between\nacid-base metabolism and blood pressure.\nSource of Funding\nResearch support was obtained from grant DK73381 from the\nNational Institutes of Health.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
