Why do so many women in North America place\nsuch an emphasis on being thin? Why do these desires lead to eating disorders in only some\nwomen? It is commonly assumed that the desire for a thin female physique and its\nDisordered Eating Behavior\npathological expression in eating disorders result from a social pressure for thinness. In\nrecent years, anorexia nervosa and bulimia have become the most attention grabbing eating\ndisorders with a multitude of studies being published from a variety of perspectives. With\nall this attention, one would think that we would have a concrete understanding of the\ncauses of eating disorders and yet there have been a plethora of theories that have been\nproposed in the literature. We will briefly review the predominant mainstream theories\nbefore discussing evolutionary approaches to the study of dieting behavior and our own\nresearch findings. We would also like to note that we use the term \"disordered eating\nbehavior\" to refer to a range of behaviors including various degrees of dieting from mild\nrestriction to anorexia as we are not considering only those who have a clinical diagnosis\nbut those women who are engaging in dieting that temporarily impairs their reproductive\nfunction.\nPsychoanalytic and Sociocultural Approaches\nEarly psychoanalytic approaches to anorexia focused on refusing to eat being part\nof a struggle for psychological control and autonomy and emphasized the role overly\ncontrolling parents might play in its development (Bruch, 1988). This also led to a family\nsystems approach and the belief that anorexics were trying to regress to a prepubertal state\n(Crisp, 1980). The non-reproductive aspect of such a prepubertal state was not an early\nemphasis but it returned to the spotlight in later evolutionary theorizing about the\nreproductive impact of such excessive dieting.\nSociocultural theories have held the greatest influence in terms of public opinion on\neating disorders (and have also been the focus on many researchers and clinicians) in recent\nyears, attributing major risk to exposure to western ideals of female beauty that focus on a\nExcellent coverage of the sociocultural perspective can be found in reviews by Polivy and\nHerman (2002) and Striegel-Moore and Bulik (2007). At the heart of the cultural models is\nthe idea that eating disorders develop from the internalization of a thin ideal of beauty.\nIndividuals are exposed to such ideals, which they then internalize. When they experience\nan inevitable discrepancy between their self and the ideal, the result is body dissatisfaction\nand extreme dieting behavior. Other factors such as social pressure, class, and\nperfectionism are also used to explain why this cultural ideal affects some young women\nbut not all. However, most of these models focus too much on western media images and\ndo not take into account the role played by interactions between female reproductive roles\nand the social environment. There is an assumption that the western media has created a\nthin standard of beauty. However, cross-cultural explorations of ideal body type suggest\nthat the role of women in a society (valued in traditional reproductive roles vs. modern\nworkplace roles) is an excellent predictor of whether a society has a thin or heavier\nstandard of female beauty (Anderson, Crawford, Nadeau, and Lindberg, 1992). The social\ndominance of women outside the home is a better predictor of a thin standard of beauty\nthan exposure to media images of thinness.\nBiological approaches\nThere has also been some attention paid to the possible influence of genetics,\nparticularly in terms of susceptibility to such cultural forces. Twin studies have suggested\nsome genetic contribution is likely to play a role, though the specifics remain very unclear\nDisordered Eating Behavior\n(Klump, Miller, Keel, McGue, and Iacono, 2001, Striegel-Moore and Bulik, 2007). Studies\nof treated twin samples and twin samples from the general population suggest a heritability\nof close to 70% and also implicate certain alleles as risk factors for anorexia nervosa\nspecifically (Gorwood, Kipman, and Foulon, 2003).\nEvolutionary approaches\nThere have been a number of evolutionary approaches to eating disorders, most\nfocusing on reproductive suppression or female competition for mates or status (for a\nrecent overview of evolutionary approaches to eating disorders, see Kardum, Gracanin, and\nHudek-Knezevic, 2008). Much of the work in this area has focused on the reproductive\nsuppression hypothesis (RSH) which suggests that natural selection shaped a mechanism\nfor adjusting female reproduction to sociological conditions by altering the amount of body\nSince female body fat stores significant amounts of estrogen and converts androgens to\nestrogen, adjusting body fat in response to environmental stress is an effective mechanism\nfor adjusting women's reproduction (Frisch, 1990, 1996). While the threshold varies from\nwoman to woman, and others factors also contribute, most women require adipose tissue to\nmake up about 22% of their body weight to maintain ovulation. In female athletes, for\nexample, who are close to this threshold, menstruation can be turned off or on by the loss\nor gain of only a few pounds. Thus, alterations in the rate of adolescent weight gain or\nweight control in adult lean women (Ellison, 2008; Rippon, Nash, Myburgh, and Noakes,\n1988) could have been an efficient mechanism for adjusting ancestral reproductive effort in\nresponse to environmental conditions.\nIn contemporary western culture, social and ecological cues (such as high levels of\nsocial competition among women and stressful sexual attention from undesirable males),\nwhich would have signaled the need for temporary postponement of reproduction in\nancestral environments, may now be experienced to an unprecedented intensity and\nduration, leading to fears related to fatness and body image (Salmon, Crawford, Dane, and\nZuberbier, 2008). Such a mechanism could also serve to delay puberty in response to\nconditions indicative of a currently poor environment for reproduction (Surbey, 1987).\nSeveral studies (Juda, Campbell, and Crawford, 2004; Salmon et al., 2008) have suggested\nthat high levels of female competition, as well as perceived low levels of social support,\nmay increase dieting behavior, as both may be indications that the conditions for\nreproduction are not as good as they might be in future. Mealey (2000) took the RSH in a\nslightly different direction, arguing that modern anorexia is the consequence of intrasexual\ncompetition, a manipulative strategy in which dominant females suppress the reproduction\nof subordinate females (hijacking the existing mechanism for reproductive control). The\nmajority, over 95%, of eating disorders are found in women, which should not be\nsurprising from an evolutionary perspective as reproduction is more closely linked to body\nfat in women than in men.\nOther evolutionary minded approaches have included the AFFH, or adapted to flee\nfamine hypothesis (Guisinger, 2003), which suggests that anorexia's characteristic\nrestriction of food, denial of weight loss, and hyperactivity are evolved mechanisms that\nwould have aided nomadic foragers in leaving depleted environments. In this model,\ngenetic susceptibility is also raised as the reason some people are more likely to develop\nanorexia. Another recent study (Li, Smith, Griskevicius, Cason, and Bryan, 2009; cited\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nwith permission) looked at the relationship between intrasexual competition (in the form of\nexposure to high status and competitive same sex individuals) and unhealthy eating in\nheterosexual and homosexual individuals. They found exposure to cues of intrasexual\ncompetition resulted in unhealthy attitudes and body image in women but not men and that\nfor homosexuals, only the men were negatively influenced in terms of attitudes and body\nimage by such exposure. The lesbian participants were not impacted. This study\nemphasizes the role intrasexual competition may be playing in the development of eating\ndisorders, in particular cues of high status competitors.\nFaer, Hendriks, Abed, and Figueredo (2005) studied the relationship between eating\ndisorders and female intrasexual competitiveness, predicting that female intrasexual\ncompetitiveness for mates would be the strongest predictor of bulimia (BN), and that, in\ncontrast, female intrasexual competitiveness for status would be the strongest predictor of\nanorexia (AN). The resulting structural equations model demonstrated that intrasexual\ncompetitiveness for mates was the driving factor that ultimately contributed to female\ncompetitiveness for status, general competitiveness, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction,\ndrive for thinness, and both bulimia and anorexia. Contrary to initial expectations, the\nresults indicated a mostly spurious causal relationship between female competitiveness for\nstatus and anorexia, with the only indirect causal effect being through the influence of\nPerfectionism, which was uniquely on anorexia and not on bulimia. The role of perceived\npersonal and ideal partner mate value was also explored. Although strongly positively\nrelated to each other, perceived personal and ideal partner mate value had nearly equal and\nopposite effects on body dissatisfaction.\nAbed, Mehta, Figueredo, Aldridge, Balson, Meyer, and Palmer (2009) recently\nperformed a constructive replication in the United Kingdom, which included several\nmeasures of reproductive life history strategy. These measures permitted a close\nexamination of possible evolutionary sources of female intrasexual competitiveness. This\nhypothesis was derived from Life History Theory, which is a mid-level theory from\nevolutionary biology that describes the allocation of limited bioenergetic and material\nresources to the twin goals of survival and reproduction. According to this theory,\nresources are first partitioned into somatic effort, invested in the survival of the individual\norganism, and reproductive effort, invested in the production of offspring. Reproductive\neffort is further partitioned into mating effort, invested in the acquisition and retention of\nsexual partner, and parental effort, invested in the survival of existing offspring. A slow\nlife history strategy (K-selected) is one that emphasizes somatic and parental effort,\nwhereas a fast life history strategy (r-selected) is one that instead emphasizes reproductive\na slower life history strategy would be inconsistent (and a faster life history strategy would\nbe consistent) with the increased expenditure of mating effort entailed in heightened levels\nof female intrasexual competitiveness (Geary, 2005).\nAs in the original (Faer et al., 2005) study, the respondents completed the Female\nCompetitiveness for Mates Scale, the Female Competitiveness for Status Scale, the General\nCompetitiveness Scale, and the Eating Disorders Inventory. In addition, respondents also\ncompleted the Eating Disorders Examination. All of the measures of life history converged\nupon a single common Slow Life History factor, all of the measures of competitiveness\nconverged upon a single common Intrasexual Competitiveness factor, and both of the\noutcome measures converged upon a single Disordered Eating Behavior Factor. As\nDisordered Eating Behavior\npredicted by Life History Theory, the Slow Life History factor had a negative (inhibitory)\neffect upon the Intrasexual Competitiveness factor. The Intrasexual Competitiveness factor\npartially mediated the effect of the Slow Life History factor upon Disordered Eating\nBehavior, but Slow Life History had a negative direct effect on Disordered Eating\nBehavior, indicating that Slow Life History inhibits Disordered Eating Behavior by an\nunmeasured mechanism as well as by the suppression of intrasexually competitive behavior\nfor mates or for status.\nThe purpose of the present study is to identify one possible neuropsychological\nmechanism for this inhibitory effect. Executive functions include the abilities entailed in\nplanning for the future, inhibiting or delaying responding, initiating behavior, and shifting\nbetween activities flexibly. The ability to set goals, plan, sequence, prioritize, organize,\ninitiate, inhibit, pace, shift, monitor, control, and complete actions all involve executive\nfunctions (Lezak, Howieson, and Loring, 2004).\nWe therefore hypothesized that enhanced Executive Functions, and more\nspecifically Behavioral Regulation (Self-Control), would mediate the effects of Slow Life\nHistory Strategy on female intrasexually competitive behavior and on disordered eating\nbehavior. However, we were uncertain as to whether the enhanced Executive Functions\npossessed by slower life history strategists would serve to reduce disordered eating\nbehavior indirectly by inhibiting the heightened intrasexually competitive behavior for\nmates and for status that has been associated with it in previous research, or whether\nenhanced Executive Functions would directly inhibit disordered eating behaviors as well as\nintrasexually competitive behavior for mates and for status. Thus, based on the results of\nthe Abed, Mehta, Figueredo, Aldridge, Balson, Meyer, and Palmer (2009) study, we also\ntested the possibility that enhanced Executive Functions would also have a direct effect\nupon disordered eating behavior that was not mediated by inhibited intrasexually\ncompetitive behavior either for mates or for status.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants included one hundred female undergraduate students who received\ncourse credit in return for completing the questionnaires. Their mean age was 18.8 years\n(range 18-47). Ninety-five percent were heterosexual, while 92% were single, 6% living\ntogether, and 2% were married. Eighty-six percent came from middle or upper middle class\nbackgrounds, while 6% came from high income families and 9% came from lower income\nfamily backgrounds. In addition, the mean age at which they reached menarche was 12.6\nProcedures\nRespondents completed a packet of questionnaires consisting of the Arizona Life\nHistory Battery (ALHB), a modified version of the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), the\nBehavioral Regulation scales from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function\n(BRIEF-A), and two measures of Female Intrasexual Competitiveness: the Female\nIntrasexual Competitiveness for Status Scale and the Female Intrasexual Competitiveness\nfor Mates Scale.\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nMeasures\nThe Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB; Figueredo, 2007; Gladden, Figueredo, and\nJacobs, 2009) is a battery of cognitive and behavioral indicators of life history strategy\ncompiled and adapted from various original sources. These self-report psychometric\nindicators measure graded individual differences along various complementary facets of a\ncoherent and coordinated life history strategy, as specified by Life History Theory, and\nconverge upon a single multivariate latent construct. They are scored directionally to\nindicate a \"slow\" (K-selected) life history strategy on the \"fast-slow\" (r-K) continuum. The\nCronbach's alphas for these subscales were .63 for the Mini-K Short Form, .83 for Insight,\nPlanning, and Control, .76 for Mother/Father Relationship Quality, .88 for Family Social\nContact and Support, .85 for Friends Social Contact and Support, .90 for Secure Romantic\nPartner Attachment, .87 for General Altruism, and .96 for Religiosity.\nThe Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2; Garner, 1991) includes 11 subscales\nmeasuring several different aspects of disordered eating behavior, and was expanded to\ninclude a twelfth subscale with seven items specific to Anorexia (restriction of eating\nbehavior) taken from the Oral Control subscale of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)\ndeveloped by Garner and Garfinkel (1979), as had been done in a previous study (Faer et\nal., 2005). The Cronbach's alphas for these subscales were .92 for Drive for Thinness, .75\nfor Bulimia, .74 for Body Dissatisfaction, .91 for Ineffectiveness, .79 for Perfectionism, .81\nfor Interpersonal Distrust, .80 for Interoceptive Awareness, .82 for Maturity Fears, .61 for\nAsceticism, .77 for Impulse Regulation, .75 for Social Insecurity, and .60 for Anorexia.\nThe Female Intrasexual Competitiveness Scales (Faer et al., 2005) distinguished\nbetween intrasexual competitiveness for mates and intrasexual competitiveness for status.\nThese two scales each contained several third-person vignettes, which consisted of\nquestions in which participants read a situation and rated the behavior of the fictional\ncharacter named Mary. Both measures contained statements requiring participants to rate\ntheir level of endorsement on 7-point Likert scales of the behavior of the hypothetical\nprotagonist (\"Mary\") on how likely, how appropriate, and how understandable her behavior\nwas for each of the given scenarios. In the previous (Faer et al., 2005; Abed et al., 2009)\nstudies, only a single rating was taken on a 6-point Likert scale from \"Completely\nInappropriate\" to \"Completely Appropriate\", but the present study expanded upon that\nprocedure to enhance the density of measurement. The Cronbach's alphas for these scales\nwere .70 for Female Intrasexual Competitiveness for Mates and .69 for Female Intrasexual\nCompetitiveness for Status.\nThe Behavioral Regulation Scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive\nFunction - Adult version (BRIEF-A; Gioia, Isquith, Retzlaff, and Espy, 2002) were used to\nmeasure Executive Functions. This portion of the BRIEF-A is a 30-item self-report\ninstrument of adult executive functions or self-regulation in everyday environments that\nassess Inhibition (e.g., \"I tap my fingers or bounce my legs\"), Set Shifting (e.g., \"I have\ntrouble changing from one activity or task to another\") and Emotional control (e.g., \"I\noverreact emotionally\"). The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was .94.\nBalanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR-6; Paulhus, 1991) is a 40-item\nmeasure that includes two subscales commonly used to statistically control for socially\ndesirable responding: Self-deceptive Enhancement (e.g., \"I am fully in control of my own\nfate\") and Impression Management (e.g., \"I never swear\"). The Cronbach's alphas for the\ntwo scales were 0.54 for Self-deceptive Enhancement and 0.75 for Impression\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nManagement.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SAS 9.1. Because it\nwas not possible to analyze all of the individual subscales within a single multivariate\nmodel simultaneously due to the limitations of our sample size, a hierarchical analytical\nstrategy was employed. Unit-weighted common factor scores (Gorsuch, 1983) were\nestimated, using SAS PROC STANDARD and DATA, as the means of the standardized\nscores for all non-missing subscales on each factor (Figueredo, McKnight, McKnight, and\nAlso computed were both the Cronbach's alphas and the covariance matrices of the\nsubscales using SAS PROC CORR.

Structural equations models were evaluated by use of chi-square, the\nBentler-Bonett Normed Fit Index (NFI), the Bentler-Bonett Comparative Fit Index (CFI),\nand the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Index values of the NFI and\nCFI greater than 0.90 are considered satisfactory levels of practical goodness-of-fit (Bentler\nindications of good fit, values between 0.08 and 0.10 are considered indications of a\nmediocre fit, and values greater than 0.10 are considered indications of a poor fit (Steiger\nand Lind, 1980; Browne and Cudeck, 1993). The CFI was selected because it is adjusted\nfor model parsimony and performs well with moderate to small sample sizes (N < 250),\nespecially with Maximum Likelihood estimation (Bentler, 1990; Hu and Bentler, 1995).\nAlternative fit indices, such as the Bentler-Bonett Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), provide\nDisordered Eating Behavior\npoor estimates of model fit with smaller samples (Hu and Bentler, 1995).\nPrior to these structural analyses, all the variables were residualized on both Self-\nDeceptive Enhancement and Impression Management to statistically control for any\nsocially desirable responding.\nTable 2.

However, the absolute size of the sample must also be\nconsidered in terms of the relative complexity or parsimony of the model. Bentler (1995)\nhas recommended a ratio of at least five cases for every structural parameter freely\nestimated in confirmatory models. A sample size of N = 100 could therefore in principle\nsupport k = 20 parameter estimates according to this ratio. Both alternative models tested\nwith the present data, however, only contained 4 structural path coefficients to be\nestimated.\nBecause a structural equation model is ultimately no more than a system of cross-\nlinked multiple regressions, another approach to estimating the statistical power available\nfor a given sample size is to estimate the power available to test the significance of the\nmodel parameters that were omitted in the restricted structural models. In the case of the\npresent data, the most complex regression one could specify within a fully saturated model\nwould contain four predictors of disordered eating behaviors: Slow Life History, Executive\nFunctions, Competition for Mates, and Competition for Status. Using G*Power (Erdfelder,\nFaul, and Buchner, 1996), we estimated the post hoc statistical power to detect a\n\"moderate\" increment in the squared multiple correlation (f2 = 0.15) of a prediction\nequation using 100 cases, 4 predictors, and  = 0.05. The results were a non-centrality\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nconcluded that we indeed had sufficient statistical power to detect any additional effects of\n\"moderate\" magnitude (f2 = 0.15) that had not been specified in either of the alternative\nrestricted structural equation models. Thus, rather than estimate the power available to\nreject an entire alternative model, which we clearly had because we in fact rejected one of\nthem, we applied and we satisfied the more stringent criterion of whether we would have\nhad sufficient statistical power to detect any of the effects that were omitted in either or\nboth of our restricted structural models.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nGarner, Olmstead, and Polivy (1983) claim that the presence or absence of bulimia\ndifferentiates subtypes of anorexia. These two subtypes are termed \"restricters\" and \"binge-\nmeans are reported for each EDI subscale for \"anorexic\" females versus \"comparison\"\ngroup females (university students without a diagnosed ED). In comparing EDI subscale\nmeans from the EDI manual with EDI means from the present sample, the approximate\nlocation of the present sample on the eating disorder continuum can be examined. The\npresent sample scored lower than the clinical anorexic group on all subscales, except for\nbulimia, which was higher in our sample than for the clinical anorexic restricting sample\nand the college non-anorexic comparison group(AN diagnosed: M = 1.8, SD = 3.5,\ncomparison: M = 1.2, SD = 1.9, present sample: M = 2.2, SD = 0.7). The present sample\nhad lower mean scores than the clinical sample and higher mean scores than the\n\"comparison non-anorexic\" group on Ineffectiveness (AN diagnosed: M =11.4, SD = 8.4,\ncomparison: M = 2.3, SD = 3.6, present sample: M = 2.5, SD = 0.8), Interpersonal Distrust\n(AN diagnosed: M = 6.9, SD = 5.3, comparison: M = 2.0, SD = 3.1, present sample: M =\n2.6, SD = 0.7), and Maturity Fears (AN diagnosed: M = 4.8, SD= 5.1, comparison: M =\nA frequency analysis was also conducted to see how many women in the present\nsample exceeded the cut off for clinical screening purposes suggested by Garner. For the\npresent sample, no women exceeded a score of 14 on Drive for Thinness, or a score of 11\non Bulimia, or a score of 14 on Body Dissatisfaction.\nFrom a combination of these descriptive analyses, we may conclude the following.\nFirst, although some of our sample means were higher than the \"comparison\" group means,\noverall they were closer to the \"comparison\" group means than to the means of women\nwho had been specifically diagnosed as \"anorexic.\" This is reasonable because our sample\nwas composed of university students who had not been screened for either presence or\nabsence of anorexia. On the other hand, our sample did contain a small proportion of\nwomen who had scores on subscales that were greater than the means of the women\ndiagnosed with \"anorexia\", whether they were restricters or bulimics, in these previous\nstudies.\nStructural Equation Models\nIn both alternative structural models, we hypothesized that enhanced Executive\nFunctions, and more specifically Behavioral Regulation (Self-Control), would mediate the\neffects of Slow Life History Strategy on female intrasexually competitive behavior and on\nDisordered Eating Behavior\ndisordered eating behavior. However, in Alternative Model 1, the enhanced Executive\nFunctions possessed by slower life history strategists were hypothesized to reduce\ndisordered eating behavior indirectly by inhibiting the heightened intrasexually competitive\nbehavior for mates and for status. In Alternative Model 2, the enhanced Executive\nFunctions possessed by slower life history strategists were hypothesized to directly inhibit\ndisordered eating behaviors as well as to directly inhibit intrasexually competitive behavior\nfor mates and for status.\nAlternative Model 1 was rejectable by all statistical and practical indicators of\nare displayed graphically in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.

The relation between Intrasexual\nCompetitiveness (competitiveness for mates and competitiveness for status) and the\nDisordered Eating Behaviors, however, was completely spurious. This means that although\nExecutive Functions indeed served to inhibit both Intrasexual Competitiveness and\nDisordered Eating Behaviors, the inhibition of Disordered Eating Behaviors was not even\npartially mediated by Intrasexual Competitiveness, as it had been represented to be in\nprevious studies. The data were most consistent with Executive Functions serving as a\ncommon cause underlying the inhibition of both Disordered Eating Behaviors and\nIntrasexual Competitiveness.\nThese data patterns suggest that the function of a Slow Life History strategy in\nprotecting against Disordered Eating Behaviors resides in the higher degree of Behavioral\nRegulation exhibited by individuals with a Slow Life History Strategy. Enhanced\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nBehavioral Regulation, or self-control, is also protective against escalated levels of\nintrasexual competitiveness. Previous work, looking at both intrasexual competitiveness for\nmates and intrasexual competitiveness for status, has suggested that some women may be\nmore vulnerable to the pressures of intrasexual competition than others and indicated that\nthis increased vulnerability might pose a health hazard (Salmon et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009;\ncited with permission), whether or not it is directly causal to disordered eating behavior.\nFor example, subjects who rated low in susceptibility were less affected by the stressful\nscenarios in this study than subjects who rated high in susceptibility (Salmon et al., 2008).\nBecause some women were more vulnerable to cues of intrasexual competition, a clearer\nunderstanding of why they are more susceptible may point the way toward developing\nmore effective prevention and intervention methods for those at risk. Salmon et al.\nsuggested that the factors that might play a role in the development of susceptibility,\ndeserving of further examination, included rearing environment, sexual experience, and\nsocial support. It may be that, in addition to these, slow life history strategy, or more\nspecifically enhanced executive functioning, is another major factor influencing such\nsusceptibility to intrasexually competitive pressures.\nIn the past, there has been a great deal of emphasis in non-evolutionary explanations\nof eating disorders on the role of rearing environment in the development of disordered\neating behavior. In particular, the focus has been on the impact of mother-daughter\nrelationships on the development of eating disorders in young women (Ogden and Steward,\n2000). This relationship might facilitate the development of anorexic behavior if the\nmother's perceptions of female competition or other stressors is exacerbated (through the\nmedia or other sources) and then communicated, perhaps through overprotection, to a\ndaughter. In the absence of high executive function, this might result in a greater likelihood\nof developing eating disordered behavior. More research needs to be done in this area to\nclarify exactly how this relationship can contribute (in a positive or negative way) to the\nsusceptibility of young women to eating disorders.\nA majority of the sociocultural approaches to eating disorders have focused on the\ninternalization of a thin standard of beauty and the role the media plays in fostering this.\nAnd while body dissatisfaction is surely increased by heavy exposure to individuals with\nideal bodies such approaches fail to explain why eating disorders are not significantly more\nprevalent clinically than they appear to be. Current prevalence estimates of anorexia and\nbulimia among young females are 0.3% and 1% respectively with little change over the\npast twenty years (Hoek, 2006). Our theory, which suggests that executive function\n(specifically behavioral regulation) mediates the effects of slow life history strategy on\ndisordered eating behavior, accounts for such a pattern. High levels of executive\nfunctioning serve to buffer young women against the impact of intrasexual competition\nwhile at the same time slow life history tends to suppress the intrasexually competitive\nbehavior itself. The women who will be most at risk of developing an eating disorder will\nbe those who have lower executive function and who experience environments with more\nabundant cues of intrasexual competition.\nThus, our results are somewhat counterintuitive in the context of the common\nconception that eating disorders are pathologies of excessive self-control rather than the\nresult of deficient behavioral regulation. It might be that disordered eating behaviors\nrepresent extreme attempts to control tendencies towards overeating when the mechanisms\nof moderation used by normal individuals are perceived to be failing. This might be\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nanalogous to the plight of alcoholics. Most non-alcoholics are able to drink moderately and\navoid the pathological consequences associated with drinking to excess. In fact, many\nstudies have revealed that moderate intake of alcohol may instead have some salubrious\neffects. Alcoholics, on the other hand, are apparently unable to drink moderately and must\ninstead abstain altogether or risk losing control and drinking to excess.\nBy analogy, individuals with disordered eating behaviors might be unable to eat in\nmoderation due to insufficient competencies in behavioral regulation, as in the cyclical\nbinging of bulimics, who rely on purging afterwards to control their weight. Anorexics\ninstead restrict their food intake to unhealthy and even life-threatening levels, possibly as a\nparadoxical overreaction to tendencies towards overeating. These adverse health\nconsequences may be seen as unintended side-effects of these alternative weight-control\nstrategies in girls who perceive themselves to be under high degrees of competitive\npressure from other girls. Although the reproductive suppression hypothesis considers\namenorrhea and infertility as the ultimate function of anorexic behavior, the present results\nindicate that they might also represent unintended and fitness-reducing consequences of\ndisordered eating behavior. The present results indirectly associate disordered eating\nbehaviors with faster life history strategies, instead of the slower ones that might be\nexpected to correlate with adaptive reproductive suppression. The present results are\ntherefore inconsistent with the reproductive suppression hypothesis, because sacrificing\npresent reproduction in favor of potential future reproduction is a tactic more aligned with\nslow life history strategy (Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, and Schlomer, 2009).\nLimitations of the Study\nWe recognize that the major limitation of this study is the reliance on data collected\nfrom a non-clinical population with an average age of 18.8. The lack of clinically\ndiagnosed bulimics and anorexics probably accounted for the relatively small effect sizes\nfound in this study. Presumably, the effect sizes would be much larger with more severe\ncases than with a non-clinical population. In addition, childhood and adult onset eating\ndisorders cannot be examined in this study due to the restricted participant age range. We\nonly had the power to detect effects of moderate magnitude. Our findings, therefore, await\nreplication in future studies using clinical populations of anorexics and bulimics with a\nmore diverse age range.\nConclusion\nOur results indicate that a slow life-history strategy is indicative of greater\nexecutive function, which indicates enhanced self control and manifests as increased\nbehavioral regulation, serving as a protective factor against both escalated female\nintrasexual competitiveness and the development of disordered eating behaviors.\nReferences\nAbed, R.T., Mehta, S., Figueredo, A.J., Aldridge, S., Balson, H., Meyer, C., and Palmer, R.\n(2009).
