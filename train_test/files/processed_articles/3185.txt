Agents hold portfolios consisting of two distinct\ncurrencies. We study equilibria in which the two currencies are identical and equilibria in\nwhich the two currencies differ according to their relative purchasing power risk. We use\nnumerical methods to solve for the steady-state distributions of currency portfolios,\nnominal exchange rates and value functions. When one of the currencies is 'risky',\nequilibria exist in which the safe currency trades for multiple units of the risky currency\nwith the observed ratio being the nominal exchange rate. However, due to the decentralized\ntrading environment, we obtain a steady state distribution of nominal exchange rates. The\nmean and variance of the nominal exchange rate distribution are based on the fundamentals\nof the model and change in predictable ways when the fundamentals change.\nZusammenfassung\nWir entwickeln ein Modell mit zwei W\u00e4hrungen, um das Gleichgewicht beim Austausch\nder W\u00e4hrungen und die nominalen Wechselkurse zu bestimmen.

This phenomenon is often\ncalled ,,dollarization.\" Furthermore, there is active domestic currency exchange at well-\ndefined nominal exchange rates. At first glance, the existence of these two trading patterns\nmay not appear to be unusual but it actually creates a puzzle: if both currencies are\naccepted as media of exchange, then why are currencies exchanged? Currency exchange\nseems to be economically `wasteful' in such a situation. Consequently, it must be the case\nthat agents are heterogeneous in some dimension such that trading currencies is welfare\nimproving for each of them. Since the home currency is risky, a natural explanation for\nwhy agents trade currencies is that they are balancing the risk exposure of their currency\nportfolios. Agents holding large amounts of the risky home currency may be willing to give\nup multiple units in return for a unit of the safe foreign currency, while agents with large\namounts of safe currency are willing to increase their risk exposure by accepting the risky\ncurrency if the price is right. In this situation, the nominal exchange rate measures the\nrelative price of altering the risk exposure of one's currency portfolio. Our objective is to\ndevelop a model that has multiple media of exchange and active currency trading that\nallows us to examine how changes in domestic currency risk affect the behavior of the\neconomy and nominal exchange rates.\nIn this paper we present a model of decentralized exchange with two currencies circulating\nas media of exchange in order to study currency exchange. To do so, we use a monetary\nsearch model of indivisible money and divisible goods as in Trejos and Wright (1995) and\nShi (1995) but in which agents are allowed to hold portfolios of currencies as in Camera\nand Corbae (1999) and Green and Zhou (1998). We adopt a decentralized money search\nmodel to study the phenomenon described above because: i) money has a fundamental role\nas a medium of exchange, ii) agents are willing to accept and hold both currencies even\nthough one is `dominated in rate of return', iii) agents will have different trading histories\ndue to decentralized trading which causes some agents to have unbalanced currency\n* We would like to thank Gabriel Camera, Randy Wright, Rob Reed, Dean Corbae, Ed Green, John Duffy\nand participants at several seminars and conferences for their comments on our work. Some of the work\non this paper was completed while Ben Craig was a visiting scholar at the Bundesbank.\nportfolios, and iv) currency exchange will occur in equilibrium as agents rebalance their\nportfolios.\nIn our decentralized environment, agents are assumed to meet at random and trade\nbilaterally. They use currency to buy goods and services and/or the other currency. When\nagents meet and trade currencies, the nominal exchange rate is the ratio of the quantities of\ncurrencies exchanged. To provide agents with an incentive to engage in currency exchange,\nwe allow the two currencies to differ by their expected rates of return and purchasing\npower 'risk'- the dollar is assumed to be safe while holders of the domestic currency are\nsubject to random losses of purchasing power. As a result, agents face incentives to\ndiversify their currency portfolios to avoid the currency risk on the domestic currency.\nDue to the bilateral nature of trades in this economy, the law of one price does not hold\nsince prices are match specific. Hence, there is an equilibrium distribution of prices. The\nsame applies to nominal exchange rates \u00ad observed exchange rates are match specific and\nso we obtain an equilibrium distribution of nominal exchange rates. In short, the law of\none exchange rate also fails to hold. This latter result is consistent with the casual empirical\nobservation that exchange rates are not identical at a point in time across trading locations.\nWe thus are able to study how fundamental changes in currency risk affects: 1) the real\nexchange rate, 2) the mean nominal exchange rate, 3) the cross-sectional variance of the\nnominal exchange rate distribution, 4) the extent to which the dollar is used in goods\nexchange (dollarization), and 5) the volume of currency trading. However, due to the\ncomplexity of the model, we must resort to numerical methods to study the equilibrium\nbehavior of the economy and address these issues. Nevertheless, most of our numerical\nresults are very intuitive and consistent with what one would expect to happen when there\nis a change in the relative risk of the currencies.\nIn our benchmark model, currencies have the same risk and relative money supplies per\ncapita. In this case, the currencies are identical with respect to the payoffs received from\nholding them. Once we introduce currency risk on the domestic currency, we find that the\nvalue of the domestic currency as a medium of exchange falls \u00ad the risk acts as a 'tax' on\nthe domestic currency. Furthermore, agents now have an incentive to diversify their\nportfolios by trading multiple units of the risky currency for a unit of the safe currency if\nthe opportunity arises. At an appropriate exchange rate, sellers of the safe currency are\ncompensated for accepting the risky currency. The nominal exchange rate observed in\ndifferent matches depends on the relative portfolio positions of the currency traders who\nare paired together. Hence, we observe a distribution of nominal exchange rates. Not\nsurprisingly, we find that increasing the riskiness of the domestic currency leads to a\ndepreciation of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency (the mean of the\ndistribution shifts). More surprising is that the increase in currency risk can increase or\ndecrease the variance of the nominal exchange rate distribution \u00ad if the risk is initially low,\nan increase in currency risk will increase the variance of the distribution; if risk is high\ninitially, the opposite occurs. We also find that once the domestic currency risk is\nsufficiently large, 'dollarization' occurs as more and more traders use dollars to buy goods\nsince sellers are willing to produce more goods for dollars. Finally, by arbitrarily shutting\ndown currency exchange, we are able to see how the existence of a currency market affects\naverage welfare in the economy.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a brief review of the\nliterature on dual currency search models. In Sections 3 we describe the economic structure\nof the model and the bargaining environment and the definition of a stationary equilibrium.\nSection 4 contains a description of our numerical procedures. Section 5 contains the results\nof our numerical analysis. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our findings and suggestions for\nfuture research.\n2 Literature Review of Search Models\nThe search theoretic model of money has become the dominant framework for studying\nmonetary theory in the last few years. Until recently, a major drawback of the search\ntheoretic framework has been the underlying assumption that agents can only hold one unit\nof currency at a time. This inventory restriction on money is imposed for analytical\ntractability. More recent work by Molico (1996), Green and Zhou (1998), Camera and\nCorbae (1999) and Taber and Wallace (1999) has relaxed the inventory assumption and\nthese authors have studied monetary equilibrium when agents are allowed to hold multiple\nunits of currency. These models have been used to study equilibrium price distributions,\ndivisibility, and the welfare effects of changing the money stock.\nAll of the models listed above study economies in which only one currency circulates. In\norder to study nominal exchange rates, two or more currencies are needed. There are many\npapers in the search literature that look at dual currency issues.1 Kiyotaki and Wright\n(1993) look at the coexistence of two currencies in a one-country model and how differing\ndegrees of acceptability affect their relative values. Matsuyama, Kiyotaki and Matsui\n(1993) look at a two-country model with indivisible goods and money to study\ninternational currency equilibria. Trejos and Wright (1996a, 2000) extend the model to the\n1 See Craig and Waller (2000) for a brief survey of the search literature on dual currency economies.\ncase of divisible goods and look at implied real exchange rates. Currency exchange does\nnot occur in either model due to the one-unit inventory restrictions on money holdings. Li\nand Wright (1998) and Soller-Curtis and Waller (2000) examine how government polices\naffect the use of one currency over another and also its relative purchasing power.\nKocherlakota and Krueger (1999) study the more fundamental question of why it may be\nsocially optimal for more than one fiat currency to exist.\nIn none of the aforementioned models does currency exchange arise. Zhou (1997)\nintroduces tastes shocks into the Matsuyama, Kiyotaki and Matsui model to generate\ncurrency exchange but, due to the one-unit inventory restrictions on money holdings, the\nnominal exchange rate is arbitrarily fixed at 1:1. Waller and Curtis (2001) extend Trejos\nand Wright (2000) to show how currency restrictions can generate currency exchange but\nagain the nominal exchange rate is 1:1. Thus, the inventory constraint prevents us from\nstudying equilibrium determination of nominal exchange rates at values other than 1:1.\nHowever, relaxing the unit-inventory constraint requires the equilibrium determination of\nthe distribution of money holdings across agents, which is a complicated analytical\nproblem. Shi and Head (2000) circumvent this problem by modeling nations as a set of\nhouseholds each of which has a continuum of worker/shoppers. At the end of each period\nall money balances are pooled within the household and redistributed evenly to all\nshoppers in the household. This eliminates aggregate uncertainty and distribution issues.\nThey show that if new domestic currency transfers go to domestic households, then\ncurrency exchange can occur between shoppers from two countries in an attempt to re-\nbalance portfolios. The model we develop in this paper compliments the work of Shi and\nHead; whereas they look at a two-country model where aggregation generates a degenerate\ndistribution of money holdings, we construct a one-country model where the distribution of\nmoney holdings is determined endogenously and is not degenerate.\n3 The Search Environment\nOur model is a standard random matching monetary model with divisible, non-storable\ngoods in which goods prices are determined via bilateral bargaining. There is a continuum\nof agents uniformly distributed on the unit circle. Agents specialize in the production and\nconsumption of goods. An agent located at point i on the unit circle is assumed to produce\ngood i but consume goods in the interval (i, i + x]. For x < 1/2, double coincidences of\nwants cannot occur and thus barter trades do not arise. This restriction on x greatly\nsimplifies the model and will be maintained throughout the paper. Hence a trading\nequilibrium requires the existence of a medium of exchange. Given the matching process\ndescribed below, x is the probability that a buyer meets a seller who produces a good in the\nbuyer's desired consumption interval.\n3.1 Preferences and Costs of Production\nAgents are assumed to receive utility u(q) from consumption of q units of their desired\ngood and incur a utility loss of c(q) from producing q units of their good. Both u(q) and\nc(q) are continuous, twice differentiable with u' > 0, c' > 0, u''  0, and c''  0 with at least\none of the inequalities holding with strict inequality. Also assume that u(0) = c(0) = 0 with\nu'(0) > c'(0) and there is a positive value of q, q , such that u(q ) = c(q ). For the\nremainder of the paper we will assume that the cost function is linear and given by c(q) =\nq.\n3.2 Media of Exchange and Currency Portfolios\nIn our economy, two fiat currencies can circulate as media of exchange. Let currency f\ndenote the foreign currency (dollars) and currency h denote the home currency. One or\nboth of the currencies are allowed to circulate in trade. Following Camera and Corbae\n(1999) we assume that agents are able to hold up to N total units of currency at zero storage\ncost. These N units can be held in any combination of home and foreign currency and the\nsupport of N is given by the set N={0,1,2,...,N}. Consequently, agents are able to hold\nportfolios of currencies whose support is the simplex S1 = {ni\njt\nN: ni\nft\n+ ni\nht\n N} where\nni\njt\ndenotes the units of currency j = h,f held by individual i at time t. An individual's\nportfolio at time t is thus an ordered pair (ni\nft\n,ni\nht\n3.3 Aggregate Money Stocks\nLet mt\n(nf\n,nh\n) denote the proportion of the population holding currency portfolio (nf\n,nh\n) at\ntime t. The per-capita foreign money stock is then given by\n=\n-\n=\n=\nN\nn\nn\nN\nn\nh\nf\nt\nh\nf\nf\nf\nh\nn\nn\nm\nn\nM\n)\n,\n(\nwhile the per-capita home money stock is given by\n=\n-\n=\n=\nN\nn\nn\nN\nn\nh\nf\nt\nh\nh\nh\nf\nf\nn\nn\nm\nn\nM\n)\n,\n( .\nIn a stationary steady state, mt\n(nf\n,nh\n) = m(nf\n,nh\n) for all t, nf\nand nh\n.\n3.4 Government Behavior\nWe distinguish the two currencies by their respective purchasing power risk. Purchasing\npower risk is modeled as in Li (1995). We assume that there is an atomless government\nthat consumes goods but does not produce goods. Its main purpose is to confiscate and\nissue units of the domestic currency. Upon meeting a private agent, the government\nconfiscates all of their home currency holdings with probability 0  \u00b5  1. Thus,\nconfiscation corresponds to a random loss of purchasing power. We refer to this potential\nloss of purchasing power as currency risk. We interpret \u00b5 = 0 as corresponding to the case\nwhere the domestic currency's purchasing power risk is zero. We assume that the\ngovernment destroys the confiscated currency. In order to have a stationary equilibrium\nwith a positive stock of home currency in circulation, we need an inflow of the home\ncurrency to offset the outflow of currency arising through confiscation. We do this in the\nfollowing manner. If the government does not confiscate an agent's domestic currency, then\nwith probability 0    1, he makes a take-it-or-leave it offer of 1 unit of domestic\ncurrency for some quantity of goods to all agents holding N-1 units of currency or less.2 In\nequilibrium, these offers are accepted and so the government agent issues a new unit of\ncurrency. Obviously, if \u00b5 = 0, then  = 0 for a steady state to exist. While clearly stylistic,\nwe think this formulation captures the idea that for some reason \u00ad political, financial, or\narising from `bad' policy actions \u00ad the domestic currency in developing currencies is prone\nto sudden losses of purchasing power.\n3.5 Matching Process\nAgents meet at random according to a Poisson process with arrival rate . With probability\nx, a single coincidence of wants occurs and one of the agents becomes a seller and the other\na buyer. The buyer and seller may hold both currencies but trade requires that the buyer\nhold at least 1 unit of currency and that the seller hold less than N units of currency. When\na single coincidence of wants occurs there are two possible types of trades: 1) the buyer\ngives money (foreign, domestic, or some of both) to the seller for some amount of goods,\nand 2) the buyer gives the seller one currency and the seller gives the buyer goods and\nsome of the opposite currency. For example, a buyer could give the seller 3 units of\n2 Government agents are assumed to like all goods. We could have modeled the government agents as\nusing confiscated currency to buy goods rather than destroying it. However, this would have required us\nto solve for the distribution of portfolio holdings held by government agents in steady state. Therefore,\nmodeling the government's behavior as we have greatly simplifies the numerical routines.\nforeign currency and receive in return some goods and 1 unit of the domestic currency. We\nrefer to these latter types of trades as `making change' trades. We examine these types of\ntrades later in the paper.3\nWhen no coincidence of wants occurs, traders may still gain from trade via a pure financial\ntransaction. Since the domestic currency is 'risky', traders may decide to diversify their\nportfolios by trading currencies. For example, a trader with some dollars and no home\ncurrency may meet a trader with many units of home currency and no dollars. By swapping\ndollars for home currency, the home currency trader gets rid of some of the risky currency\nand acquires some units of the safe currency. If the dollar trader gets enough rubles per\ndollar, he will be willing to take on a greater risk position in order to increase his total\ncurrency holdings. The amount that they trade will determine the nominal exchange rate.\nIn general, the nominal exchange rate that occurs will be a function of the composition of\nthe traders' current portfolios and the underlying trading values of the current portfolios.\nAs a result, the nominal exchange rate occurring in these financial trades will vary across\nmatches.\nWhen a single coincidence of wants occurs, we assume that the buyer makes a take-it-or-\nleave-it offer to the seller. As a result, the buyer will offer a trade of goods for currency\nsuch that he extracts the entire trading surplus from the seller. The seller is indifferent\nbetween accepting and rejecting this offer and thus accepts the offer.4 The buyer's offer, d,\nis a pair of foreign and home currency transfers d = (df\n,dh\n) in return for goods. If df\ndh\n= 0, the buyer offers to pay with the foreign currency while the reverse is true if df\nand dh\n> 0. If both are greater than zero, than the buyer offers to pay the seller with a\nmixed bundle of foreign and home currency in return for goods. These are 'money for\ngoods' trades. If df\n< 0, the buyer offers df\nunits of foreign currency in return for\ngoods and dh\nunits of domestic currency. If the inequalities are reversed, the buyer offers\ndomestic currency units in return for goods and units of the foreign currencies. When df\n>\n< (>) 0, we call these 'making change' trades since in most of these trades the\nbuyer is giving the seller a valuable currency and receiving goods and some `change' back\nin the form of the less valuable currency. These types of trades help overcome the\n3 These types of trades can create belief equilibria in which one currency is viewed as more valuable than\nthe other for non-fundamental reasons. As a result currency trades will occur even though nothing\ndistinguishes the currency but their color.\n4 Since q is continuous, the buyer can offer to take an infinitesimally smaller amount of q to induce the\nseller to accept the offer.\nindivisibility of money and allow agents to trade smaller quantities of goods in a single\ncoincidence match. Finally, we assume that the government agent who decides to issue a\nunit of currency also makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the seller.\nWhen a single coincidence of wants does not occur a currency swap may be beneficial to\nboth parties. Thus, let )\n,\n,\n,\n( i\nh\ni\nf\nh\nf\nf\nn\nn\nn\nn\ny denote the quantity of the currency f acquired by\ncurrency trader with portfolio (nf\n,nh\n) from an arbitrary currency trader i holding portfolio\n)\n,\n( i\nh\ni\nf\nn\nn in return for giving up )\n,\n,\n,\n( i\nh\ni\nf\nh\nf\nh\nn\nn\nn\nn\ny units of currency h.

When a trade actually occurs, the buyer's offer extracts the full surplus\nfrom the seller such that the constraint in (4) is satisfied with equality. This is possible\nbecause q is a continuous variable. As pointed out by Camera and Corbae, in general, there\nwill be matches with a single coincidence of wants but no offer can be made which\nsatisfies (4). Since the value functions are concave in money holdings, a 'rich' seller\n(someone holding lots of currency) may not be willing to give up enough of the good for\nanother unit of currency from a 'poor' buyer (someone with little money). The high price of\nthe good makes the buyer willing to wait for a better deal than to trade now. Since the\nseller receives no surplus when a goods trade occurs, the second double summation term in\n(3) will be zero. As a result, the quantity traded only depends on the seller's currency\nholdings. Furthermore, the payoff from selling to the government agent for a unit of\ndomestic currency is also zero. When a trade does occur, the monetary price observed in\nthe match is difficult to calculate in more than one currency is exchanged for goods.

The discreteness\nof the currency units means that the first-order condition to this problem will not be\nsatisfied in general. In this case we choose the value that yields the highest surplus (which\ncan be zero). A problem with indivisible currencies is that there are possible currency\ntrades, which are beneficial to both sides but cannot be consummated due to the\ndiscreteness of the currencies. For example, trading 3 units of the risky currency for 2 units\nof the safe currency may not be enough compensation for the safe currency trader and a 2:1\ntrade may be too costly for the risky currency trader. It is possible that if they could trade\n1.84 units of the risky currency for a unit of safe currency, a Pareto improving currency\ntrade could occur. But if their portfolios are such that no combination of their currencies\nyields a ratio of 1.84, a trade does not occur. Consequently, in our model, some potentially\nPareto improving currency trades do not occur due to the indivisibility the currencies. As a\nresult, currency exchange is welfare improving in our model but incomplete.5\n3.9 The Distribution of Portfolios\nLet Ft\n(nf\n,nh\n) denote the probability at time t that an individual agent has a portfolio that is\nsmaller than or equal to (nf\n,nh\n). Thus, Ft\n(nf\n,nh\n) is given by\n= =\n=\nf\nn\na\nnh\nb\nt\nh\nf\nt\nb\na\nm\nn\nn\nF\n)\n,\n(\n)\n,\n(\nA stationary distribution of portfolios has Ft\n(nf\n,nh\n) = F(nf\n,nh\n) for all t, nf\nand nh\n.\nAt each point in time there are flows of agents into and out of each portfolio state. In\nsteady state, the flows of agents out of a particular portfolio state must be matched by an\ninflow of agents into that portfolio state. Writing down these flow equations for each\npossible portfolio state is complicated. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy to describe what\n5 The discreteness of the currencies could be overcome through the use of lotteries as in Berentsen,\nMolico and Wright (2000). Using lotteries, the traders could choose two possible currency trades that\nstraddle each trader's threat point and then choose a probability such that the expected nominal exchange\nrate satisfies both traders' incentive compatibility constraints. As a result, both traders expect to gain\nfrom the currency trade ex ante but ex post one of them would lose. On average however, welfare would\nincrease. With regards to the nominal exchange rate distribution, we would observe a wider range of\nexchange rates and increased variance in the nominal exchange rate distribution as a result of the\nlotteries. Due to the complexity of the computation algorithm needed to do this for all possible currency\ntrades, we do not pursue this modeling strategy. Consequently, while we will show that currency\nexchange raises average welfare, it should be remembered that our calculations underestimate the true\nvalue of currency exchange to society since our currency market is incomplete.\nhappens regarding matches at time t. For a given portfolio state (nf\n,nh\n), agents with this\nportfolio who are either buyers, sellers or currency traders move out. The inflows into this\nstate are buyers from larger portfolio states, sellers from smaller portfolio states, and\ncurrency traders. In steady state, the inflows must equal the outflows of agents for each\nportfolio state.\nAgents may meet another private agent or the government. In meetings with private\nagents, there is either a single coincidence of wants or no-coincidence of wants. Each\nsingle coincidence match involves a trade of money for goods and a flow into a new\ncurrency holding state and a flow out of the old currency state for both seller and buyer.\nFor a transaction that involves the buyer paying )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nf\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd and )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nh\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd to\nuse the notation above, the proportions )\n,\n(\nh\nh\nf\nf\nd\nn\nd\nn\nm -\n- and )\n,\n(\nh\ns\nh\nf\ns\nf\nd\nn\nd\nn\nm +\n+ both\nincrease by the amount ),\n,\n(\n)\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nn\nn\nm\nn\nn\nm because of the new currency holdings.

Matches without\na single coincidence of wants do not cause a change in portfolio positions unless there is a\ncurrency trade. When currency exchange occurs, the traders portfolio state changes and so\nthe flow equations for each portfolio position must account for these pure currency trades.\nA steady-state equilibrium is achieved when the flows out of a given currency state are\nequal to the flows into it.\nMeeting the government either involves no action, an outflow of currency or an inflow of\ncurrency. With regards to the inflows and outflows of the domestic currency, the\ngovernment meets an agent at state (nf\n,nh\n) with probability  and confiscates nh\nunits of\ntheir domestic currency holdings with probability \u00b5.

Thus we have\n)\nSince N\nis determined by the probability flow conditions, this extra equation requires that\none of the three parameters, \u00b5,  and Mh\nmust be determined endogenously. Under the\nbuyer-take-all bargaining assumption, the parameters  and Mh\ndo not appear in the value\nfunctions so for computational ease we let one of these two parameters vary in our\nnumerical model while we fix \u00b5. We fix Mh\nand let  be determined endogenously in order\nto keep per capita money stocks constant.\nWe can define a stationary equilibrium as a set of functions V (nf\n,nh\n), )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nn\nn\nn\nn\nq ,\n)\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nf\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd , )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nh\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd , )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nf\nn\nn\nn\nn\ny , )\n,\n,\n,\n( s\nh\ns\nf\nh\nf\nh\nn\nn\nn\nn\ny , F(nf\n,nh\n) such\nthat (1)-(8) are satisfied.\nIn general it is not possible to solve this model analytically. Consequently, in order to study\nthe steady state properties of this model we must resort to numerical methods.\n4 Numerical Methods\nOur numerical strategy is as follows:\n1. Starting from an arbitrary initial distribution and set of value functions, find a steady-\nstate equilibrium for a given set of parameter values when the currency risk is zero.\n2. Using the steady-state values under identical currencies as the initial values, increase the\namount of domestic currency risk from zero. Find the new steady-state equilibrium\nvalues.\n3. Repeat.\nMore formally, numerical solution of the system of equations follows a classic fixed-point\nprocedure. With assumed initial value functions, V0\n, currency exchange functions, df0\nand\n, and probability distributions, M0\n), we recursively calculate the economy\nwhere:\n= argMax(for the buyer){Feasible Bargain Conditions (Vt\n,Mt\n)}\n= Implied new Probability Distribution (d1,t+1\n,Mt\n)\n= Value from the Search Conditions (df,t+1\n)\nand where convergence is achieved if the maximum difference between df,t+1\n,\n, and df,t\ndh,t\n, Mt\n, Vt\nis under a specified tolerance. (In general the results did not differ\nfor a wide range of tolerances.) The search conditions were rewritten in the numerical\nwork to ensure a contraction mapping was as likely as possible. Under most initial\nconditions that we tried, the routine converged. In addition, we took the maximum\noperation globally for the bargaining conditions over all feasible bargains, which is allowed\nby the discrete number of currency units. Thus, we did not need to strongly specify local\nconditions in order to achieve an optimum.\nWith regards to the initial conditions, our default is a uniform probability distribution over\nmoney holdings and value functions, which are skewed such that the risky currency is more\nvaluable than the safe currency. This is done to ensure that the numerical results were not\ndriven by the choice of initial value functions. When conducting our steady-state\ncomparative static analysis, we use the previous equilibrium as the initial condition to try\nand ensure that our new equilibrium lies in the neighborhood of the previous equilibrium.\nSince we cannot solve the model analytically, we do not have a benchmark solution to\ncompare our numerical results to. However, for \u00b5=0, the two currencies are identical, hence\nwe can choose parameter values that yield the Camera-Corbae (1999) solution where\nbuyers only spend one unit of currency when trading. Consequently, we choose parameter\nvalues that yield the equilibrium transaction pattern (df\n= 0) or (df\n= 1) as our\ninitial steady-state equilibrium.\nIt should be noted that this equilibrium transaction pattern does not allow for making\nchange trades, which can exist here even if both currencies are identical except for color.\nAiyagari, Wallace and Wright (1996) show that equilibria exist such that one currency is\nbelieved to be more valuable even though the two currencies are fundamentally identical.\nIn these equilibria, making change trades are optimal in single coincidence matches. In\norder to see how this type of belief equilibrium affects our results, we conduct two\nnumerical experiments in the large portfolio economy considered below. We first study the\nmodel without making change trades to see how `fundamentals' affect the behavior of the\neconomy. We then allow making change trades to occur and compare them to the `no\nmaking change' equilibrium. Although the initial trading patterns are very different, we\nshow that the steady state comparative static results are qualitatively the same across both\neconomies.\n5 Numerical Results\n5.1 \"Small\" Portfolios\nIn this section we explore the behavior of equilibria when N =2 and both currencies are\nfully acceptable in trade. Furthermore, no making change trades are allowed. This is the\neasiest example to study and it provides some basic insight for N>2.6 In these simulations,\nwe examine equilibria in which there is no currency risk on either currency and we only\nconsider trades in which currency trades for goods. We then introduce currency risk to see\nhow the equilibrium is affected. No currency exchange occurs in this case since 2:1 is the\nonly currency exchange possible and thus exchange cannot make both parties better off.\nThis is because a currency trade would merely involve trading places so there cannot be\nmutual gains from exchange. While helpful in understanding how the model works, this\ncase is not interesting in terms of our ultimate pursuit, which is generating equilibrium\ncurrency exchange. As a benchmark, we initially set the currency risk to zero on the\ndomestic currency, which requires setting \u00b5==0.7\nLetting u(q) = q , Table 1a below shows the equilibrium solutions for the value functions, the\nportfolio distribution and the quantities traded for the N=2 economy for four different values of the\nconfiscation probability \u00b5.\n6 Camera, Craig and Waller (2001) provide analytical conditions for existence and uniqueness of this\nequilibrium and determine when (df\n=0) or (df\n=1) is the optimal strategy.\n7 While this benchmark is intuitively appealing as a starting point, it is characterized by a fundamental\nindeterminacy \u00ad there are an infinite number of portfolio distributions that support the same equilibrium\nvalue functions when the currencies are identical. The source of this problem is that buyers holding both\ncurrencies are indifferent as to which currency they use to buy goods. Thus, there are an infinite number\nof mixed strategies that can be used to make this decision. While this has no effect on the equilibrium\nvalue functions or quantities traded, the mixed strategy adopted fundamentally affects the flows of agents\ninto different portfolio states.\nSmall Economy with Differing Risk of Domestic Currency\nConfiscation\nParameter Values: N=2, M1\nf\nq\nf\nq\nf\nq\nh\nq\nh\nq\nh\nq\nwhere j\nik\nq is the quantity produced by a seller with portfolio (i,k) for currency j.8\nFrom Table 1a we see that the law of one price does not hold in this decentralized\nenvironment. This is the key result in Camera and Corbae (1999). Since the marginal value\nof an addition unit of money is falling, `rich' sellers, i.e., those at (1f\n), will not\nproduce as much as `poor' sellers, those at (0,0). Thus, we get price dispersion in\nequilibrium. What is new is that we now have price dispersion across currencies as well\n8 The distribution in the first column of Table 1a was obtained by having the buyers at portfolio state\n) spend the dollar on sellers with probability .5. This is the reason for the symmetry of the\ndistribution.\nwhen currency risk is not zero. For the rich sellers, we see that as the risk on the domestic\ncurrency increases, sellers holding a unit of home currency will give up far more to acquire\na dollar (nearly 40% more) than sellers already holding a dollar (only 6% more). What is\nalso interesting is that as risk increases, the simple variance of the dollar price of goods\nacross matches falls while the variance of the home currency price of goods across matches\nrises. Thus, currency risk alters the relative amounts of price dispersion across currencies.\nIt is important to note that as shown by Camera and Corbae, as search frictions (r/x) go to\nzero, price dispersion goes to zero, for a particular currency. The same will be true here,\nexcept that when \u00b5>0 there will still be price differences across currencies.\nLooking at the value functions we see that, not surprisingly, as the home currency's risk\nrises, the value of holding dollar-weighted portfolios increases and the value of holding\nhome currency denominated portfolios falls dramatically \u00ad a five fold increase in the\nprobability of loss reduces the value of the (0,2h\n) portfolio to less than 1/5 of its initial\nvalue. Since the dollar buys more goods, the value of holding a dollar portfolio rises while\nthe value of a home currency portfolio falls.\nWith regards to the portfolio distribution, we see that the biggest change in the distribution\noccurs in the marginal distribution of agents at with 2-unit portfolios. The increasing risk\non the domestic currency is associated with fewer diversified portfolios and more\nundiversified portfolios. Finally, as the risk on the home currency increases, the quantity of\ngoods given up for a unit of home currency also falls across all sellers. Increasing the risk\non the domestic currency reduces sellers' willingness to accept it in trade at a given\nmonetary price. Thus to induce sellers to accept it, buyers ask them to produce a lower\nquantity of goods.\nTable 1b reports the economic data for these economies:\nCharacteristics of a Small Economy with Differing Currency Risk\nEconomic Data for N= 2, Risky Economy\nPercentage of goods trades involving:\nFrom Table 1b we see several interesting results. First, although with x = .45, 90% of all\nmatches have a single coincidence of wants, roughly 35% of those matches actually lead to\nan exchange of goods. The reason is that in many of those matches, the buyer has no\nmoney or the seller is unable to produce because the inventory constraint on money\nholdings binds. Second, `dollarization' occurs as the domestic currency risk rises.\nDollarization rises for two reasons: 1) agents resort to using dollars when buying goods\nrather than home currency, 2) more matches occur between buyers with dollars and sellers\nwith no money. By examining the transaction patterns associated with each economy we\nfound that in the first column, the buyer at (1f\n) uses domestic currency to buy from\n, 0). He uses the dollar to buy from sellers at (0,1h\n), i.e., those\nalready holding a unit of the domestic currency. In column two, the spending behavior of\n) buyer is exactly the same as column one, so any changes in dollarization are due\nto changes in the probabilities of matches occurring. However, in column three, the\n) buyer stops spending the home currency on the (0,1h\n) seller and switches to dollars\ninstead. Finally, in column four, the (1f\n) buyer is using dollars in trade with all three\nsellers. Thus, the change in the transaction pattern of the (1f\n) buyer in columns three and\nfour are responsible for the large increases in dollarization that are observed.9\nNot surprisingly, average welfare is falling steadily as risk on the domestic currency\nincreases and the value functions associated with holding home currency declines. Average\nproduction falls initially and then rises but this simply is due to the fact that there are more\nhome currency trades occurring with sellers at (0,0) who in turn are willing to produce the\nlargest quantity of goods for a unit of currency. Thus, although the model cannot be solved\nanalytically, the results above are appealing in the sense that they are consistent with what\nwe believe will happen (and observe happening) if there is a dramatic change in the relative\nreturns and relative risk of the two currencies.\nWhile the N=2 economy is very useful for understanding the basic mechanics of our\neconomy, it does not allow currency exchange to occur. Consequently, we do not have\nnominal exchange rates nor can we look at the welfare gains from having a currency\nmarket. To examine these issues we need to examine larger portfolio economies.\n9 Camera, Craig and Waller (2001) show that this transaction pattern arises because the net surplus from\ntrade u(q)-c(q) is not monotonically increasing in q. If it were monotonically increasing, then the (1,1)\nbuyer would always spend the dollar on all sellers when \u00b5>0. Note also that the average of the\nproduction reported in Table 1a is considerably higher than expected production in Table 1b because the\nreported matches in the first table are the high production matches. Most matches result in small or no\nproduction.\n5.2 'Large' Portfolios\nWe now set N=10 and see how currency risk affects the economy and to study currency\nexchange. Since we cannot solve the model analytically, we do not have a benchmark\nmodel to guide us as to what parameter values we should start with for simulations. As\nbefore, we choose our parameter values such that we get the equilibrium transaction pattern\n(df\n=0) or (df\n=1) as our initial steady-state equilibrium. However, we do not\nimpose this transaction pattern in our numerical routine. We merely choose appropriate\nparameters and let the model run to see if that transaction pattern is generated in\nequilibrium. The Camera Corbae equilibrium was the only one we found for those\nparameter values when \u00b5=0. Furthermore, in this section, we prevent making change trades\nfrom happening.\nFigure 1: Value Functions for a Medium Sized Economy,\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nFigure 1 contains the value functions for four differnet values of \u00b5. The value functions are\nconcave in money holdings and in the case of \u00b5 = 0, the value functions are symmetric\nacross portfolio size. As the risk on the domestic currency increases, the value of holding a\nportfolio with home currency falls while holding a dollar weighted portfolio rises. Thus,\nthe pattern observed in the N=2 economy prevails here as well. The concavity of the value\nfunctions also means that the quantities given up by `rich' sellers will be less than for\n`poor' sellers just as in the N=2 case. Consequently, we have equilibrium price dispersion\nwithin a currency and across currencies.\nThe economic data for these parameterizations of the economy are contained in Table 2:\nMedium Economy with Differing Currency Risk\nEconomic Data for N = 10, Risky Economies\nPercentage of goods trades involving:\n(Units of home currency per dollar)Table 2\nOther than the use of dollars in exchange, the data show a similar pattern as in the N=2\ncase. Dollarization again increases with an increase in domestic currency use as agents\nswitch to using dollars when a trading opportunity arises. An increase in the domestic\ncurrency risk again leads to a reduction in welfare and production. It also leads to a\ndecline in the dollar price of goods, a rise in the home currency price of goods and an\nincrease in the implied real exchange rate. Finally, it should be pointed out the percentage\nof dollars only trades and home currency only trades does not add up to 100% in the last\ncolumn since there are a small number of trades in which the buyer gives up some of both\ncurrencies in exchange for goods.\nInspection of the buyers' spending patterns (contained in the appendix) with sellers\n,0) shows that when \u00b5 = 0, agents only spend one\nunit of currency in all matches with sellers. However, as risk increases, buyers holding\nhome currency weighted portfolios begin dumping home currency on poor sellers and they\nalso begin to spend more than one unit of the home currency. The largest number of home\ncurrency units spent in these simulations is 3. Buyers tend to dump rubles on rich sellers\nholding lots of dollars. However, buyers with dollar-weighted portfolios begin spending\ndollars on poor sellers since they get much more for a dollar compared to a unit of home\ncurrency and because the marginal value of that dollar is smaller to them. The (0,7h\n)\nsellers conduct most of their trades in dollars since they are willing to give up a large\nquantity of goods to get a dollar rather than another unit of home currency. Sellers with\nlots of dollars, those at (7f\n,0), are mainly paid in units of the home currency since the\nrelative price that they offer for a unit of home currency is much better than that offered by\n) sellers.\nThe price distribution across sellers based on receiving one dollar is given in Figure 2:\nFigure 2: Price Distributions for Purchases by One Unit of Riskless Foreign\nCurrency\ndf\nWe can see that when there is no home currency risk, the price charged by sellers is\nincreasing in portfolio size and symmetric across portfolios of a given size. Once risk\nbegins to increase, the price charged by sellers holding units of domestic currency begins to\nfall with sellers holding very risky portfolios, (0,9h\n), giving the best price among the richest\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: df =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: df =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: df =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: df =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nsellers for acquiring a unit of the safe currency. By flatting out the price distribution,\ndomestic currency risk reduces the amount of dollar price dispersion.\nFigure 3 below shows the price distribution across sellers when buyers spend one unit of\nthe risky domestic currency.\nFigure 3: Price Distributions for Purchases by One Unit of Risky Domestic Currency\ndh\nIt is clear that as the domestic currency risk increases, the price of goods increases across\nall sellers. Rich sellers holding a large amount of domestic currency units offer the worst\nprice since they already are saddled with a large amount of risky currency. Rich sellers\nholding lots of dollars offer the best prices for a unit of domestic currency since their\ncurrency portfolios have relatively little risk exposure.10 Unlike the dollar price\ndistribution, increasing domestic currency risk does not flatten the home currency price\ndistribution but instead increases the degree of price dispersion.\n10 The jaggedness at the top of the distribution in the last two figures is the result of approximation error\nand rounding off.\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: dh =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: dh =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: dh =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nPrice Distributions: dh =1, \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nIn this economy, we now have currency exchange occurring between agents. The nominal\nexchange rate data corresponding to Table 2 are:\nCurrency Market Exchange Rates for a Medium Economy\nNominal\nExchange Rate\nConditional\nProbability\nSize of Currency\nMarket\nThe conditional probability gives the percentage of all currency trades that occur at a\ngiven nominal exchange rate.11\nThere are several interesting results from Table 3. First, we see that there are several\nobserved nominal exchange rates in each economy, ranging from 3 observed exchange\nrates when the risk is relatively low and up to 6 observed exchange rates when the\ncurrency risk is relatively high. As it did with equilibrium quantities traded, the\ndecentralized nature of the trading environment generates an equilibrium distribution of\nnominal exchange rates rather than a single exchange rate. Thus decentralization not only\nbreaks down the law of one price, it also breaks down the law of one nominal exchange\n11 If a cell shows 0.000 it means some matches produced currency exchange at this exchange rate but these\nmatches occurred with probabilities near zero. A blank cell denotes no observed trades at the\ncorresponding exchange rate.\nrate. Second, despite the number of different exchange rates observed in economies 1 and\n2, the overwhelming majority of currency trades occur at one or two exchange rates. Thus\nfor the first two economies, we see that a little over 95% of all currency trades occur at\ntwo exchange rates. However, this is not true for economy 3; a considerable mass of\ntrades occurs at multiple exchange rates.\nFrom these comparative static results we find not surprisingly, that the home currency\ndepreciates against the dollar as its currency risk increases (the mean of the distribution\nshifts). More interestingly, the cross-sectional variance of the nominal exchange rate also\nincreases as the currency risk on the home currency increases. Hence, greater currency risk\nis not only associated with a lower exchange value of the domestic currency but also\ngreater instability in the exchange value of the domestic currency. This pattern was found\nfor every simulation that we have done. The only time we have observed a decrease in the\nvariance is when the home currency becomes so risky that the required nominal exchange\nrate to induce currency exchange starts bumping up against the maximum possible\nexchange rate (N:1). Once this happens, the variance of the nominal exchange rate\ndistribution starts to decline. With regards to the variance of the exchange rate\ndistribution, it should be noted that the exchange rate distribution is driven by the price\ndistribution. Thus as search frictions go to zero, the price distribution for a given currency\ncollapses to a single price. This implies that the nominal exchange rate distribution would\nalso collapse to a single exchange rate. Therefore, the degree of dispersion in the observed\nnominal exchange rates is a function of how severe the search frictions are \u00ad when trading\nis easy, nominal exchange rates will have a small variance and when trading is difficult,\nthe variance in observed exchange rates will be larger.\nThe size of the currency 'market' shows the percentage of all meetings that end in currency\nexchange. For the economies above, this number is very small and has its maximum\nvalue around 2.25%. This is not surprising since pure currency trades can only occur when\na single coincidence match does not occur and with x = .45; this means 90% of all\nmeetings have a single coincidence of wants. As a result, only 10% of all meetings result\nin no coincidence of wants. Therefore, when the size of the currency market is 1% this\nmeans that 10% of all feasible currency trade meetings result in currency exchange. It is\ninteresting to note that as the currency risk on the ruble increases, the size of the currency\nmarket increases but then declines. This is not too surprising; as risk increases from a low\nlevel, there are incentives to exchange currencies to reallocate risk. However, once risk\nbecomes too large, it becomes harder to induce agents to accept the risky currency even at\nrelatively high nominal exchange rates. As a result, the volume of currency trading falls.\nCurrency exchange is quite small in economy 1 and the range of observed exchange rates\nis small. This is due to the upper bound on money holdings and the indivisibility of\ncurrency. With N=10, the lowest possible exchange rate that can be observed is 9:8 or\n1.125.12 So we can see that in economy 1, we are bumping up against this constraint. If\nwe relaxed the upper bound on money holdings or allowed divisibility of currency, we\nwould observe exchange rates below 1.125 in economy 1 and a larger currency market.\n5.2.2 Changes in Search Frictions\nIn this section we examine how changes in the probability of a single coincidence match\naffects the equilibrium behavior of the economy. In Table 4 below, we vary the probability\nof a single coincidence match starting from the high-risk economy, \u00b5=.1, in Table 2\nabove:\nMedium Economy with Differing Search Frictions\nParameter Values: N=10, Mf\n=Mh\nPercentage of goods trades involving:\n(Units of home currency per dollar)\nThe first column of Table 4 is the last column of Table 2. We see that as matching becomes\nmore difficult, agents increasingly use the 'safe' currency as the main medium of exchange.\nThis is because as matching becomes difficult, agents want to get as much consumption as\npossible when the opportunity arises and so they start using the more valuable currency. As\na result, this alone causes a depreciation of the home currency against the dollar in terms of\nrelative purchasing power. From Table 4 we also see that after an intial increase in the\n12 This is because no trade at 10:9 will occur because one trader would have to hold more than 10 units or\nthe traders would simply be trading places and this would not satisfy the incentive compatibility\nconstraints on exchange.\ncurrency market size due to a greater opportunity for currency trade to occur, the\npercentage of currency trades actually falls when matching becomes extremely difficult.\nThis is largely due to the greater unwillingness to give up dollars in return for the home\ncurrency. Not surprisingly, average production and welfare also decrease.\nIn this section we allow agents to engage in making change trades. If the foreign currency\nis more valuable than the home currency, then buyers holding dollars may prefer to receive\na smaller quantity of goods if they also receive some units of the domestic currency as\n`change'. This arises because of the indivisibility of money; if buyers have to spend the\nentire dollar they get more than they actually want. Consequently, they would like to spend\na fraction of a dollar but it is not possible. Thus, receiving some units of the weak currency\nfrom the seller lowers the amount of goods they need to acquire for giving up a dollar. At\nthe same time, these types of trades allow agents constrained by the inventory constraint to\nproduce since they can acquire a dollar by producing goods and giving a unit of the home\ncurrency as change, thereby maintaining the size of their currency portfolio. While these\ntypes of trades are clearly beneficial, they create the possibility that one currency is viewed\nas being more valuable even though there is nothing fundamentally different about the two\ncurrencies. This was demonstrated by Aiyagari, Wallace and Wright (1996). If such a belief\nequilibrium exists, then agents will engage in making change trades and direct currency\ntrades in order to alter their currency holdings. Consequently, when currency risk does exist\non one currency it is difficult to disentangle how much of the differences in values is due to\ndifferences in beliefs versus differences in fundamentals. In order to control for this, we\nfirst examine the N=10 economy with making change trades and no currency risk. We then\nintroduce currency risk and do steady state comparative static analysis.\nFigure 4 and Table 5 compares the results for the N=10 economies when making change\ntrades are prevented and then allowed. In both economies there is no currency risk and the\nparameter values are exactly the same.\nValue Functions with and without \"Making Change\" in Goods Trades\nIn Figure 4, we see that the value of holding dollars is greater than the value of holding the\nsame size portfolio with domestic currency. Comparing the two value function graphs\nshows that the value of dollar portfolios increase substantially and the value of home\ncurrency increases slightly in the making change equilibrium. Thus, even though there is\nnothing fundamentally different about the two currencies, if agents believe that the dollar is\nmore valuable, that belief can be supported in equilibrium.13\nTable 5 compares the basic economic data across the two economies.\n13 The figure shows an assymetry due to alowing the participants to make change. As is well known, these\nequilibria choose one currency or the other to be the lower valued change, and thus the outcomes are not\nsymetric.\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions No MC \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nHome\nForeign\nValue Functions MC \u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nMedium Economy with and without \"Making Change\" in Goods Trades\nEconomic Data for N= 10, No Currency Risk Economies (\u00b5 = 0)\nNo Change Trades Allowed Change Trades Allowed\nPercentage of goods trades involving:\nTable 5 reveals several interesting results. First, more goods trades occur in the making\nchange equilibrium than the no change equilibrium. This is not surprising since more\npossible trades can be achieved. Furthermore, the fraction of dollar only trades falls\ndramatically while the number of goods trades involving any exchange of the home\ncurrency soars to 90%. This is result of all agents being able to be sellers in this economy\nregardless of whether the inventory constraint is binding. Agents holding 10 units of money\ncan engage in trades that alter the composition of their currency holdings without\nincreasing its size. quantity and gets change back from the dollar in the form of a unit of\nhome currency.\nAverage welfare goes up when change trades are allowed. This is because more trades are\noccurring hence consumption is occurring more frequently per period of time. Furthermore,\nsince some buyers are able to obtain quantities that are closer to their most desired amount,\ntheir welfare goes up. It is interesting that welfare rises despite the fact that average\nproduction falls. Production falls because some buyers are now engaging in smaller trades\nthan before. This occurs for two reasons. First, many of the trades in the no change\nequilibrium involve buyers buying quantities that are `too large' because of the\nindivisibility of money. Thus, rather than buying a dollar's worth of goods and receiving no\nchange, a buyer now spends a dollar, receives a smaller and more desirable. Second, the\nrichest sellers are now trading small quantities in making change trades, which lowers the\naverage amount of production in the economy. Finally, a direct currency market exists now\nwhere agents can engage in pure currency trades when no coincidence of wants occurs.\nThis currency trade is simply exploiting differences in the marginal valuations of the\nportfolios as opposed to altering the risk exposure of one's portfolio. In this example, only\n1 nominal exchange rate is observed which is 2 units of home for one dollar.\nFinally, an analysis of specific transaction patterns for particular buyers and sellers reveals\na very different transaction pattern. The transaction patterns for a (10f\n) buyer with all\nsellers are shown in Table 6 across the two economies. When change trades are not\npermitted, the parameterization yields the Camera-Corbae equilibrium in which (df\n,dh\n) =\n(1,0) or (0,1).). The letter f in each cell means that this buyer spends one dollar on any\nseller he meets (in this case agents holding 10 units of currency cannot sell). However,\nonce making change trades are allowed, the transaction pattern for this buyer changes\ndramatically.\nTransaction Patterns for a Foreign Currency Rich Buyer\n(10f, 0h) Buyer with all Sellers\nNo Making Change\nForeign denotes foreign currency holdings of a seller\nHome denotes home currency holdings of a seller\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n0 f f f f f f f f f f ---\n1 f f f f f f f f f ---\n2 f f f f f f f f ---\n3 f f f f f f f ---\n4 f f f f f f ---\nForeign 5 f f f f f ---\n(dollars) 6 f f f f ---\n7 f f f ---\nMaking Change\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nFor example, now this buyer spends two dollars on a (0,0) seller but one dollar on a (8f\nseller. More interestingly, this buyer engages in making change trades with nearly every\nother seller he meets. In some trades he gives up two dollars in order to receive goods plus\na unit of the home currency (2f, -h) while in some others he gives up two dollars for goods\nand two units of home (2f, -2h) or 3dollars for goods and 3 units of home currency (3f,-\n3h). Thus, trading bundles of money and goods is the preferred trading strategy overall for\nthis buyer. The problem with these trades of course is determining what the `price' of the\ngood is since two different currencies are involved in most trades. Thus, it is difficult to\nthink about price dispersion in this environment.\nTable 7 shows how increasing currency risk on the home currency affects the performance\nof the making change economy.\nMedium ,,Making Change\" Economy with Differing Currency Risk\nEconomic Data for N= 10, Risky Economies\nPercentage of goods trades involving:\nCompared to the `no change trades' economy, for the most, the qualitative behavior is the\nsame, although the quantitative changes are quite different. The percentage of trades that\ninvolve dollars only falls initially and then rises as before. The percentage of trades\ninvolving both currencies rises initially and then falls. This is because as risk increases,\nagents want to diversify portfolios via making change trades. However, once the risk gets\nsufficiently high, agents resort to the use of a single currency in goods trade. Welfare falls\nas it does in the no change economy. Surprisingly, average production actually increases\nas risk increases. This is because the quantity given up by sellers in making change trades\nrises as the value of the dollar increases relative to the home currency. Although the\nvolume of trading in the currency market is much smaller than in the no change economy,\nthe pattern is the same as before \u00ad it initially rises, then falls and eventually shuts down\ncompletely when the home currency risk is too large.\nTable 8 shows the behavior of nominal exchange rates in this economy.\nCurrency Market Exchange Rates for a\nMedium \"Making Change\" Economy\nNominal\nExchange Rate\nConditional\nProbabilities\n(Home per dollar) 1\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nSize of Currency\nMarket\nThe qualitative results are the same as before \u00ad an increase in domestic currency risk\ncauses the home currency to depreciate and the variance of the nominal exchange rate\ndistribution to increase then decrease. The main quantitative difference is the reduction in\nthe number of observed exchange rates, which is the result of having agents diversify their\ncurrency portfolios via making change trades as opposed to pure currency trades.\n5.2.4 Very Large Portfolios N = 15, No Making Change Trades\nIn this section we increase the inventory constraint to N=15. With N=15 there are 136\ndifferent portfolio states, 120 potential sellers and a minimum of 220 prices. Despite the\nsubstantial increase in portfolio states, the same basic patterns occur here as when N=10.\nWe also examined the case of N=15 when agents are allowed to engage in making change\ntrades. The results displayed the same patterns as in the N=10 case and are thus not\npresented here.\nTable 5 shows the economic data for the no change trade economy when we varied the\ndegree of domestic currency risk:\nLarge Portfolio Economy with Differing Currency Risk\nParameter Values: N=15, Mf\n=Mh\nPercentage of goods trades using:\nTable 9 shows that increasing the degree of currency risk causes the frequency of goods\ntrading to fall. Welfare also falls, while the average production increases. Production\nincreases because fewer trades are occurring with rich sellers (since they are having their\ncurrency confiscated), hence the average quantity traded per match rises. Again, as in the\ncase with N=10, the home price of goods increases while the dollar price of goods falls.\nConsequently, the implied real exchange rate between the two currencies shows a\ndramatic depreciation of the home currency. With regards to the degree of dollarization\nthat occurs, we see a similar pattern as in the N=10 case. Initially, the percentage of dollar\nonly trades falls while the percentage of trades involving goods for a bundle of the two\ncurrencies increases. In short, buyers now start to give up some home and foreign currency\nunits rather than using dollars only. This is consistent with idea that at low levels of risk,\nbuyers start dumping the home currency on sellers. However, as the currency risk rises,\nbuyers increasing resort to using dollars since the quantities purchased with the home\ncurrency fall dramatically. Thus for sufficiently high levels of risk, currency competition\nkicks in and dollarization occurs.\nTable 10 shows the nominal exchange rate distributions for the risky economies:\nCurrency Market in Large Portfolio Economy\nwith Differing Currency Risk\nNominal\nExchange\nRate\nConditional\nProbability\n(Home per Dollar) 1\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\nSize of Currency\nMarket\nFrom Table 6 we see that the number of exchange rates observed increases significantly\nwhen the inventory restriction is loosened. We now observe 10 nominal exchange rates\nacross these economies. However, as in the case with N=10, most of the mass is\ndistributed over a couple of nominal exchange rates until the currency risk gets very large.\nAs before, an increase in currency risk leads to a nominal depreciation of the home\ncurrency against the dollar and a significant increase in the variance of the nominal\nexchange rate. The standard deviation is over 3 times larger in the high-risk economy\nthan the low risk economy. The currency market is most active when the currency risk is\nlow; as risk increases, the volatility of the exchange rate and the risk associated with\nholding home currency, leads to a reduction in activity in the 'financial' market. Thus,\ngreater risk and uncertainty leads to a reduction in financial market trading volume.\nAs a final exercise, we artificially closed down currency exchange in order to see what the\nwelfare effects were from having the ability to trade currencies to arbitrage risk. In general\nwe found that the existence of the currency market led to a 1% point increase in welfare.\nWhile not dramatic, this is in part due to the small size of the currency market and in part\nto the ability of agents to simply use bundles of currency to trade for goods. For a few\nparameterizations (particularly when N is small) we found much more dramatic effects on\nwelfare \u00ad as much as a 4% point increase in welfare. Thus, the welfare effects of currency\nexchange appear to be important but small in our model.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have developed an analyzed a model that generates currency exchange in\nan economy even though both currencies are accepted as media of exchange. As a result\nwe are able to obtain equilibrium nominal exchange rates based on a model in which\nmoney is essential. Thus, starting from first principles, we can study how currency risk\naffects the exchange value of two distinct currencies in a single economy. We have also\ncontributed to the growing literature involving the distribution of money and prices in\nsearch theoretic model. We have shown that monetary equilibria exist in which both\ncurrencies circulate as media of exchange. New aspects of our work that have not been\nstudied in previous work are the issue of portfolio diversification, the endogenous\ndetermination of nominal exchange rates and the role of risk aversion in portfolio choice.\nOur comparative static analysis revealed sensible predictions regarding how the values of\ncurrencies change after various changes in policy regimes. They also revealed some\nsurprising results regarding the behavior of the nominal exchange rate distributions that\nneed to be explored further. We have also been able to study the issues of dollarization and\ncurrency substitution from first principles without having to resort to artificial restrictions\non which currency is used as a medium of exchange. Dollarization is the natural outcome\nof optimizing agents in the face of risky domestic currencies. Consequently, it is a market\nresponse to bad government policy rather than a regime dictated by the government.\nFurther work in this area is needed to understand the consequences of dollarization and\nwhat governments can do to prevent it. One additional easy extension to our work is to\nallow agents to trade in several different foreign currencies. This would allow one to\nanalyze the effect of a new intenational currency competitor such as the Euro and the\nDollar on countries with weak currencies.\nReferences\nAiyagari, S.
