The field of psychiatric epi-\ndemiology has been slow in meeting this challenge, in part\nbecause of disagreements about thresholds regarding the\npresence of disorder (1) and in part because of the connected\nfailure to establish reliability of measurement (2, 3). Ex-\nplicit diagnostic criteria provided in the American Psychi-\natric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, Third Edition (4) helped address these\nproblems and provided the foundation for population mea-\nsurement in the so-called third generation of psychiatric\nepidemiology (5), which began with the National Institute\nof Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program\n(6\u00ad8) and continues to the present.\nA stimulus to efforts in descriptive epidemiology has\nbeen the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (9). It is\neasier to describe the population aspects of diseases closely\nassociated with mortality than it is to do so for nonfatal\nconditions, such as the psychiatric disorders. Incorporation\nof nonfatal disability resulting from health conditions into\nan overall measure of disease burden demonstrated to many\npeople, for the first time, the importance of the neuropsy-\nchiatric conditions. In 2001, neuropsychiatric conditions as\na broad category were responsible for 21 percent of the total\ndisease burden in the world: only infectious and parasitic\ndiseases (41 percent) and cardiovascular diseases (26 per-\ncent) were more important. Unipolar depressive disorder\nwas the leading source of burden among the psychiatric\nconditions (6 percent); among the specific disease catego-\nries, only lower respiratory infections were more important\nThis review concisely and systematically summarizes\ndata on the burden associated with 11 major mental disor-\nders in adults. We decided that the corpus of literature would\nnot sustain a formal meta-analysis (11) and instead present\nsummary measures here. The measures of burden include\nestimates of prevalence, mortality associated with the dis-\norders, disabilities and impairments related to the disorders,\nand costs. To the extent possible, we build upon existing\nreviews that are often focused on a single disorder.\nCorrespondence to Dr. William W.

It expands the range of mental\ndisorders considered in the GBD report, updates the litera-\nture, provides information on the range and depth of sources\nof information on burden, and adds estimates of costs. The\npurpose of the review is to provide an accessible guide to the\nburden of mental disorders, especially for researchers and\npolicy makers who may not be familiar with this subfield of\nepidemiology.\nMETHODS\nThe most common form of prevalence reported across the\n11 disorders was the 1-year prevalence. The 1-year preva-\nlence is a hybrid type of prevalence between lifetime prev-\nalence and point prevalence, recording the history of the\ndisorder within a year prior to assessment (12). It differs\nfrom lifetime prevalence in focusing on only 1 year. It dif-\nfers from period prevalence in that data for individuals in the\ndesignated population who entered during the year of study\nbut died before the assessment are not included in the nu-\nmerator of the rate. Since there is not a strong relation be-\ntween the occurrence of mental disorders and death within\n1 year, the 1-year prevalence is close to the 1-year period\nprevalence. For those disorders that typically endure for a\nyear or more, the 1-year prevalence is not too different from\nthe point prevalence. Limitation of this review to the 1-year\nprevalence has the advantage of reducing variation due to\ndifferences in reporting period; it has the disadvantage that\nmany studies were not included in the results presented here\nbecause they reported either a lifetime prevalence rate or\na point prevalence rate.\nFor the review of prevalence, only studies of the general\npopulation were included, since a large proportion of indi-\nviduals with mental disorders never end up in a treatment\nsetting. Studies of samples drawn from clinics, or from the\nrecords of health maintenance organizations, were excluded\n(except where noted for schizophrenia). We required that the\nsample size be larger than 500 to enhance statistical stability\nof the findings. To minimize effects of response bias, we\nexcluded studies in which the response rate was less than 60\npercent. Only studies of adults, including a range of at least\n20 years beyond age 15 years, were included. Studies that\nfocused on specific demographic groups of populations, for\nexample, defined by narrow age ranges, one gender, migrant\nstatus, or socioeconomic status, were excluded. Studies of\nspecial health populations, such as individuals with a par-\nticular health condition or disease, were also excluded.\nPopulation-based studies of one ethnic group, or one na-\ntional group, were included (i.e., fitting within the definition\nof ``general population''). Where possible, in studies report-\ning data from more than one ethnic group and data from all\ngroups combined, the rate for the combined group was re-\nported, if available, or was computed, if possible; otherwise,\nrates for specific ethnic groups were reported as if they were\nseparate studies. Where data for both genders were reported\nseparately and the sample numbers for each gender were\nalso reported, the rate for both sexes combined was esti-\nmated and reported.\nThis review focuses on mental disorders with specific\ndiagnostic criteria, and it was a requirement that the assess-\nment procedure be in person or by telephone and that there\nbe some degree of structure to the assessment. Thus, studies\nwere included only if they used structured or semistructured\ndiagnostically oriented interviews conducted in person or by\ntelephone. The measurement characteristics of these meth-\nods have been reviewed elsewhere (13). Many studies were\neliminated because of this constraint. The diagnoses re-\nported in the studies had to match exactly the named di-\nagnoses, so that, in the case of major depressive disorder,\nfor example, studies reporting groups of disorders such as\n``depressive disorders'' or ``mood disorders'' were not in-\ncluded. Two-stage studies were included as long as the sec-\nond stage yielded a specific diagnosis. In studies reporting\na diagnosis based on both the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders and the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases, the prevalence of diagnosis based on the\nformer source was used.\nFor the reviews of mortality, there were similar restric-\ntions. Again, taking depressive disorders as the example,\nassessment of depression had to be similarly oriented toward\ndiagnosis, but the type of occurrence could be lifetime, pe-\nriod, or at only one point in time. Studies based on samples\ndrawn from psychiatric clinics or psychiatric treatment-\nbased registers, or samples chosen because of other ill-\nnesses, were excluded. A difference between the studies\nselected for prevalence and for mortality is that samples with\nrestricted age ranges (usually the elderly) were included. In\naddition, regarding the study of mortality, several studies\nselected cases and noncases from population-based cohorts,\nand these studies were included since estimation of the odds\nratio or relative risk does not require complete enumeration\nof the cohort. Excluded were studies that reported mortality\ndue to a specific condition (e.g., cancer) but did not present\nmortality due to all causes. As a result of these restrictions,\nmany high-quality studies were excluded.\nMeasures of disability are taken from the estimates of the\nGBD Study (9), as well as estimates available from the\nCollaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES,\ndescribed below (14)) and the Canadian Community Health\nSurvey (15). Measures of per capita cost are taken from\na more limited range of studies. Some of these studies are\nfocused on the United States, and the costs given are in-\ncluded here. When studies were not available on costs for\nthe United States, studies from other countries were located,\nthe costs were converted to 2005 US dollars, and then they\nwere applied to the median estimates of prevalence and the\nUS population to generate total costs.\nThe GBD disability weights were developed from ratings\nof symptomatic and behavioral vignettes by expert raters in\na consensus process. Raters were asked to make choices\nregarding prevention programs comparing extension of life\nfor a healthy person (e.g., a program that would extend\nlife for a healthy person by 1 year) with extension of life\n(e.g., for 2 years) for a person disabled by a health condition.\nA rating of 0.0 indicates no disability at all during a given\nyear of life, whereas a rating of 1.0 is equal to death. Higher\n2 Eaton et al.\nvalues indicate more disability and lower quality of life.\nA value of 0.5 indicates that the individual would have the\nsame quality of life for 2 years as a completely healthy\nindividual with a value of 0.0 would experience in 1 year.\nThese ratings have the advantage that population aspects of\nburden of fatal and nonfatal conditions can be compared. As\nan example, the severity rating for quadriplegia is 0.90, for\nblindness is 0.62, for multiple sclerosis is 0.41, for deafness\nis 0.33, for rheumatoid arthritis is 0.21, and for watery di-\narrhea is 0.07 (9). (Ratings for psychiatric conditions are\nreported below.)\nThe CPES (14) is a combination of three surveys in the\nUnited States with representative samples of the entire adult\npopulation of the United States (National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication (16)), the African-American population of\nthe United States (National Survey of American Life (17)),\nand the Latin-American and Asian population of the United\nStates (National Latino and Asian American Survey (18)).\nThe combined sample size for the CPES is 20,130, and all\nthree surveys met our eligibility criteria. The surveys in the\nCPES used the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) to assess\nimpairment due to many of the disorders addressed in this\nreview (19). The SDS is a brief self-report measure that\nassesses functional impairments on a 10-point, discretized,\nclinical trials and has been used in hundreds of research\nstudies and translated into 48 languages (20). In the CPES,\nthe SDS was used in the separate sections corresponding to\neach disorder, with separate questions relating to the extent\nto which each of four areas of functioning in work, house-\nhold, relationship, and social roles was impaired in the worst\nmonth of the past year for the problems associated with the\ngiven disorder (21). In the current analysis, a threshold of\ndisability was based on a rating of marked-to-extreme im-\npairment (i.e., scale value of 7). In this review, we report\nthe percentage of the individuals meeting criteria for a given\ndisorder who have marked-to-extreme impairment on one or\nmore of the four SDS role domains.\nThe CPES did not include SDS data for alcohol and drug\ndisorders, but these impairment measures were available\nfor alcohol and drug dependence disorders from the 2002\nCanadian Community Health Survey cycle 1.2, a probability\nsample of 36,984 community-dwelling respondents repre-\nsenting the population of Canada older than 15 years of age,\nwhich had a special focus on mental health and well-being\n(15). The diagnoses in this survey were limited to alcohol or\ndrug dependence (i.e., not including alcohol and drug abuse\nwithout dependence).\nWe conducted a targeted literature review by concentrat-\ning on US-based studies in the past 15 years to obtain data\non total cost estimates for the disease or cost per case per\nyear. Credible estimates for the United States were located\nfor major depressive disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence,\ndrug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, and bipolar dis-\norder. When data were unavailable, total costs from studies\nconducted outside the United States were used to estimate\nper capita costs for the population of adults. For these dis-\norders, the number of adults in the United States in 2005\n(222 million) was multiplied by the median prevalences\ngiven in table 1, and that product was multiplied by per\ncapita costs to generate total costs in the United States. Cost\nestimates were adjusted to 2005 US constant dollars by using\ninflation factor and/or purchasing power parity indices.\nPrior systematic reviews were sought and were reported\nto the degree possible for tables 1 and 2.

The yield in ar-\nticles for these broad terms is included in tables 1 and 2. In\nsearching for the widest net possible, the search terms for\neach of the disorders were varied but always included these\nbroad terms. Complete citations for all studies used--that is,\nincluding those in the prior reviews--are listed in this paper\nfor the convenience of the reader who may want to investi-\ngate individual articles more thoroughly.\nFor each disorder, separate Microsoft Excel spreadsheets\n(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) were pre-\npared for the prevalence and mortality studies, including\ncharacteristics of the studies such as their location, target\npopulation, sample size, response rate, diagnostic standard,\nand assessment procedure. These spreadsheets, and the\nrelevant lists of citations, are available on the World\nWide Web at http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/mh/_includes/epi_\nmental_disorders.html.

There were only five studies of the prevalence of\npersonality disorder, the smallest number for any disorder,\nand the largest number was 42--for the studies of the prev-\nalence of major depressive disorder.\nThe reviews of panic disorder, social phobia, and simple/\nspecific phobia built upon the review of Somers et al.

For all six East Asian studies, prev-\nalence estimates were in the lower quartile.

All three of the East Asian studies had\nprevalence rates of social phobia in the lower quartile.

Six of the nine studies in\nthe low quartile were in East Asia, but otherwise there were\nno obvious conclusions to be reached about the place of the\nstudy, the study method, or the time that it was conducted.\nThere were 19 studies of the prevalence of obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder. The search for relevant titles was aided\nby a relatively comprehensive, but nonsystematic review by\nFontenelle et al. (24).

Most of these studies were conducted\nin the United States. There were no obvious associations\nwith variables such as place of the study, the study method,\nor the time that it was conducted.\nThe search for studies of drug use disorder yielded 1,417\ntitles, of which 467 were examined closely but only 11 met\nthe above criteria. The 1-year prevalences ranged from 0.4\npercent in Mexico to 3.6 percent in the United States, and\nthe median prevalence was 1.8 percent. About 50 percent of\nthe studies were conducted in the United States. All studies\nin the low quartile were conducted outside the United States\n(i.e., Mexico, Germany, and Norway). The prevalence in the\nsingle Australian study was in the high quartile.\nThe review of personality disorders identified 629 studies,\nof which 168 were examined closely. Many of these focused\non a single personality disorder and were excluded. More\nthan 20 studies reported prevalence of all personality disor-\nders together, but they included clinical samples, restricted\nage ranges, or assessments not meeting our criteria. Only\nfive studies met our inclusion criteria, the lowest number in\ntable 1, so we investigated the effect of relaxation of one or\nanother of the criteria. We found that the prevalence rate was\nnot much affected by these differences. Table 1 shows only\nthe five studies meeting our inclusion criteria. The median\nprevalence based on these studies was 9.1 percent, with an\nThe review of schizophrenia was taken from the work of\nMcGrath et al. (25) and was not updated. Of all the disorders\npresented, schizophrenia is the one for which prevalence is\nleast likely to be underestimated because of reliance on data\nfrom medical records, and also the one for which the di-\nagnosis by an interviewer without medical training is most\nsuspect (26). Therefore, data from population-based medi-\ncal reporting systems (registers) were included here. Since\nthe diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia require a degree of\nchronicity (6 months), these studies include point preva-\nlence as well as 1-year prevalence. There were 23 relevant\nstudies, and the median prevalence was 0.5 percent.

Studies that included bipolar II diagnoses, that\nis, not presenting data specifically for bipolar I disorder,\nwere excluded. As with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder is\ndifficult to diagnose without a medically trained examiner,\nbut there were so few reports based on register systems that\nwe decided to include population-based survey studies as\nlong as they used a standardized structured interview.

(27), with supplementary data\navailable on the World Wide Web (http://www.alz.co.uk/\nresearch/consensus.html). Only those studies that made di-\nagnoses based on an international and documented opera-\ntional system (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders or the International Classification of Dis-\neases) were included. We required that studies of dementia\nbe focused on the elderly, defined here as older than 60\nyears of age (six studies focused on persons aged >60 years,\nwith the remainder focusing on persons aged >65 years)\nand that the study report an overall prevalence rate for both\nsexes and all ages combined. The studies varied as to the\nnumber of stages required to reach a diagnosis (from one to\nthree). For this disorder only, the definition of ``general\npopulation'' was expanded to include institutional popula-\ntions, since, in Japan, Europe, and the United States, many\nof the elderly live in institutional communities. The review\nby Ferri et al. included reports from two systematic reviews\ncluded in these reviews could not be identified separately,\nand thus the results shown in table 1 potentially under-\nestimate European studies and the variation in studies\ngenerally. The median prevalence was 5.4 percent of the\npopulation over the age of 60 years, with an interquartile\nMORTALITY\nWe found many fewer studies of the risk of mortality\nassociated with a history of a mental disorder (table 2), even\nthough it has been a long-standing interest in psychiatry\n(30\u00ad33). We were unable to find any credible estimates for\nthe association of mortality with social phobia or simple\nphobia. Three of the four studies of panic disorder and mor-\ntality, and both studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder\nand mortality, were from different sites and time periods\nof the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. These mea-\nger results for anxiety disorders may reflect a raised risk for\nsome individuals and a lower risk for others, depending, for\nexample, on age (34). The three studies that met our criteria\nfor drug abuse or dependence and mortality (drawn from the\nEpidemiologic Catchment Area Program, as above) suggest\n  5\na doubling of risk, and three independent studies of person-\nality disorder suggest a quadrupling of risk of mortality.\nFor the study of major depressive disorder, the reviews of\nSaz and Dewey (35) and of Wulsin et al. (36) were used. The\nsearch terms ``mortality'' and ``depressive disorder'' and\n``population'' were entered into PubMed, yielding 282\narticles. Many articles were eliminated because they focused\non a specific cause of death, many others were excluded\nbecause they used screening scales or symptom counts with-\nout referring to a diagnosis, and a third large group was\neliminated because they included only those persons under\ntreatment for major depressive disorder. Five articles in the\nreview of Saz and Dewey met our criteria, and nine were\nadded from the results of the literature search. Our review\nindicated that depressive disorder raises the risk of all-cause\nmortality by about 70 percent, with an interquartile range of\nFor alcohol use disorder, 913 titles were generated by the\nsearch terms, and 148 were examined closely. Many studies\nwere eliminated because they included only those persons\nunder treatment for alcohol abuse/dependence. Only seven\nof these studies met the above criteria. Mortality relative\nrisk rates ranged from 1.4 in the United States to 3.3 in\nNorway. Two of the seven studies were conducted outside\nthe United States (i.e., in France and Norway), and both\nwere in the high quartile.\nPopulation-based studies focusing on mortality among\nindividuals with drug use disorders are almost nonexistent.\nFor drug use disorder, the search yielded 610 titles, but most\nwere eliminated because they included only those persons\nunder treatment for drug abuse/dependence.

The median relative risk for the\nFor the study of mortality related to dementia, 15 studies\nwere selected from the review of Dewey and Saz (37), and\nfour later studies (one with two sites) were added. Many\nstudies were eliminated because they did not report the rel-\native odds or standardized mortality ratio for the total sample\nover 65 years of age. Others were excluded because they did\nnot diagnose according to operational criteria. The median\nrelative risk for mortality associated with dementia was 2.7.\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorder have the highest dis-\nability ratings according to the methodology of the GBD\nalso includes 83 percent with severe disability on one or\nmore of the four areas in the SDS. It is difficult to imagine\nwhat the results would be if the SDS methodology had been\napplied to persons meeting criteria for schizophrenia, since\nthey may lack insight into their condition. Major depressive\ndisorder is next in both the GBD (rating of 0.35 for the\n``moderate'' form) and SDS (58 percent reporting severe\ndisability) method. Thus, major depressive disorder com-\npares roughly with multiple sclerosis (0.41) or deafness\n(0.33) in the GBD rating. Major depressive disorder in the\nso-called severe form has a rating of 0.62, identical to that\nfor blindness. Panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder reveal moderately high disability according to the\nSDS methods but not according to the GBD method (0.17\nfor panic disorder, 0.13 for obsessive-compulsive disorder\ncompared with a rating of 0.21 for rheumatoid arthritis). The\nSDS measures contrast with the disability weights used in\nthe GBD studies presumably because the GBD disability\nweights are ratings by others, whereas the SDS ratings\nare from the individual. For example, panic disorder may\nbe quite impairing from the point of view of the individual\n(47 percent with severe impairment on the SDS) but not\nbe disabling and socially disruptive in the way that bipolar\nOther measures of burden, such as self-assessed distress,\nmight yield different ranks. For example, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, with a relatively low GBD rating but\na high SDS percentage, might be highly distressing to the\nindividual but less impairing and socially disruptive com-\npared with these other measures, and this difference would\nhave been revealed if we had been able to find and include\na parallel set of measures for this aspect of burden.\nThe cost estimates in our review are based on single\nstudies, in many cases the only study of costs available for\nthat disorder. The estimates reveal considerable variation\nacross disorders, from $11 billion per year for simple phobia\nto more than $200 billion per year for alcohol use disorders\nor drug use disorders. These estimates are composed of di-\nrect and indirect costs. The direct costs are mostly treatment\ncosts, and only a minority of individuals with the disorders\nreviewed received treatment (with the possible exception of\nsevere disorders such as schizophrenia). The only study of\npersonality disorders (38) estimated costs for personality\ndisorders in treatment, but, since we had no estimate of\nthe percentage with this diagnosis who need treatment or\ncould benefit from it, we did not include the results in table 3\n(which would be $446 billion per year in the United States if\nevery person with the disorder were to receive treatment).\nThe indirect costs reflect all persons with the disorders,\nwhether or not in treatment, and it is not clear whether\ntreatment would be effective if applied to all cases of a dis-\norder. The upshot of these considerations is that the cost\nestimates in table 3 may underestimate the direct costs that\nwould occur if all persons with the disorder were to receive\ntreatment but possibly overestimate the indirect costs that\nwould be saved if all persons were treated. The cost\nestimates are from diverse sources, with a wide range of\nmethodologies, involving numerous assumptions; and the\nnumber of estimates is limited. Therefore, they should be\nconsidered provisional.\nThe estimates for costs are complex functions of the prev-\nalence and disability associated with the disorder, the costs\nof treatment, and the indirect costs. The lowest annual cost\nestimate in table 3 is for obsessive-compulsive disorder\n($10.6 billion per year), which is associated with lower\n6 Eaton et al.\ndisability than other disorders and is also uncommon. The\nphobias have low associated disability but are slightly more\ncommon, yielding somewhat higher cost estimates ($15.7\nbillion for social phobia and $11.0 billion for simple pho-\nbia). Panic disorder is rare but has higher associated SDS\nseverity, also with higher costs ($30.4 billion). For rare dis-\norders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the costs\nfor a single year in the United States are $70 billion or more,\npresumably because of the high associated disability. Major\ndepressive disorder has high costs that result from its rela-\ntively high prevalence and the moderate-to-severe level of\ndisability associated with it. The surprising numbers in table\n3 are the costs associated with alcohol and drug disorders,\nboth taken from a single study funded by the US govern-\nment (39). The three externalizing disorders (drug and al-\ncohol disorders (table 3) and personality disorders\n(discussed above but not shown in table 3) involve costs\nto others and to society that are smaller or do not exist for\nthe other conditions.\nDISCUSSION\nAs a group, mental disorders have a high prevalence, in\ngeneral, compared with many other health conditions. Even\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with the lowest preva-\nlences among the disorders considered here (i.e., <1 per-\ncent), have a higher prevalence than many other diseases\nand health conditions. These relatively less common disor-\nders have high associated impairment. These two disorders\nmight be termed the ``less common and severe mental dis-\norders.'' Three other disorders--panic disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and drug abuse or dependence--also\nhave a median prevalence of less than 2 percent and might\nthus be considered ``less common.'' Of these three, drug\nabuse and/or dependence has nontrivial consequences, in-\ncluding a GBD disability weight of 0.25, a median relative\nrisk of mortality of 2.0, and an estimated annual cost of over\n$200 billion. Major depressive disorder, the phobias, and\nalcohol abuse or dependence have median prevalence rates\nof more than 5 percent and are the ``common'' mental dis-\norders. Major depressive disorder stands apart from these\nbecause of its high associated impairment, either by the\nGBD rating or the percentage with extreme disability on\nthe SDS scale, which explains its place in the GBD Study\nas the mental disorder claiming the highest percentage of\ndisability-adjusted life years. A surprise in these compara-\ntive results is the high median prevalence of personality\ndisorder, at more than 9 percent, as well as the high associ-\nated mortality risk, with a median relative odds of 4.0.\nTABLE 3.

The relatively high\nprevalence of personality disorder contrasts with the scar-\ncity of data on its prevalence, associated mortality, and\ncost.\nAlmost all of the studies included in tables 1 and 2 were\nconducted during the so-called third generation of psychi-\natric epidemiologic research, which was inaugurated with\nthe National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic\nCatchment Area Program (6, 7) and includes a number of\nstudies using similar methodologies around the world (e.g.,\nBland et al. (40)), including an entire separate body of work\nfollowing the National Comorbidity Survey (41), with ad-\nditional recent results of many national surveys from the\nThis feature of the review results from the requirement for\nstructured diagnostic interviews such as the Diagnostic In-\nterview Schedule (44) and its descendants, including the\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview Schedule\n(45). These and other similar instruments are reliable but\nconnect only moderately well to the results of a psychiatric\ninterview (13, 46). However, they are the only alternatives\nfor population-based studies in the field of psychiatric epi-\ndemiology in which such a large percentage of cases do not\nseek or obtain treatment.\nIn 1996 it was reported, with respect to the GBD Study,\nthat ``our understanding of the descriptive epidemiology of\nmany, if not most, conditions is not advanced'' (9, p. 42).\nHave we remedied that situation, at least with respect to the\npsychiatric conditions? Can we possibly conclude that the\nthird generation of research is complete, since there now is\nsuch a strong body of global research on the prevalence of\nmental disorders? While the prevalence of mental disor-\nders has been well studied, this review shows that data on\nthe simplest aspect of disability--death--is limited or\nnonexistent for many disorders. Even keeping within the\nconfines of purely descriptive epidemiology, there are\nmeager results from population-based research concerning\nthe natural history of disorders, such as incidence and\nsymptomatic course, not considered in this review, even\nthough these indicators of the population dynamics of\nmental disorders are vital to understanding the burden of\ndisease and the implications of various types of preven-\ntion strategies. The papers in this issue of Epidemiologic\nReviews display a range of research with considerable\nbreadth and depth in analytic and experimental epidemi-\nology, moving considerably beyond counting cases. The\nexistence of this issue of Epidemiologic Reviews--the\nsecond devoted to psychiatric disorders (47)--is evidence\nof maturity in the field of psychiatric epidemiology.\nPerhaps the era of ``generations'' is complete, in that the\nfield of psychiatry has successfully been integrated into the\nfield of epidemiology--something that had not happened\nas of 1981 when the Epidemiologic Catchment Area was\nstarted. Even with these signs of progress, however, much\nremains to be done.\n"
