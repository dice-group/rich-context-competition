It is un-\nknown whether women with pre-diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), have increased\nprevalence of incontinence. We determined the prevalence of, and risk factors for, incontinence\namong U.S. women with diabetes and IFG.\ntrition Examination Survey measured fasting plasma glucose and obtained information about\ndiabetes and urinary incontinence among 1,461 nonpregnant adult women. Self-reported\nweekly or more frequent incontinence, both overall and by type (urge and stress), was our\noutcome.\nRESULTS -- Of the 1,461 women, 17% had diabetes and 11% met criteria for IFG. Prevalence\nof weekly incontinence was similar among women in these two groups (35.4 and 33.4%,\nrespectively) and significantly higher than among women with normal fasting glucose (16.8%);\nboth urge and stress incontinence were increased. In addition to well-recognized risk factors\nincluding age, weight, and oral estrogen use, two microvascular complications caused by dia-\nbetes, specifically macroalbuminuria and peripheral neuropathic pain, were associated with\nincontinence.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Physicians should be alert for incontinence, an often unrecognized and\ntherefore undertreated disorder, among women with diabetes and IFG, in particular those with\nmicrovascular complications. The additional prospect of improvements in their incontinence\nmay help motivate some high-risk women to undertake difficult lifestyle changes to reduce their\nmore serious risk of diabetes and its sequelae.\nUrinary incontinence, present in\nnearly 50% of middle-aged and\nolder women, results in psycholog-\nical stress and social isolation and has a\nprofound effect on quality of life (1). The\ncosts are substantial, up to $32 billion per\nyear in the U.S., and greater than the an-\nnual direct costs for breast, ovarian, cer-\nvical, and uterine cancers combined\nType 2 diabetes also is a common and\ncostly disorder. While 17 million adults\nin the U.S. have diabetes, another 43 mil-\nlion adults are estimated to have \"pre-\ndiabetes,\" or impaired fasting glucose\n(IFG) (4,5). Recent evidence strongly sug-\ngests that urinary incontinence is a com-\nmore common among women with type 2\ndiabetes than among women with normal\nglucose levels (6\u00ad8). However, no studies\nhave determined whether women with\nIFG are also at higher risk of incontinence.\nWhile it is known that incontinence is\nmore common in women with diabetes,\nmechanisms by which type 2 diabetes\nmay contribute to its development or se-\nverity are not well defined. A likely etiol-\nogy for incontinence is microvascular\ndamage, similar to the disease process in-\nvolved in development of retinopathy,\nnephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.\nAccordingly, duration of diabetes (7,8),\ninsulin treatment (6), peripheral neurop-\nathy (8), and retinopathy (8) have been\nshown to be important risk factors for in-\ncontinence among women with diabetes.\nLess is known about risk factors specific\nto urge and stress incontinence among\nwomen with type 2 diabetes, even though\nthese clearly differ in clinical presentation\nand response to treatment.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional anal-\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES). Our goal was to esti-\nmate prevalence and identify risk factors\nfor urinary incontinence among women\nwith pre-diabetes or diabetes. We were\nable to evaluate a broad range of inconti-\nnence risk factors, while controlling for\npotential confounding variables.\nNHANES is a nationally representative\nprobability sample of noninstitutionalized\ncivilians. Using self-reported race/ethnicity,\nparticipants were identified using a com-\nplex, stratified, multistage probability clus-\nter design that oversampled non-Hispanic\nblacks, Mexican Americans, individuals\n                                                \nFrom the 1UCSF Women's Health Clinical Research Center, University of California, San Francisco, Cali-\nfornia; and the 2National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health,\nBethesda, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Jeanette S.

After these ex-\nremainedinouranalysissample.Womenin\nour study population did not differ in age,\nrace, parity, BMI, and estrogen use com-\npared with the women who were excluded.\nOur primary analyses of risk factors for in-\ncontinence was conducted in the sub-\nwomen with diabetes.\nDiabetes was defined by a self-report\nof diabetes or if fasting plasma glucose\nfined as fasting plasma glucose between\nwomen, with fasting glucose 100 mg/\ndl, were classified as having normal glu-\ncose levels. NHANES ascertains self-\nreported diabetes duration, use of oral\nhypoglycemic medications, use of insu-\nlin, and history of physician-diagnosed\nretinopathy. Additionally, all participants\nwere questioned about symptoms of pe-\nripheral neuropathy over the past 3\nmonths, including \"numbness or loss of\nfeeling in your hands or feet other than\nfrom your hands or feet falling asleep,\"\nand \"a painful sensation or tingling in\nyour hands or feet. . . not including nor-\nmal foot aches from standing or walking\nfor long periods.\" Participants were also\nasked whether they ever had an ulcer or\nsore on their leg or foot that took 4\nweeks to heal. HbA1c\n(A1C) level was\nmeasured from blood specimens on all\nparticipants by the Primus automated\nhigh-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy analyzer (Primus, Kansas City, MO).\nA random urine sample was obtained\nfrom all participants during the survey.\nUrinary albumin concentration (in micro-\ngrams per milliliter) was measured by sol-\nid-phase fluorescent immunoassay (11)\n(Sequoia-Turner, Mountain View, CA),\nand urinary creatinine concentration (in\nmilligrams per milliliter) was measured\nby the modified kinetic method of Jaffe\n\u00b4\n(Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA). Mi-\ncroalbuminuria was defined as a urinary\nmg/g and macroalbuminuria as an albu-\nmin-to-creatinine ratio 300 mg/g. All\nlaboratory tests were collected at a single\nexamination, and details about the labo-\nratory procedures of all these tests are\npublished elsewhere (12).\nUrinary incontinence was deter-\nmined by a self-administered question-\nnaire based on validated instruments used\nin previous studies (13). The sequence of\nincontinence questions began with\n\"[d]uring the past 12 months have you\nleaked or lost control of even a small\namount of urine. . . ,\" followed by \"with\nan activity like coughing, lifting, or exer-\ncise?\" (stress incontinence) and \"with an\nurge or pressure to urinate and could not\nget to the toilet fast enough?\" (urge incon-\ntinence). Frequency for each type of in-\ncontinence was ascertained as every day, a\nfew times a week, a few times a month, or\na few times a year. The primary outcome\nof interest was weekly or more frequent\nincontinence. We also examined the level\nof bother of incontinence and the effect of\nincontinence on the participant's quality\nof life. Participants were asked about the\ndegree of worry created by urine leakage\nand the affect of urine leakage on day-to-\nday activities during the previous 12\nmonths. These questions were catego-\nrized as \"not at all\" or \"only a little\" versus\n\"somewhat,\" \"very much,\" or \"greatly.\"\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using Stata (version 8;\nStata, College Station, TX) programs spe-\ncialized for complex survey data. These\nprocedures accommodate sampling\nweights, as well as compute SEs and use\nmodified hypothesis tests that account for\nstratification and clustering of the multi-\nstage NHANES sampling design. The\nsampling weights are inversely propor-\ntional to the probability of selection into\nthe sample and are therefore interpretable\nas the number of individuals in the target\npopulation that each sample participant is\nestimated to represent. Moreover, the\nweights are corrected to sum-to-subpopu-\nlation totals by region and demographic\nsubgroup, based on the U.S. Census.\nThus, the national prevalence of inconti-\nnence among women with diabetes was\nestimated by a weighted proportion; spe-\ncifically, it was estimated by the number\nof diabetic women in the population with\nincontinence (sum of weights for sampled\nwomen classified as having diabetes who\nreport incontinence) divided by the num-\nber of women in the target population\nwith diabetes (sum of weights for sampled\nwomen in this category).\nWe assessed heterogeneity in the\nprevalence of urinary incontinence across\nwomen with normal fasting glucose,\nwomen with IFG, and women with diabe-\ntes using a 2 test with correction for the\nsurvey design. Risk factors for urinary in-\ncontinence were assessed using logistic\nregression models suitable for complex\nsurvey data, which accommodate the\nsampling weights and use \"robust\" SEs\nand modified t tests with degrees of free-\ndom equal to the number of primary sam-\npling units, minus the number of strata.\nWe performed separate models for\nwomen with diabetes and IFG and then a\ncombined model pooling these two pop-\nulations. Model derivation began with a\nlist of predictors determined a priori, with\nfinal multivariable models selected by\nbackward deletion, retaining risk factors\nthat remained significant at P  0.15 after\nadjustment. Age, BMI, and parity were in-\ncluded by default in these models. Corre-\nlations between predictors were generally\n0.4, indicating that collinearity did not\nadversely affect our estimates. We found\nno persuasive evidence of an interaction\nbetween various risk factors and glucose\ngroup.\nmet criteria for IFG. The overall preva-\nlence of weekly or more frequent inconti-\nnence was similar among women with\nspectively) and significantly higher than\namong women with normal fasting glu-\nurge and stress incontinence were signif-\nicantly more common among diabetic\nFurthermore, among women with incon-\ntinence, women with diabetes were more\nlikely to report being bothered by their\nincontinence symptoms, while both dia-\nbetic and pre-diabetic women felt that in-\ncontinence affected their daily activities\nsignificantly more than nondiabetic\nwomen. Adjustment for BMI did not at-\ntenuate the difference among the three\nglucose subgroups.\nTable 2 shows the characteristics of\nthe women with normal glucose, IFG, and\ndiabetes. Women with diabetes were\nmore likely to be of ethnic minority back-\nground and have a higher BMI and waist\ncircumference than those without diabe-\ntes. As expected, women with diabetes\nwere more likely to report peripheral neu-\nropathy symptoms, foot ulcers, hyperten-\nIncreased incontinence with diabetes and IFG\nsion, stroke, and claudication. Mean A1C\nlevel was 7.3% in diabetic women com-\npared with 5.7% in women with IFG. As\nexpected, higher proportions of women\nwith diabetes had micro- and macroalbu-\nminuria than women with IFG or normal\nglucose. Almost half of all diabetic women\nreported fair or poor overall health status\ncompared with only a quarter of women\nwith IFG and 18% of normoglycemic\nwomen.\nIn multivariate logistic models, pe-\nripheral neuropathy pain, a marker of mi-\ncrovascular disease, was independently\nassociated with any weekly incontinence\namong women with diabetes, while mac-\nroalbuminuria was close to criteria for sta-\ntistical significance (Table 3). Past history\nof hysterectomy was the only other signif-\nicant risk factor among diabetic women.\nAmong women with IFG, microalbumin-\nuria was strongly associated with in-\ncreased odds of incontinence, as were\nother well-established risk factors for in-\ncontinence. Since we were limited with\nsmall numbers of outcomes in each pop-\nulation with abnormal glucose, and since\nthe estimated prevalence of incontinence\nwas similar among women with diabetes\nand IFG, we pooled these two popula-\ntions. A multivariate model in this com-\nbined population showed that both\nmacroalbuminuria and neuropathic pain\nare associated with incontinence (Table\nWe also constructed separate models\nfor weekly stress incontinence and urge\nincontinence. Results of these models\nwithin the diabetes and IFG populations,\nboth separately and combined, were\nsimilar to the models for any weekly\nincontinence. For urge incontinence,\nwith incontinence among diabetic\nwomen, whereas neuropathic pain was\nnot significant. For women with IFG,\npresence of microalbuminuria was asso-\nciated with significantly increased odds of\nwomen with IFG or diabetes reported\nweekly or more frequent urinary inconti-\nnence. We estimate that 12.7 million\nwomen have weekly incontinence in the\nU.S., including 1.9 million women\n2.9). Compared with nondiabetic\nwomen, those with diabetes and pre-\ndiabetes have a threefold increased prev-\nalence of urge incontinence and twice the\nprevalence of stress incontinence. Nearly\n60% of women with diabetes and weekly\nincontinence considered their inconti-\nnence bothersome, and 20% reported\nthat it interfered with their daily activities;\nthis was two times more frequent than\nthat reported by incontinent women\nwithout diabetes.\nIncreased prevalence of urinary in-\ncontinence among women with diabetes\nhas been previously reported in cross-\nsectional analyses (7,8,14). However, no\nstudies have examined whether women\nwith IFG, or pre-diabetes, also have in-\ncreased prevalence of incontinence. Since\nsome diabetes complications are observed\nbefore the diagnosis of diabetes (15), we\nhypothesized that the prevalence of uri-\nnary incontinence may also be increased\namong pre-diabetic patients. We found a\nstrikingly similar prevalence of inconti-\nnence, both overall and by type, among\nthe pre-diabetic and diabetic women in\nNHANES. While the difference in preva-\nlence among the glucose subgroups may\nbe accounted for by several shared risk\nfactors (BMI, parity, hysterectomy status,\nand hormone therapy use), these risk fac-\ntors continued to be independently asso-\nciated within each glucose subgroup.\nWe also found that microvascular\ncomplications, specifically peripheral\nneuropathic pain and macroalbuminuria,\nwere associated with increased risk of\nweekly incontinence in diabetic women.\nThese associations suggest that inconti-\nnence may indeed be another microvas-\ncular complication, possibly through\ndisturbances of the nerve supply to the\nurethral sphincter and bladder, causing\nsphincter damage and involuntary blad-\nder contractions resulting in incontinence\n(8,16). Thus, our findings suggest that\ntherapies for microvascular complica-\ntions of diabetes may be beneficial in the\nprevention or treatment of urinary incon-\ntinence. Although we did not find that\nA1C or blood pressure were related to in-\ncontinence, therapies that improve glyce-\nmic and blood pressure control may be\nuseful for incontinence because both im-\nproved microvascular complications in\nthe U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study\n(17,18). This hypothesis should be test-\nable in the ongoing Action to Control Car-\ndiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial.\nOur finding of a similarly high prev-\nalence of incontinence among women\nwith pre-diabetes and those with diabetes\nsuggests that incontinence may be an ear-\nlier consequence of hyperglycemia than\nother microvascular complications. Sur-\nprisingly, microalbuminuria was associ-\nated with increased odds of incontinence\namong women with IFG. Hyperglycemia\nand hyperinsulinemia, which are both re-\nlated to obesity, may be present before\ndiabetes diagnosis and contribute to the\nrisk of micro- and macrovascular disease.\nImportantly, we found increasing\nweight was significantly associated with\nincontinence, similar to the association\nfound among women without diabetes\n(6). Weight reduction has recently been\nshown to improve incontinence in mod-\nerately obese women (19). The likely\nmechanism is that decreasing abdominal\nweight reduces intra-abdominal and in-\ntravesicular pressure, as well as urethral\nmobility. We have previously found that\nintensive lifestyle change resulting in\nweight loss decreased prevalence of in-\ncontinence among women with pre-\ndiabetes who were enrolled in the\nDiabetes Prevention Program (20). We\nare currently investigating whether\nweight loss among women with type 2\ndiabetes is also associated with decreased\nincontinence in the Look AHEAD (Action\nfor Health in Diabetes) study (21).

If this proves accurate,\nthen preventing or improving inconti-\nnence may help motivate women with\npre-diabetes or diabetes to undertake dif-\nficult lifestyle modifications that reduce\nalso prevent complications associated\nSimilar to other earlier reports of risk\nfactors for incontinence among women\nwithout diabetes (7), we found that oral\nhormone therapy is an important risk fac-\ntor for incontinence among women with\npre-diabetes and diabetes. Women cur-\nrently using oral estrogens were at a three-\nfold increased risk of incontinence.\nRecent large, randomized trials of hor-\nmone therapy have found that standard\ndoses of oral estrogen increase both inci-\ndence and severity of incontinence\nand diabetes consider starting or stopping\nhormone therapy, they should be informed\nof the increased risk of incontinence.\nHysterectomy is the most common\nmajor gynecologic surgery in the U.S. Ap-\nproximately 40% of older women have\nhad a hysterectomy, of which 90% are\nperformed for benign conditions and\nmost are elective. Among nondiabetic\nwomen, hysterectomy is associated with a\n(24). We found that among women with\npre-diabetes and diabetes, hysterectomy\nis associated with a nearly threefold in-\ncreased risk of incontinence. Thus, we\nrecommend that women with pre-\ndiabetes and diabetes considering hyster-\nectomy receive counseling regarding the\npotential long-term adverse effects of\nincontinence.\nSome risk factors, in particular micro-\nvascular complications, increasing\nweight, and oral estrogen use, are associ-\nated with both urge and stress inconti-\nnence, suggesting that interventions\naddressing these risk factors may improve\nboth types of incontinence. In contrast,\nage was associated only with urge incon-\ntinence. Similar to our findings, large ob-\nservational studies have found urge\nincontinence associated with advancing\nage (6). As the population ages, both dia-\nbetes and urge incontinence will mark-\nedly increase in prevalence. Clinical\noutcomes of common treatments for in-\ncontinence in women with pre-diabetes\nand diabetes have not been critically ex-\namined, and randomized controlled trials\nare needed to assess the efficacy and safety\nof conservative, pharmacologic, and sur-\ngical treatments.\nWhile this NHANES survey included\na population-based sample of women\nwith a wide age range, we were limited in\nthe definition of the glucose categories.\nTable 3--Multivariate models for any weekly urinary incontinence among women with either IFG or diabetes, or within each abnormal glucose\npopulation\nIFG only Diabetes only Combined population*\nDiabetes complications\nAlbuminuria\nCurrent oral estrogen use\n(yes/no)\nn/N (%), unweighted prevalence of incontinence for each covariate level among the total women with this outcome.

Phy-\nsicians should be alert for incontinence,\nwhich is often unrecognized and there-\nfore undertreated, among women with di-\nabetes and IFG, in particular those with\nmicrovascular complications. The pros-\npect of improved incontinence may help\nmotivate women to undertake difficult\nlifestyle changes that have been shown to\nreduce the risk of diabetes and its se-\nquelae. Therapies with the potential to\nimprove or prevent incontinence in this\npopulation are weight loss, stopping hor-\nmone therapy, and therapies that improve\nor prevent microvascular disease, includ-\ning glycemic control and blood pressure\ncontrol.\n"
