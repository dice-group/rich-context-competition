    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe educational discourse is one of the primary places where numerous dominant ideological premises are established.\nThese discursive constructions are usually not expressed explicitly but are tacit or covered. In other words, ideological\npremises are not conveyed via ideational (dictionary) meaning of utterances. The analysis therefore has to tackle not\nthe grammatical or logical layer of the text but has to look into the pragmatic aspect of discourse or text in the social\ncommunication. In this way, Grice developed his idea of cooperative principle in the analysis of pragmatic rules (maxims)\nthat speakers use in head-to-head interactions to make themselves understood. The violation of those rules usually means\nthat the speaker is making a \"conversational\" implicature, that is, an implication that cannot be inferred from his spoken\ncontribution but assumes some common knowledge or presupposition. Conversational implicatures are therefore the places\nwhere ideological presuppositions can be detected. Grice's maxims are used in the analysis of two distinct types of texts in\nthe field of education--a regulation on textbook approval and a history textbook. In both texts, Grice's principles are used\nto uncover ideological premises.\n",

They are aimed at two crucial groups,\nnamely those to be educated (pupils and students) and also\nthe educators (teachers and professors). Therefore, they are\nof immanent research interest as one of the instruments that\nteachers use when trying to achieve curricular objectives, but\nthey are also often teaching devices on their own as in the\nlast instance the use of textbooks could theoretically replace\ninstruction itself. With regard to this powerful role, it is not\nunusual that textbooks are a matter of regulation within\nnumerous educational policies--they are more or less tightly\ncontrolled texts. Both the ways in which textbooks are regu-\nlated and the regulated texts themselves are places where\nvarious ideologies are invested. As put by Apple and\nChristian-Smith (1991) in The Politics of the Textbook, \". . .\ntexts are not simply `delivery systems' of `facts.' They are at\nonce the results of political, economic, and cultural activi-\nties, battles and compromises\" (p. 1).\nIn this article, we will explore the analytical posssibilities\nof Grice's general cooperative principle and the maxims con-\nnected with it, mainly the maxim of quantity, maxim of qual-\nity, maxim of relation/relevance, and the maxim of manner\nfor the analysis of ideologies that are a part of different texts\nwithin the field of education. This theoretical frame will be\nused for the textual analysis of samples from two specific\ntypes of documents: a legal text of a regulation and excerpts\nfrom a textbook. The first set of examples stem from a\nSlovenian regulation on textbook approval, the second set\nfrom a history textbook. In both cases, Grice's ideas will be\nused to identify implicatures within texts that act as indices\nof underlying ideological premises.\nOur aim is to present an analysis based on Grice's ideas in\na manner that should allow for the application of those and\nsimilar principles in the everyday teacher's task of evaluat-\ning the numerous educational texts, but especially in the pro-\ncess of choosing the textbooks the pupils have to buy and use\nfor instruction.\nGrice's General Cooperative Principle\nin the following way: \"Make your conversational\n1Educational Research Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia\nCorresponding Author:\nEva Klemencic, Centre for Applied Epistemology, Educational Research\nEmail: eva.klemencic@pei.si\nAnalysis of Texts in the Field of Education:\nA Regulation on Textbook Approval and a\nHistory Textbook\nEva Klemencic1 and Mitja Cepic Vogrincic1\n Keywords\nsocial sciences, education, educational research, history and sociology of education, history, humanities, textbook analysis\n2 SAGE Open\ncontribution such as is required, at the stage at which occurs,\nby the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in\nwhich you are engaged\" (p. 26). In other words, he offered a\ngeneral principle that participants in conversation should fol-\nlow. Therefore, he introduced the term implicature.\nConversational implicature helps us so that our clauses suc-\nceed more than if they were actually \"told,\" because our ver-\nbal exchanges are, at least to some degree, a cooperative\neffort--\"every participant in their recognizing of a common\npurpose, mutually received direction etc.\" (Kante, 1998,\np. 24). Consideration maxims (and sub-maxims), represented\nin the execution, contribute to results with regard to general\ncooperative principle.1\nConversational Implicature\nThe notion of conversational implicature (shortly implica-\nture) \"is one of the single most important ideas in pragmat-\nics\": (a) stands as a paradigmatic example of the nature and\npower of pragmatic explanations of the linguistic phenom-\nena (offers some notable functional explanation of linguistic\nfacts), (b) provides some explicit account of how it is possi-\nble to mean more than what was actually said, (c) effects\nsubstantial simplification in both the structure and the con-\nIt is necessary to differentiate between explicit messages\nor explicatures (as in statements actually said) and implica-\ntures (author's implicit messages), \"which are inferentially\nreconstructed from readers,\" that is, indirectly accessible\nover operational inferences. Grice depicts the notion of\nexplicatures in terms of a speaker who \"said that, . . .,\" and\nimplicatures in terms of a speaker who \"gave me to know\"\nGrice's example:\nA and B are talking about mutual friend C, who is now working\nin a bank. A asks B how C is getting on in his job, and B replies:\n\"Oh quite well, I think; he likes his colleagues and he hasn't\nbeen to prison yet.\"\nUpon hearing that, we could ask what does B want to hint at,\nsuggest or even what did he was mean when he said that C had\nnot yet been to prison. The answer might be different but \"it is\nclear whatever B implied, suggested, meant/ . . . /it is distinct\nThe basic notion of Grice's conceptual \"apparatus\" therefore\nis implicature, which has one of two forms: conventional or\nconversational. Conventional implicatures, with simple\ninferential operations, are attached to the conventional mean-\ning of words, and they are based on a multitude of rules and\nprinciples (cooperative principle and maxims; Cepic &\nVogrincic, 2003). In the presence of single conversational\nimplicature, the listener will respond with regard to the fol-\nlowing data: conventional meaning of the words used, coop-\nerative principle and its maxims context (linguistic or\notherwise, of the utterance), background knowledge, and the\nfact that all of the relevant items under the previous headings\nMaxims\n\"/M/axims specify what participants have to do in order to\nconverse in a maximally efficient, rational, cooperative way\"\nims of conversation and, in echoing Kant, calls these catego-\nries quantity, quality, relation, and manner.2 In addition, all of\nthese categories have their analogies in a field that is not talk\nexchange.\nThe maxim of quantity. This relates to the quantity of infor-\nmation to be provided, with two sub-maxims:\n\nMake your contributions as informative as is required (for\nthe current purpose of the exchange);\n\nDo not make your contribution more informative than is\nrequired.\nThe maxim of quality.\nUnder this category falls the\nsupra-maxim:\n Try to make your contribution based on that is true.\nand two sub-maxims:\n Do not say what you believe to be false;\n Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\nThe maxim of relation. Under this category, he placed a single\nmaxim:\n Be relevant.\nThe maxim of manner. For Grice, the category of manner is\nnot related to what is said but rather (differently from other\ncategories) how what is said is to be said. Under that cate-\ngory, he includes the sub-maxim:\n Be perspicuous.\nand various maxims:\n Avoid obscurity of expression;\n Avoid ambiguity;\n Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity);\n Be orderly.\nKlemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 3\nParticipants in a verbal exchange may fail to implement a\nmaxim because of various reasons: the violation of maxims,\nIn short, obeying the cooperative principle and the\nGricean maxims is necessary to ensure that the human inter-\naction by means of linguistic exchange is based on the\nexplicit meanings of the utterances within the particular\nexchange. But the cooperative principle is not to be read as a\nhuman ideal--it is a set of presuppositions on the properties\nof utterances used to convey explicatures. Much of human\ninteraction involves breaches of Gricean maxims as it\ninvolves implicit meanings, be it intentional or unintentional.\nIn the next section, we will try to demonstrate how Grice's\nmaxims and implicatures, which are accessible over inferen-\ntial operations in the analysis of texts, can be used to get to\nthose implicit meanings. But let's first address the question,\nwhy is the textbook still so important in schools?\nTextbooks in Schools\nTextbooks among other didactical materials are an important\nelement of the school system. In many cases, they provide\nthe supporting point for arranging teacher's schoolwork and\nare, however, part of the pupil's everyday life (Barle &\nBezensek, 2006). The curriculum, its \"factual\" dimension,\nthe methods of content adaptation are in fact finalized and\nfortified with textbooks. In the process of acquiring new\nknowledge, \"textbooks/ . . . /are usually the first and the most\nimportant textual material\" for pupils (Barle & Bezensek,\nport for teachers; neither is their use mandatory nor even uni-\nform as a decision-making tool that helps deciding when and\nhow the teachers will use one or another learning device that\nremains within the domain of their autonomy (Justin, 2003).\nNormally, the choice of a particular textbook for a particular\nsubject is also within a teacher's autonomy as teachers today3\nhave the opportunity to choose from a number of different\ntextbooks on the market.\nAlthough textbook publishing in developed countries is\nmostly in the domain of market-driven publishing business,\nthis segment of book production and distribution still differs\nfrom other segments of the (book) publishing industry. The\ntextbooks for primary and secondary education--the major-\nity of school-age population today go through these seg-\nments of educational systems--are in many (but not all)\ncountries submitted to various degrees of public regulation.\nSlovenia has a system of textbook licensing, whereby a text-\nbook manuscript (in fact, it is a set workbooks complete with\nillustrations and layout) is approved for use in primary and\nsecondary schools. This does not mean that other textbooks\ncannot be used in the classroom but teachers are not allowed\nto demand the purchase or lease of unapproved textbooks\nfrom the pupils. However, there is no requirement for teach-\ners to use textbooks in the first place. The licensing system is\naccompanied with the system of book funds in schools\nthrough which pupils lease the textbooks required for a year,\nreturning them to the fund for further use. School book funds\nare not allowed to buy books that are not officially approved.\nThe school book regulation is as said not a Slovenian spe-\ncialty. We will just take a look at a few examples of large\nmarkets. The textbooks go, for example, through the approval\nprocess in neighboring Austria but also in Germany where\nevery federal state has its own regulation. Mostly, the text-\nbooks are approved by the relevant ministry. In these cases,\nthe approval procedure is aimed at the quality of textbooks,\nbut the selection process is left to the teachers. But the\napproval (or adoption) processes can also be found in the\nUnited States, where as many as 19 federal states have the\nsystem of providing free textbooks in public schools. Here,\nthe adoption process is actually the process of selecting the\ntextbook to be prescribed for the pupils. This selection pro-\ncess can be accompanied by fierce ideological debate; for\nexample, the Texas Textbook debate that revolved around the\nissue of creationism and the interpretation of history had the\nmost media coverage.4\nReturning to Slovenian example, such a system creates\nlimitations to a teacher's autonomy in textbook selection\nand, more importantly, shapes the editorial and business poli-\ncies of textbook publishers. The system of school funds\nrequires that only a single title of a textbook for a subject per\nschool should be purchased for a certain period. The duration\nof this period was not explicitly set by the regulation, but the\nsame regulation includes the provision under which the lease\nof the textbook should not exceed one third of the purchase\nprice. As school funds are for the greater part self-financed\n(partially they are subsidized by the Slovenian Ministry of\nEducation and Sport), this provision effectively means that\nthe teacher has the option to choose another textbook only\nafter a minimum period of 3 years. The one textbook per\nsubject also means that teachers who teach the same subject\nhave to negotiate which textbook to choose, thereby further\nlimiting their individual autonomy in shaping the learning\nprocess. The 3-year rotation period (or longer) also seriously\ninfluences the market conditions for publishers. As a vast\nmajority of pupils lease rather than buy textbooks, that de\nfacto means that the textbook market size is only about one\nthird of the target group and that holds only for the compul-\nsory subjects. Regarding the small size of the Slovenian pri-\nmary and secondary school textbook market, the economics\nof textbook production is tight. Still at least in the segment of\ntextbooks for compulsory curriculum in primary schools,\nseveral textbooks from different publishers are available for\nevery one of the subjects.5\nAs excerpts of the rules on approving textbooks will be a\nmatter of closer text analysis later, the procedure and its\nrequirements will be only outlined here. In short, publishers\nhave to submit a finished textbook, set in total with proofread\ntext and illustrations to a commission named by the Ministry\nof Education and Sport.6 The commission sends them for\nreviews (by outside experts) concerning linguistic adequacy\n4 SAGE Open\nand scientific accuracy and compliance of the textbook with\nthe curriculum for the relevant subjects, assessing its method-\nical and didactical approach, the quality of layout and illus-\ntrations, and suitability of the textbooks for the developmental\nstage of pupils. This part of the assessment process is carried\nout by state-run institutes working in the field of education.\nFormally, according to the regulation, the assessment pro-\ncess ends either with approval or rejection of the proposed\ntextbook; in other words, there is no formal way to amend\nthe textbook according to the comments by the reviewers\nwithin the approval process itself. In practice, however, sug-\ngestions for improvements are submitted to the publisher to\nbe implemented within the same approval procedure.7\nThe legal framework of textbook publishing provides\nsome boundaries and directions to the process of creating\ntextbook content. Within these limitations, the distinction\nbetween textbooks and other textual media concerns the spe-\ncifics of the transformation of scientific content, which is, in\na textbook, suitably structured, remodeled, and simplified.\nThe transformation is understandable under the presupposi-\ntion that pupils (for whom the textbooks are designed) are\nnot able to learn the scientific content in a no-remake form,\nas this would be first an unaccomplishable cognitive process\nand second they do not have enough previous knowledge\nnecessary to read those kinds of texts. A textbook therefore\nserves as an agent (Kovac, Sebart, Krek, Stefanc, & Vidmat,\nKuhn, who had already thought about the popularization\nof science, was convinced that scientists, as laymen, draw a\nlarge part of their own conceptions about creative scientific\nactivity from authoritarian sources (which systematically\nconceal existence and a sense of scientific revolutions). From\nthe authority point of view, he thought about three categories\nof publications: scientific textbooks, popularization, and\nphilosophical works. All of them have one common link\nwhich the scientific society presently acknowledges--the\nstarting point of their writing are problems, data, and theories\nlaid out most frequently within the particular complexity of\nsion of vocabulary and syntax of contemporary scientific\nlanguage. It is important \"that scientific concepts are made\naccessible to the students in a number of different ways,\"\nThe process of vulgarization of the scientific discourse\ninto the more generally comprehensible and didactically use-\nful textbook discourse is a necessarily ideological one. For\nour purpose, we will define ideology as\nthe basis of the social representations shared by members of a\ngroup. This means that ideologies allow people as group\nmembers to organise the multitude of social beliefs about what\nis good or bad, right or wrong, for them, and to act accordingly.\nIn the context of science vulgarization, those actions\ninclude the choice of knowledge permitted into the curricula,\nthe methods of vulgarization, the question of appropriateness\nof knowledge for certain groups (i.e., age or gender) of\npupils, and the relationship between scientific knowledge\nand other types of knowledge (i.e., beliefs be it religious or\npolitical). At the same time, we must see the textbook--as\nthe prime example of vulgarized science and accompanying\nideologies--in (at least) two different functions: the function\nof teaching and the function of learning. In the function of\nlearning (pupils learning activity), the focus is on the vulgar-\nization of scientific paradigms (meaning the transformation\nof scientific knowledge into school subjects). In the function\nof teaching, the focus is on the evaluation of the transforma-\ntion of scientific paradigms in the context of teacher's educa-\ntional practices.8\nCooperative Principle Applied\nIn our analysis, we will first take one step back in trying to\nidentify the ideological presuppositions of what a textbook is\nin the first place, by analyzing its legal definition. After that,\nexamples from history textbooks will be analyzed. In both\ncases, Grice's theory of cooperative principle will be utilized\nas a tool for discerning implied content (implicatures) that is\noften a good vantage point in finding ideological premises\nunderlying the text.\nAnalyzing the Legal Definition of a Textbook\nWe will start our analysis with the legal text, namely the\nPravilnik o potrjevanju ucbenikov [Regulation of Textbook\nApproval]--one from 1996 and the other the present one\nthen new law on primary and secondary education under\nwhich the reform of Slovenian educational system was car-\nried out. It is also the first regulation pertaining to an exclu-\nsively market-driven textbook production. We chose the\ncomparative approach to show the crucial changes in the\nperiod but also to demonstrate the ideologies accompanying\nthe textbook market regulation. We will focus on one impor-\ntant part of both regulations, namely the paragraph in which\nthe materials that are under the regulation are defined. We\ncan begin with a simple juxtaposition:\nIn accordance with this regulation the following learning\nmaterials are approved that are aimed at primary and secondary\nschool pupils, apprentices, students of post-secondary education\nand participants of adult education (further: the participants of\neducation) for the mastering of educational goals stated in\ncurricula or catalogues of knowledge:\n-textbooks,\n-worksheets or workbooks,\n-exercise compendia,\nKlemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 5\n-atlases,\n-other learning materials that complement the textbook or are its\nintegral part (further: the textbook).\nThe provisions of this regulation are also used for the approval\nof handbooks aimed at kindergarten personnel. (Regulation of\nThis regulation determines the way and procedure of the\napproval of textbooks, aimed at primary and secondary school\npupils and participants of adult education (further: the\nparticipants of education). Textbooks can be made for use in\nprinted, electronic or printed and electronic version. (Regulation\nThe textbook is a basic learning material for achievement of\neducational aims and standards of knowledge, defined in the\ncurriculum or in the catalogue of knowledge. It supports teaching\nand learning with didactic-methodical organization of content\nand adapted illustrations and graphical layout. The content and\nthe structure of the textbook allow for independent learning of\nthe participants of education and the acquisition of different\nlevels and categories of knowledge. The textbook should not\nrequire any direct insertion of answers or solutions either written\nor drawn, save in the case of the textbook, designed for the use\nin electronic form (further e-textbook), that can allow for the\ndirect insertion. The textbook is tied to the school subject or a\ntopical-didactical set, grade and the level of education. A reader\nas a compendium of texts chosen in accordance with the aims of\ncurriculum is also a textbook. (Regulation of textbook approval\u00ad\nAlready this simple juxtaposition shows important differ-\nences in the two documents. For this section whose function\nis to define the matter (textbooks) entering the approval pro-\ncedure, two strategies of definition are used. The earlier one\nis simpler with three elements. Textbooks which are approved\nare defined by (a) intended audience or in other words grade\nand level of schooling, (b) content--adhering to curricula,\nand (c) taxonomically listing the members of the category\ntextbook. The regulation of 2010 retains the first two charac-\nteristics but omits the third. This simply reflects the change\nin the textbook licensing policy. In 2010, only textbooks and\n\"readers\"10 were licensed, which means that the range of\nlearning materials controlled by the state narrowed substan-\ntially during the last two decades.\nWhat is of more interest for our purposes is the addition of\nthe fourth element, namely the attempt to define the textbook\nthrough its textual characteristics (didactical-methodical\norganization of content, illustration, layout) and even more\ncuriously through its intended effects on its users (the acqui-\nsition of different levels of knowledge, supporting teaching\nand learning). In Gricean terms, the attempt at such a defini-\ntion of the textbook represents both the violation of the\nmaxim of quantity and the maxim of manner. To begin with\nthe latter, one must first note that the attempted definition\nhardly contributes to the clarification of the specific differ-\nence between \"book\" and \"textbook,\" that is, a didactical-\nmethodical organization is a generalist term, which is already\nstrongly implied by the context (learning material for pri-\nmary and secondary schools), thus providing no further clari-\nfication. The same can be said of the requirement that\ntextbooks should support teaching and learning. In both\ncases, we could speak of unnecessary prolixity, stating the\nobvious or repeating what is already implied a few lines\nearlier.\nWhat is even more problematic is the requirement that\ntextbooks should allow for the acquisition of different levels\nor categories of knowledge. The obvious implication is that\nthere is a common understanding (at least in the context of\n[Slovenian] education) of what those \"levels\" and \"catego-\nries\" are as the regulation itself does not provide or at least\nhint at the definition of any of those terms. However, without\nexplication both can be understood in a myriad of different\nways, which de facto renders the clause unusable for the pur-\nposes of the regulation itself, namely providing relevant and,\nin the first place, equal criteria for the textbook assessment.\nThis interpretation, which applies the charity principle, pre-\nsupposing that other principles use the words in an ordinary\nway, has to give way to the interpretation more in line of\nGrice's implicatures that there is a specific meaning to these\nterms known to addressees of the regulation. In this specific\nmeaning, \"levels\" or \"categories\" of knowledge pertain to\nBloom's taxonomy of learning, which is according to Justin\ndiscourse. We will not go into the details of Bloom's taxon-\nomy or its (mis)use in Slovenian pedagogy as for the present\npurpose a more generalist critique should be sufficient.\nBloom's taxonomy (or any other attempt to categorize differ-\nent types of learning) is a specific theoretical tool that was\nnot designed for the purpose of evaluating textbooks and\ntherefore such a specific framework should not be a constitu-\ntive element of the regulation that defines the licensing of\ntextbooks in general.11 The fact that the reference to Bloom\nis not explicit constitutes the violation of Grice's maxim of\nmanner: avoid the obscurity of expression.\nAll in all, the entire attempt at defining the textbook also\namounts to the violation of the maxim of quantity. The con-\ntribution--in this case the definition--is more informative\nthan required in the context of textbook licensing regulation,\nas the criteria for the textbook assessment are clearly laid\ndown in latter paragraphs of the regulation. Trying to define\na textbook in this odd manner does not add much if anything\nat all to the information within the regulation itself.\nWhat implicature do we read from these violations of\nGrice's maxims? The attempt at closely defining the text-\nbook indicates a certain misunderstanding of the general\n6 SAGE Open\nconcept of the \"rule of law\" in present day Slovenia. It is\noften thought that most, if not every social and political\nissue, should be solved by passing a law or regulation, writ-\nten in a detailed manner, that allows those affected by the law\nto fulfill what is stated in it by simply putting checks for each\nprescribed requirement. This means that the responsibility of\nthe individual before the law is guaranteed by a largely auto-\nmated process of simple \"do's\" and \"don'ts.\" The problem is\nthat lawmakers cannot foresee all of the concrete situations,\nthat the law or regulation will be applied to, which leads to a\nnever-ending flood of amendments (also true for analyzed\nregulation). As the case of textbook definition shows, many\nthings in the social world cannot be easily defined in a sim-\nple, taxonomically correct manner suitable to legal texts. As\nwe demonstrated, attempts at such definitions easily end in a\nparadoxical mess.\nFrom these implications, it can be inferred that there is a\ntacit tendency to closely control the textbook production\nwhich has to be tacit because it opposes the idea of decentral-\nized and market-driven provision of learning materials. The\nidea of the state provision of the unified learning materials\nhas some currency in Slovenian public (and media) discourse\non education. It rests on the perception that there are too\nmany different textbooks for one subject that teachers are\nsupposedly overwhelmed by the abundance of materials\noffered and that publishers are exerting pressure on teachers\nwith aggressive marketing. These perceptions are mostly\nunfounded or lacking in perspective. On average, there are\nonly three or four different textbooks for one subject and\nthey are revised infrequently. In neighboring Austria, for\nexample, there are usually more than 10 textbooks for one\nsubject, and this is not seen as a problem. Although these\nideas are not part of the Slovenian educational mainstream,\nthey seem to have some influence that can be seen in the\nanalyzed regulation, especially in the increased level of con-\ntrol from the regulation of 1996 to the current one.\nAnalyzing a History Textbook Parts\nFurthermore, we will illustrate the violation of maxims by\nanalyzing a history textbook (Mirjani, Razpotnik, Snoj,\nVerdev, & Zuljan, 2006) for eighth grade of elementary\nschool.\nChapter:\nThe Reasons for the Rise of Liberal and\nNational Movements\nSection:\nEuropeans Fought for Freedom and Their\nIndependent State\nEthnic groups that were subordinated to others [ethnicities,\nnations op. auth] wished for a state in which they could live in\nliberty and independence. Their gaining of independence was\nlong and difficult often accompanied by war. In the course of\nindependence struggles the masses often developed strong\nemotions that led to the glorification of their own ethnicity and\nbelittling and oppression of others. This point of view is called\nnationalism. Its consequence was the support for the\nassimilation policies toward smaller ethnic groups and\nminorities, that haven't won their own state jet. (Mirjani et al.,\nThis example has several instances in which the maxim of\nmanner is violated. First, the maxims \"be orderly\" and also\n\"avoid the ambiguity of expression.\" Are we presented with\na kind of circular narrative where ethnic groups struggle for\nindependence, thereby developing nationalist prejudice\nagainst other (presumably smaller?) ethnicities within them,\nor are \"nations\" developing those notions toward ethnic\ngroups within their state, or perhaps both? It is not clear from\nthe text, who is the object or target of nationalist stance or\nemotion; object in this case is defined solely by ethnicity, and\nthat is clearly ambiguous. The possibly circular explanation\nis also not orderly as it proposes smaller and smaller divi-\nsions within ethnicities perhaps ad absurdum to the situation\nof one person's ethnicity.\nWhat is even more important in this case is the violation\nof the maxim of quantity as the contribution is not informa-\ntive enough for the context in which it occurred. In contrast\nto the explanation of other political stances, movements, ide-\nologies, or events, nationalism is not attributed to a named\nmovement, group, or individual but to the masses, whereby\nthis term is not only unclear but also degrading as \"masses\"\nare usually regarded uncultured, uneducated, and\ndangerous.\nIn this example, we see the attempt to strongly divide\nnational movements as positive political forces from nation-\nalism as a negative phenomenon. This is done implicitly as\nexplicit division would be a falsehood both in terms of politi-\ncal theory and historical fact. However, this division is in\naccordance with the myth that the Slovenian independence\nfrom Yugoslavia in the late 20th century was gained without\nnationalist ideology or excesses, in contrast to, for example,\nthe Croatian independence war or Serbian expansionism.\nParadoxically, this contrast itself is a demonstration of a\nnationalist stance. In this case, the application of Grice's\nmaxims is instrumental in uncovering hidden ideological\npresuppositions in a history textbook.\nChapter: How the revolution changed France\nSection:\nRevolutionary orders of the national constitu-\nent assembly\nThe position of the Catholic church also changed:\n\nchurch's properties were nationalized, profits from the sale\nof estates was spent on the repayment of national debt,\n\ncivil weddings and divorces were put into law, thereby\nenforcing the separation of church and state,\n\nthe borders of dioceses were rearranged in order to adhere to\nthe borders of French departments,\nKlemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 7\n Priests were assigned a state salary and they had to swear an\noath of loyalty to the state.\nThe members of the national assembly were not against religion,\nbut by passing such laws they took away the privileges of the\nchurch for the sake of the equality before law. (Mirjani et al.,\nAgain this is an example of the violation of the maxims of\nquantity and quality. To explain the position of Catholic\nChurch in post-revolutionary France, the bulleted text is\ninformative enough, especially if the relation between reli-\ngion (church) and revolution is not to be further investigated.\nIt simply enumerates the changes in the church's position as\nstated in the new constitution and laws. Still the authors\nadded another sentence whose validity cannot be easily sup-\nported. It is impossible to say whether all of the national\nassembly members were not opposed to religion, and so this\nstatement cannot be proved and it constitutes the violation of\nthe maxim of quality.\nWhat implication is uncovered by the analysis of this vio-\nlation? It seems that what has to be negotiated is a positive\nstance against both: the French revolution and the Catholic\nChurch. The fact that the revolution, in which contemporary\nWestern and also Slovenian democracy and citizen's rights\nare rooted, brought harsh or even hostile sanctions toward\nthe religious institution to which most Slovenian citizens\nbelong seems to call for an explanation that, so to say, brings\nboth on the \"same side of history.\" This happens in the con-\ntext of the recent process of Slovenian democratization, in\nwhich the Catholic Church gained the status of the defender\nof democracy and it tried to establish itself as a leading moral\nforce in the society. In this example, the fortifying of this\nideological position can be inferred.\nThis example can also be used, albeit this would require\nfurther investigation, in examining the interpretation of\nsocialist revolution in Slovenia during and after World War II\n(WWII). The fact is that the socialist revolutionary govern-\nment made laws similar to those of the French National\nAssembly 150 years earlier: nationalization of property, sep-\naration of church and state accompanied in the first years\nafter WWII with sometimes violent persecutions. It is also\ntrue that religion itself was explicitly criticized (\"opium for\nthe people\") by the governing communist party. However, it\nis also true, for example, that the state paid for the health care\nand social security of priests. Still one of the arguments in\ndenouncing socialism is its stance toward the church and\nreligion. When interpreting one revolution as positive and\nanother as negative, such similarities in revolutionary prac-\ntices need to be explained in some way and the last sentence\nof the example could be seen as an attempt at such implicit\nexplanation. We say implicit because no actual attempt at\ncomparing bourgeois and socialist revolution is made. The\npoint is that the last sentence of the example is a curious\ncontra factual addition to some factual information on French\nrevolution. As this is a textbook, where factuality is a (legal)\nrequirement, there certainly have to be very powerful rea-\nsons to include a sentence that is in its present form impos-\nsible to prove. And it seems that these powerful reasons lie\nnot in the French revolutionary but in the Slovenian contem-\nporary history.\nConclusion\nThe analysis of written text, in our case texts in the field of\neducation--one example of legal regulation another text-\nbook excerpts--by applying the Grice's conversational max-\nims is a demonstration of one method of close reading by\nwhich tacit presuppositions within the text can be identified.\nOften these presuppositions are ideological in the sense that\nthey are generalist notions instrumental in interpreting the\nsocial world. Schools are named ideological state appara-\ntuses for precisely this reason--they provide mainstream\nideological interpretations through didactically transformed\nscientific texts. What is even more unexpected is the ideol-\nogy accompanying the textbook market regulation.\nIn the first part of analysis, we analyzed the legal regula-\ntion. For that, we chose the comparative approach to show\ncrucial changes in the period and also to demonstrate ideolo-\ngies accompanying the textbook market regulation, both in\nmeaning and in reflecting the changes in textbook licensing\npolicy (using the analytical tool of Gricean maxims). The case\nof two textbook licensing regulations that were enforced in\nthe addition is an overblown definition of the textbook) and its\nimplication. Regarding that which is crucial, this reflection\ncontains the violations of some Gricean maxims, which also\nhas some other implications for school knowledge. This seems\nto be connected to one of the most problematic requirements,\nbeing that \"textbooks should allow for acquisition of different\nlevels or categories of knowledge.\" The regulation itself does\nnot provide or at least hint at the definition of any of those\nterms. However, without explication, both can be understood\nin a myriad of different ways, which de facto renders the\nclause unusable for the purposes of the regulation itself,\nnamely providing relevant and, in the first place, equal criteria\nfor textbook assessment. This interpretation, which applies the\ncharity principle, presupposing that other principles use the\nwords in an ordinary way, has to give way to the interpretation\nmore in line of Grice's implicatures that there is a specific\nmeaning to these terms known to addressees of the regulation.\nIn this specific meaning, \"levels\" or \"categories\" of knowl-\nedge pertain to Bloom's taxonomy of knowledge, which is\naccording to Justin (2008) heavily misused in Slovenian edu-\ncational discourse. Another reason is that Bloom's taxonomy\n(or any other attempt to categorize different types of learning\nand the resultant knowledge) is a specific theoretical tool that\nwas not designed for the purpose of evaluating textbooks and\ntherefore such a specific framework should not be a constitu-\ntive element of the regulation that defines the licensing of\n8 SAGE Open\ntextbooks in general. The fact that the reference to Bloom is\nnot explicit constitutes the violation of Grice's maxim of man-\nner: avoid the obscurity of expression. Also other Gricean\nmaxims are often violated, namely the maxim of quantity (in\nthe definition of textbooks). The attempt at closely defining\nthe textbook indicates a certain misunderstanding of the gen-\neral concept of the \"rule of law\" in present day Slovenia. It is\noften thought that most, if not every social and political issue,\nshould be solved by passing a law or regulation, written in a\ndetailed manner, that allows those affected by the law to fulfill\nwhat is stated in it by simply putting checks for each pre-\nscribed requirement. As the case of textbook definition shows,\nmany things in the social world cannot be easily defined in a\nsimple, taxonomically correct manner suitable to legal texts.\nAs we demonstrated, attempts at such definitions easily end in\na paradoxical mess.\nIn the second part of the analysis, we focused on illustrat-\ning the violation of maxims by analyzing a history textbook.\nIn the first example, we used the paragraph that describes the\npoint of view called nationalism. It is an example that has\nseveral instances in which the maxim of manner is violated.\nWhat is even more important in that case is the violation of\nthe maxim of quantity as the contribution is not informative\nenough for the context in which it occurred. In addition, the\nnational myth from independence is also contained. The\napplication of Grice's maxims therefore uncovers hidden\nideological presuppositions in a history textbook. The next\nexample also shows the violation of the maxim of quantity\nand quality in the area where the text explains the position of\nthe Catholic Church in post-revolutionary France, by adding\nanother sentence whose validity cannot be easily supported.\nAs the analysis revealed, the didactical transformation in the\ncase of textbook might bring about more than an explanation\nand rewording of scientific text, itself prone to introducing\nideological content. Explicit additions were spotted in the\ncases analyzed that are not based on the science transformed,\nnamely history. These additions seem to have a role of nego-\ntiating between propositions of science and (national or\nnation making) myths that obviously have to be preserved.\nThe case of two textbook licensing regulations that were\ntion (in this case, the addition is an overblown definition of\nthe textbook) and its implication.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n 1.

This situation is relatively recent in Slovenia; until the 1990s,\nthere was a single prescribed textbook for each subject in both\nprimary and secondary schools.\n4. To illustrate the extent of textbook approval mechanisms,\nwe looked at several examples: In Austria, the textbooks are\napproved by the Ministry of Education and Women--a simple\ndescription is to be found on the page of the Veritas publisher\n(http://www.veritas.at/about/schulbuch#einreichung). In the\nneighboring German state of Bavaria (as an example), the reg-\nulation is similar (the regulation on the textbook approval is at\nhttp://www.gesetze-bayern.de/jportal/portal/page/bsbayprod.p-\nsml?showdoccase=1&st=lr&doc.id=jlr-LernMZulVBY-\n2009rah-men&doc.part=X&doc.origin=bs. For a current\ndiscussion on the situation in the United States focusing on\nTexas curriculum and textbook adoption system, see Erekson\n5.

As\nthe licenses are renewed routinely, this means that teachers\nwill not be able to change the textbooks for quite some time.\nThe amendment provoked vocal protest from publishers. The\nMinistry of Education, it seems, made these changes because\nof pending curricular renewal, trying to prevent the purchase\nof books that will be used only for a year. It is expected that the\nregulation will be changed again.\n 6. The description is based on the current regulation from 2011.\nThe regulation is renewed relatively frequently every 2 or 3\nyears. Some of the changes were fairly substantial (i.e., until\n2006 publishers only had to present five typical--set--pages\nand a manuscript with the description of illustrations).\n 7. Rules on approving textbooks, Official Journal of the Republic\n 8. Despite that we must be aware that the authors of textbooks\nhave their own vision of contents and teaching methods,\nwhich should lead to a higher level of scientific thinking and\nthat the textbook alone is not a guarantee for expected results\n 9. In 2010, the Ministry of Education issued the amendment to\nthe regulation of 2006. For this purpose, the amendments of\ncited paragraphs concern the electronic versions of textbooks.\n10. \"Reader\" in the context of Slovenian primary school is a col-\nlection of (canonical) literary texts of Slovenian and world\nliterature.\n11. We should still be careful about identifying Bloom's taxonomy\nin the analyzed text. This decision is based on the numerous\nreferences to Bloom in a wide variety of texts on Slovenian\neducational system. Still as a backup, we will develop a cri-\ntique of this clause in the regulation in the manner of reductio\nad absurdum, showing that the clause is obsolete. The reason-\ning is that no text exists that would allow the acquisition of a\nKlemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 9\nsingle level or category of knowledge. On the lowest level,\nthere are words with their dictionary meanings as a type of\nknowledge to be acquired. Words combined are an example\nof another level of knowledge. Therefore, there is no text that\ndoes not have the property that defines a textbook, from which\nit follows that the property (different levels and categories of\nknowledge) is useless in defining a textbook. This reasoning\nuses an arbitrary and a common sense conception of levels\nof knowledge, but even if using Bloom's taxonomy, one can\nprove that there is no text in which only a single category\ncould be identified.\nReferences\nAhtineva, A.
