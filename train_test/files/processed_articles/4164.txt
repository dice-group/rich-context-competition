    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe main objective of this study was to investigate the refusal speech act among Omani EFL college students. It examined\nhow they refused in various situations and whether their responses were appropriate in terms of culture and accurate in\nterms of language. Forty-one English as foreign language (EFL) learners completed a Discourse Completion Test (DCT)\nconsisting of 12 scenarios by supplying written refusals to three requests, three suggestions, three invitations, and three\noffers. Students' responses were rated by two professors: one a native English speaker and the other not. A convenient\nsampling procedure was employed. The findings indicated that students' responses were largely inappropriate and inaccurate.\nFurther examination showed that they were heavily influenced by the students' culture, many being mere translations of\nrefusal responses in Omani Arabic. Others were inappropriate because they were too direct, due to students' lack of\nknowledge of the role of social status when issuing refusals to a person of high status. Language mistakes were mainly in the\nsentence structure, which affected the meaning clarity. Findings suggest that, to help students become better communicators\nin English, it is important to teach them directly the most common speech acts, especially those they might frequently use in\ntheir everyday conversations with professors and classmates.\n",

When speaking a foreign language, the issue\nof culture becomes critical. English as Foreign language\n(EFL) learners, especially those with languages different and\ndistant from English psychologically, culturally, phonologi-\ncally, and syntactically, may struggle when attempting to\ncommunicate in English. Non-proficient language learners\nare not only jeopardized by their imperfect language knowl-\nedge but obstructed by their inadequate knowledge of culture.\nTo compensate for their lack of knowledge, EFL learners may\nfall back on their own linguistic cultural reservoir, translating\nutterances from their mother tongue and applying their own\ncultural rules when communicating in English (Al-Eryani,\ncould result in misunderstanding and embarrassment or\n2011). Hence, it is essential to integrate pragmatics in the\nteaching and learning of a foreign language. To avoid break-\ndowns in communication, it is important to explore how\nculture and linguistic background can affect one's utterances\nor speech acts to raise student and instructor awareness of this\nand help them address it appropriately. This is especially\nimportant nowadays as \"cross-cultural communication is\nbecoming an integral part of life, with globalization and rapid\ntion, employment opportunities in the local and global market\nincreasingly demand good language proficiency and commu-\nnicative ability. Therefore, teaching pragmatic rules in a way\nthat they would involve communication strategies and speech\nacts will give students the English knowledge and communi-\ncative competence that will secure good job placements after\ngraduation.\nThe present study aimed to explore how well Omani col-\nlege English language learners communicate in English and\nwhat factors could have influenced them.

The scenarios were organized in a way that\nwould involve interlocutors of differing social status: high (a\nboss, for example), same (friend or colleague), and low (an\nemployee or a housekeeper). The study examined whether\nthe responses were appropriate pragmatically and accurate\nlinguistically and the factors that could have influenced\nthem.\nLiterature Review: Speech Acts\nThe intimate connection between language and culture is\nclearly reflected in people's everyday language use as it por-\ntrays different functions or speech acts. For this reason,\nstudying speech acts has been the focus of much recent\nresearch. It is well known in sociolinguistics that Austin\nof speech act theory. They maintained that speech acts are\nmeaningful forms of behavior regulated by rules. Hence, a\nspeech act is an utterance carrying a language function that is\nbased on performance not on description (Baleghizadeh,\n2007). To put it more succinctly, a speech act is an action\nutterance usually carries an attitude, and this attitude corre-\nsponds to the speech act being performed (Bach, n.d.). The\nlistener's understanding of the attitude leads to understand-\ning the speech act.\nStudying speech acts is similar to studying sentence mean-\nings, because sentences can express speech acts (Searle, 2001).\nSpeech acts are either direct or indirect, and people usually use\nindirectness either to show more politeness (Bruti, 2006) or to\nmake their speech more interesting (Justov\u00e0, 2006). This must\nbe clear to the hearer, who needs to understand the message to\nFor a speech act to be culturally appropriate, knowledge of\nthe spoken language's culture is crucial (Umale, 2011). This\nis an important aspect of communicative competence and\nspeakers of a given language need to know how to perform\nspeech acts to function appropriately. Although speech acts\nare universal in themselves, different cultures express them\ncultural factors have an important impact on their frequency,\ndistribution, and functions. According to Al-Khateeb (2009),\n\"cultural factors play a role in the development of diverse\nways of talking and communicating\" (p. 20).\nExamples of speech acts include requesting, offering,\napologizing, complimenting, congratulating, sympathizing,\nand refusing, all of which are language-based actions.\nBecause this article focuses on refusals as produced by\nOmani EFL college students, the following section reviews\nthe literature on this particular speech act.\nRefusal as a Speech Act\nRefusal is a \"face-threatening act that tends to disrupt har-\nsensitivity, a refusal can be perceived differently between\nspeaker and listener. It is a negative response to another speech\nact issued in the form of a request, invitation, or suggestion\n(Abdul Sattar, Che Lah, & Suleiman, 2011). Due to their\nnature, refusals can affect people's relationships adversely if\nperceived as impolite or uncaring.According to Umale (2011),\nrefusals may damage the positive face of the speaker and\nthreaten the negative face of the listener. Therefore, the author\ncontinues to \"mitigate threats to face\" caused by refusals,\nspeakers can use politeness strategies (p. 19).\nseveral social factors may affect refusal strategies, such as\ngender, age, setting, topic, educational level, status, and\ninterlocutors. Social status and social distance between inter-\nlocutors are major factors and thus figure quite frequently in\nstudies focusing on refusal. They affect the directness or\nindirectness of refusals. Of course the direct way of refusing\nan invitation is simply to say \"no,\" \"I can't,\" \"I will not,\" or\n\"I don't think I can\" (Abed, 2011). Beebe, Takahashi, and\nUliss-Weltz (1990) found that, when speaking with people\nfrom the same social status, U.S. native speakers of English\nused indirect refusal while native speakers of Japanese used\nindirect refusals with people of higher status and direct refus-\nals with people of a lower status. In Malaysia, Malays were\nfound to avoid the use of direct refusals with people of higher\nstatus, but use the direct \"no\" when refusing people of equal\nor the same status (Abdul Sattar et al., 2011). As for gender,\nit was found that although males use more direct refusals\nthan females, refusal strategies based on gender are usually\nnot apparent in other areas (Abed, 2011; Soepriatmadji,\nboth Egyptian and U.S. males and females use direct refus-\nals, but Egyptian men tend to be more direct than U.S. males\nand females of both countries.\nIndirect refusal strategies include, among other things,\nshowing regret, giving excuses, making suggestions, and\npromising later acceptance (Abed, 2011). According to\nAl-Kahtani (2005), U.S. native speakers of English tend to\nuse regret when refusing people from a higher or equal status\nmore often than giving excuses, while Saudis and Japanese\nuse more explanations and give more excuses. Arabs and\nJapanese also show gratitude when refusing an invitation or\nrequest. Tanck (2004) confirms that native speakers of\nEnglish use regret followed by an excuse. Malaysians, how-\never, tend to use the regret strategy when refusing in all situ-\nations, regardless of social status.\nAs for speakers of English as a foreign or second lan-\nguage, refusal strategies have been found to be influenced by\nthe culture of their native language (Al-Eryani, 2007; Lauper,\n1997). Lauper found that Spanish English speakers' use of\nrefusal strategies was similar in both English and Spanish\nand that these differed from English speakers' strategies.\nYemeni English language learners' refusal strategies were\nnot as direct as Americans', and they often offered reasons\nfor the refusal. Moreover, Yemeni learners' refusals showed,\nAl-Mahrooqi and Al-Aghbari 3\nin addition to linguistic competence in English, evidence of\nnative culture influence (Al-Eryani, 2007).\nEnglish speakers from Ghana were found to use excuses\noften when refusing familiar or unfamiliar people because it is\nimpolite in Ghanaian culture to refuse without offering an\nexcuse (Safro, 2011). Safro also indicated that people in close\nrelationships sometimes refuse by asking clarification questions\nor repeating the request or suggestion. However, Delin and\nTavil (2010) found that Turkish learners of English use direct\nrefusals with close relatives and friends but indirect ways with\ndistant relationships. Their main indirect refusal strategies were\ngiving excuses, showing regret, or showing regret followed by a\nstatement about future or past acceptance.\nAs seen above, culture can have a salient effect on students'\ncommunication skills and their use of various speech acts. If\ncultural transfer takes place, then miscommunication or a break-\ndown in communication can take place. Because the main\nobjective of learning English as a foreign language is to com-\nmunicate with people with whom students do not share a mother\ntongue, it is essential that they master the art of communicating\nappropriately and accurately while observing English's prag-\nmatic and linguistic rules. This study attempts to examine the\nways in which Omani EFLcollege students expressed refusal in\nvarious situations and whether these were appropriate in terms\nof culture and accurate in terms of language.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe population of the study came from the Department of\nEnglish in a higher education institution in Oman. The study\nemployed a convenient sampling procedure. It was adminis-\nmales and 19 females) agreed to participate after being\ninformed in class of the study's objectives and of the voluntary\nnature of participation. Participants majored in English and\nbelonged to three different departments: Education, English\nArts, and Translation. Being in the second, third, fourth, and\nfifth years of their programs, their English levels ranged from\nlow-intermediate to high-intermediate based on their linguistic\nperformance in a reading test. The reading test was used with\nother groups of students from previous years, and it proved to\nbe a good measure of their linguistic competence. The authors\ndecided on the validity and reliability of the instrument used by\nhaving a panel of researchers checking it and then piloting it in\none of the reading classes. The authors then counted the\nresponses of all the participants to the test as offered below and\nexamined them according to their linguistic accuracy and prag-\nmatic appropriacy.\nMaterial and Procedure\nADiscourse Completion Test (DCT) was administered to par-\nticipants. It consisted of 12 scenarios requiring participants to\nsupply a written refusal to three requests, three suggestions,\nthree invitations, and three offers. Each of the three scenarios\nin each group sought a refusal to a person of a different status.\nThe first required a refusal to an equal status person, the sec-\nond to a higher status person, and the third to a lower status\nperson. The DCT was designed by the researchers and based\nappendix details the scenarios that participants were pre-\nsented with.\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed by describing the refusal strategies\nemployed and checking their linguistic accuracy and prag-\nmatic appropriateness. The authors also explored how sensi-\ntive learners were to the role of social status in issuing\nrefusals and listed pragma-linguistic errors characterizing\nthe collected refusals.\nThe refusals were rated by two professors in the\nDepartment of English at Sultan Qaboos University--native\nand non-native speakers of English--who judged the\nresponses based on accuracy and appropriateness. In some\ncases, the professors reacted to the responses by stating why\nthey sounded inappropriate. A non-native speaker rater was\nemployed for two reasons: (a) to be able to clearly see\nwhether the Arabic culture influences responses especially\nwhen the non-native rater placed a check mark besides a\npragmatically inappropriate response and (b) to cross check\nthe ratings of both professors.\nAccording to Umale (2011), arriving at a correct refusal\nstrategy entails either a statement of reason (e.g., \"I cannot\ncome because I have to take my wife to the hospital\") or\nregret (e.g., \"I am sorry\"). Therefore, the responses given by\nEFL learners were divided into two idea units and were\nassigned a value of either 1 for a reason or 2 for regret.\nUmale (2011), the refusals in this study were also described\naccording to the categories presented in Table 1. It is impor-\ntant to note that the expressions supplied in the table repre-\nsent real refusals taken from our data.\nThe analysis addressed the following issues:\n1. Types of strategies used by EFL learners to refuse:\ndirect/indirect.\n2. How the learners addressed refusals to interlocutors\nof distinct social status.\n3. Pragma-linguistic failure: length and content.\n4. Native speakers' ratings of response accuracy.\nResults\nTypes of Strategies Used in Refusals\nAs stated earlier, the researchers observed that two types of\nstrategies were used in the refusals produced by the Omani\n4 SAGE Open\nlearners: direct and indirect. We address direct responses first\nand then move to the indirect strategies employed.\nDirect strategies.Because the study explored refusals in\nrequests, offers, suggestions, and invitations, responses var-\nied in terms of being direct or indirect across the four groups.\nResults suggest that Omani EFL learners use more direct\nrefusals of requests with people of low status because 23\n(56%) direct refusals surfaced when an employee asked his\nboss to leave work early. Examples of direct refusals include\n\"No, don't go now. I will let you leave the office early today,\"\n\"No, you have to finish your job, then deal with your per-\nsonal issues,\" and \"I cannot! We have some work to do.\"\nThere were nine (22%) direct refusals to a person of equal or\nhigher status. This paralleled the direct refusals to an offer\nmade by a person of higher status. Refusals that surfaced\nwith people of equal and higher status included \"No, I don't\nhave money. Actually, I invite you, feed you to give me 500\nRO [Omani Rials] for this month\" and \"I cannot, my boss!\nThis weekend, I must play much [play a match] and be with\nmy parents at home.\"1\nIn invitations, six (15%) direct refusals appeared with\nfriends (e.g., \"No, I don't like magic shows. I don't like to go\noutside my house\" and \"I cannot go tonight. Maybe next\ntime\"). Six learners directly refused invitations from friends,\nwhile only three directly refused invitations made by a per-\nson of higher or lower status. Examples of these include \"No,\nno, I am sorry. Please accept my apologies. I have other\nissues\" (addressed to a boss) and \"Actually, I cannot come\nbecause I have planned something to do,\" which was a\nresponse given to an employee who invited their boss for\ntheir daughter's birthday.\nOffers, as kind social gestures, are special speech acts that\ndemand careful responses. Direct refusals may break up rela-\ntions. They may also be considered as negative, impolite, and\nabrupt. The researchers observed that learners were quite\ninsensitive to the status of the person who made the offer.\nThey used 22 (54%) direct refusals with a higher status per-\nson (e.g., \"No, my old beautiful car; that is impossible. Thank\nyou for the offer\" and \"Not my old car. It is very very pre-\ncious. I can't let it go. It is a treasure for me\"). Eight (20%)\ndirect refusals were given to the same status and six (15%) to\nlow status people.\nLearners sounded abrupt, rude, and/or extremely negative\ntoward refusals that interfered with their life or future. They\n(49%) with friends. Examples of the direct refusals included\n\"No, Sir! My future is to become a scientist rather than a\nfootball player,\" \"No, I cannot! It is not a career in our societ-\nies. It is just a hobby\" (both heard in a response to a careers\ncounselor suggesting a football career), and \"No, I am fine! I\ncan handle the situation. There is no need to go to Malaysia.\"\nAlthough learners sounded careful when refusing sugges-\ntions made by a higher status person, we suspect that the sce-\nnario affected the responses to a large extent.\nTable 2 illustrates the number and percentage of direct\nrefusals along with the status of the person to whom the\nrefusal was issued:\nAlthough Umale (2011) argued that \"Omanis used the\nhighest number of direct strategies in refusing requests and\noffers\" (p. 26), this study found that Omani learners used\ndirect refusals with offers and suggestions. The highest num-\nber of direct refusals surfaced in answers to a low status\nperson.\nIndirect strategies. Participants were also observed to refuse\nrequests, offers, invitations, and suggestions indirectly. This\nhappened when they regretted acceptance, gave reasons,\nshowed consideration for the interlocutor's feelings, pre-\nsented a philosophical view, wished they were able to fulfill\nthe request, and gave promises of future acceptance. In some\ncases, two of the above strategies were used simultaneously,\nbut with a variation in the order they came in.\nThe researchers observed that Omani learners tended to\nson with a higher status (e.g., \"Unfortunately, I am sorry. I\ndon't have this amount of money\" and \"Sorry, you cannot\nbecause we have a lot of works needed to be done today\").\nThey tended to use the word \"wish\" when refusing requests\nfor money, as in \"I wish I could give you, but I seriously\ndon't have more than I need.\" In the collected responses,\nTable 1. Refusal Categories.\nType of refusal Code Strategy Expression\nDirect 0 Direct No, I cannot, and I refuse\nIndirect 1 Reason I have an exam tomorrow\n2 Regret I am sorry\n3 Consideration of interlocutor's feelings Thank you, I appreciate your . . . and It is an honor\n4 Exemption of the interlocutor from any responsibility You didn't mean it anyway\n5 Wish I wish I were free\n6 Promises of future acceptance Maybe later\n7 Statement of philosophy I never lend money to anyone\nAl-Mahrooqi and Al-Aghbari 5\nsix (5%) learners showed solidarity with and consideration\nfor the feelings of a requestor of the same or higher status.\nHowever, none gave any promises for future help with\nmoney. Ten (8%) responses involving reason and consider-\nation for the interlocutor's feelings were given to a person\nof the same or higher status (e.g., \"Sir, I have to go some-\nwhere that time. I can come next weekend if you want\"). In\ncontrast to responses to a same status person, only one (1%)\nwish was given to a person of higher status. The researchers\nobserved that with a person of low status, learners neither\nshowed any consideration for the interlocutor's feelings nor\nexpressed wishes for, or promises of, future acceptance.\nThe majority of responses were direct refusals or regrets.\nRespondents sometimes also used a variety of reasons to\nreject requests, such as \"I have lots of tasks assigned for\nyou. I cannot let you go.\" One philosophical statement in\nresponse to a request made by a person of low status was\n\"work is work!\"\nBecause invitations are kind gestures that bring people\ntogether, learners were observed to be extremely polite when\nrefusing them. The majority of responses (46 or 37%) showed\nconsideration for the inviter's feelings, regardless of the sta-\ntus of the person involved. And 20 (16%) responses showed\nconsiderations for, and appreciations of, kind invitations\ngiven to a higher and lower status person. Examples included\n\"I would be glad to come,\" \"I appreciate your invitation,\" \"It\nis an honor, but I have been already invited to have lunch\nwith one of my friends,\" and \"Oh what a nice thing!\"\nHowever, the researchers observed that, with friends, learn-\ners tended to use more regrets, such as \"I am sorry, but I\nreally don't feel like it.\" One response involved a philosophi-\ncal statement made in response to an invitation from an\nemployee--\"I don't think it would be appropriate if I\nattended your daughter's birthday party.\" Moreover, a total\nof eight (7%) wishes were made in response to these\ninvitations.\nOffers are other types of acts that help solidify relations\nbecause the person who offers help, money, or anything in\nthis way shows kindness. Similarly, the responses given to\noffers varied greatly. When the housemaid spoiled a new\nshirt while ironing, learners responded with \"Don't worry\nbecause I have many other shirts\" and \"Oh it is ok I have\nothers and I don't need it.\" They used 36 (29%) responses\nshowing consideration for the interlocutor's feelings with a\nhigher status person (e.g., \"Thank you but I don't want to sell\nmy car,\" and \"Thank you. There is no need to do that\").\nSuggestions can be regarded as intruding statements. A\nperson suggesting a particular matter can be taken as inter-\nfering with the interlocutor's business. Repetition, a new\ntechnique to refuse a suggestion, was introduced in refusing\nsuggestions (e.g., \"Malaysia!!! I heard about it. It is a good\nidea to go there but not now because we are in the beginning\nof the semester\"). One notable difference in responses was\nthe huge number of philosophical responses (n = 12, or 10%)\nproduced to suggestions, such as \"Soccer does not buy you a\ngreat life but science will\".\nEFL learners used a variety of strategies to refuse.\nHowever, we observed that they used regret more when\nresponding to requests, and they showed consideration for\nthe interlocutor's feelings when refusing offers.\nThe role of status. One of the objectives of this study was to\nexplore whether Omani EFL learners were aware of the\nsocial status of their interlocutor when issuing refusals to\nrequests, offers, invitations, and suggestions. Although the\noverall figures for direct refusals show sensitivity toward the\nstatus of the interlocutor, the researchers were rather con-\ncerned about the high number of direct refusals produced in\noffers where high status people were concerned. In fact,\nmany responses were more negative, abrupt, and rude than\nthe literature would suggest.\nHowever, the current study lends some support to Umale's\n(2001) finding that \"Omanis use more caution and care in\ndealing with people of higher status\" (p. 28). We observed\nthat we had substantial figures for \"consideration of the\ninterlocutor's feelings\" across the four groups. In a number\nof responses, the learners revealed no difference in respond-\ning to a friend or a person of a low status.\nTable 2. Number and Percentage of Direct Refusals and Status of the Person to Whom the Refusal Was Issued.\nDirect Same status High status Low status\n (request for money) (request for help) (request to leave work early)\n (invitation for dinner and magic show\nby a friend)\n(invitation for lunch at a boss') (invitation for an employee's daughter's\nbirthday)\n (offer made by a friend to meet your\nson's principal)\n(offer made by a manager to sell your\nold car)\n(offer made by a domestic helper to\nreplace your spoiled shirt)\n (suggestion by a friend to go to\nMalaysia)\n(suggestion by a counselor to take up a\nfootball career)\n(suggestion by a housekeeper to take\na taxi)\naThe percentages are calculated by dividing the total number of direct responses by the total number of responses (i.e., 123 responses).\n6 SAGE Open\nPragma-linguistic failure. Culture plays a crucial role in deter-\nmining expected refusals produced by Omani EFL learners to\nrequests, offers, invitations, and suggestions. The researchers\nobserved that a large number of respondents transferred their\nArabic speech habits into English. In Arabic, people tend to\ngive elaborate and detailed refusals so that the feelings of the\ninterlocutor are not hurt--for example, \"I am sorry. I can't let\nyou go before you finish your work (Table 3). However, if\nyou are in a hurry, at least finish the urgent tasks that I've\ngiven you.\" However, this may not work with English speak-\ning cultures, which often demand directness and clear\nresponses. Moreover, a lengthy response such as the one\nabove might well result in pragma-linguistic failure.\nOmanis are sometimes described as being overly friendly\n(Umale, 2001). Therefore, when refusing invitations, offers,\nand suggestions, they might sound \"obsequious\" (to use\nUmale's term); they use many introductory statements before\nthey state their refusal (e.g., \"I appreciate your invitation, but\nI am sorry I really can't come. Wish your daughter a happy\nbirthday\"). In a number of cases, a reason for refusing the\noffer or invitation is given.\nThe study suggests that Omani EFL learners use a variety\nof refusal strategies. In many cases, two strategies are often\nused together (i.e., regret followed by reason, consideration\nof the interlocutor's feelings followed by reason, a wish fol-\nlowed by a reason). Umale (2001) argued that this semantic\nformula is very prevalent in Arabic. Omanis using Arabic are\nlikely to express regret or consideration for the interlocutor's\nfeelings followed by reasons for a refusal (e.g., \"Thanks dear\nbut I hope to excuse me because I have an appointment with\nmy love,\" \"That is a good idea but I like to keep the old\nthings because they are very precious,\" and \"Sorry dear, my\nmother does not feel good, I need to stay at home to take care\nof her. Again sorry\"). This formula is quite common in the\nresponses EFL learners used as refusals in the present study.\nMoreover, many also expressed a wish then refused the offer\nor invitation. For example, one learner responded with \"I\nwould be glad to attend, but I am really busy at this time.\"\nAccording to Umale, native English speakers tend to express\nregret and give reasons. They rarely show consideration for\nthe interlocutor's feelings or express a wish, which means\nthat the EFL learners featured here transferred their Omani\ncultural norms and acts of speech to express refusals in\nEnglish. This transfer might result in pragma-linguistic fail-\nure and may hinder smooth communication with native\nspeakers of English.\nTable 3. Examples of Indirect Strategies Used by the Respondents.\nRegret Reason\nConsideration\nof interlocutor's\nfeelings Philosophy\nPromises of\nlater approval Wish\nLet the\ninterlocutor\noff the hook Repetition\nRequests/status \nInvitations/status \nOffers/status \nSuggestions/status \naThis represents the percentages of the total number of each strategy versus the total number of all the responses received, which equals 123 (41\nstudents \u00d7 3).\nAl-Mahrooqi and Al-Aghbari 7\nNative and non-native speaker's ratings of responses. The refus-\nals given by EFL learners were rated by native and non-\nnative speakers of English who were asked to judge the\nresponses based on two criteria: accuracy of language and\nappropriateness to English speaking culture(s). They were\nasked to place a check or cross in the cell indicating their\nchoice (accurate vs. inaccurate; appropriate vs. inappropri-\nate) and supply a comment. It was noted that the raters failed\nto comment on all the responses given. Table 4 illustrates the\nnumber of responses in terms of accuracy and appropriate-\nness, as judged by the two speakers. It is important to note\nthat there are about 129 refusals in each of the four types.\nTable 4 reveals that the non-native speaker of English\nconsidered many EFL learners' responses to be inaccurate.\nThis may suggest low proficiency in English on the part of\nEFL learners. Many faulty statements involving grammati-\ncal and structural errors were produced (e.g., \"No, no. I will\nbut another ones. That's fine,\" \"That's kind of you but I have\nlots of work to so I am sorry,\" and \"No, I don't want I have\nno time\"). However, the native speaker rater marked the\nmajority of refusals as grammatically accurate. The research-\ners observed that the native speaker rater generally focused\nmore on what could be accepted as \"spoken\" language in\nterms of conveying the meaning rather than as \"written\"\nresponses, which were full of mistakes in tenses, punctua-\ntion, conjunctions, and structures. For example, a refusal\nsuch as \"Sorry, I cannot. Also, I have my own responsibili-\nties and duties\" was considered to be accurate by the native\nspeaker despite having an inappropriate conjunction in the\nstatement. We also observed that the native speaker over-\nlooked the fact that these responses included many repeti-\ntions and faulty prepositions and punctuations such as \"Oh!\nI am sort, this weekend I am going to my homeland\" and \"I\nwould if I could but I can't because I will be busy up to my\nnose during the weekend.\"\nIn terms of appropriateness, the non-native speaker judged\nmany responses as informal with no positive feeling (e.g.,\n\"Sorry my boss, I've already planned to do something in the\nweekend\"), too direct/negative (e.g., \"Sorry my friend, I\ncan't lend you because I have a lot of responsibilities\"),\nabrupt/odd (e.g., \"No, I don't have money. Actually, I invite\nyou, feed you in order to give me 500 OR for this month\"),\nand repetitive, as in \"I really really understand your problem,\nbut unfortunately I don't have that amount.\" In terms of\nappropriateness, the researchers observed that the non-native\nspeaker of English, similar to the Arab respondents, was\ninfluenced by Arabic norms and speech acts when rating\nresponses. He viewed statements that considered the inter-\nlocutor's feelings and those that expressed regret to be appro-\npriate. For instance, he passed statements such as \"I would\nreally like to help you, but I have other commitments during\nthe weekend, and I would like be very busy,\" and \"You know\nthat I would love to help you, but I am busy in this weekend.\"\nStatements that expressed direct refusal or listed a reason\nwere considered inappropriate by the non-native speaker.\nThe native speaker of English marked fewer statements as\ninappropriate, revealing moderate competency on the part of\nEFL learners with regard to pragma-linguistic competence.\nShe considered direct refusals such as \"No, I can't because I\ndon't have that amount of money,\" to be too brusque; \"Am\nsorry I can't. I have other plans and I can't ruin them,\" to be\noffensive; and \"Sorry but I am very busy,\" to be curt.\nDiscrepancies, though strikingly salient, can be attributed\nto two facts: (a) the native speaker has lived long enough in\nOman to know that Omanis are generally too friendly to\nexpress direct refusals. Thus, she accepted responses express-\ning regret, reason and consideration of an interlocutor's feel-\nings and overlooked status in many scenarios and (b) the\nnative speakers' focus was observed to be more on the mes-\nsage expressed by the refusal.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOmani EFL learners used a variety of pragma-linguistic strate-\ngies to address refusals across the four different situations\n(requests, invitations, offers, and suggestions). To illustrate, it\nwas observed that Omani EFL learners used a few direct refus-\nals. However, they used a large number of indirect refusals,\nwhich express reason, regret, wish, and other indirect strategies.\nThe highest number of direct refusals was found in refusing\nrequests and suggestions. While requests are often hard to fulfill,\nsuggestions may sound like intrusion into others' business.\nHence, requests and suggestions received some negative, abrupt,\nand curt refusals. It was surprising to the researchers to find that\nTable 4. Native Versus Non-Native Ratings.\nType/speaker\nNative's ratings Non-native's ratings\nAccuracy Appropriateness Accuracy Appropriateness\naThis represents the percentages of the total numbers of ratings in each column versus the total number of ratings made by the raters, which equal 429.\n8 SAGE Open\nOmani EFL learners used direct refusals with people who are\nhigher in status than themselves. These may potentially cause a\nthreat to \"face\" when used with a boss or when negotiating a\nbusiness deal. Direct instruction on the importance of social sta-\ntus when addressing refusals in English might increase aware-\nness about accuracy and fluency related to refusals in English.\nMost likely, EFLlearners'Arabic cultures played a crucial role\nin influencing the refusal strategies used. Many of these strategies\nresult in mere transfer of L1 speech norms to L2, causing mis-\ncommunication, misunderstanding, and offense. Normally, peo-\nple ensure that they maintain face inAsian cultures, avoid putting\ninterlocutors into embarrassing predicaments, and respond\npolitely to friends and people of a lower status. Omani EFLlearn-\ners greatly impinged on social status when they use direct refusals\nto an offer made by a person of a higher status. This warrants\nexamination of other factors that may result in blunt and harsh\nrefusals such as the low key and high key content of the message\n(Hall,1976).Thisisespeciallyimportantbecausethetypeofoffer\ncan cause anger, frustration, or interference with one's business.\nThere were apparently large differences in the ratings of\naccuracy and appropriateness by the native and non-native\nspeaker raters. The researchers observed that the native speaker\nrater considered the majority of the learners' responses to be\ngrammatically and pragmatically acceptable. As pointed out\nearlier, these responses may sound acceptable when spoken but\nnot written. To illustrate, a response that drops the third person\nsingular s may not hinder understanding; however, it is cer-\ntainly ungrammatical. The native speaker considered this to be\nfine. However, the non-native speaker, who had received for-\nmal instruction on the English language, was more meticulous\nin judging the accuracy of these written responses. Responses\nlacking the third person singular s, and those using wrong verb\ntenses or those with misplaced prepositions and punctuation\nwere marked wrong by the non-native speaker. The differences\nbetween the native and non-native are due to differences in\ntheir level of tolerance for errors, their training, teaching expe-\nriences, and their linguistic orientations. We were expecting a\ndifference, but the degree of difference was not anticipated.\nAlthough this study provided a number of emergent under-\nstandings in an area that is largely under-researched in the\nOmani context, it had a number of limitations that should be\nacknowledged. First, the collected refusals were written\nresponses and not natural reactions. It is very important to note\nthat respondents are likely to have given different refusals\nwhen facing real situations. Second, the study did not inter-\nview the raters to collect more data or check why responses\nwere judged in the way they were. We believe that the raters'\nexplanations may have differed from those we have provided,\nwhich could have revealed the actual reasons behind the high\npercentage of accurate and appropriate responses rated by the\nnative speaker compared with the non-native speaker's rat-\nings. However, despite these concerns, the current study does\nsuggest that EFL learners make serious pragmatic errors in\nissuing refusals. Moreover, it maintains that the refusals they\nuse are not sensitive to the social status of the interlocutors.\nAppendix\nA.
