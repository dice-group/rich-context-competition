Elo 4\n Introduction\nA well established pattern in the demographic, sociological, and epidemiological litera-\nture is that people with high education, high income, and high status occupations expe-\nrience lower risks of death than do individuals from lower socioeconomic strata. This\ninverse relationship has been extensively documented for many industrialized countries\nbody of literature has also examined whether inequalities by socioeconomic status (SES)\nare uniform and to what extent they vary among countries (e.g., Valkonen 1989; Kunst\nrevealed considerable variation in the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in mor-\ntality among developed countries, with inverse gradients typically larger for men than for\nerable theoretical and health-policy relevance of comparative research, the evidence thus\nfar has been based mostly on Western European countries and the United States. East-\nern European countries have had limited representation in this comparative work with\nthe exception of Estonia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Russia, and recently, Lithuania\nin mortality in both relative and absolute terms also exist in the former socialist countries\nof Central and Eastern Europe, and these differentials appear to be even larger than are\nthose observed in Western Europe and other industrialized countries (Hajdu et al. 1995;\nIn this paper, we contribute to the comparative research on educational inequalities in\nmortality in several ways. We focus our analysis on post-transition mortality in Bulgaria,\nan Eastern European country whose SES mortality and morbidity disparities have not\npreviously been investigated in comparative studies. We set the Bulgarian experience\nin an international perspective by comparing it to that of Finland and the United States,\ncountries included in previous international comparisons (e.g., Kunst and Mackenbach\net al. 2005). The three countries differ on many salient dimensions relevant to health\nand mortality. Finland represents a northern European country with a large sex difference\nin both overall mortality and the education-mortality gradient. High male mortality in\nFinland has been attributed in part to high levels of alcohol abuse, a pattern also common\net al. 2004). At the same time, Finland has universal health insurance coverage and a\nlow level of income inequality, which sets it apart from post-transition countries such\n2012 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nas Bulgaria. The United States in turn is characterized by large income inequality. In\naddition, the country lacks a uniform national health insurance policy, with the result\nthat many working-age adults have no or only limited health insurance coverage, while\nthe elderly are covered by the national Medicare program (DeNavas-Walt et al. 2004).\nThis large income inequality and unequal health-care coverage is also found in eastern\nEuropean countries in transition, including Bulgaria. Given these contextual differences\nand similarities, a comparison of the three countries provides insights regarding the extent\nto which national differences in social, economic and health care policies may contribute\nto SES inequalities in mortality.\nA specific aim of the present study is to quantify educational differentials in Bulgar-\nian mortality in the 1990s and to place them in an international perspective. We further\nadd an additional - much less often studied - perspective by including marital status and\nexamining whether marital status and educational attainment interact in their association\nwith mortality. Numerous studies have shown marital status to be closely associated with\nmortality, with the association typically stronger for men than for women (e.g., Hu and\nGoldman 1990; Valkonen et al. 2004). Evidence also suggests that mortality differentials\nby marital status are large in comparison with other socioeconomic characteristics (e.g.,\nMartikainen et al. 2005). We hypothesize that the association between education and\nmortality also depends on the marital status of individuals. For instance, Smith and Wait-\nzman (1994) found that individual-level poverty status interacted with marital status in the\nUnited States in the early 1980s such that poor, unmarried men between ages 25 and 64\nwere at highest risk of death. We examine whether a similar pattern also holds true in the\n1990s in different social and economic contexts. We expect that education-marital status\ninteractions will be most pronounced in Bulgaria, which was undergoing rapid economic\nand social transformations during the period under investigation. During this transition\nindividuals with low levels of schooling were particularly disadvantaged. We hypothesize\nthat the economic and psychosocial support from a spouse may have helped mitigate the\nnegative consequences of severe economic hardship for underprivileged individuals.\nWe translate educational and marital status differentials in mortality into life-table\nmeasures that facilitate a straightforward comparison of the association of education and\nmarital status with survival. We examine both relative differentials, which demonstrate\nhow unequally the risk of death is distributed among social groups (Kunst et al. 2004), and\nabsolute differences in survival, which reflect \"more directly the public health significance\nWe utilize individual-level data sets obtained from linkages between vital statistics\nrecords and censuses in Finland and Bulgaria and nationally representative survey data in\nthe United States. Consequently, our data are not subject to the numerator/denominator\nbias present in some comparative studies that use dual data sources to estimate mortality\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2013\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\n(for a discussion of this type of bias see for example Kunst et al. 2004; Shkolnikov et al.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss\nrelevant differences among the three countries and our choice of education and marital\nstatus as explanatory variables. Next, we describe our data and analytic strategy. We then\nreport our findings, and we end with a discussion of our main findings.\n2. Background\n2.1 Choice of countries\nOur discussion of educational and marital status inequalities in Bulgarian mortality dur-\ning the 1990s is set in the context of Finland and the United States, two Western countries\nal. 2006). The three countries are characterized by considerable divergence in histori-\ncal mortality trends, especially since the 1950s, as well as substantial socioeconomic and\npolitical differences during the 20th century. During the first half of the 20th century,\nthe three countries underwent very similar demographic developments, namely large im-\nprovements in life expectancy for both sexes resulting primarily from steep declines in\ninfectious diseases and infant mortality. By the beginning of the 1960s, life expectancy\nat birth was highest among Bulgarian men (67.47 years), followed by U.S. men (66.63\nyears) and Finnish men (65.40 years). In contrast, a lower life expectancy was recorded\nfor Bulgarian women (70.94 years) than for Finnish women (72.39 years) or U.S. women\nBeginning in the late 1960s, Bulgarian mortality trends diverged from those in the\nother countries when mortality improvements at adult working ages started to decelerate.\nIn particular, between 1965 and 1989, male death rates at working ages rose and the\nprogress in reducing female mortality stagnated. This reversal did not reflect short-term\nperiodic fluctuations, but rather a continuous and steady trend that became particularly\nacute after the onset of the transition towards a market economy in 1989 (Kohler 2007).\nThis development was not unique to Bulgaria, as the pattern was characteristic of many\nEastern European counties, where life expectancies fell even below those observed in\nsome developing countries (Feachem 1994). In the 1990s, Bulgaria continued to undergo\nconsiderable economic and political upheaval that led to substantial impoverishment of\nlarge segments of the population, a trend that further distinguished it from the other two\ncountries. By the mid-1990s, male life expectancy at birth in Bulgaria was below what it\nhad been in the mid-1960s, and female life expectancy continued to be below the levels\nobserved in the other two countries (Human Mortality Database 2008). During this more\n2014 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nrecent period, Bulgaria also remained an outlier in terms of other demographic patterns,\nincluding substantial out-migration and a decline in fertility to unprecedentedly low levels\nConsistent with trends in other Western European countries, life expectancy in Finland\nimproved substantially after the early 1960s, and by the mid-1990s male life expectancy\nwas 72.8 years, and female life expectancy was 80.2 years. Although male and female\nmortality fell in all age groups, a large sex difference in life expectancy was still evident\nin the mid-1990s. A severe economic recession in the early 1990s was not associated\nwith negative changes in life expectancy trends in Finland, in sharp contrast to the pattern\nobserved in Bulgaria.\nIn the United States, following a period of stagnation in mortality improvements dur-\nand life expectancy increased in subsequent years. By the mid-1990s, U.S. life expectancy\nat birth had increased to 72.7 years for men and 79.2 years for women (Human Mortal-\nity Database 2008). Because of enduring racial disparities in health, life expectancy for\nwhites exceeded that for the nation as a whole. In 1995, life expectancy was 73.4 years for\nwhite men and 79.6 years for white women (National Center for Health Statistics 1998).\nOther important country-specific differences relevant to health are also notable. In\nBulgaria prior to 1989, health care was free and accessible to everybody. However, similar\nto other former socialist countries, the health sector was a low priority during the Cold\ndespite the introduction of various reforms in the health sector, the Bulgarian health-care\nsystem faced increasing budgetary constraints (Delcheva et al. 1997) and continued to\nbe beset by inadequate resources and lack of medical equipment. The emerging private\nhealth care system in turn was expensive and unaffordable for a large segment of the\npopulation, resulting in stratified access and provision of health care. In contrast, Finland\nhas the most egalitarian health care system of the three countries, with universal health\ninsurance coverage that would be expected to provide uniform access to health care and to\nthus reduce SES differences in mortality. At the other end of the spectrum, in the United\nStates publicly supported health insurance is limited to the elderly and to low-income\nchildren and adults, mainly women. In 1995, for example, approximately 15.4% of the\nUS population had no health insurance coverage, and despite some public coverage for\nlow income individuals, the percentage was even higher (24.3%) for those without high\nschool education. Moreover, the quality and extent of coverage varied by insurance type\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2015\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\n2.2 Educational attainment and marital status\nFor substantive and methodological reasons, we focus our analyses on educational differ-\nentials in mortality at ages 40 to 70. Although the socioeconomic status of a population\nor of individuals can be assessed using several social and economic indices, education\nis preferable for this study for a number of reasons. First, education is a composite so-\ncioeconomic measure that is related to many other social and economic factors, such as\nsocial class, earnings and income, cognitive abilities, and health behaviors (Elo and Pre-\nston 1996). Level of schooling also indexes the socioeconomic position of individuals\nearly in adulthood, as well as the stock of human capital available to them during their\nlife course (see also Feldman et al. 1989; McDonough et al. 1999; Preston and Taubman\n1994). In addition, other indices of SES, such as occupation or income, are problematic\nin the context of a transition economy such as Bulgaria's or when we are interested in\nmeasuring health and mortality differentials among women, some of whom have never\nworked or do not have independent sources of income.\nCompared to other individual-level characteristics besides education, marriage has\nbeen found to have a particularly large impact on health outcomes, with married men\nand women showing a clear survival advantage over the unmarried. Moreover, several\nstudies have demonstrated that the health benefits of marriage tend to be larger for men\nthat marital status accounts for at least some of the variation in educational differen-\ntials in mortality. In the Finnish context, for example, although the relative magnitude\nof unadjusted educational inequalities in mortality is larger for men than for women,\nthese differences partly diminish once marital status is taken into account (Koskinen\nand Martelin 1994). By introducing marital status into the analysis, we further explore\nwhether the educational gradient is different for the married and the unmarried, thus\nadding a new dimension to comparative research on educational inequalities in mortal-\nity.\nThe analyses for Bulgaria and Finland are based on population census data linked to death\nrecords. For the United States, the data come from a nationally representative survey of\nthe non-institutionalized civilian population linked to death records. The U.S. and Bul-\ngarian populations are more heterogeneous in terms of their racial and ethnic composition\nthan is the Finnish population. Thus, race/ethnicity is a potential confounder in the rela-\ntionship between educational attainment and mortality in the United States and Bulgaria.\nIn both countries race/ethnic minorities, e.g., non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics in the\n2016 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nUnited States, and the Roma and Turkish ethnic groups in Bulgaria, have lower levels of\neducation than do non-Hispanic Whites or ethnic Bulgarians, respectively. Furthermore,\nthese groups face racial/ethnic discrimination that can affect both access to health-care\nservices and other health-related resources. In addition, linkages to national death records\nare likely to be more complete for non-Hispanic whites than for non-whites in the United\nStates (National Center for Health Statistics 2000). For these reasons, we have restricted\nour data for the United States to non-Hispanic whites and for Bulgaria to ethnic Bulgar-\nians who report Bulgarian ethnicity and Bulgarian mother tongue in the census. We also\nrestrict the Bulgarian and the Finnish data to the non-institutionalized civilian population\nto make them comparable to the data for the United States.\n3.1 The Bulgarian data\nThe data for Bulgaria are individual-level and come from a linkage between the 1992\npopulation census taken on December 4th and death certificates for the period Decem-\nperformed by the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria on the basis of a personal iden-\ntification number that is uniquely assigned to each Bulgarian citizen and is included on\ndeath and census records. Approximately 93% of all death certificates for the study pe-\nriod were linked to the 1992 census records. Non-linkage of death records stems from\nincorrectly coded information on either the death or the census record and from internal\nand international migration during the 1990s that made it difficult or impossible to locate\na deceased individual. As evidence of the latter, linkage rates are lower (about 89%) in\nregions that experienced high international migration during the 1990s. It is worth noting\nthat these data are unique among Eastern European countries and represent an innovation\nfor countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\nOur mortality estimates for Bulgaria pertain to the period January 1, 1993 to De-\ncember 31, 1997. Information on exact date of death comes from death records, and\ninformation on age at baseline, education, and marital status are obtained from the census\nrecords. The Bulgarian dataset is the largest of the three datasets used in this paper and\nTable 1). The mean length of follow-up for men is 4.17 (s.d. 1.4) years and for women\n3.2 The Finnish Data\nFor Finland, we use an 11% random sample of the Finnish Longitudinal Census Data File\n(Statistics Finland, permission TK-53-1783-96) that is similar in its construction to the\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2017\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics, Bulgaria, Finland, and the United States\nBulgaria Finland United States\nMen Women Men Women Men Women\nCharacteristic Age (%)1\nEducational attainment (%)2\nMarital status (%)\nobservations\n1 The age group 40-44 years comprises almost twice as many people compared to the age group 45-49 years due\nto the fact that we allow individuals to enter our analysis if they reach age 40 during the period of observation.\n2 Education is coded to represent low, medium and high educational attainment in each country. Because of\ndifferences in educational systems, the levels of schooling correspond to slightly different years of completed\neducation (see text for further details).\n2018 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nBulgarian data. The individual-level dataset includes 244,222 men and women ages 40 to\n70. The different Finnish data sources - census, population registration and death records\n- have been linked by Statistics Finland using a unique personal identification code. Non-\nlinkage of death records to census records is less than 0.5%. Socio-demographic char-\nacteristics of respondents \u00ad age at baseline, educational attainment, and marital status \u00ad\ncome from census records, and the date of death is based on the linked death record.\nThese data have been used in previous studies to analyze mortality differentials by edu-\ncation (Martikainen and Valkonen, 1998), occupation (Valkonen et al. 2000), and family\nincome (Martikainen et al., 2001), and to compare SES differentials in mortality in Fin-\nland to those in the United States (Elo et al. 2006).\nFor Finland, our mortality estimates pertain to the period January 1, 1994 to December\nwomen. During the study period, 4.1% of men and 1.8% of women died.\nThe main difference between the US data and the Bulgarian and Finnish data is that the\nUS data come from a nationally representative survey rather than a full census. We use\nthe 1990-1994 waves of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) that have been\nlinked to the National Death Index (NDI) through 1997 (Massey et al. 1989; National\nCenter for Health Statistics 2000). The NHIS is an annual health survey of the civilian,\nnon-institutionalized population of the United States dating back to 1957 and is the pri-\nmary source of annual data on the health status of the US population. The survey's health\nand demographic core questionnaire collects information on socio-demographic charac-\nteristics of individuals residing in surveyed households, including information on age,\nrace/ethnicity, marital status, and education. The National Center for Health Statistics has\nestimated that about 6% of female and 3% of male deaths are missed in the linkage to\nthe NDI, with higher percentages estimated for non-whites (National Center for Health\nStatistics 2000).The NHIS-MCD linked data are considered the most reliable, large, na-\ntionally representative data source for the study of SES differentials in mortality in the\nThe mortality estimates for the United States pertain to the period 1990-1997, with\n4.5 (s.d. 2.0) mean years of follow-up for men and women. Information on age, marital\nstatus, education, and race/ethnicity comes from the NHIS, and the date of death is ob-\ntained through the linkage to the NDI. The analysis of the U.S. data is based on 167,562\nindividual records. During the study period, 3.7% of the men and 2.3% of the women\ndied (see Table 1).\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2019\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\n3.4 Coding of educational attainment and marital status\nEducation was classified into three categories. Our low education category corresponds\nto 0-8 completed years of education in Bulgaria, 0-9 completed years of education in\nFinland, and to 0-11 completed years of schooling in the United States. Our medium\neducation category corresponds to 9-12 completed years of education in Bulgaria, 10-\n12 completed years of schooling in Finland, and 12 completed years or a high school\neducation in the United States. In all three countries, the highest educational category\nrefers to 13+ completed years of education.\nWe use this coding of educational attainment to reflect substantive differences in ed-\nucational systems across the three countries. We use two marital status categories: cur-\nrently married and currently unmarried. The latter category includes those who were never\nmarried, divorced, separated, or widowed at the time of the census or the baseline NHIS\ninterview. Due to sample size considerations, we were unable to make finer distinctions\nin the currently unmarried group.\n4. Methods\nWe focus our analyses on ages 40 to 70. Mortality differentials by education and marital\nstatus are large at these ages, and deaths in this age range are considered premature (e.g.\nElo and Preston 1996; Koskinen and Martelin 1994). To facilitate a comparison of edu-\ncational inequalities in mortality, we calculate several life table measures using estimated\nage-specific death rates obtained from a parametric specification of the mortality hazard\nbased on the following Gompertz model:\nm(x) = a(z) eb(z) x\nThe model assumes that the death rate m(x) is an exponential function of age and a vector\nof covariates z = (z1\n, ..., zn\n), i.e., in our case education and marital status. The parameter\na(z) = exp(0\n+ ... + n\nzn\n) determines the overall level of mortality for a given\nset of socioeconomic characteristics. The parameter b(z) = 0\n+ ... + n\nzn\nindicates how the risk of death changes with age for a given socioeconomic group.\nThe Gompertz model is appealing in the present analyses for several reasons. It is\nwell documented that it aptly describes the age-specific mortality patterns at adult ages,\nwhere the logarithm of the risk of death increases linearly with age. In addition, we can\ncalculate age-specific death rates by sex, educational attainment, and marital status using\nthe parameter estimates obtained from the model.\nIn estimating the model, we allow individuals to age into the sample. That is, if an in-\ndividual celebrates his/her 40th birthday during the period of observation, s/he enters our\n2020 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nanalysis and is observed until either death or the end of the observation period, whichever\ncomes first. In addition, we censor individuals at age 70. This strategy ensures that our\nmortality estimates pertain to ages 40 to 70 during the observation period. We estimate\nseparate models by sex and country.\nAn illustrative example of the fit of the Gompertz model to our data is shown in\nAppendix 1A, which plots the observed and the fitted sex-specific death rates obtained\nfrom the model for each country. The fitted rates closely trace the observed death rates.\nThe best fit of the model is observed for Bulgaria, where we have the largest number\nof observations. The model also provides a good fit to the data in all countries when\ndisaggregated by educational attainment and marital status (results not shown).\nThe level and slope coefficients for education and marital status from all models are\nshown for men in Appendix 1B and for women in Appendix 1C. We find significant ef-\nfects of education and marital status on mortality in all countries among both men and\nwomen, with some variation in the magnitude of these effects among countries and be-\ntween men and women.\nWe used the coefficients shown in Appendix tables 1B and 1C to calculate the follow-\ning life table measures to facilitate comparison among the three countries: the expected\nnumber of years of life lost (LE-lost) due to mortality between ages 40 and 70 (i.e., 30\nyears minus expected number of years lived between age 40 and 70), and the probability\nof dying by age 70 among those who survived to age 40. In addition, we also provide\nthe approximate 95% confidence intervals for the LE-lost to reflect the uncertainty of\nour estimates. Appendix 2 describes the methodology we used to perform these latter\ncalculations. To provide a measure of absolute inequality in mortality we calculate the\ndifferences in LE-lost and the probability of dying among the following groups:\n(1) those at the highest and at the middle levels of education,\n(2) those at the highest and at the lowest levels of schooling, and\n(3) between the married and the unmarried. We assess relative inequality in mortality\nby calculating the ratio of the estimated probability of dying for those at the low\nand middle levels of schooling relative to those with the highest level of education.\n5. Results\nDescriptive statistics for the three countries are presented in Table 1. The age distribution\nin Bulgaria is slightly older than in Finland and the United States, a finding that is also\nreflected in a higher mean age at death in Bulgaria. Bulgarian men and women are more\nlikely to be married than are men and women in the United States and Finland. The\nbiggest difference among the countries is in the education distribution. More than 40% of\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2021\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nmen and women in Bulgaria and Finland fall into the lowest level of education compared\nto only about 15% in the United States.\nBulgarian men have the highest mortality and can expect to live fewer years between\n(27.6 years) (Table 2). Similarly, Bulgarian women have higher overall mortality than\ndo Finnish and American women, although the cross-country differences are smaller for\nwomen than for men (Table 2). Because there is considerable variation in mortality pat-\nterns by gender within and between countries, we begin the next section with presenting\nfirst the results for men, followed by our findings for women.\n5.1 Educational differences in male mortality\nWe find a clear education gradient in LE-lost in all three countries: the higher the level\nof education, the longer the lifespan between ages 40 and 70 and the fewer the expected\nyears of life lost due to mortality. At the same time, male mortality is higher in Bulgaria\nthan in Finland and the United Sates at all levels of education, with the largest cross-\ncountry difference found for men with low education. Men with low education reaching\nage 40 can expect to live about 2 years longer before age 70 in Finland and the United\nStates than in Bulgaria, a difference that is statistically significant. These differences\ntranslate into the steepest education gradient in LE-lost in absolute terms in Bulgaria,\nwhere men with high education can expect to live 2.56 years longer than men with low\neducation. The respective figure for Finland and the United States is 1.79 years (Table\n2 and Figure 1). Moreover, 46% of 40 year-old Bulgarian men with low education will\nperish before reaching their 70th birthday, compared to 31% of men with high education.\nThe respective percentages are 33% and 18% in Finland and 36% and 21% in the United\nStates (Table 3). The greater absolute educational inequality in male LE-lost in Bulgaria\nreflects in part higher mortality at each level of education compared to Finland and the\nUnited States (upper left panel of Figure 1).\nWhen educational inequalities in mortality are translated into relative terms, a some-\nwhat different picture emerges. When measured as the ratio of the probability of dying\nbetween ages 40 and 70 at low relative to high levels of education, educational differences\nappear to be smaller in Bulgaria than in Finland and the United States: 1.52 in Bulgaria\ncompared to 1.84 in Finland and 1.68 in the United States (Figure 1, lower left panel).\nWhen those with medium educational levels are compared to those with high education,\nthe largest relative difference in the probability of dying is observed in Finland (1.47),\nwhile the values for Bulgaria and the United States are similar (1.23 and 1.20, respec-\ntively) (Table 2 and Figure 1, lower left panel).\nWe also document large differences in LE-lost by marital status, especially in Bul-\ngaria and Finland, where married men between ages 40 and 70 live close to 3 years longer\n2022 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nTable 2: Life expectancy lost (LE-lost) by educational attainment and\nmarital status, males and females, Finland, Bulgaria, and the\nUnited States in the 1990s [approximate 95%-confidence interval]\nEducational Men Women\nattainment & Bulgaria Finland US Bulgaria Finland US\nmarital status LE-Lost between age 40 and age 70 1\nEducational attainment\nMarital status\nMarital status & educational attainment\nMarried\nUnmarried\n1 LE-lost is calculated as follows: maximum life expectancy between ages 40 and 70 (e.g., 30 years) minus estimated life expectancy\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2023\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nTable 3: Probability of dying between ages 40 and 70 by educational attain-\nment and marital status, males and females, Finland, Bulgaria, and\nEducational Men Women\nattainment & Bulgaria Finland US Bulgaria Finland US\nmarital status Probability of dying between age 40 and age 70\nEducational attainment\nMarital status\nMarital status & educational attainment\nMarried\nUnmarried\n2024 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nFigure 1: Absolute differences in LE-lost (upper panel) and relative\ndifferences in the probability of dying (lower panel)\nthan do unmarried men. The difference in LE-lost by marital status is smaller in the\nUnited States (about 2 years) (Table 2). Within and between countries, these marital sta-\ntus differences are statistically significant. We further find that marital status modifies\nthe association between education and mortality (Figures 2 and 3). Within each marital\nstatus group the absolute difference in LE-lost between men with low and high education\nis again most pronounced in Bulgaria: 2.08 years for married men and 4.07 for unmarried\n2.37 years, respectively, in the United States. Although in all three countries unmarried\nmen with low education have the highest mortality, this disadvantage is particularly strik-\ning in Bulgaria. Only 39% of 40 year old unmarried Bulgarian men with low education\ncan expect to reach their 70th birthday. At the other extreme are highly educated married\nmen in Finland, for whom the corresponding figure is 84% (Table 3).\nAlthough absolute differences in LE-lost are largest in Bulgaria, again when assessed\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2025\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nFigure 2: Absolute educational differences in life expectancy lost (LE-Lost)\nin relative terms the pattern of mortality differentials by education within marital status\nchanges. Among married men, the relative low to high education differential in the prob-\nability of dying between ages 40 and 70 is largest in Finland and smallest in the U.S.,\nwhile Bulgaria takes an intermediate position. Similar country ranking is observed when\ncomparing medium to high education differences among married men (Figure 3, upper\nleft panel). In contrast, Bulgarian unmarried men are characterized by the smallest rela-\ntive differences in the probability of dying 30\nwhen comparing men with low versus\nhigh and medium versus high education. These differences are similar in Finland and the\nUnited States (Figure 3, lower left panel).\n5.2 Educational differences in female mortality\nOverall female mortality is slightly higher in Bulgaria than in Finland and the United\nStates. The LE-lost between ages 40 and 70 for Bulgarian women is 1.83 years, about\nhalf a year higher than the corresponding estimate for Finnish women (1.20 years) and\n2026 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nFigure 3: Relative educational differences in probability of dying by marital\nabout a third of a year higher than the estimate for American women (1.49 years). These\noverall differences in LE-lost among the countries are statistically significant. We also\nobserve clear educational and marital status differences in LE-lost in all three countries\n(Table 2).\nWe document not only the lowest LE-lost among Finnish women, but Finnish women\nalso have significantly lower level of mortality than Bulgarian or American women whether\nmortality is stratified by educational attainment or marital status or both (Table 2). On the\nother hand, the pattern of absolute differences in LE-lost is less clear between Bulgar-\nian and American women. For example, both married and unmarried Bulgarian women\nhave higher mortality than married and unmarried American women. However, this pat-\ntern reverses at the lowest level of education whether or not we stratify by marital status.\nThe estimated LE-lost among poorly educated American women is 2.27 among married\nwomen and 3.33 among unmarried women. The corresponding figures for Bulgarian\nwomen are 1.97 and 2.79. These differences between American and Bulgarian women\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2027\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nare not statistically significant. This Bulgarian female advantage, however, does not ex-\ntend to higher levels of education (Table 2). Because of the higher mortality of the US\nwomen at the lowest level of education, the educational gradient in LE-lost also appears\nto be somewhat steeper in the United States than in Bulgaria.\nRelative educational differentials in the probability of dying are smaller in Bulgaria\nthan in the United States among both married and unmarried women. These differentials\nare also less pronounced among unmarried Bulgarian than unmarried Finnish women and\nthey are similar in magnitude among married women in Bulgaria and Finland. The rela-\ntive educational differentials in the probability of dying between ages 40 to 70 are most\npronounced among unmarried Finnish women and married American women (Figure 3).\n6. Discussion\n6.1 Main findings and their interpretations\nThe present analyses focus on educational and marital status differentials in all-cause\nmortality in three developed countries - Bulgaria, Finland and the United States. For Bul-\ngaria - and for Eastern Europe more generally - these analyses are of particular relevance,\nas they refer to the 1990s, a time period characterized by profound political, social and\neconomic transitions. Furthermore, Bulgaria has not been previously included in compar-\native research, and little is known about how educational and marital status differentials\nin mortality in Bulgaria compare to those observed in other developed countries. An ad-\nditional strength of our analysis is that we examine both relative and absolute differences\nin mortality using life table measures.\nConsistent with previous literature, we document a clear education gradient in male\nand female mortality in Bulgaria, Finland, and the United States during the 1990s. We\nfind greater absolute inequality in male mortality in Bulgaria than in Finland or the United\nStates. This pattern, however, is less consistent in relative terms; relative differentials\ntend to be somewhat smaller in Bulgaria than in the other countries. These latter results\nare in contrast to findings by Mackenbach et al. (1999) and Shkolnikov et al (2004), who\ndocumented larger relative mortality differentials by educational attainment for men in the\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Estonia and Russia, compared to the United States, Finland,\nNorway, and Turin, Italy. These studies and ours, however, are not directly comparable as\nthey cover different periods and age groups and use different methodologies.\nWe further find that the absolute educational difference in mortality is more pro-\nnounced among unmarried men than among married men in all countries. Unmarried\nmen with low education have the highest level of mortality. This disadvantage is particu-\nlarly striking in Bulgaria, where 61% of 40-year old unmarried men with low education\ncan expect to die before their 70th birthday. This group may have also experienced high\n2028 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\nmortality in the past as the combination of low education and being unmarried is strongly\nassociated with social marginalization in Eastern Europe. We speculate that in Bulgaria\nthe high mortality of unmarried men is partially due to the consequences of rapid social\ntransformations, e.g., increases in male unemployment, declining access to health care,\nand worsening health behaviors (i.e., heavy drinking and high prevalence of smoking).\nEvidence from elsewhere shows that Bulgarian male mortality increased around the mid-\n1990s, with mortality from cardiovascular diseases being particularly high (Cruijsen and\nEkamper 2004). Severe resource constraints in the health care sector may have also been\na contributing factor by limiting access to more intensive cardiovascular care among men\nat the margins of society.\nIn contrast to men, Bulgarian women do not exhibit a similar mortality disadvantage.\nIf anything, poorly educated Bulgarian women can expect to live somewhat longer than\npoorly educated American women between ages 40 and 70. Furthermore, the relative\neducational disparities in female mortality in Bulgaria are smaller than in Finland or the\nUnited States. At the same time, among women, the Finns are clearly better off in terms of\nLE-lost than Bulgarians or Americans. Finnish women have significantly lower mortality\nwhether we stratify by educational attainment and/or marital status than American or\nBulgarian women.\nWe also find that in each country, the LE-lost between the lowest and highest educa-\ntion group at ages 40 to 70 is bigger among men than women. Evidence from previous\nstudies (Koskinen and Martelin 1994, Mackenbach et al. 1999) suggests that at least a part\nof this gender difference is due to differences in cause-of-death patterns among men and\nwomen. Such variation in causespecific patterns may also underlie the results reported\nhere, but the investigation of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this paper.\n6.2 Data coverage and comparability\nAlthough we have used the best data sources available for comparative analyses, we\nshould note several limitations. Our first concern has to do with a difference in the type\nof data used. Both the Finnish and Bulgarian data come from censuses, which should\nbetter capture the entire population than do the survey data which cover only the non-\ninstitutionalized population as was the case in the United States. Nevertheless, the US data\nare considered highly reliable for analyses of SES differentials in US mortality (Rogers\net al. 2000). To increase comparability, we excluded the institutionalized populations in\nBulgaria and Finland.\nSecond, about 7% of the recorded deaths in Bulgaria were not linked to census records.\nMitigating this limitation is the finding that education and marital status distributions of\nthe nonlinked death records do not substantially differ from the linked death records. Non-\nlinkage is thought to stem partly from incorrectly coded information on either the death\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 2029\nKohler et al.: Educational differences in all-cause mortality by marital status\nor the census record. Furthermore, a large segment of unlinked deaths are likely due to\nhigh migration after 1989 among such population subgroups as the Turkish minority and\nyoung individuals. Because we have excluded both the Turkish and Roma minorities, as\nwell as the under 40 year-olds, we believe this non-linkage is unlikely to bias our results.\nIn addition, non-linkage may bias estimates of mortality levels rather than educational\ndifferentials.\nOne of the challenges in conducting international comparisons of mortality differen-\ntials by any measure of SES is developing comparable measures (Valkonen 1993; Mar-\ntikainen and Valkonen 1999). This issue is particularly important for our analysis, which\ncompares educational differences in mortality in countries with different historical trajec-\ntories and socioeconomic and political contexts. To increase comparability, we classify\neducational attainment into three broad groups: low, medium, and high levels of school-\ning. Because of differences in educational systems, the low and medium educational\ncategories differ slightly across countries in the number of completed years of educa-\ntion. In Bulgaria and Finland it is common for students who do not expect to advance to\npost-secondary-school education to enroll in vocational and technical schools that provide\ntraining for specific occupations. Because such training is commonly regarded as equiva-\nlent to completing a secondary school degree, we have included completion of such pro-\ngrams in the middle education categories in Bulgaria and in Finland. In the United States,\non the other hand, completing a high school education is normative and regarded as a\nnecessary precursor to enrollment in other educational venues. We believe that this cod-\ning of educational attainment better reflects differences in the educational systems across\nthe three countries, as well as differences in educational achievement, life styles and the\nemployment opportunities that schooling provides, than had we used the same number of\ncompleted years of schooling in each country. Furthermore, previous comparative analy-\nses of Finland and the US show that these choices make relatively little difference (Elo et\nWe have shown both similarities and differences in mortality patterns by gender, educa-\ntional attainment, and marital status in three countries with different economic and policy\ncontexts. The striking similarity is the protective effect of higher educational attainment\nand being married on all cause-mortality in all three countries. The size of the absolute\nvariation is remarkably similar for Finnish and American men and for Finnish and Bul-\ngarian women despite the differences in context. We further find that in all countries,\neducational effects on mortality tend to be smaller among the married than the unmarried\nin absolute terms. The main differences have to do with the size of the education effects\nand the ranking of countries by gender. We find a steeper absolute (but not relative) edu-\n2030 http://www.demographic-research.org\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 60\ncational gradient in mortality for Bulgarian men than for Finnish and American men. In\ncontrast, the absolute education gradient in female mortality is not consistently larger in\nBulgaria than in Finland or the United States.\nOur results indicate that there may be a particular need to tackle health inequalities\namong men in Eastern European countries in transition. Although we are not able to ex-\namine trends in educational differentials in mortality in Bulgaria, evidence from Estonia\n(Leinsalu et al. 2003) indicates that life-expectancy differences by educational attain-\nment at age 25 increased rapidly in that country during the 1990s. This increase was\nbrought about by declining mortality at higher levels of education and increasing mor-\ntality at lower levels of schooling. Evidence from Estonia, together with our results for\nBulgaria, suggests that men with low educational attainment are particularly vulnerable\nduring the transition from socialist to free-market regimes. Whether high education con-\nfers benefits through increased income, life style choices that are health-related, or some\nother mechanism is not possible to examine with our data. Analysis of cause-specific\nmortality could help point to plausible explanations driving these patterns and shed light\non whether cause-specific contributions to educational inequalities are similar across the\nthree countries.\n7.
