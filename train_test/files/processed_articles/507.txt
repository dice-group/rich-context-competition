This study assessed the prevalence and characteris-\ntics of MUH residency in the United States, and the extent of SHS infiltration in this environment at both the national and state\nlevels.\nMethods: National and state estimates of MUH residency were obtained from the 2009American Community Survey.Assessed\nMUH residency characteristics included sex, age, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. Estimates of smoke-free home rule preva-\nlence were obtained from the 2006\u00ad2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The number of MUH\nresidents who have experienced SHS infiltration was determined by multiplying the estimated number of MUH residents with\nsmoke-free homes by the range of self-reported SHS infiltration (44%\u00ad46.2%) from peer-reviewed studies of MUH residents.\nResults: One-quarter of U.S. residents (25.8%, 79.2 million) live in MUH (state range: 10.1% in West Virginia to 51.7% in New\nlive below the poverty level. Among MUH residents with smoke-free home rules (62.7 million), an estimated 27.6\u00ad28.9 million\nConclusions: A considerable number of Americans reside in MUH and many of these individuals experience SHS infiltration\nin their homes. Prohibiting smoking in MUH would help protect MUH residents from involuntary SHS exposure.\nIntroduction\nExposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) from burning tobacco\nproducts causes disease and premature death among non-\nsmokers (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,\n2006). Including the District of Columbia (DC), the number\nof U.S. states with comprehensive smoke-free laws prohib-\niting tobacco smoking inside all worksites, restaurants, and\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2011). However, as public\nsettings are increasingly made smoke-free, private settings\nsuch as homes are becoming relatively larger contributors to\ntotal SHS burden.\nMultiunit housing (MUH) residents are particularly\nsusceptible to involuntary SHS exposure in the home.\nEnvironmental studies conducted in MUH buildings indicate\nthat SHS constituents can infiltrate smoke-free units and\nshared areas from units where smoking is permitted (Bohac,\nHewett, Hammond, & Grimsrud, 2011; King, Travers,\nCummings, Mahoney, & Hyland, 2010), and findings from\nself-reported surveys suggest that 44%\u00ad53% of MUH\nresidents with smoke-free home rules have experienced\nan SHS infiltration in their living unit that originated from\nelsewhere in or around their building (Hennrikus, Pentel, &\nKing, Cummings, Mahoney, & Hyland, 2010; Licht, King,\nAlthough some studies have assessed the prevalence of SHS\ninfiltration among MUH residents (Hennrikus et al., 2003;\n2012), the characteristics of MUH residents and the number\nwho are potentially susceptible to SHS infiltration is uncertain.\nThis study calculated national and state estimates of the num-\nber of U.S. MUH residents, their sociodemographic character-\nistics, and how many of these individuals have experienced an\nSHS infiltration in their home.\nNicotine & Tobacco Research\nMethods\nDesign and Sample\nEstimates of MUH residency were determined by using\nnational and state representative data from the 2009 American\nCommunity Survey (ACS), an annual household survey con-\nducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The sampling frame\nincludes all valid residential addresses in the 50 states and\nDC. The ACS is primarily a mail-based survey; however, if\nno response is received, follow-up is attempted via computer-\nrespondents were interviewed (one per household). The overall\nresponse rate was 98.0%; state-specific response rates ranged\nEstimates of smoke-free home rule prevalence were obtained\nPopulation Survey (TUS-CPS), a cross-sectional household\nsurvey of adults conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data\ndata collection periods (National Cancer Institute, 2012).\nMeasures\nFor this analysis, a MUH resident was defined as any respond-\nent who reported living in a \"one-family house attached to one\nor more houses,\" or a building with between \"2\" and \"50 or\nmore\" apartments. Respondents were not considered MUH res-\nidents if they reported living in a \"one-family house detached\nfrom any other house,\" \"a mobile home,\" or \"boat, RV, van,\netc.\" Sociodemographic characteristics included sex, age, race/\nethnicity, and poverty status. Poverty status was defined by\nusing 2009U.S. Census Bureau thresholds. Respondents were\nclassified as having a smoke-free home rule if they reported\nthat smoking was prohibited inside their home.\nAnalysis\nFor each state and the United States overall, the number of\nMUH residents with smoke-free home rules was determined by\nmultiplying the prevalence of adults with self-reported smoke-\nfree home rules (TUS-CPS) by the respective number of MUH\nresidents (ACS).\nThe number of MUH residents who have experienced an\nSHS infiltration in the home was determined by multiplying\nthe national and state-specific number of MUH residents with\nsmoke-free home rules by a range of 44%\u00ad46.2%. This range\nwas derived from all published peer-reviewed studies that have\nassessed self-reported, past year SHS infiltration among MUH\nresidents with a smoke-free home rule, either during or after\nwere collected (King, Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht et al.,\n2012). To ensure comparability with ACS estimates, studies of\nspecific MUH subpopulations (e.g., public housing) were not\nconsidered in the infiltration range.\nIn both of the studies that were used to determine the pre-\nscribed range, the extent of SHS infiltration was calculated among\nMUH residents with a smoke-free home rule. However, differ-\nent questions were used to define SHS infiltration. In Licht et al.\nto have experienced SHS infiltration if they responded \"most of\nthe time,\" \"often,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"rarely\" to the question, \"In\nthe past 12 months, how often has tobacco smoke entered your\nunit from somewhere else in or around your building?\" In King,\nSHS infiltration was defined as a response of \"daily,\" \"a few times\na week,\" \"once a week,\" \"once every couple of weeks,\" or \"once a\nmonth or less\" to the question, \"During the last 12 months of liv-\ning in your unit, how often has SHS entered into your living space\nfrom somewhere else in or around the building?\"\nResults\nBy state, the proportion of MUH residents ranged from 10.1%\nlion) (Table 1). The proportion of MUH residents in DC was\nin one-family attached homes, 13.6% lived in apartment build-\nunits, and 12.0% lived in apartment buildings with 50 or more\nunits (data not shown).\nBy sex, 47.6% of U.S. MUH residents were male and\n52.4% were female (Table 2). Most MUH residents were aged\nBy race/ethnicity, the greatest proportion of MUH residents\nwere non-Hispanic White (48.0%), followed by Hispanic\nof MUH residents lived below the federal poverty level.\nAn estimated 62.7 million U.S. MUH residents had smoke-\nfree home rules. Assuming a prevalence of SHS infiltration\nMUH residents with smoke-free home rules experienced\nan SHS infiltration in their home within the past year.

Separating\nsmokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating\nbuildings cannot eliminate exposure of nonsmokers to SHS.\nTherefore, policies prohibiting smoking in MUH, including\nliving units and indoor shared areas, represent the most effec-\ntive way to fully protect MUH residents from involuntary\nexposure to SHS in this environment.\nSmoke-free MUH policies are favored by most MUH\nmissible in both government-subsidized and market-rate\nhousing (Schoenmarklin, 2009), and can result in cost savings\nSecondhand smoke infiltration among multiunit housing residents\nTable 1.

Moreover, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD) has encouraged public housing authori-\nties, as well as owners and management agents of multifamily\nhousing rental assistance programs, such as Section 8, to\nadopt and implement smoke-free policies for some or all of\noperators have implemented smoke-free policies, and many\nhave misconceptions about implementation barriers (Hewett\nTherefore, initiatives to reduce SHS in MUH should include\nefforts to educate MUH operators about the benefits of smoke-\nfree policies.\nLimitations\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to report national\nand state estimates of MUH residency and SHS infiltration\namong U.S. MUH residents. Nonetheless, the findings are\nsubject to at least four limitations. First, MUH residency\nand smoke-free home rule prevalence were determined from\ndata collected at different times. However, it is unlikely that\nany significant changes in these estimates occurred during\nthe 2-year period between which the data were collected.\nSecond, smoke-free home rule estimates were obtained from\nthe general population and may not be generalizable to MUH\nresidents. However, estimates of smoke-free home rule preva-\nlence among MUH residents are comparable to those of the\ngeneral population (King, Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht\ninfiltration range used in this study was based upon data col-\ngests that the prevalence of smoke-free MUH buildings has\nincreased with time (King et al., 2011), the inclusion of older\ndata could lead to overestimation of SHS infiltration. In order\nto account for potential declines in SHS infiltration over time,\nthe present analysis included only national and state repre-\nsentative studies conducted during or after the time period\nin which the MUH residency (2009) and smoke-free home\nrange was based upon two studies conducted nationally and\nin one state (New York), which may limit generalizability to\nother states and subpopulations. Accordingly, future research\ncould include state-level studies to verify and expand upon\nthe measures and findings presented in this study.\nFunding\nThere were no sources of funding, direct or indirect, for the\nreported research.\nDeclaration of Interests\nThe authors have no competing interests to report.\n"
