Pedersen3,4\n1School of Social Sciences, Indiana University Southeast, New Albany.\n2Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside.\n3Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.\n4Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The Karolinska Institutet Stockholm, Sweden.\nTo separate age and cohort effects on decline in normal cognitive aging, we applied growth curve models to\nlongitudinal data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Data from up to five measurement waves\ncovering a 16-year period were available from 806 participants (age 50 to 88 at the first wave). We divided the\ndomains: verbal and spatial ability, memory, and speed. We tested cohort differences by using two growth\nmodels: quadratic and two linear slopes. Results indicated significant cohort differences in average performance\nat age 67.5 for all components except speed. When we compared linear slopes during the same age range (age 62\u00ad\n78), we found no cohort differences. Trajectories of change with age in these four domains were fundamentally the\nsame in middle-old age for individuals born during the first half of the 20th century.\nONE of the primary challenges facing researchers in cogni-\ntive aging is to isolate true age changes from the con-\nfounding effects of time and cohort. It has long been observed\nthat cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of cognitive aging\ndo not always suggest the same patterns of change with age in\nSliwinski & Hofer, 1999). Moreover, time-lag studies indicate\nsignificant cohort differences in intelligence. Dramatic in-\ncreases in IQ test scores over the past century, known as the\nFlynn effect, have been documented in many countries (Flynn,\net al., 2004). Depending on the trait in question, younger\ncohorts exhibit both superior and inferior performance on mea-\nsures of cognitive functioning (Bowles, Grimm, & McArdle,\n\u00a8nnlund, Nyberg, Ba\nOne method for advancing our understanding of cohort ef-\nfects on cognitive aging is to examine cohort differences in\naging trajectories for various cognitive abilities. In addition to\ntesting cohort differences in average performance, latent growth\ncurve models allow us to investigate cohort differences in\naverage rates of decline with age (McArdle & Anderson, 1990;\nMuthen & Khoo, 1998). For example, a recent analysis com-\npared average performance and rates of decline in basic and\nreported faster decline in older cohorts for advanced vocabulary\nknowledge, but faster decline in younger cohorts for basic\nvocabulary knowledge. Using data from a cohort-sequential\nstudy of aging, Reynolds, Finkel, Gatz, and Pedersen (2002)\ncompared time-based growth curve models in adults older or\nyounger than 65 years at the first measurement occasion.\nEstimates of intercept and linear slope over time differed\nmarkedly between age groups for all three variables: block\ndesign, picture memory, and digit symbol. The conclusions that\nresearchers make about cohort differences in cognitive aging\nmay differ depending on whether they use time-based or age-\nbased models, even if they use entry age as a covariate, because\nthe time predictor may reflect additional factors beyond aging\nprocesses, including retest and attrition effects (Sliwinski &\nOur goal in the current analysis is to expand on previous\ninvestigations of cohort differences in cognitive aging. Data\nfrom the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA;\nFinkel & Pedersen, 2004), an ongoing cohort-sequential study\nof aging twins, allows us to examine cohort differences in tra-\njectories of aging in multiple domains of cognitive functioning\nby using an age-based growth curve model. The sample can\nbe divided into two cohorts to allow comparisons of aging\ntrajectories for individuals born during the first and second\nquarters of the 20th century. Five testing occasions provide\nsufficient data to support estimation of both linear and quadratic\nrates of decline in the growth curve models. Because SATSA\nincludes extensive cognitive assessment, cohort comparisons\ncan be made for cognitive functioning in four domains: verbal\nand spatial ability, memory, and processing speed.\nMany researchers and theorists have highlighted the range of\nsocial, historical, and cultural forces that can and often do differ\nbetween cohorts (e.g., Riley, Foner, & Riley, 1999; Schaie,\ncognitive aging process, resulting in cohort differences in the\ntrajectories of aging. Although identifying the specific factors\nthat impact cohort differences in cognitive aging is important,\nthe first step is to describe cohort differences in aging trajec-\ntories. Within the growth curve model, there are two ways in\nwhich cognitive aging could differ between cohorts: intercept\nand rate of decline. Cohort differences in the forces that\nimpinge on cognitive abilities could produce an initial cohort\ndifference in cognitive performance that is then maintained as\naging progresses. In other words, although average perfor-\nmance may differ, the rate of decline could be the same across\ncohorts. Salthouse (2006) refers to this phenomenon as pre-\nserved differentiation: The difference between cohorts in aver-\nage performance is maintained throughout the aging life span,\nresulting in parallel aging trajectories. In contrast, the multiple\nforces that influence the aging process could impact both\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\naverage performance and rate of decline. It is possible that the\nsame factor that contributes to higher average performance also\ncontributes to more successful maintenance of that performance\nover the life span. The result is differential preservation\n(Salthouse): Cognitive abilities may be better preserved in one\ncohort than in the other cohort. The difference in preservation\nof cognitive functioning leads to differential rates of decline\nand thus divergent aging trajectories.\nThe results of previous cross-sectional comparisons allow us\nto make predictions about cohort differences in average\nperformance; therefore, we expect cohort differences in the\nintercept of the growth curve model in all four cognitive\ndomains, with higher average performance in the younger\nSchaie, 2005). Conclusions from cross-sectional data may not\ntransfer to predictions about cohort differences in cognitive\ndecline, however (e.g., Riley et al., 1999; Schaie & Hofer,\nreported analyses of cohort differences in rates of decline in\ncognitive performance. Two-component theories of intelligence\npredict greater cultural impact on aging trajectories for aging-\nresilient (i.e., crystallized) abilities than for age-sensitive (i.e.,\nfluid) abilities. Given cohort differences in cultural experience\n(cf., Riley et al.; Settersten, 2006), two-component theories of\nintelligence suggest that crystallized abilities (including verbal\nability and memory) would follow the differential preservation\nhypothesis and exhibit faster rates of decline in the older cohort.\nPrevious cohort comparisons of rates of decline in vocabulary\nprovide only partial support for the differential preservation\nhypothesis, however (Bowles et al.).\nSpatial abilities and processing speed are generally consid-\nered components of fluid intelligence (e.g., Birren & Fisher,\n1996), although processing speed can be conceptualized as\nSchaie, 2005). Previous growth curve comparisons report sig-\nnificant age group differences in rates of decline for processing\nspeed and spatial ability (Reynolds et al., 2002). However, two-\ncomponent theories of intelligence hypothesize small cultural\neffects for measures of fluid abilities (Lindenberger, 2001).\nTherefore, it is possible that any cohort differences in expe-\nrience will have no impact on rates of decline for measures of\nfluid abilities, providing support for the preserved differentia-\ntion hypothesis.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nAscertainment procedures for SATSA have been described\npreviously. In brief, the sample is a subset of twins from the\npopulation-based Swedish Twin Registry (Finkel & Pedersen,\n2004). The base population comprises all pairs of twins who\nindicated that they had been separated before the age of 11 and\nreared apart, and a sample of twins reared together who were\nmatched on the basis of gender and date and county of birth.\nTwins were mailed questionnaires, and a sample of those twin\npairs who were aged 50 years or older in which both twins\nresponded was invited to participate in an additional in-person\nexamination of health and cognitive abilities (Pedersen et al.,\n1991). In-person testing (IPT1) took place in a location\nconvenient to the twins. Testing was completed during a single\n4-hour visit. The second and third waves of in-person testing\n(IPT2 and IPT3) occurred after 3-year intervals. In-person\ntesting did not occur during Wave 4; therefore, the next wave of\nin-person testing is labeled IPT5 and occurred after a 7-year\ninterval (see Finkel & Pedersen). The fifth wave of in-person\ntesting (IPT6) took place 3 years after IPT5.\nDementia status was determined by clinical diagnosis based\non current diagnostic criteria (Gatz, et al., 1997), and in the\ncurrent analyses we did not include participants who developed\ndementia at any point during their participation. The number of\nparticipants at each in-person testing occasion who remained\ntotal, 806 nondemented individuals had cognitive data available\nfrom at least one testing occasion. In the older cohort, 59% of\nparticipants are women and 41% are men; in the younger\nThe median birth year of the individuals in the sample was\n1924. However, participants were recruited into the Swedish\nTwin Registry in two waves: twins born in 1925 and earlier and\ndefined two cohorts on the basis of the recruitment phases:\nnote at the end of this article). Sample sizes and age ranges in\neach cohort at each testing wave are presented in Figure 1. On\nthe left side of the figure, truncation at age 50 is evident in the\nyounger cohort. On the right side, subject mortality is evident in\nthe upper limits of the age ranges in the older cohorts. In\nSATSA, education is rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (elementary\nschool) to 4 (university or higher). Mean education was 1.75 in\nthe younger cohort and 1.48 in the older cohort. This is\nFigure 1. Age range of individuals assessed in younger (born\nmeasurement. Sample sizes are indicated in each bar. IPT denotes the\nwave of in-person testing. Note that the fourth wave of measurement\ndid not include an IPT component.\nIn our current analyses we focus on cohort comparisons of\nindividual performance, making it necessary for us to eliminate\nany bias resulting from the inclusion of twins. We fit all models\nto a sample that included a randomly selected member of each\ntwin pair; this is Sample A. We then replicated analyses in a\nsample consisting of the other member of each twin pair; this is\nSample B. We randomly assigned individuals from incomplete\npairs to either Sample A or Sample B.\nMeasures\nFour cognitive domains are represented in the SATSA\ncognitive test battery (see Nesselroade, Pedersen, McClearn,\nspatial, memory, and processing speed abilities. Verbal abilities\nare tapped by tests on Information, Synonyms, and Analogies.\nFigure Logic, Block Design, and Card Rotations tests assess\nspatial abilities. Memory tests include Digit Span, Picture\nMemory, and Names and Faces. Finally, Symbol Digit and\nFigure Identification tests measure processing speed. Reliabil-\nities for these tests range from .82 to .96 (Pedersen et al.). We\nused principal components analysis to construct latent compo-\nnents from the individual tests within each domain: verbal,\nspatial, memory, and speed. For the verbal, spatial, and speed\ncomponents, loadings ranged from .78 to .92 and the\namong the individual measures. The memory component was\nmore diverse, including measures of short-term, long-term, and\npicture memory. Loadings ranged from .64 to .78 and the\ncomponent explained 53% of the variance. Previous compar-\nisons of component structure between cohorts and across\ntesting occasions indicate that the structure does not vary sys-\ntematically across age or time (Finkel, Reynolds, McArdle, &\nPedersen, 2005a). To avoid the issue of measurement variance\n(cf. Wicherts et al., 2004), we created an invariant definition\nof components at each testing occasion by standardizing the\ncognitive measures relative to the respective means and\nvariances at IPT1, and we used the loadings from the principal\ncomponents analyses conducted at IPT1 to construct the verbal,\nspatial, and memory components. We combined the speed\nmeasures into a speed component by using unit weighting.\nFinally, for ease of interpretation, we translated all component\nscores into T scores, using means and variances from IPT1.\nStatistical Method\nWe used a growth curve model to examine cohort differences\nin cognitive aging. The structural model can be considered as\na multilevel random coefficients model (Bryk & Raudenbush,\nThe model provides estimation of fixed effects, that is, fixed\npopulation parameters as estimated by the average growth\nmodel of the entire sample, and random effects, that is, inter-\nindividual variability in intraindividual change in growth model\nparameters. Growth curve models take into account missing\ndata by giving more weight to individuals with the most\ntime points.\nFigure 2 presents a general form of the growth models that\nwe used in these analyses. Individual scores at any one time are\na function of a latent intercept (I), practice or retest effects (P),\nthe first age basis (B1\n), the second age basis (B2\n), and random\n). Note that I*, B1\n* refer to the\nstandardized scores of I, B1\n. Standardized practice\neffects can also be included; however, previous analyses have\nindicated no interindividual variance around mean practice\neffects (Finkel et al., 2005a). The model-fitting procedure\nentails fitting individual growth models to all available data;\nrepeated measurements are indicated by the y0\nthrough y4\nvariables. Paths from practice to the observed scores indicate\nthat the entire practice effect was assumed to occur at the first\nretest. The paths from the latent age basis parameters to the\nobserved scores are the age basis coefficients: B1\n(t) and B2\n(t).\nThe age basis serves as a marker for the age of the subject at\neach time of measurement, adjusted for the centering age. The\nrandom errors or uniquenesses (u0\n) represent unaccounted\nvariation from fitting the growth model to the cognitive\nmeasures; we constrained these time-specific residual variances\nto be equal over time. The means (Mi \u00bc mean intercept; Mp \u00bc\nmean practice; Mb1\n\u00bc mean first age basis; Mb2\n\u00bc mean second\nage basis) are the estimates of the average performance and\naverage amount of change. Standard deviations of the in-\nterindividual differences in the intercept and change parameters\nare indicated by Di, Db1\n. Finally, the relationships\namong the intercept and rates of change are represented by the\ncorrelations Rib1\n.\nWe used two versions of the growth model in the present\nanalyses; each model is defined by the manner in which the two\nage bases were parameterized. First, we fit a quadratic model to\nthe data, setting B1\nequal to the linear slope (age) and B2\nequal\nFigure 2. General latent growth curve model including two age\n.\nto accelerating changes with age (age2). We compared param-\neter estimates for intercept, slope, and quadratic terms across\ncohorts. We estimated quadratic growth models and tested\ncohort differences by using PROC Mixed with maximum like-\nlihood estimation in SAS 8.0 (SAS Institute, 1999). However,\ncomparing quadratic growth models across the different age\nranges encompassed by each cohort does not adequately cap-\nture the overlapping age range that is covered by both cohorts\n(i.e., ages 62\u00ad78). Therefore, in a second approach, we ex-\npanded the standard linear growth model to include two linear\ngrowth rates (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992; Finkel, Reynolds,\nMcArdle, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2003): one linear slope before the\ncentering age and a separate linear slope after the centering age,\nwith the centering age acting as a pivot point. We estimated and\ntested two-slope growth models in Mx by using maximum\nlikelihood estimation (Neale, Boker, Xie, & Maes, 2003).\nIt is important to note that one of the fundamental\nassumptions of growth curve models is that data are missing\nat random (MAR). Without complete mortality data, it is\ndifficult to establish whether the MAR assumption is met,\nalthough previous investigations of SATSA data suggest that\nparticipants who continue in the study are significantly different\nfrom those who drop out (e.g., personality ratings; see Pedersen\n& Reynolds, 1998). Of most importance in a comparison of\ngrowth models across cohorts is to demonstrate that the pattern\nof missing data does not differ between cohorts. Table 1\npresents the participation rates in the two cohorts. We can see\nthat although the patterns are fairly similar, the older cohort\nis somewhat more likely than the younger cohort to have at\nleast 3 time points simply as a result of a greater number of\nopportunities for participation. However, in the overlapping age\ninterval where the two cohorts can be compared most directly\n(age 62\u00ad78; see Figure 1), there was no significant difference\nbetween the cohorts in the rate of missing data.\nRESULTS\nQuadratic Model\nWe used quadratic growth curve models to examine cohort\ndifferences in both average performance and rate of change\nwith age. Age 67.5 was the centering age that we used for the\nquadratic growth curve analyses, which we selected because it\ncrosses three of the five waves of measurement for each cohort.\nFirst we tested three general models that examine cohort\ndifferences in fixed effects (means) and random effects\n(variances). In Model 1, we fit the quadratic growth model to\nSample A. In Model 2, we entered cohort as a covariate in the\nmodel, allowing the fixed effects (mean intercept, mean prac-\ntice, mean slope, and mean quadratic terms) to differ between\ncohorts. In Model 3, we also allowed random effects to differ\nbetween cohorts: intercept, slope, and quadratic variance and\ncorrelation terms, as well as residual variance. We compared\nthe three nested models by using the difference chi-square test\nobtained by taking the difference between the model fits [i.e.,\n\u00c02 ln(likelihood)] and testing its significance with the degrees\nof freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters\nof the two models. Comparing Models 1 and 2 provided an\nomnibus test of cohort differences in average performance and\naverage rate of change, and comparing Models 2 and 3\nprovided an omnibus test of cohort differences in interindivid-\nual differences in the parameters. Parameters estimates from\nModel 2 and model fit statistics are presented in Table 2. We\nrepeated all analyses and model comparisons in Sample B; the\nresults of model testing in Sample B were consistent with the\nresults presented here. For all four cognitive components,\nmodel comparison indicated a significant cohort difference in\nthe fixed effects of the quadratic model. In contrast, model\ncomparison failed to indicate any cohort differences in the\ninterindividual differences in the quadratic model. Therefore,\nwe constrained random effects to be equal across cohorts for the\nremaining analyses of quadratic growth curves.\nFollowing the omnibus test of cohort differences in fixed\neffects, we tested the significance of cohort differences in\nTable 1.

In\nModel 4, only the intercept differed between cohorts, and we\ncompared model fit with Model 1. In Model 5, both intercept\nand practice differed between cohorts, and we compared model\nfit with Model 4. Model 6 included separate cohort estimates\nfor intercept, practice, and linear slope; Model 7 included\nseparate cohort estimates for intercept, practice, linear slope,\nand the quadratic term. (Model 7 is identical to Model 2; both\nallow cohort differences in all fixed effects. Note that testing the\ngrowth parameters independently produced the same results as\ndid the additive method described.)\nThe resulting changes in fit between these nested models are\nprovided in Table 3. The quadratic growth curves estimated by\nModel 2 (allowing cohort differences in all fixed effects) are\npresented in Figure 3. For the verbal, spatial, and memory\ncomponents, the results follow the same pattern: significant\ncohort differences in the intercept and quadratic term, but no\nsignificant differences in practice or linear slope. The intercept\nestimates the average performance at the centering age, and\nperformance on the verbal, spatial, and memory components at\nage 67.5 is significantly lower in the older cohort. The older\ncohort also demonstrated a more negative quadratic estimate\n(faster decline) than the younger cohort for these three\ncomponents. We found a very different pattern of results for\nthe speed component. The only significant cohort difference\nwas in the significantly smaller practice term in the older\ncohort: The average performance and rates of age-related\ndecline for the processing speed component did not differ\nsignificantly between the two cohorts.\nOne concern with comparing quadratic growth curves across\nthe two cohorts is that the quadratic term estimates accelerating\ndecline across the entire age range. Given the differences\nbetween cohorts in the completeness of the data, especially at\nthe ends of the age range (see Figure 1), the precision of the\ngrowth curve models may not be comparable across cohorts.\nTherefore, testing cohort differences in the quadratic parameter\nTable 3. Testing Cohort Differences in the Quadratic\nModel: Change in Model Fit\nFactor Intercept Practice Linear Quadratic\nNotes: For the change in model fit, df \u00bc 1. Values in the table are distributed\nas chi-squares.\nFigure 3. Quadratic latent growth curve models estimated by Model 2 (allowing cohort differences in all fixed effects): younger cohort (dashed\nline) and older cohort (solid line).\nmay be functionally equivalent to comparing accelerating rates\nof decline in middle and late adulthood. To examine cohort\ndifferences in rates of decline, a more direct comparison of\ndecline in the same age range is required.\nTwo-Slope Model\nThe purpose of applying the two-slope model was to\ncompare rates of decline for the two cohorts precisely where\nthe age ranges overlap: ages 62 to 78. In the two-slope model,\nthe first age basis consists of the linear slope prior to the\ncentering age and the second age basis is the linear slope after\nthe centering age. To establish a linear slope in the same age\nrange in the separate cohorts for the purposes of cohort\ncomparison, we selected different centering ages on the basis of\nthe endpoints of the overlapping age range (62 and 78). We\ncentered the data at age 62 in the younger cohort. Consequently,\nSlope 1 indicates average linear change with age between\nages 50 and 62, and Slope 2 indicates average linear change\nwith age between ages 62 and 78. In the older cohort, we\ncentered the data at age 78; therefore, Slope 1 covered ages 62\nthe younger cohort and Slope 1 in the older cohort both covered\nthe overlapping age range of 62 to 78 years. We fit the two-\nslope growth models separately in the two cohorts, and we\ncompared two models. First, we fit the full model, estimating\nseparate intercept, practice, Slope 1, and Slope 2 in each cohort,\nto the data. In the second model, we constrained Slope 2 in the\nyounger cohort to be equal to Slope 1 in the older cohort.\nModel fitting in Mx was required to model this incongruous\nconstraint between the two cohorts. Given the differences in\ncentering ages, interindividual variances were not constrained\nto be equal across cohorts. We again compared the two nested\nmodels by using the difference chi-square test.\nThe parameter estimates from the full two-slope model and\nthe results of model fitting are presented in Table 4. As the\nfocus of the two-slope model was comparison of mean slopes,\nthe 11 variance, covariance, and residual variance estimates\nin each cohort are not reported here but are available from\nD. Finkel upon request. Parameter estimates for intercept and\npractice will differ between Tables 2 and 4 because of the\ndifference in centering ages: intercept and practice parameters\nindicate the average performance and average practice effects at\nthe centering age. The two-slope growth curves estimated for\neach cohort are presented in Figure 4. We fit all models in\nSample A and we repeated model fitting in Sample B; results in\nthe two samples were consistent and the results from Sample A\nare reported. The differences in intercept indicated by the\nquadratic growth curve analysis are still evident in the two-\nslope models presented in Figure 4. For verbal, spatial, and\nmemory variables, there is a clear separation of the decline\ntrajectories for the two cohorts. In addition, all slope estimates\nreported in Table 4 are significantly different from zero, with\nthe exception of slope estimates in the 50\u00ad62 age interval in the\nyounger cohort for the verbal and memory components.\nHowever, as the model-fitting results presented at the bottom\nof Table 4 indicate, there are no significant cohort differences in\nthe average rate of decline in the overlapping age range.\nDISCUSSION\nOur goal in the current analysis was to examine possible\ncohort differences in trajectories of decline for cognitive\nvariables, as separate from cohort differences in average\nperformance. We applied two parameterizations of a growth\nmodel to the data: a quadratic model estimating linear and\naccelerating decline and a two-slope model estimating decline\nin two linear components before and after a midpoint. We\nestimated cohort differences in the average performance in the\nquadratic approach, and we examined cohort differences in\naverage age-related rates of decline by using both the quadratic\nand two-slope growth models.\nAverage Performance\nBy comparing the intercept of the quadratic growth model\nacross cohorts, we found that the average performance was one\nthird to one half of a standard deviation lower in the older\ncohorts in three of the four cognitive domains: verbal ability,\nspatial ability, and memory. We found no significant cohort\ndifferences in average performance for processing speed. It is\nimportant to note that the magnitude of cohort differences in\naverage performance will depend on the centering age used in\nthe growth model; general conclusions may be drawn but\ninterpretations of the size of the cohort difference should be\nmade with caution. Previous analyses of the Flynn effect\nsuggest small cohort effects for verbal ability (Flynn, 1987), but\ninvestigations focusing on vocabulary typically report large\ncohort differences in samples with 40- to 80-year ranges in birth\nfor both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) verbal\nIQ and a verbal comprehension index. Similarly, in the present\nanalyses, cohort differences in average performance were\nsignificant for the verbal component. It is likely that the cohort\ndifferences in education found in this sample are responsible for\nat least part of the cohort difference in verbal ability, but\nprevious analyses indicate that 20th-century trends in education\ndo not fully explain cohort differences in verbal ability (e.g.,\nAlwin & McCammon, 2001; Kaufman; Finkel, Reynolds,\nTable 4.

The younger cohort was born between 1926\naSlope estimate is not significantly different from zero.\nOn the basis of previous investigations, we predicted\nsignificant cohort effects for memory and spatial ability, and\nthese predictions were supported. We found no cohort differ-\nences in average performance for processing speed. A com-\nparison of WAIS-R and WAIS-III data also found no cohort\ndifferences for performance IQ or for indices of perceptual\norganization and processing speed (Kaufman, 2001). Results\nfrom the Seattle Longitudinal Study also report some cohort\ndifferences for measures of perceptual speed, although the\nmagnitude of those differences is smallest for Identical\nPictures, the task that is most similar to the Figure Identification\ncomponent of the processing speed component used here\n(Schaie, 2005). In addition, other tasks with a substantial speed\ncomponent (e.g., Word Fluency) exhibit little or no cohort\ndifferences. Two-component theories of cognitive aging\npredict smaller cohort differences for age-sensitive abilities\nLindenberger, 2001). These results may indicate that slowing\nof perceptual speed is a component of primary aging, funda-\nmental to the aging process and shaped very little by cohort or\ncultural factors.\nRates of Decline\nComparing average performance across cohorts fails to\ncapture the dynamic processes of change that occur with\ncognitive aging. With cohort-sequential data, we can focus not\nonly on interindividual differences in performance but on\ncohort differences in intraindividual change over time (Baltes &\nNesselroade, 1979). Therefore, the primary focus of the current\nanalysis was to investigate cohort differences in trajectories of\ndecline for cognitive measures. We applied both quadratic and\ntwo-slope growth models to the data and, as is often the case in\naging research, the form of the question affected the outcome.\nAlthough the quadratic model estimates accelerating age\nchanges across the entire age range of the sample, the cohorts\ndiffered in the distribution of data available to support the\nparameter estimates. As a result, examining cohort differences\nin quadratic parameters in the two cohorts functionally com-\npares aging trajectories defined by young-old and old-old age. It\nis not surprising, then, that significant cohort differences in\naccelerating decline were found for verbal, spatial, and memory\nabilities. In contrast, no cohort differences in the quadratic\nparameter were found for processing speed. Therefore, we can\nconclude that the average rate of decline in processing speed is\nfundamentally the same across cohorts.\nApplying the two-slope growth model to the issue of cohort\ndifferences in rates of decline allowed us to make direct cohort\ncomparisons of decline in the same age range: ages 62 to 78. In\nthat age range, no significant cohort differences in rates of de-\ncline were identified for any of the cognitive domains assessed.\nFigure 4. Two-slope latent growth curve models estimating independent slopes for the younger cohort (dashed line) and older cohort (solid line).\nIn their comparison of longitudinal trends in vocabulary across\nthree cohorts, Bowles and colleagues (2005) did not constrain\ntheir models to compare aging trajectories in the same age\nrange. Even so, their results indicate cohort differences in\naverage performance, but not in the rates of decline in the age\nTaken together, these results are in direct opposition to theories\nof cohort differences in cognitive functioning based primarily\non investigations of average performance. Cohort differences in\naverage performance on cognitive tasks have been strongly\nsupported by several studies, including the present quadratic\ngrowth curve analysis. The absence of cohort differences in\nlinear aging trajectories, however, suggests preserved differ-\nentiation: Initial cohort differences in cognitive performance are\nmaintained throughout the aging process. There is a growing\nbody of evidence for preserved differentiation in cognitive\naging. For example, although researchers find the expected sex\ndifferences in average performance, they report few sex dif-\nferences in rates of decline for measures of cognitive ability\n(Aartsen, Martin, & Zimprich, 2004; Caskie, Schaie, & Willis,\nreports that, although mental exercise impacts average perfor-\nmance, there is no evidence to date that it results in differential\npreservation of cognitive abilities (i.e., differential rates of\ndecline).\nIn the current investigation, the fundamental nature of these\nconclusions is restricted by the limited amount of overlap in the\nage ranges covered by the two cohorts (only 16 years) and by\nthe focus on linear decline when the life-span aging trajectories\nare primarily quadratic in nature. Furthermore, the use of time-\nbased, as opposed to event-based, cohorts may have limited\nsubstantive interpretation of the results. Although it is easy to\npinpoint the date of events that may impact functioning (e.g.,\nthe 1918 influenza epidemic in Sweden), determining the point\nin the life span when the impact of the event will be strongest is\nnot a simple matter (Alwin, Hofer, & McCammon, 2006).\nTherefore, with regard to the impact on cognitive decline in the\nsecond half of the life span, event-based cohort definition may\nbe as arbitrary as time-based cohort definition. Additional sup-\nport for the absence of cohort differences in aging trajectories\nwould be provided by comparisons of growth models from\ncohorts that differ more dramatically than the cohorts used in\nthe present analyses, such as the first and second halves of the\n20th century. In summary, the current analyses indicate that the\ndramatic social, historical, and cultural differences between\nimpact average performance on cognitive tasks, but they do not\nresult in cohort differences in the preservation of cognitive\nfunctioning during the second half of the life span. Clearly,\ninterindividual differences in cognitive aging exist (e.g., Finkel\net al., 2003), and identifying the factors that contribute to\nslower rates of decline and thus more successful aging\ncontinues to be of paramount importance.\n"
