Many of the\nmedications prescribed are the newer psychotropic drugs, such as\nRisperidone, and Quetiapine, oftentimes referred to as second-gener-\nation antipsychotics. Compared to the older drugs like Haldol and\nThorazine, second-generation antipsychotics boast an improved\nsafety profile, with fewer side effects such as tardive dyskinesia,\nextra pyramidal symptoms, and hyperprolactinemia (4,5). This\nadvantage has led to providers prescribing antipsychotics more fre-\nquently not only for psychotic conditions, but also for other behav-\nioral problems such as oppositional defiant disorder, irritability in\nautism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (4). In addition, several\nof these newer drugs are now approved and indicated for use in the\npediatric population by the Food and Drug Administration.\nA troublesome side effect of many of these medications is weight\nperiod (6). Excessive weight gain has ominous implications for the\nemotional and physical health of the child. Childhood obesity is\nassociated with metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia,\nglucose intolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hyperten-\nsion (9,10). Obese children are also at increased risk for psychoso-\ncial sequelae, including low self-esteem (11).\nTo counteract the adverse side effect of weight gain, providers are\nto educate the patient on the risk of weight gain, and provide dietary\nand physical activity counseling when any psychotropic medication\nis initiated (12,13). These lifestyle recommendations, when adhered\nto, have been shown to reduce psychotropic-induced weight gain\nbased on lifestyle changes alone, participants lost an average of\nThe increase in the use of the psychotropic medication particularly\nsecond-generation antipsychotics, burden of obesity as a disease,\nand encouraging outcome with diet and physical activity counseling\nunderscore the need for healthcare providers who care for these\n1 Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition; Nationwide Children's Hospital; 700 Children's Drive; Columbus, OH 43205, USA.

Using\na national representative population of office visits, we examined\ncurrent provider practice patterns associated with screening for\nobesity, as well as diet and physical activity counseling for a vulner-\nable subset of children whose treatment for mental illness put them\nat a higher risk to become or remain obese.\nMethods\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCH) conducts two\nnational surveillance surveys (16,17), the National Ambulatory Med-\nical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS), to track healthcare provider prac-\ntices in ambulatory settings within the United States.\nStudy database\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) con-\nducted annually since 1989 is an office-based survey of patient-\nphysician encounters. It uses multistage stratified random sampling\nby geographic area, physician specialty, and patient visits within a\n52-week randomized period. Nonfederally funded, office-based\nphysicians, principally involved with patient care, are selected\nfrom the master lists of the American Medical Association and\nAmerican Osteopathic Association. For each physician, patient\nencounters are systematically sampled from a sequential list of\npatients seen in the physician's office during an assigned week.\nThe sampling rate varies from 20% to 100% depending on the\nsize of the practice.\nThe National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\n(NHAMCS) is conducted in emergency and outpatient departments\nin nonfederal general and short stay hospitals located in the 50 states\nand the District of Columbia. Clinics are eligible if they are attached\nto the sample hospital and care is provided under the supervision of\na physician. Patients are randomly selected from a sample of visits\nthat occur during a randomly assigned 4-week reporting period. The\nsampling rate employed is 1 in 20 visits or a maximum of 200\nvisits.\nSurvey instrument\nFor both NAMCS and NHAMCS, the unit of analysis is the patient\nvisit. For each visit, physicians or staff completed a one-page survey\ninstrument detailing patient demographics, insurance data, patient\ncomplaint, physician diagnoses and services provided, current\nover-the-counter and prescription medications, visit disposition, and\nduration of visit. Up to three patient-complaints for a visit and three\nphysician diagnoses are coded according to the NAMCS Code and\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical\nModification (ICD-9-CM), respectively.(18) A check box allows\nphysicians or staff to indicate when blood pressure or cholesterol\nscreening, diet/nutrition, and exercise counseling are performed. In\n2005, the survey began collecting height and weight measures. The\nsurvey design and estimation procedures are described in-depth\nStudy population\nand 2008 in the NAMCS and the outpatient component of the\nNHAMCS database. We excluded any visit made to emergency\ndepartments from the sample.\nCase definitions\nAn obesity-related visit was defined as a visit with a physician iden-\ntification of overweight/obesity using the diagnostic codes, ICD-9-\npercentile for age and gender (19). The presence of any of the fol-\nlowing obesity-related condition was classified as a cardiovascular\nand metabolic (CVM) condition: (1) hyperlipidemia ICD-9 272.0-\ndigit subclassification 0 or 2. Most of the obesity-related conditions\noccurred with low frequency; thus, we were unable to examine each\ncomorbid condition separately.\nUsing the National Institute of Mental Health index of medications,\npsychotropic medications were initially categorized into four catego-\nries: antimanic, antipsychotic, antidepressants, and antianxiety drugs.\nThen, two authors (IUE and KK) independently subcategorized each\nmedication as obesogenic or nonobesogenic using side effects\nreported in the extant literature and review of the 2008 Physician\nDesk Reference (Table 1). Both authors resolved areas of disagree-\nment together, and input from two psychiatrists was used to settle\nany remaining differences.\nReliability of data\nThe NCHS suggests combining the NAMCS and outpatient compo-\nnent of the NHAMCS surveys when ambulatory care is assessed.\nCombining both surveys allows for inclusion of select populations,\nsuch as Medicaid, African-American, and adolescent groups with\ndifferent healthcare access patterns (20-22). The reliability criteria\nfor validity and generalizability of data from the NAMCS and\nNHAMCS data is a minimum 30 unweighted cases and a relative\nstandard error <30%. We report results only when reliability criteria\nfor the data were met.\nStatistical analysis\nTo obtain national estimates, we used the NCHS provided weights,\ncalculated from physician and visit sampling rates and adjusted for\nnonresponse for each patient encounter (16,17). Statistical signifi-\ncance for bivariate categorical data, for example, differences\nbetween patient demographics, physician identification of obesity,\nuse of psychotropic medication, presence of cardiovascular and\nmetabolic conditions, counseling for diet and physical activity, were\nassessed using the Chi-square test. We used logistic regression anal-\nysis to determine predictor for identification of obesity. The\nindependent variables in the model were age, sex, race/ethnicity,\noverweight status, and obesogenic psychotropic medication.\nResults\ncare visits weighted to represent 600 million pediatric visits nation-\nally.

Obesity was\nidentified as a diagnosis by the provider at 8.6% of visits with\nobesogenic psychotropic medications, 6.9% of visits with nonobeso-\ngenic psychotropic medications, and 1.4% of visits without any\npsychotropic medications. Of the visits with the BMI  85th percen-\ntile, obesity was identified by the provider at 38.5% of visits with\nobesogenic psychotropic medications, 29.8% of visits with nonobe-\nsogenic psychotropic medications, and 15.6% of visits without any\npsychotropic medications (Figure 1).

For visits associated with psychotropic medications, di-\netary counseling was provided at 11.4% of the visits.

The highest rates of any counseling (0.7%)\noccurred at visits where there was a psychotropic medication and\nthe BMI was >85th percentile (Figure 2). The rates for physical ac-\ntivity counseling alone did not meet NAMCS/NHAMCS reliability\nbecause of the extremely low unweighted numbers (<30) and, there-\nfore, are not reported.\nTABLE 1 Classification of psychotropic medications\nObesogenic\npsychotropic\nmedications\nNon-obesogenic psychotropic\nmedications\nAntidepressants Antidepressants\nSertraline Bupropion Imipramine HCL\nAmitriptyline Venlafaxine Doxapram HCL\nNortriptyline Trazadone Desipramine HCL\nParoxetine Buspirone Trimipramine Maleate\nCitralopram Fluvoxamine\nDoxepin Protriptyline HCL\nFluoxetine\nEscitalopram\nMood stabilizers/Antimania Mood stabilizers/Antimania\nLithium Topiramate\nValproate Lamotrigine\nCarbamazepine Zonisamide\nGabapentin\nAntipsychotics Antipsychotics\nMirtazapine Risperidone Molindone\nHaloperidol Quetiapine Pimozide\nPerphenazine Ziprasidone\nClozapine Aripiprazole\nOlanzapine Thioridazine\nAnxiolytics Anxiolytics\nNone applicable Alprazolam\nLorazepam\nPsychostimulants Psychostimulants\nNone applicable Methylphenidate\nAmphetamine\nDextroamphetamine sulfate\nTABLE 2 Characteristics of study population\nObesogenic*\nPsychotropic\nMedication\n(%)\nNonobesogenic\nPsychotropic\nMedication\n(%)\nNo\nPsychotropic\nMedication\n(%)\nRace\nInsurance\nMed use\nNumber of meds: -\n*Visit where any obesogenic medication was identified.\nObesity Children with Psychotropic Weight Gain Eneli et al.\nCardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity\nThe prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic (CVM) complica-\ntions at all the visits was 0.96% (n \u00bc 597).

This trend is similar to low rates of provider identification\nof obesity (23) and discordant with how most physicians report they\nview childhood obesity (24). In a survey of pediatricians and other\nhealth providers, 75-93% felt childhood and adolescent obesity was\na serious condition that needed to be addressed (24).\nDespite the overall low identification rates reported in our study, it\nis encouraging that the odds of identifying obesity was significantly\nhigher at visits associated with a psychotropic medication (OR 5.2,\n95% CI 3-8.8). Perhaps healthcare providers are more sensitive to\nweight gain among this subset of children. Other positive predictors\nfor identification included female gender and non-Hispanic ethnicity.\nA higher rate of physician identification for obesity has been\nreported previously among females (25-27). Females may be more\nlikely than males to share their concerns about their weight with\ntheir physicians, thus prompting greater identification. We did not\nfind increased identification of obesity at visits with blacks or His-\npanics reported in other studies (25,28). It is probable that racial/eth-\nnic distribution may differ depending on the pattern of prescribing\npsychotropic medication, or the etiology of the weight gain, that is,\nwhether it is exogenous or induced by psychotropic medications.\nThus, our finding of increased identification among non-Hispanics\nneeds to be interpreted with caution and further analysis\nrecommended.\nCorrell and colleagues(5) have put forth a set of criteria to define\nclinically significant psychotropic-induced weight gain in children\nand adolescents. The criteria include (i) 5% increase in over base-\nline weight in 3 months, (ii) increase in BMI Z-score of 0.5 stand-\nard deviation or more above appropriate growth, (iii) crossing into\nthe 95th percentile for BMI, or (iv) crossing into the 85-94th per-\ncentile for BMI plus one obesity related co-morbidity. For a child\nto meet these criteria there has been considerable deviation from\ntheir normal growth trajectory. The criteria align with recognized\ndefinitions for overweight and obesity in children (19). The excess\nweight gain noted with psychotropic medications is associated with\nan increased risk for hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, exacerbation\nor onset of diabetes, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol levels\n(7,8,29-33). Other associated conditions of obesity include low self-\nesteem, which increases the likelihood of high-risk behaviors that\ncan worsen underlying mental health conditions (11).\nFIGURE 1 Prevalence of obesity and rate of physician identification\nFIGURE 2 Frequency of diet or physical activity counseling at pediatric ambulatory\nTABLE 3 Independent predictors of cardiometabolic\ncomplication (CVM) among children and adolescents 2-17\nVariable Adjusted OR 95% CI\nEthnicity\nNon-Hispanic (referent)\nGender\nMale (referent)\nAge\nBMI >85th percentile (overweight or obese)\nNo (referent)\nObesogenic psychotropic medication\nNo (referent)\nOriginal Article Obesity\nFor children who require psychotropic medication, the excess weight\ngain and the burden of disease associated with obesity signal an ur-\ngency to examine provider counseling practices. When healthcare\nproviders prescribe psychotropic medications with known influences\non weight, the patient should receive preemptive counseling prior to\ninitiation and during treatment. Lifestyle counseling remains the first\nline of defense for addressing excess weight gain. Although health-\ncare providers sometimes perceive lifestyle counseling as ineffective\n(24), studies have shown healthcare providers can be effective\nagents for change (34,35). Overweight adolescents who are coun-\nseled by their physician report attempting weight loss strategies at\nrates similar to recommendations (35). Families also look to physi-\ncians as a primary resource for addressing weight concerns (36).\nHowever, the efficacy of counseling for psychotropic-induced\nweight gain in an ambulatory setting to reduce or prevent obesity in\nA possible barrier for lifestyle counseling at office visits is the lack\nof reimbursement for obesity-related services (37), especially as\ncounseling for a potential side effect that is yet to occur does not\nusually qualify as a stand-alone billable office visit diagnosis. When\npreemptive counseling is provided at visits for medication monitor-\ning, a modifier code can be used to indicate the additional preven-\ntive care provided depending on the scope of the counseling.\nAlternatively, lifestyle counseling can be coded and billed under the\ndiagnostic code of ``abnormal weight gain'' (ICD-9 code 783.1) in\naddition to the mental health diagnostic code if the child has demon-\nstrated weight gain because of the medication.\nThere are limitations to our study. The cross-sectional nature of the\nstudy design precludes our ability to access care provided over time\nto an individual patient; thus, it is conceivable that obesity or coun-\nseling has been identified at a prior visit. Although the NAMCS/\nNHAMCS form is completed independent of billing, our estimates\nof obesity recognition and counseling may be conservative as low\nreimbursement rates for the diagnosis of obesity may decrease the\nlikelihood of a physician coding for obesity. Despite these limita-\ntions, the study has several strengths. In using a large nationally rep-\nresentative sample of pediatric office visits, we offer some insight\non management of obesity in a vulnerable segment of children in\nthe United States. Including data from the outpatient clinics in the\nNHAMCS allowed us to capture a broader spectrum of ambulatory\ncare visits than those that occur only in the physician's office, pro-\nviding a more representative national sample.\nIn summary, our findings suggest poor recognition and counseling for\nobesity for all children regardless of whether they are on psychotropic\nmedication. That healthcare providers identify obesity most often in\nchildren on obesogenic medications is encouraging and an area for\nfurther study. We need to investigate the challenges to instituting\npreventive counseling on a consistent basis when any psychotropic\nmedications, especially second-generation antipsychotics are pre-\nscribed for children. This is particularly relevant given diagnostic\ncriteria for psychotropic-induced weight gain includes children who\nmay not yet have a BMI above the 85th percentile, the trigger for a\ndiagnosis of obesity (19). Finally, this study provides national and\ngeneralizeable baseline data on which to track physician practice pat-\nterns in managing children on psychotropic medications over time.O\nV\nReferences\n1.
