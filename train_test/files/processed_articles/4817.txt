    "abstract": "Abstract\nUncertainty threats can cause a wide range of compensatory responses.The present research demonstrates how uncertainty\nthreat can cause a particular response with significant social consequences: stereotyping. Participants in this study completed\na measure of implicit stereotyping after being exposed to an uncertainty threat or not.They also completed an individual\ndifference measure to tap into their needs for predictability and structure. Results showed that uncertainty threat caused\nincreased stereotyping of an ethnic out-group when needs for predictability and structure were high.For participants who did\nnot have a high level of these needs, uncertainty did not increase stereotyping.When uncertainty threatens important goals\nsuch as prediction and control of events, individuals who most value these goals seem to be the ones who are most likely to\nuse stereotypes.These stereotypes, ironically, may reduce the success of accurate event prediction for the very people who\nplace the greatest value on predictability and structure.\n",

Uncertainty threats\nhave been shown to increase conviction in important social\nattitudes (McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, & Spencer, 2001), to\npursue personal projects that are more consistent with one's\nvalues (McGregor et al., 2001), to increase identification\nwith minimal groups (Grieve & Hogg, 1999), and to increase\nnegative responses when fair process is denied (van den Bos,\n2001). Uncertainty has even been shown to increase claimed\nreligiosity (Wichman, 2010) and support for religious war\namong otherwise relatively liberal students (McGregor, Haji,\nThese compensatory responses to uncertainty seem to be\nat odds with the intuitive meaning of uncertainty. Intuitively,\nuncertainty should make people careful information proces-\nsors; it could also weaken and might even negate whatever\ncontents of mind are active at that time. For instance, a per-\nson who is uncertain and attempting to reach a decision\nmight continue to deliberate past the point where other peo-\nple would be satisfied. Indeed, research shows that both\nchronically accessible and situationally activated uncertainty\ncan cause such effects (Jacobson, Weary, & Lin, 2008).\nAdditional research demonstrates that uncertainty can reduce\nparticipants' use of social category information, and thus\nreduce stereotyping, when they make judgments about oth-\ners (Weary, Jacobson, Edwards, & Tobin, 2001). Yet other\nresearch shows that situationally induced uncertainty can\nreduce source effects on persuasion, reducing source-\nstereotype-consistent judgments (Tiedens & Linton, 2001).\nThese findings seemingly contradict data showing increased\nintolerance for others when uncertainty is induced (van den\nBos, Euwema, Poortvliet, & Maas, 2007), or increased religi-\nosity (Wichman, 2010) when uncertainty is induced.\nUncertainty, from an intuitive perspective, should reduce intol-\nerance, and possibly reduce religiosity, not increase it.\nFortunately, recent research suggests an answer to this\ncontradiction. When uncertainty is situationally induced,\npeople seem to show compensatory responses to the extent\nthat uncertainty threatens, or signals frustration with, their\ncurrently active goals (Nash, McGregor, & Prentice, 2011).\nIn much of the previous research showing increased process-\ning or reduced reliance on stereotypes when uncertainty is\nactive, the uncertainty may not have frustrated an active goal.\nFor instance, in work demonstrating how uncertainty reduces\nreliance on source stereotypes for persuasion (Tiedens &\nLinton, 2001), uncertainty was induced by evoking emotions.\n1Western Kentucky University, Bowling Green, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAaron Wichman, Department of Psychology,Western Kentucky University,\nEmail: wichmana@gmail.com\nUncertaintyThreat Can Cause\nStereotyping:The Moderating\nRole of Personal Need for Structure\nAaron L.Wichman1\n Keywords\nuncertainty, compensatory conviction, threat, worldview defense, stereotyping\n2 SAGE Open\nThis type of uncertainty did not obviously threaten partici-\npants' active goals.\nIn work by Weary and colleagues (2001), uncertainty\nabout the causes of events may have been perceived as more\nthreatening, but participants may have been able to access\nand then apply stored uncertainty-coping action plans and\nthus avoided compensatory responding. The best-studied\naction plan in response to uncertainty about the causes of\nevents is increased processing in the service of attaining\njudgment accuracy (see Weary, Tobin, & Edwards, 2010 for\na review). Therefore, previous research may not have shown\nuncertainty to increase stereotyping due to factors such as\nthe uncertainty not being threatening to active goals (e.g.,\nTiedens & Linton, 2001), or habitual increased processing\ntriggered in conjunction with uncertainty about the causes of\nevents. If uncertainty was seen as a threat to active goals, or\nif uncertainty was activated in a context that did not make\nincreased processing action plans accessible (or applicable;\ncf. Higgins & Brendl, 1995), uncertainty might no longer be\nassociated with reduced stereotyping. In fact, uncertainty\nmight trigger compensatory responses such as those dis-\ncussed above when it is seen as a signal of a frustrated goal.\nResponses to goal frustration always are a joint function\nof the person and situation, which can both either amplify or\nattenuate responses. The individual difference of personal\nneed for structure (PNS; Neuberg & Newsom, 1993) is one\nexample of a person factor that interacts with situations in\naffecting judgments and behavior. PNS is a measure of pref-\nerence for clear structure, order, and certainty in the world.\nThese preferences seem to be more strongly expressed when\npeople are exposed to signals that their goals might be frus-\ntrated. For instance, Terror Management Theory researchers\nhave demonstrated that when high PNS individuals are\nreminded of their mortality (presumably a signal that their\ngoals ultimately will be frustrated), compared with low PNS\nindividuals, high PNS individuals show increased percep-\ntions of meaning in their lives (Vess, Routledge, Landau, &\nArndt, 2009), increased preference for interpersonal balance\nand just-world thinking, but decreased liking for behaviorally\ninconsistent targets (Landau et al., 2004). Of special interest,\na PNS-related variable, Need for Closure (NFC; Kruglanski,\nWebster, & Klem, 1993), has been shown to interact with\nreminders of death such that higher NFC, compared with low\nNFC, is associated with greater (less) liking for stereotype-\nconsistent (inconsistent) targets. Importantly, NFC affected\nliking this way only under conditions where participants had\nbeen reminded of their mortality (Schimel et al., 1999). All\nof these findings are consistent with need for structure as a\nperson factor that moderates responses to signals that goals\nmay be frustrated.\nOne way to think about uncertainty is that it can threaten\nour goals to predict, organize, and control events. Because\nPNS predicts preference for predictability and order, it is logi-\ncal to assume that people high, compared with low, in PNS\nwould react more strongly to experiences that threatened\ntheir sense of predictability, certainty, or control. Uncertainty\nthreat is one such experience. The current study investigated\nwhether uncertainty about the causes of events would cause\nincreased threat responding among higher PNS individuals.\nResponses to psychological threat have been examined in\nmany forms. Preference for arguments that do or do not\nuphold one's worldview (Lavine, Lodge, & Freitas, 2005),\nliking for charismatic political candidates (Gillath & Hart,\n2010), attitudes toward essay writers who criticize one's in-\ngroup or not (Arndt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &\nSimon, 1997), conviction in important social attitudes\n(McGregor et al., 2001), reactions to fairness violations (van\nden Bos, 2001), identification with potentially extremist\ngroups (Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis, Maitner, & Moffitt,\n2007), and others, all have been examined.\nThe current research examined how uncertainty threat, in\nconjunction with PNS, might affect stereotyping. The PNS\nboth allowed for the identification of individuals who should\nbe more threatened by this uncertainty, and suggested how\nthese individuals might react to this psychological threat. As\na general hypothesis, people high in PNS under uncertainty\nwere expected to respond by attempting to impose order on\ntheir environment, in this case, by stereotyping. People high\nin PNS should experience the uncertainty threat as more rel-\nevant to their desires for order and structure, and might\nrespond by affirming the very desires for order and structure\nthreatened by the uncertainty. More specifically, people\nhigher, as opposed to lower, in PNS were expected to show\nincreased stereotyping under uncertainty, using a measure of\nimplicit stereotyping described below.\nMethod\nParticipants completed packets as part of a voluntary class\nproject. Participation was anonymous, and participants were\nrandomly assigned to condition. After first indicating their\nethnicity and gender, participants completed a measure of\ntheir desire for predictability and order. They then went on\nto complete either an uncertainty or control induction, fol-\nlowed by a filler task, and ultimately the measure of implicit\nstereotyping, which they subsequently scored themselves. A\ndebriefing followed.\nMaterials\nPNS scale. The PNS scale (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993)\nserved as an index of participants'desire for control, predict-\nitems, such as \"It upsets me to go into a situation without\nknowing what I can expect from it.\" And \"I don't like situa-\ntions that are uncertain.\" Items were answered on a 1 =\nstrongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree scale. People scoring\nhigher on this scale prefer to organize information in simple\nways and are more likely to stereotype than those low on this\nUncertainty manipulation. Uncertainty condition partici-\npants responded to the following two questions, based on\nprevious work by van den Bos (2001) and Wichman, Brun-\nner, and Weary (2008): \"Please briefly describe the thoughts\nthat you have when you are uncertain about why something\nhas happened\" and \"Please jot down, as specifically as you\ncan, what you think physically and emotionally happens to\nyou when you feel uncertain about why something has hap-\npened.\" These questions were designed to activate uncer-\ntainty about why things happen, and to threaten needs for\nstructure and control as measured by the PNS. Control con-\ndition participants answered parallel questions about watch-\ning TV.\nFiller task. All participants completed the PANAS-X\naffect measure (Watson & Clark, 1994) as a filler task. Pre-\nvious research has shown that uncertainty effects often\noccur only once a delay period has passed (e.g., Wichman et al.,\n2008). The PANAS-X provided for this delay.\nDependent measure. Participants completed the stereotypic\nexplanatory bias (SEB; Sekaquaptewa, Espinoza, Thompson,\nVargas, & von Hippel, 2003) measure to index implicit stereo-\ntyping. The SEB presents participants withAfrican- and Euro-\npeanAmericanstereotype-consistentorstereotype-inconsistent\nsentence stems. Participants then complete the stem as they\nwish to make a complete sentence. For instance, an African\nAmericanstereotype-consistentsentencewouldbe\"DeShawn\npurchased some baggy pants,\" whereas a stereotype-\ninconsistent stem would be \"Jamal was the only student who\nanswered the problem.\" Stereotypically African American\nand European American names were counterbalanced across\nsentence stem type so that in one counterbalance condition, a\nstem might beAfricanAmerican stereotype consistent, but in\nthe other counterbalance condition, a stereotypic European\nAmerican name was used to make the sentence appear incon-\nsistent with European American stereotypes. A number of\nneutral filler items were included to reduce suspicion as to\nthe nature of the task (see Appendix A for the sentence stems\nused in this task).\nTo the extent that participants endorse stereotypes as a\nway to make sense of the world, stereotype-inconsistent\nbehaviors described in sentence stems should elicit expla-\nnations. According to Sekaquaptewa et al. (2003), the\nexplanatory bias occurs when participants are more likely\nto explain stereotype-inconsistent behaviors than they are\nto explain stereotype-consistent behaviors (see also Hastie,\n1984). Therefore, a response to the above sentence about\nDeShawn's pants reading, \"and went out with his friends\"\n(no explanation of a stereotype-consistent behavior), and\ncompleting the sentence about Jamal with \"because he had\ntaken advantage of tutoring help\" (explanation of a stereo-\ntype-inconsistent behavior) would be interpreted as stereo-\ntyping. The SEB measure is scored by counting the number\nof explanatory versus nonexplanatory sentence completions\nfor stereotype-consistent and -inconsistent behaviors, then\nsubtracting the number of stereotype-consistent behaviors\nexplained from the number of stereotype-inconsistent\nbehaviors explained (see Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003;\nSekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004, for greater detail on\nscoring the SEB). To the extent that participants explain\nstereotype-inconsistent behaviors, but do not explain stereo-\ntype-consistent behaviors, this is interpreted as stereotyping\n(Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003). Previous research shows that\nparticipants showing stronger SEB ask more stereotypic\nquestions when interacting with an out-group member\n(Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003). The SEB is thus a measure of\nthe extent to which people use stereotypes to interpret\ntheir world. Explanations in the SEB are an indicator of\nthe perceived inadequacy of the preferred, stereotype-\ndriven, processing style, and thus are thought to reflect\nstereotype usage. As might be expected for a stereotyping\nmeasure, research shows that the SEB predicts discrimi-\nnation when participants are interacting with an out-group\nAfter completing the sentences, participants were asked\nto indicate for each sentence completion whether it in some\nway explained why the behavior described in the sentence\nstem occurred (see Appendix B for these instructions).\nParticipants' ratings then were used to compute SEB scores,\nas described below.\nResults\nA total of 75 participants (61 female) completed the experi-\nmental materials anonymously and voluntarily. Of the 75\nparticipants, 53 were European American, 14 were African\nAmerican, 5 were Hispanic American, and 2 were Asian\nAmerican. Previous research shows that the SEB is more\nsensitive to stereotyping when targets are low-status group\nmembers, as opposed to high-status group members\n(Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004). To capitalize on this sen-\nsitivity and to avoid difficulties with the smaller samples of\nnon-European Americans, analyses focused on the responses\nof the higher (in the United States) group status European\nAmericans.\nTo begin, PNS items were rescored and averaged so that\nhigher scores indicated greater need for structure (Cronbach's\nwas examined next. Uncertainty induction condition had no\neffect on general negative or general positive affect (respec-\nThe SEB was scored by using participants' ratings of\nwhether their sentence completions were explanations of the\nbehavior described in the sentence stem. As in previous\nresearch (e.g., Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003), two SEB scores\nwere computed for each person. SEB scores for African\nAmerican and European American targets were separately\ncreated by subtracting for each ethnic group the number of\nexplanations for stereotype-consistent behaviors from the\nnumber of explanations for stereotype-inconsistent behaviors.\n4 SAGE Open\nHigher values on the SEB score therefore meant higher lev-\nels of implicit stereotyping (SEB\nBlackTarget\nWhiteTarget\ntwo SEB scores then were checked to see if they differed\nacross counterbalancing condition. As expected, counter-\nbalancing of stereotypically African- and European\nAmerican names had no effect on SEB scores, t\nBlackSEB\nWhiteSEB\nCounterbalance condition was not further considered as a\nfactor.\nTo investigate the main hypothesis, PNS scores first were\nstandardized, and uncertainty condition was dummy coded\n(uncertainty was the comparison condition, coded 0). SEB\nscores then separately were regressed onto these variables\nand their interaction. For African American targets, this anal-\nysis showed a PNS by uncertainty interaction,  = -1.09, t\npartial\n= .17. This interaction was\nplotted at \u00b11 SD on the PNS distribution (cf. Aiken & West,\n1991) and is depicted in Figure 1. Simple slopes tests (Aiken\n& West, 1991) showed that whereas PNS was nonsignifi-\ncantly negatively associated with SEB scores for Black tar-\npartial\n= .17, it positively and significantly predicted\nSEB for Black targets in the uncertainty condition,  =\npartial\nwhereas uncertainty condition had no significant effects for\npartial\n= .02, as PNS scores increased to +1 SD, the uncer-\ntainty induction as compared with the control group showed\npartial\nThis finding that uncertainty increased explanations rela-\ntively more for stereotype-inconsistent than stereotype-con-\nsistent sentences shows that uncertainty in this case does not\nsimply increase people's tendency to explain events. Instead,\nuncertainty in this case specifically increased explanations\nwhen behaviors were stereotype inconsistent, indicating that\nuncertainty increased the use of stereotype-consistent expec-\ntancies for behavior.\nSEB scores for European American targets also were\ncoded as described above and regressed onto uncertainty\ncondition, PNS, and their interaction. Unlike SEB scores for\nAfrican American targets, there were no significant effects\nfor European American SEB scores (all ps > .20). Whereas\nuncertainty threat interacted with PNS to predict increased\nstereotyping of African American targets, it did not do so for\nEuropean American targets. This finding is consistent with\nprevious research (e.g., Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004),\nbut also has some possible implications, which are described\nbelow.\nDiscussion\nThese findings provide evidence that uncertainty threats can\nincrease stereotyping. They add to the many effects that\npreviously have been linked to uncertainty threats, and\ndemonstrate how PNS can amplify responses to such\nthreats. When exposed to uncertainty, high PNS individuals\nexplained more counterstereotypic behaviors for stereo-\ntypic African American names. This effect was not found for\nstereotypically European American names.\nAlthough some previous research has found that PNS\nis positively associated with stereotyping in general\n(Neuberg & Newsom, 1993), PNS scores in the control\ncondition for African American targets were nonsignifi-\ncantly negatively associated with stereotyping. This trend\nwas unexpected, but other researchers have discovered a\nsimilar trend. Conceptually, consistent with the relation-\nship between PNS and stereotyping under uncertainty\nthreat as reported here, Schimel et al. (1999; Study 5)\nfound that NFC (Kruglanski, Webster, & Klem, 1993)\npositively predicted liking (dislike) for stereotype-\nconsistent (-inconsistent) targets under psychological\nthreat conditions induced using mortality salience.\nHowever, also conceptually consistent with the (nonsig-\nnificant) relationship between PNS and stereotyping in\nthe control condition reported here, they found that NFC\n(nonsignificantly) negatively predicted liking (dislike) for\nstereotype-consistent (-inconsistent) targets. The meaning\nof these trends in the control conditions of these studies is\nunclear, but these trends in no way detract from the essen-\ntial finding: It appears that uncertainty threats sometimes\ncan cause stereotyping.\nOne might expect that uncertainty threat, as a threat to\nprediction and control needs, would increase attempts to\nexplain all types of events and behaviors, rather than only\nstereotypically inconsistent behaviors performed by out-\ngroup members. The fact that stereotyping under uncertainty\nSEB Score\nLow PNS (-1 SD)\nUncertainty\nCondion\nTV Condion\nHigh PNS (+1 SD)\nFigure 1. Effects of uncertainty threat and PNS on implicit\nstereotyping. Larger values indicate more stereotyping\nNote:PNS = personal need for structure;SEB = stereotypic explanatory bias.\nthreat was confined to out-group members suggests some\nsocial motivation for this effect.\nThis finding can be interpreted in a number of ways. One\ninterpretation is that prediction and control needs are espe-\ncially important when thinking about out-groups, whose\nbehaviors demand explanation so that intergroup relations\ncan function smoothly. This is consistent with evidence\nshowing that we are more likely to remember stereotype-\nconsistent out-group behaviors than we are to remember\nstereotype-consistent in-group behaviors (Koomen &\nDijker, 1997). In this case, stereotype consistency appears\nto be more important for out-groups than in-groups. Phrased\ndifferently, possibly threatening out-groups who behave in\nstereotype-consistent ways are predictable; stereotype-\ninconsistent behavior demands explanation if we wish to\nmaintain predictive control.\nAnother interpretation is that those participants most\nstrongly under psychological threat (those with higher PNS\nscores) felt the need to adhere to (for them) socially domi-\nnant worldviews. These worldviews codify the stigmatiza-\ntion of some out-groups by embedding them in a matrix of\nstereotypically prescribed behaviors. Stereotype-inconsistent\nbehaviors, then, break free of the matrix and threaten the\nworldviews that participants normally would rely on to main-\ntain predictive control. This interpretation of the role of\nuncertainty threat is broadly consistent with Kay and Friesen's\n(2011) work on how the status quo of social systems tends to\nbe upheld more strongly under conditions of low personal\ncontrol. The uncertainty threat used here was designed to\nchallenge prediction and control beliefs, and may have caused\nincreased out-group stereotyping for this reason.\nAlthough these explanations are plausible, work with\nthe SEB has shown that the stereotype explanatory bias is\nmost likely to occur for low-status targets. That is, when\ntargets are described as low status (opposed to high sta-\ntus), SEB scores are higher (Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza,\n2004). Uncertainty threat is therefore clearly only one of a\nnumber of factors contributing to stereotyping on this\nmeasure in this case. Future research might investigate\nwhether uncertainty threats cause differential stereotyping\non other measures, such as the implicit association task\n(Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Another ave-\nnue for future research could be whether uncertainty\nthreat can even increase stereotype-consistent behavior\npredictions based on photographs of targets from different\ngroups. In considering what these different groups might\nbe, it could be useful to investigate the generalizability of\nthis effect to other social categories--to religion, gender,\nand perhaps age.\nAlong with the other studies demonstrating compensatory\nresponses to uncertainty threat in areas as varied as fairness\nresearch (van den Bos, 2001) and in-group bias work (Hogg\net al., 2007), these results add to our understanding of the\nmany forms compensatory responses to uncertainty threat\ncan take. They also increase our knowledge of how individ-\nual difference factors can operate in conjunction with envi-\nronmental factors to amplify and channel our responses.\nPeople vary in their needs for structure, predictability, and\ncontrol. In situations where uncertainty is frequent, such as\nscientific research, investing, or intergroup conflict, high\nneeds for structure may cause overreliance on established\nways of thinking. To the extent to which uncertainty stems\nfrom established ways of thinking to begin with, this overreli-\nance may trigger a vicious cycle of ever-more rigid thinking.\nThere is a need to better understand how cycles like this\ncan be controlled. Some existing work (e.g., Wichman,\n2010) provides insight into this, but more work is needed.\nThe present research suggests that low needs for structure\nmay protect against uncertainty that targets our perceptions\nof being able to predict and structure our worlds. Prediction\nand control are important motives, but if we care about them\ntoo much, we lose our ability to respond flexibly when we\nare threatened.\nAppendix A\nSEB Materials\nParticipants were asked to complete the following materi-\nals.
