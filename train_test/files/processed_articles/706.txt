Nevertheless, earlier retirement is an issue for\npublic programs because it reduces the earnings base\nthat supports Social Security and Medicare spending\nfor older retirees.\nEarly economic research addressing the determi-\nnants of retirement interviewed retirees to examine\nwhy they retired when they did (Quinn, Burkhauser,\n& Myers, 1990). Researchers gathered subjective re-\nsponses and were forced to conclude that retirement\nincentives were not a factor because they were rarely\nmentioned. As a result, recent research has focused\non objective measures of retirement behavior by\nfocusing on how retirees behaved. Overall, most re-\ncent research shows that economic incentives to\nretire play an important role in retirement decisions.\nAnother way to explore whether economic incen-\ntives play a role in retirement is by examining the\nworkers' intended retirement patterns. With the ex-\nception of Anderson, Burkhauser, and Quinn (1986),\nEkerdt, DeViney, and Kosloski (1996), Hall and John-\nson (1980), Holtmann, Ullmann, Fronstin, and Longino\nrecent research focusing on workers' expected retire-\nment patterns. Even the previously mentioned studies\ndo not focus on the economic incentives of employee\nbenefits.\nEmployers and policy makers are interested in reli-\nable forecasts of future retirement patterns because\nthey are important in formulating both employment\npolicy and public policy. For example, will the up-\ncoming increases in the eligibility age for full Social\nSecurity benefits have the expected effect of in-\ncreasing the labor force participation of older work-\ners? Ultimately, the retirement process may be better\nunderstood by examining workers' retirement expec-\ntations at a moment in time, what affects those ex-\npectations, and how those expectations may change\nover time as workers gather additional information on\nSocial Security benefits, potential pension income, and\nretiree health benefits. This approach is in contrast\nto taking a \"look back\" at eventual behavior where\nresearchers are inevitably forced to rely on the un-\ncertain memories of retirees who may have retired\n10-15 years prior to data collection. An examination\nof retirement outcomes leave the process of retire-\nment and retirement decisions unobserved. In fact, pre-\nvious research has shown that survey responses on re-\ntirement expectations are reliable predictors of future\nretirement, conditional on the information that was\navailable at the time that individuals were planning\nThis article examines early retirement decisions and\nhow they relate to employee benefits. This article im-\nproves upon previous research in a number of ways.\nFirst, I take full advantage of data on postretirement\nemployee benefits. Previous studies examining the role\nbetween early retirement and employee benefits have\nnot fully utilized the data. For example, Ekerdt and\nRetirement Study (HRS) but did not examine different\ntypes and combinations of pension plans, and did not\ninclude retiree health benefits in their analysis. Hurd\nand McGarry (1993) also used data from the HRS but\nused an outcome variable that measured the prob-\nability of working full-time past age 62, which does\nnot fully account for complete withdrawal from the\nlabor force. Hall and Johnson (1980) used data from\nthe 1969 Retirement History Study, and Holtmann and\nIncome and Program Participation.\nThe next section presents the rationale for the ef-\nfects of economic incentives on early retirement deci-\nsions. The following section presents data from the\n1992 Health and Retirement Study concerning how\nemployee benefits influence workers' expected retire-\nment patterns. The last section discusses public policy\nimplications.\nMethods\nTheoretical Considerations\nThe job-stopping process generally is initiated by\nthe termination of career employment and frequently\nincludes periods of postcareer employment, part-time\nwork, partial retirement, and temporary retirement\n(Ruhm, 1991). Previous research has established that\nretirement can be defined as a process, instead of a\nsingle event (Quinn & Kozy, 1996). Workers often use\none or more transitional stages, or bridge jobs, be-\ntween their career job and complete withdrawal from\nthe labor force. One common transitional stage is the\nmovement from full-time work to part-time work. This\nusually occurs for wage and salary workers when they\nswitch jobs, but it also may occur for workers in their\ncurrent jobs.\nThe process of retirement varies with individual pref-\nerences, predicted future earnings, pension accruals,\nSocial Security benefits, health, and preferences for\nleisure. A person's job-stopping process and subsequent\nchoice of retirement age (defined here as his or her\ncomplete withdrawal from the labor force) may be\nmade by weighing the combined benefits of the wages\nfrom continuing to work and the potential increase in\nfuture income from accruing greater pension benefits\nagainst the costs of forgoing the increased leisure of\nretirement and the cost of forgoing future pension ac-\ncruals. To be realistic, the decision should account for\nrisks, including uncertain future income, inflation, and\npremature death. Testing whether people account for\nthese risks, however, would be mathematically diffi-\nHealth insurance coverage also might help explain\nthe retirement process. Employer-sponsored health\ninsurance for individuals not participating in the labor\nforce can be a significant source of income security\nfor early retirees, because Medicare, the federal\nhealth insurance for retirees, is not available to people\nyounger than age 65 unless they are disabled. Although\nearly retirees as a group are probably healthier than\nthose ages 65 and older, the risk of medical need in-\ncreases with age. Early retirees without health insur-\nance may be vulnerable to costly medical expenses.\nIndividually purchased health insurance policies can\nbe expensive, may restrict coverage for certain ser-\nvices, and may be unavailable for persons with pre-\nexisting conditions who lack prior creditable health\ninsurance coverage. Group health insurance through\nan employer is usually the most affordable source of\nhealth insurance coverage for early retirees and may\nbe an important variable in the retirement decision.\nRetiree Health Insurance.--An Employee Benefit\nResearch Institute (EBRI) public opinion poll indicates\nthat there is a direct link between a worker's deci-\nsion to retire early and the availability of retiree health\nported that they would not retire before becoming\neligible for Medicare if their employer did not pro-\nvide retiree health benefits. Yet the same survey\nshows that 45% plan to retire before age 65. The sur-\nvey also found tnat 82% of the respondents believed\nthey would need additional health insurance cover-\nage beyond what is provided by the Medicare pro-\ngram, and 47% expected their former employer to\nprovide retiree health insurance.\nThe rationale for why availability of retiree health\ninsurance should affect the retirement process is\nstraightforward, as noted by Madrian (1994). There is\na direct link between labor force participation and\nhealth insurance coverage. Almost 75% of wage and\nsalary workers ages 18-64, have employment-based\nhealth insurance coverage (Fronstin, 1996). This in-\nsurance is portable into retirement only in the sense\nthat some workers have the option of continuing their\ncoverage under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Rec-\nonciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), which requires em-\nployers with 20 or more workers to offer continued\naccess to group health insurance coverage to quali-\nfied beneficiaries for up to 18 months. Otherwise,\nwithout the availability of retiree health insurance,\nretirees may not have access to health insurance cov-\nerage until age 65, though some may have access to\n38 The Gerontologist\ninsurance through a spouse. Although some workers\nhave access to retiree health insurance, most do not\nhave it or even know if they would have coverage if\nthey retired. For example, previous research found that\n34% of workers aged 45 or older worked for an em-\nployer that sponsored retiree health insurance either\nthroughout tneir retirement (29%) or only until age\nported that retiree health insurance was unavailable,\n21% did not respond to the question or did not know\nthe answer, and 30% did not have access to health\ninsurance through their employer. If one assumes that\nthe 21% who did not know the answer or did not\nrespond to the question do not have access to retiree\nhealth insurance, then 66% of workers aged 45 or\nolder do not have access to retiree health insurance.\nWorkers considering leaving the labor force early\ncould obtain health insurance prior to becoming eli-\ngible for Medicare either through a spouse or the pri-\nvate market for insurance. However, purchasing health\ninsurance in the private market may not be afford-\nable. Employers that provide access to group health\ninsurance often are able to obtain lower premiums\nthan individuals can because insurance companies\nspread risk across a larger group of people, and the\naverage administrative costs are lower. In addition, the\nneed for health insurance increases with age (Mad-\nrian, 1994). Older individuals are relatively more likely\nto be in fair or poor health, they are more likely to\nreport having been diagnosed with a serious health\ncondition, and they spend a greater proportion of their\nfamily income on medical expenses. As a result, lack\nof health insurance during retirement could be an im-\npediment to leaving the labor force prior to age 65.\nEmployment-Based Pension Plans.--Employment-\nbased pension plans can facilitate or encourage work-\ners' withdrawal from the labor force, including some\nworkers who may not yet be eligible for Social Secu-\nrity benefits. From a conceptual perspective, employer\npensions may be thought of as falling into one of two\ncategories: defined contribution and defined benefit\nplans. Defined contribution plans create different eco-\nnomic incentives than defined benefit plans. From the\nperspective of the employee, the defined contribu-\ntion plan is essentially a savings vehicle and provides\nno incentive to leave the labor force at any particular\nage. The defined contribution account allows a worker\nto accumulate assets that may be sufficient to support\nlabor force withdrawal at an early age, but the worker\nneed not attain any particular age to use those assets\nin retirement.\nAlthough defined contribution plans have no in-\ntrinsic retirement age, the differing tax treatment of\nbenefits from defined contribution plans at different\nages may influence the retirement process. Defined\ncontribution plans commonly distribute assets to their\nparticipants in the form of lump-sum distributions.\nBefore age 591/2 the recipient may be subject to a\n10% penalty tax on the lump sum (in addition to regu-\nlar income tax). Therefore, participants planning to\ntake such distribution may have an incentive to delay\nthe distribution of assets until age 59V2. On the other\nhand, the defined contribution plan participant can\navoid the penalty by rolling the distribution into a quali-\nfied annuity rather than receiving it as a lump sum.\nMoreover, the penalty tax may be circumvented by\ntaking distributions that are part of a series of substan-\ntially equal periodic payments made for the life (or\nlife expectancy) of the employee or the joint lives (or\njoint life expectancies) of the employee and his or\nher beneficiary.\nIn a defined contribution plan, the employer may\nmake a specified periodic contribution to the employee's\npension account. Some plans accept or may even re-\nquire employees' contributions as a condition of par-\nticipation in the plan. Investment gains or losses in\nthe plan are credited to the employee's account; the\nemployer bears no investment risk. Once vested, the\nvalue of employees' pension assets is not contingent\non how long they remain with the firm. As long as\nemployees actively participate in the plan, they can\ncontinue to accumulate assets.\nDefined benefit plans typically promise a specified\nbenefit on retirement from a job, usually based on\nthe employee's earnings and length of service, for the\nlife of the employee or surviving spouse. Because in-\ncreases in the employee's salary with continued work\ncan raise the amount of pension benefits attributable\nto past service, the value of pension benefits accrued\neach year increases as the worker approaches the\nearliest age for reduced retirement benefits, a phe-\nnomenon known as \"backloading,\" though a career-\naverage plan instead of a final-salary plan substantially\nreduces this effect (Clark & McDermed, 1988). How-\never, in most pension plans there is a typical age\nwhere pension wealth is at a maximum and contin-\nued work, especially into late ages, triggers a reduc-\ntion in the present value of pension wealth from con-\nTypically, employer plans calculate early retirement\nbenefits as a percentage of the accrued pension ben-\nefit that would have been paid at the normal retire-\nment date. The pension benefit is actuarially reduced\nto reflect the participant's longer benefit payout pe-\nriod and lost investment earnings on plan assets. Dur-\ning the interval between the plan's early retirement\nage and the normal retirement age, employers often\nadjust the pension benefit in a more or less economi-\ncally fair way (Ippolito, 1997). A fair actuarial reduc-\ntion gives full recognition to the longer payout period\nand lost investment earnings (Allen, Melone, Rosen-\nbloom & VanDerhei, 1992). However, once the worker\nreaches the normal retirement age, which may or may\nnot be before age 65, the worker is penalized for each\nadditional year of work.\nDuring limited \"window periods,\" employers may\noffer enhanced retirement benefits to encourage early\nretirement to reduce the size of their work force. Casn\nbonuses, additional age and service credits, and con-\ntinued insurance benefits may be offered to employ-\nees who retire early.\nSocial Security.--Some analysts argue that the struc-\nture of Social Security benefits creates incentives for\nearly retirement (Betley, 1990). The Social Security\nbenefit received at retirement depends on age and\nearnings received in the highest-paid years of work.\nCurrently, at age 62, covered workers can elect to\nreceive 80% of the full retirement benefit available at\nage 65. For each month after age 62 that a worker\npostpones benefits, the reduction of 20% decreases\naddition, the credit for delayed retirement will increase\nfor each year the initial benefit is postponed up to\nage 70. Tnis structure results in an incentive to leave\nthe labor force at ages 62 and 65, and offers little\nincentive to leave the labor force between ages 62\nand 65, but then it creates a big disincentive to work\nAlthough it should be noted that very few workers\nare average, and life expectancy and rates of time\npreference will either create an incentive or disincen-\ntive to continue working past ages 62 and 65, a re-\ncent study, which includes a review of the literature,\nsuggests that subjective survival probabilities show\nconsiderable promise for estimating models of de-\ncision making under uncertainty (Hurd & McGarry,\n1995). This would imply that the average worker will\napply a given set of rules to his or her own personal\ncircumstances. Specifically, this implies that retirement\nexpectations are reliable predictors of future retire-\nment, conditional on the information that was avail-\nable at the time that individuals were planning their\nretirement process.\nAnother disincentive to continue working is the\n\"earnings test.\" Social Security benefits of beneficia-\nries ages 65-69 are reduced by one dollar for every\nthree dollars of earnings that exceeds an annual limit\nincomes, Social Security benefits, and savings may not\nhave incentives to work anyway, and analysts believe\nthat the earnings test by itself has a limited effect on\nwork effort. However, a relatively small group of retir-\nees (about 2% of retirees ages 65-69) appear to limit\ntheir work effort to avoid losing Social Security ben-\nefits. These people are most likely to increase their\nhours of work as a result of a change in the earnings\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1983 will in-\ncrease the normal retirement age incrementally from\nment benefits payable at age 62 from 80% of the full\nretirement benefit to 70%, and increase the credit for\ndelayed retirement by one-half of one percentage point\nevery other year, or from 3% to 8% per year after the\n/ear 2007. Although these changes make the Social\nSecurity benefit formula actuarially more fair, analysts\nhave estimated that they are of insufficient magnitude\nto have a major effect on retirement decisions (Fields\nData\nThe Health and Retirement Study (HRS) allows\nresearchers to examine the role of the economic in-\ncentives of employee benefits on retirement patterns.\nThe HRS, originally conducted in 1992, is a national\nongitudinal study focusing on individuals born be-\neligible population was between the ages of 51 and\n61 at the beginning of the study. A total sample of\nmore than 9,000 age-eligible respondents were in-\nterviewed in 1992 and they will be followed and re-\ninterviewed in future years to study their retirement\npatterns. In addition, the survey collected data on de-\nmographics, physical health, housing and mobility,\nfamily structure, current and past employment, retire-\nment plans, income, and insurance.\nBecause the focus of this article is on retirement ex-\npectations, the sample is limited to non-self-employed\nworkers. Individuals have also been excluded if they\nwere working part-time--defined as less than 35 hours\nper week as they may have already started the retire-\nment process by cutting back on work hours. Some\nindividuals in the sample analyzed in this article will\nbe affected by the Social Security normal retirement\nage increase. Because Fields and Mitchell (1987) ex-\npect the change to not have a major effect on the\nretirement process, the changing eligibility age is not\ncontrolled for in this study. In fact, the age 62 predic-\ntions presented in the next section are not affected\nby the increase in the eligibility age. Although the\nspouses of the age-eligible individuals were also inter-\nviewed in the survey, I did not include them in the\nanalysis in this article, even if the spouse was not born\nare matched to the age-eligible individual.\nAfter excluding nonworkers and the self-employed\nI am left with a sample of 5,040. Excluding part-time\nworkers reduces the sample size to 4,322. In order to\ngather information on health insurange coverage for\nsecondary respondents in the sample, family mem-\nbers had to be matched. After excluding observations\nfor missing data on retirement expectations, missing\nmatches, and other missing data, the final sample is\ntics are shown for men and women in Table 1, and\nthe means for more detailed postretirement benefit\ndata are shown in Table 2 for men.\nMeasures\nWorkers were asked a series of questions about\ntheir anticipated retirement patterns, such as whether\nthey planned to stop working altogether, never stop\nworking, continue as they were, work fewer hours, or\nchange the kind of work they do, and workers who\nplanned to stop working were asked a follow-up ques-\ntion to determine the planned age of retirement.\nWorkers were allowed to choose all of the options\nthat applied. However, in this analysis, workers were\nnot allowed to report more than one option. For ex-\nample, if a worker reported that he or she planned\nto stop working, then that answer took precedent over\nall other options. The distribution of the reported\nanswers did not change significantly after restricting\nthe choice of options. According to Table 3, 6.3% of\nmen and 6.7% of women reported that they planned\nto stop working before age 62. An additional 11.5%\nof men and 12.5% of women planned to stop work-\ning between ages 62 and 64. In contrast, women were\n40 The Gerontologist\nTable 1.

This is true for both men and women. In\naddition, for workers with a retirement plan, those with\na defined benefit plan--whether or not they had a\nsupplemental defined contribution plan--were more\nlikely to expect to stop working before age 65 than\nworkers witn only a defined contribution plan. Finally,\nworkers who expected to receive retiree health ben-\nefits were more likely to expect to stop working be-\nfore age 65 than workers not expecting retiree health\nbenefits.\nResults\nIn order to understand the relationship between ex-\npected retirement patterns and employee benefits, a\nseries of probit models are estimated. Two dependent\nvariables are measured: the probability of expecting to\nstop working (hereafter referred to as retire) before\nage 62 and the probability of expecting to retire be-\nfore age 65. These ages were chosen to correspond to\nthe eligibility age for early and full Social Security ben-\nefits. Separate estimates are presented in Table 4 for.\nmen and women. In the first two columns of Table 4,\nthe probit results on the probability of expecting\nto retire before age 62 are presented for men and\nwomen.

Men with a primary defined ben-\nefit plan combined with a supplemental defined con-\ntribution plan were more likely than men without any\npension plan to expect to retire before age 62. They\nwere also more likely to expect to retire before age\n65. Men with a defined benefit plan with no defined\ncontribution plan were also more likely than men with-\nout any pension plan to expect to retire before age\n62 and age 65. Although the effect of a stand-alone\ndefined contribution was to increase the probability\nof expecting to retire before age 62 for men, this\neffect was less significant than the defined benefit\neffects. It was not significant in the age 65 equation.\nWith the exception of a small statistically significant\neffect for stand-alone defined benefit plans in the age\n65 equation, none of the pension plan effects were\nsignificant for women.\nThe availability of retiree health benefits appears to\naffect the expectation that male workers will retire be-\nfore ages 62 and 65. The effect is significant at the\n5% level in the age 62 equation and at the 1% level\nin the age 65 equation. This may suggest that as a\nman gets closer to eligibility for Medicare he is more\nlikely to be influenced to retire before being eligible\nfor Medicare the shorter the waiting period for Medi-\ncare. The effect of retiree health insurance was insig-\nnificant for women in both equations.\nAlthough this study is not estimating a full simulta-\nneous model of joint decision making for married in-\ndividuals, it is important to control for spousal charac-\nteristics because the availability of a pension or re-\ntiree health insurance may have an influence on a\nspouse's retirement process. I found that the effect of\nspousal characteristics does not matter for men but it\nhas a limited effect for women. Specifically, a married\nman whose spouse has a defined benefit plan with a\nsupplemental defined contribution plan is not more\nlikely to expect to retire early when compared with a\nmarried man whose spouse does not have a pension\nplan. In contrast, a married woman whose spouse has\na defined benefit plan with a supplemental defined\ncontribution plan is significantly more likely to expect\nto retire before age 62, but not age 65.\nOverall, few other explanatory variables signifi-\ncantly affected the probability of expecting to retire\nearly with a few exceptions. Turning to the influence\nof marital status on the propensity to expect to retire\nearly, the results reflect the asymmetric influence of\nmarital disruption on women compared to men. The\nprobability that women will plan to retire before age\n65 is significantly reduced after a divorce. The prob-\nability of expecting to retire before age 62 is also\nsignificantly lower for widowed women. In contrast,\nmarital status has absolutely no significant effect on\nthe probability of retiring early for men. The fact that\n42 The Gerontologist\nTable 4.

In Table 5, estimates are presented\nfor a probit model that uses a set of dummy variables\nto account for the expected benefit in retirement. The\nactual reported expected benefit for workers with a\nprimary defined benefit plan is used instead of a single\ndummy variable. In the HRS, expected benefits for\ndefined benefit plans were reported a number a ways.\nWorkers were allowed to report the amount that\nthey expected to receive either as a percentage of\npay or as a dollar amount per year. Workers were\nalso allowed to report whether they expected to re-\nceive a lump-sum distribution. Some workers reported\nthat they did not know what income to expect in re-\ntirement from their defined benefit plan.

Men with defined benefit plans were more\nlikely to plan to retire before age 62 than men with-\nout a defined benefit plan when they expected to re-\nceive either 60-79% of their pay in retirement and\nin their defined contribution accounts were more likely\nthan other workers to expect to retire before age 62.\nIn the age 65 equation, the results are similar with\nthe exception that even workers expecting a relatively\nsmall annual annuity expect to retire before age 65.\nThis result suggests that the closer an individual is to\nreceiving Social Security and Medicare, the more willing\nhe would be to retire early given a smaller level of\npostretirement benefits.\nWorkers with a relatively high level of expected\nbenefits from a defined benefit plan were not more\nlikely to retire before either age 62 or 65 than either\nworkers with less generous benefits or workers with\nno defined benefit plan. As mentioned above, defined\nbenefit pension plans typically base benefits on some\ncombination of years of service and final pay. If one\nassumes that these workers are at the high end of the\nincome distribution, then one would expect them to\ncontinue working longer in life because of the oppor-\ntunity cost associated with leaving the labor force.\nI also found that workers who expect their former\nemployers to pay for all or some of their retiree health\nbenefits were more likely to expect to retire before\nage 62 than workers whose employers offer the ben-\nefit but are not expected to subsidize it.\nPredictions\nTable 6 contains the predicted probability of expect-\ning to retire early based on the probit equation esti-\nmates presented in Table 4. The predictions are calcu-\nlated at the variable means. I found that the prob-\nability of expecting to retire before age 62 for men is\n1.1% if there is no pension plan, 6.4% if the person has\na defined benefit plan with a supplemental defined\ncontribution plan, and 6.5% if the person has a defined\nbenefit plan without a supplemental defined contribu-\ntion plan. Individuals with a defined benefit plan are\nalso roughly 43% more likely to expect to retire before\nTable 6.

This effect falls to between 18% and\n25% for those expecting to retire before age 65, again\nsuggesting that the shorter the time to full Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare benefits, the less of an effect these\ndifferences have on expectations.\nMen who do not expect retiree health insurance\nhave a 2.9% chance of expecting to retire before age\n62 compared to 4.6% of men who do not expect re-\ntiree health insurance. In other words the probability\nof expecting to retire before age 62 increases by 59%\nif retiree health insurance is available. The difference\nin the probability of expecting to retire before age 65\nfalls to 28% for those expecting and not expecting re-\ntiree health insurance.\nAlthough the predictions for women are presented\nin Table 6, they are less meaningful, as there are fewer\nsignificant effects in Table 4. For example, the prob-\nability of a woman expecting to retire before age 65\ndecreases with the availability of retiree health insur-\nance because the coefficient in Table 4 is negative\n(but statistically insignificant).\nDiscussion\nAmericans are living longer, healthier lives. How-\never, because Americans, especially men, are perma-\nnently withdrawing from the labor force at earlier ages\nthan in the past, financing of the Social Security and\nMedicare programs is becoming an increasing chal-\nlenge. The Medicare trust fund already is in negative\ncash flow and is expected to be depleted by 2010.\nThe Social Security trust fund is projected to enter a\nstate of negative cash flow in 2020, with depletion of\nthe trust fund following in 2032, according to the pro-\njections presented in the 1998 trustees report (Board\nof Trustees, 1998). Although the size of the federal\nbudget as a percentage of gross domestic product has\nnot changed significantly in recent years, entitlements\nsuch as the Social Security and Medicare programs\nare accounting for an increasing proportion of the\nfederal budget (Quinn, 1996). Given the changing\ndemographics of the United States, these projected\ntrends are not sustainable. The baby boom generation\nwill start to withdraw from the labor force in 2011,\njust after the projected depletion date of the Medi-\ncare trust fund. Hence, the projected trends are not\neven sustainable in the short run.\nEven though the normal retirement age for Social\nSecurity benefits is 65, and most individuals do not\nqualify for Medicare benefits before age 65, many\nAmericans continue to withdraw from the labor force\nprior to age 65. Some analysts have concluded that\nemployee benefits play a large role in the labor force\nwithdrawal of older Americans. Increased retirement\nincome from public and private sources appears to\nhave been the main cause of the trend toward early\nretirement. Benefit provisions allowing early retirement\nmay reflect employer and employee preferences for\nrelatively short work lives rather than more frequent\nperiods of leisure during a lengthier work life. How-\never, future declines in the number of new entrants\ninto the labor force may increase the demand for la-\nbor and lead employers to increase incentives for older\nworkers to stay on the job longer.\nChanges to laws and regulations affecting early re-\ntirement have been proposed as a way to encourage\nolder workers to stay employed longer. However, re-\nducing employer flexibility in structuring compensa-\ntion may interfere with the ability of employers and\nemployees to negotiate a compensation package that\nreflects changing needs over the course of a work life.\nPolicy makers might want to enhance the ability to\nchoose freely between retirement and work. Attempts\nto encourage a longer working life might be framed\nas an effort to encourage flexibility in retirement to\nsupplement resources and account for unanticipated\nchanges in resource needs.\nReferences\nAllen, E.
