SOD2 polymorphisms are of interest because of their potential roles in the modulation\nof free radical-mediated macromolecular damage during aging.\nResults: We identified a new splice variant of SOD2 in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The\nalternatively spliced product was originally detected by exon trapping of a minigene in order to\nexamine the consequences of an intronic polymorphism found upstream of exon 4 (nucleotide\n8136, 10T vs 9T). Examination of the transcripts derived from the endogenous loci in five LCLs\nwith or without the intron 3 polymorphism revealed low levels of an in-frame deletion of exon 4\nthat were different from those detected by the exon trap assay. This suggested that exon trapping\nof the minigene unmasked the effect of the 10T vs 9T polymorphism on the splicing of the adjacent\nexon.\nWe also determined the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in a sample of US African-\nAmericans and non-African-Americans ages 65 years and older who participated in the 1999 wave\nof the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). Particularly striking differences between African-\nAmericans and non-African-Americans were found for the frequencies of genotypes at the 10T/9T\nintron 3 polymorphism.\nConclusion: Exon trapping can unmask in vitro splicing differences caused by a 10T/9T intron 3\npolymorphism. Given the recent evidence that SOD2 is in a region on chromosome 6 linked to\nsusceptibility to hypertension, it will be of interest to investigate possible associations of this\npolymorphism with cardiovascular disorders.\nBackground\nThe free radical theory of aging is currently the leading\nhypothesis for a fundamental mechanism of aging. It\npotentially unifies aging mechanisms across an array of\nspecies [1-5]. The theory postulates that reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals,\nmainly generated as toxic by-products of normal cellular\nmetabolism during aerobic respiration in mitochondria,\ngive rise to damage to wide variety of macromolecules,\nincluding DNA. Animals possess enzymes that scavenge\n\u00a9 2007 Shao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nROS. Among the most important of such antioxidant\ndefenses are the superoxide dismutases (SOD), which\nfacilitate the dismutation of superoxide free radical (O2\n-.)\n[6]. There are three types of SODs in higher eukaryotes, a\ncopper/zinc containing cytoplasmic enzyme, SOD1; a\nmanganese containing mitochondrial enzyme, SOD2;\nand a copper/zinc containing SOD3 that is prevalent in\nextracellular spaces [6,7].\nSOD2 is constitutively expressed in most cells [8]. SOD2\ngene dosage correlates with longevity in fruit flies and in\nmice [9]. Mice that are heterozygous for an SOD2 knock-\nout accumulate excessive damage to mitochondrial DNA\nas they age [10]. In these mouse lines, there were no com-\npensatory increases of other antioxidant enzymes such as\nSOD1, catalase or glutathione peroxidase [11]. There is lit-\ntle understanding of the role of SODs in the modulation\nof longevity or health status in aging humans. Human dis-\norders due to the SOD2 mutations have yet to be identi-\nfied. However, a number of studies describe associations\nof SOD2 polymorphisms (particularly Ala16Val) with\nage-related disorders. One such study of elderly people\nwith an Ashkenazi ethnic background suggested a possi-\nble association between Val at codon 16 of SOD2 and lon-\ngevity [12]. Individuals who were homozygous for the\nvaline allele at position 16 (also described as the -9 posi-\ntion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence) were shown\nto have an increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer\n[13,14]. The Val allele may also be a predisposing factor\nfor diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in Russians with type\n1 diabetes mellitus [15]. Finally, homozygosity for the Val\nallele was also associated with non-familial idiopathic\ndilated cardiomyopathy among Japanese [16]. This was\nthought to be due to a decreased efficiency of SOD2 trans-\nport into mitochondria [16].\nIn contrast to the above reports, the alanine allele has\nbeen associated with high risk of breast cancer among U.S.\nand Finnish Caucasians [17,18] and with an increased risk\nof developing psoriatic arthritis in the Taiwanese popula-\nAs is typical of such association studies, most have not\nbeen confirmed in independent populations. Linkage\nstudies are therefore of interest. A particularly cogent\nexample is a report of a genome scan of microsatelite\nmarkers among hypertensive African-Americans; linkage\nhypertension in African-Americans are between 112 cM\nThe National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) reports on\nthe functional status of cross-sectional and longitudinal\npopulation-based samples from U.S. Medicare recipients\nlogical samples were obtained. This provided an opportu-\nnity to examine SOD2 polymorphisms among different\nethnic groups.\nResults\nDNA was obtained from a total of 644 blood samples.\nEach DNA isolation gave an average of 40 ug of DNA, suf-\ncal wash samples of which 2,078 provided DNA suitable\nfor banking. There was sufficient DNA from buccal wash\nsamples to permit the performance of up to ~400 PCR\nreactions.\nScreening studies were performed using genomic DNA\nfrom peripheral blood. Because a striking difference in the\nfrequencies for the polymorphism at the nucleotide posi-\ntion 8,136 was observed among African-Americans (see\nbelow), studies of that polymorphism were extended to\nthe larger sample of genomic DNA from buccal samples.\nSOD2 polymorphisms\nWe first sequenced exons 1 through 4 and the coding\nregions of exon 5, including approximately 50 nucleotides\ninto the introns from the exon-intron junctions (Table 1).\nExons 1 and 2 were amplified in one amplicon, and exon\n1 with the adjacent intron (including a A/G polymor-\nphism at nt 36) was sequenced with the forward primer,\nand exon 2 with the reverse primer.\nWe identified five SOD2 polymorphisms, defined as those\nwith minor allele frequencies that were greater than 1%\n(Table 2, Figure 1). In addition to these polymorphisms,\nwe observed one individual heterozygous for a synony-\none individual with a heterozygous A-to-G change at nt\ninsertion at 10604 (resulting in the frame shift and pre-\nmature termination at amino acid 214). We confirmed\nthese five heterozygous changes by sequencing of the\nreverse strands. One or more of these may prove to be\nmutations. No other alterations were observed.\nIs the intron 3 T9/T10 polymorphism associated with\nsplicing variations?\nAmong the five polymorphisms studied, a single base pair\ndeletion at nucleotide 8,136 was designated as T9 and the\nwild type was designated as T10. Since the T10/T9 poly-\nmorphism is close to the intron-exon junction, we\nexplored the possibility that this polymorphism may\naffect the splicing of exon 4. An approximately 3 kb frag-\nment spanning intron 2 to exon 5 was inserted into an\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nexon trap system to determine how the fragments were\nprocessed. RT-PCR showed that the minigene containing\nT9 was shorter than expected by approximately 100 bp\n(Figure 2). Sequencing of the RT-PCR products revealed\nthat the spliced product from the T9 minigene deleted\nexon 4. Exon 3 was joined directly to exon 5. The RT-PCR\nproduct generated from the minigene containing the T10\nyielded wild type product, exon 3 being joined to exon 4\nfollowed by exon 5.\nExon trapping, however, is a highly artificial system. The\nsplicing of the minigene occurs out of context of the com-\nplete genome. In order to examine whether deletion of\nexon 4 can be spliced out in intact cells, lymphoblastoid\ncell lines were established from four T10 homozygotes\nand four T10/T9 heterozygotes. SOD2 mRNAs from these\ncell lines were amplified by RT-PCR. We utilized one\nprimer set that amplifies only those mRNA deleting exon\n4 and another set which amplifies both wild type and the\nexon 4-deleted form (Figure 3). Ethidium bromide stain-\ning of RT-PCR products showed that LCLs from both\nhomozygous 10T and heterozygous T9/T10 subjects were\nexpressing wild type SOD2 mRNA and the aberrant form\ndeleting exon 4 to similar extents. These RT-PCR products\nwere sequenced to confirm that they are all SOD2 mRNA,\nwith or without exon 4. When both forms were simulta-\nneously amplified, only wild type mRNA was detected,\nindicating that the predominantly spliced forms were wild\ntype in cells from both genotypes. These results suggest\nthat the exon-trapping assay excluded cis-acting factors\nrequired for the inclusion of exon 4 when one T is missing\nat the IVS4-6 position.\nDramatically altered 8136 allele frequencies within the\nAfrican-American population\nsians, 43 African-Americans, 2 Asian/Pacific islanders, and\n3 \"others\". Statistically significant differences between\nAfrican-Americans and Caucasians were observed for\nthree out of five polymorphisms.

A statistically\nsignificant difference was not observed for the case of the\nAmong the five polymorphisms studied, the most striking\nfinding was a difference in the frequencies of the polymor-\nphism at nucleotide 8,136 (Table 2). A single base pair\ndeletion was designated as T9 and the wild type desig-\none T9 allele, significantly higher than the average for the\ntotal population (1.7%) and strikingly higher when com-\npared to the population of non-African-Americans\n(0.7%). We then examined this T9/T10 polymorphism in\nbuccal samples that were obtained from African-Ameri-\ncans. Out of 67 African-Americans who provided buccal\nwere T10/T9. No individual has been found to be\nhomozygous for the T9 allele. The allele frequencies from\nblood and buccal samples were comparable. We con-\ncluded that the T9 allele is far more frequent in elderly\nAfrican-Americans than in non-African-Americans (p <\nDiscussion\nThe T9/T10 SOD2 polymorphism was newly identified in\nour laboratory in the course of screening of the 1999\nNLTCS population for SOD2 polymorphisms.

An exon trap analysis was quite con-\nsistent with this interpretation. There are a number of\nexamples in the human genetics literature in which intron\npolymorphisms appear to have altered the ratio of wild\ntype and alternative splicing patterns [22,23]. In some\ncases, altered splicing was shown be responsible for the\npathogenetic mechanism leading to disease. Interesting\nexamples are the sequence variations at the 3' end of\nintron 8 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance\nregulator (CFTR). These are thought to affect splicing of\nexon 9, resulting in the reduction of functional CFTR [24].\nFor the case of our SOD2 T9/T10 polymorphism, how-\never, it was not possible to confirm the splicing bias using\nRNA from intact cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines). Simi-\nlarly, we were unable to determine what fractions of the\ntranscript lacking exon 4 were derived from T10 and T9\nalleles in the heterozygote.\nPrevious work from our laboratory showed that intronic\npolymorphisms generated cryptic splicing products by\nexon trapping or by assays utilizing a mini gene and RT-\nPCR, but there was little evidence that this occurred in vivo\n[25]. The most likely interpretation of this discordance in\nthe results of test tube-based versus cell-based methods is\nthat the former exclude important cis-acting domains\nresiding in more distal domains of DNA. In addition,\ntrans-acting factors may differ among different cell types\nand species. These elements are likely to be capable of\nmodulating splicing.\nAlthough we have so far failed to provide molecular evi-\ndence for a functional distinction between the polymor-\nphic allele of interest, given the striking difference in\nprevalence among African-Americans as compared to\nCaucasian-Americans, it will be important to carry out\nappropriate epidemiological studies of the impact of the\ntwo alleles (and, eventually, contrasting haplotypes),\nupon health and survival in the two ethnic groups. The\nNLTCS should provide valuable material for such an\ninvestigation, as there is linkage to Medicare data and data\nNucleotide Position Location Genotype African-American White\nNucleotide numbering is according to the sequence of GenBank accession number NT_007422.\nH-W E are p values of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

A definitive study, how-\never, must await the availability of biological material\nfrom future cohorts, as the 1999 wave of the study could\nnot provide biological specimens from many institution-\nalized subjects.\nPerhaps the most immediate question would be the\npotential impact of this allelic variation of SOD2 upon\nsusceptibility to hypertension among African-Americans.\nFirst, hypertension is pervasive in this population. Sec-\nondly, it has deleterious effects upon multiple organs.\nThird, while susceptibility to hypertension is clearly mod-\nulated by multiple genetic loci, a region of chromosome 6\nthat encompasses the SOD2 locus is among those that\nhave been implicated [26]. Fourth, African-Americans\nprovide an excellent opportunity to carry out admixture\nmapping (reviewed by [27,28]. It has been estimated that\n~75% of the alleles of African-Americans are of African\nancestry whilst ~25% are of European ancestry [29]. Gene\nscans on the parental and admixed populations were suc-\ncessfully employed to identify hypertension loci by Zhu et\nal. (2005). The most robust finding was a region on the\nlong arm of chromosome 6 that included the SOD2 locus.\nWhile the region contains many genes, potentially includ-\ning more than one susceptibility genes, our observations\nsuggest that one important candidate gene is SOD2.\nConclusion\nWe demonstrated that the 10T/9T polymorphism in the\nSOD2 intron 3 clearly results in alternative splicing of\nexon 4 by an in vitro exon trap assay using minigenes. This\ndifference was masked when endogenous genes were\nexpressed within cells. Over-representation of 9T alleles in\nAfrican-Americans nevertheless raises the possibility that\nthis intron 3 polymorphism or polymorphisms in linkage\ndisequilibrium may be involved in the altered susceptibil-\nities to a range of disorders that are more common in Afri-\ncan-American populations.\nMethods\nSample collection and DNA isolation\nBoth peripheral blood and buccal wash samples were\nobtained from the 1999 NLTCS participants. Informed\nconsent was obtained. Peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (Amer-\nsham, CA, USA) gradient. Buccal wash samples were cen-\ntrifuged at 3,000 \u00d7 g prior to DNA isolation. Genomic\nDNA from blood and buccal wash samples were isolated\nwith QIAamp blood isolation kits or QIAamp tissue isola-\ntion kits, respectively (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA), follow-\ning protocols specified by the manufacturer. For high\nthroughput DNA isolation, a Qiagen BioRobot 3000 sys-\ntem was employed for DNA manipulation.

Briefly, genomic DNA was first amplified by 4 dif-\nferent primer pairs (Table 1), designed using Primer\nExpress software (Applied Biosystems Co., Foster City,\nCA), to obtain DNA fragments containing exons 1 and 2,\nexon 3, exon4, and exon 5, respectively. The primer pairs\nwere designed to specifically amplify the designated\nexon(s) with maximum adjacent upstream and down-\nstream intron sequences. All PCR products were first\nexamined on agarose DNA electrophoresis to verify size\nand were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and\nexonuclease I to eliminate excess nucleotides. The subse-\nquent sequencing of the PCR products was performed by\na Big Dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI) on an ABI\nPRISM 310 automated DNA sequencer with factory-sup-\nplied parameters. The sequencing primers for the 4 PCR\nproducts are also listed in Table 1. Newly found polymor-\nphisms were confirmed by sequencing in the reverse ori-\nentation in all of the samples.\nStatistical analysis\nDistributions of allele frequencies within the groups were\nexamined with the chi-square test (one degree of free-\ndom) to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compari-\nsons of the distributions between two groups were tested\nby the modified Fisher exact test (two degrees of freedom)\n[30,31]. The latter was also examined with the standard\nPearson chi-square test [32].\nExon trapping\nExon trapping was performed to reveal the potential of\nSNPs to promote differential splicing of SOD2 exons.\nGenomic fragments of different alleles of SOD2 were first\namplified with a set of primers (forward: gct ggt ccc att atc\ntaa tag c; reverse: cag tag agc atc tct ccc aaa tg) encompass-\ning SOD2 intron 2 to exon 5 by long-range PCR (Roche\nDiagnostics Co. Indianapolis, IL). The DNA fragments\ncarrying the SNPs in question were cloned by TA cloning\ntechniques (Invitrogen, Hercules, CA), and the SNPs were\nverified by sequencing. The selected genomic DNA frag-\nments with the intended SNPs were subcloned into a\npSPL3 splicing vector for exon trapping analysis (Invitro-\ngen Co. Carlsbad, CA). The nucleotide sequences at the\npolymorphic site were confirmed by sequencing, and the\nconstructs were verified via the digestion patterns of com-\nbinations of restriction enzymes. The exon trapping pro-\ncedures were performed according to the manufacturer's\nspecifications. The genomic DNA in pSPL3 was first iso-\nlated with a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen), and was\nused to transfect COS-7 cells for transient expression of\nthe reporter system. Exon trapping reporter transcripts\nwere examined by extracting total RNA from COS-7 cells,\nfollowed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) with primers specified in the kit for\namplification of the reporter gene. The amplified reporter\ngene fragments were visualized on 2% agarose gels. Varia-\nble lengths of the amplified fragments revealed differen-\ntial splicing as affected by the inserted alleles in the\nreporter system.\nEstablishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines and RT-PCR\nCryopreserved lymphocytes were thawed and immortal-\nized with Epstein-Barr virus using a published protocol\n[33].
