We examined the relation between serum vitamins A, C, and E,\n-carotene, and -carotene levels and blood pressure among 15 317 men and women 20 years of age who participated\nin the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Blood pressure was characterized as the average of 6\nmeasurements obtained over 2 visits by trained observers and hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/\n90 mm Hg and/or taking antihypertensive medications. In multivariate models, a 1 SD difference in vitamin A (16.2\nto 0.97) lower odds of hypertension, respectively. In addition, serum vitamins A and E were positively and significantly\nassociated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas -carotene and -carotene were inversely and\nsignificantly associated with systolic and vitamin C associated with diastolic blood pressure in multivariate linear\nregression analyses.

Whelton\n Key Words: blood pressure  vitamins  epidemiology  antioxidants\nExperimental studies have demonstrated that oxidation of\nLDL plays an important role in the development and\nprogression of atherosclerosis in animal models.1\u00ad3 Observa-\ntional epidemiologic studies have also documented an inverse\nassociation between increased intake of antioxidant vitamins\nsuch as vitamin E, -carotene, and vitamin C and reduced\nmorbidity and mortality rates from coronary heart disease.1\u00ad6\nHowever, results from several recently published, large,\nrandomized, controlled clinical trials, which provide the best\nevidence for a causal relation, do not support the hypothesis\nthat vitamin E or -carotene supplementation has a protective\neffect on coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease as\nwhole.7\u00ad9 Given the wide use of antioxidant vitamins in the\nUS general population, it is important to examine the bene-\nficial as well as potential adverse effects of vitamin supple-\nmentation in this context.\nObservational epidemiologic studies have suggested an\ninverse association between dietary intake or serum level of\nvitamin C and blood pressure (BP).10\u00ad15 Several small and\nshort-term clinical trials in which the effect of vitamin C\nsupplements on BP was examined have yielded inconsistent\nfindings.16\u00ad19 There are sparse data on the relation between\nother antioxidant vitamins and BP in human populations.20\u00ad22\nWe took advantage of a large representative sample of the US\ngeneral population to examine the relation of serum antioxi-\ndant vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and E, -carotene,\nand -carotene to BP. We hypothesized that serum levels of\nantioxidant vitamins might be inversely related to BP levels\nas well as risk of hypertension.\nMethods\nStudy Participants\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) was conducted by the National Center for Health\nand study methods have been published elsewhere.23 In brief, a\nstratified multistage probability design was used to obtain a repre-\nsentative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US general\npopulation.23 The design included oversampling of the very young,\nthe elderly, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-Americans to im-\nprove the precision of estimates in these groups. A total of 18 825\npersons 20 years of age participated in NHANES III. For the\ncurrent analysis, participants were excluded if their self-reported\nrace/ethnicity was not non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or\nMexican-American (n715). Participants were also excluded from\nthe analysis if there was a lack of data on BP (n348) or serum\n20 years of age met the inclusion criteria and were included in the\ncurrent analysis.

Information on a wide\nvariety of sociodemographic, medical history, nutritional history,\nand family history questions, such as self-reported age, race/ethnic-\nity, gender, years of education completed, history of smoking,\ndiabetes, and hypertension, use of antihypertensive medication,\nalcohol consumption, use of vitamin supplements, and 24-hour\ndietary recall, were obtained during the home interview.23\nBP was measured 3 times during the home interview and during\nthe subsequent evaluation at the mobile examination center by\ntrained observers using a standard protocol.23 BP for individual\nparticipants was calculated as the average of all available systolic\nand diastolic readings. Hypertension was defined as the presence of\na mean systolic BP 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 mm Hg\nand/or use of antihypertensive medication. Body weight and height\nwere measured according to a standard protocol, and body mass\nindex was calculated as an index for obesity.\nA blood sample was collected at the second visit. Serum levels of\nantioxidant vitamins, including vitamin A, -carotene, -carotene,\nvitamin C, and vitamin E were measured at the National Center for\nEnvironmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (Atlanta, Ga) by isocratic high-performance liquid\nStatistical Analyses\nMean values for age, BP, body mass index, dietary nutrient intake,\nserum antioxidant vitamins, and other continuous variables, as well\nas percentages for gender, race/ethnicity, and other categoric vari-\nables, were calculated by hypertension status. The statistical signif-\nicance of differences was examined by means of Student t test\n(continuous variables) and the 2 test (categoric variables). The\nagreement between serum level of vitamins and supplement use or\ndietary intake was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients (r).\nBivariate relations were explored by plotting each serum antiox-\nidant vitamin versus BP, which does not impose any statistical\nmodeling assumptions on the associations. The linearity of the\nassociation was tested by means of correlation analysis. Linear\nregression analysis was used to assess the association between serum\nantioxidant vitamin levels and BP. Logistic regression analysis was\nused to explore the relation between serum antioxidant vitamin levels\nand odds of hypertension. Estimated regression coefficients or odds\nratios are reported as the difference in BP (mm Hg) or odds of\nhypertension associated with a 1 SD increment in serum antioxidant\nvitamin levels. Confounding of the association between BP and\nantioxidant vitamin levels was evaluated by adding possible con-\nfounders to the models. Two final models, age-, gender-, and\nrace-adjusted model and multivariate-adjusted model (additional\nadjustment for education, alcohol consumption, and body mass\nindex, dietary intake of sodium, potassium, saturated fat, and total\nenergy) are presented. All statistical analyses were performed with\nthe use of Stata software, which included functions for the analysis\nof complex survey data.25\nResults\nThe general characteristics of study participants by hyperten-\nsion status are presented in Table 1. On average, normoten-\nsives were 20 years younger than hypertensives. The percent-\nages of male and non-Hispanic whites were similar between\nthe two groups, whereas normotensives had a lower propor-\ntion of non-Hispanic blacks and a higher proportion of high\nschool graduates and participants who consumed alcohol at\nleast once per week. The prevalence of self-reported history\nof diabetes was significantly higher in hypertensives than in\nnormotensives. As expected, normotensives had a lower\nmean body mass index and systolic and diastolic BP than\ntheir hypertensive counterparts. Normotensives reported a\nhigher intake of dietary saturated fat and a lower intake of\nsodium and potassium compared with hypertensives. Mean\nTABLE 1.

Serum\nvitamin A was positively and significantly associated with\nboth systolic and diastolic BP in each subgroup, except in\nparticipants with hypertension. Serum -carotene was in-\nversely and significantly related to systolic BP among most of\nthe subgroups. Serum -carotene was inversely related to\nboth systolic and diastolic BP in participants who were\nyounger than 60 years, in women and in whites, and was\nrelated to systolic BP in men and in normotensives. Serum\nvitamin C was inversely associated with diastolic BP in\nparticipants who were younger than 60 years, in men and\nwomen, and in hypertensives and normotensives. In addition,\nserum vitamin C was inversely and significantly associated\nwith both systolic and diastolic BP among blacks. Serum\nvitamin E was positively associated with both systolic and\ndiastolic BP among most of the subgroups.\nDiscussion\nOur study is one of the first to identify a significant and\ninverse relation between serum levels of -carotene and\n-carotene and risk of hypertension. It is also one of the first\nto recognize a significant and positive relation between serum\nlevels of vitamin A and E and risk of hypertension in a human\npopulation. These relations were independent of age, gender,\nrace, and other important risk factors for hypertension. In\naddition, our study identified a significant inverse relation\nbetween serum vitamin C and diastolic BP. These results\nsuggest that antioxidant vitamins may play an important role\nin the underlying cause and prevention of hypertension. As\nsuch, they have important public health and clinical\nimplications.\nHypertension, a major risk factor for coronary heart dis-\nease, stroke, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease,\nand peripheral vascular disease, affects as many as 50 million\nadult Americans.26 More than $34.4 billion is spent annually\nfor medications, office visits, and laboratory tests related to\ntreatment of hypertension in the US population.27 Epidemio-\nlogic studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that nutri-\ntional factors play an important role in the underlying cause\nand prevention of hypertension.28 The findings from our\nstudy provide new insights regarding the potential role of\nvarious antioxidant vitamins in modulating BP.\nExperimental studies in animal models suggest that oxida-\ntive stress may be important in the pathogenesis of hyperten-\nsion or in the underlying cause of arterial damage related to\nhypertension.29,30 However, there are scarce data in the\nrelation between oxidative stress or antioxidants and BP in\nhuman populations. In cross-sectional studies, higher serum\nlevels or dietary intake of vitamin C have been consistently\nand significantly related to lower systolic and diastolic BP\namong middle-aged or elderly populations.10\u00ad15 However,\nthere was insufficient attention to confounding effects by\nother dietary factors in most of these studies.31 Several small\nTABLE 4.

However,\ndaytime levels of ambulatory systolic BP was slightly but\n3.9 mm Hg), in the vitamin C supplementation phase\ncompared with the placebo control phase. Our study\nidentified an inverse association between serum vitamin C\nlevel and risk of hypertension and BP in age, gender, and\nrace-adjusted analyses. After further adjustment for other\nrisk factors including dietary nutrients, serum vitamin C\nlevel was only significantly related to diastolic BP. Fur-\nthermore, our study indicated that serum vitamin C level\nwas significantly related to both systolic and diastolic BP\nin blacks who had a lower mean level of serum vitamin C.\nThese findings might imply that low intake of dietary\nvitamin C related to increased risk of hypertension.\nTo the best our knowledge, the present study is the first to\nhave examined the relation between serum carotene levels\nand BP in a human population. Our study identified an\ninverse relation between serum levels of -carotene and\n-carotene and risk of hypertension and systolic BP. In a\nrandomized crossover trial conducted in 21 hypertensive\npatients, a combination of antioxidants consisting of 200 mg\nof zinc sulfate, 500 mg of vitamin C, 600 mg of -tocopherol,\nand 30 mg of -carotene per day significantly lowered\nsystolic BP.32 However, in a larger randomized controlled\nTABLE 5.

Participants on antihypertensive\nmedications were excluded.\ntrial conducted in 297 participants, combined antioxidant\nC, and 6 mg -carotene per day did not reduce BP during a\n2- to 4-month period of intervention.33 Future studies are\nrequired to confirm our findings and to examine the indepen-\ndent effect of carotene on BP.\nOur study is one of the first to report a strong, independent,\nand positive association between higher serum vitamin A\nlevel and increased risk of hypertension and BP in a large\npopulation sample. The association was consistent across age,\ngender, and race groups. This finding is in conflict with the\nresults from two previous reports. In the First National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey population, a significant\ndecrease in dietary intake of vitamin A was identified in\nhypertensives compared with normotensives.34 In addition, a\nsignificant decrease in plasma vitamin A level was reported\nsive controls.29 In the NHANES III study population, we have\nalso identified a positive and significant association between\nserum vitamin A level and risk of chronic kidney disease.35\nSerum level of vitamin E was significantly and positively\nrelated with both systolic and diastolic BP in our study.\nExperimental studies have shown that vitamin E decreases\nBP in animal models.36,37 However, data from human popu-\nlations are more inconsistent. For example, epidemiologic\nstudies have reported that serum level of vitamin E is\nreduced29 or is no different38 in hypertensive patients com-\npared with normotensive control subjects. Palumbo et al20\nfound that vitamin E supplementation had no effect on BP in\ntreated hypertensive patients in a randomized, controlled,\nopen trial. Our findings of a positive and independent relation\nbetween serum vitamin E and BP call for further investigation\nin this important area.\nSeveral large clinical trials, which examined the effect of\n-carotene or vitamin E supplements on risk of cardiovascu-\nlar disease, have reported negative results.7\u00ad9 For example,\nYusuf and colleagues9 summarized 4 major clinical trials of\nvitamin E supplementation with a total of 26 020 participants\nin the treatment group and 25 980 participants in the placebo\ncontrol group. The relative risk of cardiovascular disease\nassociated with vitamin E supplementation was 0.97, with a\nHeart Protection Study indicates that antioxidant vitamin\n20 mg -carotene) does not reduce risk of cardiovascular\nup.39,40 Our study raises new concerns on vitamin A and E\nsupplement use in the general population.\nOur findings are noteworthy because they are based on\nexperience in a large, representative sample of the US general\npopulation, where careful measurement of BP and serum\nvitamin levels allowed for more reliable assessment of the\nassociation, and it was possible to adjust for consumption of\ndietary nutrient and other important covariables. However,\nthe cross-sectional study design used in NHANES III hinders\nmaking inferences regarding causality between antioxidant\nvitamins and BP. For instance, we cannot establish the\ntemporal relation between serum levels of antioxidant vita-\nmins and BP. In addition, oversampling some subgroups and\nimperfect response rates may affect the representation of the\nsample. Furthermore, serum level of antioxidant vitamins\nmay be a marker for other confounding factors. If the relation\nbetween antioxidant vitamins and risk of hypertension is\nconfirmed in large cohort studies, then randomized, con-\ntrolled trials with sufficient sample size and intervention\nduration will be needed to test for causality.\nPerspectives\nOur study findings indicate that vitamin C, -carotene, and\n-carotene are inversely associated with BP, whereas vita-\nmins A and E are positively associated with BP. These\nrelations are stronger in normotensive and younger partici-\npants. These findings suggest that antioxidant vitamins may\nplay an important role in the underlying cause and prevention\nof hypertension. With increased recognition of oxidative\nstress in the pathogenesis of hypertension and wide use of\nantioxidant vitamins in the general population, further inves-\ntigations are warranted in this important area.\n"
