The highly\nspecialized and time-consuming nature of\nthese analyses likely prevents widespread\nclinical implementation of these meth-\nods,12,13 and, since they are nonstandar-\ndized, often generate unclear results.14\u00ad17\nStudies have focused on the analysis of raw\n-weighted images (T1\nWI), which can\nbe more easily implemented in daily clinical\npractice, compared with other imaging\nmodalities.18\u00ad23 These studies had low tem-\nporal resolution, minimal dynamic series\nand an acquisition time that was too\nbrief to allow prostate cancer detection or\ncomprehensive measurement of tumour\nhaemodynamics.\nThe aims of the present study, therefore,\nwere to evaluate the clinical value of 3.0T\nDCE-MRI in detecting prostate cancer, and\nto compare imaging results with TRUS-\nguided biopsy findings.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited consecutive male\npatients with elevated PSA (>4.0 ng/ml)\nand/or prostate nodule detected during\ndigital rectal examination who attended the\nDepartment of Radiology, Zhujiang\nHospital of Southern Medical University,\nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province, China,\nfor diagnosis between January 2012 and July\n2013. Patients were required to have under-\ngone both MRI and a subsequent transrec-\ntal prostate biopsy, and to not have received\nany treatment for prostate cancer.\nThe study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of the Zhujiang Hospital of\nSouthern Medical University, Guangzhou,\nChina. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all patients prior to enrolment.\nMRI\nAll MRI examinations were performed on a\n3.0T whole-body multitransmit scanner\nsystem (Achieva TX, Philips Healthcare,\nBest, The Netherlands) using a 16-channel\nSENSE XL torso coil. T2\n-weighed, turbo\nspin-echo images with spectrally selective\nattenuated inversion recovery were obtained\nin the axial and coronal planes (repetition\nslice thickness 5 mm; interslice gap 1 mm;\nnumber of slices 20; field of view [FOV]\nDCE-MRI was performed using a three-\n-fast field-echo (FFE)\nsequence in the axial plane (TR 5.5 ms; TE\n1.7 ms, slice thickness 6 mm [reconstructed\nto 3 mm]; interslice gap 0 mm; FOV\nscanned from the apex to the base of the\nprostate and a total of 20 slices were\nobtained. A 20-slice volume was obtained\nevery 2.9 s and imaging comprised eight\nprecontrast volumes and 96 postcontrast\nvolumes. Postcontrast imaging was initiated\nimmediately after administering 0.1 mmol/\nkg body weight gadopentetate dimeglumine\n(Magnevist\u00d5, Bayer Schering Pharma,\nGermany) at 2.5 ml/s via the cephalic vein.\nContrast agent injections were followed by a\n15-ml saline flush. The DCE-MRI examin-\nation time was 5 min and 6 s.\nPostimaging prostate biopsy\nWithin 2 weeks of MRI, all patients under-\nguided biopsy. All samples were obtained\nfrom the peripheral zone bilaterally, includ-\ning the base, mid-gland, apex, and the\nbilateral transitional zone. Each sample\nwas histologically analysed by the same\npathologist with 15 years' genitourinary\nexperience, and was determined to be can-\ncerous or noncancerous according to the\npathology.\nMRI analyses\nWI and DCE-MRI data were pro-\nspectively analysed by two radiologists who\nwere blinded to the clinical data (X-H.Z.\nand X-Y.Q., with 10 and 13 years' experi-\nence reading prostate MR images, respect-\nively). On T2\nWI, prostate cancer was defined\nas hypointense nodules in the peripheral\nzone, or areas of homogeneous hypointen-\nsity with ill-defined margins and no visible\ncapsule in the transitional zone of the pros-\ntate gland. DCE-MRI evaluation of\nunmodified T1\nimages, before and after\nadministration of the contrast agent, defined\nprostate cancer as nodular foci that showed\nearly and strong enhancement, and rapid\nwashout relative to the background in the\nperipheral zone and transitional zone.\nNodular foci showing early and strong\nenhancement followed by a plateau phase\nwere not considered to be prostate cancer,\nand neither were nodular foci showing per-\nsistent enhancement. The prostate was\ndivided into eight regions on MRI, corres-\nponding to TRUS-guided biopsy (the\nbilateral peripheral zone including the\nbase, mid-gland, apex and the bilateral\ntransitional zone). MR regions were classi-\nfied as cancerous or noncancerous according\nto the pathological results of corresponding\nbiopsy cores.\nStatistical analyses\nPatients with at least one region with posi-\ntive MR and biopsy findings were con-\nsidered true positives (TP). Patients with\nnegative MR and biopsy findings in all\nregions were considered true negatives\n(TN). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, posi-\ntive predictive value (PPV) and negative\npredictive value (NPV) were calculated\naccording to the following formulae:\nSensitivity \u00bc TP/number of patients with\ncancer at biopsy; Specificity \u00bc TN/number\nof patients without cancer at biopsy;\nAccuracy \u00bc TP \u00fe TN/number of patients;\nPPV \u00bc TP/number of patients with positive\nMRI; NPV \u00bc TN/number of patients with\nnegative MRI.\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or\nn (%). The sensitivity, specificity and\naccuracy of each technique for the diag-\nnosis of prostate cancer were compared\nusing McNemar test. Positive predictive\nvalue (PPV) and negative predictive value\n(NPV) were compared using 2-test; 2-\ntest was also used to correlate Gleason\nscores and prostate cancer detection by\nDCE-MRI. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS\u00d5 version 13.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 75 patients (mean age\noma was histopathologically confirmed in\nrepresentative patients with prostate adeno-\ncarcinoma are shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nBiopsy findings of the remaining 31 patients\nwithout cancer included benign prostatic\nhyperplasia (n \u00bc 26) and prostatitis (n \u00bc 5).\nData regarding sensitivity, specificity,\naccuracy, PPV and NPV of each MRI\ntechnique for the diagnosis of prostate\ncancer are given in Table 1.

First, the use of 3.0T in the\ncurrent study allows for higher signal-to-\nSecondly, temporal resolution was 2.9 s in\nour study, but 15\u00ad20 s in the other stu-\ndies.20,21 Early enhancement is more difficult\nto identify using longer acquisition times\n(e.g., >15 s).15 Finally, the time period\nbetween bolus injection and peak intensity\ndelay time in the present study was nearly\nused by others.20,21 This extended delay time\nis sufficient to enable accurate visualization\nof the initial increase in signal enhancement\nand gradual changes in signal intensity, in\ncancerous and noncancerous tissue.\nIt is unclear whether the detection rate of\nprostate cancer is correlated with Gleason\nsignificant correlation;27,28 and others have\nreported that detection rates were signifi-\ncantly higher for high-grade than low-grade\nings, the results of the present study indicate\nthat the detection rate for tumours with\nGleason score 7\u00ad9 was significantly higher\nThere were several limitations to this\nstudy. First, we did not use an endorectal\ncoil, which gives a high signal-to-noise\nratio but has drawbacks regarding patient\ndiscomfort, time and cost. Secondly, our\nreference standard was prostate biopsies,\nand it is possible that some patients with\nnegative biopsy findings could have had\ncancer. Moreover, MRI findings do not\ncorrespond directly to biopsy results because\nthe entire prostate was not evaluated during\nbiopsy.18 Comparing MR results with histo-\nlogical specimens of the whole prostate\nfollowing radical prostatectomy will be\nrequired in future studies. Finally, needle\nbiopsy often underestimates Gleason score\ncompared with prostatectomy, but this\nwould not change our findings of the rela-\ntionship between Gleason score and pros-\ntate cancer detection by DCE-MRI.\nIn conclusion, DCE-MRI at 3.0T can\nsignificantly improve prostate cancer detec-\ntion using simple visual diagnostic criteria\ncompared with T2\nWI. In addition, DCE-\nMRI has the potential to detect tumours\nwith high Gleason scores.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnonprofit sectors.\n"
