In recent years, European\ncountries have also seen a growing social and academic debate about the way racialized\nminorities are policed. Based on ethnographic research in Amsterdam, this article\nargues that in order to understand such racialized policing, we have to go beyond a\nnarrow focus on the police itself, and instead examine the broader institutional land-\nscape tasked with security. This institutional landscape is made up of penal and welfare\nactors who together enact what I call diffuse policing. Such diffuse policing envelops\ntargeted persons and spaces in a dense web of surveillance, and disciplinary and reform\ninterventions that are hard to escape or challenge.

This article examines the thick\ninstitutional `youth and security' landscape that envelops such youths, and explores\nthe diffuse forms of policing it inaugurates. I argue that the shared institutional\nCorresponding author:\nAnouk de Koning, Department of Anthropology and Development Studies, Radboud Universiteit, PO Box\nEmail: a.dekoning@maw.ru.nl\nfocus on particular places and categories of people and behaviours produces a very\nuneven reach and impact of security policies. Even if these policies are mostly not\nviolent and not merely repressive, they result in highly unequal experiences of the\nstate among Amsterdam's youths.\nIn the US context, racialized policing and police violence has been a longstand-\ning topic of activism, public debate and research (see, e.g., Alexander, 2011;\nracialized policing in continental Europe (see, e.g., Body-Gendrot, 2010; Bonnet\nA\n\u00b0 kerstro\n\u00a8 m, 2014). In order to understand discriminatory forms of policing, most of\nthese studies have focused on the police institution itself. In this article, I argue that\nthe focus on the police institution is too narrow to understand the discriminatory\neffects of policing in the Netherlands. In dense welfare states such as the Dutch one,\nmany more actors are involved in the surveillance, disciplining and reform of `risky'\nsubjects than the police. To understand the effects produced by such diffuse, net-\nworked policing, we need to examine the broader institutional landscape through\nwhich security policies are envisaged and practised. In this article, I use the case of\nAmsterdam's Diamantbuurt, a neighbourhood notorious on account of its unruly\nyoung men with Moroccan-Dutch backgrounds, to explore the types of surveil-\nlance and discipline enacted by what I call `diffuse policing', and examine the forms\nof inequality produced in the process.\nDrawing on 18 months of qualitative research in the Diamantbuurt, this article\nprovides a view of security policy from the bottom up, charting the everyday life of\nsecurity policies and, importantly, the stacking of policies that effectively produces\na thick `youth and security' landscape. The research focused on the broad range of\nactors involved with the Diamantbuurt, including journalists, politicians, policy\nofficials, street-level professionals and young and old residents from various back-\nAouragh; we employed a range of qualitative methods and gathered multiple kinds\nof data, including interviews, media reports, policy documents, and fieldwork\nobservations.\nWhile informed by the entire range of data, this article mainly draws on two sets\nof interviews with key actors in the youth-and-security domain. The first set con-\nsists of 20 interviews with professionals involved with youth and security policies:\npolicy officials and street level professionals, such as the community police officer\nand youth workers. The other set of interviews was with eight local young men with\nMoroccan-Dutch backgrounds, between their late teens and late twenties, who\nwere part of the youth-and-security target group. This group is generally hard to\nreach and does not trust authorities. Most of these interviews were with two inter-\nviewees at the time and were made possible through the intervention of trusted\nsocial workers, who were also present during the interview. These two sets of\ninterviews often spoke to each other directly, with professional interviewees dis-\ncussing particular young men we had interviewed, and vice versa. In addition, we\nhad many informal conversations with these same outreach social workers about\nthese young men and the youth-and-security policy network, and participated in\nvarious events in the youth-and-security domain, from the regular open house at\nStreetcornerwork, the organization for outreach social work, to an anniversary\nevent of that same organization attended by various youth-and-security partners\nIn the following I first discuss institutional legacies and changes in security\npolicies in the Netherlands. I then introduce the site of this case study, the\nDiamantbuurt, and the reasons for its notoriety. After a sketch of the contours\nof the local security landscape, I explore how this institutional landscape attempts\nto monitor, discipline and reform particular groups of young men. I use interviews\nwith some of the young men who are its prime targets to explore how this `youth\nand security' landscape manifests itself in their lives. I end with a reflection on the\neffects of diffuse policing, and the inequalities it produces.\nRacialized policing\nEthnic profiling was long considered non-existent or insignificant in the\nhowever, supervisory bodies and academic observers have begun to discuss the\n2013, for an excellent overview). Anthropologist Sinan C\nof proactive policing practices in the Amsterdam police force is the most detailed\nstudy to date. According to C\n\u00b8 ankaya, proactive policing, which aims to prevent\noffenses that may happen in the future, involves the routine categorization of the\npopulation into probable victims and probable perpetrators. Young Moroccan-\nDutch men with a `street look' and Eastern European men were prime targets of\nsuch proactive policing.\nC\n\u00b8 ankaya documents not only a police culture replete with negative stereotypes\nof Moroccan-Dutch young men, but also points to a number of structural features\nof the police organization that stimulate ethnic profiling. For instance he discusses\nthe `Show-off Approach', which entailed a focus on non-white young men who\ndrive big cars, thus creating an official incentive for a Dutch variety of `driving\nwhile black'. C\n\u00b8 ankaya also demonstrates the crucial role of the police information\nsystem. In the context of proactive policing, police officers note information they\nexpect to be potentially useful. The initial choice to make a note on a specific\nperson often relies on the racialized ideas about possible victims and perpetrators\ndiscussed above. When information on an individual is entered into the system, it\nwill stimulate other officers to also note down details on this particular individual,\nresulting in a chain of notes on that person in the police information system,\nwithout any wrong doing or even marginally suspect behaviour on his part.\nThe initial racialized judgement call defining someone as a potential person of\ninterest continues to incite further police attention.\nIn his ethnographic study of a Parisian anti-crime squad, Didier Fassin (2013)\nargues that the policing of social housing projects has become a way to assert social\norder rather than maintain public order. He demonstrates that this policing is\ndeeply racialized and discusses at length the entanglement of probability thinking\nwith racial stereotypes that together steer police officers towards such racialized\npolicing. He concludes:\nIt is the institution of law enforcement, and society more broadly, that produce the\nracialized categories that officers put into action on the ground, transforming minority\nyouths into suspects, just as political discourse has done in recent decades in linking\nC\n\u00b8 ankaya and Fassin's studies elucidate the institutional setting that leads to a focus\non particular racialized groups of youths, and the procedures and routines that\nfurther consolidate the focus on these groups. They also explore the adversarial\ntype of interactions between racialized youths and police that are produced\nthrough such institutional settings and routines. Their work documents the preva-\nlence of ethnic or racial profiling in police work in France and the Netherlands, and\ndraws attention to the societal and institutional contexts that help explain its seem-\ningly common-sense nature and wide-spread occurrence.\nBuilding on these important contributions, I argue that the policing of risky\nsubjects is done through a dense institutional landscape performs a diffuse kind of\npolicing that marries welfare to discipline, care to coercion and prevention to\nrepression (cf. Gressga\n\u00b0 rd's (2016) notion of `welfare policing'). In line with obser-\nwant to examine racialized policing, we should turn to this wider institutional\nlandscape.\nSecurity policies in the Netherlands\nThe diffuse policing I describe here fits in with a long history in the Netherlands\nwith interventions in the lives of poor, urban families intended to monitor,\ndiscipline and reform them (see, e.g., De Regt, 1984). While such paternalistic\ninterventions lost some of their appeal in the 1970s, paternalism is considered an\nenduring characteristic of Dutch governmental institutions (Duyvendak, 1999).\ninterventions have regained popularity in recent decades, albeit only for specific\ncategories of citizens: `Paternalism is very much publicly supported, yet for other\npeople: the urban ``vulnerable'' poor'. Many local security policies display a com-\nbination of care and coercion that seems to have become the hallmark of that part\nof the current Dutch welfare state that deals with what it considers risky popula-\ntions (see, e.g., Schinkel and Van den Berg, 2011; Schilder, 2009). These `risky\npopulations' are most often poor, often non-white, and are assumed to be found\nin big cities.\nThese recent forms of paternalism bring to mind Wacquant's (2012) discussion\nof a bifurcated governmentality that is liberal at the top and paternalistic and\npunitive at the bottom. It also fits with Peck and Tickell's analysis of `roll-out\nneoliberalism' that entails `new modes of ``social'' and penal policymaking,\nconcerned specifically with the aggressive reregulation, disciplining, and contain-\nment of those marginalized or dispossessed by the neoliberalization of the 1980s'\nSince the 1990s such interventions have increasingly been framed in terms of\nsecurity. The Dutch term veiligheid, which invokes both security and safety, has\nbecome increasingly important to the understanding of social problems and the\nformulation of a wide range of policies (Pakes, 2010; Schuilenburg and Van\nthe more delimited notion of crime to the broader notion of security resulted in a\ndrive to create more encompassing and comprehensive policies, in which security\nwas to be the concern not only of various state institutions but also of civil society\nand citizens. This broad scope was expressed in the naming of such policies as the\nIntegrated Safety/Security Policy, or Integraal Veiligheidsbeleid. The focus on the\nnebulous trope of security has been accompanied by a growth in the budget\nallocated for security-related policies; between 2002 and 2012 national expenditures\nSafety/Security Policy is implemented through a wide range of interconnected state\nand semi-state organizations.\nThe rise of this type of security discourse and related policies is intertwined with\ngrowing nationalist and anti-migrant sentiments and increasingly racialized under-\nstandings of social problems. In public imagination, and in less explicit ways in\nofficial discourses, overlast and crime have become firmly linked to what in the\nNetherlands are glossed as allochtonen, people with `non-Western' migrant back-\ngrounds, and to Moroccan-Dutch young men in particular (Pakes, 2004; Mutsaers,\n2014).2 Ostensibly universal policies meant to tackle social problems are often\nspecifically geared toward poor, non-white populations with migration back-\nAs I demonstrate below, the thick institutional landscapes that pivot around the\ntrope of security are central in the translation of racialized ideas about society and\nits problems \u00ad particularly associations between migration, minorities and crime \u00ad\ninto actual policies and street-level practices. I use the term `racialization' to cap-\nture such processes despite the fact that in the Dutch context `ethnicity' is a more\ncommon term than `race', in order to stress that the ascription of characteristics on\nthe basis of group membership is a highly generalizing, involuntary and negative\nimposition. Different groups have been racialized at various historical junctures; in\nAmsterdam, at the time of research, Moroccan-Dutch young men were the key\nDealing with the `notorious' Diamantbuurt\nFor some three decades, public debates in the Netherlands have revolved around\nthe alleged problems with people with migrant backgrounds, and the folly of earlier\nIn 2004 Amsterdam's Diamantbuurt became pivotal in these public debates after\nreporting in national daily De Volkskrant on a conflict between a couple \u00ad desig-\nnated by the quintessentially Dutch pseudonyms Bert and Marja \u00ad and local\n`Moroccan' youths who were hanging out just opposite from their house.3 It\ncame to symbolize the allegedly beleaguered state of ordinary (white) Dutch in\nthe big city, due particularly to the misbehaviour of young `Moroccan' men\nThe Diamantbuurt area has a long history of boys and young men, most with\nMoroccan-Dutch backgrounds, hanging around in groups on certain corners and\npassageways in the neighbourhood. Some of these young men were involved in\ncriminal activities. Police and policy circles first categorized their loose networks as\na `nuisance-causing (overlastgevende) youth group', and in 2009, they identified it as\na criminal youth group, naming it the Van Woustraat Group after the name of the\nstreet where the youths congregated.\nAs I argue elsewhere, the Diamantbuurt became an icon of the alleged problems\nof the multicultural Netherlands, particularly related to `Moroccan problem\nyouths' (De Koning, 2013). As a consequence of its iconic status, the\nDiamantbuurt became a test case for local politicians, the district administration\nand the myriad institutions involved with the neighbourhood. Media attention put\npressure on the administration and various institutions to intervene, since the\ntrouble in the neighbourhood was taken as an indication of governmental failure,\nand its alleged inability or unwillingness to acknowledge and act upon problems\nwith racialized `others'.\nThe conception of the Diamantbuurt as an exceptional problem neighbourhood\ninstigated and facilitated an increased policy focus on the neighbourhood and\nprompted the formulation of spatially targeted policy initiatives, particularly\nwithin the so-called youth and security policy domain. The major challenge was\nhow to deal with complaints about overlast \u00ad a term that refers to a wide range of\nbehaviour, from hanging around, to littering, causing nuisance or harassing of\npassers-by, and is used most often in connection to youths (see Martineau, 2006:\n102\u00ad4) \u00ad and the relatively high incidence of youth criminality in the area, both of\nwhich were understood as primarily related to Moroccan-Dutch male youths.\nThe youth and security policy network\nAt the time of research, most policies were designed at the city level, while a district\nadministration was responsible for the implementation of policy and the manage-\nment of relations between (semi)government agencies and the population. Policies\nfor specific neighbourhoods, in this case the Diamantbuurt, were developed at the\ndistrict level; this involved close cooperation of various state and non-state actors\n(housing corporations, social work agencies) in the management of urban space,\nand entailed significant overlap between different policy domains, for example\nhousing, social welfare and security.\nIn response to the media attention and public uproar caused by the Bert and\nMarja affair, the district commissioned research and policy advice and created\nextra capacity to oversee a new approach to problems with Diamantbuurt\nyouths. Over the years, this evolved into a `youth and security' (jeugd en veiligheid)\npolicy that brought together a wide range of actors and agencies, and was overseen\nby officials from the city district's youth and security division.\nThe policy was envisioned as a network linking many partners (ketenpartners,\nchain partners), from local authorities to youth work, outreach social work, debt\nrelief, truancy officers, police and public prosecution, and housing corporations, all\nof which shared information and coordinated their activities under the auspices of\nthe district authorities. Much of its attention was focused on the\nDiamantbuurt. Similar youth and security policies have been developed in\nother cities in the Netherlands (see, e.g., Kaulingfreks, 2015). They have much in\ncommon with English multi-agency partnerships designed to tackle local problems\nof crime and disorder, described by Daniel McCarthy (2014). Such close cooper-\nation has been hailed as a solution to the fragmentation of governmental\napproaches in various institutional domains, from security to immigration control\nThis youth and security policy network developed an extensive range of\nmeasures directed at youth nuisance and youth criminality, drawn, in part, from\nprograms and practices of many other social agencies. At the end of 2011, for\nexample, an action plan targeting the Diamantbuurt's `hard core' of criminal\nyoung men included measures from the realms of security and policing, social\nwork, and physical environment and housing.4 The policy's target group varied\nfrom as many as 180 youths to as few as 20, depending on the specific aspect of\nyouth and security spectrum that was emphasized (overlast or crime) and the scale\nthat was prioritized (neighbourhood, district or city).\nBesides close cooperation among various institutional actors, information gath-\nering became another key governmental technique. Willem Schinkel (2011)\ndescribes the Dutch state's escalation in `actuarial government' through the estab-\nlishment of databases and surveillance registers that enable intricate calculations of\nrisk and are supposed to allow state actors to spot early signs of trouble in order to\navert unwanted future outcomes. According to Schinkel (2011: 367), such archives\nare part of the rhetoric of `prevention' and `early detection of risks'. Yet at the same\ntime, they facilitate the policing of families and criminalization of subjects with mul-\ntiple archival registries.. . . [T]he current `archive fever' is a form of prepression that\ncombines prevention and repression.\nThe gathering and sharing of detailed information on young people within the network\nwas indeed an important aspect of the district's security approach. At the district level,\nvarious agencies, from `street coaches' to social work and different branches of the\npolice, as well as individual residents, contributed to the mapping of unruly youths and\ntheir behaviour in public space. At the time of research, the district authorities' project\ncoordinator for youth and security kept continuously updated street maps that rec-\norded the movements and contacts of some 180 youths from the district who had been\nwritten up in connection to overlast in public space. Her team decided on appropriate\ntrajectories for these unruly youngsters. This approach entailed forms of prepression,\nas causing nuisance in public space was taken as an early sign of future deviance, and\nacted upon accordingly; it included both repression and prevention strategies. A sur-\nveillance and archiving machinery was put into place to spot these early signs, and to\nact upon their occurrences to prevent undesirable futures.\nIn tandem with the security policies at the district level, the city administration\ndeveloped the Top600 Approach, in place since 2011. With its emphasis on sur-\nveillance and data gathering, and preventative incursion into the lives of designated\nyoung male habitual offenders in order to preclude future deviant behaviour, the\nTop 600 Approach is a textbook example of prepression.\nThe Top600 focused on a list of 600 young men who were suspected of\ninvolvement in so-called high-impact crime (mostly street robberies, theft and\nhouse break-ins). They were not listed on account of ongoing investigations or\nthe suspicion of concrete misdemeanours, but because they were considered repeat\noffenders who were likely to continue committing crimes. The Top600 combined\nthe efforts of 30 organizations, including police, city and district administration,\nthe judiciary, rehabilitation services, and public health and social work agencies.\nThe Top600 team designed a tailor-made combination of care and coercion for\neach subject, i.e. per person included on the list, to be overseen by one `director'.\nDepending on the nature of the problems, the director would be recruited from\nthe police, the probation office or the public health authorities. These directors\nwould be able to organize help for their `client', in terms of treatment, work and\neven housing, as long as the client stuck to the plan that was laid out for him.\nThe Approach was presented as an exemplary governmental technique with its\nclose cooperation between a wide range of governmental organizations from social\nwork and public health authorities to public prosecution and the police. The\nTop600 Approach was portrayed as a model to be followed in the streamlining\nand improvement of government in other domains.\nThose included in the Top600 list were often described as `the most violent\nyoung criminals' in news media. However, as far as I could ascertain, the list\nincluded youth who had committed only very light crimes as well as those involved\nin heavier cases. A lawyer who worked for a number of young men on the Top600\nlist argued that the criteria for inclusion were far from straightforward, an impres-\nsion that was confirmed in various informal conversations with policy actors. An\nactual conviction was only one of many criteria, which also included number of\n`contacts' with the police and arraignments over a number of years (see\nGroenendaal and Van der Venn, 2012). The lawyer said she saw a clear corres-\npondence between the target group of the Top600 and those singled out in public\ndiscourses. `From what I have seen, the guys that I know who are on the list really\nfit the current political climate. They are all those types that people react to\nstrongly, of whom they are afraid and feel they should be taken off the streets.'\nThe Top600 Approach was portrayed as the answer to the limitations of regular\napproaches, as `thinking outside the box' to tackle the persistent deviancy of young\nmen throughout the city. It presented a combination of repression and care that\nwas meant to leave the selected habitual offenders no choice but to either cooperate\nfully and be guided out of their life of crime or to be constantly monitored, have\ntheir daily routines disturbed and be pestered by the police, a practice dubbed Very\nIrritating Policing. Being closely associated with Mayor Van der Laan, the Top600\nwas presented as the hard-nosed (Social Democratic) response to the purported\nleft-wing neglect of the problems with multicultural society, and its alleged naivety\nand softness with regards to `allochtonen' (Prins, 2002).\nEven though the Top600 was a citywide policy, it was fully integrated into\nthe district's security approach and relied on much of its institutional infrastruc-\nture. The policies initiated at the district and city levels included a number of\nthe same policy officials and street-level professionals such as social workers and\npolice officers, and had some of the same young men as their target. They,\nmoreover, relied on the same information streams and often coordinated their\nactions.\nBlurred boundaries\nAt the district level, representatives from police, district and city authorities and\nyouth and outreach social work agencies exchanged information and calibrated\ntheir approaches to what they considered the most at-risk and troublesome subjects\nin the area. Their policies combined care and coercion, prevention and repression.\nTheir concerted efforts created a network that allowed for a diffuse policing shared\namong many agents, and led to a blurring of boundaries between social and welfare\nwork and policing, between repressive agents of the state, and those that extend a\nhelping hand and trusted ear.\nDevelopments in the youth-and-security network illustrate this blurring of care\nand coercion. In the years following the 2004 Bert and Marja incident, the regular\nyouth work open house that had provided the young men with a space to meet and\nwork out was cancelled. These unruly young men were no longer to be served out\nof the regular youth budget. Instead, outreach social work organization\nStreetcornerwork started organizing an open house as a way to establish relation-\nships with this hard-to-reach group. This open house was presented as a way to\nrecruit clients and thereby facilitate the real work of helping solve the young men's\nproblems, whether they be debts, unemployment or homelessness. Instead of being\nable to resort to regular youth work, the local young men were thus targeted by\noutreach social work with the aim of rehabilitating them. It is telling that, despite\ntheir indispensable role in the youth-and-security network, Streetcornerworkers\nwere regarded with suspicion by other network partners on account of their\nclose relations with their clients.\nIn contrast with the tougher stance in the social work domain, the Top600\nApproach introduced forms of soft policing akin to those described by Daniel\nMcCarthy (2014), which added to the blurring of care and coercion. The\nTop600 Approach was meant to assist repeat offenders choose another life,\namong other things by providing help in finding housing, work or a traineeship.\nTop600 directors were to have regular meetings with their `customers' to keep\nthem on track and help them better their lives. However, as was the case in\nMcCarthy's study policing, such caring advice was always backed up by the\nthreat of repression if advice was not followed and young men would stray from\ntheir prescribed path.\nThe diffuse policing enacted through this policy network targeted one particular\ngroup, Moroccan-Dutch young men who were at the heart of the Diamantbuurt's\nnotoriety. As I demonstrate below, the discriminatory effects of such policing were\nboth dispersed and ubiquitous.\nDiffuse policing\nOur interviews with Moroccan-Dutch young men from the Diamantbuurt give a\nsense of the interconnectedness and cumulative nature of the youth and security\nlandscape discussed above. These young men shared a sense of injustice in connec-\ntion to their treatment by the authorities, particularly the police. A local youth\nworker in his late 30s, Sayid, who grew up in the area and knows many of the\nfamilies of the unruly young men who are his charges, said: `In my days, you were\nnot monitored. Now you're being followed by the district and the police'. A young\nlocal concurred: `You really become para [paranoid]'.5 His distrust extended not\nonly to district officials and police officers, but also to local youth workers, whom\nmany of these young men considered to be in cahoots with the police.\nThis exchange reflects the changes in local security policies that had occurred in\nthe years leading up to the research. Especially after the 2010 ascendency of the\nright-wing VVD party in the district administration, security policies had been\nstepped up, transforming the neighbourhood into a hostile space for local young\nmen, particularly those of Moroccan descent. CCTV-cameras had been installed,\nhanging around in groups began to be severely policed and any transgressive\nbehaviour was swiftly and heavily sanctioned.\nBelow I draw on our interviews with some of these young men to explore their\nexperiences with youth and security policies. These young men spoke almost exclu-\nsively about the youth and security landscape in terms of surveillance and repres-\nsion. Even more `caring' interventions, such as those of family visitors or Top600\ndirectors, and welfare figures like the local youth workers, were understood as\nrepressive. The Streetcornerworkers were the only institutional representatives\nwhom this group of young men trusted.\nStreet coaches\nRachid was born and raised in Amsterdam's Diamantbuurt. When I interviewed\nthis 18-year-old in 2012, he straddled the border between being a poster boy for\nlocal youth work and being seen too often in the company of the local drug dealer.\nAfter talking about the regular ID checks to which he is subjected in his neigh-\nbourhood, Rachid turned to another encounter with the authorities:\nOne time the District came to my door.\nAnouk: Really, why?\n[They said:] `We see Rachid in the company of older youths too often. He's out in the\nstreets too late at night'. I mean, that's none of their business!. . . I thought it was all a\nload of crap! It happened to a guy next door, he had to be home [by 4 PM] for three\nmonths.. . .\nAnouk: Why?\nHe was also someone who was seen with the wrong kind of guys, according to them,\nthat is.\nThe encounter with the `District' that Rachid describes concerns a family visitation\nconducted as part of the street coaches program. At the time of research, the\ndistrict authorities contracted a foundation to run a street coaches program that\ncombined surveillance, intervention and data gathering regarding youth nuisance\nin the streets with home visits to unruly youths. According to its website, this\nFoundation for Tackling Nuisance Amsterdam, or Stichting Aanpak Overlast\nAmsterdam (SAOS), was established in 2006 in order to `combat youth nuisance\nand antisocial behaviour in a decisive and efficient manner'. It claims to fill the gap\nbetween youth work and the police, and states that it focuses on groups of youths\nwho display antisocial behaviour that in most cases does not constitute a legal\noffense but is rather a transgression of social norms.6 As one of the founders\nexplained to me:\nAs street coaches we operate between on the one hand the police, and on the other\nyouth work; we correct [the youths] when needed, but also advise and listen to\nthem.. . . But it is clear we're not their pals, we do not build a relationship of trust\nwith them.\nDistrict authorities could buy SAOS's services to patrol areas that were perceived\nas suffering from youth nuisance. These street coaches were selected from a pool of\nprivate security guards employed by a large security company, and then further\nemployed by SAOS. Their task was, on the one hand, to prevent and intervene in\nyouth nuisance in public space. On the other, they were expected to identify per-\npetrators and more generally keep tabs on the public behaviour and social lives of\nlocal youngsters. The latter information was noted down in daily reports, which\nwere sent to local police stations and district policy officials. Street coaches were a\nmajor source of data for the street maps that were kept by the district authorities.\nSAOS also employed so-called family visitors, like the one who visited Rachid,\nto follow up on those youths who have been identified twice in connection with pub-\nlic nuisance. Family visitors were meant to enter families into a three-month-long\nprogram intended to improve their child's problem behaviour. A family pro-\ngram could include measures like the curfew that was imposed on Rachid's\nneighbour.\nSuch `behind the front door' programs have been critiqued as an assault on\npeople's privacy and civil rights (Schilder, 2009). The selectivity of such programs \u00ad\ntargeting particular spaces, groups and behaviours judged as potentially trouble-\nsome \u00ad has received less attention (but see Schinkel and Van den Berg, 2011). In the\nSouth District, they were employed in those areas that were seen to suffer from\nyouth overlast, particularly in the Diamantbuurt. While their work was not expli-\ncitly racialized, the people, behaviours and spaces that street coaches targeted both\ndrew on and reproduced racialized notions of troublesome behaviour and risky\npopulations.\nEveryday policing\nDanny, in his 40s, with short blond hair and a friendly expression, had been the\nDiamantbuurt's buurtregisseur or community police officer for a number of years at\nthe time of research. In an interview in 2012, I asked him about the measures that\nwere taken to combat overlast. To my surprise he said that at the moment there was\nno samenscholingsverbod or ban on gathering in specific places. Yet a number of the\nlocal young men I spoke with discussed such bans, and argued that they stayed\naway from the neighbourhood's public spaces on account of the many fines they\nhad received for violating that ban.\nDanny explained: `The municipal bylaw [APV, Algemene Plaatselijke\nVerordening] does offer a number of tools to take repressive action on those\nspots where they hang out.. . . We use them if necessary. Aimless hanging around\nagainst a porch is one of them.' He continued, describing how they try to keep the\nyoung men in the neighbourhood in check:\nWhat we do is look very closely at those spots in the neighbourhood that deserve extra\nattention. If CCTV-cameras are installed at the Smaragdplein, we say to each other,\n`What's going to happen next?' Because you have a good sense of the neighbourhood,\nyou can predict that it will probably shift to the Lutmastraat, where you have a small\nplayground. And within two weeks that set [of youths] was there. What do you do\nthen, as police? You go check it out, what is happening there, how do they behave?\nAnd, in fact, without doing anything concrete, [the set] moves again, simply [because\nthe police are] passing by. . . because these guys themselves feel uncomfortable. And\ndon't think now that we pass by ten times an hour.\nWhen we talked to young men who were targeted by these measures, there seemed\nto be quite some confusion concerning the actual measures that were in place. This\nvagueness did not diminish but rather added to the measure's efficacy, creating a\nperpetual uncertainty regarding what was forbidden and what was allowed among\nthe young men who knew themselves to be under police scrutiny. It also gave\nindividual police officers more leverage in reprimanding or fining youths. Such\nambivalence was, at least in some cases, intentional, rather than the result of a\nfaltering communication. A social worker told me that the district authorities\nencouraged a repressive approach and stimulated police officers to use their dis-\ncretionary power to act on small infringements. The Top600 even formally includes\nthis kind of `Very Irritating Policing' (their term) as a way to deal with Top600\nyouths who do not comply with the program.\nA lawyer at a firm that defended several young men from the Diamantbuurt told\nme that one of her clients had been fined five times in one day for minor and rather\ncommon transgressions, such as riding his bike on the sidewalk. She says she feels\nthat the treatment of these young men has changed radically: `Especially this\nharrying. It started already before the Top600. I remember a postcard the guys\nin the Diamantbuurt found in their mailbox, some eight years ago. . . It said, ``We\nare watching you''. So I think the police have been on their case for quite a while.'\nShe saw a clear connection between the changes in security policy in Amsterdam\nand the public focus on particular types of nuisance and crime \u00ad rowdy, constant\npresence in public space and so-called high-impact crime \u00ad and on particular types\nof perpetrator: young men with non-white, minority backgrounds.\nAmir and Mohamed (Mo), both in their early 20s, discussed their experiences\nwith the changing security policies in the neighbourhood. Amir, the more talkative\nof the two, took the lead:\nAmir: Those cameras don't influence me, I can walk right by them 50 times.\nMo: You do feel they are looking over your shoulder, but you get used to it. There is\nalso a ban on hanging out.\nAmir: I did get fined a number of times, but I didn't pay them.\nAnouk: What were the fines for?\nAmir: For assembly, for leaning against things; there are various fines. Boom, he\nprints it for you. You're also not allowed to hang on the ledge of the Edelsteen [the\nlocal community centre]. Danny really likes to fine Mo.\nMo: But my lawyer makes them disappear again.\nAmir: They drive by and give you a fine. When you come home, you find out that you\nhave a fine. You feel so powerless. Of course, you could lodge a formal complaint or\ngo to court, but well. . . This way they force you to get into trouble.\nAmir said that he no longer walks through the neighbourhood with his head raised\nhigh, like he used to. `Much has changed', he said. `It used to be a nice neighbour-\nhood, much more lively. Guys no longer dare to hang in the streets'. Mo agreed:\n`Now they are at the shisha lounge or coffee shop [cafes where one can buy and\nsmoke soft drugs] all day'.\nAccording to most residents, everyday policing was stepped up significantly after\nthe neighbourhood's rise to notoriety in 2004. Everyone had stories to tell about\nthe extra rounds made by the police car, or the policemen on bikes who would\ncheck out groups of youths hanging out in the neighbourhood. Peter, a well-known\nneighbourhood resident, liked to recount the time when he put some chairs on the\ncentral square during Ramadan and invited a number of the local young men to sit\nand chat. After a few hours of conversation, the young men remarked that they\nwould never be allowed to sit like this in the square if it wasn't for Peter's presence.\nThis spatial intensification and targeted approach is complemented by other\ntypes of policing that, unlike the work of local police officers, is not specific to\nthe area and not based on familiarity with its particular young people. As C\n\u00b8 ankaya\nhas demonstrated, this type of policing easily lends itself to ethnic profiling. Take\nMostafa's story. Mostafa is exceptional among his friends from the neighbourhood\non account of his successful educational career and clean rap sheet. In an interview\nin 2012, he told us that he, nonetheless, is often stopped by police officers:\nWhen I ride my scooter, there are always officers on motorbike who want to see my\nlicence plate and ID. [When I ask,] `Why?' `Traffic control.' `Am I the only one?' `This\ntime, yes.' In the summer this happens to me like five times per week.. . . They check\nprior convictions, whether the scooter is stolen, unpaid fines.\nMostafa's story is not an isolated incident. In the context of proactive policing,\ntraffic laws are often used as a pretext to investigate the identity of persons that\npolice officers consider of interest (C\n\u00b8 ankaya, 2012). Those judgment calls on the\npart of police officers largely rely on racialized categorizations of the population in\nlikely perpetrators \u00ad young, male, with minority backgrounds \u00ad and potential vic-\ntims: the body of ordinary citizens that needs to be protected from the latter.\nWhile the Top600 Approach was presented as a fight against high-impact crime\nand the city's persistent young criminals, it also paid a good deal of attention to the\nmuch publicized overlast of young people by targeting many of the young men who\nwere often out in public. The Top600 added a personalized focus to the more\ngeneral criminalization of conduct in public space in the Netherlands\n(Martineau, 2006) and the policing of categories of likely perpetrators, since it\ndirected attention to the conduct of specific young men who were included on\nthe list.\nDanny, the community police officer, explained that `the Top600 [list] gets\nundivided attention.. . . Everyone knows who's on [the list], everything is registered.\nWe have a complete picture, almost hour by hour.' Mo, who was on the Top600\nlist, told us that he was followed and monitored wherever he goes. He said police\nofficers regularly called out to him by name in public, outing him as a person of\ninterest for the police: `When the police drive by and call you by name, you really\nfeel put on the spot. [When they say] ``Hey Mo!'', I say, ``Hey asshole''.'\nI asked Martin, a police officer assigned to the Top600, what he thought about\nMo's feeling of being harassed by the police. I mentioned the case of being called\nout by name in public. Martin noted that doing so can be a form of intervention,\nespecially if someone on the list has made it clear that he does not want to cooper-\nate. However, he also noted that officers in the regular police service generally do\nnot know details about a person's trajectory. They might simply act on the Top600\nstatus, irrespective of whether the person in question `behaves' (and should there-\nfore be left alone) or refuses to cooperate (which would justify the `Very Irritating\nPolicing' approach). He described how officers might respond to a complaint about\nnuisance (overlastmelding) that brings them to youths who are part of the Van\nWoustraat Group:\nThey ask for their IDs, call into the precinct and hear that four of them are in the\nTop600. The uniformed police will then probably say, `Hey guys, you're in the\nTop600. We don't have anything on you now, but mind you, we're keeping an eye\non you'. So, yes, they do get that stamp among police officers, and I can imagine they\ndon't like it.\nWhen I asked Martin whether the fines for small infringements were not dispro-\nportionate, he said:\nI sometimes also run a red light, but I am not in the Top600. And if I was, I would do\nanything to take care that I got off that list. That may be quite harsh, but, apparently,\nit does work, because the nuisance in that area has stopped and many of the guys are\ndoing quite well.\nIntensified policing of the neighbourhood and of particular figures like the `mem-\nbers' of the Van Woustraat Group or Top600 `clients' likely raised the number of\nrecorded offenses in the area. This is not only because the chances of criminal\nactivities being discovered increased, but also due to the proliferation of acts\nthat were seen to require police action and constitute an offense. Moreover, as\nFemke Kaulingfreks (2015) argues, such police presence may set off a vicious\ncircle between close surveillance and repression and unruly, disturbing behaviour\nof these young men. Anecdotes from the Diamantbuurt indicate that intensified\npolicing also contributed to a rise in incidents that were directly related to that\npolice presence, such as charges for insulting a police officer or resisting arrest.\nThe law firm that represented a number of young men from the Diamantbuurt\nwas highly critical of the Top600 Approach. One of the lawyers had started the\nlong process of trying to get one client off that list, among other things with\nrecourse to the European Charter for Human Rights. The lawyer I cited earlier\nfelt the Approach became a `self-fulfilling prophecy'.\nBecause you're on the list and you're from that neighbourhood, it means you'll be\narrested quickly. And you'll be sent home after two days because they actually have\nnothing on you, but you do have a citation next to your name. When that happens a\nfew times, they'll say, see, you have a lot of police contacts.. . . Even though you are\nactively sought out by the police because you are on that list. Because they have a\ndescription of the subject: guy on a black scooter with a black jacket, and, well, that\ncan be anyone in Amsterdam. And then they start stopping guys from the list, that's\njust how it works.\nLike the other security policies discussed here, the Top600 Approach did not expli-\ncitly employ racialized definitions of the problem or of its target group, and the\nprogram officer I interviewed even vehemently denied that they took ethnic back-\nground into account. However, at the time of the interview, the young men from\nthe Diamantbuurt constituted the largest single subgroup in the Top600, and the\nlawyer's comments give us a sense of the subtle ways in which the policy, in\nresponding to racialized understandings of social problems, reproduces a racialized\nfocus on particular types, behaviours and places.\nProducing inequality\nThe youth and security programs and measures discussed above impact the way\nvarious categories of persons are monitored and disciplined and what interventions\nare designed to reform them. The range of organizations that was involved\ntogether created what I have called diffuse policing that combined intensive moni-\ntoring, care and repression in highly focused, targeted ways. The cumulative effects\nof the security landscape I have sketched above produce highly unequal experi-\nences of the state.\nAs illustrated by the specific examples discussed above, particular areas that\nwere perceived as problematic saw a thickening of the youth and security land-\nscape, which made young people in those areas far more likely to be registered as\nrisky or troublesome and become the target of interventions by a variety of state\nagents. In her discussion of a similarly deprived neighbourhood in Utrecht, Femke\nKaulingfreks (2015) even speaks of a penal panopticon.\nIn the specific, limited areas in which street coaches were deployed, unruly\nbehaviour was likely to have very different consequences than it would in areas\nthat were seen as unproblematic and not requiring street coach surveillance. Unruly\nbehaviour in `problematic areas' could easily lead to the inclusion in the district's\nregister of problem youths and could result in the start of a family program,\nwhereas such behaviour was unlikely to have consequences in `unproblematic',\nwealthier areas in the same city district. Moreover, everyday policing practices in\nthe Diamantbuurt had turned the neighbourhood into a hostile space for young\nmen with Moroccan-Dutch backgrounds, who, more generally, were habitually\ncategorized as potential perpetrators. They were fined for small transgressions,\nand the neighbourhood provided easy grounds for criminalization. Finally, the\nTop600 Approach had more personalized effects in terms of experiences with the\nstate. It, however, also drew heavily from the same city spaces and categories seen\nas particularly problematic. When included on the list, young men would get full,\noften unwanted, invasive attention from actors across the youth and security\nlandscape.\nThese unequal experiences with the state were produced by the spatial focus of\nyouth and security policies, and their attention to specific types of persons and\nbehaviours. In line with Simon Hallsworth's argument, we could understand these\npolicies as control regimes that, without being framed in racial terms, `either licence\nracial targeting, or which appear guaranteed to reproduce it' (2014: 308).\nMoreover, the security policies and practices discussed here shared many of the\nroutine categorizations of the populace as likely perpetrators and potential victims\nthat, as C\n\u00b8 ankaya (2012) notes, are mobilized in proactive policing and which\nreproduce a racialized common sense about crime.\nThe diffuse policing enacted by the dense institutional youth and security land-\nscape enveloped the targeted youths in a dense and sticky net of surveillance,\ndiscipline and interventions that was hard to escape or contest. This is well illu-\nstrated by the case that one of the young men, supported by the law firm mentioned\nearlier, brought against the city of Amsterdam in 2014 to fight his inclusion in the\nTop600 list. The case was brought to an administrative law court since, in a legal\nsense, the Top600 Approach was merely an administrative measure. The lawyer for\nthe city argued that the only issue that could be contested was the exchange of\ninformation between the various organizations that cooperated in the context of\nthe Top600 Approach. Otherwise, the plaintiffs should turn to specific agencies or\ninstitutions that they felt had overstepped their mandate or crossed lines of privacy\nor equity.\nThis line of thinking was repeated in a public meeting in 2016 intended to discuss\nthe Top600 as it was going into its fifth year. A policy official with the Top600\nextolled the efficacy of the Approach, stressing that, over time, it had been suc-\ncessful in bringing the radically different worlds of care and repression together.\nForty organizations now worked together under its auspices, with very high success\nrates, for instance in terms of the significant decrease in the number of crimes\ncommitted by those on the list. And yet, the policy official argued, in a juridical\nsense, we only exchange information.\nConclusion\nEuropean grassroots activists and critical social scientists increasingly join their US\ncounterparts in addressing racialized forms of policing. This article has argued that\nto understand the effects of racialized policing in Europe, we need to look at the\nwider institutional landscape involved in monitoring, disciplining and intervening\nin the lives of `problematic' or `at-risk' populations, and pay attention to the diffuse\npolicing it enacts.\nUsing the case of the Diamantbuurt, this article demonstrates that the Dutch\nwelfare state, with its extensive apparatus and legacy of benign paternalism, is key\nto how security policies translate the racialization of social problems common in\npublic discourses into actual policies and urban everyday life. The security pro-\ngrams discussed here all combined forms of care and coercion, manifesting the new\npaternalism observed in the Netherlands more generally. They relied heavily on\ninformation gathering and detailed surveillance in order to signal risks and try to\navert future calamities. Such prepression programs were enacted by a wide range of\ngovernmental actors, from public health authorities to social work, rehabilitation\nservices and the police and prosecutors, whose concerted actions together produced\na dense network of information gathering, surveillance and intervention. Policy\nnetworks that brought together welfare and disciplinary actors enacted what I have\nlabelled diffuse policing. Drawing on my ethnographic findings, I have argued that,\nas a result, particular categories in particular places, and oftentimes even particular\nindividuals, are intensely monitored, and if the policy network so decides, treated\nto an insistent combination of care and coercion.\nWhile these policies did not explicitly target racialized groups, they were often\ndesigned with particular groups or problems in mind. In Amsterdam, in the context\nof virulent debates about the `failure of multicultural society' and the `trouble with\nallochtonen', security policies were designed to showcase a serious engagement with\nthe type of people, incidents and places identified with such issues. They were,\nmoreover, implemented in a spatially specific manner, targeting particular `prob-\nlem' areas. These foci were shared by youth and security policies at various levels\nthat complemented and reinforced one another. Together they resulted in an insti-\ntutional landscape that intensively monitored and insistently intervened in the lives\nof particularly Moroccan-Dutch boys and young men from the Diamantbuurt and\nenvirons.\nThe accretion of such policies, which in themselves were often well intended, had\nfar-reaching effects for those who were its main targets. These enveloping, invasive\ninstitutional interventions were hard to escape, contest or challenge, since they were\ndesigned to finally act decisively on the people and issues that various governmen-\ntal actors had been unable to solve and that represented a highly politicized test\ncase for government. We may read this as the Dutch equivalent to the policing of\nthe projects described by Fassin (2013), which had as its ultimate goal to reassert\nthe social order. To combat the era's perceived number-one problem \u00ad unruly,\nstreet-oriented Moroccan-Dutch young men who may to varying degrees be\ninvolved in criminal activities \u00ad much seemed allowed, including stretching juridical\nboundaries and state powers.\n"
