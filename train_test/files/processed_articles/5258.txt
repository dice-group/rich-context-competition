We tested\nspatial perception in the workspace using a combination of haptic matching and line drawing tasks.\nThere were 132 participants with varying degrees of visual ability ranging from congenitally blind to\nnormally sighted. Each participant was blindfolded and asked to match a haptic target position felt\nunder a table with their nondominant hand using a pen in their dominant hand. Once the pen was\nin position on the tabletop, they had to draw a line of equal length to a previously felt reference\nobject by moving the pen laterally. We used targets at three different locations to evaluate\nwhether different starting positions relative to the body give rise to different matching errors,\ndrawn line lengths, or drawn line angles. We found no influence of visual ability on matching error,\ndrawn line length, or line angle, but we found that early-blind participants are slightly less\nconsistent in their matching errors across space. We conclude that the elementary haptic\nabilities tested in these tasks do not depend on visual experience.\nCorresponding author:\nJacob S.

In humans, the visual system plays a\ncrucial role in information processing, especially at distances that cannot be physically\nreached. For nearby stimuli, touch and proprioception help to form a complete picture of\nthe world. Visual information plays an important role in the development of various spatial\nabilities, as it provides information about the position and arrangement of the surrounding\nenvironment that the nervous system would not otherwise necessarily have access to.\nEffects of Early Blindness\nSeveral studies suggest that the brain may respond to visual deprivation by improving the\nsensitivity of the remaining sensory systems. Early-blind individuals show enhanced skills for\nsome auditory tasks such as localization of a single sound on the horizontal plane (Lessard,\nPare\nhave also been shown to have lower spatial thresholds for tactile discrimination of stimuli\nPostma, Zuidhoek, Noordzij, and Kappers (2007) found that early-blind and late-blind adults\nwere significantly faster than blindfolded-sighted adults at placing wooden shapes into a board\nwith corresponding cutouts, as well as in placing the same shapes in the correct positions on a\nflat surface from memory. However, some studies did not find superior performance in haptics\ndue to absence of vision. Jones and Vierck (1973) did not find a difference in threshold between\nblind and sighted individuals in detecting which of two stimuli pressed against their arm was\nlonger. Gori et al. (2010) found that visually impaired children (one late-blind and the rest\nearly-blind) were slightly better than sighted children at tactile object size discrimination but\nthat they were drastically worse at object orientation discrimination, perhaps suggesting that\norientation perception relies more heavily on the visual system.\nOn the other hand, blind individuals unsurprisingly suffer from deficits in a number of\nskills ranging from auditory and spatial localization to navigation (see Cuturi, Aggius-Vella,\nCampus, Parmiggiani, & Gori, 2016 for a review on this topic). Recent studies show that\nearly-blind individuals fail in localizing sounds under particular auditory settings (Gori,\nSandini, Martinoli, & Burr, 2013; Vercillo, Milne, Gori, & Goodale, 2015). Hollins and\nKelly (1988) observed an interesting discrepancy between early-blind adults' ability to\npoint to an object on a table after having walked partway around the table and their\nability to place the object in its original position after having walked around the table;\nwhereas blindfolded-sighted people performed well in both of these tasks, early-blind\nadults performed well at replacement but not at pointing. It has also been shown that\nwhile early-blind and blindfolded-sighted adults are both better at remembering\nsymmetrical configurations of blocks on a table than at remembering asymmetrical ones,\nthe early-blind group was worse at remembering vertically symmetrical configurations than\nhorizontal ones (Cattaneo et al., 2010). The authors proposed that the blindfolded-sighted\nadults were able to benefit from enhanced attention to vertical symmetry granted by the\nvisual system.\nIn some cases, it does not appear to matter when a person first became blind to have\nreduced performance at a skill. Gentaz and Hatwell (1998) observed no differences between\nearly-blind and late-blind adults in their ability to match the orientation of a rod to that of a\nreference rod but concluded that their reliance on gravitational cues for information differed\nfrom that of sighted participants (Gentaz & Hatwell, 1996).\nHaptic Space Perception\nWhen describing locations of objects, people can rely on two kinds of frames of reference.\nUsing an egocentric reference frame, one might describe objects as ``one meter to my left'' or\nas ``ten degrees to my right.'' Using an allocentric reference frame, one relies on external\nreferences, such as ``one meter to the left of the laptop'' or ``below the table.'' To manipulate\nan object, one needs to know its egocentric location, but when remembering or describing its\nposition, it can be more useful to rely on the allocentric location because it does not depend\non one's own spatial orientation. There is evidence that eye-centered coordinates are\nfundamental for the association of sensory signals (Cohen & Andersen, 2002; Jay &\nSparks, 1987; Pouget, Deneve, & Duhamel, 2002), and the visual modality might offer a\nspatial background for remapping sensory information to obtain stable externally defined\ncoordinates when one's spatial orientation (including that of the eyes) changes. When the\nvisual signal is missing, such spatial remapping may not occur. In agreement with this idea,\ncongenitally blind individuals are not subject to the ``crossed hand illusion'' (Ro\n\u00a8 der, Ro\n\u00a8 sler,\n& Spence, 2004), presumably because they do not have the perceptual conflict with an\nexternally anchored reference system for tactile stimuli. There is also experimental evidence\nthat congenitally blind individuals do not remap auditory stimuli onto externally defined\ncoordinates (Ro\n\u00a8 der, Kusmierek, Spence, & Schicke, 2007). It has been suggested that it is\nspecifically early-blind people whose spatial experience of the world depends largely on\negocentric reference frames rather than allocentric reference frames (Iachini, Ruggiero, &\nRutolo, 2014; Pasqualotto, Spiller, Jansari, & Proulx, 2013). Therefore, one might generally\nexpect the early-blind to rely more on egocentric reference frames for judging spatial\nrelations.\nIt has been shown that two bars on a tabletop that are felt to be parallel can actually have\ndramatically different angles from one another and that this difference scales almost linearly\nwith the angular distance between them (Kappers, 2003; Kappers & Koenderink, 1999). The\nresearchers concluded that participants' perception of haptic space relied on a combination of\nallocentric and egocentric reference frames, the latter of which was centered on the hand.\nWe expect that similar deviations will be found for drawing lines in a specified direction.\nUsing a similar parallel-bars paradigm, Postma, Zuidhoek, Noordzij, and Kappers (2008)\nshowed that when instructed to wait 10 s between exploring a reference bar and rotating a test\nbar, early-blind participants relied more on an egocentric reference frame than late-blind and\nblindfolded-sighted adults. Based on this increased reliance on an egocentric reference frame,\nwe expect early-blind adults who are instructed to draw straight frontoparallel lines starting\nat different distances from the body midline to draw lines with more strongly deviating angles\nthan sighted people. Similarly, when instructed to draw lines of a given length at different\ndistances from the body, early-blind adults' drawn lines may be longer at larger distances\nfrom the body due to relying more heavily on an egocentric reference frame, at least if such a\nreference frame is in polar coordinates (direction and distance).\nKuling, Brenner, and Smeets (2016) have shown that sighted adults are not always\naccurate at placing their hand on a table above the location of their other, unseen hand\nunder the table. Kuling, van der Graaff, Brenner, and Smeets (2014) showed that matching\nNelson et al. 3\na target using a handheld pointing tool does not result in differences in magnitude or\nvariability of error compared with using one's own fingertip in a visuoproprioceptive\nmatching task. Furthermore, while it has been shown that using proprioception alone in a\nmatching task is less effective than combining sight and proprioception (Van Beers, Sittig, &\nDenier van der Gon, 1999), it also remains to be tested whether early-blind adults'\nproprioceptive accuracy and precision in a position matching task are worse than that of\nblindfolded-sighted adults. We speculate that this matching error is already ameliorated by\nway of the visual system and that early-blind adults may show greater matching errors than\nblindfolded-sighted adults due to a lack of visual experience.\nMethods\nParticipants\n86 females) were attendees of the ``ZieZo Beurs,'' a convention for blind and visually\nimpaired people, who visited the Utrecht University booth that was set up for the event.\nAll participants were nai\u00a8ve to the purpose of the experiment, with the exception of one\nparticipant with normal vision who was also an author. Participants were given an\nexplanation of the task and were asked for their informed consent. Once verbal consent\nwas given, they were asked several general questions about their vision, age, and handedness.\nFor the analyses, the participants were grouped based on level of vision. The five groups\nwere referred to as early-blind, late-blind, low vision, high vision, and sighted. Early-blind\nparticipants were all born completely blind and have never experienced any level of vision.\nLate-blind participants all became completely blind either due to a congenital condition\nleading to gradual loss of vision or due to an accident. The age of total vision loss in the\nlate-blind group ranged from 2 to 47 years. Participants in the low vision group reported\nhaving some degree of visual perception, but no more than 10% in either eye. Participants in\nthe high vision group reported having more than 10%, but no more than 80% vision in either\neye. Participants in the sighted group reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nLevel of vision was determined by self-report. The low vision and high vision groups\nconsisted of participants who possessed congenital visual deficits as well as deficits\nacquired later in life by various means.\nDue to the nature of the convention, participants were not actively matched between\ngroups, and it was not possible to perform an in-depth intake session with each\nparticipant. We therefore lacked information regarding our participants' specific visual\ncapacities, as well as haptic processing abilities such as the ability to read braille, which\ncould potentially have an impact on their ability to perform the tasks described here.\nDetails of the participant groups can be found in Table 1.\nExperimental Setup and Procedure\nThe setup consisted of a 100 \u00c2 65 cm wooden board on which flip chart paper sheets could be\nmounted. The board rested on two supporting trestles, resulting in a table (Figure 1). Four\nmetal washers were placed under the board as haptic targets for the nondominant hand.\nThe washers had a diameter of 3 cm with a 1-cm gap in the middle such that participants\ncould comfortably guide their fingertip to the center of the washer. Two of these washers were\nplaced along the center of the board, at 15 and 35 cm away from the long edge (henceforth\nreferred to as the near and far targets, respectively). The remaining two washers were placed\n20 cm to the right and 26.6 cm to the left of the near target, respectively (henceforth referred\nto as the side targets). The different lateral distances of the two side targets were an error that\nwe compensated for in the analysis. The right-side target was used only by right-handed\nparticipants, and the left-side target was used only by left-handed participants.\nAn aluminum bar of 10 \u00c2 1 \u00c2 1 cm served as a reference object, which participants held\nbriefly at the beginning of the experiment.\nParticipants sat in a chair in front of the setup and were blindfolded. The participants sat\nsuch that their midsagittal body plane was aligned with the near and far haptic targets. The\ntask was explained, and participants were invited to explore the table with their hands to get a\nfeel for the positions of the haptic targets. Participants were asked to confirm that they could\nreach all three targets before continuing. The experimenter handed the reference object to the\nparticipants and instructed them to get a feel for the length of the object. Participants were\nallowed to hold it for several seconds in their dominant hand and manipulate it. They were\nnot allowed to set it down on the table, run their finger along the length of it, or touch it with\ntheir nondominant hand. Most participants held the object between their thumb and pinkie\nfinger to get a feel for the object's length; they were not restricted to holding it in in their\npalm. The experimenter explained that the participants' task would be to draw lines of this\nFigure 1. Top view of a participant at the experimental table. The haptic targets, placed under the table, are\nindicated by red rings, contacted by the index finger of the nondominant hand. The dominant hand was\nholding a pen above the table. Target size is misrepresented here for the sake of visibility.\nTable 1. Group-Level Characteristics of Participants.\nGroup n Age (M \u00c6 SD) Left-handed Female\nNelson et al. 5\nlength. The experimenter took the reference object back once the participants said they had\nan idea of the length (typically after 5 to 10 s) and confirmed that they understood the task.\nThe experimenter then placed an ink marker in the participants' dominant hand and\nguided the index finger of their nondominant hand toward one of the three haptic targets.\nParticipants were asked to use the marker to indicate on the paper where their nondominant\nhand was placed, and from this point draw a line with the same length as the reference object.\nThree targets were used: the near and far targets, as well as the side target that corresponded\nwith their dominant hand. Right-handed participants were asked to draw all lines from left to\nright, and left-handed participants were asked to draw all lines from right to left. All\nparticipants thus drew three such lines, one from each of the three targets in a randomized\norder, without any practice or familiarization. Because we did not know in advance how\nmany participants we would be able to recruit, we did not counterbalance the order of the\ntargets across participants. After a participant had finished the task, the sheet of paper was\nremoved, and a fresh sheet was placed on top of the setup for the next participant.\nAnalysis\nFor each participant and each target, we determined the position of the dot at the start of the\nline, the matching error (i.e., the two-dimensional vector between the haptic target and\nthe dot at the start of the line), the length of the drawn line (i.e., the shortest distance\nbetween the start and the end of the drawn line), and the angle of the drawn line relative\nto the coronal plane. For each of our analyses, we examined whether the early-blind\nperformed differently than the sighted group. We used one-tailed independent samples\nt tests to do so, as we expected early-blind participants to show greater matching errors,\nlength ratios between near and far target lines, and angular differences between near and side\ntarget lines than sighted participants. In cases where a significant difference was found, we\nalso performed one-tailed t tests to determine whether the early-blind group differed from the\nother groups.\nIn this article, four questions are investigated:\n1. Do early-blind participants show greater matching errors than sighted participants?\n2. Do early-blind participants show less matching error consistency than sighted\nparticipants?\n3. Do participants draw longer lines from far targets than from near targets, and is this\ndifference larger for early-blind than for sighted participants?\n4. Do participants draw differently oriented lines from the near and side targets, and is the\nangular difference larger for early-blind participants than for sighted participants?\nMatching errors. We first analyzed the magnitude of the matching errors of each participant\ngroup, ignoring the direction of the error. To determine whether participants' matching\nerrors (both magnitude and direction) were consistent across targets, we calculated a\nconsistency value as described in previous studies (Kuling et al., 2016; Kuling, van der\nGraaff, Brenner, & Smeets, 2017). The consistency value was determined for all three\ncombinations of the three target positions (i.e., MEnear\ncompared with MEfar\n, MEfar\ncompared with MEside\n, and MEside\ncompared with MEnear\n), after which an average value\nfor each participant was calculated. To determine a meaningful baseline, we also calculated a\nchance consistency error by comparing every individual matching error with every other\nmatching error; a value above this baseline indicates that participants are at least\nsomewhat consistent in their errors across targets (Kuling et al., 2016, 2017). We analyzed\nwhether early-blind participants had significantly larger matching error magnitudes and\nlower consistency values than sighted participants.\nLine analysis. For the comparison of the drawn lines, we looked at drawn line lengths starting\nfrom the near and far targets, as well as drawn line angles starting from the near and side\ntargets. For the lengths, we analyzed whether the ratio of the far target line length to the near\ntarget line length was larger than 1, and whether it was larger for the early-blind than for the\nsighted participants. For the angle, we examined whether the angular differences between\ndrawn lines at the near and side targets were greater for early-blind participants than for\nsighted participants. To correct for the difference in relative position of the left- and right-side\ntargets, we multiplied left-handed participants' values by 20 cm/26.6 cm, as it is known that\nthe angle at which a line is felt as frontoparallel scales linearly with distance from the body\nResults\nThe data of three participants (two low vision and one sighted) were completely excluded\nfrom the analysis because they drew lines from arbitrary starting points and reported that\nthey did not realize they needed to match the haptic targets or pay attention to the reference\nobject's length. Data from a further 10 participants (three late-blind, two low vision, three\nhigh vision, and two sighted) were excluded from analyses of the drawn lines, but not from\nthat of the matching task, due to the participants drawing one or more lines in the wrong\ndirection or, in two cases, starting their drawn lines from somewhere other than the (correctly\nlocated) haptic targets.\nThe raw data of an example representative participant (Figure 2) show matching errors\nthat are quite consistent over the three targets: The drawn lines all started about 3 cm from\nthe target position (farther away and a bit to the left). Furthermore, the lengths of this\nFigure 2. Example experiment sheet from a 20-year-old right-handed male in the sighted group with\nrepresentative performance. Black dots indicate the location of the haptic targets under the table, and the\nreference object is displayed above the near target for comparison. The target dots and reference object\nwere not present on the paper during the experiment. The grid squares have 2.5 cm sides.\nNelson et al. 7\nparticipant's drawn lines are about 6 cm, considerably shorter than that of the 10-cm\nreference object. The line drawn from the side target is rotated a few degrees clockwise\nrelative to the one drawn from the near target.\nThe individual matching errors for right-handed participants show quite some variability,\nbut there was no evident difference between groups (Figure 3(a)). We focus our analysis on\nthe magnitudes of the matching errors (Figure 3(b)). We found that early-blind participants\ndid not have greater mismatch magnitudes than sighted participants (one-tailed independent\nThe consistency of the early-blind participants' errors across target positions is close to\nchance level, whereas the other groups show more consistency (Figure 4). Early-blind\nparticipants showed a significantly lower consistency value than sighted participants (one-\ntailed independent samples t test), t(59) \u00bc 2.264; p \u00bc .013. The early-blind also showed a\nsignificantly lower consistency value than the other three groups--late-blind: t(14) \u00bc 1.189,\nMost participants drew lines that were considerably shorter than the 10 cm length of the\nfelt object (Figure 5(a)): on average only 6.59 cm (66% of the reference object's length). They\ndrew lines of similar lengths at the different distances: The average ratio of the far and near\nline lengths was 1.08 (Figure 5(b)). Early-blind participants' line length ratios were not\nsignificantly larger than those of sighted participants (one-tailed independent samples\nt test), t(57) \u00bc 1.50, p \u00bc .07. Furthermore, neither early-blind nor sighted participants' line\nlength ratios were significantly larger than 1.0 (one-tailed one sample t test)--early-blind:\ndraw lines of a certain angular length, rather than ones that match the reference object's\nactual length.\nLines from the side target were drawn in a systematically different direction than those\nfrom the near target (Figure 6).

Both early-blind and sighted participants drew lines that are much\nshorter than the felt bar and were drawn at angles that similarly depended on eccentricity.\nAs these effects were similar across groups, they can better be attributed to a general\nproperty of haptic perception than to an effect that depends on visual experience.\nThe sizes of our participant groups were relatively small, so we may have failed to\ndetect small but real effects. Our interest was in clear-cut effects of lack of visual\nexperience, for which we investigated differences between early-blind and sighted\nparticipants. The expected systematic effects of lack of visual experience were not evident\nin our sample.\nWe are not aware of a theory that makes specific predictions for how the performance in\nour task would depend on details of the impairment such as the age of onset of blindness.\nGiven the time constraints inherent to data collection at a convention, we did not collect data\non the precise history of our participants' visual impairments. Therefore, we cannot perform\nany exploratory analysis on this. Similarly, we did not intend to investigate biases caused by\nother factors than being blind, so we did not examine whether participant height, hand size,\nor arm length played a role in task performance.\nEarly\nblind\nLate\nblind\nLow\nvision\nHigh\nvision\nSighted\nAngular difference (deg)\nFigure 6. Difference in angle between near and side target lines for all participants. A positive value\nindicates a more clockwise orientation for a more rightward target position. Left-handed participant data\nhave been normalized to correspond to a 20-cm difference between the near and side targets.\nMatching Errors\nWe observed average matching errors of 3 cm, which is in line with previous reports\nRo\n\u00a8 sblad, 1988). What is particularly interesting about this is that participants who have\nnever experienced vision are just as accurate at matching their hand positions as\nblindfolded-sighted participants, indicating that vision does not play a role, even\nindirectly, in this task. The low consistency value in early-blind participants (Figure 4) is\nremarkable. While the actual size of the matching error is well in line with that of other\ngroups (Figure 3(b)), this error was not consistent across target positions in the early-blind\nparticipants, in contrast to the other groups. It is possible that growing up with visual input\nplays a role in developing this consistency, which early-blind people would therefore lack.\nHowever, given that the observed range of consistency values among early-blind participants\nfalls within that of nearly all other groups, and given that the early-blind group consisted of\nonly seven participants, it is not clear whether this difference is indicative of an actual\nmatching deficit in early-blind individuals, or is simply due to chance.\nLength Reproduction\nIt is worth pointing out that our participants fall well short of the desired length when\ndrawing lines, regardless of level of visual experience or starting position of the line\n(Figure 5(a)). This appears to be in contrast with the findings of Hermelin and O'Connor\n(1975), who observed that when congenitally blind and blindfolded-sighted children were\nasked to reproduce vertical movements traveled by their hand, they were accurately able\nto do this for path lengths of 10 to 30 cm. Their task relied on kinesthetic movement\ninformation rather than on static tactile information. Our task involves the transformation\nof static tactile information (a felt bar in one's hand) to dynamic proprioceptive information.\nIt is possible that this transformation is responsible for the systematic undershoot.\nThey noticed a difference in performance between blind and sighted participants\nwhen reproducing the longer movement distances (25\u00ad30 cm): The blind participants\nundershot these more than the sighted. As a hand cannot statically feel a length of 25 to\n30 cm, this difference for longer movement distances cannot be tested with our paradigm of a\nhandheld length.\nPrevious work has shown that the horizontal\u00advertical illusion exists in the haptic domain\nas well as the visual domain. Heller and Joyner (1993) demonstrated that early-blind adults\nshow evidence for a vertical compression of haptic space, but the size of the effect was small\ncompared with the undershoot that we observe in our data. As such, we do not expect that\nthe lengths of our participants' drawn lines would be substantially longer if we altered the\norientation in which they were instructed to hold the reference object.\nDuring the review process, it was suggested that hand size may have influenced\nparticipants' perception (a smaller hand might lead to the percept of a longer bar) and\nthus on the length of the drawn lines. We did not measure hand size during the\nexperiment, but analyzed our data in light of gender (on average women have smaller\nhands). Indeed, it appears that women drew somewhat longer lines than men: The median\nline length (calculated over all groups) was 6.4 cm for women and 5.8 cm for men.\nLederman, Klatzky, and Barber (1985) tested participants' ability to reproduce a distance\nbetween two points by moving their index finger after traveling along an indirect path\nbetween the two points with that finger. They observed that early-blind participants\ntended to make larger reproductions of the distance than late-blind participants. They also\nobserved an overshoot in reproduced length for all participants for lengths up to 25 cm and\nan undershoot for greater distances. Because Lederman et al.'s participants traced a path\nwith their finger while attending to the distance between the starting and ending positions,\nwhereas our participants acquired length information without any tracing motion, our\nparticipants' systematic undershoot of the target distance cannot be related to this overshoot.\nMoscatelli, Naceri, and Ernst (2014) tested whether participants could accurately\nreproduce lengths of a triangle path felt by a tactile stimulation device. Their participants\ncould much more accurately reproduce the perceived displacement than our participants\nreproduced perceived length: Their reported 98% accuracy is far higher than our 66%\naccuracy. A reason for this difference could be that the two experiments differed in how\nparticipants perceived the distances they had to reproduce. Their participants rested their\nindex finger on a spherical device that rotated while the finger remained stationary on top of\nit, providing the tactile experience of moving a finger over a surface. Our participants were\nallowed to manipulate a three-dimensional reference object in their dominant hand, but they\nwere not permitted to run a finger along the length of the object.\nThe findings of Moscatelli et al. (2014), Lederman et al. (1985), and Hermelin and\nO'Connor (1975) all show that people are able to reproduce a given length reasonably\naccurately. In all these experiments, the participants could judge the length based on\nhaptic motion information. As our participants made systematic errors and lacked this\ninformation, it may be necessary to have haptic motion information to accurately\nreproduce lengths in a drawing task. Irrespective of the reason for the distances being\nunderestimated in our study, the fact that we observed no differences between early-blind\nand sighted participants in the ratio of lengths of lines drawn from the near and far targets\n(Figure 5(b)) suggests that for this task, the early-blind do not rely more on an egocentric\ncoordinate system than the sighted.\nParallel Reproduction\nKappers (2004) demonstrated that haptic space perception relies on a combination of\negocentric and allocentric reference frames, explaining the tendency of the angle of the test\nbar to lie somewhere between what would be considered parallel in purely allocentric or\npurely egocentric reference frames. Her experiments to map out haptic space were\nfar more extensive than ours, but the differences that we see in drawn line orientation\n(Figure 6) are of similar magnitude to what she observes. Van Mier (2013) tested sighted\nadults' ability to draw a line parallel to a felt but unseen bar. Despite the fact that her\nparticipants were allowed to see the line they were drawing, there was still an angular\ndifference between the orientation of the reference bar and that of the drawn line.\nAlthough this difference is smaller than what she observed in her purely haptic parallelity\ntask, it still suggests that the reference frame experienced by each hand is important. This\nsimilarity is particularly interesting because we never explicitly told our participants to draw\nparallel lines; we simply always instructed them to draw the lines ``from left to right'' (or from\nright to left, if the participant was left-handed).\nWe observed no differences between early-blind and sighted participants in angular\ndifferences between the drawn lines from the near and side targets. This confirms that for\nthis task, the early-blind do not rely more on an egocentric coordinate system than the\nsighted. The small but significant difference in angle between the drawn lines from the\nnear and side targets can therefore be said not to rely on visual experience. Previous work\nhas shown that women make substantially larger errors than men when matching the\norientations of two haptically felt bars (Kappers, 2003). We did not observe a similar\neffect in the orientation of the drawn lines. Our female participants even showed a slightly\nsmaller median angular difference than our male participants (5.0 and 5.5, respectively).\nPostma et al. (2008) observed differences between early-blind, late-blind, and sighted\nparticipants in a delayed bar parallelity task. When asked to wait 10 s between feeling a\nreference bar and setting a test bar parallel to it, blindfolded-sighted participants\nperformed better than late-blind participants, who in turn performed better than early-\nblind participants. The fact that we do not observe a similar effect, despite a delay\nbetween feeling the reference object and drawing the lines, likely stems from the fact that\nwe do not explicitly ask our participants to consider the egocentric relation of the object to\nthe participant. Instead, we only asked them to consider the length of the object, regardless of\norientation, so the angle of the participants' drawn lines should have no relation to the angle\nat which they felt the object.\nConclusion\nWe expected that early-blind participants would rely more on information processed within\nan egocentric reference frame but found no indication of this in our results.\nAll data pertaining to this study, both analog and digital, are freely available for review.\nInterested parties are invited to contact the first author for specific questions or access to the\ndata and materials.\n"
