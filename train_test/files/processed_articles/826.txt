This article examines the association between race and the timing of formal long-term care (LTC) service\nuse, both institutional and community based. It seeks to understand whether early parenthood predicts the timing of LTC\nuse later in life and whether it in turn mediates the association between race and LTC use. In particular, it explores whether\nthe lower rate of formal LTC use among African Americans is due in some part to the earlier inception of parenthood.\nmodel age at first use of institutional (skilled nursing facility) care and home health as competing risks using a Cox\nproportional hazards model.\nResults. Early parenthood accelerates first use of home health for Whites but delays first use for Blacks. The likelihood\nof any LTC use by race group converges as timing of parenthood increases.\nDiscussion. Differential effects of teen childbearing across race groups indicate differential vulnerability to LTC needs\namong early parents.\nPERSISTENT racial differences in formal long-term care\nservice utilization have been observed nationally, in area\nstudies, and across several decades. In general, the literature\nindicates that African American older persons, who experience\nhigher rates of disability at each age, use formal long-term care\nat a significantly lower rate than their White counterparts\nA number of explanations have been offered, including\ndifferences in economic status and opportunity (Headen,\n1992), in area-level segregation and the limited ability to obtain\nformal long-term care services (Smith, 1993), and, most\ncommonly, in caregiving norms and expectations (Chatters,\nStorms, Kington, & Andersen, 1998). Of these, the role of\nextended family and fictive kin is considered particularly salient,\nthat is, the composition of the caregiving network and the\nlikelihood that older African Americans may draw upon support\nbeyond the nuclear family as an alternative to the use of formal\nThe family is, indeed, key to a long-term care profile. Those\nwithout a spouse or children, for instance, experience a much\nhigher risk of institutionalization (Morrow-Howell & Proctor,\n1994). Research indicates that the availability and character-\nistics of family members have important implications not only\nfor the use of any long-term care over a lifetime (Himes, 1992)\nbut for the timing and type of care ultimately used (Cagney &\n(1999) found that, net of sociodemographic characteristics, both\nchildren and grandchildren play a role in deferring the age at\nwhich older African Americans use formal long-term care\nrelative to Whites. Apart from consequences for late-life service\nuse, these family characteristics also reflect distinctive trajecto-\nries of life-course events and opportunities experienced by each\ngroup over their lifetimes. The information contained in these\nlife biographies typically is not the focus of long-term care\nresearch. Children and grandchildren, for instance, are important\nindicators of family resources, but counts of offspring alone\nrender analyses incomplete. To date, information about the\ntiming of parenthood--and the family-level implications of the\ntransition to parenthood--has not been examined.\nParenthood launches women and men into a new and\nformative facet of their lives. It is the timing of this transition,\nhowever, in combination with other factors--health, wealth,\nsocial support--that may shape the trajectory these lives take.\nThe timing of parenthood has been linked to a diverse set of\nsocial phenomena including educational attainment, employ-\nment opportunities, and health (De Wit & Rajulton, 1992;\nHardy, Astone, Brooks-Gunn, Shapiro, & Miller, 1998; Hotz,\nsocial science research on the impact of parenthood timing has\nfocused on the deleterious short-term effects of early parent-\nhood, where fewer years of schooling, lower wages, and marital\ndisruption characterize the life experience of those who bear\nnumber of studies have examined later-life outcomes (Heck,\nSchoendorf, Ventura, & Kiely, 1997), such as breast cancer\n(Kampert, Whittemore, & Paffenbarger, 1988) and women's\nlabor force participation at older ages (Pienta, 1999). The timing\nof long-term care use is yet another distal event that has not been\nexplored. There are several reasons to expect that the timing of\nparenthood and the timing of long-term care use might be\nrelated. First, those who have their first child early in life have\nthe opportunity to form larger families, which means that more\nchildren may be available to provide informal care. Second, the\ntiming of parenthood determines the age, and often life stage, of\nthe child when the parent needs long-term care. Children born\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nto older mothers may be more likely to be responsible for the\ncare of their own young children when their parents need\nassistance. Demographers have shown that the overall preva-\nlence of this ``sandwiched'' generation is low. About three\nfourths of the middle-aged population have living parents and\nchildren, but obligations to each of these generations tend not to\ncoincide: When children are young, grandparents provide child\ncare and money; when grandparents are in declining health,\nchildren are likely to be out of the home and financially\nindependent (e.g., Soldo,1996). However, this depends on both\nthe timing of the onset of disabling conditions among the elderly\nand the timing of childbearing (Uhlenberg, 1995). Recent\nresearch in the United Kingdom has shown that highly educated\nwomen who delay childbearing are more likely to have children\nat home and care for aged parents than others, implying a\npotential increase in this role combination in the future (Agree,\nBissett, & Rendall, 2003). Yet another possibility is that the\ntiming of parenthood acts as a marker for the nature of\nintergenerational relationships within the family (Jackson,\nJayakody, & Antonucci, 1996). Early parenthood, for instance,\nmay be associated with a constellation of family factors (e.g.,\nshared households, proximal grandparents) that consequently\nindicate a greater willingness of children to be caregivers.\nTransmission of a normative orientation toward familial activi-\nties and obligations may later mean that informal caregiving acts\nas a substitute for formal care or that it staves off use of formal\nservices until later ages.\nWe sought to understand whether the timing of parenthood\npredicts the timing of long-term care use--institutional or\ncommunity based--and whether it in turn mediates the\nassociation between race and long-term care. African Ameri-\ncans have a lower average age of first parenthood than Whites\nand higher levels of teen childbearing (Furstenberg, 1987;\nRuggles, 1994); this earlier timing of parenthood may account\nin part for the racial difference observed in formal long-\nterm care use. We use the National Long-Term Care Survey\n(NLTCS) to explore these questions, a nationally representative\nsurvey of disabled people aged 65 years or older, and linked\nMedicare claims files. To follow an older cohort with shared\nfertility timing prospectively, with access to appropriate claims\ndata, we found it necessary to use the 1989 wave of the NLTCS\nage at which the respondent first enters a skilled nursing facility\n(SNF) or begins to use Medicare home health services (i.e., the\nfirst long-term care episode). First use of SNF care or home\nhealth acts as an indicator--or point of initiation--into long-\nterm care; we include them under the broad rubric of health,\npersonal care, and social services that define long-term care\nConceptual Model\nThe life-course perspective provides a framework for\nexamining the use of long-term care as an age-related transition.\nLife-course analysis recognizes that formative events are ex-\nperienced over the entire lifespan. Individuals may face the same\ndecision at the same age, such as a choice among long-term care\noptions, but they will have arrived there through a unique set of\nO'Rand, 1996). The timing and sequencing of life experiences\nare fundamental to the model; the use of early-life information\nsuch as the timing of parenthood informs later-life outcomes\nAs outlined above, early parenthood may affect family size,\nthe presence of competing obligations, and the nature of\nintergenerational relationships. Thus, early parenthood affects\nboth the structure and the characteristics of the pool of potential\ninformal caregivers; these in turn influence the timing and type\nof long-term care used. Within this framework (Figure 1), we\ntest whether the effect of early parenthood matters because it is\nindicative of family size or because it determines the age and\nlife stage of the child. Our model recognizes the quality of\nintergenerational relationships as another potential mechanism,\nbut our data preclude the possibility of investigating this\npathway. Our framework also considers the unique role of\nsocial class, and additional features of family structure, in the\ntiming of long-term care use.\nIn this model, we treat SNF care or home health as the\nbeginning of a trajectory of long-term care service use. Both\nprograms were initially designed to deliver care post hospitaliza-\ntion (Diwan et al., 1997). SNF care is the only type of nursing\nhome care covered by Medicare, with the stipulation that the care\nfollows, and is related to, a 3-day hospitalization (Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services, 2002). Alternatively, the\nMedicare home health benefit may be utilized if the beneficiary\nis homebound, under a physician's care, and in need of skilled\nnursing care and/or physical therapy on a part-time or intermittent\nbasis (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1996). Medicare re-\ncipients who use these post\u00adacute care benefits are initiated into\nthe world of long-term care delivery; this initial interaction may\nbe of short duration and of a different nature (e.g., rehabilitation),\nbut it marks the beginning of a relationship with long-term care.\nIndeed, SNF or home health use often precipitates permanent\nnursing home placement or extended use of long-term care\nservices within the community. We view this preliminary service\nuse as an important life event and one that heavily influences the\ntype of trajectory a long-term care user is likely to take.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nThe 1989 NLTCS, our main data source, is a nationally rep-\nresentative longitudinal survey designed to study changes in the\nhealth and functional status of disabled older Americans aged 65\nyears and older. It also has detailed information on children who\ndo not live within the household, making it possible to examine\nthe influence of family structure apart from living arrangements.\nThe initial sampling frame was the population 65 years of age\nand older drawn from Medicare enrollment files in 1982. Further\ndetails on the sampling frame and survey design can be found in\nthe work by Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993).\nThe NLTCS data were linked to Medicare claims information\nfor each respondent; both SNF and home health data were ab-\nstracted. The files were prepared by the Center for Demographic\nStudies at Duke University (Durham, NC) with data from the\nHealth Care Financing Administration. As the NLTCS sample is\ndrawn from Medicare beneficiary enrollment files, nearly 100%\nof NLTCS respondents can be tracked longitudinally with both\nMedicare Part A and Part B claims files.\nThe final analytic sample is restricted to those who identify as\nBlack or White, those with no use of either SNF or Medicare\nhome health services prior to interview, and those with children\ncommunity interviews). Although the proportion of Blacks\nand Whites initially excluded for prior use of home health is\nnearly equal (26.6% of Black respondents vs 25.2% of Whites),\na greater proportion of Whites than Blacks were excluded owing\nto prior SNF use (1.6% of Black respondents vs 4.3% of\nWhites). Although these numbers are small, they may indicate\nthat Whites at greater levels of disability have already left the\ncommunity or, if they remain, have already experienced long-\nterm care use (and thus are ineligible for an examination of first\nuse). If this is the case, then we are comparing healthier Whites\nwith Blacks at greater levels of disability. This implies that our\nrelative hazard estimates are conservative.\nVariables\nDependent variable. --Age at first use is consistent with the\nanalysis of long-term care as a life-course transition.

The latter two are coded as\ndichotomous. Total household income for the previous 12\nand above.

Three income levels relative to\nsuggested by Liberatos, Link, and Kelsey (1988). These were\nbased on published federal poverty guidelines for 1989 (Social\nSecurity Administration, 1993). Family structure--meaning\nthose related by blood, marriage, or adoption--consists of\nspouses, sons, daughters, and others who are related to the\nrespondent. Family characteristics include number of living\nyears,  25 years), number of daughters, number of sons, and\nwhether any grandchildren live in the respondent's or the\nchild's household. Living arrangements also reflect the\nstructural availability of kin for caregiving; because they are\nassessed at baseline, they temporally precede the outcomes of\ninterest. Living arrangement is coded as living alone, living\nwith a spouse, or living with others. The categories were chosen\nso as not to be redundant with the family structure variables. A\ncategorical variable indicating the proportion of children\nworking full-time is also included to address potential\ncompeting obligations among children.\nControl variables. --Two dimensions of health--functional\nstatus and cognitive status--are included in these analyses.\nFunctional status was determined from questions concerning\nability to function independently (without help) in activities of\ndaily living (bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, toileting,\ngetting around inside) and instrumental activities of daily living\n(heavy and light housework, shopping, meal preparation, tak-\ning medications, managing money, using the telephone). The\nassessment of cognitive status in the NLTCS was based upon\nthe Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire score. The\nvariable used in this analysis is dichotomous, with a score of \n3 errors out of a possible 10 indicating impairment (Pfeiffer,\n1975). Gender is also included as a control variable.\nFigure 1. Conceptual model. SES \u00bc socioeconomic status.\nStatistical Methods\nWe use Cox proportional hazards modeling and its extensions\n(Cox, 1972) to model SNF care and home health use as\ncompeting risks. This ``time-to-event'' framework allows us to\nexamine the age and stage of life transitions and to identify the\nprecise point of long-term care entry. Analyses were conducted\nwith unweighted data. Robust standard errors were used with the\nCox proportional hazards models to account in part for the\ncomplex sampling design of the NLTCS.\nBoth the product-limit survival estimator and the Cox\nproportional hazards models focus on age at the event. Although\nthe primary reason for choosing age, rather than time in study, as\nthe time scale is because age is best suited to test the hypotheses\nderived from the theoretical model, there are analytic reasons for\nchoosing age as the outcome measure. First, if time from\ninterview date is used rather than chronological age, there is an\nimplicit assumption that the period of risk begins at the date of the\nsurvey, rather than at some specified age or specific health event\n(e.g., stroke, disability). Because the failure to properly identify\nthe risk period may bias hazard model estimates in an un-\npredictable direction (Cnaan & Ryan, 1989), chronological age\nmay provide a better outcome variable than time from survey\ndate. Age as a measure offers a discrete, nonrecurring event for\nassessing the point of transition (Freedman, 1996). Second, using\nage as the outcome variable allows more flexibility in identifying\nthe age-specific risks of long-term care use because it does not\nrequire age to be entered as either a continuous variable or a series\nof dummy variables. Third, age as opposed to time on study is\npreferred because it is recommended, for proportional hazards\nmodels, to choose as the outcome the variable that has the largest\neffect on the hazard (Korn, Graubard, & Midthune, 1997). It is\nexpected that the baseline risks for both SNF care and home\nhealth use would change more as a function of age than as\na function of time over the survey interval.\nAs eligibility for the NLTCS is based on both age and the\npresence of disability, persons who were in the community and\nage eligible were not included in the survey if they were not\ndisabled. Thus, respondents who were older than 65 years at the\ntime of the community interview are left truncated. The\nproportional hazards models are modified to account for left-\nThe analysis focused on predicting the age at first SNF or\nhome health use as a function of three vectors of explanatory\nvariables--race, social class, and family structure--and one\nvector of control variables.\nThe general model can be written in the following form:\nlog h\u00f0t; X; \u00df\u00de \u00bc \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe \u00df1\nFAMILY\nwhere (t) is a function of time [(t) \u00bc log h0\n(t)] and \u00df is the\ncoefficient.\nThe above model can be generalized to the competing risks\ncase. Usually called an analysis of the type-specific or cause-\nspecific hazard, a competing risks situation is characterized as\none where the occurrence of one type of event removes the\nindividual from risk of all other event types (Allison, 1995). For\nexample, a single model for the event of interest, such as death\nfrom heart disease, can be estimated, treating all other death\ntypes as censoring events. In this case, a single model for\nSNF care can be estimated, treating first home health use as\na censoring event. The modeling process is the same as that\ndiscussed above; however, the definition of the censoring event\nand the consequent interpretation of the model change.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics, stratified by race, of\nthe NLTCS population with no prior long-term care use and at\nleast one child (N \u00bc 2,603). Column percentages and p values\nof the chi-square statistic are presented for each variable. No\nsignificant differences exist for age and gender, but functional\nstatus and cognitive status do differ by race. Approximately\n48% of the Black respondents show some cognitive impairment\nas compared with 23% of Whites. Service use over the entire\ninterval is higher among Whites, but only marginally significant\nfor home health. All family structure variables differ signifi-\ncantly by race, with the exception of number of sons. Timing of\nparenthood indicates a trend toward an earlier inception of\nfamily for the Blacks in this sample. All four measures tapping\neducation and financial resources differ significantly by race:\nBlack respondents have fewer years of education, are much\nmore likely to have incomes below the federal poverty level\n(nearly 50% of this sample as compared with just under 19%\nfor Whites), and disproportionately are Medicaid recipients.\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate the probability of first use of either\nhome health or SNF care by age, race, and whether or not the\nrespondent is an early parent (defined as younger than 18 years).\nFor home health, these descriptive results indicate that, with the\nexception of some crossover between 70 and 74 years, Whites\nregardless of parenthood status are more likely at eachage to avail\nthemselves of home health services. Interestingly, Blacks who\nare early parents are less likely than others to use home health as\nthey age, whereas the converse is true for their White counter-\nparts. For SNF care, it is difficult to distinguish patterns, but, in\ngeneral, Whites are more likely to utilize the SNF benefit. At later\nages, Blacks who are early parents may be higher users (but\nsmaller sample sizes at these ages preclude discerning an effect).\nCoefficients from multivariate analyses of SNF and home\nhealth care are shown in Table 2. Because age at first use of\nSNF care or home health is the outcome of interest, the risk or\nhazard of use is interpreted as a function of age. For example, if\nthe respondent has a lower risk of SNF use, this indicates that\nage at first use will be later in life. Conversely, if the respondent\nhas a higher risk of SNF use, then the respondent will first use\nSNF care at an earlier age. In a general sense, the outcome can\nbe viewed as the risk of use at each age.\nThe first set of models shows the risk of first SNF use,\ntreating use of home health as a censoring event. The second set\nshows the risk of first home health use, treating use of SNF care\nas a censoring event. This approach enables us to interpret the\ncovariates as factors that increase or decrease the risk of use, net\nof any influence that prior contact with another type of long-\nterm care delivery system would yield.\nFour models are presented for each outcome. The first model\nincludes the race variable only. The second introduces family\nstructure, social class, and control variables, apart from the\ntiming of parenthood variable. The third model then adds the\ntiming of parenthood variable (collapsed into three categories to\nenhance estimate precision and parsimony). The fourth and\nfinal model introduces interaction terms for race and the timing\nof parenthood.\nFor the risk of first SNF use, Blacks are at nearly half the risk\nof Whites. This narrows by just over 3% when family structure,\nsocial class, gender, and health variables are entered into the\nmodel. The introduction of the timing of parenthood variable,\nfound in Model 3, does nothing to close the gap between\nBlacks and Whites--neither categorical variable is significant\nin this model. The race and timing of parenthood interaction\nterm, introduced in Model 4, has no explanatory power in this\nmodel. Across models, each additional daughter and, in\nparticular, each additional son appear to stave off SNF entry\nuntil a later age. Of interest are the results for the presence of\ngrandchildren and the proportion of children working full-time.\nRespondents with grandchildren are at a risk more than one and\none half times greater of entering SNF care than those without\ngrandchildren. In general, as the proportion of children working\nfull-time increases, the risk of entering SNF care increases\n(with the exception of those who have between 0.76 and 1.0\nchildren working full-time, where the risk decreases slightly).\nFor home health, Blacks are at a risk 26% lower than Whites\nof entering home health care at every age. The gap between\nBlacks and Whites narrows slightly (3%) when family structure,\nsocial class, gender, and health variables are entered into the\nmodel. Unlike the SNF analysis, the timing of parenthood\nvariable is important to the timing of home health use. Although\nnot markedly changing the race coefficient, those who are early\nparents are at a risk of home health use twice as great as those\nFigure 2.

Those who\nbecame parents for the first time between ages 18 and 24 are\nat a risk nearly 1.3 times greater. The introduction of the\ninteraction term between race and timing of parenthood reveals\nthat timing of parenthood operates differently across race\ngroups. For instance, Whites who are early parents are at a risk\nof home health use 2.2 times greater than those who first had\nchildren later in life (25 years or older). For Blacks, however,\nearly parenthood lessens the risk of home health use; those who\nhad their first child before age 18 are at a risk 39% lower at each\nage. Across models, the presence of grandchildren and the\ngreater proportion of children working full-time are predictive\nof the use of home health at an earlier age, similar to the findings\nfor the SNF analysis.\nFigure 4 offers an alternative perspective on the relationships\namong race, the timing of parenthood, and the use of formal\nlong-term care services.

These predicted probabilities\nillustrate graphically that the pattern for Blacks and Whites\nappears to converge as the timing of parenthood is delayed. For\nBlacks, the probability of formal service use increases with\neach shift to a later age of first parenthood; the probability for\nWhites, on the other hand, decreases, although this is more\nevident in the case of home health. For those who have a later\ntiming of parenthood ( 25 years), there is no residual racial\ndifference in the likelihood of entering home health or SNF\ncare, net of the demographic, social, and economic factors\nincluded in the model.\nDISCUSSION\nWe use a life-course framework to examine the timing of\nparenthood and its influence on the timing of long-term care use.\nWe then explore whether racial differences in the timing of\nparenthood contribute to racial differences in long-term care\nutilization. We find that the timing of parenthood is important to\nthe timing of home health use, but not SNF care. We also find\nthat the race differential in service use is not fully explained by\nthe timing of parenthood. Our results suggest that the use of\nformal in-home care is subject to the influences of care patterns\nwithin the family, whereas the use of institutional care is driven\nprimarily by health factors. Although the timing of parenthood\ndid not fully explain utilization differences between Blacks and\nWhites, it did reveal important distinctions. For instance, the\ntiming of parenthood had opposite effects for Blacks and Whites\nin the risk of home health use, and results suggest a similar\npattern in the SNF case. Previous research has shown that family\nresources operate differently across race groups in response to\nthe need for long-term care. For example, Cagney and Agree\n(1999) found that each additional daughter increased the risk of\nhome health use for Whites but decreased the risk for Blacks; the\nsame was true for the presence of grandchildren. We may be\nobserving families--and family systems of care--that diverge\nin their approach to long-term care assistance. White families\nmay use home health as a complement, where caregivers solicit\noutside aid as an adjunct to their own service. Black families, in\ncontrast, may provide informal care in order to defer formal\nassistance, drawing on a dense and extended family network to\nsupplement care by adult children.\nThe life-course framework suggests a number of potential\nmechanisms. We do find that family size is significant for SNF\ncare, but not home health services, and that competing\nobligations (grandchildren, proportion of children working\nfull-time) increase the risk of both types of formal care. Because\nthe timing of parenthood result is significant for home health,\nnet of these indicators, our results lend support to the possibility\nthat differences in the nature of intergenerational relationships\nalso are reflected in the timing of parenthood.\nThe convergence of timing effects across race groups (shown\nin Figure 4) suggests that the importance of fertility timing is not\nincremental. Those who begin childbearing before the age of 18\nyears, at least in the older cohorts studied here, are a unique\ngroup. The meaning of early teen childbearing was quite\ndifferent for Blacks and Whites in this country in the 1930s and\n1940s, when these cohorts were having children. Some research\nsuggests that early parenthood has historically been more\nnormative among Black families than White (Ruggles, 1994),\nand teen birth rates for Blacks have been higher than those for\nlower levels of acceptance of early childbearing among White\nfamilies and potentially weaker ties across generations for teen\nparents. In addition, the higher probabilities of premarital\nconceptions and birth among Black women aged 15\u00ad29 years\nchildren born to teen parents may have been raised in extended\nfamilies with grandparents around. Documented differences in\nthe grandparent role across races, in either childcare or custodial\nparenting, indicate a supportive extended-family context for\nBlacks (and one that likely encourages caregiving behavior\nby grandchildren as well; Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1985; Taylor,\nSpeculating about the impact that parenthood timing has on\nthe nature of intergenerational relationships and by precept,\nfamily caregiving and later-life long-term care service use helps\nus to identify linkages between early- and late-life events. We\ndo not, however, have the opportunity to examine the nature of\nintergenerational relationships directly. Our aim in this work\nwas to examine structural features of African American and\nWhite families that would potentially explain racial differences\nin long-term care use. We found some intriguing effects that\ncannot readily be explained, indicating that unmeasured facets\nof intergenerational relationships in African American and\nWhite families may be an important mechanism by which\ncommunity-based long-term care services are combined with\nfamily caregiving. The rich literature on African American\nfamily life points to a number of potential pathways that might\ninfluence the context of intergenerational relationships (Dil-\nworth-Anderson, Williams, & Gibson, 2002; Jackson, Chatters,\nextended-family households (twice as common as compared\nwith Whites; Farley & Allen, 1987) and the greater likelihood\nof social exchange in an extended-family network (Taylor et al.,\n1990) suggest linkages that likely contribute to the propensity\nto provide care.\nImportant to our results are several caveats. We were unable\nto test all potential interactions or to run separate models by race\nowing to the small size of the African American sample. Future\nanalyses need to clarify the extent to which racial differences in\nthe effects of each set of factors contribute to racial differences\nFigure 4. Predicted probability of SNF care and home health use by\nrace and timing of parenthood. SNF \u00bc skilled nursing facility.\nin service use. Further, we assume that the measures used in\nour analyses operate effectively across race groups. Cognitive\nperformance measures, for instance, may not accurately capture\ncognitive status in all groups, as Differential Item Functioning\nanalysis indicates (Jones, 2003). Alternatively, there may be\nimportant confounders typically not included in social science\nanalyses (e.g., quality of education) that reduce differences\nobserved (Manly, Jacobs, Touradji, Small, & Stern, 2002). In\naddition, the risks and consequences of early childbearing (e.g.,\nlower educational attainment) may be experienced differentially\nacross race groups; the opportunity to, for instance, complete\nhigh school or receive other training post parenthood may\nhave been more common for Whites in this sample (and may\nindicate more subtle changes within the family than we are able\nto identify). Additionally, because of data limitations, we were\nunable to explore other characteristics of children (e.g.,\nproximity, marital status, spouse's employment) or of other\nrelatives (e.g., siblings) that likely play a role in understanding\nracial differences in the long-term care decision-making\nprocess. Importantly, the inclusion of early life-course indica-\ntors, also not possible with these data, could provide additional\ninformation about the meaning of parenthood timing. We know\nlittle about the extent to which early-life conditions, or changes\nin life circumstances across the life course, affect health and\nwell-being in later life (Hayward & Gorman, 2004).\nDivergence between these groups also may be due to variation\nin access to health services, which is unmeasured here. A history\nof reduced access to health and other social services for African\nAmerican respondents likely has cumulative effects on later-life\nhealth. This raises the larger issue of social context. We are not\nable to assess information about the community in which these\nrespondents are embedded. Churches, neighborhood social\nnetworks, and other resources within the community can deliver\ncare directly or may contribute to an environment in which some\nforms of care are more available or better integrated than others\nof these resources may be correlated with race in ways that we\ncannot readily appreciate. Change in the community is important\nto service availability and use as well, even if family members\nremain. Gentrification in an urban context and the development\nof agricultural lands into housing stock in a rural one mean that\nthe context of care may change regardless of change within the\nfamily.\nWhy does the timing of parenthood mark Blacks and Whites\nso differently? Is it a product of social circumstances at younger\nages, or is it a factor that determines social mobility over the\nlifespan, implying different life-course trajectories? Information\nabout social mobility--for the parents and for their children--\nmay provide the linkage necessary to understand how and to\nwhat extent early-life events such as the timing of parenthood\naffect later-life changes, opportunities, and, ultimately, health\nand later-life service use. Other research investigating the life\ncourse and the evolution of family formation and family norms\nsuggests that the interplay between family and social opportu-\nfor instance, for one generation and education for the next could\nintroduce important dynamic changes into the role of the family\nand its relationship to formal long-term care use.\nAs future cohorts age, the importance of early parenthood is\nlikely to persist. Rates of teen childbearing rose over the course\nof the twentieth century; although the 1990s have seen\na persistent decline in teenage childbearing, first birth rates to\n(National Center for Health Statistics, 1999). The aim of our\nresearch was to examine this sentinel event and explore the extent\nto which it might influence another important life transition.\nEmbedding these events in a life-course framework provided\na novel means to examine racial differences in long-term care and\na more general approach to understanding the highly differen-\ntiated lives of older adults. The mechanisms by which the timing\nof parenthood leads to later-life service use--particularly the\nprocesses by which the family responds to need and the dynamic\nnature of the family itself--merit further explication.\n"
