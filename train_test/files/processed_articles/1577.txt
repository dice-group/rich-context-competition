Periodic surveys of measured weight\nHeight and weight data are needed to calculate BMI (weight\nin kilograms divided by height in meters squared) to assess\nweight status according to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention growth charts (4). Measured height and weight\nare the gold standard for surveillance, but measurements are\nexpensive to obtain and rarely available for local populations\nor annually. Parent-reported data is an attractive alternative.\nHowever, among adults and adolescents, self-reported height\nand weight underestimate BMI and obesity rates compared to\nmeasured data (5\u00ad15). The validity of overweight prevalence\nestimates based on parent-reported data for younger children\nis less clear because findings vary (16\u00ad18). Nevertheless, the\nimperative to assess overweight prevalence among younger\nchildren has increased with research demonstrating that being\noverweight early in life increases the likelihood of being an\noverweight adolescent (19).\nTo assess the quality of parent-reported data for childhood\noverweight surveillance, we compared data from two national\nsurveys that collect parent-reported height and weight data\nfor children to a third survey that collects measured data\n\nduring physical examinations. All three surveys are routinely\nused in national health and disease surveillance and provide\nan opportunity to compare the performance of reported vs.\n\nmeasured data collected in standardized protocols among\n\nnationally representative samples selected using similar sam-\npling methodology.\nMethods and Procedures\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous national\nsurvey of a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutional\nChildhood Overweight Prevalence in the\nUnited States: The Impact of Parent-reported\nHeight and Weight\nLara J. Akinbami1,2 and Cynthia L. Ogden3\nParent-reported height and weight are often used to estimate BMI and overweight status among children. The quality\nof parent-reported data has not been compared to measured data on a national scale for all race/ethnic groups\nin the United States. Parent-reported height and weight for 2\u00ad17-year-old children in two national health interview\nHealth (NSCH)--were compared to measured values from a national examination survey--the 1999\u00ad2004 National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Compared to measured data, parent-reported data overestimated\nchildhood overweight in both interview surveys. For example, overweight prevalence among 2\u00ad17-year-olds was\n25% (s.e. 0.2) using parent-reported NHIS data vs. 16% (s.e. 0.6) using measured NHANES data. Parent-reported\ndata overestimated overweight among younger children, but underestimated overweight among older children.\nThe discrepancy between reported and measured estimates arose mainly from reported height among very young\nchildren. For children aged 2\u00ad11 years, the mean reported height from NHIS was 3\u00ad6cm less than mean measured\nheight from NHANES (P < 0.001) vs. no difference among children aged 16\u00ad17 years. Measured data remains the\ngold standard for surveillance of childhood overweight. Although this analysis compared mean values from survey\npopulations rather than parent-reported and measured data for individuals, the results from nationally representative\ndata reinforce previous recommendations based on small samples that parent-reported data should not be used to\nestimate overweight prevalence among preschool and elementary school\u00adaged children.\n1Infant, Child and Women's Health Statistics Branch, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA;\n2US Public Health Service, Rockville, Maryland, USA; 3Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.

A random-digit-dial sample of\nhouseholds with children <18 years of age was selected from each State\nand the District of Columbia. A knowledgeable adult (usually a parent)\nresponded for a randomly selected child in each household and, similar\nto NHIS procedures, no prompt was given to measure the child or con-\nsult records before reporting weight or height.

The NHIS height and weight data were not edited\nbefore release of restricted files. Children whose parents did not know\nor refused to provide height and/or weight were excluded (14%). We\nused the World Health Organization exclusion criteria (z-score for\n\ngender-specific BMI-for-age was <-4.0 or >+5.0) (23) to exclude\nrecords with implausible parent-reported height and weight (6.3%)\nfrom the main analysis for a final sample size of 54,325 \nchildren and\nteens 2\u00ad17 years of age. In a sensitivity analysis, however, we included\nrecords with implausible height and weight values to assess the actual\ndata collected by professional interviewers using a well-tested \nsurvey\ninstrument. In contrast, the NSCH height and weight data were edited\nbefore public release (22) and extreme values were suppressed to\ndecrease disclosure risk. The NSCH file includes a precalculated BMI\nfor respondents with nonmissing and unsuppressed weight and height,\nand nonmissing sex. Of the NSCH sample aged 2\u00ad17 years, 8.5% was\nexcluded for missing values for height and/or weight (respondent did\nnot know or refused to answer), and 0.2% for suppression of extreme\nvalues so that overall, 8.7% had missing values for precalculated BMI.\nThese data were compared to measured data for children 2\u00ad17 years\nof age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). The NHANES collects measured height and weight data\nthrough standardized physical examinations in mobile examina-\ntion \ncenters. A nationally representative sample of respondents are\nselected from the United States civilian noninstitutional population in\nthe 50 States and the District of Columbia using a complex multistage\n\nthe examination portion of the survey for children 1\u00ad19 years of age\nranged between 81 and 88% (25). Pregnant girls and those with missing\nmeasured weight and height data were excluded (<4%), a routine exclu-\nsion that was not possible with the NHIS or NSCH because pregnancy\nstatus was not assessed in those surveys. The final NHANES sample size\nWeight status was defined according to BMI percentile for age and\ngender from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\ngrowth charts (4,26). Overweight was defined as BMI  95th percentile\nfor age and gender. To calculate BMI percentiles for the NHIS \nsample,\nwe used an online SAS program provided by Centers for Disease\n\nControl and Prevention which defines percentiles based on months of\nage (23). Because age was reported in whole years for the NHIS sample,\nwe categorized children according to the midpoint of their age-year\n(e.g., 2-year-olds were categorized as 30-month-olds). For the NSCH,\nwe used the precalculated BMI percentiles that were also estimated\nusing this method (22). That is, BMI percentile was determined using\nthe same methodology for the NHIS and NSCH samples.\nThe childhood overweight prevalence estimates and mean height\nand weight values from NHIS and NSCH parent-reported data were\ncompared to estimates from NHANES measured data. Differences were\nanalyzed by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity. Two-year age groups\nproduced sufficient sample size for stable estimates. Race/\nethnicity\ngroups included were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nMexican American from NHANES and NHIS. Estimates for the over-\nall Hispanic population are not available from NHANES. The NSCH,\nhowever, does not collect data on Hispanic subgroups. Therefore, race/\nethnicity \nestimates from NSCH are for the entire Hispanic population.\nEstimates for the total sample from each survey also include race/ethnic\ngroups not shown separately.\nNational estimates were calculated using sample weights. Data were\nanalyzed using PC SAS version 9.1.

When finer age groups were\nexamined, it became clear that the results for younger age\ngroups drove this pattern. Among 2\u00ad3-year-olds, NHANES\nmeasured data yielded a prevalence estimate of 9% over-\nweight vs. 42% using NHIS parent-reported data and 44%\nusing NSCH parent-\nin contrast, measured and \nparent-reported data yielded\n\nsimilar estimates (Figure 2). For 16\u00ad17-year-olds, the com-\nparison of measured and \nparent-reported data reflected the\n\npattern seen among adults: underestimation of overweight\nprevalence using reported data compared to measured data,\nalthough the confidence intervals from all three surveys\noverlap (6). A sensitivity analysis of NHIS data included\nrecords with implausible BMI values as defined by the World\nHealth Organization exclusion \ncriteria. The pattern was\nsimilar, but with even more exaggerated \noverestimation of\noverweight prevalence among very young children (53 vs.\n42% with implausible records removed) with the difference\nnarrowing as age increased (data not shown).\nDiscrepancies between measured and parent-reported data\nwerealsoexaminedbygenderandrace/ethnicgroups(Table1).\nAlthough there was variation in the specific \npatterns observed\nbygenderandrace/ethnicity,thesamegeneral\npatterndescribed\nearlier was observed: a gradual transition from overestimation\nof overweight prevalence using parent-reported data to under-\nestimation over the 2\u00ad17-year-age span. Overestimation of\noverweight prevalence using \nparent-\nreported data was greater\nfor boys and persisted until older ages compared with girls.\nConversely, compared with boys, parent-reported data under-\nestimated overweight prevalence beginning at younger ages\namong girls.\nNext, differences between measured and parent-reported\nweight and height were assessed. This analysis revealed that\nthe means of parent-reported height among young children\nwere lower than measured means, and this difference drove the\nobserved discrepancies in overweight prevalence estimates.\nFor brevity, only the differences between NHANES and NHIS\nare shown in Table 2 because the survey years match and the\noverweight estimates for both parent-reported surveys (NHIS\nand NSCH) were similar. For both boys and girls between ages\n2 and 11 years, the mean NHIS reported height was 3\u00ad6cm\nless than mean NHANES measured height (P < 0.05). Among\nlittle difference between\nmeasured and parent-reported mean height. The relative dif-\nference between NHANES and NHIS was 3\u00ad5% for younger\nchildren and near 0% for older \nchildren. The absolute differ-\nences in the mean values for weight between NHANES meas-\nured data and NHIS parent-reported data were smaller than\nfor height (Table 3), and diverged between boys and girls. For\nolder boys, there was no difference between the measured and\nthe parent-reported mean weight values. Among 8\u00ad17-year-old\ngirls, mean weight was significantly lower in the sample with\nparental report compared to that with measured data (P < 0.05).\nThis was also true for boys 8\u00ad9 years of age. However, as for\nboys, mean parent-reported weight was significantly higher\nthan mean measured weight for 2\u00ad3-year-old girls (P < 0.05).\nTable 2 Measured and parent-reported mean height in centimeters (s.e.) and differences, children 2\u00ad17 years, by age group\nand gender, United States\nAge group\n(years) Gender\nMeasured data:\nParent-reported\ndata: NHIS\nParent-reported\ndata: NSCH\nAbsolute difference\nbetween NHANES\nand NHIS (cm)\nRelative difference\nbetween NHANES\nand NHIS (%)\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHIS, National Health Interview Survey; NSCH, National Survey of Children's Health.\narticles\n \nDiscussion\nThe rise in childhood overweight prevalence (2), the associa-\ntion between high BMI percentile in childhood and obesity\nin adulthood (27), and the health consequences through-\nout the lifespan of being overweight in childhood (28,29)\nmake \nmonitoring childhood overweight prevalence a public\nhealth priority. For groups pressed to produce local and/or\n\nreal-time data, low-cost options for surveillance are attrac-\ntive, and reliance on reported height and weight data is\n\ncommon. Furthermore, the justification for using reported\ndata is \nbolstered by studies among adolescents and adults\ndemonstrating a high correlation between self-reported and\ninvestigators warn that BMI calculated from self-reported\ndata may result in misclassified weight status with up to 50%\nof overweight adolescents being missed (8\u00ad14).\nWhat are the implications of using parent-reported\ndata for surveillance and research of overweight children?\nUse of parent-reported data overestimated childhood over-\nweight prevalence overall, specifically among the \nyoungest\nchildren when compared to measured data. The results are\nsimilar when measured data were compared to each of two\nnational interview surveys with nationally representative\n\nsamples. Although we compared sample populations and did\nnot directly compare measured and reported data for indi-\nvidual children, this analysis supports previous studies dem-\nonstrating the potential for misclassification of weight status\nparent-reported data for preschool- and elementary school\u00ad\naged children not be used to estimate overweight prevalence.\nThe overestimation of childhood overweight prevalence\nusing parent-reported data is driven primarily by the lower\nmean height for the youngest children. Although the dis-\ncrepancy in mean height between reported and measured\ndata is not very large, the calculation of BMI compounds\nany \ndifference. Neither the NHIS nor the NSCH ask parents\nto measure children or to consult records before reporting\nheight and weight. The consistently lower reported height we\nobserved could arise from difficulty in estimating the height\nof much shorter \nchildren, or from parents not tracking height\nas closely as weight. It is likely that weight is measured more\nfrequently using household scales.\nOur results differ from studies analyzing discrepancies\nbetween measured and reported data for individual preschool\nchildren. Two studies, in which parents were not aware that\nreports would subsequently be validated with measurements,\nfound little difference between means of reported and measured\nheight (16,17). However, both groups of investigators concluded\nthat studies of childhood overweight should rely on measured\ndata because of significant misclassification bias.\nAre reported data more valid for older children?\nDetermining overweight prevalence among adolescents using\nparent-reported weight and height begins to reflect the pattern\nseen for adult self-reported data--lower mean reported weight\nwith larger differences between reported vs. measured mean\nweights for females compared to males (6). This pattern has\nTable 3 Measured and parent-reported mean weight in kilograms (s.e.) and differences, children 2\u00ad17 years, by age group\nand gender, United States\nAge group\n(years) Gender\nMeasured data:\nParent-reported data:\nParent-reported\ndata: NSCH\nAbsolute difference\nbetween NHANES\nand NHIS (kg)\nRelative difference\nbetween NHANES\nand NHIS (%)\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHIS, National Health Interview Survey; NSCH, National Survey of Children's Health.\narticles\n \nbeen well documented for self- and parent-reported data for\nIn general, studies found high correlation between measured\nand reported weight and lower correlation between measured\nalso demonstrated that reported data have high \nspecificity\nbetween measured and reported data may be accentuated\namong subgroups.

Our\nresults support the recommendations of other investigators to\navoid use of parent-reported data for overweight surveillance\nCan a correction factor be used for reported data\nfor adolescents?\nAnalyses of correction factors have focused on self-reported\nrather than parent-reported data, but the lessons are applicable\nto our findings among adolescents given the similarity between\nparent- and self-reporting patterns for older adolescents. Some\nresearchers have argued that high correlation between reported\nand measured data justifies use of a correction factor for self-\nreported data for adolescents to assess overweight prevalence\n(8,14,32).Buttherearereasonstoavoidcorrectionfactors.First,\nerrors may not be homogenous. That is, discrepancies between\nreported and measured values vary by other factors in addi-\ntion to age, gender, and race/\nethnicity (5), including pubertal\nstage, time since menarche, exercise levels (6,14), and socio-\neconomic status (15). Although correction factors based solely\non reported height and weight among adults have been shown\nas accurate as more complicated methods (33), some investiga-\ntors concluded that the pattern of error in self-reported data\namong adults is difficult or impossible to \ncorrect using linear\nregression (15), and similar results have not yet been dem-\nonstrated for adolescents for whom pubertal stage may be an\nimportant modifier. Others advise that studies using reported\ndata should collect measured data from a subset of the sample\nto calculate a study-specific measure of bias (8). Second, cor-\nrelation does account for the magnitude or direction of bias. If\nreported height and weight are biased in opposite directions,\nthe bias for calculated BMI can become very high (17). Where\nonly reported data are available, such as state-level surveillance\nfrom NSCH, estimates of overweight among older children\n(starting as early as age 10 years among girls) must be inter-\npreted with the knowledge that the overweight prevalence is\nlikely to be underestimated, and that no valid correction factor\nto adjust for misclassification has been evaluated for children.\nParent-reported data for younger \nchildren are so poor that no\ncorrection is possible.\nShould reported data for weight and height\n(and the derived BMI) be used as covariates in analyses?\nSome researchers argue that the high correlation between\nreported and measured data may justify the use of continuous\nreported data for height, weight and BMI as covariates\nwith high measured values of weight tend to be least accu-\nrate (14,15,30), high BMI categories calculated from reported\n\nvalues have low sensitivity. Additional issues suggest \ncaution\nwhen interpreting analyses using continuous values for\nreported weight, height, and BMI: (i) many studies showing\nhighcorrelationhavebeenbasedonsurveyswhererespondents\nreport height and weight with the knowledge of subsequent\nvalidation (e.g., persons 16 years in NHANES)--correlation\nbetween reported and measured values may be lower for\n\nsurveys in which reported data are not validated (e.g., NHIS);\n(ii) because patterns of misclassification may vary by age\nweight status (34), using reported data increases the likelihood\nof bias. For \nexample, misclassification has been observed to\nattenuate associations between weight status and outcomes in\na study of asthma among adults (34); and (iii) the group with\nthe least accurate reporting of weight--persons with high body\nweight--has increased in prevalence. Again, parent-reported\ndata for small children yield unreliable values for BMI and\nshould not be used, even as continuous data as covariates.\nThe main limitation of this study is the inability to compare\nparent-reported and measured data for individual children. By\ndirectly comparing the NHIS sample to the NHANES \nsample,\nwe assume that these nationally representative surveys contain\ncomparablesamplesofchildrenintermsofweight\nstatus.Finally,\nour results are based on samples of children from the United\nStates. To the extent that reporting of weight and height may\ndiffer by race/ethnicity, cultural norms, and other \nfactors, results\nmay not be generalizable to populations of other countries.\nUse of parent-reported data for children from each of two\nnational health surveys overestimates childhood overweight\nprevalence compared to measured data from a national\n\nexamination survey. Weight status estimated using measured\ndata remains the gold standard for childhood overweight\n\nsurveillance. Although this analysis could not compare parent-\nrelated and measured data for individuals, the results reinforce\nprevious recommendations that parent-reported data not be\nused to estimate prevalence of overweight among preschool-\nand elementary school\u00adaged children. Given that there is\na need for simple, cost-effective methods to obtain reported\nheight and weight in young children, more research is needed\nto find either appropriate correction factors or techniques that\ngenerate more accurate reports.\n"
