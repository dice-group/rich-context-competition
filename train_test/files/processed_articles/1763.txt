While the underlying etiology is\nunclear, chronic, low-grade inflammation is a suspected key factor. Genetic variants within genes involved in\ninflammatory processes may, therefore, contribute to the development of albuminuria.\nMethods: We evaluated 60 polymorphisms within 27 inflammatory response genes in participants from the\nsecond phase (1991-1994) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a\npopulation-based and nationally representative survey of the United States. Albuminuria was evaluated as\nlogarithm-transformed albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), as ACR  30 mg/g, and as ACR above sex-specific\nthresholds. Multivariable linear regression and haplotype trend analyses were conducted to test for genetic\nassociations in 5321 participants aged 20 years or older. Differences in allele and genotype distributions among\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans were tested in additive and codominant genetic\nmodels.\nResults: Variants in several genes were found to be marginally associated (uncorrected P value < 0.05) with log\n(ACR) in at least one race/ethnic group, but none remained significant in crude or fully-adjusted models when\ncorrecting for the false-discovery rate (FDR). In analyses of sex-specific albuminuria, IL1B (rs1143623) among\nand NOS3 (rs2070744) were significantly associated with ACR  30 mg/g in this population (additive models, FDR-P\n< 0.05). In contrast, no variants were found to be associated with albuminuria among non-Hispanic blacks after\nadjustment for multiple testing. The only variant among non-Hispanic whites significantly associated with any\noutcome was TNF rs1800750, which failed the test for Hardy-Weinberg proportions in this population. Haplotypes\nwithin MBL2, CRP, ADRB2, IL4R, NOS3, and VDR were significantly associated (FDR-P < 0.05) with log(ACR) or\nalbuminuria in at least one race/ethnic group.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest a small role for genetic variation within inflammation-related genes to the\nsusceptibility to albuminuria. Additional studies are needed to further assess whether genetic variation in these,\nand untested, inflammation genes alter the susceptibility to kidney damage.\n* Correspondence: RNed@cdc.gov\n1Office of Public Health Genomics, Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and\nLaboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2010 Ned et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Albuminuria serves not just as an important\nmarker of kidney damage but also as a prognostic factor\nfor the progression of kidney disease. In fact, kidney\ndamage often precedes a decline in normal kidney func-\ntion. Of great clinical importance, albuminuria is also a\nstrong and independent predictor of cardiovascular dis-\nease (CVD), and of all-cause and CVD-related mortality\n(reviewed in [3,4]), even at levels conventionally consid-\nered within the normal range [5].\nIn adults, the prevalence of albuminuria rises with age\nand is further increased in the presence of hypertension or\ndiabetes. In the U.S. population, the estimated prevalence\nof microalbuminuria (typically defined as urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio (ACR) between 30 and 299 mg/g) is\napproximately 3% in adults without adverse health condi-\ntions, but is approximately 17% in hypertensive persons\nand approximately 29% in those with diabetes [6].\nThe underlying cause(s) of albuminuria are numerous;\nbut, the mechanisms of injury that lead to loss of albu-\nmin in the kidneys are unclear. However, some data\nsuggest that albuminuria is a consequence of widespread\nvascular endothelial dysfunction or of chronic, low-grade\ninflammation [7,8], two pathophysiologic processes that\nmay also underlie the strong link between albuminuria\nand cardiovascular disease. These processes are them-\nselves tightly linked, as inflammation has been shown to\nbe a major determinant, and consequence, of endothelial\ndysfunction [9,10]. Since cytokines and other molecules\nthat mediate inflammation can mediate vascular\ndamage, they may play an important role in the patho-\ngenesis of kidney damage. However, most studies that\nhave found an association between albuminuria and var-\nious serum or plasma markers of inflammation (e.g.,\nCRP, IL-6, TNF-a, fibrinogen, white blood cell count)\nhave been cross-sectional [11-16]; therefore, no determi-\nnation of temporality or causality could be made. Pro-\nspective studies have found that the development of\nincreased urinary albumin excretion is preceded by ele-\nvated levels of inflammation markers: CRP in a general\nwhite population [17] and both CRP and fibrinogen in\npersons with type 2 diabetes [18]. Such studies lend sup-\nport to the notion that inflammation may contribute to\nthe development of kidney damage.\nAccordingly, we were interested in testing genetic\nassociations with albuminuria for genes involved in the\ninflammatory response. There have been few such\nstudies to date, with the majority of analyses having\ntested for association specifically with diabetic nephro-\npathy, end-stage renal disease, or with morbidity or\nmortality in these patient populations [19-22], but not\nwith albuminuria or other measures of kidney damage.\nTherefore, the goal of this study was to assess the\ngenetic contribution to the development of albuminuria\nby testing polymorphisms in 27 genes involved in the\ninflammatory response in DNA samples collected from\nparticipants in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III). This work is the\nfirst to examine the association of genetic polymorph-\nisms with albuminuria using a population-based, nation-\nally representative sample of the U.S. population.\nMethods\nStudy population\nNHANES III is a population-based and nationally repre-\nsentative survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation of the United States aged 2 months or older that\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention (CDC) [23,24]. The survey relied on a\nmultistage, complex survey design that included four self-\nidentified race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and \"other.\" Oversam-\npling in certain populations\u00ad the very young, the elderly,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans\u00adwas per-\nformed in order to produce more unbiased estimates of\ndisease prevalence and other health indicators in these\ngroups [25]. During the second phase of NHANES III\nimmortalized with Epstein-Barr virus, creating a DNA\nparticipants aged 12 years or older [26], whose characteris-\ntics have been described [27].\nAnalyses were limited to DNA samples of participants\nalbumin excretion in children are not well established and\nthe assessment of proteinuria in children differs from\nadults [28,29]. The following persons were then excluded:\npregnant women (N = 111), persons in the \"other\" race/eth-\nnic group (N = 276), and individuals with a self-reported\nhistory of kidney cancer (N = 7). We also excluded men-\nafter finding elevated urine albumin excretion in this group\n(data not shown). The final sample size included 5321 adult\nSelection of genes and polymorphisms\nSpecific genes were included in our analysis based on\ntheir involvement in inflammation as determined by\ninformation gathered from GeneCards [31], Gene Ontol-\nogy [32,33], and the published literature in the case of\nVDR [34]. All available variants within these genes were\nincluded in the current study without regard to allele\nfrequency or the amount of linkage disequilibrium\nbetween variants. The majority of the polymorphisms\nwere chosen from a larger set that had been genotyped\nfor an NHANES III study on allele frequencies and gen-\notype prevalence in the U.S. population [27]. In addi-\ntion, the two available variants from relevant genome-\nwide association studies were also included: GCKR var-\ntion to kidney function [36].\nGenotyping and quality control methods\nPolymorphisms in APOE (N = 2), CRP (N = 15), GCKR\n(N = 1), and an unknown gene (N = 1) were genotyped\nin NHANES III by various investigators [26]. Our group\ngenotyped all remaining variants included in this study;\nIllumina GoldenGate assay (San Diego, CA). GCKR var-\nlaser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectro-\nscopy platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) [37]. All\nremaining polymorphisms were genotyped using Taq-\nMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or MGB\ntyping was performed by laboratory staff that were\nblinded to the phenotypic data of the study participants.\nAll genetic variants passed quality control criteria as\nMeasurements and definitions\nUrinary albumin (g/mL) and urinary creatinine (mg/\ndL) were measured from one random, untimed spot\nurine collection as previously described [6]. Urinary\nalbumin concentration was measured by solid-phase\nfluorescent immunoassay; and urinary creatinine con-\ncentration was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe\nmethod. Further details of all NHANES III laboratory\nmethods are available online [40]. Albuminuria was\ndefined using the continuous variable urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio (ACR) and as dichotomous variables\nusing either a single threshold (urinary ACR  30 mg/g)\nor sex-specific cut-offs (urinary ACR  17 mg/g in men\nand  25 mg/g in women) to account for greater creati-\nnine excretion in men than in women.\nSeveral variables were used to characterize study parti-\ncipants and were included in multivariable-adjusted ana-\nWaist-to-hip ratio was defined by sex-specific cut-offs:\ndefined as self-reported diabetes (answering \"yes\" to\n\"ever been told you have sugar/diabetes\"), but excluding\nwomen with a history of only gestational diabetes.\nHypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (bp)\n 140 mmHg, diastolic bp  90 mmHg, or if the partici-\npant was currently taking prescribed medicine for\nhypertension. Estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease Study equation re-expressed for use with\na standardized serum creatinine (Scr\neGFR = 175 \u00d7 (standardized Scr\ncreatinine values were standardized as described [44].\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SAS-Callable\nSUDAAN 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC, USA) and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC, USA) to account for the NHANES III complex\nsampling design. Nationally representative estimates\nwere calculated using sample weights for the NHANES\nIII DNA bank as previously described [27]. Appropriate\nstandard errors and confidence intervals were calculated\nusing the Taylor series linearization approach [45,46] to\ncorrect for correlations within sampled clusters, includ-\ning the possible genetic relatedness of persons sampled\nfrom the same household.\nIn descriptive analyses, the prevalence of albuminuria\nand the geometric mean of ACR were calculated by\nrelevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the\nparticipants. Allele frequencies and tests for deviations\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg proportions were calculated as\npreviously described [27]. The associations between the\ngenetic variants and each outcome were assessed sepa-\nrately in each race/ethnic group in crude and adjusted\nlogistic regression models. Associations were also exam-\nined in combined analyses of all participants after con-\ntrolling for race/ethnicity in the logistic regression\nmodels. Urinary ACR was positively skewed and, thus,\nlogarithm-transformed to approximate a normal distri-\nbution. The logarithm-transformed values were used in\nall analyses of urinary ACR as a continuous variable.\nCovariates were determined by significant association\n(P < 0.05) of the variable (i.e., age, sex, education, smok-\ning, alcohol use, and waist-to-hip ratio) with the outcome\nin non-genetic models in at least one of the race/ethnic\ngroups. Hypertension and diabetes were not considered,\nas these conditions are often part of the causal pathways\nthat result in chronic kidney disease. Variables included\nin all multivariable models are listed in each table.\nGenetic variants were tested assuming two modes of\ninheritance: additive (with a change in the odds ratio or\nbeta-coefficient per copy of the minor allele) or codomi-\nnant (all three genotypes assessed individually). The\nminor allele of each variant was defined by the preva-\nlence in the total population using NHANES III genetic\nto test for associations involving multiple variants within\na single gene. The HAPLOTYPE procedure available in\nSAS/Genetics 9.2 was used to calculate the probability\nthat an individual has a specific haplotype given their\nunphased genotype and the estimated haplotype fre-\nquencies. Haplotype terms that reflected the number\nand probabilities of the haplotypes were defined based\non the method proposed by Zaykin, et al. [47]. Since\nour study included a large number of polymorphisms in\nCRP, the incremental search algorithm available in the\nHTSNP procedure in SAS/Genetics 9.2 was used to\nidentify a set of markers for this gene that tagged non-\nrare (frequency >5%) haplotypes with a proportion of\ndiversity explained (PDE) greater than 0.99. The haplo-\ntype analysis for CRP included only those markers iden-\neach gene were coded in aggregate as \"other\", except in\ncases where only one haplotype was rare. The major iso-\nforms of APOE -2, 3, and 4-were determined from\n[39] and were tested assuming additive and codominant\nmodes of inheritance. For all genes, the effect of each\nindividual haplotype, as well as the overall association\nbetween all haplotypes and each outcome, were tested\nusing regression models. Regression models with CRP\ndue to its very low minor allele frequency. This variant\nwas, consequently, excluded from presentation and\ninclusion in any haplotypes.\nPrevalence odds ratios and beta-coefficients with 95%\nconfidence intervals were estimated from both univari-\nate and multivariable regression models. All associations\n(descriptive and genetic) were tested at the threshold of\n0.05 using the Satterthwaite-adjusted F-statistic, a stable\nand preferred test statistic for the analysis of complex\nsurvey data [48]. For all genetic association analyses,\nP-values from the Satterthwaite-adjusted F-statistics\nwere adjusted to control for the false discovery rate\n(FDR) [49,50] in each race/ethnic group.\nResults\nBasic demographic characteristics and urinary albumin\nexcretion profile of the included NHANES III partici-\npants (N = 5321) are listed in Table 1. The geometric\nmean of ACR differed among most measured demo-\ngraphic and clinical groups, including those defined by\nsex, age, and waist:hip ratio (P value  0.0007 for all).\nHowever, this measurement did not differ by race/ethnic\ngroup or by smoking status. The estimated total popula-\ntion prevalence of albuminuria in adults  20 years was\n12.2% of women having the condition as defined by sex-\nspecific cutoff values. The prevalence of albuminuria\nwas considerably higher in older participants, in persons\nwith diabetes, and in persons with hypertension (all\nP <0.0001). The prevalence of albuminuria also differed\nby race/ethnic group, educational attainment, alcohol\nuse, and waist:hip ratio. In participants with elevated\nlevels of serum CRP, which is a common indicator of\ninflammation, the geometric mean of ACR and the pre-\nvalence of albuminuria were increased (P < 0.0001). Par-\nticipants with moderately to severely reduced kidney\nfunction, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate\nprevalence of albuminuria and elevated geometric mean\nAllele frequencies of each of the included candidate\ngene polymorphisms are presented in Table 2. For 59 of\nthe 60 variants (98.3%), the allele frequency varied sig-\nnificantly across race/ethnic groups (P < 0.05). There\nare several variants with substantial relative or absolute\ndifferences in allele frequency between populations (e.g.,\nEach polymorphism was tested individually for asso-\nciation with log(ACR) (as a continuous variable) and\nwith albuminuria (as dichotomous variables) in univari-\nate and multivariable regression models stratified by\nrace/ethnic group. Two multivariable models were\nassessed: adjustment for age and (where appropriate)\nsex, and full adjustment for a number of demographic\nand clinical variables. Variants with results of P < 0.05\nin additive genetic models prior to adjustment for the\nfalse-discovery rate (FDR) are presented in Tables 3, 4\nand 5 (crude and fully-adjusted models only). Complete\nresults for all individual polymorphisms under additive\nand codominant modes of inheritance are available in\nAdditional File 1, Tables S1-S6.\nIn additive models, no more than five variants were\nassociated with log(ACR) in any race/ethnic group in\ncrude or fully-adjusted analyses (uncorrected P values <\n0.05; Table 3). The results of models adjusting only for\nage and sex were similar to the fully-adjusted models\nfor each variant in each race/ethnicity (Additional File 1,\nTable S1).

We describe here the results of this\nwork carried out with adults who participated in\nNHANES III, a population-based sample survey that is\nnationally representative of the U.S. population. We\nrestricted analyses to albuminuria outcomes instead of\nchronic kidney disease, since the genes that influence\nrenal function may differ from those contributing to\nrenal damage and proteinuria [51-53]. Many of the\nincluded genes are involved in other cellular or physio-\nlogic pathways, such as lipid metabolism (e.g., APOE,\nPPARG), hemostasis (e.g., F2, F5, FGB), and oxidative\nstress/nitric oxide production (e.g., PON1, CAT, NOS2A,\nIt is unknown whether polymorphisms in inflamma-\ntion genes affect the normal variation in urinary albu-\nmin excretion in humans, or whether such genetic\nvariation plays a role only in the susceptibility to renal\ndamage once some sort of ischemic or toxic insult is\nacquired. Our results only minimally support a role for\nsuch polymorphisms in the establishment of normal\nurinary albumin excretion, since all but one individual\ngenotype and few haplotypes were significantly asso-\nciated with continuous log(ACR) after adjustment for\nmultiple testing. We do show that increasing minor\nallele copy number of polymorphisms in TNF in non-\nHispanic whites (crude and age-adjusted models) and\nIL1B in Mexican Americans (both multivariable models)\nwere associated with albuminuria as defined by sex-spe-\nHardy-Weinberg proportions in non-Hispanic whites, so\nthis result should be interpreted cautiously. No poly-\nmorphisms were associated with sex-specific albumi-\nnuria in codominant models in any race/ethnic group.\nFor comparison, we also analyzed data for albuminuria\ndefined by a single threshold for both men and women.\nThese analyses yielded results similar to those for sex-\nspecific albuminuria, though among Mexican Ameri-\ncans, genetic variants in CRP and NOS3 were also sig-\nnificantly associated with ACR  30 mg/g under additive\npolymorphism significantly associated with single-\nthreshold albuminuria in codominant models after cor-\nrecting for multiple testing (FDR-P < 0.0001). The sig-\nnificance of this variant only after full multivariable\nadjustment may be due to instability of the regression\nin Mexican Americans. CRP haplotypes were not asso-\nciated with single threshold albuminuria in Mexican\nAmericans, though rare CRP haplotypes as a group were\nmarginally associated (uncorrected P value < 0.05) with\nsex-specific ACR. The C-T haplotype of NOS3 was\nfound to be significantly associated with both definitions\nof albuminuria in Mexican Americans, strongly implicat-\ning this gene in the susceptibility to kidney damage. We\nfound no evidence of an effect of other haplotypes on\nthe odds of albuminuria after adjusting for multiple\ntesting.\nWe calculated the power of our study to detect asso-\nciations of individual polymorphisms with log(ACR) and\nsex-specific albuminuria within each race/ethnic group,\nusing a two-sided a set at 0.05 and assuming a design\neffect of 1.2.

No asso-\nciation with albuminuria was found for the TGFB1\nfound associated with urine albumin levels or albumi-\nnuria in hypertensive Italian men [57], though the TC\nand CC genotypes of the Pro10Leu variant was found\nassociated with albuminuria and urine albumin excre-\ntion in a separate study of Italian hypertensive patients\nACR and higher risk of albuminuria in diabetic and\nnondiabetic European American family members [59].\nNeither variant was associated with urine albumin\nexcretion or albuminuria in a smaller study of hyperten-\nsive white men [60]; nor was the Asp298Glu variant\nassociated with urinary albumin excretion in healthy\nVenezuelans [61]. Neither NOS3 variant was associated\nwith ACR in a family-based study of Mexican Ameri-\ncans [62], a finding not completely supported by our\nstudy. The AA genotype of PON1 variant rs662\n(Gln192Arg) was recently found associated with albumi-\nnuria in a large study of Japanese, but only among\nwomen [63]. Genetic variation in the CCL5 gene has\nbeen associated with ACR in a non-diabetic Japanese\nincluded in our analyses was not studied [64].

The well studied APOE variants\n4 alleles (isoforms) are composed, were weakly asso-\nciated with glomerular filtration rate (a measure of kid-\nney function) in non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic\nblacks in NHANES III, but kidney damage was not\nassessed separately [39]. In one study that assessed pro-\ngression of chronic kidney disease, APOE genotypes\nwere not significantly associated with macroalbuminuria\nbeen limited primarily to type 1 diabetic populations, in\nwhich there are conflicting data on the role of MBL2\npolymorphisms in diabetic nephropathy [67,68]. To our\nknowledge, there have been no published genetic asso-\nciation studies of urinary albumin excretion or albumi-\nnuria that included variants in many of the genes in\nwhich we found polymorphisms or haplotypes signifi-\ncantly associated with any outcome in at least one race/\nethnic group (e.g., CRP, IL1B, TNF, or VDR).\nStudies such as ours are complicated by the fact that\nthe assessment of albuminuria in any population is not\nstraightforward. Though the gold standard for the quan-\ntitative evaluation of proteinuria is a 24-hr urine collec-\ntion, this method is inconvenient and is prone to errors\n[28]. For the screening of adults for proteinuria, various\norganizations recommend measurement of an untimed\n(i.e., spot) urine sample using a ratio of albumin to crea-\ntinine [69]. This use of a ratio corrects for variability\ndue to hydration, diuretics, osmotic diuresis, and con-\ncentrating defects [28,70] and has been shown to\ncorrelate well with 24-hr urine albumin excretion\ndefined as urinary ACR  30 mg/g for both men and\nwomen. Sex-specific criteria have been advocated in\norder to account for greater creatinine excretion in men\nrecommendations for use of such criteria [28]. Impor-\ntantly, given the strong predictive value of even low-\ngrade albuminuria for cardiovascular disease, it has been\nsuggested that albuminuria be interpreted as a conti-\nnuum rather than as threshold cut-off values, as dichot-\nomizing albuminuria results in the loss of important\nclinical information [5,76]. Therefore, we analyzed urin-\nary ACR as both a continuous variable and as dichoto-\nmous variables. We did not adjust for hypertension or\ndiabetes in our analyses as these conditions are major\nrisk factors for chronic kidney disease. The genetic asso-\nciations examined here may have been distorted if the\nincluded polymorphisms act, at least partially, via these\ncausal pathways to affect urine albumin excretion.\nStatistical analyses were performed for individual\npolymorphisms under two modes of inheritance. Addi-\ntive models detect both additive and dominant genetic\nloci effectively, but perform poorly for recessive alleles\n[77,78]. Codominant models have the best performance\nwhen the true inheritance pattern is unknown [77,78].\nHowever, codominant models seemed to be less robust\nin situations of low MAF, such that our estimates may\nbe less stable and our power to identify a recessive\neffect poor. Furthermore, odds ratios could not be esti-\nmated for some codominant models when the MAF\nwas very low.\nOur study has several limitations, some of which are\nspecific to analyses in NHANES. First, we included one\nspot urine sample for the measurement of urinary ACR,\nas repeat tests were performed only in a small subset of\nNHANES III participants [1,79]. Therefore, we could\nnot differentiate between participants with persistent\nalbuminuria and those with transiently elevated urinary\nACR. The use of the single albuminuria measurement\ncould misclassify cases and controls and bias our results\nsince agreement between initial and repeat urine tests\nwas not perfect [1,28,79]. Secondly, because NHANES\nIII is a nationally representative study, there were few\nparticipants with severe kidney damage. In fact, only a\nsons in our study population displayed clinical protei-\nwomen). This may have hampered our ability to detect\ngenetic associations with log(ACR) or albuminuria. Also,\nwe did not perform separate analyses for diabetics or\nhypertensives as the resulting sample size within each\nrace/ethnic group would have been limiting. However,\nthere is some evidence that similar genes may contri-\nbute to ACR in both nondiabetic and diabetic\nindividuals [80]. Furthermore, we were unable to assess\npopulation stratification in our analyses, as data from\nancestry-informative markers are not yet available for\nNHANES III. The large sample size of NHANES III did\nallow for separate analyses within each of the three\nmain race/ethnic groups, self-reported designations that\nhave been shown to correspond with ancestry as derived\nfrom ancestry-informative markers for these populations\n[81-85]. These race/ethnic group-stratified analyses\nenabled us to account at least partially for differences in\nalbuminuria profile, allele frequencies, and linkage dise-\nquilibrium patterns between race/ethnicities. We cannot,\nhowever, discount that there may be residual population\nsubstructure within the race/ethnic groups that may\nhave affected our results. Therefore, caution should be\nexercised in interpreting our findings, especially in non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, since these\npopulations have experienced recent genetic admixture.\nIn addition, the lack of \"replication\" of marginally asso-\nciated (uncorrected P-value < 0.05) or significantly asso-\nciated variants across race/ethnic groups may be due to\ndifferences in the underlying linkage disequilibrium pat-\nterns of the populations, due to untested interactions, or\ndue to lack of power. Indeed, for categorical outcomes,\nour power to detect a typical effect size (OR = 1.3) in\neach race/ethnic group was modest. The combined ana-\nlyses that included all participants and adjusted for race/\nethnicity did not affect our overall findings, as the statis-\ntical weighting of the race/ethnic groups produced\nresults not materially different than those found in non-\nHispanic whites alone.\nA couple of limitations are not specific to NHANES.\nDefining albuminuria with sex-specific criteria does not\nalleviate all concerns regarding the measurement of\nurine albumin excretion. It has been proposed that addi-\ntional urinary ACR thresholds that account for differ-\nneeded to avoid misclassification of certain demographic\ngroups, though no specific guidelines have been devel-\noped. In addition, the use of FDR-adjusted P values to\ndetermine statistical significance may be overly conser-\nvative, as the assumption of independent tests is not\nmet given that some polymorphisms are correlated\nowing to linkage disequilibrium.\nThe NHANES data are a unique resource for epide-\nmiologic analyses in a large, population-based and\nnationally representative sample of the U.S. population.\nOur findings are generalizeable to the larger U.S. popu-\nlation and point to a few genes that may play a role in\nthe susceptibility to albuminuria. Ideally, we could have\nincluded other variants known to be related to the pro-\ngression and severity of renal disease, such as those\nwithin inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and polymorphisms\nidentified in a recent genome-wide association study as\nsignificantly associated with urine albumin excretion\n[36]. Such variants, however, have not yet been geno-\ntyped in NHANES III. NHANES should be used for\nadditional research into the associations between genetic\nvariants and renal disease and to evaluate the impor-\ntance of gene-environment interactions.\nConclusions\nWe report the association of a small set of polymorph-\nisms and haplotypes in genes involved in inflammation\nwith albuminuria-related outcomes. This study is the\nfirst to examine genetic associations with such outcomes\nusing a population-based and nationally representative\nsample of the U.S. population. Additional studies are\nneeded to further assess genetic variation in these, and\nuntested, inflammation genes and the susceptibility to\nkidney damage. Furthermore, NHANES can be used to\nfacilitate the population-level assessment of new\nand validated polymorphisms for kidney disease\nsusceptibility.\nDisclaimer\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of\nthe authors and do not necessarily represent the official\nposition of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Tables S1-S7. pdf file containing all supplementary\ntables.\nAbbreviations\nACR: albumin-to-creatinine ratio; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention; CRP: C-reactive protein; CVD: cardiovascular disease; eGFR:\nestimated glomerular filtration rate; FDR: false discovery rate; IL1B: interleukin\n1 beta; IL-6: interleukin 6; MAF: minor allele frequency; NCHS: National\nCenter for Health Statistics; NHANES III: Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey; NOS3: nitric oxide synthase 3 (endothelial cell); TNF-a:\ntumor necrosis factor alpha.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was made possible through the efforts of the CDC/NCI NHANES\nIII Genomics Working Group and funding by the Office of Public Health\nGenomics at CDC.
