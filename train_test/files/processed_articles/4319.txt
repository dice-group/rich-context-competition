Recent studies show a few possi-\nble causes for gender-related differences in CVDs, such as:\nThe change in female hormonal status and the loss of car-\ndiovascular protection provided by oestrogen.5\u00ad7 Although\nnumerous studies report gender-related differences in the\nregulation of arterial pressure and renal function by the\nrenin-angiotensin system (RAS)8\u00ad10 and the response to\nRAS inhibition,11\u00ad13 there is no mention of the selection of\nantihypertensive drugs based on gender, except in preg-\nnancy-related situations, in any of the guidelines world-\nwide. Moreover, insufficient gender-specific data has been\nprovided by clinical trials,14 making it difficult to optimise\ndrug selection for both genders. In order to understand\ngender differences in BP management, we examined the\neffect of gender on the efficacy of Val/Aml SPC in the\nChina STATUS II study.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThe study design for China STATUS II has been reported\nelsewhere.4 To summarise, China STATUS II was a multi-\ncentre, post-marketing, prospective, observational study,\nwhich enrolled 11,312 adult Chinese patients with essen-\ntial hypertension whose BP was not adequately controlled\nby monotherapy.\nAll enrolled patients had a mean sitting systolic BP\nkidney disease (CKD)) and/or a mean sitting diastolic BP\n(DBP)  90 mm Hg ( 80 mm Hg for diabetes or CKD),\nwhose BP was inadequately controlled by monotherapy.\nBefore enrolment, all patients provided written informed\nconsent. The study complied with the International\nConference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice\n(ICH-GCP) and applicable local regulations in China, and\nwas approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the First\nHospital of Harbin Medical University. All procedures fol-\nlowed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the\nresponsible committee on human experimentation (institu-\ntional and national) and with the Declaration of Helsinki of\nThe baseline characteristics of the randomised patients\nare described in the report of the China STATUS II study's\nmain findings.4\nEligible patients from 238 regional centres across 29\nlifestyle nor medication change in all subjects. The lifestyle\nquestionnaires included questions on education and socio-\neconomic status, occupation, history of previous illness and\ndisorders or surgical operations, lifetime history of con-\nsumption of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, and physical\nactivity. All patients who had stopped taking other antihy-\npertensive drugs received Val/Aml 80/5 mg SPC for 4\nweeks, instead of their previous antihypertensive drugs.\nfor diabetes or CKD)) was unified to < 140/90 mm Hg, for\neasier management. The treatment was in accordance with\nthe routine clinical outpatient practice in China. The study\nduration was 8 weeks, with a follow-up every 4 weeks. If a\npatient did not achieve BP control at the end of 4 weeks of\nthe SPC, an additional antihypertensive agent could be\nadded, according to the physician's decision.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS\u00ae soft-\nware version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA),\nwitha2-sidedsignificancelevel(p)of<0.05.Demographic\nand baseline variables were summarised using descriptive\nstatistics, including the mean, SD, median, minimum and\nmaximum values for numeric variables; and the count\nnumber and percentage for the categorical variables. We\nused the T test, chi-square test and Fisher accurate proba-\nbility test.\nWe estimated the changes in SBP and DBP at 4 and 8\nweeks for gender and age as fixed effects, by using SAS\nPROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).15 For the\nanalysis in Mixed Model 1, we calculated variance compo-\nnents for the baseline BP, their BMI, smoking, drinking,\nexercise and education level, using gender and age as fixed\neffects. The same analysis was then used in Mixed Model\n2, adjusting for the baseline BP and statistically significant\neffects in Model 1.\nResults\nDemographic and baseline characteristics\nThe detailed demographic and baseline characteristics of\nthe patients are presented in Table 1. We analysed a total of\nAt enrolment, the men were younger in age (p < 0.001) and\nhad a higher BMI (p < 0.001) than women. Compared with\nthe female patients, we observed a higher educational\nbackground, more physical activity, and more smoking\nand drinking in the male patients (p < 0.05). There were no\nsignificant differences in their present cardiovascular risk\nfactors and medical history, and their previous use of anti-\nhypertensive drug classes, between these men and women\n(Table 1).\nWang and Chen 3\nBlood pressure during follow-up\nSBP was higher in the female patients versus the male\n0.003); whereas DBP was higher in male patients versus\nAfter the treatment, a significantly lower proportion of\nwomen did not achieve the target BP, compared with men\nthe effect of age on drug efficacy, both genders were\nand > 75 years. As a result, for all enrolled patients, the\nproportion of patients not achieving the target SBP\nincreased with age; however, the proportion of patients not\nachieving the target DBP was the opposite (Figure 1).\nThe next assessment included the changes in SBP and\nDBP at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, according to gender\nand age, by using SAS PROC MIXED. The p values\nobtained from the Mixed Model were as follows: Changes\nTable 1.

There was\nno significant correlation between the patients' age, gen-\nder, BMI, smoking, drinking, exercise and education level.\nThe Mixed Model 2 was adjusted for the baseline BP\nand statistically significant effects in the Model 1. That\nmixed model showed that the changes in SBP were\nclosely related to gender. Given that the proportion of the\nwomen who did not achieve the target BP was lower as\ncompared with the men in this study, the SBP-lowering\neffect of the Val/Aml treatment might be better in women.\nIn addition, the changes in DBP were closely related to\nage. These findings were consistent in both Mixed Model\n1 and Mixed Model 2 (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nOne major finding of our study was that a gender differ-\nence existed in the treatment response to Val/Aml among\nChinese hypertension patients, indicating that this therapy\nmight show better SBP-lowering effects in women.\nMajor gender differences exist in the development and\nprogression of hypertension and CVD. Before menopause,\nwomen usually have lower BP and less hypertension and\nCVD, relative to age-matched men16,17; however, this car-\ndiovascular protection in women is lost after menopause.18\nSeveral studies confirm that gender differences exist in\nterms of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic char-\nacteristics of drugs.19\u00ad21 Wing et al.22 shows that treatment\nFigure 1(a).

Some might argue that female patients are\nalways more aware of the need for treatment and show bet-\nter compliance; thus, could get a better BP-lowering effect.\nWe also evaluated both the physician and patients' self-\ncompliance assessments, and found that there were\nno significant differences between the male and female\ngiven that the longitudinal BP response was appropriate in\nboth men and women and that the study length was short,\nwe did not consider male patients lacking compliance in\nour study. Although the cause for these gender-related dif-\nferences in response to therapy is not certain, these gender\ndifferences are associated with sexual dimorphism in the\nphysiological mechanisms that regulate arterial pressure,\nwhich can impact the male and female patients' responses\nto different therapeutic approaches.24\nTable 2.

Given that the mean post-menopausal age is 56\nyears in China,27 quite a few women in our study were in the\npost-menopausal period. Oestrogen regulates all compo-\nnents of the RAS, increasing the synthesis of angiotensino-\ngen, while decreasing the synthesis and activity of renin and\nACE. Oestrogen decreases the expression of the angiotensin\nType 1 receptor (AT1\nR) in target tissue, but increases the\nexpression of Type 2 receptor AT2\nmodels show that oestrogen and RAS blockade may act syn-\nergistically to downregulate the AT1\nan angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), the Val/Aml com-\nbination therapy might inhibit RAS activation and provide a\nbetter antihypertensive effect for post-menopausal women.\nA small study among 51 post-menopausal hypertensive\nwomen showed that the BP-lowering effect of the ARB\nirbesartan is augmented by co-administration with 17-estra-\ndiol, suggesting there are potentiating effects of the two dif-\nferent antihypertensive mechanisms.32 Of course, further\nstudy into the mechanisms of the gender differences in\nhypertension treatment is needed.\nAnother finding of our study was that for all of the\nenrolled patients, the proportion of patients not achieving\nthe target SBP ( 140 mm Hg) increased with age; how-\never, the proportion of patients not achieving the target\nDBP ( 90 mm Hg) was the opposite.\nElevated BP is an important cardiovascular risk factor.\nAlthough the target DBP and SBP are defined by guidelines,\nDBPhas historically taken precedence in hypertension man-\nagement; however, there is strong evidence that SBP is\nsuperior to DBP as a predictor of cardiovascular events, par-\nticularly in the elderly.33 Stamler et al.34 found that SBP has\na stronger association with cardiovascular risk, as compared\nwithDBP,inmiddle-agedandelderlyindividuals.Moreover,\nthe superior predictive ability of SBP was also confirmed in\na meta-analysis of 61 prospective observational studies that\nrecorded BP and cause-specific mortality.35 With an increas-\ning proportion of aging population, the prevalence of hyper-\ntension and related cardiovascular morbidity in Asian\npatients continues to rise, placing a substantial and escalat-\ning social and economic burden on this region.36 The preva-\nlence of hypertension in the Chinese population is 39%\naged > 75 years.37 The age-specific prevalence of hyperten-\nsion increased with age, throughout the age range. In our\nThe proportion of patients who did not achieve the target\nSBP increased with age. An elevated SBP increases the risk\nof CVD, mortality and renal function decline, and that risk\nmay increase at lower SBP levels in the Asian than in the\nWestern population. Hence, reducing SBP should be the\nprimary goal in the management of hypertension, particu-\nlarly as the patients age.38\nThere were several limitations in our study. First, the\nfocus was only on short-term BP lowering. The long-term\nclinical outcomes might be more important in elucidating\ngender differences and cardiovascular events. Besides, 686\n(6.06%) of the subjects of this study had to take additional\nantihypertensive agents to control their BP. The most used\ncombined antihypertensive agents were metoprolol (1.67%)\nand hydrochlorothiazide (1.45%). Because the majority\nstudy received only Val/Aml SPC for BP control, we con-\nsider that the potential impact of additional antihyperten-\nsive treatment on the BP outcome is limited. We will avoid\nthis kind of possible bias in future studies. Moreover, we\ndid not control or monitor the patients' sodium or protein\nintake, although that could be extremely difficult to imple-\nment in such a large-scale observational study.\nConclusions\nFor all the patients enrolled in our study, the proportion of\npatients not achieving the target SBP increased with age;\nhowever, the proportion not achieving the target DBP was\nthe opposite. Although the mechanisms responsible for\ngender differences in the treatment response to Val/Aml\namong Chinese patients were not addressed, our findings\nindicated that women might have a better SBP-lowering\neffect with such therapy. Gender might be a factor for con-\nsideration in the decision-making process of individual-\nised antihypertensive therapy, in the future.\n"
