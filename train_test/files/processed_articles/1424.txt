    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe extent to which greater bone strength in men is caused by proportionately greater bone mass versus\nbigger bone size is not clear, primarily because the larger overall body size of men has made direct\ncomparisons of skeletal measures difficult. We examined gender differences in femur neck (FN) areal bone\nmineral density (BMD) values collected from 5623 non-Hispanic whites aged 20 years in the third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988\u00ad1994) before and after correction for mea-\nsured height and weight. We supplemented the conventional areal BMD data (Hologic QDR 1000) with\nmeasurements of areal BMD and geometric properties (subperiosteal width, section modulus, and cortical\nthickness) made at narrow \"cross-sectional\" regions traversing the FN and the proximal shaft using a\nstructural analysis program. Before body size adjustment, men had significantly higher values than women for\nall variables at the three measurement sites (p < 0.0001). Adjustment for body size reduced the differences\nbetween the sexes for all variables but had a greater effect on BMD (1\u00ad8% higher in men) than on geometry\n(5\u00ad17% higher in men). When examined by age, the sex discrepancy was significantly greater in the older\ngroup for all variables except subperiosteal widths. We conclude that although body size difference may\naccount for most of the areal BMD difference between men and women, male bones are still bigger in ways\nthat suggest greater bone strength.

One simple explanation for this\ndifference is that men have higher areal bone mineral den-\nsity (BMD) values than women.(3) However, this interpre-\ntation fails to account for the fact that the two-dimensional\nareal BMD values are only partially corrected for bone\nsize.(4\u00ad10) Men have a larger body size on average than\nwomen, so it is not clear how much of the sex difference in\nBMD reflects differences in bone density versus body size.\nSeveral approaches to address the lack of complete cor-\nrection of areal BMD measurements for size have been\nproposed, which involve incorporating bone area and/or\n*Presented in part at the 22nd annual meeting of the American\nSociety for Bone and Mineral Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada,\n1National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.\n2The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.\n3Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon, USA.\n\u00a9 2001 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nbody weight or height in various ways.(8\u00ad10) Such adjust-\nments have been reported to reduce or eliminate differences\nin BMD between males and females of the same racial and\nethnic groups(9,11\u00ad13); in fact, some have reported that fe-\nmales have higher proximal femur bone density values than\nmales after correction for body size.(11,12)\nHowever, focusing on BMD alone may define too nar-\nrowly the search for skeletal parameters that underlie the\nlower fracture rates in men. Although BMD correlates with\nobjective measures of bone strength, it does not determine\nbone strength by itself; bone size, shape, and dimensional\ndifferences also play important roles in determining bone\nstrength and fracture risk.(14)\nUltimately, the basis of the gender differences in bone\nstrength and fracture risk must be addressed using data from\nprospective studies that collect information on incident os-\nteoporotic fractures from men and women. However, it\nshould be possible to gain some insight into the question by\ncomparing BMD values in a large data set after correction\nfor body size. Here, we have used BMD from hip dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans acquired in the\nthird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III). The conventional region BMD data are\nsupplemented with measurements made on the same scan\ndata in narrow \"cross-sectional\" regions traversing the fem-\noral neck (FN) and the proximal shaft. These latter regions\nprovide BMD as well as bone geometric properties such as\nsubperiosteal width, section modulus, and estimates of cor-\ntical thickness, which have been shown to be related to\nmechanical strength of excised bone specimens.(15)\nData source\nBone mineral data were acquired in this study as a part of\nthe NHANES III, which was conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and\nstratified, multistage probability design to select the sample\nand collected data via household interviews and by direct\nstandardized physical examinations conducted in specially\nequipped mobile examination centers. The survey has been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere.(16) All men and nonpregnant\nwomen aged 20 years and older who received the physical\nexamination in the mobile centers were eligible for bone\ndensitometry unless they had fractured both hips previously.\nAcceptable bone mineral measurements were obtained on\nscans with acceptable data from the conventional analysis.\nReasons for exclusion from structural analysis were ob-\nscured FN margins, incomplete (cut-off) scans, osteoar-\nthritic growths, metal artifacts, prosthetics or calcifications,\nand excessive anteversion. The total number of scans pro-\nviding structural measurements was 13,615, which repre-\nsents 59% of the eligible selected sample, 72% of the\neligible interviewed sample, and 82% of the eligible exam-\nined sample.\nRace and ethnicity were self-reported in the NHANES III.\nThe present study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites\nbone geometry, and body dimensions between different\nracial and ethnic groups(3,6,17) could potentially result in\ndifferent relationships between gender and BMD in the\ndifferent race/ethnic groups. Ethnic and racial influences on\nthe relationship between BMD, geometry, and gender will\nbe examined in a separate study.\nBone densitometry\nThe left hip was scanned unless there was a history of\nprevious fracture or surgery; only 1% received a scan of the\nright femur. Because their inclusion did not alter estimates,\nthose who received a scan of the right femur were included\nin the analyses. Measurements were obtained with three\nHologic QDR 1000 DXA scanners (Hologic, Inc., Waltham,\nMA, USA) located in mobile examination centers. To en-\nsure data quality, a rigorous quality control (QC) program,\nincluding use of anthropomorphic phantoms and review of\neach QC and respondent scan at a central site, was used\nthroughout the study.(18) The QC phantom program con-\nsisted of repeated measurements of reference spine and\nblock phantoms that were circulated between the three\ninstruments, weekly measurements of a local hip phantom,\nand daily scans of a local spine phantom. Instrument per-\nformance was similar to or better than that of stationary\nExtraction of bone mass and structural properties\nWe compared data between sexes for one of the five\nconventional regions of interest typically analyzed in the\nproximal femur, namely, the FN (Hologic FN) region. In the\nstructural analysis, measurements were made in a narrow\n3-mm-wide region traversing the narrowest point of the FN\n(Nrw FN) and a second 3-mm-wide region across the fem-\noral shaft (FS), 2 cm distal to the midpoint of the lesser\ntrochanter. These latter regions were chosen to permit com-\nparison of a mixed cortical/trabecular location where osteo-\nporotic fractures commonly occur, for example, Nrw FN,\nwith a purely cortical region where osteoporotic fractures\nare rare, for example, FS. These cross-sectional regions of\ninterest do not correspond to familiar BMD analysis loca-\ntions. There are no conventional counterparts to the cross-\nsectional region in the shaft, but the Nrw FN either overlaps\nor is proximal to the conventional Hologic FN region,\ndepending on FN length. The relative positions of the three\nregions are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nAt each of the two narrow regions, BMD, cross-sectional\narea (CSA), section modulus, and subperiosteal width were\nmeasured, and an estimate of mean cortical thickness was\nderived using methods described previously.(19) In brief,\nprofiles of bone mass traversing the bone in each region\nwere extracted from the image. Subperiosteal width was\nmeasured as the blur-corrected profile breadth, whereas\nCSA is the profile integral divided by the effective density\nof mineral mass in bone tissue. Thus, CSA is the surface\narea of the subperiosteal envelope after removal of soft\ntissue voids, as opposed to the total area enclosed by the\nsubperiosteal envelope. Estimates of mean cortical thick-\nness assumed that the cross-section is a circular annulus\nwith an outer diameter of the mean subperiosteal width.\nSixty percent of the measured area in the FN was assumed\nto be distributed uniformly in the cortex (with the remainder\nas trabecular bone), whereas the shaft was assumed to be\nentirely cortical bone. The cross-sectional moment of inertia\nwas derived from the integral of the mass profile (without\nassumptions of shape) after determining its center of mass.\nFinally, the section modulus was computed as the cross-\nsectional moment of inertia divided by one-half of the bone\nsubperiosteal width. The section modulus is a measure of\nbending and torsional strength.(20) Measurement precision\nfor the method was assessed with replicate hip scans from\n474 participants from phase 1 of the NHANES III. Scans\nwere taken days to weeks apart, often with different scanner\noperators. The resulting CVs ranged from 2.4% to 4.7% for\nmost parameters. The CVs for section moduli were slightly\nhigher at the neck and shaft: 7.7% and 5.4%, respectively.\nIn comparison, the CV for Hologic FN BMD measurements\non the same subjects was 3%.(18)\nSubperiosteal width also was calculated for the conven-\ntional Hologic FN region (Hologic FN width) by dividing\nfemur neck area by 1.5 cm.\nAnthropometric measurements\nBody weight was measured with an electronic load cell\nscale in kilograms to two decimal places.(21) Standing\nheight was measured with a fixed stadiometer.(21) The mea-\nsurement was recorded to the nearest millimeter using pho-\ntographs of the measuring bar.\nData analysis\nWe took two analytic approaches to explore sex disparities\nin BMD and bone geometry. In the primary approach, we used\nregression models to compare BMD and bone geometry be-\ntween sexes in the total sample of non-Hispanic whites after\nadjusting for differences between genders in age, body weight,\nand standing height. We examined these differences in the total\nsample (aged 20 years) and also within two age groups\nthat BMD declines more rapidly with age in females than in\nmales.(22,23) In the latter analysis, the older group was confined\nto ages 50\u00ad69 years to minimize possible confounding by the\nlarger number of females 69 years of age than males. We\nalso included a sex*age interaction term in this analysis to\nassess whether the relationship between the bone variable and\nsex is the same in both age groups.\nWe performed some secondary analyses to compare Ho-\nlogic FN bone values between genders using two other\nanalytic strategies that have been proposed to correct for\nbone size: (a) bone mineral apparent density (BMAD),(8,9)\nwhich was calculated as Hologic FN bone mineral content\n(BMC)/((d/2)2 h, where d is the estimated diameter of FN\n(calculated as FN area/h), and h is the height of the FN\nregion of interest, which was set to 1.5 cm by the system\nsoftware; and (b) Hologic FN BMC adjusted for height,\nweight, and FN bone area using multiple regression.(10)\nSample weights were used when calculating point esti-\nmates in the primary analyses described previously; these\nweights provide estimates that are representative of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population at the time of\nthe NHANES III and also account for oversampling and\nnonresponse in the survey. The main analyses were per-\nformed using SUDAAN,(24) a family of statistical proce-\ndures for analysis of data from complex sample surveys.\nTo further examine sex disparities, we also did exploratory\nanalyses in which we examined the differences in BMD or\nbone geometry variables in men and women whose body\ndimensions matched in various ways. Specifically, for non-\nformed separate analyses to examine male-female pairs that\nmatched either on overall height and weight or on Hologic FN\nBMD and body weight. The matching criteria were as follows:\n(a) overall height and weight: men and women whose standing\nheight matched within 1.3 cm (0.5 in) and whose body weight\nmatched within 0.23 kg (0.5 lb); or (b) Hologic FN BMD value\nand body weight: men and women whose Hologic FN BMD\nand 0.017 g/cm2 for the younger and older group, respectively)\nand whose body weight matched within 0.23 kg. There were\n30 matched pairs in each of the two age groups when matched\non overall height and weight and 46 matched pairs in each age\ngroup when matched on Hologic FN BMD and body weight.\nIn this exploratory analysis, we calculated the difference in\nBMD and bone geometry variables between the male and\nfemale in each matched pair and then expressed this difference\nas the percent of the female value. We used difference scores\nrather than the actual bone variable values in this analysis\nbecause the vast majority of the matched pairs had unique body\ndimensions. Because the NHANES III was not designed to\nproduce estimates from a sample based on individuals who\nmatched on body size, we did not use sampling weights in this\nexploratory analysis, and thus point estimates are not represen-\ntative of the U.S. population. The exploratory analyses were\nperformed using SAS.(25)\nRESULTS\nTable 1 summarizes differences in selected body size\nvariables between non-Hispanic white men and women in\nthe NHANES III sample used in the present study. Men\nwere significantly larger than women in both weight and\nFIG. 1. Hip image from Hologic DXA scanner showing positions of\nnarrow neck, Hologic neck, and shaft.\nheight after adjusting for age in both the overall sample and\nthe sample examined by age group. The male-female dif-\nferences were larger for body weight than for height.\nTo illustrate the overall effects of body size on areal bone\ndensity and geometry, the total sample of non-Hispanic\nwhites was compared between the sexes after adjusting for\nage and body size differences (Table 2). In both the Hologic\nFN and Nrw FN regions, areal BMD of males was about\n10% higher than that of females before correcting for body\nsize. Adjusting for body size (weight and standing height)\nproduced somewhat different results depending on the fe-\nmur neck region; in the Hologic FN, it reduced the differ-\nence to a small but still statistically significant 3%, whereas\nat the Nrw FN, the difference was essentially nonexistent.\nThe discrepancy in effect at the femur neck is likely caused\nby differences in the shape of these two subregions; the\n1.5-cm-long, Hologic FN region encompasses a larger pro-\nportion (33%) of the smaller FN length in the female (age-\nadjusted mean, 4.56 cm; distance between the intersection\nof neck and shaft axes and the center of the femoral head)\nthan it does in the male (30%; age-adjusted mean neck\nlength, 4.95 cm), whereas this discrepancy is not seen in the\nNrw FN because, due to its small length (3 mm), it is nearly\none-dimensional. Finally, in the FS region, the uncorrected\nareal BMD difference was larger (14%) than either neck\nregion; moreover, a noticeable sex difference (8%) was still\nevident after correction for body size.\nThe geometry measurements on the two narrow regions\nprovide further insight into possible mechanisms underlying\nputative differences in bone strength between men and\nwomen. In general, the magnitude of the difference between\ngenders for these variables tended to be greater than for\nareal BMD, with men having approximately 9\u00ad48% higher\nvalues than women before adjusting for body size. Correct-\ning for body size only reduced these differences somewhat;\nmen still had noticeably higher (5\u00ad17%) values than women\nfor all variables except cortical thickness at the Nrw FN.\nThe mechanical significance of these differences in mass\nand geometry perhaps are best depicted in the section mod-\nulus, an index of bending strength. It is notable that the\nlargest sex differences were observed for this important\ndeterminant of bone strength: before body size correction,\nthe male-female differences in section moduli were about\nfive times larger than the corresponding differences in BMD\nat both the Nrw FN and the FS regions. More importantly,\nbending strength at both locations remained 17% higher in\nmales than in females even after correction for body size.\nWe also examined the impact of two other analytic strat-\negies proposed to correct for bone size, namely, BMAD(8,9)\nor BMC adjusted for height, weight, and bone area.(10)\nThese strategies resulted in male-female differences at the\nHologic FN that were similar in magnitude (data not shown)\nto those found after adjusting for weight and standing height\n(shown in Table 2). Furthermore, the direction of the gender\ndifference was reversed when BMAD was used, with fe-\nmales having noticeably higher values than males. Thus,\nneither of these strategies provided a significant improve-\nment over use of body weight and height in our data set.\nWhen the bone variables were compared between genders\nafter stratifying by age group, a somewhat more compli-\ncated picture emerged (Table 3). First, as seen in the total\nsample, adjustment for body size reduces the differences\nbetween the sexes, with a greater effect on BMD than for\ngeometry. Likewise, sex differences were greatest in mag-\nnitude for section moduli in both age groups both before and\nafter adjusting for body size. Second, a significant sex*age\ninteraction was observed for all variables in the three femur\nregions except subperiosteal widths, which indicates that\nthe sex discrepancy was significantly greater in the older\ngroup than in the younger group in areal BMD, section\nmoduli, CSAs, and cortical thickness. For example, in the\nyounger group, body size correction resulted in Hologic FN\nBMD values that were nearly identical between the sexes\nand the areal BMD and cortical thickness values actually\nwere slightly higher in females at the Nrw FN region.\nHowever, a sex difference remains after body size correc-\ntion in the older age group: Hologic FN and Nrw FN BMDs\nwere 6% and 3% lower in females and an even larger\ndifference was seen in the shaft. Moreover, the magnitude\nof the sex difference also is larger in the older group.\nAdjusting for body size had little impact on age trends\nwithin gender, so that age patterns observed in the present\nstudy are similar to those reported previously using unadjusted\ndata.(19) However, the age patterns differed somewhat by gen-\nder. For example, mean BMD, CSA, and cortical thickness\nwere lower in the older age group in both genders, but the\nmagnitude of these differences was greater in females than\nmales. Conversely, periosteal widths were greater in older\nversus younger individuals by a similar magnitude in both men\nand women. Differences in section modulus by age depended\nsomewhat on skeletal site as well as gender. At the shaft,\nmeans were greater in the older age group in both sexes but\nmore so in men than in women. However, at the narrow neck,\nmeans were similar in older versus younger men but lower in\nolder versus younger women.\nResults from the exploratory analysis of the male-female\npairs directly matched on various body size criteria were\nconsistent with the comparisons based on statistical adjust-\nVariable Men Women\n% Difference\n(male vs. female)\nment for body size in Table 2; for example, matching on\noverall body size (weight and standing height) reduces sex\ndifferences in BMD more than geometric differences, and\nthis effect is more evident in the older age group than in the\nyounger age group (data not shown). Of particular interest\nwas the finding that directly matching men and women on\nBMD and body weight resulted in greater differences in\nsection modulus and periosteal widths than did matching on\nbody weight and standing height in both age groups.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study is among the first to examine in depth the\nconfounding of body size on femur bone density and ge-\nometry between genders. Previous studies have reported\nthat accounting for size, either by adjusting for overall body\nsize or by use of volumetric bone density estimates, resulted\nin similar or higher BMD values in women than in\nmen.(9,11\u00ad13) However, with the exception of Kroger et\nal.,(12) these studies did not explore the sex differences in\nBMD in detail by age, and none included estimates of\nskeletal geometry.\nOur results extend previous work by showing that body\nsize has a major influence on the magnitude of the BMD\ndifferences between the sexes whether measured at the\nstandard Hologic FN region, the Nrw FN region, or across\nthe FS. Correction for body size reduced the magnitude of\nthe gender difference in BMD. However, closer examina-\ntion of these regions using dimensional information re-\nvealed a more complicated picture.

More importantly, the\nimpact of body size correction on gender differences de-\npended on age, with the magnitude of gender differences in\nBMD and several aspects of bone geometry being signifi-\ncantly greater in those aged 50 years both before and after\nbody size correction. This latter finding is consistent with\nresults from Kroger et al.,(12) who also reported that cor-\nrecting for height and weight failed to remove the sex\ndifference in FN BMD among those aged 60\u00ad69 years.\nFinally, the observations that the sex discrepancy in both\nBMD and section modulus (which depends on mass distri-\nbution and subperiosteal width) increased with age while\nthe sex discrepancy in widths did not are noteworthy. They\nsuggest that the smaller BMDs and section moduli in elderly\nfemales are caused by greater rates of bone loss within the\nsubperiosteal envelope rather than to gender differences in\nthe rates of subperiosteal bone formation.\nThe explanation for the greater sex difference in the older\nage group may be complex. The greater rate of areal BMD\nloss at the hip in women versus men(22,23) is likely caused\nby, at least in part, endocrine and paracrine differences\nbetween genders. For example, estrogen plays an important\nrole in skeletal homeostasis in both genders(26,27) but the\ndecline in estrogen levels with age is more profound in\nwomen because of menopause.(26) Insulin-like growth fac-\ntor 1 (IGF-1) also declines with age in both sexes but it may\nbe related to indices of skeletal metabolism differently in\nmen and women.(28) Androgen affects skeletal mainte-\nnance in both genders and may contribute to age-related\ndifferences.(29,30) Differences in physical activity also may\ncontribute; women reported higher levels of inactivity than\nmen at all ages in the NHANES III, but the discrepancy\nwidened with age.(31) Finally, endocrine and physical fac-\ntors potentially could be working synergistically to enhance\ngender differences in the elderly. For example, Frost(32) has\npostulated that in addition to its effects on osteoclasts and\nosteoblasts, estrogen may influence the bone response to\nmechanical load stimuli via a \"mediator mechanism\" in\nbone marrow that controls disuse-mode remodeling in bone\nnext to marrow.\nSeveral unresolved issues surrounding the body size ar-\ntifact in bone measurements exist. One question is how to\nadjust appropriately for this artifact within the context of\ncurrently available measurements. We tried various body\nsize adjustments, including ones that incorporate bone area\nby regression or by calculating BMAD,(8\u00ad10) but still found\npersistent gender differences. Thus, easily obtainable mea-\nsurements such as body weight, height, or BMAD may not\nadequately capture bone size at the femur. It is not clear\nwhat convenient measurement might be possible to achieve\nthis goal.\nAnother, more important unresolved issue regarding body\nsize correction is whether it significantly improves the abil-\nity to explain gender differences in fracture risk. Our results\nsuggest that it may not, because adjusting for body size,\nwhile reducing or removing BMD differences, did not elim-\ninate gender differences in other strength-related variables.\nHowever, the lack of fracture outcomes in the present study\nprecludes a firm conclusion on this point. The small number\nof studies with fracture data that have examined this ques-\ntion also suggest that typical body size corrections may not\nimprove the predictive utility of BMD in groups that differ\nin size. For example, BMAD has not been found to improve\nfracture risk prediction(33,34) or discrimination between frac-\nture cases and noncases in women.(4) As noted by Genant et\nal.,(14) a more complex model that includes body or bone\nsize adjustments may not necessarily provide better fracture\nprediction if the additional measurements introduce more\nerror or variability. More importantly, the bias produced by\nbody or bone size confounding may have a positive or\nnegative impact on fracture risk prediction depending on its\nrelationship with fracture risk. These findings suggest the\nneed to measure directly bone size and its independent\neffect on fracture risk.\nA final related question is whether a given BMD mea-\nsurement has the same meaning in terms of bone strength in\nmen and women. This is difficult to answer at present\nbecause of the lack of data from studies that compare\nfracture risk and BMD between genders directly within the\nsame study. The few studies published to date vary in the\nskeletal sites at which BMD or fracture was assessed. Most,\nbut not all, of these studies provide risk estimates per SD\ndecline in BMD, but unfortunately it often was not clear\nwhether these were based on the same SD estimate or on\nsex-specific SDs. It is not surprising then that results from\nthese studies are mixed, with relative risks or odds ratios\n(ORs) being somewhat (albeit not statistically) higher,(35,36)\nwomen.\nResults from this study suggest that BMD values may not\nhave the same meaning in terms of bone strength in men and\nwomen; for example, when BMD differences were essen-\ntially removed by matching, noticeable gender differences\nin other strength-related parameters remained. From a bio-\nmechanical point of view, differences in geometric proper-\nties such as section modulus and subperiosteal widths are\nlikely to be relevant, because the overall structural behavior\nof bone depends on both its tissue properties (which cur-\nrently cannot be reliably measured in vivo) and its geome-\ntry.(14) Tests done on excised femoral specimens supported\nthe validity of the geometric measurements in predicting\nstrength in vitro.(15) In addition, there have been several in\nvivo and in vitro studies that show that the strength of long\nbone shafts is predicted by the section modulus (or the\ncross-sectional moment of inertia, a component of the sec-\ntion modulus).(42\u00ad46) Moreover, this parameter is used\nwidely in anthropological work and animal biology to as-\nsess bone strength differences between different animals(47)\nor human groups.(48) Thus, it is relatively clear that section\nmodulus measures strength in long bone shafts.\nHowever, it is less clear whether the section modulus\ndescribes bone strength in regions with some element of\ntrabecular bone, like the FN, especially if osteoporotic. For\nexample, DuBoef et al.(49) found no apparent differences\nbetween hip fracture cases and age-matched controls in FN\ncross-sectional moments of inertia or neck widths (compo-\nnents of the section modulus). One possible explanation for\nthis lack of difference between fracture cases and controls\nmay be related to cortical thickness. We recently found(19)\nthat the section modulus appeared to decline at a much\nsmaller rate with age than the BMD in both sexes and that\nthis was likely caused by a consistent increase in the sub-\nperiosteal width with age. This femoral expansion tends to\noffset the loss in mass in an apparent attempt to maintain the\nsection modulus. However, this may be achieved in the\nelderly FN at the cost of having a relatively thin cortex. If\nthe cortex is critically thin, then the section modulus may\noverestimate strength if failure occurs by modes other than\npure bending or torsion. It is worth noting that the most\napparent difference between FN biopsy specimens of frac-\nture cases and nonfractured controls seen by Bell et al. was\nin the cortical thickness.(50)\nThus, it is clear that there are strength-related structural\ndifferences in the hip between the sexes that cannot be\neliminated by body size scaling, but without fracture out-\ncome data, our study cannot fully address the clinical rele-\nvance of the observed gender differences in bone geometry\nvariables. In addition, it is likely that male-female differ-\nences in other variables not examined here, such as body\nsoft tissue composition or falling, also may be relevant.\nThese data gaps further underscore the need for large pro-\nspective studies on men with incident osteoporotic frac-\ntures.\nStudy limitations have been described previously(19) and\ninclude use of DXA scanners that were not designed to\nmeasure bone geometry. In addition, certain assumptions\nabout the constancy of the proportion of trabecular versus\ncortical bone in the FN and bone shape had to be made to\nestimate cortical thickness. In addition, only non-Hispanic\nwhites were included in this study, and relationships be-\ntween body size, gender, and bone density may vary by race\nor ethnicity. Finally, the NHANES III sample did not in-\nclude institutionalized individuals by design, so our results\nmay not be applicable to these more frail individuals in\nwhom bone mass may be lower and geometry may differ\ndue to presence of other illnesses or bed rest. Furthermore,\nnot all individuals who were selected for the NHANES III\nsample had usable structural data. We previously found no\nevidence that differences between those with or without\ndata for the structural variables introduced major biases in\nour estimates, however.(19)\nIn conclusion, we found that body size has a major\ninfluence on the magnitude of BMD and geometry differ-\nences at several sites in the femur. The impact of body size\ncorrection on gender differences was greater for BMD than\nfor geometry and also depended on age. In younger adults,\nbody size correction essentially removed the gender differ-\nence in BMD but not in bone geometry, whereas in older\nadults, gender differences in both BMD and geometry were\nstill evident despite body size correction. Thus, gender\ndifferences in bone size that are related to bone strength are\nnot reflected in areal BMD measures even after correction\nfor body size and may contribute importantly to the lower\nfracture risk observed in men.\n"
