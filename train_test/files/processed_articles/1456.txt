Diabetes was defined by self-report. Disability was defined as\ndifficulty performing a physical task. We evaluated disability by grouping 19 physical tasks into\nfive functional groups: lower-extremity mobility (LEM), general physical activities (GPA), activ-\nities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and leisure and social\nactivities (LSA).\nRESULTS -- Older U.S. adults with diabetes had the greatest disability in GPA (prevalence\nated with two to three times increased odds of disability across functional groups (all P  0.05).\nComorbidities, mostly cardiovascular disease and obesity, and poor glycemic control (A1C\n8%) together explained up to 85% of the excess odds of disability associated with diabetes,\nwhereas poor glycemic control alone explained only 10% of the excess odds. Adjustment for\ncomorbidities, A1C, and diabetes duration fully attenuated the associations of diabetes with\ndisability in all functional groups (all P  0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS -- Older adults with diabetes have a high prevalence of disabilities with\nvariable associations attributable to comorbidities and A1C. Aggressive management of cardio-\nvascular risk factors and obesity may significantly reduce the burden of disability in this\npopulation.\nwith diabetes in the U.S. reported\nhaving a disability (1). Adults with\nfunctional disability consume a dispro-\nportionate share of health services and are\nat high risk for dependence, hospitaliza-\ntions, and death (2,3). Approximately\none-third of adults aged 65 years have\ndiabetes (46% undiagnosed), and, by the\nyear 2030, elderly individuals will consti-\ntute almost 20% of the U.S. population\n(4,5). Consequently, understanding the\nfactors contributing to functional disabil-\nity in older adults with diabetes has im-\nportant clinical and public health\nimplications.\nFunctional disability, defined as diffi-\nculty in performing routine physical\ntasks, is more common in older adults\nwith diabetes than in those without dia-\nbetes (6\u00ad12). Older adults with diabetes\nhave significantly greater difficulty walk-\ning one-quarter mile, climbing stairs, or\ndoing housework and perform worse on\nmeasures of physical performance such as\nwalking speed, muscle strength, chair\nstands, and tandem stand compared with\nThe higher prevalence of functional\ndisability in older adults with diabetes\nmay be a result of diabetes-related comor-\nbidities such as cardiovascular disease, vi-\nsion loss, obesity, and arthritis (6\u00ad12) or\npoor glycemic control (8,13). However,\nthese factors do not consistently explain\nthe association of diabetes with disability.\nThis inconsistency in the literature may\nbe due to variability in the measures of\ndisability studied or the limited number\nof physical tasks and comorbidities exam-\nined. Previous studies have not specifi-\ncally addressed the relative associations of\ncomorbidities and glycemic control with\ndisability among older adults with diabe-\ntes or whether these associations differ ac-\ncording to the type of physical task\nexamined. Furthermore, the association\nof diabetes with leisure or social difficul-\nties in older adults remains poorly\ndescribed.\nThe objectives of the present study\nwere to 1) compare the prevalence of dis-\nability in adults with and without diabe-\ntes, 2) assess the relative associations of\nindividual comorbidities and poor glyce-\nmic control with the excess disability ob-\nserved among older adults with diabetes,\nand 3) determine the independent associ-\n                                                \nFrom the 1Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity, Baltimore, Maryland; the 2Department of Epidemiology and the Welch Center for Prevention,\nEpidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore,\nMaryland; and the 3Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, Baltimore, Maryland.\nCorresponding author: Rita Rastogi Kalyani, rrastogi@jhmi.edu.\nThe contents of this publication are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nofficial view of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nInformation on NCRR is available at http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/.

Details\nregarding data collection in NHANES are\navailable elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/\nnchs/nhanes.htm).\nThe present study was based on\npleted both a questionnaire and a physical\nexamination. We excluded participants\nwho were missing information on diabe-\ntes status (n  5), education (n  26),\nBMI (n  338), or smoking history (n \n6). Thus, our study sample consisted of\nAssessment of diabetes\nDiabetes was defined by either self-report\nof a physician diagnosis or insulin use.\nOnly adults who self-reported a history of\ndiabetes were also asked about noninsu-\nlin glucose-lowering medication use. Du-\nration of diabetes was assessed by\nquestionnaire.\nAssessment of disability\nThe interviewer posed questions about\nphysical functioning and asked all partic-\nipants 20 years old about difficulties\ndoing certain physical tasks because of\nany long-term physical, mental, and emo-\ntional problems or illness and without the\nuse of any special equipment. A total of 19\nphysical tasks were assessed and derived\nfrom well-validated questionnaires (14\u00ad\n17). Participants were given the option of\nanswering \"no difficulty,\" \"some diffi-\nculty,\" \"much difficulty,\" or \"unable to\ndo.\" The 19 physical tasks were catego-\nrized into five functional groups accord-\ning to published definitions (18). The\ngroups included lower-extremity mobil-\nity (LEM) (walking one-quarter mile and\nwalking up 10 steps); general physical ac-\ntivity (GPA) (stooping/crouching/\nkneeling, standing for 2 h, sitting for 2 h,\nstanding up from an armless chair, reach-\ning overhead, grasping/holding small ob-\njects, and lifting or carrying 10 lb);\nactivities of daily living (ADL) (eating,\ndressing, getting out of bed, and walking\nbetween rooms on the same floor); instru-\nmental activities of daily living (IADL)\n(managing money, doing household\nchores, and preparing meals); and leisure\nand social activities (LSA) (going to mov-\nies/shopping/events, doing leisure activi-\nties at home, and participating in social\nactivities).\nThe primary outcome was functional\ndisability, defined as any difficulty in a\nphysical task, consistent with prior stud-\nties with fall, dizziness, or balance (1999\u00ad\n2004 only); the need for special assistance\nwith walking or special equipment such\nas a cane, wheelchair, special bed, or spe-\ncial telephone; and the presence of a dis-\nability that prevented the participant from\nworking.\nAssessment of demographics and\ncomorbidities\nInformation on age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nand smoking was ascertained from the\nquestionnaire portion of the survey.\nHistory of arthritis, coronary heart dis-\nease (CHD) (including history of angina\nor heart attack), stroke, congestive\nheart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD) (including\nemphysema or chronic bronchitis), and\ncancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin\ncancer) was also self-reported. We de-\nfined visual impairment as self-reported\ntrouble seeing despite wearing glasses or\ncontact lenses. Participants self-reported\nwhether they were limited in any way be-\ncause they have \"difficulty remembering\"\nor \"experience periods of confusion.\"\nwere asked about self-reported history of\n1) hearing difficulties, 2) leg or foot ulcer\nthat took 4 weeks to heal, and 3) hip\nfracture.\nHeight, weight, waist circumference,\nand blood pressure were measured. Obe-\nsity was defined as BMI 30 kg/m2. Hy-\npertension was defined as an average\nblood pressure of 140 mmHg (systolic)\nor 90 mmHg (diastolic), antihyperten-\nsive medication use, or self-reported phy-\nsician diagnosis. Hypercholesterolemia\nwas defined as total cholesterol 240 mg/\ndl, use of cholesterol-lowering medica-\ntions, or self-reported physician\ndiagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nwas defined as estimated glomerular fil-\ndefined peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nas an ankle-brachial index 0.90 in ei-\nther leg and peripheral neuropathy as 1\ninsensate areas in either foot as assessed\nonly). Amputations were documented af-\nter physical examination.\nMeasurement of A1C\nA1C measurements were performed by\nthe Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory at the\nUniversity of Missouri\u00adColumbia using a\nDiabetes Laboratory at the University of\nMinnesota using an A1C 2.2 Plus Glyco-\nhemoglobin Analyzer (Tosoh Medics, San\nsays are Diabetes Control and Complica-\ntions Trial-aligned.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed using\nStataSE (version 10.0; StataCorp, College\nStation, TX) and incorporated popula-\ntion-based sampling weights (6- or 8-year\ncombined weights) to obtain unbiased,\nnationally representative estimates from\nthe complex NHANES sampling design.\nSEMs for all estimates were obtained us-\ning the Taylor series (linearization)\nmethod following NCHS-recommended\nThe Wald test was used to compare\ndifferences in baseline characteristics by\ndiabetes status.

Because information\non important comorbidities (hearing im-\npairment, leg ulcer, and hip fracture) was\nnot assessed in all years, we conducted\nregression analyses limited to data from\nPAD and peripheral neuropathy from this\nanalysis because these were not ascer-\ntained for all participants. We performed\nan F-adjusted mean residual test to assess\ngoodness of fit.\nWe performed additional analyses to\nexplore correlation between continuous\ncovariates and potential effect modifica-\ntion of the association between diabetes\nand disability by sex, race/ethnicity, or\n80 years). We also investigated whether\nthe prevalence of disability differed by\nsurvey year. Sensitivity analyses were per-\nformed to examine whether the associa-\ntion between diabetes and disability was\nsimilar when disability was defined as in-\nability in a physical task. Among older\nadults with diabetes, we further explored\nwhether glycemic control (A1C 8% vs.\n10 years), or insulin use was indepen-\ndently associated with disability in logis-\ntic regression models.\nRESULTS -- The prevalence of self-\nreported diabetes in U.S. adults aged 60\nwith no significant secular trends across\nsurvey periods.

Adjustment for A1C, diabetes\nduration, and comorbidities fully attenu-\nated the association of diabetes and dis-\nability in all functional groups. Together,\nA1C and comorbidities accounted for up\nto 85% of the excess odds of disability,\nlargely due to cardiovascular disease and\nobesity, whereas poor glycemic control\n(A1C 8%) alone only accounted for up\nto 10% of the excess odds of disability\nassociated with diabetes across all groups.\nOur findings support previous stud-\nies that also reported a two to three times\ngreater odds of difficulty in performing\nmobility, upper-extremity, ADL, and\nIADL tasks among older adults with dia-\nbetes compared with adults without dia-\nbetes (6\u00ad12). The prevalence of disability\nwe report is consistent with findings in\nother nationally representative samples of\nadults of similar age (6). We also found a\nhigh degree of difficulty in performing lei-\nsure and social activity tasks, which has\nnot been examined in previous studies.\nHowever, we found that our results were\nsimilar when we defined disability as in-\nability in a physical task, a more specific\nmeasure.\nIn addition, past studies did not ex-\nplore the relative associations of multiple\ncomorbidities and poor glycemic control\nto the relationship between diabetes and\ndisability nor examine whether these as-\nsociations varied by type of task, which\nwere both important aims of our study.\nComorbidities contribute greatly to the\nhealth-related quality of life in adults with\ndiabetes, although social and environ-\nmental factors are probably also impor-\ntant. Glycemic control is an important\ngoal of diabetes management although\nhigher A1C targets (e.g., A1C 8%) may\nTable 2--Nationally representative ORs for the association of diabetes and disability among older U.S. adults after adjustment for A1C,\ndemographics Model 2: A1C\ndiabetes duration\ncardiovascular\ndisease/obesity\nModel 5: other\ncomorbidities\nData are ORs (95% CI) for disability, defined as having at least one task in the specified functional group described as \"some difficulty,\" \"much difficulty,\" or \"unable.\"\nModel 1 was adjusted for diabetes and demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and smoking history); model 2 was adjusted for model 1  A1C; model\n3 was adjusted for model 2  A1C  diabetes duration; model 4 was adjusted for model 3  cardiovascular disease and risk factors (CHD, CHF, stroke,\nhypertension, and high cholesterol)  obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2)  waist circumference; and model 5 was adjusted for model 4  other comorbidities (leg ulcer,\nCKD, visual impairment, hearing impairment, memory problems, hip fracture, arthritis, COPD, and cancer).\nDiabetes and functional disability in older adults\nbe reasonable in an older population (20).\nOur data suggest that, in contrast with\npoor glycemic control (A1C 8%), co-\nmorbidities are more greatly associated\nwith excess disability in diabetes across all\nfunctional groups. In contrast, De Rek-\neneire et al. (8) and Bossoni et al. (13)\nreported that poor glycemic control was\nsignificantly associated with the excess\nsubclinical LEM limitations and IADL dis-\nability observed in diabetes. Diabetes du-\nration was also associated with disability\nin our study, similar to previous reports\n(6). We found that the greater difficulties\nin LEM, GPA, ADL, and IADL groups ob-\nserved in older adults with diabetes com-\npared with those without diabetes are\nlargely associated with comorbidities and\ncorroborate prior findings that diabetes-\nassociated cardiovascular disease and\nobesity are linked with much of the excess\ndisability observed in these tasks\n(6,7,11). Interestingly, the higher preva-\nlence of disability we report in leisure and\nsocial activities among older adults with\ndiabetes was also largely associated with\nprevalent comorbidities.\nDiabetes may be associated with func-\ntional disability through mechanisms\nlinked to decreased cardiopulmonary re-\nserve, restricted physical movement, in-\nflammatory/sarcopenic processes,\nextremes of blood glucose, or inflexible\ntreatment regimens. We confirm that\nolder adults with diabetes have a high\nburden of cardiovascular disease and obe-\nsity; both these conditions are associated\nwith limited cardiopulmonary reserve\nand exercise tolerance. Further, other\nprevalent comorbidities in adults with di-\nabetes such as visual impairment or\nstroke may restrict physical movement\nand participation in routine activities. De-\ncreased muscle strength, lower muscle\nquality, and accelerated loss of muscle\nmass, especially in the lower extremities,\nhave all been documented in individuals\nThrough these mechanisms, older\nadults with diabetes may be more likely to\ndevelop frailty (22), a clinical condition in\nwhich an older individual is coping just\nabove the disability threshold but is liable\nto become disabled in response to a phys-\niological or psychological stressor. Hy-\nperglycemia may activate inflammatory\npathways that subsequently cause muscle\ncatabolism and disability as part of the\nhand, physical and cognitive impairment\nmay lead to difficulties in diabetes self-\nmanagement and subsequent hyperglyce-\nmia; thus, the relationship between\nhyperglycemia and disability is poten-\ntially bidirectional. Because of the limita-\ntions of the study design, we were\nunable to address the directionality of the\nobserved associations. A1C may also re-\nflect health care access, patient self-\nmanagement, and physician prescribing\npractices. Support for an association be-\ntween hyperglycemia and disability\ncomes from previous studies reporting a\nsignificant correlation between higher\never, our findings suggest that among\nolder adults with diagnosed diabetes,\npoor glycemic control is not greatly asso-\nciated with the excess disability observed.\nInterestingly, even among a population of\nolder adults with diabetes and relatively\nwell-controlled glucose levels such as\nours, there exists a significantly increased\nrisk of falling, balance, and dizziness dif-\nficulties compared with older adults\nwithout diabetes. Further, restrictive\ntreatment regimens, especially for pa-\ntients taking insulin, may be associated\nwith greater difficulty participating in lei-\nsure activities.\nA strength of our study is the evalua-\ntion of disability in diabetes across differ-\nent functional groups. Fried et al. (23)\npreviously provided a strong rationale for\ncategorizing physical tasks into functional\ngroups, and self-reported physical func-\ntioning has been demonstrated to be a re-\nliable measure (24). Our study was based\non difficulty in 19 individual tasks, in-\ncluding leisure and social activities, which\nhas not been ascertained in most previous\nstudies. This comprehensive assessment\nallowed us to explore the association of\ndiabetes-related comorbidities and A1C\nwith disability in each functional group.\nOther strengths of our study include the\nrigorous data collection procedures in\nNHANES and the ability to generate na-\ntionally representative estimates, which\nallows for comparison with other studies\nthat used national samples (6).\nLimitations of our study include the\ncross-sectional design, which does not\npermit us to draw conclusions regarding\nthe temporality of the observed associa-\ntions and renders our study vulnerable to\nsurvival bias. Individuals with diabetes\nare more likely to die at younger ages\ncompared with their counterparts with-\nout diabetes and may be systematically\nmissing from this study of older adults\n(survival bias). Also, NHANES does not\ninclude institutionalized individuals who\nprobably have a more severe and higher\nprevalence of disability than the general\npopulation. As a result, the prevalence of\ndisability may be underestimated in our\nstudy.\nAlthough highly specific for most\noutcomes, self-reported information for\ncardiovascular disease and other comor-\nbidities is a limitation and probably un-\nderestimates the true prevalence of these\nconditions. This is of particular concern\nfor our measure of cognitive function; the\ncritical relationship between cognitive\nimpairment and disability cannot be fully\naccounted for in this study and is a crucial\narea in which additional work is needed.\nSubclinical or undiagnosed cases of dis-\nease are also not captured by these\nself-reported measures. In particular,\nsubclinical cardiovascular disease is prob-\nably prevalent among older adults with\ndiabetes but may be missed by self-\nreported measures. Because this study fo-\ncused on diagnosed diabetes, individuals\nwith undiagnosed disease are included in\nthe nondiabetic group. Those with undi-\nagnosed diabetes probably have disability\nintermediate between that of individuals\nwith diagnosed diabetes and without true\ndiabetes; consequently, the prevalence of\ndisability in both groups (diabetes or no\ndiabetes) may be overestimated in our\nstudy. Analyses using different definitions\nof diabetes may result in different find-\nings. Furthermore, diabetes in the older\nadult population is heterogeneous and in-\ncludes individuals with both middle-age\nand elderly-onset diabetes; the latter\ngroup has been shown to have a lower\nburden of complications, especially mi-\ncrovascular disease (25) and has less dis-\nability in our study (data not shown).\nIn summary, there is growing recog-\nnition that the presence of functional dis-\nability significantly influences the clinical\ncare of older adults with diabetes. Our\ndata demonstrate that older adults with\ndiabetes have a high prevalence of disabil-\nities, across a range of physical tasks, with\nvariable associations attributable to dia-\nbetes-related comorbidities and A1C.\nOur results suggest that cardiovascular\ndisease and obesity, in particular, are as-\nsociated with a greater burden of disabil-\nity in this population, whereas the\nassociation of hyperglycemia with disabil-\nity needs further investigation. Future\nstudies to examine the prospective asso-\nciation of diabetes and disability should\nprovide greater insight into the direction\nof this relationship; in particular, how di-\nabetes leads to disability and how disabil-\nKalyani and Associates\nity, in turn, can lead to worsening\nhyperglycemia.\n"
