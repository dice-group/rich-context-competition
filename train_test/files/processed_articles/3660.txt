If this relation is causal, prevention of hyperthermia may improve outcome. Causality can be tested in\nanimal models. We therefore assessed the effects of hyperthermia on outcomes in animal models of ischaemic stroke\nand explored under which conditions prevention of hyperthermia could be most effective.\nMethods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from animal experiments testing the effect of\nspontaneous or induced hyperthermia on outcome after focal cerebral ischaemia. Our primary outcome measure was\ninfarct size. Normalised mean differences were combined using the random effects model and stratified meta-analysis\nwas used to explore the impact of study characteristics.\nResults: We included 19 publications, reporting on 49 comparisons involving 603 animals. Overall, hyperthermia\nincreased infarct size by 43.4% (95% confidence interval, 29.8\u00ad56.9%) and worsened neurobehavioral outcomes by\n48.5% (17.2\u00ad79.8%). The increase in infarct size was larger with higher temperatures. Hyperthermia was most harmful if\npresent for more than 2 h and when started at the time of artery occlusion rather than later.\nConclusion: Hyperthermia substantially increased infarct size in animal models of ischaemic stroke, suggesting that the\nrelation between fever and poor outcome observed in patients is at least in part causal. These data provide support to\ntrials testing the effect of the prevention of fever with antipyretic drugs in patients with acute stroke.\n",

Knowledge of these factors\nmight provide further insights in which patients pre-\nvention or treatment of hyperthermia could be most\nbeneficial, which could be used to guide the design of\nclinical trials in patients with ischaemic stroke.\nTherefore, we performed a systematic review and\nmeta-analysis to assess the effects of hyperthermia in\nanimal models of ischaemic stroke.\nMethods\nSearch strategy and study inclusion\nWe performed a systematic literature search in\nMedline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to July\n2017 for synonyms of ischaemic stroke, hyperthermia,\nand animal experiments (see Appendix 1 for the exact\nsearch strategy). After removing duplicates, two\nauthors independently screened titles and abstracts\nfor relevance and, where appropriate, evaluated full-\ntext versions of the selected articles for eligibility.\nAny discrepancy was resolved by consensus discussion.\nWe included articles if (1) ischaemic stroke was mod-\nelled in an animal by means of a cerebral artery occlu-\nsion; (2) hyperthermia was compared to controlled\nnormothermia; and (3) at least one of the following\noutcomes was assessed: infarct size, cerebral oedema,\nneurobehavioral outcome, or mortality. Both studies\nwhich assessed induced hyperthermia (by means of\ninternal or external heating) or spontaneous hyperther-\nmia (due to the surgical procedure or the occurrence of\ncerebral ischaemia) were included. Only studies assess-\ning intra- or post-ischaemic hyperthermia were consid-\nered; studies which assessed the effect of hyperthermia\nbefore the onset of ischemia alone were excluded.\nStudies were also excluded if animal models of fore-\nbrain or global ischemia were used and if the data\nwere presented in a way not suitable for meta-analysis.\nData-extraction and outcome assessment\nThe following data were, if available, extracted from\nthe included studies: author, year of publication, jour-\nnal, country, language, title; species, strain, sex, weight,\nage and number of animals used; excluded animals and\nreasons of exclusion; type of anaesthetic; method of\nischaemia induction, duration of ischaemia; method\nand duration of temperature monitoring; induced or\nspontaneous hyperthermia; time, duration, and\nmethod of hyperthermia induction; level of hyperther-\nmia; definition of normothermia, method of maintain-\ning normothermia; time of animal sacrifice; infarct size,\nfunctional outcome, mortality, and cerebral oedema,\nmethod of assessment of the outcomes; administration\nof additional medication or therapies; the ten points of\nthe CAMARADES quality checklist \u00ad see below.\nStudy quality was assessed according to the\nCAMARADES quality checklist with 10 points in\ntotal: (1) peer-reviewed publication; (2) statement of\ncontrol of temperature; (3) use of animals with\nco-morbidities; (4) use of anaesthetic without promi-\nnent intrinsic neuroprotective abilities; (5) reporting\nof sample size calculation; (6) randomisation of treat-\nment allocation; (7) concealment of treatment alloca-\ntion; (8) blinded assessment of outcome; (9) statement\nof compliance with animal welfare regulations; and (10)\nstatement of possible conflicts of interest.12\nThe number of animals and the mean outcome and\nits standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) were\nextracted for each intervention and control group.\nIn the case if data were only presented graphically,\nexplicit values were requested from the authors. If\nunavailable, values were estimated by measurement\nfrom the graphs. Also, in cases where data required\nfor meta-analysis were not available from abstracts or\npublications, they were requested from the authors.\nStatistical analysis\nNormalised mean difference was used as the effect size.\nThe effect size, SE, and 95% confidence interval (95%)\nwere calculated for each comparison. In case of serial\ninfarct sizes or neurobehavioral outcomes in the same\ngroup of animals, the effect size of the last observation\nwas used for meta-analysis. If one normothermia group\nwas compared to multiple hyperthermia groups, the\namount of animals in the normothermia group was\ndivided by the amount of hyperthermic groups. By\nmeans of the inverse variance method, weighted effect\nsizes were calculated for each comparison, with greater\nweight for more precise studies with smaller standard\nerrors. All effect sizes were pooled by means of the\nrandom effects model instead of the fixed effects\nmodel, because of anticipated heterogeneity between\nstudies. The amount of heterogeneity between studies\nwas estimated by means of I2 and Cochran's Q.13,14\nA stratified analysis was performed for the following\npre-specified study characteristics to assess their impact\non the overall effect size: level of hyperthermia, dura-\ntion of hyperthermia, start of induction of hyperther-\nmia in relation to the onset of ischaemia, method of\nischaemia induction, duration of ischaemia, strain, and\nsex; and study quality items, focusing on randomisa-\ntion and blinding. Significance was assessed by Chi-\nsquare statistic of the residual heterogeneity with n\u00c01\ndegrees of freedom (df). To allow for multiple compar-\nisons, we adjusted our significance level using\nBonferroni correction to a critical value of p < 0.004\n2 European Stroke Journal 0(0)\nfor each comparison of infarct volume.

Monitoring of temperature during\nthe experiment occurred by measuring the temperature\n(n \u00bc 2).31,32 The median temperature during hyperther-\nstart of hyperthermia was 0 min, i.e. at the onset of\nduration of induced hyperthermia was 120 min\n(range: 30\u00ad270 min) and the median time to infarct\nstudies performing temperature measurements between\nthese two moments. By contrast, three of the four stud-\nies which assessed the effects of a spontaneous rise in\nbody temperature after focal ischaemia provided infor-\nmation on body temperature until animal sacrifice\n(median 48 h). In addition, none of these four\nstudies reported on the occurrence of infections as a\npotential cause of the `spontaneous' increase in body\ntemperature.\nEffect of hyperthermia on outcomes\nHyperthermia increased infarct size by 43.4% (95% CI,\nheterogeneity in the estimates of efficacy between the\nP < 10\u00c043).

This\nhypothesis is currently tested in the phase III trial\nPRECIOUS: PREvention of Complications to Improve\nOUtcome in elderly patients with acute Stroke. This trial\nassesses whether prevention of aspiration, infections, or\nfever with metoclopramide, ceftriaxone, paracetamol, or\nany combination of these in elderly patients with a mod-\nerately severe to severe acute stroke is more effective at\nimproving functional outcome than current clinical prac-\ntice of waiting until these complications are manifest\nbefore initiating treatment.39\nThe results of this meta-analysis do not provide\nextensive information on the relationship between the\ntiming of hyperthermia and outcome in animals.\nAlmost all studies induced hyperthermia within the\nfirst hours after MCA occlusion, and maintained\nhigher temperatures for a median of just 2 h. The\nsingle study that delayed the induction of hyperthermia\nto 24 h after the onset of ischaemia demonstrated a\ndetrimental effect of an increase in body temperature\nThree of the four studies that assessed the effects of\nthe spontaneous increase in body temperature after\nfocal ischaemia performed temperature measurements\nuntil animal sacrifice. Temperatures generally remained\nelevated during the first 24 h, with apparent normal-\nbody temperatures have been observed in almost\n10% of the patients after one week, and the relation\nbetween hyperthermia and poor outcome or larger\ninfarct size persisted for up to one week.8,9\nThere are several proposed mechanisms by which\nhyperthermia enlarges infarct size, including enhanced\nneurotoxic neurotransmitter release,40,41 blood-brain\nbarrier breakdown,42 increased radical production,43\nincreased metabolism44 and increased inflammation.45\nIn our meta-analysis, we found a modest difference in\nthe increase in infarct size between temporary ischemia\nand permanent ischemia. In rats with temporary ische-\nmia, hyperthermia could increase the infarct core\nbefore revascularisation or reduce the potential for\nrecovery of penumbral tissue despite adequate reperfu-\nsion. This has also recently been suggested in patients\nwith ischaemic stroke, in whom fever after successful\nmechanical thrombectomy was associated with larger\nThe current meta-analysis has limitations. There\nwas considerable heterogeneity between the included\nstudies and funnel plotting and Egger regression sug-\ngested publication bias. For these reasons, the overall\npooled effect size should be interpreted with caution.\nFurthermore, no study reported body temperatures in\nthe period between cessation of induced hyperthermia\nand animal sacrifice. Since the median duration of\nhyperthermia was 2 h, and the median duration until\nsacrifice was 24 h, there is a considerable time window\nin which spontaneous hyperthermia could have\noccurred in any experimental group.

Finally, we limited our\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5. Assessment of publication bias. (a) Funnel plot of the\nstudies on infarct size.
