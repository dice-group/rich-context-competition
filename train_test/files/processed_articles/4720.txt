The European Commission now plays a central role in\nthe European Semester, the EU's annual economic and fiscal policy coordination\ncycle. As fiscal and economic supervisor, the Commission wields significant discre-\ntion in assessing imbalances in member states' budgets and economies, and issues\nCountry-Specific Recommendations (CSRs) to address the risks stemming from\nSeikel, 2016). CSRs drafted by the Commission must be endorsed by the\nCouncil, but the scope for amendment is restricted as this requires a qualified\nmajority of votes (QMV) and is subject to the so-called `comply or explain' prin-\nciple. Both the scope and substance of EU interference in national economies and\nbudgets have been heavily criticised for the strong focus on social retrenchment, or\nausterity, over social investment (e.g. Blyth, 2013), or `capacitating social policies\n[. . .] that aim to maximise the returns on social expenditures in the form of active\nemployment and social participation' (Kersbergen et al., 2014).\nMore fundamentally, the legitimacy of this system of economic governance and\nthe issuing of CSRs is further complicated by a context of tangible politicisation of\nEuropean integration: `the growing salience of European governance, involving a\npolarisation of opinion, and an expansion of actors and audiences engaged in\nmonitoring EU affairs' (De Wilde et al., 2016: 4). European integration in\ngeneral has gradually become a key issue in political conflicts along a transnational\ncleavage structure (Hooghe and Marks, 2018). This has, in turn, been integrated\ninto existing national political conflict structures in country- and time-specific\nways, and conflicts over the EU may flare up when politicised by domestic\nactors (Kriesi, 2016). Domestic political parties, especially the Eurosceptic extreme\nleft and right, now explicitly profile on EU issues (Meijers, 2017; Meijers and Rauh,\n2016). Citizens more deliberately vote for parties with strong pro- or anti-EU\nplatforms and voice concerns over further integration in referendums\n(e.g. Brexit). The crisis has in itself also increased the salience of EU economic\ngovernance and eroded trust in EU institutions, further fuelling support for\nEurosceptic parties (Baglioni and Hurrelmann, 2016; Hobolt and De Vries,\n2016). Overall, the economic crisis has greatly increased the visibility of the EU,\nand the legitimacy of its system of economic governance is strongly contested.\nThe Semester thus tasks a powerful but politically conscious Commission with\nissuing sensitive recommendations to member state governments, while the role of\nthe EU in the lives of its citizens is frequently questioned and politicised by domes-\ntic-level actors. Despite this, research has paid little attention to the consequences\nof such moments of `constraining dissensus' (Hooghe and Marks, 2009) for the\nfunctioning of EU economic governance. Academic scholarship on the Semester\nhas mostly focussed on the Semester's (im)balance between social and economic\nvan der Veer and Haverland 525\nits capacity for policy learning (Dunlop and Radaelli, 2016; Zeitlin, 2016) and the\nimplementation of CSRs by member states (Deroose and Griesse, 2014).\nOnly Baerg and Hallerberg (2016) have studied the political determinants of\nCSR amendments in the Council, finding that political power and public\nEuroscepticism are strong determinants of successful weakening by member\nstates of recommendations in the Council. Moreover, there are only a few studies\non the influence of the politicisation of European integration on specific EU policy\nareas (e.g. see Rauh, 2016), and none on the stage of the implementation of com-\nmunity policy by EU actors. Our study contributes to the literature on economic\ngovernance by extending the focus to include the effects of politicisation and\ndomestic politics on the supranational implementation of community policy.\nSimultaneously, it responds to calls in the literature on the politicisation of\nEuropean integration and on public support for the EU to extend the treatment\nof these phenomena from dependent to explanatory variables, in order to uncover\nhow they might act as constraints on European governance, and with what\nconsequences for the efficiency and legitimacy of the EU (Hobolt and De Vries,\nWe draw on theories of bureaucratic responsiveness to risk and stakeholder\npreferences to pull these literature streams together and examine the extent to\nwhich the politicisation of European integration (hereafter: `politicisation')\naffects the way the Commission interprets its mandate as macroeconomic\nsupervisor. Using data on all CSRs formulated by the Commission since the\nintroduction of the Semester in 2011, we reveal a positive relationship between a\nmember state's level of politicisation and the scope of recommendations\ntargeting that country as formulated by the Commission. We also find that\npoliticisation affects these recommendations in more substantive terms, with\nhigher levels of country-specific politicisation resulting in fewer CSRs that advo-\ncate social investment. Here, we have purposefully only analysed Commission\nbehaviour in the form of the CSRs proposed. As noted earlier, these may still\nbe amended by the Council, but our analysis does not extend to CSRs in the\nform they are finally issued to national governments (cf. Baerg and Hallerberg,\nThe Commission as a responsive regulator:\nRisk and reputation\nEuropean economic integration has always been a story of mutual gains through\nincreased cooperation, although stronger interdependence also increases cross-\nborder economic risks. A common currency reduces cross-border trade barriers,\nbut also creates new risks for member states as they lose the ability to adjust their\nexchange rates to protect their economies (Lane, 2012). The Semester grants the\nCommission a number of policy tools to regulate cross-border fiscal and economic\nrisks, of which the CSRs are a comprehensive output that streamlines recommen-\ndations stemming from different measures into a single country-specific document.\nRisk management by national regulators has been well studied, and the resulting\ntheories offer insights into the way regulatory agencies employ their discretion\nduring policy implementation to respond to external pressures (Alon-Barkat and\nthat regulators aiming to manage the ever-growing number of risks to society face\ninstitutional risks as a by-product of their efforts. Issues rarely fit the regulatory\nframeworks that these actors develop, and regulators are dependent on complex\ninstitutional regimes making success difficult to achieve. Consequently, regulators\nhave only a limited impact on the management of societal risks, and `the difficulty\nin satisfying conflicting demands on regulation, therefore, creates institutional risks\nthat can threaten the legitimacy of regulatory organisations and their practices\nRegulators employ various risk-management strategies depending on which type\nof risk they perceive to be the most threatening. Those mostly concerned with soci-\netal risk simply make decisions by weighing the impacts of societal risks against\nthe likelihood that they occur (Black and Baldwin, 2012). For example, financial\nregulators will weigh up the societal impact of the insolvency of major financial\nintermediaries against the likelihood that such insolvency occurs, and then direct\nattention and resources accordingly. In other situations, they may be more concerned\nwith institutional risks. These are specific risks to the institutional position of\nthe regulator, rather than to society, and stem from developments that may\nweaken a regulator's future institutional position (Gilad, 2012). By signalling incom-\npetence, regulatory failure may ultimately weaken an actor's institutional position.\nSimilarly, regulators that ignore the preferences of their institutional overseers may\nface institutional repercussions. Consequently, institutional risk-sensitive regulators\nwill prioritise tasks and allocate resources to mitigate such institutional risks which\nare inherent to the job of regulating risks to society (Rothstein, 2006).\nIn safeguarding its institutional position, a regulator's reputation is a vital asset.\nStronger reputations result in greater discretion and autonomy (Carpenter and\nKrause, 2012), whereas a poor regulatory reputation may lead to a repeal of\ndelegated competences or budget cuts. However, this regulatory reputation\ndepends largely on the audience who, through interaction with the regulator,\nconstructs it (Carpenter, 2010). It is the audience's assessment of a regulator's efficacy,\nexpertise and legitimacy that shapes the regulator's reputation. Reputation-sensitive\nregulators will seek to safeguard and enhance this audience's positive judgement, and\nthe (un)responsiveness to external signals will be guided by the regulator's institutio-\nnalised organisational identity (Gilad, 2015). Recent research into how regulators\ncope with reputational threats, and the institutional risk they face as a result of\nthese, has found that they are responsive to public allegations of regulatory failure\npolitical intervention (Gilad, 2015) and media attention (Maor and Sulitzeanu-\nvan der Veer and Haverland 527\nIn line with this, we would expect politicisation to be an institutional risk that\nwarrants a response, i.e. a visible shift in the risk management strategy of a com-\npetence-seeking Commission. As politicisation increases the visibility of the\nCommission's behaviour and broadens its audiences, it effectively moves the imple-\nmentation of community policy from `business as usual' to `implementation under\npressure'. When the level of politicisation is low, we would expect the Commission\nto be chiefly concerned with managing economic and fiscal (i.e. societal) risks.\nAs politicisation increases, we would expect the Commission's sensitivity to insti-\ntutional risks, and thus to external signals, to increase. Two previous studies that\nhave investigated this relationship offer support to this notion in that they found\nthat politicisation can affect the way individual Commission officials conceive the\nrole of their institution in the wider process of European integration (Bes, 2017)\nand may lead the Commission to be responsive to a broader set of societal\nstakeholders when drafting EU policy (Rauh, 2016).\nThis leads us to our first, and central, expectation: that higher levels of domestic\npoliticisation, and the institutional risks they pose, affect the Commission's behav-\niour as economic supervisor. When politicisation is low, the Commission is likely to\nuse the CSRs in line with their original intention \u00ad as tools to manage the economic\nand fiscal risks in individual member states. As levels of country-specific politicisa-\ntion increase, the Commission will seek to preserve its regulatory reputation by\nsignalling key audiences, thus visibly differentiating in its treatment of member\nstates where levels of politicisation are higher. Societal risk remains a key driver\nin CSR formulation, but institutional risk management is now of primary concern.\nDespite their heuristic value, theories of risk responsiveness fail to offer context-\nspecific hypotheses. Nevertheless, we can argue that politicisation may make it\nmore difficult for the Commission to bolster its reputation as its legitimacy has\ntraditionally been output-based (Schmidt, 2013) and it has to constantly reinterpret\nits mandate according to signals from key stakeholders (Rauh, 2016). The unique\ncharacter of the Semester also creates additional institutional risks since the\nCommission issues invasive recommendations to the very entities that collectively\ndecide its future institutional position. Not only may the Council collectively decide\nto repeal competences, but individual regulatees may also seek opt-outs from\nCommission supervision. Politicisation increases the likelihood of such undermin-\ning of the Commission's authority, not least because transfers of authority to the\nEU are a primary cause of the politicisation of European integration, with\nEurosceptic actors being keen to reframe such transfers as `losses of sovereignty'\nIn formulating observable implications for strategic Commission behaviour, we\nfollow Rauh's (2016) approach and identify the key stakeholders, or audiences,\nthat observe the Commission as it issues CSRs. The Semester has two categories of\nstakeholders: endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous stakeholders are the individ-\nual member state governments, i.e. the recipients of CSRs, and the Council, that is\nthe member state governments collectively, from which the Commission receives its\nmandate to issue CSRs. These stakeholders are already involved structurally in the\nprocess leading up to the issuing of CSRs, with numerous points of interaction\nbetween the Commission, member state governments and the Council. However,\nwhen country-specific levels of politicisation change, so will the internal dynamics\nof the Semester, and the signals received by the Commission. For example, as\nBaerg and Hallerberg (2016) argue, country-specific increases in Euroscepticism\nstrengthen the bargaining positions of national government vis-a\n` -vis the\nCommission during CSR adoption in the Council.\nExogenous stakeholders, or the wider audiences that observe the Commission's\nactions in EU economic governance, are `the people' and `the markets' (Schmidt,\n2014; Streeck, 2014). The `people' consist of national and European electorates,\ninterest groups and civil society, a public which is mostly fragmented along national\nborders. Together with national political parties, the `people' form the locus where\npoliticisation occurs: it is to this audience that Commission action has become more\nsalient, and its response has been to polarise and mobilise. The `markets' comprise\nglobally operating actors, such as investors, pension funds, traders and bankers.\nThis audience is predominantly concerned with economic and fiscal risks in\nmember states: it seeks economic stability, as epitomised in the economic agendas\nof austerity and market deregulation, and the continuation of economic growth.\nUnder `business as usual', a Commission focus on economic risk will appease the\n`markets' and leave the `people' indifferent. However, as country-specific levels of\npoliticisation increase, the `people' will increasingly gain clout as a stakeholder in the\nimplementation of community policy \u00ad increasing the pressure on the Commission to\nlimit the unpopular austerity measures and create more widely dispersed social\nand economic benefits (Rauh, 2016). Given these divergent preferences, increasing\npoliticisation implies that it is becoming extremely difficult for the Commission to\nsimultaneously appease the `people' and calm the `markets'.\nHere, we propose two sets of competing hypotheses for Commission responsive-\nness to increasing levels of country- and time-specific politicisation, and by exten-\nsion to institutional risk, that address both the scope and the substance of the\nCSRs proposed by the Commission. The first set assumes a Commission that is\nmainly concerned with mitigating domestic public opposition to EU (economic)\ngovernance. Seeking to appease the `people', we assume the Commission to avoid\npurposefully fuelling further politicisation in its member states. Here, we would\nfirst expect the Commission to minimise the scope of its recommendations, as fewer\nrecommendations imply less European interference in a country's domestic affairs.\nSecond, when CSRs are issued, we predict a larger relative share to recommend\nsocial investment, as opposed to unpopular austerity measures or social retrench-\nment, in countries with relatively high levels of politicisation.\nH1a: Member states with higher levels of domestic politicisation will receive fewer\nCSRs from the Commission.\nH1b: The CSRs received by member states with higher levels of domestic politi-\ncisation will contain a higher proportion of recommendations for social\ninvestment.\nvan der Veer and Haverland 529\nThe second set of hypotheses assumes a Commission that is also concerned with the\ninstitutional risk posed to itself by politicisation and responds by `entrenching'.\nSince regulatory favouritism will harm the Commission's reputation as a credible\nfiscal and economic watchdog, it may anticipate and avoid the political and eco-\nnomic backlash that might result from giving into politicised member states.\nInstead, in order to secure its reputation as an unwavering `guardian of the mar-\nkets', it may seek to send a strong signal of regulatory resolve, and independence\nfrom political influence, to other member states, the Council and the `markets'.\nAn important aspect is that the Commission still speaks to the `people' of other\nmember states, i.e. signalling to German voters that it is not favouring Spanish\nvoters or vice versa. We expect this scenario to have two observable implications.\nFirst, because successfully signalling regulatory commitment to economic objectives\nand political independence necessarily implies sending a strong signal, we expect the\nCommission to issue more recommendations in response to country- and time-specific\nincreases in politicisation. Substantively, we expect an `entrenched' Commission to\n`retreat' to a position where its mandate is strongest in order to signal regulatory\ncompetence. Three features of CSRs suggest that entrenchment will reduce the\nrelative share of CSRs recommending social investment issued to politicised\nmember states (cf. Zeitlin and Vanhercke, 2018). These are: that recommendations\non economic and fiscal objectives enjoy a stronger legal basis; that they stem from\nexplicit procedures (the Macroeconomic Imbalance and Excessive Deficit Procedures)\nunderpinned by detailed protocols; and that they are backed up by the possibility of\nsanctions. While individual regulatees may object if the Commission signals resolve\ntoo strongly, a simultaneous entrenchment towards a stronger mandate can shield it\nfrom such a critique.\nH2a: Member states with higher levels of domestic politicisation will receive more\nCSRs from the Commission.\nH2b: The CSRs received by member states with higher levels of domestic politi-\ncisation will contain a lower proportion of recommendations for social\ninvestment.\nData and methods\nWe test these hypotheses using an original data set of CSRs formulated by the\nanalyse CSRs as formulated by the Commission before the Council has had the\nopportunity to alter or adopt them. Greece is not included as it was subject to\nMacroeconomic Adjustment Programmes (MAPs) for the entire observed period\nand did not receive any CSRs.1 Cyprus, Ireland, Latvia, Portugal and Romania\nwere subject to MAPs for one or more years and therefore did not receive CSRs in\nthese years. These and other missing values were handled through listwise deletion.\nThe final sample contained 169 observations (country-years).\nOur first outcome variable, the scope of CSRs, is measured as the number of\nwords used in formulating the substantive recommendations. This measure more\nadequately captures the scope of CSRs than simple recommendation counts since\nboth the `number and level of detail of the recommendations reflect the scale of the\nchallenges each Member State faces' (European Commission, 2015). In this, we\nonly `captured' the CSRs themselves, and excluded the background and rationales\nprovided in CSR documentation. We use a natural log transformed metric to\nreduce positive skew and high-end outliers, and aid interpretation (Gelman and\nWe use topic modelling, specifically latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to\nestimate the policy topics that most prominently feature in individual recommen-\ndations, adhering to the numbering in CSR documentation. As a class of Bayesian\ngenerative models, LDA models assume documents consist of multiple topics, and\nassume the terms in these documents to be a function of the presence or absence of\na given topic (Blei, 2012; Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). After estimating the optimal\nnumber of topics, extracting and qualitatively validating them, we then identify\nthose topics for which the CSRs specifically and explicitly recommend social invest-\nment over social retrenchment. Our second outcome variable captures the propor-\ntion of `social' topics in the average recommendation in a given country-year (see\nthe Online appendix for details).\nAll predictor variables that follow are lagged: that is, they are measured three to\neight months before the Commission formulates CSRs.2 This lag ensures that\nour predictors precede our outcome. Given the difficulties of constructing\ncountry-specific measures for salience and mobilisation, we operationalise our\nmain predictor, politicisation, as the level of polarisation in citizen's opinions on\nthe EU. Following Rauh (2016), we measure polarisation as the kurtosis of\nthe distribution of citizen opinions on the EU, as calculated from the weighted\nindividual-level responses to the Autumn Eurobarometer item: `In general, does the\nEU conjure up for you a very positive, fairly positive, neutral, fairly negative or\nvery negative image?'. Kurtosis is a measure of the `heaviness' of the tails of the\ndistribution of opinions: lower values indicate more observations are further from\nthe mean and thus indicate stronger polarisation.3\nAs politicisation requires active political entrepreneurs who successfully mobil-\nise the public on salient constitutive issues and a polarised public opinion (Hooghe\nand Marks, 2018; Hutter et al., 2016), we also include a dichotomous variable that\ncaptures whether a member state's political system includes a successful\nEurosceptic challenger party that holds one or more seats in parliament. We\nused the 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) to identify political parties\nscoring below four on a seven-point pro-integration scale (Bakker et al., 2015).\nRay (2007) showed that parties scoring below four in the CHES data could be\nclassified as either `soft' or `hard' Eurosceptic and we followed this reasoning.\nThe differentiated political power of member states has always been an import-\nant factor in EU decision making, and this affects a member state's chances\nof having CSRs weakened in the Council (e.g. Baerg and Hallerberg, 2016;\nvan der Veer and Haverland 531\nHa\nas the voting power of a member state in the Council, using the Shapley-Shubik\nmember state is pivotal in turning a losing coalition into a winning one and are\nwidely used in the literature on legislative bargaining (Hix and H\u00f8yland, 2011).\nCroatia is not included in the index, meaning that a country's estimated power may\nWe rely on the main scoreboard indicators of the Macroeconomic Imbalance\nProcedure (MIP) to identify the main reason why the Commission would have\nformulated CSRs, i.e. the level of economic and fiscal risk in a member state.\nEach indicator is accompanied by an indicative threshold, which serves the\nCommission as a heuristic device to detect possible imbalances. For each indicator,\nwe create a dichotomous measure that indicates whether a member state is in\nbreach of the indicative threshold in a given year.4 We acknowledge that, in prac-\ntice, the formulation of CSRs is a highly complex and interactive process that\nnecessarily requires a sophisticated reading of the scoreboard indicators, and\nthat they are by no means applied mechanistically (European Commission,\n2016). Nor is it our intention to outguess the Commission's assessment of\nthese imbalances. Nevertheless, given the complexities of numerically assessing\nthe economic or fiscal stance of a country, relying on breaches of these thresholds\nprovides us with the most valid control variables possible, and covers the full\nbreadth of fiscal and economic imbalances. The data for these indicators are\ntaken from Eurostat. At the time of writing, data for indicators on private sector\ndebt, credit flow and financial sector liabilities were not available for 2016.\nTo prevent a total rejection of all 2017 observations, these indicators were not\nincluded in the models. We include a final dichotomous measure for a country's\nmembership of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), since membership\ncreates additional interdependencies between and additional obligations for\nmember states and increases their exposure to imbalances in other EMU countries.\nFinally, we control for three additional political factors that may influence the\nCommission's formulation of recommendations. First, if the Commission is\nresponsive to polarisation, it may also be sensitive to the electoral cycle in a\ngiven member state. We therefore measure the closeness of elections as the\nnumber of months until the next election from the month in which CSRs are\npublished. Further, the formulation of CSRs by the Commission may be affected\nby whether a member state's government is economically left- or right-oriented,\nand whether it is opposed to or supportive of European integration. We capture the\nformer by taking the governing party's position on a 10-point left\u00adright scale from\nthe parliaments and governments database (ParlGov) by Do\n\u00a8 ring and Manow\n(2016) and create a weighted measure for coalition governments. We use the\nsame approach to measure government positions on European integration using\nthe seven-point anti-pro integration scale from the 2014 CHES item mentioned\nearlier. A complete overview of predictors, including the MIP indicators and their\nindicative thresholds, and descriptive statistics is provided in the Online appendix.\nMoreover, all predictor variables are grand-mean centred to aid interpretability,\nand the continuous predictor variables are standardised by two standard devi-\nations, placing them on a scale that is effectively bound between zero and one\nWe employ a series of fixed slope, random intercept multilevel models that\naccount for the nested and cross-classified nature of the data (Schmidt-Catran\nand Fairbrother, 2016). Models with the prefix A use the log-transformed word\ncount as an outcome, whereas models with prefix B indicate models that instead use\nthe proportion of CSRs advocating social investment. In all cases, model 0 is the\nbaseline model. Model 1 predicts the outcome using the MIP indicators, EMU\nmembership and political power. Following this, model 2 subsequently introduces\nour main predictors of interest related to the politicisation of European integration.\nModel 3 adds the remaining political control variables. These final models are\nspecified as follows:\nyijk\nPolitical poweri \u00fe 02\nEMU membershipi\nMIP1i \u00fe \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1\nGovt: anti-pro EUi\nGovt: left-righti \u00fe \"i\nand:\njk\n\u00bc \nwhere yijk\nis the outcome for the ith observation; the intercept jk\nis allowed to vary\nby country j and by year k.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) derived from the null models stat-\nistically support the use of cross-classified multilevel models as 83.7% of the total\nvariance in the scope of CSRs stems from differences between countries (31.4%) or\nyears (52.3%).5 For the models predicting the proportion of `social' CSRs, 25.2%\nof the total variance stems from differences between countries, and none from\ndifferences between years. Table 1 presents the model fit statistics for the\nspecified models. The v2 tests indicate that the fit significantly increases from\nmodel A0 to model A1, and that model A2 only marginally fails to cross conven-\nwhich is not surprising given that many MIP indicators fail to cover imbalances\nthat are directly related to recommendations on social investment. The fit signifi-\ncantly improves by adding politicisation in model B2. Adding the remaining pol-\nitical control variables (in models A3 and B3) did not improve the fit for either\noutcome variable. For both outcomes, collinearity issues between indicators of\nyouth and long-term unemployment rates warranted the exclusion of the latter\n(r \u00bc 0.719).6 No modelling assumptions were violated in any of the models pre-\nsented below.\nvan der Veer and Haverland 533\nResults\nTable 2 shows the estimation results when using the scope of the CSRs issued by\nthe Commission as the outcome variable. As the outcome variable is measured on a\nlog scale, the coefficient estimates indicate the multiplicative change in the scope of\nCSRs for a one-unit change in a predictor while all other predictors remain at their\ngrand means. Standard errors for the estimates are given in parentheses.\nExponentiated coefficients are provided for the final model (A4) to aid substantive\ninterpretation.\nOur results support H2a, and by extension fail to support H1a, in that member\nstates with higher domestic levels of polarisation do receive more CSRs from the\nCommission. That is, the Commission issues more recommendations to member\nstates who have higher levels of politicisation. Holding all the other predictors at\ntheir grand mean values, a one-unit increase in the kurtosis of the distribution of\ncitizen opinions on the EU, which implies a significantly more consensual view of\nthe EU, is associated with a 16.5% decrease in the scope of the CSRs. This change\nis equivalent to the difference in country means between France (\u00c00.46) and Malta\n(0.25). As such, the Commission is responsive to polarisation when it drafts CSRs\nand increases the scope of its recommendations when faced with more polarised\npublic opinions of the EU. However, the presence of a Eurosceptic challenger party\nin a national parliament does not affect the scope of CSRs.\nAdding the political control variables to the model yields additional interesting\nresults. First, the measure for the political power of a member state offers a reliable\nestimate that indicates that politically more powerful member states receive more\nrecommendations. A one-unit increase in voting power is related to a 32.1%\nincrease in the scope of CSRs proposed by the Commission. This change in pol-\nitical power in the Council is roughly comparable to the difference between Malta\nTable 1.

Multilevel models for the scope of Country-Specific Recommendations (CSRs).\n(continued)\nvan der Veer and Haverland 535\nneither the domestic electoral cycle nor the government's position on the EU\nand its economic preferences influence the quantity of recommendations they\nreceive from the Commission. These findings are robust under varying model spe-\ncifications, including those that include the originally omitted MIP scoreboard\nHallerberg (2016) who found that Euroscepticism and political power significantly\naffect CSR amendments, but found no relationship between amendments and the\nremaining political measures.\nCSRs are formally meant to address economic and fiscal imbalances in member\nstates, and a number of the estimates for the MIP scoreboard indicators support this\nnotion. Member states in breach of the indicative threshold for net international\ninvestment position (NIIP), which are in effect in debt to other EU member states,\nreceive 80.1% more recommendations from the Commission. Similarly, member\nstate governments with a gross debt exceeding 60% of gross domestic product\n(GDP) can expect a 47.2% increase in the number of issued recommendations.\nFurther, member states exceeding the unemployment rate threshold receive 18.2%\nmore recommendations. Surprisingly, member states experiencing current account\nimbalances receive 12.7% fewer recommendations. Breaches of the indicative\nthresholds for the other scoreboard indicators do not appear to lead to more, or\nfewer, recommendations. Finally, additional obligations and interdependencies\nresulting from Eurozone membership have no observable effect on CSR issuance.\nGiven these findings, it is clear that the management of cross-border risks to other\nEU member states, and to the wider EU economy, is the dominant rationale behind\nthe Commission's issuing of recommendations to member states.\nTable 3 presents our second set of cross-classified models using the relative\nproportion of recommendations advocating social investment against austerity or\nTable 2.

Here, the results support H2b, that a\nsmaller share of the CSRs received by member states with higher domestic levels\nof polarisation will recommend social investment. By extension, H1b is weakened,\ngiven that the Commission does not issue more recommendations on social invest-\nment to member states with high levels of polarisation. Rather, a one-unit increase\nin kurtosis, again indicating a more consensual public view of the EU, is associated\nwith a rise of 5.4 percentage points in the proportion of `social' recommendations\nwhen all other predictors are held at their grand means. The other political indi-\ncators tested do not appear to have any meaningful relationship to the outcome of\ninterest here. In our final model, only one MIP indicator is significantly related to\nthe share of social recommendations: a breach of the indicative threshold for the\nHouse Price Index is associated with a 4.9 percentage point decrease in the pro-\nportion of recommendations advocating social investment. This finding is surpris-\ning, given that the proportion of recommendations related to social investment\ntends not to be influenced by breaches of most of the MIP indicators. These\nfindings are robust for different model specifications and varying demarcations\nof the category for recommendations advocating `social investment'.\nTo summarise, our statistical evidence indicates that, typically, member states\nreceive more extensive recommendations from the Commission when: (a) their\ndomestic public opinion on the EU is more polarised; (b) they wield more political\npower in the Council; (c) they are in breach of the indicative thresholds for the\nNIIP, government debt or unemployment rate indicators; and/or (d) they are not\nbreaching the current account balance indicator. In terms of the substance of\nCSRs, a smaller proportion of the recommendations that a member state receives\nrelate to social investment when domestic public opinion is more polarised or when\nit is breaching the MIP indicator for the House Price Index. Although neither\nmodel allows us to claim causality, there is some evidence against an endogeneity\nbias that is that the characteristics of the recommendations emanating from\nTable 3. Continued.\nBrussels fuel further Euroscepticism amongst EU citizens. The fact that the annual\nmeans for polarisation levels across the EU member states rose from \u00c00.03 in\n\u00c00.04 in 2015 \u00ad runs counter to an endogeneity bias being present. In conclusion,\nthe evidence provided here offers credibility to the argument that increasing pol-\niticisation influences the Commission's application of economic and fiscal surveil-\nlance measures.\nConclusions and discussion\nIn this study, we have investigated to what extent the politicisation of European\nintegration affects the implementation of EU community policy. We have approached\nthis topic by examining the issuance of CSRs by the European Commission. We\nargued that the Commission, while using CSRs to regulate the economic and fiscal\nrisks in EU member states, is also responsive to the institutional risks posed by the\npoliticisation within them when it interprets its mandate as the EU's economic and\nfiscal supervisor. Based on two possible alternative responses by the Commission to\nthis institutional risk, we offered two sets of competing hypotheses that varied in terms\nof the exogenous stakeholder, or audience, in whose eyes the Commission would be\nkeenest to preserve its reputation: `the people' or `the markets' (Schmidt, 2014;\nStreeck, 2014). After controlling for the relevant sources of economic and fiscal imbal-\nances in member states, we have shown that the Commission issues more CSRs to\nthose member states where public opinion on the EU is more polarised. This finding\nstrongly contradicts H1a. We also found some evidence that the Commission issues\nrelatively few recommendations that advocate social investment to member states with\nhigh levels of polarisation, which fails to support H1b. That is, recommendations\nissued to member states with high levels of politicisation are less likely to urge\nsocial investment. Both these findings indicate that the Commission does react to\nhigher levels of politicisation when it formulates and issues CSRs.\nMoreover, our findings provide empirical support for both hypotheses H2a and\nH2b, which anticipated that the Commission would act as the `guardian of the\nmarkets' in response to the institutional risk posed by politicisation at the domestic\nlevel. While our results do not allow us to draw definite conclusions regarding the\nintent behind this behaviour, we suggest that this response can best be explained as\na form of regulatory `entrenchment'. By increasing the scope of its CSRs for\ncountries with relatively high levels of politicisation, it sends a strong signal to\nother observing audiences of its regulatory resolve and political independence\nand reaffirms its reputation as a supranational `watchdog' that remains determined\nto execute the task it was delegated. Simultaneously, the Commission is also able to\nentrench by issuing CSRs on those issues where it has a stronger mandate, which\nexplains the greater focus on economic and fiscal objectives rather than social\nobjectives for those member states where politicisation is higher.\nvan der Veer and Haverland 539\nOur findings constitute important contributions to our understanding of the\nworkings of European economic governance. The EU's system of economic gov-\nernance has never been a technocratic process in which rules were applied mech-\nanistically, and political tinkering is often seen as a prerogative of member states\n2016). Our contribution has identified a key driver behind the use of discretion by\nthe European Commission, the main actor tasked with implementing these rules at\nthe EU level: the issuing of CSRs is a highly political process and, as such, is\nsusceptible to exogenous political forces. Our findings largely support those of\nBaerg and Hallerberg (2016) and indicate that politicisation processes not only\naffect individual actors, but also affect the wider inner workings of entire govern-\nance structures. Moreover, we have also shown that, in `speaking to the markets'\n(Schmidt, 2014), European actors do not only rely on discourse and symbolic\ngestures, they also instigate concrete action.\nFinally, we show that politicisation does not only have major consequences for\nthe evident stages of policy formulation and legislative bargaining (Hoeglinger,\nEuropean Commission in its role as the EU's economic and fiscal supervisor.\nOur findings on the Commission's `entrenchment' tie in with those of Bes\n`entrenching' behind a strong mandate. Bes (2017) found that increasing levels\nof politicisation push Commission officials towards acting on their mandate as\na `supranational bureaucracy' and becoming more pragmatic (and less policy\nentrepreneurial) in conceiving their institutional role. Rauh (2016) found that,\nunder its mandate as the initiator of EU legislation on consumer policy, politi-\ncisation pushes the Commission to be responsive to a broader set of societal\ninterests and hence to disperse societal policy outcomes that benefit a broader\nset of societal interests. In all these cases, `entrenchment' may shield\nthe Commission from scrutiny and may prevent the further fuelling of political\nconflict over EU issues at the domestic level.\nOur findings are subject to a number of limitations. First, although we have\nstudied Commission behaviour, this is only the starting point as CSRs may later\nbe amended in the Council. Second, the management of economic and fiscal risks\nposed to European societies remains the most important explanatory factor in\nwhy the Commission issues CSRs, so the importance of the politicisation effect\nshould not be overstated. We would also add that the insignificance of some of\nthe MIP scoreboard indicators should not be seen as implying that the\nCommission is neglecting the economic dimension when implementing CSRs.\nProperly assessing the economic and fiscal risks in EU member states is infinitely\nmore qualitative and complex than simply counting the breaches of indicative\nthresholds. In terms of capturing politicisation, we have focussed on polarisation\nand largely ignored both salience and mobilisation, in part because measuring the\nlatter aspects across 27 EU member states is both difficult and language-sensitive.\nOur proxy for salience and mobilisation, i.e. the presence of a Eurosceptic\nchallenger party, turned out to be a poor predictor of CSR characteristics, which\nsuggests that the presence of Eurosceptic parties in national parliaments does not\ninfluence CSR formulation.\nLastly, and linking our findings to those of Baerg and Hallerberg (2016), an\nalternative explanation for our results could be that the Commission increases the\nscope of its CSRs for powerful and politicised member states in anticipation of\nsuch countries diluting their recommendations in the Council. While our design\ndoes not allow us to draw definite conclusions on the relative merits of these\ncompeting explanations for our findings, we offer three reasons why we believe\nthe `entrenchment' argument put forward in this contribution is the more compel-\nling. First, Commission entrenchment could explain the responsiveness in terms of\nboth scope and substance, whereas Commission anticipation does not. Second, the\nalternative explanation would suggest the presence of an interaction effect between\nthe voting power and polarisation measures included in our analysis but, when\ntested, this effect was small and highly insignificant. Lastly, this alternative explan-\nation raises the problem of equifinality: while the Commission may be anticipating\namendments in the Council, the Council may equally be weakening the\nCommission's signals of entrenched regulatory resolve during the amendment pro-\ncess. Here, further research examining changes in inter-institutional dynamics\nunder increasing levels of politicisation should prove highly rewarding.\nThis study has provided initial evidence for the existence of a politicisation\neffect on the implementation of community policy in the EU and has shown\nthat the European Semester's recommendations are not solely the product of\nextensive and objective technical analysis. Grande and Kriesi (in Hutter et al.,\n2016) observe that politicisation is driven by the strategic attempts to politicise\nEuropean integration and the EU by domestic political actors. Our contribution\nextends this argument by showing that European actors are not necessarily\nidle or passive subjects of politicisation, but that they actively develop coun-\nter-strategies to respond to developments in their political context. Whether such\nstrategies will ultimately strengthen or harm the EU's fickle legitimacy remains\nto be seen.\n"
