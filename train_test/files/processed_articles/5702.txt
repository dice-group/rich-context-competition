    "reduced_content": "An Empirical Analysis\nfrom the Stakeholders'\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTukey's HSD\nincludes research articles\nthat focus on the analysis and\nresolution of managerial and\nacademic issues based on\nanalytical and empirical or\ncase research\nA business projects its financial performance through its financial statements. An\naudited financial statement is considered to be genuine and dependable by the stake-\nholders of the business. Therefore, statutory auditors should be self-regulating so that\nthey can perform their professional role without being influenced by the management.\nThe current regulatory framework for statutory auditors defines independence require-\nment for a statutory auditor in a professional engagement, points out circumstances\nthat may create threats to independence and also proposes some measures to safeguard\nthe same. However, in recent corporate accounting scandals, company's failure led to\ndevastating cost to the stakeholders, and audit failure was identified to be one of the\ncauses behind them. Following investigations also sensed possible impairment of statu-\ntory auditors' independence in those scams.\nIn this backdrop, based on the existing literature on this subject, this article identifies\nvariables influencing positively or negatively statutory auditors' independence in\ntheir professional engagement. Opinions of statutory auditors and select other groups\nof respondents were collected. Most of the respondent groups believe that statutory\nauditors fail to detect irregularities in financial books due to their lack of independence\nand professional scepticism as was observed in this study. Several legal case decisions also\nsupport this finding.Along association between a statutory auditor and a client is one of the\nmajor reasons behind statutory auditors' lack of independence. Opinions of respondents\nsupported by applicable legal case decisions also proved that lax disciplinary measures and\ninadequate inspection framework caused audit failures in many recent cases.\nThis study also analyses a significant difference of opinion among respondent groups\nand identifies the groups having a similar line of thought for each variable. One-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test\nwere conducted, respectively, for these purposes. The result shows that significant\ndifferences exist among the respondent groups for most of the variables. Moreover,\ncorporate executives have shown a significant difference of opinion from professional\naccountants, especially on the issue of statutory auditors' negligence. While corporate\nexecutives believe statutory auditors are negligent in their duty, professional accountants\noppose their views. Applicable legal case decisions also support such findings. Investors\nhave shown similar views in line with academicians and students.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nThe financial result of a business enterprise is\nprojected through its profit and loss account,\nbalance sheet and other financial reports\nprepared according to the applicable generally accepted\naccounting principles (Banerjee, 2002). Stakeholders\nof the business make their financial judgement based\non these statements. But sometimes immoral objec-\ntives of showing an inflated financial position lead the\nmanagement of a company to manoeuvre its finan-\ncial statement. It sometimes even calls for the compa-\nny's termination impacting most of its stakeholders.\nTherefore, the legitimacy and dependability of the\nfinancial statement should be certified by a proficient\nauthority external to the business enterprise. Statutory\nfinancial auditors carry out this role. They are profes-\nsional accountants appointed to check the financial\nstatement of the company and express their opinion on\nthe working affairs of the business (Gupta, 2005). Apart\nfrom being competent to do their job, they should be\nethical towards their professional obligation. Therefore,\nindependence of professional accountants serving\nas statutory auditors are of supreme importance to\nthe stakeholders who take financial decisions based\non their report. With a view to supporting statutory\nauditors to perform their responsibility with required\nintegrity and objectivity, governing regulatory bodies\nin a country issue certain regulatory pronouncements\n(Bakshi, 2000). In India, chartered accountants execute\nthe function of statutory financial auditors. With a view\nto ensuring their independent operation as statutory\nauditors and achieving quality audit from them, their\ngoverning regulatory bodies (e.g., Institute of Chartered\nAffairs, 2013; Securities Exchange Board of India,\n2013) issue certain regulations (e.g., Code of Ethics\nfor Professional Accountant, Standards on Auditing,\nStandard on Quality Control, Companies Act, 2013,\nand Listing Requirements) that clarify their independ-\nence requirement as a statutory auditor (Ghosh, 1999).\nHowever, even with the existence of a strong regulatory\nstructure, statutory audit failure has been witnessed in\nmost of the accounting scandals in different countries\n(e.g., Enron Corporation Ltd. and Parmalat SpA).\nStatutory auditors in those companies failed to identify\nand report accounting wrongdoing in the company's\nfinancial statement that resulted in the company's failure\naffecting the country's economy and a huge segment\nof society. Ensuing investigation also proved statutory\nauditors' close nexus with management in some of those\nscandals(Copeland,2005).AccountingscandalatSatyam\nwas a classic example of statutory audit failure due to a\nlack of independence (Banerjee, 2011). In this company,\nstatutory auditors certified inflated financial statement\nof the company as free from irregularities. They also\nfailed to detect control deficiencies. After the revelation\nof the scandal, it was proved in the court of law that\nstatutory auditors did not comply with the applicable\nindependence requirement and aided management\nto commit the accounting fraud (Central Bureau of\nInvestigation, Hyderabad vs Subramani Gopalakrishnan,\n2011). This had put a big question mark on the integrity\nof the accounting and auditing profession. In this\nbackdrop, this article seeks to analyse the perception of\nstatutory financial auditors and respondents from other\noccupational groups having knowledge on this issue.\nStatutory auditors' independence is a matter of huge\nsignificance in ensuring consistency and validity of\nfinancial statements prepared by a company's manage-\nment. However, recent corporate accounting scandals\nhave reflected statutory auditors' lack of judgement and\nscepticism in the audit of those companies. Following\ninvestigation also proved that statutory auditors were\nnot completely independent from the management in\nthose audit engagements. This situation brings about\na great deal of concern among notable researchers all\nover the world. Extensive research has been conducted\non this issue, causes behind the lack of independence of\nstatutory auditors have been identified, and solutions\nhave been proposed so that statutory auditors' inde-\npendence could be safeguarded for the protection of\nstakeholders' interest.\nAn auditor plays an important role in the validation\nof a financial statement. Integrity, objectivity, and\nindependence of a statutory auditor influence the\nutility of the financial statement (Saxena, 1993). As\nstakeholders take their financial decision based on\nthe judgement of the auditors (Chakraborty, 2004), the\nlatter should consider their interest with top precedence\nare an important segment of the entire corporate\ngovernance mechanism of the company (Garg, 2001).\nIn some studies, scholars provided a historical count of\nthe evolution of professionalism and independence of\nstatutory auditors (Freier, 2004). Several studies have\ncovered the stories of recent corporate accounting\nfrauds (Enron, Satyam, etc.) and proved statutory\nauditors' lack of independence in those scandals\naccounting scandal occurs because of a false financial\nstatement, auditors are considered to be one of the\nmain parties behind the fraud (Crutchley, Jensen,\nhave analysed different corporate accounting scam\ncases and identified several intimidation to statutory\nauditors' independence. The appointment procedure\n(Ghosh, 1999) and the provision of non-audit services\nexamples. We have reviewed several perception-based\nstudies that ratify the conceptual studies. Safeguards to\nthese threats offered by an audit client, profession or\naudit firm are also analysed in these studies (Fearnley,\nSome researchers have critically analysed the useful-\nness of the present regulation in protecting statutory\nauditors' independence (Chakrabarti, 1996; Narielvala,\nCompliance with applicable regulatory framework\nhelps a statutory auditor to gain public trust (Bakshi,\n2000). However, in some studies, it has been proved that\nthe present legal structure is insufficient to address the\nissue of statutory auditors' independence (Dastur, 1998;\nation in the current regulations and their appropriate\nexecution could protect statutory auditors' independ-\nence (Rao, 2009). Non-compliance with applicable regu-\nlations brings punitive measures against statutory audi-\ntors. Penal sanction against statutory auditors is diverse\nin different countries. However, the presence of a strong\ndisciplinary framework deters an auditor from compro-\nmising his/her independence (Bakshi, 2000). The enact-\nment of Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002, following the Enron\nscandal is considered to be a significant regulatory mile-\nstone in the history of statutory auditors' independence\n(Arens & Elder, 2006). Several perception-based studies\nhave been carried out on the effectiveness of SOX Act,\n2002. Subject to certain reservations, most of the authors\nhave concluded that this new Act is very effective in\nimproving statutory auditors' independence and corpo-\nrate governance structure of a company (Carillo, 2008;\nAfter the enactment of SOX Act, 2002, the importance\nof an oversight authority is deeply realized. Oversight\nbodies like Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (PCAOB) supervise audit operations in a country\nand decrease the scope of any possible nexus between\nstatutory auditors and management (Godbole, 2004).\nIn the present-day environment, when statutory auditors\nare extending their operations in global frontiers, several\nauthors have proposed the convergence of individual\ncode of ethics of the individual countries and the enact-\nment of a uniform code of conduct all over the world\nto help statutory auditors avoid any ethical dilemmas\nin cross-country audit engagements (Pendergast, 2002;\nApart from regulatory measures, another important\nsafeguard to statutory auditors' independence is the\naudit committee. It is an important board committee\nwith majority of members as independent directors and\nis responsible for controlling issues that have significant\ninfluence on statutory auditors' independent operations\n(Godbole, 2004). Therefore, independence of the audit\ncommittee from the management can go a long way\ntowards the effective implementation of independence\nrequirementforstatutoryauditors(Tipgos&Keefe,2004).\nExternal review of the audit work is another important\nsafeguard to statutory auditors' independence. An\nindependent third party makes a statutory auditor more\ncareful about his/her independence obligation. In India,\nit is known as the peer review process. Studies have also\ncompared external review in India with that of other\ncountries of the world (Gerotra & Baijal, 2002).\nAll these mechanisms discussed earlier in the article\nexternally influence statutory auditors' independ-\nence. But until the statutory auditors internally realize\nthe need for these independence obligations, effective\nresults cannot be obtained. Only ethics and values can\ninternally guide a person to attain a cherished result.\nTherefore, ethics has always remained an important\narea of research under this theme. Some researchers\nfocused on the concept of ethics, its evolution, and\ndifferent ethical concepts proposed by ethical leaders\nof our society (Duska, Duska, & Ragatz, 2011; Maurice,\n1996) while others conducted several perception-based\nstudies with advanced statistical tools to analyse ethical\ndilemmas faced by statutory auditors and the means to\nEvans, 1997). An ethical audit gives a statutory auditor\nenormous contentment which cannot be measured in\nmonetary terms (Chauhan & Gupta, 2007). However,\nin the present sociopolitical environment, ethics and\nvalues are incessantly decreasing not only in auditing\nprofession but in every sphere of our life (Ghosh,\nand cultural framework are the main reasons behind\nrecent ethical failures. Accounting regulators, business,\naudit firms, and academic institutes should work hand\nin hand to provide a moral framework for statutory\norientation of a person in this profession can get better\nonly through education, practical training, and orienta-\ntion programmes.\nSome authors affirmed that the present curriculum for\nprofessional accountants was not sufficient to improve\ntheir ethical orientation (Ravenscroft & Williams, 2004).\nTherefore, a complete modification of the accounting\ncourse was proposed with an emphasis on ethics (Arens\nGowthrope & Blake, 1998). Criminology, psychology,\nand other behavioural sciences should also come under\nthe purview of the current curriculum of professional\ncourses (Curtis, 2008). Based on different statistical\nmethods, the impact of an accounting scandal on the\nmoral thinking of prospective statutory auditors was\nalso analysed. It was thus found that practical training\non ethical needs would help statutory auditors to\nunderstand the regulations with a practical approach\nand to resolve their ethical dilemmas in professional\nIn recent times, researchers have identified some\nemerging areas in auditing that could play an impor-\ntant role in reducing accounting scandals. One such\narea is forensic audit where statutory auditors along\nwith experts from other professions investigate the\nfinancial misdeed by a company and propose solutions.\nForensic audit is also gaining importance in the current\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that researchers,\nwho have contributed their considerate opinion on this\nissue, identified specific threats and safeguards to stat-\nutory auditors' independence. Ethics and values are\nimportant considerations for independent operation of\nstatutory auditors. Therefore, many studies have incor-\nporated ethics as an important determinant of statu-\ntory auditors' independence. Several perception-based\nstudies on independence or ethics with complex statis-\ntical techniques have been reviewed as well. Studies\nreviewed so far have only dealt with specific issues\nthat positively or negatively affect statutory audi-\ntors' independence. There is, however, an absence of\na comprehensive discussion taking into consideration\nall the issues together. Besides, the perception of only\nstatutory auditors has been considered so far. But the\nopinion of other respondent groups that by virtue of\ntheir occupation are closely related with the statutory\naudit process or are in a position to give an opinion on\nthis issue has not been considered in those studies. This\ngap in the existing literature prompts us to take up this\ncurrent study and empirically analyse the opinion of\nstatutory auditors and other groups of respondents on\nstatutory auditors' independence for protecting stake-\nholders' interest.\nThe major objectives of the study are as follows:\n1. To analyse the overall opinion of sample respond-\nents from each occupational category on select vari-\nables influencing statutory auditors' independence.\n2. To empirically analyse the significant difference in\nthe opinion of select occupational groups for those\nvariables.\n3. To statistically group individual respondent catego-\nries for select variables based on a significant differ-\nence of opinion among them.\n4. To draw a suitable conclusion on statutory auditors'\nindependence for protecting stakeholders' interest.\nData\nThis study is exploratory in nature and is based on both\nprimary and secondary data, the latter being collected\nfrom books, journal articles, newspaper articles, and\nlegislations. Several legal case decisions in India\nespecially of the Supreme Court of India involving\nstatutory auditors' duties and responsibilities in\ndifferent companies were also considered, as they have\ndirect bearing on the interpretation of various laws,\nrules, and regulations governing statutory auditors'\nindependence. Primary data were collected from\nKolkata, West Bengal, during June 2011 to December\n2013 through pretested, close-ended, and structured\nquestionnaire. Through convenience sampling (Ho,\nOng, & Seonsu, 1997), respondents were selected from\ndifferent occupational groups, for example, chartered\naccountants, cost and management accountants,\nacademicians, students, investors, and corporate\nexecutives. The rationales for selecting individual\nrespondent categories and profile of respondents are\ngiven in Tables A1 and A2.\nBased on books, research papers and judicial case\ndecisions, 25 variables were selected. These variables\nwere converted into statements and incorporated in\nthe questionnaire with Likert 5-point scale (5 repre-\nsenting `strongly agree' (SA), 4 representing `agree'\n(A), 3 representing `neutral' (N), 2 representing `disa-\ngree' (D), 1 representing `strongly disagree' (SD))\nAnalysis of Collected Data\nThe mean sample score of each respondent cate-\ngory for each variable was calculated in addressing\nthe first objective of the study. Mean scores represent\nthe opinion of a particular respondent group. As far\nas the second objective is concerned, one-way anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to analyse\nsignificant difference of opinion among respondent\ngroups. Finally, Tukey's honestly significant difference\n(HSD) test was conducted in order to group individual\nrespondent categories into homogeneous subsets. SPSS\n17.0 was exercised for the purpose of analysis.\nSelection of Variables\nFrom the literature survey, variables that positively or\nnegatively influenced statutory auditors' independence\nin a professional engagement were identified (Table 1).\nTable 1: Variables Influencing    \nStatements Rationale for Variable Selection based on Secondary Data and Legal Cases Decision at the Judiciary\nV\nNegligence of Statutory\nAuditors\nStakeholders of a business depend upon statutory auditors' opinion. Hence, negligence on the part of statutory\nauditor is a contravention of Clauses 6, 7, and 8 of Part I of the 2nd Schedule of Chartered Accountants Act,\nCases at judiciary from long past have shown instances of statutory auditors' negligence (refer to Tri-Sure India\nLtd. vs A.F. Ferguson and Co. and Others, 1985; Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri\nS.N. Sachdeva, 2011; Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Rajesh Chadha, 2012; Subrata Chattoraj vs\nUnion of India & Others, 2014). Court judgements in all of these cases proved gross negligence by statutory\nauditors.\nV\nSufficiency of Regulatory\nFramework\nInsufficiency in regulatory framework often fails to redress statutory auditors' ethical dilemma which ultimately\nlead them to compromise their independence. In our country, regulatory framework comprising Companies\nAct, 2013, Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, and Code of Ethics provide sufficient regulatory support to statutory\nauditors' independence.\nSufficiency of regulatory framework was a governing issue of statutory auditors' independence in an old case of\nFraser and Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968).\nV\nLack of Enforceability of\nRegulatory Framework\nIf regulatory framework governing statutory auditors is not properly enforced, their independence is not\nprotected. In recent cases, relating to statutory audit failure, it was observed that statutory auditor did not\ncomply with applicable SAs while performing audit engagements (Price Waterhouse & Co. vs Securities and\nThere was also contravention of Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 (refer to Council of Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India vs Praveen Kumar Katyal, 2011) and Code of Ethics (refer to Yogeshwari Kumari vs\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2010). All these cases certainly raise our concern on appropriate\nenforcement of existing regulation.\nV\nProcedure of Appointment\nof Statutory Auditors\nIf management of the audit client controls appointment of statutory auditors, they could easily be intimidated to\ngive opinion in management's favour.\nAt Satyam, there was deficiency in control structure (refer to Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India, 2011). It allowed management to control the appointment procedure.\nV\nAppointment by\nIndependent Authority\nIn government companies, appointment of statutory auditors is made on recommendation of the government\n(refer to Gurugobinda Basu vs Sankari Prasad Ghosal, 1963). In such companies, possibilities of management's\ninfluence in appointment procedure are quite less. Appointment made by an independent regulatory authority\ncould safeguard statutory auditors from threats arising out of appointment procedure.\nV\nLong Association between\nStatutory Auditor and Client\nLong association between statutory auditor and client creates a nexus between them. In recent cases, statutory\nauditors were associated with their client for a long period. In Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India (2011), the auditors were associated with the company for a period of 7 years.\nNow, as per the recent Companies Act, 2013 which states that individual auditors are not allowed to be\nassociated with client for a period beyond 5 years, it was a clear contravention of existing regulation.\nV\nRotation of Statutory Auditor Continuous rotation of auditor could break the nexus created due to long association. Recent provisions in\nCompanies Act, 2013 could reduce familiarity threats to statutory auditors' independence.\nTable 1 continued\nStatements Rationale for Variable Selection based on Secondary Data and Legal Cases Decision at the Judiciary\nV\nMaximum Limit of Audit Fee High remuneration makes a statutory auditor financially dependent on the management. A limit to such\neconomic dependence is therefore needed. In the legal case Gurugobinda Basu vs Sankari Prasad Ghosal\n(1963), auditors received remuneration from two companies which were at conflicts of interest between\nthemselves. It was a contravention of Companies Act, 1956.\nIn Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2011), statutory auditors received\nexorbitant fees for audit and non-audit services.\nIn the legal case Shri Mahendra Kumar Mahajan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2012), auditors\nreceived fees both as auditors and members of management. All these real life case examples prompt us to\npropose a maximum limit to the total remuneration that can be paid to an auditor.\nV\nClose Relationship between\nStatutory Auditor and\nManagement\nClose relationship with management members often influence an auditor to issue a clean report without\nundertaking proper audit procedure. There are several instances where auditors were closely related with\nmembers of the client company.\nIn the legal case Shri Mahendra Kumar Mahajan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2012), the\npartner of the accounting firm was also in the managing board of the client. In the legal case, Yogeshwari\nKumari vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2010), the auditor was also the director of the company.\nIt was a contravention of Code of Ethics.\nV\nProvision for Non-Audit\nServices\nCertain non-audit services by statutory auditors sometimes influence independent review process. In several\nrecent cases, it was observed that auditors provided consultancy services to the company contravening the code\nof ethics, for example, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs L.K. Ratna & Others (1986); Talluri Srinivas\nvs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2010); Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs\nIn some other legal cases, statutory auditors provided certain services without taking permission from the\nprofessional institute which held them responsible for contravening Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. Other\nsuch cases are: Fraser and Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968); N.K. Gupta vs\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India (1990); Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri\nV\nProhibition of Non-Audit\nServices\nComplete prohibition of non-audit services by statutory auditors could be solution to the aforesaid problem. Recent\nCompanies Act, 2013 have specified some services which could not be provided by an auditor to its audit client.\nV\nStrong Disciplinary\nFramework\nStrong disciplinary framework discourages statutory auditors to get involved in professional misconducts.\nDisciplinary Committee of ICAI decides on the disciplinary sanction against a statutory auditor based on severity\nof his crime. Professional misconduct as defined in Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 attracts disciplinary\nsanction.\nIn India highest disciplinary sanction was provided to statutory auditors at Satyam. It was imprisonment and\ncancellation of membership certificate (refer to Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad vs Subramani\nGopalakrishnan, 2011). However, in most of the cases, statutory auditors are either reprimanded (Council of\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri S.N. Sachdeva, 2011) or their names are removed from the\nlist of practicing members for a period ranging from 1 to 3 years (refer to Institute of Chartered Accountants of\nIndia vs Rajesh Chadha, 2012; Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs K.K. Gupta, 2008).\nIn some of these legal cases, sometimes the defendant auditor files a petition against the punitive action taken\nagainst them. Based on merit of the case, the court may approve or dismiss their appeal. Hence, a strong and\neffective disciplinary framework is a prerequisite of independent audit.\nV\nStrengthening Audit\nCommittee\nAudit Committee is an independent board committee nominated by the shareholders to look after their interest\nby keeping a constant oversight on statutory auditors' selection and performance. Strengthening competence\nand independence of this committee will safeguard statutory auditors' independence.\nIn some known scandals (refer to Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2011),\ninternal control system was not sufficient and the Audit Committee failed to perform its role. The result is well\nknown to us. Hence, a strong Audit Committee is also required for helping auditors in independent audit process.\nV\nEffectiveness of Peer Review\nCommittee\nCompliance of technical and ethical standard in an audit engagement is reviewed by a select member of the\nPeer Review Committee under Council of Chartered Accountants of India. This mechanism enforces existing\nregulation on statutory auditors' independence. In some cases, regulatory authorities in India conduct separate\naudit in the company's books and find out the lacuna in existing audit procedures.\nIn the legal case Partha Ghosh vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2009), special audit done by RBI\nidentified some irregularities which could not be found by the auditors.\nThough peer review enforced by ICAI is a comprehensive mechanism, in legal case P. Rama Krishna vs Institute\nof Chartered Accountants of India (2010), it was observed that both audit partner and concurring review partner\nin the client company was from the same accounting firm. Hence, the review was not an independent review.\nEffectiveness of peer review mechanism is thus an important tool to ensure statutory auditors' independence.\nTable 1 continued\nTable 1 continued\nStatements Rationale for Variable Selection based on Secondary Data and Legal Cases Decision at the Judiciary\nV\nModification in Company\nLaw\nRecent introduction of Companies Act, 2013 incorporates certain new provisions aiming at protection of statutory\nauditors' independence. Its provisions relating to rotation of auditors, non-audit services are some of them.\nV\nEstablishment of Oversight\nAuthority\nRecent Companies Act, 2013 mandates establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) which,\nwith many of its other activities, is supposed to oversee audit operations in the country. It is expected to enforce\nregulatory pronouncements on statutory auditors' independence.\nV\nNeed for Ethical Education Ethical education in every sphere of life could help a person to understand the true meaning of ethics and its\nimpact on their decision making (Mayer et al., 2005).\nV\nIncorporation of Ethics in\nAccounting Curriculum\nInclusion of ethics in professional accounting curriculum could help a statutory auditor to understand the\nethical implication of their every professional decision (Ghaffari et al., 2008).\nV\nNeed for Awareness\nProgramme by ICAI\nAwareness programmes on ethics could facilitate a practical approach to the ethical knowledge. This sometimes\nmay prove to be beneficial in resolving ethical dilemma.\nV\nNeed for Orientation\nProgramme by ICAI and\nAcademic Institute\nA constructive collaboration between professional bodies and academic world could facilitate exchange of\nideas in a wide spectrum. It will result in improvement in accounting curriculum and ethics will get a special\nV\nNeed for Practical Training\nto Resolve Ethical Conflict\nPractical training on ethics directly addresses ethical problems faced by a statutory auditor. Legal case Fraser\nand Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968) shows that lack of statutory auditors'\nindependence was mostly due to statutory auditors' lack of ethical awareness which could be improved through\nbroad academic training.\nV\nRewarding Statutory\nAuditors for Ethical Practice\nIf statutory auditors get rewarded for ethical performance, it might provide other auditors some impetus to be\nethical in their future engagements.\nV\nUniformity of Code of\nConduct\nIn cross-country audit engagements, auditors falter in their ethical duty by using the loopholes of regulatory\nmismatch in two countries. This situation could be avoided if regulatory framework across the globe were\nV\nLucidity in Audit Report Most of the investors do not have technical knowledge in the fields of accounting or auditing. Hence, Audit\nReport should be made more lucid for understanding of the common investors.\nV\nMass Media's Role of Public\nAwareness on Audit Ethics\nIn this media-centric environment, ethical awareness of auditors should be spread with the help of newspaper,\ntelevision, and social networking sites. It could improve the current situation.\nSource: Authors' compilation from legislations, case decisions at the Judiciary and research papers.\nTable 1 continued\nPerceptions of 601 respondents from different occupa-\ntions on these variables were collected using a pretested,\nclose-ended, and structured questionnaire based on the\nmethod specified in the research methodology.\nDemographic Profile of Respondents\nA brief demographic profile of the respondents is given\nin Table 2.\nTable 2 reflects the general characteristics of the sample:\nSmall proportion of female respondents indicates\nmale domination in the sample. Demographic profile\nof respondents based on their age signifies that\nrespondents with diverse level of experience have\nparticipated in the study.\nSample respondents were selected on the basis of their\noccupation. From the demographic profile, it is clear\nthat there was maximum participation from academic\ncommunities (academicians and students), followed\nby statutory auditors \u00ad Chartered Accountants (CAs)\nand Cost & Management Accountants (CMAs). Other\ntwo groups are also important for the current research.\nThough the proportion of respondents from inves-\ntors and corporate executives is less than the other four\ngroups, their considerable participation makes the total\nsample a balanced one.\nAnalysis of Overall Opinion of Individual\nRespondent Categories for Each Variable\nThe opinion of respondents on each of the select\nvariables was incorporated in a data sheet and analysed\nwith the help of a statistical software. As mentioned in\nthe research methodology, each respondent's degree of\nagreement with a particular variable was represented\nby a score. After incorporating the data in the statistical\nsoftware,themeanscoreofeachrespondentcategoryand\nthe overall mean score for each variable was calculated.\nAs `3' represented a `neutral' opinion of a respondent,\nscores more than 3 signified agreement with a particular\nvariable and vice versa. Opinions of each respondent\ngroup or the entire sample for a particular variable were\nobtained from these mean scores.

Some of the legal cases,\nreferred to in this study, also point to the same conclu-\nsion. In some of these cases, statutory auditors failed\nto verify assets of the company (refer to Council of\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India vs V Rajaram\nof V Rajaram and Co., 1959), while in some other cases,\nthey failed to perform with due diligence (refer to\nCouncil of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs R\nAyyavoo, 2003). There were some cases where statutory\nauditors published their report without collecting suffi-\ncient and appropriate pieces of evidence on a particular\nissue (refer to Narayanan Nambudiri vs Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India, 2005). In a nutshell, there\nare ample examples where statutory auditors failed to\ndetect irregularities in the books of accounts of a corpo-\nrate enterprise (refer to Council of Institute of Chartered\nAccountants of India vs R N Bahl, 2006). Some audit fail-\nures were due to absolute negligence on the part of the\nauditor, while others were due to their alleged lack of\nindependence. All these legal case examples support\nthe empirical finding of this study that statutory\nauditors are negligent in performing their duties.\nLong association with audit client and close relation-\nship with management impairs a statutory auditor's\nindependence in a professional engagement. In the legal\ncase, Tri-Sure India Ltd. vs AF Ferguson and Co. and Others\n(1985), statutory auditors were associated with the client\nfor a long period of time. However, at that time, rota-\ntion of the auditor was not a mandatory requirement.\nThe result on close professional relationship is also\nsupported by the legal case Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India (2011).\nRotation of the auditor, maximum limit of audit fee,\nstrong disciplinary framework, external review of audit\nwork, modification in company law, establishment of\noversight authority, and all the activities that go on\nimproving ethical orientation of statutory auditors have\nbeen proposed as a measure of solution by the entire\nsample. Cases like Satyam (refer to Talluri Srinivas vs\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2010) could be\navoided if there was a limit on the total remuneration\nat the time of the Satyam scandal. A strong disciplinary\nstructurecouldalsoescapemanymorefraudcases(refer\nto Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs\nPraveen Kumar Katyal, 2011) that took advantage of the\nlax disciplinary framework. Individual respondents are\nwidely segmented among themselves for their opinion\non each variable.\nIn most of the cases, the sample from academic commu-\nnity is found to behave uniformly. On the other hand,\nstatutory auditors represented by CAs and CMAs\nhave similar views on some issues. Corporate execu-\ntives mostly go with the views of academic community.\nInvestors are rather sceptical on the solutions provided\nto improve statutory auditors' independence.\nAnalysis of Significant Difference in the Opinion\nof Select Occupational Groups\nWith a view to analyse the significant difference in the\nopinions of select respondent categories, the following\nsteps were taken:\n1. Hypothesis. The opinion of individual respondent\ncategories is represented by their mean scores.\nTherefore, with a view to test whether a significant\ndifference exists in the opinion of the population\nof individual respondent categories, the following\nnull and alternate hypotheses were proposed:\nNull Hypothesis (H\n): Population mean of individual\nrespondent categories are equal.\nAlternate Hypothesis (H\n): Population mean of any two\nrespondent categories are not equal.\n2. Statistical Test. With a view to test the afore-\nsaid hypotheses for each of the variables selected\nunder this study, one-way ANOVA (Driscoll, 1996)\nwas conducted. It is a parametric test conducted\nto determine whether an independent variable\nhas an influence on the dependent observations.\nIn this study, the occupation of respondents is the\nindependent variable. If significant difference does\nnot exist among individual respondent categories,\nit can be inferred that occupation does not have\nsignificant influence on individual observations of\nrespondents.\n3. Test Statistics. Test statistics (F) in one-wayANOVA\nis calculated based on the following formula\nF = MS\nbetween\nwithin\n,\nwhere MS (Mean Square)\nbetween =\nSS (Sum of Square)\nbetween\n/(C \u00ad 1); MS\nwithin =\nSS\nwithin\n/(N \u00ad C).\nSS within \n= -\nj\nc\ni\nn\nij j\nSS between \n= -\n=\n=\nj\nc\nj j\nn Y Y\n  ( )\nY j\nj\n= Mean for category\nY\n=\n= Mean over the whole sample or grand mean\nY i j\nij\n= th observation in the th category\n\nC = Number of categories\nN = Total sample size.\n4. Degree of Freedom (DF). Degree of freedom is the\nnumber of values in the final calculation of statis-\ntics that are allowed to vary. For one-way ANOVA,\nmean squares are calculated by dividing the sum\nof squares by their respective DF. Therefore, in\none-way ANOVA, there are two DFs: C \u00ad 1 and N\n\u00ad C. In this study, the number of categories is 6 and\nthe total sample size is 601. Therefore, DFs calcu-\nlated for each variable under study is 6 \u00ad 1 and 601\n5. Level of Significance. The level of significance refers\nto the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.\nIf the level of significance for a particular research\nis 5 per cent, it may be inferred that the decision of\nacceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis is 95 per\ncent true. In social science research, this level of signif-\nicance may vary from 1 per cent to 10 per cent. This\nstudy has considered 5 per cent level of significance.\n6. Decision Rule. With a view to taking decision on\nacceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis for a\nparticular variable, this study used the F distribu-\ntion table to find out a value very close to the test\nstatistics at 5,595 DFs. For this value, the corre-\nsponding (P-value) was then identified. This is\nthe probability of getting the test statistics at 5,595\nDFs. If it is at more than 5 per cent significance\nlevel, the test statistics is considered to be in the\nacceptance region. So, H\nis accepted. But if this\nprobability is less than 5 per cent, H\nis rejected,\nfollowing the same rule. Accordingly, inferences\nare drawn on the significant difference of opinion\nbetween respondent categories for select variables\nand the impact of occupation on the opinion of\nrespondents.\nBased on the data collected from the sample respond-\nents, the result of one-way ANOVA and the inferences\nfor each categorical variable have been incorporated\nin Table 4.\nTable 4: Result of  \nVariable

Compilation of primary data using SPSS.\nTable 4 continued\nThe following inferences can be drawn from Table 3:\nRespondent categories significantly differ among\nthemselves regarding their opinion on the negligence\nof a statutory auditor. Though the result suggests\nthat corporate executives do not consider statutory\nauditors to be negligent, there are instances where\nthe corporate executive or client has been found to\nhave lodged a complaint against the statutory audi-\ntors for their alleged lack of independence (refer to\nlegal case: Tri-Sure India Ltd. vs A. F. Ferguson and Co.\nIndividuals, irrespective of their occupation, believe\nthat ethical education is needed for ethical orientation\nof statutory auditors, thereby calling for its incorpo-\nration in the present accounting curriculum of profes-\nsional courses.\nIndividual occupational groups are significantly\ndifferent in their opinion for all other issues that posi-\ntively or negatively influence statutory auditors' inde-\npendence. It shows occupation having an important\ninfluence on the opinion of respondents for these vari-\nables. In the legal case, Yogeshwari Kumari vs Institute\nof Chartered Accountants of India (2010), the client had\nlodged a complaint against the auditor for being the\ndirector of the client company. From this case, it can be\ninferred that the perception of the client and the auditor\nabout the impact of a relationship with the manage-\nment on independence is completely different. This\ncase supports the empirical finding of this study on\nclose relationship with management.\nHomogeneous Groups of Occupational Categories\nThe null hypothesis of equality of population mean in\none-wayANOVAis rejected if any one of the population\nmeans is significantly different from that of the others.\nTherefore, it is possible that while some population\nmeans are statistically different, some means are not.\nWith a view to analyse exactly which population means\nare statistically different, sample mean differences of\neach individual pairs of categories were calculated. A\nnull hypothesis was proposed that population mean\ndifferences are not statistically significant. To test it,\nTukey's HSD test, a post hoc test to one-way ANOVA\n(Malhotra, 2003) was applied, using the same degrees\nof freedom and significance level as that of ANOVA.\nIf the P-value for each mean difference is less than the\nsignificant level, H\nis rejected and it is concluded that\nthere is a significant mean difference between that pair.\nIn this study, where six occupational categories were\nconsidered, it is possible to find out exactly which\noccupational categories are significantly different\namong each other for each variable. Based on this\ntheory, individual occupational categories can be\ngrouped into homogeneous subsets. In each subset,\nrespondent categories do not have a significant differ-\nence of opinion. Homogeneous groups of occupational\ncategories formed by administering this test on the\nsample for the select variables and its inferences are\nsummarized in Table 5.\nTable 5: Homogeneous Groups Formed Based on Significant Mean Differences in Individual Respondent Categories\nVariables\nVariable\nName Group\nOccupational\nCategories\nMean\nScore Inferences\nV\nNegligence\nof Statutory\nAuditors\n1 Corporate\nExecutive\nIn the 1st group, there are corporate executives and investors who are\nneutral in their approach on negligence of statutory auditors.\nIn the 2nd group, persons from academic community (academicians and\nstudent) think statutory auditors were negligent in performing their duties.\nStatutory auditors (CAs and CMAs) are homogeneous in their opinion and\nlies in between the 1st and the 2nd group.\nV\nSufficiency of\nRegulatory\nFramework\nAcademicians, students and CMAs who do not think regulatory framework for\nstatutory auditors are sufficient, fall under the 1st group.\nThe 2nd group has other three respondent categories who slightly agree with\nsufficiency of regulatory framework.\nCorporate\nExecutive\nV\nLack of\nEnforceability\nof Regulatory\nFramework\nCAs and academicians fall under two different extremes of opinion on this\nvariable.

Corporate executives have significant\ndifference of opinion from professional accountants.\nInvestors have close allegiance with people from\nacademic community for the variables that propose\nmeasures for safeguarding statutory auditors'\nindependence.\nFor issues that improve ethical orientation of statutory\nauditors, all occupational categories exhibit a similar\nline of thought.\nConsidering the entire sample, procedure of appoint-\nment, tenure of service, and close relationship with\nmanagement emerged as the major influencing factors\nof statutory auditors' independence.\nRotation of auditors, strong disciplinary framework,\nexternal review of audit work, and all the activities that\nimprove the ethical orientation of the statutory audi-\ntors are considered to be important safeguards to statu-\ntory auditors' independence.\nIndividuals irrespective of their occupation believe that\nethical education is needed for improving ethical orien-\ntation of the statutory auditors and it should be imme-\ndiately incorporated in the accounting curriculum of\nprofessional courses.\nIndividual occupational categories are significantly\ndifferent in their opinion for all other variables that\npositively or negatively influence statutory auditors'\nindependence.\nMost occupation categories believe that the lack of\nenforceability of regulatory framework, procedure\nof appointment, tenure of service, and provision of\nnon-audit service could impair statutory auditors'\nindependence.\nMost of the occupation categories also believe that the\nrotation of auditors and strong disciplinary frame-\nwork strengthen the audit committee, and that effec-\ntive peer review committee, modification in company\nlaw, awareness, orientation and training programmes,\nand rewards for ethical service could restore statutory\nauditors' independence.\nMost of the occupational categories do not think that\nfixing a maximum limit on remuneration would in any\nway reduce cases of statutory audit failure.\nThis study has the following limitations:\n1. Multivariate statistical techniques, for example,\nfactor analysis or cluster analysis are not applied for\nthe current dataset.\n2. Difference in the opinion of respondent catego-\nries could also be tested using the non-parametric\nKruskal\u00adWallis Test.\n3. Apart from statutory auditors' independence, no\nother governance related issues that protect stake-\nholders' interest are considered.\nCONCLUSION\nStatutory auditors validate `truth and fairness' in\nfinancial statements. Financial statements authenti-\ncated by statutory auditors are considered trustworthy\nby the stakeholders of the business. They take their\nfinancial decision based on the financial statement\nwith utmost good faith in statutory auditors. However,\nin an in-depth examination of the recent corporate\naccounting scandals, a few outrageous companies\nhave been found to falsify their financial statement for\nquite a long period of time. Big and highly regarded\naccounting firms related with these companies as statu-\ntory auditors failed to recognize those frauds resulting\nin the publication of a false financial statement which\nultimately led to a catastrophic consequence to the\ncompany impacting most of its stakeholders. In this\nbackdrop, this study critically reviews relevant liter-\nature and identifies certain variables that positively\nor negatively influence statutory auditors' independ-\nence. The opinion of respondents from different occu-\npational categories is collected on these variables.\nThe mean score of individual respondent categories\nrepresents their opinion for each select variable. The\noverall mean score shows the opinion of the entire\nsample. Different occupational categories are signifi-\ncantly different in their opinion for most of the varia-\nbles except for ethical education to build ethical orien-\ntation of statutory auditors. Significant differences of\nopinion between all individual pairs of respondent\ncategories are analysed and respondent categories\nare grouped into homogeneous subsets. It is observed\nthat professional accountants and academic commu-\nnities normally behave in a distinct fashion. Investors\nand corporate executives align with these two major\ngroups based on the nature of a particular variable. If\nthe study findings are given due importance in times\nto come, an all-round improvement in statutory audi-\ntors' independence can be expected.\nAPPENDIX\nTable A1: Rationales for Selecting Individual Respondents Categories\nChartered Accountants (CA) CAs plays the role of statutory auditors of financial statements in the Indian companies. Naturally they have hand\non work experience and knowledge in the field of statutory auditors' independence. So, CA's both in practice and\nservice, are included in the study.\nCost and Management\nAccountants (CMAs)\nCMAs are professional accountants entrusted with the responsibility of auditing cost related information in a\ncompany by statute of law. Therefore, they are also called statutory auditors. Although, the study mainly covers\nstatutory financial auditors, CMAs, both in practice and service, also come within the purview of our research as\nprofessional accountants.\nAcademicians Academicians from undergraduate colleges, Universities and Business Schools in Kolkata, who are specialized in the\nsubject of accounting and auditing and have research orientation in the related field, are included in the present study.\nStudents Students especially from commerce background pursing their post-graduation from university or business school or\nstudents appearing for the final examination of Chartered Accountancy course are expected to bring their modern\nthoughts on a barring issue like statutory auditors' independence. Naturally they are included as a respondent category.\nInvestors Investors who invest their own money in the stock market, and institutions like banks, insurance companies or\nmutual funds companies who accumulate money from the individual savers and invest it in the capital market are\nthe main target respondents under this category. For having opinions of institutional investors, correspondents from\nKolkata regional offices of these companies have been interviewed.\nCorporate Executives Corporate executives from big public limited or private limited companies, who look after Accounts or Finance\nDepartment in their company and deal with statutory auditor, are the direct representative of the management.\nTheir nature of work allows them to closely observe the commitment of statutory auditors towards their\nindependence requirement in a professional engagement. Therefore, corporate executives are a fairly important\nsegment in the current study.\nMethod of Data Collection All the respondents from aforesaid occupational groups were contacted on a personal basis over phone and\ninterview meeting held after an appointment was taken as per their convenience. Their opinion on each of the\nstatement of the questionnaire was incorporated.\nSource: Authors' compilation based on discussion with select groups of respondents as a part of Pilot Survey.\nTable A2: Profile of Data Collection\nRespondent Categories Initial Sample Selected Number of Opinions Collected\nSource: Compilation of field survey data using SPSS 20.0.\nREFERENCES\nArens, A., & Elder, R.
