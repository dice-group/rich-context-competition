In 2010 an illusion created by Ko Nakamura won the second prize in the 2010\nvisual illusion contest in Japan (http://visiome.neuroinf.jp/modules/xoonips/detail.php?\nitem_id=6716). With his permission, we introduce this phenomenon to the wider vision science com-\nmunity. In the illusion, arrays of oval patches of horizontal luminance gradient are placed on a white\nbackground (see Figure 1). When the patches in the top and the bottom halves of the display move in\nopposite directions, the background lightnesses appear to be different: lighter when the black parts are\nleading, and darker when the black parts are trailing. This is a striking demonstration that motion can\ndirectly affect lightness perception, but the underlying cause is yet to be investigated.\nQuestions arise as to how this illusion occurs: is the effect polarity specific; does the effect involve\nlightening of an area, darkening of the other area, or both; is the crucial effect enhanced lightness con-\ntrast at the leading edges, enhanced lightness assimilation at the trailing edges, or both; and how is the\nlightness gradient itself crucial, apart from the asymmetry? We addressed these questions by measur-\ning the perceived background lightness in two experiments.\nNote that lightness and brightness are not obviously separable in the case of this particular illusion. We\nuse the term lightness throughout the paper for convenience, because we tend to perceive the background as a\nwhite surface, and also because we asked the participants to judge the colour instead of the intensity of light.\nWe do not, however, intend to restrict ideas either to phenomenology or underlying mechanisms at this stage.\nMethods\nParticipants\nSix participants (including the author HA) were tested in Kyoto University, and four (including the\nauthor NSS) were tested in the University of Bristol under similar conditions. The na\u00efve participants\nMotion influences the perception of background lightness\n42 Ashida H, Scott-Samuel N E\nwere paid for their time according to the universities'standards. One participant in Bristol was omitted\nfrom analysis due to a failure to see any illusion in the original artwork (but note that including the data\nfrom this participant did not substantially change the pattern of averaged results).\nStimuli\nVisual stimuli were created using PsychToolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) on an Apple MacBook\nPro in Kyoto and a MacBook in Bristol, and presented on CRT displays (EIZO F57 in Kyoto and Sony\nTrinitron in Bristol) placed in dim rooms. The screen had a resolution of 1,024 \u00d7 768 pixels with a\nThe viewing distance was 420 mm in Kyoto and 590 mm in Bristol.\nSimplified versions of the original illusion were used (Figure 2). Grey rectangular fields (H 10 \u00d7\nV 6 deg) of mean luminance were presented above and below the centre of the minimum luminance\ndisplay, separated by 1.2 deg. In the top rectangular area, square patches (0.6 \u00d7 0.6 deg) with verti-\ncally oriented luminance gradients were located in grids (3 rows and 10 columns), which moved hori-\nrectangle was uniform and its luminance was controlled by the participants via the numerical keypad.\nWe did not present the gradient patches in the comparison stimulus because changing its lightness\nintroduces undesirable artefacts of edges at the smooth side of patches. A white fixation bar (H 7.9 \u00d7\nV 0.3 deg) was shown in the centre of the display.\nThere were three types of luminance gradient: white to grey (W-G), black to grey (B-G), and\nwhite to black (W-B), where white denotes maximum luminance and black minimum luminance.\nFigure 1. Illustrations of the illusion created by Ko Nakamura. The background is uniformly white, but the top\nand bottom parts appear lighter or darker depending on the motion direction, as illustrated by the colouring here.\nFigure 2. The stimuli in Experiment 1: (a) a screenshot and (b) the three types of gradients (B-G, W-G, W-B).\nMotion influences the perception of background lightness 43\nThe gradient was always linear. There were two directions of gradient, and all the patches had the same\ngradient in each trial.\nProcedure\nParticipants started each trial by pressing a key. They were instructed to adjust the lightness (grey\nlevel) of the bottom, uniform rectangle to match the apparent colour (whiteness or lightness) of the\nbackground of the upper rectangle by pressing keys. The initial grey level of the bottom rectangle was\nrandomly set as \u00b132 (on a 0 to 255 scale) from the veridical value for each trial.\nParticipants were instructed to keep their fixation within the white bar in the centre. Control of\nfixation was not too strict because while direct inspection of each grey area was best avoided, restrict-\ning the comparison of lightness to the small areas around a strongly localised fixation point was also\nconsidered undesirable. There was no time limit for responding.\nEach of the 48 conditions (three types of gradients, four speeds, two gradient directions, and two\nmotion directions) was tested once in a single run in a random order.Arun typically took about 5 to 10 min.\nFive runs were conducted for each participant, and the first run was discarded from analysis as a practice.\nResults\nFor each trial, the difference in the matched luminance of the top and bottom panels was divided\nby the mean background luminance of the top panel to give the score of matching error in contrast.\nPositive and negative scores indicate that the top panel was perceived lighter and darker, respec-\ntively, than it actually was. Participants showed individual biases in their matching: on average,\nsome adjusted the bottom part too light, others too dark, irrespective of the gradient elements in the\nupper part. Each participant's results were therefore normalised by subtracting their baseline before\naveraging across participants. The baseline was defined as the averaged matching luminance for the\nW-B stimuli at speed 0 deg/s, on the assumption that it should not have biases of either motion or\noverall luminance.\nA four-way ANOVA (stimulus type \u00d7 gradient direction \u00d7 motion direction \u00d7 speed) revealed\none of the three-way interactions (stimulus type \u00d7 gradient direction \u00d7 motion direction: F(2, 16) =\nThe effect of stimulus type is understood as an overall assimilation to the patch colour. In Figure 3,\nthe data are differently organised but the overall assimilation is visible: the white patches (W-G) made\nthe background look lighter while the black patches (B-G) made it look darker.\nFor the significant interactions, we then split the data by stimulus type. This allows analysis of the\ndata in terms of specific combinations of motion and gradients, e.g. a comparison of the case of leading\nwhite edges versus trailing white edges for the W-G stimulus.\nMatching error\nSpeed (deg/s)\nWhite leading\nBlack leading\nWhite leading\nWhite trailing\nBlack leading\nBlack trailing\nFigure 3.

A significant simple main effect of speed was found for \"white\nresults are somewhat weaker or mixed, but are basically consistent with the effects of leading white or\nblack edges for W-G and B-G stimuli.\nThese asymmetrical effects of motion on lightness contrast and assimilation appear to be the basis\nof the illusion (in which the elements of the same gradient direction move in opposite directions in the\ntwo areas). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that motion affects lightness perception directly\n(although see Agostini & Proffitt, 1993, for an effect of lightness contrast derived from \"common fate\"\nof element movement). The effect at the leading edges seems more important than the effect at the trail-\ning edges. A remaining question is whether the gradient plays an essential role, or whether the lightness\ncontrast at the leading edges is the critical factor. This question was addressed in Experiment 2.\nTo determine if the gradient is crucial, the effects of patches with black-to-white smooth gradient were\ncompared with those with black-and-white stepwise lightness changes. If the contrast of the leading\nedge is the crucial factor, these two types of stimuli should have similar effects on the perceived light-\nness of the background. If, on the other hand, the gradient is essential, the latter would have much\nsmaller effects.\nThe results for W-B stimuli in Experiment 1 were less clear than the other two conditions. This\ncould be due to the steeper gradient with double the lightness change (compared to the W-G and B-G\nstimuli) in the same space. We therefore doubled the width of each patch from those in Experiment 1. In\naddition, the effect of stimulus speed could have been obscured by relatively free eye movement along\nthe motion axis. Fixation was therefore restricted in Experiment 2 to assess the effect of speed more\nstringently.\nMethods\nParticipants\nSeven participants (including the two authors) were tested in Kyoto University. The na\u00efve participants\nwere paid for their time according to the universities' standards. Two of the na\u00efve participants only\nparticipated in this experiment, and the others participated after they completed Experiment 1.\nStimuli\nThe stimuli were similar to those in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions (see Figure 4). The\nwidth of the patches was doubled in order to keep the gradient slope the same as in the W-G and B-G\nstimuli in Experiment 1. The number of patch columns was therefore reduced to 5. There were only\ntwo types of patches: black-to-white gradient (gradient) and black-and-white steps (no gradient). Sta-\ntionary patches were presented in the bottom rectangle to make the backgrounds look more similar\nto each other. The patches in Experiment 2 had clear edges on both sides and did not show the previ-\nously mentioned artefacts of undesired lightness gaps between the patches and the background when\nthe background level was changed while the gradient remained the same. The spatial location (phase)\nof the stationary patches was randomised for each trial. The stimuli moved at one of five speeds\nMotion influences the perception of background lightness 45\nused to assess the effect of speed more clearly.\nProcedure\nThe participants adjusted the background lightness of the bottom panel to match the perceived light-\nness (colour) of the top panel, as in Experiment 1.

A two-way ANOVA (motion type \u00d7\nspeed) was conducted separately for the two types of stimuli.

The effects of white and black edges in the gradient stimuli appear\nasymmetric about the x axis, but it should be noted that these results are not consistent with those in\nExperiment 1 where the effect of speed was significant only for \"white leading\". The overall shapes of\ncurves are similar and the effect of the gradient is evident, but it remains unclear whether the effect is\nasymmetric as to the gradient direction.\nMost importantly, the effect of motion type, i.e. the colour of the leading edge, was found only for\nthe gradient stimuli. A slightly reversed effect for the no-gradient stimuli at higher speed, although not\nsupported statistically, might reflect motion blur at the trailing edges overriding the contrast effect at\nthe weak leading edges, if any.\nFigure 4.

The original artwork had black patches on a white background, but here it was\nconfirmed that the black and white patches have roughly symmetric effects on a grey background.\nThe black or white patches have an assimilation effect on the background when they are stationary,\nand motion modulates this baseline assimilation. The effect of motion is characterised as lightning by\nleading black edges, and darkening by leading white patches.\nThis effect might be related to a gain control process that enhances stimulus contrast at the lead-\ning edges and suppresses it at the trailing edges of moving elements (Arnold, Thompson, & Johnston,\n2007). While this could account for the original Nakamura effect, it does not explain our result that a\nluminance gradient is necessary for the illusion: leading edges of simple black or white patterns did\nnot work (Experiment 2).\nOn the basis of these findings, we propose a possible explanation for this illusion from a compu-\ntational point of view.\nGradient-based motion detection\nA role for spatiotemporal gradients in motion processing has been shown empirically. Anstis (1990)\nreported that adapting to temporal luminance ramps (i.e. the luminance of an area changes in the form\nof a sawtooth function) results in motion aftereffect of a test pattern. The aftereffect direction depends\non the polarity of the luminance edge between the test pattern and its background. More recently,\nScarfe and Johnston (2010) demonstrated that combination of aftereffects to spatial gradient and tem-\nporal ramps produces a perception of motion. These findings are readily explained by the gradient\nscheme of motion detection (e.g. Marr & Ullman, 1981) as we discuss next.\nGradient schemes compute local image velocity directly from spatial and temporal gradients.\nSuch schemes are popular in image processing (Horn & Schunck, 1981; Lucas & Kanade, 1981),\nas well as in biological modelling (Johnston, McOwan, & Buxton, 1992; Marr & Ullman, 1981). In\naddition, Harris (1980) proposed that velocity could be encoded by comparing the responses of flicker\nand pattern systems on the basis of psychophysical results. Finally, a Japanese patent granted in 1976\n(#1323442) encapsulates a similar idea (Takahiko Fukinuki, personal communication).\nIn the case of one-dimensional motion, local velocity v at a location x in image I is essentially\nderived as v = -(I/t)/(I/x). In other words, local speed is given by the temporal gradient divided\nby the spatial gradient. This one-dimensional model is useful for biological modelling because neu-\nrons in the primary visual cortex mostly have one-dimensional receptive fields (e.g. Daugman,\n1985; Parker & Hawken, 1988), feeding to later stages of integration orientation and space. The\ngradient scheme is conceptually different from other major models of motion detection, such as\nmotion energy (Adelson & Bergen, 1985) or the Reichardt detector (Reichardt, 1961; van Santen &\nSperling, 1985), but the actual shapes of the implemented filters can be quite similar (Mather, 1994).\nMotion energy and Reichardt models do not provide estimates of invariant speed at the detector\nlevel, and a proposed scheme of computing speed by the ratio of high- and low-speed detector out-\nputs (Adelson & Bergen, 1985) resembles the gradient scheme. Actually, the original motion energy\nmodel was constructed by using Gaussian derivatives as the spatial filters. Discussion on the basis of\na simple gradient scheme, therefore, could be informative even if one does not support the gradient\nscheme against the others.\nMurakami et al. (2006) proposed a schematic model of the \"Rotating Snakes\" illusion (Kitaoka\n& Ashida, 2003) using a modified gradient scheme. The \"Rotating Snakes\" figure is composed of\nrepeated patterns of four colours (typically black-blue-white-yellow) that give rise to asymmetric\nspatial luminance gradients. With small involuntary eye movements (drift), the retinal image shifts\nand gives rise to temporal gradients at each point. Asymmetric motion responses can be derived if\neither the spatial or temporal gradient is slightly biased in one direction. While it is unrealistic to\nassume biased spatial derivative filters, the temporal derivative filters are causal and more likely\nhave an imbalance of positive and negative lobes of their impulse response, which would introduce\na bias. The assumption that decrease of contrast is overestimated compared to increase of contrast\n(see Figure 9 in Murakami et al., 2006), which is consistent with psychophysically derived temporal\nimpulse responses (Burr & Morrone, 1993; Hisakata & Murakami, 2008), explains the observed\nillusory motion.\nMotion influences the perception of background lightness 47\nA schematic model of the Nakamura illusion\nThis assumption of overestimation of decreasing contrast and underestimation of increasing con-\ntrast (Murakami et al., 2006) can explain the Nakamura illusion. Consider the temporal changes of\nlightness (or luminance) at one horizontal location (shown by the dashed black line in the insets of\nFigure 6). The lightness physically changes as shown by the black lines in each combination of gra-\ndient and motion. The red lines show expected representation of lightness with the assumption of a\nbiased gradient computation as described above.\nThe primary effect of lightness contrast was found when the white or black edge was leading\n(Figure 6a and b). In these cases, the lightness contrast suddenly reaches the maximum, and then\ngradually decreases. The temporal gradient of decreasing contrast is overestimated by the biased fil-\nters, which would yield darkening in Figure 6(a) or whitening in Figure 6(b) at the end of the gradient.\nThis overshoot could continue into the grey area and cause the contrast effects on the background\nas shown by the dashed red lines. The effect was not clear when the white or black edge is trailing\n(Figure 6c and d). Here, the effect of biased smooth gradient may not affect the background\nafter the final steep edge. A possible slight overshoot may be cancelled or overcome by motion\nblur at the edges. Prediction is even less straightforward when the gradient ranges white to black\n(Figure 6e and f). In Figure 6(e), the red lines were simply copied and connected from Figure 6(a) and\n(d). This would result in slight underestimation of the lightness at the end of the patch. Similarly, in\nFigure 6(f), red lines are copied from Figure 6(b) and (c). The bias in the first half is not completely\nnulled in the second half, but it is uncertain what happens at the final edge. Unlike in Figure 6(c) and (d),\nthe effect of gradient bias and that of motion blur may be in the same direction.\nNote that possible biases at the edges are not considered in Figure 6. While the gradient has\ninfinite slope at the edge, retinal and neural images are blurred and should have measurable gradient\nslopes, which should be also biased. This possibility is ignored here in the interests of simplicity, but\nthe scheme remains valid at least in the crucial conditions of Figure 6(a) and (b), where the effect\nshould be enhanced if the initial contrast increase is underestimated. In Figure 6(c\u00adf), lightness con-\ntrast could have been enhanced by overestimation of the trailing edges, which could also be true with\nthe B-W stimuli. This did not seem to happen, however, suggesting that the steep edges have little\neffect in the modulation of lightness.\nFigure 6. Gradient-based explanation of the Nakamura illusion. The time-course of the lightness change at one\nlocation (shown by the vertical black dashed line in the inset) is plotted for each type of element and each motion\ndirection in Experiment 1. Solid black lines show the actual lightness change. Red lines show the predicted\nrepresentation of lightness, assuming that increment and decrement slopes are biased by a fixed ratio of 1.4\n(arbitrarily set for illustration). Dashed blue lines show possible effects of motion blur at the edges.\nRelative lightness\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e) (f)\n48 Ashida H, Scott-Samuel N E\nLightness contrast may be modulated laterally (i.e. vertically in this case) in the top and bottom\nportions of the surrounding background. It is then possible that the steep edges had (apparently) little\neffect simply because the areas above and below the edges are small compared to the areas along the\nsmooth gradient.\nThe crucial effect of enhanced lightness contrast, as shown in Figure 6(a) and (b), is well captured\nby this simple scheme, but only qualitatively. In order to develop a more quantitative model, more\nassumptions are needed about several unknown properties. Most importantly, it is not known how\ntemporal gradient responses interact with the static representation of lightness, given the possible\nseparate pathways for motion (mainly in the dorsal stream) and colour (mainly in the ventral stream)\n(Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; Vaina, 1994). Figure 6 assumes an immediate update of lightness repre-\nsentation by the temporal gradient, but this is not realistic, and some postdictive integration may need\nto be introduced. Also, static lightness contrast and assimilation are not considered in Figure 6, which\nshould be somehow implemented in a quantitative model. Finally, motion blur may also need to be\nquantified.\nConcluding remarks\nNakamura's illusion of moving gradients opens the door to further inquiries into novel interactions\nbetween motion and lightness. A greater understanding of this phenomenon could enhance knowledge\nabout the integration of visual features after relatively independent initial processing. The illusion\nappears to be readily explained by a scheme of motion detection based on spatiotemporal gradients.\n"
