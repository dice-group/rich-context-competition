Arnold, MD; Fabio Barbone, MD, DrPH\nBackground: Intussusception is the leading cause of in-\ntestinal obstruction in young children. Antibiotics are the\nmost frequently prescribed medication in the pediatric\npopulation and have common adverse effects on the gas-\ntrointestinal tract.\nObjective: To determine whether a relationship exists\nbetween primary idiopathic intussusception and antibi-\notic drug use.\nDesign: Case-control study.\nParticipants: Ninety-three case patients with intussus-\nception and 353 injury controls younger than 4 years who\nwere seen at the emergency department of the Children's\nHospital of Alabama between January 1, 1996, and April\nby quarter and year of time of diagnosis, age, and sex.\nMain Outcome Measures: Odds ratios and 2-sided\n95% confidence intervals were estimated using condi-\ntional logistic regression. Prevalence of antibiotic use in\nan age-standardized, representative sample of US chil-\ndren from NHANES III (Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey) was used for external\ncomparisons.\nResults: Antibiotic use within 48 hours of diagnosis was\nable risk, 18.7%). Antibiotic use among US children ac-\ncording to NHANES III was 10.7%. In cases, the -lactam\nclass accounted for 78% of all medications used. Ceph-\nalosporin use was associated with more than a 20-fold\nincreased risk of intussusception.\nConclusion: An association between antibiotic drug use\nand intussusception was identified.\nmon cause of intestinal obstruc-\ntion in children aged 3 months to\n6 years.1 John Hunter2 first de-\nscribed intestinal invagination in\nthe 18th century; however, the exact\nmechanism is still poorly defined in this\nage group, and the etiology is suspected\nto be multifactorial. Viral pathogens such\nas adenovirus are known to be associated\nwith intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia and\nintussusception,3 but they cannot ex-\nplain all cases. Promotility medications and\ncertain chemical substances such as co-\ncaine, laxatives, and organophosphates\nhavebeenidentifiedaspotentialagentsthat\nmay contribute to the development of in-\ntussusception.4-6 Inflammatory media-\ntors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins,\nand cytokines have been demonstrated to\nincrease rates of intussusception by alter-\ning gut motility in laboratory mice.7 An-\ntibiotics, the second most widely pre-\nscribed medication class in the United\nStates,8 modify gut motility and intesti-\nnal flora.9 To our knowledge, no studies\nto date have implicated antibiotics as a po-\ntential cause of intussusception. We con-\nducted a retrospective, hospital-based,\ncase-control study to determine whether\nan association exists between antibiotic use\nand primary, idiopathic intussusception in\nchildren.\nMETHODS\nMedical records from the emergency depart-\nment (ED) at the Children's Hospital of Ala-\nbama, University of Alabama at Birmingham,\nwere the source of information for this study.\nchild visits per year, serving the primary, sec-\nondary, and tertiary care needs of the Birming-\nham Metropolitan Standard Area and the state\nof Alabama.

All rights reserved.\ninstitutional review board of the University of Alabama at Bir-\nthe medical records of children registered in the ED between\npital medical record system data files.\nChildren eligible to be cases of intussusception were those\nregistered in the ED who were younger than 4 years at the time\nof diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-\nvision, code 560.00). Patients with pathologic lead points listed\nas a secondary diagnosis and those whose medical records could\nnot be found were excluded from the study. Controls were iden-\ntified among children registered in the ED and discharged with\na diagnosis of unintentional injury (International Classifica-\ntrols were matched with cases by calendar year and quarter,\nage (in years), and sex. Four controls per case were selected\nwithin each set defined by year and quarter, age, and sex. If\nmore than 4 controls per case were available per set, the first 4\nmedical records randomly pulled for abstraction were se-\nlected. No relaxation in the matching criteria was allowed when\nfewer than 4 controls per case were available.\nFor cases and controls, the following information was\ncollected using a standardized data collection form: medical\nrecord number, date of abstraction, discharge date, date of birth,\nage (in years), sex, race, insurance type, chronic underlying con-\ndition(s) (yes or no), history of prematurity, allergies to medi-\ncines, patient hospitalization occurrence, immunization sta-\ntus (current or not current), medications used (yes or no), and\na list of all current or recent medications recorded. For anti-\nbiotic use, if the medication was not listed as current, infor-\nmation on date of discontinuation before the date of ED reg-\nistration was recorded, and an indication for treatment also was\nabstracted from the medical records. Generic and proprietary\nnames of medications were identified and classified by one of\nus (D.M.S.) according to the National Drug Code Data Files of\nthe Food and Drug Administration. Antibiotic indications were\ncollected (otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, uri-\nnary tract infection, and other), and \"other\" was defined if avail-\nable from the ED record. Gastrointestinal (GI) medications were\ndefined as antiemetics, intestinal promotility agents, H2\n-\nreceptor antagonists, antacids, and antiflatulents. Gastrointes-\ntinal indications were categorized as gastroesophageal reflux,\ndiarrhea, emesis, or other. Gastrointestinal medications were\ndefined as medications whose primary purpose is to modulate\nclinical effects regarding the GI system. For case patients only,\nthe method of intussusception diagnosis was recorded (clini-\ncal suggestion, surgical, radiographic, or unknown), and the\nanatomic location of the intussusception was identified if known.\nAnalyses were conducted considering use of antibiotics (yes or\nno) or use of a specific antibiotic class as the dependent vari-\nable. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to estimate the rela-\ntive risk (RR) of disease among users of antibiotics compared\nwith nonusers. Conditional maximum likelihood estimates in\nlogistic regression procedures were used to calculate ORs and\n2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The relation between\nprimary idiopathic intussusception and antibiotic drug use was\nevaluated also taking into consideration possible confounding\nvariables. However, terms for variables other than use of anti-\nbiotics and GI medications did not affect the results and there-\nfore were not kept in the final models. In addition, the study\ndid not have enough power to test the possible interaction be-\ntween use of antibiotics and other variables. To estimate the\nproportion of intussusception cases attributable to antibiotic\nuse, attributable risk was calculated as [(E/D)(RR-1)]/RR,\nwhere E is the number of cases who used antibiotics and D is\nthe total number of cases. Again, RR was estimated using an\nOR obtained from a conditional logistic regression model ad-\njusted for use of GI medications.\nAn external comparison was conducted regarding antibi-\notic use prevalence between our cases and controls and a rep-\nresentative sample of American children aged 2 months to 4\nyears from NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey).10 This survey was conducted by the\nUS National Center for Health Statistics between 1988 and\n1994, and its data can be downloaded from the Internet at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data.htm.\ntimates of prescription drug use in the civilian noninstitution-\nalized US population. Prescription drug data were obtained by\ntrained interviewers who inventoried all prescription drugs\nused within 1 month by survey participants 2 months and\nolder. This information can be grouped by age, sex, race or\nethnicity, and other factors of interest. For this study, we ana-\nlyzed NHANES III data to estimate age-standardized rates of\nuse of medications according to the distribution of our case\npatients in months. Antibiotic drug use in the United States\nduring the month before interview can be estimated from\nNHANES III using established weights. For comparability\npurposes, antibiotic use calculated in the United States during\nthe previous 2 weeks was approximately equal to half the\nprevalence in the previous month.\nRESULTS\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 111 intussusception ED cases were identified.\nOf these, 13 (12%) were excluded on the basis of being\nolder than 4 years and 4 (4%) because their medical rec-\nords were not found. Nine patients were excluded with\nlead points as a secondary diagnosis, most (8 of 9) being\nolder than the child's fourth birthday. Thus, 93 cases\ndefined by the matching variables, a control-case ratio\nof less than 4 was obtained owing to lack of available medi-\ncal records for the eligible controls. This led to the in-\nclusion of 353 controls in the study.\nMost children (n=56) diagnosed as having intus-\nsusception were younger than 1 year (Table 1). The\nmale-female ratio was 2.39:1. Cases and controls had simi-\nlar insurance coverage (Medicaid vs private insurance).\nIntussusception diagnosis was primarily radiographic\ning ileocolic or ileocecal intussusception. In addition, cases\nTable 2 describes the association between intussuscep-\ntion and use and type of medications. Antibiotics, anti-\npyretics and analgesics, asthma medications, GI medi-\ncations, immunizations, over-the-counter cold and cough\nmedications, and seizure medications accounted for 97%\nof the medications listed for cases and 99% for controls.\nAmoxicillin was the most commonly used medication\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

Gastrointes-\ntinal medications were the second most common\ntrols) taking a total of 31 GI medications at the time of\nED presentation. Ranitidine (3 cases and 5 controls), pro-\nmethazine hydrochloride (4 cases), cisapride (3 con-\ntrols), aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide\nand simethicone (2 cases and 1 control), and simethi-\ncone (3 cases) were the most common GI medications\nlisted from a total of 11 GI medications identified. An-\ntipyretics and analgesics, asthma medications, over-the-\ncounter cold and cough medicines, and seizure medica-\ntions all had ORs that were lowered after adjustment and\nthat were not statistically significant. Most antibiotic use\ncorded as occurring at the time of ED presentation. Each\ngroup had 2 patients not currently taking antibiotics, hav-\ning discontinued using these medications within 48 hours\nof ED visitation. Therefore, neither group had discon-\ntinued any listed antibiotics more than 48 hours before\nED presentation.\nTable 3 represents the relation between intussus-\nception and use of antibiotics by class using adjusted\nORs. Classes were not mutually exclusive owing to a few\nclass combination products (eg, erythromycin and\nsulfisoxazole). The -lactam medication class, includ-\ning penicillins and cephalosporins, was the most com-\nmonly used subclass for cases and controls. The risk of\nintussusception was more than 20-fold higher among us-\nA significantly increased risk was also found for penicil-\nOtitis media was the most common indication for\nantibiotic drug use in cases and controls, composing 52%\nand 61% of all types of indications, respectively.

Other\nindications listed were fever (1 case), urinary tract re-\nflux (1 case), postlaceration repair (1 case), sickle cell\nprophylaxis (1 control), and stomach virus (1 control).\nFor GI indications, emesis (10 cases) and gastroesopha-\ngeal reflux (2 cases and 8 controls) each accounted for\n40% of all indication types. Diarrhea (1 case and 1 con-\ntrol) accounted for 8% of all GI indications, and \"other\"\n(3 cases) accounted for the remaining 12%.\nFor the group of children younger than 4 years pre-\nsenting to the ED with primary idiopathic intussuscep-\ntion, the risk attributable to antibiotic use was 18.7%. This\nestimate was based on a RR of 4.15 and a proportion of\ntibiotic use among American children during the 2 weeks\nbefore interview was approximately 10.7%, which is simi-\nlar to that of the study control group. Use of -lactam\nantibiotics from the NHANES III external analysis was\n8.3%. Therefore, use of antibiotics in our series of intus-\nsusception cases was 2.3 times higher compared with the\nage-standardized NHANES III data.\nCOMMENT\nPrevious case series have evaluated the descriptive epi-\ndemiologiccharacteristicsofintussusception.11-13 Thefind-\nings of the intussusception cases in our study are simi-\nlar to those of previous studies14,15 with respect to age and\nsex. Although some studies16,17 have reported little sea-\nsonal variation, most18,19 have reported peaks during the\nspring and early summer, which is consistent with our\ndata showing a slight increase in the second quarter\n(April-June). We noted no significant differences be-\ntween cases and controls regarding chronic underlying\nconditions, immunization status, insurance type, his-\ntory of prematurity, allergies to medications, or mean age\n(in months).\nThis study found an independent association of\nintussusception with antibiotic use. The association of\nantibiotics with intussusception became somewhat stron-\nger when the OR was adjusted for use of GI medications,\nindicating that the association cannot be explained by con-\nfounding by use of GI medications. The strong associa-\ntion of GI medications with intussusception was ex-\npected, considering the presenting clinical symptoms of\nabdominal pain and emesis that occur with significant fre-\nquency before proper diagnosis.1 We also directly ana-\nlyzed the indication for antibiotic use before ED admis-\nsion as it was abstracted from the medical records. No\nindications for antibiotic use were for GI symptoms or di-\nagnosis; in fact, most were otitis media and upper respi-\nratory tract infection related. These results provide fur-\nther evidence that antibiotic use preceded intussusception\nand are consistent with national data indicating that acute\notitis media and upper respiratory tract infections are the\nprincipal diagnoses for US physician visits.8\nOf the various antibiotic classes, the -lactams were\nfound in this study to be significantly associated with in-\ntussusception. Users of cephalosporins had more than a\nated with a significantly higher OR (OR, 3.14; 95% CI,\nviously to cause small-bowel disturbances. Caron et al20\ndemonstrated in humans that amoxicillin\u00adclavulanate po-\ntassium increases the amplitude and duration of duodenal-\njejunal contractions. -Lactams interact directly with the\npostsynaptic -aminobutyric acid receptors in the cen-\ntral nervous system,21 with such receptors additionally\nfound in the mesenteric plexus.22 A potential mecha-\nnism of -lactam class small intestine dysmotility may\nthen be -aminobutyric acid, induced either directly or\nindirectly with administration of this drug class. Eryth-\nromycin, a macrolide class antibiotic, is a known moti-\nlin receptor agonist and inducer of the migrating motor\ncomplex in the human GI tract,23,24 which as a promo-\ntility agent is a potential mechanism to induce intussus-\nception. Our hypothetical model, therefore, suggests an-\ntibiotic dysmotility as a variable factor in the development\nof intussusception. The exposure window of all antibi-\notics recorded was taken currently or within 48 hours\nof ED presentation. As the half-life of the various anti-\nit is possible that the antibiotic dysmotility effects may\nhave lasted from hours to days depending on the spe-\ncific antibiotic used.\nThe major limitation of this study is the retrospec-\ntive nature of medical record analysis. Handwritten medi-\ncal record information is potentially not accurate, poorly\ninterpretable, or noninclusive. Emergency department rec-\nords reviewed during the study were noncomputer-\nized and were not dictated. The data abstractor was not\nmasked to the study design or hypothesis. To improve\nthe accuracy of results and minimize inconsistencies of\nrecord review, the following procedures were used: the\nabstractor was trained before study inception; explicit pro-\ntocols were used to describe the criteria for case selec-\ntion and exclusion; standardized abstraction forms for\ncases and controls were applied; periodic meetings were\nheld during study abstraction to review and monitor cod-\ning protocols; and a second reviewer was used to ran-\ndomly reabstract 10% of all medical records and data en-\ntries to determine interrater reliability for each abstraction\nstep. Interrater variability was low (6.1% for medical rec-\nord abstraction and 0.4% for data entry). Another po-\ntential bias may be the differing nature of information\nobtained between cases and controls. Intussusception\nrecords may have been more complete with respect to\nrecording antibiotic use compared with injury control\nrecords, as many of these children were preoperative dur-\ning the ED course. In addition, all recorded medication\nuse was abstracted with standardized ED records for cases\nand controls, which may minimize this potential bias.\nOutpatient injuries were selected as controls par-\nticularly to determine the prevalence of antibiotic use in\nthe general population at the time of matched case di-\nagnosis. We believe that outpatient injuries are the hos-\npital-based series that best represents the general popu-\nlation of children in our area. In addition, potential\nconfounders such as insurance type and chronic condi-\ntions were tested in multiple logistic regression models\nbut were found not to affect the association between in-\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

Although the NHANES III analysis pertains to a\ntion (United States vs Alabama), and estimates of use of\nmedication in NHANES III was based on a calculated use\nduring the 2 weeks before interview compared with cur-\nrent use in our study subjects, the concordance of anti-\nbiotic use between NHANES III data and our control\nseries provides external validation to our results.\nIntussusception as an entity diagnosis has many eti-\nologies. In older children and adults, a pathologic, well-\ndefined lead point is usually discovered, such as lym-\nphoma, Meckel's diverticulum, or intestinal polyposis.1\nIn the infant and toddler age groups, multiple viral in-\nfections have been implicated as these agents have been\nrecovered from intestinal lymphoid tissue at the site of\nintussusception.26 Adenovirus has been found in up to\n50% of intussusception appendixes, significantly higher\nthan in control populations.27 Lymphoid hyperplasia may\nbe responsible for the actual lead point in primary idio-\npathicintussusception,butthisdoesnotexplainwhysome\ninfants develop the condition and others do not despite\nexposure to similar environmental conditions, includ-\ning potentially causative viral agents. In addition, it has\nbeen suggested that anatomic or genetic predisposition\nmay play an important role, as siblings of patients with\nintussusception have a reported 15- to 20-fold increase\nin incidence compared with the general population.17\nPrompted by a frequent history of mild upper respi-\nratory tract symptoms preceding the development of in-\ntussusception, physicians suggested a potential role for in-\nfection decades before the identification of adenovirus.11\nIn the United States, pediatricians and family physicians\ncommonly prescribe antibiotics for viral conditions in chil-\ndren28 despite consistent evidence that antimicrobial\ntherapy has no role in their treatment. Therefore, one ex-\nplanationfortheantibiotic-intussusceptionassociationthat\nwe found may not be causality but confounding by viral\ninfection. Conversely, antibiotics are known to alter gut\nmotility,9 and, under certain conditions, these drug-\ninduced changes may contribute to the development of\nintussusception. Antibiotics have been implicated in other\nGI pathophysiologic states, such as hemolytic uremic syn-\ndrome,29 irritable bowel syndrome,30 and a more recently\ndescribed relationship between infantile hypertrophic\npyloric stenosis and erythromycin therapy.31\nWe hypothesize that intussusception is a multivar-\niate process that, in young children, may involve a com-\nplex interdependent progression of lymphoid hyperpla-\nsia combined with dysmotility, induced by the viral agent\nitself, the use of antibiotics, or other as yet unidentified\nfactors, all or some of which may include the release of\nlocal inflammatory mediators. According to a mouse\nmodel for intussusception developed by Nissan et al,7 in-\ntraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharides may in-\nteract with other potent inflammatory mediators such as\nnitric oxide, ultimately increasing rates of intussuscep-\ntion above baseline. Therefore, the process of intussus-\nception development is most likely a dynamic entity and\nmay involve a series of cellular and intracellular events\nfor intestinal invagination to occur, with an increased like-\nlihood in individuals with an anatomic or familial pre-\ndisposition.16 Although the exact cellular and biochemi-\ncal mechanisms are not clearly defined, antibiotic therapy,\nviral processes, or both may contribute individually or\nby additive effect to induce intussusception. Although\nthis study found an independent association between an-\ntibiotic use and intussusception, further research is nec-\nessary to determine causality.\nThis study was supported in part by the National In-\nstitutes of Health Short Term Student Training in Health\nsity of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.\nThis study was presented in part at the Pediatric Aca-\ndemic Societies Meeting, Baltimore, Md, May 4, 2002.\nWe thank the medical records department at the Chil-\ndren's Hospital of Alabama for their tremendous support dur-\ning the study; Carden Johnston, MD, Pete Glaeser, MD, and\nKathy Monroe, MD, for their careful review of the manu-\nscript;andCathrynPowers,BS,forherdiligentworkinmedi-\ncal abstraction.\nCorresponding author and reprints: David M.
