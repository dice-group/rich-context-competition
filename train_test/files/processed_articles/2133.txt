    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite a growing diabetes crisis, the nonmedical implications\nfor young adults have gone virtually unexplored. We investigated the\neffects of diabetes on two key outcomes for this age group--schooling and\nearnings--and found that it delivers an increasingly common \"health\nshock\" to both. We identified effects in several measures of educational\nattainment, including a high school dropout rate that was six percentage\npoints higher than among young adults without the disease. We also\nfound lower employment and wages: A person with diabetes can\nconservatively expect to lose more than $160,000 over his or her working\nlife, compared to a peer without the disease. For young adults with\ndiabetes, having a parent with diabetes also leads to poorer outcomes\nthan if one more parents do not have the disease--for example, reducing\nthe likelihood of attending college by four to six percentage points, even\nafter the child's health status is controlled for. These results highlight the\nurgency of attacking this growing health problem, as well as the need for\nmeasures such as in-school screening for whether diabetes's impact on\nindividual learning and performance begins before the classic\nmanifestations of clinical diabetes appear.\nThe United States continues to be\nenmeshed in a chronic disease\ncrisis. Major contributors to the\nproblem are obesity and its con-\nsequences, including diabetes. Cur-\nrently, diabetes affects more than twenty-three\nmillion people, or just under 8 percent of the US\npopulation.1,2 Its prevalence continues to swell as\nit tracks the commensurate rise in obesity.3\u00ad8\nMoreover, America's children appear to be in-\ncreasingly affected by both obesity and\nThese trends have not gone unnoticed. A\nlarge literature has been devoted to the eco-\nsmaller but burgeoning field devoted to diabe-\ntes.15\u00ad19 Much of this prior work demonstrates\nincreases in medical care use and spending in\ntandem with the growing burdens of these two\nsequences are also important to consider.\nIn conducting this study, our objective was to\nproduce new estimates of the nonmedical eco-\nnomic burden for the young adult population.\nSpecifically, we aimed to elucidate some of the\neducational and labor-market outcomes associ-\nated with having diabetes and, in so doing, pro-\nduce a picture of the short- and long-term eco-\nnomic effects of developing diabetes in\nadolescence or early adulthood.\nAlthough we are not the first to explore these\nissues, our work has several unique character-\nistics that complement previous analyses. Two\nprominent points of departure relate to the age\ngroups and structure of our data set. Whereas\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nJason M.

Because the tim-\ning of the nonmedical effects of diabetes has not\nbeen the focus of previous literature, the eco-\nnomicconsequences of diabetes for young adults\nis both an understudied and a potentially impor-\ntant aspect for research and policy making.\nConsistent with prior literature, we found\nmeaningful, negative effects of diabetes on years\nof schooling and various employment outcomes\nfor people diagnosed fairly early in life. We also\nhighlight the importance of addressing con-\nfounding factors--such as environmental influ-\nences--that increase both disease risk and the\nlikelihood of poor adult outcomes.\nOn average, the high school dropout rate\namong people with diabetes is approximately\nsix percentage points higher than the rate\namong people who do not have the disease. This\ndifference is larger than the black-white and\nmale-female differences in the general popula-\ntion and tracks the effects of childhood atten-\ntion-deficit hyperactivity disorder.25 By age\nthirty, a person with diabetes can expect a ten-\npercentage-point reduction in the likelihood of\nbeing employed and annual earnings penalties\nof up to $6,000 when employed. Equally impor-\ntant, our results demonstrate that the con-\nsequences of diabetes can manifest themselves\nearly in life, with implications for the future of\nthe individual patient and society.\nStudy Data And Limitations\nData We used data from the National Longitudi-\nnal Study of Adolescent Health, which was con-\nducted by researchers at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill. This study was first\nschool-based study of the health-related behav-\niors of adolescents and their effects in young\nadulthood. Data were collected in four waves\nof in-home interviews.Wave 1 sampled students\nlowed up with interviews of the same students\nlowed over the four waves. By wave 4, the respon-\ndents were on average nearly thirty years old.\nThus, the survey offers a unique window onto\nthe potential accumulation of economic burden\nas children and adolescents transition into\nadulthood.\nAll four waves of the survey collected data on a\nvariety of health conditions, such as obesity,\nsymptoms of depression, and low birthweight.\nHowever, information on self-reported diabetes\nstatus was not collected until wave 4. The key\nquestion posed to respondents in that wave\nwas, \"Has a doctor, nurse, or other health care\nprovider ever told you that you have or had high\nblood sugar or diabetes?\" Those answering yes\nfor either condition were also asked for their age\nWe compared the outcomes of respondents\nwith self-reported diabetes to those of their peers\nwho did not report havingthe disease.Because of\ndata limitations, we are unable to confidently\ndifferentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nKey adult outcomes include the educational\nand labor-market outcomes collected at wave\n4. Educational outcomes include self-reports of\ncompleted years of schooling, high school drop-\nout status, and college attendance. Labor-market\noutcomes include self-reported employment sta-\ntus; annual earnings; participation in a social\nprogram such as welfare, public housing, and\nfood stamp assistance;27,28 and any health-related\nabsences from work within the previous month.\nStrengths Of The Data As noted elsewhere,29\na strength of panel data such as those in this\nsurvey--particularly in the context of studying\ndiabetes--is that the data allow researchers to\ncontrol for environmental and circumstantial\ninfluences that could otherwise confound a\nstudy's results. In other words, we aimed to ac-\ncount for external factors to the best of our abil-\nity, thus preventing them from contaminating\nour estimated effects.\nUnlike many surveys, the National Longitudi-\nnal Study of Adolescent Health allows consider-\nation of several important influences, including\na broad set of potential comorbidities (for exam-\nple, obesity measures at fourdifferent times) and\nfamily background factors (for example, paren-\ntal education attainment, income, and diabetes\nand obesitystatus). Inaddition,theschool-based\nstudy design allows the comparison of high\nschool classmates so that common influences--\nsuch as local labor-market factors, school qual-\nity, peer groups, and environmental health haz-\nards--can be held constant in the analysis.30\nWe used these data features to estimate the\nstatistically adjusted differences in adult out-\ncomes between people diagnosed with diabetes\nand those without that diagnosis. We demon-\nstrated the importance of controlling for these\nfactors by contrasting three types of models:\nbaseline statistical models with limited control\nvariables; models that use a broader set of con-\nOverview Of The Crisis\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, the absence of such a\ndistinction should not be considered a major\nproblem. Commonalities between the two types\ncontinue to emerge as clinical knowledge of dia-\nther blur the line between the two, if in fact one\nAdditionally, the outcomes that we investi-\ngated should be widespread among people with\ndiabetes. Nonetheless, future data sources\ncapable of credibly distinguishing between the\ntwo types may identify differences in their effects\nand causal mechanisms.\nStudy Results\nUsing the weighted wave 4 data yields a diabetes\nprevalence rate of 2.6 percent, which tracks\nother estimates for a comparable age group.15\nExhibit 1 shows selected characteristics of our\nsample. For each analysis, we incorporated the\nwave 4 survey weights to produce nationally\nrepresentative estimates. We clustered our re-\ngression standard errors at the high school level\nto account for any within-school correlation in\nunobserved characteristics. Complete details on\nthe estimation procedure and full results from\neach empirical model are available in the online\nEducation Effects Our study supports the\nsearch design and data indicate declines in edu-\ncation, employment, and earnings for those di-\nagnosed with diabetes during their adolescent or\nearly adulthood years. Exhibit 2 outlines the\nnexus of our schooling results and incorporates\nseveral strategies to address concerns about po-\ntential confounding at the individual, family,\nand community levels.\nWhen controlling for basic demographic fac-\ntors, we found that respondents with diabetes\ncompleted 0.675 fewer years of schooling than\ntheir peers whodid nothavediabetes. This differ-\nence shrank by 22 percent when we controlled\nfor family background. It shrank by a further\n15 percent when we controlled for comorbid\nobesity status and another 7 percent when we\ncontrolled for the following additional prevalent\ncomorbid illnesses: attention deficit hyperactiv-\nity disorder, depression, and asthma.\nFurthermore,wefoundan additional3percent\nreduction when we controlled for parents' dia-\nbetes and obesity and another 16 percent reduc-\ntion when we controlled for childhood environ-\nmental confounding factors. All told, we reduced\nthe educational difference by 62 percent of the\nbaseline estimates, which indicates that our es-\ntimates in the final column probably best reflect\nthe direct effect of diabetes.\nEven with modifications for potential con-\nCharacteristics Of The Study Sample, Impact Of Diabetes On Young Americans\nCharacteristic\nPercent/mean (standard\ndeviation)\nRace/ethnicity\nHealth information\nEducation\nEmployment/social program statusa\nAbsent from work in previous month for health\nFamily information\nParents' health information\nMissing parents' health informationd 0.206\nSOURCE Authors' analysis.

For exam-\nple, this difference is nearly twice the magnitude\nof the black-white schooling disparity in our\ndata.

We first show reductions in employment of\n8\u00ad11 percentage points among people with dia-\nbetes.We also found an increase of 8\u00ad13 percent-\nage points in participation in social programs.\nFor respondents with jobs, we found increases of\n10 percentage points in the likelihood of re-\nported absences due to health problems.We also\nfound reductions in yearly earnings of $1,500\u00ad\n6,000. Importantly, statistically addressing con-\nfounding reduced the associations for labor-\nThere is a close and complex relationship be-\ntween work, health insurance, and medical care.\nWe attempted to disentangle these interactions\nto some degree by examining the differential\nimpacts of diabetes on wages based on health\ninsurance coverage and type. We stratified our\nanalyses by type of insurance coverage at wave 4.\nAmong people with private insurance, those\nwith diabetes were more likely than their peers\nwithout diabetes to report having been absent\nfrom work in the previous month because of\nhealth (Exhibit 4). This is not the case for people\nwho report having no health insurance. In addi-\ntion, only among people with private health in-\nsurance did we find evidence of an earnings dis-\nadvantage for diabetes.35\nAdditional Consequences Of Diabetes Our\nanalysis so far has considered only the short-\nterm implications of diabetes for a population\nof young adults.We next outline longer-term and\nintergenerational effects that should be ad-\ndressed in future research.\nAssuming that the annual wage effects remain\nconstant as people age, we extrapolated our re-\nsults to obtain an estimate of the lifetime earn-\nings penalty from diabetes. Assuming a forty-\nyear working life, this figure would be\ndents were about age thirty in wave 4, they had\nnot reached their peak earning potential. Thus,\nthis figure is probably an underestimate.28\nIntergenerational effects are another conse-\nquence of diabetes. Prior research on other\nhealth outcomes has typically taken the ap-\nproach of assessing whether or not parents\nand children share similar health profiles be-\ncause of mechanisms such as genetics, environ-\nment, and health behaviors, singly or in combi-\nnation.29 Our preliminary analysis--which we\nplan to expand in future research--is unique\nin its finding that young adults whose parents\nhad diabetes have poorer outcomes than their\npeers whose parents did not have the disease.\nFor example, we found that having a parent\nwith diabetes reduced thelikelihood of attending\ncollege by four to six percentage points, even\nwhen the child's health status was controlled\nfor. Similarly, we found that having a father with\ndiabetes reduced the likelihood of employment\nat age thirty by approximately seven percentage\npoints (datanot shown). These results imply that\ndiabetes has important and previously unexam-\nined consequences that should be the subject of\nfuture work.\nDiscussion\nDiabetes has a marked effect on educational and\nlabor-market outcomes. Moreover, there is evi-\ndence that many of the negative effects are felt\nearly in life. By age thirty, many people with\ndiabetes are already on a lower employment tra-\njectory--in part because of reduced education--\nwhich paints a sobering picture for a nation with\na growing burden of disease.\nAlthough our data do not allow us to probe\nfurther into the mechanisms driving our results,\nseveral potential causes might well explain some\nof these relationships.\nLower Earnings Other researchers have em-\npirically documented similar earning and em-\nployment reductions for people with diabetes\nand have often framed the reductions within a\nAssociations Between Diabetes Diagnosis And Work Absences And Earnings, By Health Insurance Status\nInsurance status\nEffect of diabetes on: All respondents No insurance Private insurance Medicaid\nSOURCE Authors' analysis.

Equally, it could\ndilute an employer's willingness to invest in em-\nployees with diabetes if they were expected to\nhave more absences or lower productivity than\nother employees.22 In either scenario, the em-\nployee with diabetes is presumed to have inferior\npotential or productivity and is consequently\npenalized in wages.\nAlternatively, employment-sponsored health\ninsurance might play one or more roles in this\ncontext. For people diagnosed with diabetes dur-\ning their working years, the \"job lock\" phenome-\nnon--in which workers fear losing health insur-\nance if they seek better-paying jobs--might be\npartly responsible for their lower earnings.28 In\naddition, obesity has been shown to independ-\nently lower a person's earnings when an em-\nployer attempts to offset expected future in-\ncreases in the cost of medical care pertaining\nto obese employees.10 Considering the high\nmedical spending for people with diabetes, em-\nployers might engage in similar behavior specifi-\ncally for this group.\nAlthough the results shown in Exhibit 4 can-\nnot disentangle these respective influences, we\ndid find that the effects on work absences and\nearningswereprimarily concentratedamongthe\nprivately insured. This suggests that at least a\nportion of the medical and productivity-related\ncosts of diabetes are passed down to the em-\nployee through lower wages. However, we can-\nnot rule out possible contributions from \"job\nlock\" and unobserved employment characteris-\ntics, such as having a sedentary job.\nLower Education Poor health might play a\ndecisive role in lower educational attainment,\nwhich in turn might influence a person's eco-\nnomic circumstances in adulthood.36 For exam-\nple, the impact of diabetes on a young person's\nhealth might lower the financial returns on edu-\ncational investments or simply make learning\nmore of a struggle. In any case, the negative\neffect of diabetes on educational attainment\ncould compromise success in the labor market.\nFor instance, high school and college graduates\nearn 1.5 and 2.7 times more than high school\ndropouts, respectively.34\nIntergenerational Effects The negative\nconsequences of having a parent with diabetes\nare novel findings. Similar to their peers with\ndiabetes, people whose parents have the disease\nexperience reductions in education and employ-\nment outcomes. Although these results are in-\ntriguing and important, their underlying causes\nare not immediately obvious. A possible explan-\nation is that diabetes in one generation confers a\nlower genetic endowment on the next genera-\ntion. Another possibility is that parents with dia-\nbetes might have fewer financial resources and\nless time to spend on their children because they\nare forced to devote so much money and time to\nmanaging their disease. These hypotheses are\nnot mutually exclusive.\nNotwithstanding the difficulties in empirically\ndisentangling these relationships, this should be\na focus of future work. More important, if the\nintergenerational consequences are real and sus-\ntained, prior estimates of the true costs of dia-\nbetes to society are too low.\nPolicy Implications Because the drivers and\nconsequences of diabetes are manifold, so too\nare the policy prescriptions. A few policy consid-\nerations emerge from our study.\nFirst, greater emphasis should be placed on\nthe near-term effects of diabetes, as opposed\nto the more publicized long-term consequences.\nPrevention, especially for children, might take\non a renewed urgency for parents and other\nstakeholders once they become aware of how\nsoon the effects of diabetes emerge and how\nprofound the impact is later in life.\nSecond, researchers should attempt to identify\nand study children of parents with diabetes with\nan eye toward isolating the potential economic\nand educational spillover effects on the next gen-\neration. Given the unyielding rise of diabetes and\nobesity among the population as a whole, the\npotential of diabetes to strike in one generation\nand then have negative effects on the next--aside\nfrom any additional risk for the disease--is a\ncause for alarm.\nExperts in the diabetes field have voiced con-\ncerns over the number of people with diabetes\nwho might be undiagnosed. This problem con-\nstitutes an important concern for the school-age\npopulation.3 In light of our results, a stronger\npush for in-school screening efforts might be\nwarranted, especially if the impact of diabetes\non individual learning and performance begins\nbefore the classic manifestations of clinical dia-\nbetes appear. Waiting until the onset of clinical\nsymptoms may be too late if we hope to mitigate\nor reverse the negative impacts of the disease on\nhuman capital and workplace success.\nConclusion\nEstimates of the total annual costs of diabetes in\nthe United States range from tens of billions of\ndollars two decades ago to $200 billion in recent\nrelated medical spending is more than $100 bil-\nlion dollars per year.12\nTaken together, obesity and diabetes re-\npresent a severe burden on the US health care\nsector as well as on the larger economy.

The early effects on education and wages can\nerode future health, which could leave people\nwith diabetes trapped in an unpleasant spiral.\nAs we have shown, diabetes delivers an in-\ncreasingly common health shock to American\nadolescents and young adults, leading to lower\neducational attainment and shrinking earnings\nand chances of employment. A person with dia-\nbetes can conservatively expect to lose more than\nto a peerwithout the disease. Moreover, thelarge\neffects on the high school dropout rate could\ntranslate into an additional $10 billion in societal\ncosts in this cohort of young adults. \nJason Fletcher thanks the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation Health and Society\nScholars Program for its financial\nsupport.
