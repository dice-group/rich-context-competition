    "reduced_content": "This article will present the impact that political theory has made and the opportunities for future contributions.\nIt will consider the contributions made by leading political theorists to policy debates, the lessons learned from\ntheir successes, and how political theorists might further pursue existing and new opportunities to develop impact.\nThe discussion will close with consideration of several potential threats that theorists should become more aware\nof in order to best avoid them. The growing importance of impact in British higher education policy represents\nimportant challenges that may help promote the field of political theory. Political theorists should welcome these\ndevelopments.\nKeywords: higher education; impact; political thought; public policy; stakeholding\nA common misperception is that the so-called `impact agenda' in British higher education\nis a major problem for colleagues working in the sub-field of political theory.The concern\nis that political theory is by its nature abstract and often thought to be substantially\nimpractical. Political theorists more readily apply themselves to the consideration of ideas,\nbut not always their relation to practice.The problem is that it has become more common\nto require evidence of research impact in funding applications and research assessments of\ndepartments. Political theorists are disadvantaged by this development and the impact\nagenda may threaten its future.\nThis view rests on a deep misunderstanding about the relation between ideas and\npractices. Political theorists should welcome the impact agenda not least because the\nsub-field should benefit from the impact that political theory may \u00ad and often does \u00ad\npossess. I offer a defence of political theory and its impact in this contribution. I will argue\nthat the primary obstacle for political theorists is overcoming scepticism about the kind\nof impact theorists may offer. The issue is not about whether political theorists create\nimpact, but rather the kinds of impact we should expect from political theorists.\nA Chequered Past?\nIt is curious that any misperception about the impact of political theory has taken hold\ngiven the long history of impact-rich political engagement by theorists over the centuries.\nExamples abound. Several political theorists from antiquity had influence that many today\nmight only dream of. Consider Aristotle and his pupil Alexander the Great with his later\nempire or Seneca and Imperial Rome with its powerful legacy. We owe much today to\nthese figures from antiquity, but the influence of political theorists continues in modern\nhistory, too. For example, John Locke's (2004) Second Treatise of Government had a par-\nticularly profound impact on the founders of the United States, such as Thomas Jefferson,\nand became a cornerstone for much natural rights jurisprudence. Or consider Immanuel\nKant's (1957) Perpetual Peace and its contribution to establishing the League of Nations,\nbs_bs_banner\n\u00a9 2013 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2013 Political Studies Association\na precursor to the United Nations. My brief survey is not intended to claim that the only\nimpact we should expect from political theorists must be at the level of Aristotle, Seneca,\nLocke or Kant. Instead, my discussion aims only to confirm that many political theorists\nhave demonstrated profound impact on how we are governed and perhaps the lenses\nthrough which we view ourselves socially and culturally. Therefore, the question is not\nwhether political theorists create impact, but what kinds of impact we should expect.\nMany political theorists have contributed to a chequered history which may have led\nto scepticism about the value of their impact. Again, there is little disagreement about the\nfact of impact: the issue is about the kinds of impact we find. For example, the great\nmajority of canonical figures in political theory \u00ad including Plato, Augustine, Aquinas,\nMachiavelli, Hobbes, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche and many others \u00ad did not defend democ-\nracy as the most superior form of government (Brooks, 2006a).While Aristotle taught a\nyoung Alexander the Great, Plato's students included the future tyrant Dionysius II of\nSyracuse. Plato's powerful arguments in support of a government ruled by philosopher-\nkings and not elected leaders is more often cited as evidence for the danger of his ideas\nrather than as a case of promising future impact (see Brooks, 2006b; 2008). Plato, along\nwith Hegel and Marx, has also been (falsely) accused of providing philosophical justifi-\nScepticism about the value of political theory's impact is perhaps exacerbated by other\nhigh-profile cases. One important illustration is Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1995) and his\nbrilliant treatise, The Prince.This work exhibits a wide range of political insight and critical\nperspective, but is too often associated with the `dark arts' of politics, and so has become\na tome rendered both illuminating and almost dangerous at once (see Powell, 2011). So\nwe might accept that his work produces impact that may have real practical usefulness, but\nsome may still question whether its advice lies beyond the horizon of acceptable modern\npolitics.To be clear, such critics misunderstand Machiavelli's work. Nonetheless, the point\nthis raises is that it is perhaps not enough that political theorists demonstrate impact\nbecause they face an additional hurdle about the value of their impact. If their leading\nfigures support objectionable (and perhaps odious) political institutions, then what useful\npractical instruction might contemporary political theorists still provide? Thus, even if we\nclarify existing norms that might guide combatant conduct in just wars (McMahan, 2009)\nor provide a new understanding about punishment that illuminates a new approach to\nmodern sentencing (Brooks, 2012a), perhaps there will remain this question about its\nvalue for many in light of the popular scepticism arising from political theory's chequered\npast.\nPolitical theory has a long and controversial record of genuinely substantial and\nsignificant contributions of lasting merit to politics and public policy. But what is the state\nof play today? I will now turn our attention to how many political theorists have been\ncreating impact and the value this work has for politics and public policy.\nPolitical Thought: Creating Impact\nPolitical theorists generate impact in three broad ways: our thinking about politics, our\nthinking about public policy more broadly, and through public engagement. I shall address\neach in turn. First, political theorists create impact on our thinking about politics. This\n\u00a9 2013 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2013 Political Studies Association\nimpact is found across several levels. One level is the realm of political decision making.\nSeveral significant political theorists of distinction have become Members of the House\nof Lords, including Onora O'Neill, Bhikhu Parekh and Raymond Plant. Each has a voice\nin parliamentary affairs where their political expertise may more directly impact upon\ngovernment policies. Furthermore, each has contributed enormously to the intellectual\ntenor of parliamentary debates \u00ad consider O'Neill's speeches on autonomy, consent and\neducation as well as Parekh's speeches on community, multiculturalism and political justice\n\u00ad and beyond to issues of medical ethics, multiculturalism and religious toleration (Manson\ncant contributions, helping to clarify and reconfigure our understanding about autonomy\nand consent, the nature of democratic governance, the foundations of our multiple iden-\ntities and issues pertaining to political authority,as well as religious toleration and reasonable\nThe second broad way in which political theory creates impact is related to the first\nand concerns our thinking about public policy more broadly (Smits, 2009; Wolff, 2011).\nDistinctive contributions include work on ethics and public health policy, including issues\nconcerning the challenges posed by great disparities in global health inequalities (Lenard\nand Straehle, 2012). Climate scientists help us understand the evidence for climate\nchange, but not the normative justification for choosing particular policy solutions.\nPolitical theorists have helped lead the way in creative practical work on how we should\nunderstand the challenges presented by climate change and what future policies are most\nis also significant work in the area of criminal justice and punishment where political\ntheorists have made important contributions to the importance of restorative justice in\nThese first two ways in which political theorists create impact has real value for how\nwe understand politics and might improve public policies. The tools of the political\ntheorists' trade are rich conceptual analysis and analytical rigour which illuminate the\ngrammar of our political understanding and draw greater attention to inconsistencies of\nboth practice and principle. Political theorists perform more roles than helping us to\nunderstand politics and public policy, but they actively contribute to improving our\nknowledge about how institutions and policies work and how they might be improved.\nThus, contemporary political theorists promise both impact and practical value which\nshould overcome the popular scepticism owing far more to disagreement with the past\nthan the present.\nFinally, political theorists create impact through public engagement. Perhaps the most\nwidely recognised illustration comprises the popular lectures on justice by Michael\nSandel. His later Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do? has exposed to new audiences\nsubstantial research into the idea of political justice and what it means for most citizens\n(Sandel, 2010). Similarly, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's Nudge has caught the\nimagination of the public and influential policy makers while rekindling interest in the\npotential promise of applying insights from behavioural economics to everything from\ngovernment policy to everyday life (Thaler and Sunstein, 2009).\n\u00a9 2013 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2013 Political Studies Association\nThese examples are perhaps few and high profile, but others are no less important. For\nexample, there is a real and growing appetite for engagement with ethics and political\nideas which should be welcomed \u00ad and where political theorists have helped play an\nactive role. Groups such as the Caf\u00e9 Philosophique and Sceptics Club have sprung up\nacross many parts of the United Kingdom, bringing together leading figures in political\ntheory with a popular audience to address critically pressing issues of common concern.\nThis year Newcastle upon Tyne will host its second annual Festival of Philosophy with\nacademic talks open to the public over two weeks. Such activities are often overlooked in\nfavour of other engagement activities, such as public policy think tanks and political party\nconferences, where political theorists also actively contribute, but not exclusively so. My\npurpose is to draw greater attention to wider spheres of engagement where political\ntheorists create impact beyond the so-called `usual suspects' of seminar rooms and\npolicy-maker boardrooms.\nThe Impact Agenda\nSo it is clear that political theory has impact across several different areas as highlighted\nabove. A further issue is whether the impact that political theory demonstrates coheres\nwith the `impact agenda' now embedded within British higher education policy. The\nforthcoming Research Excellence Framework (REF2014) will include an assessment of\nresearch `impact'. This impact is to be assessed through narrative case studies describing\na maximum of 750 words and must refer to at least one or two `outputs' (including, but\nnot limited to, academic publications) produced by the submitting department (or `units\nof assessment'). Departments must produce roughly one impact case study for every ten\nfull-time academic staff (REF2014, 2011). This time frame may appear too brief, but it\nreflects the start of the current assessment period. Now that `impact' is a part of research\nassessment for the foreseeable future it would be surprising if the time frame was not\nextended much further in future.This might have been unfair to implement now because\nprevious research assessments did not require evidence of research impact.\nThe crucial distinctions concern how impact is defined and applied. REF2014 will\nconsider impact of many geographical types (local, regional, national, international) and\nbeneficiaries, such as the community, the environment, individuals and organisations\ncommunity is not necessarily inferior to impact on international organisations. Evidence\nmust be provided in the form of citations in public consultation documents or by\njournalists, citation by international bodies such as the UN or UNESCO, citation in\npolicy documentation, public debate in the media, media reviews, measures of improved\nwelfare or equality and documented evidence of influence on guidelines, legislation,\nImpact is divided into several spheres.The first comprises impacts on creativity, culture\nand society. This includes the production of television programmes, shaping public or\npolitical debate, improved access to justice and equal opportunities, enhanced understand-\ning of issues informing public attitudes or values, and influential contributions to cam-\npaigns for social, political and/or legal change. Examples from political theory are Sandel's\n\u00a9 2013 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2013 Political Studies Association\npopular book and television programmes on justice, and important work on social justice,\nsuch as Archon Fung's influential research on public policy and transparency and Martha\nNussbaum's illuminating work on lesbian and gay rights (Fung et al., 2007; Nussbaum,\nThe second sphere comprises economic, commercial and organisational impacts includ-\ning improvements in business governance and corporate social responsibility policies such\nas Will Hutton's well-known contributions on stakeholding and economic justice\n(Hutton, 1999; 2011). A third sphere comprises impacts on the environment, including\nimproved management or conservation of natural resources, environmental risk and\nimproved design or implementation of environmental policy. Political theorists have made\nnumerous contributions in this area, including critical examinations about carbon trading\nOne further sphere worth highlighting comprises impacts on public policy, law and\nservices. This includes changes to legislation or legislative practices, influence on regula-\ntion or access to justice, shaping or influencing policy made by government or private\norganisations, impact on democratic participation and `enabling a challenge to conven-\ntraditional understanding of impact \u00ad and in the wide sense of including challenges to\nreceived public understandings that might accommodate work focused on our knowledge\nabout intellectual history (Skinner, 1997) and contemporary policy debates (Sen, 1999).\nThe impact agenda of British higher education policy is not a threat to the future of\npolitical theory in Britain. First, the policy's understanding of impact across multiple\nspheres captures much, if not all, of the areas where political theory has had impact. Some\nspheres, such as impact on public policy or political debates, may be more readily achieved\nthan others. But political theory has impact and the forms it might take are captured by\nthe diverse ways in which impact will be assessed.\nSecond, impact is appropriate for all political theory. One possible concern is that the\nnew importance of impact for research assessment will incentivise less `blue skies' research\nand more short-term impact work. For example, blue skies research may often require\nmore time to generate impact. John Rawls' landmark A Theory of Justice was celebrated\nshortly after publication, but its lasting impact grew for many years afterwards, leading to\nthis work being understood today as one of the most important texts in political\nphilosophy, which continues to influence public policy debates (Rawls, 1971).The time\nframe for the REF2014 impact case studies is relatively brief, but again this is the case\nbecause there has not been a previous requirement for researchers to consider more\ncentrally the potential impact of their work. Now that impact has become embedded in\nresearch assessment expectations we should expect the horizon to expand, covering a\nlarger time frame in future. The impact agenda need not demand that all research\ndemonstrate immediate impacts because the time frame will likely change.\nA second potential worry is that the impact agenda will favour some forms of political\ntheory and not others. Political theorists are sometimes divided between those engaged in\nthe history of political ideas and others focused on contemporary debates. The concern\nis that impact will promote the latter at the expense of the former. So it is clear that the\nimpact agenda may benefit contemporary political theory focused on current problems,\n\u00a9 2013 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2013 Political Studies Association\nsuch as climate change or just war. Historians of political thought might also clearly\nbenefit from this agenda. Note that impact includes challenges to conventional wisdom,\nsuch as our common view about the influences on contemporary customs and practices,\nand also media presence.These are areas where intellectual historians may readily engage\nand create impact, too.\nBright Future\nThis article rejects the idea that political theory has something to fear from the impact\nagenda. In fact, this is something that all political theorists would do well to embrace.\nCritical engagement with practice is what much political theory is about at heart.The big\nchallenge for political theorists is not whether they have impact, but to overcome the\ntraditional popular scepticism about the value of the impact that political theorists might\noffer. Political theory is about much more than hypothetical thought experiments for\npeople who have never existed. On the contrary, it is a rich sub-field of our discipline,\nnot unlike others where impact is created for practical and popular benefit.\nI warmly welcome the impact agenda as an opportunity to be embraced which may\nhelp improve the public standing of political theory and draw greater attention to the\nmany contributions we offer.\nAbout the Author\n  is Reader in Law at   and is an associate member in Philosophy and a member\nof the Centre for Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, the Centre for the History of Political Thought and the\nHuman Rights Centre, as well as the Gender & Law at Durham research group.
