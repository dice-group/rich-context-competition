Cross-country comparison of\nsocial differences in illness provides\nsome insight into potential causal ex-\nplanations. Access to health care is a\nparticular case in point. Although pub-\nlicly funded health care is available in\nboth countries to citizens older than 65\nyears, the UK National Health Service\nhas no age criterion for eligibility. Thus,\nBritish households are more isolated\nfrom any financial impacts of out-of-\npocket medical expenses. A similar ar-\ngument applies to earnings and job\nlosses, for which the more generous UK\nincome maintenance system should\nmitigate any effects of health changes\non income and wealth there com-\npared with what is available in the\nUnited States.\nWe compare measures of morbidity\naccording to 2 salient measures of so-\ncioeconomic status (SES)--education\nand household income--in nationally\nrepresentative samples in the United\nStates and England.

This analysis is supplemented by samples of those aged 40 to 70 years from\ntain extensive and comparable biological disease markers on respondents, which are\nused to determine whether differential propensities to report illness can explain these\nhealth differences. To ensure that health differences are not solely due to health is-\nsues in the black or Latino populations in the United States, the analysis is limited to\nnon-Hispanic whites in both countries.\nMain Outcome Measure Self-reported prevalence rates of several chronic dis-\neases related to diabetes and heart disease, adjusted for age and health behavior risk\nfactors, were compared between the 2 countries and across education and income\nclasses within each country.\nResults The US population in late middle age is less healthy than the equivalent Brit-\nish population for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke,\nlung disease, and cancer. Within each country, there exists a pronounced negative so-\ncioeconomic status (SES) gradient with self-reported disease so that health disparities\nare largest at the bottom of the education or income variants of the SES hierarchy. This\nconclusion is generally robust to control for a standard set of behavioral risk factors, in-\ncluding smoking, overweight, obesity, and alcohol drinking, which explain very little of\nthese health differences. These differences between countries or across SES groups within\neach country are not due to biases in self-reported disease because biological markers\nof disease exhibit exactly the same patterns. To illustrate, among those aged 55 to 64\nyears, diabetes prevalence is twice as high in the United States and only one fifth of this\ndifference can be explained by a common set of risk factors. Similarly, among middle-\naged adults, mean levels of C-reactive protein are 20% higher in the United States com-\npared with England and mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are 14% lower.\nThese differences are not solely driven by the bottom of the SES distribution. In many\ndiseases, the top of the SES distribution is less healthy in the United States as well.\nConclusion Based on self-reported illnesses and biological markers of disease, US\nresidents are much less healthy than their English counterparts and these differences\nexist at all points of the SES distribution.\nlem with attempting international\nanalysis is the need to use self-\nreported morbidity measures and that\nmight result in international differ-\nences simply due to reporting or diag-\nnosis differences across countries. This\nstudy combines self-reported data with\nbiological data that suffer less from such\nambiguities.\nMETHODS\nData\nDespite the analytical advantages of\nmaking international health compari-\nsons, until recently good micro data\nmeasuring both SES and health in com-\nparable ways have not been available for\nboth countries. Fortunately, that prob-\nlem has been remedied with the field-\ning of 4 surveys--each designed to have\ncomparable measures of SES and\nself-reported and biological health\noutcomes.\nFor the United States, our study is\nbasedontheHealthandRetirementSur-\nvey (HRS), a nationally representative\nsurveythatcurrentlyincludesmorethan\nyears populations.2 The HRS began in\nsubsequently to maintain population\nrepresentation of this age segment and\nrespondents are reinterviewed biannu-\nally. To be comparable with the En-\nglish survey fielded in the same year, we\nBecause biological measures are un-\navailable in HRS, we use the most re-\ncent National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES), fielded\ncontains data obtained through per-\nsonal interviews, physical and labora-\ntory examinations (blood, urine, and\nswabs) for individuals aged 2 months\nensure that any differences between\ncountries that emerge are not due to\nspecial issues that exist in the black or\nHispanic communities in the United\nStates or the Asian and black immi-\ngrant communities in England, all data\nin our study are restricted to non-\nHispanic whites. Ethnicity was self-\nreported by the participants in each of\nthe 4 studies.\nFor England, we use the English Lon-\ngitudinal Survey of Aging (ELSA),\nrespondents recruited from 3 separate\nyears of the Health Survey for En-\ngland (HSE) survey providing a repre-\nsentative sample of the English popu-\nlation aged 50 years and older.4 The\nhealth data were supplemented by col-\nlection of social and economic data in\nLike HRS, follow-ups are every 2 years.\nThe authors of this article were in-\nvolved in the design and creation of\nHRS and ELSA, and we only selected\nkey health and SES constructs where\nstrong a priori comparability existed in\nmeasurement. The institutional re-\nview board of RAND approved our re-\nsearch project.\nBiological measures for England were\nThe survey protocols included an in-\nterview visit followed by a nurse visit\nwho collected saliva and blood samples.\nThe blood samples were analyzed for\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C), fibrinogen, C-reactive pro-\ntein, and glycosylated hemoglobin;\nmeasures also available in NHANES.\nMeasures of SES\nAll4surveysarecomparableintheirSES\nmeasurement with each containing in-\ndividual attributes such as age, sex, race,\nethnicity, household income, and edu-\ncation. The quality of the SES baseline\ndata are high.3 Two key SES measures\nused are years of schooling and house-\nholdincome,eachdividedinto3groups.\nIn the United States, education is sepa-\nrated into high school or less (0-12\nyears), more than high school but not a\ncollege graduate (13-15 years of school-\ning), and college or more (16 years).\nIn the United Kingdom the 3-way edu-\ncationdivisionisqualifiedtoalevellower\nthan \"O-level\" or equivalent (typically\n0-11 years of schooling), qualified to a\nlevel lower than \"A-level\" or equivalent\n(typically 12-13 years of schooling), and\na higher qualification (typically 13\nyears of schooling). In both countries,\nfamily income (adjusted for household\nsize) is divided into 3 equally sized in-\ncome tertiles so that one third of the\npopulation is in each group.\nTo eliminate the obvious effects of\nage on health, our HRS-ELSA compara-\ntive analysis is limited to those aged\nequate sample size, our NHANES-HSE\ncomparisons are carried out on respon-\nSelf-reported Measures of\nHealth Outcomes and Risk Factors\nAll 4 surveys collect data on indi-\nvidual self-reports of specific diseases\nof the general form: \"Did a doctor ever\ntell you that you had . . . ?\" The spe-\ncific diseases we analyzed are diabe-\ntes, hypertension, heart disease, myo-\ncardial infarction, stroke, chronic lung\ndiseases, and cancer. The HRS and\nELSA also collect several health-\nrelated behaviors that are in common\nincluding smoking (currently and ever\nsmoke), alcohol consumption (heavy\ndrinking defined as drinking 4 days\nper week in HRS and twice a day or\ndaily or almost daily in ELSA), and\nweight and height (so that body mass\nindex, obesity, and overweight can be\ncalculated; body mass index is calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by\nthe square of height in meters). Al-\nthough other risk factors may be im-\nportant, due to the comparative na-\nture of this research, we only used those\ncomparably measured in our data in\nboth countries.\nBiological Measures\nof Health Outcomes\nOur biological measures include plasma\nfibrinogen, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c\n), C-reactive protein, and\nHDL-C. In addition, respondents had\nexaminations during which their blood\npressure was taken. Such measures can\nbe used to validate respondents' self-\nreports of specific diseases. More spe-\ncifically, both NHANES and HSE re-\nspondents were evaluated for diabetes\nwith an HbA1c\ntest. Although not usu-\nally a screener for diabetes, HbA1c\nis\nhighly correlated with fasting plasma\nglucose levels. Although there is no\nstrict diagnosis threshold value, we fol-\nlowed the US convention by using val-\nues greater than or equal to 6.5% as in-\ndicating clinical diabetes. Our results\non intercountry and intracountry dif-\nferences are not sensitive to the spe-\ncific threshold chosen.\nFor hypertension, we follow the rec-\nommendations in the Sixth Report of\nthe Joint National Committee on the\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure of\nor greater than 140 mm Hg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure equal to or\ngreater than 90 mm Hg and/or taking\nmedication.6\nFor the 3 remaining biological mea-\nsures, there is no direct matching to re-\nspondent self-reports. The primary is-\nsue becomes whether variation in these\nbiological measures by SES and across\ncountries is similar to those obtained\nfor self-reports on heart diseases, for\nwhich these biological measures\nare well-established markers.7-9 C-\nreactive protein is separated into 3\ngroups (3 mg/L indicates high risk,\nbetween 1 but 3 is moderate risk, and\n1 is low risk). For fibrinogen, the nor-\nmg/dL is considered a high risk for heart\ndisease. Finally, we divide HDL-C lev-\nand 40 mg/dL (low). High-density li-\npoprotein cholesterol levels in our high-\nrange stratum are associated with re-\nduced risk of heart disease.3\nStatistical Methods\nIn HRS and ELSA, age-specific disease\nprevalence of diabetes, hypertension, all\nheart disease, myocardial infarction,\nstroke, lung disease, and cancer in both\ncountries is modeled as a function of\nthe 3 education and income indica-\ntors, sex, and indicators for smoking,\nalcohol consumption, overweight, and\nobesity using ordinary least squares re-\ngression (OLS) models and STATA sta-\ntistical software version 9.0SE (STATA\nCorp, College Station, Tex). All mod-\nels use the appropriate sample weights\nand all coefficients are allowed to dif-\nfer between England and the United\nStates. Our main conclusions are un-\nchanged if multiple logistic or multi-\nvariate probit models are used or if sepa-\nrate models are estimated for women\nand men. Tests of statistical signifi-\ncance between the countries are pro-\nvided in all Tables. P.05 was consid-\nered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nHealth Disparities Within\nand Between Countries\nFor England (using ELSA) and the\nUnited States (using HRS), TABLE 1 lists\nTable 1. Self-reported Health by Education and Income in England and the United States, Ages 55-64 Years*\nEngland United States\nLow Medium High Total Low Medium High Total\nYears of Schooling, Percent Distribution\nIncome, Percent Distribution\n*English data are from the first wave of English Longitudinal Survey of Aging, and US data are from the 2002 wave of the Health and Retirement Survey. Within each country, weekly\nfamily income adjusted for family size is divided into 3 equally sized income tertiles with one third of the weighted population in each group. In the United States, the range of the\nmiddle income group is $322-$635 while in England the range of the middle income group is \u00a3127-\u00a3241. In the United States, education is separated into high school or less\n(0-12 years), more than high school but not a college graduate (13-15 years), and college or more (16 years). In England the 3-way education division is qualified to a level lower\nthan \"O-level\" or equivalent (typically 0-11 years of schooling), qualified to a level lower than \"A-level\" or equivalent (typically 12-13 years), and a higher qualification (typically 13\nyears).

To en-\nsure that patterns are not confounded\nby age, comparisons are limited to those\nthis age span, the average age of both\nsamples is identical.\nThe total columns list rates of dis-\neaseprevalencebasedonindividualself-\nreports of having each disease. All\nanalyses were also conducted sepa-\nrately for men and women and the prin-\ncipal substantive conclusions are un-\naltered. Americans report higher levels\nof disease than the English, and in most\ncases much higher levels. These total\nprevalence differences for all diseases\nare always statistically significant. Dia-\nbetes prevalence is twice as high in\nthe United States (12.5%) compared\nwith England (6.1%). This between-\ncountry differential exists for both\nsexes, but male prevalence rates are\nhigher in both countries. Similarly, all\nforms of cardiovascular diseases have\nself-reported prevalence considerably\nhigher in the United States than in En-\ngland. To illustrate, hypertension is\nabout 10 percentage points more com-\nmon and all heart disease 6 percent-\nage points higher in the United States.\nAnd although heart-related condi-\ntions are more common among men in\nboth countries a higher prevalence is\nobserved in the United States for each\nsex. Finally, both lung disease and can-\ncer exhibit a similar cross-country dif-\nferential--higher prevalence rates for\nboth sexes in the United States but now\nthe disease is more common among\nwomen in both countries.\nThe second salient pattern high-\nlighted in Table 1 concerns the health\ngradient across the 2 classifiers of SES--\neducation and income. With the sole\nexception of cancer, there exists a sharp\nnegative gradient across both educa-\ntion and income groups in both coun-\ntries. That is, disease prevalence is re-\nported to be much higher among those\nat the bottom of either the education\nor income ladder compared with those\nat the top of each classification. Al-\nthough not universally true, income and\neducation gradients generally are\nsteeper in the United States than in En-\ngland. As a result, country differences\nare larger and tend to be more statisti-\ncally different at the bottom of the\nsocial hierarchy than at the top. Level\ndifferences between countries are suf-\nficiently large that individuals in the top\nof the education and income strata in\nthe United States have comparable rates\nof diabetes and heart disease as those\nin the bottom of the income and edu-\ncation strata in England.\nDifferences in Risk Factors by SES\nTABLE 2 lists the proportion of popu-\nlation smoking, heavy drinking, and\nwith being overweight. On average,\nsmoking behavior is remarkably simi-\nlar in both countries with about 1 in 5\npeople in this age group who cur-\nrently smoke. Strong negative gradi-\nents across income and education ex-\nist in both countries, but the gradients\nappear equally as large in both coun-\ntries. Thus differential smoking behav-\nior by itself seems unlikely to explain\nthe higher concentration of disease\n(particularly those related to smok-\ning) in the United States than in En-\ngland or the particularly high levels at\nthe lower rungs of the SES classifica-\ntion in United States.\nIn contrast, obesity is much higher in\nthe United States, an across-country\ndifferential especially pronounced in the\nlowest education and income groups. In\nboth countries, rates of obesity decline\nwith income and with education. Fi-\nnally, there are higher rates of heavy\ndrinking in England. Because heavy\ndrinking is more common among those\nat the top of the education and income\nstrata, it is an unlikely explanation for\ntheconcentrationofdiseaseamongthose\nat the bottom in either country, al-\nthough more moderate drinking in high\nSES groups could contribute to lower\nheart disease risk.\nTable 2.

All data weighted.\nP.05 vs data with England.\nP.01 vs data with England.\nTo determine to what extent differ-\nencesintheseriskfactorscanexplainany\nsalient differences in morbidity across\ncountries, we estimated ordinary least\nsquares regression models on each dis-\nease listed in Table 1. The explanatory\nvariables included all risk factors listed\nin Table 2, indicator variables for the 3\neducation and 3 income groups used to\nstratify in these Tables, and sex.\nBy and large, the risk factors per-\nform in the expected direction. For ex-\nample, being obese tends to be associ-\nated with higher rates of diabetes,\nhypertension, and myocardial infarc-\ntions; and having ever smoked is\nstrongly associated with lung disease,\ncancer, and myocardial infarctions.\nThese models were then used to\nsimulate what health conditions would\nbe if all individuals in both countries\nhad the same level of behavioral risk fac-\ntors as the average American in this age\ngroup. Risk-factor adjusted preva-\nlence rates are displayed in TABLE 3. In\nthese simulations, we hold the popu-\nlation sex distribution at US levels.\nA comparison of these adjusted\nprevalence rates with those in Table 1\nindicates how much of between-\ncountry difference in illness and how\nmuch of the variation by SES in each\ncountry is due to different levels of be-\nhavioral risk factors. This comparison\ndemonstrates that very little of the over-\nall between-country differences in\nhealth conditions are due to differ-\nences in this subset of behavioral risk\nfactors. To illustrate, less than one fifth\nof the difference in diabetes between\nthe United States and England is ex-\nplained by these risk factors.\nWith the sole exception of cancer, for\nwhich there was no within-country SES\ngradient to begin with, after control-\nling for these risk factors there re-\nmains a steep income gradient in both\ncountries with those in the lower in-\ncome quintiles experiencing worse\nhealth. Risk factors tend to account for\nsome of the differences in illness across\neducation groups, but for most dis-\neases the essential nature of the nega-\ntive health gradient remains intact.\nDifferences in Reporting\nHealth Outcomes\nBecause controlling for a standard set\nof behavioral risks does not explain why\nAmericans are less healthy than the En-\nglish with health disparities largest at\nthe bottom of the SES hierarchy, the\nprincipal explanations must lie else-\nwhere. One possibility is that our de-\nscription of comparative health out-\ncomes is exaggerated by relying on\nindividual self-reports. Perhaps due to\nlimited contact with the medical sys-\ntem, individuals in different countries\nor across different SES groups may be\nunaware that they have a particular dis-\nease or may think they are cured when\nthe disease is only under control. Pro-\ntocols and thresholds for specific dis-\nease diagnosis may differ so that a simi-\nlarly ill patient may be diagnosed with\na disease in one country but not in the\nother. The language by which physi-\ncians in the 2 countries communicate\nhealth problems to their patients may\nbe different. For example, in England,\nphysicians may tell their patients that\nthey have problems with blood glu-\ncose levels, which may not be under-\nstood to imply diabetes.\nOne way of addressing reporting\nissues involves examining biological\nmarkers of disease risk in both coun-\ntries.

Several studies have shown\nthat C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and\nHDL-C all serve as good markers for fu-\nture cardiovascular events.6,7\nThere are 2 striking patterns in\nTable 4 and TABLE 5. First, all 3 bio-\nlogical measures indicate much higher\nand statistically significant risk levels\nin the United States. In this age group,\n40.1% of Americans have C-reactive\nprotein levels within the high-risk\ngroup compared with only 30.4% of En-\nglish people. Similarly, 24% of the\nAmerican sample has measured fibrino-\ngen levels that place them at high risk--\nthe comparable English rates are 10%.\nOn the other hand, 27.9% of Ameri-\ncans have high levels of HDL-C com-\npared with 43.6% for the English.\nSecond, SES health gradients re-\nmain in both countries for education\n(Table 4) and income (Table 5) in all\n3 biological measures. Using C-\nreactive protein, in the United States\n57.8% in the lowest education group are\nat high risk compared with 34.6% of\nthose in the highest schooling class. In\nEngland, the comparable numbers are\ncially along the income divide, there\nis a somewhat steeper gradient in\nthe United States compared with En-\ngland. Among all biological measures,\nfibrinogen exhibits perhaps the sharp-\nest SES gradients, a statement equally\ntrue with education or income.

We also modeled these\nacross-country differences in assays\ncontrolling for smoking behavior, obe-\nsity, and being overweight. Control-\nling for these risk factors did not elimi-\nnate the statistically significant\ndifferences between the countries.\nCOMMENT\nEstablishing basic facts about a less\nhealthy America and steep negative SES\nhealth gradients is a first step toward un-\nderstanding reasons for the differences\nthat emerge. Health disparities between\nthe United States and England are not\nsolely due to special health problems in\nthe Latino and especially the black com-\nmunities in the United States since those\nimportant subpopulations were ex-\ncluded from this analysis. And, impor-\ntant as they are for better population\nhealth, a standard set of risk factors\n(smoking, drinking, and obesity) do not\nfully account for morbidity differences\nbetween and within each country.\nBecause screening rates for cancer are\ngenerally higher in the United States\nthan in England, this may play a role\nin the higher rates of cancer in the\nUnited States. Greater incident mortal-\nity from cancer in England may also be\nimportant.10,11 The magnitude of across-\ncountry differences in cancer preva-\nlence appears too large to be fully\nexplained by these factors alone. Dif-\nferences in cancer prevalence also ex-\nist in the high education and income\ngroups for whom differential detec-\ntion should play a weaker role. More-\nover, higher rates of detection do not\naccount for the higher rates of other ill-\nnesses in lower socioeconomic groups.\nAlthough access to health care is im-\nportant,12-14 differential access can only\noffer a partial explanation for our find-\nings. Among non-Hispanic whites aged\nUnited States do not report having ac-\ncess to health insurance (calculations by\nJ.P.S. from HRS). Even in the bottom\nthird of the income distribution, in this\nsubpopulation only 13.1% did not have\nsome form of health insurance (calcu-\nlationsbyJ.P.S.fromHRS).Becauseonly\n2.6% of those in the top income tertile\ndid not have health insurance (calcula-\ntions by J.P.S. from HRS), there is a gra-\ndient to access, which may explain part\nof the steeper US health gradient. But it\nis equally important to recognize that\nhealth insurance cannot be the central\nreason for the better health outcomes in\nEngland because the top SES tier of the\nUS population have close to universal\naccess but their health outcomes are of-\nTable 5.

Because the analysis\nhas been cross-sectional, past differ-\nences in risk factors may be partially un-\nderlying observed differences in health\nconditions for the older adults in our\nsamples.

Cer-\ntainly the US-England difference is\nmore pronounced for those in the low-\nest social groups, but the high status\nAmericans are also at a disadvantage.\nThis is fertile ground for additional ex-\nploration.\nThe finding of social gradients in\nplasma levels of C-reactive protein, fi-\nbrinogen, and HDL-C, and adverse lev-\nels in the United States compared with\nEngland serve as an indirect valida-\ntion of the morbidity findings and a\nguide to potential explanations. The\nmetabolic syndrome is linked to auto-\nnomic activity21 and to psychosocial\nfactors.22 Inflammatory markers, C-\nreactive protein and fibrinogen, have\nbeen shown to have an inverse asso-\nciation with socioeconomic position\nand may be linked with psychosocial\nfactors.23 Adjusting for obesity did not\nabolish either the international or the\nsocioeconomic differences in these bio-\nlogical markers.\nThe influence of inequality in eco-\nnomic resources on health remains con-\ntroversial.24,25 Income inequality is in-\ndeed much higher in the United States\nthan in England,26 but the rapidly in-\ncreasing levels of inequality in the\nUnited States do not appear to have had\na dramatic effect on the health of those\nat the bottom.17,19 A more promising ex-\nplanation may lie rather in the effects\nof more permanent measures of rank\nand status in the 2 countries.16\nAnemphasisonthepathwaywhereby\nhealthreducesworkandlowersincome\nwouldsuggestasteeperSESincomegra-\ndient in the United States.

Part of the greater associa-\ntion of health and economic resources\nin the United States may reflect the\ngreater impact of health on economic\nresources.\nTwo simple but powerful conclu-\nsions follow from our comparisons us-\ning biological and self-reports of dis-\nease in England and the United States.\nFirst, Americans are much sicker than\nthe English. Self-reports of disease are\nnot deceiving us about the reality of the\nsituation on one side of the Atlantic vs\nthe other. Second, the SES-health gra-\ndient is also not a reporting mirage; a\nby-product of differential ability by\nstandard SES markers to recognize and\nreport disease in surveys, an ability that\nhas been thought might differ even\namong the western industrialized coun-\ntries. Instead, the SES health gradient\nappears with equal force in either self-\nreports or biological measures of health.\nAuthor Affiliations: University College London and In-\nstitute for Fiscal Studies (Dr Banks), Department of Epi-\ndemiology, University College London (Dr Marmot)\nand Institute for Fiscal Studies (Ms Oldfield), Lon-\ndon, England; and RAND Corp, Santa Monica, Calif\n(Dr Smith).\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Marmot, Banks, and Smith\nand Ms Oldfield had full access to all of the data in\nthe study and take responsibility for the integrity of\nthe data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Banks, Marmot, Oldfield,\nSmith.\nAcquisition of data: Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, Smith.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Banks, Marmot,\nOldfield, Smith.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Banks, Marmot, Old-\nfield, Smith.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, Smith.\nStatistical analysis: Banks, Oldfield, Smith.\nObtained funding: Banks, Marmot, Smith.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Banks,\nOldfield, Smith.\nStudy supervision: Banks, Marmot, Smith.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: The research was supported by a\ngrant from the US National Institute on Aging (NIA)\nto RAND and from the NIA and the Economic and So-\ncial Research Council to the Institute for Fiscal Stud-\nies.
