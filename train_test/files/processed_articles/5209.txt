India is blessed with a long coastline, and the seas around Indian peninsula offer ample\npotential to tap various ocean energy forms. National Institute of Ocean Technology carries out research and various\nocean energy technologies, out of which harnessing kinetic energy in seawater currents is one. This article presents the\nopen sea trials recently carried out on National Institute of Ocean Technology's cross-flow hydrokinetic ocean current\nturbine in South Andaman. The turbine was designed to generate 100W electricity at 1.2m/s current speed and was built\nin-house. The turbine was initially tested in a seawater channel and then was deployed in Macpherson Strait in Andaman.\nIt was fitted below a floating platform designed especially for this purpose, and the performance of the turbine was\ncontinuously logged inside an on-board data acquisition system. The trials were successful and in line with computations.\n",

Ocean cur-\nrents are much slower compared to wind speeds. However,\nwater is about 835 times denser than wind, so a smaller\nwater flow can be equivalent to wind with extremely high\nvelocity. Energy can be extracted from such ocean currents\nusing submerged turbines that capture energy from hydro-\ndynamic lift and drag forces.\nDifferent configurations of turbines are considered\nfor harnessing kinetic energy in ocean currents as shown\nbines have underwater version of wind turbines, whereas\ncross-flow turbines use straight blades that are parallel\nto axis or blades with helical shape. Blades of the cross-\nflow turbine have cross section of a streamlined hydro-\nfoil. Axial flow turbines reverse the sense of rotation or\nthey need to be reoriented whenever the current direc-\ntion reverses, whereas cross-flow turbine design allows\nthem to revolve in the same sense of rotation. Hence,\nstraight bladed cross-flow configuration is considered\nfor designing the turbine under consideration.\nThe turbine design included analysis and optimization\nusing computational fluid dynamics principles. Then the\nturbines were tested in laboratories and a seawater channel\nin North Chennai.As a result of extensive studies, National\nInstitute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) recently carried out\nsuccessful sea trials in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on a\nsmall cross-flow hydrokinetic turbine which was designed\nand developed in-house. This article presents a brief\naccount of the trial and the performance of the turbine.\nEnergy extraction from ocean currents\nusing straight bladed cross-flow\nhydrokinetic turbine\nPrasad Dudhgaonkar, Nagasamy Duraisamy and Purnima Jalihal\n Keywords\nOcean current energy, ocean current turbines, straight blades, horizontal axis turbine, open sea trial\nEnergy and Fresh Water Group, National Institute of Ocean\nTechnology, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, Chennai,\nIndia\nCorresponding author:\nPurnima Jalihal, Energy and Fresh Water Group, National Institute of\nOcean Technology, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India,\nEmail: purnima@niot.res.in\nSpecial Issue Article\nDudhgaonkar et al. 5\nSizing for 100W electrical power\ngeneration\nThe total input kinetic energy in a stream of water flowing\nat velocity V (Gorlov, 2001) can be calculated by\ni\n. \nThe turbine performance is based on the turbine param-\neters such as number of blades (z), solidity ratio () and\nblade profile. The number of blades was selected as three\n(Castelli et al., 2012) where each blade is placed at an\ninterval of 120\u00b0. The solidity ratio is defined as follows\n\n\n=\nzC\nD\nwhere C is the chord length of the blade and D is the diam-\neter of turbine.\nThe design calculation was based on the performance\nof straight bladed\u00adtype turbine with a coefficient of perfor-\nmance of 0.3 at tip speed ratio of 1.5 from the experimental\nstudy of Shiono et al. (2002). Here, the coefficient of per-\nformance is the ratio of the gross mechanical power output\nof turbine to the input power and the tip speed ratio is the\nratio of the blade speed to the seawater current speed. The\noverall transmission efficiency that includes the mechani-\ncal transmission and the electrical conversion was assumed\nat 70%. The turbine was designed to produce an electrical\npower output of 100W at approximately 1.2m/s seawater\ncurrent speed. Blade profile of NACA 0018 was selected\nfor the blades. However, a higher solidity ratio was chosen\nto improve self-starting characteristics of turbine and its\nperformance in low current speeds (NIOT Report, 2015).\nThe following assumptions were made for designing the\nturbine blades:\nDesign water velocity, V: 1.2m/s;\nNumber of blades, z: 3;\nDensity of seawater, w\nTransmission efficiency, t\nGenerator efficiency, g\nLength of turbine, L: 1m;\nTip speed ratio at peak power, : 1.5;\nThe three-dimensional (3D) model of the turbine with\nm diameter and 1\nm length is shown in Figure 3. The\nassembled structure of the turbine can be seen with the\nshaft and blade arms. One blade was held between two\nblade arms, and a total of six blade arms were used to fit\nthree turbine blades with an angular spacing of 120\u00b0.\nIn towing tank testing, it was found that the cut-in speed\nof the turbine was 0.8m/s. Any specific cut-out speed was\nnot considered while designing the turbine. The transmis-\nsion was designed to transmit 70Nm torque, which is 50%\nhigher than peak torque at design current speed.\nA two-stage timing belt drive was used to couple the\nturbine to the electrical generator. An electrical alternator\nr/min was chosen in order to allow\n50% increase in turbine speed above design speed. The\nbelt drive and the alternator assembly were placed inside\nan underwater enclosure along with instrumentation.\nFigure 1. Axial flow water turbines: (a) inclined axis, (b) float\nmooring and (c) rigid mooring (Khan et al., 2008).\nFigure 2. Sketch of different vertical-axis turbines: (a) SC-\nDarrieus, (b) H-Darrieus, (c) Darrieus (curved blade), (d)\nGorlov and (e) Savonius rotor (Khan et al., 2008).\n6 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\nInstrumentation and data acquisition\nsystem\nTwo on-board data acquisition (DAQ) systems were\nemployed for data redundancy. One was placed on the\nfloating platform with minicomputer for data logging and\nthe other was placed inside the underwater enclosure as\nshown in Figure 4. The enclosure housed voltage sensor\nand current sensor. A rectifier converted the alternating\ncurrent to direct current. Solar photovoltaic panels were\nused to charge the battery for powering the instruments\nused in the system. Solar charge regulator was also placed\nnear the minicomputer inside enclosure. The DAQ system\nhad two subsystems, namely, Compact Reconfigurable\nInput and Output (cRIO) System and wireless system.\nThe cRIO was programmed using LabVIEW-2015 in\nFPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) mode. It was used\nalong with multichannel 4\u00ad20mA analogue input modules.\nSignals of 4\u00ad20mA from the speed sensor, V&I sensors of\nPMSG (permanent magnet synchronous generator) and\nV&I sensors of PV cRIO-9014 were processed and\nstored in real time. cRIO was programmed also for the\nreal-time plots for monitoring the performances of the\ncurrent turbine. The CPU of cRIO was programmed to\nsend the data simultaneously to the on-board data\nreception station on board watch-keeping boat through\nradio frequency (RF) communication. Instruments placed\nsecurely inside different water proof enclosures are shown\nin Figure 4.\nTesting of turbine at seawater\nchannel\nFigure 5 shows the turbine during seawater channel testing\nat 1.2m/s seawater speed as measured byAcoustic Doppler\nCurrent Profiler (ADCP). For the prevailing water speed,\nthe peak electric power output of 108\nW was obtained at\nr/min turbine speed. After accounting for the losses in\nmechanical transmission and alternator \u00ad estimated as\n25% each as a result of separate exercise \u00ad the net and\ngross mechanical power output was estimated at 130 and\n156W, respectively. The coefficient of performance of the\nturbine (Cp\n) was found to be 0.23 at a tip speed ratio of 1.2\nas seen in Figure 6. Subsequently, the turbine was consid-\nered suitable for open sea testing and Andaman was\nselected as the location.\nFloating platform for turbine testing\nThe floating platform for suspending the turbine was\ndesigned as shown in Figure 7. The platform design was\nanalysed to determine deflections and utilization ratios\nfor all possible loading conditions. The design require-\nments were (a) maximum operational depth of 2m from\nwater level, (b) provision of A-frame for lifting and low-\nering the turbine with base frame (1tonne), and (c) design\nfor drag, mooring effects, operational loads and all\npossible load combinations. Structural analysis software\nFigure 3. Geometrical model of  0.8m\u00d71m straight bladed\nFigure 4. Electrical and instrumentation system placed inside water proof enclosures.\nDudhgaonkar et al. 7\nSTAAD Pro was used to analyse various configurations\nof the platform.\nThe hydrostatic stability of the platform in static and\ntowing conditions was studied for different positions of the\nabove the water level was considered for towing condition.\nThe platform was found to be stable as the estimated trans-\nverse and longitudinal metacentric heights were found to\nm, respectively, with the turbine at -1.3\nm\n(below water level). The metacentric height slightly\nreduced for the turbine position above water level due to\nmarginal increase in the distance of centre of gravity from\nkeel. But it was still safe.\nFigure 8 shows the completed floating platform placed\nin the water near jetty for testing its stability. The platform\nhad a provision to lower the turbine from the central moon\npool till the turbine shaft reached a depth of 2m from the\nwater level. The four columns were lifted or raised or held\nin desired position using two chain-pulley blocks hooked\nto the either side of A-frame. The floating platform was\nalso used to house the solar panels, batteries and data log-\nging system.\nDeployment of turbine at Andaman\nIsland\nThe Macpherson Strait connects Bay of Bengal on West\nand Andaman Sea on East. NIOT had earlier carried out\nseawater current measurement at one location for a very\nbrief period. These measurements indicated that the peak\ncurrents often exceeded 1.2\nm/s and were influenced\nmainly by tide. Also the wave action near Rutland Island\nwas negligible (NIOT Report, 2013). Hence, the location\nwas chosen for carrying out open sea trial. The turbine was\ntowed to the location marked in Figure 9.\nThe towing route from main bay in Port Blair to the test\nkm long, and a total of 18\nhours of time\nwas taken for towing. Upon reaching the site, the instru-\nmentation was readied and the turbine was lowered to\ncheck all systems during low tide currents at a nearby jetty.\nThe turbine responded well and started rotating while\nthe current at 2m depth was measured as 0.9m/s. On the\nnext day, it was lowered to the depth of 2\nm from water\nlevel. This location is along the smallest section on the\n~20-m-deep channel between Rutland Island and the\nsmaller Lal Tikri Island.\nThe turbine started generating electricity whenever\ncurrent speeds were above 0.8m/s and gave consistent\nperformance throughout the trial period. Figure 10\nshows the photographs of deployed turbine platform\ntaken at various times. The glowing lamps seen in pho-\ntographs are powered by the electricity generated by the\nturbine.\nResults and discussion\nThe exercise generated valuable data about the perfor-\nmance of the turbine and the currents at the test sites via\ndirect measurements. The turbine exhibited self-rotating\ncharacteristics whenever the seawater current speed\ncrossed the cut-in speed of 0.8m/s. The maximum electric\npower reported during the trial was 304\nshows a representative time series of rectified electric\npower output from turbine recorded on 7 June 2016.\nDuring the trial, the turbine functioned at a coefficient of\nFigure 5.

Performance of  0.8m\u00d71m straight bladed\nhorizontal axis turbine in NCTPS channel at 1.2m/s.\n8 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\nperformance of 0.22 that matched the earlier test results.\nThe turbine was retrieved after successful completion of\nthe trial.\nConclusion\nA 0.8-m-diameter turbine with 1-m-long blades was\nW electrical power at seawater\ncurrent speed of 1.2\nm/s. The turbine was fabricated and\nwas made to undergo all possible stages of development. It\nsuccessfully generated the design power output in a seawa-\nter channel. Following this success, this turbine underwent\nrigorous testing in Macpherson Strait in South Andaman.\nAt this location, the turbine when suspended below water\nsurface from a specially designed floating platform not\nonly generated the requisite power but also recorded a\nW \u00ad when the currents\nexceeded 1.8m/s \u00ad surpassing its design power of 100\nW\nby a huge margin. The data logging system, Wi-Fi data\ntransmission system and turbine control system performed\nsatisfactorily. The turbine was found to be self-starting at\nspeeds above 0.8m/s. The coefficient of performance was\nestimated to be 0.22 which matched earlier testing results\nvery well. These tests pave the way for scaling up of off-\ngrid units for remote coastal locations.\nFigure 7. Schematic of turbine system with floating platform.\nFigure 8.
