    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe provision of stimulating and engaging play space for children and young people is increasingly recognized as an important\nsocietal goal, not the least because it provides the young with opportunities to develop and gain experience in experimenting\nwith risk. Research in several disciplines now suggests that achievement of this goal has however been impeded in recent\ndecades, and reasons commonly cited have included fear of injury and avoidance of litigation. International standards on play\nequipment have also been promulgated and justified in terms of securing young people's \"safety,\" most usually narrowly\ndefined as injury reduction. There appears to be a widespread presumption that measures aimed at injury prevention are\nnecessarily beneficial overall for young people's welfare. In this article, we subject European standards for play equipment\nand surfacing to scrutiny. In particular, we examine underlying motives, consistency of purpose, use of evidence, philosophical\nleanings, scope, practicalities of application, systems of management, and legal ramifications. From this, we identify a number\nof fundamental issues that suggest that as a consequence of compartmentalized thinking and misunderstandings, these\nstandards have invaded areas of decision making beyond their legitimate territory. The consequence of this is that play\nprovision is skewed away from what are properly play provision objectives. In such circumstances, local decision makers are\noften disempowered, and their ability to provide optimal play spaces thereby circumscribed.\n",

At first sight, it might well appear that no inter-\naction should be expected between such unlikely bed fellows\nas these, particularly as play has been characterized as behav-\nior that typically involves children directing their own\nactions, and engaging actively, flexibly, and adaptively with\nuncertain and unpredictable situations (Lester & Russell,\n2008) and thus, apparently, the antithesis of a managed activ-\nity. However, there is growing realization, from disparate\nwalks of life ranging, for example, from outdoor adventure\nactivities to education, health care, and even urban arboricul-\nture, that seemingly remote management systems can have\nsubtle and unintended consequences on public life, which\nmay detract from the achievement of socially desired goals\n1995). A reason for this may be that modern management\nsystems continue at times to be overly reliant on methodolo-\ngies derived from systems engineering.\nIt is undeniable that systems engineering approaches,\nas pioneered in the United States by Bell Laboratories,\nhave been stunningly effective in dealing with immensely\ncomplex engineering problems of the type encountered,\nfor example, in the National Aeronautics and Space\nIn that case, they enabled hundreds of agencies to work\ntogether on that intricate project and then to recombine their\nefforts into a working whole. However, systems engineering\napproaches have been less successful when applied to\nsocial issues.

Not only is\nit difficult to define their effectiveness, but, more crucially, a\ngrowing obsession with internal control may itself be a source of\nrisk. First, internal control systems are organizational projections\nof controllability which may be misplaced; such systems are\nonly as good as the imaginations of those who designed them.\nSecond, internal control systems are essentially inward-looking\nand may embody mistaken assumptions of what the public\nreally wants reassurance about (p. 28).\nIn this article, we examine how a management system,\nwhose primary interests are safety and free trade, has affected\nthe provision of play spaces in ways that, we believe, also\nbear the hallmarks of the \"richness\" and \"internal control\"\nsyndromes. Although, paradoxically, play is supposedly to\nbe freely chosen, provision for play has in recent decades\nbecome highly managed with numerous actors having an\ninvolvement. These include equipment manufacturers, trade\nassociations, designers, providers, procurers, standards set-\nters, insurers, inspectors, the courts (via litigation), policy\nmakers, play workers, parents, and the young, each with their\nown agenda.\nWe are here particularly interested in the role of equip-\nment standards and in unintended consequences arising from\nthem. Equipment standards are used by many of these actors\nfor a variety of purposes, often without any questions being\nasked. Thus, standards may assume an overwhelming pres-\nence, essentially dictating what will eventuate. Our ability to\naddress these issues is based on our collective immersion,\nover several decades, within the play sector. This includes\nparticipation in standards setting, equipment design and\nmanufacture, play space design, play policy, litigation, and\nacademic research.\nCurrent Dilemmas of Play\nThere is an upsurge in the recognition of the value and impor-\ntance of outdoor play for children and young people and on\nways to give them better play opportunities (National\nChildren's Bureau, 2013). One reason for this is the realiza-\ntion that, through play, humans gain some of their first expo-\nsures to risk and this is where they learn how to cope with it\nat the personal level. As a 2012 high level statement from the\nHealth and Safety Executive (HSE)--the United Kingdom's\nsafety regulator--has put it,\nPlay brings the world to life for children. It provides for an\nexploration and understanding of their abilities; helps them to\nlearn and develop; and exposes them to the realities of the world\nin which they will live, which is a world not free from risk but\nrather one where risk is ever present. The opportunity for play\ndevelops a child's risk awareness and prepares them for their\nfuture lives.\nFrom our perspective, this new awareness was predictable\nand is welcome, for there are by now copious reports,\nresearch papers, and media statements warning that children\nand young people have in some societies been deprived of\nessential developmental experiences for several decades and\nthat corrective action is urgently required (Bundy et al.,\ntions have been offered as to why the situation deteriorated\nas it did. These range over political, economic, legal, and\nsocial factors. In this article, we focus on the role and use of\nformer British and now international playground safety stan-\ndards, particularly European standards such as EN1176 and\n1177 promulgated by Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation\n(CEN), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN,\nof the actors involved in play provision, manufacturers obvi-\nously, but also other actors who may deploy them for reasons\nother than those for which they were designed, for example,\navoidance of liability.\nIt has also been argued that in general standards of what-\never kind may bring about undesirable changes in society\n(MacRae, 2011). As argued by MacRae, they may promote\nthe economic interests of particular groups, may contribute\nto excessive rule observance and disproportionate regulatory\nactivity, can lead to non-optimal resource allocation, and\nmay even encroach on civil liberties. In partial recognition,\nperhaps, of these difficulties, recently promulgated interna-\ntional standards even delve into the principles of risk man-\nagement itself. Thus, the International Organization for\nimportance of context, risk attitudes, and the need to align\nculture with policy.\nAs noted, our emphasis here is on European standards.\nHowever, we are aware that similar research has been\nreported in North America on Canadian standards for play\nequipment (Herrington & Nicholls, 2007). Likewise, there is\nalso concern more widely, from continental Europe to the\nAntipodes, about what has been described as a narrow focus\nby standards on one issue, physical injury, at the apparent\nexpense of a host of other dangers that potentially come as a\nresult of modifying or otherwise restricting active play\ntendency, both in the text of the standards and in playground\ninspection reports, to treat \"safety\" and \"injury prevention\"\nas self-evident correlates reinforces this narrowing of view.\nTo put it simply, standards themselves ostensibly focus on\nSpiegal et al. 3\ninjury reduction and make scant reference to other issues of\nobvious importance, such as the health benefits of play and\nalso opportunities to learn about risk. To deploy Checkland\nand Poulter's (2006) terminology, they lack richness, or\nPower's (2004) concept of internal control, they are too\ninward-looking and embody mistaken assumptions about\nwhat is needed.\nIn this article, we now discuss the ways in which these par-\nticular standards have been interpreted by various actors. Prior\nto doing this, it is necessary to examine a number of features\nand practical manifestations of how standards interact with the\nwider play community. This is achieved under the following\nheadings: the evidence base that standards draw on, their\nethos, their scope, and finally, their application during play\ninspections and as manifest in legal proceedings.\nExamples of the Use of Scientific\nEvidence\nAcademic research ideally provides the evidence that under-\npins the design of interventions including those intended to\nincrease safety. However, it is well-known that the commu-\nnication and transfer of the meaning of research to end-users\nis a path with many potential pitfalls, even to the extent that\n\"science communication\" has become a topic of research in\nits own right. Thus, Herrington and Nicholls (2007) described\nground standards apparently failed to take account of\nCanadian studies that showed that injury levels on play-\ngrounds were not significantly high and misapplied injury\ndata from the American Consumer Product Safety\nCommission. They speculated that this may have been done\nto fulfill primary objectives of the Canadian Standards\nAssociation (CSA; 2003), which were to \"foster and promote\nvoluntary standardization as a means of advancing the\nnational economy\" and to \"facilitate domestic and interna-\ntional trade.\" Rational though of course these objectives are\nfrom a commercial perspective, they may not be synony-\nmous with providing the best developmental opportunities\nfor children and young people.\nSome similarities with this situation, as described, can be\nobserved in not-so-distant British play equipment standards.\nThese earlier British standards are relevant because they\nwent on to influence subsequent European standards. For\nsion both claim that only limited data were available on play-\nground accidents, thus requiring the standards Committee to\n\"adopt a reasonable attitude in writing the recommendations\nfor minimizing\" the risks (British Standards Institution\nthere were in fact statistics available by the early 1980s that,\nhad the Committee looked, would have shown, as in Canada,\nthat injury rates were low (these studies were identified in\nthe committee refers to \"minimizing\" risks. This is a particu-\nlar view of injury control that is not universally shared. At\nthe national level, risk minimization is not the normal goal\nand never has been, except in special circumstances. For\nexample, the legal requirement in Britain is to do what is\nreasonable (or reasonably practicable) as set out in the Health\nand Safety at Work etc Act of 1974 (The National Archives,\nprinciple of risk management.1\nThese early British standards also contain other indicators\nof thought processes along with an apparently less than rig-\nwhich was about the use of impact absorbing surfacing (IAS)\nin playgrounds, states in the Foreword that \"Studies of acci-\ndents have shown that the majority of the more serious cases\ninvolve head injuries caused through striking hard ground\"\n(BSI, 1989). This bold statement is attributed in the standard\nto a 1975 article by Illingworth and colleagues, which had\nbeen published in the British Medical Journal (Illingworth,\nBrennan, Jay, Al-Rawi, & Collick, 1975). This is important\nbecause it was apparently on the strength of this evidence\nthat BS 7188 went on to recommend the use of impact\nabsorbing materials in playgrounds, a recommendation that\nsubsequently had major implications for the design, specifi-\ncation, and also cost of play provision.\nHowever, careful scrutiny of the Illingworth article\nreveals some disconcerting facts. First, the article is about a\nsample of 200 injuries caused by playground accidents. Of\nthese, just 49% occurred on a park or similar playground as\nopposed to a school playground or at home, suggesting that\nless than 100 cases were used to justify what eventually\nturned out to be a billion dollar activity of fitting park play-\ngrounds with impact absorbing surfaces. As the article itself\nstates, \"To draw meaningful conclusions about the relation\nof the severity of the accident to the type of play equipment\ngreater numbers would be needed.\" More disturbing still is\nthat the article in no way supports the British Standards\nCommittee's then contention that \"Studies of accidents have\nshown that the majority of the more serious cases involve\nhead injuries caused through striking hard ground.\" The arti-\ncle in fact barely alludes to surfaces, and the majority of\ncases described were of minor injury. Of the few cases judged\nserious, 15 in total, most involved limb injuries and not the\nhead, and IAS as then conceived were not designed to deal\nwith limb injuries. Those cases, circa 6, which did involve\nthe head, were attributed to a variety of causes including col-\nlisions with persons or objects (such as swing seats or fixed\nequipment), collapsing equipment, childhood behavior, or\nwere unassigned.\nSubsequent to the recommendations of BS 7188 on IAS,\nfurther research has been reported seeking retrospective jus-\ntification for these products as well as for the more rigorous\nimposition of standards. Some of this has been reviewed\n4 SAGE Open\nbeen published since then by authors such as Norton, Nixon,\nmissing links persist in the chain from academic research on\ninterventions aimed at fostering safety from injury, to their\nactual net benefit in the real world of children's play. For\nexample, has the massive expenditure on IAS passed the test\nof resources well used? What have been the subtle conse-\nquences of placing children and young people in artificial\nenvironments when, arguably, they need to gain experience\nof the real world? What have been the consequences for the\noverall design of play environments? These basic questions\ncontinue to receive little more than superficial attention in\nmuch research on injury prevention.\nEthos and Perspective\nAnother fundamental issue regarding standards revolves\naround their ethos. In general terms, standards are primarily\nmade for economic reasons. Despite, in some cases, setting\nsafety requirements, they are the vehicles for ensuring free\nmovement of goods between states. CEN's own guide to the\nprocess states that, \"European Standardization's objective is\nto agree on common specifications to respond to the needs of\nindustry, meet consumer expectations and contribute to the\nconsolidation of the European Single Market\" (CEN and\nCENELEC [European Committee for Electrotechnical\nThe technical committees that draft standards at a European\nlevel are made up of delegations from national standards bod-\nies that, by virtue of the above and the fact that delegates are\nself-financing, are industry dominated. In our experience,\namong their motivations are, first, removal of barriers to trade,\nand second, ensuring the resulting standard is as near as pos-\nsible to each delegation's national standard, thus avoiding the\nexpense of changes for home manufacturers.\nThe process is essentially one of harmonization, and it\nwould be a mistake to assume it necessarily addresses the\nspecific issues that might be of relevance to a user. Its intent\nis more to bring dissimilar national standards together to iron\nout differences. In this way, harmonization is defined by\nCEN as, \"prevention or elimination of differences in the\ntechnical content of (national) standards having the same\nscope, particularly those differences that may cause hin-\nIn terms of matters specific to the play equipment and\nsurfacing standards, we draw attention to the fact that in\nheaded Scope that \"It is not the purpose of this standard to\nencompass the play value.\" Were this statement true, it\nwould imply that the committee was concerned with risk\nminimization without reference to the benefits or \"play\nvalue\" of play provision. If so, this could well explain in\nsome degree the emasculation of children and young peo-\nple's play experiences over several decades. Intriguingly,\nthis position has been adjusted in the Introduction to the\nlatest version of BS EN1176-1 that opens with the state-\nment that \"It is not the purpose of the requirements of this\nstandard to lessen the contribution that playground equip-\nment makes to child development and/or play, which is\nmeaningful from an educational point of view\" (BSI,\n2008). It then goes on to state that \"Play provision should\naim at managing the balance between the need to offer\nrisk and the need to keep children safe from serious harm.\"\nAlthough this is radically different from the former\nposition--which allegedly does not encompass play value\nor recognize the benefits of risk exposure--the standard\nitself has changed rather little in content. This is surpris-\ning with such an apparent shift in philosophy.\nWhat is also missing is any "
