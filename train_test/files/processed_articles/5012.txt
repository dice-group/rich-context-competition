The automatic and involuntary experience of a\nperception in a modality different from the one stimulated, such as seeing colours when listening to\nspeech sounds, is called synaesthesia (Simner, 2007). For many \"grapheme\u00adcolour\" synaesthetes,\nboth reading and listening to words can induce vivid and consistent concurrent perceptions of colour.\nSurprisingly little, however, is known about how their experiences might be affected by the acoustic\u00ad\nphonetic properties of speech. Instead, such cases are generally considered to be mediated by written\nlanguage (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Harrison, Goldstein, & Wyke, 1993; Simner et al., 2006). The reasoning\nis that abstract letter units (graphemes) predict synaesthetes' perceived colours better than abstract\nsound units (phonemes) do: For example, many synaesthetes report the same colour for the differently-\npronounced <c>s in cat and cease, but different colours for the differently-spelled /k/ sounds in cat and\nkoala (cf. Simner, 2007). This paper investigates whether the vowel sounds of speech can be found\nto systematically influence colour percepts, when the focus is on vowels' concrete acoustic\u00adphonetic\nproperties, rather than their phonemic identity.\nAlthough vowel sound to colour associations have been proposed previously, no systematic, rig-\norous tests have compared synaesthetes and controls' behaviour. Jakobson (1962) and Marks (1975)\nboth direct attention to the main acoustic features of vowel quality: vowel formants. Formants are\npeaks of the sound spectrum, i.e. accumulations of acoustic energy at certain frequencies. Vowels are\nusually distinguishable by their first two formants, F1 and F2. Figure 1 illustrates how eight reference\nvowels, the primary cardinal vowels (International Phonetic Association, 1999), are distributed in\nacoustic F1\u00adF2 space. Cardinal vowel C1 or [i], similar to the vowel in cheese, is characterised by a\nlow F1 and a high F2, i.e. the two energy peaks are far apart. C5, or [], similar to the vowel in the\nfirst syllable of father, has a high F1 but low F2. C1\u00adC4 are termed front vowels, C4\u00adC5 open vowels\nand C5\u00adC8 back vowels, according to the articulatory settings of the mouth and tongue. So, the cheese\nCross-modal associations in synaesthesia: Vowel colours in\nthe ear of the beholder\n*Corresponding author.\n133 Moos A, Smith R, Miller S R, Simmons D R\nvowel is produced with a nearly closed mouth and fronted tongue, and the father vowel with an open\nmouth and retracted tongue.\nVowels with both high F1 and F2, like the [a] in cat, have been associated with perceived col-\nourfulness (Jakobson, 1962) or redness (Marks, 1975). Increasing F2 frequency has, moreover, been\nlinked to a vowel's perceived lightness, so that [i] should be perceived as light but [] as in caught\nas dark (Marks, 1975). However, these proposals are based on case reports that lack the methodo-\nlogical control characteristic of synaesthesia research today. Wrembel (2009) reports more stringent\ntests using articulatorily defined vowel phonemes, which indicate lighter colour associations with\nfront vowels, but only non-synaesthetes were tested. What is thus missing is a direct comparison of\nsynaesthetes' and controls' behaviour, using both acoustic\u00adphonetic and advanced colorimetric analy-\nses to substantiate previous ideas and findings. A detailed analysis and comparison across groups may\nhelp to identify cognitive mechanisms underlying the associations, similar to the proposals of Ward,\nHuckstep, and Tsakanikos (2006) who assume shared mechanisms in musical pitch--lightness map-\npings by synaesthetes and controls. Potentially, scales such as high\u00adlow and light\u00addark are treated in a\nsimilar fashion across modalities by the brain (Maurer & Mondloch, 2005; Spence, 2011), which could\nalso play a role in sound symbolism.\nUnderstanding the interplay of acoustic\u00adphonetic and graphemic influences in synaesthesia may also\nhelp in explaining its neural basis, and the cross-modal interactions underlying perceptual awareness and\nfeature binding more generally. One prominent theory of synaesthesia assumes cross-activation between\nbrain regions, particularly adjacent ones (Hubbard, Brang, & Ramachandran, 2011). On this view,\nacoustic\u00adphonetic structure should influence grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthesia only minimally, since the\ncommonly implicated brain areas (the \"visual word form area\" in fusiform gyrus and \"colour area\"\nV4) are not usually associated with auditory processing. The notion that synaesthesia originates early\nin development (Maurer & Mondloch, 2005) accords well with a role for acoustic\u00adphonetic structure:\nInfants first encounter sounds phonetically, gradually systematising their experiences into phonological\nknowledge, which, in turn, forms a basis for literacy. Thus, linguistic synaesthesiae might initially be\ndriven by concrete phonetic attributes of speech, with phonemic and ultimately graphemic influences\nsupervening later in development (cf. Simner, 2007).\nTo test whether the acoustic\u00adphonetic structure of vowels affects synaesthetic perception, we pre-\nsented self-reported grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthetes and control participants with vowel sounds, and\nthey chose the best corresponding colour. If acoustic\u00adphonetic structure influences concurrent synaes-\nthetic percepts, we would expect systematic shifts in chromaticity of colour choices as F1 increases\n(hypothesis 1), and in the lightness of grey-shade choices as F2 increases (hypothesis 2). If, in contrast,\ngraphemic influences dominate to the exclusion of acoustic\u00adphonetic ones, we would see no influence\nof formant frequencies on colour choices. As observed for musical sounds (Ward et al., 2006) and\ngraphemes (Simner et al., 2005), we expect broadly similar response patterns among synaesthetes and\ncontrols, with synaesthetes behaving more consistently (hypothesis 3).\nFigure 1. Schematic vowel quadrilateral of the eight primary cardinal vowels C1\u00adC8, positioned in the frequency\nspace of the first two formants F1 and F2 and the articulatory space from close to open mouth setting and front to\nback tongue body setting.\nCross-modal associations in synaesthesia 134\nParticipants\nrange 19\u00ad37) participated, all recruited locally.All reported normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal\neyesight and normal colour vision, except one synaesthete who reported a slight colour deficiency. Tests\nof colour vision (Ishihara, 1978) confirmed the participants' self-reports. All had English as their native\nlanguage. More specifically, all controls and six synaesthetes were Scottish; the other five synaesthetes had\nother varieties of English (including two bilinguals with French). Synaesthetes underwent a short directed\ninterview before the experiment. All reported having grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthesia. Some synaesthetes,\nbut not all, reported having additional synaesthetic experiences (e.g. shapes and/or colours in response to\nmusic and/or voices). However, as we have shown elsewhere (Moos, Simmons, Simner, & Smith, 2013),\nthe presentation of synaesthesia is often multi-faceted: something which may only become apparent after\nrigorous testing.\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Arts at the University of\nGlasgow, and participants provided informed consent before testing.\nAuditory stimuli\nStimuli were 16 different vowel sounds, selected to represent the acoustic vowel space rather than to\ninstantiate the specific vowels of English (AuditoryStimuli.wav in the supporting information avail-\nable on-line). Recordings of the eight primary cardinal vowels (CVs; Figure 1) were made in a high-\nspecification sound studio. They were spoken in isolation on a level pitch by an English male trained\nphonetician (65 years old).\nTo create a richer vowel continuum, eight intermediate vowels were made by morphing each\nneighbouring pair of CVs using the STRAIGHT modification and synthesis procedure (Kawahara,\n2003). Interpolation between each pair of vowel recordings used five vectors: f0, spectral amplitude,\naperiodicity, time and formant frequencies. Morphed vowels are referred to as C1.5 (between [i] and\nThe 16 vowels were adjusted in intensity (to 80 dBSPL\n) and duration (to 1049 ms, the mean dura-\ntion of the original stimuli) using Praat's PSOLA function (Boersma & Weenink, 2011). F0 varied\nminimally, from 120 to 124 Hertz, and was not equalised. The frequencies of F1 and F2 in Hertz were\nmeasured manually from LPC (linear predictive coding) and fft (fast Fourier transform) spectra in\nPraat, for subsequent analyses.\nVisual response display\nTo separately examine the contributions of chromaticity (hypothesis 1) and lightness (hypothesis 2),\nwe created two visual response displays, \"colour\" and \"grey-shade.\" The response space comprised\n16 choices. We chose not to offer a larger set of colours because of time restrictions. As auditory mem-\nory decays rapidly (Pisoni, 1973), fast responding was required; this is only possible with a limited set\nof colours. Nonetheless, 16 choices expand the range used in previous work without unduly lengthen-\ning the number of trials required (e.g. Marks, 1975; Wrembel, 2009). Each display consisted of 16 cir-\ncles on a mid-grey background in a 4  4 matrix, see Figure S1 in the supporting information on-line.\nThe coloured display consisted of the 11 focal colours (white, black, red, green, yellow, blue,\nbrown, grey, orange, pink and purple; Berlin & Kay, 1999), plus five further colours (dark green, light\ngreen, pale pink, cyan and dark blue) to fill the gaps in colour space. The grey-shades were visually\nequidistant.\nThe focal colours were displayed by converting the Munsell codes defined by Rosch Heider (1972)\ninto CIE coordinates. The CIE coordinates of these and other display colours were measured with a\nchromameter (Minolta, CS-100, Konica Minolta Sensing Europe) and converted to CIELUV space for\nanalysis (Westland & Ripamonti, 2004; see supporting information Table S1).\nProcedure\nParticipants were tested individually in a high-specification studio, in darkness to avoid room lighting\naffecting their colour perception. They wore high-quality headphones and viewed the LCD monitor\nfrom a distance of 65 cm.\nFirst, participants carried out the colour task, followed after a break of 5\u00ad15 min by the grey-shade\ntask. They were instructed to click on the colour or grey-shade that best matched the sound. On each\n135 Moos A, Smith R, Miller S R, Simmons D R\ntrial, the sound and visual response display were presented simultaneously. After a response had been\nchosen, a grey screen was displayed for 2 s to allow the after-image to dissipate. The order of the\ncolours on the screen was randomised on each trial, whereas the grey-shades were ordered from white\n(top left) to black (bottom right).\nThe presentation order used a type 1 index 1 sequence (Nonyane & Theobald, 2007). Here, every\nstimulus is followed by itself as often as by any other stimulus. This resulted in 16*16+1 = 257 stimuli\nfor each of the colour and grey-shade tasks (total 514 stimuli), providing a good test of within-subject\nreliability. The experiment lasted approximately 1.5 hr including self-paced breaks after each block\nStatistical analysis\nFor the colour experiment, L*, u* and v* values (representing luminance, the red\u00adgreen axis and\nthe yellow\u00adblue axis, respectively) were the dependent variables in a repeated-measures analysis of\ncovariance model (ANCOVA). For the grey experiment, L* was the sole dependent variable. In both\ncases, fixed predictors were the first two formant frequencies of the vowel stimuli (F1, F2) as covari-\nates1, participant group and the interactions of F1  Group and F2  Group. Between-subject random\neffects were fitted for intercept, F1 and F2. To aid interpretation of the formant frequency and interac-\ntion terms, estimates of the \"slope\" are presented with standard errors, where the slope is the change\nin the dependent variable associated with a change of 100 Hz in the relevant formant frequency in the\nrelevant participant group. The between- and within-subject variances were estimated separately for\neach group. Equality of variances between groups was assessed using an F-test. Goodness of fit of the\nmodels was demonstrated by comparison of -2 times the difference in log likelihood to a 2 distribu-\nTo analyse consistency, we employed two complementary approaches. First, we identified each\nparticipant's modal (i.e., most frequent) colour responses to each vowel and then used non-parametric\ntechniques (Mann\u00adWhitney U test) to compare the frequency of these modal responses across groups.\nThis determined how frequently participants chose exactly the same colour (or grey shade) across mul-\ntiple repetitions of a given vowel. Second, we used parametric techniques on the continuous CIELUV\nvariables to look at how close these choices were to each other, using comparisons of the within- and\nbetween-subject variances as estimated by the ANCOVA.\nNote that results are treated as statistically significant when p  0.05 and as trends when 0.05 \n3 Results and discussion\nColour associations\nAccording to self-report, for most synaesthetes, all vowel sounds induced synaesthetic colours. For the\nrest of the synaesthetes, most vowel sounds induced synaesthetic colours. As the design of the experi-\nment was a forced choice task, colours for those vowel sounds which did not induce automatic colour\nassociations were associated freely, similar to the associations made by non-synaesthetes.\nFigure 2 and Table 1 show that u* of the colour choices, which represents the red\u00adgreen axis,\nincreased significantly with rising F1 for both groups, but significantly more strongly for synaesthetes\nwas also a trend for u* to decrease slightly with rising F2, independent of participant group (u*: F2;\noverall slope -1.9 (1.0)). In other words, both synaesthetes and controls tended to judge open vowels\nsuch as [a] (with high F1) as containing a high proportion of red, and front vowels such as [i] (with\nhigh F2) as containing a high proportion of green, confirming hypothesis 1 with respect to F1 and\nextending it by finding regularities in F2 for green as well. A trend was also found for front vowels\n(with high F2) to be judged as more yellow (with a higher v*) than back vowels, with a trend indicat-\ning this is specific to synaesthetes (v*: F2, F2  Group; synaesthete slope 3.7 (1.9), control slope 20.1\n(0.7)). These colour associations broadly resemble the results of Marks (1975) who found that open\nvowels were associated with red (or blue) and front vowels with yellow (or white).\n1Because a relationship between formants and colour choices was to be expected a priori according to\nthe findings of previous research such as Marks (1975) and Wrembel (2009), including the formants\nas covariates allows us to more accurately assess the effect of colour associations.\nCross-modal associations in synaesthesia 136\nThe relation between F1 (or openness) and redness\u00adgreenness allows for interpretation at vari-\nous levels. Many species make themselves appear \"larger\" both visually and auditorily to threaten\nadversaries (Harris, Fitch, Goldstein, & Fashing, 2006). Mouth and jaw opening, which contribute\nto perceived threat, increase both frequency and intensity of F1, as well as overall vowel intensity\n(Fairbanks, House, & Stevens, 1950). The association of open vowels (high F1) with red might thus\nreflect a shared semantic association with threat, dominance or warning (Humphrey, 1976); or, at\na psychophysical level, with the tendency for red to appear closer in space to the perceiver than\nFigure 2. Colour choices of synaesthetes (a) (filled circles) and controls (b) (blank squares) projected onto the\nCIELUV colour space. Data points show the averaged u* and v* values per group per vowel. Note that the two\naxes have been inverted and the u* axis is mirrored to resemble how the synaesthetes' responses are similar to the\nvowel space shown in Figure 1. Whiskers of one standard error (SE) were inserted for the vowels C1, C4.5 and\nC8 to show the response variability for these corner vowels.\n137 Moos A, Smith R, Miller S R, Simmons D R\nTable 1.

Alternatively, [a] is one of the commonest vowels cross-linguisti-\ncally (Liljencrants & Lindblom, 1972) and red one of the most prototypical colours (Berlin & Kay,\n1999); this statistical correspondence might underlie their association, as for grapheme frequency\nLuminance associations\nIn both the grey-shade and the colour task, L* (luminance) of responses increased significantly both\nsynaesthetes and controls chose lighter shades for open (high F1) and front (high F2) vowels, con-\nfirming hypothesis 2 with respect to F2, and extending it to F1. The significant interaction of F2 with\ngroup in the grey-shade task (L*: F2  Group) indicates that F2 influences synaesthetes' luminance\nassociations more strongly than those of controls (synaesthete slope 2.2 (0.5), control slope 0.8 (0.4)).\nThe relations of vowel formants with lightness accord with findings that lightness associates with\nhigher musical pitch and \"clearer\" timbre (Marks, 1975; Ward et al., 2006). Pitch--lightness cor-\nrespondences have been frequently documented, in humans and recently in chimpanzees (Ludwig,\nAdachi, & Matsuzawa, 2011), but it remains unclear whether they result from structural similarities\nbetween neural processing of different stimulus dimensions, and/or from environmental statistical\nregularities and/or (in humans) semantically mediated associations (Spence, 2011).\nConsistency\nFigure 3 illustrates differences in response consistency between a representative synaesthete and con-\ntrol. In the colour task, synaesthetes responded more consistently, as predicted (hypothesis 3), choos-\ning their most frequent colour for each vowel significantly more often than controls (12.0 vs. 7.8\nCross-modal associations in synaesthesia 138\nFigure 3.

Bar height indicates how often a colour was chosen per vowel (each box shows responses for one\nvowel). Colours are arranged in alphabetical order along the x-axis: 1 black, 2 blue, 3 brown, 4 cyan, 5 dark blue,\n139 Moos A, Smith R, Miller S R, Simmons D R\nsynaesthetes' consistent behaviour relies on the availability of colour information; they are not more\nsystematic than controls under achromatic conditions.\nThe random effects structure of the ANCOVA results supports this picture: In the colour task\n(Table 2, Colours), synaesthetes showed significantly greater within-subject consistency than controls\nin L* and v*. Between-subject agreement was significantly smaller for synaesthetes than controls with\nrespect to F2 on the v* scale. For grey-shade choices (Table 2, Grey-Shades), within-subject consist-\nency was again significantly larger in synaesthetes than controls, but participant groups did not differ\nin between-subject agreement.\nThus, synaesthetes' individual colour choices were much more consistent than controls' (hypoth-\nesis 3), as also observed for grapheme\u00adcolour associations (e.g., Simner et al., 2005). The evidence\nfor synaesthetes being more consistent than controls is weaker for the grey shade task, and significant\nonly on some measures. This diminished contrast between synaesthetes' and controls' consistency\nperformance in the grey shade task could be related to the observation that some synaesthetes reported\nthat the task of assigning grey-shades to vowels was difficult or disturbing, presumably because a key\ndimension of their inherent associations was unavailable, whereas controls seemed to find it easier to\nuse the light\u00addark dimension in their associations.\n4 General discussion\nOur results showed that shifts in the chromaticity of colour associations were systematically influ-\nenced by vowel acoustics, confirming hypothesis 1. Likewise, hypothesis 2 was confirmed with results\nof the achromatic part of the experiment: Front vowels with a high second formant were associated\nwith lighter shades than back vowels. These results were found for both participant groups; however,\nsynaesthetes' colour associations were more consistent than those of non-synaesthetes, i.e. the same\nvowel sounds induced mostly the same or similar colour associations (consistent with hypothesis 3).\nTable 2.

The \"F\" column gives F ratios for the differences in variance between syn-\naesthete and control groups, for the intercept (\"between-subject mean\"), for spe-\ncific fixed effects (\"between-subject F1, F2\") and residually (\"within-subject\").\nAn F ratio of 1 implies equality of variance between participant groups; F  1\nindicates that controls are more variable than synaesthetes; F  1 indicates that\nsynaesthetes are more variable than controls. Significant differences between\nparticipant groups are in bold.\nCross-modal associations in synaesthesia 140\nOur synaesthete participants considered themselves to have letter\u00adcolour associations, yet showed\nsystematic, fine-grained influences from acoustic\u00adphonetic structure. Is grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthe-\nsia therefore fundamentally a phonetic phenomenon? We do not take this view, but rather propose that\nacoustic\u00adphonetic influences co-exist with established effects such as graphemes' frequency of occur-\nrence (Simner et al., 2005). Suggestive supporting evidence comes from participants' responses to\ndifferent sounds that can correspond to the grapheme <a>. In Scottish English, the commonest pronun-\nciation of <a> in words (e.g. hat) resembles C4.5; but the name of the letter <a>, and its pronunciation\nin words like hate, resembles C2. For several Scottish synaesthetes in our sample, C2 had the same\ncolour as C4.5, and formed an \"island\" distinct from the more finely graded colours of phonetically-\nneighbouring vowels, suggesting its colour was influenced by the pronunciation of <a>.\nIf phonetic and graphemic influences do co-exist, the presentation modality in specific experiments\nmay be key to understanding the balance among them. Our method, with its multiple presentations of\nsubtly-varying sound qualities, was better able to detect acoustic\u00adphonetic influences than are written\nsurveys eliciting responses to letters from a small number of visual presentations.\nIn terms of their potential neural basis, our data cannot be accounted for solely by hyper-connection\nbetween adjacent brain regions dedicated exclusively to processing visual graphemes and colour. They\ncould be explained in several other ways, e.g. if visual grapheme regions also perform more multimo-\ndal or integrative functions (cf. Sharp, Scott, & Wise, 2004), or in terms of other routes, or alterna-\ntive interactional mechanisms, connecting auditory and colour areas (cf. Grossenbacher & Lovelace,\ngrapheme\u00adcolour synaesthetes also show hyper-connectivity in the parietal regions implicated in bind-\ning, suggesting that their unusual abilities might relate to letter\u00adsound integration in general, rather\nthan visual letter processing specifically (see Hubbard et al., 2011, and Rouw, Scholte, & Colizoli,\n2011, for further discussion). Furthermore, given the developmental precedence of language learning\nover reading, the foundations of synaesthesia could be laid even earlier in development than previ-\nously thought (Maurer & Mondloch, 2005). As for the non-synaesthetes, they seem to show the same\ntrends in responses as the synaesthetes but to a lesser degree and with significantly less consistency.\nWhether this provides evidence for a \"synaesthesia continuum\" or simply \"cross-modal integration\"\nwill depend on theoretical standpoint (Spence, 2011).\n5 Conclusions\nWe found that synaesthetes and controls show regular patterns in their vowel sound--colour associa-\ntions, while synaesthetes' associations are stronger and more consistent. The reduced difference be-\ntween the two groups in association consistency with grey shades emphasises that synaesthetes use a\ndimension in their associations which is not obvious to controls, such as the scale of grey shades from\nwhite to black might be. As Spence (2011) has observed, the relationship between acoustic stimula-\ntion and concurrent visual perceptions in both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes is hard to classify\nin terms of other cross-modal correspondences. Our data add a further dimension to this conundrum\nby suggesting that the acoustic\u00adphonetic structure must be considered alongside graphemic structure\nwhen trying to explain the commonest forms of synaesthesia.\nReferences\nBaron-Cohen, S., Harrison, J., Goldstein, L.
