Despite sub-\nstantial international progress and development efforts toward\nthe advancement of women in all societies, a large number of\nwomen in developing countries, including Ghana, continue to\nbe victims of gender inequality and marginalization (Kurz &\nJohnson-Welch, 2000). In Ghana, women have not been very\nsuccessful in altering their political and economic locations\nand have not kept pace with their men in gaining much access\nto political decision making and participation.\n16 seats or formed 8% of the parliamentary seats. This num-\nber has been increased to 10.9% or 25 seats out of a total of\nUnion, 2005). For example, Rwanda is one African coun-\ntry with the highest percentage of 49% of women parlia-\nmentarians in that country's Parliament (British Broadcasting\nCorporation [BBC], 2008). Also, women in South Africa,\nMozambique, and Seychelles hold one third of parliamen-\ntary seats in their respective countries and Swaziland has one\nthird of seats in the upper house of Parliament, and Namibian\nand Ugandan women hold 42% and one third of local govern-\nment seats, respectively (Hassim & Meintjes, 2005). The\naverage number of women legislators inAfrica has increased\nfrom 1% to 14.6%, with the biggest increase occurring\n(1999), improvements in women's political participation do\nnot automatically mean that they will be effective in articulat-\ning their gender interests in public domain. However, given\nequal opportunity and access, women can effectively pro-\nmote their gender and other related issues and interests.Also,\nprocesses of democratization, changes in institutional rules,\nand changes to the culture of politics and political parties that\nencourage inclusion and equality are necessary for women's\neffective political participation.\nSituation of Women in Ghana\nGhana is one of the first countries in Africa to ratify a number\nof international human rights treaties and conventions for\n1University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMarie-Antoinette Sossou, College of Social Work, University of Kentucky,\nEmail: msossou@uky.edu\nWe Do Not Enjoy Equal Political\nRights: Ghanaian Women's Perceptions\non Political Participation in Ghana\nMarie-Antoinette Sossou1\n Keywords\nAfrica, gender/sexuality and politics, human rights, sex and gender, women's studies\n2 SAGE Open\nwomen's rights and gender issues such as the 1979 Convention\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen (CEDAW). Also, the 1992 constitution of the country\nenumerates certain fundamental human rights and freedoms\nfor all people in the country. For example, Section 17,\nSubsections 1 and 2, and Section 27 of the constitution have a\nspecific nondiscrimination provision that includes gender and\nwomen's rights issues (Republic of Ghana, 1992). Despite\nthese constitutional provisions and international treaties, cus-\ntoms and cultural practices continue to adversely affect the\nrights and lives of women in Ghana. According to the 2000\nGhana Living Standards Survey, Ghana has a total popula-\n21.1% of men have no formal education and therefore could\nnot read or write.\nHistorically, women have been oppressed and dominated\nby the patriarchal society in Ghana. Since the attainment of\nindependence in Ghana, women have increasingly moved\ninto the paid labor force; however, women still lag behind men\nin all sectors. In most traditional Ghanaian communities,\nthe inferior status of women was quite evident. Women were\ntaught to accept their position through the socialization pro-\ncess, including their initiation rites. They were taught to be\nobedient wives and to respect their elders. They were told\nthat a man could marry more than one woman (Manu 1984;\nwomen in traditional Ghanaian society was reinforced by a\nnumber of factors, including social practices, religious beliefs,\nand the practice of polygamy, child marriage, and widow\ninheritance. Many of these practices are still found today in\nsome places in the country.\nConcerning access to education, the 2000 Population and\nHousing Census in Ghana indicates that 54.3% of female aged\n15 years and above have never been to school despite efforts\nbeing made to increase girls'education in the country. Gender\nparity between girls and boys has almost been achieved at the\npreschool or early childhood education level. However, the\ngap begins to widen from the basic or primary school level to\njunior high and high school levels. For example, at the junior\nsecondary school or junior high school level, the percentage\nboth high school postsecondary levels, with female constitut-\ning only 33% at high schools and postsecondary institutions\n(Ghana Statistical Service, 2002). Despite the introduction\nof free compulsory and universal basic education policy\n(FCUBE) in 1994, girls' enrolment in schools continues to\nbe low, especially in the rural communities of the country.\nSchool taxes and indirect costs such as book user fees, school\nuniforms, and school supplies have made education costly,\neven though enrolment is free in the public schools.\nPolitically, women in Ghana are underrepresented in the\nsense that few of them hold political offices or participate in\nformal political organizations. Their invisibility can be docu-\nmented at all levels of government. Two interrelated factors\nexplain the political underrepresentation of women in Ghana.\nFirst, politics is viewed by most men and women as the quint-\nessential male sphere of action, one in which women are both\nunwelcome and ineffective. Second, most politically active\nwomen are members of the elite group. Better educated\nand wealthier, these women often pursue a political agenda\nthat reflects their class rather than their gender interests\nRationale ofThis Study\nLack of gender equality and women's subordination in Ghana\nis the focal point of this study, and without equal participation\nby women in public decision making, policies are likely to be\ngender-blind, causing deleterious short- and long-term effects\non women, children, and families. The premise of this study\nis that the Ghanaian society can function better for all its\nmembers when both men and women are equally included and\ninvolved in development processes, public policy making, and\npolitical decision making and participation. Therefore, hear-\ning the voices of women concerning their views and percep-\ntions of their lack of equal political participation is essential\nfor the gender equality discourse.\nMethod\nThis study employs an explorative qualitative research using\nphenomenology as the primary research methodology. The\nessence of using phenomenology as a research methodology\nis to understand the phenomena, things, or events in the\neveryday world, from the viewpoint of the experiencing\npersons, and in this study, the views of Ghanaian women on\ngender and political participation. The data collection tech-\nnique used in this study was focus group discussions and\ndemographic survey. An interview guide consisting of open-\nended questions on the phenomenon of gender equality was\nused for the collection of data from the focus group discus-\nsions. The demographic survey was utilized in collecting\nsocioeconomic data concerning education, religion, occupa-\ntion, age, and ethnicity as represented in Table 1. The study\ntook place in two regions, namely, Greater Accra and the\nVolta Regions in Ghana. These regions were selected for a\nnumber of reasons. First, Accra is the national capital and has\na total population of about three million people according to\n2000 national census. In addition, the following factors were\nalso taken into account: the size of the population; the sizes\nof the migrant population; the diversity of cultural, educa-\ntional, economical, religious, and ethnic patterns; and the\nheterogeneity of the people and groups. The inclusion of the\nVolta region and the rural communities was meant to create\nsome balance fairness to the rural setting, divergence, and\nvariations. Volta region is more homogeneous as compared\nwith Greater Accra region, thus, its inclusion.\nTwo groups were identified and purposively selected\nthrough the Women Unit of the Department of Community\nDevelopment in Accra as this department is responsible for\norganizing women groups for social development. The other\nfour groups were selected by the use of snowball technique\nwith assistance from teachers and university students identi-\nfied by the researcher. In all, six focus groups, made up of\n68 participants, were held in two rural and four urban locations\nwithin the two regions. The main purpose for choosing a\nfocus group discussion as the data collection technique was to\ndraw on the women's attitudes, feelings, beliefs, experiences,\nand reactions in a way that would not be feasible using other\nmethods, for example, observation, one-to-one interviewing,\nor questionnaires. These attitudes, feelings, and beliefs may\nbe partially independent of the group or the social setting but\nare more likely to be revealed through the social gathering\nand the interaction of being in a group discussion.\nThe interview guide with the relevant questions concerning\ngender equality and related issues guided the group discus-\nsions. The main question that formed the basis of this study is\n\"How do women understand the meaning and the concept of\ngender equality in Ghana?\" Gender equality is taken to mean\nthat men and women should have equal conditions and\nopportunities for realizing their full human rights and poten-\ntials. As gender equality is a broad concept and difficult to\ncomprehend by the participants, the interview guide was\nconstructed with a breakdown of the term of gender equality\ninto concrete or specific relevant issues concerning women's\nsubordination and oppression. The participants were asked\ntwo specific questions concerning their perceptions about\ntheir political participation as women in Ghana. For exam-\nple, the participants were asked to describe themselves in\nterms of gender equality and their political participation as\nwomen. Second, the participants were asked to discuss whether\nit is possible to have a woman as a president in Ghana. These\nquestions were posed to explore women's own knowledge,\nroles, and voices about their gender equality and political par-\nticipation as women. A number of women have held political\npositions as women ministers and heads of departments, hence\nthe need to explore the second question of a woman ever\naspiring to become a president in Ghana.\nThe discussions took place in local classrooms, church\nhalls, and a community center. Two research assistants with\nmaster's degree assisted this researcher collecting data during\nthe focus group discussions. They assisted with interpreta-\ntion and translation of research questions from English to the\nappropriate local dialects to the research participants. The\ninterpretation and translation were essential during the rural\nfocus group discussions as most of the participants spoke\nonly their local dialect. The other four focus group discus-\nsions were conducted in English as most of the participants\nwere literates. All the group discussions were tape recorded\nand later transcribed verbatim by a paid transcriber, the\nresearch assistants, and the researcher. The transcriptions\nwere supplemented by field notes taken during the group dis-\ncussions. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was\nsought and approved by the researcher's institution and as a\nresult, consent forms spelling out the reasons for the research\nand the essence of confidentiality and voluntary participation\nwas read, signed, and thumbprinted by all literate and illiter-\nate participants before data collection took place. To protect\nparticipants' anonymity, only generalized descriptions of the\ngroups, sites, and themes are presented in the findings.\nResearch Participants\nPurposive sampling technique was used to select 68 partici-\npants to participate in six different focus group discussions.\nThe participants were from a broad cross-section of the\nGhanaian population in terms of ethnicity, age, family situa-\ntion, economic situation, education, religion, and patterns of\nresidence that is both rural and urban (Table 1). As Ghana is\nethnically diverse, an effort was made to include participants\nfrom most of the major ethnic groups in the country. Two\nregions were selected for this study and the selection was\nNo. Percentage\nAge\nMarital status\nEducation\nResidence\nOccupation\nEthnicity\nReligion\n4 SAGE Open\nbased on the fact that one region has a very diverse and het-\nerogeneous population groups from all parts of the country\nand the second region was more homogeneous and less cul-\nturally diverse.\nData Analysis\nPhenomenological methods are particularly effective at\nbringing to the fore the experiences and perceptions of indi-\nviduals from their own perspectives. Adding an interpretive\ndimension to phenomenological research enables it to be\nused as the basis for practical theory and allows it to inform,\nsupport, or challenge policy and social action. Therefore, the\nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) by Smith,\nJarman, and Osborn (1999) was adopted as a guideline for this\nanalysis. This analysis advocates an idiographic approach,\nwhere the researcher engages in close textual analysis of tran-\nscripts before moving on to begin to look for commonalities\nbetween individuals. By this process, an idiographic, case-\nstudy approach is outlined, where the analysis slowly builds\nfrom the reading of individual cases to claims for a group.\nThe aim of IPA is to explore in detail the participant's view of\nthe topic under investigation. Thus, the approach is phenom-\nenological in that it is concerned with an individual's personal\nperception or account of an object or event as opposed to an\nattempt to produce an objective statement of the object or\nevent itself (Smith et al, 1999). Hence, the interpretation of\nthe phenomena in this study is to provide insight into how,\nthrough the human situation, the phenomena of gender equal-\nity or inequalities come to have personal meaning, a lived-\nthrough significance that may not always be transparent to\nconsciousness.\nThe actual data analysis began with verbatim transcription\nof the focus group discussion tapes. The audio-recorded tapes\nwere played repeatedly and transcribed verbatim. After the\ntranscription, time was spent reading through the transcripts a\nnumber of times and making notes of interesting or significant\nwords, statements, and key words that captured the essence of\nthe topic. In addition, connecting themes that reflect connec-\ntions with previous sections of the interview were searched\nfor and noted. I took notice of similarities and differences\nin themes about what the participants said and also took\nnotice of similarities and differences in the themes from both\nthe urban and rural groups. I made a list of all the emergent\nthemes and ordered them coherently. This form of analysis\ninvolved a close interaction between the text, myself, and\nan attempt to understand what a particular participant was\nsaying and at the same time drawing on my own interpreta-\ntive resources. To introduce some order and form into the\nanalysis, I decided to use the master-theme list from the first\ninterview to begin the analysis of the second and the subse-\nquent ones.\nI looked for more instances of similar themes identified in\nthe first group discussion in the remaining discussions and\nalso identified new themes that came up as well. The next\nprocess was the arrangement of the related patterns into coher-\nent clusters, and this made it possible to identify emergent\ncommon themes. The decision regarding the selection of the\nthemes was guided by the rule of two confirmations and no\ncontradiction (Miles & Huberman, 1994). This means that at\nleast two responses from the participants confirmed the\nthemes as essential lived experiences. The analytical discus-\nsions of the themes are supported with direct quotations from\nthe participants' narratives. Direct quotations reveal partici-\npants' depth of emotions, their experiences, and their basic\nperceptions of the issue.\nCredibility andTrustworthiness\nFor Moustakas (1994), establishing the truth of things begins\nwith the researcher's perception. He also discusses verifi-\ncation using informant feedback. In this study, verification\nwas carried out mostly by discussing the findings with\nsome of the participants in an informal group discussion,\nafter the initial transcription was done. The transcripts\nwere read and interpreted to four groups of the participants\nfor their comments and views. Three urban groups and\none rural group were selected and convened again for this\nmember check. These participants were satisfied with the\nreport and readily accepted it as their own ideas or as their\nauthentic voices. Another technique used in establishing\ncredibility of this study was peer review or peer debriefing.\nThis process involved the discussion of the findings with\nthe research assistants who assisted with the fieldwork.\nThis peer review provided the opportunity for us to discuss\nsome of the emerging themes, the plights, and the everyday\nstruggles of the participants and ideas for future research\nprojects.\nResearch Findings\nThe study identifies three main themes, which are (a) We are\nrelegated to the background, (b) we face cultural, educational,\nand financial barriers, and (c) we occupy the lower positions\nin political parties.\nWe Are Relegated to the Background\nThe discussion of these three main themes revealed that\nwomen in Ghana do not enjoy equal political participation in\nGhana.According to most of the participants, they experienced\ngender inequality and discrimination even in the political par-\nties they belong to as members. The findings discussed the\nopinions and admission of both rural and urban participants,\neducated and uneducated, about their lack of active political\ninvolvement and participation. A number of urban partici-\npants referred to their position as women as \"being relegated\nto the background.\" These participants were of the view that\nas women, the Ghanaian society does not give them equal\nchance as compared with their male counterparts and so they\nplay second fiddle to the men. These opinions have been\nexpressed in direct quotations as follows:\nTradition has a tremendous impact on the situation of\nthe Ghanaian woman. A woman is always in the back-\nground and when a woman is outspoken, she is given\nall kinds of names.\nOur situation is difficult because of our entrenched tra-\nditional beliefs and norms. The traditional notion is that\nmen are the heads and this notion is working through\nevery sphere of life and including the political sphere.\nMen do not encourage us and they look down on us,\nand would not even vote for a woman as a candidate.\nThey discount whatever we say as \"women's talk.\"\nEven in parliament women are not allowed to exercise\ntheir rights. We do not often hear our female parlia-\nmentarians speak because the men take the floor all\nthe time.\nWe Face Cultural, Educational,\nand Financial Barriers\nThe participants described their personal experiences as being\ncharacterized by negative, cultural, and traditional practices\ntoward women; lack of adequate education; and struc-\ntural financial barriers as obstacles that militate against their\nequal participation, even if they are interested in politics. Both\nrural and urban participants identified some of the barriers\nthat prevent women from effectively participating in poli-\ntics or daring to stand as a parliamentary or a presidential\ncandidate in Ghana. For example, in terms of financial oppor-\ntunities, a number of urban participants believe\nFor example, women do not have the necessary\nresources and capital to engage in active politics\nbecause politic is very expensive and most women\nare handicapped financially.\nThe men for too long have dominated us both finan-\ncially and I think women in this country are getting fed\nup with the situation.\nThe participants also discussed the negative effects of the\ncultural and social educational program that socializes young\nwomen from birth into roles that are removed from the world\nof public decision making. They asserted that the aim of\ngirls' training was generally to make them into good wives\nand mothers. On the contrary, a number of urban participants\nbelieved that if women are given the educational opportuni-\nties and proper training, they could become politically active\nand even stand for election as a president of the country one\nday. Some of the comments were as follows:\nI believe that with time and the required education,\nGhana could have a female president. However, for\nnow, we women still believe that men are better\nendowed than women are.\nIt is only possible for women if our cultural norms are\nrelaxed to allow women to further their education.\nBefore an individual can be totally liberated, the one\nmust be educated because knowledge is power and if\none does not know how to deliver herself when in dif-\nficulty, one cannot make progress in life. Therefore\nsociety has an obligation to help women and women\nmust organize to fight for their rights.\nCulturally, participants also expressed the barriers of mari-\ntal obligations to husbands, children, and families as another\nobstacle to their inability to fully engage in politics.According\nto some of them, their husbands and family members are often\nreluctant to have their wives and women in their households in\nthe public domain. The following comments were expressed\nby a few rural participants as follows:\nOur husbands will not even encourage us and they will\neven tell us the political party we should vote for.\nOne could get into serious problem with the husband\nshould one vote for another political party and since\nwomen are so concerned about the stability of their\nhomes, they tend to obey their husbands in matters\nlike this.\nA number of urban participants also believed that women\nas a group are not very supportive of each other when it\ncomes to supporting women in politics. They believed that\nwomen would not even vote for a fellow woman. They\nexpressed their views as follows:\nWomen would not even vote for a female president\neven if she has the courage to stand for the position.\nAll depends on the women, if only we stop being each\nother's enemy. We are in the majority yet we are the\nsame people who will assassinate the character of the\nfemale presidential candidate.\nWomen are their worst enemies because most women\nare jealous and do not do much to improve their lots\nand if a fellow woman decides to excel, we defame the\nperson and do nothing to encourage one another.\nI do not think any Ghanaian woman would dare to\nstand for presidency because women in general\nlook down upon themselves and do not support each\nother.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn examining the possibility of a woman being a presiden-\ntial candidate in Ghana, this question was posed to the groups\nbecause, some women have held various ministerial positions\nin the country in the past and it is crucial to know their views\non the possibility of Ghana ever having a female presiden-\ntial candidate. This question generated an argument among a\ngroup of urban participants in relation to the type of woman\nwho could dare put herself up for a presidential candidate in\nGhana. Some participants believed a single woman or a sin-\ngle mother with no marital affiliations to man could be an\neffective political leader. Their assertion was based on the\nbelief that as a single woman, she would not be burdened\nwith marital obligations and conflict of interest or harassment\nfrom the husband.\nA number of urban participants expressed their views as\nIt is possible to have a female president but it will not be\neasy to achieve because our traditions pose a stumbling\nblock. Such a woman would be ridiculed and snubbed\nby the men and even by her own family members.\nOnly a single mother or woman who has experienced\nthe rough edges of life would want to venture into the\npresidency. This is so because she will have a tough\npersonality that will enable her to organize women\nvery well.\nI support the notion that a female president of this\ncountry must be a single mother because my sister who\nwas a Member of Parliament in 1992 incurred the dis-\npleasure of her husband because of her political ambi-\ntion. The husband threatened to divorce her but she\nhowever ignored the threat.\nI do not agree that only a single woman could become\na president. A married woman could become a presi-\ndent too if women are able to get over petty squabbles,\nattitudinal problems and their inferiority complex and\nsocietal prejudices.\nWe Occupy the Lower\nPositions in Political Parties\nThis is the third main theme, and it relates to participants'\nindividual experiences and challenges concerning their mem-\nbership in political parties. The urban participants asserted\nmen have held national leadership positions in all political\nparties since independence in 1957 to date. They attributed\nthe lack of political support for female candidates to lack of\npolitical experience, male norms, and structures that prohib-\nited female participation. They also asserted that the negative\ncultural norms and attitudes toward women contribute to lack\nof leadership-oriented training programs and political educa-\ntion for women. According to them, these shortcomings are\noftentimes reflected in voting patterns, media coverage of\nfemale politicians and political intimidation, and harassment\nof women politicians in the country.\nA participant sums the low position of women in political\nparties as follows:\nWhen one takes a look at the roles women play in the\npolitical parties, one would realize that women have\nnot yet taken up the challenge to rise up to the top. The\nhighest position the woman is given in a political party\nis that of a women's organizer and not as a presidential\ncandidate.\nDiscussion and Implications\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995)\nand the Beijing Platform for Action have provided new\nimpetus for governments and civil society organizations to\naddress gender inequalities in society at all levels. Gender\nmainstreaming is one of the approaches to advancing gender\nequality, and it involves addressing gender inequalities in all\naspects of development, across all sectors and programs.\nMainstreaming is not simply about ensuring that women's\nposition is improved within existing frameworks which are\ndominated by men. Gender is mainstreamed when the devel-\nopment process and frameworks are transformed in ways\nwhich ensure the participation and empowerment of women\nas well as men in all aspects of life, especially in political\ndecision-making structures.\nThe findings of this study indicate that Ghanaian women\nare still on a long winding path to achieving gender equality\nand equal political decision making and participation in their\ncountry. An outstanding feature of these participants' insight\nis the admission of their low political participation as women\nin Ghana and this admission did not significantly differ by\neducation, income, and social class. Surprisingly, the major-\nity of the participants in this study could be classified as being\nin the low-middle, socioeconomic class. Most of them had at\nleast post\u00adhigh school and some college education and they\nworked as professionals and semiprofessionals in their vari-\nous occupations as teachers and public servants. These fac-\ntors indicate their knowledge and awareness of the challenges\nthey faced as women and the cultural and traditional block-\nades they have to overcome to achieve equal political partici-\npation. In addition, they identified their inferior position as\nwomen compared with the men and their own negative activi-\nties and lack of support for their fellow women as some obsta-\ncles. Other factors identified are the structural barriers of male\ndomination of the political bureaucracy, institutional sexism,\nand the patriarchal system that imposed limitations on women\nand discount them as inferior and second fiddle to the men.\nThey also discussed the cultural socialization and sexist\nattitudes and perceptions that put women in the gender box\nof being mothers, wives, and care providers for their hus-\nbands, children, and other family members. Lack of politi-\ncal training and education, poor access to financial resources,\nand preparation for working in the political arena were also\ndiscussed as other barriers to women's political involvement\nand participation in Ghana.\nThe study has also revealed the display of tokenism in\nterms of putting a few women in decision making and politi-\ncal positions as showcases. The political system is one of the\nmost powerful structures of gender inequality in Ghana. This\nis confirmed by the participants discussions on the negative\nattitude of harassment and hostility of men toward women\nwho dared to enter into politics. It is evident that Ghana has\nexperienced some modest increase in women's participa-\ntion in leadership and public decision making. The number\nonly 2 are women and only 2 ministers of state and 5 deputy\nministers are women. There are only 4 women out of a total\nof 45 members of the Council of State. This is the council\nthat advises the president on national affairs of the country.\nFor the first time in the history of the country, the chief jus-\ntice of the Supreme Court is a woman and the speaker of\ncountry's Parliament is also a woman. Likewise, at the local\nor the district level of the country, women's participation has\nwomen. This increase still falls short of the 40% target set by\nthe national plan of action (Ministry ofWomen and Children's\nThe challenge facing Ghanaian women politically is not\nunique to women in Ghana alone. Several studies from other\nAfrican countries indicate the same predicaments for women\nacross the continent. Ferguson and Katundu (1994) discussed\na number of negative reports about women who dared to\nenter into politics in Zambia. For example, they found that\nsome Zambia women were threatened with divorce and for-\nbidden by their husbands to enter into politics and even in\nnational Parliaments; women have difficulties being accepted\nfor who they are and are not taken seriously and/or even lis-\ntened to. Tamale (1999) in her study of women in parliamen-\ntary politics in Uganda found that women parliamentarians\nare frequently subjected to humiliating sexual stereotypes and\nderogatory remarks and sexual harassment. Legislation for\nvarious forms of equality has been passed and continued to\nbe in effect. However, the pace of actual change that will be\nbeneficial to women is very slow. Even though women are\nbecoming active in politics, they are still too often subordi-\nnates in the system. It is evident that educated women and\ngender activists who have shown interest in politics have\nbeen assaulted physically to teach them to stay out of poli-\ntics (Nzomo, 1997). Politicians and political leaders view\ncontemporary African women politicians as ambitious and\nas embodying interests that are antithetical to the interests of\nthe state.\nOngom (1999) states that the belief that women are good as\ncooks, sex providers, and juniors are still persistent. For exam-\nple, women are given ministries that are considered useless to\nthe economy and therefore not so demanding. This is simply\nto prove the point that women cannot take on hectic jobs. For\ninstance, out of the 26 cabinet ministers in Uganda, only 6 are\nwomen, and they occupy very silent ministerial posts that are\nconsidered not of utmost importance, and out of the total of\n35 state ministers, only 11 are women. This means, out of\n66 ministers in Uganda, only 17 are women signifying less\nOngom (1999) also states that women in Uganda, just like\nwomen in Ghana, lag behind in decision making. Although\nclear legal systems are in place to address women's partici-\npation in policy making, the implementation of this policy is\nderailed by gender discrimination in all sectors. The dilemma\nwomen face today is how to change the attitudes and percep-\ntions that they cannot perform or engage in full decision\nmaking that affect society. Namibia and South Africa have\nconstitutions that provide for affirmative actions to enhance\nthe numbers of women in policy- and decision-making posi-\ntions. In South Africa, 20% of parliamentary seats and 50%\nof local governing councils seats are reserved for women\n(African Center for Women/Economic Commission forAfrica\n[ACW/ECA], 1998). Angola, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe also\nhave quota legislation guaranteeing certain numbers of\nwomen in legislative assemblies. However, vigilance is still\ncalled for to prevent backsliding and political manipulation\nHowever, six African countries are leading in terms of\nwomen's representation in national assemblies due to affir-\nmative action and quotas. These countries are Rwanda lead-\nwith 32.8% of women representation in parliament. Burundi\nhas 30.5% of women in parliament and Seychelles has\n29.4% of women in parliament. In addition, Namibia has\n26.9% of women representation in parliament and Ghana\nhas only 10.9% of women in parliament (Inter-Parliamentary\nUnion, 2005). Also, for the first time in the postindepen-\ndence period, a number of African women began to aspire to\npolitical leadership at the national and local levels. Female\nfaces and voices are beginning to be seen and heard in some\nAfrican countries even though their impact is still minimal\nand their obstacles daunting. The 1990s had been credited as\na decade of beginning for women in politics in Africa. Until\nthis period, it was unheard of for women to run for the presi-\ndency in Africa.\nIn 1998, two women in Kenya ran in the presidential elec-\ntion of that country and two other women in Tanzania and\nNigeria also sought their political parties' nominations in\nAlthough they were unsuccessful in their struggle for politi-\ncal power, they have set an important precedence in their\nrespective countries and have shown that given the chance,\nwomen can equally become presidents in their own right and\nLiberia has taken the lead by electing the first female presi-\ndent in Africa (Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2005). This is an\nindication that there is a chance for more female presidential\n8 SAGE Open\ncandidates on the future horizon in Ghana and other African\ncountries.\nConclusion\nThe attainment of full political participation of women in\nGhana is more beyond mere tokenism and political party\nnominations. It is important to explore the issues surround-\ning the ideology of gender relations and power relations.\nThe various institutions and structures, such as the family,\nthe educational system, the religious institutions as well as the\nsocial, economic, legal, and political structures in the society\nmust undergo major structural transformation that will stop\nreproducing unequal power and gender relations. According\nto Reynolds (1999), the sociocultural barriers to the represen-\ntation of women can be overcome but the process evolves\ntime and it also entails both male and female coming to\naccept the legitimacy of women in positions of power. That\nis, until every voter sees the election of women into political\nposition as normal and not something unusual or just based\non tokenism.\nTo overcome the institutionalized power relations and\nbring about total transformation in the system, actual pro-\ncesses of empowerment have to occur at several levels. The\nempowerment process must challenge and change the set of\nideas, attitudes, beliefs, and practices in gender relations; in\ninstitutions and structures such as in the family, the house-\nhold, the villages, the market places, and the churches; and in\nthe local communities. Simon (1990) refers to empowerment\nas a series of attacks on subordination of every description\nsuch as psychic, physical, cultural, sexual, legal, political, eco-\nnomical, and technological. However, the empowerment of\nwomen is not only just an issue of women but also a gender\nissue, which necessitates the reexamination of gender rela-\ntionships by both men and women together. It is also a devel-\nopment issue, in that women who become empowered must\nalso become active not only in economic activities but also in\nexerting pressure and influence on political, social, and legal\nissues concerning women.\nThe full political participation of women in the sociopoliti-\ncal development of Ghana is not just an issue of affirmative\naction and implementation of quota systems. It is a social jus-\ntice and human rights issue that requires social transformation\nand change in the attitudes, institutional and cultural structures\nof the whole society. According to Mosse (1993), a successful\nwomen's organization encourages in its members a capacity\nto interact with a wide range of public systems and struc-\ntures, and in time, is able to transform members into active par-\nticipants in the development of goods, services, and resources,\nrather being passive recipients or targets. She argues that\nthe long-term growth of expertise and confidence within\nwomen's organizations, and their increasing effectiveness in\nthe public domain, are essential to the process of structural\nchange.\nLimitations\nThis study is a qualitative study that used purposive and\nconvenience sample of only 68 participants in six focus group\ndiscussions. Hence, the selection excluded other women from\nother regions and higher socioeconomic social classes across\nthe country. The data were collected through focus group\ndiscussions based mainly on self-reported personal experi-\nences and opinions. Based on the study's qualitative approach,\nsmall sample size, selection bias, and subjectivity, precau-\ntions should be taken in generalizing the findings of this\nstudy to other groups without further study. Given these\nlimitations, however, the study provides direct evidence from\nGhanaian women concerning their gender discrimination and\ncall for action.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAfrican Center for Women/Economic Commission for Africa.\n(1998).
