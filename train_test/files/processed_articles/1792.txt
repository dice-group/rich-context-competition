Use in adults is most common in\nthose with higher income and education, women, and\nthose with chronic health conditions. Clinical, regional,\nand internet-based surveys of adolescents have shown\nhigher DS use among athletes and teens with chronic ill-\nnesses, but these associations need to be confirmed in\npopulation-based national surveys [3-9]. In small clinical\nsurveys, pediatric chronic conditions for which herbal\ntherapies and dietary supplements were reported include:\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma,\natopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, cancer, inflammatory\nbowel disease, headache, and cystic fibrosis [3,10-18].\n(NHANES) found that approximately one fourth of ado-\nsimilar rates [20,21]. However, these analyses did not\nexplore self-reported clinical conditions associated with\nWe conducted this study to describe recent rates of DS use\namong US adolescents and factors associated with that\nuse. Specifically, we wished to describe the prevalence of\nDS use among US adolescents age 11 to 19 and to analyze\nsocio-demographic and clinical factors associated with DS\nuse. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that DS\nuse would be higher among: girls, older adolescents, non-\nHispanic whites, those who diagnosed with common out-\npatient conditions, and those who reported using pre-\nscription medications.\nMethods\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES) [22]. NHANES is a series of nationally repre-\nsentative surveys of the civilian, non-institutionalized\npopulation in the United States administered by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics. The NHANES data\nare collected through household interviews and physical\nexaminations at mobile examination centers. The sam-\npling technique follows a complex, stratified, multi-stage\nprobability design that over-samples adolescents, African\nAmericans, Mexican Americans, and persons of low-\nincome. NHANES has been conducted as a two year data\ncollection with data released for public use in two-year\nhousehold interview response rate was 84 percent. Ado-\nlescents younger than 16 years old had a proxy (family\nmember or guardian) answer for them unless they were an\nindependent minor. Those 16 years and older answered\nthe questions for themselves or had a proxy.\nDS use was assessed from responses to questions asked\nduring the household interview: \"Have you used or taken\nany vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements in\nthe past month?\" Those who said \"yes\" were asked to pro-\nvide dose, frequency, and duration of use and were asked\nto show the supplement containers to the interviewer so\nthat supplement details could be recorded. If the con-\ntainer was not available (about 25 percent of the time),\nparticipants were asked for the exact name of the product,\nor to provide information in as much detail as possible.\nAdditionally, respondents were shown a card during the\ninterview with examples of dietary supplements including\nherbs, vitamins, minerals, fiber supplements, amino\nacids, fish oils, sport supplements, memory and energy\npromoting products. The survey did not ask about medic-\ninal herbal teas, medicinal foods (nutraceuticals), or folk\nremedies.\nAge, sex, race/ethnicity, total family income, physical\nactivity, and health status were generally obtained from\nthe head of household. We dichotomized the age variable\nold. Race/ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic black,\nnon-Hispanic white, Mexican American, and all others.\nHealth status was assessed with the question \"would you\nsay your health in general is... excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor?\" Respondents were asked if they used any\nprescription medications in past month.\nFinally, to address the question as to whether adolescents\nwith common out-patient conditions use more dietary\nsupplements, we extracted data on chronic non-life\nthreatening conditions frequently seen in out-patient\npractices asked about during the NHANES interview.\nQuestions were asked about asthma, being overweight,\nand ADHD with the phrasing, \"Has the doctor or other\nhealth professional ever told you that (you/he/she has) X\n?\". The conditions \"hay fever in past year\" and \"frequent\nsevere headaches in past year\" were based on self report,\nnot physician diagnosis. Many potentially clinically rele-\nvant conditions such as acne, depression, cystic fibrosis,\nand inflammatory bowel disease were not included in the\nsurvey.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe analyzed the data using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and STATA software (version 8; Col-\nlege Station, TX) due complex multistage design we used\nsurvey specific commands in the STATA statistical package\nwhich allowed incorporation of sampling weight strata,\nand primary sampling units to analyze the data. Sampling\nweights included adjustment for non-response, unequal\nprobability of selection used in the sampling design.\nBecause all data used in this study were from the interview\nportions of the surveys, we used the four-year interviewed\nsample weight for the combined analysis of NHANES\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe grouped the DS by category into vitamins/minerals or\nnon-vitamins/minerals. Vitamins/minerals included: 1)\nany multivitamins/minerals (multivitamin/minerals or\nprenatal multivitamin); 2) any single vitamins or miner-\nals. For non-vitamin/mineral DS use we included the fol-\nlowing categories: 1) herbal products (e.g. echinacea,\ngarlic); 2) non-herbal DS (e.g. probiotics, fish oil); and 3)\nappearance or performance enhancing supplements (e.g.\nprotein powders or creatine). Some non-vitamin/mineral\nDS included vitamins as minor ingredients. In our efforts\nto capture the intended DS use by subjects, we used prod-\nuct labeling information and advertising materials to\ndetermine the category assignments.\nWe first assessed the associations between DS use and spe-\ncific socio-demographic and clinical factors using the chi-\nsquare test. Next, we performed multivariable logistic\nregression to assess factors associated independently with\nuse of any DS, any vitamin/mineral DS, and non-vitamin/\nmineral DS, while controlling for demographic, clinical\nfactors, and specific outpatient conditions (asthma,\nADHD, hayfever, headache, overweight). We selected var-\niables for testing in our logistic model based on the results\nof previous studies and entered these variables into the\nfinal model simultaneously [8,20,23]. The variable\nincome was removed from the model due to co-linearity\nwith the variable race/ethnicity (Standard error for race/\nethnicity increased by more than 25% when we added\nincome to the model). Additionally, our original hypoth-\nesis questioned the association with race/ethnicity and\ndietary supplement use. Therefore, we keep race/ethnicity\nin the final model. However, since previous findings\nshowed an association between income and DS use, we\nreport descriptively the impact of income on DS use in the\nbivariate data (table 1) [24,25]. Results of multivariable\nmodels are presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95%\nconfidence intervals. Due to multiple comparisons, statis-\ntical significance was set at a p value of 0.004 (Bonferroni\ncorrection).\nResults\nresenting approximately 36 million US adolescents.\nSlightly more than half of respondents were in the 11 to\n15 years old group and 49% were girls (Table 2). Most\nadolescents reported very good to excellent health (71%).\nHalf of respondents reported one or more outpatient con-\nditions; the most common condition was chronic head-\nobesity (10%) and ADHD (9%). More than one quarter\n(27%) of respondents had used prescription medications\nin the previous month (Table 2).\nOverall, 27% of youth reported using one or more DS in\nthe month prior to the survey. Non-vitamin/mineral DS\nwere used by fewer than 5% of youth (Table 1). Older\nteens used more prenatal vitamins (p = 0.003) and iron (p\nFrequency of using DS was increased in those with higher\nincome. Non-Hispanic white youth used DS more com-\nmonly than minority youth (Table 3). DS use was highest\namong those reporting very good or excellent health and\nlowest among those with poor or fair health. Conversely,\nDS was higher among those who reported using prescrip-\ntion medications than those who did not. OverallDS use\nwas slightly lower in youth diagnosed with asthma or\noverweight and higher among youth with ADHD, hay\nfever, or headache.\nIn the a djusted multivariable model, certain demo-\ngraphic factors remained associated with DS use while\nothers did not (Table 4).

Overall, 27% of adolescents reported using a DS in\nthe last month. DS use was higher among non-Hispanic\nwhites, those who reported better health status, and those\nwho used prescription medications. However, we did not\nfind the expected association between DS use and gender,\nnor after controlling for other factors, between DS use and\nany specific health condition other than headache. The\nfindings that the most commonly used DS by teens were\nmultivitamins (16%) and vitamin C (6%) is reassuring in\nterms of potential health risks. The higher use of non-vita-\nmin/mineral supplements among obese teens raises ques-\ntions about the types and safety of the specific DS used in\nthis growing population.\nThe prevalence of DS use in our sample was consistent\nwith that found in other large studies that used different\nsampling techniques [4,19,26]. The use of some non-vita-\nmin/mineral supplements (e.g. sport and herbal perform-\nance enhancers) in this sample was lower than in studies\nof teen athletes [27-32]. It was also lower than rates\nferences in rates might be due to different usage in differ-\nent groups, differences in the time period of use, and by\ndifferent survey methods such as self report using the\nInternet vs. parent or adolescent response in a face to face\ninterview [4].\nTable 2: Frequency of Dietary Supplements used by US adolescents (Weighted percents)\nType of Dietary Supplement N % users all ages 11 to 19 years % users age11\u00ad15 % users age16\u00ad19 P value between ages difference\nSingle Vitamins/Minerals\nAny non-vitamin/mineral\nsupplements*\nWeight, sport, and\nenhancement supplements**\nOther non-herbal\nsupplements****\n*All non-vitamin/non-mineral supplements include: weight loss, sport, and other enhancement supplements, herbal and other DS.\n**Weight loss, sport, and other enhancement supplements include: creatine, protein powders, stimulants, sport supplements, weight loss\nsupplement, memory enhancers, or energy enhancing products.\n***Herbal DS include: ginseng, gingko, garlic, echinacea, and other herbs.\n**** Other non-herbal DS examples include: fish oil, probiotics, melatonin, glucosamine, and other non herbal non vitamin dietary supplements.\n***** Chi Square test of independence\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nIn the adjusted model, certain demographic factors were\nassociated with supplement use, while others were not.\nWe confirmed findings of another large survey in which\nolder adolescents were more likely than younger teens to\nuse non-vitamin/mineral DS such as herbals, sports and\nweight loss products [4]. Similarly, we confirmed earlier\nreports that non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican American\nadolescents use fewer vitamin/mineral DS than non-His-\npanic white youth [4,19]. On the other hand, unlike ear-\nlier studies, after adjusting for other factors, female gender\nwas not significantly associated with DS use [4,19]. Fur-\nther studies are needed to understand how race, culture,\nincome and health care disparities affect DS use and the\nimpact of this use on health status.\nAs expected, certain clinical factors were also associated\nwith DS use. For example, those reporting very good/\nexcellent health status reported higher rates of DS use,\nconfirming an earlier study [34]. The direction of this\nassociation (Does use of DS cause good health or are\nhealthy teens more likely to use DS?) is a worthy question\nfor future research.\nAs expected, we found a higher rate of DS use among teens\nwho reported using prescription medications than those\nwho did not, even after adjusting for potential covariates\n[23,24]. The etiology and clinical implications of the rela-\ntionship between DS and prescription medication use\nrequires additional exploration. Given reports about clin-\nically serious interactions between prescription drugs and\nherbals/supplements, physicians and pharmacists need to\nbe mindful of the higher use of DS among prescription\nusers, ask prescription medication users about their use of\nDS, and monitor them for adverse effects or interactions.\nThe analysis of DS use by specific health conditions sug-\ngested mixed relationships. For example, obese youth\nwere more likely to use non-vitamin/mineral DS than\ntheir peers. The higher use among obese teens is likely due\nto the inclusion of weight loss products in the non-vita-\nTable 3: Percentage of US adolescents using any DS, any vitamin/minerals, and other non-vitamin/mineral supplements by\ndemographic and health factors\nCharacteristic % using any DS N = 1128 % using any vitamin/minerals N = 961 % using non-vitamin/minerals N = 185\nDemographic Factors\nAge\nGender\nRace/Ethnicity\nFamily income\nClinical Factors\nReported health status\nPrescription medication user\nIndividual conditions\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmin/mineral DS variable; this finding deserves more spe-\ncific scrutiny in future research for two reasons: a) rates of\nobesity are rising; b) weight loss products such as those\ncontaining ephedra can present risks of serious toxicity or\ndrug-DS interaction. Also, adolescents with headaches\nwere more likely to use DS, confirming earlier reports\n[35,36]. Future analyses are needed to look specifically at\ndifferent types of DS with different disorders and the\nimpact of DS use on disease-specific outcomes including\nuse of professional health care, health status, quality of\nlife, and ability to work or attend school.\nDespite its large size, national scope, and extensive,\ndetailed ascertainment of DS use, this analysis has several\nlimitations. First, proxy information was used for\nrespondents less than 16 years old. Proxies (e.g. parents)\ncould have overestimated multivitamin use and under\nestimated use of products teens may have purchased on\ntheir own such as weight loss and performance-enhancing\nsupplements. Second, questions about dietary supple-\nments may have missed products considered home reme-\ndies, folk remedies, or parts of the diet, such as green tea\nor foods containing supplements. Furthermore, the lim-\nited data on specific health conditions reduced our ability\nto assess the complex relationships between diseases and\nDS use. Finally, since NHANES did not ask about reasons\nfor supplement use or the impact of this use on health sta-\ntus, we do not know why teens used certain supplements\nor how it affected their health [37].\nTable 4: Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for use of any DS, any vitamin/minerals, and non-vitamins/mineral use (N =\nCharacteristic Any DS Any vitamin/minerals Any non-vitamin/minerals\nDemographic Factors\nAge\nGender\nRace/Ethnicity\nClinical Factors\nHealth Status\nPrescription medication user\nAsthma\nAttention deficit disorder\nHayfever\nHeadache\nObese\nMultivariable logistic regression: the variable income was removed from the model due to co-linearity with the variable race/ethnicity (Standard\nerror greater then 25%) The original sample size was 5306.

Therefore, physicians\nand pharmacists should regularly ask patients about DS\nuse, and check for potential interactions. To better under-\nstand use among culturally diverse groups and those with\ndifferent clinical conditions, future studies should include\na broader range of DS (such as those used in folk reme-\ndies, foods and medicinal teas) and ask about common\nhealth conditions. Additional studies are needed to deter-\nmine the impact of DS use on health care use, health sta-\ntus and quality of life.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPG crafted the study design, participated in the statistical\nanalysis; interpreted the data; composed and revised the\ntext.
