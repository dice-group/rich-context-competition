However, given the complexity of body\nweight regulation, these inconsistent \u00aendings may be\ncaused by a host ofknownandunknown factors,ranging\nfrom genetic and metabolic factors to the behavioral\nfactors such as dieting in response to weight gain.14\nFurthermore, epidemiologic studies of diet and body\nweight are complicated by the dif\u00aeculty in measuring\ndietary intake of a free-living population, resulting in\nmeasurement errors in dietary data. These errors may be\ncaused, for example, by the under-reporting of intake by\nsome overweight individuals9 and by the daily variation\nin food intake of the same individual.15\nDespite these dif\u00aeculties, there are longitudinal stu-\ndies that have shown a positive relationship between\ndietary fat and body weight or change in body\nweight.8,12 For instance, animal fat intake was found\nto be positively associated with weight gain in a cohort\nof healthy women.8 These studies are consistent with the\nanimal experiments and clinical studies, and with the\necological studies of diet and body weight that used data\ncompiled from different populations, especially those of\nthe developing countries.16\nIn this study, we examined the relationship between\ndiet and body mass index (BMI), taking into account\nphysical activity, smoking habit and major socio-\neconomic factors. Data for analysis came from the \u00aerst\nand second China Health and Nutrition Survey con-\nsectional and the longitudinal analyses were performed.\nDietary data were obtained from the repeated measure-\nments of diet using consecutive 24 h dietary recalls.\nMaterials and methods\nSurvey design and survey data\nThe China Health and Nutrition Survey is an ongoing\nsurvey that collects a wide range of socio-economic,\nCorrespondence: Barry M.

The details of the survey design\nand survey data are given elsewhere.17 The represen-\ntative sample was drawn by multistage, random clus-\nter sampling from each province. The \u00aenal sample\nconsisted of 3780 households. These households have\nbeen followed every two years since 1989.\nAll eligible adults aged 20\u00b145 y were included in\nthis study. Of the 4675 adults with complete data in\nalso provided complete data in 1991. Earlier analysis\nsuggested that the non-participating households (for\nexample, those which could not be contacted) were\nrandom and did not represent a selective group. Our\nanalysis showed that the BMI, dietary intakes and\nmajor socio-economic factors of individuals who were\nlost to follow-up did not differ signi\u00aecantly from\nthose who remained in the study. For example, the\nmean BMI and fat intake at baseline of those who\nrespectively, of those who remained in the study\n(t-test, P b 0.1). All women who were pregnant or\nlactating at the time of either survey (n  292) were\nexcluded from analyses.\nDietary data\nDietary data were obtained from the 24 h dietary recall\ntaken daily for three consecutive days. Each subject\nwas asked to report all foods consumed during the\nprevious 24 h, in Chinese measurement units. Detailed\nquestioning was used when appropriate. More than\n95% of the subjects had completed all of the three\nrecalls. From these data, the intakes of energy, fat and\nother nutrients on each day were calculated using the\nof\u00aecial 1991 Chinese Food Composition Table.\nDietary data used in this paper represent the average\n(mean) of these replicate dietary recalls. Collection of\ndietary data was carried out by trained nutritionists,\nwith speci\u00aec training provided at the beginning of\neach survey.\nAnthropometric data\nAnthropometric measurements were carried out by\ntrained health workers. Body weight was measured\nin light indoor clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg with a\nbeam balance scale. Height was measured without\nshoes to the nearest 0.1 cm, using a portable stadi-\nometer. Speci\u00aec training on anthropometric assess-\nment was provided at the beginning of each survey.\nFrom weight and height data, the BMI (weight in\nkgaheight in m2) was calculated.\nPhysical activity data\nPhysical activity data were collected from the reported\nphysical activity level at occupation, ranging from 1\n(very sedentary) to 5 (very strenuous). These were\nlater classi\u00aeed into three categories (sedentary, mod-\nerate and strenuous). The data on leisure or sport\nactivity were not available. However, it was assumed\nthat the reported physical activity was an adequate\nproxy measure of energy expenditure in this sample of\nworking adults.\nOther biological data\nCollection of age data in China is dif\u00aecult because the\nWestern and the Chinese calendars are often used\ninterchangeably. In this survey, all dates of birth were\nplaced into the Western calendar, which may differ by\nmonths from the traditional Chinese\ndate.\nBasic data concerning smoking habits were avail-\nable from the 1989 survey, but more detailed data\nwere collected in the 1991 survey. These included the\npresent smoking habit, the age when smoking started\nor stopped, and the type and amount of tobacco used\nper day. Because the amount of tobacco consumption\nwas not reported in 1989, the subjects were classi\u00aeed\ninto two categories: smoker and non-smoker or ex-\nsmoker.\nPregnancy and lactation status in women was\nSocio-economic data\nData about income, occupation, education and place\nof residence were relevant to this analysis. Questions\nabout income were designed to cover all of the\nincome-generating activities, including the non-mone-\ntary government bene\u00aets such as food subsidies and\nration coupons. In addition, the possession of major\nhousehold assets (for example, major electrical appli-\nances, farming equipment and livestock) was\nrecorded.\nThe primary occupations were classi\u00aeed into three\ncategories: (1) Farmers, agricultural workers and\nunskilled workers; (2) Semi-skilled and skilled work-\ners and (3) Professional, administrative and manage-\nrial workers.\nThe education levels were classi\u00aeed into four\ncategories based on the year(s) of formal education\ncompleted: (1) None, (2) Primary school, (3) Middle\nschool and (4) Upper-middle, high school or college.\nPlace of residence was included in this analysis\nbecause signi\u00aecant differences in BMI and dietary\nintakes between urban and rural residents in China\nStatistical analysis\nPopulation characteristics at baseline (1989) were\nexamined in the descriptive analysis. Because both\nBMI and dietary intake tend to vary with age, analysis\nof covariance was used to compare the mean BMI and\ndietary intakes of the study sample strati\u00aeed by major\nDiet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults\nS Paeratakul et al\ncharacteristics, simultaneously controlling for possi-\nble difference in the age structures of groups that were\nbeing compared.\nThe changes in diet, physical activity and BMI\nstudy sample strati\u00aeed by gender and place of resi-\ndence. In addition, the changes in BMI of individuals\nwho reported an increase in fat intakes, individuals\nwho reported a decrease in physical activity and\nindividuals who reported both an increase in fat\nintake and a decrease in physical activity were com-\npared to their respective counterparts. This approach\nhas been used to evaluate the body fatness in people\nwho maintained contrasting lifestyles.20\nIn the subsequent multivariable analyses, the nutri-\nent partition method, whereby total dietary intake is\npartitioned into intake of energy from fat and intake of\nenergy from sources other than fat, was used to\nexamine the effect of fat intake on BMI taking into\naccount the effect of total energy intake.21 Unless\nwhere noted, these dietary intakes are referred to as\n`fat intake' and `energy intake' throughout this paper.\nBecause the sampling units in this survey were\nhouseholds rather than independently selected\nindividuals, the variance of BMI may be increased\nregardless of whether these households were ran-\ndomly or non-randomly selected.22 We have exam-\nined this so-called `cluster' effect and found it to be\nnegligible in this sample. This was probably due to the\nsmall household (cluster) size. The average household\nsize was 1.7 people.\nMultiple regression analysis was used to examine\nthe cross-sectional relationship between diet and BMI\nat baseline (1989) survey, controlling for other biolo-\ngical and socio-economic factors. Analysis was initi-\nally done using the total sample and then separately\nfor men and women.\nLongitudinal analysis of the diet-BMI relationship\nwas made by using the \u00aexed effects model that is\nsuitable for analysis of longitudinal time-series data.23\nThis statistical model focuses on the change in the\ndependent variable (BMI) in relation to the changes in\nexplanatory variables (such as diet and physical activ-\nity) over time. The effects of variables that do not vary\nover time (for example, gender) were tested by\nincluding these variables as interaction terms with\nall other variables in the model.\nAll analyses were done with Stata release 4.023 and\nResults\nTable 1 presents the population characteristics at\nbaseline and the age-adjusted mean BMI and dietary\nintakes of the study sample strati\u00aeed by major char-\nacteristics. As we have shown elsewhere,17,25 both the\nbody mass and the dietary intake varied considerably\nacross different population subgroups. In general,\nwomen, urban residents, persons who reported\nTable 1 Age-adjusted mean (s.e.m.) of body mass index (BMI) and dietary intake at baseline (1989), according to major population\ncharacteristics\nEnergy Carbohydrate Protein Fat\nn(%) BMI (Kcal/d) (% energy) (% energy) (% energy)\nGender\nResidence\nEducation\nOccupation\nIncome\nPhysical activity\nSmoking status\nMeans in the same column with same superscript are signi\u00aecantly different, P` 0.0001.\nDiet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults\nS Paeratakul et al\nsedentary physical activity and non-smokers, had\nhigher mean BMI than their respective counterparts.\nDietary intakes in the study population also varied\nacross the levels of biological and socio-economic\nfactors. For example, men, smokers, rural residents,\npersons who reported strenuous physical activity and\npersons with low income had higher total energy\nintake than their respective counterparts. In contrast,\nurban residence, high education level, high income\nand sedentary activity or occupation were associated\nwith high fat and protein intakes.\nThe changes in BMI, dietary intakes and physical\ngender and place of residence, are presented in Table\n2. There were increases in BMI that were similar\nacross the population subgroups. The total energy\nintake decreased in all subgroups, especially among\nmen and rural residents. However, the percentage of\ntotal energy intake as fat was increased, especially\namong the urban residents. A greater percentage of\nurban residents reported sedentary physical activity\nand a greater percentage of rural residents reported\nOn closer examination, 53% of the study population\nreported an increase in fat intake and 47% reported a\nmean change in BMI of those who increased their fat\nthose who decreased their fat intake.

Strenuous\nDiet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults\nS Paeratakul et al\nCross-sectional analysis of diet-BMI relationship at\nbaseline (Table 3) showed that diet, physical activity\nand several socio-economic factors were signi\u00aecantly\nassociated with body mass. Both fat and energy\nintakes were positively associated with BMI in the\ntotal sample and in men. In women, both dietary\nintakes were positively associated with BMI, but the\neffect of fat intake was not statistically signi\u00aecant. Of\nall other predictors of body mass examined, age,\nurban residence and possession of major household\nassets were positively related to BMI. Education level\nwas negatively related to BMI in women and marital\nstatus was positively related to BMI in men. Physical\nactivity was inversely associated with BMI in the total\nsample and in both genders.\nIn the longitudinal analysis, the multiple regression\nmodels of diet and BMI showed that both fat and energy\nintakes at baseline (1989) were positively associated\nwith attained BMI in 1991, while physical activity at\nbaseline was negatively associated with attained BMI.\nSimilarly, dietary intakes and physical activity at base-\nline were associated with the change in BMI during the\ndietary intakes at baseline and the subsequent change\nin BMI were not statistically signi\u00aecant.\nIn the longitudinal analysis using the \u00aexed effects\nmodel, change in fat intake was positively associated\nwith the change in BMI for the total sample (Table 4).\nChange in physical activity level was negatively\nassociated with a change in BMI, that is, an increase\n(decrease) in physical activity was associated with a\ndecrease (increase) in BMI. Increasing age was asso-\nciated with an increase in BMI. The fat intake-gender\ninteraction term indicated that the fat intake-BMI\nrelationship was not signi\u00aecant in women. Changes\nin smoking habit and all of the socio-economic vari-\nables examined were not related to a change in BMI.\nGender-speci\u00aec analyses showed that change in fat\nintake was positively and signi\u00aecantly related to\nchange in BMI in men only, while the change in\nphysical activity was negatively and signi\u00aecantly\nrelated to a change in BMI in women only. In men,\nan increase in fat intake of 100 Kcal was associated\nan increase in physical activity by one level was\nassociated with a decrease in BMI of 0.12 kgam2.\nFor both genders, an average increase in age of\nabout 2 y was associated with an increase in BMI of\nabout 0.11 kgam2. The effect of age on BMI was\nslightly greater in men than in women.\nDiscussion\nEpidemiological evidence of the relationship between\ndietary fat and body weight is suggestive but not\nde\u00aenitive.14 In general, cross-sectional studies provide\nconsistent evidence of the positive relationship\nbetween dietary fat and body weight. However,\nlongitudinal studies have shown inconsistent results.\nThe reasons for this inconsistency are not clear, but it\nis likely that several factors are involved. These\ninclude genetic and metabolic factors, physical activ-\nity, smoking habit and behavioral factors such as\ndieting in response to weight gain.\nTable 3 Cross-sectional analysis at baseline (1989 survey). Dependent variable: body mass\nindex (BMI)\nVariable Coefficient Standard error t P\nDiet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults\nS Paeratakul et al\nCross-sectional study cannot distinguish a temporal\nsequence between diet and obesity and merely estab-\nlishes a non-directional relationship.14 In contrast, the\nprospective study is generally considered to be a\nstrong epidemiological design for observational stu-\ndies, providing an opportunity to examine the changes\nin variables of interest. However, this type of study\nmay not be able to capture the effects of important\nfactors that do not change much over time. Clearly,\nconclusions must be drawn by combining the results\nfrom descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal ana-\nlyses rather than considering the results from each\nanalysis individually.\nDiet is undoubtedly one of the most important\ndeterminants of body weight. In the population,\nhowever, body weight is also in\u00afuenced by several\nnon-dietary factors such as physical activity, smoking\nand socio-economic factors. While physical activity\nand smoking are recognized as important determi-\nnants of body weight, the signi\u00aecance of socio-\neconomic factors should not be overlooked. For\nexample, it has been shown that the prevalence of\nobesity in the population varies across levels of\nincome and education,26,27 and across categories of\noccupation.10 Socio-economic factors also have strong\nin\u00afuence on the diet. In developing countries, income\nis positively correlated with intakes of fat and animal\nproducts, and negatively correlated with carbohydrate\nintake.16,18 In many situations, therefore, socio-\neconomic factors may be important confounders or\neffect modi\u00aeers of the relationship between diet and\nbody weight.\nEpidemiological study of the diet-BMI relationship\nis further complicated by the dif\u00aeculty in obtaining\naccurate dietary data from a free-living population.\nThe commonly used dietary assessment methods are\nsubject to measurement errors, especially the error\ncaused by day-to-day \u00afuctuation in dietary intake\nabove and below an individual's true long-term\nintake, that is, the within-person error.15 Generally,\nthe effect of such an error is to weaken any evidence\nof diet-disease association. We have examined this\nissue in detail in another study. In brief, we have\nfound that within-person error substantially attenuated\nthe diet-BMI association, and that one way to reduce\nsuch attenuation was to use the average of replicate\nmeasurements of diet. For example, the regression\ncoef\u00aecient of fat intake increased by two-fold and that\nof energy intake increased by about 40% when the\naverage of three dietary recalls was used instead of a\nsingle recall.\nResults from our descriptive analysis are consistent\nwith the current literature pertaining to diet and body\nweight in developing countries. The analysis of change\nin BMI in relation to diet, suggested that increase in fat\nintake, especially in conjunction with decrease in\nphysical activity, was positively related to weight\ngain. First, results from cross-sectional and longitudinal\nanalyses indicated that dietary fat was positively asso-\nciated with BMI or change in BMI among men in the\nstudy sample. It must be pointed out that our sample\nconsisted mostly (about 70%) of rural residents with\nphysically demanding occupations and high levels of\nphysical activity. This may partly explain the small\neffect of diet on BMI in multivariable analyses. Also,\nthe weak association between fat intake and BMI in\nlongitudinal analysis may be caused by the fact that,\namong these rural residents, there was very little change\nin fat intake, but a large increase in physical activity\nSecond, there was a strong inverse relationship\nbetween physical activity and BMI in cross-sectional\nanalysis and among the women in the longitudinal\nanalysis. The reason for a weak inverse relationship\nbetween physical activity and BMI among men in\nlongitudinal analysis, is not clear. The most likely\nexplanation is the incomplete physical activity data.\nMoreover, although a larger percentage of men\nreported higher physical activity than women at both\nsurveys, there was a relatively smaller change in\nphysical activity among men between the two time\nperiods.\nTable 4 Longitudinal analysis. Dependent variable: Change in BMI\nVariable Coefficient Standard error t P\nDiet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults\nS Paeratakul et al\nThird, resultsfrom descriptive analysis suggested that\nthe total energy intake is strongly in\u00afuenced by the\nenergy expenditure. Individuals with physically\ndemanding occupations and those who reported high\nphysical activity, who together constituted more than\nhalf the study sample, reported higher total energy\nintake compared to theirrespective counterparts. Carbo-\nhydrate supplied most (about 70%) of their total\nenergy intake. On the other hand, fat and protein\nintakes appear to be in\u00afuenced by socio-economic\nfactors such as residence, education and income.\nThese \u00aendings are in general agreement with the\ncurrent literature of diet, socio-economic status, and\nbody weight in developing countries.16,27\nFourth, socio-economic factors such as place of\nresidence, education, occupation and income may\nhave important in\u00afuence on BMI in this population.\nResults from descriptive and cross-sectional analyses\nsupport this conclusion, and they are in agreement\nwith other studies.27 High income and education\nlevels, for example, were associated with high fat\nintake and BMI. This observation is in direct contrast\nto that seen in the industrialized countries, and such\ninter-population or inter-cultural differences have\nbeen well documented.27 None of the socio-economic\nfactors examined, however, was related to change in\nBMI in the longitudinal analysis. Again, there was\nvery little change in these factors between the two\nsurveys. The changes in education and occupation, for\nperiod.\nFinally, the descriptive analysis showed that smo-\nkers had lower BMI and higher total energy intake\nthan non-smokers and ex-smokers. Other studies have\nreported similar results.10,28 Most studies have\nreported an inverse relationship between smoking\nand body weight. However, we have not found such\na relationship in the multivariable analyses. The most\nlikely explanation is the limited data on tobacco\nconsumption.\nDietary fat was emphasized in this study for two\nreasons. First, there has been an increasing trend in fat\nconsumption in China during the past decade.16,29\nThis trend may be attributed to the rapid economic\ndevelopment and consequently, the abandonment of\nlow-fat traditional diets in favor of high-fat `af\u00afuent'\ndiets.16 Although fat intake in this study population is\nstill below the upper interim limit of 30% of total\nenergy intake set by the World Health Organization,\nthere is evidence to suggest that fat intake in China is\nincreasing steadily toward this level.\nSecond, the Chinese population, particularly those\nliving in the urban areas, may represent a large\nnumber of individuals who are susceptible to the\nfattening effect of a high-fat diet. Such an effect is\nthought to be due to the spontaneous increase in\nenergy intake and hyperphagia associated with high-\nfat foods.4 It is believed that when exposed to a high-\nfat diet, the body fat mass must rapidly expand in\norder to increase the oxidation of dietary fat, until fat\noxidation becomes commensurate with the fat content\nof the diet and until the body reaches a new plateau of\nweight maintenance.1 If this observation is indeed\napplicable to the general population, then it may be\nspeculated that the Chinese population, with relatively\nlow BMI, may be at risk of the dynamic phase of\nobesity when exposed to a high-fat diet as opposed to\nthe static phase of obesity normally observed in\nWestern populations.14\nAlthough the susceptibility of this population\nto the effect of a high-fat diet is not known, the\nproblem is still complicated by the fact that in\nChina and in many developing countries, obesity is\noften associated with good health and high social\nstatus.27 Therefore, healthy individuals who are\nexperiencing rapid weight gain may not perceive the\ncondition as hazardous to their health, and the over-\nweight individuals may be indifferent to further\nweight gain. In this respect, we believe that dieting\nandaor a deliberate increase in physical activity in\nresponse to weight gain, is uncommon in this study\npopulation. The same applies to the under-reporting of\ndietary intakes by overweight individuals in this\nsample.\nTo date, the study of diet and body weight in\ndeveloping countries is very limited. The World\nHealth Organization has provided an excellent\nreview of the changing diet and disease patterns in\ndeveloping countries.16 It is now recognized that diet-\nrelated chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular\ndisease, are of signi\u00aecant importance in virtually all\ncountries, developing and developed alike. Thus, in\naddition to the immediate problems of malnutrition\nand undernutrition, the problems caused by over-\nnutrition and nutrient imbalance in developing coun-\ntries are of serious concern. According to the current\ntrend, these diseases will constitute a major threat to\nthe economically productive adults and subsequently,\nwill present a huge health-care burden on these\ncountries in the near future.16\n"
