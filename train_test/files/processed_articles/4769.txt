    "abstract": "Abstract. When one monocular image contains a red square partly occluding a green square,\nand the other monocular image is the same except that the green square is partly occluding the\nred one, the two images resemble each other's amodal completion. Observers typically perceive\ntwo complete squares as if the red and green surfaces are transparent or penetrating each other\nat their overlapping image location, which never appears yellow. With this example, we introduce\ndichoptic completion as a perception with the following characteristics. (1) Similar to binocular\nrivalry, it is evoked by dichoptic stimuli with monocular images so disparate that they cannot arise\nfrom physical scenes; however, (2) it occurs when objects inferred from one monocular image\nare identified with, or do not conflict with, objects inferred from the other; and, consequently, (3)\nit is a form of perceptual superposition, distinct from the result of binocular summation or rivalry.\n",

One has been men-\ntioned in the abstract (Figure 1 and Figure 2a). Another involves retinal images corresponding\nto the two standard alternative interpretations of a Necker cube, so that one monocular\nimage has three differently coloured surfaces of this cube from one interpretation and the\nother image has three other differently coloured surfaces from the other interpretation\n(Figure 3a). The dominant resulting percept is of a transparent cube containing six multi-\ncoloured surfaces, even though binocular rivalry would conventionally occur. We call these\ntwo test stimuli SQUARES and CUBES, respectively. To quantify the prevalence of dichoptic\ncompletion by these stimuli, we measured the fractions of viewing durations for various\nperceptual categories, and contrasted them with those evoked by control stimuli (Figure 2b\nand Figure 3b).\nEach monocular image contains a 3\u00b0\u00d73\u00b0 relevant region centred in a 4\u00b0\u00d74\u00b0gray (56.3\ncd/m2) square framed by a black border (2 arcmin wide). Various image patches included\ncd/m2), black (0.0 cd/m2), and white (110.0 cd/m2) areas. All dichoptic stimuli were viewed\nafter observers fused on the binocular fixation stimulus (white `+' with bar size 4'\u00d720' on a\nblack circle, diameter 20 arcmin, Figure 1) centred within the same square.\nHuman observers (4 male and 2 female, 23-28 years) first freely viewed each dichoptic\nstimulus for a few minutes to report all their perceptions, which were classified by the exper-\nimenter into three categories according to their degrees of binocular rivalry or combination,\nsee Figures 2 and 3. Then they viewed the stimulus continuously for 5 minutes in a trial, and\npressed one of the three response buttons whenever their perception started to appear like\nthe corresponding perceptual category. After some rest, they did another trial with the two\nmonocular images swapped with each other. Observers were asked after testing if they saw\nany uncategorized perceptions (none did). Fraction of accumulated time duration seeing\neach of the three perceptions within the 10-minute viewing duration was calculated.\nFigure 1. A schematic of the apparatus and stimuli. Mirrors brought the dichoptic images on a cathode\nray tube (CRT) monitor to the two eyes.\nContrary to the expectation that binocular rivalry (including patchwork rivalry) dominates\nperception when two very disparate monocular images are viewed (Blake 2001; Kovacs et al\n1996), in our test stimuli, dichoptic completion tends to be the dominant perception. This is\ninsensitive to the choices of surface colours, according to our observation. Moreover, disparity\nbetween the red and green squares in SQUARES has a limited effect on the prevalence of\ndichoptic completion (Meng and Zhaoping 2011).\nNon-rivalry between two very different monocular images in our examples can also be\nevoked by stimuli from physical scenes. For example, view an apple about 60 cm from you;\nhold a finger between the apple and yourself, and adjust its position such that roughly only\nthe left/right half of the apple is projected into your left/right eye. The apple is perceived as\nwhole, because its image in the left eye is the amodal completed portion of that in the right\neye, making the apples inferred from the left and right images identified with each other. This\nidentification of, or non-conflict between, objects inferred from the two monocular images\nis the same as an essential requirement for dichoptic completion. We believe that the brain\nmechanism for inferring this whole apple is what makes dichoptic completion possible, even\nthough we never experienced such stimuli (eg, Figure 2a and Figure 3a) in physical scenes.\nIn SQUARES, object identification occurs because each monocular image contains the\namodal completed portion of the other one. In CUBES, the two images are no longer amodal\ncompleted versions of each other. Dichoptic completion thus involves object completion\nmore general than amodal completion, when the unspecified but consistent details of the\ninferred objects from one image appear in the other image.\nMany questions remain to be answered. For example, one may ask whether and how\ndichoptic completion can be affected by attentional control, experience, knowledge, or by\nspatial, temporal, chromatic, and achromatic intensities of the stimuli. Complementary to\nFigure 2. Stimuli and results for test stimulus SQUARES (a) and its control stimulus (b). Two 2\u00b0\u00d72\u00b0\nsquares overlap by 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0. For (a), the three possible perceptual categories are rivalry (a monocular\nimage), completion I (two complete squares penetrating each other), and completion II (two complete\nsquares overlapping transparently). For red/green image area in (b), the categories are rivalry (a\nmonocular image), patchwork rivalry (red-green patches), and other (perceiving yellow or dark\npink). (c) Averaged fractions of accumulated durations across observers for five possible perceptual\ncategories, error bars indicate standard deviations. For each category, a blue star indicates a significant\ndifference (matched-sample t-test, p<.05) between the fraction for the test and that for the control\nstimulus.\nFigure 3. Stimuli and results for test stimulus CUBES (a) and its control stimulus (b), in the same\nformat as in Figure 2 above. The squares are 2\u00b0\u00d72\u00b0 in size, and the rhomboids are 1\u00b0 thick. For (a),\nthe three possible perceptual categories are rivalry (a monocular image), mix (seeing two protruding\ncubes, each with three faces), and completion (seeing a transparent cube with six faces). For (b), the\ncategories are rivalry (a monocular image), patchwork rivalry (one plane with 3\u00ad4 patches), and mix\n(seeing two parallel surfaces in depth). The `mix' perceptions are not categorized as `completion'\nbecause two, rather than one, objects were seen.\nbinocular rivalry, dichoptic completion can be a useful probe into brain mechanisms for\nperceptual inference, which constructs the most likely scene from the monocular images,\nregardless of whether these images could actually arise from the perceived scene.\n"
