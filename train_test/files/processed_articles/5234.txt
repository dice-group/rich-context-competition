Wilson1, Yvonne Barnes-Holmes2,\nand Dermot Barnes-Holmes2\n Keywords\nrelaxation, relaxation induced anxiety, acceptance and commitment therapy, ACT\nStructured relaxation techniques have been a standard\ncomponent in therapy since they were first popularized by\nJacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) almost a\nplethora of methods have evolved, and are subsumed under\nthe label of relaxation (Poppen, 1998). Although the\nprimary behavior that the practitioner engages in can often\nvary significantly from one technique to another, and bear\nlittle resemblance to Jacobson's original technique,\nrelaxation training (RT) is used to treat a wide range of\nsymptoms and disorders (Smith, 1996). It is even\nrecommended as a general adjunct to therapy to improve\nclients' affect and general receptivity to treatment\nSuperficial differences across techniques may be\nexplained by the assertion that the state of relaxation (and\nits antithesis, anxiety) depends on the interaction between\npsychological and physiological processes, such that\ndifferent techniques focus primarily on one over the other.\nFor example, a practitioner may engage in a physical action\n(e.g., by slowing breathing) which will, in turn, affect the\nautonomic nervous system (ANS), and subsequently the\nindividual's cognitive processes, leading to a relaxed state.\nConversely, the individual may focus attention on\ndisrupting thought patterns that cause worry or anxiety,\nwhich then leads to a reduction in physiological arousal.\nWhen and Why Relaxation Doesn't Work\nA number of authors have noted that not all clients benefit\nfrom relaxation and these negative outcomes suggest that\nthe processes of relaxation, and particularly their\nrelationship with anxiety, are not fully understood. For\nexample, cases of relaxation induced anxiety (RIA; Heide\n& Borkovec, 1984) and relaxation induced panic (RIP;\nAdler, Craske, & Barlow, 1987) have been reported in the\nliterature. In response, Lazarus and Mayne (1990) argued\nthat RIA can be avoided by closely matching the relaxation\ntechnique to the type of anxiety experienced or even to the\npersonality of the client. Alternatively, Heide and Borkovec\n(1984) argued that the nature and extent of an individual's\nevaluations of the relaxation technique influences the\noutcome, because the individual is attending to intrusive\nprivate events. Indeed, there is some evidence that\nindividuals perceive relaxation exercises as an effort to\nmodify or remove negative or anxiety-related private\nevents, in a type of experiential avoidance (Wegner,\nSmith (1996) believed that unsuccessful attempts to\nrelax may relate to a lack of understanding of the central but\ndifficult concept of passivity. Passivity toward private\nevents is considered to be a fundamental component of\neffective relaxation (Beary, Benson, & Klemchuk, 1974).\nPassivity is described as a level of functional detachment\nfrom the outcome of the technique, where attention toward\n1Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK\n2National University of Ireland Maynooth, Ireland\nCorresponding Author:\nChristopher J.

In addition, the core philosophy of these approaches\nhave much in common with the concept of passivity in\nrelaxation. Mindfulness involves focusing attention on the\npresent moment making contact with these experiences\nwithout judgment or evaluation (Kabat-Zinn, 2003).\nAcceptance may be conceptualized in simple terms as the\nantithesis of experiential avoidance in that acceptance\nmeans being able to remain in contact with private events,\nrather than trying to reduce their occurrence (Barnes-\nHolmes, Cochrane, Barnes-Holmes, Stewart, & McHugh,\n2004). Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes,\nStrosahl, & Wilson, 1999), which has its theoretical basis in\nthe relational frame theory (RFT; Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, &\nRoche, 2001) account of language and cognition,\nincorporates ideas such as acceptance, mindfulness, and\ncognitive defusion, and utilizes behavioral change strategies\nto allow clients to identify and move toward their own\npersonal values.\nThis article focuses on role of passivity in relaxation.\nSpecifically, we argue that current definitions of passivity\nare ambiguous and purely descriptive--describing a state of\n\"awareness without attention\" without discussing how to\nachieve such a state. ACT incorporates a number of\ntechniques designed to address the language processes that\nmediate experiential avoidance, which could help address\nthis problem. Furthermore, the term passivity is often used\nto refer to distinctly different parts of the relaxation process:\nthe goal of the relaxation exercise, attention during\nrelaxation, and the evaluation of private events during\nrelaxation. We outline functional similarities between these\nelements of relaxation and certain core concepts in ACT.\nFinally, we suggest that if negative outcomes associated\nwith relaxation are due to unintentional experiential\navoidance, then re-framing relaxation in ACT terms and\nutilizing linguistic techniques common to ACT might\nincrease the success of relaxation techniques in a clinical\nsetting.\nCurrent Usage\nRT has been used for the treatment of hundreds of\ndisorders, including general stress symptoms (Rausch,\nGramling, & Auerbach, 2006) or anxiety that is co-morbid\nwith other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder\n(OCD; Twohig et al., 2010) or schizophrenia (Chen et al.,\n2009). RT is most commonly used as part of a therapeutic\npackage, in combination with a main therapeutic approach\nsuch as cognitive behavioral therapy (Lehrer, Woolfolk, &\nSime, 2007). Outcome studies generally support the\nefficacy of relaxation in the various domains where it has\nbeen applied. However, while PMR is the most popular\ntechnique in clinical settings, the myriad of existing RT\ntechniques and the areas they are applied need to be taken\ninto account when considering generalized statements\nrelating to efficacy.\nIndeed, Poppen (1998) criticized the \"cookbook\" fashion\nin which RTs are slotted into existing therapeutic regimes, a\npractice that he felt is born out of viewing relaxation as a\nstraightforward outcome that can be achieved by applying\nwhichever RT is most convenient. A number of authors\nhave noted that more consideration should be given to the\nspecific effects of RT on different symptoms (e.g., Lazarus\nAnother issue with integrating RT with other forms of\ntherapy is the potential interaction between the wider\ntherapeutic approach and the process of relaxation itself. As\nwe outline the relaxation process, the importance of how\nthe RT practitioners interpret and interact with their own\nthoughts and other private events will become apparent. So\ntoo will the role of the wider therapeutic philosophy in\neither facilitating an approach to private events that is either\nconducive or detrimental to the relaxation process.\nRelaxation\nThe term relaxation can be ambiguous, in that it is often used\ninterchangeably to refer to three distinct ideas: the state of\nbeing relaxed, the physiological and psychological process of\nbecoming relaxed, and the technique or exercise used to\npromote or achieve relaxation. To avoid confusion, we will\ndifferentiate by referring to the state of being relaxed, the\nrelaxation process, and relaxation techniques respectively,\nwith the term relaxation referring to the overall concept.\nBeing relaxed could be described as a state of\nequilibrium that is free from both physical and\npsychological tension, which ultimately culminates in the\nsubjective experience of \"being relaxed.\" The relaxed state\nis subjective in that it differs from one person to another: In\nthe same way that stress relates to perceived demands and\nthe individual's perceived inability to meet those demands,\nrelaxation is not necessarily an absence of all potential\nstressors, rather a sense that they are not overwhelming.\nThis sense of well-being is also dependent on the absence\nof sympathetic physiological activity, signaled by low heart\nrate, slowed breathing, and reduced muscle tension.\nSomatic Responding\nThe objective indicators of relaxation are muscular tension\nand activity of the ANS. When a person is relaxed, they\ngenerally have low levels of tension in the skeletal muscular\nsystem and reduced sympathetic activity in the ANS,\ncharacterized by lower oxygen consumption, slower heart,\nand lower blood pressure (Benson, 1975).\nThe list of techniques that come under the label of\nrelaxation is not exhaustive. However, exercises that are\ncommon to most relaxation techniques attempt to directly\nWilson et al. 3\nengage one or both of the muscular or autonomic systems.\nPMR involves extensive training to discriminate between\ndifferent levels of muscular tension and has seen a number\nof iterations and abbreviated versions since its inception\n(Bernstein, Carlson, & Schmidt, 2007). The autonomic\ncomponent of relaxation is accessed through various\ntechniques, which aim to reduce sympathetic arousal and\npromote a state of \"parasympathetic inhibition\" (Beary et\nal., 1974). Breathing exercises, for example, aim to regulate\nand lower rate of breathing resulting in slower heart rate\nand lower blood pressure (McCaul, Solomon, & Holmes,\n1979). Biofeedback allows the practitioners to regulate their\nown autonomic activity by giving a continuous visual or\naural feedback indicating increases or decreases in arousal\n(Tarler-Benlolo, 1978). Even in techniques that might\nemphasize one type of responding, there is an awareness of\nthe holistic nature of the process. For example, while never\ndirectly addressed in the exercise, Jacobson noted that PMR\nresulted in physiological arousal (Lichstein, 1988). While\nBenson (1975) emphasized mantra and breathing exercises,\nhe noted the role of muscular tension by emphasizing the\nimportance of comfortable posture.\nCognition\nWhat makes the relaxation process the focus of continued\nfascination and study is that somatic responses are only part\nof the equation. Relaxation also involves a cognitive\ncomponent, where previous experience, expectations, and\ncurrent physical and emotional state all enter awareness and\nare evaluated while engaging in a technique. By its nature,\nrelaxation involves increased self-focus, where attention is\ndirected toward (or away from) thoughts and other private\nevents that occur while trying to relax (Bond et al., 2009).\nIn addition, there is a level of meta-responding, where the\npresence or absence of these events is evaluated to measure\nthe overall success of the exercise (Hayes, Hirsch, &\ntechniques such as mantra (repetition of a single word or\nphrase) attempt to limit the amount of self-talk during\nrelaxation by focusing attention on a single word or phrase,\nall of the major models of relaxation acknowledge the fact\nthat errand thoughts will occur.\nThe predominant view is that a position of passivity\nshould be adopted toward such intrusions (Lichstein, 1988).\nIn general, passivity is described as a neutral, disinterested\nposition toward thoughts that enter awareness. However,\nthe concept has been used in a number of ways, to describe\na practitioner's intention (how they define being relaxed),\nattention (how they attend to private events during the\nrelaxation process), and evaluation (how they interpret\nthese events). In each case, the term passivity has slightly\ndifferent connotations.\nIntention. Passivity has been used to describe the view a\npractitioner should adopt toward the overall goal of the\nrelaxation technique. Benson (Beary et al., 1974; Benson,\n1975) suggested that practitioners should begin relaxation\ntechniques with a \"passive attitude\" and not focus directly\non the outcome of the technique. He described passivity as\nnot worrying about how well the technique is being\nperformed. Jacobson (1951) warned against over-\nemphasizing the outcome of PMR in case it led\npractitioners to check how well they were following it,\nbelieving that this would disrupt progress. Davidson and\nSchwartz (1976) describe a detached attitude toward the\nfunctional outcome of the technique being engaged in.\nEvaluation. Passivity is also advocated in terms of how an\nindividual interprets private events. Thoughts or sensations\nthat occur during relaxation can be viewed as aversive (to\nbe avoided or removed) or benign (to be tolerated). This\nevaluation can have a direct affect on physiological activity.\nFor example, Ray et al. (2009) found that the strength of\nphysiological responses to a novel stimulus were\ndetermined more by whether or not the participant\nevaluated the stimulus as negative beforehand, than their\narousal level prior to stimulus presentation. It is, therefore,\nimportant that unintended private events are considered to\nbe part of the relaxation experience, as opposed to\nunwanted intrusions.\nAttention. Attention relates to the manner in which a\npractitioner observes psychological and physiological\nevents that occur while engaging in a relaxation exercise. It\nis commonly described along two dimensions: direction\n(self- or externally-focused) and activity (active or passive;\nThe direction of attention in relaxation is considered to\nbe self-focused, in that focus is directed toward\nphysiological or psychological activity. Practitioners are\ninstructed to attend to their rate of breathing as they slow\ntheir breath, their level of muscle tension as they learn to\nrelax certain muscles, or their thoughts as they engage in\nmeditation.\nHowever, not all events should be attended to in the same\nway. Davidson and Schwartz (1976) distinguish between\npassive and active attention, where active is effortful and\npassive is not. Active attention should be directed toward the\ncurrent activity (e.g., breathing exercises), while all other\nprivate events (e.g., thoughts or physical sensations) should\nonly be passively attended to. Similarly, Benson (1975)\ninstructed practitioners to disregard any thoughts that occur\nwhile engaging in the relaxation exercise and redirect\nattention toward the technique.\nParadoxical Effects\nAs well-documented as the process of relaxation has\nbecome, the fact remains that attempts to relax are not\nalways effective. Indeed, there continue to be documented\ncases of RIP and RIA, where attempts to relax actually lead\n4 SAGE Open\nto a state of increased arousal or anxiety. Individuals who\nexperience this phenomenon are unable to become\nproficient at relaxation and can become upset by their\nheightened awareness of the changing internal states\nassociated with relaxation (Lazarus & Mayne, 1990).\nLazarus and Mayne (1990) suggested that RIA and RIP\ntype outcomes could be avoided if the chosen technique\nwas appropriate to the symptoms being alleviated.\nHowever, other explanations for the cause of the\nparadoxical effects phenomenon and the wide variety of\ntechniques that have elicited these effects suggest\ncommonalities across sufferers and the importance of the\npassivity concept. Heide and Borkovec (1984) outlined\nwhat they considered to be some of the features of RIA: (a)\naversion to (ostensibly positive) private events that occur as\na result of relaxation, (b) attempting to achieve relaxation\nthrough effort to control experiences, (c) focusing attention\non anxious thoughts that enter awareness, (d) unwillingness\nto generally attend to internal events, and (e) worrisome\ncognitive activity unrelated to relaxation.\nThe points outlined by Heide and Borkovec (1984)\nsuggest that RIA is likely to occur when an individual\nattempts to avoid or control private events that occur during\nrelaxation. Of particular note is the first point, which\nemphasizes the subjective nature of this phenomenon. That\nis, physiological or psychological changes that occur during\nrelaxation, some of which are actually associated with\nachieving a relaxed state, are all evaluated by the individual\nas aversive. As such, they attempt to achieve relaxation by\ngaining control over such experiences.\nWegner et al. (1997) explained how these attempts to\ngain control could lead to increased arousal. He suggests\nthat once control is sought, the individual begins to monitor\nfor any intrusive thoughts, to suppress or remove them. It is\nsuggested that this disrupts the relaxation process in two\nways. First, instead of passively attending to private events,\nthe practitioner is now actively and continuously\nmonitoring for their presence, so that they can be\nsuppressed. This itself can increase arousal (Jacobson,\n1931). Second, attempts to suppress have been shown to\ndisrupt physiological habituation to events. In a sense, each\nnew anxious thought is treated as a novel stimulus, whose\npresence was never allowed and therefore never habituated\nto, so that the strength of the somatic response does not\nrole of passivity then is to adopt a position toward private\nevents that allows them to occur, facilitating habituation\nand leading diminished physiological and emotional\nresponses to new events over time.\nProblems With Passivity\nRIA and RIP might be considered as extreme examples of\nwhat can take place during relaxation. It could be argued\nthat where they occur, the process of relaxation has been\nmisinterpreted: as an exercise in effortful control, rather\nthan passive habituation. However, there is evidence to\nsuggest that relaxation is indeed interpreted in this manner.\nFor example, Wegner et al. (1997) demonstrated that the\ninstruction \"to relax\" resulted in larger increases in\nphysiological arousal, when engaged in a stress-inducing\ntask, compared with those who were not so instructed. They\nargue that relaxation is open to interpretation as an exercise\nin suppression or avoidance, and in fact, it is commonly\nviewed this way. The authors suggest that increased\ncognitive load at the time might constitute the difference\nbetween there being no paradoxical effects and the type of\nincreased arousal associated with RIA and RIP.\nIt is important therefore that passivity is communicated\nas an integral part of relaxation. Given that relaxation is a\nvery verbal process, involving constant reflection on\nphysical and psychological events, the language used to\narticulate an idea such as passivity becomes especially\nrelevant. Depending on how passivity is described, it is\npossible that the instruction to \"be passive\" could be\nmisinterpreted in the same way that the instruction \"to\nrelax\" often is. Here, we outline the potential difficulties\nthat could arise when attempting to communicate the role of\npassivity in relaxation. We suggest that if the goal of\nrelaxation is to facilitate habituation to private events, then\nthere are a number of key points that need to be understood.\nIntention: Identifying the Goal\nTo the practitioner, the main goal of relaxation is to \"not\nfeel anxious.\" As such, directly addressing this anxiety\nseems like the obvious first step in achieving this aim.\nWhen advocating passivity, we are asking the practitioner\nnot to do this. Instead, we are suggesting that they attend to\nall private events that occur and experience them fully\nwithout attempting to avoid, modify, or control them.\nPreviously for the practitioner, relaxation was the absence\nof these feelings. Now, a new indicator is needed to\nrationalize an experiential as opposed to avoidant approach.\nIn other words, \"Why should I allow myself to experience\nall of the thoughts and sensations that I associate with\nanxiety--the very state I do not want to be in?\"\nSmith (1996) acknowledged the difficulty of advocating\npassivity for its own sake. He suggested that the practitioner\nshould learn to adopt \"a personal philosophy of passivity\"\nin their daily lives, where the locus of control is outside of\nthe relaxation exercise. The goal for relaxation cannot be\nthe removal of thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations,\nas this is the same control-oriented approach that lead to the\naforementioned paradoxical effects. Instead, a larger\nexternal goal must be identified, such as the actions in life\nthat the anxiety was heretofore preventing. With this\nexternal task set as the \"real\" goal of relaxation,\nfluctuations in somatic arousal or the presence of unwanted\nthoughts that occur during relaxation no longer need to\nconstitute a failure to relax, so long as there is movement\ntoward the external goal.\nWilson et al. 5\nEvaluation: Severing the Link Between Internal Events\nand Anxiety\nA fearful reaction toward bodily sensations or other private\nevents that have been previously associated with panic or\nanxiety is a well-known mediator of the anxiety process\n(Smits, Powers, Cho, & Telch, 2004). In an attempt to\ndetermine the mechanism of change in cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT) treatments of panic disorder, Smits et al.\n(2004) found that a reduction in fear of fear (FOF)\naccounted for the largest variance in symptom reduction.\nIt is difficult for practitioners to adopt a passive view of\nsuch private events, when they are so inextricably tied to\nthe aversive experience. Simply advocating passivity does\nnothing to sever this link. It is important to take steps to\nactively disrupt this link, so that private events may be\nviewed as benign and not as signals of an impending\nunwanted experience.\nAttention: Clarifying What Is Active and What Is\nPassive\nIt is difficult to describe passivity in a manner that\narticulates the correct balance between activity and\ninactivity. On the one hand, it is possible that passivity\ncould be interpreted simply as a lack of activity, in that the\naim is to observe and not react to thoughts. However, it\nwould be incorrect to say that passivity is the same as doing\nnothing, as clearly it is a specific type of response to\nobserved private events. Ironically, it is also possible that\npassivity could be interpreted as an activity. Phrases such as\n\"clearing the mind,\" \"letting go,\" or \"observing\" are all\nused to communicate this process in relaxation exercises. It\nis worth noting that linguistically, all of these terms imply\ntwo things: (a) some type of activity is necessary and (b)\nthat activity involves directly addressing private events.\nIn fact, what we are trying to communicate with these\nphrases is an ongoing willingness to experience unpleasant\nprivate events, described by Smith (1999) as receptivity. If,\nas we said previously, private events must be allowed to\noccur to habituate them, then there must be a willingness to\nallow them to occur. Maintaining this willingness is the\nactive element in relaxation.\nAcceptance\nThere are a number of functional similarities between the\npassivity component of relaxation and psychological\nacceptance. Acceptance emphasizes being able to remain in\ncontact with private events, rather than trying to reduce\ntheir occurrence (Barnes-Holmes et al., 2004). ACT (Hayes\net al., 1999) incorporates acceptance and mindfulness as\nwell as focusing on valued action. From an ACT\nperspective, the paradoxical effects of effortful relaxation\nare not unexpected, given the ACT position that attempts to\nalter the form of frequency of internal events can lead to\npsychological problems (Kashdan, Barrios, Forsyth, &\nACT also comprises a number of techniques, which are\ndesigned to show the futility of experiential avoidance and\nfacilitate acceptance. In this section, we will outline the\ncomponents of ACT that are comparable to the various\nstages of relaxation outlined previously.\nIntention: Valued Action as the Goal\nPersonal values can be described as desirable, trans-\nsituational concepts or beliefs concerning life goals (Biber,\nHupfeld, & Meier, 2008). Essentially, what people consider\nimportant. Valued actions are those steps taken by an\nindividual towards their personal values. The concept of\nvalues is not strictly limited to ACT; however, the ACT\napproach has been commended for the fact that it addresses\nvalues so explicitly and directly (Arch & Craske, 2008).\nBarrow and Prosen (1981) identified the importance of\nvalues clarification in relaxation as part of their model for\nstress and counseling interventions, a multi-point model of\nthe stress process. Within this model, the authors outline the\ninteraction between internal and external demands that\ntakes place when first situational variables and then internal\nevents are perceived to be \"out of control\" of the individual.\nAs part of their approach, they suggest that values\nclarification is necessary so that the emphasis in relaxation\nis not placed entirely on the internal struggle, which can\noften descend into maladaptive self-talk and focus on\nregulation of internal psychological and physical states.\nRecent literature in the area of pain tolerance has\nexemplified the potential benefits of identifying values in\nfacilitating acceptance of aversive physical states.\nMcCracken and Yang (2006) found that success in valued\naction facilitated acceptance as opposed to avoidance of\npain, in chronic pain sufferers. Similarly, Garcia, Villa,\nCepeda, Cueto, and Montes (2004) found that an\nacceptance-based intervention that centered on values\nallowed athletes to accept the presence of certain bodily\nstates and private events during an exercise and focus on\nincreasing their performance.\nBranstetter-Rost, Cushing, and Douleh (2009) found that\nthe inclusion of the values component in an acceptance-\nbased intervention led to significantly greater tolerance of\npain in a cold-pressor task compared with an intervention\nwithout the values component. This indicates that the\nidentification of personal values prior to engaging in a\nrelaxation exercise may create a context where changes in\nphysical or psychological states are more acceptable, due to\nthe presence of a greater external goal.\nEvaluation: Defusion\nFusion is the idea that thoughts must be countered or acted\nupon if they are acknowledged because they in some way\nreflect external reality or are a precursor to an inevitable\n6 SAGE Open\nchain of events, such as becoming anxious. This perspective\nhas been discussed in relation to anxiety with the FOF\nhypothesis, wherein the thoughts and bodily sensations\nassociated with the anxious state during a previous\ndistressing experience become as feared as the original\nevents that precipitated the anxiety. Any appearance of\nsimilar thoughts or sensations is then interpreted as a signal\nthat the anxious state is about to reoccur.\nWithin this sequence, we can see the strong association\nbetween what could be an isolated and quite common\nprivate event (an errand thought or an awareness of\nphysiological change) and an eventual state of anxiety,\nleading to the evaluation that any such event is unwanted\nand should be tackled. Here, the private event functions as\nan aversive stimulus that elicits further verbal and\nphysiological responses.\nIn ACT, this view, that thoughts are literal reflections of\nreality, is known as fusion. ACT takes a different\nperspective: that thoughts are not literal and so do not need\nto be responded to. Strategies such paradox, mindfulness,\nand cognitive distancing aim to break the symbolic\nrelationship between thought and external reality by\ndisrupting how the thoughts function, rather than trying to\ndirectly modify their content or frequency (for a full\ntheoretical outline of defusion, see Blackledge, 2007).\nRecent studies have begun to demonstrate the positive\neffects of defusion (e.g., Healy et al., 2008). In addition,\nrecent findings by Hayes et al. (2010) exemplified exactly\nhow defusion might be beneficial in the relaxation process.\nThe authors found that facilitating a benign attentional bias\nreduces the frequency of negative thought intrusions. This\nindicates that once the tendency to evaluate private events\nas negative is altered, the events themselves will occur less\nfrequently. This finding is particularly interesting as it\ndemonstrates a way around the relaxation paradox: While\nattempting to directly reduce the frequency of events may\ncause paradoxical increases, their occurrence can be\nreduced indirectly by facilitating a benign approach.\nDefusion is one potential way this can be achieved.\nAttention: Acceptance and Willingness\nThe identification of personal values and the concept of\ndefusion could be considered to take place outside of the\nrelaxation \"exercise,\" be it PMR, focused berating, or a\nmeditative technique. Once personal values have been\nidentified and the process of defusion begun, there is a need\nto identify what a practitioner should do during the exercise\nwhen aversive private events occur.\nPreviously is has been suggested that the individual\nshould \"passively attend\" to any such events, while actively\nattending to the relaxation technique (Davidson &\nSchwartz, 1976). However, it could be argued that the\nactive/passive dichotomy is misleading, particularly in\nrelation to passive attention, in that it suggests that no\nreaction to private events should take place. Given the\naversive nature of these thoughts and bodily states, it would\nseem that the very act of allowing them to take place\nrequires some effort on the part of the individual. Such an\neffort would have a markedly different function than trying\nto avoid or suppress events, but it would be an effort\nnonetheless. Smith (1999) recognizes this in his ABC\nrelaxation model, wherein he identifies a need for\n\"receptivity\" to these events. Receptivity implies the\nopposite of avoidance, while also implying an ongoing\nconscious decision to allow events to occur.\nIn ACT, there are separate but inextricably linked\nconcepts of \"acceptance\" and \"willingness.\" In terms of\nprocess, willingness to experience unwanted thoughts and\nstates is necessary to accept them. Willingness therefore, is\nthe active attentional element when it comes to dealing with\naversive private events as they occur: Prior to the events\nentering awareness, the individual makes the conscious\ndecision of being willing to experience them. Acceptance is\nthe passive element in that events are experienced without\nattempts to modify or control them. A recent study by\nWilson, Barnes-Holmes, and Barnes-Holmes (2014) found\nthat an ACT-based intervention demonstrated different\npatterns of physiological responding in an anxiety-inducing\nsituation than other strategies including mindfulness and\nplacebo, suggesting that effective mitigation of anxiety\nresponses is more than \"doing nothing.\"\nWillingness is directly addressed in ACT and linked to\nthe personal values of the individual. Once personal values\nhave been identified, willingness to experience short-term\ndiscomfort is discussed in terms of movement toward long-\nterm personal values. Increased willingness to experience\naversive states has already been found to be associated with\ndecreased experiential avoidance and positive changes in\nanxiety (Twohig, Hayes, & Masuda, 2006).\nACT and Relaxation Comparisons\nAlthough we mentioned previously that it is common\npractice to integrate RTs into larger therapeutic techniques,\nexperimental studies often examine them in isolation,\ncomparing their efficacy directly with other therapeutic\napproaches such as CBT. The rationale for such\ncomparisons is, of course, to broaden the range of effective\ntreatment options for any particular disorder, by comparing\na new technique with one were the efficacy has already\nbeen established. Twohig et al. (2010), for example, found\nthat ACT produced favorable outcomes on a number of\npost-treatment measures of OCD, when compared with\nprogressive RT.\nHowever, it could be argued that where relaxation has\nbeen proven to be effective, some of the mechanisms for\nchange that facilitate positive outcomes with the new\napproach are largely present in the RT as well (Smits et al.,\n2004). In addition, RT in some form is often added to\ntherapeutic approaches wherever anxiety or stress-reduction\nis necessary because of its role in reducing somatic arousal\nWilson et al. 7\n(Poppen, 1998). Rather than view relaxation techniques as a\nseparate entity, it would seem more productive to identify\nthose elements within RTs that facilitate change and\nhighlight them in the therapy being combined with. This\nwould potentially lead to more effective and holistic results.\nConclusion\nThis article argues that acceptance and passivity are\nfunctionally similar concepts. However, acceptance from\nthis perspective appears to offer a number of distinct\nadvantages: (a) It is intuitively easier to work out what\nyou are required to do when you are accepting, especially\nwhen willingness is incorporated, rather than when you\nare being passive. Put simply, it is easier to learn how to\n\"be willing to have the feelings that are showing up\" than\nto learn to \"let go,\" \"calm down,\" or \"do nothing.\" (b) The\nlink between acceptance and personal values also gives\nyour therapeutic efforts meaning, especially in a context\nwhere you are being asked to accept psychological content\nthat is unpleasant or aversive. So, for relaxation you not\nonly know how to accept your content, but you also know\nthat you are doing this in an effort to move toward what\nyou value. Hence, acceptance and values, however they\nare conceptualized, are a necessary part of effective\nrelaxation.\nTraditional descriptions of relaxation emphasized the\nimportance of passivity toward thoughts and sensations, yet\nthere was little in the way of explanation of \"how to be\npassive\" because passivity is easily but incorrectly\ninterpreted as the absence of activity. In contrast, there is\nreason to conceptualize passivity as a more than this by\nacknowledging the necessary willingness to experience\nevents. This is supported by studies such as Wilson et al.\n(2014), where different patterns of physiological responding\nwere seen from participants who did nothing, compared\nwith an intervention that incorporated a willingness\nelement.\nFinally, we suggest that integration of the principles of\nrelaxation into larger therapeutic approaches offers a more\ncomplete understanding of how relaxation works or does\nnot work, as relaxation techniques are invariably influenced\nby the philosophy of the therapy they are a part of.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nsupported by The Irish Research Council for Humanities and\nSocial Sciences scholarship for doctoral research awarded to\nChristopher Wilson.\nReferences\nAdler, C., Craske, M., & Barlow, D.
