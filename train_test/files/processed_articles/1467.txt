    "reduced_content": "OBJECTIVE -- We examined prevalences of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed\ndiabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently suggested A1C criteria in the U.S. during\n2003\u00ad2006. We compared these prevalences to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose\ncriteria.\nNutrition Examination Survey included a probability sample of 14,611 individuals aged 12\nyears. Participants were classified on glycemic status by interview for diagnosed diabetes and by\nA1C, fasting, and 2-h glucose challenge values measured in subsamples.\nRESULTS -- Using A1C criteria, the crude prevalence of total diabetes in adults aged 20\nagnosed using A1C 6.5%). Another 3.5% of adults (7.4 million) were at high risk for diabetes\n(A1C 6.0 to 6.5%). Prevalences were disproportionately high in the elderly. Age-/sex-\nstandardized prevalence was more than two times higher in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans versus non-Hispanic whites for diagnosed, undiagnosed, and total diabetes (P \n0.003); standardized prevalence at high risk for diabetes was more than two times higher in\nnon-Hispanic blacks versus non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans (P  0.00001). Since\n1988\u00ad1994, diagnosed diabetes generally increased, while the percent of diabetes that was\nundiagnosed and the percent at high risk of diabetes generally decreased. Using A1C criteria,\nprevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and high risk of diabetes were one-third that and one-tenth\nthat, respectively, using glucose criteria.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Although A1C detects much lower prevalences than glucose criteria,\nhyperglycemic conditions remain high in the U.S., and elderly and minority groups are dispro-\nportionately affected.\nThe A1C test has recently been rec-\nommended for diagnosing diabetes,\nbased on a detailed analysis of its\nattributes by an international expert com-\nmittee (1). Laboratory-measured A1C is\nnow as accurate and precise as glucose\nassays due to improvements in instru-\nmentation and standardization. A1C sam-\nples can be obtained at any time, require\nno patient preparation, and are relatively\nstable at room temperature after collec-\ntion. A1C has substantially less biologic\nvariability and is unaffected by acute ef-\nfects of stress or illness. As a measure of\nlong-term glycemic exposure, A1C has\nbeen shown to be better and more consis-\ntently correlated with retinopathy in the\nsetting of observational studies and clini-\ncal trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetic\npatients, which have established widely\naccepted A1C treatment goals for diabe-\ntes. A cut point of 6.5% for the diagno-\nsis of diabetes was recommended by the\ncommittee as optimal for detecting a level\nof retinopathy thought to be diabetes spe-\ncific and not due to other conditions (e.g.,\nhypertension). A limitation of A1C for di-\nagnosis is that the committee could not\ndefine a specific intermediate threshold at\nwhich increased risk for diabetes clearly\nbegins. While there is a continuum of risk\neven at values into the normal range, the\ncommittee suggested the range of 6.0 to\n6.5% to represent the highest risk for\nprogression to diabetes and one at which\npreventive measures might be imple-\nmented, with additional consideration of\nprevention efforts at lower levels in the\npresence of other risk factors. The com-\nmittee hoped that its report would serve\nas a stimulus to the scientific community\nand professional organizations for con-\nsidering the A1C assay for diagnosis of\ndiabetes.\nA change in diagnostic criteria has\nimportant public health implications per-\ntaining to the magnitude of the popula-\ntion with diabetes or at high risk of\ndiabetes.

Fig. 1 classifies\nindividuals on glycemic status using data\nfrom the OGTT subsample who, in addi-\ntion to the 2-h plasma glucose, had mea-\nsurement of A1C and FPG. A total of 5.4%\nof the population aged 20 years was\nclassified as having undiagnosed diabetes\nbased on at least one of these criteria; the\nremaining population was classified as\nhaving diagnosed diabetes (7.8%) or be-\ning nondiabetic (86.9%). All three criteria\nsimultaneously classified 1.2% of the total\npopulation (23% of undiagnosed) as hav-\ning undiagnosed diabetes. The A1C crite-\nrion diagnosed the smallest percent\n(1.6%) of the total population, or 30% of\nthe undiagnosed diabetic group. In con-\ntrast, the 2-h plasma glucose diagnosed\nthose with undiagnosed diabetes; a sub-\nstantial percent (2.5% of the total popu-\nlation or 47% of undiagnosed diabetes)\nwas detected only by the 2-h plasma glu-\ncose but not by the A1C or FPG. In addi-\ntion, a substantial proportion (1.0% of the\ntotal population or 19.0% of undiagnosed\ndiabetes) was diagnosed by both FPG and\n2-h plasma glucose but not by A1C. Most\npeople who were diagnosed by A1C were\nalso diagnosed by FPG (1.2%) or 2-h\nplasma glucose (1.3%).\ncriteria to define undiagnosed diabetes\n(6.5%) and high risk of diabetes (6.0 to\n6.5%), we find that in the U.S. popula-\nthe crude prevalence of total diabetes is\nundiagnosed (7.8% previously diagnosed\nand 1.8% undiagnosed).

Although the prevalence of pre-\nviously diagnosed diabetes has significantly\nincreased over time in most population\ngroups, the proportion of diabetes that is\nundiagnosed using A1C criteria has signifi-\ncantly decreased over time in many groups,\nand the proportion at high risk of diabetes\nhas significantly decreased in almost all\ngroups.\nA1C criteria result in substantially\nlower prevalences of undiagnosed and to-\ntal diabetes, and being at high risk for di-\nabetes, than prevalences estimated from\nfasting plasma glucose or 2-h glucose.\nThe prevalences reported here can be\ncompared with our recently reported\nprevalences of undiagnosed diabetes, im-\npaired fasting glucose (IFG), and im-\nappendix Table A1, available at http://\ncare.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/\nof undiagnosed diabetes using A1C crite-\nria (1.8%) in this report was one-third\nthat using either FPG or 2-h glucose cri-\nalone, and 4.8% by 2-h alone), resulting\nin a prevalence of total diabetes using A1C\ncriteria one-quarter less than that of total\ndiabetes using either glucose criteria (9.3\nvs. 12.6%).

A relatively large propor-\ntion (19%) of undiagnosed diabetes was\ndetected by both FPG and 2-h glucose but\nnot by A1C.\nThe fact that prevalence of being at\nhigh risk for diabetes/pre-diabetes de-\ntected by A1C is about one-tenth the\nprevalence of IFG or IGT is striking. The\nrelatively small sample size during 2005\u00ad\ndance of prevalence at high risk for\ndiabetes using A1C versus prevalence of\npre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and\nnormal glucose status using glucose crite-\nria, because of the large number of over-\nlapping categories involved.\nCertain relationships by age and race/\nethnicity also differed between results\nbased on A1C criteria (herein) and glu-\ncose criteria (8) (online appendix Table\nA1). By age, undiagnosed diabetes in-\ncreased less dramatically using A1C crite-\nria than it did using glucose criteria,\nwhereas prevalence of being at high risk\nfor diabetes increased relatively more dra-\nmatically using A1C criteria. Factors un-\nrelated to glycemic control may explain\nsome of the increase by age in prevalence\nof high risk for diabetes. A1C increased\nwith age in nondiabetic participants of the\nFramingham Offspring Study and the\nmingham Offspring Study participants\nwith normal glucose tolerance, while ad-\njusting for fasting and 2-h glucose levels\nand other factors (9). Racial/ethnic differ-\nences in the prevalence of undiagnosed\ndiabetes and high risk of diabetes were\ndisproportionately greater using A1C cri-\nteria compared with glucose criteria,\nwhich may also be explained in part by\nfactors unrelated to glucose control.\nBlacks and Hispanics with IGT in the Di-\nabetes Prevention Program had higher\nA1C levels than whites, after adjusting for\nglucose levels and other factors such as\nage, sex, education, blood pressure, BMI,\nhematocrit, and insulin resistance (10).\nTable 2--Continued\nPercent of total diabetes that is\nundiagnosed\nCombined age groups (years)\nAge-specific groups (years)\nRace/ethnicity (age 20\nyears)\nAt high risk for diabetes\nCombined age groups (years)\nAge-specific groups (years)\nRace/ethnicity (age 20\nyears)\nData are % (95% CI).

Consequently, some prev-\nalence estimates may be overstated (11).\nIn addition, although there should be lim-\nited interference from hemoglobin traits\ndue to the A1C assay methods used in\nrious with conditions that change red cell\nturnover (e.g., anemia) (12,13) regardless\nof the assay method used.\nSome individuals with self-reported\ndiabetes may not have had diabetes de-\ntected if A1C criteria had been used.\nWhen we excluded individuals self-\nreporting diabetes who reported not us-\ning glycemic medications and who had\nA1C 6.5%, prevalence of diagnosed di-\nabetes decreased 0.9%. This was a larger\ndecrease than when we performed the\nsame analysis excluding those with FPG\ncrease). Consequently, our estimates of\ndiagnosed and total diabetes may be over-\nstated, and the percent of total diabetes\nthat is undiagnosed may be understated.\nThe international expert committee\nemphasized that glucose and A1C levels\nreflect different aspects of glucose metab-\nolism. The purpose of their report was not\nto establish identical prevalences in defin-\ning new criteria for diabetes and high risk\nfor diabetes but rather to identify individ-\nuals at risk for diabetes complications and\ndiabetes so that preventive treatment\ncould follow. It will be important to de-\ntermine longitudinally whether compli-\ncation rates differ between individuals\ndetected by glucose criteria or by A1C\ncriteria.\nIf A1C criteria are adopted by the\nAmerican Diabetes Association, the iden-\ntification of a smaller high-risk group may\nbe considered advantageous because of\nthe limited availability of resources. How-\never, a substantial proportion of individ-\nuals similar to those in the Diabetes\nPrevention Program (14) would be missed\nand not receive preventive intervention to\nreduce risk. The nearly 1% of the popu-\nlation previously diagnosed with diabetes\nwho no longer have diabetes by A1C cri-\nteria may need careful explanation of the\nalternative diagnostic criteria, the arbi-\ntrary cut point for diagnosis along a con-\ntinuum of risk, and the progressive nature\nof dysglycemia so that diabetic/pre-\ndiabetic conditions are not thought to be\nless real or serious. While the change in\ndiagnosis in some from diabetes to high\nrisk of diabetes using A1C criteria might\nnot alter recommended glycemic control\nand lifestyle management, recommended\nblood pressure and lipid targets would\ndiffer (15), requiring careful consider-\nation of individualized therapeutic goals.\nA change to A1C criteria would also\nimpact national surveillance of these con-\nditions. Estimated self-reported diabetes\nbased on surveys and the tracking of tem-\nporal trends would likely be difficult to\ninterpret for some time before these crite-\nria are fully assimilated in medical prac-\ntice. An interim period of measurement\nboth by A1C and glucose may be neces-\nsary for international and domestic his-\ntorical comparisons.\nThe potential impact of these dramat-\nically lower estimates of diabetes, and\nparticularly of high risk for diabetes, on\npublic perception of the magnitude and\nseriousness of diabetes is concerning. The\nfact remains that diabetes and its sequelae\nFigure 1--Undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. population aged 20 years by three diagnostic criteria--NHANES 2005\u00ad2006.
