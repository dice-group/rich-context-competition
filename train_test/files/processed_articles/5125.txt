In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects of telmisartan on the culture and proliferation of and\nKv1.3 potassium channel expression in peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes derived from Xinjiang Kazakh patients with\nhypertension.\nMethods: CD4+ T-cell samples from hypertensive Kazakh patients and healthy Kazakh people were divided into healthy\ncontrol, case control, telmisartan, and 4-aminopytidine groups. Changes in the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6\nand IL-17 in the blood of the healthy control and case control subjects were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay.

Recent\nstudies have confirmed that a large number of EH cases\nare closely related to the development of inflammation.\nActivation of inflammatory cells was shown to be involved\nin the development of hypertension,1,2 and it has been\nproposed that hypertension is a chronic, low-grade\nInhibitory effects of telmisartan on culture\nand proliferation of and Kv1.3 potassium\nchannel expression in peripheral blood\nCD4+ T lymphocytes from Xinjiang\nKazakh patients with hypertension\nSha-Sha Huang*, Qiu-Bing Zhang*, Qing-Yan Yuan,\nSi-Li He and Yuan-Ming Zhang\n Keywords\nXinjiang Kazakh, essential hypertension, CD4+ T Lymphocytes, Kv1.3 potassium channel, telmisartan\nHeart Centre, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University,\nChina\n*These authors contributed equally to this work and should be\nconsidered co-first authors.\nCorresponding author:\nYuan-Ming Zhang, Heart Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\ninflammatory disease.3,4 Animal studies have shown that\nactivation of massive inflammatory cells was obvious in a\nspontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, and the acti-\nvation was more significant in adult SHRs than in young\nSHRs.5 In fact, massive inflammatory mediators are\nupregulated in hypertensive patients, and their levels can\nbe used to predict the development of hypertension.\nInflammatory reactions in hypertensive patients are char-\nacterized by the expression and activation of cytokines.6,7\nT lymphocytes play an important role in the etiology\nand development of hypertension and vascular remode-\nling,8 and they are important for immune regulation. It is\nwell known that T lymphocytes can be divided into two\nsubsets, CD4+ and CD8+. CD4+ T lymphocytes account for\n35\u00ad50% of the total peripheral blood lymphocytes and\nregulate the biological activity of the immune system by\nsecreting cytokines and expressing cell surface molecules.\nCD4+ T lymphocytes secrete interferon gamma (INF-),\nwhich can stimulate the expression of major histocom-\npatibility complex (MHC) in endothelial cells (ECs) and\nsmooth muscle cells. This activates the antigen-presenting\nfunction of ECs and initiates immune responses. INF-\nalso improves T lymphocyte migration through the EC\nmonolayer.\nThe activation function of T lymphocytes depends on\nion channels located on their cell surfaces. Studies have\nshown that there are mainly three kinds of membrane ion\nchannels on T lymphocytes, a voltage-gated potassium\nchannel (Kv1.3), calcium-activated potassium channel\n(KCa3.1), and calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC)\nchannel. In 1984, DeCoursey et al.9 reported the presence\nof Kvl.3 potassium channels on T cells. The Kv1.3 volt-\nage-gated potassium channel is essential for the activation\nof T lymphocytes and is involved in some physiological\nprocesses, such as T-lymphocytic differentiation and pro-\nrole in lymphocyte activation in patients with acute coro-\nnary syndrome.12 Opening of the Kv1.3 potassium channel\nis essential for the membrane depolarization and mainte-\nnance of the resting potential. It has been reported that\nKv1.3 is involved in the development of various diseases,\nsuch as acute coronary syndrome, multiple sclerosis,\nasthma, tumors, etc.13\u00ad20 The forkhead transcriptional fac-\ntor FoxP3, expressed in T lymphocytes, is critical for the\nproduction of angiotensin II, which is essential for the pro-\ngression of EH.8 Some studies have shown that besides\nlowering blood pressure, angiotensin receptor blockers\n(ARBs), which are widely used to treat hypertension, also\nKazakh individuals are the second largest minority in\nXinjiang, and they have a high incidence of hypertension,\nrates of disease awareness, cure, and control appear to be\nlower among Kazakhs than in other ethnic groups.\nTherefore, studying the pathogenesis of hypertension in\nKazakh individuals has social significance. However, few\nstudies have assessed the effects of telmisartan, one of the\nARBs, on the proliferation of peripheral blood CD4+ T\nlymphocytes, as well as messenger RNA (mRNA) and\nprotein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in\nCD4+ T lymphocytes derived from Xinjiang Kazakh\npatients with EH.\nIn this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) to detect changes in the expression levels\nof interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 in the blood of hyperten-\nsive Kazakh patients. We used magnetic-activated cell\nsorting (MACS) to isolate CD4+ T lymphocytes from\nperipheral blood of Xinjiang Kazakh patients with EH and\nhealthy Kazakh people. Then, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-\n8) and microscope photography were used to analyze the\nculture and proliferation of the CD4+ T lymphocytes.\nReal-time quantitative reverse transcription\u00adpolymerase\nchain reaction (qRT\u00adPCR) and Western blotting were\nused to determine the mRNA and protein expression\nlevels of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in the CD4+ T\nlymphocytes. Our results may provide the theoretical\nmechanisms and experimental evidence for the anti-\ninflammatory effect of telmisartan.\nMethods\nSubjects\nWe selected Kazakh hypertensive patients and healthy\nKazakh people as the subjects for our experiments. Thirty\nKazakh hypertensive patients (mean age: 50.4\u00b13.5 years)\nattending the cardiology clinic of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Xinjiang Medical University were enrolled in\nthe study between January\u00adAugust 2015. The healthy sub-\njects were all assigned to a healthy control group, while the\nhypertensive subjects were randomised into the following\nthree groups: (a) case controls; (b) telmisartan; and (c)\n4-aminopytidine (4-AP). There were 10 individuals (five\nmales and five females) in each group, and they were not\nundergoing antihypertensive therapy.\nThe diagnostic criteria of hypertension, used as the\ninclusion criteria, were as stated in the 2010 Chinese\nguidelines for the management of hypertension.26 Briefly,\nkPa) and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, with-\nout treatment with antihypertensive medication, were con-\nsidered the diagnostic criteria of hypertension.\nSubjects with the following types of diseases were\nexcluded from our experiments: (a) secondary hyperten-\nsion; (b) cerebrovascular disease; (c) coronary, rheumatic,\nor congenital heart disease; (d) acute or chronic infection;\n(e) autoimmune disease; (f) important organ failure; (g)\ndiabetes; and (h) carotid atherosclerosis.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the World\nMedical Association Declaration of Helsinki. All proce-\ndures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First\nHuang et al. 3\nAffiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University\nsigned by each subject before the trial.\nReagents\nIL-6 and IL-17 ELISA kits were from eBioscience (San\nDiego, California, USA). Human lymphocyte isolation\nmedium, recombinant human IL-2 (rIL-2), phytohemag-\nglutinin (PHA), and 4-AP were purchased from Sigma\u00ad\nAldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The MACS kit was\nfrom Miltenyi Biotec (Germany), and telmisartan was\nfrom Boehringer\u00adIngelheim (Germany). Fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute\n(RPMI) 1640 medium were obtained from HyClone\n(New Zealand). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabelled mouse anti-human CD3 and FITC-labelled\nmouse anti-human CD4 were from Becton, Dickinson\nand Company (USA). TRIzol was from Life Technologies\n(USA). The RT kit, Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay\n(RIPA) lysis buffer, protease inhibitor, bicinchoninic acid\n(BCA) protein assay kit, and enhanced chemilumines-\ncence (ECL) Western blotting kit were from Thermo\nFisher (USA). The real-time fluorescent qPCR kit was\nfrom Qiagen (Germany). Sodium dodecyl sulphate poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u00adPAGE) reagents\nwere purchased from Bio-Rad (USA). Anti-human mon-\noclonal antibodies against the Kv1.3 potassium channel\nand -actin and secondary antibodies were obtained from\nAbcam (UK). The 5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolyphosphate/\nnitro-blue tetrazolium chromogenic reagent was from\nInvitrogen (USA).\nCD4+ T lymphocyte isolation\nPeripheral venous blood (10 ml) was collected from each\nsubject into a heparinized vacutainer tube. Peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells were isolated using human lym-\nphocyte isolation medium and density gradient centrifu-\ngation. Using the Pan T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi,\nGermany), human T lymphocytes were isolated by deple-\ntion of non-target T cells (negative selection). Non-target\nT cells were magnetically labelled with a cocktail of bio-\ntin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and the Pan T cell\nmicrobead cocktail. They were retained on a MACS sep-\naration column in the magnetic field of a MACS separa-\ntor (Miltenyi, Germany), while unlabeled T lymphocytes\npassed through the column. The purity of the enriched T\nlymphocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry (Beckman\nCoulter, USA). The cells were fluorescently stained with\nFITC\u00adCD3 and analyzed using a MACSQuant analyzer\n(Miltenyi, Germany). Cell debris and dead cells were\nexcluded from the analysis based on scatter signals and\npropidium iodide fluorescence. The results showed that\n>95% of the cells were T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes\nwere incubated with CD4 monoclonal antibodies. The\nsuspensions were then incubated with magnetic beads\ncoated with goat anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G (IgG),\nwhich bind to antibody-coated cells. Subsequent expo-\nsure to a strong magnetic field removed unwanted cells,\nleaving the desired cell population. The cell-coated mag-\nnetic beads were resuspended in complete medium. Anti-\nhuman FITC-CD4 was added, and the T lymphocytes\nwere analyzed using flow cytometry. The results showed\nthat >95% of the cells were CD4+ T lymphocytes, which\nwere used for subsequent experiments.\nCell culture\nCD4+ T lymphocytes were seeded into 24-well plates con-\nin an incubator\n(Thermo, USA) for 48 h to promote T lymphocyte activa-\ntion. The cultured CD4+ T lymphocytes were treated as\nfollows: telmisartan (final concentration, 100 mol/l),\n4-AP (final concentration, 3 mmol/l), or an equal volume\nof a dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) vehicle was added to\nthe culture media of cells from the telmisartan, 4-AP, and\ncontrol groups, respectively. The CD4+ T lymphocytes\nwere then cultured for 0, 24, and 48 h, and the suspensions\nwere harvested. Changes in the T-lymphocytic growth sta-\ntus, shape, and quantity were observed and recorded by\nmicroscope photography using an inverted fluorescent\nmicroscope (Leica, Germany). Then, the samples were\ndivided into three portions, for CCK-8 analysis and extrac-\ntion of RNA and protein, respectively.\nELISA assay\nPeripheral blood (5 ml) from the healthy Kazakh people\nin the healthy control group and from the hypertensive\nKazakh patients in the case control group was incubated\nat room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at\ncollected and stored at -80\u00b0C. Then, levels of IL-6 and\nIL-17 were analyzed in the serum using the ELISA kits\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Both test\nsamples and standard samples were tested in duplicate.\nAbsorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate\nreader (Bio-Rad). Then, standard curves were estab-\nlished, and levels of IL-6 and IL-17 were calculated from\nthe standard curves.\nCCK-8 analysis of T-lymphocytic proliferation\nCD4+ T lymphocytes, precultured with PHA and rIL-2 for\n(less than 2000 cells per well). The cells were treated with\ntelmisartan, 4-AP, or DMSO as described previously (eight\nreplicate wells per treatment) for 0, 24, and 48 h. After the\nincubation, 10 l of the CCK-8 reagent was added to the\nwells. The culture plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2\nin\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nan incubator for 3 h, and optical density (OD) values were\nmeasured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer.\nThen, cellular activities of the different groups were calcu-\nlated as follows:\nCellular activity\nOD value of interventional group\nOD\n%\n( ) =\n-\nv\nvalue of control group\nOD value of interventional g\n\n\n\n\n\n /\nr\nroup at h\nOD value of control group at h\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nRNA extraction and qRT\u00adPCR analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from CD4+ T lymphocytes using\nratios of the resulting RNA sam-\nples were approximately 1.8\u00ad2.0. RT reactions were per-\nformed using 1 g of RNA at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by\nincubation at 70\u00b0C for 5 min. The total volume of qPCR\nreactions was 20 l, including 10 l of SYBR Green PCR\nmaster mix (2\u00d7), 2 l of cDNA template, 0.5 l of each for-\nward (F) and reverse (R) primer, and 7 l of H2\nO. The\nsequences of the genes encoding the Kv1.3 potassium chan-\nnel and -actin (ACTB gene) were obtained from GenBank.\nThe primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech\n(Shanghai). ACTB was used as an internal reference control\ngene (Table 1).

The\nresults demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the Kv1.3\npotassium channel were lower in the telmisartan and 4-AP\ngroups after 24 h and 48 h of treatment than those in the\nhealthy control and case control groups (p<0.05). There\nwere no statistically significant differences in the expres-\nsion of Kv1.3 potassium channel mRNA at different time\npoints in the healthy control and case control groups\n(p>0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of the\nKv1.3 potassium channel were significantly reduced in the\nCD4+ T lymphocytes at 24 h and 48 h compared with the\nlevels at 0 h in the telmisartan and 4-AP groups (p<0.05)\n(Figure 2).

Thus, it has been confirmed recently that\ntumor necrosis factor alpha increased the activity of\nreduced coenzyme II oxidase in polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes, which led to oxidative stress, an inflammatory\nresponse, and elevated blood pressure.30 Under various\nconditions, activated T lymphocytes will produce multiple\ninflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-17.\nConsistent with most studies, here we found that the levels\nof IL-6 and IL-17 in peripheral blood were higher in\nKazakh hypertensive patients than in related healthy per-\nsons, which indicated that there was an activation of\ninflammatory cytokines in the hypertensive patients.\nThe T lymphocyte function depends on the electrical\nactivity of ion channels in their cell membrane.31 Studies\nusing patch clamps have suggested that Kv1.3 potassium\nchannels are the key effectors of the sustained activation of\nCD4+T lymphocytes.32 The main effects of Kv1.3 potas-\nsium channels are to maintain the membrane potential and\nintracellular calcium signaling, which regulates the cell\nproliferation and cytokine production. Kv1.3 potassium\nchannels are likely targets for the immune or bi-directional\nprevention of EH and are associated with many clinical\ndiseases. Thus, Beeton and others33,34 studied peripheral\nblood of multiple sclerosis patients and postmortem brain\nlesions and found that the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells\nwere mainly CCR7\u00adCD45RA effector memory T cells,\nwhich exhibited increased expression of Kv1.3 channels.\nGuo et al.35 detected increased levels of Kv1.3 potassium\nchannel mRNA in rat lymphocytes, suggesting that the\nelevated expression of Kv1.3 on T lymphocytes plays an\nimportant role in atherosclerosis in rats. Xu et al.14 found\nthat CD4+/CD28- T lymphocytes were potential immu-\nnomodulatory targets in patients with acute coronary syn-\ndrome and suggested that selective blocking of CD4+/\nCD28- T lymphocytes could be used to treat the disease.\nTherefore, this study focused on Kv1.3 channels on CD4+\nT lymphocytes derived from Kazakh hypertensive patients.\nAs a Kvl.3 potassium channel inhibitor, 4-AP can\ninhibit the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes\nand regulate the cytokine production and immune\nresponses by inhibiting the Kvl.3 potassium channel.\nSome studies have shown thatARBs can effectively inhibit\nthe Kvl.3 potassium channel, regulate the immunity\nthrough anti-inflammation and antioxidation, and play an\nimportant role as anti-atherosclerosis drugs. By observing\nFigure 3. Representative Western blots of protein samples extracted from activated peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes from\nXinjiang Kazakh essential hypertension (EH) patients.

Moreover, we have also previously\nreported that the mRNA and protein expression levels of\nthe Kv1.3 potassium channel are significantly elevated in\nlymphocytes from hypertensive Kazakh patients from\nXinjiang38 and that the Kv1.3 potassium current densities\nin peripheral blood T lymphocytes of this population\nwere also higher.39 These studies support the concept that\npotassium channels of T lymphocytes are involved in the\npathogenesis and progression of hypertension through\ntheir role in T lymphocyte activation. We have also per-\nformed studies demonstrating that telmisartan can block\nKv1.3 potassium channels in lymphocytes of SHRs in a\nconcentration-dependent manner.40 In addition, telmisar-\ntan effectively inhibited potassium current densities in\nperipheral blood T lymphocytes of Kazakh patients\nwith EH in a time-dependent manner.41 Hence, ARBs,\nincluding telmisartan, have the potential to elicit potent\nanti-inflammatory effects by blocking Kv1.3 potassium\nchannels on T lymphocytes, although the specific underly-\ning mechanisms remain unclear.\nIn the present study, there were no significant differ-\nences between the healthy control and case control groups,\nwhich indicated that the findings reflect a general phenom-\nenon characteristic of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Electron\nmicroscopy revealed that after the incubation with 4-AP at\nan effective concentration for 0, 24, and 48 h, the numbers\nof CD4+ T lymphocytes were gradually reduced, their cel-\nlular activity gradually lowered, the shape condensed and\ngradually shrank, and many apoptotic cells could be seen.\nqRT\u00adPCR and western blotting revealed that after the incu-\nbation with 4-AP at an effective concentration for 0, 24,\nand 48 h, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the\nKv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes were sig-\nnificantly reduced. The results showed that 4-AP had an\nobvious inhibitory effect on T-lymphocytic proliferation, as\nwell as on mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3\npotassium channel in CD4+ T lymphocytes, which indi-\nrectly indicated that the Kvl.3 potassium channel is the key\nfactor of T lymphocyte activation. The 4-AP group was\nused as a positive control group, and the telmisartan group\nshowed similar changes, although the changes in the\nT-lymphocytic proliferation and mRNAand protein expres-\nsion of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in CD4+ T lympho-\ncytes were slower and weaker with telmisartan relative\nto those in the 4-AP group. This indicates that the anti-\ninflammatory function and inhibitory effects of telmisartan\non the T lymphocyte Kv1.3 potassium channel are unlikely\nto affect the normal immune function in hypertensive\npatients. The CCK-8 analysis, qRT\u00adPCR, and Western\nblotting showed that the cellular activities and mRNA and\nprotein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel in the\ntelmisartan and 4-AP groups were significantly lower at 24\nand 48 h than at 0 h, with a slow, time-dependent, descend-\ning tendency. Compared with the data for the same time\npoints in the healthy and case control groups, the cellular\nactivities and mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3\npotassium channel were significantly reduced in the tel-\nmisartan group. This indicates that the drug can effectively\ninhibit the proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, as well as\nthe mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3 potassium\nchannel. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of telmisartan\non the T-lymphocytic proliferation and mRNA and protein\nexpression of the Kv1.3 potassium channel were time-\ndependent over a 48-hour period.\nNataraj et al.42 demonstrated that the angiotensin II type\n1 receptor (AT1R) is strongly expressed on T lymphocytes.\nAT1R can increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by\nactivating T lymphocyte potassium channels, which trig-\ngers the Ca2+-mediated activation of the calcineurin/\nnuclear factor (CaN/NFAT) signalling pathway, leading to\nT lymphocyte activation and proliferation. We conclude\nthat increased expression of potassium channels on CD4+\nT lymphocytes enhances potassium ion efflux, and the\nincreased gradient of the electric potential on both sides of\nthe cytomembrane generates hyperpolarization to promote\ncalcium ion influx. This causes a transient increase in the\ncalcium concentration, with subsequent CaN-mediated\ndephosphorylation of NFAT and activation of the CaN/\nNFAT signaling pathway. The activated CaN/NFAT signal-\nling pathway mediates T lymphocyte proliferation and the\nrelease of inflammatory cytokines to promote develop-\nment of hypertension. Telmisartan can inhibit T lympho-\ncyte potassium channels, which results in decreased influx\nof extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm and inhibition of\nthe CaN/NFAT signalling pathway. Consequently, the acti-\nvation and proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes are\nstrongly suppressed, which promotes an anti-inflamma-\ntory environment.\nTaken together, here we found that telmisartan could\ninhibit the culture and proliferation of CD4+ T lympho-\ncytes from Xinjiang Kazakh patients with hypertension,\nas well as the mRNA and protein expression of the Kv1.3\npotassium channel, to exert anti-inflammatory effects.\nThis suggests that hypertension is an inflammatory dis-\nease and provides experimental support for the anti-\ninflammatory activity of telmisartan based on cellular and\nion channel biology. However, certain limitations exist in\nour study. In particular, our experiments were performed\nin vitro, and the number of subjects was insufficient.\nTherefore, we plan to complete a clinical follow-up or in\nvivo study to provide evidence for the antihypertensive\neffects of telmisartan.\nHuang et al. 9\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science\nReferences\n1.
