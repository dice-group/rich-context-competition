The DAWN, cur-\nrently sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Men-\ntal Health Services Administration, was designed\nto monitor nonalcohol substance abuse based on a\nnationally representative probability sample of\nhospital EDs. National estimates of alcohol-related\nED visits were not available until recent years.\n~ ~~\nFrom the Department of Emergency Medicine, TheJohns Hop-\nkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD (GL, PMK,\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a grant\nPrevention, and a grant from the Alcoholic Beverage Medical\nResearch Foundation.\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Guohua Li, MD,\nDrPH, Department of Emergency Medicine, Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine, 600 North Wolfe Street, Mar-\ne-mail: ghli@jhmi.edu\nMost previous studies of alcohol and ED visits\nwere limited to individual hospitals, with an em-\nphasis on the relationship between alcohol and in-\njury.* In an ED-based study involving 4 community\nhospitals, Cherpitels found that 11% of injured pa-\ntients and 5% of diseased patients were positive for\nalcohol. Involvement of alcohol in adolescent\ntrauma has been reported to range from 36% to\n48%.4-sUsing a case-crossover design, Vinson et\nal.7examined the transient effect of alcohol on the\nrisk of injury necessitating an ED visit and found\nthat alcohol use is associated with a 1.5-fold in-\ncreased risk of injury.\nAlthough a variety of diseases are directly at-\ntributable to alcohol, few studies have examined\nthe role of alcohol in emergency medical conditions\nother than injury. Little is known about the distri-\nbution of alcohol-related ED visits in different pop-\nulations and geographic regions. This study was\nundertaken to document the descriptive epidemi-\nology of alcohol-related ED visits at a national\nlevel and to explore the utility of the National Hos-\npital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)\nas a resource for emergency care research.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design. This study was an analysis of\ndata on ED visits from the 1995NHAMCS. Started\nin 1992 and sponsored by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS), the NHAMCS collects\ndata each year for a national probability sample of\nED visits and outpatient department visits, to pro-\nvide health services information about ambulatory\nmedical care in the United States.8 Since data for\nthis study were from the database issued by the\nNCHS for public use with all patient identifiers\nremoved, this research was exempted from review\nby the institutional review board at the Johns Hop-\nkins University School of Medicine.\nStudy Setting. The NHAMCS has 2 components,\nED visits and outpatient department visits. This\nstudy was limited to the data for ED visits. The\nED visits database of the 1995 NHAMCS was a\nnationally representative sample of all visits to\nEDs of nonfederal and noninstitutional hospitals,\nexclusive of hospitals with an average length of\nstay for all patients of 230 days. Using a multi-\nstage probability sampling strategy, the 1995\ntals, with a hospital response rate of 94%.8 The\nUS. Bureau of the Census regional office staff co-\nordinated the data collection, including training\nthe field representatives and overseeing the imple-\nmentation of the protocol. Field representatives\nwere responsible for inducting hospitals and train-\ning the hospital staff on the visit sampling method\nand completion of the data forms. The actual data\ncollection was done by the trained hospital staff\nusing the uniform patient record forms during a\nrandomly assigned 4-week period for each of the\nselected hospitals. The patient record form was\nfilled out at or near the time of visit for each sam-\npled patient. The hospital staff responsible for data\ncollection were instructed in how to complete each\ndata item by the field representatives and were\nprovided with instruction booklets.\nThe target number of patient record forms to be\ncompleted was 50 ED visits at each of the selected\nhospitals. Visits were selected based on a system-\natic sampling method; i.e., picking up every r-th\nvisit after a random start, with r determined by\ndividing the expected number of visits during the\nreporting period by 50. The sampling design and\ndata collection procedures are described in detail\nelsewhere.8\nMeasurements. The patient record form contains\na data item indicating whether the visit was alco-\nhol- or drug-related. A visit was defined as being\nalcohol-related if the patient's most important\ncomplaint or presenting problem was caused by\nuse or abuse of alcohol. By this definition, alcohol-\nrelated visits also include trauma patients who\nwere injured by alcohol intoxicated drivers. Alco-\nhol-relatedness was determined by the hospital\nstaff based on information in the medical records,\nsuch as patient complaints, physician diagnoses,\nand laboratory testing results. Alcohol-relatedness\native analysis indicated that those visits with un-\nknown alcohol-relatedness were more similar in\npatient age, gender, and race to the visits that\nwere not alcohol-related than the visits that were\nalcohol-related. In the data analysis, visits with\nunknown alcohol-relatedness. were combined with\nvisits that were not alcohol-related. Categorizing\nthe 4,556 visits with unknown alcohol-relatedness\ninto the group of visits that were not alcohol-re-\nlated undoubtedly biased the results toward un-\nderestimating the magnitude of alcohol-related ED\nvisits. In this study, the measurements of interest\nwere the estimated annual frequency of alcohol-re-\nlated ED visits, the rates of alcohol-related ED vis-\nits per 1,000 population, and the proportions of ED\nvisits that were alcohol-related.\nData Analysis. The probability sampling design\nof the NHAMCS made it possible to generate na-\ntional estimates of the major epidemiologic char-\nacteristics of ED visits. Based on the probabilities\nof selection and adjustment for nonresponse, a Ups-\ntient visit weight\" was assigned by NCHS to each\nNHAMCS sample. Using these weights in the data\nanalysis provides national estimates. Standard er-\nrors for these national estimates were computed\nusing the method recommended by NCHS.8 To\navoid the complexity resulting from the multistage\nprobability sampling design, significance testing\nwas not conducted. Instead, 95% confidence inter-\nvals (CIS) were calculated using the standard er-\nrors. Population data used to compute annual\nrates of alcohol-related ED visits were based on the\nprovisional estimates for the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized population as of July 1, 1995, provided\nby the U S . Bureau of the Census.\nPatient characteristics examined in this study\nincluded age, sex, race, insurance status, and ge-\nographic region. Information on smoking, depres-\nsion, time of the visit, urgency of the visit, reason\nfor the visit, and principal diagnosis also was an-\nalyzed. Urgency was coded as either \"urgentlemer-\ngent,\" if the medical condition necessitated imme-\ndiate attention and delay of care would be harmful\nto the patient; or \"non-urgent,\" if the medical con-\ndition did not necessitate attention immediately or\nwithin a few hours. Data analysis progressed from\nTABLE 1.

Overall, 1\nof 6 ED visits was made by uninsured patients.\nVisits by patients who were uninsured were sig-\nnificantly more likely than other visits to be alco-\nhol-related (Table 2). This association between in-\nsurance status and alcohol-related visits was also\nfound in different subgroups of patients aged 215\nyears when stratified by age, gender, and race.\nThe prevalence rates of smoking and depression\namong ED patients were 7% and 3%,respectively.\nED visits by patients who smoked were >12 times\nas likely to be alcohol-related as visits by non-\nsmokers (Table 2). The proportion of alcohol-re-\nlated ED visits for patients with depression was\nnearly 6 times that for patients without depression\n(Table 2). Whereas depression was more common\namong smokers than nonsmokers (9% vs l%),\nthere appeared an interaction effect of depression\nand smoking on alcohol-related ED visits: the pro-\nportion of alcohol-related visits increased from\nfor nonsmokers without depression, to 5% for\nnonsmoking patients with depression, to 9% for\nsmokers without depression, and to 23% for smok-\ners with depression.\nInjury accounted for 39% of all ED visits and\n50% of all alcohol-related ED visits (Table 2).\nAmong injury-related visits, those resulting from\nassaults or homicide were most likely to involve\nalcohol (19%), followed by self-inflicted injuries\n(lo%), poisoning (7%), and motor vehicle crashes\nAlcohol-related ED visits accounted for a higher\nproportion of visits that were coded as urgent/\nemergent as compared with nonurgent visits (Ta-\nble 2).

This ra-\ncial discrepancy in alcohol-related ED visits is\nprobably due to socioeconomic factors.

Thus, additional yet-to-be-explored\nfactors, such as the higher incidence rates of fire-\narm-related injuries among blacks,i8must contrib-\nute to the observed racial disparity in rates of al-\ncohol-related ED visits.\nThis study adds more evidence that alcohol is\nan important risk factor for injuries treated at the\nED. Injury-related ED visits were significantly\nmore likely to involve alcohol than other ED visits.\nOne-half of all alcohol-related ED visits were due\nto injuries. Although the strength of the associa-\ntion between alcohol and injury among ED pa-\ntients is not as strong as found in patients admit-\nted to trauma centers or in injury fatalities,lgthe\nmagnitude of alcohol-related injury necessitating\nemergency care is worrisome. Results from this\nstudy indicate that approximately 1.3 million ED\nvisits each year are attributable to alcohol-related\ninjury.

Depression is preva-\nlent among elder ED patients but is rarely recog-\nnized by E P S . ~ ~\nSince alcohol, tobacco, and depres-\nsion are closely correlated, it will be beneficial to\napply a holistic approach to addressing these\nhealth issues in the ED patient population. The\nroutine practice of screening all ED patients for\nrisk factors such as alcohol abuse and cigarette\nsmoking, in conjunction with a streamlined mech-\nanism for referral into rehabilitation and counsel-\ning programs, could lead to emergency services'\nhaving a profound impact on the nation's public\nhealth. Improving and ensuring access to high-\nquality emergency care is one of the priority areas\nrecommended by the Macy Foundation Conference\non the Future of Emergency Medicine.25The Public\nHealth and Education Task Force of the SAEM is\ncharged with making access to emergency care, in-\ncluding screening for substance abuse and violent\nbehaviors and providing counseling, referral, pa-\ntient education, and community-based health pro-\nmotion, an objective of the national health agenda\nLIMITATIONS\nQUESTIONS\nDespite the importance of emergency medical care\nin the national health system, ED-based surveil-\nlance has been largely lacking. A few existing ED-\nbased information systems are restricted to moni-\ntoring narrowly defined emergency episodes. While\nthe DAWN is limited to nonalcohol drug abuse, the\nUS. Consumer Product Safety Commission's Na-\ntional Electronic Injury Surveillance System\n(NEISS) reports only certain product-related inju-\nries treated in a probability sample of 91 hospital\nED's.18 Injuries related to major products such as\nalcoholic beverages and motor vehicles are not in-\ncluded in the NEISS.\nThe NHAMCS represents the most comprehen-\nsive ED-based information system. This study\nshows that the NHAMCS is a valuable data source\nfor studying the epidemiology of emergency medi-\ncal conditions at the national level. Data on alco-\nhol-related ED visits from the NHAMCS appeared\nto be valid because the age, gender, and geographic\npatterns described in this study are consonant\nwith drinking patterns in the general population.\nSince we combined those visits in which the role\nof alcohol was unknown with visits known not to\nbe alcohol-related, the estimated frequency and\nrates of alcohol-related ED visits reported here are\nconservative. Inherent limitations of the data in-\nclude the fact that alcohol-relatedness of ED visits\nwas not determined by universal alcohol testing,\nbut rather by evaluation of the clinical presenta-\ntion as reflected in the patient's chart. Further-\nmore, because patients were not routinely\nscreened for problem drinking using established\ninterview instruments, the results of this study are\nprimarily estimates of acute alcohol effects. There-\nfore, the data should not be interpreted as the\nprevalence of alcoholism in the ED patient popu-\nlation. A study involving 2 hospitals and using\nstandard screening instruments indicated that the\nprevalence rates of alcohol dependence among ED\ndepending on the geographic region and patient\ncharacteristic^.^'\nFuture research should address the economic\ncosts of alcohol-related ED visits, further examine\nthe role of alcohol in other major emergency med-\nical conditions such as chest pain and abdominal\npain, and implement and evaluate ED-based inter-\nvention programs.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol abuse poses a major burden on the nation's\nemergency care system. Each year, nearly 3 mil-\nlion ED visits are caused by abuse of alcohol. In-\njury accounts for 50%of all alcohol-related ED vis-\nits. The age, gender, and geographic characteristics\nof alcohol-related ED visits are consistent with\ndrinking patterns in the general population. Men,\nyoung and mid-aged adults, and blacks are at in-\ncreased risk of making alcohol-related ED visits.\nED visits by uninsured patients are more than\ntwice as likely to be alcohol-related as visits by the\ninsured. Alcohol among injury-related visits is sig-\nnificantly more prevalent than among visits for\nother medical conditions. Alcohol-related ED visits\nare closely correlated with smoking and depres-\nsion. The causal relationship between alcohol and\ninjury is well established based on controlled epi-\ndemiologic studies. There is a need to systemati-\ncally examine the role of alcohol in other major\nemergency medical conditions, such as chest pain\nand abdominal pain. High priority should be\nplaced on integrating alcohol screening and inter-\nvention programs into emergency care.\nThe authors thank Sophia Sterling for preparing the graphs\nand references.\nReferences\n1.
