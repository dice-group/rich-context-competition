An algorithm identifying days\nof above-baseline E1G that coincided with the days of\nbaseline pregnanediol-3-glucuronide was used to iden-\ntify days of unopposed estrogen.

Greater estrogen exposure,\nassessed via indirect indicators such as number of years\nspent having menstrual cycles (e.g., ref. 5) or direct\nindicators such as hormone measures (e.g., ref. 6), is\nassociated with increased risk for cancers of the breast and\novary (3, 7, 8). Similarly, exposure to estrogen unopposed\nby progesterone is a risk factor for endometrial and\novarian cancers (8). The precise mechanism by which\nestrogen contributes to reproductive cancers is not known,\nbut etiologic theories highlight the role of estrogen in cell\nproliferation in the endometrium and breast and epithelial\nrepair of the ovary following ovulation (3, 7-10).\nErratic estrogen secretion is characteristic of the\nperimenopausal years (11) and may be an important\nsource of risk for reproductive cancers. However, the\nperimenopause, which may last several years (12), has\nnot been explicitly considered in studies of hormones\nand reproductive cancers. Hale et al. (13) recently\nemphasized Pike's (14) suggestion that the perimeno-\npausal years constitute an important ``window of risk''\nfor endometrial cancer. These years may also be an\nimportant window of risk for other estrogen-related\ncancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers (15), as well\nas for the increased likelihood of uterine fibroids,\nendometrial hyperplasia, dysfunctional uterine bleeding,\nand progression of endometriosis symptoms observed in\nthe perimenopause (16). Thus, detailed characterization\nof estrogen dynamics during the perimenopause is\nimportant for understanding its potential implications\nfor reproductive cancers and other health outcomes.\nMenstrual cycle length changes as women make the\ntransition to menopause. On average, cycles become\nlonger and more variable with increasing proximity to\nmenopause (17). Compared with the hormonal patterns\nof the prime reproductive years, the transition to\nmenopause is associated with increased variability in\nInstitute, Pennsylvania State University; Center for Studies in Demography and\nEcology, University of Washington; and Center for Population and Health,\nGeorgetown University.\nRequests for reprints: Kathleen A.

In recent work, we found that\nindividual-level urinary estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G)\nincreased from 25 to 45 years and then declined in the\nlate 40s for most women (36). These disparate results\narise because of (a) differences among studies in the\ntiming of sampling, sample selection or sample size, and\nstudy design, (b) erratic fluctuations in hormone levels\nconfounding comparisons during the perimenopause,\nand (c) use of age as an anchor for comparisons among\nwomen: aggregate estrogen patterns can mask hormonal\ntrajectories that individual women actually experience as\nThus, it remains unclear whether women are exposed\nto more or less overall estrogen during the perimeno-\npause compared with the prime reproductive years.\nHere, we examine estrogen trajectories for individual\nwomen across reproductive stages (37). We estimate total\nand unopposed estrogen exposure by stage while\ncontrolling for age and body mass index (BMI).\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Data were collected as part of the\nBiodemographic Models of Reproductive Aging\n(BIMORA) project (36). Participants were recruited from\nthe Tremin Research Program on Women's Health\n(TREMIN; ref. 38). Participants included women aged\nbetween 25 and 60 years, not using prescription\nreproductive hormones, and who had at least one intact\novary. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women\nreceiving cancer treatment were not eligible. Monetary\ncompensation was provided for participation. All sub-\njects provided written informed consent, and all proce-\ndures were approved by the institutional review boards\nof the University of Utah, Pennsylvania State University,\nGeorgetown University, and University of Washington.\nData Collection. First morning urine specimens and\ninformation on menstrual bleeding were collected daily\nDaily information was collected on major medical\nconditions and treatments and over-the-counter and\nprescription medication. Most participants continued to\nrecord menstrual bleed data on calendar cards for\nTREMIN.

For the remaining 18\nwomen, we used all available BMI data from previous\nyears for each woman in a linear mixed-effects model of\nBMI by year and used the estimated model fits to impute\na 2000 value. The mean (SD) and median BMI for the\nrespectively. Seventy percent of the BMIs were <25\nLaboratory Methods. Urine specimens were assayed\nwith enzyme immunoassays for E1G, a metabolite of\nestradiol, and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PDG), a\nmetabolite of progesterone. Interassay and intra-assay\ncoefficients of variation (CV) were 9.2% and 10.3% for\nthe PDG enzyme immunoassay and 4% and 3.6% for the\nand significant cross-reactants closely parallel the serum\nlevels of estradiol and progesterone (39, 40).\nHormone concentrations were estimated from absor-\nbance (Biolinx 1.0 software; Dynex Laboratories). Urinary\nhormone concentrations, assayed in duplicate, were\nadjusted by specimen specific gravity using a population\nwere statistically corrected for slight assay nonparallel-\nism using a 1:5 dilution as the standard to which all\nvalues were corrected (40).\nReproductive Stage. A reproductive stage was\nassigned to each menstrual cycle in the study using a\nfour-category scale (Table 1) derived from the Staging\nReproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) recommenda-\ntions (37). Based on the criteria of variability in cycle\nlength described in STRAW, we used the CV of\nmenstrual cycle length to assign stage.\nCycle length was calculated as the number of days\nfrom the first day of a menstrual bleed to the last day\nbefore the next bleed. A menstrual bleed was defined as a\nsegment with at least 2 days of bleeding in 6 consecutive\ndays, which had to be preceded by at least 5 consecutive\ndays of no bleeding.\nA rolling cycle length CV (the SD of cycle length\ndivided by the mean cycle length) was calculated for\neach cycle using the length of the current cycle and the\nfive previous cycles; this CV was used to assign stage to\neach cycle. When fewer than five previous cycles were\navailable, all cycle lengths observed before the current\ncycle were used.\nCutoff values for the rolling cycle length CV were\nchosen to represent reproductive stages as close as\nTable 1.

Because\nCV values of <20% represent <7 days deviation from a\n34-day cycle, we used it to indicate premenopausal\nrepresent the STRAW criterion of cycle length variance\n>7 days (stage -2). A CV >40% or the presence of a cycle\n>60 days in length was used for the STRAW criterion of\ntwo or more skipped cycles (stage -1). Postmenopause\n(stage +1) was defined as 1 year with no menstrual\nbleeding.\nCycles that were right or left censored at <60 days\nwithin a 6-month interval were assigned a stage using\nthe predominant stage (the stage occurring z60% of the\ntime within the 6-month segment) in the interval. Cycles\ncensored at z60 days in length were assigned either stage\n-1 or +1; in some censored cycles, it was not possible to\nreliably differentiate between stages -1 and +1, but this\nIntervals where the most prevalent stage occurred\n<60% of the time were coded as mixed stage. This\ndesignation was assigned to 39 of the 359 six-month\nintervals. Forty-four percent of the 39 cases included\nstages -3, -2 and -1 within an interval, 8% were cases\nof one reproductive stage and a substantial censored\nsegment, and the remainder were other combinations of\nthe stages -3, -2, and -1 and censored segments.\nQuantification of Total and Unopposed Estrogen. To\nquantify total estrogen levels, we examined mean E1G\narea under the curve (AUC). We also examined the 5th\nand 95th percentiles of E1G as indicators of baseline and\npeak levels of E1G, respectively. We assessed how these\nvaried by age and stage while controlling for BMI.\nTo quantify unopposed estrogen, we used the total\nnumber of days per cycle where PDG was at a per-cycle\nbaseline level and E1G was above a per-cycle baseline\nlevel. A daily running 5-day PDG average was used to\ncreate a daily PDG ratio (PR): the PDG of the current day\ndivided by the average PDG. A PR < 3.0 was considered\nbaseline PDG; when the PR exceeded 3.0 for at least\n3 days in a 5-day sequence (the criterion used in\novulation detection algorithms to identify a sustained\nrise in PDG; e.g., ref. 42), then all days from the first day\nthe PR exceeded 3.0 to the end of the cycle were scored\nas having sufficient progesterone to oppose estrogen. To\nidentify days where E1G was above baseline level, we\nbegan with a day of estrogen takeoff (43). All subsequent\ndays were scored as above E1G baseline until the end of\nthe cycle or a clear decline in E1G occurred. E1G data for\nmenstrual cycles were first smoothed using the function:\nsmoothed E1G = (previous day's E1G value) (0.25) +\n(current day's E1G value) (0.50) + (next day's E1G value)\n(0.25). Inactive (baseline estrogen) periods were identi-\nfied by one of us (R.J.F.) from graphs showing menstrual\nbleeds and smoothed E1G data. The end of an inactive\nperiod was indicated by a sharp and sustained increase\nin E1G and was scored as the first day of E1G above\nbaseline.\nAll days between the day of estrogen takeoff and the\nday of progesterone takeoff were designated as unop-\nposed; all other days in a cycle were designated as\nopposed. Additional criteria were needed in f20% of\ncycles. In such cases, we used a steroid ratio (SR = E1G/\nPDG) to indicate days when estrogen was elevated while\nprogesterone was at baseline (SR z 20). We developed a\nhierarchical set of rules to accommodate all possible\ncases and applied these to all cycles; the rules are\npresented in the appendix. To test implementation of the\nrules, a sample of 70 six-month segments of data was\nscored independently by two investigators (K.A.O. and\nR.J.F.). Inter-rater agreement based on the j statistic was\ndiscrepancies between raters were small and not sys-\ntematic. One investigator then assigned days of unop-\nposed estrogen to all data.\nStatistical Analyses of Total and Unopposed\nEstrogen by Age and Reproductive Stage. The unit of\nanalysis was a 6-month interval. Total estrogen was\ncalculated as the AUC for daily E1G over the interval\nmissing data, the interval was excluded. If <7 consecutive\ndays were missing, AUC was interpolated. Where >7\nconsecutive days were missing or there were missing data\nat either end, AUC was computed without that segment,\nand the final result was weighted upward to represent the\nfull 181-day span. We also used daily E1G data to\nestimate baseline (5th percentile) and peak (95th percen-\ntile) E1G levels for the 6-month intervals. The total\nnumber of days of unopposed estrogen for each interval\nwas estimated by summing the individual days of\nunopposed E1G across the interval. For intervals with\n<181 days of complete data, the sums were weighted\nupward to represent counts over 181 days.\nWe used linear mixed-effects models to assess whether\nAUC, baseline, peak, and unopposed estrogen differed\nby stage. Models had two levels: individual and within-\nindividual. Individual was considered a random effect;\nfixed effects comprised stage, age at study entry, and\nwithin-subject longitudinal aging (difference between\nage at study entry and age at beginning of 6-month\ninterval). Analyses were done on logged values of E1G.\nResults\nOne hundred fifty-six women ages 26 to 58 years\nparticipated in BIMORA. Fifty-three women participated\nTable 2.

In\ngeneral, even after adjusting for age at study entry, E1G\ntended to increase with age in stage -3 but decrease with\nage in stage -1 (Fig. 2).\nThe above findings that average EIG AUC and average\nbaseline E1G did not decline until late in the transition\n(stage -3), whereas average peak E1G did not decline\nuntil the postmenopause (stage +1), were unchanged\nwith the addition of BMI to the models.\nUnopposed Estrogen. Figure 3 shows typical exam-\nples of 6 months of E1G, PDG, and menses for\nparticipants in stage -3 (A), -2 (B), -1 (C), and +1 (D).\nIn premenopausal women, the days of unopposed\nestrogen cluster tightly in the mid to late follicular phase.\nAnovulatory cycles and prolonged periods of follicular\ndevelopment contribute to days of unopposed estrogen\nin stage -2 women. In stage -1, prolonged follicular\ngrowth and estrogen secretion, with much of it unop-\nposed by progesterone, is typical. Fig. 3D is from a\nrecently (within the 2 previous years) menopausal\nparticipant with low E1G and PDG but a clear period\nof follicular development not followed by ovulation or a\nmenses.\nTwo of the 359 intervals were excluded because\n>30 days of data could not be scored for unopposed\nestrogen. Eighty-two percent (110) of intervals in stage +1\nhad no days of unopposed estrogen, whereas other stages\nalways had days of unopposed estrogen. We therefore\nfocused analysis on the other stages, comprising 223\nintervals from 78 women. We found no differences in\nmean total days of unopposed estrogen (TDUE) among\nthese stages (P = 0.10). However, mean TDUE for stage -2\nand the mixed stage were higher than mean TDUE for\nstage -3 (Fig. 4). There was no significant difference\nbetween mean TDUE for stages -3 and -1, which may be\npartially a result of the large between- and within-subject\nvariability of TDUE in stage -1 (Fig. 5). When the\ntransitional stages (-2, mixed, and -1) were combined\ninto a single category, TDUE was higher in the transition\ncompared with stage -3 (P = 0.027; Fig. 4). In each of these\nmodels, there was significant interaction between stage\nFigure 1. Boxplot of 6-month E1G AUC\n(left), E1G 95th percentile (middle), and\nE1G 5th percentile (right) by stage.

The results were unchanged by\nthe addition of BMI to the models.\nDiscussion\nOur results show that reproductive stage, as assessed by\na running CV of menstrual cycle length, is an important\ncorrelate of a woman's total E1G: women of the same age\ncan have quite different E1G profiles if they are in\ndifferent stages. In previous work, we showed that E1G\nincreased with age until the mid to late 40s (36); here, we\nshow that this trend is characteristic of stage -3 and that\nE1G decline with age is typical in stage -1 (Fig. 2). Total\nE1G levels as assessed by AUC were similar and at their\nhighest in -3, -2, and mixed stages; they did not decline\nuntil the late transition, stage -1 (Fig. 1). The low E1G\nlevels in stage -1 are largely attributable to long periods\nof no ovarian activity in the longer cycles characteristic\nof this stage (43). Peak E1G levels did not decline until\nthe postmenopause (stage +1); baseline E1G levels\ndeclined across each stage from -3 or -2 to the mixed\nstage, to the -1 stage, and still further to stage +1 (Fig. 1).\nOther studies have examined estrogen indicators by\nreproductive stage but used different stage definitions or\nhormone measures, rendering comparisons difficult.\nOverall, the results of our study and others (24) suggest\nthat total and peak estrogen levels do not increase across\nFigure 3. Illustrative examples of 6 mo of\nE1G, PDG, and menses for four partic-\nipants in reproductive stages -3 (A; age\nEstrogen across the Transition to Menopause\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nthe transition to menopause, when the transition is\ndefined by cycle length variability, and do not begin to\ndecline until late in the menopausal transition. Thus, one\nwould predict that cancer risk related to total or peak\nestrogen exposure would not change with the timing of\nonset of, or be directly related to the duration of, the\nmenopausal transition. Hormone levels clearly vary by\nreproductive stage and cannot be predicted using age\nalone, so this relationship must be regarded as an\nimportant area for future research. Indeed, this was one\nof the reasons the STRAW system was developed (37).\nTotal level of estrogen is a risk factor for breast\ncancer in premenopausal (6) and postmenopausal (45,\n46) women, with higher levels associated with higher\nrisk. Similarly, long-term exposure to elevated estrogen\nis a risk factor for ovarian cancer (7, 47). Lifetime\nexposure to estrogen has long been of epidemiologic\ninterest, and late menopause is considered a major risk\nfactor for endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers (47).\nThe mechanism by which elevated or prolonged\nexposure to estrogens contribute to each of these\ncancers are not clear and may vary depending on the\nIn contrast to total and peak E1G, the number of days\nof unopposed estrogen increased during the transition to\nmenopause and remained high even when total and peak\nE1G began to decline late in the transition (Figs. 1, 4, and\n5). The number of days of unopposed estrogen exposure\ndid not decline until the postmenopause (stage +1).\nExposure to relatively high levels of unopposed estrogen\neven occurs, albeit at a greatly reduced frequency, in the\npostmenopausal years (Figs. 4 and 5). This evidence of\nfollicular development occurred in seven participants\nwho were tentatively classified as postmenopausal\nwithin the previous 1 to 2 years, and seven other\nparticipants whose last bleeds were known to have been\n2 to 8 years prior. Metcalf et al. reported similar evidence\nfor postmenopausal follicular development (48).\nOne other study (49) has characterized unopposed\nestrogen exposure in premenopausal (defined as regu-\nlarly cycling and age <40 years) and perimenopausal\n(defined as having a spontaneous break in cycle\nregularity and age >40 years) women. That study used\na ratio of estrogen to progesterone to estimate unopposed\nestrogen exposure (49). The percentage of time spent at\nwith reduced urinary PDG exposure was significantly\nhigher in perimenopausal than premenopausal women.\nUnusually long cycles (>50 days) were common in\nperimenopausal women and were associated with\nprolonged episodes of unopposed estrogen secretion.\nThe differences between the Metcalf et al. measure of\nunopposed estrogen and ours allows only a rough\ncomparison, but the findings are similar: both reveal\nthat there is significant exposure to unopposed estrogen\nduring the perimenopause and that both longer and\nshorter cycles include long periods of unopposed\nestrogen (Fig. 3B and C). To obtain more comparable\nresults, we also used a simple estrogen-to-progesterone\nratio. Our results did not change significantly (data not\nshown). We have important concerns, however, about\nthe ratio as applied to our data: interindividual variation\nin PDG and E1G levels (36) confounded the variation\nassociated with stage and age. For some women, the ratio\ndid not capture unopposed estrogen at all, because,\ncompared with other women, their PDG tended to be\nhigh relative to their E1G (data not shown). An\nadvantage of our approach is that it is independent of\nabsolute hormone levels.\nThe link between unopposed estrogen and endome-\ntrial cancer is well established (13, 50). Relatively low\nlevels of either exogenous or endogenous estrogen\ntrigger endometrial proliferation (50), with proliferation\nbeginning as early as the second day of the cycle and\ncontinuing at significant levels until mitotic prolifera-\ntion begins to decline shortly after ovulation (13). It is\nnot clear at what point there is sufficient progesterone\nsecretion to counteract the proliferative effects of\nestrogen, but the level and duration of elevated\nprogesterone could be factors influencing endometrial\ncancer (51). High levels of progesterone may be needed\nto effectively oppose high levels of estrogens (13).\nDuration of progesterone exposure may also be\nimportant; a minimum of 12 to 16 days of progestins\nin oral contraceptives is required to prevent hyperplas-\ntic endometrial response (13). Our study did not make\na distinction between high and low levels of E1G or\nPDG, nor did it measure duration of PDG elevation.\nConsequently, our approach may underestimate the\nnumber of days of unopposed estrogen. If this bias is\nimportant, and if ovulatory cycles also declined in\nfrequency across the transition, we could be missing an\noverall decline in number of days of unopposed\nestrogen from stage -3 to transitional stages. However,\neven if we corrected for this possible bias, the number\nof days of unopposed E1G would remain high across\nthe transition, especially late in the transition when\ntotal E1G declines.\nOur results suggest that the perimenopausal years are\nan important period of exposure to both unopposed and\nhigh estrogen levels. This result, coupled with the\nepidemiologic evidence on lifetime exposure to estrogen,\nsuggests that variation in the amount of time spent in the\ntransition to menopause may be an important correlate\nor risk factor for ovarian, breast, and endometrial\ncancers. To the best of our knowledge, only one study\nhas reported statistical information on the length of the\nperimenopause: McKinlay et al. give a median of\n3.8 years based on a large prospective study (12). Given\nthe findings presented here, quantifying the length of the\nperimenopause and how this may vary among women is\nan important area for future research.\nFigure 4. Boxplot of 6-month number of days of unopposed\nestrogen by stage. Box width is proportional to the number of\nintervals in each stage.\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nOur results may not be applicable to all women. Our\nsample is biased toward (a) women who chose not to\nuse either hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as they\nwent through the menopausal transition or oral contra-\nceptives to prevent pregnancy and (b) White, middle\nclass, and college educated women (36). Of particular\nconcern is whether the women who did not participate\nin all 30 months of the study were in any way different\nfrom those for whom there are no missing data. The\nmost common reason for withdrawal from our study\nwas use of HRT, but there were no significant differ-\nences in mean age between women who withdrew\nfrom the study (for HRT or other reasons) and those\nwho did not (36). There is evidence indicating that\nbreast cancer type and risk may differ between HRT\nusers and never-users (52); this suggests that cycle\nlength and/or estrogen characteristics may differ\nbetween women who did and did not choose to go\non HRT. Perimenopausal symptoms leading to HRT\nuse have been associated with reduced estrogen\nsecretion (53), which our and other data (43) show\ntends to be associated with elongated cycles. Our\nanalyses here may thus be overestimating estrogen\nexposure across the transition to menopause for some\nwomen.\nA limitation of our study is that we have only one\nmeasure of BMI, taken at the midpoint of the study, and\nthese data were available for only 90 of the 108 women in\nour analyses. We were able to impute BMI for the year\n2000 using data from previous years for the remaining\n18 women. BMI is associated with estrogen levels, and it\nis this link that is believed to explain the association\nbetween body weight and cancer risk (8, 54). Studies that\nhave examined BMI change across the transition to\nmenopause report an average annual increase in BMI of\ndid not alter the results of our analyses, our midpoint\nestimate may not be an accurate representation of BMI\nacross the study period.\nThe cycle length variance we chose as cutoffs for each\nstage could have been determined in a different\nmanner. Our goal was to operationalize the STRAW\nsystem for use with a large collection of cycle data. The\nadvantage of a CV-based approach is that it is sensitive\nto the mean. Like the method used by Lisabeth et al.\n(44), our approach replicates the spirit of the original\nSTRAW system, designed to be used by women,\nclinicians, and researchers alike. That reproductive stage\nis broadly predictive of estrogen exposure is promising\nfor future work examining how other, more nuanced,\nserial indicators of menstrual cycle length may be\nassociated with hormone levels. This study focused on\n``variability'' in menstrual cycle length as an indicator of\nreproductive status. This can be expanded to include an\nassessment of menstrual cycle length ``regularity'' using\nan indicator of serial irregularity in time-series data--\napproximate entropy. In previous work using approx-\nimate entropy with TREMIN data on cycles from\nwomen ages >40 years, we found that both increased\nvariability and greater serial regularity were significant\npredictors of the onset of menopause (17). A woman's\nlifetime history of menstrual cycle variability and\nstability may also be an important predictor of hormone\nstatus across the transition to menopause; in recent\nwork on a cohort of TREMIN women, we identified five\ncategories of women's menstrual histories based on\nvariability and stability and found that taxonomic\ncategory was associated with age at menarche, number\nof births, and age at menopause (57). For the BIMORA\nwomen, we have up to 30 years of reproductive\nhistories, which we are linking with the hormone data\nto explore how hormone levels across the transition\nmay be associated with a woman's lifetime history of\nmore stable or more erratic patterns of menstrual cycle\nlengths.\nConclusions\nWe found that (a) E1G levels increased with age in stage -\n3 women up until the mid to late 40s; (b) E1G AUC did\nnot decline significantly until later in the menopausal\ntransition (stage -1); (c) whereas baseline (5th percentile)\nE1G levels declined across the transition, peak (95th\npercentile) levels did not decline until the post-\nmenopause; and (d) the total number of days of\nunopposed estrogen exposure were higher in the\ntransition than before it and remained high until the\npostmenopause. Given the length of time women spend\nin the transition to menopause, they are exposed to more\ntotal and unopposed estrogen than has been previously\nappreciated.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nAppendix A. Scoring Cycles for Days of Unopposed\nEstrogen\nDefinitions: FD, follicular development; C, close of\ninactive phase (start of E1G secretion).\nRules:\nSummary: mark all days of SR z 20 as unopposed\nEXCEPT the standard case, where we go strictly from\n(C + 1) to (PR z 3.0-1). The standard case constitutes\nFigure 5. Trellis plot of total days of\nunopposed estrogen by age for stages -3,\n-2, -1, and mixed. Each line represents a\nsingle participant.\nEstrogen across the Transition to Menopause\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nmuch of the data, and the other captures most of the\nexceptions.\n1. Look at profile\na. If yes menopausal (no bleeds)\ni. If no evidence of FD (FD z 5 days of increase\nand decline in E1G), mark all days as opposed\nii. If yes evidence of FD\n1. If no evidence of ovulation, mark all days as\nunopposed within period of FD with SR z 20\n2. If yes evidence of ovulation, mark all days as\nunopposed from first day within period of FD\nwhere SR z 20 up to the day before the first\nPR z 3.0 where ovulation is occurring\nb. If not menopausal proceed to no. 2\n2. If not menopausal, find first day of PR z 3.0\ni. If first day PR z 3.0 is within the first 5 days\nof the cycle, ignore and find next time PR z 3.0.\nii. If there is run of PR z 3.0 (at least 3 days within\na 5-day period), it is not within the first 5 days of\nthe cycle, and it is not within a very long cycle\n(long z 40 days), this is ovulation. Mark the\nfirst day where PR z 3.0 and go to no. 3.\n1. If a run of PR z 3.0 occurs within a very long\ncycle, consult profile to identify if these are\nanomalous, anovulatory, or ovulatory. Mark\nall days to end of cycle with SR z 20 as\nunopposed.\n2. If there are multiple days scattered through\ncycle where PR z 3.0 (statistical artifact of long\ncycles with inactive phases), visually assess\nwhere ovulation is occurring and identify the\nclosestPRz 3.0 toclosetheperiod ofunopposed\nestrogen. If cycle is anovulatory (ovul2 = -1),\nmark all days up to end of cycle with SR z 20\nas unopposed.\ni. If there is only one or no days of PR z 3.0\noutside of the first 5 days of the cycle, cycle is\nanovulatory (ovul2 = -1), and SR is z20, mark\nall days from (C +1) on as unopposed as long\n1. If no C use all days where SR > 20.\n2. For right censored cases, mark to end of cycle\n3. If ovulation is present in graph but PR does\nnot pick it up, use all days where SR z 20 up to\nday before ovulation on graph.\n3. If yes C has a value, mark all days unopposed from\n(C + 1) to (PR marked day -1) regardless of SR values.\na. If C is a negative number, assign first cycle day as\nbeginning of unopposed estrogen\nb. C cannot come after PR > -3.0. Visually assess and\nuse alternative criteria (SR)\nc. Check graph re C!\ni. Left censored cycles are a place where this com-\nmonly occurs. If SR z 20, record as unopposed E.\nii. This will catch unopposed estrogen that is from\na previous cycle but is not linked to the current\ncycle's C. If SR z 20, record as unopposed E.\n4. If no C value mark all days SR z 20 as unopposed\n5. Ignore C if no hormone data for a day. Do not score\ncycle; it probably has no unopposed E days.\n6. If cycle is missing >10 days of data, with most\nmissing days consecutive, do not score.\n7. Right and left censored cycles can be scored using\nabove rules in conjunction with viewing the profile.\n8. Check graphs when scoring cycles. For cases that do\nnot fit into above, score visually and/or use SR\ncriteria.\n"
