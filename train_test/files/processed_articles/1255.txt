    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The extensive pulmonary vasculature results in the lungs being intimately exposed\nto circulating blood. As increased serum osmolality may be associated with an increase in pro-\ninflammatory activity, this has the potential to result in damage to the lungs and reduced lung\nfunction. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that increased serum\nosmolality is associated with a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced\nvital capacity (FVC).\nThe present study was a cross-sectional study of 10,602 participants in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey aged o17 yrs for whom there were adequate data on all\noutcomes and exposures.\nAfter adjustment for age, smoking and other confounding factors, increased serum osmolality\nwas inversely associated with both FEV1 and FVC. An increase of 1 SD in serum osmolality was\nassociated with a decrease in both FEV1 of 19.8 mL and FVC of 35.3 mL. The constituent assays\ndemonstrated a complex relationship with both FEV1 and FVC.\nIncreased serum osmolality was associated with decreased forced expiratory volume in one\nsecond and forced vital capacity. If causal, this may have implications for the understanding of the\nprocesses that are involved in the pathophysiology of decline in lung function.\n",

Fogarty\n KEYWORDS: Chronic obstructive lung disease, epidemiology, respiratory function tests\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) affects up to 24 million people\nin the USA, has a global prevalence of 9\u00ad\ncause of morbidity and mortality. Although\ncigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the\ndevelopment of COPD [2], ,18% of adults living\nin the USA with undiagnosed airflow obstruction\nhave never smoked cigarettes, suggesting that\nother factors contribute to the pathophysiological\nprocesses involved [3]. These include blood\nglucose level, which has been demonstrated to\nbe inversely related to forced expiratory volume\nin one second (FEV1) [4\u00ad18]. Plasma glucose is\none of the molecules that contribute towards\nserum osmolality (along with sodium, chloride\nand potassium ions, and urea). Human epithelial\ncells respond to alterations in the osmolality of\ntheir local environment by changes in transmem-\nbrane ion transport [19], which may constitute\npart of the airways' physiological response to a\nchange in the humidity or temperature of inhaled\nair. In a rat model, an increase in serum osmola-\nlity is associated with a systemic increase in pro-\ninflammatory cytokine levels [20]. The increase in\nneutrophils, eosinophils and inflammatory cyto-\nkines in induced sputum after dietary salt load-\ning in adults suggests that the pro-inflammatory\neffect of salt loading extends to the lungs in\nhumans [21], and this effect may be mediated by\nchanges in serum osmolality [20, 22]. Since COPD\nis associated with airway inflammation [23\u00ad27],\nit was hypothesised that serum osmolality is\ninversely related to lung function as measured\nby FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). This\nhypothesis was tested by examining the relation-\nship between serum osmolality and its constitu-\nent nutrients with lung function using the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) cross-sectional dataset.\nStudy population\nThe present study was conducted using data\nfrom the NHANES III, a cross-sectional survey\ndesigned to examine the health and nutrition\nof the noninstitutionalised US population.\nexamination and survey procedures have been\npublished by the National Center for Health\nStatistics [28].

Participants then\nattended sessions in a mobile examination unit in which blood\nsamples were obtained for biochemical assays. These included\nserum osmolality, and sodium, potassium, urea and plasma\nglucose concentrations. The measured serum osmolality assay\nwas an additional blood assay performed once the NHANES\ndata collection was already underway, and the present study\npopulation consists of those who were eligible to provide a\nsample for serum osmolality analysis. Height and weight\nmeasurements were obtained and used to calculate body mass\nindex (BMI). Data on lung function were collected in order to\nprovide measures of FEV1 and FVC. Spirometry was super-\nvised by technicians who had completed formal spirometry\ntraining. All participants were asked to perform at least five\nFVC manoeuvres. The FEV1 and FVC used represented the\nlargest values from the acceptable manoeuvres. For a man-\noeuvre to be acceptable, it had to be a maximal exhalation free\nof cough, excessive hesitation, leak, an obstructed mouthpiece,\nvariable effort or early termination.\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of the study population from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u00ad1994\nIncluded subjects Excluded subjects#\nSex\nSmoking status\nRace/ethnicity\nData are presented as mean\u00a1SD, n (%) or median (interquartile range).

Selection of the study population for the Third National Health and\nc\nStatistical analysis\nUsing self-reported smoking history, the participants were\nclassified into three groups: never-smokers, ex-smokers, and\ncurrent smokers. Lifetime cigarette consumption was quanti-\nfied in pack-years. The association between serum osmolality\nand lung function (FEV1 and FVC) was the primary outcome of\ninterest, and the associations between the results of the four\nassays measuring contributors to osmolality (serum sodium,\nchloride, potassium and urea and plasma glucose) and lung\nfunction were examined as secondary outcome measures. The\ndata were analysed using linear regression. The likelihood\nratio test was used to assess the presence of linear trends. As\nserum osmolality exhibited a linear relationship with lung\nfunction, it is presented as the change in FEV1 and FVC per\n16SD increment of exposure. Chloride concentration exhibited\na linear relationship with lung function, but sodium, potas-\nsium, urea and glucose concentrations did not, and hence the\nsizes of effect are presented in terms of lung function by\nquintile of exposure of interest. All analyses were adjusted for\na priori confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, BMI, sex,\nheight, smoking status and smoking history. Owing to the\nnonlinear relationship of BMI with lung function, this was\ntreated as a categorical variable. In addition, the analysis was\nrestricted to individuals with plasma glucose levels of ,7 mM\nin order to exclude the possibility that any relationship\ndemonstrated was only related to hyperglycaemia. Potential\nconfounders were investigated and included poverty index\nand serum levels of C-reactive protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, b-\ncarotene and vitamin C. They were only included in the model\nif this resulted in a change in the measure of effect of o10%.\nData were considered significant if the p-value was ,0.05.\nWhether there was any effect modification of the association\nbetween osmolality and lung function by smoking status was\ninvestigated.

Briefly, in this method,\nvarious models are explored and the two polynomial terms\nwhich best fits a nonlinear relation between FEV1 and\nosmolality are selected. However, this method does not permit\nadjustment for the complex sampling frame used to collect\ndata for the NHANES.\nRESULTS\nA total of 13,893 individuals were eligible to provide a sample\nparticipants provided complete data for analysis and so\nconstitute the study population. Reasons for exclusion are\nshown in figure 1. The present study population was similar to\nthe excluded population in terms of demographic character-\nistics (table 1). The only significant differences were that the\nstudy population was older (p50.001) and less likely to be\nfrom a non-Hispanic black population (p,0.001).\nSerum osmolality was significantly associated with a decrease\nserum osmolality.

There was no effect modification of the\nassociation between serum osmolality and either FEV1 or\nFVC by smoking status. There was no significant association\nbetween serum osmolality and the FEV1/FVC ratio (data not\npresented).\nWhen the relationship between serum osmolality and FEV1\nwas examined using fractional polynomials, it was found that\nelevated serum osmolality remained a significant predictor of\nattenuated at lower serum osmolalities, as demonstrated in\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study of a cross-sectional population of adults\nfrom the USA demonstrated that increasing serum osmolality\nis associated with decreased lung function in a generally linear\nfor FVC per 16SD increase in serum osmolality after adjusting\nfor likely confounding factors. There was a complex associa-\ntion between the individual components of osmolality and\nlung function. However, when all of the constituents were\nadjusted for, serum urea and chloride ion concentration were\npositively associated with lung function and serum sodium\nand plasma glucose concentration were negatively associated\nwith lung function.\nThe strength of the present study lies in its use of biological\nmarkers of serum osmolality and physiological measurements\nof lung function in a well-defined population, ignorant of the\nhypothesis being tested. NHANES III had a high participation\nrate, with 86 and 78% of those invited, participating in the\nquestionnaire survey and medical examination, respectively\n[28]. Complete data were available for 76% of those who were\neligible to participate. As those who provided complete data\nwere similar to those who did not, it was not considered likely\nthat selection bias would influence the present observations.\nOne limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional design,\nwhich is unable to establish causality and susceptible to\nreverse causality. It was considered unlikely that reverse\ncausality is the explanation for the association between higher\nserum osmolality and lower lung function; indeed, it would be\nanticipated that the increased ventilation associated with\nhigher lung function would lead to greater loss of water from\nthe airways and hence an increase in serum osmolality. It was\nalso not possible to exclude the possibility of residual\nconfounding from environmental exposures, such as recent\ninfection or pollution, which may impact upon both serum\nosmolality and lung function.\nTo the best of the present authors' knowledge, this is the first\nreport of an inverse association between serum osmolality and\nFEV1 and FVC, and it is important to consider the biological\nplausibility of this observation and its consistency with other\ndata. Cells lining the human airways respond to hypertonicity\nwith changes in ion transfer and membrane conductance, and\nit has been speculated that airway cells might play a role as an\nosmotic transducer, sensing and responding to changes in their\nlocal osmotic environment [19]. Evidence that increased\nextracellular osmolality is associated with pro-inflammatory\neffects is provided by studies manipulating serum osmolality\nusing salt-loading in rats, in which an increase in serum\nosmolality resulted in an increase in levels of pro-inflamma-\ntory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b, that was sustained after\nrehydration [20]. Further in vitro studies support the concept\nthat high extracellular fluid osmolality modifies neutrophil\nactivity and leukotriene production, and that this is a\nconsequence of changes in extracellular osmolality rather than\nchanges in glucose concentration [30]. Thus changes in\nosmolality have the potential to modify the activity of the\nimmune system with pro-inflammatory effects. The fact that, in\nthe present study, adjusting for levels of serum C-reactive\nprotein, a marker of systemic inflammation, did not affect the\nresults suggests that, if a rise in serum osmolality were pro-\ninflammatory, this effect might possibly be localised to the\nairways, or alternatively mediated by pathways not measured\nby C-reactive protein. The concept that pulmonary inflamma-\ntion can be mediated by changes in serum osmolality is\nconsistent with the observation that dietary salt-loading (which\nmay increase serum osmolality [22]) increased the amount of\nboth inflammatory cells and cytokines in the sputum of adults\nwith exercise-induced asthma [21]. Since COPD, a disease\ndefined by decreased lung function, is associated with airway\ninflammation [23\u00ad27], it was speculated that an increase in\nserum osmolality might play a role in the pathophysiology of\naccelerated loss of lung function, although the absence of any\neffect on the FEV1/FVC ratio suggests that this effect is\nunlikely to result in an obstructive lung defect in the absence of\nother risk factors\nThe relationships between lung function and the molecules\nthat contribute to serum osmolality are more complex.\nSerum osmolality mmol\u00b7kg-1\nFIGURE 2. Fractional polynomial model (-2, -2) of the relationship between\nserum osmolality and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with\nadjustment for age, sex, height, cigarette smoking history (in pack-yrs), smoking\nstatus, body mass index (categorical) and ethnicity (&: 95% confidence interval).\nThis may be a consequence of the fact that the individual\ncontributions of the molecules that contribute to serum\nosmolality can be difficult to quantify precisely, as demon-\nstrated by the observation that calculated osmolality varies\nfrom directly measured osmolality by up to 35% [31], or that\nthe important exposure is the total serum osmolality rather\nthan that of a single constituent molecule. The present data\nprovide a potential mechanism to account for the consistent\ninverse association between blood glucose level and lung\nfunction reported in numerous cross-sectional studies [4\u00ad18]\nsince blood glucose contributes towards total serum osmol-\nality. In order to clarify the nature of the relationship between\nosmolality and lung function, prospective studies with\nadequate information regarding potential confounding factors\nare required since cross-sectional associations identified\nbetween exposure and lung function do not necessarily\nindicate the existence of an association with decline in lung\nIn conclusion, it has been demonstrated for the first time that\nincreasing serum osmolality is associated with lower lung\nfunction. This provides a potential mechanism to explain the\npreviously observed relationship between glucose and lung\nfunction. This observation is novel and deserves further\ninvestigation.\nREFERENCES\n1 Halbert RJ, Natoli JL, Gano A, Badamgarav E, Buist AS,\nMannino DM.
