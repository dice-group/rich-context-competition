    "abstract": "Abstract\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an increasingly popular tool for the recruitment of research subjects. While\nthere has been much focus on the demographic differences between MTurk samples and the national public, we know\nlittle about whether liberals and conservatives recruited from MTurk share the same psychological dispositions as their\ncounterparts in the mass public. In the absence of such evidence, some have argued that the selection process involved\nin joining MTurk invalidates the subject pool for studying questions central to political science. In this paper, we evaluate\nthis claim by comparing a large MTurk sample to two benchmark national samples \u00ad one conducted online and one\nconducted face-to-face. We examine the personality and value-based motivations of political ideology across the three\nsamples. All three samples produce substantively identical results with only minor variation in effect sizes. In short,\nliberals and conservatives in our MTurk sample closely mirror the psychological divisions of liberals and conservatives\nin the mass public, though MTurk liberals hold more characteristically liberal values and attitudes than liberals from\nrepresentative samples. Overall, our results suggest that MTurk is a valid recruitment tool for psychological research on\npolitical ideology.\n",

Researchers have taken numerous approaches\nto validating MTurk as a sample recruitment tool.\nExperimental results have been replicated on MTurk\nacross a variety of topics, including framing effects\nmaking biases (Goodman et al., 2013; Paolacci et al.,\ntive psychology tasks (Crump et al., 2013). Others have\nshown that data from MTurk samples meet common psy-\nchometric standards (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Shapiro\net al., 2013). MTurk respondents also pay as much or\nmore attention than respondents from other populations\n(Hauser and Schwarz, forthcoming; Paolacci et al., 2010;\nYet, there are a number of concerns about the use of MTurk\nas well (e.g., Chandler et al., 2014; Krupnikov and Levine,\n2014). Much of the debate over the validity of MTurk as a\nrecruitment tool has followed the discipline's \"near obses-\nsion\" with the external validity of a sample (McDermott,\nples tend to be more politically liberal, younger, less religious,\nand less racially diverse than the U.S. population (Berinsky\nWhile scholars have documented many of the differences\nand similarities between MTurk samples and the national\npublic, some critics maintain that the sample is invalid for\npolitical research.1 According to this view, the selection pro-\ncess that produces disproportionately liberal samples implies\nAre samples drawn from Mechanical Turk\nvalid for research on political ideology?\nScott Clifford, Ryan M Jewell and Philip D Waggoner\n Keywords\nMechanical Turk, sample comparison, external validity\nUniversity of Houston, USA\nCorresponding author:\nScott Clifford, University of Houston, 447 Philip Guthrie Hoffman Hall,\nEmail: sclifford@uh.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nthat the conservatives who opt into MTurk differ from other\nconservatives in psychological dispositions central to their\nidentities. If this claim were true, it may render MTurk sam-\nples invalid for studying political and ideological divides.\nThis would be particularly worrisome for research using ide-\nology or partisanship as a moderator of experimental treat-\nNyhan and Reifler, 2010) or examining psychological differ-\nences between liberals and conservatives (e.g., Feldman and\nJohnston, 2014). Importantly, the lack of substantial system-\natic evidence for whether the selection process generates\nsamples that are valid for psychological research on ideo-\nlogical divisions in the mass public has limited this debate.\nIn this paper, we first review existing evidence on the psy-\nchological differences between respondents drawn from\nMTurk and alternative populations. We then compare psy-\nchological models of political ideology across American\nNational Election Studies (ANES) and MTurk samples. We\nfind that conservatives recruited from MTurk look nearly\nidentical to their counterparts in national samples, though\nMTurk liberals tend to have more liberal dispositions than\nANES liberals. We next model political ideology as a func-\ntion of personality and values, and find strikingly similar\nresults across samples. Overall, our findings suggest that\nresearch into the psychological dispositions behind political\nideology would reach largely the same conclusions regard-\nless of the sample chosen. Our results suggest, with some\ncaveats, that MTurk is a valid recruitment tool for psycho-\nlogical research on political ideology.\nPsychological differences between\nliberals and conservatives\nLiberals and conservatives differ in a variety of psychological\ndispositions, most notably in their personality traits and value\norientations. Decades of research has established the Big Five\npersonalitytraits\u00adOpennesstoExperience,Conscientiousness,\nExtraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability \u00ad as a\nuseful framework for understanding stable dispositions that\nunderlie individual behavior (Costa and McCrae, 1992). Two\nof the Big Five traits, in particular, are consistently strong pre-\ndictors of ideology. Liberals tend to score higher in Openness,\ndemonstrating greater interest in new information and ideas\n(Gerber et al., 2013). Conservatives tend to score higher in\nConscientiousness, demonstrating greater dependability and\nself-discipline (Gerber et al., 2013). Findings for other traits\narelessconsistent,butthereissomeevidencethatExtraversion\nis associated with conservatism (e.g., Gerber et al., 2010;\nMondak and Halperin, 2008), and thatAgreeableness predicts\nLiberals and conservatives differ even more strongly in\ntheir values. We focus on four values commonly used in\nresearch on political attitudes and identities: egalitarianism,\nmoral traditionalism, authoritarianism, and racial resent-\nment. The first three values represent the preference for equal\nopportunity, traditional family structures, and conformity\nand obedience, respectively. The fourth, racial resentment,\nrepresents a blend of racial prejudice and the values of indi-\nvidualism and self-reliance (Henry and Sears, 2002).\nPsychological characteristics of MTurk\nrespondents\nWe know that personality affects self-selection into online\npanels (Br\u00fcggen and Dholakia, 2010; Dollinger and Leong,\ndence of any selection differences between MTurk and\nother panels. Though we are not aware of any study analyz-\ning the determinants of participation on MTurk, it has been\nshown that MTurk samples tend to differ from other sam-\nples in personality and other dispositions. Compared to an\nadult community sample, MTurk workers have lower self-\nesteem, and lower levels of Extraversion, Emotional\nStability, and Openness (Goodman et al., 2013). MTurk\nsubjects also tend to score higher in Need for Cognition and\nNeed to Evaluate than national samples (Berinsky et al.,\n2012). In short, there is some evidence that MTurk samples\ndiffer from other populations on personality traits and other\npsychological dispositions.\nWe have little evidence, however, regarding how the self-\nselection process might affect political divides on MTurk.\nScherer et al. (2014) find the same partisan differences in\nSystem Justification in an MTurk sample and a nationally\nrepresentative sample. Grimmer et al. (2012) find that the\nassociations between partisanship, ideology, and feelings\ntowards Barack Obama are substantively identical across\nMTurk and nationally representative samples. However, no\nwork has systematically investigated whether liberals and\nconservatives on MTurk share the same personality traits\nand values as their counterparts in the mass public. In other\nwords, do the same values and personality traits that moti-\nvate ideological differences in other types of samples also\ndivide liberal and conservative subjects on MTurk?\nData and methods\nWe follow the logic of parallel studies (Clifford and Jerit,\npare a large sample recruited from MTurk to two national\nbenchmarks. Our benchmark data comes from the ANES\n2012 Time Series Study conducted before and after the\nrespondents for face-to-face interviews (FTF) and 3860\nrespondents for a web-based survey (Web). The FTF sam-\nple was collected using computer-assisted self-interview-\ning and relied on an address-based sampling frame. The\nWeb sample was recruited from GfK Knowledge Networks'\naddress-based sampling frame. Our MTurk survey was\nposted online in June 2015 and described as a \"Personality\nand Values Survey.\" The Human Intelligence Task's (HIT)\nClifford et al. 3\ndescription read: \"Answer short survey. Should take 8 to 10\nminutes. This project has been approved by the University\nof Houston Committee for the Protection of Human\nSubjects.\" The keywords tied to the HIT were survey,\ndemographics, politics, personality, psychology, and val-\nues. It was made available to 1500 US residents with an\nacceptance rate of at least 95%. Subjects were paid US$0.40\nfor completion.2 Demographics are shown in Table A1 in\nthe online Appendix.\nMeasures\nAll of our measures are drawn directly from the ANES, so\nwe discuss them only briefly here (see online Appendix for\nfull question wording).3 Political ideology and partisanship\nare both measured using standard seven-point scales. Social\nand economic ideology are each measured as indices of\npolicy attitudes following the approach of Feldman and\nJohnston (2014). All dependent variables are coded such\nthat higher values are more conservative.\nWe measure the Big Five personality traits using the\nTen-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al., 2003).\nMoral traditionalism, racial resentment, and egalitarianism\nare measured as the average agreement with 4\u00ad6 state-\nments. Authoritarianism is measured using the child traits\nbattery (Feldman and Stenner, 1997). Our demographic\ncontrols include age, education, gender, income, and religi-\nosity (following Feldman and Johnston, 2014).\nResults\nWe begin by graphically displaying the levels of each inde-\npendent variable across each measure of ideology. Results\nfor partisanship were substantively identical and are shown\nin the online Appendix (Figures A1\u00adA3). Figure 1 displays\nthe average level of each personality trait across self-place-\nment ideology for each sample (ANES FTF, ANES Web,\nand MTurk). The means and sample differences are shown\nin Table A2 in the online Appendix.\nStarting with the top-left panel, Extraversion is uncor-\nrelated with ideology across all samples. However, ANES\nFTF respondents are significantly more extraverted than\nboth ANES Web and MTurk samples, and MTurk subjects\nare less extraverted than the FTF sample (Cohen's d = .59)\nand the Web sample (d = .30). Cohen's d is the difference\nbetween the means of two groups divided by their pooled\nstandard deviation, which provides a measure of effect size\nrelative to the variation in the dependent variable (Cohen,\n1988). Turning to the top-right panel, Agreeableness is not\nsignificantly related to political ideology in any of the sam-\nples, nor are there large differences in means between the\nsamples. Conscientiousness is positively correlated with\nconservatism across all three samples (all ps < .01).\nEmotional Stability is positively correlated with ideology\nin all samples, but this relationship is statistically\nsignificant only in the MTurk sample (p < .01). Finally,\nOpenness is negatively correlated with ideology in all sam-\nples (all ps < .01). The MTurk sample scores notably higher\nin Openness than the Web sample (d = .39), but similar to\nthe FTF sample (d = .09). Overall, correlations between the\nBig Five traits and political ideology are substantively\nidentical across samples with the exception of Emotional\nStability. The MTurk sample is also lower in Extraversion\nthan both ANES samples.\nFigure 2 displays the mean level of each value orienta-\ntion across self-reported ideology. Authoritarianism, racial\nresentment, and moral traditionalism are positively associ-\nated with conservatism across all three samples (all ps <\n.01). While conservatives are nearly indistinguishable\nacross samples, MTurk liberals score notably lower in each\nvalue than ANES liberals. These differences may be due, in\npart, to lower levels of religiosity (see Table A3 in the\nonline Appendix). Egalitarianism is negatively correlated\nwith ideology across all samples (ps < .01), though MTurk\nliberals score slightly higher than ANES liberals. Overall,\nwe find the same relationships between values and political\nideology, and conservatives are nearly indistinguishable\nacross samples. However, we find a stronger relationship\nbetween values and political ideology in the MTurk sam-\nple, with liberals taking more characteristically liberal posi-\ntions. The stronger correlations may reflect the fact that\nMTurk respondents tend to be more politically knowledge-\nable than the nationally representative samples (Berinsky\net al., 2012), though we cannot directly test this claim.\nFigure 3 displays social and economic ideology as a\nfunction of self-reported ideology. Ideological subgroups\nare highly similar across samples, though MTurk liberals\nhave more liberal social preferences and slightly more lib-\neral economic preferences, consistent with the results\nabove.\nPsychological models of political ideology\nWe now move away from descriptive statistics and ask\nwhether researchers investigating the psychological anteced-\nents of political ideology would reach the same conclusions\nif they relied on an MTurk sample rather than anANES sam-\nple. Below we present six Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\nmodels, each predicting one of three dependent variables\n(self-reported ideology, social ideology, and economic ideol-\nogy), using one of the two sets of independent variables (per-\nsonality traits or values) and demographic controls. For\nsimilar approaches, see Gerber et al. (2010), Mondak and\nof comparison, we plot the coefficients from the models and\nexclude demographic variables (see Tables A4\u00ad7 in the\nonline Appendix for full model results).\nThe left column of Figure 4 displays the coefficients for\npersonality traits predicting self-reported ideology.

The coefficients on\nEmotional Stability are positive in all samples and similar\nin magnitude, but statistically significant only in the MTurk\nsample (p < .05). Conscientiousness is a strong predictor of\nconservatism across all samples (ps < .001). Agreeableness\nis a modest predictor of liberalism in only the Web and\nMTurk samples (ps < .001). Finally, Extraversion does not\nsignificantly predict ideology in any of the samples.\nOverall, the results are nearly identical across samples.\nThe middle-left panel of Figure 4 displays the results of a\nsimilar analysis predicting economic ideology. Openness\nsignificantly predicts liberalism in all samples (ps < .01).\nEmotional Stability is positive across all samples but only\nstatistically significant in the Web sample (p < .001).\nConscientiousness predicts conservatism in all samples\n(ps < .05). Agreeableness predicts liberalism in all samples\n(ps < .001), though this effect falls just short of statistical\nsignificance in the Web sample. Extraversion is positive in\nall samples, but only statistically significant in the Web sam-\nple. Overall, the results are again highly similar across sam-\nples, though the Web sample showed two minor deviations\nfrom the other samples.\nThe bottom-left panel of Figure 4 shows the results for\nsocial ideology. Openness significantly predicts liberalism\nfor all samples (ps < .001). Emotional Stability has a null\neffect in all samples. Conscientiousness is positive for all\nsamples, but is statistically significant only in the ANES\nsamples (ps < .01). Agreeableness significantly predicts lib-\neralism in the Web and MTurk samples (ps < .05), but is null\nin the FTF sample. Finally, Extraversion is null for all sam-\nples. Overall, there was some variation in the results across\nsamples, though theANES samples seemed to disagree with\neach other about as often as with the MTurk sample.\nWe now conduct the same three analyses using values as\nour independent variables. The top-right panel of Figure 4\ndisplays the results for self-reported ideology.\nAuthoritarianism does not significantly predict ideology in\nany of the samples. Racial resentment and moral traditional-\nism both significantly predict conservatism across all sam-\nples (ps < .001). Lastly, egalitarianism is a significant\npredictor of liberalism across all samples (ps < .001). Overall,\nthe results are substantively identical across samples.\nThe middle-right panel of Figure 4 displays the results\npredicting economic ideology.

Sample differences in values by ideology.\n6 Research and Politics \nFinally, the bottom-right panel of Figure 4 shows the\nresults predicting social ideology. Authoritarianism signifi-\ncantly predicts conservatism in both ANES samples (ps <\n.001), but is null in the MTurk sample. Racial resentment is\npositive in all samples, but only statistically significant in\nthe Web sample (p < .05). Moral traditionalism strongly\npredicts social conservatism for all samples and egalitarian-\nism predicts liberalism across all samples (ps < .001).\nOverall, the results are highly similar, with two exceptions,\nin which the Web sample and MTurk sample disagreed with\nthe other samples.\nDo coefficient estimates significantly differ\nacross samples?\nWhile the results above are highly similar across samples,\nthere were some apparent differences in effect sizes. To test\nwhether these effects are significantly different from each\nother, we estimated a series of models pooling two of the\nthree samples together at a time (e.g., Web vs. MTurk).\nEach model includes a dummy variable indicating the sam-\nple (e.g., Web = 0, MTurk = 1) and interactions between the\ndummy variable and each of our independent variables\n(excluding demographic variables). The interaction terms\nin each model indicate whether the coefficients are signifi-\ncantly different in magnitude across samples. We repeated\nthis approach for each of our four dependent variables\n(self-reported ideology, partisanship, economic ideology,\nand social ideology). Full model results are shown in Tables\nA8\u00ad14. For each of the three sample comparisons, this\namounts to 36 tests (for a total of 108), raising concerns\nabout multiple comparisons. We address this concern by\ncontrolling the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and\nBeginning with the comparison between the ANES FTF\nand Web samples as a benchmark, we find one significant dif-\nference in effect size out of 36 tests. However, after controlling\nfor the FDR, we find no significant differences. Comparing\nMTurk to the FTF sample, we find five significant differences,\nthough only one remains after controlling the FDR (authori-\ntarianism predicting social ideology). Comparing MTurk to\nthe Web, we find six significant differences, but after control-\nling the FDR, only three out of 36 remain. These three differ-\nences are in moral traditionalism predicting economic\nideology, racial resentment predicting partisanship, and\nauthoritarianism predicting social ideology. The only apparent\npattern in these few differences is that all three independent\nvariables are values endorsed more by conservatives. Overall,\nhowever, our MTurk sample generated results that are sub-\nstantively nearly identical to theANES and effect sizes that are\nindistinguishable in the vast majority of cases.\nConclusion\nWhile much research has documented the characteristics of\nMTurk workers, there has been little research on whether the\nselection process of joining MTurk results in subjects who are\npsychologically different from the general population in\nterms of the relationship between personality traits, values,\nand ideology. Our results suggest that MTurk conservatives\nshare the same personality traits and values as conservatives\ndrawn from high-quality national samples. Indeed, our con-\nservatives were largely indistinguishable across samples. The\ndifferences that we did find were largely among the liberal\nsubjects. MTurk liberals appear to hold more characteristi-\ncally liberal values and political attitudes. As for personality\ntraits, we found few differences across samples with the\nexception of Extraversion. Here, the differences were primar-\nily in the average level of the variable (rather than its relation-\nship with ideology). Whereas the FTF sample was the most\nextraverted, the MTurk sample was the least.\nFollowing the approach of recent research in political\npsychology, we also examined the psychological predictors\nof political ideology. The results were substantively nearly\nidentical across samples, indicating that a researcher would\ndraw largely the same conclusions if they chose to sample\nIndexed economic issue preferences\n(0 = Liberal - 1 = Conservative)\nEconomic Issue Preferences\nIndexed social issue preferences\n(0 = Liberal - 1 = Conservative)\nSocial Issue Preferences\nMTurk\nIdeology\nIdeology\nExtremely\nconservative\nExtremely\nliberal\nLiberal Slightly\nliberal\nModerate Slightly\nconservative\nConservative\nExtremely\nconservative\nExtremely\nliberal\nLiberal Slightly\nliberal\nModerate Slightly\nconservative\nConservative\nFigure 3.

Indeed, MTurk\neffect sizes significantly differed from the ANES in only\nfour out of 72 tests. Most of these cases involved the pre-\ndictive power of conservative values, such as moral tradi-\ntionalism. It is unclear why these variables might have\nweaker predictive power among the MTurk sample, but it\nmight indicate shifting political divisions among a younger\nand less religious population.\nOverall, our results suggest that the same values and\npersonality traits that motivate ideological differences in\nthe mass public also divide liberals and conservatives on\nMTurk. Our study thus provides evidence for the validity of\nsamples drawn from MTurk for psychological research on\nideology. While conservatives in our sample closely\nmatched nationally representative samples in personality\nand values, our liberals took on more characteristically lib-\neral attitudes and dispositions. As a result, it may be that\nexperimental treatments, such as persuasive frames, that\nare designed to target liberal values are more effective\namong MTurk liberals than among liberals drawn from a\nrepresentative sample.

MTurk subjects also\ntend to be highly attentive, reducing concerns about satisfic-\ning. However, higher levels of attention may correspond with\nlarger treatment effects or different information processing\nstyles (e.g., Chong and Druckman, 2012), which may be due\nto the common use of attention checks (Hauser and Schwarz,\n2015). The validity of MTurk as a recruitment tool will be an\nongoing and topic-specific question.\nFinally, we must note that our research does not provide\nblanket support for the use of MTurk samples for several rea-\nsons. Most obviously, our work focuses only on the relation-\nship between political ideology, values, and personality. Our\nMTurk sample was also not a random sample of the MTurk\nworkforce.As a result, we cannot be confident that our results\napply to any sample drawn from MTurk. However, samples\ndrawn from MTurk consistently diverge from the national\npopulation on several key characteristics, such as age, ideol-\nogy, and religiosity. The persistence of these findings sug-\ngests that the demographics of MTurk are fairly stable\n2013). Lastly, concerns remain about the effects of subject\n\"savviness\" or \"non-na\u00efvet\u00e9\" (Krupnikov and Levine, 2014;\nother issues (for discussion, see Goodman et al., 2013;\nShapiro et al., 2013).
