Better\nstrategies to increase the use of price transparency tools are needed. To inform such efforts, we studied who is most likely\nto use a price transparency tool. We conducted a cross-sectional study of use of the Truven Treatment Cost Calculator\namong employees at 2 large companies for the 12 months following the introduction of the tool in 2011-2012. We examined\nfrequency of sign-ons and used multivariate logistic regression to identify which demographic and health care factors were\n(1%) used it at least 3 times in the study period. Greater use of the tool was associated with younger age, living in a higher\nincome community, and having a higher deductible. Families with moderate annual out-of-pocket medical spending ($1000-\n$2779) were also more likely to use the tool. Consistent with prior work, we find use of this price transparency tool is low\nand not sustained over time.

Offering price transparency tools is\nnot associated with lower overall spending primarily because\nfew people with access to such tools use them to shop for\nlower priced providers.6-8 As such, strategies to increase use\nof price transparency tools will be an important focus of\nfuture work. To inform such efforts, we examined patient and\nmarket characteristics to describe who is most likely to use a\nprice transparency tool.\nMethods\nThe Truven Treatment Cost Calculator tool is a Web-based plat-\nform on which patients can search for personalized estimates\nof expected out-of-pocket costs for a range of services across\nproviders in their community. We studied use of this tool among\nemployees at 2 large companies.9 One company introduced the\nexamined use of the tool for the 12 months following introduc-\ntion by each employer. The employers marketed the tool to their\nemployees via communications during open enrollment includ-\ning emails and paper mailings, and used small prizes and lotter-\nies to encourage employees to sign up for the tool.\nWe obtained detailed search log data to describe each\nsearch by employees and their dependents, including the date\nof search and the service searched for. We linked these search\ndata for each family to the family's insurance claims and\nenrollment files from the year prior to the introduction of the\n1Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA\n2Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAteev Mehrotra, Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical\nEmail: Mehrotra@hcp.med.harvard.edu\nprice transparency tool using the Truven Health MarketScan\nCommercial Claims and Encounters database. We conducted\nanalyses at the family level because family members may\nshare an online account and search for services on behalf of\nother members of their family. Any family in which at least 1\nperson used the price transparency tool within the study\nperiod was categorized as a \"user.\"\nWe constructed variables to describe provider supply and\nprice variation for counties and metropolitan statistical areas\n(MSAs). First, we categorized counties with fewer than three\nhospitals as low hospital supply counties. Second, we calcu-\nlated the price variation in an MSA based on the coefficient\nof variation for the price of office visits and then categorized\nMSAs into the first (low), second (moderate), or third (high)\ntertile of price variation. For this price variation metric, we\nused CPT 99213 as a proxy for all office visits, as this CPT\ncode is the most common evaluation and management CPT\ncode used by physicians. Third, we defined a provider price\nindex for each MSA (see Online Appendix S1 for details),\nand classified MSAs into tertiles of this price index.\nWe conducted multivariate logistic regressions at the fam-\nily level to quantify the association between demographic\nand health care factors and use of the tool. The model covari-\nates were related to employee demographics (employee age,\nmedian income in their zip code, whether they had any cov-\nered dependent(s)), provider supply and price in the employ-\nee's area of residence (hospital supply, provider price\nvariation tertile, provider price index tertile), and use of med-\nical care and insurance (whether anyone in the family had a\ncomorbidity, and total medical spending and deducible level\nprior to the introduction of the price transparency tool).\nEmployees faced the same deductible in the year before and\nyear after the tool was introduced. We did not control for\nmarketing efforts in our multivariate analyses because such\nefforts affected both users and non-users. We conducted a\nsensitivity analysis where we removed total medical spend-\ning from the multivariate model and instead used an indica-\ntor for whether the family had used a \"shoppable\" health care\nservice in the prior year, as some medical spending is not\nwell suited to shopping in advance of care. We defined shop-\npable services as lab tests, imaging, outpatient procedures,\nevaluation and management services, and maternity care.\nResults\n408 families offered the price transparency\ntool across the 2 employers, 21% had a deductible less than\nthird (33%) of families were enrolled in preferred provider\norganization plans and two thirds (67%) were enrolled in\nhigh-deductible/consumer-directed health plans.\nleast once in the 12 months following its launch, and 854\n(1%) families used the tool at least 3 times in those 12 months.\nOf the families who used the tool in the first 12 months, 70%\n(5542) signed on only once. Figure 1 shows the number of\nfirst, second, and third sign-ons to the tool during the study\nperiod; each observed spike in sign-ons followed marketing\nefforts by the employers to increase the use of the tool.\nUse of the tool was more common among families with\nyounger employees, at least 1 dependent, and those living in\nareas with higher median income (Table 1). Families living\nin an MSA with greater variation in health care prices, with\nhigh deductibles, and with total medical spending greater\nthan $1000 were also more likely to use the tool. A sensitiv-\nity analysis that substituted any receipt of a shoppable ser-\nvice for total medical spending in the multivariate model\nshowed similar results (Online Appendix Table S1).\nDiscussion\nUse of this price transparency tool was relatively low and\nmost families who used the tool did so only once. These\nresults echo prior research finding that few people offered\nprice transparency tools use them6-8 and that younger people\nare more likely to use a price transparency tool.3,8 Recent\nwork found that those who used a transparency tool had\nhigher medical spending than non-users.8 Our findings high-\nlight that this is not a monotonic relationship, and that the\nhighest rate of tool use was among those with moderate\nspending. We also add to the literature by describing higher\nrates of tool use in markets with greater price variation.\nOur findings suggest several strategies for promoting\ngreater use of price transparency tools. Currently, tool use is\nhigher among groups that are more likely to have Internet\nfluency, such as younger employees and those from higher\nincome areas. Targeted marketing to groups with lower use\nrates may be important to improve access to price informa-\ntion across all groups. Our findings support the idea that mar-\nketing is effective in increasing tool use, as we observe that\nmarketing is associated with short-term spikes in the use of\nthe tool. However, more prolonged marketing efforts may be\nneeded to remind people of the tool's availability.\nIn addition to marketing, other strategies to promote sus-\ntained use of price transparency tools are necessary.Although\nour data cannot explain why most families do not continue to\nuse the tool, prior research has emphasized that improving\nthe clarity and format of information is essential to increas-\ning the use of online provider price and quality data.4,10,11\nIncreasing the salience of the tool may also be important.\nIdeally, patients should receive reminders of the availability\nof the tool at the time they are thinking about selecting a\nhealth care provider, for example, when a prior authorization\nis requested for a patient or when a patient receives an expla-\nnation of benefits.\nFamilies with the highest total medical spending were less\nlikely to use the tool than families with moderate spending.\nThose with high spending often reach their deductibles and\nmaximum out-of-pocket limits, and therefore are likely less\nprice sensitive. Different benefit designs such as reference\nGourevitch et al 3\nTable 1.

Low price, moderate price, and high price are tertiles of the price index in the sample (low price\npricing may be needed to make these higher-spenders more\nsensitive to price information.\nOur analyses have important limitations. We only observe 2\nlarge employers and we do not know what fraction of the sign-\nons to the tool represent situations where a consumer was truly\nshopping for health care services, and not merely making use\nof other features available on the tool such as learning about\ntheir benefit design. In addition, we are not able to observe\nother variables that may be associated with use of the tool, such\nas employees'out-of-pocket maximum limits, and we are miss-\ning deductible information for 10% of the sample.\nDespite widespread enthusiasm for price transparency to\nhelp patients select lower priced providers, our analysis shows\nthat the use of a price transparency tool is low, not sustained\nover time, and concentrated among consumers who are more\nprice sensitive because they have higher deductibles or live in\nareas with substantial variation in provider prices.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nstudy was supported by a grant from the Laura and John Arnold\nFoundation.\nReferences\n1. de Brantes F, Delbanco S.
