There is evidence that liquidity squeezes occasionally occur and short banks\npay more the larger is the potential for a squeeze. The price paid for liquidity is\ndecreasing in bank size and small banks are more adversely affected by an increased\npotential for a squeeze.

It is used by central banks to control short term rates and it\nunderpins the business of banking. It is also linked directly to securities markets\nthrough the role of securities as collateral in a variety of operations and transactions.\nAn illustration is offered by the ongoing financial crisis, in which the entire global\nbanking and financial system seems to have been put at risk as liquidity has been\ndrying up. Many banks have already been bailed out and, since the summer of 2007,\ncentral banks around the world have stepped in with extraordinary and emergency\ninjections of liquidity to help stabilize markets. Despite its importance, relatively\nlittle is known about the market for liquidity, especially at a disaggregated level.\nThis paper sheds light on the workings of this market by studying how much banks\nbid and pay for liquidity in 78 consecutive repo auctions by the Eurosystem in the\nliquidity systematically depends on bank characteristics and market conditions.\nSpecifically, our findings are consistent with the existence of periodically occur-\nring liquidity squeezes. A greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks is\nassociated with a rise in the price of liquidity, relative to the benchmark. Fur-\nthermore, the shorter a bank is the more adversely it is affected by an increase in\nimbalance, ceteris paribus. Since the sample period of this paper is a time of relative\nnormalcy in the interbank markets, this shows that liquidity squeezes are not just\na crisis phenomenon.\nWe also find a systematic relation between bank size and the price of liquidity.\nControlling for a variety of factors, we find that larger banks pay less than do\nsmaller banks. This effect is even more pronounced when there is an increase in\nthe imbalance of the liquidity positions. Smaller banks thus appear to be more\nvulnerable to a liquidity squeeze, ceteris paribus. This may also help explain why\nsmaller banks tend to be less short than larger banks prior to refinancing operations.\nFinally, we find that that membership in a formal relationship lending network\ndoes not reduce the price a bank pays for liquidity. German savings and cooperative\nbanks, which formally belong to these networks, do not pay less than other banks,\nwhich are not part of these networks. Cooperative banks even bid and pay more\nthan other banks. This gives rise to the notion that these formal networks may\ninduce banks to free-ride on the efforts of other banks in the network.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nEin gut funktionierender Markt f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat ist von entscheidender Bedeutung f\u00a8\nur\ndie Effizienz des gesamten Finanzsystems. Zum einen steuern Zentralbanken \u00a8\nuber\ndiesen Markt die kurzfristigen Zinsen. Zum anderen fu\u00dft das gesamte Bankgesch\u00a8\naft\nletztlich auf diesem Markt. Dar\u00a8\nuber hinaus ist der Markt f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat direkt mit\neiner Vielzahl anderer Finanzm\u00a8\narkte verkn\u00a8\nupft, da beispielsweise eine Vielzahl an\nWertpapieren als Sicherheiten an den Geldm\u00a8\narkten fungieren. Die gro\u00dfe Bedeutung\nder Geldm\u00a8\narkte wurde auch von der noch andauernden Subprime-Krise verdeutlicht,\nin deren Verlauf ein Austrocknen der Liquidit\u00a8\natsm\u00a8\narkte das weltweite Banken- und\nFinanzsystem gef\u00a8\nahrdet haben und zahlreiche Banken erst durch das Eingreifen\nder Notenbanken und Regierungen gerettet wurden. Um die Finanzm\u00a8\narkte zu be-\nruhigen, mussten Zentralbanken im Rahmen von Notfallma\u00dfnahmen in extremem\nUmfang Liquidit\u00a8\nat an den M\u00a8\narkten bereitstellen. Trotz seiner grossen Bedeutung\ngibt es bislang wenige Studien \u00a8\nuber den Geldmarkt, insbesondere auf der Ebene\neinzelner Banken. Dieses Papier beleuchtet das Funktionieren des Geldmarktes,\nindem es das Verhalten einzelner Banken am Markt analysiert. Es untersucht, wie\nviel die einzelnen deutschen Banken in den 78 aufeinanderfolgenden Repo-Auktionen\nur\nZentralbankgeld gezahlt haben. Dabei zeigt sich, dass der Preis, den eine Bank\nf\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat zahlt, systematisch von den jeweiligen Bankcharakteristika und den\nMarktgegebenheiten abh\u00a8\nangt.\nUnsere Ergebnisse deuten auf ein zeitweiliges Auftreten von Liquidit\u00a8\natsverknap-\npungen hin. Eine gr\u00a8\no\u00dfere Ungleichverteilung der Liquidit\u00a8\nat im Bankensektor geht\nmit einem h\u00a8\noheren Preis f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat einher. Dar\u00a8\nuber hinaus ist eine Bank umso\nst\u00a8\narker von einer Ungleichverteilung betroffen, je knapper sie selbst ceteris paribus\nan Liquidit\u00a8\nat ist. Da der Untersuchungszeitraum eine relativ ruhige Periode an den\nInterbankenm\u00a8\narkten umfasst, zeigt unsere Studie, dass Liquidit\u00a8\natsverknappungen\nnicht ausschlie\u00dflich ein Krisenph\u00a8\nanomen sind.\nUnsere Untersuchung deutet zudem darauf hin, dass die Zugeh\u00a8\norigkeit zu einem\nder Verbundsysteme die Zahlungsbereitschaft einer Bank f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat in den Of-\nfenmarktauktionen nicht reduziert. Weder Sparkassen noch Kreditgenossenschaften\nerhalten Liquidit\u00a8\nat am Markt g\u00a8\nunstiger als andere Banken, die keinem Verbundsys-\ntem angeh\u00a8\noren. Kreditgenossenschaften bieten und zahlen letztlich sogar einen\nh\u00a8\noheren Preis. Einerseits legt dies die Vermutung nahe, dass diese Systeme letzt-\nlich zu einem free-rider Verhalten hinsichtlich der Liquidit\u00a8\natsbereitstellung inner-\nhalb der Verb\u00a8\nunde f\u00a8\nuhren. Andererseits k\u00a8\nonnte dies aber auch bedeuten, dass\nSparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften, die an den Repo-Auktionen des Eurosys-\ntems teilnehmen, innerhalb ihrer jeweiligen Verb\u00a8\nunde rationiert werden und daher\nam Markt im Schnitt mehr f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat zahlen.\nDes Weiteren deuten unsere Ergebnisse auf einen systematischen Effekt der\nBankgr\u00a8\no\u00dfe auf den Preis der Liquidit\u00a8\natsbeschaffung hin. Unter Ber\u00a8\nucksichtigung\neiner Vielzahl anderer Faktoren zeigt sich, dass gro\u00dfe Banken weniger f\u00a8\nur Liquidit\u00a8\nat\nzahlen als kleine Banken. Dieser Effekt wirkt umso st\u00a8\narker, je ungleicher die Li-\nquidit\u00a8\nat im Bankensektor verteilt ist. Ceteris paribus scheinen kleinere Banken\ndemnach st\u00a8\narker von Liquidit\u00a8\natsverknappungen betroffen zu sein als gro\u00dfe.\nAndererseits sind kleinere Banken (vor den Offenmarktgesch\u00a8\naften des Eurosys-\ntems) relativ betrachtet weniger knapp an Liquidit\u00a8\nat als gr\u00a8\no\u00dfere Banken. Daher\nkann es letztlich sein, dass eine Krise sich f\u00a8\nur gr\u00a8\no\u00dfere Banken dennoch gravieren-\nder auswirkt als f\u00a8\nur kleinere Banken. Obwohl unsere Ergebnisse die Einsch\u00a8\natzung\nuntermauern, dass gro\u00dfe Banken einen besseren Zugang zum Interbankengeldmarkt\nhaben, ist nicht klar, in welchem Ma\u00dfe sie von einem Austrocknen des Interbanken\nbeeintr\u00a8\nachtigt werden. In Anbetracht der fortdauernden Finanzkrise ist dies offen-\nsichtlich ein wichtiger Ansatzpunkt f\u00a8\nur weiterer Forschungsarbeiten.\nContents\n2 Institutional Background and Data 7\n2.1 The Structure of the German Banking Sector . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n2.2 Minimum Reserve Requirements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n2.3 Main Refinancing Operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n2.4 Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n3.1 Definitions of Liquidity Status Variables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n3.2 Liquidity Status and Size Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n3.3 Pricing and Bidding Measures and Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4.1 Size Sorted Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n4.2 Regression Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n5.1 Explanatory Variables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n5.2 Panel Regressions without Heckman Correction . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n5.3 Panel Regressions with Heckman Correction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\nThe Price of Liquidity:\nBank Characteristics and Market Conditions\n1 Introduction\nA well functioning market for liquidity is essential for the efficiency of the broader\nfinancial markets.

The views expressed in this paper represent the authors' personal opinions and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or the European Central Bank.\n1As testified by the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Chairman of\nthe Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, before the US House Financial Services Committee,\nits importance, relatively little is known about the market for liquidity, especially\nat a disaggregated level. This paper sheds light on the workings of this market by\nstudying the price individual banks pay for liquidity and how this varies with bank\ncharacteristics and market conditions. An important finding is that the price a bank\npays for liquidity is affected by the liquidity position of other banks, as well as its\nown. This is especially significant since our sample period is taken from a time of\nrelative normalcy, well before the onset of the current crisis.\nAs for most other goods and assets, the market for liquidity consists of primary\nand secondary markets. In this paper, we study primary market prices. In particu-\nlar, we study the prices, or rates, German banks pay for liquidity in the Eurosystems'\nmain refinancing operations, which are the main source of liquidity in the euro area.\njected 84 billion euros of two-week money, against collateral. Over the crisis period,\nother central banks such as the Fed and the Bank of England have introduced similar\noperations to allow banks to obtain liquidity against an expanded set of collateral.\nThe Eurosystems' operations are organized as discriminatory auctions (pay your\nbid), which means that different banks end up paying different prices, as a function\nof their bids. Because we have all bids made by each bank over time, we can also\nstudy banks' willingness to pay. Thus, since each auction provides us with a set of\nbids and prices at one point in time, these auctions constitute a perfect setting for\nstudying the willingness to pay and the actual price paid for liquidity by different\nbanks.\nOur analysis is concerned with potential imperfections in the market for liquidity.\nThe first hypothesis we examine is that liquidity squeezes occur from time to time\nand, as a consequence, the shorter banks are relative to their liquidity needs, the\nmore they are willing to pay for liquidity, and the more they end up paying [as\nsuggested by Nyborg, Bindseil, and Strebulaev (2002)]. While there have been\nprevious studies using bidder level data from ECB operations [Nyborg et al (2002),\nto directly test this hypothesis because they lack data on banks' liquidity positions.\nUnique to this paper, we have data on individual banks' reserve positions relative\nto what they are required to hold with the central bank. We use this to construct\na measure of imbalance in the market. This is motivated by the theoretical work of\nNyborg and Strebulaev (2004) who show that an increase in the positional spread\nbetween longs and shorts gives rise to more aggressive bidding in the auction, since\nit increases the costs and benefits from a squeeze in the interbank market to shorts\nand longs, respectively. The data confirms that an increase in imbalance leads to\nmore aggressive bidding and higher prices paid for liquidity.3 We also find that the\npremium paid per unit that a bank is short is larger when the imbalance is larger.\nThese findings are consistent with the view that squeezes occur in the market for\nliquidity and that consequently there is a cost associated with relying on the markets\nto cover liquidity needs.\nOur results relate to the literature on banking and liquidity spawned by Bryant\nfunctioning of the interbank market [e.g. Bhattacharya and Gale (1987), Donald-\nliquidity shortfalls can occur as a result of banks free-riding on each other in pro-\nviding liquidity to the interbank market. In the euro zone, however, the ECB solves\nthis particular problem through its policy of adjusting the size of its operations to\nmatch the aggregate liquidity need of the entire banking system (ECB, 2002). But\nthis also means that liquidity in the euro zone is tight. If one bank has more than\n2Breitung and Nautz (2001) study ECB fixed rate tenders, which were run until June 2000. In\nthese operations, bidding banks submit quantity bids, with the rate being pre-announced by the\nECB. Hartmann, Manna, and Manzanares (2001) provide an overview of euro money markets.\n3This also bears relation to Furfine's (2000) finding that there is a link between interbank\npayment flows and the federal funds rate.\n4See Gorton and Winton (2003) for a review of the financial intermediation literature.\nit needs, another must have less. This gives rise to the possibility of short squeezes,\nand our results indicate that this indeed occurs from time to time. This has wider\nimplications. The possibility of being squeezed may, for example, reduce banks\npropensity to extend credit and thus lead to underinvestment in real assets. The\nextra cost of liquidity arising from the possibility of squeezes may also impact on\nasset prices, perhaps along the lines modelled by Allen and Gale (1994 and 2004) or\nBrunnermeier and Pedersen (2008), and contribute towards commonality in liquid-\nity across different securities and asset classes [Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Roll\nThe second broad hypothesis we examine is that the price paid for liquidity is af-\nfected by bank characteristics such as size and type. Allen, Peristiani, and Saunders\n(1989) find that there are differences in purchase behavior among differently sized\nbanks in the federal funds market [see also Furfine (1999)]. The extant literature on\nthe ECB's operations suggests that bank size affects the price of liquidity [Nyborg\npers do not control for banks' liquidity positions.5 Bank size may matter because of\neconomies of scale and scope. A larger bank may have better access to the interbank\nmarkets, for example because it has a larger network of regular counterparties or\nbecause it has a wider range of collateral. It may also be less exposed to liquidity\nshocks because it is more diversified, along the lines discussed by Kashyap, Rajan,\nand Stein (2002). A larger bank may also be willing to put more resources into\nliquidity management, since it has more to gain from a reduction in the per unit\n5Nyborg et al (2002) are the first to provide evidence suggesting that the price paid for liquidity\nin ECB operations is related to bank size. However, they use quantity demanded in the operations\nas a proxy for size rather than balance sheet data. In their analysis of size, they also do not control\nfor other bank characteristics or market conditions. Their main objective lies elsewhere. Craig and\nFecht (2007) control for other factors, including bank type, but do not benchmark the rate paid\nby banks in the operations by the contemporaneous interbank rate. Linzert et al (2007) study the\nlonger term operations.\ncost of liquidity.\nOur results confirm that size matters; large banks pay less for liquidity in the\nprimary market. The average auction has a price differential between the highest\nand lowest paying banks of 11.5 bp. Some of this is related to size. The 5% small-\nest banks pay in excess of 2 basis points (bp) more than the 1% largest banks, on\naverage across auctions. To get an idea of the relative magnitude of these numbers,\nthe average volatility of the two-week interbank rate on main refinancing operation\ndays is 5.3 bp and the average rate paid in the primary market is 1.2 bp below the\ncontemporaneous rate in the secondary market. Bank size remains highly significant\nwhen we control for a variety of other bank characteristics and market conditions,\nincluding banks' liquidity positions. Documenting that large banks indeed have a\nlower cost of liquidity is important because it points to a source of competitive ad-\nvantage to size in banking.6 We also find that bank size interacts with our imbalance\nmeasure to affect the cost of liquidity; as imbalance grows, so does the extra cost\nof liquidity to smaller banks. Thus, smaller banks appear to be more vulnerable to\nliquidity squeezes.\nThe third hypothesis we examine is that belonging to a relationship lending\nnetwork reduces the price a bank pays for liquidity. This is motivated by sugges-\ntions that such networks may help banks overcome frictions in the interbank market\n[Freixas et al (2000)]. Cocco, Gomes, and Martins (2003) find evidence that banks\ncreate such informal networks in the interbank market to hedge against adverse\nliquidity shocks. Furfine (1999) presents evidence suggesting the existence of re-\nlationships banking in the federal funds market. While we do not have data that\nallow us to identify informal bank networks, in Germany many such networks ex-\nist formally. In particular, every savings and cooperative bank belongs to formal\nnetworks of other savings and cooperative banks. Each network has its official and\n6Thus our findings may be relevant for the literature on the advantages and disadvantages to\nand Berger, Nathan, Petersen, Rajan, and Stein, (2005).\nunique head institution through which liquidity is reallocated within the network.\nIn contrast, private banks are left to their own devices. Ehrmann and Worms (2004)\nsuggest that the formal liquidity networks of savings and cooperative banks can help\nthem overcome disadvantages they may have due to being small. Thus, controlling\nfor size and other factors, we might expect savings and cooperative banks to have\nan advantage over private banks and therefore pay less for liquidity.\nHowever, we find almost the opposite. Controlling for size, liquidity position,\nimbalance, volatility, and other market conditions, cooperatives pay on average .4 bp\nmore than private banks. That savings banks do not pay less is especially surprising,\nsince they had governmental guarantees during the sample period. One would expect\nthat the resulting increase in credit quality would allow savings banks to borrow on\nsuperior terms in the interbank market. A possible reason why savings banks and\ncooperatives do not pay less for liquidity than private banks may be that their\nrespective networks do not provide good diversification with respect to liquidity\nshocks. A further explanation to our findings may involve an argument along the\nlines of Bhattacharya and Gale (1987) that formal liquidity networks are prone to\nfostering a free-riding problem with respect to liquidity management. Individual\nsavings banks and cooperatives may free-ride in particular on the liquidity provision\nof their head institution. Thus, networks ultimately fail to provide a cheaper source\nof liquidity for banks.7\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides institutional\nbackground on the German banking sector, reserve requirements, and the role of\nthe main refinancing operations. Section 2 also describes the datasets used in this\npaper. Section 3 defines various liquidity status variables and provides descriptive\nstatistics on these variables as well on the rates banks pay for liquidity, the rates\nthey bid at in the auctions, and other bidding measures.

Section 6 concludes.\n2 Institutional Background and Data\n2.1 The Structure of the German Banking Sector\nThe German banking system is traditionally a system of universal banking and has a\nthree-pillar structure. The first pillar, the private domestic commercial banks, made\nup around 40% of the entire banking sector in terms of balance sheet total by the end\nof 2000. The second pillar are the public banks. This group comprises the savings\nbanks and the savings banks' regional head institutions, the Landesbanks, which are\njointly owned by the respective state and the regional association of savings banks.\nWhile the Landesbanks account for 20% of the German banking sector in terms of\nbalance sheet total, the savings banks had around 16% of the German banking sec-\ntor's asset under management by the end of 2000. The cooperative banking sector\nwith the credit cooperatives and the cooperative central banks, which are primarily\nowned by the regional credit cooperatives, constitute the third pillar. They com-\nprised 12% of the German banking sector of which the credit cooperatives accounted\nfor 9 percentage points. Besides those major banking groups special purpose banks\n(like the Kreditanstalt f\u00a8\nur Wiederaufbau) and buildings societies (Bausparkassen)\naccount for 7% and 2% of the banking sector, respectively. Branches of foreign\nbanks operating in Germany made up 2% of the German banking sector by the end\nThis three pillar structure affects the way in which liquidity is reallocated in\nthe banking sector. The public banks as well as the cooperative banking sector\nform a relatively closed giro system. On balance, the second-tier institutions \u00ad the\nsavings banks and the credit cooperatives \u00ad typically achieve a significant liquidity\n8For a more detailed description of the German banking sector see, for example, Hackethal\nsurplus due to their retail business structure. Within the giro-systems, they pass this\nexcess liquidity on to the respective (regional) head institution. Consequently, on\novernight deposits with their respective Landesbank. At the same time only slightly\nmore than 50% of savings banks' overnight borrowing was obtained from the regional\nLandesbank. Similarly, credit cooperatives granted more than 90% of their overnight\ninterbank loans to one of the cooperative central banks, while they only received\naround 30% of their overnight interbank borrowing from the cooperative central\nbanks. Conversely, the cooperative cental banks obtained around 60% of the daily\ninterbank liabilities from credit cooperatives, while Landesbanks, however, received\nless than 30% of their overnight interbank loans from the regional savings banks.\nInstead they obtained the waste majority of their short-term interbank funds from\nforeign banks.9 Thus savings (i.e. public) and cooperative banks may have less of a\nneed to participate directly in the market for reserves than private banks.\n2.2 Minimum Reserve Requirements\nAccording to the regulation of Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central\nBank (ECB) and the national central bank of the Euro area countries, all German\ncredit institution, including subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks in Germany,\nare subject to a minimum reserve requirement. The required reserves have to be held\nas average end-of-business-day balances over the maintenance period on account\nwith the national central bank. During the sample period of this paper, reserve\nmaintenance periods had a length of one month, starting on the 24th of each month\nand ending on the following 23rd, and German banks accounted for around 30% of\ntotal reserve requirements in the euro zone.\nThe basis for the calculation of a bank's reserve requirement is its end-of-calendar-\n9For a broader discussion of the interbank linkages in the German banking sector in general\nand within the three pillars in particular see Deutsche Bundesbank (2000) and Upper and Worms\nmonth short-term liabilities,10 held by non-banks or banks outside the euro area two\nmonths before the maintenance period. For example, a bank's reserve requirements\nfor the maintenance period starting May 24th are determined by its short term lia-\nbilities on March 31. The minimum reserve requirement is 2% of these liabilities.11\nThus banks that are financed primarily with short-term liabilities are required to\nhold relatively more reserves.\nThe required reserve holdings are remunerated at the average stop-out rate of\nthe Eurosystems' main refinancing operations, during the respective maintenance\nperiod. Reserve holdings that exceed the minimum requirement are not remuner-\nated, but can be transferred to the standing deposit facility which is always 100 basis\npoints below the minimum bid rate in the auctions. The Eurosystem also operates\nwith a marginal lending facility, where banks can borrow against collateral at a rate\nwhich is 100 basis points above the minimum bid rate in the auction. Compliance\nwith reserve requirements is a hard constraint; unlike the US, these cannot be rolled\nover into the next maintenance period.12\n10More precisely, these are the overnight deposits, deposits with an agreed maturity up to two\nyears, deposits redeemable at notice up to two years, and issued debt securities with agreed ma-\nturity up to two years.\n11For a more detailed description of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system see European\n12If a bank fails to hold sufficient reserves, for example because it fails to make up a reserve\nshortfall at the marginal lending facility, the ECB can impose any of the following sanctions: It\ncan require payment of 1) up to 5 percentage points above the marginal lending rate or 2) up to\ntwo times the marginal lending rate on the difference between the required and the actually held\nreserves. Furthermore, the ECB can call for the provision of non-interest bearing deposits up to\nthree times the amount the respective bank failed to provide for. The maturity of those deposits\nmust not exceed the period during which the institution failed to meet the reserve requirement.\nThe ECB can impose additional sanctions if an institution repeatedly fails to comply with the\nreserve requirement.\n2.3 Main Refinancing Operations\nThere is a main refinancing operation (or repo auction) every week, each with a\ntenor of two weeks during the sample period.13 Thus there are up to five operations\nwithin each reserve maintenance period. Each operation is timed to coincide with\nthe maturity of funds obtained in the second-to-previous operation. The operations\nare scheduled well in advance; the intended timing of all regular operations in a year\nare announced three months before the start of the year. Typically, the operations\nare scheduled for Tuesdays, 9:30 am, with terms being announced on Mondays, 3:30\npm. Results are announced on the auction day at 11:20 am. Winning bids are settled\nthe following business day. The operations are open to all banks in the European\nMonetary Union that are subject to reserve requirements.\nIn each operation, or auction, each bidder can submit up to 10 bids which are\nrate-quantity pairs for two week money. The tick size is 1 basis point and the\nquantity multiple is 100,000 euros. There are no non-competitive bids. There is a\npre-announced minimum bid rate. This rate is determined at the meetings of the\nECB's Governing Council, normally held on the first and third Thursday of each\nmonth during the sample period. The minimum bid rate was changed six times\nduring the sample period. It started out at 4.25%, changed to 4.5% in time for\nuntil the end of the sample period.\nAt the time of the auction announcement, the ECB publishes an estimate of\nliquidity needs for the entire euro area banking sector for the following week. Given\n13Once a month, the Eurosystem also holds longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity\nof three months. We do not study these operations. See Linzert et al (2007). The ECB may also\nhold non-regular, fine-tuning operations with non-standard maturities, for example overnight, but\nnone occurred during the sample period.\nthe ECB's neutral allotment policy, this provides bidders with an unbiased estimate\nof the auction size. We refer to this liquidity neutral amount as the expected auction\nsize. Deviations may occur because of the lag between the auction announcements\n(Mondays, 3.30pm) and the allotment decision (Tuesdays, 11.20am). During this\nperiod, the ECB may have updated its forecast of the banking sector's liquidity\nneeds. Deviations from the expected auction size also occur in a few instances where\nbanks in aggregate demanded less than the liquidity neutral amount, speculating on\ndecreases in the minimum bid rate in time for the next auction in the maintenance\nperiod. However, as documented in Nyborg et al (2002), deviations tend to be very\nsmall, averaging to less than 1% of the pre-announced liquidity neutral amount.\nThus, bidders face little supply uncertainty in these auctions.\nOur analysis makes use of three data sources supplied by the Bundesbank. First,\nwe have the complete set of bids made by German registered financial institutions,\nbroken down by bidder, in all 78 ECB repo auctions (main refinancing operations) in\nperiods. The number of German bidders in an auction varies from 122 to 546.\nSecond, we have reserve data from all 2,520 German registered financial in-\nreserves with the central bank as of December 2001. The reserve data covers 842\nbidders in the main refinancing operations and 1,678 non-bidders. A bidder is de-\nfined as a bank that bids at least once and therefore appears in the auction dataset.\nThe reserve data consists of each institution's cumulative reserve holdings within\nthe maintenance period, as well as its marginal reserve holding, at the end of each\nbusiness day preceeding an auction. In addition, we have each institution's reserve\nrequirement for each maintenance period over the sample period. The reserve data\nare not available for 518 institutions that ceased operating as stand-alone entities\nduring the sample period. 17 of these submitted bids in the auctions.\nThird, we have end-of-month balance sheet data for each bank, also supplied\nby the Bundesbank. These come from bank balance sheet statistics that German\nbanks are required to report to the Bundesbank on a monthly basis. As a measure of\nsize, we thus use the book value of a bank's total assets at the end of each calendar\nmonth.\nUnique bank codes allow us to track banks over time and correlate bidding de-\ncisions with characteristics such as size and fulfillment of reserves. The complete\nules from 859 bidders. Deleting the bids from the 17 bidding banks for which we\nual demand schedules from 842 different bidders. We lack balance sheet data on\n7 bidders, taking the number of bidders for which we have complete data down to\nThe dataset is pruned further as follows: First, we exclude 45 banks that are reg-\nistered with zero reserve requirement in every maintenance period during the sample\nperiod.

The\nsecond is a bidder with an average reserve fulfillment of 3,011%. Without this bank,\nthe average fulfillment of private domestic bidding banks is 100.1%; with this bank,\nthe average is 131.8%. The next highest average reserve fulfillment among private\nThird, we exclude Bausparkassen and special purpose banks (14 institutions)14. The\nanalysis below is thus carried out on a final set of 820 bidders (and 23,673 individual\ndemand schedules) and 1,632 non-bidders.\n14These institutions have very low reserve requirements, averaging to around 0.1% of total as-\nsets. This is substantially lower than for other banking sectors, reflecting that they have different\nfunctions than typical banks. The Bausparkassen sector also includes several extreme outliers with\nrespect to reserve fulfillment.\n3 Descriptive Statistics\nThe summary statistics we present in this section break our dataset out in several\nways. First, we differentiate between bidders, i.e. those banks that submit bids\nin at least one auction, and non-bidders. Second, within these two categories, we\ndifferentiate between six different types of banks, as described above; private banks\n(domestic), savings banks, cooperatives, branches of foreign banks, Landesbanks,\nand cooperative central banks.\n3.1 Definitions of Liquidity Status Variables\nTo measure banks' liquidity status, we focus on the variables \"fulfillment\" and \"nor-\nmalized net excess reserves\", described below. These are different ways of gauging\nthe extent to which a bank is short or long reserves going into an auction.\nFulfillment is a bank's cumulative reserve holdings as a percentage of its cumu-\nlative required reserves, within a reserve maintenance period.\nfulfillmentijp\n=\ncumulative holdingijp\ncumulative required reservesijp\nwhere i refers to the bank, j to the auction, and p to the reserve maintenance\nperiod. Multiplying by 100 means that we express fulfillment as a percentage. The\nfulfillment is measured for each bank using reserve data at the close business the day\nbefore each auction. A fulfillment of 100% means that the bank has held reserves\nthus far in the maintenance period with a daily average exactly equal to the average\ndaily requirement the bank faces this period. Thus, a fulfillment of less (more) than\n100% indicates that the bank is short (long).\nTo define normalized net excess reserves, we start with the \"gross excess re-\nserves\". This compares the reserves the bank has on deposit with the central bank\nthe evening before the auction with what it needs to hold on a daily basis for the\nbalance of the reserve maintenance period in order to exactly fulfill reserve require-\nments.\ngross excess reservesijp\n= holdingijp\n- required remaining daily holdingijp\nwhere\nrequired remaining daily holdingijp\n=\nrequired total monthly reserves\nip\n- cumulative holding\nijp\ndays left of maintenance period\njp\n.\nThe \"net excess reserves\" nets out from a bank's holding the loan from two\nauctions ago that matures at the time of the current auction.\nnet excess reservesijp\n= gross excess reservesijp\n- maturing repoijp\nwhere maturing repoijp\nis the amount the bidder won in auction j - 2. Since this\namount matures at the time of auction j, the net excess reserves is what the bank\nneeds to borrow in the auction in order to be even with respect to its reserve re-\nquirements. A negative (positive) net excess reserves is indicative of the bank being\nshort (long).\nWe normalize the net excess reserves for size by dividing it by the average daily\nrequired holding:\nnormalized net excess reservesijp\n=\nnet excess reservesijp\naverage daily required reservesip\nIn a similar way, we also define the \"normalized gross excess reserves\" by dividing\nthe gross excess reserves by the average daily required reserves.\nThe normalized net excess reserves measure takes into account not only a bank's\nfulfillment thus far in the maintenance period, but also its liquidity need going for-\nward, including the need to refinance maturing repos. For this reason, this measure\nis arguably a better indicator of liquidity need than fulfillment, and we therefore\nuse it in the regression analysis. Normalization by required reserves means that the\nmeasure is independent of size, allowing us to distinguish between size and pure\nliquidity status effects. A bank that always has a fulfillment of 100% and borrows\nin every auction (borrows in no auction) will have a negative (zero) normalized net\nexcess reserves going into every auction.\n3.2 Liquidity Status and Size Statistics\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on a comprehensive set of liquidity status vari-\nables for bidding banks, broken down into the six bank categories. Table 2 does\nthe same for non-bidding banks, but in this case there are only four bank categories\nsince there are no Landesbanks or cooperative central banks that have not submit-\nted bids in the auctions over the sample period. Comparing these two tables reveals\nthat the average bidder differs substantially on two key dimensions from the average\nnon-bidder.\nFirst, category by category, bidders are larger than non-bidders by all size mea-\nsures; asset size, reserve requirements, holding of reserves, and required remaining\nreserves. For example, for bidding private banks these measures average to (in eu-\nmill (holdings of reserves on the evening prior to an operation), and 136.73 mill\n(average daily remaining required reserves). The corresponding numbers for non-\nSecond, bidders are shorter liquidity than non-bidders. For bidders, the average\nnormalized net excess reserves is negative for all bank categories; whereas it is pos-\nitive for non-bidders. So by this measure, bidders are short going into the auctions,\nwhile non-bidders are long. The average fulfillment is also smaller for bidders than\nit is for non-bidders. For example, for private banks: the average normalized net\n108.13% for non-bidders. To summarize, non-bidders are comparatively small and\nlong, while bidders are comparatively large and short.\nThe tables also show significant differences across bank categories. Focusing on\nTable 1 (bidders), we see that Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are sub-\nstantially larger than the other categories, including the private banks. Mean asset\nbanks, 678 mill for cooperatives, and 2,256 mill for branches of foreign banks. So,\non average by asset value, Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are up to 4.5\ntimes larger than private banks. At the same time, private banks are approximately\n10 times larger than savings and foreign banks, which in turn are approximately\n3 times as large as cooperatives. The smallest asset value in the sample is 25.96\nmillion (a cooperative), and the largest value is 267,591 million (a domestic private\nbank).\nMean daily reserve requirements for bidders are: 132.4 million for private banks,\n22.1 million for savings banks, 7.8 million for cooperatives, 17.1 million for foreign\nmeasure, Landesbanks and cooperative central banks are on average about 2.5 times\nlarger than private banks. Private banks are almost 6 times larger than savings\nbanks, almost 8 times larger than foreign banks, and approximately 17 times larger\nthan cooperatives. The largest average daily reserve requirement is 2,901.6 million\n(a domestic private bank). This is quite small in comparison to a typical auction\nsize of around 90 billion.\nThere are also differences in liquidity status among bidding banks. As noted\nabove, private domestic banks have a mean fulfillment of 100.25% . Savings banks\nThe mean fulfillment across foreign institutions is 142.30%. Landesbanks have the\nlowest fulfillment, 82.44%, while cooperative central banks have a fulfillment of\n99.00%. So, on average, as measured by fulfillment, German private domestic banks,\nsavings banks, and cooperatives are slightly long, while cooperative central banks\nand in particular Landesbanks are short going into the auctions. However, taking\ninto account maturing repos, all categories of banks are on average short going into\nthe auctions, as seen by the negative mean and median normalized net excess re-\nserves. Again, Landesbanks and cooperative central bank appear to be shorter on\naverage than the other bank categories. There is also substantial variation across\nindividual banks. The smallest average fulfillment among bidders is 50.85% (a pri-\nvate bank) and the largest is 685.95% (a foreign bank). The normalized net excess\n3.3 Pricing and Bidding Measures and Statistics\nTable 3 reports on various pricing and bidding characteristics, by bank type. It\nfocuses on different bank categories' willingness to pay for liquidity and how much\nthese bank categories end up paying, both in absolute terms and relatively to other\nbank categories. This table draws on all banks that bid at least once. For each\nbank, we measure the relevant variables first for each individual demand schedule\n(i.e. across the bidders' set of bids in a given auction). Then we average across\ndemand schedules for each bank to obtain a population of bank level observations,\nwhose summary statistics are reported in the table.\nTo benchmark bids and rates paid in the main refinancing operations, we follow\nNyborg et al (2002) and use the two week Eonia swap rate taken as the midpoint\nof the bid and ask from Reuters quotations at 9:15 a.m. on the auction day. Our\npricing variables are:\n\u00b7 Underpricing: This is a measure of the price paid by bidders relative to the\ncontemporaneous swap rate. It equals the swap rate less the bidder's quantity\nweighted average winning bids.15\n\u00b7 Relative underpricing: a bidder's underpricing in a given auction less the av-\nerage underpricing in that auction across bidders (in the sample).\n\u00b7 Discount: This is a measure of the willingness to pay. It equals the swap rate\nless the bidder's quantity weighted average bid rate.16\n15We call this quantity underpricing because the rate paid is typically below the contemporaneous\nswap rate (midpoint of the bid and ask).\n16We call this quantity discount because the rate bid is typically below the contemporaneous\n\u00b7 Relative discount: a bidder's discount in a given auction less the average\ndiscount in that auction across bidders.\nIn addition to the pricing variables, we also report on a number of bidding variables,\nwhich help provide a more comprehensive picture of banks' bidding decisions.\n\u00b7 Stopout deviation: the quantity-weighted standard deviation of bids around\nthe stopout rate.17 This is a measure of how well a bank predicts the stop-out\nrate and therefore affects what it pays for liquidity.\n\u00b7 Award ratio: a bidder's award in an auction as a percentage of his demand.\n\u00b7 Demand to reserve requirement: demand (summed across individual bids)\ndivided by the bank's reserve requirement (in the maintenance period where\nthe auction occurs).\n\u00b7 Award to total award: a bidder's award in an auction as a percentage of\naggregate award in that auction to financial institutions registered in Germany.\n\u00b7 Bidding frequency: percentage of auctions a bank participates in.18\n\u00b7 Number of bids: the number of interest rate-quantity pairs.\nThere are substantial differences across bank categories in the prices paid for\nliquidity, as measured by underpricing and relative underpricing. Private banks\nhave an average underpricing and relative underpricing of 1.24 bp and 0.07 bp,\nrespectively. For savings banks, the corresponding numbers are 1.66 bp and -0.01\nbp; for cooperatives they are 0.78 bp and -0.87 bp; for foreign banks they are\ncooperative central banks they are 2.82 bp and 0.51 bp. Thus Landesbanks are\nswap rate (midpoint of the bid and ask).\n17The stopout, or marginal, rate is the rate of the lowest winning bid.\n18This means that, unlike the other variables in this list, bidding frequency is not an average\nacross a bank's demand schedules in different auctions.\nthe best performers, having a relative underpricing which is 1.40 bp higher than\ncooperatives, which are the worst performers. The Landesbanks are closely followed\nby the cooperative central banks.19\nWe see very similar results when we analyze the willingness to pay for liquidity\nacross different bank categories. This is measured by discount and relative discount.\nPrivate banks have an average discount and relative discount of 3.04 bp and 0.14\nbp, respectively. For savings banks, the corresponding numbers are 3.32 bp and\ncooperative central banks they are 4.27 bp and 0.45 bp. Thus Landesbanks and\ncooperative central banks, followed by the private banks, are willing to pay less for\nliquidity than the rest of the banks.\nThe stopout deviation captures the banks' ability to correctly predict the stopout\nrate in a given auction. It is lowest for the Landesbanks, 1.04 bp, and cooperative\ncentral banks, 1.17 bp, and highest for the cooperatives, 2.80 bp. These results\nare thus consistent again with the larger relative underpricing we observe for the\nLandesbanks and cooperative central banks.\nThe award ratio measures the relative aggressiveness of a bidder. An award\nratio of 100% in a given auction means that all of a bidder's bids won, i.e. all his\nbids were above the stop-out rate. Thus the bidder can be said to have been highly\naggressive relative to other bidders. An award ratio of 0 is indicative of very cautious\nbidding. Cooperative central banks have the lowest award ratio, 42.34%, followed\nby the Landesbanks with an award ratio of 48.54%. There are only relatively small\ndifferences in award ratios across the other bank categories. The range is from\n19A caveat with respect to using the raw underpricing number, instead of the relative under-\npricing, to gauge what banks pay relative to each other is that the raw underpricing measure gives\nmore weight to the early auctions in the sample period, since these auctions had a higher partic-\nipation rate (see Nyborg et al (2002) for a discussion of the decreasing time trend in the number\nof bidders). Since interbank rates were higher around these auctions, the underpricing in these\nauctions was higher than in later auctions.\nThe award to total award varies between 0.03% (cooperatives), 0.09% (savings),\n(Landesbanks). The maximum is 11.58% (a private domestic bank). These numbers\nillustrate how small any bank in this market is compared to the market size.\nThe average demand to reserve requirement ratio goes from 249.83% (coopera-\ntives) to 1221.95% (cooperative central banks). These high averages are influenced\nby some extremely large observations. The largest single observation is 12,124.14%\n(a private bank).\nLandesbanks participate more frequently than other banks, specifically they bid\non average in 80.45% of the 78 auctions. Cooperative bidders participate in the\nfewest number of auctions, only 27.51%. As seen by comparing Tables 1 and 2\nthe cooperative sector also has the smallest participation rate, as measured by the\npercentage of banks in the sector that bid at least once. The average number of bids\nper demand schedule varies from 1.87 (foreign banks) to 3.51 (cooperative central\nbanks).\nThe univariate statistics for the pricing and bidding variables in this section do\nnot control for other important factors such as the size of a bank and auction specific\nexogenous variables. This will be addressed in the subsequent regression analysis.\n4 Cross-Sectional Analysis\nOur objective in this section is to produce a first take of some patterns that are\napparent in the data, especially with respect to the relation between a bank's size and\nthe price it pays for liquidity. The cross-sectional analysis in this section is refined in\nthe next section where we take advantage of the panel structure of the data. In the\ncurrent section, the focus is necessarily on features that are permanent or relatively\ntime invariant, i.e., bank size and type. We start by tabulating descriptive statistics\nfor different size groups, along similar lines as what we did in the previous section for\ndifferent bank types. We then present cross-sectional regressions of the price banks\npay for liquidity and their willingness to pay, as well as some other performance\nvariables, on bank size, a bank's typical liquidity position, and bank type.\n4.1 Size Sorted Groups\nWe divide the sample of bidders and non-bidders, excluding Landesbanks and coop-\nerative central banks, into two sets of 12 size groups, sorted by average asset value.\nThat is, for all bidders, we first calculate each bank's average asset value throughout\nthe sample period and place the banks into the following percentile groupings: 0 -\nfor non-bidders.\nWe report on liquidity status statistics across auctions for these groups in Table 4.\nPanel (a) reports on bidders and panel (b) on non-bidders. Focusing on bidders, the\nthe average size of banks in the 0-5th percentiles is 71.22 million. This illustrates that\nthere is a large heterogeneity in terms of size. With respect to liquidity positions,\nthe table shows that the average normalized net excess reserves is negative for all\nsize groups, with large banks being more short than small banks. For example,\nLarge banks are more short also by other measures; for example, the 99th percentile\nhas an average normalized gross excess reserves of -8.11% versus 39.00% for the\nsmallest size group, and an average fulfillment going into an auction of 94.00%\nversus 111.61% for the smallest size group. A possible reason for why large banks\ntake shorter positions is that they are involved in a greater range of business and are\nthus fundamentally better insured against adverse liquidity shocks [along the lines\ndiscussed in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002)].\nIn contrast to bidders, panel (b) shows that for all non-bidding size groups, the\ngross excess reserves is positive, illustrating again that bidders tend to be more short\nthan non-bidders.20 Paralleling the result for bidding banks, we also see that among\nnon-bidders, larger banks are also less long than smaller banks.\nTable 5 provides price and bidding statistics for the same size groups as in\nTable 4. Focusing on our measures for the relative price of liquidity, we see that these\nvary substantially among groups. Underpricing is negative for the three smallest\ngroups (up to the bottom 20 percent), and relative underpricing is negative for the\nsix smallest groups (up to the bottom 80 percent). The differences in underpricing\nand relative underpricing, respectively, between the 99th percentile and the 0-5th\npercentiles are 2.09 bp and 2.06 bp. But the best performing percentile is actually\npercentile. These differences reflect a larger willingness to pay among smaller banks,\nas revealed by their larger discount. However, the difference in discounts between\nthe largest and smallest size groups only explains approximately 1 basis point of\nthe 2 bp difference in what they pay. The extra difference appears to be due to\nlarger banks having a smaller stopout deviation; the 99th percentile group has a\nstopout deviation of 1.09 bp versus 2.78 bp for the smallest 0-5th percentile. This\nincreased precision of larger banks' bids, relative to the stopout rate, means that\nlarger banks tend to win with lower bids than smaller banks, contributing to larger\nbanks obtaining liquidity at a cheaper price. Finally, we note that the higher bids\nof small bidders is reflected in their higher award ratios, this is 65.36% for the group\nof the smallest banks but only 52.40% for those in the 97th percentile.\nThe table also reports on group level statistics; number bidders, fraction winners,\nstandard deviation of discount, and award to total award. For each group, these are\ncalculated for each auction, with the table reporting the means across the auctions.\nFrom the perspective of what banks pay for liquidity, the most interesting group\nvariable is arguably the standard deviation of discounts. This tells us how much bids\nare spread out within a group in an auction. It complements the stopout deviation.\n20Note that for non-bidders, the gross excess reserves is the identical to the net excess reserves,\nsince there is no maturing repo for these banks.\nThe group standard deviation of discounts is 1.41 bp for the 99th percentile size\ngroup versus 3.63 bp for the 0-5th percentile. Thus, in the smaller size group, we\nsee more extreme bidding, which in turn leads to smaller banks winning with larger\nbids, and thus ending up paying more.\nTo conclude, from Tables 4 and 5, we see a sharp size effect in the primary\nmarket for liquidity; large banks have shorter positions, yet are willing to pay less,\nand end up paying less, as compared with smaller banks.\n4.2 Regression Analysis\nFor each bidding bank, we consider the following dependent variables, as averages\nacross the auctions where the bank participated or won some units:21 underpricing,\nrelative underpricing, discount, relative discount, stopout deviation, award ratio,\nand demand to reserve requirements. As independent variables, we employ for each\nbank: the natural log of the bank's assets and the net normalized excess reserves,\nboth as averages over the sample period. We also include bank sector dummy\nvariables for savings, cooperatives, foreign banks, Landesbanks, and cooperative\ncentral banks, thus taking private domestic banks as the benchmark. Standard\nerrors are adjusted for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of\nvariance.\nThe results of these cross-sectional regressions are reported in Table 6. With\nrespect to bank size, the findings are consistent with those above; the price of\nliquidity decreases in bank size. The coefficient on ln(assets) in the underpricing\nregression is .2. In other words, an increase in size (in millions) by a factor of e leads\nto a .2 bp increase in underpricing. The coefficient on the normalized net excess\nreserves is positive, but insignificant. There is thus weak evidence that bidders that\nare \"more long\" have lower underpricing.\nThe regression evidence on the underpricing size effect can be compared to the\n21Underpricing and relative underpricing can only be calculated conditional on winning. The\nother dependent variables are calculated conditional on bidding.\nincrease in underpricing in the larger size groups as reported in Table 5. Going from\nthe smallest group to the 98th and 99th percentile groups represents an increase in\nthe natural log of the average asset size of approximately 5.8 and 7.2, respectively.\nAccording to the regression results, this gives an increase in underpricing from the\nrespectively. This is lower than the differences reported in Table 5 of 2.21 bp and\n2.06 bp, respectively. This reflects that the smallest group has an exceedingly poor\nperformance. Comparing the second smallest size group (6-10th percentile) to the\n98th percentile, we have an increase in ln(asset size) of approximately 5.2, which\naccording to the regression results gives an increase in underpricing 1.05 bp. This\nis in line with the numbers in Table 5, which shows a difference of 1.19 bp.\nThe regression results in Table 6 on the discount shows that this measure is not\nrelated to bank size. This is surprising given the strong relation between underpric-\ning and bank size. It is also in contrast to the results from the size sorted groups.\nA difference now, of course, is that the regression controls for liquidity positions\nand bank type. Looking at the stopout deviation regression, we see that the reason\nlarge banks end up paying less is that they cluster their bids tighter around the\nstop-out rate than do smaller banks, as can be seen from the negative coefficient on\nln(assets).\nLooking at the coefficients of the net normalized excess reserves in the seven\nregressions in Table 6, we see that we cannot conclude that banks pay more for\nliquidity, the shorter they are, contrary to what one might expect. Of course, since\na bank's liquidity position changes over time, cross-sectional regressions are not the\nappropriate way to examine the effect of liquidity positions.\n5 Panel Regressions\nThis section contains the main analysis of the paper. We start by running plain\npanel regressions on the sample of bidding banks, examining the impact on the\nkey pricing and bidding variables of a range of bank characteristics and market\nconditions. We then examine the robustness of these findings by running Heckman\nselection regressions to take into account a bank's decision to participate in a given\nauction, using bidding as well as non-bidding banks.\n5.1 Explanatory Variables\nThe explanatory variables can be divided into four categories. First, we have the\n(more or less) permanent bank characteristics, ln(assets) and bank type. Second,\nwe have liquidity condition variables, which include a temporary bank character-\nistic, normalized net excess reserves; a market condition, imbalance; and two in-\nteraction variables, imbalance\u00d7nex (nex is the normalized net excess reserves) and\nimbalance\u00d7ln(assets). Third, we have auction specific market conditions, expected\nauction size and the size ratio. Fourth, we have interbank rate variables, the swap\nspread, the negative swap spread, and volatility. These are described in more detail\nbelow (but not the bank characteristics, which are discussed in earlier sections).\nLiquidity position variables: We use our reserve position data to calculate a\nmeasure of imbalance in the market. In particular, for each operation, we define\nimbalance to be the standard deviation of the normalized net excess reserves across\nall banks, bidders and non-bidders alike. The purpose of including this variable in\nour regressions is to examine the hypothesis that liquidity is more expensive when\nthere is a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks. For each bank,\nwe interact imbalance with the normalized net excess reserves (nex), in order to\nexamine the extent to which more short banks may be more vulnerable to a greater\nimbalance in the market. Under the hypothesis that short squeezing is an issue,\nNyborg and Strebulaev (2004) show that a greater dispersion of holdings across\nbanks leads to more aggressive bidding by shorts that are subject to the possibility\nof being squeezed as well as by banks that have sufficient market power to implement\na squeeze. Given the importance of bank size, documented in the previous section,\nwe also interact imbalance with ln(assets) to examine the extent to which smaller\nbanks may have a further disadvantage in more imbalanced markets.\nOperation specific market conditions: Under the hypothesis that positions mat-\nter and that short squeezing may be a concern, we would expect that the price\nof liquidity is larger when the operation offers a poor opportunity for refinancing\nmaturing loans from the operations two weeks ago. To examine this, we define the\nsize ratio to be the expected size of the current operation as a percentage of the size\nof the operation two weeks ago, and which now needs to be refinanced. To control\nfor the absolute size of an auction, we include the expected auction size, defined as\nthe liquidity neutral amount as announced by the ECB the afternoon before the\noperation.\nInterbank rate variables: Following Nyborg et al. (2002), we define the swap\nspread as the two week Eonia swap rate at 9:15 on the auction day (see above) less\nthe minimum bid rate in the auction. We also follow these authors in calculating\nthe conditional volatility of the swap rate using a modified GARCH model, based\n20 December 2001. All these variables are shown by Nyborg et al to affect bidder\nbehavior in the ECB's main refinancing operations. The swap spread, in particular,\ncontributes to a high R2. We also define the negative swap spread as dummy variable\nwhich is 1 if the swap rate is below the minimum bid rate and zero otherwise. Nyborg\net al find that this occurs for some auctions and that it has an adverse impact on\nbidders' demand.\nSummary statistics for the market condition variables, including the two inter-\naction variables, are in Table 7. Imbalance has a mean of 1,144% and a standard\ndard deviation of approximately 10 times that. Imbalance\u00d7ln(assets) has a mean of\n7,543 and a standard deviation of around three times that. The size ratio averages\nto 1.24 and has a standard deviation of 1.75. Its minimum is .2 and its maximum\nis 15.8, illustrating that there is a substantial range in this measure. There is sub-\nstantially larger scope to refinance a repo when the current auction is 15.8 times\nlarger than the previous one as compared with when the size ratio is merely .2.\nThe expected auction size has an average of 84.256 billion euros, with a standard\ndeviation of 28.829 billion. On auction days, the swap spread has an average of 5.91\nbp, with a standard deviation of 8.66 bp. The volatility of the swap rate has an\naverage of 5.32 bp on auction days, with a standard deviation of 1.33 bp.\n5.2 Panel Regressions without Heckman Correction\nIn this subsection, we run panel regressions of underpricing, relative underpricing,\ndiscount, relative discount, stopout deviation, award ratio, and demand to reserve\nrequirement on the explanatory variables discussed above. Standard errors are ad-\njusted for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of variance and are\nclustered on the auctions.\nTable 8 reports the results. Each column represents a different regression, and\nwe discuss each in turn. The underpricing regression confirms our earlier results\nthat large banks pay less for liquidity; the coefficient on ln(size) in the underpricing\nregression is a statistically significant (at the 1% level) 0.155. Looking at the bank\ntype dummies, we see that only the cooperatives have an underpricing which is\nstatistically different from that of private banks. Controlling for all other factors,\ncooperatives pay .359 bp more for liquidity than private banks.\nWith respect to the liquidity position variables, note first that the coefficient\non the normalized net excess reserves is statistically insignificant. However, the\ncoefficient on imbalance is negative and statistically significant, meaning that the\nprice of liquidity in the primary market relative to the contemporaneous swap rate\nincreases when there is greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks. The\neffect is also economically significant, given the magnitudes that we are dealing\nwith in this market. A one standard deviation increase in imbalance leads to a\ndecrease in underpricing of approximately .4 bp. The coefficient on the interaction\nvariable imbalance\u00d7nex is positive and statistically significant. A one standard\ndeviation increase in this variable has a .04 bp effect on underpricing. This shows\nthat as imbalance increases, banks pay more for liquidity the shorter they are. The\ninteraction variable imbalance\u00d7ln(assets) is also positive and statistically significant.\nIn this case, a one standard deviation increase in the independent variable leads to\nan increase in underpricing of approximately .1 bp. In other words, as imbalance\nincreases, large banks suffer less than small banks, in terms of the price they pay\nfor liquidity.\nTurning now to the operation specific market condition variables, the coefficients\non the size ratio and the expected size are .097 and .030, respectively, both significant\nat the 1% level. So as the auction size grows, the price paid for liquidity falls. The\npositive coefficient on expected size may reflect that increasingly expensive collateral\nhas to be used as the auction size grows, as suggested by Nyborg et al (2002).\nThe positive size ratio coefficient tells us that the price of liquidity gets relatively\nmore expensive when the scope for refinancing falls. This illustrates that aggregate\npositions matter.\nFinally, the interbank rate variables follow the results previously documented\nby Nyborg et al (2002). Underpricing increases in the swap spread and decreases\nin volatility. The negative swap spread dummy variable obviously has a negative\ncoefficient, since bids below the minimum bid rate are not admissible.\nThe relative underpricing regression is similar, except that most of the market\ncondition variables are now insignificant, as one would expect. The coefficient on im-\nbalance and the two interaction variables, however, are still statistically significant.\nThe negative coefficient on imbalance is interesting. It means that the distribution\nof the price paid for liquidity across banks in an operation is skewed towards higher\nrates. This is consistent with the view that a larger imbalance leads to a larger\nchance of a liquidity squeeze.\nThe discount regression is also in line with the underpricing regression, but with\nsome notable exceptions. First, paralleling the cross-sectional regressions, we see\nthat ln(assets) is not significantly different from zero. Second, the normalized net\nexcess reserves is now significant at the 1% level. Specifically, the coefficient is\n2.4 \u00d7 10-4, showing that the shorter a banks is the smaller is the discount. This is\nequivalent to saying that a one standard deviation (for private banks) decrease in the\nnormalized net excess reserve, leads to increase in the relative willingness to pay by\napproximately .1 bp. The interaction variable imbalance\u00d7nex is not different from\nzero, in contrast to the underpricing. Savings banks have a lower discount, and thus\na higher willingness to pay, than private banks, yet do not end up paying more. Most\nof these differences seem to be explained by the stopout deviation regression. For\nexample, savings banks have a significantly smaller stopout deviation than private\nbanks. So even though they have lower discounts, they do not end up paying more.\nThe award ratio regression shows that this variable tends to decrease in bank size\nand the normalized net excess reserve. In other words, smaller and shorter banks\nare relatively more aggressive within an auction than large and less short banks.\nThe coefficients on the two interaction variables, show that as imbalance increases,\na bank's aggressiveness in the auction gets relatively smaller the longer and larger\nit is. This supports the evidence from the underpricing regression that smaller\nand shorter banks are more vulnerable to liquidity squeezes, given that imbalance\nmeasures the potential for a squeeze.\nThe demand to reserves requirements regression shows that a bank's total de-\nmand relative to its reserves is decreasing in the normalized net excess reserves, i.e.,\nbanks demand relatively more the shorter they are.\nTo summarize, the panel regressions confirm the finding from our cross-sectional\nanalysis that banks pay more for liquidity the smaller they are. In addition, the\npanel regressions show that liquidity positions affect the price paid for liquidity and\nthe willingness to pay. But it is not just a bank's own position that matters; it is\nespecially how liquidity is distributed across banks. The more imbalance there is,\nthe more are banks willing to pay and the more do they end up paying, especially\nthe shorter and smaller they are.\n5.3 Panel Regressions with Heckman Correction\nThe Heckman selection model combines a selection mechanism for participating in\nthe main refinancing operation with a regression model. Indexing banks by i and\noperations by j, the selection equation is\nz\nij\n=  wij\n+ \u00b5ij\nThe regression model is\nyij\n=  xij\n+ ij\nwhere (\u00b5ij\n, ij\n) are assumed to be bivariate normal [0, 0, 1,  , ].\nz\nij\nis not observed; the variable is observed as zij\nij\nwith probabilities Prob(zij\n= 1) = ( wij\n) and Prob(zij\n). zi\n=\n1 indicates that the bank participates and  is the standardized normal cumulative\ndistribution function.\nIn the selected sample,\nE[yij\n|zij\n= 1] =  xij\n+  ( wij\nThe model is estimated by maximum likelihood, see Greene (2000), which pro-\nvides consistent, asymptotically efficient parameter estimates. Standard errors are\nadjusted for heteroscedasticity by using the Huber/White estimate of variance and\nare clustered at the auction level.\nThe set of explanatory variables, x, in the regression model are the same as in\nthe panel regressions in the previous subsection. In the selection equation, we use\ntwo additional variables, namely maturing repo and last auction. Maturing repo is\n1 if the bank won some units two operations ago, and last auction is the aggregate\nunderpricing in the previous main refinancing operation. We expect that a bank is\nmore likely to participate if it has to refinance (maturing repo is 1). The results are\nvirtually the same with or without the variable last auction.\nThe Heckman model is run on the full dataset, including bidding banks and\nnon-bidding banks. Results are in Table 9. Panel (a) presents the regression model,\npanel (b) the selection model, and panel (c) provides statistics on the parameters.\nComparing panel (a) to the plain panel regression in Table 8, we see very few notable\ndifferences. The variables that were significant remain so, though sometimes with\naltered p-levels, and the coefficients are very close to what they were before. Out-\nside of the demand to reserves requirement regression, the only exception appears\nto be ln(assets) in the relative discount regression, which loses significance. New\nvariables do not become significant in any of the regressions. The conclusions from\nthe previous subsection remain intact.\nIn panel (b), we see that the selection equation is virtually the same for the\ndifferent independent variables. This illustrates its robustness. We note that in-\ncreased bank size is associated with a larger likelihood to participate, as is being a\nsavings bank. Cooperatives and foreign banks are less likely to participate. With\nrespect to liquidity status, we see that a larger imbalance is associated with a larger\nparticipation rate, consistent with the interpretation that this variable is associated\nwith squeezes; the more likely a squeeze is, the more important it is to participate\nin order to cover one's short position, or possibly being able to squeeze. A bank is\nalso more likely to participate when the size ratio is large. This is not surprising,\nsince a larger relative auction size is indicative of an increased need for liquidity in\nthe banking system. Banks are also more likely to participate when the swap spread\nis large, perhaps because this is associated with larger underpricing. A negative\nswap spread is, not surprisingly, associated with less participation. An increase in\nvolatility and expected auction size are both associated with an increased likelihood\nof bidding. The positive coefficients on maturing repo and last auction confirm that\nbanks are more likely to participate if they have a refinancing need and also when\nthe previous auction was highly underpriced.\nPanel c reports the different parameters for the Heckman estimation, i.e. , ,\nand . The results suggest that these parameters are significant for each of the\nestimations, except for the underpricing estimation. In particular, the correlation of\nthe residuals in the bidding and performance model and the selection model, which\nis captured by , is significant at the 5% level. This suggests that it is important\nto use the Heckman approach to take into account the decision whether to submit\na bid for the analysis of how bidders submit their bids. Nevertheless, as we have\nseen, the results from the Heckman panel regression are virtually the same as in the\nplain panel regression.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper documents that the price of liquidity systematically depends on bank\ncharacteristics and market conditions. We specifically test three hypotheses, which\nare derived from economic theory, and find the following results. First, our findings\nare consistent with the existence of periodically occurring liquidity squeezes. A\ngreater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks is associated with a rise in\nthe price of liquidity, relative to the benchmark, as predicted by the theoretical\nwork by Nyborg and Strebulaev (2004). Furthermore, the shorter a bank is the\nmore adversely it is affected by an increase in imbalance, ceteris paribus. Since the\nsample period of this paper is a time of relative normalcy in the interbank markets,\nthis shows that liquidity squeezes are not just a crisis phenomenon.\nSecond, we document a systematic relation between bank size and the price of\nliquidity. Controlling for a variety of factors, we find that larger banks pay less than\ndo smaller banks. This effect is even more pronounced when there is an increase\nin the imbalance of the liquidity positions. Smaller banks thus appear to be more\nvulnerable to a liquidity squeeze, ceteris paribus. This may also help explain why\nsmaller banks tend to be relatively less short than larger banks prior to refinancing\noperations.\nThird, we find that membership in a formal relationship lending network does\nnot reduce the price a bank pays for liquidity. German savings and cooperative\nbanks, which formally belong to these networks, do not pay less than other banks,\nwhich are not part of these networks. Cooperative banks even bid and pay more\nthan other banks. This gives rise to the notion that these formal networks may\ninduce banks to free-ride on the efforts of other banks in the network (as discussed\nin the Introduction). An alternative view is that cooperatives and savings banks\nthat participate in the main refinancing operations do so because they experience\nrationing by their respective networks. This may carry stigma in the interbank\nmarket, giving them an increased willingness to pay in open market operations.\nThere are several ways this line of research can be broadened. For example,\na pertinent question is whether banks with poor collateral or low quality balance\nsheets are more exposed to adverse liquidity conditions and therefore bid and pay\nmore in the primary market. That underpricing in the main refinancing operations\nis increasing in the size of the operation is consistent with the view that different col-\nlateral have different opportunity costs. Data on individual bank collateral holdings,\nhowever, is very hard to obtain.\nAnother important issue is how the effects we have uncovered would play out\nduring a crisis period. For example, that small banks are more adversely affected by\nincreases in the liquidity imbalance in the banking sector, ceteris paribus, suggests\nthat small banks would be more vulnerable in a crisis. On the other hand, since\nsmall banks tend to be less short than large banks, it is possible that the net effect\nof a crisis may be worse for large banks than small ones. Thus, while our findings\nare consistent with the view that large banks have better access to the interbank\nmarket for liquidity than smaller banks, it is not clear how they would fare if this\nmarket would seize up.\nFinally, our finding that there are imperfections in the market for liquidity even\nduring times of normalcy leaves us with the hypothesis that the current crisis rep-\nresents a flaring up of these imperfections. This is an important issue to settle for\nfuture research.\nReferences\nAllen, Linda, Stavros Peristiani, and Anthony Saunders, 1989, Bank Size, Collat-\neral, and Net Purchase Behavior in the Federal Funds market: Empirical Evidence,\nAllen, Franklin, and Douglas Gale, 1994, Limited Market Participation and Volatil-\nAllen, Franklin, and Douglas Gale, 2000, Financial Contagion, Journal of Political\nAllen, Franklin, and Douglas Gale, 2004, Financial Intermediaries and Markets,\nBhattacharya, Sudipto, and Paolo Fulghieri, 1994, Uncertain Liquidity and Inter-\nBhattacharya, Sudipto, and Douglas Gale, 1987, \"Preference Shocks, Liquidity and\nCentral Bank Policy,\" in W.Barnett, and K.

However,\nour final specification has a somewhat better fit in the period we are studying as\ncompared to their's.\nTable 10: Conditional Volatility of Swap Rate\nThis table reports the results of the conditional volatility estimation of the two-week\nswap rate, using a modified GARCH(1,1) model.
