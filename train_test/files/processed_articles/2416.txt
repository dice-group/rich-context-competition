Community-associated (CA) MRSA strains primarily\ncause skin and soft tissue infections, but may also cause life-threatening invasive infections. First seen in Australia\nand the U.S., it is a growing problem around the world. The U.S. has had the most widespread CA-MRSA epidemic,\nwith strain type USA300 causing the great majority of infections. Individuals with either asymptomatic colonization\nor infection may transmit CA-MRSA to others, largely by skin-to-skin contact. Control measures have focused on\nhospital transmission. Limited public health education has focused on care for skin infections.\nMethods: We developed a fine-grained agent-based model for Chicago to identify where to target interventions to\nreduce CA-MRSA transmission. An agent-based model allows us to represent heterogeneity in population behavior,\nlocations and contact patterns that are highly relevant for CA-MRSA transmission and control. Drawing on nationally\nrepresentative survey data, the model represents variation in sociodemographics, locations, behaviors, and physical\ncontact patterns. Transmission probabilities are based on a comprehensive literature review.\nResults: Over multiple 10-year runs with one-hour ticks, our model generates temporal and geographic trends in\nCA-MRSA incidence similar to Chicago from 2001 to 2010. On average, a majority of transmission events occurred\nin households, and colonized rather than infected agents were the source of the great majority (over 95%) of\ntransmission events. The key findings are that infected people are not the primary source of spread. Rather, the far\ngreater number of colonized individuals must be targeted to reduce transmission.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that current paradigms in MRSA control in the United States cannot be very\neffective in reducing the incidence of CA-MRSA infections. Furthermore, the control measures that have focused\non hospitals are unlikely to have much population-wide impact on CA-MRSA rates. New strategies need to be\ndeveloped, as the incidence of CA-MRSA is likely to continue to grow around the world.\n",

It is generally a commensal organ-\nism, and it is estimated that 25-40% of the population\nare colonized in the nasopharynx at any given time.\nWhile colonization is asymptomatic, colonized individ-\nuals may develop an active infection [1]. Colonization\nmay be of short or long duration, and often clears with-\nout causing an infection. Transmission is believed to be\nlargely via skin-to-skin contact with either a colonized\nor infected individual. New S. aureus isolates resistant to\n-lactam antibiotics were identified in the 1960s among\nhospitalized patients [2,3]. Called methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA), these isolates rapidly be-\ncame an important cause of nosocomial infections, par-\nticularly among patients with procedures or devices that\npierce the skin. These are referred to as \"health care-\nassociated\" MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains [4].\nMRSA epidemiology changed in the 1990s in many\ncountries when new MRSA strain types that were genetic-\nally distinct from HA-MRSA were diagnosed among indi-\nviduals in the community who did not have healthcare\nexposures. The transmissibility and types of HA-MRSA\nand community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infection\ndiffer [5]. The problem of CA-MRSA has been particularly\nsevere in the United States, where incidence increased ex-\nponentially in the early 2000s [6]. In the United States,\nearly reports of CA-MRSA infections came from inner\ncity populations [7], and outbreaks were reported among\nmembers of contact sports teams, jail detainees, and army\npersonnel, all in places where people interact in close\nquarters [8]. By 2004, one of the CA-MRSA strain types,\nUSA300, became the most frequent cause of skin and soft\ntissue infections seen in U.S. emergency departments [9].\nWhile uncomplicated skin infections are the most com-\nmon manifestation, CA-MRSA infections may be invasive\nand even fatal.\nPublic concern about MRSA increased when the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that\nin 2005 there were more deaths from invasive MRSA infec-\ntions than from HIV-AIDS in the U.S. [10]. While infec-\ntions from HA-MRSA strains rarely occur outside of\nthe healthcare setting, infections caused by CA-MRSA\nstrain types have become common in hospitals in the\nU.S. [8]. Invasive MRSA deaths are caused by both HA-\nMRSA and CA-MRSA strain types. Since 2001, several\nstates enacted laws designed to slow the dissemination of\nMRSA, all focused on healthcare settings (Committee to\nReduce Infection Deaths. State Legislation & Initiatives\non Healthcare-Associated Infections. http://www.hospital\ninfection.org/legislation.shtml). The other public health\nresponse in the U.S. has been educational, such as public\nservice announcements to raise public awareness of\nMRSA infections and to encourage the use of preventive\nmeasures such as the covering of skin lesions to reduce\ntransmission (STOP MRSA Now. http://www.stopmrsa\nnow.org/public-service-announcement.html). There are\nno major public or private efforts aimed at controlling the\nspread of MRSA colonization in the community from per-\nson to person in the absence of infection.\nEpidemiologic studies can be used to estimate the inci-\ndence and risk factors for CA-MRSA infections, or the\nprevalence of colonization. However, it is difficult to per-\nform a study that examines the actual transmission dynam-\nics of asymptomatic MRSA colonization in any population.\nThis paper describes the structure and results of a new,\nfine-grained agent-based model of CA-MRSA transmission\ndynamics and infection in Chicago aimed at augmenting\nthe value of existing epidemiological data and evaluating\ncurrent public policies related to MRSA. Computational\nmodels have become valuable tools in understanding infec-\ntious disease dynamics, including assessments of the po-\ntential impact of public health interventions such as\nisolation, school closures or vaccines. While there have\nbeen small-scale models of HA-MRSA within hospitals\nand other resident healthcare facilities [11-18] and exami-\nnations of multiple interacting hospitals [19-21], attempts\nto model MRSA in the community have been limited\n[22,23]. Our model represents the spread of CA-MRSA in\nthe population of Chicago, for which we have estimates of\ntemporal and geographic trends based on clinical data\nWe used the model to determine the types of places in\nChicago most important for the transmission of CA-\nMRSA, examining places such as households, the County\njail, hospitals, and schools, and the relative contributions\nof the colonized and infected states to transmission.\nMethods\nThe baseline data for the model is a synthetic population\ndeveloped by Wheaton and others [24] derived from com-\nbined U.S. Census files. The sociodemographic attributes\nof the synthetic population match that of the enumerated\npopulation in the 2000 Census for Chicago. Each agent\nresides in a household and has sociodemographic charac-\nteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender, educational at-\ntainment, income). Every place in the model, including\nhouseholds, schools, hospitals and workplaces, has geo-\ngraphic coordinates (Figure 1). About three million indi-\nvidual agents move to and from 1.2 million places on an\nhourly basis over a period of up to 10 years. Places are\ncategorized as having different levels of physical contact,\nbecause MRSA is transmitted primarily by direct skin-to-\nskin contact. The risk of transmission to or from an agent\ndepends on the disease status (uncolonized, colonized or\ninfected) of other agents co-located at the same time in\nthe same place and on the overall level of physical contact\nthat occurs in that type of place.\nAgent activities and contacts\nCA-MRSA presents challenges for computational epidemi-\nologic modeling that differ from more commonly modeled\ndiseases that spread in the community, such as influenza,\nbecause MRSA has a colonized state. Modeling CA-MRSA\nalso means representing individuals' behaviors related to\nFigure 1 Places included in Chicago MRSA agent-based model.\ndisease transmission and response to infection. The kinds\nof places that need to be represented in the model also dif-\nfer from other diseases. Early outbreaks in urban jails\npointed toward jails [25-27] as potentially playing a key\nrole in transmission, necessitating their inclusion in a\npopulation-based model.\nWe combine several publicly available national data\nsources to model activities of the synthetic agent popula-\ntion. Each agent has a daily activity profile that determines\nwhat times throughout the day he or she occupies each lo-\ncation. Social contact between agents occurs when mul-\ntiple agents occupy the same location at the same time.\nThe synthetic population assigns agents to households,\nworkplaces and schools (for those of school age) [24]. Be-\ncause daycare centers are not represented in the synthetic\npopulation, we generated pseudo-daycare centers at the\nsame geographical locations as the schools in the model\nand assigned each agent attending daycare to the closest\none. Since daycare children do not collocate in the same\nclassrooms as the school children, the exact locations of\nthe daycare centers do not affect the final results, as long\nas they are in the neighborhoods of the children who at-\ntend. Each household is randomly assigned three other\nhouseholds for potential visits from the same census block\ngroup and one household from elsewhere in the city, and\none of these four households is randomly selected when-\never an agent has an activity in another household (e.g.,\nbabysitting or socializing). Hospitals and gyms are in the\nsynthetic population because they are workplaces, but we\nassign agents to them for athletic activities and hospitali-\nzations, using the geographically closest one. Finally, the\nmodel includes a jail corresponding to the Cook County\nJail (one of the largest jails in the U. S.).\nActivity profiles are empirically based on 24-hour time\ndiaries collected as part of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis-\ntics' annual American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for indi-\nviduals aged 15 years and older and from the Panel Study\nof Income Dynamics (PSID) for children younger than\n15 years. Both are nationally representative samples and\ncollected diary data on randomly assigned days. The diary\nrecords each activity during the 24-hour period (start/stop\ntimes, location and others present). We simplify the data,\nfocusing on features of greatest relevance for MRSA trans-\nmission. Each place/activity is categorized according to (1)\nthe likelihood of physical contact that would increase\ntransmission probability, and (2) the likelihood of injuries,\ncuts and abrasions that would increase the probability of\ntransition from the colonized to the infected state. Ath-\nletic activities, for example, are considered high risk for\nboth (1) and (2), regardless of where they occur.\nTwo profiles (one weekday and one weekend) from re-\nspondents living in metropolitan areas are assigned to\neach agent in the model. This is done by randomly\nmatching each agent with an ATUS or PSID respondent\nwho is either identical or similar with respect to sociode-\nmographic characteristics. While these profiles are cur-\nrently used for the entire model run, it would be\nstraightforward to incorporate variation in activity pro-\nfiles or other within-agent changes in profiles that re-\nspond to disease or other events.\nDays spent in hospitals or jail are both relevant for MRSA\ntransmission but are not included in the time diaries, which\nexclude institutionalized individuals. To assign hospital\nstays to agents, we use data on hospital nights per year\nfrom the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),\nmatched to agents by sociodemographics. Five matches are\nmade per agent to be used in successive years, and these\nare repeated for ten-year model runs. Hospitalization tim-\ning is random throughout the year. For risk of being\ndetained in jail, we generate a yearly probability for each\nagent so that the total number of admissions and their dis-\ntribution by gender, age, race and zip code matches data\nfrom the 2006 National Jail Survey (for Chicago) and the\nArrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program as\nclosely as possible. Agents are placed in jail up to once per\nyear according to this probability, with a length of stay\ndrawn randomly from the actual distribution at the Cook\nCounty Jail.\nRather than using a mathematically generated contact\nnetwork, the contact network is an emergent characteris-\ntic of this model, driven by geography and co-\nparticipation in activities [28]. Within each physical loca-\ntion, random mixing is assumed to occur among all\npresent with one exception. Within schools and daycare\ncenters, children are assigned to compartments of size 30\nas a proxy for grade or group, so that their contacts are\nlimited to other children in the same classroom. Each\nhour, four children in the same compartment are ran-\ndomly selected for direct contact risk. Similarly, individ-\nuals detained in the jail are placed in compartments of 30\npeople. Figure 2 shows the extent to which individuals in\ndifferent age groups have contact with individuals by age\ngroup in key types of locations. Each hour, individuals in\nthe same location are in contact with each other, such that\ntwo individuals in the same house for three hours are con-\nsidered three contact events for each of them. Overall, in\nevents, an average of 39 contact events per day per agent.\nDisease states and transitions\nEach agent in the model is in one of three disease states at\nany time: colonized (denoted by C), uncolonized (denoted\nby U), or infected (denoted by I). Individuals transition be-\ntween these states, and individuals return to being suscep-\ntible after an infection or colonization, consistent with the\nobserved frequency of repeat infections [29]. Figure 3 sum-\nmarizes the disease states and transitions. A probabilistic\ndiscrete-time state transition approach is used to model\nchange in agent disease states, combined with a discrete\nevent scheduling approach with estimated distributions for\nthe duration of time spent in the states involved. Estimated\ntransition probabilities are used for the transitions U  C,\nC  U and C  I, and event scheduling determines\ntransitions for I  C and I  U. We assume perfect social\nmixing among individuals within a given location, except\nfor schools and jails (as described above).\nTransition from Uncolonized to Colonized State.

We de-\nfine the parameter a as the estimated transition prob-\nability of an uncolonized individual (in disease state U)\nbecoming colonized (transitioning to disease state C)\ndue to contact for one hour with a colonized individual.\nParameter a is the only disease state transition param-\neter in the model that is the result of physical contact\nbetween individuals. To consider a higher probability of\nbecoming colonized upon contact with an infected indi-\nvidual, we define the Transmission Intensity Parameter\n(TIP), which scales the transmission rate. In the base\ncase, we leave this parameter with a value of 1, but we\ninvestigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to\nthis parameter. For sensitivity analyses, the value of TIP,\nbased on expert judgment of infectious disease physi-\ncians (MZD and RSD), is set as twice the transmission\nrisk per hour when there is contact with an infected ra-\nther than a colonized agent.\nThe likelihood of transmission also depends on the\namount of physical contact in the place/activity: high,\nmoderate or negligible. Place/activities are assigned one\nof three levels of risk (Figure 3). This scaling factor is\ndenoted as the Place/Activity Risk parameter (PAR).\nEquation 1 summarizes the state transition process from\nthe uncolonized to the colonized state.\n\u00bd \ns\n\u00bc TIPs\n\u00c2 PAR \u00c2 a \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Pr[U  C]s\nis probability that an uncolonized in-\ndividual becomes colonized through contact with an in-\ndividual in state s, of C or I, and TIPs\ndepends on the\nstate of the contacting individual. MRSA risk categories\nby place and activity are summarized in the technical ap-\npendix (Additional file 1: Table S1).\nTransition from Colonized to Uncolonized State. An\nindividual may spontaneously become uncolonized, as\nthe individual's defenses eliminate the bacteria, or may\nremain colonized over an extended period. The hourly\nprobability of a transition is denoted by parameter e, es-\ntimated as described below:\n\u00bd  \u00bc e \u00f02\u00de\nTransition from Colonized to Infected State. Colo-\nnized individuals may develop infections. This may be\na result of a skin abrasion or other injury, or of an in-\ndeterminate process.

Activities with\na higher risk of the skin being abraded or punctured (such\nas may happen at a sports activity or in a hospital, jail or\ndaycare center) have elevated risk of infection. We assume\nthat an individual always passes through the colonized (C)\nstate prior to becoming infected (I), although this is a\nminor assumption as the duration of colonization may be\nas brief as one hour.\nTransition from Infected to Colonized and Uncolonized\nStates. Infections vary in length, averaging about two\nweeks, based on clinical observations and expert judgment.\nAn infected individual may seek treatment or care for the\ninfection without seeking professional medical care. We\ncollected national survey data through the Time-sharing\nExperiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) to determine\nindividuals actual and hypothetical care-seeking behavior\nin response to MRSA-like skin infections. Individuals con-\nsistently reported that they had or would seek clinical care\nabout half the time (Wilder JR, Wegener D, David MZ,\nMacal CM, Daum R, Lauderdale DS: A national survey of\nskin infections, care behaviors and MRSA knowledge, sub-\nmitted). Almost all MRSA skin infections would resolve\nwhether or not care is sought, although clinical attention\nlikely decreases the duration of infection. When the infec-\ntion is resolved, the relative likelihood of ceasing to be col-\nonized with MRSA may be higher when the infection is\ntreated with antibiotics by a clinician. Both because clini-\ncians may treat infections with antibiotics and because they\nwould give instructions on how to care for an infection,\nthe proportion uncolonized after infection is greater for\nthose who seek professional medical care than those\nwho do not. These transitions and contingencies are\ngraphically represented in the behavioral model presented\nin Additional file 1: Figure S2 in the technical appendix.\nEstimating disease transmission and transition\nparameters\nWe used published data for initial estimates of colonization\nrates [30], decolonization rates [31], and infection rates\n[32]. We derived household transmission rates from data\ndescribed in Miller et al [30]. and used bootstrap resam-\npling methods to calculate confidence intervals, which we\nused as plausible ranges for transmission rates in the simu-\nlation. Disease state transition parameters are estimated\nusing a discrete-time Markov chain approach [33].\nWe then ran the model over the space of plausible\ntransmission parameters. In doing so we found that some\ncombinations of transmission parameters produced results\nthat closely matched the CA-MRSA build-up meta-\nanalysis estimates [6] that occurred in the period 2001 \u00ad\n2010 in Chicago, while others did not. The identification\nof transmission parameters is more fully described in the\ntechnical appendix (Additional file 1: Figure S3). The\nagent disease state transmission/transition parameters are\nshown in Table 1.\nInitial conditions\nAll runs were initialized with the number of infected in-\ndividuals at 104 and the number of colonized individuals\ninfected is consistent with observed data [17]. The num-\nber of colonized individuals is not observed, but is based\non national colonization data in the same year that was\ncollected as part of the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey, a nationally representative survey\ncollected by the National Center for Health Statistics.\nment of nasal colonization for MRSA [34]. We adjusted\nthe colonization rate they found to account for an\nunderestimate because only one body site (nares) was\nchecked for colonization. Infected and colonized individ-\nuals were randomly located in the zip codes that had\nMRSA cases in 2001, drawing on data described in Hota\nModeling behaviors\nWe developed a flexible framework for modeling behav-\nior of individuals in response to infection, which could\nbe expanded to include the behavior of healthcare\nworkers. Based on available evidence [30,31] and expert\nopinion, clinical care may reduce the duration of infec-\ntion and decrease the probability of being colonized after\nthe infection resolves. Thus, we permit infected individ-\nuals to vary in the likelihood that they seek medical care,\nwith overall probability estimated from our TESS survey.\nThe behavioral model is presented in the technical ap-\npendix (Additional file 1: Figure S2).\nModel validation\nThere are generally accepted processes for validating\nlarge-scale simulation models [36]. Validating a social\nsystems model that contains elements of human behav-\nior to the point of numerical equivalence between model\noutputs and observed phenomena is usually not possible\nand is generally not considered an attainable goal [37].\nRather, a series of validation tests are performed to\nestablish credibility for the model for its intended use.\nApproaches to validation include establishing face valid-\nity (domain experts' judgmental assessments of model\nmechanisms and results), stochastic equivalence (adher-\nence of the distribution of model outputs to estimated\nuncertainty ranges for observed data), alternative history\nexplorations (ability of the model to produce alternate\nhistories), model falsification (parameter sweeps over a\nrange of plausible assumptions designed to reveal im-\nplausible cases), and model docking (comparing results\nof different types of models of the same system). Each of\nthese approaches was used in the iterative development\nof the CA-MRSA ABM. Tests that support the validity\nof the model include recorded infection incidence by zip\ncode [35], jail stay annual data (various sources), hospital\nvisits annual data (various sources), and colonization\ndata from diverse studies.\nPlatform\nThe ABM is implemented in Repast, a general-purpose\nagent-based modeling toolkit. The Repast suite includes\nthe Java-based Repast Simphony [38] and the C++ -\nbased Repast for High Performance Computing (HPC)\n[39]. The initial CA-MRSA ABM prototype was imple-\nmented in Repast Simphony for a small region of three\nChicago zip codes [40]. The prototype was translated\ninto Repast HPC for large-scale model runs. The CA-\nMRSA ABM is designed to run on computing platforms\nthat include desktop computers, computing clusters\n(e.g., the Blues and Fusion clusters at Argonne National\nLaboratory), and specialized high performance com-\nputers (e.g., the IBM Blue Gene class of machines at\nArgonne National Laboratory).\nStochastic variability\nThe CA-MRSA ABM is inherently a stochastic model,\nwith random variation affecting both disease transmission\n(uncolonized to colonized transition) and transition (the\nlength of time in the colonized or infected states). To prop-\nerly characterize uncertainty requires that, for each case\nrun with the model, multiple simulations be run in which\nthe initializing random number seeds are varied. Studies\nare described in the technical appendix of the appropriate\nnumber of simulation runs to characterize uncertainty of\nthe model outputs (Additional file 1: Figure S5). The re-\nsults show that the moving average of the estimated vari-\nance decreases continuously from 15 to about 28 runs and\nthen stabilizes, indicating that batch sizes of a minimum of\n28 runs are adequate to estimate of model output statistics.\nResults presented here are based on 32 runs, which was\nfound to adequately characterize the inherent uncertainty\nin the model.\nTable 1 Agent disease state transmission/transition\nparameters\nParameter\n(Probability/Hour)\nRange of\nvalues tested\nRange\nfor good\nmodel fits\nBest fit of disease\nstate transition\nprobabilities\nNotes: a is the probability per hour of an uncolonized agent who is located in\na place with one or more colonized individuals transitioning to colonized\nstate. b is the probability per hour of a colonized agent spontaneously\ntransitioning to infected state. e is the probability per hour of a colonized\nagent spontaneously transitioning to uncolonized state.\nResults\nFigure 4 shows the meta-analysis estimate of the actual\n[6], which has been adjusted for an underestimate be-\ncause the incidence data derive from clinical records\nonly includes MRSA infected patients who seek medical\ncare. The yellow band is a point-wise 95% C.I. represent-\ning uncertainty around the Chicago incidence estimate.\nThe blue band corresponds to the results from 32 model\nruns using the best fitting transmission parameters, and\nits width indicates variability over the runs. The narrow-\nness of this blue interval demonstrates that, at least\npoint-wise, there is little stochastic variability in the re-\nsults of the model (conditional on these values of the pa-\nrameters), and the vast majority of the variation in\nFigure 4 is due to intentional variation in the values of\nthe model parameters.\nOver the same years, cases were observed to spread\nfrom the initial concentration in inner city neighbor-\nhoods to a more diffuse pattern across the city. Figure 5\nshows the model output by zip code and year, with the\ndiameter of the circles indicating the numbers of newly\ncolonized agents (larger orange circles) and incident in-\nfections (smaller red circles) in each zip code by year.\nDuring the first five years, there is a spread from a small\nnumber of zip codes to a citywide problem, and the pat-\ntern then remains similar for the last five years.\nOver each ten-year run, there were about 2.1 \u00d7 106\nnew colonization events, or 72 colonization events per\ninfections, or about 4 per 1000 person-years. Among the\nof contact with a colonized individual and 1.4 percent\nwere the result of contact with an infected individual.\nBy far the most common geographic location for\ncolonization transmission events was households (in-\ncluding both an individual's own household and ones\nthey visited), accounting for 65.1 percent of newly colo-\nnized agents. Schools or daycare centers were the next\nmost frequent, accounting for 15.8 percent. Hospitals\naccounted for only 7.8 percent of newly colonized\nagents. Initial reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks in the\nearly 2000s came from jails and sports teams. However,\njails and athletic activities were less frequent locations\nfor new colonizations, accounting for 2.9 percent and\n5.6 percent, respectively (Table 2).\nSensitivity analyses\nA set of experiments was designed to test the robustness\nand sensitivity of the model results to three types of pa-\nrameters whose initial values were set based on expert\njudgment. (1) Different types of places provide oppor-\ntunities for lesser and greater levels of physical contact,\nand the Base Case values reflected those differences.\nPAR indicates the relative likelihood of physical contact\nbetween individuals at various places, with PAR >1 indi-\ncating relatively more contact. For sensitivity analysis,\nthe value of PAR did not vary by place. (2) Individuals\nwith active infections may be more likely to spread\ncolonization than colonized individuals. TIP allows in-\nfected individuals to be more likely (TIP > 1) to spread\ncolonization than colonized individuals. Sensitivity ana-\nlyses set TIP at 2.

Table 4 shows the results of the sensitiv-\nity analyses. There is little variation in the proportion of\nall disease transition events that are colonization events\nacross all cases (column 2). Compared the Base Case,\nthe AIP Sensitivity Case shows the greatest change, an\nsurprising for this case as it reduces the probability of\nindividuals transitioning from the colonized to infected\nstates in physically active places.\nNorth Side\nWest Side\nCentral\nSouth Side\nFigure 5 Model results of geographic distribution of CA-MRSA colonizations and infections, by zip code and year.

The largest contrast to the Base Case\nis when the PAR is set to 1 in all places. Then the propor-\ntion of new colonizations that take place in households is\ngreatly reduced, although still a majority (53.9% compared\nto 72.9%). However, the assumption that all places are\nequally likely to provide opportunity for skin-to-skin con-\ntact, which is generally thought to be necessary for trans-\nmission, is not plausible.\nDiscussion\nUsing a novel fine-grained agent-based model of the\npopulation of Chicago, we found that the great majority of\nnew CA-MRSA colonization events occurred in house-\nholds, where most individuals spend substantial time and\nhave a relatively high level of physical contact with others.\nSchools and daycare centers played the largest role in\nspreading colonization among households. Although out-\nbreaks in jails and sports teams were prominently featured\nin early reports about CA-MRSA, over the course of the\nten-year runs of the model, they are responsible for\nrelatively low percentages of new colonization events.\nNonetheless, athletic activities of all kinds did account for\nmore than five percent of colonization events and could\nhave a high attributable risk for individuals who engage in\nmodel results show spread from a small number of zip\ncodes concentrated on the south and west sides of the city\nto citywide incidence, and that pattern remains similar for\nent with the findings of Hota et al. [35].\nWe also found that the overwhelming majority of new\ncolonizations are the result of a contact with a colonized\nindividual rather than an infected individual, even when\nwe set the probability of transmission as twice as great\nwhen a susceptible individual spends time with an in-\nfected person, compared with a colonized person. How-\never, since colonization is so much more common than\ninfection and lasts much longer, an intervention which\nfocuses solely on clinically apparent infections to reduce\ntransmission is unlikely to have much impact on overall\nincidence. These results suggest that a particularly effect-\nive intervention might be one that prevented transmission\nfrom asymptomatic MRSA carriers within households to\ntheir household contacts. These findings challenge current\npublic policy in the U.S., which focuses on the control of\nMRSA in the healthcare setting or among people with\nactive infections.\nOur model has several novel features that represent\nimportant aspects of the epidemiology of CA-MRSA and\nits transmission. Time is represented at the hourly level\nallowing us to incorporate detailed empirical time-use\ndata into the model. Space is represented by geo-located\nplace, and the contact network is an emergent character-\nistic of agents located in the same physical places. We\nhave used the census sociodemographic characteristics\nof agents (i.e., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, years in\nschool, employment status and household income) to\nprobabilistically link activity profiles and probabilities of\nhospitalization and jail detention to agents. In addition,\nthe places/activities are graded with respect both to the\nlevel of direct physical contact likely to occur there,\nwhich affects the transition from the uncolonized to the\ncolonized state (conditional on an individual with MRSA\nbeing in the same location), and to the likelihood of skin\nabrasions or punctures, which affects an individual's\ntransition from the colonized to the infected state. We\nhave shown that the outputs of the model are similar to\nthe temporal and geographic trends in CA-MRSA inci-\ndence in Chicago. This does not directly validate the\ntransmission parameters or the contact network. How-\never, the similarity of our model output to the descrip-\ntive epidemiology of CA-MRSA in Chicago will allow us\nto use the model to estimate the magnitude of likely ef-\nfects both of public health and clinical interventions that\nTable 3 Set up for sensitivity analyses of transmission\nparameters\nMRSA Risk Category PAR base\ncase value\nPAR\nsensitivity\ncase\nTIP\nsensitivity\ncase\nAIP\nsensitivity\ncase\nNotes: AIP values are assigned according to the specific activity that an\nindividual is engaged in at a specific place and time during the simulation.

With only 7.8 percent of new colonizations es-\ntimated to occur in hospitals, this approach will have\nlimited impact and concentrates resources on a type of\nlocation that seems to be responsible for less than one-\ntenth of transmissions.\nNevertheless the model has limitations. The results\nfrom any model are conditional on the assumptions\nmade in deriving the model relations and on the data\nemployed for that purpose. Some of these assumptions\nconcern phenomena in part that are not directly observ-\nable, such as the number of people colonized with CA-\nMRSA. In the CA-MRSA ABM, the assumptions cover\nthe three main model areas: contact, transmission, and\nbehavior. We assume the activity profiles and time use\nsurveys upon which the contact model is based, which\nare national in scope, are applicable to the Chicago area.\nWe assume that assigning activity profiles based on\ndemographic characteristics adequately captures the\nrelevant heterogeneity in behavior, and that people con-\ntinue in these activity patterns throughout the period\ncovered by the simulation. We assume that the rules for\nmatching people to associated hospitals, the jail, schools,\nand workplaces reflect a reasonable approximation to\nthe real world. We assume that CA-MRSA transmission\ncan be modeled accurately at the fine-grained compart-\nment level based on agents' behaviors and \"micro-inter-\nactions,\" such as skin contact based on co-location, and\nwe assume random mixing among individuals at each lo-\ncation at the same time. These assumptions are explicit\nin the model, and can be easily modified as new data or\nalternate hypotheses become available and as the pro-\ncesses mentioned above are better understood. In the fu-\nture, it will be possible to further justify these assumptions\nor modify them as necessary, thereby increasing the accur-\nacy of the model and our confidence in its predictions as\nwe experiment with novel interventions.\nConclusions\nIn summary, our novel agent-based model of CA-MRSA\nin a large U.S. city demonstrated that current interven-\ntions aimed at controlling the spread of MRSA are un-\nlikely to succeed in reducing overall CA-MRSA incidence.\nAccording to the results of our model, the most effective\ncontrol strategy would be one that reduces CA-MRSA\ntransmission within households, particularly from colo-\nnized to uncolonized contacts. Our findings suggest that\ncurrent paradigms in MRSA control in the United States\ncannot be very effective in reducing the incidence of CA-\nMRSA infections. Furthermore, the control measures that\nhave focused on hospitals are unlikely to have much\npopulation-wide impact on CA-MRSA rates. New strat-\negies need to be developed, as the incidence of CA-MRSA\nis likely to continue to grow around the world.\nSupporting information\nThe Repast HPC computer code for the complete CA-\nMRSA ABM model is available at https://github.com/\ncontact-contagion/mrsa-c.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Technical appendix: supplemental information.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCMM, DSL, MJN, RSD and MZD designed the research; MJN and NC\nimplemented the model; CMM, DSL, MJN, NC, VMD, DTW, MZD, RSD, PS, JAE,\nJRW performed the research; LGM and SJE provided data for estimating\nmodel parameters; CMM, DSL and MZD analyzed the data; and CMM, DSL,\nRSD, MZD, and PS wrote the paper.
