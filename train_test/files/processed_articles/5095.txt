Not only\nis the prevalence of diabetes higher among Vietnamese\nAmericans than Whites (McNeely and Boyko, 2004) but\nrates of diabetes-related morbidities and mortality also\nare higher for Vietnamese Americans compared to\nWhites (e.g. Pugh et al., 1995). To reduce complications\nassociated with uncontrolled diabetes for which older\nadults are at particular risk (Kirkman et al., 2012),\npatients must adhere to a number of prescribed health\nbehaviors, including eating a healthy diet (American\nDiabetes Association (ADA), 2017). Adhering to a diet\nthat promotes blood sugar control is reported to be\namong the most difficult aspects of diabetes manage-\nment (Beverly et al., 2008), with correspondingly high\nrates of dietary nonadherence (Vijan et al., 2005).\nAcross races/ethnicities, spouses often serve as an\nimportant influence on their partners'diabetic diet (August\n(e.g. Stephens et al., 2013), most of this literature has\nfocused on spousal support (e.g. Beverly et al., 2008;\nonly encourage and provide positive feedback on their\npartners' dietary behaviors but also attempt to influence,\nor change, diet-related attitudes or behaviors. Furthermore,\nmost studies on spouses' involvement in their partners'\nchronic disease in general have used predominately White\nsamples. Little is known about potential cultural differ-\nences in how spouses are involved in their partners' dis-\nease management, and even less is known about cultural\ndifferences in specific social processes, such as spousal\ninfluence attempts, in this context. Given that Vietnamese\nAmericans are at particular risk for poor diabetes out-\ncomes, efforts to understand these social processes among\none of the fastest-growing Asian subgroup in the United\nStates (US Census Bureau, 2012) are important for devel-\noping culturally appropriate interventions for patients and\ntheir families. This study accordingly sought to examine\nwhether factors related to patients' diabetes were impor-\ntant for how and how often Vietnamese American versus\nWhite spouses attempted to influence their partners' dia-\nbetic diet.\nDisease factors associated with spousal\ninfluence on diabetic diet: An exploratory\ncomparison of Vietnamese American and\nWhite older adults\nKristin J August1, Alexandra Dowell1 and Dara H Sorkin2\n Keywords\ndiabetes, gender, health-related social control, race/ethnicity, social undermining\n1Rutgers University, USA\n2University of California, Irvine, USA\nCorresponding author:\nKristin J August, Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, 311\nEmail: kristin.august@rutgers.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nSpousal influence on their partners'\ndiabetic diet\nSpouses may attempt to positively influence their partners'\ndietary adherence by exerting health-related social control,\nwhich involves efforts to monitor and influence individuals\nto improve their health behaviors (e.g. eating a healthy diet;\nLewis and Rook, 1999). Although the intention of social\ncontrol may be to facilitate improved health behavior in the\nrecipient (Hughes and Gove, 1981), whether control is\nactually health promoting depends, in part, on the type of\nstrategy that is used. Two main strategies of social control\nhave been distinguished in the literature (Lewis and Rook,\ncontrol, or persuasion, refers to gentle reminders, expres-\nsions of worry, and other attempts at influence that tend to\nelicit positive emotions in the recipient (Stephens et al.,\n2009). Negative health-related social control, or pressure,\nrefers to criticisms, restrictions of behavior, and other\nattempts at influence that tend to elicit negative emotions in\nthe recipient (Stephens et al., 2009). Previous research has\nfound both types of social control to be common among\nolder couples managing a diabetic diet (Franks et al., 2012),\nalthough patients with diabetes report receiving (August\nand Sorkin, 2010) and nondiabetic spouses report using\n(Stephens et al., 2013) persuasion more frequently than\npressure. The behavioral and emotional consequences of\nthese types of social control are relatively well understood,\nwith individuals typically responding more favorably to\npersuasion than pressure (August and Sorkin, 2010;\nResearch has begun to examine the potential spousal and\nrelational consequences associated with engaging in social\nwhat factors are associated with the frequency in which\nspouses engage in different types of social control.\nIn addition to spousal efforts to promote dietary adher-\nence by engaging in social control, spouses may detract\nfrom their partners' dietary adherence by engaging in\nhealth-related social undermining, which involves efforts\nto hinder individuals'goal of engaging in healthy behaviors\n2010). Compared to the intended health-promoting effects\nof social control, undermining may or may not be intended\nto be health-compromising (Gallant et al., 2007; Henry\net al., 2013). Furthermore, undermining is less frequently\nused than social control in this context (Gallant et al., 2007;\nHenry et al., 2013), as spouses and their partners often have\nthe shared goal of adherence to a chronic disease regimen\n(Berg and Upchurch, 2007). Undermining nonetheless may\ninterfere with patients' efforts to adhere to their prescribed\nAlthough undermining has not been extensively studied in\nthe context of chronic disease management, Henry et al.\n(2013) distinguished between two types of undermining\nspecific to a diabetic diet. The first type, tempting, refers to\nattempts to encourage unhealthy behaviors, such as tempt-\ning a partner to eat foods that are not part of a prescribed\ndietary regimen. The second type, disregard, refers to\nattempts to discourage healthy behaviors, such as down-\nplaying the importance of a diabetic diet. Similar to the lit-\nerature on strategies of social control, these two types of\nnegative influence have been shown to be differentially\nassociated with recipient outcomes, with tempting being\nrelated to dietary nonadherence and disregard being related\nto nonadherence to other components of a diabetic regimen\n(Henry et al., 2013). Compared to the literature on social\ncontrol, even less is known about what factors are associ-\nated with the frequency in which spouses engage in differ-\nent types of undermining.\nFactors related to spousal influence\nAlthough some research has focused on factors associated\nwith providing social support to an individual in need (see\nDunkel-Schetter and Skokan, 1990) including patients with\ndiabetes (Iida et al., 2010), little is known about factors that\nmight be associated with spousal influence. Berg and\nUpchurch (2007) discuss the importance of contextual fac-\ntors in couples' management of chronic disease; specifi-\ncally, they note the importance of proximal contextual\nfactors, including characteristics of the disease itself, as well\nas sociocultural factors, including race/ethnicity. Building\non this framework, this study sought to understand how dis-\nease factors are associated with how frequently spouses use\ndifferent types of dietary influence and how these associa-\ntions may differ as a function of race/ethnicity.\nDisease factors.The length of time couples are managing\ndiabetes may have an impact on what type and how fre-\nquent spousal influence attempts are. When couples are\ncoping with a recent diagnosis, more positive spousal\ninvolvement may be necessary to ensure adherence to a\nnewly prescribed dietary regimen (Trief et al., 2003). At the\nsame time, spouses may be more likely to undermine their\npartners' efforts to follow their dietary regimen, because\nboth partners may still be adapting to a newly prescribed\nregimen that requires redistribution of household responsi-\nbilities and changes to established patterns of behavior that\nmay challenge continual adherence (Franks et al., 2016;\nIn addition to an objective factor such as time since\ndiagnosis, spouses' perceptions of how their partners are\nmanaging or coping with their disease may be important\nto consider with regard to how and how often spouses\nengage in behaviors to influence their partners' diabetic\ndiet. Specifically, the extent to which spouses perceive\ntheir partners to already be following a diet consistent\nwith their prescribed regimen may be related to spousal\ninfluence attempts. Social control has been posited to\nAugust et al. 3\noccur when individuals require assistance with self-\nregulating their own health behaviors (Hughes and Gove,\nengaging in poor dietary behaviors, spouses would be\nmore likely to exert social control in an attempt to improve\ntheir dietary behaviors; in contrast, if patients are already\nengaging in healthy dietary behaviors, spouses may not\nfeel a need to engage in such attempts. Whether spouses'\nperceptions of their partners' dietary behaviors are related\nto spousal undermining is less clear. For example, tempt-\ning may occur in response to patients who already may be\nengaging in healthy dietary behaviors, but are offered for-\nbidden food in an attempt to provide comfort or other\npositive emotions this food may elicit, or to make the\npatient feel included in family celebrations that involve\net al., 2005). Disregard, in contrast, may occur in response\nto spouses' frustration with their partners' lack of effort\nin self-regulating their own dietary behaviors (Henry\net al., 2013). Spouses may not want to be burdened or\nstressed with the sole responsibility of making sure their\npartners are adhering to their diabetic diet (August et al.,\nThe extent to which spouses perceive their partners to be\nworried about their diabetes also may play a role how and\nhow often spouses influence their partners' behaviors.\nResearch suggests that many patients and their spouses\nworry about diabetic complications and experience anxiety\nworries may motivate spouses to ensure their partners are\nproperly adhering to their prescribed regimen by engaging\nin more spousal control and less spousal undermining.\nSociocultural contextual factors.Not only is the proximal\ncontext important to consider in understanding spousal\ninfluence but the sociocultural context in which this type of\ninvolvement occurs also warrants consideration (Berg and\nmarried patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds\nidentify their spouses as playing an integral role in their\ndiabetes management (August and Sorkin, 2011), racial/\nethnic differences in the marital processes (McLoyd et al.,\n2000), couples' management of chronic disease (Gallant\net al., 2010), social influence of health behaviors (Gallant\net al., 2007), and dietary beliefs and practices (Tripp-Reimer\net al., 2001) suggest that there also may be racial/ethnic\n\ndifferences in factors associated with how and how often\nspouses attempt to influence their partner's diabetic diet.\nVietnamese Americans are a unique Asian subgroup in\nwhich to examine differences from Whites in the social\ninfluence processes involved in diabetes management. In\naddition to experiencing higher rates of diabetes and worse\noverall health than Whites (e.g. Sorkin et al., 2008), some\nVietnamese Americans have beliefs about diabetes man-\nagement that are inconsistent with Western culture (Ahn\ninvolvement may differ as a function of broad cultural dif-\nferences between individuals from collectivistic and indi-\nvidualistic cultures (Cross and Madson, 1997; Triandis,\n2001). Little is known, however, about health-related inter-\nactions involved in everyday disease management among\nVietnamese Americans--a fast growing, yet understudied,\nminority.\nThis study\nMost studies to date have focused on how spouses support\n(not influence) their partners' health behaviors in the con-\ntext of chronic disease management. The evidence that is\navailable about spousal influence on health behaviors is\nfocused mainly on implications for patients, and most\nresearch to date has only examined social influence pro-\ncesses using predominately White samples. Given the\nimportance of proximal and sociocultural contextual fac-\ntors for spousal involvement in disease management (Berg\nand Upchurch, 2007), this study sought to examine the role\nof disease (proximal) factors in spousal influence and\nwhether these factors differed for Vietnamese American\nand White older adults (sociocultural).\nFirst, we predicted that Vietnamese American spouses\nwould engage in more frequent social control than White\nspouses. We did not have any specific predictions about\nracial/ethnic differences in the frequency of spousal under-\nmining, however, given how few studies have examined this\ntype of influence. Second, we predicted that spouses whose\npartners had been diagnosed with diabetes for a shorter\nperiod of time would engage in more frequent spousal con-\ntrol and undermining. Third, we predicted that spouses who\nperceived their partners to be engaging in healthier dietary\nbehaviors would engage in less frequent spousal control\n(both types), more frequent tempting, and less frequent dis-\nregard. Fourth, we predicted that spouses who perceived\ntheir partners to have greater diabetes worries would engage\nin more frequent social control and less frequent undermin-\ning. We sought to examine whether all of these associations\ndiffered for Vietnamese American and White spouses.\nIn addition to race/ethnicity, another sociocultural factor\nimportant for understanding couples' management of\nchronic disease is gender. Gender differences in overall\nspousal involvement in a partner's disease management\n(Revenson, 2003), as well as in social influence attempts, in\nRosland et al., 2010) have been identified in the literature.\nMany of the previous findings related to gender are based\non mostly White samples, however, and thus little is known\nwhether gender differences in this type of spousal involve-\nment extend to individuals of other races/ethnicities, such\nas Vietnamese Americans. Given the small sample size of\nmen and women from each race/ethnicity in this study, gen-\nder is examined as an exploratory moderator.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants included 145 nondiabetic spouses over the age\nof 55 years whose partners had a diagnosis of type 2 diabe-\ntes. Participants for this study included White (n = 33 male,\nfemale) spouses. A majority (86.2%) of Vietnamese\nAmericans were born outside of the United States, com-\npared to 13.8 percent of Whites.\nProcedure\nand endocrinology clinics where they received their primary\ndiabetes care. Eligibility criteria for patients consisted of\nbeing diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and having had at least\none visit with a physician in the 2 years prior to the study.\nMarried patients who provided written consent were asked to\nprovide their spouses with a self-report questionnaire to\ncomplete at home and send back in a pre-paid, stamped\nenvelope. Spouses' compensation for participation included\na US$10 gift card. Approval for the project was provided by\na university-specific Institutional Review Board (See Kaplan\net al. (2013) for additional patient study details).\nMeasures\nAll survey questions were provided in English and\nVietnamese. Items were tested for cultural and linguistic\nequivalency through focus groups with native speakers, as\nwell as forward and back translation (Fowler, 1992).\nTime since diabetes diagnosis. To assess time since diagnosis\n(in years), patients were asked, \"How long have you had\ndiabetes?\" This value was subtracted from the year of data\ncollection.\nSpouses' perceptions of their partners' dietary behaviors.To\nassess spouses' perceptions of patients' dietary behaviors\nimportant for diabetes management, six items were adapted\nfrom the Kristal Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire\n(Shannon et al., 1997). Spouses rated on a 4-point scale\nhow often in the past week their partners ate low-sugar,\nlow-fat diets (1 = rarely/none of the time (<1 day), 4 = most\nor all of the time (5-7 days)). A sample item included, \"Eat\nfoods high in sugar (such as candy, fruit juice, cookies, tea\nor coffee flavored with sugar).\" The items were reverse\ncoded and averaged to create a composite measure of\nhealthy dietary behaviors ( = .81).\nSpouses' perceptions of patients' diabetes worries.To assess\nspouses' perceptions of their partners' worries, seven items\nwere adapted from the Patient Outcome Research Team\nstudy (Greenfield et al., 1994). Spouses rated on a 5-point\nscale the extent to which they thought their partners were\nworried or concerned about complications that may develop\nfrom diabetes (1 = not at all worried, 5 = extremely wor-\nried). A sample item included \"Dying earlier than most\npeople because of diabetes.\" The items were averaged to\ncreate a composite measure of diabetes worries ( = .95).\nSpousal control (persuasion and pressure).To assess spousal\ncontrol of dietary behaviors, items were adapted from Ste-\nphens et al. (2009). Spouses rated on a 6-point scale how often\nthey engaged in control attempts directed toward their partner\nin the past month (1 = not at all, 6 = every day). Items were\naveraged to create composite measures. Three items assessed\npersuasion; a sample item included: \"let your spouse know\nthat his or her poor food choices worry you\" ( = .91). Four\nitems assessed pressure; a sample item included: \"express irri-\ntation with your spouse's poor food choices\" ( = .85).\nSpousal undermining (tempting and disregard).To assess\nspousal undermining of dietary behaviors, items were\nadapted from Henry et al. (2013). Spouses rated on a\n6-point scale how often they engaged in undermining\nattempts directed toward their partner in the past month (1\n= not at all, 6 = every day). One item assessed tempting:\n\"tempt your spouse to eat foods not on his/her diabetic\ndiet?\" Two items assessed disregard for diabetic diet:\n\"show that you did not care about how well your spouse\nfollowed his/her diabetic diet?\" and \"show that you did not\nthink your spouse's diabetic diet was important.\" These\nitems were averaged to create a composite measure of dis-\nRace/ethnicity.Spouses' race/ethnicity was coded as 0 =\nWhite, 1 = Vietnamese American.\nGender. Spouses'gender was coded as 0 = male, 1 = female.\nCovariate selection. The following covariates initially were\nchosen a priori based on the literature suggesting that these\nfactors are important for spousal involvement in disease\nmanagement: spouses' age, spouses' education level\n(dichotomized at the approximate median split, 0 = high\nschool or less, 1 = some college or more), marital length,\nspouses' perceived marital quality (average of five items\nadapted from the Marital Quality Index; Norton, 1983), and\npatients'total illness burden (composite measure of chronic\nhealth conditions using a modified version of the Total Ill-\nness Burden Index; Greenfield et al., 2010). Only spouses'\neducation level was included as a covariate in final analy-\nses because it had a significant (negative) bivariate associa-\ntion with spousal persuasion, pressure, and disregard.\nAnalytic plan. All analyses were conducted using SPSS v24.\nNo key variables had more than 5 percent data missing\n(except time since diagnosis, which had 13.3% missing\ndata); missing data were excluded from analyses\nAugust et al. 5\nusing listwise deletion. To examine racial/ethnic and gender\ndifferences in key study variables, we conducted two-way\nanalyses of variance (ANOVAs). To account for unbalanced\ndata, we used type 2 sums of squares (Langsrud, 2003); to\naccount for multiple comparisons, we made a Holm\u00adBon-\nferroni sequential correction to p-values (Holm, 1979).\nTo test our study hypotheses, we conducted four multi-\nvariable linear regression analyses. We included all of the\ndisease factors in the same regression to determine the\nextent to which each disease factor was related to social\ninfluence while controlling for the other factors. We entered\nvariables in the following stepwise order: main effects of\nspouses' education as a covariate, disease factors (time\nsince diagnosis, spouses' perceptions of patients' dietary\nbehaviors, and spouses' perceptions of patients' diabetes\nworries), race/ethnicity, and gender (Step 1); three two-way\ninteractions between each disease factor and gender, three\ntwo-way interactions between each disease factor and race/\nethnicity, and the interaction between race/ethnicity and\ngender (Step 2); and three three-way interactions between\neach disease factor, race/ethnicity, and gender (Step 3). We\nprobed significant interactions by calculating simple slopes\nat -1/+1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean for the inde-\npendent variable and for each race/ethnicity and/or gender.\nResults\nParticipant characteristics\nTable 1 presents the results of two-way ANOVAs that\ntested racial/ethnic and gender differences in sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and key study variables.

Given\nthe importance of both proximal and sociocultural contex-\ntual factors in couples' coping of a chronic disease such as\ndiabetes (Berg and Upchurch, 2007), this study examined\nwhether disease factors associated with how frequently\nspouses engaged in different types of influence on their\npartners' diabetic diet differed for older Vietnamese\nAmerican and White men and women.\nSpousal influence on their partners' diabetic diet\nAmong all spouses, spousal control was used more fre-\nquently than spousal undermining, suggesting that spouses\nin general do not want to engage in behaviors that challenge\ntheir shared goal with their partners of adhering to a pre-\nscribed dietary regimen (Berg and Upchurch, 2007). There\nwere racial/ethnic differences in how frequently spouses\nengaged in most types of spousal influence and a gender dif-\nference in how frequency spouses engaged in persuasion.\nSpousal control.The finding that Vietnamese American\nspouses engaged in more frequent persuasion than White\nspouses may reflect expectations among individuals from\ninterdependent cultures that spouses are more likely to be\nmore involved in their partners' disease management than\nindividuals from independent cultures (Berg and Upchurch,\n2007). The behaviors used to persuade partners to change\ntheir dietary behaviors, such as spouses trying\nto do something to improve their partners' diet, are more\nconsistent with dyadic forms of coping that are more com-\nmon in Asian than Western cultures (Lyons et al., 1998).\nLike Vietnamese Americans, women have interde-\npendent self-representations (Cross and Madson, 1997),\nand also like Vietnamese Americans, they engaged in\nmore frequent persuasion than male spouses. This finding\nis consistent with previous studies that focus on recipient\nreports of social control (e.g. August and Sorkin, 2010).\nTwo possible reasons may account for why this gender\ndifference is seen in persuasion (but not pressure). First,\nthe older women in this study are more likely to adhere to\ntraditional gender roles by being responsible for planning\nand preparing meals (Trief et al., 2003); this role may\nallow women to more easily persuade their husbands to\neat a healthy diet. Second, female spouses may be better\nable than male spouses to calibrate their strategies to use\nones that are more commonly associated with positive\nemotional responses in their partners (e.g. persuasion;\nStephens et al., 2013), as women tend to be more aware of\ntheir spouses' emotional experiences than men (Kiecolt-\nSpousal undermining.

Vietnamese\nAmerican spouses who do not have diabetes themselves\nmay prefer to prepare and eat some of these commonly\nconsumed foods (Nguyen, 2014) for themselves and oth-\ners family members likely in the household (McLoyd\net al., 2000). These efforts may be reflected in the extent\nto which they report showing their partners that they care\nabout or think their diabetic diet is important.\nFactors related to spousal influence\nIn addition to racial/ethnic and gender differences in the\nfrequency of spousal influence, the sociocultural context\nplayed a role in which disease factors were related to differ-\nent types of spousal influence.\nSpousal control.The factors related to persuasion differed\nfor Vietnamese American and White spouses. For Vietnam-\nese American spouses, perceiving their partners to be eat-\ning a healthy diet more frequently was related to more\nfrequent persuasion. This finding is contrary to expecta-\ntions and inconsistent with the idea that social control is\nexerted in response to individuals' unsuccessful efforts at\nself-regulation (Hughes and Gove, 1981; Lewis and Rook,\n1999). This finding could be the result of the cross-sectional\nnature of the study design, however, and reflect the oppo-\nsite direction of hypothesized effects, in which recipient\nreports of persuasion are associated with eating a healthy\ndiet more frequently (August and Sorkin, 2010). Specifi-\ncally, it is possible that Vietnamese American spouses' pre-\nvious efforts at persuasion may have been effective (August\nand Sorkin, 2011), resulting in spouses perceiving their\npartners to be engaging in healthy dietary behaviors.\nFor White spouses, perceiving their partners to have\nmore diabetes worries was associated with more frequent\npersuasion. These spouses may attempt to allay their part-\nners' worries by engaging in efforts to persuade their part-\nners into eating a healthier diet. Similar to findings for\nWhite spouses, more diabetes worries were related to\nmore frequent spousal pressure among all spouses. One\npossible reason spouses' worries were not predictive of\nVietnamese American spouses' efforts to use persuasion\nmay reflect the difference in emotional expressiveness\namong Vietnamese Americans compared to Whites (Kim\net al., 2008), making it less likely that Vietnamese\nAmerican patients' worries are expressed in interactions\nwith their spouses. When patients' worries are visible,\nthen they may be viewed by spouses as particularly seri-\nous and prompt spouses to use more heavy-handed influ-\nence attempts (i.e. pressure) to improve their partners'diet\nand lessen their partners' worries.\nFinally, contrary to expectations, time since diagnosis was\nnot related to frequency of spousal control, suggesting that\nspouses may engage in social control at the relatively same\nfrequency regardless of when their partners were diagnosed.\nSpousal undermining. Contrary to expectations, Vietnamese\nAmerican male and White female spouses whose partners\nhad been diagnosed with diabetes for a shorter period of\ntime engaged in less frequent disregard. These spouses may\nbe particularly vigilant in their efforts to avoid engaging in\nbehaviors that show disregard for their partners' diet at a\ntime when symptoms may not be well-controlled and the\nimportance of the diet is communicated by more than one\nhealth care provider patients are likely to see early in their\ndisease course. It is unclear why this objective disease fac-\ntor was not related to the frequency of Vietnamese Ameri-\ncan female and White male spouses' disregard, however,\nand would need to be replicated in a larger sample to\nincrease confidence in its validity.\nSpouses' perceptions of their partners' worries were\nimportant for undermining, although most of the findings\nwere not in the direction that was expected. One unex-\npected finding was that all spouses who perceived their\npartners to have more diabetes worries engaged in more\nfrequent disregard. Perhaps, in attempting to assuage their\npartners' concerns about diabetes complications, spouses\nmay downplay the importance of dietary behaviors in suc-\ncessful diabetes management. Instead, spouses may stress\nthe importance of other more \"medical\" self-care behaviors\n(e.g. taking medication/insulin) that patients find easier to\nengage in (Beverly et al., 2008) and are more adherent to\nSpouses' perceptions of their partners' worries also\nwere important for spousal tempting, but only among\nVietnamese American spouses. Specifically, Vietnamese\nAmerican female spouses who perceived their partners to\nhave more diabetes worries engaged in more tempting; in\ncontrast, Vietnamese American male spouses who per-\nceived their partners to have more diabetes worries\nengaged in less tempting. This finding may be partially\nexplained by gender differences in the relative use of cop-\ning strategies (Tamres et al., 2002). Vietnamese American\nfemale spouses may be more likely to use an emotion-\nfocused coping strategy of preparing and offering forbid-\nden food in response to perceiving their husband's worries.\nVietnamese American male spouses, however, may be\nmore likely to use a problem-focused coping strategy of\nnot tempting their partners to eat foods that they believe\nmay lead to more health issues (Nguyen, 2014). It is\nunclear why this same effect is not seen among White\nspouses, although these findings for tempting should be\ninterpreted with caution, as only a very small proportion of\nvariance (3%) is explained by all variables in the model,\nand tempting was the least frequently reported influence\nattempt in this study.\nFinally, contrary to expectations, spouses' perceptions\nof their partners' dietary behaviors were not related to\nspousal undermining (tempting or disregard), suggesting\nthat spouses may engage in undermining regardless of how\nwell patients are adhering to their diet.\nAugust et al. 9\nTaken together, the findings from this study suggest that\nhealth-promoting and health-compromising influence on\ndietary behaviors occur at different frequencies and for\npotentially different reasons among spouses from different\nraces/ethnicities (and in some cases, genders). Spouses'\nperceptions of their partners' worries seem particularly\nimportant for spousal influence attempts.\nLimitations and future directions\nIn evaluating the findings from this study, some limitations\nshould be noted. First, because the results from this study\nare cross-sectional, we are unable to determine the tempo-\nral order of effects or predict change over time. Although\nwe posited that subjective disease factors, such as percep-\ntions of dietary adherence and diabetes worries, may\nprompt spouses to engage in influence attempts, there is\nlikely to be a bidirectional association between spousal\ninfluence and these factors (e.g. Franks et al., 2012;\nStephens et al., 2013). Future studies should examine these\npatterns longitudinally, as well as use experience sampling\nmethodologies in an attempt to determine the directionality\nof findings. An additional limitation is the small number of\nitems used to assess spousal undermining, and the low fre-\nquency of undermining (both types) spouses reported. It is\npossible, however, that there are less varied (and less fre-\nquent) spousal efforts to undermine a partner's diet than\nthere are to control it. Another limitation is the small sam-\nple size, with few Vietnamese American female spouses, in\nparticular. Although the findings from this study provide\npreliminary evidence about social influence among male\nand female spouses from two different cultures, they would\nneed to be replicated with a larger sample size to enhance\ntheir validity. In a related vein, a more in-depth understand-\ning of spousal influence in this context among individuals\nfrom racial/ethnic minority groups who are at a high risk\nfor diabetes (CDC, 2017) is an important next step for\nresearch. Finally, these findings cannot be generalized to\nindividuals with type 1 diabetes, who likely have been\ndiagnosed for a longer period of time and require the use of\ninsulin as part of their self-management regimen (ADA,\n2017); thus, an examination of the reasons for how and how\nmuch spouses are involved in type 1 diabetes management\nis another important direction for future research.\nDespite these limitations, the results from this study add\nto the literature on health-related spousal influence in the\ncontext of disease management and underscore the impor-\ntance of examining cultural differences in these social pro-\ncesses. Given the benefit of including spouses in chronic\ndisease management interventions (Martire, 2005), in\nwhich an important aspect of treatment success is behavior\nchange in the spouse (Burmin and Margolin, 1992), identi-\nfying factors related to spouses'behavior is essential for the\neffective design of interventions. These interventions\nshould better educate spouses to engage in behaviors that\nfacilitate, rather than detract from, their partners' diabetic\ndiet and should include elements consistent with cultural\nand gender-specific relationship dynamics, as well as dis-\nease management beliefs and behaviors. The consideration\nof the broader sociocultural context is particularly impor-\ntant given the growing population of diverse older adults\nwho are at a high risk for developing diabetes (CDC, 2017).\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nFoundation, The Anthony Marchionne Foundation, and The\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nReferences\nAhn AC, Ngo-Metzger Q, Legedza AT, et al.
