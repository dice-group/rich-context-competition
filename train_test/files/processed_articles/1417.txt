Bone mineral density has been\nproposed as a marker for cumulative estrogen exposure. The authors studied the relation of bone mineral\ndensity to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment among 4,304 elderly subjects in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad1994). Bone mineral density was measured in five regions of\nthe proximal femur with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

However, stud-\nies relating estrogen to memory and various other measures\nof cognitive performance in human populations have been\nequivocal. Some investigators have reported that low levels\nof serum endogenous estrogen assessed from a single mea-\nsurement were associated with an increased risk of poor ver-\nbal memory (2, 3), while others have failed to confirm this\n(4). Estrogen replacement therapy administered to post-\nmenopausal women has been associated with improved ver-\nIf estrogen does improve memory, one would expect that\nwomen with a greater cumulative estrogen exposure during\ntheir lifetime would experience a lower prevalence of mem-\nory impairment. However, because of methodological and\nlogistic problems, adequate assessment of cumulative estro-\ngen exposure has been difficult. Several investigators have\nproposed that bone mineral density may serve as a marker of\ncumulative estrogen exposure in women (12, 13). We and\nother investigators have shown that high bone mass and bone\nmineral density are strongly associated with an increased risk\nof breast cancer among women (14, 15). Studies have shown\nthat estradiol, the major circulating form of estrogen, plays an\nimportant role in bone metabolism not only in women but\nalso in elderly men (16\u00ad19). A case-control study conducted\namong Japanese women suggested that dementia was associ-\nated with low bone mineral density (20). Recently, Yaffe et al.\n(21) reported that high bone mineral density in women was\nassociated with improved cognitive function; their study eval-\nuated a global index of cognition and tests of attention, exec-\nutive function, and psychomotor speed rather than focusing\non verbal memory.\nVerbal memory impairment is one of the strongest pre-\ndictors for the future development of dementia or\nAlzheimer's disease (22, 23) and is the single cognitive\nindex most often related to estrogen deficiency in human\nstudies (7, 23, 24). To our knowledge, previous studies have\nnot examined the relation of cumulative estrogen exposure\nassessed by bone mineral density to the risk of memory\nimpairment in either women or men. We used data from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) (25) to examine the relation of bone mineral\ndensity to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment\namong elderly men and women.\nNHANES III was a cross-sectional survey to obtain\nnationally representative information on the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, US\npopulation. The survey began in the fall of 1988 and was\ncompleted in the fall of 1994, with oversampling of the\nelderly, children under age 5 years, African Americans, and\nMexican Americans. NHANES III consisted of two separate\ncomponents, that is, the survey and the medical examina-\ntion. The survey was conducted at the participant's home by\ninterviewers using the Household Adult Questionnaire and\nFamily Questionnaire, followed shortly thereafter by a stan-\ndardized medical examination performed at either the\nMobile Examination Center or the subject's home by physi-\ncians and health technicians. A total of 6,596 persons aged\n60 years or over completed the Household Adult\nQuestionnaire, and 5,302 of these persons had a health\nexamination at the Mobile Examination Center.\nBone mineral density measurement\nBone mineral density measurements were made with\ndual-energy x-ray absorptiometry among subjects aged 20\nyears or over. Areal bone mineral density was measured in\nfive regions in the proximal femur: femoral neck, trochanter,\nintertrochanter, Ward's triangle, and total region (25). Bone\nmineral density was assessed in 4,818 subjects over 60 years\nof age; of these, 4,697 subjects had valid measurements.\nCognitive function assessment\nAmong subjects 60 years of age or over, cognitive func-\ntion was assessed at the home examination and at the\nMobile Examination Center. No specific attempt was made\nto exclude the subjects with cognitive impairment from the\nmemory test. In one section of the Household Adult\nQuestionnaire, the interviewer recited a list of three items:\n\"apple,\" \"table,\" and \"penny.\" Subjects were then asked to\nrepeat the three items until they had learned all three. About\n7.6 percent of the subjects were unable to learn all three\nitems (i.e., they learned two, one, or none of the items) after\nthe interviewer repeated these three words three times. After\nperforming an unrelated task, all subjects (regardless of\nwhether or not they could repeat the three items immedi-\nately) were asked to recall the three items. This is referred to\nas a delayed item recall. One point was awarded for the\nrecall of each item with a total score ranging from 0 to 3.\nDuring the health examination, subjects were read the fol-\nlowing story. \"Three children were alone at home and the\nhouse caught on fire. A brave fireman managed to climb in\na back window and carry them to safety. Aside from minor\ncuts and bruises, all were well.\" Subjects were asked to\nrepeat the story immediately after it was read to them. After\na few minutes of answering unrelated questions, the subjects\nwere again asked to repeat the story. This was referred to as\na delayed story recall. One point was scored for each of the\nfollowing ideas, if present in the answer: three children,\nhouse on fire, fireman climbed in the house, children res-\ncued, minor injuries, and everyone was well. Therefore, a\ntotal score for the recall of the story ranged from 0 to 6.\nWe combined scores from the \"delayed item recall\" and\nthe \"delayed story recall\" to yield a summary score for ver-\nbal memory ranging from 0 to 9. In the current analysis, we\nadopted the same definition as that proposed by Pekins et al.\n(26) to classify verbal memory impairment among the par-\nticipants in NHANES III. In that analysis, a subject was\nconsidered to have verbal memory impairment if his or her\nsummary score was less than 4 (26).\nOther risk factors\nInformation on other potential risk factors associated with\nimpairment of verbal memory was also collected. Such fac-\ntors included age, gender, racial/ethnic origin, number of\nyears of education, income, smoking history (never, former,\ncurrent), lifetime abstention from alcohol, and history of\nstroke. For women, information on hormone replacement\ntherapy was also collected. Subjects were defined as having\nhypertension if their systolic blood pressure was greater\nthan or equal to 140 mmHg, or if their diastolic blood pres-\nsure was greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or if they\nanswered positively to the question: \"Have you ever been\ntold by a doctor or other health professional that you have\nhypertension, also called high blood pressure?\"\nStatistical analysis\nIn this analysis, we include non-Hispanic Whites, non-\nHispanic Blacks, and Mexican Americans; the number of\nsubjects of other racial/ethnic origin was too small to gener-\nate valid estimates.\nBecause age, sex, and race/ethnicity are important determi-\nnants of memory and because subjects in older age groups,\nfemales, and non-Hispanic Whites had lower bone mineral\ndensity than those at a younger age, males, and non-Hispanic\nBlacks, we created age-, gender-, and race/ethnicity-specific\ncategories based on femoral neck bone mineral density.\nSpecifically, we stratified all subjects into 96 strata according\nto gender (two groups: male and female), age (16 groups: 2-\nyear age intervals), and ethnicity (three groups: non-Hispanic\nWhites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican Americans).\nWithin each stratum we assigned each subject to a quintile of\nbone mineral density.\nWe calculated the prevalence of verbal memory impair-\nment across different categories of potential confounding\nfactors for men and women separately. We estimated the\nprevalence of verbal memory impairment according to the\nquintile of bone mineral density and fitted a logistic\nregression model to examine the relation of bone mineral\ndensity to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment.\nIn a multiple logistic regression model, we adjusted for\neducation, alcohol consumption, smoking status, income,\nhistory of stroke, and hypertension. Because the associa-\ntion between bone mineral density and the prevalence of\nverbal memory impairment was similar among men and\nwomen, we also estimated the effect for both genders\ncombined.\nBone Density and Memory in the Elderly 797\nWe tested the significance of the trend in the prevalence\nof verbal memory impairment by including a single variable\nof quintile of bone mineral density in the multivariable\nmodel. To determine whether the association between bone\nmineral density and prevalence of verbal memory impair-\nment was modified by other risk factors, we examined the\neffect of bone mineral density at the femur neck within\nstrata of other risk factors. We tested for statistical signifi-\ncance of effect modification by including an interaction\nterm in the multivariable regression model. To evaluate\nwhether the association between bone mineral density and\nprevalence of verbal memory impairment observed at the\nfemoral neck would also hold true at other bony sites, we\nalso assessed the effect of bone mineral density in other\nproximal femur sites: trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's tri-\nangle, and total proximal region.\nTo examine whether the association between bone min-\neral density and prevalence of verbal memory impairment\nmay vary depending on the cutpoint of the combined verbal\nmemory score, we tested our results using two other cut-\npoints for verbal memory impairment, that is, summary\nscore of <3 or summary score of <5.\nBecause NHANES III data were collected using a com-\nplex sampling design, we used sample weights in all analy-\nses to account for unequal probability of selection and non-\nresponse and to produce an estimate of prevalence that was\nrepresentative of the noninstitutionalized, civilian, US pop-\nulation. We used SUDAAN statistical software (27) to\nincorporate sample weights and to account for the complex\nsurvey design in the variance estimates.\nRESULTS\nIII, 872 did not have a health examination, 422 received only\na home examination, 159 were of other racial and ethnic\ngroups, 337 had missing information on memory testing (54\nsubjects had missing information on both tests, 112 subjects\nhad missing information on a delayed item recall only, and\n171 subjects had missing information on a delayed story\nrecall), 480 had missing or unacceptable bone mineral density\ndata (30 subjects did not have bone mineral density measured,\nand in 450 subjects bone mineral density measurements were\nexcluded because the values were considered outliers), and 22\nhad missing data on other potential risk factors. These sub-\njects (n  2,292) were excluded from the analysis. The char-\nacteristics of the excluded subjects were similar to those of\nthe remaining subjects with regard to distribution by gender,\nsmoking status, and history of hypertension. However, com-\npared with excluded subjects, those remaining in the analysis\nwere younger (p < 0.001), more likely to be non-Hispanic\nWhites (p < 0.001), and better educated; they also had a lower\npercentage of lifetime abstention from alcohol (p  0.015),\nhigher annual income (p < 0.001), and a lower prevalence of\nsubjects, the average score on testing verbal memory was\nTable 1 presents the prevalence of verbal memory impair-\nment according to potential confounding factors in men and\nwomen, respectively. A higher prevalence of verbal memory\nimpairment was associated with older age, non-Hispanic\nBlack ethnicity, fewer years of education, lower annual fam-\nily income, and lifetime alcohol abstinence among men and\nwomen. Men with a history of stroke and nonsmoking\nwomen showed a higher prevalence of verbal memory\nimpairment.\nThe prevalence of verbal memory impairment decreased as\nbone mineral density at the femur neck increased in both men\nand women (table 2). Compared with those in the lowest\nquintile of bone mineral density, the multivariable-adjusted\nprevalence odds ratios of verbal memory impairment for men\nand women combined in each increased quintile of bone min-\neral density were 0.64 (95 percent confidence interval (CI):\ntively (p for trend < 0.001). A similar association was also\nfound when the different cutpoints of combined score (<3 and\n<5) were used to define verbal memory impairment (data not\npresented). Significant associations were also observed\nbetween bone mineral density at other proximal femoral sites\nand the prevalence of verbal memory impairment (data not\npresented). In light of the possibility that smoking and alco-\nhol consumption could have a direct effect on estrogen levels,\nso that adjusting for these factors might diminish the associa-\ntion between bone mineral density and verbal memory\nimpairment, we removed these two risk factors from the\nregression model; the results did not change materially.\nAn association between higher bone mineral density and\na lower prevalence of verbal memory impairment was con-\nsistent across various strata of other risk factors, with the\nexceptions being for Mexican Americans and current smok-\ners (table 3). No statistically significant interaction was\nfound between bone mineral density and verbal memory\nimpairment according to other risk factors.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results suggest that there is an association between\nbone mineral density and the prevalence of verbal memory\nimpairment among the elderly: The prevalence of verbal\nmemory impairment decreased with increasing bone min-\neral density. This relation was consistent across almost all\nstrata of potential confounding factors and was robust when\ndifferent cutpoints were used to define verbal memory\nimpairment. Although the biologic mechanisms that link\nhigh bone mineral density to a low prevalence of verbal\nmemory impairment are not fully understood, a high cumu-\nlative estrogen exposure is one compelling explanation.\nThus, our results suggest that high levels of long-term estro-\ngen exposure may be a critical element in the preservation\nof verbal memory with aging.\nTo date, evidence for the beneficial effect of estrogen on\ncognitive function in human subjects comes mainly from\nstudies of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal\nwomen. A few studies have indicated that estrogen replace-\nment therapy may improve verbal memory in healthy women\n(6\u00ad8). Administration of estrogen to postmenopausal women\nhas been reported to induce significant modifications in brain\nactivation patterns as assessed by functional magnetic reso-\nnance imaging or by a positron emission tomography scan\ndone while women perform verbal memory tasks (28, 29).\nResults from epidemiologic studies, however, often suggest\nthat women who take estrogen replacement therapy tend to\nbe healthier, better educated, and more physically active (30,\n31). Thus, the positive impact of estrogen replacement ther-\napy on memory function may be partly attributed to residual\nconfounding effects.\nOnly a few studies have examined the endogenous estro-\ngen level in relation to verbal memory. Phillips and Sherwin\n(2, 5) found that verbal memory was positively correlated\nwith estradiol levels through the menstrual cycle and\ndeclined after surgical oophorectomy. Drake et al. (32) mea-\nsured circulating sex hormone levels in 39 elderly, White,\nnondemented subjects and found that high estradiol levels\nwere correlated with better performance on simultaneous\ntests of verbal memory. However, Yaffe et al. (4) did not find\na consistent association between serum estrogen levels and\nsubsequent cognitive decline among elderly women. The\ninconsistency among studies is probably due to measure-\nment error in the assessment of serum estrogen levels,\nincluding fluctuation of endogenous estrogen levels over\ntime and different assay methods in different studies.\nFurthermore, it is unlikely that a single measurement of\nserum estrogen indicates a woman's cumulative exposure to\nestrogen. Smith et al. (11) found that an index of lifetime\nestrogen exposure computed from menstrual and reproduc-\ntive histories was associated with verbal abilities in elderly\nwomen. This index, however, is based on a retrospectively\nTABLE 1.

Estradiol may decrease oxidative stress,\ninhibit neuronal apoptosis, and promote synaptogenesis and\nsynaptic plasticity (33, 34). Estrogens also raise high density\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduce atherosclerosis, inhibit\nendothelin-mediated vasoconstriction, promote vasodilata-\ntion, and by all these means improve cerebral blood flow\nThe relation of estrogen level to bone mineral density has\nbeen recognized for decades. Numerous studies have shown\nthat serum or urine estrogen levels are strongly associated\nwith bone mineral density in pre- and postmenopausal\nwomen, and skeletal effects of low levels of estrogens are\nclearly seen after menopause or removal of the ovaries\n(39\u00ad44). In addition, women who have been receiving estro-\ngen replacement therapy, especially long-term estrogen\nusers, have significantly higher bone mineral density than\ndo women who have never used estrogens (45, 46). These\nfindings, in conjunction with our and other investigators'\nreports of an association between bone mass or bone min-\neral density and breast cancer risk (14, 15), suggest that\nskeletal status may serve as a proxy for cumulative estrogen\nexposure. Recently, Yaffe et al. (21) reported in a longitudi-\nnal study that women with lower baseline levels of bone\nmineral density and reductions in bone mineral density dur-\ning the follow-up, or vertebral fractures, had poorer cogni-\ntive function and greater risk of cognitive deterioration. In\ntheir study, subjects on estrogen replacement therapy were\nexcluded. In our main analysis we did not exclude subjects\nwho were receiving estrogen replacement therapy, because\nwe hypothesize that bone mineral density may serve as a\nmarker of cumulative estrogen exposure, including expo-\nsure to exogenously administered estrogens. Nevertheless,\nwhen we excluded 628 women who had hormone replace-\nment therapy from the analysis, a strong inverse relation\nbetween bone mineral density and prevalence of verbal\nmemory impairment still exists.\nOur findings of an association between bone mineral den-\nsity and the prevalence of verbal memory impairment in\nmen are intriguing. Animal studies have shown that high\nlevels of endogenous androgens are associated with\nimproved memory in mice (47). Administration of testos-\nterone to hypogonadal men, however, failed to improve ver-\nbal memory (48). Instead, Kampen and Sherwin (49) found\nthat circulating levels of estradiol, but not testosterone, were\nassociated with better performance on tests of visual mem-\nory. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the\nrelation of bone mineral density to the risk of verbal mem-\nory impairment in men. Studies have shown that testos-\nterone, the predominant circulating androgen in men, is\npositively correlated with bone mineral density in young\nadult men (50\u00ad52). Such an association, however, has been\nweak and inconsistent in elderly men (52\u00ad56). More\nrecently, evidence has been accumulated that estradiol lev-\nels are strongly associated with bone mineral density in men\n(16\u00ad19). Thus, high levels of cumulative estrogen exposure\nmay be one of the explanations for an inverse relation\nbetween bone mineral density and verbal memory impair-\nment in men. Nevertheless, there may be other, as yet\nunknown, mechanisms that result in both an increased\nprevalence of verbal memory impairment and a decreased\nbone mineral density.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the findings were\nbased on a cross-sectional survey; thus, we were unable to\nestablish the temporal relation between bone mineral den-\nsity and verbal memory impairment. For instance, it is pos-\nsible that subjects with severe verbal memory impairment\nwould be unable to maintain their previous levels of physi-\ncal activity, resulting in loss of bone mineral density. If that\nwere the case, adjusting for physical activity level would\ndiminish an association between bone mineral density and\nverbal memory impairment. Despite the fact that subjects\nwith a low physical activity level had a higher prevalence of\nverbal memory impairment in NHANES III, adding physi-\ncal activity level into the model had little, if any, effect on\nthe association. Similarly, subjects with a low verbal mem-\nory score may not practice other lifestyle measures that are\nassociated with a high bone mineral density. Second, we\nTABLE 2.

Studies have shown that\ndepression in women is associated with a decreased bone\nmineral density, and depression has also been related to ver-\nbal memory impairment (57). We were unable to control for\nthe effect of depression because mood was not assessed\namong subjects aged over 60 years in NHANES III; never-\ntheless, the effect of depression on memory impairment is\nmodest and unlikely to explain these findings (58). Third,\nsubjects with severe verbal memory impairment may have\nbeen less likely to participate in NHANES III; this non-\nresponse bias would lead to an underestimation of the preva-\nlence of verbal memory impairment. However, there is no\nreason to speculate that the nonrespondents, who were older\nand had lower incomes than did the respondents, would\nhave a higher bone mineral density when compared with the\nrespondents who had memory impairment. Finally, this\nanalysis focuses on the prevalence of significant memory\nimpairment and does not address the association between\nbone mineral density and milder degrees of memory loss.\nThe current study has several strengths as well. Numerous\nstudies have shown that, among cognitive functions, verbal\nmemory impairment is one of the strongest predictors of the\nrisk of dementia (22, 23); thus, the current findings are\nclearly of clinical relevance. Second, the verbal memory test\nused in this analysis consists of a simple three-item recall\ntest and a more challenging six-component story recall test;\nthe three-item test helps to reduce the chances of a \"floor\neffect.\" Finally, the combined score allowed us to use dif-\nferent cutpoints to define verbal memory impairment so that\nwe were able to perform sensitivity analyses. The method\nused to assess bone mineral density is state-of-the-art, so\nmisclassification of exposure is unlikely to account for our\nfindings. In addition, the participants of the NHANES III\nwere randomly selected from the US population; therefore,\nour results should be fairly generalizable to the elderly in the\nUnited States.\nIn conclusion, results from the NHANES III suggest that\nbone mineral density in elderly women and men is associ-\nated with performance on tests of verbal memory. Further\nstudies should extend this observation to examine the asso-\nciation between bone mineral density and clinical dementia.\nTABLE 3.
