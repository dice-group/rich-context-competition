    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study explored participant perception regarding the ease of relationship maintenance online, honesty in information\nsharing, and whether people were more, less, or similarly concerned about their online image over their in-person image\ngiven the prevalence and preference for electronic communication in most relationship forms. Most of the 296 participants\nwere consistently honest in their online information sharing. Women were more likely to worry about maintaining their\nin-person image than men and found it easier to maintain friendships online. Participants aged 30 to 45 years were the least\nlikely to post misleading information about themselves or their interests. Participants seemed to equate \"post a lot\" of\ninformation online as equated to \"post too much\" as not a single participant revealed that they \"post a lot.\"\n",

Just 3 years ago,\nHolmes, Moroney, and Holder (2009) found that the number\none electronic communication preference was email, a form\nof communication that hardly existed a decade prior\n(Stepanikova, Nie, & He, 2010). In this same short time\nspan, words such as \"friend\" have changed their meaning\n(Ledbetter et al., 2011), and words such as \"friended,\"\n\"texting,\" and \"texted\" became words either used colloqui-\nally or have entered the Webster dictionary. These most\nrecent words reflect the actual and now the most generally\nused current communication method across genders and age\ngroups, as reflected in this study.\nWhether social networking or electronic communication\nhas been a positive or negative influence on relationships\nhas been much debated (Baym, Zhang, & Lin, 2004;\nSpitzberg, 2006) in the past decade and is still explored in\nmore recent research, with foundational research reflected\nin quite old studies. Sheldon, Abad, and Hinsch (2011)\npointed to the two extreme views (online communication\nbeing either positive or negative) but contend that the real-\nity is more nuanced.\nOnline Support System\nSocial networking can provide support among people who\nalready have an in-person network in place. However, one\ncan find specific support networks for everything from infer-\ntility, surrogacy, rare genetic disorders, addictions, and other\nspecific groups in increasing frequency. Such groups of sup-\nport do not require that people have a face-to-face relation-\nship to be a part of their support. Among Facebook \"friends,\"\nMoreno et al. (2011) found that when users displayed depres-\nsive posts, they found support through their friend network,\nand others were more likely to support them through discus-\nsions of their own similar feelings.

The dating website eHar-\nthrough their service alone. A small-scale study by Young,\nDutta, and Dommety (2009) explored extracting psycho-\nlogical information from Facebook user profiles, for\ninstance, that an assumption could be made about users who\nposted a religious affiliation. Such users were more likely to\nbe single, and this was seen as an important factor in looking\nfor a potential mate as opposed to users who did not post a\nreligious affiliation, as is making one's profile public (invit-\ning communication from outside their \"network\").\nWang et al. (2011) explored the regrets that social net-\nworking users feel about past information sharing and found\nthat regrettable postings were not unusual for users, and they\ncentered around sensitive topics, emotions, and unintended\nviewers of their posts. Results demonstrated real-life ramifi-\ncations for users in terms of relationships and careers that are\nindeed negative. Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe's (2007)\nfindings from an earlier time found that psychological well-\nbeing was enhanced for participants who were experiencing\nlow self-esteem or life satisfaction.\nHypothesis 2: Disclosure of personal information will be\npositively correlated with in-person disclosure and\nnegatively associated with online disclosure.\nDiagnosable Internet Addiction\nSheldon et al.'s (2011) study opened with, \"Facebooking has\nbecome near-epidemic in college populations\" (p. 1), and\nquestioned whether it was actually an obsession that disrupts\nor consumes lives. Meerkerk, Van Den Eijnden, Vermulst,\nand Garretsen (2009) even developed an instrument to assess\nthe severity of compulsive online use and found that \"inter-\nnet addiction\" is increasingly recognized as a valid construct\n(p. 5). Kim, LaRose, and Peng (2009) found that those who\nwere already lonely or felt depressed or lacked social skills\ncould in fact develop compulsive Internet usage, increasing\nsymptom severity rather than relieving it through online con-\nnections. They also found that undergraduate students fre-\nquently underestimated how their peers were feeling as a\nresult of what they viewed on Facebook, resulting in more\nnegative feelings about themselves after logging off (Jordan\net al., 2011). Furthermore, it was found that even when users\nwith low self-esteem used social networking as a less\nfrightening way to express themselves, the items posted were\ngenerally not well received by others, making it difficult to\nconnect through this medium in the desired way (Forest &\nHypothesis 3: With increasing age, the amount of time\nspent on online will decrease.\nHowever, similar questions could have been asked of his-\ntorical participants who began using the telephone \"compul-\nsively\" or \"multiple times in the span of one day.\" An\nargument could be made that one was \"addicted\" to any new\ngadget that had entered one's life before the novelty wore\noff. Easy access and the lack of cost deterrent for those who\nalready have Internet access may make reining in compul-\nsive actions more difficult, and the potential for \"stalking\" in\nrelationships (or just a potential romantic interest) can also\nmore easily run amok in this climate given the access one has\nto information on just about anyone through a quick Google\nsearch.\nWhereas someone in the past may not have made a physi-\ncal \"drive by\" of an ex-partner's home, they may be far more\nlikely to check their social networking information, or ask a\nmutual friend to pull their information. Tokunaga (2011)\ncalled this \"interpersonal electronic surveillance.\" This type\nof access could bring an onslaught of information that in the\npast would have been unlikely (i.e., vacation photos with the\nnew partner, what their children look like and where they\nwork, as well as what they had for breakfast that morning)\nbut are all possibilities at this time and could cause psycho-\nlogical stress and jealously when it would have not been pos-\nsible before, especially for those who are anxiously attached\nto their partners (Elphinston & Noller, 2011). Marshall,\nBejanyan, Di Castro, and Lee (2012) found that anxiety\nrelated to relationship status was positively related with\nFacebook surveillance.\nOversharing and Safety Concerns\nBack et al. (2010) supported the theory that most people are\nfairly honest in their portrayal of themselves and are not\nusing profiles to promote an idealized virtual identity as\nmany had feared in the past would happen, reflecting on the\nanonymity of the Internet. Fernandez, Levinson, and\nRodebaugh (2012) suggested that social anxiety is indeed\nrecognizable in objective criteria posted on Facebook as well\nas raters' impressions. It seems that people are even more\nwilling to put more \"out there\" in many cases (especially in\nyounger demographics) than they would say or do in a physi-\ncal or face-to-face capacity. For younger adults, it seems that\nthey may be more willing to reveal information that could\nplace them at risk with regard to personal safety. Nosko,\nWood, and Molema (2010) found that as age increased, the\namount of disclosure regarding personal information in their\nprofiles decreased.\nHypothesis 4: Male anxiety scores related to image (online\nand offline) will be lower than that of their female\ncounterparts.\nHypothesis 5: Younger adult anxiety scores related to\nimage (including online and offline concerns) will be\nlower than that of middle- and older age participants.\nSocial Networking's Historical Context\nThis researcher was interested in exploring the more nuanced\nfeatures of the online relationship in all relational forms:\nstrangers, casual questioning, friendships, and romantic rela-\ntionships. Sheldon et al. (2011) went on to state that during\ntheir literature review, they found that the studies to date had\nrevealed that with greater social networking use, there was a\ngreater sense of relationship satisfaction as well as dissatis-\nfaction and bipolar feelings of connectedness. The extreme\nlanguage employed by researchers to describe social net-\nworking use could be seen as overwrought at this time.\nStudies such as Ledbetter et al. (2011) reviewed literature\nthat connected poor social skills as a reason to prefer to use\nelectronic forms of communication. This may have well\nbeen true when the use of Facebook to communicate was not\nubiquitous, as it is today. In today's relationships, even\nacquaintanceships, it is not uncommon to state or even\nassume in the beginning of a face-to-face conversation that\nthe parties involved already know certain information\n\"because I already saw it on Facebook\" or may start a con-\nversation by saying something like, \"Did you see what Mary\nposted on her wall?\"\nUsing social networking is more often than not an\nexpected part of interpersonal communication that fills in\nmany blanks in a way that perhaps a phone conversation\nwould have in the past, bridging the gap until the next face-\nto-face meeting. Also, if one states in a conversation, \"I\ntalked with Mary about such and such last week,\" it would\nnot necessarily mean that she actually \"spoke\" with her in\nperson or on the phone, but could have been involved in a\ntext message \"conversation\" or another form of electronic\ncommunication. Similarly, speaking to someone about one's\n\"Facebook friend\" and what someone \"said\" or \"did\" may\nnot actually mean that a person has had any face-to-face con-\ntact with the sharer. At this point with social networking's\ninfusion with face-to-face life, it can now be taken as a social\nslight if someone has missed an important milestone or\nannouncement made on one's social networking site and if\none is considered \"close\" to this sharer.\nSocial Networking As a Romantic Antagonist\nMore recently, Facebook has been a great antagonist to\nromantic relationships, with a 2010 study by American\nAcademy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) having found\nthat \"four out of five lawyers reported an increasing number\nof divorce cases citing evidence derived from social\nnetworking sites in the past 5 years, with Facebook being the\nmarket leader.\" Furthermore, \"Two-thirds of the lawyers sur-\nveyed said that Facebook was the `primary source' of evi-\ndence in divorce proceedings\" (Adams, 2011).\nMuise, Christofides, and Desmarais (2009) stated that the\nopen nature of social networking gives couples access to\ninformation they would have not had otherwise, and the lack\nof context often showed the reader how their partner knows\na certain person or what sort of conversation they are having.\nGiven the permanent nature of items posted on the Internet,\nit may be that in the future, answers will evolve and change\nin studies with regard to the perceived positive or negative\neffect of social networking on relationships. Young adults are\nbuilding a longer and more permanent history of actions,\nopinions, photos, activities, and relationships with more\ninformation available to potential friends, spouses, and\nemployers that can affect their present relationships and\nfuture opportunities.\nSocial Network Analysis Theory\nSocial network analysis is grounded in the systematic analy-\nsis of empirical data, although it was once seen as a method\nof inquiry rather than a stand-alone theory. People now\nactively think of their social networks (how and who they are\nconnected to in real life) the way sociologists have for many\ndecades because of the influence of online social networks\nsuch as Facebook and Twitter. These networks have long\nbeen researched by sociologists as an acknowledged way to\nmaintain relationships (Keller, 1968), share information, and\nfit in with those surrounding oneself in a community\n(Freeman, 2004). The biggest difference in then and now is\nthe ease with which one is included in or isolated from par-\nticular networks and the easier tracking by researchers with\nan eye for electronic data mining that is now available in\nnumbers that would have been incomprehensible 30 years\nI could not even sell the term `social network' to sociolo-\ngists\" (p. 2).\nGranovetter (1973) defined a tie and its strength as related\nto an investment of time, emotional intensity, mutual confi-\ndence, and reciprocity. Festinger, Schachter, and Back (1950)\nsimplified the idea of propinquity by showing that the term\nmeant that, in the simplest terms, people befriend their neigh-\nbors. Festinger's (1950) social comparison theory ties in fur-\nther with how people view themselves (and the contents of\none's social networking profile) with regard to their felt per-\nceptions about how others are superior or inferior to\nthemselves.\nStill, however, even with all of the data available, it\nseems that people's networks, although globally available in\na way never before imagined, still generally support very\nlocalized relationships (within driving distance). Rather\nthan \"the end of geography\" (Graham, 1998) as we know it,\nat this point, it appears that while the availability helps one\n4 SAGE Open\nforge new connections, at its core, electronic social net-\nworking in many ways continues to reflect the way things\nhave historically been, with relationships online reflecting\nthe connections one has face to face. People continue to\nmake comparisons of themselves in relationship with others\nin the community. This study explores what this researcher\nviews as simply a newer mode of communication and how\nparticipants perceive its role in supporting or taking away\nfrom relationships. How close ties are to begin with may\nplay a role, as Gilbert (2012) suggested, in that the perceived\nease or difficulty may depend on the intimacy of the rela-\ntionship in the first place. It was suspected by this researcher\nthat, in the end, while technology changes at a rapid pace as\ndo the options available to communicate, the more intimate\nthe relationship, the more likely the desire to prefer face-to-\nface interaction. Takhteyev, Gruzd, and Wellman (2012)\nstated simply, \"Social contacts benefit from physical prox-\nimity\" (p. 1).\nMethod\nAn online survey was distributed through Facebook via a\nweb-based platform, targeting ages 18 and above. Participants\nof this age range were chosen because the researcher was\ninterested in exploring adult communicative styles through\nthe use of technology and how the independent variables of\nage, gender, geographical location, and marital history affect\nhow one perceives the effect of technology on relationships\nwhether they be strangers, platonic friendships, or romantic\npartnerships. Participants were from 38 states in the United\nStates, while 24 participants resided outside of the United\nStates, with a 92% response rate. This sample was heavily\nCaucasian and well educated. The survey consisted primarily\nof closed-ended quantitative questions.\nfied as female, 1 identified as \"other,\" and 5 declined to\nanswer the question. During analysis, the researcher decided\nto eliminate the responses from the participant who identi-\nfied with the \"other\" category to restrict the research analysis\nto two sexes as opposed to three when exploring gender.\nParticipants were asked to respond to 28 multiple-choice\nquestions by selecting a single answer they felt best reflected\ntheir opinion and 1 open-ended question where they could\ndescribe their opinion in their own words with regard to how\nthey view the positive, neutral, or negative effects of technol-\nogy on their relationships. The survey was designed with a\nnonoptional informed consent agreement, which stated that\nparticipants must be above the age of 18 to take the survey. It\nalso made it clear that the survey was completely voluntary\nand anonymous, and included contact information for the\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) as well as for the research-\ners so that participants were able to pose questions, com-\nments, or complaints if needed. IP addresses were not\ncollected, and with the exception of the informed consent\nagreement, every item was voluntary and could be skipped\nwithout interrupting the rest of the survey. The snowball\nsampling technique was used to encourage Facebook users\nto repost the survey link on their pages to further distribute\nthe survey.\nTwitter was used to further disseminate the survey as\nwell as professional contact emails that went out to the\nresearcher's network as a separate collector of data.\nStatistical tests used were independent t tests, ANOVA, least\nsignificant difference (LSD), and Bonferonni post hoc tests\n(including Pplot graphs), as well as descriptive statistics and\nchi-square to analyze results, using (SPSS) IBM 19.0 soft-\nware. Significance was set at p  .05. However, there were\nmany instances when there were levels of p = .06 or .07\nlevels of significance, which this researcher considered as\nborderline significance in these findings and therefore\nreportable.\nResults\n\"I Do Not Post Too Much Personal Information\"\nOne of the most stunning findings in this study, without hav-\ning run a single statistical analysis, was the glaringly obvious\nlack of responses to one question option in particular regard-\nless of gender, age, or marital status. When participants were\nasked to rate their level of posting information about them-\nselves online (options were that they post no personal infor-\nmation, post a little, post moderately, or post a lot), with N =\n296, not one single participant chose \"post a lot.\" The major-\nity of participants (60%) stated that they post \"a little,\" while\n30% stated that they post a moderate amount. Those who\nclaimed to post no personal information about themselves\nGender Differences\nEase of Maintaining Friendships Online\nWhen participants were asked about the ease of maintain-\ning friendships online, men found it more difficult to do so\n1.79, SD = .85).

The range\nof misleading posting was 1 (never) to 4 (frequently). The\neldest group mean was 1.28, the middle group mean was\n1.15 (making them the least likely group to post misleading\ninformation about themselves online), and the youngest\ngroup was the most likely group to mislead others with a\nLevel of Concern With\nOffline Versus Online Image\nWhen participants were questioned about the level of con-\ncern they have for their offline image, age was a deciding\nvariable in determining how concerned they were.

There was also a significant difference\nbetween the middle group (30-45 years) and the older group\nThe range of concern in trying to present and maintain\none's offline image was 1 (not at all concerned) to 4\n(extremely concerned). The oldest group's mean was 2.21,\nthe middle group's mean was 2.53, and the youngest group\nhad the highest level of concern with a mean of 2.73. It seems\nthat the older the participants, the less was their level of con-\ncern about the maintenance of their offline (in-person) image.\nThis was expected. However, there was no statistically sig-\nnificant difference when online image alone was analyzed.\nLevel of Personal Disclosure\nWhen age categories were coded into three age groups, the\nresearcher ran ANOVA, LSD, and Bonferonni post hoc tests,\ncant differences between the youngest group aged 18 to\nlooking at levels of personal disclosure posts online.\nThere was a statistically significant difference between\nthe youngest group (18-29 years) and the oldest group (above\nthe age of 46) when rating the level of personal information\nthey post about themselves online (M difference = 0.29, p =\n.001). There was also a statistically significant difference\nbetween the middle group (aged 30-45 years) and the oldest\ngroup (above the age of 46) and their rated level of disclosure\n(M difference = 0.18, p = .04). The oldest group also had a\nstatistically significant difference between both of the other\nThe range of misleading posting was 1 (never post) to\n4 (post a lot).

The\neldest group's mean was 1.58, the middle group's mean was\ngroup that spent the most time on social networking sites.\nThis was expected.\nImage Maintenance:\nCombined Offline and Online\nThis researcher explored the possibility of a statistical sig-\nnificance between age groups (ANOVA), marital status\n(t test), and gender (t test) on a combined image maintenance\nvariable, combining online and offline variables related to\nfound that there were significant differences between the\nyoungest group aged 18 to 29 years and the oldest group\nof image maintenance was 8 to 2.

There was no statistical signifi-\ncance for the group who \"never\" posted misleading informa-\ntion about themselves online.\n\"I'm Rarely Dishonest\"\nThe researcher found that there was a borderline significant\ndifference between the group that \"rarely\" posts misleading\ninformation about themselves (M difference = 0.18, p = .07)\nand their level of trust in others' posts. Statistical signifi-\ncance increased in this group when the researcher looked at\nan increased level of trust (\"frequently\" trusted others online\nwhen they rarely posted misleading information; M differ-\n\"I'm Sometimes Dishonest\"\nStatistical significance increased in the group that admitted\nto \"sometimes\" posting misleading information about them-\nselves (Level 3) when the researcher looked at an increased\nlevel of trust (\"frequently\" trusted others online when they\nsometimes posted misleading information; M difference =\nparticipant reported being frequently dishonest. The high-\nlevel trust group's mean was 1.10, the moderate-level trust\ngroup's mean was 1.34, the rarely trusting group mean was\n1.52, and the never trust others online group mean was 1.00.\nThis was not expected.\nLimitations and Future Research\nFuture studies should aim to gather a more diverse, ran-\ndom racial sample, as this study reflects that of well-\neducated Caucasians albeit those with varying age levels\nrather than a simple undergraduate convenience sample. It\nseems that qualitative answers on this subject matter yield\nmore of a negative theme related to the relationship effect\nof electronic relationship maintenance than do quantitative\nstudies. Thus, exploring how to mitigate some of these\nissues may be helpful especially to those who work in\nfields where participants are directly affected by relation-\nships unraveling, when online infidelity or family drama is\na result of such ways of communicating, or \"catching\"\nloved ones in the act of speaking badly about another or\nmore intimately with another than appropriate. It also\nseems that an overarching theme of reasoning behind using\nsocial networks is a positive one that encompasses the\nsimple need to \"stay in touch with friends and family.\"\nHowever, the actual qualitative statements reflect more\ntrauma of an unexpected type that has an overriding effect\non many people day after day, especially given the perma-\nnence of many items that have gone online, even after user\ndeletion.\nFigure 1. (2009) Most frequently used words to describe the\neffect of online interactions and the effect on participant offline\nrelationships.\nFigure 2. (2012) Most frequently used words to describe the\neffect of online interactions and the effect on participant offline\nrelationships.\nDiscussion\n\"Of Course I Don't Post Too Much\"\nThe most surprising finding in this study was participant\ndenial, for the most part, of posting \"a lot\" of information\nabout themselves online. Overwhelmingly, participants\nstated that they post \"a little.\" This seems to reflect the feel-\ning of participants that posting \"a lot\" must equate to posting\n\"too much\" and one simply does not do that. Most readers\ncan easily tell from their own Facebook friends or other\nsocial networking lists that there are at least a handful that\nconsistently post what most would consider \"too much.\" One\nmay also consider that this participant group answered an\nonline survey that may make them even more likely to have\nfrequent online activity of some sort. Age was also a factor;\nwith increasing age, there was decreased reporting of posting\nfrequency as supported by Hypothesis 3.\nWomen See Things Differently From Men\nWomen in general find it easier to maintain friendships\nonline, as most can see visually on their own Facebook time-\nlines when one weighs in on their own ratio of personal\n\"friend\" posts. However, women are more concerned about\ntheir in-person (offline) image than their male counterparts\nare. This result may not come as a surprise as was supported\nby Hypothesis 4. However, when you shift to online image,\nthere was no difference between genders in their levels of\nconcern about how others viewed them based on their posted\ninformation. In contrast to Hypothesis 1, women found it\neasier to maintain relationships online than their male coun-\nterparts. Furthermore, men were also less likely to trust\ninformation posted by others.\nLeast Likely to Mislead Others\nInterestingly, people aged 30 to 45 years were the least likely\nto post misleading information about themselves online such\nas appearance, interests, and age. This may be due to the fact\nthat this group is less likely to be looking to impress others\n(romantically). This researcher theorized that this may well\nbe that this is the age group more likely to be focused on\nfamily and raising children and perhaps are less likely to be\nconcerned about their online image or finding a mate in con-\ntrast to Hypothesis 5, which would have found participants\naged 30 to 45 years old as more concerned about their image\nthan those ages older than 46 years. However, it seems that\nthe oldest age category has more concern about their image\nthan those in their middle years do.\nWomen aged 30 to 45 years are more likely to be posting\nphotos of their children and other family-related milestones\n(Watkins & Lee, 2010), and men are more likely to post news\nstories of interest. If users are a single parent, they may be\nmore likely to be honest about this information up front to\navoid unwarranted confusion about status and relationship\ntype. Furthermore, it may be that once children leave the\nhome, there is more focus on oneself.\nConcern Level With Offline Versus Online Image\nAlthough there was not a statistically significant difference\naccording to age group among participants when responding\nto the question about their level of concern with their offline\nimage, this is expected to change over time. As people begin\nto realize how terribly permanent their online \"records\" are,\nand who can access them long after a young person has for-\ngotten about things they or \"friends\" have posted on\nFacebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites, they\nhave the potential to come back later in life and effect job\nstatus, interviews, insurance claims, and even personal rela-\ntionships. These types of effects are only beginning to rear\ntheir ugly head in the popular media and have been playing\nthemselves out in divorce cases at staggering rates.\nBeing Dishonest As a Fantasy Buy-In\nOne would expect that if people were purposefully dishonest\nabout themselves, they would be less likely to trust others'\nposted information. However, it seems that the inverse is\ntrue. Perhaps the lack of in-person contact gives a feeling of\nlicense to be a bit more loose with accurate personal infor-\nmation and makes people who do this more willing to go\nalong with others' proffered representations of themselves.\nExperience Equals Less Concern About Image\nMaintenance\nWhether one is talking about linear aging or relationship\nexperience, it seems that experience is an indicator of lessen-\ning anxiety over how one appears to others. Given the per-\nmanent nature of items posted on the Internet, it may be that\nin the future, answers will evolve and change in studies with\nregard to the perceived positive or negative effect of social\nnetworking on relationships. Young adults are building a lon-\nger and more permanent history of actions, opinions, photos,\nactivities, and relationships with more information available\nto potential friends, spouses, and employers that can affect\ntheir present relationships and future opportunities.\nMuch of this may be related to Hypothesis 2, which was\nsupported in this study to reveal that despite ease of use and\nwidespread availability of the newest modes of communica-\ntion to support the maintenance of relationships, as the level\nof intimacy increases, likewise does the desire to communi-\ncate such information in person.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdams, R.
