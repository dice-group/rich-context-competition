Obesity is one of the\nmost important modifiable risk factors for the prevention of\ntype 2 diabetes; however, obesity is an epidemic in the US.\nRecent data from the National Health and Nutrition\nthose aged 60 years or older are obese, defined as a body\nmass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher [2]. Similarly, during a\nPresented as a poster presentation at the American Society for\nMetabolic and Bariatric Surgery on June 24, 2009, Grapevine, Texas.\nN. T. Nguyen (*)\n:X.-M. T. Nguyen\n:J.

Wang\nDepartment of Medicine, University of California,\nIrvine Medical Center,\nOrange, CA, USA\n[3]. Excess weight has been shown to be associated with an\nincreased prevalence of type II diabetes, gastroesophageal\nreflux, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers and\nboth obesity and diabetes are associated with an increased\nrisk for mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease\n[4\u00ad6]. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the\nprevalence of obesity and the state of glycemic control\namong diabetics and (2) examine the association between\nobesity and diabetes in a large cohort of US individuals\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Population\nThe NHANES survey is conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, which is part of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. The NHANES provides cross-\nsectional data on the health and nutrition of the US population.\nThe survey examines a nationally representative complex,\nmultistage probability sample of about 5,000 US civilians\neach year, located within 15 counties across the country. The\nNHANES survey consists of an extensive health information\ninterview, a complete physical examination, and extensive\nlaboratory testing. The physical examinations are performed\nin a mobile examination center. Data from the four latest\nData files extracted for this study included demographic\ninformation, systolic blood pressure measurements, medical\ndisease history, smoking history, and laboratory measures\n(lipid profile and fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and\nhemoglobin A1C levels). Height and weight were measured\nusing standardized protocols. Participants were considered\nto have diabetes mellitus if they were told by their doctor\nthey have diabetes, had a fasting plasma glucose concen-\ntration of 125 mg/dL, had a hemoglobin A1C level of\n6.0%, or use anti-diabetic medication(s) such as insulin or\noral hypoglycemic agents.\nDefinition of Obesity\nBMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters. The National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute's definition for overweight and obesity were\nused to categorize the degree of obesity. A BMI <18.5 was\nwas categorized as normal weight class; a BMI between\nclass 2; and a BMI 40.0 was categorized as obesity class\n3. In this study, we did not differentiate between normal\nweight and underweight classes.\nEndpoints\nWe categorized adults with diabetes according to increasing\nweight classes and also analyzed the levels of fasting\nglucose, insulin, c-peptide, and hemoglobin A1C across the\nclasses of obesity. Among individuals with diabetes, the\nlevels of HbA1c was categorized as good (<7.0%), fair\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC). Due to the NHANES' complex\nprobability sampling of the US population, sample weights,\nstratification, and clustering of the sampling design were\nincorporated into all SAS survey procedures to ensure the\ncorrect estimation of standard errors, confidence intervals, and\nP values. An 8-year sample weight was created according to\nthe NHANES analytic guidelines for the combined 1999\u00ad\n2006 data by assigning one half of the 4-year weight for\nassigning one fourth of the 2-year weight for those\nvariables were used in all analyses. Statistical signifi-\ncance was set at P values <0.05.\nResults\nTable 1 lists the demographics of the study population from\nAmong adults with diabetes, there were 596 individuals\nwith a BMI equal to 40.0. The prevalence of diabetes was\nlowest for the group with BMI <25.0 (8%). The prevalence\nof diabetes almost doubled between normal weight vs.\noverweight class (8% vs. 15%). The prevalence of diabetes\ncontinues to increase with the increasing class of obesity\nand was highest for class 3 obesity (43%).\nAmong adults with diabetes, the prevalence of individ-\nuals considered as overweight or higher (BMI25) was\n80.3%; and the prevalence of obesity or higher (BMI=30)\nwas 49.1%. For the entire cohort of adults with diabetes,\nthe mean hemoglobin A1C level was 7.2\u00b10.0 and the levels\nwere highest for individuals with BMI <25.0. Table 2 lists\nthe changes in levels of hemoglobin A1C, glucose, insulin,\nand c-peptide according to weight classes: the mean fasting\nglucose level was 155\u00b12 mg/dl and the levels were highest\nfor individuals with BMI <30.0; the mean insulin level was\n22\u00b11.0 U/ml and the levels were highest for individuals\nwith BMI equal to 40.0; the mean c-peptide level was 1.2\u00b1\n0.0 nmol/l and the levels were highest for individuals with\nCategories of levels of hemoglobin A1C among diabetic\nindividuals are depicted in Table 3. Of the adults with\ndiabetes, good glycemic control (hemoglobin A1C less than\n7.0%) was observed in 60%; adequate control (hemoglobin\npoor control (hemoglobin A1C >8.0%) was observed in\nDiscussion\nThe major finding of this study is the clear association\nbetween obesity and diabetes in a large, representative\nsample of the US population. In this cross-sectional survey\nof adults with diabetes, the lowest prevalence for diabetes\nwas found in individuals with normal weight (BMI <25.0).\nThe prevalence of diabetes increased throughout the range\nof obesity classes. Nearly a quarter of adults with diabetes\nhave poor glycemic control and nearly half of the\nindividuals with diabetes are considered obese.\nThe prevalence of diabetes from our study is similar to\nthe findings from Cowie and colleagues who reported the\ncrude prevalence of total diabetes in adults age=20 years\nwas 9.6% with another 3.5% of adults at high risk for\ndiabetes with hemoglobin A1C between 6.0% and 6.5%\n[1]. The prevalence of obesity among diabetic in our study\nis much higher than the reported prevalence of obesity in\nthe general US adult population. In our study, the\nprevalence of obesity among adults with diabetes was\n49.1% while Flegal and colleagues reported the prevalence\namong adult women [8]. The glycemic control for\nindividuals with diabetes is improving during the past\ndecade. Saaddine et al. reported that the hemoglobin A1C\nproportion of individuals with hemoglobin A1C level\nbetween 6% and 8% was 77%. Similarly, the mean\nhemoglobin A1C level among individuals with diabetes\nwas reported by Hoerger and colleagues to decrease from\nIn this study, we also found the mean fasting glucose and\nHbA1c levels were highest for diabetics with BMI <25.0,\nTable 1 Characteristics among adults with diabetes according to weight classes, NHANES 1999\u00ad2006\nWeight Classes\nNormal weight Overweight Obesity class 1 Obesity class 2 Obesity class 3 Overall diabetic Non-diabetic\nGender\nTable 2 Changes in hemoglobin A1C, glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels among adults with diabetes according to weight classes, NHANES\nWeight classes\nNormal weight Overweight Obesity class 1 Obesity class 2 Obesity class 3 Overall diabetic Non-diabetic\nsuggesting a state of higher severity of disease. Mean\ninsulin and c-peptide levels were highest for diabetics with\nBMI equal to 35.0, suggesting a state of insulin resistance.\nThese results may suggest that more diabetics within\nnormal weight range have type 1 classification and\ndiabetes in the obese are mostly type 2 with associated\ninsulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes account for 90\u00ad95%\nof those with diabetes and encompasses individuals who\nhave insulin resistance and usually have relative insulin\ndeficiency.\nThe finding of a high prevalence of obesity in adults\nwith diabetes from this study suggests that more effort\nshould be taken to combat obesity since obesity is a\nmodifiable risk factor for the development of diabetes.\nThese efforts should include prevention of obesity in\ncombination with medical and surgical treatments of\nobesity. The look AHEAD trial is one of the largest trials\nof intentional weight loss in diabetics. This is a multi-\ncentered, randomized, controlled trial of 5,145 individuals\nwith type 2 diabetes with BMI >25 who were randomized\nto undergo intensive lifestyle intervention compared with\ndiabetes support and education (control group). Participants\nrandomized to lifestyle intervention lost an average of 8.6%\nof their initial weight compared to 0.7% in the control\ngroup [11]. A greater proportion of the individuals in the\nlifestyle intervention group had reduction in diabetes,\nhypertension, and lipid-lowering medications. The mean\nhemoglobin A1C level improved significantly more in the\nlifestyle intervention than control participants [11]. Bariatric\nsurgery has also been shown to improve and even induce\nremission of diabetes in the morbidly obese. In a large study\non 240 patients with diabetes or have impaired fasting\nglucose levels, Schauer et al. [12] reported that resolution of\ndiabetes was achieved in 83% of patients and patients with a\nshort duration of the disease (<5 years), mildest form of\ndiabetes, and the greatest weight loss were more likely\nto achieve complete remission of diabetes. In a meta-\nof bariatric surgery on diabetes, Buchwald et al.\nreported that 78.1% of diabetic patients had complete\nresolution and diabetes was improved or resolved in\n86.6% of patients; diabetes resolution was greatest for\npatients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal\nswitch, followed by gastric bypass, and least for\nbanding procedures [13]. In addition to the findings of\nimprovement of diabetes with bariatric surgery, several\nrecent studies have shown improved survival rates for\nmorbidly obese individuals who underwent bariatric\nsurgery compared to the control individuals without\nsurgical intervention [14, 15]. Adams and colleagues\nreported a retrospective cohort study comparing 7,925\nmorbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery\nto 7,925 severely obese control subjects and found that the\ncause-specific mortality related to diabetes decreased by\n88% in the surgical group during a mean follow-up of\ncomparing 2,010 severely obese subjects who underwent\nbariatric surgery compared to 2,037 control subjects,\nSjostrom and colleagues reported that the incidence of\ndiabetes was significantly lower within the surgery group\ncompares to control group at 2 and 10 years follow-up\nincidence of diabetes in the control group was 24% while the\nincidence of diabetes in the surgical group was 7% [16]. Lastly,\nprevention of obesity is a key public health initiative in an\nattempt to reduce the incidence of obesity and diabetes risk.\nCurrently, Head Start is the largest federally funded early\nchildhood obesity education program in the United States. In\na survey of 1,583 Head Start programs, Whitaker and\ncolleagues reported that most Head Start programs are doing\nmore to support healthy eating and gross motor activity than\nrequired by federal requirement standards [17].\nOur study shows a clear association between obesity and\ndiabetes, using a large nationwide database. However, there\nare notable limitations in the use and interpretation of this\nobservational data. The NHANES survey is a series of\ncross-sectional analyses of the US population. Therefore,\nlongitudinal data across study years is not provided, and no\ntemporal analyses can be conducted. As with all survey\ndata, there are inherent limitations in the collection\nmethods, which can lead to sampling error, measurement\nerror, and reporting bias.\nConclusions\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate an association\nbetween increasing obesity classes and increasing preva-\nlence of diabetes. Nearly one fourth of adults with diabetes\nhave poor glycemic control and nearly half of adult\ndiabetics are considered obese based on an 8-year period\nthe US adult population.
