Clinically, HAND represents a set of conditions\nranging from subtle neuropsychological impairments to\nprofoundly disabling HIV-associated dementia. Although the\nunderlying mechanisms for HAND pathogenesis are not fully\nunderstood, soluble factors including HIV-1 viral products and\npro-inflammatory mediators released from the infected glia\nand monocytes have been implicated (Ghafouri et al., 2006;\nthe viral products, HIV-1 Tat (transactivator of transcription)\nprotein has been shown to be neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic,\nand it continues to be implicated as a causative agent in HAND\nHIV-1 Tat is a non-structural transcriptional regulator\nessential for the replication of HIV-1. The first exon of HIV-1\nTat encodes the first 72 amino acids and the second exon\nis sufficient for\ntransactivation, which requires the arginine-rich domain of Tat\nbetween amino acid residues 49 and 57. Nanomolar concentra-\ntions of HIV-1 Tat have been reported in sera of HIV-1-infected\npatients, but these levels are almost certainly underestimated,\n1 These authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email jonathan.geiger@med.und.edu).\nAbbreviations: AM, acetoxymethyl ester, Atg5, autophagy-related gene-5; CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor type 4; EEA1, early endosome antigen 1; HAND, HIV-1 associated\nneurocognitive disorder; LAMP1, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1; LC3, light chain 3; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Tat,\ntransactivator of transcription.\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\ngiven how avidly HIV-1 Tat binds to proteins and cells\ntransported across the blood\u00adbrain barrier from the systemic\nby infected macrophages and microglia, and has been detected\nin brain of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia\nHIV-1 Tat enters neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis\nreceptor type 4) (Xiao et al., 2000), heparin sulphate proteoglycans\n(Tyagi et al., 2001) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor-\nevent, which results in the accumulation of HIV-1 Tat in\nendolysosomes from which it can be released into the cytoplasm\nCaron et al., 2004), most probably through the mechanisms\ninvolving the high H+ gradient maintained by vacuolar H+-ATPase\n(Vendeville et al., 2004). The endolysosome system is very dynamic,\nand lysosomes and other acidic sub-cellular compartments are\ninvolved in endocytosis and autophagy (Jeyakumar et al., 2005;\nNixon and Cataldo, 2006). Endosomes and lysosomes process\nproteins and other materials that are endocytosed, whereas\nautophagy predominantly process cytosolic proteins.\nNeurons are highly polarized long-lived post-mitotic cells,\nwhich possess an elaborate endolysosome system critical for\nthe maintenance of neuronal function (Nixon and Cataldo,\nbeen implicated in neuronal damage and in the pathogenesis\nof a variety of neurological disorders including AD\n(Alzheimer's disease), Parkinson's disease and HAND\nSpector, 2008). Here, we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 Tat\ninduces neuronal damage by affecting the structure and\nfunction of endolysosomes. We report that HIV-1 Tat\nenlarged endolysosomes, disrupted endolysosome membrane\nintegrity, elevated endolysosome pH, decreased specific\nactivities of endolysosome enzymes and inhibited autophagy.\nOur findings suggest that the disturbed structure and\nfunction of endolysosomes play an early and important role\nin HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal damage.\nHippocampal neuron primary cultures\nPrimary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared\nfrom embryonic day 18 Sprague\u00adDawley rats as described\npreviously (Buscemi et al., 2007) using a protocol approved\nby the University of North Dakota Animal Care and Use Com-\nmittee adherent with the Guide for the Care and Use\nof Laboratory Animals (NIH publication number 80\u00ad23).\nPregnant dams (embryonic day 18) were killed by\nasphyxiation with CO2\n. The fetuses were removed, decapitated,\nand meninges-free hippocampi were isolated, trypsinized and\nplated on to 35-mm poly-D-lysine-coated glass-bottom tissue\nculture dishes. Neurons were grown in the NeurobasalTM\nmedium with L-glutamine, antibiotic/antimycotic and B27\nsupplement, and were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2\nfor\n10\u00ad14 days at which time they were used for the experimenta-\ntion. Typically, the purity of the neuronal cultures was greater\nthan 95% as determined by neuronal staining with mouse anti-\nNeuN or goat anti-MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2)\nantibodies (Millipore); astrocytes were identified using a mouse\nanti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) antibody (Sigma).\nNeurons were treated either with HIV-1 Tat1\u00ad72\nfrom Dr Avindra Nath, Johns Hopkins University School of\nMedicine, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.), mutant Tat (TatD31\u00ad61\nor PBS as vehicle.\nNeuronal cell viability assay\nNeuronal cell viability was determined using a triple staining\nmethod as described previously (Buscemi et al., 2007).\nethidium homodimer-1 (4 mM) and calcein (1 mg/ml).\nHoechst 33342, which labels DNA, was used as a marker for\nidentifying condensed nuclei characteristic of apoptotic cell\ndeath. Cells dead or dying as a result of loss of membrane\nintegrity were unable to exclude ethidium homodimer-1 dye.\nCells were considered viable when cytoplasm was stained\nwith green fluorescence after the cleavage of the non-\nfluorescent calcein AM (acetoxymethyl ester) to calcein.\nFields were chosen randomly and at least five images from\nfive separate fields of culture dishes for every experimental\ncondition were taken with our Axiovert 200 M fluorescence\nmicroscope (Zeiss) and filter-based imaging system. The\nnumber of dead or dying neurons (ethidium-labelled red\nnuclei and blue-condensed nuclei without green cytoplasmic\nstaining) and total neuron numbers were counted manually.\nMore than 900 neurons were counted per experimental\ncondition. Neuronal viability was reported as a percentage of\ntotal neurons.\nMeasurement of endolysosome pH\nEndolysosome pH was measured using a ratio-metric\nlysosome pH indicator dye (LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-\n160 from Invitrogen); a dual excitation dye that permits pH\nmeasurements in acidic organelles independently of dye\nconcentration. Neurons were loaded with 2 mM LysoSensor\nfor 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Light emitted at 520 nm in response to lex\na filter-based imaging system (Zeiss). The ratios of light\nverted to pH using a calibration curve established using\n10 mM of the H+/Na+ ionophore monensin, and 20 mM of the\nH+/K+ ionophore nigericin dissolved in 20 mM Mes, 110 mM\nL.

After treatments,\nneurons were loaded with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (50 nM,\nInvitrogen) and calcein AM (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) for 30 min\nat 37\u00b0C. Fields were chosen at random and at least five\nimages from every experimental condition were acquired by\nconfocal microscopy (Olympus). The sizes of endolysosomes\n(LysoTracker) were analysed with the particle-analysing\nprogram in Image J software. For measurement of Tat\nendocytosis, neurons were incubated with FITC\u00adTat (100 nM,\nAnaSpec) for 1 day at 37\u00b0C, followed by loading of\n(10 mg/ml) for an additional 30 min. Images were taken with\nan Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).\nImmunocytochemistry\nNeurons were fixed with cold methanol (220\u00b0C) for 10 min,\nwashed with PBS, blocked with 5% goat serum, and\nincubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies targeting\nSanta Cruz) or LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane\nprotein-1; 1:500, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma). After washing\nwith PBS, neurons were incubated with Alexa FluorH 546-\nconjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen). Neurons\nwere examined by confocal microscopy (Olympus). Controls\nfor specificity included staining neurons with primary\nantibodies without fluorescence-conjugated secondary anti-\nbodies (background controls) and staining neurons with only\nsecondary antibodies.\nEndolysosome membrane permeability\nEndolysosome membrane permeability was determined by mea-\nsuring the leakage of endolysosome fluorescent dye Lucifer\nYellow CH (Invitrogen). Neurons were incubated with\nLucifer Yellow (100 mg/ml) for 16 h, followed by incubation\nwith Tat at 37\u00b0C for 1 and 2 days. Levels of dye inside of neurons\nwere detected by confocal microscopy (Olympus).\nImmunoblotting\nNeurons were lysed with RIPA buffer (Pierce) containing\nprotease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After centrifugation\nand protein concentrations were determined with a DC\nprotein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins (10 mg)\nwere separated by SDS/12% PAGE, and, following transfer,\nPVDF membranes (Millipore) were incubated overnight at\nmouse monoclonal, Abcam), anti-cathepsin B (1:500, mouse\nmonoclonal, Sigma), anti-cathepsin D (1:1000, mouse mono-\npolyclonal, Abcam), anti-Atg5 (autophagy-related gene-5;\nrabbit polyclonal, Sigma) antibodies; anti-b-actin (1:10000,\nmouse monoclonal, Abcam) antibody was used as a gel-\nloading control. The blots were developed with enhanced\nchemiluminescence, and bands were visualized and analysed\nby LabWorks 4.5 software on a BioSpectrumH imaging System\n(UVP). Quantification was performed by densitometry and the\nresults were analysed as total integrated densitometric\nvolume values (arbitrary units).\nMeasurement of activities of endolysosome\nenzymes\nEnzyme activities of acid phosphatase were determined using an\nacid phosphatase assay kit (Sigma); a luminescence-based assay\nthat uses 4-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Chen et al.,\n2010). Enzyme activities of cathepsins D and B were determined\nusing assay kits (BioVision); fluorescence-based assays that used\ncathepsin D or cathepsin B preferred substrates labelled with\nMCA (Chen et al., 2010). Enzyme activities were expressed as\nabsorbance per 10 mg of protein. Specific activities of each\nenzyme were expressed as a ratio of enzyme activity to protein\nlevels as determined by immunoblotting.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were expressed as means\u00a1S.E.M. Statistical signifi-\ncance for multiple comparisons was determined by one-way\nANOVA plus a Tukey post hoc test. P,0.05 was considered to\nbe statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nIn order to compare the effects of HIV-1 Tat on neuronal\ndamage and the structure and function of endolysosomes, we\nneeded to first determine the time course and extent to\nwhich HIV-1 Tat decreased neuronal viability.

These data were consistent with previous\nstudies that have shown similar neurotoxic effects of HIV-1\net al., 2007). No statistically significant increases in neuronal\ncell death were observed with either mutant TatD31\u00ad61\nor PBS,\nconsistent with previous reports that this deletion mutant of\nTat is not directly toxic to neurons (Buscemi et al., 2007).\nIn neurons and other cells, HIV-1 Tat uses receptor-\nmediated endocytotic mechanisms (Liu et al., 2000; Vendeville\naccumulates first in endolysosomes.

After\nincubating neurons with the FITC-labelled HIV-1 Tat47\u00ad57\nTat), we observed significant intracellular accumulation of\nFITC-Tat, which was mainly compartmentalized in endolyso-\nsomes as identified with LysoTracker dye (red, Figure 2A).\nSince alterations in the structure and function of\nendolysosomes have been implicated in the neuropathogen-\nesis of a number of neurological disorders, we next\ndetermined the extent to which HIV-1 Tat-affected endoly-\nsosome morphology. In living neurons, we identified endolyso-\nsomes with LysoTracker, and we found that treatment\nwith HIV-1 Tat for 1 and 2 days increased significantly\nTreatment with mutant Tat did not affect endolysosome\nmorphology (L. Hiu, X. Chen and J.D. Geiger, unpublished data).\nUsing immunocytochemistry methods, we found that endo-\nsomes labelled with EEA1 antibody and lysosomes labelled with\nLAMP1 antibody were relatively small and evenly distributed in\nneurons treated with PBS or mutant Tat, but were markedly\nenlarged and clumped together in HIV-1 Tat-treated neurons\n(Figure 2B, middle and bottom panels).\nFigure 2 HIV-1 Tat-altered the structure of neuronal endolysosomes\n(A) HIV-1 Tat is accumulated in endolysosomes of primary cultured neurons.

We found that HIV-1 Tat, but not mutant Tat\ntreatment for 1 or 2 days elevated significantly (n520,\nP,0.001) endolysosome pH in cultured hippocampal neurons\n(Figure 3). As endolysosome pH affects endolysosome enzyme\nactivity, we next determined the protein levels and activity of\nendolysosome enzymes as evaluations of endolysosome\nfunction.

We found that while control neurons displayed a\ndiscrete punctate pattern of perinuclear fluorescent staining\n(Figure 5), HIV-1 Tat-treated neurons displayed increased\nendolysosome membrane leakage as evidenced by diffuse\nfluorescent staining (Figure 5) in the cytoplasm.\nEndolysosomes also function to control autophagy, a\nprocess important for normal physiological functions of\nneurons. Dysfunctions in autophagy have been implicated in\nthe pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders\n(Wong and Cuervo, 2010) including HAND (Alirezaei et al.,\non the findings that HIV-1 Tat disrupts autophagy in immune\ncells (Van Grol et al., 2010), we determined the extent to\nwhich HIV-1 Tat-affected autophagy in primary cultured\nhippocampal neurons.

However, this increased lifespan is accompanied by\nincreased prevalence of HAND, which affects up to 50% of\npeople with HIV-1 infection (Ellis et al., 2010; Heaton et al.,\nFigure 5 HIV-1 Tat-disrupted endolysosome membrane integrity\nEndolysosome membrane integrity was evaluated by measuring the leakage\nof Lucifer Yellow dye.

The underlying mechanisms for HAND pathogenesis\nare not fully understood, but one mechanism that appears to\nbe important yet relatively understudied is the involvement\nof endolysosomes. Disturbed endolysosomes have been noted\nin brain of HIV-1-infected individuals (Gelman et al., 2005;\nmechanisms for these pathological observations are not\nknown. Since neurons are long-lived post-mitotic cells with\nextreme polarity, they possess an elaborate endolysosome\nsystem that contains hydrolases that degrade macromole-\ncules, high concentrations of readily releasable calcium\nand Docampo, 2010), and high concentrations of potentially\nWhen dysfunctional, endolysosomes can contribute to altered\ncalcium homoeostasis (Korkotian et al., 1999; Pelled et al.,\n(Pivtoraiko et al., 2009). Disruptions in endolysosome\nfunctions perturb numerous cellular functions and can\nultimately result in the initiation of cell death pathways\nof potential significance to further understand the patho-\ngenesis of HAND that we found that HIV-1 Tat-enlarged\nendolysosomes, elevated endolysosome pH, decreased specific\nactivities of endolysosome enzymes, disrupted endolysosome\nmembrane integrity and inhibited autophagy, all of which\noccurred prior to significant increases in HIV-1 Tat-induced\nneuronal cell death. Thus, the altered structure and function\nof endolysosomes could underlie, at least in part, the\npathogenesis of HAND.\nHIV-1 Tat protein continues to be implicated in the\npathogenesis of HAND, in part, because there is significant\nneuronal dysfunction even though neurons are not infected\nTat has been shown to, for example, activate NMDA (N-\nmethyl-D-aspartate) receptors (Nath et al., 2000; Haughey\nsecreted by infected glial cells and, following binding to\nneuronal cell surface receptors, it enters the endolysosome\nsystem following receptor-mediated endocytosis (Mann and\ndetermine the extent to which previously identified receptors\nmediate the endocytosis of HIV-1 Tat in neurons, including\nsulphate proteoglycans (Tyagi et al., 2001), and the LDL\nreceptor-related protein (Liu et al., 2000; Deshmane et al.,\n2011), we did observe the presence of HIV-1 Tat in neuronal\nendolysosomes.\nNeurons are long-lived post-mitotic cells that possess an\nelaborate endolysosome system to exercise quality control.\nSubstrates for degradation are delivered to lysosomes by two\ngeneral routes: endocytosis and autophagy. Endocytosis is not\nonly responsible for taking up extracellular nutrients, but also\nis responsible for maintaining the integrity of axons and\nsynapses because neurons are extremely polar cells with\nespecially large volumes of cytoplasm. In contrast, autophagy\nis responsible for removing unwanted cytosolic proteins and\nAlterations in the structure and function of neuronal\nendolysosomes have been noted in HAND (Gelman et al.,\nbecause HIV-1 Tat can accumulate in neuronal endolyso-\nsomes, we determined the extent to which HIV-1 Tat\ndisturbed neuronal endolysosome structure and function.\nWe demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat disturbed endolysosomes\nand inhibited autophagy as indicated by changes to marker\nproteins. There exist three types of autophagy in cells: macro-\nautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autop-\nhagy. As the best-studied type of autophagy, macroauto-\nphagy includes three stages such as autophagosome\nmembrane origination, autophagosome formation and auto-\nlysosome formation. Accordingly, we focused our studies of\nthe effects of HIV-1 Tat on macroautophagy using three\nmarkers: LC3 which mediates the initiation process of\n(Winslow and Rubinsztein, 2008), Atg5 which drives the\ninhibits autophagy (Ichimura and Komatsu, 2010; Bjorkoy\nHIV-1 Tat directly affects the morphology and function of\nendolysosomes and autophagy.\nLow pH is critical for the degradation of internalized\nmaterials, the trafficking and fusion of endolysosomes and\nthe formation of autophagy (Marshansky and Futai, 2008;\nthe observed changes might be the ability of HIV-1 Tat\nto elevate endolysosome pH. Our observations of elevated\nendolysosome pH could help to explain alterations in the\ndigestive capability of endolysosomes as evidenced by\ndecreased specific activities of three different endolysosome\nenzymes, which results in increased accumulation of inter-\nnalized material thus altering the structure and size of\nendolysosomes. In addition, elevation of endolysosome pH\ncould result in alterations in the trafficking and fusion of\nendolysosomes (Hart and Young, 1991; Saftig and Klumperman,\n2009). Furthermore, elevation of endolysosome pH could result\nin alterations in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes\n(Kawai et al., 2007) thus inhibiting autophagy. Together,\nelevation of endolysosome pH could exaggerate neuronal injury\nand degeneration (Wong and Cuervo, 2010), and contribute\ndirectly to HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity.\nAlthough the underlying mechanisms whereby HIV-1 Tat\nelevates endolysosome pH are unknown, the arginine-rich\ndomain of HIV-1 Tat between amino acid residues 49 and 57\ncould be responsible for HIV-1 Tat-induced elevation of\nendolysosome pH because a series of other arginine-rich\npeptides including penetratin, an amino acid domain from\nthe Antennapedia protein (sequences 43\u00ad58) of Drosophila,\na flock house virus coat peptide (sequences 35\u00ad49) and oligo-\narginines (R9) all have the ability to elevate endolysosome\nEndolysosomes and HIV-1 Tat neurotoxicity\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\npH (L. Hui, X. Chen and J. D. Geiger, unpublished data). It has\nbeen shown that most of these arginine-rich peptides have\nthe ability to escape endolysosomes using the high proton\nwe postulate that a proton-dependent peptide transporter\nmight be present on endolysosome membranes. Such a\npeptide transporter could transport HIV-1 Tat out of\nendolysosomes, and during the transporting process protons\nleak out and endolysosome pH is elevated. Another way that\nHIV-1 Tat could increase pH is by directly disrupting the\nmembrane integrity of endolysosomes and this is consistent\nwith our observations of increased leakage of Lucifer Yellow\ndye into cytosol. Consistent with these findings are previous\nreports that low pH induces the exposure of a highly\nconserved tryptophan residue and allows the insertion of HIV-\n1 Tat into endolysosome membranes (Yezid et al., 2009).\nFurthermore, disrupted endolysosome membrane integrity per\nse could lead to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately cell death\nbecause the increased endolysosome membrane permeability\noccurs in several models of apoptosis (Roberg and Ollinger,\napoptotic cascade that precedes destabilization of mitochon-\ndria and caspase activation (Kroemer and Jaattela, 2005; Kurz\net al., 2008). These potential mechanisms warrant further\ninvestigation.\nOur finding that HIV-1 Tat disturbed the structure and\nfunction of endolysosomes in primary cultured neurons prior\nto any significant increase in HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity\nsuggests that the effects of HIV-1 Tat on endolysosomes may\ncause considerable neuronal dysfunction. Further elucidation\nof the involvement of endolysosomes in HAND might lead\nto the design of novel therapeutic strategies, including\nblocking the entry of HIV-1 Tat into endolysosomes and block-\ning HIV-1 Tat-induced elevation of endolysosome pH.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by the National Center for Research\nNational Institutes of Health.\nREFERENCES\nAgrawal L, Louboutin JP, Reyes BA, Van Bockstaele EJ, Strayer DS (2012) HIV-1\nTat neurotoxicity: a model of acute and chronic exposure, and neuroprotec-\nAksenov MY, Hasselrot U, Wu G, Nath A, Anderson C, Mactutus CF, Booze RM\n(2003) Temporal relationships between HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal\ndegeneration, OX-42 immunoreactivity, reactive astrocytosis, and protein\nAksenov MY, Hasselrot U, Bansal AK, Wu G, Nath A, Anderson C, Mactutus CF,\nBooze RM (2001) Oxidative damage induced by the injection of HIV-1 Tat\nprotein in the rat striatum.
