In the current research, we shine the spotlight on what happens between a grateful person and the benefactor to\nilluminate what can build a bridge between them. Specifically, we draw on work calling gratitude an ``other-praising'' emotion. In an\noriginal study and a conceptual replication that included two independent samples, couples had video-recorded conversations in\nwhich one member expressed gratitude to the other (n \u00bc 370). Expresser's other-praising behavior was robustly positively\nassociated with the benefactor's postinteraction perception of expresser responsiveness, personal good feelings in general, and\nfelt loving in particular. Several practical and theoretical alternative explanations are ruled out. By clarifying the specific behavioral\nand subjective psychological mechanisms through which expressed gratitude promotes relationships, this work advances affective\nand relationship science, two domains that cut across disciplines within psychology.\n",

Kurtz1, and Nicole M. Hilaire2\n Keywords\nexpressed gratitude, perceived responsiveness, interpersonal processes, observed behavior, romantic relationships, emotion\nGratitude is a positively valenced emotion that can arise when\nanother person--a benefactor--does something kind for the self.\nAlthough positive emotions in general are thought to build inter-\npersonal relationships through momentarily broadened cogni-\ntions (Fredrickson, 1998; Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, &\nFinkel, 2008), recent work suggests a unique and more direct\npath to beneficial relational outcomes through the specific emo-\ntion of gratitude (Algoe & Haidt, 2009; Algoe, Haidt, & Gable,\n2008). Particularly, theory positions gratitude as having evolved\nto help solve a central problem of human survival: identifying\nhigh-quality relationship partners and keeping them interested\nin the relationship (Algoe, 2012). That is, gratitude helps one\nto find new or remind one of current good relationship partners\nand to bind the two more strongly together. Now, the pressing\nquestion is, ``How?'' Here, we go back to basics, starting with\ntheory about what sets gratitude apart from other related positive\nemotional states as well as the behavior that is most proximal to\nthe experience of the emotion, its expression. We suggest and\nprovide the first direct test of whether the theorized ``other-prais-\ning'' feature of gratitude is central to its implications for building\nsocial bridges.\nGratitude and Social Outcomes\nGiven prior theory and evidence, many researchers in the\nbroader social and personality psychology literature would\nlikely base predictions about how expressed gratitude may\ninfluence a relationship partner simply on the fact that it is pos-\nitive in valence (see Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory of\nresearchers specifically within the relationships literature as\nwell as the emotions literature. However, moving beyond gen-\neral positive valence, Algoe recently paired insights from the\nemotions literature that differentiate gratitude from other posi-\ntive emotions (e.g., Algoe & Haidt, 2009) with insights from\nthe relationships literature differentiating among relationship\nnorms (e.g., Clark & Mills, 2011) to formally propose that the\npositive emotion of gratitude is uniquely suited for promoting\nrelationships with high-quality relationship partners (2012).\nImportantly, the theory pushes for specificity of interpersonal\nmechanisms and calls for data from the target of one's grati-\ntude, the original benefactor.\nFor example, this find-remind-and-bind theory hypothesizes\nthat a grateful person will draw in a benefactor by demonstrat-\ning responsiveness to the benefactor's needs (Algoe, 2012).\n1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA\n2 University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSara B.

Importantly, these results\nheld even when controlling for or comparing to perceptions of\nthe partner's responsiveness in other validated relationship-\nrelevant social interactions in the lab, including one that was also\npositive in valence: There is something unique about expressed\ncurrent work, we put a grateful person and his or her benefactor\nin the room together and observe what transpires between them\nto address what that might be.\nIs Other-Praising the Active Relational Ingredient\nin Expressed Gratitude?\nFollowing a formative review of the psychological literature on\ngratitude (McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, & Larson, 2001),\nHaidt took the novel approach of considering the place of gra-\ntitude within the positive emotion family (2003). Specifically,\nbuilding on a prior attribution model of emotions (Ortony,\nClore, & Collins, 1988), he called gratitude one of the other-\npraising emotions (2003). This is because gratitude was charac-\nterized as an emergent property of two attributions about the\nsituation: That there had been a positive outcome for the self\n(the core attribution for joy) and that the outcome was caused\nby the praiseworthy actions of another (the core attribution for\nNotably, this means that a very closely related positive emo-\ntional state to gratitude is ``joy'' or ``happiness'' at receiving a\npositive outcome for the self. Because happiness has been used\nas the generic stand-in for ``positive emotion'' in the majority\nof prior research, it is already known that the expression of gen-\neral positive emotions has effects on perceivers that may make\nthe expresser more attractive as an interaction partner. For\nexample, those perceived to be happy (e.g., via a smile) are\nrated as more likeable, kinder, are more likely to be helped, and\nmay even make social partners happy (see review in Clark &\nMonin, 2014). Intriguingly, some of these outcomes--likeable,\nkinder, and more likely to be helped--have also been found in\nexperimental research that compares effects of receiving a\n``thank you'' versus not receiving a thank you (Grant & Gino,\nconsequences of gratitude expressions simply due to the fact\nthat the expressions are positively valenced?\nEmpirical work comparing joy to gratitude provides clues\nabout differentiation. This work suggests that the grateful expe-\nrience may be accompanied by other-praising behavior, which,\nin turn, may help account for the unique relational trajectory of\ngratitude (Algoe & Haidt, 2009). Critical analyses relied on\nrecalled joy (and gratitude) narratives, in which someone else\ncaused the positive outcome for the participant--that is, a ben-\nefactor was identified by the participant. Even still, participants\nin the gratitude condition were more likely than those in the joy\ncondition to spontaneously report having seen new positive\nqualities in their benefactors, were more likely to thank and hug\ntheir benefactor, and reported singing the praises of the bene-\nfactor to third parties (Study 1). In the current work, we capi-\ntalize on the recently used expressed gratitude paradigm\n(e.g., Algoe et al., 2013) to test for the first time whether\nother-praising behavior of the grateful person can account for\nkey relationship-promoting outcomes for the benefactor. Criti-\ncally, we are able to statistically account for other positive\nexpressive behavior that would be similar to expressing one's\njoy, providing a conservative test of the unique relational value\nof other-praising behavior (Algoe & Haidt, 2009).\nExamining the Social Interaction\nEmotional expressions are theoretically the most proximal\nbehavior to the experience of an emotion and the inputs to an\nemotional experience are thought to shape its output (Lerner\n& Keltner, 2000). As such, we assume we can observe each\ntheorized input component of gratitude--perceived benefits\nto the self and the praiseworthiness of the other's actions\nwithin video-recorded verbal expressions of gratitude. As ini-\ntial evidence, previous research has documented that expres-\nsers do spontaneously use other-praising behavior within\nthese conversations (Algoe & Way, 2014).\nOur primary outcome for these conversations, based on the-\nory and recent findings (e.g., Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016), is the\nbenefactor's perception of expresser responsiveness. As indi-\ncated, perceived responsiveness is comprised of feeling under-\nstood, validated, and cared for (Reis et al., 2004). Praising\noffers direct validation of the person's actions, so we see\nother-praising behavior as a relatively direct way that respon-\nsiveness can be conveyed. Moreover, testing this, while\naccounting for other expressed positive emotion, operationa-\nlized here as expressing benefits to the self (akin to expressed\njoy/happiness), would provide an important first step toward\ndocumenting that the relational consequences of expressed gra-\ntitude are not simply explained by its positive valence.\nAdditionally, we examine the benefactor's positive emo-\ntions as a secondary outcome. As reviewed earlier, momentary\npositive emotions are theorized to lay a foundation for growth\nin social resources (see Fredrickson, 1998), so they may pro-\nvide an additional path for social consequences from expressed\ngratitude. As such, following recent work (Algoe & Way,\n2014), we examine an aggregated measure of positive emotions\nand one that is theoretically relevant in this context--felt lov-\ning (see Gonzaga, Turner, Keltner, Campos, & Altemus,\n2006). We expect that hearing praise for one's behavior will\nmake one feel happy (i.e., general positive emotions) and lov-\ning. Simultaneously, positive emotions have long been\ntheorized as ``contagious'' (see Fowler & Christakis, 2008;\nHatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1993), and in this context,\nlearning that one's kind gesture hit the mark may feel good\n(e.g., Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2008). As such, our exploration\nof whether self-benefit expression is positively associated with\nthe benefactor's positive emotions after the conversation pro-\nvides additional contributions to the broader literature.\nThe Current Research\nIn Study 1, we use a tightly controlled design to test whether\nother-praising behavior, independent from a focus on benefits\nto the self within the same conversation, uniquely predicts the\nbenefactor's subjective experience. Then, we conceptually\nreplicate these findings using an integrated data analysis (Cur-\nran & Hussong, 2009) of two similar but independent studies.\nThere, we also measure the benefactor's perception of expres-\nser's positive emotions. Each study addresses several theoreti-\ncally and practically derived alternative explanations.\nParticipants and Procedure\nWithin a larger observational study, each member of 73 hetero-\nsexual couples (n \u00bc 146) from the region surrounding Chapel\nHill, NC, attended a lab session during which they each\nexpressed gratitude to the other for a recent event (see Algoe\net al., 2013, for original description of this sample). Of these\nconversations, 131 were possible to code for expresser beha-\nvior (2 were not recorded due to procedural error; 13 more were\nnot coded due to poor sound quality). These individuals and\ntheir partners are considered in the current analysis. Approxi-\nmately half the couples were dating (55.1%) and the others\nreported formal commitment through engagement, long-term\ncohabitation, or marriage (44.9%); relationship length varied\ntogether. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 57 (M \u00bc\n(77.1%) and non-Hispanic (96.9%). Sample size in the original\nstudy was set with a goal of recruiting 80 couples (n \u00bc 160);\nhere, it was determined by number of videos available for\ncoding.\nIn the lab, participants were asked to pick something their\npartner had done for them recently, for which they felt grateful.\nAfter each person selected the event and rated its importance,\none person was randomly chosen to speak first. After the con-\nversation, they both rated their emotions and perceptions of\npartner responsiveness before repeating with the other partner's\nevent; order was counterbalanced.\nMeasures\nSelf-report measures. Measures to be used in analyses completed\nprior to the conversation include self-reported global relation-\nimportance of the event for which the expresser felt grateful,\nfrom 0 (not at all important) to 6 (extremely important), and the\ntarget's self-reported general perception of expresser respon-\nsiveness in the relationship not tied to a specific instance of\nbehavior; instructions began, ``The statements below reflect\ndifferent aspects of your relationship.'' This 18-item scale was\nan earlier version of one later reduced to 12 (Reis, Maniaci,\nCaprariello, Eastwick, & Finkel, 2011; a \u00bc .90). Immediately\nafter the conversation, the target of the expression rated the\nextent to which the expresser was responsive within the social\n``interaction here during this laboratory visit'' (Gable, Gon-\na \u00bc .94). Targets also reported their positive emotions as a\nresult of the conversation by rating the following 11 items on\na scale ranging from 0 (not at all true/never true) to 6 (very\ntrue/true all of the time): satisfied, loving, warm, appreciative,\nadmiring, peaceful, open, amused, grateful, proud, and\ninspired. The average was computed to represent general pos-\nitive emotions (a \u00bc .89); to explore specificity, we targeted one\nfrom theory: love.\nTwo targets provided extreme values that were more than\nthree SDs below the mean on perceived responsiveness and are\nnot included in analyses using this measure as the dependent\nvariable. See Supplemental Online Material (SOM) for results\nof analyses that include these participants.1\nCoding behavior within gratitude expressions. People expressed\nthanks for everything from making banana pudding to being\nthere for the grateful partner through a hospital stay. The con-\nversations contained many positively valenced statements by\nthe expressers. The behavioral coding systems developed for\nthis study, to identify statements within the expression of gra-\ntitude focused on praising the others' actions and statements\nfocused on benefits to the self, draw from emotion theory\nTwo teams of four coders--one team for each behavior--\nwatched each video with sound. They rated the focal behavior\non a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 \u00bc no or minor use of the\nbehavior to 5 \u00bc excellent example or major use of the behavior.\nMore information about scale development and coder training\ncan be found in the OSM. Examples of other-praising state-\nments include, ``You know I'm a big flowers person,'' `` . . .\nshows how responsible you are . . . ,'' ``You go out of your\nway . . . ,'' and ``I feel like you're really good at that.'' Examples\nof self-benefit statements include, ``It let me relax,'' ``It gave me\nbragging rights at work,'' ``I can study and spend time with you\nat the same time, which is great for me,'' and ``It makes me\nhappy.'' An average of the judges' scores is used for each beha-\nvioral code for any given clip. Other-praising ratings ranged\nfrom 1.25 to 5.00 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] \u00bc\nResults\nAll regressions were run using multilevel models with person\n(Level 1) nested within couple (Level 2) in the HLM software\n660 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(7)\n(Raudenbush, Byrk, Cheong, & Congdon, 1996). This\napproach takes into account the fact that the couple members\nare likely to be similar in their ratings on the dependent\nmeasures.\nDescriptive Information\nUse of other-praising behavior was correlated positively within\nrelations among all study variables. Notably, within person,\nother-praising behavior was not correlated with self-benefit\nbehavior.\nPrimary Analyses\nConclusions from the correlations held in multilevel models\nusing either behavior to independently predict any of the three\ndependent measures. As such, for brevity, we only display\nresults of the subsequent analysis: Table 2 shows that the\nexpresser's other-praising behavior continued to predict tar-\nget's perception of expresser responsiveness, general positive\nemotions, and the specific emotion of loving, even when con-\ntrolling for the expresser's self-benefit\u00adfocused behavior.\nAddressing Alternative Explanations\nMultilevel models including the predictors of expresser other-\npraising and expresser focus on self-benefit, as well as either\nconversation duration, expresser's indication of event impor-\ntance, expresser or target relationship satisfaction, or target's\ngeneral perception of expresser responsiveness continued to\nyield significant positive associations between expresser\nother-praising behavior and the target's perception of expresser\nresponsiveness (ps < .02). Further, they did not reveal a sup-\npression effect for self-benefit focus (i.e., this negative coeffi-\ncient did not reverse signs or become statistically significant,\nps > .096). The same pattern of effects held for the target's gen-\neral positive emotions and the specific emotion, loving (ps for\nother praising < .04; ps for self-benefit > .250). These analyses\nTable 1.

In Study 2, we also address\nconversation-specific perceptions of the target.\nStudy 1 demonstrated ample support for the hypothesis that\nother-praising behavior is the relationally active ingredient in\nexpressions of gratitude: When expressers used more other-\npraising behavior, their benefactors perceived them as more\nresponsive, benefactors felt good in general and more loving\nin particular. In Study 2, we tested for conceptual replication.\nTo do so, we pooled two data sets that used the same in-lab pro-\ncedure for the video recording and rating of an expressed gra-\ntitude conversation, this time with only one member of the\ncouple expressing. Although meta-analysis has garnered sup-\nport in the literature (see Cummings, 2013), Curran and Hus-\nsong note that this approach is best when the original data\nare unavailable (2009). With access to all available data, how-\never, they suggest use of integrated data analysis, which is what\nwe do here.\nAdditionally, we ask the target about perceived positive\nemotions of the expresser, which contributes in two ways. First,\nalthough each behavioral code was defined as conveying pos-\nitive emotion, there is not corroborating evidence to validate\nthis assumption. As such, we use correlations to test whether\ntargets perceive greater positive emotions when coders gave\nhigher ratings on each behavior. Second, one recent study pos-\nited that warmth conveyed by a thank you accounts for its\neffects on the benefactor (Williams & Bartlett, 2015), and the\nother-praising code (developed and implemented prior to that\npublication) incorporates conveyed warmth. Here, we statisti-\ncally account for the target's perception of warmth in the\nexpression, thereby testing whether the other-praising content\ncontinues to account for unique variance in benefactor out-\ncomes, beyond the warmth it conveys.\nParticipants and Procedure\nHeterosexual couples were recruited from the greater Chapel\nHill, NC, region for a study on ``everyday couple interactions.''\nThe couple must have been together for at least 1 year (see\nOSM for additional information). Both members of 257 cou-\nples (n \u00bc 514) attended this lab session together. Most couples\nwere dating exclusively (68.3%), with most others reporting a\nformally committed relationship (31.4%); 54% were living\ntogether. On average, participants were about 25 years old\nProcedure for expressed gratitude task. A primary goal of these\nstudy designs was to test the current hypothesis through experi-\nmental manipulation. As such, only one randomly assigned\nmember of the couple expressed gratitude to the other in the\nlaboratory. However, the manipulation did not produce\nchanges in target perceptions of responsiveness, so we do not\nconsider it further here other than to control for condition in\nstatistical analyses (see OSM for more information regarding\nthe manipulation). Sample size for these studies originally was\ndetermined with the goal of at least 60 couples in each of two\nconditions to provide 78% power to detect a medium-sized\neffect with an independent-samples t test at p < .05, two-\ntailed. In Sample A, we ran additional couples in case of miss-\ning data; in Sample B, we ran additional couples to further\nincrease power; data collection ended when the grant period\nended. Critically, together in the lab room, the procedures were\nthe same as in Study 1. Prior to leaving the lab, couples were\ndebriefed about the nature of the experiment.\nMeasures\nSelf-report measures. As in Study 1, the expresser's and target's\ninitial measure of relationship satisfaction (a \u00bc .88, .84, respec-\ntively) and the target's initial measure of perceptions of general\nresponsiveness in the relationship (12 items; Reis et al., 2011;\na \u00bc .94) were control variables in additional analyses as was\nexpresser's rated importance of the selected event. Again, the\ntarget's postinteraction reported perceptions of expresser\nresponsiveness was the primary dependent measure (a \u00bc\n.93), with general positive emotions (a \u00bc .89) and the specific\nemotion, loving, as secondary outcomes. In this study, targets\nalso rated their perception of the expresser's emotions during\nand as a result of the interaction, using the same items and scale\nas used for rating their own emotions. To test whether the tar-\ngets picked up on the general positivity in each behavior\nobserved by the coders, the nine nongratitude items were\naggregated (a \u00bc .84). One item--perceived warm feelings--\nwas used as an additional theoretically derived situation-\nspecific control variable.\nRegarding the primary and secondary outcome measures,\nsix targets provided extreme values that were more than three\nSDs below the mean on perceived responsiveness, four on gen-\neral positive emotions, and five for loving; they are not\nincluded in analyses using the relevant measure as the depen-\ndent variable. See OSM for results of analyses including these\nparticipants. One rating of general positive emotions and lov-\ning as well as expresser responsiveness was not provided.\nBehavioral coding. Other-praising behavior and self-benefit\nbehavior in the interactions were coded from the videos of the\nconversation using the same definitions as in Study 1. In Sam-\nple A, across all expressers and averaged across four coders,\nother-praising behavior ratings ranged from 1.25 to 5 (ICC \u00bc\n(ICC \u00bc .915). In Sample B, across all expressers, other-\npraising behavior ratings averaged across four coders ranged\n662 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(7)\naveraged across three coders ranged from 1 to 4.33 (ICC \u00bc\n.841). Because the composition of coding teams differed in the\ntwo samples, each behavioral variable was standardized within\nstudy prior to pooling the data set.\nProcedural errors. Due to technical and procedural errors in Sam-\nple A, information about condition instructions provided to\nfour expressers is missing; in one additional couple, both mem-\nbers mistakenly heard the instructions intended for the expres-\nser. Because we control for condition in analyses, data from\nthese conversations were not included in the final sample. This\ntype of error did not exist for Sample B.\nResults of Conceptual Replication Analyses\nDescriptive information. See Table 3 for means, SDs, and corre-\nlations among all variables as used. As in Study 1, although\nmost expressers engaged in both behaviors in the conversation,\nexpresser's use of other-praising behavior was uncorrelated\nwith use of self-benefit behavior.\nValidation: Perceived expresser emotion. The correlations pre-\nsented in Table 3 confirm that, consistent with the definition\nof the codes as conveying positive emotions, targets were more\nlikely to perceive positive emotions in expressers with higher\nscores on either behavioral code.\nPrimary analyses. As seen in Table 3, the basic correlation\nbetween expresser other-praising behavior and target's percep-\ntion of expresser responsiveness supports the primary study\nhypothesis: Targets perceived greater expresser responsiveness\nwhen the expresser used more praising behavior. In contrast,\nthere was no association between expresser use of self-\nbenefit behavior and the target's perception of expresser\nresponsiveness. The target's ratings of general positive\nemotions and the specific experience of love showed similar\ndissociated patterns, such that they were higher when the\nexpresser used more other-praising behavior but were not asso-\nciated with the expresser's use of self-benefit behavior.\nTable 2 shows the results of three linear regression models,\none predicting each outcome of interest from expresser other-\npraising behavior and self-benefit behavior simultaneously,\nwhile controlling for study and condition. Conclusions do not\nchange from the correlational analyses.2\nAddressing alternative explanations. We note that the correlation\nbetween the target's perception of expresser warmth during the\nconversation and expresser praising behavior as well as each\ndependent measure is significant and positive. Nonetheless,\nas with Study 1 analyses, controlling for conversation duration,\nexpresser or target satisfaction with the relationship, expres-\nser's rated importance of the gratitude event, target's general\nperception of expresser responsiveness, or the target's percep-\ntion of the expresser's warmth during the conversation in the\nabove model did not eliminate the statistically significant pos-\nitive association between expresser other-praising behavior and\nthe target's perception of expresser responsiveness (ps .001)\nnor did it reveal a suppression effect of self-benefit behavior\n(ps > .14). The same was true for experienced positive emo-\ntions and for the specific positive emotion of loving (ps for\nother-praising < .04; ps for self-benefit > .13), with one excep-\ntion, where the association between other-praising and target\npositive emotions was reduced when controlling for perceived\nexpresser warmth (p \u00bc .09).\nDiscussion\nData from three independent samples, totaling 370 naturalistic\nconversations between romantic partners, point to the conclu-\nsion that other-praising behavior is the relationally active ingre-\ndient in expressions of gratitude: When expressers used more\nTable 3.

These are precisely the subjective psychological\nexperiences that theory and evidence suggest will forecast a\ntrajectory of growth for the benefactor and, likely, the relation-\nGiven the dyadic structure of the methods and the conserva-\ntive inclusion of the additional positive expressive behavior,\nthe current work provides the first robust test of the hypothesis\nthat it is the other-praising feature of gratitude that makes it\nuniquely suited for relationship promotion. These data contrib-\nute to the growing body of literature on the social consequences\nof expressed positive emotion (Clark & Monin, 2014) and help\nparse the theoretical and empirical landscape for understanding\nthe conditions under which certain positively valenced social\nbehaviors--here, an expression of gratitude--will be more\nlikely to produce certain types of social effects.\nAlthough these are correlational data, the effects were\nrobust to several alternative explanations and consistent across\nthe two studies. This includes one variable identified in prior\nresearch to be associated with a social outcome from expressed\ngratitude, perceived warmth of the expresser (Williams & Bar-\ntlett, 2015). This analysis is especially useful to consider given\nthat the behavioral code of other-praising explicitly mentions\nconveyed ``warmth.'' Although of course each behavioral code\nwas derived from theory, wherein conveyed warmth would be\nexpected to covary with other praising, but not with self-benefit\nexpression (Ortony et al., 1988), we suspect that people expres-\nsing self-benefit, compared to emotional neutrality or to\nexpressing negative emotions, typically would be seen as war-\nmer by observers; they would also likely increase the target's\nown positive emotions simply because it feels good to know\none did good (Dunn et al., 2008). Regardless of these potential\nsituations under which expressing one's own joy about a ben-\nefit to the self could be a mechanism for beneficial social con-\nsequences (and see Gable et al., 2006), in this very positive\ncontext, with multiple sources of ``goodness,'' we did not find\nit to be the distinguishing feature of expressed gratitude.\nInstead, we used theory to separate the signal from the noise,\nshowcasing the unique relational value of other-praising beha-\nvior. These findings justify future consideration of whether\nother-praising behavior is the best signal of actually experi-\nenced gratitude, using different methods.\nSome readers may worry that observed other-praising beha-\nvior is conceptually close to the primary outcome variable, per-\nceived expresser responsiveness. However, these are two\nconstructs from independent theoretical traditions (i.e., emo-\ntions and relationships), operationalized with different descrip-\ntions; although we assume that other-praising behavior taps\ninto the validation component of perceived responsiveness,\nwe do not view them as the same. Indeed, the correlations\nbetween the two variables were modest (r \u00bc .30 in Study 1 and\n.25 in Study 2). Moreover, the secondary outcomes--the tar-\nget's positive emotions--do not have conceptual overlap with\nthe predictor of expresser's other-praising behavior. Because\npositive emotions are another path through which the target\nmay improve a sense of felt connection or feel rewarded from\nthe interaction with the expresser (see Aron, Norman, Aron,\nMcKenna, & Heyman, 2000) and loving in particular may\nincrease that person's willingness to invest in the relationship\n(Gonzaga et al., 2006), these data provide useful convergent\nevidence in support of the present hypothesis. Further, these\nanalyses draw attention to positive emotions as useful out-\ncomes to examine in future research within relationship\nscience.\nConclusion\nThe emotion of gratitude has been called out as central to social\nlife in general, and to survival in particular, by keeping one\nembedded within a supportive social network (Algoe, 2012).\nA critical contribution of that proposal is that a grateful person\nenacts unique behaviors that could draw these high-quality,\nsupportive partners into the relationship. Here, we used theory\nto identify one such behavior--other praising--that may pro-\nvide that hook. The results drive home the point that other\npraising is a theoretically and empirically overlooked, yet key\nbehavioral mechanism through which expressed gratitude can\nimpact the benefactor on precisely the outcome that has already\nforecasted relational growth (i.e., target's perception of expres-\nser responsiveness) as well as others that should also do that,\neven if indirectly (i.e., target's positive emotions and felt lov-\ning). With few exceptions, even when studied, most researchers\nstudying positive emotions or positively valenced interpersonal\nprocesses do not have data from each member of the dyad nor\ndo they address cross-dyad questions that speak to the interper-\nsonal process through which one person may influence the\nother and rarely do they account for other positively valenced\ncontent of the social interaction. As such, beyond contributions\nto understanding the role of gratitude in social life, these find-\nings have implications for understanding mechanisms for the\ngrowth of ongoing relationships and call for more research\non differential social consequences of expressed positive\nemotions.\n"
