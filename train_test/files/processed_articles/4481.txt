The\npurpose is to describe and analyze which actions are privileged when children participate in preschool activities. Analyses\nof video recordings of everyday preschool activities show how children experience activities where they critically discuss\nand make value judgments about actions. The results of the analyses also show how different actions become relevant in\ndifferent practices. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the preschool practices and three teaching principles within\neducation for sustainable development (ESD). In ESD, action competence is the ability to critically make value judgments\nabout different alternative ways to act for a sustainable future. The result shows how children make value judgments in\nsituations where facts are not sufficient for solving a problem.\n",

On one hand, some researchers focus\non the natural environment and stress that education should\nuse curricula both in and about the environment.1 On the\nother hand, some stress that economic, social, and environ-\nmental dimensions should be included in the curriculum.2\nEven though both perspectives address research questions of\nmoral and political character in some way, the main differ-\nence between them could be described as while these ques-\ntions are included implicitly in the first perspective, the\nsecond always try to make them explicit. Important issues\nfor a sustainable future can involve every human's right to\nget education or to have access to clean water. As there is not\none clear way to solve sustainability issues, there is a need to\nbe able to make value judgments to determine what actions\ncan result in an articulated goal.\nIn spite of the differences between perspectives and\napproaches in the field of ESD research, a common point of\ndeparture is the view that children are important actors for\nchange in the future (see, for example, EPSD, 2010). Hence,\none way to explore ESD is to investigate what action compe-\ntence children need to participate in sustainable develop-\nment. Although the term action competence is used in\ndifferent ways by different researchers, most agree that the\nconcept includes knowledge about different action possibili-\nties, skills to investigate and discuss the different action pos-\nsibilities and confidence to perform the actions.3\nThis article explores which actions are made relevant in\npreschool educational settings. Analyzing how children\nmove forward in an activity makes it possible to grasp why\nand how certain kinds of actions and competences become\nrelevant and others do not. In these analyses, it is also possi-\nble to discuss how the actions in the meaning-making pro-\ncess prepare the children for future actions, that is, what\nkinds of action competences they develop.\nWe will use an analytical approach developed and used in\na number of previous studies (e.g., Lidar, Lundqvist, &\nRudsberg & \u00d6hman, 2010). The approach is built on a prag-\nmatic perspective on meaning-making and a view on lan-\nis a complex and dynamic process in which knowledge\nundergoes change; knowledge grows and develops rather\nmaking process, for example, when people interact there is a\nneed to make the situation at hand intelligible to be able to\nmove forward. A way to make situations intelligible is by\nmaking connections between what a person encounters and\n1Uppsala University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nMaria Hedefalk, Department of Education, Uppsala University, Box 256,\nEmail: maria.hedefalk@edu.uu.se\nTeaching for Action Competence\nMaria Hedefalk1, Jonas Almqvist1, and Malena Lidar1\n Keywords\naction, early childhood, education, sustainable development\n2 SAGE Open\nhis or her earlier experiences. In this way, participation in\npast activities contributes to the formation of the present situ-\nation, at the same time as the present situation prepares for\nfuture activities (cf.Almqvist et al., 2008; Lidar,Almqvist, &\n\u00d6stman, 2010). Many of the actions that people perform are\nhabitual; people fall back on them because they have learned\nthe actions in earlier situations and because they do not see a\nneed to doubt them in the present activities (cf. Wittgenstein,\nreflect on their actions but can act as they are used to in simi-\ncan be understood as a gradual transformation of habits and\nways of acting. However, when the actors do not automati-\ncally know how to move ahead in a situation, this creates\nwhat can be called a \"problematic situation\" (Wickman &\n\u00d6stman, 2002; Hedefalk et al., in press). When observing\ninteractions, these problematic situations are a window into\nexploring how a situation is made meaningful and how the\nparticipants are able to move forward and also--and central\nto this article--which actions are considered appropriate in\neducational settings.\nTeaching Principles\nIn teaching activities, teachers have to make choices regard-\ning educational goals, content, and methods. These choices\nreflect, among other things, which actions are relevant in the\npractice. To be able to describe what kinds of actions are con-\nsidered relevant in education, we introduce the concept\nteaching principles. As a starting point, the principles are\nbuilt on previous research--mainly consisting of policy\nanalyses and interviews--on different teaching traditions in\nthe field of ESD (Sandell, \u00d6hman, & \u00d6stman, 2005). We\nalso want to stress that there can be huge differences between\nwhat is expected from politicians, policy makers, and teach-\ners on one hand and what happens in everyday teaching prac-\ntices on the other. Therefore, the use of the concept teaching\nprinciples in our analyses should be seen as a part of an\nexplorative approach where we are open to find new and\nunexpected meaning-making processes.\nTeaching for sustainable development can be categorized\ninto three teaching traditions based on different views on the\ngoals and content of ESD: the fact-based teaching tradition,\nthe normative teaching tradition, and the pluralistic teaching\nthe teachers'various aims, content, and methods. Each teach-\ning tradition can be defined by the different actions that are\nprivileged in different teaching situations.\nThese three teaching traditions were described in analyses\nin environmental education context (Sandell et al., 2005;\nSkolverket, 2001). In this study, we take our point of depar-\nture from this categorization to discuss feasible consequences\nwhen teaching in preschool. We develop an approach that\nexplores how different teaching principles would look in the\ndifferent traditions, specifically looking at what different\nkinds of actions the teacher privileges.\nThe purpose is to look for all the three different kinds of\nprinciples in a preschool context and discuss what these vari-\nous ways of teaching mean in relation to children's possibili-\nties to develop action competence for a sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Fact-Based Teaching Principle\nCharacteristic of the fact-based teaching principle is that the\nlearners are expected to learn facts of some kind (Flogaitis,\nfor change, the children need to learn facts that they can use\nas a base for their decision making; when they have learned\nenough, they are also competent to act for change (cf. \u00d6stman\n& Almqvist, 2011). Fact-based teaching means that children\ninteract in a way which results in the acquisition of suitable\nfacts about the issue in focus. Discussing values--for exam-\nple, different views on the relationship between man and\nnature--is not relevant in teaching based on this principle\nbecause the focus of the educational content is on finding the\ncorrect description of the world (Sandell et al., 2005).\nThe Normative Teaching Principle\nIn the normative teaching tradition, moral issues are high-\nlighted and teachers focus on questions about how to act\nHowever, the relevant values are decided beforehand and\nseen as a central part of the educational content that should\nbe learned by the children.\nThe normative principle emphasizes learning predefined\ndefined value means that the content is built on a specific\nview (held by, for example, scientists, stakeholders, organi-\nzations, or political parties) that defines which actions should\nbe considered relevant.\nIn teaching built on this principle, discussing values is\nregarded as irrelevant because the understanding is that the\npredefined values form the correct answers. Students do not\nneed to value the teaching content, just learn it. Teachers\nguided by this principle would acknowledge that there are\ndifferent ways to act and different answers to the same ques-\ntions, but the principle dictates that only one--or very few--\nof the answers is valid.\nThe Pluralistic Teaching Principle\nAs with the normative teaching principle, the content of the\npluralistic teaching principle includes moral questions, but\nits main characteristic is that the children are expected to\nlearn how to critically make value judgments.4 Consequently,\nin teaching built on this principle encourages the children\nHedefalk et al. 3\nsearch for information as stakeholders using different\nsources, such as the media and literature, to scrutinize and\ndiscuss different views on the subject in focus. The learners\nare expected to critically explore different views and come to\nconclusions by themselves or together with others. It is also\npossible for different children to find different solutions;\nconsensus is not always necessary.\nPurpose\nThe aim of this article is twofold. First, the aim is to describe\nand analyze which actions are made relevant in different pre-\nschool settings. The described activities show which action\ncompetences the children will need to participate in particu-\nlar practices. Second, the actions performed are compared\nwith those prioritized within the three different teaching\nprinciples described above. This comparison makes it possi-\nble to discuss which action competences children develop in\nSwedish early childhood education in relation to those called\nfor in ESD research.\nIn other words, the analyses will highlight the following\nresearch questions:\nResearch Question 1: Which actions are privileged in\ndifferent preschool activities?\nResearch Question 2: What does this mean for children's\npossibilities to develop action competences?\nMethod\nEmpirical Material\nThe empirical material consists of transcripts from video\nrecordings collected at a preschool in Sweden. The preschool\nis situated on the outskirts of a city and surrounded by forest,\nfarm land, and meadows. Some of the children walk to the\npreschool and some come by a vehicle, depending on how\nclose they live to the preschool. The ages of the children dif-\nfer between the groups: Dundret has children aged 1 to 2\nyears, the children in Kebnekaise are 3 to 4 years, and the\nchildren in Skanderna are 5 to 6 years. There are two staff\nmembers working with every group, for a total of six\nemployees.\nThe study complies with Swedish research ethics. The\npreschool teachers, parents, and children were asked for\ninformed consent before the project started, and all the par-\nticipants have been given fabricated names.\nThe video recordings, a total of 24 hr of film, were open-\nended and recorded during the mornings (between 9:00 a.m.\nSince we are interested in analyzing children's discussions\nwith teachers and with each other, we have not in the analy-\nses included parts of the material were they are playing qui-\netly, walking in a line quietly, singing or listening to a teacher\nreading from a book. In total, approximately 13\u00bd hr of the\nrecordings were tran-scribed.\nThe analysis of the empirical material was conducted in\ntwo steps:\nStep 1: Practical epistemology analysis.In the first step, we\nused practical epistemology analysis, where we analyzed the\nproblematic situations to find out how the children make the\nsituation meaningful. Wickman and \u00d6stman (2002) intro-\nduced this approach analyzing science education at univer-\nsity level. Stand fast is a central analytical concept in the\napproach. Actions stand fast as valid for the participants in\nthe situation when performed without hesitation. In these\nkinds of situations, the actions, such as the use of concepts,\nare things that no one hesitates about; they are immediately\nintelligible. Hence, there is no need to explain what needs to\nbe said or done.\nHowever, when people are not sure about which action to\npursue, when a situation is not immediately intelligible, we\nsay that a gap appears (Wickman & \u00d6stman, 2002). The gap\nis noticeable because the participants need to solve the prob-\nlem before they can carry on the meaning-making.According\nto Wickman and \u00d6stman (2002), most of the gaps are quickly\nfilled in an activity, but some linger, which means that the\nparticipants do not immediately bridge them. To bridge the\ngap, the children need to make the situation intelligible. The\nanalyses of meaning-making are thus descriptions of how the\ngaps children encounter are bridged.\nThe first step of the analysis was to show what meaning-\nmaking is done. In the analysis, the meaning-making\nbecomes evident when gaps appear; then, we present what\nactions are performed to bridge the gaps.\nIn the analyses of the transcripts, we searched for \"prob-\nlematic situations,\" that is situations where the participants\nhesitate or do not automatically know how to proceed. These\nsituations are keys to understanding how a situation is made\nmeaningful and what actions the participants performed to\nbe able to move forward. Meaning is situational--we do not\nknow beforehand what meaning will be created. The situa-\ntions used in this article were chosen for their clarity of what\nactions that are privileged in the situation.\nStep 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the second\nstep of the analysis, a comparative strategy was used. This is\ndone by associating the different actions that are described in\nthe first step with the three different teaching principles. The\nidentified gaps not only tell us what the children have learned\nfrom prior experience but also how they solve problems.\nFurthermore, we discuss the actions in relation to the\nimplications for children's possibilities to develop the action\ncompetences that are sought after in ESD research. Different\nactions are identified as relevant in different teaching prin-\nciples and give us a clue as to what kind of actions can be\nperformed within the different teaching contexts. This allows\nus to identify actions in everyday preschool life and to dis-\ncuss the potential consequences of the teaching principles for\nthe development of action competence as discussed within\n4 SAGE Open\nResults\nWe have found three different categories of actions used to\nsolve problematic situations participants encounter in the\npreschool setting, suggesting which actions were privileged\nin the situations. The categorization of these actions is made\nin terms of \"needs\" that are required to bridge different kinds\nof gaps: (a) the need to know what to focus on, (b) the need\nfor additional information, and (c) the need to make value\njudgments.\nIn the following, we use a few empirical examples to\nillustrate each category. The illustrations in the first step\nshow how the actors proceed to move forward in the situa-\ntion. In the next step, the actions are compared with actions\nthat are privileged and agree with the different teaching\nprinciples.\nThe Need to Know What to Focus On\nStep 1: Practical epistemology analysis. Three children sit on a\nrug with a volcano landscape motif on it, playing with plastic\ndinosaurs and looking in a book about dinosaurs. In our anal-\nysis of their meaning-making process, we can see that it\nbecomes important for them to investigate whether the dino-\nsaurs are meat-eaters or plant-eaters.\nKasper wants to attack Karin's dinosaur but finds this dif-\nficult, because grass-eaters do not attack each other. The dis-\ncussion about meat-eaters versus plant-eaters and their\nattacks on each other goes on for quite a while.5 In one exam-\nple from their conversation, Kasper's dinosaur starts to attack\nKarin's dinosaur by biting it. Kalle, who is watching them,\ninterrupts the play and tells them that Kasper's dinosaur is a\nplant-eater and does not bite other dinosaurs. Kasper then\npicks up another dinosaur and starts attacking Karin's dino-\nsaur again. As Kalle does not protest, we can assume that the\nnew dinosaur is considered to be a meat-eater.\nIn a sense, the children now have all the information they\nneed to move forward in their play. However, the question\nabout how to decide what dinosaur belongs to which group\nlingers in their discussion. The children continue to investi-\ngate and discuss differences between plant-eaters and meat-\neaters. A teacher, Kristina, enters the activity, sits down on\nthe rug, and helps the children to focus on something they\nhave not noticed before.6 She instructs the children to exam-\nine the mouth of one of the dinosaurs. According to the\nteacher, the mouth and teeth are what the children should pay\nattention to when determining whether the dinosaur is a\nplant-eater or a meat-eater. Kasper answers by saying that\nthe dinosaur is a plant-eater, but without examining the\nmouth. The teacher again directs the children toward the\nmouth by saying, \"Look in the mouth then.\" Kasper reacts to\nthe teacher's method of investigation by saying, \"No, it is a\nplant-eater.\" Karin follows the teacher's direction by exam-\nining the mouth and says that the mouth is pink. The teacher\nthen instructs the children to examine their own mouths by\nfeeling their teeth. Here, we can see that Kasper follows the\nteacher's instructions, even though he knows another way to\ndecide what type of dinosaur he has in front of him.\nStep 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the empiri-\ncal example, the children were told what to do to find an\nanswer to their query; they never had to critically evaluate\nthe actions. Consequently, the actions that are privileged in\nthis situation are in line with the fact-based teaching princi-\nple. In the empirical example, the need to know what to focus\non is solved by the teacher by directing the children's atten-\ntion to the \"appropriate\" way of finding the answer. The\nteacher directs the children's actions toward a scientific way\nof finding out whether the dinosaurs are meat-eaters or plant-\neaters (by focusing on the teeth). It is not up to the children\nto decide which actions might solve the problems because\nthis is done beforehand and corresponds to a scientific\nmethod. This is of course not a surprise because they did not\nencounter any problem where they would need to decide\nwhat method is the best one to see whether the dinosaurs are\nmeat-eaters or plant-eaters. But let us see how the same\nmeaning-making situation can be understood in relation to\nthe two other teaching principles described above.\nAs described above, for actions to become relevant in the\nnormative or pluralistic teaching principles, the discussion\nhas to deal with moral and not just with epistemological\nproblems. In these situations, facts alone do not facilitate\nmoving forward in the situation. For example, in the situa-\ntion in which the dinosaurs were categorized according to\nwhat they ate, the moral problem of whether it is morally\ndefensible for living creatures to attack each other could\nhave arisen.\nIn the normative teaching principle, values are turned into\nscientific facts. The idea is that it is possible for people to\nfind the right and good way to act by doing rational thinking\nand investigations. In this particular case, the teacher could\nhave referred to the natural food chain. In a scientific dis-\ncourse, it is rational and morally defensible for living crea-\ntures to attack each other and a decision to become vegetarian,\nfor example, could be seen as irrational. Here, the value\njudgment is made within a scientific discourse, and the chil-\ndren are not involved in it.\nIn the pluralistic teaching principle, the participants are\nexpected to make value judgments about different perspec-\ntives of the issue. Some might say that it is necessarily for\ndinosaurs to attack each other, while others may not. The\nchildren then need to critically discuss and value what they\nthink is morally right. In this case, science does not have the\nonly answer, and there are no predefined answers that deter-\nmine which action is right.\nThe Need for Additional Information\nStep 1: Practical epistemology analysis. In this empirical exam-\nple, the dinosaur activity described above continues.7 Karin\nHedefalk et al. 5\nsits on the rug with Kasper and Karolina, and Kalle observes\nthem. They play with the dinosaurs by pushing them against\neach other. Suddenly, Kalle shouts out and directs the other\nchildren's attention toward a book. He points at a picture and\nsays, \"Look, this one, look here how strange when there are\nhorns.\" Kasper notes that the dinosaur in his hand has horns,\nand he places the dinosaur on top of the picture. \"But this is\na meat-eater,\" Kalle says and points at the book. \"That one is\nnot a meat-eater.\" He points at Kalle's plastic dinosaur.\nA gap has appeared: Kalle has assumed that meat-eaters\ndo not have any horns, but the meat-eater in the book has\nhorns, which contradicts his earlier experiences. This makes\nhim doubt the new information. Kalle compares the dino-\nsaurs but cannot make sense of the pictures. Karolina and\nKasper look in the book and continue the activity by discuss-\ning that some dinosaurs have short horns and others have\nlong horns. However, they are unable to fill the gap, and they\nstart a new investigation.\nStep 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the empiri-\ncal example outlined above, the actions that are privileged\nagree with the fact-based teaching principle. The way to\nbridge the gap is to understand the scientific facts in the\nbook.\nFeasibly, a teacher could intervene in a situation as in the\nsituation above and turn the discussion about the dinosaur's\nhorn into a discussion about a moral problem and, thus, make\nit relevant within the normative and pluralistic teacher tradi-\ntions. This could, for example, involve a discussion about\nwhether a plant-eater or a meat-eater should use the horns\nagainst each other or not. In the normative teaching princi-\nple, the teacher would then probably tell the children about\nthe use of the horns to stay within a scientific discourse. The\nuse of horns is then turned into a scientific question. The\nchildren do not need to make value judgments because sci-\nence has already done it for them.\nIn the pluralistic teaching principle, however, it would be\nrelevant for the participants to consult different sources to\nmake value judgments and discuss different views on ani-\nmals' uses of horns. Some might say that it is morally defen-\nsible for dinosaurs to use their horns on each other, while\nothers might not think so. The children would then need to\ncritically evaluate the views and decide what they think is\nmorally defensible. In this case, science is not the only\nsource, and there is no predefined correct answer.\nThe Need to Make Value Judgments\nStep 1: Practical epistemology analysis.In the two empirical\nexamples provided below, the need to make value judgments\nis illustrated and solved in different ways. In the empirical\nexamples, we can observe a need to know which action is\nvalued as the right one.\nIn the first situation, the children hesitate about how to act\nwhen they encounter a hedgehog in the preschool yard. The\nchildren are playing in the courtyard on a warm and sunny\nmorning.8 Selma, Sofia, and Sara climb on two ropes tied\nbetween two trees. Selma suddenly stops when she catches\nsight of a hedgehog.\nThe girls start to examine the hedgehog and Selma notes\nthat the hedgehog is thorny. Sara suggests that they can poke\nthe hedgehog with a stick. All three girls each fetch a stick.\nSelma then pokes the hedgehog with her stick. Sara says,\n\"We are just fiddling around.\" The girls hesitate--a gap\nappears, in that they do not know if this action is okay to\nperform or not. Sara changes her action by shouting, \"don't,\"\nto Selma and runs toward a teacher. \"Miss, Miss. There is a\nhedgehog. Come and look. We have found a hedgehog.\"\nSelma drops the stick and starts shouting, \"We have found a\nhedgehog. We have found a hedgehog.\"\nThe girls alert several children and a teacher, and one of\nthe girls, Selma, bends over the hedgehog and pokes it with\nthe stick. Kia, the teacher, however, informs the children that\nit is wrong to poke the hedgehog with sticks: \"No Sofia, do\nnot poke it. Let it be, you are not allowed to touch it,\" the\nteacher responds. A possible gap arises because Selma says\nthat she is not poking, just touching. The teacher then clari-\nfies that no touching is allowed: \"What did I just say? You\nare not allowed to touch it.\" Sofia runs to fetch more children\nand at the same time shouts that they should not touch the\nhedgehog. Selma shows in action that she has understood the\nteacher by stopping the poking, and shouting to the other\nchildren that they are not allowed touching the hedgehog.\nStep 2: Comparison and potential consequences.The need to\nmake value judgments becomes relevant when the hedgehog\nenters the preschool yard. The children find out that it is\nwrong to examine the animal closely, at least by poking it\nwith sticks. Watching from a distance is considered to be the\nright way to act. In this activity, the relevant way to act is\nindicated by the teacher's prior value judgment of which\naction is considered morally acceptable. There is no possibil-\nity for the children to discuss different ways to act in this\nactivity. The teacher's suggested actions are privileged, fol-\nlowing the normative teaching principle.\nIn this situation, the fact-based teaching principle is not\nrelevant because the actions are focused on valuing behavior\nrather than on handling facts.\nFor the actions to be consistent with the pluralistic teach-\ning tradition, the children would have to discuss whether\npoking the hedgehog with a stick is morally defensible or not\nand look at different ways of investigating the hedgehog. In\nother words, they would need to study different views and\nsources to critically evaluate the matter and solve the prob-\nlem of how to act in this situation.\nA Second Example of Making Value Judgments\nStep 1: Practical epistemology analyses. A few children gather\ntogether and sit in a ring on the floor.9 They have just sung a\n6 SAGE Open\nsong about a mosquito, and a discussion about how to protect\nthemselves against mosquitoes has begun. The teacher, Saga,\nleads the gathering and decides whose turn it is to speak. The\nchildren have made different suggestions, and it is now\nSvante's turn to contribute to the discussion: \"But if a mos-\nquito, if you feel that a mosquito lands on you, you just go\nlike this.\" He hits his arm with the palm of his hand.\nA gap occurs as the discussion continues. Svante has pre-\nsented the idea that you can smash the mosquito with your\nhand, but teacher Kristina suggests another way of getting\nrid of the mosquito--by sweeping it away. This statement\nfrom the teacher indicates that it is possible to have different\nviews; Kristina's suggestion means that the mosquito stays\nalive, while Svante would end up with a dead mosquito.\nKristina's suggestion can be understood as a grounded in\na specific moral value: It is wrong to kill insects. Svante\nsticks to his idea and repeats his suggestion of smashing the\nmosquito: \"Yes, or smash it.\" The teacher Saga says that she\n\"actually\" thinks that it is okay to hit mosquitoes because\nthey are not pleasant to humans. She develops this reasoning\nby saying that it is okay to kill unpleasant animals, but those\nthat are not unpleasant should be allowed to live by being\nswept away. Our interpretation is that when she says \"actu-\nally,\" she indicates that there might be other beliefs about\nthis; this is just what she thinks.\nKalle supports teacher Saga's idea as he shows how this\ncan be done by smashing an imaginary insect with his hands.\nThe gap lingers because Saga says, \"No, now you have to\nlisten.\"According to her, Kalle's suggestion of hitting insects\nis not completely acceptable. Teacher Saga explains what\nkinds of insect she thinks can be killed or not. Her reasoning\ninvolves killing insects that inflict pain to humans; the other\nones can be swept away without them losing their lives.\nStep 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In this exam-\nple, the teachers take different stands on how to act, which in\nturn makes it possible for the children to also consider differ-\nent ways of acting. These kinds of actions are privileged in\nthe pluralistic teaching principle.\nIf both teachers had agreed on the same way of acting, it\nmight not have been necessary for the children to consider\ndifferent ways of acting. When the teachers decide for the\nchildren which actions are considered to be right, the actions\nare privileged and consistent with the normative teaching\nprinciple. The teacher, Sara, argues that insects that inject\npoison inflict pain on humans and then merit killing. This\nalso means that insects that do not inflict pain do not need to\ndie. If the other teacher, Kristina, had agreed with this, the\nchildren would probably have felt obligated to agree as well,\nand that would have then been regarded as the appropriate\nway of acting in the situation.\nConclusion\nThe overall aim of this article has been to describe and ana-\nlyze which actions are privileged in different preschool\nsettings and to compare these actions with those that are\nprivileged in three different teaching principles: the fact-\nbased teaching principle, the normative teaching principle,\nand the pluralistic teaching principle. The comparisons are\nmade to be able to discuss what action competences children\nare developing in relation to the action competences\ndescribed within ESD research.\nWe found three different categories of actions the children\nperform to solve problematic situations they encounter. The\ncategorization of these actions is made in terms of \"needs\"\nthat are required to bridge different kinds of gaps: the need to\nknow what to focus on, the need for additional information,\nand the need to make value judgments. Even if these actions\nare not performed within a sustainability context, the chil-\ndren develop general competences that are called for in ESD\nresearch.\nThe privileged actions that are consistent with the fact-\nbased teaching principle involve, among other things, the\nability to make scientific investigations and to pay attention\nto relevant sources of information. These actions were illus-\ntrated when the children played with dinosaurs. The teacher\nhelped the children to focus on something that they had not\nfocused on before. When the children needed additional\ninformation, they found this information in a science book\nfor children. These two kinds of actions focus on handling\nfacts to be able to move forward in the situation.\nA teacher's didactic choices may have a great impact on\nthe direction of an action (cf. Hedefalk, in press). If teachers\nwant children to develop competences that involve dealing\nwith moral problems and dilemmas, the use of facts is not\nsufficient for moving forward in the situation. Actions that\nare privileged within the normative teaching tradition are\nthose in accordance with predefined moral evaluations. Here,\nchildren learn to follow someone else's directions. However,\nif the aim is for children to act critically and think indepen-\ndently, the pluralistic teaching principle asks for further\nactions. According to this principle, to develop the relevant\nacting skills, children need to experience actions where they\ncan critically value different alternatives. In the examples\nprovided, these actions became relevant when the children\ndiscussed insects.\nESD researchers describe action competence as the ability\nto discuss and critically evaluate alternatives (L\u00e6ss\u00f8e, 2010;\n\u00d6hman, 2010). As there is not one clear way to solve sustain-\nable issues, actors must be able to critically value what\nactions can result in the articulated goal. Sustainable issues\nare not articulated in the preschool activities we have ana-\nlyzed, but students can learn how to critically discuss and\nmake value judgments about actions in more general terms in\nsome activities.\nWhen the children were playing with the dinosaurs, we\nnoticed that the need to find facts was relevant and moral\nquestions were not. What seems to be important to focus on\nin preschool activities, for children to develop action compe-\ntences asked for within ESD research, is to learn how to\nHedefalk et al. 7\ncritically value different actions. In that sense, the fact-based\nprinciple cannot be used solely to develop an action compe-\ntence to make value judgments about moral dilemmas. We\ndo not suggest that teachers turn every activity into a moral\ndilemma but we do want to highlight the importance of notic-\ning the activities where children can critically make a value\njudgment.\nThe importance of being able to make a value judgment\nwas evident in the study when facts were not sufficient to\nsolve a problem. Without values, it is not possible to evaluate\nwhat is at hand. Therefore, ESD has to contain activities\nwhere children evaluate and critically discuss matters.\nLearning facts is not always enough.\nHence, the study has shown that preschool teachers should\npay attention to situations in which value judgments become\nimportant. When there is a need to make a value judgment\nabout a moral matter, there is also a possibility to create dif-\nferent solutions and critically evaluate what actions are\nappropriate. By acting in these situations, children hopefully\ncan build the foundation of action competences discussed in\nESD research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\nare selected from a review by Davis (2009), which consists of\n14 journals.
