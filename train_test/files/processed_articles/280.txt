Heavy use is linked with numer-\nous negative health consequences and adverse social out-\ncomes, including liver damage, mouth and throat cancer,\nsexually transmitted disease, antisocial behaviour and\npoor school performance [1]. Rates of alcohol use and\nproblem use in the United Kingdom are high compared to\nmost other European countries [2], with many adoles-\ncents regarding heavy alcohol use as normative [1].\nBetter understanding of the risk factors for alcohol\nproblem use is important for the development of the most\neffective prevention and intervention approaches.\nBoth genetic factors [3] and peer influences [4\u00ad7]\nhave been implicated in adolescent alcohol use. Twin\nstudies indicate that 20\u00ad30% of the variation in liability\nto adolescent alcohol use is genetic in origin [3]. In the\nfirst UK-based twin study of substance use, we have found\npreviously that genetic influences accounted for around\nprogression of alcohol use [8]. Peer alcohol use (usually\nassessed by adolescent report rather than directly) has\nbeen reported to be one of the strongest predictors of\nadolescent alcohol use [5\u00ad7], while perception of peers'\nattitudes to alcohol use is another important risk factor\nThere are several possible reasons for the strong rela-\ntionship between peer alcohol use and adolescent alcohol\nuse. Peers may influence adolescent drinking behaviour\nby serving as role models and by influencing attitudes\ntowards alcohol. They can also facilitate access to and\nencouragement of alcohol use [10,11]. Alternatively,\ngiven that adolescents are involved actively in selecting\nand maintaining friendships, they may select friends with\nsimilar drinking habits to themselves (peer selection\n[12,13]). It is likely that the association between friends'\nand adolescent alcohol use is due to both peer selection\nand peer influence. Other factors, including cultural\nnorms, neighbourhood influences, school and larger peer\nA possible explanation for the association is gene\u00ad\nenvironment correlation (rGE). Conceptually, rGE con-\ncerns the co-occurrence of genetic influences increasing\nrisk for alcohol use in adolescents with risk environments\n(e.g. involvement with substance-using peers). Three\ntypesof rGEhavebeenposited:passive(wheretheparental\ngenes cause the correlation), active (where the subject's\nown genes make him/her seek certain environments) and\nevocative (where a subject's own genes increase the\nchances he/she is selected by others) [16,17]. It has been\nhypothesized that rGE plays an important role in the con-\ntinuity of devious behaviour over time [18]. The study of\ngene\u00adenvironmentcorrelationisimportantbecauseitcan\nidentify the environments that put individuals with a\ngenetic liability for alcohol problem use at an increased\nrisk. Twin studies using bivariate genetic analyses repre-\nsent an important first step towards disentangling the\nmechanisms of gene\u00adenvironment correlation. Genetic\ninfluences have been reported for adolescent alcohol use\n[3], peer behaviour [19] and friendship maintenance and\nformation [20]. It seems plausible that the correlation\nbetween peers and adolescent alcohol use is explained\npartially by an overlap in genetic factors. To date, a\nUS-based study of 14-year old twins [4] is the only twin\nstudy to examine peer influences and adolescent alcohol\nuse.The study used a measure of peer deviance and found\nthat the association with alcohol use was explained by\ncommon environmental influences (i.e. environmental\ninfluences that make the twins more similar), with no\nevidence for genetic influences. Peer alcohol use was\nassessed as part of a broader index of peer deviance. Given\nthe strong association identified between peer and adoles-\ncent alcohol use, it may be an important risk factor in its\nown right [5\u00ad7]. Further, genetic influences have been\nreported for a combined measure of peer alcohol and ciga-\nretteuse[19]butnotforpeerdeviance[4],suggestingthat\ntheir aetiology may be different.\nThere is evidence to suggest that while frequency of\nalcohol use is associated with a range of negative out-\ncomes, there are distinct risks involved in binge drinking\nand drunkenness, such as increased aggressive and anti-\nsocial behaviour [21,22]. A definition of binge drinking\nof five or more drinks in a row has been used previously to\ndefine problem drinking in epidemiological research and\nin reports used to inform UK policy decisions [1,2]. The\nrelationship between close friends' alcohol use with ado-\nlescent use of alcohol versus problem use may differ and it\nis potentially informative to explore this.\nThe aims of the present study were to examine:\n1 the relationship between adolescent alcohol use and\nproblem use and their best friends' alcohol use in a UK\npopulation-based sample of twins;\n2 the genetic and environmental influences on adoles-\ncent alcohol use and problem use and their friends'\nalcohol use; and\n3 whether the relationship between friends' and adoles-\ncent alcohol use is influenced by genetic or environ-\nmental factors.\nBecause alcohol use and peer influences may differ,\ndepending on gender and age [23\u00ad25], this was also\nevaluated in our analyses.\nMETHOD\nSample\nThis study used data from the fourth wave (2004) of data\ncollection of the longitudinal Cardiff Study of All Wales\nand North-west of England Twins (CaStANET), a\npopulation-based twin register, including families with\nWales and the North-west of England [26,27]. Previous\nfocused on indices of child psychological adjustment\n[including attention deficit hyperactive disprder (ADHD),\nconduct problems, depression and chronic fatigue] using\nquestionnaires were mailed to families taking part in\nCaStANET with twins aged 11\u00ad19 years, which assessed\nsubstance use and associated risk factors, including\nfamily functioning, parent health and twin psychological\nadjustment. The sample is representative of the general\nUK population in terms of socio-economic status and eth-\nnicity [27,28]. Zygosity was assigned in an earlier wave of\nthe study [23] using a parent-rated twin similarity ques-\ntionnaire [29,30]. Non-responders were initially sent\nreminder postcards and were then re-mailed the ques-\ntionnaire. Of 1755 families contacted, at least one\nindividual from 1214 families returned questionnaires\n(a response rate of 69%; the individual response rate\nGenetic and environmental influences on peer and adolescent alcohol use 895\nwas 61%). Families received gift vouchers as a token of\nappreciation.\nAlcohol can be purchased legally in the United\nKingdom from 18 years of age. For the present paper, we\nanalysed data on adolescents under the legal age. Our\n(complete data on both twins were not always available)\nMeasures\nFor the current paper, all measures were from adolescent\nself-report. The measures used to assess own and close\nfriends' alcohol use were derived from the Add Health\nquestionnaire [31]. The Add Health study is the largest\nsurvey of adolescent health undertaken to date. All the\nmeasures used in the present study have been piloted\nextensively in the Add Health study [32].\nQuantity of alcohol use\nThis was assessed using the question: `Think of all the\nalcoholic drinks you had during the past 12 months.\nHow many drinks did you have during a typical week'?\nResponses ranged from 1 (never had a drink in my life) to\n7 (more than 30 in a typical week). For the present analy-\nsis, individuals were recoded into those who had never\ndrunk alcohol, light drinkers (less than six drinks in a\ntypical week) and heavier drinkers (six or more drinks in\na typical week). A drink was defined as a glass of wine, a\ncan or half pint of beer or lager, a bottle (e.g. Bacardi\nBreezer), or a single measure of spirits.\nProblem alcohol use\nThis was assessed as: `over the past 12 months, on how\nmany days did you drink five or more alcoholic drinks in\na row?' and `over the past 12 months, on how many days\nhave you got drunk on alcohol?'. Both indices of drinking\nbehaviour have been used to define problem drinking in\nprevious research [1,2,31]. Response options ranged\nfrom 1 (never) to 5 (most days). Scores were strongly\nassociated (Spearman's r = 0.69), and combined\nwhereby the highest endorsement from either behaviour\nwas taken as the measure of problem alcohol use. For the\npresent analysis, individuals were recoded into those who\nhad never drunk alcohol in their life, those who had not\nengaged in problem alcohol use more than twice in the\nlast year and those who had engaged in problem alcohol\nuse more than twice in the last year (i.e. drinking until\ndrunk or drinking five or more drinks in a row in the last\nyear).\nFriend's alcohol use\nFriend's alcohol use was assessed with the question: `of\nyour three best friends (apart from your twin), how many\ndrink alcohol at least once a month?'. Response options\nranged from 0 (none) to 3 (all three).\nFinally, we created a composite score of twin-sharing\nof best friends by averaging the responses of both twins to\nthe question: `how many of your three best friends are\nalso your twin's best friends?'. Possible responses to these\nquestions ranged from 0 (none) to 3 (all 3). There was a\nsignificant association between twins as to the number of\nmeasure provided an index of shared friends for each\ntwin pair.\nStatistical analysis\nInitial analyses were conducted to examine whether\nfriends' alcohol use was associated with an increase in\nadolescent quantity of alcohol use and problem alcohol\nuse. As each twin is part of a twin pair, when conducting\nepidemiological analyses reduced variance due to the cor-\nrelation between twins' scores can cause high false posi-\ntive rates [33].To account for this the data were treated as\nequivalent to a two-stage cluster design, with twin pairs\nas the primary sampling unit [34], using the survey\nanalyses procedure in STATA (release 9) [35].\nUnivariate genetic analysis\nAs the alcohol use variables were ordinal, a threshold\nmodel was used whereby the underlying liability to each\nvariable is considered as normally, or approximately nor-\nmally, distributed in the population. This model assumes\nthat behaviour, e.g. problem alcohol use, will occur only if\nan individual's position on the liability distribution for\nthat behaviour is above a certain liability threshold [36].\nIn univariate analyses, twin data allowed us to estimate\nthe relative contribution of genetic and environmental\ninfluences on quantity of alcohol use and problem use. By\nconducting similar analyses on twin reports of friends'\nalcohol use, it is also possible to test whether there are\ngenetic influences on the adolescent that are correlated\nwith friend's alcohol use. The twin method is based on\ncomparisons of monozygotic (MZ) twins, who share\n100% of their genes in common, with dizygotic (DZ)\ntwins, who share on average 50% of their genes. For\ngenetically influenced behaviour we would expect greater\nMZ than DZ similarity. In the basic (ACE) model, variation\nis assumed to arise from three sources: (1) additive\ngenetic effects (a2); (2) common environmental effects\n(c2); and (3) unique environmental effects (e2). Common\nenvironmental effects serve to make twins more similar to\none another, while unique environmental effects tend to\nmake the individuals in a twin pair less similar [37].\nGenetic analyses using a structural equation model-\nling approach and full information maximum likelihood\nestimation with raw ordinal data were undertaken with\nthe software package Mx [38]. Conventional tests of fit\nare not appropriate for this type of analysis; however, the\nrelative difference in the fit of minus twice the log-\nlikelihood between submodels is approximately distrib-\nuted as c2. Thus, it is possible to compare more complex\nmodels with simpler models, for example a model includ-\ning gender differences in aetiology with one that includes\nno gender differences, and assess on the grounds of par-\nsimony which is the best-fitting model. To test whether a\nmodel represents a good fit of the data, the model is com-\npared to a `perfect' fitting model, referred to as a saturated\nmodel, in which the variance and covariance of the data\nis freely modelled. If the model is not significantly differ-\nent from the saturated model, it represents a good fit to\nWhen investigating the genetic influences on friends'\nbehaviour it is possible that MZ twins share more friends\nthan DZ twins. This would represent a violation of the\n`equal environments assumption', which assumes that\nMZ and DZ twins are correlated equally in their exposure\nto environmental factors of importance for the trait\nunder study and would result in an inflated heritability\nestimate for friends' alcohol use [40]. In addition, the\nextent to which friends' alcohol use is correlated with\nadolescent own alcohol use could lead to a greater resem-\nblance between MZ twins and an inflated heritability\nestimate for this variable. Based on the significant corre-\nlation between increased sharing of best friends and\nsharing of best friends in MZ twins (Mann\u00adWhitney\nbest friends when conducting the genetic analyses by\nallowing the threshold to vary as a function of the\nnumber of shared friends [41]. The threshold is modelled\nas a simple linear function: ti\n= t + sharedbestfriendsi\nts\n,\nwhere t is the population baseline threshold (for individu-\nals with 0 shared best friends), ts\nmodels the regression of\nthe threshold on the number of shared best friends, and\nsharedbestfriendsi\nis the number of shared best friends of\nthe individual i\n[41]. The same approach was used to\ncontrol for possible age effects (see below).\nIt is plausible, particularly with substance use such as\nalcohol use, that the behaviour of a twin may have an\nimpact on the same behaviour in the other twin. This is\ntermed `sibling interaction' and can take two forms,\nsibling competition and sibling cooperation [34]. In traits\nmeasured on an ordinal scale we would expect a sibling\ninteraction to result in differences in threshold levels and\nin the prevalence of individuals in extreme categories for\nMZ and DZ twins [37]. This can be tested by assessing\nwhether the MZ and DZ twin thresholds can be equated\nwithout a significant drop in fit. We found that MZ and DZ\nthresholds could be equated for all variables, suggesting\nthat there was no significant effect of sibling interaction\n(results available from the corresponding author upon\nrequest).\nWith a sample of twins reared together that includes\nopposite sex DZ pairs, it is possible to test for qualitative\nand quantitative gender differences in the aetiology of\nbehaviour [37]. A sex limitation model that includes\nqualitative gender differences is referred to as a `general\neffects model' and can be specified to assume a (partially)\ndifferent genetic or common environmental aetiology for\nmales and females. A sex limitation model that includes\nquantitative gender differences but no qualitative gender\ndifferences (i.e. has the same genetic and environmental\naetiology but differences in magnitude for males and\nfemales) is referred to as the `common effects model'. A\nmodel with no gender differences (i.e. the genetic and\nenvironmental estimates for males and females are\nequated) is referred to as a `sex homogeneity', or `no sex\neffects model' [37]. By comparing the fit of minus twice\nthe log-likelihood and the change in degrees of freedom\nbetween these models it is possible to test for significant\ngender differences in aetiology. However, the two alter-\nnate forms of the general effects sex limitation model\n(i.e. qualitative differences in genetic versus common\nenvironmental influence) are not nested and therefore\ncomparisons of alternative indices of fit such as Aikake's\ninformation criterion (AIC) [42] are necessary when\nselecting the most appropriate model [37].\nGiven the likelihood of an association between age and\nthe level of alcohol use and friends' alcohol use, an age\ncorrection was employed which adjusts the threshold for\neach twin according to his or her age on the distribution of\nliability to substance use, using the same method as\ndescribed for controlling for sharing of best friends [41].\nWe also tested for quantitative differences in aetiology due\nto age by assessing whether the genetic and environmen-\ntal estimates can be equated for individuals from different\nage groups without a significant drop in fit. For this analy-\nsis, the sample was divided into early (12\u00ad14 years old,\ngroups. Although dividing the sample in this way will lead\nto a reduction of power to detect differences, we can con-\nclude tentatively that there was no evidence for quantita-\ntive differences in aetiology due to age (results available\nfrom the corresponding author upon request).\nBivariate genetic analysis\nIn bivariate analyses, we tested whether genetic and envi-\nronmental influences on the twins' alcohol use and\nproblem use were correlated with those influencing their\nGenetic and environmental influences on peer and adolescent alcohol use 897\nfriends' use. Given that in the literature there is evidence\nof both friends influencing an adolescent's alcohol use\nand vice versa [6], and as the data used in the current\nanalyses were cross-sectional, it was not possible to\nassume a direction of effect between these variables. As\nsuch, a bivariate correlated factors model was fitted to the\ndata (see Fig. 1).This is equivalent to a bivariate Cholesky\ndecomposition model but makes no assumptions about\nthe direction of causation [43]. It gives estimates of the\ngenetic (rG), common environment (rC) and unique envi-\nronment (rE) correlation between two variables of inter-\nest. These correlations are independent of the size of the\nestimates of genetic and environmental influences on the\nvariables of interest.\nRESULTS\nFigures for quantity of alcohol use showed that 69% of\nadolescents drank alcohol less than six times in a typical\nweek. Sixteen per cent of adolescents had never had a\ndrink of alcohol, while 15% reported consuming more\nthan six drinks in a typical week. Figures for problem\nalcohol use indicated that of the 84% of adolescents who\ndrank alcohol, 24% reported drinking until drunk or con-\nsuming five or more drinks in a row more than twice in\nthe past 12 months. Adolescent reports of the number of\nclose friends who used alcohol showed that 19% had one\nclose friend who drank alcohol at least once a month,\n17% had two close friends who drank alcohol at least\nonce a month and 33% had three close friends who drank\nalcohol at least once a month.

It indicates that the no sex\neffects (sex homogeneity) model provides the best fit for all\nvariables, suggesting that there were no quantitative or\nqualitative gender difference in aetiology. This model also\nequates the thresholds for males and females, suggesting\nthat there was no difference in prevalence for males and\nfemales. Estimates of a2, c2, e2 appear in Table 2 as part\nof the bivariate analysis. The results for friends' alcohol\nuse indicate significant genetic (approximately 28%),\ncommon environment (approximately 36.5%) and\nunique environment (approximately 35.5%) influences.\nFor quantity of alcohol use the majority of the variance\nwas explained by genetic influences (61%), although\nboth common environment (20%) and unique environ-\nment (19%) were also significant. Similarly, for problem\nalcohol use, genetic influences explained the largest pro-\nportion of variance (46%) although common environ-\nment (29%) and unique environment (25%) were also\nsignificant. The best-fitting models were not significantly\ndifferent from the fully saturated models (see Table 1),\nsuggesting that they represented a good fit of the data.\nBivariate genetic model fitting\nSignificant genetic and environmental correlations were\nfound between friends' alcohol use with adolescent quan-\ntity of alcohol use and with problem use (see Table 2).\nThe only exception was a non-significant unique environ-\nmental correlation between friends' alcohol use and\nadolescent own quantity of alcohol use. The bivariate\nanalyses did not provide a significantly worse fit than the\nfully saturated model, suggesting that they represented a\ngood fit to the data.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first study to examine the genetic relationship\nbetween peer alcohol use and adolescent alcohol use. The\nstudy replicated previous findings of a strong association\nbetween peer and adolescent alcohol use [5\u00ad7]. The re-\nsults indicated a high level of overlap between the genetic\ninfluences on both friends' drinking and adolescent\nAdolescent\nAlcohol Use\nFriends'\nAlcohol Use\nrE\nrG\nrC\nFigure 1 Correlated factors model. Additive genetic, common\nenvironment and unique environment variance contributions to\nfriends' alcohol use and adolescent alcohol use are indicated by A1,\nC1, E1 and A2, C2, E2, respectively. rG, rC and rE represent the\ncorrelations between genetic, common environment and unique\nenvironment contributions to peer alcohol use and adolescent\nalcohol use. For clarity of presentation, the figure depicts one\nmember of a twin pair\nalcohol use, as indicated by the significant genetic corre-\nlations (r = 0.6\u00ad0.7). However, the results also emphasize\nthe importance of environmental factors with the major-\nity of the common environmental factors being shared.\nConsistent with previous studies of adolescent alcohol\nuse, genetic influences were found to be important and no\ngender differences in aetiology were found [3]. Genetic\nestimates were slightly higher than has been reported, but\nas the genetic aetiology of adolescent alcohol use has not\nbeenstudiedpreviouslyinUK-basedsamples,itisnotclear\nwhether this effect is specific to alcohol use within the\nCaStaNET sample or to the United Kingdom in general.\nHowever, the prevalence rates in CaStaNET were consis-\ntent with those reported in large studies of alcohol use in\nthe United Kingdom [2]. Genetic influences were slightly\nstronger for quantity of alcohol use (a2 = 0.61) than\nalcohol problem use (a2 = 0.46). This may be because\nalcohol problem use was assessed as whether the problem\nuse had occurred twice in the last year (rather than the\nregularity of it occurring), and this may be more influ-\nenced by environmental opportunities to drink to excess.\nPeers have been referred to as an important environ-\nmental risk factor for adolescent substance use and\nproblem use. However, our results indicate that the situ-\nation is more complicated. We found that genetic influ-\nences explained about 30% of the variation of twin\nreports of friends' alcohol use. This is compatible with a\npeer selection process whereby twins seek out particular\npeers or peers seek out the twin with whom to be friends,\nwhich is partly genetically influenced. The results could\nalso be explained by the adolescents' individual charac-\nteristics, given that peer selection and friendship main-\ntenance are influenced by attitudes, personality and\nbehaviour [12,13]. Both attitudes and personality have\nbeen shown to be, at least in part, genetically influenced\nFor both peer and adolescent alcohol use no age or\ngender differences in aetiology were found, nor evidence\nfor sibling interaction for alcohol use. A strong cor-\nrelation was found between the genetic factors influ-\nencing adolescent alcohol use and friends' alcohol use\n(r = 0.6\u00ad0.7). This is consistent with the possibility of\nrGE (gene\u00adenvironment correlation). As mentioned pre-\nviously, three types of rGE have been posited: passive\n(where the parental genes cause the correlation), active\n(where the subject's own genes make him/her seek\ncertain environments) and evocative (where a subject's\nown genes make him/her more likely to be selected by\nothers) [16,17]. The occurrence of both active and\nevocative rGE processes on drinking habits is plausible,\nwhere genes influence the choice of friends (who in turn\nmay further affect liability to consume alcohol).

AIC: Aikake's information criterion.\nrGE is also possible whereby parental genes contribute to\nboth the genotype and the environment of their children.\nThus, for example, genetic factors influence parent\u00adchild\nrelations [46] and parent\u00adchild relations influence peer\nselection (with poor parent\u00adchild relationships quality is\nassociated with affiliation with deviant peers; [47]). Given\nthat the relationship between peer and own alcohol use is\npotentially reciprocal [6], it is plausible that genetic\nfactors create a risk environment which influences ado-\nlescent alcohol use. Given the cross-sectional nature of\nthe present study, it was not possible to further distin-\nguish between these processes. Peer influences are one of\nthe strongest risk factors for adolescent alcohol involve-\nment [3] and therefore a powerful potential domain for\nintervention. These results suggest individual differences\nin interactions with peers, which are influenced by\ngenetic as well as environmental influences. It appears\nthat to be most efficacious, peer-based interventions need\nto take into account these individual differences in\naddressing the relationship between peer influences and\nadolescent alcohol use.\nThe correlation between common environmental\ninfluences on friends' alcohol use and adolescent own\nvalue, our results suggest that the common environmen-\ntal influences on alcohol use overlap almost entirely with\nthose that impact friends' alcohol use. Although rater\neffects may have contributed to these findings (see below),\nanother study has provided similar results. Walden and\ncolleagues [4] found that the relationship between peer\ndeviance and alcohol use was explained by common envi-\nronmental factors (although they were not examining\npeer alcohol use per se).\nIn the present study, the peer influences examined\nwere those of the behaviour of the adolescent's three\nclosest friends, hence the importance of peer selection as\na possible mechanism. An important caveat is that peer\nrelationships are not restricted to dyadic relationships\nwith friends, but involve small and larger groups of\nfriends [48] and fellow school pupils [4]. The peer group\ninvestigated (friends, classmates) and whether group or\nindividual relationships are examined have potentially\nimportant implications for the derived pattern of results.\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations of the present study. The\nsame rater reported their own and their close friends'\nalcohol use, which may have led to shared method vari-\nance inflating covariance artificially between the two\nassessments. Because adolescent reports of peer drinking\nmay include bias [19], as their accounts may measure\nimperfectly peer's actual use and reflect their own use\n[49], it is possible that the genetic influences on perceived\npeer use may index genetic influences on the adolescent's\nreporting, and this needs to be taken into account when\ninterpreting our findings. Although very few studies have\npresented correlations between perceived and actual peer\nuse, one study in adolescents has reported that the corre-\n[24]. Furthermore, our results are in agreement with an\nearlier univariate twin study that was based on peers'\nown reports of a combined measure of alcohol and\ncigarette use [19] and also found evidence of genetic\ninfluences.\nAlthough no quantitative age differences were\nobserved, without longitudinal data it is impossible to\ndiscount the possibility of qualitative age differences\n(specific aetiological influences coming online at different\nages). Finally, we took a conservative approach to control\nfor twins sharing the same peers. However, this greater\nsharing of friends may be due to genetic influences on\nfriendship formation and therefore represent a valid\ngenetic influence on peer alcohol use. If this were the\ncase, our estimates of genetic influences on peer alcohol\nuse would be overly conservative.\nThe implications of these findings are that friends'\nalcohol use should not be considered an entirely environ-\nmental risk factor for adolescent alcohol use and problem\nuse. Genetic influences can be expected to play a role in\nindividual differences in alcohol use by adolescents as\nwell as contribute to who their friends are and to what\nextent these friends use alcohol. These findings point to\nthe possibility of gene\u00adenvironment correlations in ado-\nlescent alcohol use. However, further research is required\nto increase understanding of the type and form such cor-\nrelations take and the processes by which they exert their\neffects. The high common environment correlation also\nimplies that environmental influences on twins that\nmake them more similar in drinking behaviour are the\nsame as those that make their friends' drinking behaviour\nmore similar to their own. These findings contribute to\nunderstanding of the mechanisms by which friends'\nalcohol use influences adolescent drinking behaviour.\n"
