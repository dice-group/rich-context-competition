A layperson's description of the physical\noperating principle is given for the main classes of technology that have been tested in Australian waters. The Australian\nmarine domain possesses among the world's most energetic wave-energy resources, driven by powerful mid-latitude\nwesterly winds. The northern coast of Western Australia has tidal ranges significant on a global scale, and some\ngeographical features around the continent have local tidal resonances. The East Australian Current, one of the world's\nmajor western boundary currents, runs along the eastern Australian seaboard, offering potential for ocean-current\nenergy. Sea-water temperatures in the tropical north-east of Australia may permit ocean thermal energy conversion.\nWhile this abundance of resources makes Australia an ideal location for technology development, the population is\nhighly concentrated in a few large cities, and transmission infrastructure has developed over a century to supply cities\nfrom traditional power plants. Several wave-power developments have resulted in demonstration of deployments in\nAustralian waters, three of which have been grid connected. Trials of tidal devices have also occurred, while other\nclasses of ocean renewable energy have not yet been trialled.

Concepts for extracting power\nfrom the seas are not new, with energy having been\nextracted from tidal mills since at least the 6th century\n(Murphy, 2006), the first wave-power patent filed in\nthe 21st century has seen significant government invest-\nment added to what has hitherto been largely private\nventure capital\u00adfunded developments. Most notably, the\nestablishment of the Australian Renewable Energy\nAgency (ARENA) by the Australian Federal Government\nin 2012, plus significant support from some of the State\nGovernments, has accelerated development as well as\nresearch. In a major review and analysis, the status and\neconomic potential of Australian marine renewable\nenergy was reviewed by Behrens et al. (2012a); they\ncovered preliminary-level assessments of the available\nresource, including wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-\ncurrent energy and ocean-thermal energy conversion\n(OTEC). Major examples of technologies developed\noverseas were reviewed, and an up-to-date survey of all\nmarine renewable energy developments in Australia at\nthe time was presented. Environmental and multiple-\nuse issues associated with Australia's marine domain\nwere also canvassed. In a study specific to wave power,\nBehrens et al. (2012b) also combined an assessment of\nthe wave resource with models of generic classes of\nPioneering developments of marine\nrenewable energy in Australia\nRichard Manasseh1, Kathleen L McInnes2 and Mark A Hemer3\n Keywords\nRenewable energy, marine, ocean, Australia, operating principles, recent history\n1Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia\n2CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Aspendale, VIC, Australia\n3CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Battery Point, TAS, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nRichard Manasseh, Swinburne University of Technology, PO Box 218,\nHawthorn, VIC 3122, Melbourne, Australia.\nEmail: rmanasseh@swin.edu.au\nSpecial Issue Article\nocean wave-energy converters (WECs) to predict the lev-\nelised cost of electricity around Australia. Hemer et al.\n(2016) updated the wave resource assessment.\nThe fundamental differences between wave energy,\ntidal energy, ocean-current energy and OTEC are detailed\nin a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). Wave\nenergy is fundamentally a concentrated and averaged form\nof wind energy, generated by winds blowing over the\nWorld's ocean basins, and hence, wave energy is large in\noceans subjected to strong, steady winds. Winds are cre-\nated by differences in the sun's heat between the tropics\nand poles. Ocean-current energy is also due to the action of\nthe winds, modified by the earth's rotation. Meanwhile,\nocean-thermal energy is more directly due to solar heating\nof the sea surface. All the above-mentioned forms of ocean\nrenewable energy thus derive ultimately from the sun's\nheat. In contrast, tidal energy is due to the gravity of celes-\ntial bodies, mostly the moon, and varies geographically\ndue to the size and shape of continents, bays and inlets.\nCompared with better-known forms of renewable\nenergy such as wind and solar power, marine renewable\nenergy demonstrates great diversity, complexity and, once\ninstalled in the water, the operating principles are largely\ninvisible to the layperson. There has been no clear, detailed\ndescription of the operating principles of the marine\nrenewable energy technologies used in Australia (and\nindeed no such description anywhere, to the best of our\nknowledge) that would be comprehensible to a lay reader-\nship. For example, it is not unusual to hear laypersons con-\nfusing wave and tidal power, despite their operating\nprinciples being vastly different and their geographic and\neconomic opportunities being complementary rather than\ncompetitive. Thus, there is a need to review Australian\ndevelopments in the context of the resource they tap and\nthe specific principle they exploit.\nThe aim of this review is to describe in detail develop-\nments since the last review in 2012. We aim at a lay reader-\nship and include explanations of the operating principles\nsuch that the success, failure or potential of each develop-\nment can be judged from an informed perspective.\nHowever, we do not review all proposed or trialled tech-\nnologies, focusing on a selection that is representative of\nthe major classes of device that have been trialled in the\nocean. We also speculate on the prospects for the technolo-\ngies and on the true advantages Australia may offer in this\narea of renewable energy. Examples of levelised costs\nof electricity for some resources are given in Table 5\n(section `Engineering and economic efficiencies') of a\ncompanion article (Manasseh et al., 2017), which focuses\non the integration of marine renewable energy with the\nneeds of coastal communities and includes a detailed sys-\ntem for decision-making on appropriate technologies.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows: In\nsection `Geographical and climatic factors', we discuss the\ngeographic and climatic factors that determine the marine\nrenewable energy resource in Australia. The resources and\ntechnologies related to wave energy, along with an histori-\ncal account of device deployments in Australia, are\nreviewed in section `Australian wave energy', while those\nrelated to tidal energy are discussed in section `Australian\ntidal energy'. Ocean-current power and OTEC are dis-\ncussed briefly in section `Other marine renewables', while\na concluding discussion is presented in section `Discussion\nand conclusion'.\nGeographical and climatic factors\nAustralia's 34,000 km of coastline extends from a tropical\nclimate in the north through a subtropical to a mid-latitude\nclimate in the south (McInnes et al., 2016). Thus, the\ncoastline north of approximately 20\u00b0S (Figure 1) experi-\nences a wet monsoon season with winds mainly from the\nnorth-west from about October to March and a dry season\nwhere south-east trade winds prevail from about April to\nSeptember. The seasons in the south of the continent are\ninfluenced by the movement of the subtropical ridge, a\nzone of atmospheric high pressure which delineates the\ntrade easterly winds to its north and the mid-latitude west-\nerlies to its south. The subtropical ridge reaches its maxi-\nmum northward extent at around 30\u00b0S during the summer\nmonths (December to February) and around 40\u00b0S during\nthe winter months (June to August) (McInnes et al., 2016).\nSouth of the subtropical ridge, mid-latitude low-pressure\nsystems and their associated fronts bring powerful\nFigure 1. Map of Australia showing the electricity\ntransmission lines and offshore bathymetry with the\ncontinental shelf indicated by the 500 m isobath. Locations\nof marine-energy trials in Australia are also indicated.\nSolid surrounded circles represent wave-energy trials, and\npentagons represent tidal-energy trials, while symbols with\ndotted surrounds indicate locations where pre-trial feasibility\nassessments have been undertaken. Further details are\nprovided in Table 1.\n52 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\nwesterly to south-westerly winds and associated wave cli-\nmate to the region.\nDue to Australia's arid interior, approximately 80% of\nthe population of 23 million people live at or near the\ncoast. The majority (approximately 80%) of the total\npopulation live along the eastern and south-eastern sea-\nboard from Queensland to South Australia including\nTasmania (Figure 1). This is reflected in the connectivity\nof Australia's electricity grid in the east of the continent\nas compared to the west (Figure 1).\nAustralia's vast coastline gives rise to a large potential\nmarine-energy resource. In particular, its extensive\nSouthern Ocean exposure means it has one of the richest\nwave-energy resources of any country (Lewis et al.,\n2011). The nature of the marine-energy resource in a\ngiven location is influenced by attributes such as conti-\nnental shelf width, bathymetric depth and coastline orien-\ntation in relation to prevailing weather conditions. For\nexample, large tidal amplitudes coincide with relatively\nwide and shallow continental shelf regions where bottom\nfriction amplifies the maximum water levels. The north-\nwest shelf of Australia has the largest tidal range in the\ncountry with a maximum tidal range at King Sound\n(Figure 1 and Table 1) of up to 11.8 m. A large tidal range\nof around 5 m also occurs on the Queensland coast\nthe wave-energy resource near to shore on the north-west\nshelf and Northern Territory is limited (Hemer et al.,\n2016). This is in part due to coral reefs, found along these\ncoastlines, which enhance wave dissipation offshore\nAustralia's east coast also features a major southward\nflowing boundary current \u00ad The East Australian Current\n(EAC) \u00ad which is the western extent of the South Pacific\ntropical gyre circulation. A comprehensive assessment of\nthe resource potential of the EAC has not been undertaken\n(Behrens et al., 2012a); however, Griffin and Hemer\n(2010) indicate that this resource (of order tens of ter-\nawatt-hours/year) is probably much less than Australia's\nelectricity needs. Ocean thermal and salinity gradients\nalso offer a potential marine-energy resource in Australian\nwaters. Although detailed assessments of this resource\nhave not been made yet, Behrens et al. (2012a) identified\nthat the most promising Australian OTEC sites are\nlocated at distances of >100 km off the North Queensland\ncoast.\nAustralian wave energy\nResources\nBased on a comprehensive assessment of wave-energy\nresource inAustralia, Hemer et al. (2016) estimate the total\navailable energy is an order of magnitude larger than the\n(Department of Industry and Science, 2015), confirming\nthe magnitude of the wave resource is not a constraint to its\nfuture uptake. The vast majority of this resource is availa-\nble to the southern coastal region with 1455 TW h/year\nestimated at the 25 m-deep contour from 29\u00b0S on the\nWestern Australian coast to 148\u00b0E on the southern tip of\nTasmania including western Victoria. By contrast, the\nwave-energy resource over northern Western Australia\n(north of 23.5\u00b0S) and Northern Territory at the 25 m con-\ntour is only 61 TW h/year.\nWave variability is also an important consideration for\nwave-energy extraction. At the 25 m isobath (the depth\naround which many wave devices are presently being\ntested), much of the southern, mid-latitude coastal region\nis also favourable because it displays relatively low varia-\nbility in wave energy with respect to the total available\nwave energy. Large waves are generally not much greater\nthan the wave height at which most energy is received, and\nepisodes of minimum wave heights and energy (signifi-\ncant wave height, Hs, of <1 m) are relatively short-lived\n(durations typically <1 day) and relatively uncommon\n(typically >100 days between events). Conversely, in the\ntropical north, the lower available wave resource is also\ncharacterised by a larger ratio of large waves to mean wave\nheight due to the occurrence of tropical cyclones. This\nregion also experiences periods of minimal wave energy\nthat are more frequent and of longer duration (Hemer\nReasons for the diversity of WEC designs\nFundamental factors of physics and engineering have led\nto the development of a great diversity of WEC designs\nworldwide. Significant research and development began in\ncentury (Falc\u00e3o, 2010). In the present day, there are over\n250 wave-energy companies (The European Marine\nEnergy Centre, 2016), mostly with technologically distinct\ndevices. On first glance, many of these devices appear\ntotally different. The facile conclusion would be that the\nideal technology has not yet emerged, and that investors\nand governments should wait for clarity before serious\ninvestment. However, this conclusion would be incorrect\nsince, as explained in Manasseh et al. (2017), there is much\ngreater similarity than first appears. Most, though not all,\nWECs are designed to have a natural frequency with which\nthey will oscillate if disturbed from a state of rest. This\nnatural frequency is designed by the engineer to match the\nfrequency of the prevailing ocean waves; when the fre-\nquencies match, resonance occurs, corresponding to a\nlarge motion of the machine relative to the water and con-\nsequently a large extraction of power from ocean waves\n(Manasseh et al., 2017). The enormous advantage of\nTable 1.

The maximum theoretical length of wave\ncrest that a resonating point-absorber WEC can absorb, da\n,\nda\n=\n\n\nwhere  is the wavelength of the ocean waves (the length\nfrom crest to crest). However, there are very many types of\nmechanisms that have a natural frequency. Indeed, all the\nAustralian WECs that have been ocean-tested, apart from\none (see section `Non-resonating developments'), are res-\nonators. The reason for the diversity in WEC designs is the\nunfortunate \u00ad and interesting \u00ad combination of two very\nsimple issues, as detailed below.\nFirst, the simplest way to generate electricity is by\nmechanically rotating a shaft in one direction only. Once\nthere is a rotating shaft, via gears and an electrical machine,\nelectricity can be generated, transmitted and sold.\nHowever, the physics of wave action dictates that the\nmotive fluid, water, is inherently reciprocating: The water\nreverses its motion every cycle, going in one direction on\nthe wave crest and the opposite direction on the trough.\nThus, the momentum available for conversion into torque\nand useful power is constantly changing from positive to\nnegative, no matter which direction one chooses. Contrast\nthis with the water exiting a dam, which flows solely\ndown-hill, or with the wind, which is air flowing solely\nfrom atmospheric high- to low-pressure systems; in these\ncases, the motive fluid flows in one direction.\nIf the motive fluid, be it air or water, is moving in one\ndirection, or even mostly in one direction, the technol-\nogy necessary to extract useful power from this unidirec-\ntional flow is simple. All that is required is a single\nmoving part, the turbine. A turbine is a rotating shaft\nwith fixed blades attached to it. Whether in the form of a\nmedieval water wheel or modern hydroelectric turbine,\nan ancient windmill or modern wind turbine, the concept\nis the same: a rotating shaft, with blades fixed to it.\nHowever, for reciprocating motion such as that due to\nwaves, an efficient transformation to rotating-shaft\nmotion is not possible with a single moving part. For\nexample, the efficient reciprocating-to-rotary transfor-\nmation inside the classical internal combustion engine\nrequires three parts: the piston, the crank and the crank-\nshaft, connected by two joints and a sliding interface.\nMeanwhile, the cup anemometer is an example of\nsingle-moving-part mechanism that turns in one direc-\ntion irrespective of the direction of airflow; it is fine for\nmeasuring the speed of wind flow but very inefficient if\none tried to extract useful power from it.\nThe second issue is that machines in the ocean must be\nengineered to minimise the number of moving joints in the\nwater. The tripartite mechanism of the internal combustion\nengine functions perfectly in a sealed, lubricated housing.\nIn the ocean, however, biofouling, sediments and salt\nwater make joints problematic. Moreover, for reasons\nexplained in section `Pitching developments', the machines\nmust be very large, implying very large forces are applied\nto large joints subjected to biofouling, sediment ingress\nand saline attack.\nWhile some WECs have been designed to generate\nelectricity directly from a reversing linear motion, this\nentails its own issues of electrical engineering. Thus, the\nmajority of WEC designs achieve some form of recipro-\ncating-to-rotary transformation. There are very many ways\nof doing this, and due to the concomitant need to minimise\nunderwater joints and sliders, none of the designs is per-\nfect. Consequently, WEC design is an appealing challenge\nfor inventors. Moreover, mechanical devices can be con-\nceived without a formal engineering education, and thus,\nmore WECs are being invented every year. Some can be\nshown by a back-of-the-envelope calculation to be unreal-\nistic, but many others are genuinely innovative concepts\nnot readily disproven.\nFurthermore, the ease with which new inventions can\nbe created means that many new patents can be filed.\nThis, in turn, makes many small start-up companies\npossible, each based on unique intellectual property (IP).\nDespite the relative ease of filing IP, the ability of a com-\npany to demonstrate its idea is dependent on being able to\nattract significant amounts of capital.\nThis diversity means that even the task of classifying\nWECs is not simple. Classifications are discussed in detail\nin a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). For the\npurposes of this article, it is sufficient to note thatAustralian\nWEC designs have covered many WEC types, possibly\ndue to the ease of patenting inherent to WEC concepts\nrather to an intent to match the WEC type to the applica-\ntion. The operating-principle classification proposed in\nTechnologies\nLiquid-pendulum (oscillating water column) developments.The\noscillating water column (OWC) was the first concept for\nextracting power from ocean waves to be implemented in\npractice and has led to the longest-surviving installations\ncept to be implemented in Australia. The survivability of\nthe OWC can be understood once its operating principle is\nappreciated. In its most elementary form, it is simply a\ntube open at both ends, with its top in the air and immersed\nin water by a length L. It is easy to show that its natural\nfrequency f0\n(s-1) is given by\nf\nL\n=\n\ng\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (Figure 2(a)).\nThis is the equation of a pendulum of length L; hence, it is\na natural oscillator. Indeed, it is possible to observe one or\ntwo natural oscillation cycles using a large drinking straw\ndipped at depth L into a glass of water, sucking up a column\nof water and then letting the water fall back into the glass.\nLike any natural oscillator, it will resonate when driven by\nfrequencies close to f0\n. Thus, L is `tuned' during the\nmachine's design to match the prevailing frequency of\nocean waves where the machine is to operate (Manasseh\net al., 2017). There are no moving parts in the water, a\nmajor contributor to the simplicity and survivability of the\nOWC concept. However, the need to transform oscillatory\nmotion into rotary motion, as noted in section `Reasons for\nthe diversity of WEC designs', is nonetheless still an issue.\nTo generate electricity, most OWC designs use a bi-direc-\ntional turbine mounted the air above the water column. The\nturbine rotates in the same direction irrespective of the\ndirection of airflow alternately pushed and pulled by the\nwater surface. The bi-directional turbine may be of a type\nwith fixed blades, which is inevitably less effective than\nconventional unidirectional turbines. Alternatively, it may\nbe a turbine whose blades can be rotated to vary their pitch,\nwhich introduces very many moving parts, albeit only in\nA `back-of-the-envelope' calculation using equation (2)\nimmediately explains the issue mentioned in section\n`Reasons for the diversity of WEC designs': The machines\nmust be very large. Ocean swell, which contains the highest\nenergy, has a low frequency. On the coasts of Australia\nexposed to Southern Ocean swell, this frequency is typi-\n. s- (Behrens et al., 2012b). To match even\n. s- value requires a length L of about 25 m, The\n`pendulum' must be the height of an eight-storey building.\nFigure 2. Illustration of the operating principles for (a) liquid pendulum, (b) mechanical pendulum and (c) heaving-buoy devices. In (a)\nand (b), the natural oscillating frequency is given by equation (2), and in (c), the natural oscillating frequency is given by equation (3).\n56 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\nA further advantage of the OWC, partially mitigating\nthe need for installation in great depth, is that its theoreti-\ncal natural frequency given by equation (2) is maintained\nirrespective of the geometry of the underwater part of the\n`tube'. As long as there is a total length L of enclosed duct,\nchamber or pipe, this length can theoretically be any shape\nat all, not simply a tube pointing straight down. Indeed,\nmany OWC designs have a `bent duct', such that the length\nL is literally L-shaped, with the base of the `L' horizontal\nand thus water flowing horizontally into and out of the\nunderwater opening. This means the device can be situated\nin water that is shallower than L, opening up a wider range\nof sites. The larger the diameter (width) of the duct, the\ngreater the power that may be extracted; power in the order\nof 1 MW requires a width approaching 10 m or more.\nFurthermore, the pressure exerted by passing waves can\nvary with depth, which has consequences for the design of\nall WECs. Classical theory due to Airy in 1841 (e.g. Gill,\n1982) shows that in `deep' water, defined as deeper than\nabout 1/2 of the wavelength, the pressure and velocity\ndecrease exponentially with depth. The wavelength can be\nover 100 m on the Southern Ocean and southern Indian\nOcean coasts of Australia (Behrens et al., 2012b). In `shal-\nlow' water, defined as water shallower than 1/20 of the\nwavelength, the pressure and velocity (the `wave action')\nare invariant with depth. Water depths between 1/2 and\n1/20 of the wavelength are called intermediate, and the\nwave motion decreases with depth, though not as rapidly\nas in deep water. Thus, in all but shallow-water regimes,\nhaving a bent duct enables the entrance to the duct to be\ncloser to the surface and to be subjected to a greater forc-\ning, permitting greater energy extraction from waves.\nNonetheless, to benefit from the maximum in wave motion\nat the surface, the required water column length would\nhave to be shaped into a `U', not a `L', and indeed,\nU-shaped OWCs have been constructed overseas (Arena\net al., 2013). It is also worth noting that at every bend in\nthe water column, energy is lost to vortices formed at the\nbends (Fleming et al., 2012) and thus is unavailable for\nelectricity generation.\nThe first OWCs were installed in the 19th century off\nthe US East coast, not to generate electricity but to power\nnavigation-warning whistles, and there were 34 such\ngenerating OWCs were developed in 1910, when\nMr Bochaix-Praceique supplied his house with 1 kW\nof electricity using an OWC concept (Palme, 1920).\nSeveral further examples were installed in Japan, Europe\net al., 2010); it was grid connected and operated for about\n20 years while subjected to several improvements.\nThe grid-connected 500 kW LIMPET OWC at Islay,\nScotland, United Kingdom, commenced operations in\n2000, following a grid-connected trial of a smaller machine\nthat lasted 9 years (Heath, 2012). The LIMPET plant was\nclosed in 2013 following a strategic-direction change by\nthe operating company (US Department of Energy, 2016).\nSignificantly, the long-lived installations in India and the\nUnited Kingdom were shore mounted and thus unsinkable\nand easily accessible for maintenance.\nThe first Australian OWC developments were made by\nthe company Energetech, founded in 1997 in Sydney by\nTom Denniss; it changed its name to Oceanlinx (2016) in\n2007. It was initially funded by venture capital and eventu-\nally by Australian government grants. The company's first\ninstallation, denoted MK1, was a bent-duct OWC that sat\non the seabed in shallow water at Port Kembla, New South\nWales. It should be noted that on the eastern coast of\nAustralia, unlike the southern coast, peak wave frequen-\n. s- , so that,\nrecalling equation (2), machines can be smaller; for f0\n=\n0.2 s-1, the length L is about 6 m, the height of a two-storey\nbuilding, and for f0\ntrasts with the 25 m or more needed for the Southern\nOcean. Thus, pendulum-type machines on the Australian\nEast Coast may resonate with lengths between about 6\nand 25 m, depending on the actual local wave climate.\nHowever, by exploiting the bent-duct principle, the\nEnergetech machine did not need to be in water greater\nthan, say, 11 m deep. Thus, it could be constructed and\ndevice was redeveloped into a further prototype, denoted\nMK2, with a nominal generation capacity of 1 MW. The\nsystem included a parabolic underwater wall intended to\nfocus waves towards the water column (Carley and\nDenniss, 2000) and was also intended to produce desali-\nA larger, grid-connected, machine, the MK3, was\ninstalled at Port Kembla in March 2010. Similar to some of\nthe earliest OWC designs, the MK3 was designed to float\nand was moored to the seabed. It was designed to house a\nnumber of OWCs on a common platform, giving a total\ngeneration capacity of 2.5 MW and operated successfully\nwhen it broke its moorings in rough seas (Hasham, 2010).\nThe Port Kembla machines were of steel construction.\nOceanlinx received funding from ARENA (2014),\npermitting design and construction of a further prototype,\n`GreenWave'. By this stage, the company's key IP\nappeared to be the design of its bi-directional turbine\n(Carley and Denniss, 2000), although the internal structure\nof the ducting had also been subjected to significant\nresearch (Fleming et al., 2012). This machine's structure\nwas made of concrete and intended to sit on the seabed. A\nsingle turbine was rated at 1 MW. It was constructed in\nPort Adelaide, South Australia (Figure 3), where there is a\nsubmersible construction facility capable of handling\nthe 3000 t structure. The intended location was Port\nMacDonnell, South Australia, approximately 450 km\nsouth-east of Adelaide.\nIn March 2014, the concrete machine was successfully\nrendered buoyant with air bags and towing to Port\nMacDonnell commenced. However, rough seas damaged\nthe air bags during the tow (Australian Broadcasting\nCorporation, 2014), and it was damaged beyond repair\n(England, 2014). Thus, the firm was unable to meet con-\ntractual obligations imposed by investors and went into\nliquidation (England, 2014). However, the IP was trans-\nferred to a new corporate structure, and the company has\nemerged as a Hong Kong-based concern with plans to\ndeploy OWC technology in Taiwan (Oceanlinx, 2016).\nThese Australian developments remain the most ambi-\ntious developments of the OWC concept to date. They\nwent beyond the secure, shore-based OWCs or the tempo-\nrary trials of floating OWCs undertaken previously.\nMachines were deployed that were the outcome of a long\nseries of incremental trials and re-developments.\nIn general, due to the lack of moving parts in the water\nand thus easy integration into a wall, OWCs that are bot-\ntom mounted are well suited to protection of the coast\nfrom waves, an application that has been implemented in\nbut has not yet been planned in Australia. Coastal protec-\ntion is discussed in section `Discussion and conclusion'\nA new OWC concept, the `Wave Mill', was tested at the\nGold Coast, Queensland (Voropaev, 2016). This concept\n(Figure 4) realises an ingenious idea to avoid the need for\na bi-directional turbine. A row of OWCs is arranged at\nright angles to the incoming wave crests. The row is at\nleast as long as a wavelength of the incoming swell. When\nair is pushed out of each OWC, it passes through a one-\nway valve which is a simple flexible plate hinged at the\ntop, rather like a `cat flap'; the air exhausts into a common\nexhaust plenum chamber running parallel to the row. Air is\nsucked in from a one-way valve on the opposite side of\neach OWC, coming from a common inlet plenum cham-\nber. Because the row of OWCs is longer than a wavelength,\none OWC is always maximally exhausting air and another\nis maximally intaking air at any given time. The exhaust\nand inlet chambers communicate via a turbine that thus\nturns in one direction only. Moreover, the turbine turns at\na steady speed as long as the incoming swell is steady and\nnot changing in amplitude along the row. In contrast, the\nbi-directional turbines of other OWC concepts are con-\nstantly speeding up and slowing down, with maximum\nspeeds on the crest and trough. While one-way valves are\nused to rectify oscillatory flow to unidirectional flow in a\nfew other OWC designs (Heath, 2012), the Wave Mill\nappears to be the only concept that could achieve a con-\nstant turbine speed, at least for incoming waves that do not\nvary from wave to wave. One possible drawback is the\npower lost as the air passes through the valve; as noted\nbelow, this issue inevitably affects several technologies\nthat have been deployed.\nMechanical-pendulum developments.\nWhile the OWC's\noperating principle can be simplified to that of a liquid\npendulum, a rigid mechanical pendulum inherently oper-\nates with a natural frequency given by the pendulum equa-\ntion (2), as illustrated in Figure 2(b). Several concepts\nhave been developed and installed around the world (e.g.\nHenry et al., 2014), taking the form of underwater flaps or\ncylinders hinged at the bottom. The advantage of a bottom-\nhinged pendulum is that its maximum motion is close to\nthe surface, where (as noted in section `Reasons for the\ndiversity of WEC designs') the velocity and pressure\ninduced by waves are also maximum, permitting efficient\ntransfer of energy to the motion of the machine. This offers\nan advantage over the bent-duct OWC, which has an\nentrance below the surface. Since the length of the pendu-\nlum is determined by equation (2), and, unlike the OWC,\nthe length L must be straight, a mechanical-pendulum\nWEC must be deployed in water no shallower than L. Fur-\nthermore, as just noted, the maximum in wave action is at\nthe surface; to take advantage of this, the water in which it\nFigure 3.

Therefore,\nthere are more constraints on the siting of mechanical\npendulums.\nA machine called `BioWAVE' (Finnigan and Caska,\na company founded by Tim Finnigan in Sydney in 2006\n(Figure 5(a)). While this machine is described in this sec-\ntion as a mechanical pendulum, it has elements of the\nheaving buoy described in section `Heaving-buoy devel-\nopments'. The machine consists of three cylindrical cham-\nbers, arranged rather like the tines of a fork, which branch\nfrom a stem hinged at the bottom. The design in the form\nof parallel cylinders with gaps between them, rather than\nthe continuous solid flaps of similar mechanical pendulum\ntrialled elsewhere, was thought to create beneficial interac-\ntions between the cylinders. Each cylinder was thought to\nact as an individual device in an array (Caska and Finnigan,\n2007); it is known that array interactions of devices can\nincrease device output due to surface-wave radiative cou-\nit is not stated by the authors representing BPS, it is also\npossible that the design may allow it to benefit from an\nadditional resonance due to vortex-induced vibration\nEach cylinder is a buoyant chamber. The buoyancy can\nbe altered by flooding or purging the chambers as needed,\nimproving performance (Flocard and Finnigan, 2010,\n2012); this effectively changes L by shifting the centre of\nbuoyancy. If necessary, by flooding the chambers, the pen-\ndulum can be temporarily `sunk', laying it horizontally on\nthe seabed to avoid storm damage.\nAs with all WECs, the issue of transforming the recip-\nrocating motion into rotary motion needs to be addressed.\nThe BPS machine achieves this with hydraulic cylinders\nthat pressurise hydraulic fluid on both forward and back-\nward strokes via one-way valves. The high-pressure fluid\nis accumulated on-board and released to drive a conven-\ntional unidirectional generator. The on-board hydraulic\naccumulators and generator are promoted as a separate\ntechnology under the name `O-drive'. As in any system\ninvolving valves, energy will be lost as fluid passes through\nthe valves.\nThe hydraulic fluid could also provide some stiffness\nrestoring the pendulum to the vertical. This stiffness, plus\nthe variable-buoyancy spars (Flocard and Finnigan, 2012),\noffers the opportunity to `tune'the natural frequency of the\nmachine differently to the simple prediction of equation\n(2). Nonetheless, the length of the pendulum chosen by\nBPS of about 26 m is well predicted by equation (2) for the\nSouthern Ocean site it is intended for ( f0\n= -\n. s gives\nL 25 m). Recalling the definitions of `shallow', `interme-\ndiate' and `deep' water from section `Liquid-pendulum\n(oscillating water column) developments', and noting that\nvalues of the wavelength at this location would be roughly\nwater, where wave action does decrease with depth. These\ncombinations of four different concepts, pendulum, float-\non-spring, array interactions and VIV, albeit with the\nmechanical-pendulum concept dominant, make it one of\nthe most conceptually sophisticated WECs yet deployed\nanywhere in the world.\nThe 250 kW BPS machine was funded in part by the\nARENA (2016a) and was successfully deployed in\nDecember 2015, in the Southern Ocean just west of the\ntown of Port Fairy, Victoria (BPS, 2016b). It was con-\nstructed in a shipyard in Vietnam, where all final fit-out\nwas completed and transported to site by a heavy-lift ship\n(Figure 5(b)), precluding the need for a towing operation.\nIts grid connection is via a local aquaculture business.\nThe deployment process damaged the prior-laid cable to\nshore, requiring a new cable that is being installed at the\ntime of writing.\nHeaving-buoy developments.The heaving-buoy concept is\nanother natural oscillator, similar to the pendulum con-\ncepts, the OWC and the mechanical pendulum.Abuoy that\nis held entirely underwater or allowed to pierce the surface\nlike a ship provides an upward buoyancy force. According\nto Archimedes' principle, this force is equal to the weight\nof displaced seawater minus the weight of the shell of the\nbuoy and any attached objects. The buoy is tethered to the\nFigure 5.

The cable must be connected to a moving part, such\nas a hydraulic cylinder or pinion that either directly or\nindirectly transduces the reciprocating motion to rotary\nmotion to generate electricity. Furthermore, whatever sys-\ntem the cable or link connects to must possess appropriate\nstiffness, so that there is a restoring force returning the\nbuoy to equilibrium after a wave displaces it; a mechanical\nspring is the simplest example of a restoring-force system.\nThe natural frequency of the most elementary example of\na completely submerged heaving buoy can be written as\nf\nk\nm\n=\n\nwhere k is the `stiffness' of the restoring-force system and\nm is the net mass (inertia) of displaced seawater (Figure\n2(c)). The inertia m depends essentially on the size of the\nbuoy and is reduced by any pre-tension in the restoring-\nforce system. The power delivered increases with the stiff-\nness, among other factors. It is clear by comparing\nequations (2) and (3) that the heaving-buoy concept offers\nmore opportunities for design than the pure-pendulum\nconcepts. Both m and k can be designed by the engineer\nsuch that f0\nhas the target value determined by the pre-\nvailing wave climate at the location chosen, whereas for\npendulum concepts, L is pre-determined once the target\nvalue of f0\nis determined. Nonetheless, simple estimates\nshow that if the buoy is made conveniently small, say only\na few metres in diameter, the stiffness would need to be so\nlow that the power delivered by a single unit would be\nuneconomically low. Thus, the outcome is the same as\nwith the pendulum: The machines need to be large, 10\u00ad20\nm in diameter. Alternatively, if the units are to be small, a\nvery large number of units need to be installed in an array\nin order to generate economically significant amounts of\npower.\nIf the buoy is allowed to pierce the surface, the expres-\nsion for f0\nbecomes more complex since the buoy would\nhave a natural frequency due to gravity with which it\n`bobs' vertically, modified by the spring stiffness.\nFurthermore, if the spring is removed entirely from a sur-\nface-piercing buoy, its natural frequency is again given by\nthe `pendulum'relation (2), where L is now the submerged\ndraught of the buoy. Again, the same conclusion is\nobtained: The machine must be large.\nAs noted in earlier sections, devices near to or piercing\nthe surface generally benefit from the maximum in wave\naction at the surface. However, this exposes them to a\ngreater risk of damage from storms, unless their buoyancy\ncan be temporarily negated to `sink'them to the bottom for\nsafety, as with the BPS machine described in section\n`Mechanical-pendulum developments'.\nCarnegie Wave Energy (CWE) (2015), based in\nFremantle, Western Australia, began testing a heaving-\nbuoy concept in 1999 (Figure 2(c)). The company's origi-\nnal capital base was derived from the Western Australian\nmining industry, and it is listed on the Australian Securities\nExchange (ASX), enabling capital raising from share-\nmarket investors. The company's first design, denoted\nCETO1, was subjected to trials in 2006. The CETO con-\ncept is a spherical or spheroidal float, with the most recent\ndesigns constructed of steel.\nThe last-tested CWE design, CETO5 (detailed in Fievez\nand Sawyer, 2015), was funded in part by ARENA\n(CWE, 2015). It was tethered to the seabed by a cable, and\nmounted at the seabed joint was a hydraulic cylinder.\nHydraulic fluid is pressurised on the upstroke as the buoy\nrises, flowing via a one-way valve into a pipeline to shore.\nAs for the other technologies noted above employing\nvalves, energy will be lost as fluid passes through the\nvalves. The high-pressure fluid was stored in accumulator\ntanks from which it could be released to drive a conven-\ntional unidirectional hydraulic generator, which was grid\nconnected. Low-pressure fluid exhausted from the genera-\ntor was returned to the offshore cylinder via a second pipe-\nline and second one-way valve, where it still had sufficient\npressure to provide the restoring force returning the buoy\nto its lowest displacement.\nThe hydraulic cylinder with its buoy can be attached to\nand removed from a housing on the seabed, permitting\nrecovery and maintenance. The hydraulic fluid was origi-\nnally planned to be seawater, thus enabling an alternative\nuse of the high-pressure water in a desalination facility;\nhowever, the properties of seawater were not optimal for\nthe performance of the hydraulic system, so that desalina-\ntion was delivered simply by sending the electricity gener-\nated to a conventional desalination plant. The buoy is 11 m\nin diameter, and a single device had an estimated peak out-\nThree CETO5 units were built, and over 2015 progres-\nsively deployed in the ocean off Garden Island, Western\nAustralia, about 40 km south of Perth (Figure 6(a)). The\nbuoys were manufactured in a shipyard in Vietnam and\ntransported to Perth for final fit-out, from which they could\nbe towed the short distance to site. This array performed as\nplanned, including a programmed removal and re-deploy-\nment of one of the units, demonstrating that routine main-\ntenance was possible. At the end of the trial, all the units\nwere removed as planned. This trial represents one of the\nlongest-lived demonstrations of an array of WECs any-\nThe next machine in CWE's programme, CETO6\n(Figure 6(b)), has an estimated power output of 1 MW and\nthe hydraulic system and electrical machine generating\nelectricity will be inside the buoy, which like its predeces-\nsors is constructed using shipbuilding techniques. The\n60 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\non-board hydraulic generator will make the machines\nindependent of onshore facilities (apart from a grid con-\nnection) but will require the internal systems to be resilient\nsince access for maintenance will be infrequent.\nAquagen Technologies, a Melbourne-based start-up\ncompany, tested a prototype heaving buoy in 2010 from\nthe pier at Lorne, Victoria (AquaGen Technologies,\n2014). In this concept, the buoys are surface piercing,\nand the cable is connected via an underwater pulley to a\ngenerator on a platform above the water (Figure 7); in the\ntrial, the generator was on the pier. The buoy was 2.2 m\nin diameter and generated 1.5 kW. The advantage is that\nthe only moving parts in the water are the cable and pul-\nley, with no electromechanical systems or control on-\nboard. The concept relies on a large array of small devices\nto generate economically significant power. At the time\nof writing, the company was seeking investment for fur-\nther development.\nWaverider Energy, an Adelaide-based company, was\nfounded by Christian Gerlach. The company's technology\nis an array of buoys held in a floating frame 111 m long, 13\nm wide and 4 m high (McCaskill, 2014). Since there is a\nrigid frame, the buoys can be held from the top, rather than\nfrom below in other concepts. Since the frame is longer\nthan the shorter wavelengths of swell, there is a relative\nmovement between the frame and the buoys. The relative\nmovement of the buoys turns a shaft via a mechanism. A\noff Adelaide (McCaskill, 2014). A clear advantage is that\nthe joints converting reciprocating to rotary motion are not\nin the water, and thus a more complex and efficient mecha-\nnism is possible, although the mechanism is still in the\nsaline-spray environment and potentially exposed to large\nforces. The company states that a larger prototype with a\nnominal 2 MW output is being developed (Waverider\nProtean Wave Energy, a Perth-based company, such as\nCWE, benefitted from the capital accumulated from min-\ning in Western Australia. It is listed on the ASX. The\nProtean concept was invented by Sean Moore in 2004\n(Griffith, 2015). The buoy, which appears to be roughly\n1.5 m in diameter (Figure 8), is surface piercing and con-\nnected to a base on the seabed by multiple cables, which\nthe company states offer the potential to extract power\nfrom >1 degree of freedom of motion (Proactive Investors,\n2016). The cables turn pulleys inside the float which drive\na pneumatic compressor. A counterweight is located in\nbetween the float and base; presumably, this provides a\ngravitational restoring force in addition to, or alternatively\nFigure 6.

Since one-way\nvalves are likely to be employed in the pneumatics, there is\nthe potential for energy loss, just as with other technolo-\ngies noted above using valves.\nA single machine was trialled from a pier in Perth in\n2015; analogously to the hydraulic-liquid transmission of\nthe much larger CWS CETO5 system, the compressed air\nwas piped onshore to turn a pneumatic generator. Similarly\nto the AquaGen design, the Protean design is intended to be\ninstalled in arrays, to overcome the issue of the very low\u00ad\npower output of an individual small machine. Furthermore,\nthe small size affords economies of scale in manufactur-\ning, and the presence of multiple units would allow\nredundancies permitting effective maintenance. An array\nof 30 machines is under development at Bunbury, Western\nPitching developments.To resonate a mechanical system\nrequires its natural frequency to be matched, as described\nabove. More generally, matching the natural frequency is\njust a matching of the temporal frequency; there is also the\nspatial frequency. Matching the spatial frequency requires\nthe length of a rigid part of the machine to be a quarter of\nthe wavelength, . The description of the resonators above\nimplicitly assumes that their length is much smaller than ,\nso that spatial-frequency matching is not required. How-\never, a machine of sufficient length could resonate by\nmatching its size to the wavelength as well as its natural\nfrequency to the wave frequency. This category of `pitch-\ning devices' (Falc\u00e3o, 2010) operates at the surface where\nwave action is maximal. There are usually joints between\nrigid segments, and oscillation of the joints is converted\ninto useful power by a variety of mechanisms. A pitching\nconcept is being developed by Perpetuwave Power (2016;\nNon-resonating developments.Bombora Wave Power\n(BWP, 2016a), a Perth-based start-up company, was\nfounded in 2011 by Shawn and Glen Ryan. Their concept,\nunlike all other Australian WEC devices trialled to date,\ndoes not rely on resonance. The underwater part of the\nmachine sits on the seabed and is made of a flexible mem-\nbrane divided into a number of cells (Figure 10). The cells\nare inflated with compressed air, but the system is designed\nto remain negatively buoyant and sit on the seabed. As\nwave crests pass over, the resulting high pressure forces air\nfrom cells through one-way valves into a plenum chamber,\nfrom which the compressed air drives a conventional uni-\ndirectional generator. Air exhausted from the generator\ninto a second plenum chamber is then sucked back into the\ncells under the wave trough. As with the other concepts\nrequiring one-way valves, there will be energy losses as air\nflows through the valves.\nIt is intended that the machine be composed of a large\nnumber of cells arranged in a row. Similarly to the `Wave\nMill'concept (section `Liquid-pendulum (oscillating water\ncolumn) developments'), once the row of cells is longer\nthan a wavelength, there will always be air simultaneously\npushed out of some cells while being sucked into other\ncells. This offers the advantage of a generator that not only\nturns in the same direction but turns with a constant speed,\nFigure 8.

In initial trials, the generator was onshore, but in\nfuture designs, the generator is intended to be underwater,\nwith only a power cable connecting it to shore.\nAs noted earlier, wave motion and thus the pressure\nimparted by passing waves decrease with depth. In deep\nwater, the pressure due to wave motion decreases expo-\nnentially with depth, which would render a bottom-\nmounted machine that does not reach the surface useless.\nHowever, as noted in section `Reasons for the diversity\nof WEC designs', in shallow water (such that the depth\nis <1/20 of the wavelength), the pressure fluctuations\nare virtually unchanged with depth (Gill, 1982). Thus,\nthe BWP device should function best in shallow water,\nwith ocean swell having wavelengths of over 100 m,\nwhich as noted in section `Reasons for the diversity of\nWEC designs' does occur on the Southern Ocean and\nsouthern Indian Ocean coasts of Australia (Behrens\nThe BWP device is thus a form of artificial reef, and its\nsimplicity implies that it could be useful for coastal protec-\ntion that assists in defraying its capital cost by profits from\nthe sale of electricity, as noted by Falc\u00e3o (2010) and\nManasseh et al. (2017) and as discussed further in section\n`Discussion and conclusion'.\nThe absence of resonance means that the machine will\nnot be able to draw in wave power over a region larger than\nits physical size, as noted in section `Reasons for the diver-\nsity of WEC designs'. Another way to express the absence\nof resonance is to note that the displacement of the cells\nwill be the same as that of the water above them: There can\nbe no amplification. Nonetheless, there is nothing inherent\nin the concept preventing it from being redeveloped into a\nresonator in the future. A number of parameters are avail-\nable, such as the stiffness provided by the compressed air\nand the volume of air in accumulators, which may permit\ntuning of a future version.\nAustralian tidal energy\nResources\nRegions of high tidal amplitude or strong tidal currents are\nmost feasible for tidal-energy extraction. In the case of\nregions with large tidal amplitude, it is the potential energy\nthat is exploited via structures such as tidal barrages. In\nregions of strong tidal currents, it is the kinetic energy that\nis exploited via free-stream turbines (Behrens et al., 2012a).\nHigh tidal amplitudes occur in locations where the tide is\nin resonance, which typically occurs when the natural\noscillation frequency of a semi-enclosed body of water\ncoincides with one of the astronomical forcing frequencies\n(Behrens et al., 2012a). Although a detailed assessment of\nAustralia's tidal energy resource has not been undertaken\nto date, Behrens et al. (2012a) note regions of greatest tidal\nheight to be the north-west shelf, Broad Sound in\nQueensland and the northern coast of Tasmania. Regions\nwhere tidal currents are large include, for example, the\neastern and western sides of Bass Strait, Torres Strait in\nnorthern Queensland and Kings Sound on the north-west\nshelf. This assessment was based on a coarse-resolution\ntidal model. Given the complexity of tidal flows (e.g.\naround headlands and in constricted passages), the esti-\nmates provided by Behrens et al. (2012a) are likely to have\nunderestimated the available resource, and so further\nhigh-resolution assessment of Australia's tidal resource\nis required.\nTechnologies\nIn contrast to the complex diversity of fundamental con-\ncepts observable in wave energy, tidal-energy technologies\nare more readily understood. Unlike the reciprocating\nflows of wave energy noted in section `Reasons for the\ndiversity of WEC designs', tidal flows, while they do\nreverse, are unidirectional for 6 hours. This allows conven-\ntional turbines to be used if the flow speed is high enough;\nit is only necessary to pivot the turbine through on the\nchange from ebb to flow tides and back. Since most coasts\ndo not enjoy tidal flows fast enough to turn a turbine of\neconomic scale, variations in technologies centre on vari-\nous strategies to extract power from low-speed flows.\nThese are detailed in a companion article (Manasseh et al.,\n2017); the most common is the ducted turbine, which\nseeks to increase the speed passing through the turbine\nwith a converging duct. In locations where speeds are nat-\nurally high enough, a free-bladed turbine is feasible.\nManasseh et al. (2017) also note that the tidal barrage con-\ncept can capture all the tidal energy in a bay or inlet, by\nsimply constructing a barrier.\nAtlantis Resources (AR, 2016) is a tidal-power devel-\noper originally founded in Brisbane. In 2002, AR tested its\nfirst tidal-power technology at San Remo, Victoria. The\nmachine, called the `Aquanator', was a caterpillar-track-\nlike device with multiple blades able to operate irrespec-\ntive of the flow direction (Figure 11). It was a unique\nsolution to the low-speed flow problem. It was grid-con-\nbetween San Remo and Phillip Island is the eastern of two\nentrances to Westernport Bay and has significant tidal\nflows. The western entrance provides access for commer-\ncial shipping to the port of Hastings, but the eastern\nentrance does not have such traffic.\nThe company established operations in Singapore in\n2006 `attracted by high quality R&D capabilities, as well\nas the integrity of the intellectual property protection laws'\nmachine, replaced the `Aquanator' machine at San Remo.\nThe San Remo site was decommissioned in 2015. Since\nthen, the company has developed more conventional\nducted turbines and free-bladed turbines and has begun\nplanning projects in Scotland, Canada and China. Its latest\nturbines are developed in collaboration with US multina-\ntional engineering firm Lockheed-Martin.\nThe company listed on London stock exchange in 2014,\nwhile retaining its headquarters in Singapore (Fiakas,\n2016). The company has benefitted from significant finan-\ncial support from the UK government. The commercial\n400 MW MeyGen site at the northern tip of Scotland, the\nworld's largest tidal stream project, is nearing completion\n(MeyGen Limited, 2016). This site has tidal flows of mak-\ning the conventional AR turbines most suitable for its\nElemental Energy Technologies (EET) is a Sydney-\nbased developer of tidal turbines, founded in 2007 by\nMichael Urch. It tested its ducted turbine, the `Sea Urchin'\nmachine was rated at 2 kW. Further tests occurred in\nIndia, at the Defence Research and Development\nOrganisation. The device was manufactured under licence\nfrom EET by Indian company Kirloskar Integrated\nTechnologies Limited in Pune, India. In 2012, Tenax\nEnergy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to\ndevelop a 2 MW tidal-power plant in the Clarence Strait\nbetween Darwin and Melville Island that would use EET\nturbines. At the time of writing, the project has not yet\nprogressed. Meanwhile, EET was absorbed by another\ncompany, Mako Turbines (2015), which is developing\nanother turbine, the `Mako'; this being a free-bladed tur-\nbine. Many more Australian tidal-power trials have taken\nplace; these are summarised in Table 1.\nOther marine renewables\nOcean-current power, as available from large-scale ocean-\nographic flows such as the major western boundary cur-\nrents of the World's oceans, is described in Manasseh et al.\n(2017). The most significant such resource for Australia is\nthe EAC, which flows along the coast of Queensland and\nNew South Wales. Griffin and Hemer (2010) note the EAC\nflows as a fast narrow jet along the upper continental slope\nbetween Fraser Island and northern NSW, at speeds in\ntour. Beyond this stretch of coast, the EAC is an unstable\nmeandering flow best characterised as a series of swirling\neddies. Interest in the EAC as a source of energy is long-\nstanding, with interest extending back to at least the early\n(2010) note the low power density of these flows, thus\nrequiring very large\u00addiameter devices to extract sufficient\npower to make it a viable prospect. The total width of the\nfast region of current is about 20 km, and thus, resource\navailability is likely heavily constrained relative to\nAustralia's needs (Griffin and Hemer, 2010).\nOTEC is described in Manasseh et al. (2017). It requires\na surface water temperature of at least 20\u00b0C, which is\nfound only in the tropics. Since a pipeline to depths\napproaching 1000 m is also required, OTEC is most viable\nwhere continental shelves are narrow or on isolated islands.\nSuch locations are found on the coast of far north\nQueensland; Behrens et al. (2012a) noted potential sites\nCairns. Locations such distances offshore introduce eco-\nnomic disincentives. There has been a suggestion of OTEC\ndevelopment in this region (Ridd, 2005), but no developer\nhas yet come forward.\nSalinity gradient energy conversion (SGEC) is detailed\nby Kempener and Neumann (2014). In very simplistic\nterms, it could be described as the reverse of desalination.\nIn desalination, energy is supplied to turn saline water into\nfreshwater. The reverse process releases energy as fresh-\nwater is allowed to dilute saline water. Effectively, this\nenergy was `stored' in the freshwater when the sun's heat\nevaporated it to form rain. In the southern part ofAustralia,\nthere is sometimes a shortage of large quantities of fresh-\nwater, which has led to the construction of desalination\nplants servicing major cities. Thus, SGEC may be more\nuseful in the tropical North, where large volumes of fresh-\nwater flow out to sea during the wet season. Behrens et al.\n(2012a) also propose a combination of desalination and\nSGEC as a form of energy storage.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nAustralia is endowed with every form of marine renewa-\nble energy resource: Wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-\ncurrent energy, ocean-thermal energy and salinity-gradient\nenergy are available. Due to its geographical location, the\ncontinent has highly energetic wave resources in the south\nand warm tropical seas suitable for OTEC in the north. A\nhuge region with high tidal range is present in the north-\nwest, and a major western boundary current runs along the\neast coast. The United States is the only other national\njurisdiction possessing all classes of marine renewable\nenergy resource.\nThe majority of the population is concentrated in cities\non the coast, so that electricity infrastructure is distributed\ncoastally. However, there are great distances between\npopulation centres, and the port facilities and workforce\nable to construct, install, operate and maintain maritime\nFigure 11. The Atlantis Resources 100 kW turbine tested in\nSource: Image courtesy of Atlantis Resources Ltd.\n64 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)\ntechnologies are not necessarily within easy reach of\nresource locations. As one example, Australia's most ener-\ngetic wave resources lie off the coast of SW Tasmania, a\nwilderness area with almost no population centres. In\nanother example, the high tidal ranges of NW Western\nAustralia occur over a vast coastline that is virtually\nunpopulated, and while the population that is there does\nneed energy, the absolute amount of energy needed locally\nis very small. The remote nature of north-west Australia\nhas not been an issue for major petrochemical and mining\ndevelopments which have occurred in the same region.\nHowever, those developments service enormous export\nmarkets, not domestic markets, and are pursued by very\nlarge, well-established corporations that are able to con-\nstruct entire towns to service their developments.\nWe note that the protection of the coast from waves is\nof on-going relevance (Abanades et al., 2015), particularly\nin the context of other alterations that might occur due to\nclimate change (Manasseh et al., 2017). The use of WEC\narrays for coastal protection, up to now constructed only in\nEurope in the form of breakwaters that generate power\nconsidered in Australia. This has been proposed for the\nBombora device (Ryan et al., 2015). Unlike solid sea\nwalls, WEC arrays offer the ability of removing power\nfrom waves without completely eliminating them.\nMoreover, the power removed could be altered to suit the\ncircumstances of the day: `tuneable' coastal protection.\nThis may permit the reduction of some extremes without\nnecessarily inducing the environmental impacts of impen-\netrable infrastructure. Furthermore, it has already been\nnoted that significant reductions in the levelised cost of\nelectricity would occur if the imperative to protect the\ncoast provides a share of the cost of constructing the infra-\nstructure (Falc\u00e3o, 2010). Correspondingly, the sale of elec-\ntricity could offset the cost of servicing debt needed to\nconstruct coastal-protection infrastructure.\nThe 2014 Oceanlinx incident illustrates some of the\nissues facing WEC technology, some universal, some spe-\ncific to Australia. The incident was nothing to do with the\ntechnological concept; as noted, OWCs have been operat-\ning in the ocean for over 130 years and generating electric-\nity for over 60 years. A universal issue is the small scale of\nfirms developing concepts, which as noted in section\n`Reasons for the diversity of WEC designs' is possible due\nto the ease of developing unique IP, itself a fundamental\nfeature of the physics of waves and of engineering.\nHowever, deploying large devices in an ocean environ-\nment that is, by definition, highly energetic, is usually the\npreserve of large companies such as those in the petro-\nchemicals industry. Such large companies have the capital\nand resources to undertake risky operations over long time\nframes, and to recover from setbacks; small firms do not.\nThe incident itself was due to a combination of the need\nfor a large device, in order to resonate at ocean wave\nfrequencies that are particularly low on the southern\nAustralian coast, and the long distances between port facil-\nitiesanddeploymentsitestypicalofAustralia.Furthermore,\nthe small size of the company, itself a feature of the ease\nwith which IP can be created in wave power, may have\nlimited its deployment options.\nThe example of AR is also instructive. Once the com-\npany had successfully tested its technology in Australia, it\nmoved to Singapore and then listed in London. It has used\nthe Australian site to build expertise in tidal technology\ntesting and development but ceased operations in Australia\nonce appropriate business prospects emerged. It now con-\ntracts out prime engineering design to a major multina-\ntional engineering concern. It supplies equipment under\ntender to government-supported power generation initia-\ntives. The company's base is geographically closer to both\ntidal sites on both sides of the NorthAtlantic and to sources\nof capital to finance further operations. In practical terms,\nit has ceased to be an Australian developer.\nIt is important to understand the principles underpin-\nning the Australian developments and understand these\nprinciples in their geographical context. We have seen that\ndetails such as the depth of the water and the frequency\nand wavelength of the prevailing ocean swell may make\nsome wave-power technologies best for some locations,\nwhile nominally competing technologies are best for other\nlocations. If the need to protect the coast is included, still\nother wave-power technologies operating best in shallow\nwater may be more viable. Similarly, some tidal technolo-\ngies may be viable in Australia's tropical North West,\nwhere the great width of the continental shelf assists the\ncreation of high tides, while reducing the wave resource.\nWhere wave and tidal resources may be less viable, ocean-\ncurrent power may provide a marine renewable energy\noption such as along the coasts of south-eastern Queensland\nand northern New South Wales. OTEC may be a viable\noption in the tropics.\nIn summary, Australia is an excellent testing ground for\nall classes of marine renewable energy technologies. As\nAustralia, along with all other nations, seeks to decarbon-\nise its energy supplies, further development of its immense\nmarine renewable energy resources will occur. As noted in\nsection `Introduction', examples of levelised costs of elec-\ntricity for wave, tidal and OTEC resources are given in\nTable 5 (section `Engineering and economic efficiencies')\nof a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). These\nindicated that estimates of marine-renewable-energy lev-\nelised costs of electricity in the year 2030 were still higher\nthan present-day wind costs. Moreover, the fairly small\nnational population means that technology-development\ncompanies will struggle to grow to a viable size if they\nfocus solely on meeting local electricity demand. Coastal\nprotection is one aspect where wave-power technologies\nin particular could rapidly reach economic viability, due to\nthe sharing of infrastructure costs, and a nation whose\ndevelopers can master tuneable coastal protection may be\nable to export expertise.\nA paradigm for large growth may be export of marine\nrenewable energy. In 1974, Salter suggested that WECs\nmay be used to generate and store hydrogen. Whether or\nnot that particular suggestion is viable, export of fossil\nfuels from Australia is presently a huge industry with its\ninfrastructure already focused on maritime export. James\n(2011) suggested export of electricity by undersea trans-\nmission; although such infrastructure does not exist, port\nand shipping infrastructure does exist. Thus, research into\nways of storing and exporting marine renewable energy is\nindicated.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial\nsupport for the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle: R.M. is grateful for the support of the Australian\nRenewable Energy Agency (ARENA), via grant ERP A00575.\nK.L.M. and M.A.H. are grateful to ARENA via grant ERP\nA00521.
