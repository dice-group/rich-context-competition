However, many children miss out on such schooling opportunities, even more so in conflict-\nprone societies. Considering that children in conflict-affected and low-income countries account\nfor 42% of those out of school globally, it is crucial to ensure equal educational opportunities and\nattainment for those children who are disproportionately affected by armed conflicts (UNESCO\n2011). For this study, it is important to recognise that the relationship between education and vio-\nlent conflict is highly complex and that education systems can be both `victim'and `perpetrator'of\nwar and conflict (Novelli & Lopes Cardozo, 2008: 478), a contention that was articulated through\nBush and Saltarelli's (2000) influential thinking in The Two Faces of Education in Ethnic Conflict.\nSri Lanka is one of many low-income countries stricken by intra-state warfare, which has\nincreased in prevalence throughout the second half of the 20th century (Novelli & Lopes Cardozo,\n2008). This paper builds on former studies on the role of education in fostering peace in Sri Lanka\nconcern with research on the implementation, perceptions and experience of peace education of\nethno-religious minorities in the north of the country. More specifically, the aim of this paper is to\nexplore the possibilities and challenges for ethno-religious reconciliation through secondary school\neducation in post-war Sri Lanka, with a specific focus on the Muslim and Tamil communities in the\nnorthern city of Jaffna. In doing so, this paper aims to fill a gap in the academic literature, specifi-\ncally on the plight of the `forgotten minority' of northern Muslims and their struggle for redistribu-\ntion, recognition, representation of social development within a framework of post-war reconciliation\nand rebuilding in Sri Lanka, while focusing primarily on the educational sphere. Building on the\nwork of Dale (2005, see also Lopes Cardozo and Hoeks, 2014), we pursue a multi-disciplinary\nmethodology and multi-scalar analysis, by broadening the debate on education for peace towards\npolitical, cultural and social contexts, acknowledging the inter-connected relationship between the\nindividual, school, community and society. Our main analytical framework is inspired by the work\non social justice of Fraser (1995, 2005), yet further developed to study the role of social sectors in\nsustainable peacebuilding (Novelli, Lopes Cardozo and Smith, 2015).\nThe argumentation of this paper is primarily informed by research findings from a micro-scale\nalmost four years since the culmination of the ethnic civil war in May 2009. This paper is based on\nan ethnographic study of predominantly two groups, the northern Sri Lankan Tamils (religiously\nHindu and Catholic) and the Sri Lankan Moors (religiously Islamic), both of which communities\nhave been disproportionately affected by war and displacement. The concepts of ethnicity and\nreligion, and the identity which is attached to these notions, are central to this paper. Identity as a\nconcept is complex consisting of myriad factors including ethnicity, religion, nationality, geogra-\nphy, class, etc., yet through freedom of choice, or lack of, a singular identity is commonly attrib-\nuted to individuals, whole groups or communities (consisting mostly of ethnicity or religion) (Sen,\n2006). The fundamental role of religion in the identity formation of Sri Lankan Muslims is the\nsubject of much misunderstanding with ethnic Tamils, as acknowledged within academic literature\ntify themselves religiously, rather than to align themselves ethnically, continues to be a source of\nconflict between Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic groups. Ethnographic research was conducted in three\nneighbouring state secondary schools situated less than a square mile apart within the city of Jaffna:\n78 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\na Muslim school, a Tamil-Catholic school and a proportionately Tamil-Hindu school which is con-\nsidered non-denominational.\nDue to the ethnographic nature of research, a mixed-methods approach to data collection was\nthe most suitable, which included a range of qualitative techniques such as interviews, focus\ngroups and participant observation, and quantitative techniques, including student questionnaires.\nSemi-structured interviews were the most appropriate and primary method of attaining in-depth\nand reliable information. In total, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted, of which 15\nwere conducted with either practitioners of education such as principals, teachers and non-gov-\nernmental organisation (NGO) staff, and participants in education such as secondary school stu-\ndents. There was a total of 40 respondents from these semi-structured interviews, of which other\nparticipants included community activists, religious leaders, NGO staff, parents and academics.\nFurthermore, focus groups were conducted with students and teachers separately on different\noccasions. In terms of quantitative fieldwork, 34 questionnaires were distributed and completed\nby schoolchildren born between 1994 and 1997 attending the three secondary schools, predomi-\nnantly studying at Advanced Level and Ordinary Level.\nThis article will now be divided into a number of sections, the first of which will provide a brief\noverview of the post-war socio-political context of Sri Lanka, focusing on the plight of the Muslim\nminority, the context of post-war secondary school education and the role of formal peace educa-\ntion in Sri Lanka. Second, we share the theoretical foundations on which this paper is based. In the\nfollowing sections the potential of education for sustainable peacebuilding is analysed through\nreflecting on the data collected for this study. In the first data section, we provide analysis of the\n(re)production of structural economic, social and political injustices in/through education in the\nspecific context of Jaffna. Following a 4Rs theoretical framework (discussed below), we most\ndirectly engage with the analytical dimensions of redistribution, recognition and representation,\nand how these are played out within educational discourses and practices. In the following two data\nsections, we continue to engage with these three dimensions, but turn our attention to the fourth R\nthat is reconciliation. Applying a multi-scalar approach, we first illustrate how respondents per-\nceived that formal forms of peace education through secondary schooling hardly address issues of\nreconciliation. In the final data section, we demonstrate how non-formal educational community\ninitiatives do seem to carry the potential for reconciliation, yet lack a strategy to address the struc-\ntural inequalities and root causes of conflict. To conclude, we provide some suggestions for peace\neducation policy, practice and future research.\nThe Research Context\nDemographically, Sri Lanka is ethnically diverse consisting of four major groups: firstly, Sinhalese\n(74.9%), residing mostly in the south; secondly, Sri Lankan Tamil (11.2%) inhabiting mostly in the\nnorth; thirdly, Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka, known as Hill Country Tamils or Up-Country Tamils,\nalso residing in Colombo (4.2%); and lastly, Sri Lankan Moors, commonly referred to as Muslims,\nwho reside country-wide (9.2%) (Department of Census and Statistics Sri Lanka, 2012). We recog-\nnise that due to people's hybrid and often complex identities, these lines are in reality often more\nporous than represented in census data. One example is that the country is religiously heterogene-\nous, with the Sinhalese predominantly (but not exclusively) Buddhist, with Tamils predominantly\nHindu, and with Christianity being represented within both Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups. Sri\nLanka endured ethnic conflict and civil war between the years of 1983 and 2009, which has had a\nmajor impact upon the socio-economic development of the country and exacerbated endemic polit-\nical, economic and educational inequalities (Lopes Cardozo 2008: 19).\nThe 26-year civil war has often been portrayed as a power struggle of competing ethno-\nnationalisms between the central Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 79\nEelam (LTTE) \u00ad commonly known in Western mainstream media as the `Tamil Tigers' \u00ad a sepa-\nratist rebel insurgency with the objective of securing independence for a Tamil homeland in the\nnorthern and eastern parts of the country (Lopes Cardozo & Hoeks, 2014). Yet, the role of the\nMuslim minority continues to be largely forgotten and excluded from academic and public dis-\ncourse in a post-war landscape characterised by militarisation and a culture of fear. The civil war\ncame to a brutal conclusion in May 2009 when government forces crushed the LTTE's near\n30-year battle for independence, amid large civilian casualties and allegations of war crimes\nperpetrated by both sides, for which those responsible are yet to face justice. Approximately\n(United Nations, 2012). Now in the post-war period, the north, and specifically the Jaffna\nPeninsula, continues to endure militarisation and enforced disappearances according to respond-\nents. However, following the unexpected election victory of President Sirisena in January 2015\non rhetoric of anti-corruption and reconciliation between an increasingly ethically Sinhalese\ncontrolled state with Muslim and Tamil minorities, there is much hope of a new post-war settle-\nment departing from the divisive and authoritarian 10-year presidency of his predecessor\nIn the northern city of Jaffna, the primary research location where data for this study was gath-\nered, the everyday lives of Tamils and Tamil-speaking Muslims are defined by ethno-religious\nsegregation and violence. The northern Muslims are an ethno-religious group which has received\nlimited attention from academics and policymakers. Although research has been conducted on\nMuslim internally displaced peoples (IDPs) in the Puttalam district (Brun, 2009; McGilvray and\nRaheem, 2007), academic literature regarding the Muslim community in Jaffna is rare (Thiranagama\n2008, 2011). There is an absence of literature specifically regarding the role, position and relation-\nship of Muslims in post-war ethnic reconciliation and secondary school education.\nIt is in this post-war context that education in Sri Lanka plays a crucial role in creating a culture of\npeace and healing the wounds of war, and it is important to investigate what role education can play in\nsuch post-war reconciliation and peacebuilding that is inclusive and socially just. Education has been\na long-standing priority of the government of Sri Lanka since independence in 1948 (Perera, 2004: 1),\nyet it has been highly politicised and a source of much conflict, particularly between Sinhalese and\nTamil ethnic groups. There have been many challenges confronting the Sri Lankan education system\nwhich has been widely regarded as failing in terms of providing equal opportunities.\nThe segregated secondary school education system reflects an ethnically divided society which\nwas established during British colonialism and has since deepened ethnic division (Davies, 2011).\nThe secondary school system is divided into `language' streams, that is, the `mother tongue' of\nSinhala or Tamil, but there are also religiously segregated schools, such as Muslim-only schools,\ndistribution of educational resources, rigidity of the curriculum and segregation of the school struc-\nture as problematic in delivering good quality education, with northern areas principally the scene\nof educational deprivation. This ethnic segregation and divide through schooling, and the promotion\nof linguistic nationalism, has exacerbated misrecognition and unequal opportunities for Sri Lanka's\nmulti-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious population, and calls for a more inclusive form of\neducation addressing these immediate concerns in a post-war context (Lopes Cardozo, 2008).\nThe need to primarily address ethnic conflict and facilitate reconciliation between Tamil and\nSinhalese groups led to the introduction of official peace education in secondary schools in 1991.\nBilingual teaching and learning was introduced in the 1997 general education reforms, which spec-\nified pupils should learn both Sinhala and Tamil languages. Within this reform a new emphasis was\nplaced upon teacher training to educate in terms of human and gender rights, connected values and\nnotions of democracy (Lopes Cardozo, 2008; Davies 2011). To facilitate this process, a Ministry\n80 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nfor National Languages and Social Integration has been created, the first of its kind in the world\n(Davies, 2011). The formulation of the Social Cohesion and Peace Education umbrella programme\nin 2008 by the Ministry of Education (MoE) was viewed largely as a positive advancement for\npeace education in Sri Lanka. This placed new emphasis upon teaching the values of democracy\nand citizenship and sought to instil the virtues of peace, equality and respect among its participants,\nthe students, and create a desired model Sri Lankan citizen. The policy identifies seven key strate-\ngic areas through which social cohesion, a greater peace between ethno-religious groups, can be\ndeveloped. The strategic areas are the following: curriculum; teacher education; second national\nlanguage;wholeschoolculture;integratedschools;co-curricularactivities;andresearch(Aturupane\nand Wikramanayake, 2011: 5). For the purposes of this paper we will refer to `formal peace educa-\ntion' which includes these strategic areas and its objective of creating greater social cohesion\nwithin Sri Lankan society. 'Formal peace education' will therefore be used inter-changeably with\nthe term `social cohesion'. Formal peace education is (meant to be) integrated into every subject\nwithin the secondary school curriculum, particularly civic education, history, language and the\nsocial studies curricula, ensuring that peace education is all-encompassing, rather than to be taught\nthrough only one subject. Furthermore, the policy discourse has a focus on increasing inter-cultural\nunderstanding and tolerance through inter-ethnic and inter-religious integrated schooling, yet\nTheoretical Foundations\nOur paper employs a meta-theoretical epistemological approach incorporating Dale's work on the\npolitics of education, which entails a broader critique of mainstream educational research (Dale,\neducation systems are embedded and inherent within local, regional, national and global processes\nof politics, history, culture and economy. Through a multi-scalar, historical and interdisciplinary\ning discourse of the politics of education. This enables us to view education inherently as a political\nprocess in how it is conceived, formulated, implemented, experienced and perceived from the\nmacro-level to micro-level. This critical theoretical approach allows us to address questions that\nmove beyond the education sector and affords a broadened framing of research problems towards\ncultural, political and economic inequalities and root causes of conflict. Furthermore, we build on\nthe work of Novelli and Smith (2011) on the relationship between the education system and the\ncore issues of conflict. In doing so, our analysis endeavours to capture the potential of education\nfor peacebuilding processes, by paying significant attention to religious, social, ethnic, class and\ngeographical dynamics and their relationship in enabling or undermining peacebuilding activities\nThe analytical framework we employ in this paper is inspired by the work on social justice of\nFraser (1995, 2005) on the `three Rs of redistribution, recognition and representation', and its fur-\nther application to studying the role of social sectors in sustainable peacebuilding by adding the\nfourth analytical dimension of reconciliation (Novelli, Lopes Cardozo and Smith, 2015). This `4R'\nframework, as developed by (Novelli, Lopes Cardozo and Smith, 2015), argues that the key post-\nconflict transformations necessary to produce sustainable peace \u00ad or positive peace, as Galtung\n(1969) refers to it \u00ad involve redistribution, recognition and representation, to bring about greater\nsocial justice as suggested by the work of Fraser (2005), together with post-conflict issues of rec-\nonciliation. As argued above, we position education's potential transformative role as inherently\nconnected to and embedded within processes of social justice and societal transformation. Fraser,\nfrom a critical feminist perspective, asserts that a socially just society would entail `participation\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 81\non par with others, as full partners in social interaction' (Fraser, 2005: 73). Hence, economic solu-\ntions of redistribution of resources and opportunities alone will not suffice, but need to be com-\nbined with socio-cultural remedies for better recognition and political representation. In addition,\nwe argue that for conflict-affected and post-conflict contexts, there is a need for processes of rec-\nonciliation, so that historic and present tensions, grievances and injustices are dealt with to build a\nmore sustainable peaceful society.\nWhile these four Rs are separated for analytical purposes, in reality these are very much inter-\nlinked in either reinforcing or conflicting ways. For example, as recognition of formerly excluded\nethnic languages in education, combined with a redistribution of resources to train teachers and\ndevelop material to enhance this process, could potentially lead to better representation of ethnic\nminority graduates in decision-making positions (at school governance level, or later on in political\npositions), this opening up of a diversity of languages might (depending on the context) potentially\nhinder processes of reconciliation as in reality some minority languages might be included as a lan-\nguage of instruction, while others might not make it, creating resentment among various groups of\nstudents. In that sense, we might see this arena where various (powerful and less powerful, informed\nand less-informed) actors operate as a `politics of redistribution-recognition-representation-reconcil-\niation', in which processes related to the four Rs are played out and understood in relation to the\nbroader peacebuilding goals, and where the rules of the game set limits on what is possible and desir-\nable in society. This term `politics of the 4 Rs' is loosely inspired by Dale's work on the politics of\neducation (2005) and brings together our theoretical foundations set out at the start of this section.\nReproduction of structural socio-cultural, political and economic\ninjustices through education\nImportantly, in the discussion that follows we have separated the three dimensions of social justice\n(recognition, representation and redistribution) for analytical reasons, yet we emphasise the inter-\nconnected nature of these dimensions. The first dimension of Fraser's framework to be explored is\nrecognition, mostly connected to socio-cultural (in-)justices. There are significant historical griev-\nances originating from the eviction and subsequent displacement of the 10,000-strong Muslim\npopulation from Jaffna by the LTTE on 30 October 1990; an event which is increasingly perceived\nas a central source of continuing conflict between Muslim and Tamil, perpetuating segregation and\nthe entrenchment of singular ethno-religious identities. Muslim displacement is often judged to\nhave been a form of ethnic cleansing completing a Tamil homogenisation of the north of Sri Lanka\n(Thiranagama, 2007). Upon eviction, the Muslim community were forced to congregate at the\nMuslim secondary school in the city, the site of which has consequently developed a historical\nimportance for the Jaffna Muslim community. Since the end of the war in 2009, only 600 Muslim\nfamilies living in the IDP camps of Puttalam District have permanently resettled in Jaffna due to a\nseries of inter-related problems regarding housing, political representation and educational facili-\nties. Those who have resettled in Jaffna have experienced a relationship of mistrust with the Tamil\npeople, as is illustrated by a quote from a Muslim teacher: `Tamils' relationship with Muslims is\none of bitterness, forged in the past ... the seal of hatred is still here. The war is over, yet the con-\nflict still remains'. The lives of young Muslims continue to be influenced through their parents'\nrecollections of displacement, maintaining a cycle of ethno-religious prejudice from one genera-\ntion to the next. Of those Muslim students interviewed, 13 out of 18 stated they currently feel dis-\ncriminated against by Tamils. Nevertheless, evidence discovered through this research suggests\nthere are generational differences in attitudes and prejudices between the younger generation of\nschool leaving age and middle-aged adults, with all 34 students surveyed stating that they had close\nfriends of other religions and ethnicities.\n82 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nThe segregation between Tamils and Muslims is replicated in secondary school education in the\nresearch area. Schools are segregated on the basis of religion which is identified as a `negative face\nof education' (Bush and Saltarelli, 2000), potentially exacerbating conflict between groups.\nReligious customs and practices of minority groups are not accommodated at the Muslim school\nand the Tamil-Catholic school. The Muslim school excludes schoolchildren on the basis of ethno-\nreligious identity and is almost ethno-religiously homogeneous with 98.4% of the student popula-\ntion being Muslim. Meanwhile, the Tamil-Catholic school is ethnically segregated, pursuing a\npolicy of only admitting non-Muslim Tamil students despite the school's location being only 50\nmetres from the Muslim residential area. Student enrolment at the Tamil-Catholic school stands\ncurrently at 84.7% Catholic, 15.3% Hindu and no Muslim students. The Tamil-Hindu school is a\nnon-denominational school which is widely viewed as a `school of inclusion' and does not dis-\ncriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion or caste, which is seen as a source of pride within the\ncommunity. For the purposes of this paper and for ease of reference this school will hereafter be\nreferred to as the `Tamil-Hindu school'. However, the student population is predominantly Hindu\nstudent population. A Muslim student attending the Tamil-Hindu school claimed that the school\ndoes very well to accommodate Muslim religious practices, such as allowing students to leave\nclass at 12pm on Fridays to attend the mosque.\nAlmost half of teachers interviewed explicitly defended the current segregated structures\nbetween local secondary schools and suggested this should be maintained. A teacher justified the\ncurrent arrangements as they are seen to preserve Islamic culture and safeguard the existence of\nIslamic schools, which as a minority religion in Sri Lanka are already perceived to be under\nthreat. The majority of student respondents (27 out of 34) were against the current secondary\nschool structure enforcing religious segregation, with a number of them suggesting that a lack of\ninter-religious schooling leads to communities moving further apart, thus deepening rifts between\nthem. As illustrated earlier, there is an observable difference between the majority of views of\nolder and younger generations.\nSecond, the analytical dimension of representation, connected to the political sphere, advocates\nthe importance of addressing unequal power relations at a multitude of social, ethnic and political\nlevels to ensure groups are equally represented. Our analysis discovered an identity-based conflict\nregarding an absence of political representation of the Muslim minority leading to claims that\nJaffna Muslims are a `forgotten community'(teacher at the Muslim school). For many respondents,\nthe social development of the Muslim community is thwarted; first, by a political landscape at the\nmunicipal and provincial level of corruption and demagoguery, with some prominent local politi-\ncians accused of `tearing the Muslim and Tamil communities apart' (Tamil-Catholic religious\nleader); second, the divided internal politics of the Muslim community is hindering their ability to\nspeak with a united voice; and third, the absence of educated leaders and an illiterate population is\nexacerbating problems in terms of meeting the community's needs, for example in administrative\nmatters such as completing official government forms for housing applications.\nSecondary schools have also been the venue for struggles for political power. This became spe-\ncifically clear within the Muslim school, where religious-based conflict was reported between\nMuslim actors, such as the mosque and Muslim teachers, and Tamil actors, notably individuals\nwithin the northern province's Provincial Department of Education and Tamil individuals teaching\nat the Muslim school. A Muslim teacher claimed that decision-making power within the Muslim\nschool is held solely by Muslim teachers and Muslim community elders from the local mosque.\nTamil teachers are allegedly excluded from decision-making within the school, because the school\nis perceived to be a religiously homogenous institution, which is claimed as Muslim territory for\nthe purpose of the Muslim community. Tamil teachers are increasingly marginalised which,\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 83\naccording to Fraser (1995: 71), can be deemed as a form of both cultural injustice (recognition), as\nwell as political misrepresentation.\nThe third dimension we discuss here is redistribution, defined by Fraser (1995: 70) as `injustice\nwhich is rooted in the political-economic structure of society'. Housing throughout the city of\nJaffna, particularly in the Muslim community, has been decimated by war, with many returnees\nliving under canvas and without adequate sanitation and running water, acting as a deterrent to\nmany Muslims who choose not to return due to poor living conditions, considered by some as\nworse than IDP settlements. The government have acknowledged that assistance for the resettle-\nment of displaced Muslims has essentially been non-existent: `the treatment given to the Muslim\ncommunity of the Northern Province has led them to believe that they are at the bottom of the list\nof priorities of the government, INGOs [international NGOs] and NGOs and the donor\ncommunity'(Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, 2011). Furthermore, there have been\nclaims that Tamils actively obstruct Muslim resettlement through land disputes and the boycotting\nof Muslim businesses, which has compounded the sense of being `unwelcome in a place once\ncalled home' and injustices felt among recent Muslim returnees (teacher at the Muslim school).\nThere are parallels between the absence of redistribution of resources for housing and for sec-\nondary school education in the Muslim community. Our analysis shows how educational inequal-\nity and uneven distribution of resources between schools are perceived to be exacerbating rather\nthan mitigating tensions and conflict between students. Muslim students feel a sense of unfairness\nthat educational facilities at the Muslim school are perceived to be worse than those at neighbour-\ning Tamil schools. The Muslim school is currently in a state of disrepair and lacks the facilities and\nequipment which the other schools in this study currently possess, such as a library, science equip-\nment and computers. In light of this, all of the teachers interviewed at the Muslim school explicitly\nasserted that due to the associated problems and greater needs of the school in comparison with\nsurrounding schools, there is desperate need of additional and specialist assistance, with one\nteacher claiming `the school has not returned to normal functioning following Muslim resettle-\nment'. It is widely acknowledged by Tamils and Muslims in this study that the educational levels\nof students at the Muslim school are drastically below the level of neighbouring students at the\nTamil-Catholic and Tamil-Hindu schools due to displacement resulting in illiteracy and limited\npersonal development. Moreover, the Muslim school has the highest teacher student ratio in this\nstudy at 1:18, although this figure remains below the national average (World Bank, 2014).\nThe Tamil-Hindu school is the only school in this study to have the facilities to teach Advanced\nLevel, resulting in a flow of students from the Muslim school wishing to continue with their stud-\nies, which has both positive and negative outcomes. According to the principal of the Tamil-Hindu\nschool, this `system makes this school attractive and an alternative for poor underachieving stu-\ndents', as it allows `failed Ordinary Level students, those that would have dropped out of school\notherwise, are deserving of a second chance, despite negative repercussions for the school's reputa-\ntion'. This flow of students has become a tradition, developing links between the Hindu and\nMuslim community and contributing to de-segregation between Muslim and Tamil schoolchildren.\nStudents at the Muslim school feel it is unfair that their school is under-resourced when in compari-\nson with neighbouring schools such as the Tamil-Hindu school which teaches Advanced Level.\nSome teachers explicitly assert that inequality between schools in different areas is deepening divi-\nsions between young Muslims and Tamils, particularly the absence of Advanced Level at the\nMuslim school and the perceived lower quality of teaching and funding for facilities.\nBased on our analysis, formal peace education is the only component of secondary school edu-\ncation which can be said to be appropriately redistributed towards the Muslim community. As one\nof the few Islamic schools in the Northern Province, the Muslim school receives greater attention\nin terms of formal peace education than the Tamil-Catholic and Tamil-Hindu schools in this study.\n84 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nThe Muslim school has been selected for increased support from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr\nInternationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), one of the main non-governmental actors involved in for-\nmal peace education in secondary schools in Sri Lanka. This is one of 200 pilot schools in disad-\nvantaged areas receiving support and is considered a positive development by those within the\nMuslim community.Yet, conflict-affected vulnerable schoolchildren at neighbouring Tamil schools\nare not included in this programme. The implementation of peace education as developed in dis-\ncourse is perceived by teachers to be weak in the Tamil-Catholic and Tamil-Hindu schools and is\nplagued by shortages in training, funding and resources. Only four out of 14 teachers interviewed\nstated they had attended formal peace education training; yet they are expected to possess the\nappropriate skills to deliver peace education and incorporate it into all aspects of the school cur-\nriculum. One of those teachers who has attended such a training seminar explained that implemen-\ntation of peace education is `minimal', adding that `there has been no training, no interest, and no\nassistance from the Ministry of Education'. Formal peace education is generally not perceived by\nkey actors to be having an observable influence on further conflict between Muslim and Tamil\ngroups, as the following section will illustrate.\nThe fourth R of multi-scalar reconciliation\nRecalling here our earlier claim for the need to conduct a multi-scalar analysis and moving on now\nto focus our attention on the fourth R of reconciliation, we found that formal (peace) education is\nperceived by respondents not to be addressing the post-war needs for reconciliation within and\nbetween communities at the supra-community, inter-community and intra-community levels, as\ndemonstrated in Figure 1.\nFirst, analysis at the supra-community level examines the relationship between society and the\nstate, and national issues of history, language policy and free speech in the context of continued\naspects of militarisation and ethnicisation of education. Building on existing writings on the chal-\nlenges of reconciliation at the national level within and beyond educational reform by a number of\n2008), our study contributes by showing how Tamil and Muslim teachers were united in their criti-\ncism of a `biased' history curriculum which is seen as portraying Sinhalese Buddhism domination\nand cultural hegemony; and exercising the negative face of education. Four teachers were highly\ncritical of the history curriculum stating that it does not accurately represent Tamil and Muslim\nminority culture, with many strongly contending this as an act of purposeful discrimination. Some\nteachers commented the history text is heavily structured in favour of the Sinhalese ethnic group\nand adherence to Buddhism. Teaching centres on Buddhist texts, for example on the Mahavamsa,\nan important text in Theravada Buddhism that covers the early history of religion in Sri Lanka,\nwhich according to one teacher has `no relevance or benefit for Tamil and Muslim students'.\nLess than half (16 out of 34) of students explicitly asserted they thought that history teaching is\nbiased, with Muslim students less likely than Tamil students to acknowledge this perceived bias.\nThese teacher and student views confirm findings from earlier studies on the biased nature of history\nteaching in Sri Lanka (Lopes Cardozo, 2008, 2014) and confirm this is a continuing issue of concern.\nAlthough acknowledging that Muslims are one of the smallest ethno-religious groups in Sri Lanka,\nthere is certainly an underlying conviction among young Muslims that they should learn each culture\n\u00ad Muslim, Tamil and Sinhalese \u00ad in equal measure and not at the expense of the erosion of their own\nculture in a history curriculum, which should seek to promote inclusive identities and diversity.\nThe teaching of the second national language, in this case Sinhala language, in Tamil-speaking\nschools, is generally considered a potential positive tool for peace and reconciliation by teachers\nand students, yet there is a lack of implementation due to inadequate Sinhala language skills, lack\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 85\nof teacher training and no appointment of Sinhala language teachers within the three Tamil-medium\nsecondary schools. Of the 14 teachers interviewed, three could speak Sinhala fluently, of whom\ntwo were Muslim having learnt Sinhala whilst displaced from Jaffna. Of 18 Muslim students, six\ncan speak Sinhala, of whom two are fluent, and 4 can speak conversational Sinhala. This compares\nwith a mere three out of 16 Tamil students capable of speaking limited Sinhala. In general, Tamil-\nspeaking teachers want to teach Sinhala and Tamil-speaking students want to learn Sinhala in order\nto improve understanding and reconciliation between disparate communities and participate in Sri\nLankan civic life, with only one teacher voicing concerns that Sinhala is a threat to the identity of\nnorthern Tamil language and culture. The limited basic teaching of Sinhala is exacerbating ethnic\ninequality and preventing many young mono-lingual Tamil-speaking students from realising their\npotential and participating in society, as expressed by a Tamil teacher: `Without Sinhala language\nskills, students cannot locally benefit from communication with the army, police and government\nofficials, or when they go outside the Tamil North'. There exists a perception that Tamil-speaking\npeople, including northern Tamils and Muslims, feel as though they are subjugated at the national-\nlevel and persistently marginalised through language policies.\nSecond, at the inter-community level we explore the state of post-war ethno-religious reconcili-\nation between Tamil and Muslim communities in Jaffna, through analysing changing perceptions\nand attitudes facilitating greater understanding, integration and inclusion between these groups. In\nthis section on reconciliation we discuss inter-group grievances in relation to the interconnected\nissues of misdistribution, misrecognition and misrepresentation alluded to above. The importance\nof reconciliation at the inter-group level has been recognised by a number of scholars (Bush and\nFigure 1. Multi-scalar reconciliation conceptual diagram (adapted from Duncan, 2014).\n86 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nteachers and NGO staff involved in education practice that formal peace education does not address\nunresolved religious identity-driven conflict and instead focuses on the ethnic Tamil-Sinhalese\nproblem. A central contention of this paper is that peace education must give more leaning towards\ntensions and grievances between different religious groups and re-address religious misunder-\nstandings and intolerance, as this is identified as a central driver of conflict. Davies (2014) argues\nfor the need to critically question the role of religion in schooling, and how it potentially can exac-\nerbate rather than mitigate conflict, through processes of segregation, narrowing of views and ring-\nfencing religion as something above critique. According to Davies, secular and state-funded\nschools should encourage and allow for critical religious education across a wide range of student\nbackgrounds. While these arguments might hold in certain contexts, we do acknowledge that such\na secular approach might not be context-appropriate in every conflict-affected location. In the con-\ntext of Sri Lanka, and based on the voices of teachers and students represented in this study, the\nteaching of values, ethics and morals can be crucial to attaining religious tolerance and understand-\ning between these rival ethno-religious groups.\nFor example, a campaign for cultural and religious tolerance was launched in 2012, which is\nbased on ethics of mutual respect, multiculturalism and equality. A banner with the phrase `Respect\nOthers' is displayed prominently within all secondary schools in the Northern Province, including\nthe schools in this study, and is a crucial message of this campaign. In addition, there are teacher\ntraining seminars on creating a `culture of peace' within schools with an emphasis on `positivity'.\nTeachers are expected to maintain a positive state of mind and impart this philosophy to their stu-\ndents to develop a positive attitude towards others. However, there are a number of teachers deeply\ncritical of these initiatives, describing them as superficial and shallow which can be viewed as\nmerely a point of departure and not as a substitute for more rigorous and in-depth teaching. This is\nprimarily because this does not address societal and educational inequalities which the majority of\neducators ascertain as the root causes of ethnic conflict, but instead asserts a one-size-fits-all\napproach of individual happiness and positivity to a plethora of underlying complex factors.\nMoreover, an absence of trust and knowledge of one another's religion and culture is a key\nproblem identified by teachers, students and community members that is perceived to reinforce\nthe divide between them. This has led to calls for an increase in inter-ethnic and inter-religious\nparticipation events which allow a space for students to de-alienate those who identify them-\nselves differently in society and to discover the many commonalities among them. The imple-\nmentation of this through bottom-up agency of community groups and teachers will be discussed\nlater in this paper.\nThird, analysis at the intra-community level is concerned with post-war reconciliation within\ngroups, on an inter-personal and intra-personal basis, specifically related to psycho-social care and\noverall wellbeing. Internal conflict has afflicted Muslim, Tamil-Catholic and Tamil-Hindu com-\nmunities, framed by complex social problems (poverty; displacement; religious, gender and caste-\nbased discrimination; and violence). An important, although often repudiated component of peace\neducation should be to address the psychological wellbeing of children and teachers affected by\nwar. Former studies have aptly highlighted the need for greater focus on the psychological well-\nLopes Cardozo, 2008). According to the views of the majority of respondents, the existing problem\nof youth engagement in violent conflict, ignited by the psycho-social trauma of experiencing war,\nis continuing to curse communities and is a substantial challenge which cannot be ignored.\nAlthough all aspects of peace education require actions at the individual level, analysis at the\n`intra-community' level illustrated the psychological and social stresses of schoolchildren and\nyoung adults blighted by the past of a post-war and post-displacement society.\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 87\nGovernment authorities have been accused of neglecting the psycho-social needs of young\npeople after the war (Helbardt et al., 2010) however this need is gradually being met through a\nGIZ-implemented counselling programme, extra assistance for teachers and creating a support-\nive environment for vulnerable students (Davies, 2011). For selected secondary schools,\nresources have been provided by GIZ such as the appointment of specialist teachers and increased\ncounselling for secondary school students targeting those who have been subjected to abuse,\nviolence and displacement. According to GIZ staff, 160 war-affected schoolchildren throughout\nJaffna have been selected for counselling sponsored by GIZ. These claims are disputed by teach-\ners: the number of students receiving counselling and teachers receiving counselling training in\nthe researched schools has been minimal, yet all schools in this study are said to require psycho-\nsocial counselling. A Hindu teacher and trained counsellor at the Muslim school explained that\nthe school in fact obtained more funding for counsellor training and student welfare before the\nend of the war in 2009, but funding for these programmes has since been reduced. In the few\nGIZ-implemented conflict resolution classes which are held in schools, there is an emphasis\nupon developing peace at an individual level, concentrating on inter-personal relationships,\nbehavioural change and the `predisposition to fight', which Bush and Saltarelli (2000: 28) refer\nto as `de-militarisation of the mind'. `Peace should start with the individual', stated a teacher at\nthe Muslim school, while another stated, `if there is to be peace throughout the country, it begins\nthrough the individual and the family'.\nFurthermore, the presence of the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) is said to be negatively affecting stu-\ndents by creating an atmosphere of mistrust and fear. Out of 34 students, 25 stated that the military\npresence in Jaffna makes them fearful and negatively affects their studies. Without the involvement\nof GIZ, extra assistance for the most vulnerable conflict-affected students delivered through the\nMoE is minimal. In addition to the crucial recognition of the need to address trauma and provide\npsycho-social support to students, we would like to emphasise the simultaneous need to also\nacknowledge the trauma and need for support for teachers.\nTeacher, student and community agency for ethno-religious\nreconciliation\nAminority of teachers interviewed explicitly asserted that they actively pursued a personal strategy\nto deviate from the curriculum with which they disagreed, and instead teach with input from their\nown beliefs, culture and history, challenging the barriers of identity and prejudice between Muslims\nand Tamils in Jaffna, and beyond to the relationship with the Sinhalese. This form of teacher\nagency follows an educational objective advocated by Davies (2005: 32) to challenge exclusionary\nnationalist subjectivities and pre-conceived notions of identity and difference through an open\ndialogue. Teachers of this persuasion believe that to ignore the `problem of indoctrination' is more\ndamaging long-term to the sustainability of peace than to allow the truth to be told in a balanced\nand objective manner. One teacher commented: `the danger of not teaching the truth is perhaps\ngreater than the danger of teaching the truth'.\nTo inculcate the `correct'(more peaceful) values in their students, the Tamil-Catholic school has\nbegun to introduce and distribute a series of books to students that are not part of the formal cur-\nriculum and not certified by the MoE. Although these texts are not included in the national curricu-\nlum, teachers decide to teach this due to their own personal convictions and desire to place emphasis\nupon their own culture as the Principal of the school allows teachers a certain degree of autonomy.\nFor example, one such text is entitled 'The Art of Joyful Living', regarding the potential of religious\nreconciliation through making other religions integral to one's way of living, and its central concept\nsuggests Sri Lanka is a family of a diversity of religions, creeds and colours; another of these books\n88 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\n(taught in Grade 8 and 9) is entitled `Enlighten students and inculcating the right values in them',\na text for those affected by the war and deep-rooted prejudices. This justification for introducing\nalternative teaching materials is reinforced through a desire to instil values of equality and toler-\nance between religions, ethnicities and races in their students, an important theme which is present\nthroughout these selected texts.\nDisagreements between teachers persist regarding the need or possibility to discuss with stu-\ndents the 1983 to 2009 civil war, human rights abuses committed by the SLA and LTTE, forced\nevictions and the presence of the SLA in the Northern Province, a conversation officially forbid-\nden in schools and therefore unlikely to be discussed (Bush and Saltarelli, 2000; Davies, 2011;\nHoeks, 2012). In this study a minority of teachers actively pursued a pedagogy of interaction and\nthe valuing of shared experiences, stimulating classroom debate questioning the state's narrative\nof war crimes, human rights abuses and discrimination of minorities. For instance, a teacher at\nthe Tamil-Catholic school considered it to be a teacher's `responsibility to tell the truth, not the\ndistorted truth by government', and to challenge pre-existing power relations and government\ncontrol through education. A minority of teachers actively sought to discuss these issues with\nstudents. A teacher explained that during a regular 20-minute period towards the end of the class\nallocated for discussion, Advanced Level students are encouraged to debate current issues in the\nmedia: `We discussed an article...which stated in the final days of the war in Mullaitivu, a\nmother, father and children were shot. We discussed in class whether our army could have done\nit ... whether they could have murdered these innocent people'. There are other teachers who\ninsist that a teacher's role should not be to incite hatred in young people, and must be aware of\nthe sensitivities and risks associated with these types of discussions. Although some respondents\nclaim that it might be too early to have such conversations, what becomes clear is that teachers\nface a difficult situation with no guidance or support when such issues arise in a learning\nsetting.\nInterestingly, students in the three secondary schools have begun to exert agency for free speech,\ncritical thinking and political debate through student projects and unions. Through these extra-\ncurricular Tamil student unions and student debating clubs, a space for debate has been established\nwhere students actively set the agenda and argue for and against motions, for example on militari-\nsation of the north, devolution for Tamil areas and the discrimination of minorities. The vast major-\nity of students surveyed (28 out of 34) participate in these extra-curricular student forums and\ndebates, as they provide an opportunity to openly debate issues of war and human rights abuses\nwhich they are officially unable to do within the confines of formal education in the school\nclassroom.\nThe agency of students through individual projects in attempting to redefine the contested rela-\ntionship between the Muslim and Tamil communities is of particular interest. For example, a\nMuslim pupil studying Advanced Level is conducting a project regarding Muslim displacement,\ninvestigating the justification for such an eviction and the subsequent trauma experienced by\nMuslims, so he can inform young people of his age not aware of these issues. The student stated\nhis desire to conduct this research project `in order to learn from this and to stop this from happen-\ning again'. Like many young Muslims, he learnt about displacement from his parents, but recog-\nnises their views can be subjective and carry prejudicial attitudes; yet he seeks to challenge these\ninherited assumptions of the Tamil-Muslim relationship. This example can be viewed as repre-\nsentative of many young people we spoke to as they expressed their aspirations to positively\nchange their communities. Although we recognise that we draw from a relatively small sample of\nrespondents, it is interesting to note that especially Muslim teachers and students express an inner\ndesire to address issues of the recent past, and re-examine the social and historical context of edu-\ncation in Jaffna and their position in relation to it.\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 89\nAgency has also emanated from individuals and community-based organisations in both Muslim\nand Tamil communities who have begun to take it upon themselves to re-define the role of educa-\ntion in the community for ethno-religious reconciliation. According to respondents, the perpetua-\ntion of ethnic inequalities and conflict has motivated local groups into action and increased\ninvolvement within the education system. However, there is a reluctance and fear to engage in such\nactivities because of recent cases whereby activists have endured intimidation from the SLA and\nhave disappeared following engagement in Muslim-Tamil reconciliation. Based on these circum-\nstances it seems that agency for ethno-religious reconciliation through community activities that\nare `underground' is the only viable alternative in an environment of silence.\nAs part of a shift towards educational democratisation, the School Development Society is per-\nceived as the official channel of interaction between community and school, and is driven by stu-\ndents' parents becoming involved in the politics and extra-funding for a school. Throughout the\nthree secondary schools, this form of local participation is said not to be encouraged by Government\nand MoE officials, which could be viewed as preventing and stifling local agency, initiative and a\nsense of local ownership of education. Despite this, the School Development Society at the Muslim\nschool, which consists of predominantly Muslim parents, has recently funded a conflict mediation\nseminar and counselling for individual students, run in conjunction with an alumni organization,\nthe `Old Boys Association' and local community-based organisations. There are a number of\nMuslim parents and local activists working with Tamil individuals who assist the school in terms\nof campaigning for better quality education and fundraising for extra classes for students.\nA select number of Tamil individuals, who are generally professional, well-educated and recent\nreturnees to Jaffna, have been instrumental in activating this change of direction for education\ntowards the means of reconciliation. One such individual is a Tamil teacher at the Muslim school,\nwho has assisted greatly in the reopening of the school, helping the Muslim community and bat-\ntling teacher and funding shortages; meanwhile, another Tamil respondent has recently become a\ncommunity coordinator, organising free after-school classes for schoolchildren in the Muslim\nschool to improve literacy and numeracy. Community assistance in secondary school education\nhas begun to establish itself in the research location, as a Tamil individual explained: `In early\n2010, our community centre began to host study nights, allowing schoolchildren who didn't have\nelectricity, lights or desks to study at the community centre. Students from any school and area are\nwelcome here.' Furthermore, due to the poverty and lack of facilities within the Muslim commu-\nnity, Muslim schoolchildren have been welcomed into the homes of Tamils where joint study\ngroups have been arranged for students from the Muslim school and Tamil-Catholic school. This\nhas provided students with different ethno-religious identities an opportunity to study together and\nto build relationships and friendships with one another, promoting reconciliation \u00ad and addressing\nissues of misdistribution of access and resources \u00ad between formerly opposing groups.\nInter-religious reconciliation through cross-community engagement, collaboration and partici-\npation is identified as a priority area by both Muslim and Tamil communities to improve relations\nbetween them. Opportunities for inter-religious events within and between schools are limited\nthrough formal peace education channels, however there have been events organized through the\ncommunity. External community-based organisations have initiated efforts to improve relations,\nparticularly through inter-religious and inter-cultural events structured to develop religious toler-\nance and understanding between Muslim, Hindu and Catholic schoolchildren. For example, some\nschool principals, community representatives and religious leaders have facilitated inter-religious\nparticipation days whereby Tamil schoolchildren of Hindu or Catholic faith will participate in cel-\nebrating religious festivals such as Muharram (the Islamic new year) and Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet\nMuhammad's birthday), and vice versa. A teacher explained religious festivals held between sec-\nondary schools organised by civil society on a voluntary basis:\n90 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nMuslim students wear traditional Tamil dress to foster respect at a festival of religion which occurs\nannually in the month of May. This festival promotes understanding between religions. Similar festivals\nrevolve around schools, for example a Catholic festival in Hindu school, Hindu festival in Muslim school,\nand Muslim festival in Catholic school.\nLikewise, language competitions facilitate inter-religious participation, for example Sinhala lan-\nguage competitions between Tamil-speaking Hindus, Catholics, and Muslims organised by Muslim\nparents in Killinochi and Jaffna.\nMany students believe peace education should be implemented through another avenue of\ninformal extra-curricular education, in which communities can play a larger part in construction\nof curricula and alternative learning spaces. When students were questioned on whether they\nbelieve inter-ethnic and inter-religious meetings can change negative attitudes and stereotypes of\npeople from other religions, all students answered yes, further reinforcing the widespread opinion\nof the Jaffna student community for enabling greater integration. Through these findings it can be\nconcluded that despite the recognised prejudice of their parents' generation, schoolchildren them-\nselves acknowledge that through socialisation with other ethno-religious groups, prejudice can\neventually be overcome. Through this form of inter-ethnic interaction, schoolchildren can increas-\ningly develop what Davies refers to as `hybrid identities' (Davies, 2011). Not only opportunities\nfor students, these events allow members of each community to interact and engage with one\nanother's culture as parents of pupils, prominent community representatives, and religious leaders\nare invited. This convergence of a disparate civil society, the vehicle of secondary school educa-\ntion, and the uniting cause of Tamil\u00adMuslim reconciliation is having lasting success in facilitating\nshared understanding and tolerance of one another's culture.\nConclusions and possible ways forward\nResearch on the implementation, perceptions and experiences of education and its potential for\nreconciliation in the Tamil north has been limited and it is hoped this paper will start to fill a\nvoid in the literature. In moving away from a narrow educational analysis, this paper has pur-\nsued a methodological broadening of the role of education for building peace towards political,\ncultural and social contexts, in line with the work of Novelli and Smith (2011). Following the\nby (Novelli, Lopes Cardozo and Smith, 2015), we applied an interdisciplinary and multi-scalar\nframework that analysed the interconnected analytical dimensions of redistribution, recogni-\ntion, representation and reconciliation.\nThe three data analysis sections of this paper engaged, first, with an analysis of the (re)produc-\ntion of structural economic, social and political injustices in education, engaging most directly with\nthe analytical dimensions of redistribution, recognition and representation, and how these are\nplayed within educational discourses and practices. We have utilised Bush and Saltarelli's (2000)\nconceptualisation of the `two faces of education' to demonstrate that formal education is perceived\nto be the embodiment of the negative face of education through enforced segregation, manipula-\ntion and ethnic bias of the curriculum, and repression of critical thinking and debate, driving fur-\nther conflict between Muslim and Tamil communities in Jaffna. Simultaneously, the agency of\nindividuals (teachers and students) and external actors (community members and organisations)\ncan be viewed as a concerted effort to implement the positive face of education and mitigate the\nnegative impacts of formal schooling, through the desegregation of ethno-religious groups, the\nteaching and enactment of democratic principles, seeking a more sustainable solution to ethno-\nreligious conflict through educational means.\nDuncan and Lopes Cardozo 91\nOur analysis of the fourth R of reconciliation, in relation to the other three Rs, illustrated how\nrespondents perceived formal forms of peace education through secondary schooling as inadequate\nin addressing the central issues of reconciliation. Extra-curricular or non-formal education, as con-\nducted through teachers' adaptation of the official curriculum or additional student-led or commu-\nnity initiatives, in contrast did seem to carry the potential of reconciliation. However, although the\nlatter non-formal community-driven initiatives were perceived as more successful in fostering rec-\nonciliation amongst the various communities, they have difficulties in addressing the structural\ninequalities and root causes of conflict that are being reproduced and institutionalised through the\nformal education system, and hence, expansive reforms of the formal education system are needed\nto better respond to continuing underlying tensions and potential new conflict triggers to build a\nmore positive and sustainable peace.\nOur analysis furthermore demonstrated how (formal) peace education is criticised by key\nMuslim and Tamil actors as highly politicised as it is too narrowly focused on the ethnic problem\nat the national level. Our analysis of a `politics of the 4 Rs through education' showed that in addi-\ntion to ethnic identity, religious identity is a major source of conflict within education, and so peace\neducation could benefit from shifting the paradigm of ethnic reconciliation to one that also includes\nreligious reconciliation, reflecting increasing conflict between the four main religious groups of Sri\nLanka. Hence, we suggest that in order to reach the full potential of education for building peace\nin the post-war context, an engagement is needed with all four interconnected Rs, not only within\nthe education sector, but importantly with education integrated into a broader, inter-sectoral, multi-\nscalar approach to building a more sustainable peace. Although we recognise that in the highly\ncomplex, politicised and volatile context of Sri Lanka, and as `outside researchers', this is easier\nsaid than done, we build our arguments on the accounts of those who live these unequal educa-\ntional and societal realities on a day to day basis. It is with the intention of providing a voice to\nthose people that we make these arguments and offer some suggestions for policymaking and\nfuture researchers working in a similar area.\nIn terms of the implementation of an education for peace, our data reveal greater support is\nneeded from the government of Sri Lanka to implement peace education and to expand the pol-\nicy country-wide. There is a more general need to increase investment in the education system,\nensuring the equitable distribution of resources as a requirement of a sustainable approach to\npeacebuilding in this post-war context. Furthermore, de-segregation of ethno-religious groups\nthrough a (more) integrated system of schooling seems necessary to prevent a sense of injustice\nand perception that peace education is not genuine and lacks political will. Formal (peace) edu-\ncation, as it is experienced in its current form, seems to be reinforcing the perception among\nTamil-speaking northern minorities (both Muslim and Tamil) that they are continuing to be\npersecuted for the actions of the LTTE. Therefore, it is believed that a greater local involvement\nin education reform, and peace education policy more specifically, through a consultation pro-\ncess (including teachers and students) might allow for a more just representation and voice in\ndecision-making processes. In addition, community groups should be incentivised to participate\nin this process by the state, rather than discouraged as is currently the case. We acknowledge that\nparticipatory consultation processes are naturally not fully inclusive due to practical concerns.\nTherefore, we recommend that the next steps towards more inclusive, contextualised and mean-\ningful implementation of education that serves social cohesion and peace would benefit from a\nthorough, accessible system of teacher training and teacher support (including equitable finan-\ncial compensation, optional social-emotional counselling and authority and autonomy to contex-\ntualise teaching content).\nBased on the reflections of our respondents, further exploration of the creation of a comparative\nreligion subject seems worth exploring further. This would entail discussing religion in a critical\n92 Research in Comparative & International Education 12(1)\nyet respectful way, which are seen by respondents as practical steps which could be implemented\nin order for genuine post-war reconciliation to take place. Our final thought presented in this paper\nacknowledges that peace education cannot succeed unilaterally, without political consensus for\nstructural reform, a conclusion similarly expressed elsewhere (Lopes Cardozo, 2008, 2014; Davies,\n2011). Jaffna Muslims and Tamils (Hindu and Catholic) are two minority groups struggling to\nassert their claim to religious and cultural distinctiveness, civic rights and participation in an inclu-\nsive democracy; however, there exists a wider problem affecting all Sri Lankan citizens subjected\nto a disruptive history and continuation of tense and conflictual state-society relations with levels\nof mistrust. Peace-inclined education alone can assist in the creation of less violent, more equitable\nand inclusive societies (Gupta et al., 2015), yet it cannot fundamentally alter the structural inequal-\nities at the macro-level and micro-level of Sri Lankan society by itself.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\n\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nBibliography\nAturupane H and Wikramanayake D (2011) The promotion of social cohesion through education in Sri\nLanka.
