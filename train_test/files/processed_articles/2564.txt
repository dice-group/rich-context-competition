    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Contextual factors, such as exposure to stressors, may be antecedents to IPV perpetration. These\ncontextual factors may be amenable to modification through intervention and prevention. However, few studies\nhave examined specific contextual factors. To begin to address this gap, we examined the associations between\nfinancial stressors and three types of physical IPV perpetration.\nMethods: This analysis used data from Wave IV of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.\nWe used logistic regression to examine the associations of financial stressors and each type of IPV (minor, severe,\ncausing injury), and multinomial logit regression to examine the associations of financial stressors and patterns of\nco-occurring types of IPV perpetration (only minor; only severe; minor and severe; minor, severe, and causing injury;\ncompared with no perpetration).\nResults: Fewer men perpetrated threats/minor physical IPV (6.7 %) or severe physical IPV (3.4 %) compared with\nwomen (11.4 % and 8.8 %, respectively). However, among physical IPV perpetrators, a higher percentage of men\n(32.0 %) than women (21.0 %) reported their partner was injured as a result of the IPV. In logistic regression models\nof each type of IPV perpetration, both the number of stressors experienced and several types of financial stressors\nwere associated with perpetrating each type of IPV. Utilities nonpayment, housing nonpayment, food insecurity,\nand no phone service were associated with increased odds of perpetrating each form of IPV in adjusted analysis.\nEviction was associated with perpetrating severe physical IPV but not threats/minor IPV or IPV causing injury. In\nmultinomial logit regression comparing patterns of IPV perpetration to perpetrating no physical IPV, the relationships\nof financial stressors were less consistent. Food insecurity was associated with perpetrating only minor physical IPV.\nComparatively, overall number of financial stressors and four types of financial stressors (utilities nonpayment,\nhousing nonpayment, food insecurity, and disconnected phone service) were associated with perpetrating all three\nforms of physical IPV.\nConclusions: Combined with prior research, our results suggested interventions to improve financial well-being may\nbe a novel way to reduce physical IPV perpetration.\n",

Up to a third of women\nand a quarter of men report experiencing physical or sex-\nual assault by an intimate partner during their lifetime\n(Black et al. 2011). Victimization of IPV is associated with\nsignificant health burdens and has been linked to a number\nDespite a growing evidence base on the prevalence,\nrisk factors, and intervention programs for IPV, much of\nthe literature focuses on risk factors and intervention ef-\nforts for victims of IPV, with relatively little emphasis on\nperpetrators. As a result, there are few empirically sup-\nported interventions for IPV perpetrators (Eckhardt\net al. 2006). Some researchers suggest that the limited\neffectiveness of prevention and intervention efforts is\nthe result of the oversimplification of antecedents to per-\npetration, especially the contextual factors at the time of\nStress, the individualized response to challenging situ-\nations, is associated with increased risk for IPV (Capaldi\nexamined specific stressors, which are the events that\ntrigger the stress response, as antecedents to IPV perpet-\nration (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al. 2012a; Elkins et al.\nThe Catalyst Model of Aggression hypothesized individ-\nuals develop a predisposition to violence as a result of\npersonal characteristics (e.g., genes, personality) and his-\ntorical environmental factors (e.g., exposure to violence)\n(Ferguson and Dyck 2012). Individuals with a high pre-\ndisposition to violence are more likely to respond to en-\nvironmental triggers (e.g., social interactions, stressors)\nwith violence, compared with individuals with a lower\npredisposition to violence (Ferguson and Dyck 2012).\nAlthough untested for IPV perpetration, there is some\nevidence the Catalyst Model predicts other forms of vio-\nlence perpetration (Ferguson et al. 2013; Ferguson et al.\nFinancial stress often impacts both individuals and the\ncouple (Mason and Smithey 2012) and is a commonly\ncited antecedent to IPV perpetration (Byun 2012; Slep\nprevalent in areas with low neighborhood income or\nhigh socioeconomic deprivation, which may be indica-\ntive of the financial stressors experienced by residents\nin findings highlights the difference between stressors\n(the event) and stress (the response). Individual stress\nresponses to environmental stressors vary as a result of a\nwide range of factors, such as genes (Bouma et al. 2012)\nand prior experiences (Lovallo 2013), so the relationship\nbetween financial context and IPV perpetration may de-\npend on the distinction between financial stress and\nstressors (Benson et al. 2003). Perceptions of financial\nstress (individuals' processing of stressor events), are\nsignificantly associated with IPV victimization among\nwomen, but more objective measures of financial\nstressors (the event which causes the stress response),\nsuch as income to needs ratio, are not significantly\nassociated with IPV victimization (Benson et al. 2003).\nAdditionally, perceived financial stress is a significant\npredictor of physical IPV perpetration among both men\nand women in two studies (Neff et al. 1995; Slep et al.\n2010). To our knowledge, there have been no studies of\nthe relationship between specific financial stressors and\nIPV perpetration so it is unclear if exposure to financial\nstressors is an antecedent to IPV perpetration.\nThe purpose of this analysis is to determine the extent\nto which experiences of specific financial stressors are\nassociated with making threats of violence/minor\nphysical IPV perpetration, severe physical IPV perpet-\nration, and physical IPV resulting in injury, as re-\nported by perpetrators. Given the limited effectiveness\nof IPV prevention and intervention efforts, it is im-\nportant to understand modifiable risk factors, such as\nstressors, and their relationship with IPV perpetration.\nThe results of this analysis may have important impli-\ncations for the development and implementation of\nIPV prevention and intervention activities, especially\nthose targeting social context at the time of IPV\nperpetration.\nMethods\nWe performed a secondary analysis of the Wave IV data\nof The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to\nAdult Health (Add Health). The Add Health study began\ndesign included systematic sampling methods and\nstratification to ensure the sample was representative\nof the United States population of adolescents (Harris\nrolled in the study, 15,701 were interviewed during\nthe 2008 Wave IV when they were between the ages\nitional information on the study design, including in-\nformation on the institutional review board approval\nand informed consent process, is available elsewhere\nTo be eligible for this analysis, participants must have\nbeen in a relationship during the past year. IPV perpet-\nration was measured as occurring within the last 12-\nmonths of the most recent relationship. Since measure-\nment of exposure to financial stressors was limited to\nthe 12 months prior to the interview, participants who\nreported on relationship experiences more distant than\nthe prior 12 months were excluded. Additionally, partici-\npants who were incarcerated during the interview were\nexcluded because the outcomes for this analysis required\nthe ability to have physical contact with an intimate\npartner. Participants were also excluded if they did not\nrespond to questions about IPV perpetration, financial\nstressors, or study covariates.\nA total of 15,701 participants completed data collec-\ntion during Wave IV of the Add Health study. Of these\nwere not in a relationship during the past twelve months\nand/or were currently incarcerated. Of the remaining\nmissing data for IPV questions, financial stressors, or\nother covariates, resulting in a sample size of 11,499.\nAs recommended by the Add Health research team,\nwe set the weight of any excluded participants to\nrectly completed, but excluded participants do not\ncontribute to the estimates produced by the models\n(Chen and Chantala 2014). Dropping participants\nfrom the weighting protocol would result in unrepre-\nsentative weights and incorrect standard errors (Chen and\nMeasurement\nIntimate partner violence perpetration\nThe outcomes of this analysis were three forms of phys-\nical IPV: making threats of physical IPV/minor physical\nIPV (\"How often have you threatened [partner] with vio-\nlence, pushed or shoved (him/her), or thrown something\nat (him/her) that could hurt?); severe physical IPV (How\noften have you slapped, hit, or kicked [partner]?); and\nphysical IPV resulting in injury (How often has [partner]\nhad an injury, such as a sprain, bruise, or cut because of\nParticipants reported how frequently they perpetrated\neach form of IPV on a scale ranging from \"never\" to\n\"more than twenty times in the last year\". Each question\nwas dichotomized to categorize participants as perpet-\nrating this form of IPV at least once in the prior year or\nnot perpetrating this form. Using these questions, we\ncreated mutually exclusive categorizations of the pat-\nterns of IPV perpetration, which were used in the\nmultinomial models: only threats/minor physical; only\nsevere physical; threats/minor physical and severe\nphysical; and all three forms including physical resulting\nin injury. Thirty-two participants (0.2 %) reported perpet-\nrating severe physical IPV and IPV resulting in an in-\njury but not threats/minor IPV. Given the small\nnumber, these participants were excluded from the\nmultinomial models of patterns of IPV but were in-\ncluded in all other analyses.\nFinancial stressors\nParticipants reported if they had experienced six types of\nfinancial stressors at least once in the past twelve\nmonths: nonpayment of utilities for financial reasons,\nnonpayment of housing for financial reasons, fears of\nfood unavailability, phone disconnected due to financial\nreasons, utilities turned-off due to nonpayment, and\nWe summed the total number of financial stressors\nexperienced by each participant, which ranged from zero\n(no financial stressors in past year) to six (all forms of fi-\nnancial stressors in the past year), which is consistent\nwith prior treatment of this measure (Halliday Hardie\nand Lucas 2010). We created models using both the\ntotal number of financial stressors and each individual\ntype of financial stressor. Additional information on the\ntreatment of the exposure and outcome variables is in-\ncluded in Appendix.\nCovariates\nWe considered a range of possible covariates with rela-\ntionships to IPV perpetration and/or financial stressors.\nWe selected our covariates based on a literature review\nand a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (Shrier and Platt\n2008), a visual representation of the assumed relation-\nships between the variables of interest and their covari-\nates, which allows for careful selection of covariates to\navoid introducing bias through covariate selection. Se-\nlected covariates included gender, race, health, neuroti-\ncism, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. We also considered\ncontrolling for perceived stress and relationship conflict,\nbut conceptualized those variables as part of the causal\npathway between financial stressors and IPV perpetra-\ntion. We also considered controlling for education and\nemployment, but felt that the potential bias of those var-\niables was, in our conceptualization, controlled through\nthe selected covariates.\nGender and race were measured using participant\nself-report. Perceived health was measured as partici-\npant self-reported general health. Neuroticism was\nmeasured using the NEO-FFI scale (Harris et al. 2009),\nwhich summed responses to twelve questions to create\na single measure of neuroticism. Alcohol abuse was\nmeasured as self-reported experience of the diagnostic\ncriteria for alcohol dependence or abuse as defined by the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM-IV) (American Psychological Association 1994)\nsuch as increased tolerance, withdrawal symptoms,\nand/or social or interpersonal issues related to alcohol\nuse. Drug abuse was measured using the number of\nself-reported symptoms consistent with DSM-IV diag-\nnostic criteria for drug abuse, including failure to per-\nform role obligations, legal problems, and/or social or\ninterpersonal issues associated with drug use (American\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were weighted and clustered by school and\nprimary sampling unit to account for the survey design\nof the Add Health study as recommended by the Carolina\nPopulation Center (Chen and Chantala 2014). All descrip-\ntive analyses reported the weighted point estimates and\n95 % confidence intervals for the estimates. Chi-square\ntests were used to determine if exposure to financial\nstressors and rates of IPV perpetration were equal across\ngender (Table 1).\nWeighted, clustered, single-variable and multivariable\nregression models were used to estimate the association\nbetween each financial stressor, the total number of fi-\nnancial stressors, and IPV perpetration. IPV perpetration\nwas modeled two ways. First, we modeled each form of\nIPV separately in logistic regression, which models the\nodds of perpetrating the specific form of IPV compared\nwith participants who did not perpetrate that form of\nIPV (Table 2). In this analysis, categorizations were not\nmutually exclusive and may have resulted in substantial\nheterogeneity of the comparison group, because it in-\ncluded participants who perpetrated no forms of IPV\nbut also those who perpetrated other forms of IPV.\nTo reduce this heterogeneity, we used multinomial\nlogit regression models, which modeled IPV as mutu-\nally exclusive categorizations of perpetration com-\npared to no IPV perpetration (Table 3). Although the\nfirst method of analysis is more common in the lit-\nerature, multinomial logit regression models may be a\nmore precise method of analysis when multiple out-\nWe also examined gender as a possible modifier of the\nrelationship between financial stressors and IPV perpet-\nration. We assessed moderation by including an inter-\naction term of gender and the exposure variable in the\nfinal models and examining the significance of the inter-\naction term.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nexperienced at least one financial stressor (Table 1).

However,\namong perpetrators of physical IPV, a significantly\nhigher number of men reported causing injury to their\nwomen did not perpetrate any form of IPV in the\nprior year.\nIntimate partner violence and financial stressors\nWe did not find evidence to support significant moder-\nation of the relationship between financial stressors and\nIPV perpetration by gender. Since stratification did not\nsignificantly influence the results, we report only the\ncombined results. In short, although women experience\nboth IPV perpetration and financial stressors at a higher\nrate, the associations of financial stressors and IPV per-\npetration were not significantly different between men\nand women.\nOverall, the number of financial stressors was strongly\nassociated with each form of physical IPV, after adjusting\nfor gender, race, perceived health, neuroticism, alcohol\nuse, and drug use (Table 2). For each additional financial\nstressor, the odds of perpetration increased 1.16 times\ninjury.\nFour of the six types of financial stressor were associ-\nated with significantly higher odds of perpetrating each\nform of physical IPV compared to all others in the sam-\nple. In adjusted analysis, utilities nonpayment, housing\nnonpayment, food insecurity, and disconnected phone\nservice were associated with increased odds of each form\nof physical IPV. In addition, the odds of perpetrating se-\n4.23 %) among those who were evicted compared to\nthose who were not evicted.\nIn the remaining analysis, individuals who perpe-\ntrated each specific pattern of IPV were compared to\nthose who perpetrated no forms of IPV (Table 3). In\nadjusted analyses, an increasing number of financial\nstressors was not associated with significantly in-\ncreased odds of perpetrating only threats/minor phys-\nical IPV compared with perpetrating no IPV. However,\nthe odds of perpetrating only severe physical IPV (OR:\n1.41) significantly increased with each additional finan-\ncial stressor, compared to individuals who did not\nperpetrate IPV.\nThe relationships between individual financial stressors\nand IPV perpetration were not consistent across pat-\nterns of perpetration, although more severe patterns\nof violence were associated with more of the individ-\nual financial stressors. In adjusted analysis, only food\ninsecurity remained significantly associated with per-\npetration of only threats/minor physical IPV com-\npared to perpetrating no IPV. Comparatively, utilities\nnonpayment, housing nonpayment, food insecurity,\nand disconnected phone service were significantly as-\nsociated with perpetrating all three forms of physical\nIPV compared with individuals who perpetrated no\nphysical IPV.\nTable 2 Association of financial stressors and perpetration of threats of IPV, physical IPV, and IPV resulting in injury\nThreats/Minor physical IPVa Severe physical IPVb IPV resulting in injuryc\nCrude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)d Crude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)d Crude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)d\nContinuous measure of number of stressors\nNumber of financial\nstressorse\nIndividual stressors\naCompared to those who did not perpetrate threats/minor physical IPV\nbCompared to those who did not perpetrate severe physical IPV\ncCompared to those who did not perpetrate IPV resulting in injury\ndAdjusted for gender, race, perceived health, neuroticism, alcohol abuse or dependence, and drug abuse\neModeled as continuous ranging from 0 to 6 forms of financial stressors\nfRef = No experience of this form of financial stressor\nTable 3 Association of financial stressors and patterns of IPV perpetration\nOnly threats/minor physicala Only severe physical IPVa Threats/Minor & severe physical IPVa All three formsa\nCrude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)b Crude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)b Crude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)b Crude OR (95 % CI) Adjusted OR (95 % CI)b\nContinuous measure of number of stressors\nNumber of financial\nstressorsc\nIndividual stressors\naCompared to participants who perpetrated no forms of IPV in the past year\nbAdjusted for gender, race, perceived health, neuroticism, alcohol abuse or dependence, and drug abuse\ncModeled as continuous ranging from 0 to 6 forms of financial stressors\ndRef = No experience of this form of financial stressor\nDiscussion\nAs hypothesized by the Catalyst Model of Aggression,\nexposure to stressors, specifically financial stressors, was\nassociated with physical IPV perpetration among men\nand women. Consistent with the prior literature on the\ninequalities in wage and wealth acquisition by gender\npetration by gender (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al.\n2012b), a higher proportion of women reported experi-\nencing financial stressors and perpetrating physical IPV.\nWith few exceptions, both the number of financial\nstressors and the individual financial stressors were asso-\nciated with increased odds of making threats/minor\nphysical IPV, severe physical IPV, and IPV resulting in\ninjury. There were some differences in these relation-\nships when we examined specific patterns of perpetra-\ntion. For example, the overall number of financial\nstressors was a significant predictor of threats/minor\nphysical IPV perpetration when modeled as anyone who\nhad perpetrated this form of IPV compared with all\nother participants, including perpetrators of other types\nof IPV. However, the overall number of financial\nstressors was not a significant predictor of threats/minor\nphysical IPV perpetration when modeled as people who\nonly perpetrated threats/minor IPV compared with indi-\nviduals who perpetrated no IPV. This result suggests\nthat exposure to financial stressors did not increase the\nodds of only threats/minor physical IPV perpetration. It\ndid, however, increase the odds of this form of IPV in\ncombination with other forms. These divergent findings\nhave significant implications for the measurement and\nanalysis of IPV perpetration. Although much of the lit-\nerature has reported the results of separate models for\neach type of IPV outcome, the difference in findings be-\ntween the two methods may support the use of multi-\nnomial models when predicting overlapping outcomes,\nsuch as multiple forms of IPV.\nAn unexpected finding was the overall lack of associ-\nation between more severe forms of financial stressors\nand IPV perpetration. For example, in the multinomial\nmodel, eviction was not associated with perpetration of\nonly threats/minor physical IPV, only severe physical\nIPV, or all three forms. Eviction was only associated with\nperpetration of both threats/minor and severe physical\nIPV. Similarly, having the utilities turned off was not as-\nsociated with any of the patterns IPV perpetration, when\ncompared to individuals who perpetrated no forms of\nphysical IPV. This finding was unexpected because prior\nresearch suggested financial issues related to housing are\nmore strongly associated with physical and mental mani-\nfestations of stress than food insecurity (Liu et al. 2014).\nAdditionally, individuals who experienced moderate\nlevels of housing strain (i.e., at least one late or incom-\nplete payment) have reported substantially lower levels\nof psychological and physical distress compared with in-\ndividuals who have been removed from their home due\nto nonpayment (Cannuscio et al. 2012). Additional re-\nsearch is necessary to further examine if the limited as-\nsociation between severe financial stressors and IPV\nperpetration is limited to this dataset, if it is a function\nof examining individual financial experiences rather than\npatterns of experiences, or if other factors may be con-\ntributing to this relationship.\nOur results were, overall, consistent with the small\nbody of literature connecting experience with financial\nstress to IPV. Our literature review identified nine stud-\nies on the associations between financial context and\nIPV perpetration. Three of those studies focused exclu-\nsively on male-perpetrated IPV as reported by the female\n2013). Economic abuse, defined as behaviors that control\na partner's ability to be economically secure, is common\namong women who experience other forms of abuse\n(Adams et al. 2008). In addition, economic abuse may\nalter women's perceptions of financial stress, so those re-\nsults were not directly comparable to the results of this\never, each of these studies contributed to our general\nunderstanding of the role of financial stress in IPV\nperpetration.\nOne additional study examined the association of\nsocioeconomic deprivation and IPV victimization\namong men and women (Khalifeh et al. 2013). Low\nsocial class, measured as the occupational classifica-\ntion of respondent, and low income were strongly as-\nsociated with lifetime experiences of physical IPV\namong women but not among men (Khalifeh et al.\n2013). However, these results must be interpreted\nwith caution because it was unknown if current eco-\nnomic status was consistent with economic status at\nthe time of the IPV victimization.\nTwo studies examined the association between finan-\ncial stress and IPV as reported by the perpetrator. In a\nsample of men and women from Texas, perceived finan-\ncial stress was a significant predictor of physical IPV\nperpetration among both men and women after adjust-\ning for income, traditional beliefs about gender roles,\nand perpetrator and victim alcohol use (Neff et al. 1995.)\nIn a study of men and women enlisted in the US Air\nForce, financial stress was also associated with physical\nIPV perpetration among both men and women (Slep\net al. 2010). Generally, our findings were similar to these\ntwo studies, but we further examined the role of specific\ntypes of financial stressors, rather than overall percep-\ntion of financial stress. Additionally, we expanded upon\nthese findings to include multiple forms of physical IPV\nperpetration and found financial stressors were, overall,\nnot associated with only making threats of physical IPV\nor minor physical IPV. However, overall number of\nstressors and individual types of stressors were signifi-\ncantly associated with more severe forms of IPV\nperpetration.\nFinally, one study focused on male perpetrated IPV\nand included reports of both IPV and financial stress by\nboth partners (Benson et al. 2003). In this study, subject-\nive financial stress was strongly associated with in-\ncreased odds of male-to-female physical IPV, but\nincome-to-needs ratio, a more objective measure of fi-\nnancial stressors, was not associated with IPV perpetra-\ntion. Our analysis was unable to measure perceptions of\nfinancial stress, defined as how individuals mentally re-\nspond to financial stressors, but it did find that experien-\ncing financial stressors was associated with increased\nodds of IPV perpetration among men and women. The\ndiscrepancy between our findings and the findings on\nincome-to-needs ratio may have important implications\nfor intervention strategies because it may indicate that\nsubjective financial stress and management of finances\nare better predictors of IPV perpetration than overall\nfinancial resources. Additional research examining the\nrelative contributions of financial stress, financial\nstressors, and financial management may provide further\nguidance on effective financial interventions.\nImplications for intervention\nIn combination with prior findings, our findings have\nimplications for the development of interventions to\nprevent IPV through improving the financial context of\ncouples. Among female victims of IPV, career counseling\nhas been shown to improve perceptions of financial\nhowever, it is not clear if career counseling would be ef-\nfective to reduce exposure to financial stressors. Direct\neconomic intervention (i.e., providing funds) may be an-\nother method of IPV prevention (Matjasko et al. 2013;\nKim et al. 2007). However, a systematic review of eco-\nnomic interventions in low-income countries found\nmixed results in reducing IPV (Yvas and Watts 2009) so\nadditional research is necessary before this type of inter-\nvention is implemented.\nOur findings suggest less severe forms of financial\nstressors (e.g., utilities nonpayment) have a stronger as-\nsociation with IPV perpetration than the more severe\nforms of financial stressors (e.g., utilities turned off).\nHowever, individuals often experience the less severe\nforms of financial stressors prior to experiencing the\nmore severe forms so interventions may effectively pre-\nvent IPV perpetration if they target individuals in the\nearly stages of financial stressor experiences.\nFuture interventions may be guided by additional re-\nsearch into the differing relationships of IPV perpetra-\ntion and perceptions of financial stress, specific financial\nstressors, and overall financial resources. Disentangling\nthe relative contributions of financial stress resulting\nfrom poor financial management compared with finan-\ncial stress resulting from limited financial resources may\nprovide additional guidance into the most effective inter-\nvention methods. The development of future interven-\ntions may also be enhanced by additional information\non the financial experiences of perpetrators. Our litera-\nture review suggests victims and their experiences are\noften the focus of this line of research so additional re-\nsearch on the financial experiences of victims, perpetra-\ntors, and victim-perpetrators may further guide the\ndevelopment and tailoring of effective interventions.\nLimitations\nWe relied upon self-report of IPV experiences by the\nperpetrator. A recent study suggests the reported rates\nof IPV vary significantly if IPV is measured based on re-\nports by only the perpetrator, the victim, or both, so in-\ncluding reports of IPV by both partners would improve\nthe study design (Renner et al. 2015). Additionally, our\nanalysis is at the level of the individual, which limits our\nability to make temporal inferences about the experi-\nences of financial stressors and IPV perpetration. Since\nexposure to financial stressors may change over time,\nconducting an analysis at the event-level may be a better\nmethod of determining the relationship between finan-\ncial stressors and IPV perpetration. For example, a re-\ncent study of the association between anger and IPV\nperpetration asked participants to complete daily diaries\nof their affect and their experiences with their partner\n(Elkins et al. 2013). By collecting data every day, the re-\nsearchers were better able to determine the temporal as-\nsociation between the two factors. Another possible\nlimitation is related to our treatment of the financial\nstressor variables. Our analysis examined number and\ntype of financial stressors and did not examine patterns\nof stressors. As these stressors may occur simultan-\neously, additional research on the co-occurrence of mul-\ntiple forms of financial stressors and relationships of\npatterns of co-occurring stressors with IPV perpetration\nmay further enhance our understanding of these rela-\ntionships. Finally, our analysis used secondary data,\nwhich limited operationalization of constructs to the\nvariables collected in the study.\nConclusions\nFinancial stressors are associated with physical IPV\nperpetration, but the relationship between specific fi-\nnancial stressors and IPV perpetration varies by the\ntype of IPV perpetrated. These findings suggest inter-\nvention and prevention programs to reduce financial\nstressors may be a novel way to reduce future phys-\nical IPV perpetration.\nAppendix\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' conributions\nLMSR, CPA, and EP conceptualized the analysis and secured the Add Health\ndata.
