Fasting\nblood samples from all study participants were assayed for glucose, haemoglobin A1c,\ntotal\ncholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride. Serum Lp(a), ApoA-1\nand ApoB levels were measured using nephelometric assays; serum leptin was measured using an\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nResults: A total of 90 patients with cholelithiasis and 50 controls were included in the study.\nSerum levels of leptin, Lp(a), total cholesterol, triglyceride and ApoB were significantly increased,\nand levels of ApoA-1 and HDL-C were significantly decreased, in patients with cholelithiasis\ncompared with controls. Serum leptin in patients with cholelithiasis were significantly positively\ncorrelated with Lp(a) and ApoB and negatively correlated with ApoA-1.\nConclusions: Patients with cholelithiasis have higher leptin levels and an altered lipoprotein\nprofile compared with controls, with increased leptin levels being associated with increased Lp(a)\nand ApoB levels, and decreased ApoA-1 levels, in those with cholelithiasis.\n",

Cholesterol gallstones are induced\nby an imbalance of cholesterol metabolism\nthat involves changes in intestinal\nabsorption, hepatic biosynthesis and biliary\noutput of cholesterol and its conversion to\nbile acids.2,4 Gallstone risk factors include\nfemale sex, obesity, ageing, diabetes melli-\ntus, hypertriglyceridaemia, insulin resist-\nance, oestrogen therapy and ethnicity.2\u00ad4\nThe three major factors in the pathogenesis\nof cholelithiasis are gallbladder dysmotility,\ncholesterol supersaturation of the bile and\ncholesterol nucleation.2,3 Multiple associ-\nations between gallstones and dyslipidae-\nmia,4\u00ad6 coronary artery disease7 and stroke8\nhave been reported. Gallbladder disease has\nbeen shown to be associated with heightened\nfasting serum insulin levels in women.9,10\nHyperinsulinaemia increases hepatic\ncholesterol excretion and biliary cholesterol\nsupersaturation, and induces gallbladder\ndysmotility; insulin resistance has been\nshown to be associated with cholelithiasis\nin nondiabetic, nonobese individuals.11\nLeptin, a 16 kDa nonglycosylated\npolypeptide product of the ob gene, is an\nadipose tissue-derived hormone and is con-\nsidered to be one of the major regulators of\nfood intake and energy metabolism.12 It is\nsecreted from the gastrointestinal tract, with\nthe epithelium of the stomach being a major\nsource of leptin production.13 Leptin is\nstable in the stomach despite the acidic pH;\nfrom there it passes on into the intestine.\nLeptin receptors have been identified from\nthe duodenum to the colon in the basolateral\nmembrane of enterocytes and colonocytes,\nsuggesting a role for leptin in the gastro-\nintestinal tract.14 Leptin receptors have also\nbeen identified in the enteric nervous\nsystem.15 Leptin has been shown to modu-\nlate nutrient absorption, growth, inflamma-\ntion and gut motility.16 Abnormal leptin\nlevels and hyperinsulinaemia are important\nrisk factors for gallbladder disease.17,18 High\nplasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations and\nlow plasma high-density lipoprotein-choles-\nterol (HDL-C) concentrations have been\nassociated with a greater risk of gallstone\ndisease.4 Cholesterol saturation of the bile is\nheightened when the serum TG concentra-\ntion is high, whereas the serum concentra-\ntion of HDL-C is inversely correlated with\ngallstone prevalence and cholesterol satur-\nation of bile.4,19 The present study aimed to\ndetermine the relationships between serum\nleptin and levels of the lipoproteins lipopro-\ntein(a), apolipoprotein A-1 and apolipopro-\ntein B in patients with cholelithiasis.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients with gallstones attending the\nDepartment of General Surgery and the\nDepartment of Clinical Biochemistry,\nFaculty of Medicine, Dicle University,\nDiyarbakir, Turkey, between November\nthe study. Patients with acute cholecystitis,\nbiliary colic, acute infection of the biliary tract,\nhaemolytic disease, acute pancreatitis, viral or\nalcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease,\nendocrine, renal, lung or coronary heart dis-\nease and those following restrictive diets were\nexcluded from the study. Patients who had\npreviously undergone cholecystectomy due to\ngallstone disease at the same institution were\nalso recruited to the study group. Prolidase\nlevels were measured and planned to be\nreported elsewhere (not submitted yet).\nAs increasing age, female sex, obesity\nand prediabetes are risk factors for gallstones\nand have a major influence on lipid levels,\nand obesity is also a determinant of leptin\nlevels, a matching procedure was employed\nto avoid confounding. Patients with gall-\nstone disease were matched with controls\naccording to age, sex, body mass index (BMI,\ncalculated as body weight in kg divided by\nheight in m), fasting blood glucose and\nhaemoglobin A1c\n) levels using the\nfrequency matching method.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nEthics Committee of Dicle University\nFaculty of Medicine and all study procedures\nwere in accordance with the ethical standards\nfor human experimentation established by\nthe Declaration of Helsinki. All study par-\nticipants provided written informed consent.\nPatient assessment\nA medical history was obtained from\nall study participants and physical\nexamination, biochemical evaluation and\nupper abdominal ultrasonography were per-\nformed. The presence of intraluminal echo-\ngenicity with posterior acoustic shadowing\nwas considered to indicate gallstones. All\nultrasonographic studies were evaluated by\nthe same radiologist (A.B.).\nBiochemical assessment\nBloodsamples(10ml)weretakenfromallstudy\nfast and were immediately centrifuged for\nwas stored at \u00c070C until analysed. Glucose\nassayswereperformedusingstand-\nard laboratory methods. Serum levels of total\ncholesterol, HDL-C and TG were determined\nusing an Aeroset\u00d5 autoanalyser (Abbott\nLaboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).\nSerum levels of apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-\n1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were\nmeasured by nephelometric assays using anti-\nserum specific for ApoA-1 and ApoB (Dade\nBehring, Newark, DE, USA), respectively.\nThe serum leptin level was measured using an\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit\n(Leptin ELISA, DRG International,\nSpringfield, NJ, USA); the limit of detection\nwas 0.2 ng/ml. Lipoprotein-a (Lp[a]) was\nmeasured using a nephelometric agglutination\nassay (N Latex Lp[a] Reagent, Dade Behring).\nThe intra- and interassay coefficients of vari-\n(n \u00bc 10), respectively; the lower detection limit\nStatistical analyses\nResults were expressed as the mean \u00c6 SD.\nThe unpaired Student's t-test was used to\ncompare the cholelithiasis and control\ngroups. Pearson's correlation coefficient\nwas used to estimate the linear relation-\nships between the variables studied. A\nP-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-\ntically significant. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 software, ver-\nsion 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nmen) were included in the study. Of these,\nand 90 were patients with cholelithiasis\ncriteria, there were no statistically significant\ndifferences between the groups in terms of\nage, sex, BMI, fasting blood glucose or\nlevels.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\nof the study participants are given in Table 1.\nSerum HDL-C and ApoA-1 levels were\nsignificantly lower in patients with cholelith-\niasis than in healthy controls (P < 0.001),\nwhereas serum levels of total cholesterol, TG,\nApoB, Lp(a) and leptin were significantly\nhigher in patients with cholelithiasis than in\nIn patients with cholelithiasis, serum\nleptin levels were positively correlated with\nSarac\nlated with serum levels of ApoA-1\nDiscussion\nLeptin, a hormone produced by adipocytes,\nis known to have central effects on neuro-\npeptide Y and cholecystokinin, but its\ninfluence on the biliary effects of these\nhormones is unknown.20 Obese, leptin-defi-\ncient mice have large gallbladder volumes\nwith decreased contraction in vitro, and are\npredisposed to cholesterol crystal forma-\ntion.20 Administrating leptin to these mice\ncaused weight loss, restored gallbladder\nfunction, upregulated cholecystokinin A\nreceptors, acetylcholine b2 receptors and\nCa2\u00fe/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase,\nand downregulated 3-hydroxy 3-methylglu-\ntaryl coenzyme A reductase and low-density\nlipoprotein receptors.21 A previous study\nshowed that leptin-deficient obese mice had\ndecreased excitatory gallbladder muscle\ncontractile responses to acetylcholine,\nneuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin.20\nLeptin seems to potentiate the effect of\ncholecystokinin. Leptin signalling in vagal\nafferent neurons is required for appropriate\ncholecystokinin signalling and satiation.22\nDe Lartigue and coworkers23 showed that\nleptin resistance reduced the sensitivity of\nvagal afferent neurons to cholecystokinin,\nthus reducing the satiating effects of chole-\ncystokinin. In addition to regulating vagal\nafferent nerve discharge, cholecystokinin\ncontrols the expression of receptors and\npeptide neurotransmitters by these neurons;\nthese regulatory actions are potentiated by\nleptin and inhibited by ghrelin.24 Florian\nand coworkers16 showed that leptin modu-\nlated the activity of enteric inhibitory and\nexcitatory neurons in the proximal colon. As\nleptin seems to have a regulatory function in\ngastrointestinal motility, the present study\nevaluated leptin levels in patients with\ncholelithiasis and found that leptin levels\nwere increased in cholelithiasis compared\nwith controls. There were significant positive\nTable 1.

These findings\ncould be useful in understanding the patho-\nphysiology of cholelithiasis. The results of\nthe present study are consistent with those of\nprevious studies showing elevated leptin\nTG, ApoB and Lp(a) and lower HDL-C\nand ApoA-1 levels in patients with chole-\nlithiasis compared with healthy controls. In\ncontrast, some studies have reported no\ndifference in leptin18 and lipoprotein\ncompared with controls.\nMe\n\u00b4 ndez-Sa\n\u00b4 nchez et al.17 reported that\ninsulin resistance and the development of\ngallstone disease were associated with serum\nleptin levels in overweight subjects\n(BMI < 30 kg/m2), but not in obese subjects\n(BMI ! 30 kg/m2) with similar metabolic\nprofiles. Insulin resistance could have a\nmajor role in the pathogenesis of gallstones,\nfavouring the production of cholesterol-\nsupersaturated bile and altering gallbladder\nfunction. In another study, Me\n\u00b4 ndez-Sa\n\u00b4 nchez\net al.19 found a negative correlation between\nleptin and HDL-C levels. Duggirala et al.29\nFigure 1. Correlation between leptin levels and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels in patients with\ncholelithiasis.\nSarac\nreported that leptin levels correlated signifi-\ncantly with the incidence of gallstones in a\nlow-income Mexican\u00adAmerican population,\nespecially in women. However, Ruhl and\nEverhart30 found that the serum leptin\nlevel was not a better predictor of gall-\nstone disease than anthropometry. A signifi-\ncant and positive correlation between\nleptin levels and biliary cholesterol\nsaturation in obese subjects has been\n\u00b4 ndez-Sa\n\u00b4 nchez et al.17 found\na strong relationship between gallstone dis-\nease and the metabolic syndrome, which has\nthe cardinal feature of hyperinsulinaemia.\nThey also demonstrated the existence of\nrelationships between serum HDL-C, the\nbiliary cholesterol saturation index and\nserum leptin levels in obese subjects.19 In\nthe present study, lower HDL-C and\nApoA-1 levels but higher Lp(a) and ApoB\nlevels were observed in patients with chole-\nlithiasis compared with controls. Previous\nstudies have suggested that leptin promotes\nthe elimination of serum cholesterol by\nincreasing cholesterol secretion, decreasing\ncholesterol biosynthesis and increasing con-\nversion of cholesterol to bile salts, whereas\nobesity and the chronic effect of leptin\nresistance impair the function of biliary\nreported that leptin modulated obesity\nand regulated gallbladder genes related to\ncholesterol gallstone pathogenesis. Tran\net al.31 reported that hyperglycaemia, insulin\nresistance, hyperlipidaemia and body weight\nin obese mice with leptin dysfunction\nFigure 2. Correlation between leptin levels and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA) levels in patients with\ncholelithiasis.\nwere associated with poor gallbladder con-\ntractility, which in turn may contribute to the\nassociation between obesity and gallstone\nformation. They also found an inverse cor-\nrelation between gallbladder contractility\nand serum glucose, insulin, cholesterol, TG\nand body weight.31 Nakeeb et al.32 suggested\nthat insulin resistance alone might be respon-\nsible for gallbladder dysmotility, resulting in\ngallstone formation.
