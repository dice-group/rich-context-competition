The theory of planned behaviour has\nbeen actively cited in explaining health-related behaviour. This review evaluated the application of the theory of planned\nbehaviour to weight-loss behaviour. Among the three reviewed papers, cross-sectional survey designs and subjective\noutcome measurements were commonly applied. All of the studies recruited obese female adults as participants, limiting\nthe generalisability of the studies' findings. The theory of planned behaviour can be effectively applied in weight-reduction\nprogrammes targeting female obese patients. This review confirmed critiques citing the limitations of experimental\nstudies, the subjective measurement of behaviour and short follow-up periods.\n",

In addition, Ogden\nper cent\ngreater contribution to childhood and adolescent mortality\nrates than to the mortality rates of young and mature adults\n(Biro and Wein, 2010).Although attention has been drawn to\nthis global epidemic and to obesity-related health concerns,\nsome obese people experience difficulty in losing weight\nbecause of their failure to adhere to healthy diet and exercise\nrecommendations. Overweight and obese people who seek\nto lose weight must change their lifestyles to improve their\nenergy balance. Energy balance can be improved by engag-\ning in regular physical activity and avoiding energy-dense\nfoods with low nutrient content (Kremers et al., 2006; Rey-\nLopez et al., 2008). However, weight reduction through life-\nstyle modification has been difficult to foster in both\ndeveloped and developing countries (World Health\nOrganization, 2002). Studies have focused on weight-man-\nagement motivation and cognitive\u00admotivational factors such\nas beliefs, attitudes and perceptions, which have been found\nto influence the nutritional behaviour of obese people.\nBehavioural mediator constructs have been developed on the\nbasis of several conceptual theories such as the health-belief\nmodel (HBM), self-determination theory (SDT), social-cog-\nnitive theory (SCT), transtheoretical model (TTM) and the-\nory of planned behaviour (TPB). Theory-based models are\ndesigned to understand the cognitive psychology of a person\nwithin the context of that person's social environment as well\nas other constructs such as motivation and intentions (Nigg\net al., 2002). Theory-based interventions help people reflect\non their decisions and develop strong intentions to achieve\ntheir target behaviour (Baranaowski et al., 1997; Goldstein\net al., 2004). These theories provide different theoretical per-\nspectives on health-behaviour research. For example,\nthe HBM is described as a belief\u00adattitude theory because it\ncomprises core beliefs for predicting the likelihood of a\nPredicting actual weight loss: A review of\nthe determinants according to the theory\nof planned behaviour\nLouisa Ming Yan Chung1 and Shirley Siu Ming Fong2\n Keywords\nobesity, review, theory of planned behaviour, weight loss, weight reduction\n1The Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong\n2The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\nCorresponding author:\nLouisa Ming Yan Chung, Department of Health and Physical Education,\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Education, 10 Lo Ping Road, Tai Po, New\nTerritories, Hong Kong.\nEmail: chungmy@ied.edu.hk\nCritical Review\n2 Health Psychology Open \nbehavioural occurrence. The model proposes that the likeli-\nhood of a person performing a health-related action is moti-\nvated by a series of perceptions (e.g. perceived severity,\nperceived susceptibility, perceived threat or risk, perceived\nbenefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and cues to action).\nSCT is described as a competence-based theory because it\nspecifies the factors of a person required for acquiring com-\npetencies that can influence physical and emotional well-\nbeing and the self-regulation of health habits (Bandura,\n1998). Control-based theories such as the SDT concern the\npsychological needs for autonomy, competence and related-\nness. SDT suggests that the motivation of self-initiated\nbehaviour is based on the satisfaction of these basic psycho-\nlogical needs and support from the social environment (Ryan\nand Deci, 2000). The TTM is considered a decision-making\ntheory and suggests that health-behaviour adoption and\nmaintenance occurs at discrete stages within a process\n(Biddle and Nigg, 2000). SCTs such as the TPB, however,\nfocus on how likely it is that individuals intend to engage in\na behaviour. Intention is considered the ultimate mediator of\nbehaviour, and Armitage and Conner (2001) found that\nreported intentions were reliably and moderately correlated\nwith certain health actions.\nIn early studies examining health promotion and disease\nprevention, SCT was described and appraised as a more\ncomprehensive approach with a broader range of sociocog-\nnitive determinants compared with other theories such as\nthe HBM and TPB (Bandura, 1998). SCT is useful, but\nplaces emphasis on collective support, which is sometimes\nbeyond the control of an individual. This emphasis limits\nSCT application, especially in studies focusing on self-\ninfluence rather than a sense of support. The HBM's con-\nstructs are broadly used in health studies. However, the\nHBM is under conceptual critique; specifically, the opera-\ntional definitions of its constructs are not clear, making\ncomparison among studies difficult (Abraham and Sheeran,\n2005). Although this model can predict behaviour signifi-\ncantly, the effects are usually small (Sheeran and Abraham,\n1996). By contrast, the TPB was found to be economical\ncompared with the HBM, which has more constructs and\nitems stemming from its various constructs (Sutton, 1998).\nThe TPB facilitates explaining the determinants of a per-\nson's intention to change one's food choices and nutritional\nbehaviour (Contento, 2011). The TPB includes perceived\nbehavioural control (PBC) as a construct to accommodate\npeople's volitional control. However, controversies arise\nover the distinction between self-efficacy and PBC. Norman\nand Hoyle (2004) suggested that people with a strong sense\nof self-efficacy are likely to perform a target behaviour and\nused PBC as proxy measure of behavioural control over\nenvironmental constraints. Studies have related self-effi-\ncacy and PBC to exercise and dietary behaviours, support-\ning the separation of these two constructs (Armitage and\nTTM, which assumes that people move through discrete\nstages in the preparation and execution of behavioural\nchange, the TPB is regarded as a continuous model (Lippke\net al., 2005). The constructs of the TPB and TTM share\ncommon conceptual similarities and some of them overlap.\nFor example, the construct of attitude in the TPB was found\nto entail individual beliefs regarding decisional balance\n(Kosma et al., 2007), and the stage of change in the TTM is\nreflected by intention followed by behavioural change in\nthe TPB. Therefore, Yoo (2009) suggested that self-efficacy\nand attitude be integrated with PBC and decisional balance,\nrespectively. Nevertheless, the TPB's unique construct of\nsocial influence was found to be absent from the TTM\n(Yoo, 2009). Evidence shows that approximately two-thirds\nof 17 HBM-based interventions exerted significant impacts\non health behaviours (Abraham and Sheeran, 2005).\nRegarding the balance between advantages and disadvan-\ntages, the TPB seems to be more parsimonious and efficient\nin its use of constructs and, therefore, has been applied fre-\nquently in predicting health behaviour.\nTPB\nThe TPB is an extended form of the theory of reasoned\naction (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980) and was developed to\npredict behavioural change on the basis of cognitive com-\nlying actions and motivations for behavioural change by\nemphasising the value of establishing strong intentions\nthrough attitudes, normative beliefs and perceived control.\nDeterminants of changes in attitude, subjective norms and\ngreater perceived control predict intention and thereby\npromote health-related behaviour (Armitage and Conner,\niour a goal achieved by a group of participants. The media-\ntor of behaviour is intention, which is the perceived\nlikelihood that an action is performed to achieve a targeted\nbehaviour. According to the theory, attitude refers to a per-\nson's positive or negative judgement of the intended\napproach. A subjective norm is applied to the approval or\ndisapproval of the participant group to achieve the targeted\nbehaviour. Finally, a person's PBC provides evidence of\nhis or her control over the environmental barriers that\nrequire changing. These three mediators have been used to\ndetermine the potential contributing influence of certain\nestablished factors. For example, whereas behavioural\nbeliefs and outcome evaluation are bases for predicting\nattitude, normative beliefs and the motivation to comply\nare the foundations for projecting subjective norms, and\ncontrol belief is the major correlate to PBC. The TPB has\nbeen cited frequently (Ajzen, 2011) and widely adopted to\nexplain health-related behaviour such as smoking, mam-\nmography screening, voluntary HIV counselling and test-\ning, exercise, food choice, family meal frequency and fruit\nand vegetable intake (Abamecha et al., 2013; Carter-Parker\nChung and Fong 3\nGardner and Hausenblas (2005) critiqued the theory as\nunviable for predicting exercise and diet behaviour in a\ngroup of overweight women. Recently, the TPB, despite\nbeing applied in numerous correlational studies and indi-\ncating prospective associations between cognitions and\nbehaviour (Noar and Zimmerman, 2005), has been dis-\nmissed because of its limited predictive validity and utility\nin robust studies (Sniehotta et al., 2014). Through a sys-\ntematic review, McEachan et al. (2011) found that the\nstrongest TPB predictor was the construct of intention,\nwhich exhibited a variability of 19.3\nper cent regarding\nper cent variability, based on\n237 prospective studies, was considered low. Other criti-\ncisms addressed the TPB's `shortitudinal' instead of longi-\ntudinal designs in application, insufficiency in predicting\nbehaviour and small effect sizes of behavioural change,\nparticularly when the studies reported behaviour over a\nlong period (Sniehotta et al., 2014). In addition, self-\nreported outcome measures and rare experimental designs\nwere found (Sniehotta et al., 2014). These findings elicit\nconcerns over whether an intervention can be developed\naccording to the TPB and whether the theory can provide\neffective techniques for translating cognitive change into\nbehavioural change (Sniehotta, 2009). These findings also\nraise the question of whether the TPB can be applied in\ndesigning and developing intervention methods for weight-\nreduction programmes.\nBecause effective and sustainable weight loss stems from\na change in lifestyle, investigating whether the TPB facilitates\nweight loss is valuable to health psychologists. The TPB is\nnewer than other health theories. Because of increasing evi-\ndence regarding its effectiveness and ineffectiveness, identi-\nfying potential determinants of weight reduction in existing\nliterature is crucial. In preparation for clinical trials on how to\nachieve sustainable weight loss, this review evaluated recent\napplications of the TPB to weight-loss behaviour.\nMethods\nSearch strategies\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and\nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adopted in a\nsystematic and structural search of the literature (Moher\net al., 2009). We searched original research articles written\nin English and published between 1980 (when the TPB was\nfirst theorised and published by Ajzen and Fishbein) and\nMarch 2013. The databases used for the literature searches\nwere PsycINFO, Cochrane, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed\nand ScienceDirect. The search keywords included `weight\nloss', `weight reduction', `body mass index', `weight con-\ntrol' and `obesity'. Bibliographies of relevant studies were\nexamined to identify additional studies. A `grey' literature\nsearch of other databases such as Google Scholar was con-\nducted to identify additional relevant studies.\nSelection criteria\nFor inclusion in this review, studies were required to (1) be\noriginal, (2) use primary data sources, (3) apply interven-\ntions to determine the effects of the TPB on weight loss and\n(4) accept all age groups. Because this review focused on\nthe effect of TPB interventions on weight reduction, arti-\ncles having clear operational definitions for outcome vari-\nables relevant to weight reduction were included.\nDefinitions of outcome measurements, namely, body\nweight, body circumference, body fat percentage and BMI,\nwere included. Because this review focused on interven-\ntions based on the TPB framework, papers that used the\nHBM, the precaution-adoption process model and SDT\nwere excluded. Unpublished studies and conference papers\nwere also excluded because of the difficulties involved in\nlocating the full papers. To ensure the quality of this review,\nnon-peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded.\nReview analysis\nData extracted from studies applying the TPB as an interven-\ntion for weight reduction and meeting the aforementioned\ncriteria were tabulated for further analysis. The data extracted\nincluded the source of the study, study design, study sample,\noutcome measurements, instruments and results.\nResults\nIn total, 14 studies were identified through database searches\n(Figure 1). Studies that tested theories on binge eating\na hospital setting (Rodgers and Brawley, 1993) were\nexcluded. After manual screening, 11 papers were prelimi-\nnarily selected. One of these papers was ultimately excluded\nbecause it focused on the `maintenance of weight loss'\nrather than `weight loss or reduction' (McConnon et al.,\n2011). The paper also explored the cognition underlying\nweight regain, which was not the defined behaviour exam-\nined in this review. New extensions of the TPB, such as self-\nrepresentation, need perception and moral norms, have been\nadvanced by various studies (Abraham and Sheeran, 2000;\nfrom the scope of this review. In addition to its focus on\nneed perception as a new TPB extension, the study by Payne\net al. (2004) was excluded because it evaluated exercise and\ndiet adherence as behavioural outcomes and, therefore,\ndeviated from weight loss as a targeted outcome.Among the\nseven remaining studies, four related to obesity were finally\nexcluded (Table 1). In these four studies, obese or over-\nweight participants were recruited as participants. Plotnikoff\n(2013) identified physical activity as the targeted behaviour,\n4 Health Psychology Open \nand the TPB constructs that resulted were significantly asso-\nciated with physical activity levels among overweight and\nobese adolescents. Only the studies conducted by Gardner\na measured outcome. However, Gardner et al. examined\nexercise and healthy eating behaviour instead of the objec-\ntive parameters measured by BMI and the waist-to-hip ratio.\nAlthough Duangchan et al. (2010) applied BMI as a weight-\nloss measure, they did not consider the effect of the TPB on\nweight reduction, but rather evaluated the effect of physical\nactivity and a healthy eating intervention programme into\nwhich TPB constructs were incorporated.\nFinally, only three papers that fit the inclusion criteria\nfor exploring TPB construct correlations and targeted\nweight-reduction behaviour were found. The details on\nthese papers are summarised in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nAlthough the TPB has been heavily applied in studies that\npredict exercise and healthy eating habits, few of these\nstudies have addressed weight-reduction behaviour.\nHealthy eating and physical activity are considered key ele-\nments in weight loss. However, studies thus far have been\npredominantly cross-sectional rather than experimental. In\naddition, correlation analysis of the major determinants of\noverweight and obese groups (Gardner and Hausenblas,\napplied in investigating the associations of TPB constructs\nwith weight-loss behaviour. Although it was statistically\nreasonable to identify the correlates affecting the intention\nto lose weight, we found that it was questionable whether\nthese associations could help obese participants lose\nweight, especially when their behaviour was subjectively\nmeasured according to their level of physical activity or\nhealthy eating. Furthermore, few of the studies measured\nchange in body weight as a true behavioural outcome\nInstead, participants were asked to report their expected\nbody weight or their intended weight loss in the near future.\nThe determinants of attitudes, subjective norms, PBC and\nintention were analysed to predict the participants'expected\nbody weight, which could have been relevant to their\nimplementation plans.

This finding ech-\noed a recent challenge to the validity of the TPB regarding\nthe operationalisation of study measures (Sniehotta, 2009).\nCertain studies have analysed anthropometric variables\nyet their designs have been limited regarding the correlation\nof TPB determinants with weight status rather than weight\nreduction specifically. By contrast, the three studies we con-\nsidered in this review applied TPB determinants to explore\nthe differences in actual weight reduction during the\ndesigned experimental period or applied TPB determinants\nduring an intervention to test their effectiveness in weight\nreduction. The results of these studies'objective evaluations\nof body weight supported theoretical model testing.\nMajor weight-reduction determinants\nIn parallel with previous studies, PBC (Palmeira et al.,\nsupported as significant determinants of actual weight\nloss. However, we discovered a conflict regarding whether\nTPB attitudes contributed to actual weight loss. Schifter\nand Ajzen (1985) reported a poor correlation between atti-\ntude and final body-weight changes, whereas Palmeira\n(2007) found attitude to be associated with body-weight\nreduction. The high variance among individuals could\nhave accounted for these contrasting results (Armitage and\ntioned whether the various instruments used to measure\nattitude influenced the validity of the findings regarding\nweight reduction. Such misleading evidence has been\nreported by other studies; specifically, attitude, subjective\nnorms and PBC were highly predictive of intentions,\nwhich are correspondingly predictive of behaviour, in\ncross-sectional studies, but the assumptions have not been\nverified by experimental findings (Weinstein, 2007). This\ncritique prompts queries regarding whether weight-loss\nbehaviour corresponds with TPB assumptions and whether\nattitude is a major determinant in the execution of weight-\nreduction behaviour.\nGeneralisability of findings\nAll of the participants in the included studies were female.\nHence, we were cautious in interpreting their findings on\nthe effectiveness of applying the TPB in weight-manage-\nment programmes because their results were limited only to\noverweight and obese female adults. This factor certainly\nlimited their implications and restricted the generalisability\nof the findings to other populations, such as to obese male\nadults. In addition, sampling was not conducted using well-\ndeveloped protocols for reducing sample bias. A test of\nhomogeneity could not be found; the lack of such tests\naffects the extent to which this review substantiates the\nquality of the included studies. In addition, the sample sizes\nin the included studies were small with inadequate justifi-\ncation. This factor also hampered our interpretation of their\nfindings regarding weight-loss behaviour as a function of\nTPB attributes.\nLimitations and recommendations\nThe TPB emerged in the mid-1980s. Although its theoreti-\ncal framework has been influential in health-behaviour\nstudies, only a few studies have reported on the application\nof the TPB to weight reduction; the determinants reviewed\nhere may not be sufficiently thorough to evaluate the effec-\ntiveness of the theory in modifying the behavioural inten-\ntion of obese people attempting to lose weight. Scientific\nevidence regarding weight-loss behaviour has been rela-\ntively primitive (cross-sectional studies and self-reported\ndeterminants). Additional quantitative studies, such as ran-\ndomised controlled trials and longitudinal studies, are\nrequired to fill the current knowledge gap. In addition,\nmore studies that focus on populations other than obese\nfemales would enrich the applicability of the TPB to weight\nreduction. Only a representative inclusion of participants\ncan confirm the correlations of TPB constructs with weight-\nreduction determinants.\nConclusion\nThe TPB effectively explains the ability of PBC and possi-\nbly attitude to increase the intentions of obese females to\nachieve superior weight-loss results. This review also con-\nfirmed critiques citing the limitations of TPB experimental\nstudies, namely, the subjective measurement of behaviour\nand short follow-up periods.\nImplications\nThe TPB has been shown to be a useful theoretical frame-\nwork for much health-related behaviour. The determinants\nprovide strong correlations in predicting desirable behav-\niours. Because obesity is related to a few metabolic syn-\ndromes and chronic diseases, effective strategies to reduce\nbody weight are vital to promote. Interventions designed\nand developed on the basis of the TPB can increase effec-\ntiveness in achieving weight loss when the TPB shows a\npositive correlation with actual weight loss. In this review,\nthe authors found that the evidence provided by the included\nstudies is limited and cannot be generalised to the general\npopulation. In addition, the TPB would be more desirable\n8 Health Psychology Open \nfor designing weight-reduction interventions if study\ndesigns that are more robust were used.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nAbamecha F, Godesso A and Girma E (2013) Intention to volun-\ntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) among health pro-\nfessionals in Jimma zone, Ethiopia: The theory of planned\nbehavior (TPB) perspective.
