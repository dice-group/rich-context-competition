Although a number of authors have proposed that older volunteers should benefit in terms of better health and\nwell-being, few researchers have examined the issue empirically to see whether this is true. The purpose of this article is to\nbuild on this literature by empirically examining the association between volunteering and mortality among older adults.\nMethods. Using data from a nationally representative sample, we use Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the\neffects of volunteering on the rate of mortality among persons aged 65 and older.\nResults. We find that volunteering has a protective effect on mortality among those who volunteered for one organization or\nfor forty hours or less over the past year. We further find that the protective effects of volunteering are strongest for respondents\nwho report low levels of informal social interaction and who do not live alone.\nDiscussion. We discuss the possibility that the curvilinear relationship we observe between volunteering and mortality is\ndue to a combination of factors, including self-identity, role strain, and meaningfulness. Other research using more precise data\nis needed to determine whether these ideas are supportable.\nA DVANCES over the past century in health and longevity have\nA \\ left many older adults with a number of years of life follow-\ning retirement Although there is a great deal of heterogeneity in\nhow older adults spend their post-retirement years, several authors\n(e.g., Chambre, 1993; Herzog, Kahn, Morgan, Jackson, &\nWeitzman, 1988) have noted that many engage in volunteering or\nwork for voluntary organizations. If it is true that many older\nadults spend some of their time volunteering, then it may be the\ncase that the upcoming surge in the elderly population due to the\nbaby boomers hitting retirement age will yield a vast new crop of\nvolunteers. If federal and state governments continue to cut back\non spending for social welfare programs, this pool of volunteers\nmay become increasingly important to the overall maintenance of\nour society.\nIn addition to the societal benefits that accrue through volun-\nteering, such behavior might also have positive health effects\nfor volunteers. For instance, it has been suggested that elderly\nvolunteers should benefit from volunteering through increased\nlevels of life satisfaction and self-esteem, feelings of usefulness,\nand through the betterment of health (Hunter & Linn, 1980-81).\nMoreover, given that many older adults have exited the work\nrole through retirement, volunteering and other helping behav-\niors may act as a way to fill in for lost roles (Chambre, 1987;\n(1993) have termed this overall perspective \"inoculation.\" In\nexplaining the perspective, they state, \"volunteer work can in-\noculate, or protect, the older person from the hazards of retire-\nment, physical decline and inactivity\" (pp. 9-10).\nHowever, little research has examined whether voluntary ac-\ntivity actually promotes better health and well-being (Fischer &\nsupported the notion that volunteering is beneficial (e.g., Krause,\n1998), but data and analytical limitations of these studies have\ncompromised their ability to make statements about the relation-\nship between volunteering and well-being. One common prob-\nlem cited by multiple scholars (e.g., Chambre, 1987; Fischer &\ntangling causality. That is, because good health and availability\nof social resources lead to volunteering, it is difficult to deter-\nmine the causal ordering between well-being and that activity.\nThus, more research is needed to determine whether volunteer-\ning does indeed affect the lives of elderly adults in beneficial\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the relationship be-\ntween volunteering and mortality using data from a prospective,\nnationally representative data set. Our research expands upon ex-\ntant research that has linked various forms of social participation\nand integration to mortality (e.g., Berkman & Syme, 1979; Bryant\nRitter, & Burton, 1992; Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan,\n1997). By adjusting for several possible confounding factors, such\na prospective analysis of mortality overcomes the problems of po-\ntential reverse or reciprocal causation encountered in earlier stud-\nies of volunteering and well-being. Finally, based on the role con-\ntext perspective, we test hypotheses that the relationship between\nvolunteering and mortality is moderated by other measures of so-\ncial integration.\nTheoretical Overview\nWhy might volunteering affect the mortality rates of older\nadults? The most plausible explanation involves the utility of\nroles. It has been suggested that for older adults who have mostly\nor fully disengaged from the formal work sphere, volunteering\ncan become an important social role (Chambre, 1987). Evidence\nnot directly related to volunteering has indicated that engaging in\nmultiple roles can reduce the risk of mortality. In their study of\nroles and longevity among women, Moen, Dempster-McClain,\nand Williams (1992) used 30-year mortality follow-up data to\nshow that the number of roles engaged in byrespondentswas in-\nverselyrelatedto risk of mortality. Moreover, they found that the\nrole that had the strongest protective effect on mortality was that\nof being a member of a club or organization; consequently, they\nargued that \"while roles generally may contribute both stress and\nsupport to women's lives, participation in voluntary associations\nmay produce more benefits than costs\" (p. 642).\nMoen and colleagues (1992) delineate three commonly held\nperspectives on the nature of roles. Role enhancement argues that\naccumulated roles serve to enhance or increase power and status,\nwhich in turn translates into better health. Role strain claims that\ntoo many roles can place a burden on the individual, which in turn\nresults in worse health outcomes (see also Pearlin, 1983). Finally,\nthey cite the role context viewpoint, which takes into account the\nnumber ofroles as well as the setting and content of those roles.\nThese three perspectives can be applied profitably to the study\nof volunteering and well-being. It is generally believed that volun-\nteering provides role enhancement. That is, the additional volun-\nteer role should serve to increase feelings of power and status, and\nof meaning to oneself and to others. It might also be the case,\nhowever, that for older adults who suffer declines in function and\nability, the additional volunteer role could become a burden.\nIndeed, one might expect that those who volunteer in great\namounts or for numerous groups will not receive the potential\nhealth benefits of volunteering. In short, it is volunteering in mod-\neration that should be valuable for health and mortality outcomes.\nThe third role perspective discussed by Moen and colleagues\n(1992), role context, suggests that the effects of volunteering\nmay not be equally evident for all older adults. Given the impor-\ntance of social integration for mortality as described in previous\nviduals who are less well integrated into society (e.g., via mar-\nriage or contact with friends and family) might benefit most\nfrom volunteering. Likewise, persons who otherwise enjoy high\namounts of social integration may not receive many benefits\nfrdm volunteering in that they already receive through other\nmeans any benefits that may come from volunteering.\nHypotheses andModel Specification\nGiven the theoretical issues outlined above, we offer the fol-\nlowing hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1 Volunteering in modest amounts is associ-\nated with lower risk of mortality.\nHypothesis 2 Volunteering in large amounts is associated\nwith no differential risk or higher risk of\nmortality.\nHypothesis 3 The effect of volunteering on the risk of\nmortality is strongest among those who dis-\nplay low levels of social integration.\nThe central part of these hypotheses is tested by regressing\nmortality on volunteering and other control variables. We use\ntwo measures of the volunteering: range and amount. The other\ncontrol variables consist of a number of variables related to\nmortality and volunteering, including measures of physical ac-\ntivity, physical health, socioeconomic status, social integration,\nand demographic characteristics.\nMETHODS\nData\nData for this study come from the American's Changing\nLives (ACL; House, 1995) data set. The data are a multistage\nstratified area sample representative of the noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population aged 25 and older with aresponserate of 67%\nof sampled individuals and 68% for sampled households. The\nviews conducted in the respondents' homes. In order to facilitate\nsubgroup analyses by age and race, the data set contains an\noversample of Blacks and adults aged 60 and older. All the anal-\nyses reported here use weighted data in order to adjust for the\noversamples and biases due to nonresponse. The present analy-\nses focus on respondents aged 65 and older and use data col-\nlected in thefirstwave and the follow-up mortality data, yielding\na total unweighted sample size of 1,211. Because the ACL data\nwere collected using a complex sampling design, the variances\nof the estimates in theregressionmodels may be understated if\none assumes a simple random sample, as is done in most tests of\nstatistical significance. As such, we adjust for the sampling de-\nsign effects using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1997),\nwhich makes the necessary adjustments to the variances using\nTaylor series linearization procedures. There are very few cases\nwith missing data on the variables; for those with missing data,\nvalues were imputed based on other available information in the\ndata, or via substituting a modal, mean, or median value if such\nrelevant information was not available.\nMeasures\nMortality.--Deaths were ascertained through tracking and\ninterviewing processes and via the National Death Index from\nof 7.5 years. To date, the vast majority of the 403 deaths\n(90.3%) have also been confirmed through death certificates.\nReviews of reported deaths not yet confirmed by death certifi-\ncates suggest that all of these are almost certainly dead.\nVolunteering.--Respondents were asked whether they had\nvolunteered in the past year for any of the following groups: (a)\nchurch, synagogue or otherreligiousorganization; (b) school or\neducational organization; (c) political group or labor union; (d)\nsenior citizen group or related organization; and (e) other organi-\nzations. Respondents could have acknowledged volunteering for\nmore than one of these groups. We calculated the volunteering\nrange measure by summing the number of groups mentioned.\nBecause we are interested in how much volunteering respon-\ndents did rather than what type they did, we did not include in-\nformation about the type of groups for which people volun-\nteered. Respondents who said they had volunteered were also\nasked about how much time they had spent volunteering across\nall groups during the past year. Response categories for this\nsigned to represent each category in the volunteering range mea-\nsure. For the top category, a value of 200 was assigned.\nFrom our hypotheses we expect the greatest benefits of vol-\nunteering to come from modest amounts of that activity. Hence,\nwe coded the volunteering variables as dichotomous dummy\nvariable classifications. For range, the variables indicate volun-\nteering for (1) one group and (2) two or more groups. For\namount, the variables indicate volunteering (1) less man 40\nhours and (2) 40 or more hours. The reference category for\nboth sets of variables is no volunteering. It is important to note\nthat volunteering amount and range are highly correlated (r =\n.66) and, for that reason, are subject to multicollinearity prob-\nlems when assessing their effects in a multiple regression\nframework. To overcome this problem, we estimated the effects\nof each set of dummy variables in its own series of models.\nSocial integration.--Our first measure of integration, informal\nsocial interaction, is an index constructed by taking the standard-\nized mean of two items: (a) how often respondents talk on the\nphone with friends, neighbors, or relatives in the typical week; and\n(b) how often they get together with friends or relatives. The re-\nsponse categories for the first item range from (1) never to (6)\nmore than once a day, and for the second item they range from (1)\nnever to (6) more than once a week. Our second measure of social\nintegration indicates whether respondents lived alone. Such a\nmeasure is a better indicator of integration than marital status in\nthat it reflects the possibility that an older adult is married but that\nthe spouse lives in another setting and also the residential social\nintegration of unmarried persons. Respondents were coded one on\nthis variable if they reported living alone and zero otherwise.\nPhysical activity.--Our measure of physical activity is derived\nfrom three variables that measure how often (from [1] never to\n[4] often) respondents engage in (a) active sports or exercise, (b)\ngardening or yard work, and (c) taking walks. The index was cre-\nated by taking the standardized mean of the three items. For these\nanalyses, we have split the index into quintiles of roughly equal\nsize to accommodate the possibility of a nonlinear relationship.\nHealth.--Physical health status was measured using two vari-\nables. The first {functional impairment) is a functional health\nindex with a four-level Gutman-type scale that reflects the severity\nof physical impairment. Categories include (1) no limitation; (2)\ndifficulty walking a few blocks or climbing a fewflightsof stairs;\n(3) difficulty doing heavy work around the house (such as shovel-\ning snow or washing walls); and (4) being confined to a bed or\nchair. We dichotomized the scale such that respondents who re-\nport any impairment are coded one whereas those with no impair-\nment are coded zero. The second measure {potentiallyfatal condi-\ntions) is a tally of the number of possibly fatal health problems\nexperienced by respondents over the past year. Conditions include\nlung disease, heart attack, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.\nControls.--Other control variables include sex (female: 0 =\nmale, 1 = female), race (Black: 0 = non-Black [95.1% of whom\nare White], 1 = Black), age (age: in years, range 65-96), educa-\ntion (education: in years, range 0-17), and household income\n(income: coded as midpoints, 10 categories ranging from less\nhighest category). In earlier forms of the analyses we included\ncontrols for employment, formal social interaction, and self-\nrated heath. To simplify the models, we did not include them in\nthefinalanalyses. Doing so had no effect on the association be-\ntween volunteering and mortality.\nAnalyses\nTo assess the effects of volunteering and the other factors on\nmortality, we use hierarchical Cox proportional hazards models\n(Allison, 1995). First, we entered only the volunteering vari-\nables. Next, we controlled for demographic characteristics and\nthen for socioeconomic status. In the fourth model, we included\nmeasures of health and physical activity. In the final model we\nadded indicators of social integration. By regressing mortality\non the variables in this fashion, we can determine what factors,\nif any, tended to erode an otherwise significant zero-order rela-\ntionship between volunteering and mortality.\nTo test the interaction effects, we created cross-product terms\nbetween the volunteering variables and each of the social inte-\ngration measures, rendering two sets of two cross-product\nterms for each volunteering measure (i.e., range or amount).\nEach set of terms is entered into the full main effects model to\ntest the moderating effects in question. Following those tests,\nwe divide the sample by levels of social integration then regress\nmortality on volunteering and the other covariates. Such a strat-\negy allows us to determine the effects of volunteering at spe-\ncific levels of integration.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the independent\nvariables and zero-order correlations between those variables,\nvolunteering, and mortality. In the first two columns of the\ntable, we display the range and mean for each of the variables.\nNote that for the dichotomous variables, the mean indicates the\nproportion of people in the category coded one. For example,\n18% of the sample volunteered for one organization. Adding\nthe totals for the volunteering dummies, we see that about 35%\nof the total sample volunteered in the past year. This level of\nvolunteering among older adults is similar to that found by\nHodgkinson and Weitzman (1988). The mean number of hours\nvolunteered in the past year is somewhat low (27.7 hours) but\nreflects the high number of people who did not volunteer. In\nterms of the demographic and socioeconomic variables, a ma-\njority of the sample was female (60%) and non-Black (91%),\nthe mean age of the sample was about 73, the mean level of ed-\nucation was less than high school, and the mean income was\nabout $18,000. In terms of health, the mean number of fatal\nconditions was less than one, and a minority of respondents\n(40%) reported some functional impairment. Finally, a minority\nof the sample (29%) reported living alone.\nThe latter three columns of the table report the zero-order\ncorrelations between the independent variables and mortality\nand volunteering. In terms of volunteering, being Black and\nolder were associated with less volunteering. Consistent with\nother studies of volunteering (e.g., Wilson & Musick, 1997),\neducation and income were positively related to both volunteer-\ning range and amount. Respondents who reported better health\nand more physical activity also volunteered more. Similarly,\npeople who were more socially integrated volunteered more\nthan those who were not.\nLooking at the correlations with mortality, respondents who\nvolunteered over the past year were less likely to die over the\nfollow-up period; however, the pattern is curvilinear. That is,\nthe protective effects of volunteering were strongest among\nthose volunteering for one organization or for less than forty\nhours. The other associations with mortality in this table are not\nTable 1.

It is im-\nportant to note that the figures shown in this table are hazard rate\nratios; as such, coefficients greater than one indicate a greater haz-\nard rate for death whereas those less than one indicate a smaller\nhazard rate. Model 1 includes only the volunteering range vari-\nables. It shows that respondents who volunteered were at a re-\nduced risk for mortality. The strongest effect (i.e., the lowest haz-\nard rate ratio for mortality) occurred for those volunteering for\nonly one organization, again reflecting a curvilinear pattern.\nIn Model 2 we adjusted for the demographic factors. It is\nreadily apparent that the beneficial effects of volunteering de-\ncreased (i.e., hazard rate ratios became closer to 1.0) upon in-\nclusion of these variables, but the curvilinearity of the effect be-\ncame more clear: though the effect of volunteering for one\ngroup was still significant, the effect of volunteering for two or\nmore groups became insignificant. Age and sex both had strong\neffects in the usual directions. Separate analyses (not shown\nhere) indicated that although both age and gender decreased the\neffect of volunteering, the inclusion of age resulted in the\nlargest decrease.\nIn the third model, we included the socioeconomic variables.\nRecall from Table 1 that levels of volunteering activity were\nsharply graded by socioeconomic status. Consequently, we\nwould expect that the inclusion of these variables would also\ncurtail the volunteering effects. It was the case that the effect of\nvolunteering for one organization decreased, but this reduction\nwas small, with the effects of the other volunteering variable de-\ncreasing more. After incorporating measures of health and phys-\nical activity in Model 4, the effect of volunteering for one orga-\nnization decreased a small amount but still remained significant\nwhereas higher levels of volunteering produced a higher (i.e.,\n>1.0) hazard rate ratio for mortality. In terms of the other vari-\nables, higher levels of physical activity were associated with a\nlower mortality rate, and reporting more fatal conditions or\nsome functional impairment was associated with a higher rate.\nIn the final model, we included two measures of social inte-\ngration; the inclusion of these variables did little to affect the\nassociation between volunteering and mortality. It is surprising\nthat we found no significant effect for social integration given\nmortality studies done by other researchers that showed such an\nal., 1982). Note, however, that these studies were generally ge-\nographically limited, dealt mostly with younger populations,\nand did not include a measure of volunteering.\nTable 3 shows the mortality hazard rate ratios for volunteering\namount and the other control variables. The effects for volunteer-\ning amount were very similar to those for volunteering range:\nvolunteering in modest amounts (less than forty hours) had a pro-\ntective effect on mortality whereas volunteering for forty or more\nhours had no effect. However, the effect of volunteering for a\nmodest number of hours was not as strong as the effect of volun-\nteering for one organization. Indeed, although the effect of volun-\nteering less than forty hours remained significant throughout the\nmodels, it only remained marginally so in the last model.\nThe final part of our analyses tested our third hypothesis.\nBasically stated, we expected that the effect of volunteering on\nTable 2.

To test this hypoth-\nesis, we entered all of the variables in the full main effects mod-\nels and then included cross-product terms between the\nvolunteering variables and one of the social integration vari-\nables. Consequently, each of four models contained one set of\nvolunteering variables, control variables, and cross-product\nterms between volunteering and one social integration variable.\nIn order to save space, we do not report these results in tabular\nform in this article; they are, however, available from the authors\nupon request.\nFor informal social interaction, we found a significant mod-\nerating effect for volunteering for one organization. In line with\nour expectations, the coefficient revealed that the protective ef-\nfect of volunteering for one organization was strongest among\nindividuals who engaged in little informal social interaction (b\n= .63, p < .05). We further found that living alone had slight\nmoderating effects for volunteering for one organization (b =\n.67, p < .10) and volunteering for less than forty hours (b = .59,\np < 10). However, the direction of the effect was not expected:\nthe signs of the coefficients indicated that the effects of volun-\nteering were strongest among people who did not live alone.\nFinally, to determine whether the addition of the cross-product\nterms added to the overall fit of the models, we computed chi-\nsquare difference tests between the final additive effects models\nshown in Tables 2 and 3 and the models with the cross-product\nterms. Only the chi-square difference for the model for infor-\nmal social interaction and volunteering range cross-product\nthe only effect we will discuss further.\nBecause cross-product terms can often be difficult to inter-\npret, we divided the sample at the mean level of informal social\ninteraction and computed the effects of volunteering within\neach of those subgroups, adjusted for all of the control vari-\nables. Table 4 displays the results of these analyses. According\nto the hazard rate ratios shown in the table, the effects of volun-\nteering for one organization are strongest among respondents\nwho engage in low levels of informal social interaction. This re-\nsult is consistent with thefindingsfor the cross-product terms.\nTable 3.

Our results lend support to\nthis idea in that volunteers had a lower adjusted mortality haz-\nard than nonvolunteers. However, such a statement must be\nqualified in several ways.\nNot all volunteers were protected by that activity. Rather, vol-\nunteering only in moderate amounts produced a lower risk of\nmortality. These effects were strong in bivariate analyses but were\nattenuated upon the inclusion of demographic characteristics,\nsuch as age and gender. This curvilinear effect for volunteering\nsupports both the role enhancement and role strain perspectives.\nIn terms of the former, the findings indicated that simply adding\nthe volunteering role was protective of mortality. To gain the pro-\ntective effect, one did not have to volunteer to a great extent.\nIndeed, volunteering at higher levels provided no protective effect\nThis finding is consonant with the role strain hypothesis, which\nwould argue that for older adults, taking on too much volunteering\nactivity incurs just enough detriments to offset the potential bene-\nficial effects of the activity. We cannot, however, directly test with\nour data the major assumption of the role strain hypothesis: volun-\nteering for more than one group or for more than 40 hours during\nthe past year--which in most cases is between 40 and 80 hours--\nactually results in increased role conflict or additional work that\nconstitutes a burden. Future analyses should attempt to resolve\nthis issue with more specific data on the nature and experience of\nvolunteer work and other forms of productive activity.\nThe role context perspective also receives some support. That\nis, we found that the effect of volunteering on mortality differed\ndepending on the level of social integration of the respondent. We\nexpected that the protective effect of volunteering would be\nstrongest among those with lower levels of social integration.\nThat expectation was met for informal social interaction but not\nfor living arrangements. In the latter case, the protective effects of\nvolunteering were marginally strongest among respondents who\nwere living with others. In an effort to resolve this counterintu-\nitive finding, we computed several sets of analyses using alterna-\ntive interaction effects (e.g., with gender) to determine whether\nsome other factor was driving this pattern. We found no evidence\nthat other factors were responsible for the effect. Pending addi-\ntional and stronger replication of the result, we do not believe it\nshould be interpreted further.\nGiven that the effects of volunteering for one group were some-\nwhat stronger than those for volunteering for a few hours, we are\nled to ask several questions. First, are respondents who volun-\nteered for one organization different in some way than respon-\ndents who volunteered for more than one organization? To answer\nthis question, we computed mean levels of the other variables (i.e.,\ndemographics, socioeconomic status, health, social interaction) by\nthe number of organizations volunteered for. In these analyses\n(not shown here), we did not uncover any clear pattern of differ-\nences between respondents who volunteered for one organization\nand those who voluteered for more groups. It could be the case\nthat respondents who only volunteered for a single organization\nwere different from others in some way, but we are unable to tap\nthose differences here. It may also be the case that respondents\nwho volunteered for one organization had a stronger intrinsic in-\nterest in that organization than did respondents who volunteered\nfor multiple organizations. Given that we have partly rested our\nbelief that volunteering will be protective on Chambre's (1987)\nnotion that volunteering can provide meaningful social roles for\nolder adults, it may be the case that older adults who volunteered\nfor one group derived a more meaningful experience from that ac-\ntivity than multiple-group volunteers. Further, it might be the case\nthat simply being able to take on the identity of a volunteer is ben-\neficial for survival. If having the volunteer identity itself is impor-\ntant, but actually doing volunteer work is not as important, then\nwe would expect that the strongest effects of volunteering would\nbe in the lowest volunteering category. We cannot directly test the\nvalidity of these claims using the data available to us. Future re-\nsearch, however, should consider these possibilities.\nThe second question we must ask is whether respondents\nwho volunteered for one group actually performed different\ntypes of activity than did respondents who volunteered for mul-\ntiple groups. For example, it may be the case that single-group\nvolunteers were more likely to volunteer in ways that bring\nhigher prestige than were volunteers who worked for multiple\norganizations. The data available in the ACL provide measures\nof the types of organizations for which respondents could volun-\nteer; however, the data do not contain information on the types\nof work that were actually performed. Future research should\ntake the type of work into consideration when examining the ef-\nfects of volunteering on health. We did test whether the type of\norganization volunteered for had an effect on mortality, but we\nfound no evidence to support this idea.\nIt should be noted that many individuals in our sample who re-\nported volunteering did so for a religious organization (about\n69%). This distribution of volunteers raises the possibility that\nwhat may actually be responsible for the effects of volunteering\non mortality is association with a religious group. There is evi-\ndence that attending religious services is associated with mortal-\nity such that persons who attend more frequently derive protec-\ntive benefits from that activity (e.g., Hummer, Rogers, Nam, &\nEllison, in press; Strawbridge et al., 1997). In analyses not shown\nhere, we tested the possibility that the volunteering-mortality re-\nlationship was due to religion by recomputing the final main ef-\nfects model with a measure of religious service attendance. The\neffect of volunteering in this model was unchanged, indicating\nthat religious activity was not responsible for the effect\nhi sum, we found support for the idea that volunteering is\nbeneficial for older adults in terms of mortality. By using na-\ntionally representative data that contain measures of both vol-\nunteering and other important constructs, we were able to over-\ncome many of the limitations that hindered previous research.\nMoreover, because we focused prospectively on mortality as\nour outcome of interest, we avoided the problem of causal or-\ndering that has plagued many of the previous cross-sectional\nstudies in this area. Although our work is certainly not defini-\ntive, due in part to several of the limitations listed above, it does\nprovide more evidence that social participation in later life may\ncontribute to successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998).\n"
