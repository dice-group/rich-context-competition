    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nA number of studies suggest that OLGs (oligodendrocytes),\nthe myelinating cells of the central nervous system, are also\na source of trophic molecules, such as neurotrophins that\nmay influence survival of proximate neurons. What is less\nclear is how the release of these molecules may be\nregulated. The present study investigated the effects of\nBDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) derived from\ncortical OLGs on proximate neurons, as well as regulatory\nmechanisms mediating BDNF release. Initial work deter-\nmined that BDNF derived from cortical OLGs increased the\nnumbers of VGLUT1 (vesicular glutamate transporter 1)-\npositive glutamatergic cortical neurons. Furthermore,\nglutamate acting through metabotropic, and not AMPA/\nkainate or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), receptors\nincreased BDNF release. The PLC (phospholipase C) pathway\nis a key mediator of metabotropic actions to release BDNF\nin astrocytes and neurons. Treatment of OLGs with the PLC\ntrimethylbenzenesulfonamide] induced robust release of\nBDNF. Moreover, release elicited by the metabotropic\nreceptor agonist ACPD [trans-(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopen-\ntane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid] was inhibited by the PLC\n(inositol triphosphate 3)\nreceptor inhibitor 2-APB (2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane)\nand the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-\n(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N9,N9-tetra-acetic acid tetra-\nkis(acetoxymethyl ester)]. Taken together, these results\nsuggest that OLG lineage cells release BDNF, a molecule\ntrophic for proximate neurons. BDNF release is regulated by\nglutamate acting through mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate\nreceptors) and the PLC pathway. Thus glutamate and BDNF\nmay be molecules that support neuron\u00adOLG interactions in\nthe cortex.\n",

As\nsuch, they play an important role in increasing the\nconduction velocity of the action potential by forming\nmyelin sheaths, and thereby promoting saltatory conduction\ndown the axon. In recent years, however, OLG lineage cells\nhave begun to be appreciated as an important source of\ntrophic factors. For example, growth factors such as GDNF\n(glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), IGF-1 (insulin-like\ngrowth factor-1), TGF-b (transforming growth factor-b) and\nothers are expressed by OLG lineage cells in culture (da Cunha\nCorrespondence can be addressed to either author (email dreyfus@umdnj.edu or bagayois@umdnj.edu).\nAbbreviations: ACPD, trans-(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-\nN,N,N9,N9-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; BF, basal forebrain; CC, corpus callosal; CNS, central nervous system;\nDCG-IV, (2S,29R,39R)-2-(29,39-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine; DHPG, (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; GDNF,\nglial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IP3\n, inositol trisphosphate; MCPG, (S)-a-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; MEM, minimal\nessential medium; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; m-3M3FBS, N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonamide; NM-15, nutrient medium-15;\nNMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; NSFM, neuron serum-free medium; NT, neurotrophin; OCM, oligodendrocyte-derived conditioned medium; OLG, oligodendrocyte; OSFM, OLG\nserum-free medium; PLC, phospholipase C; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2; VGLUT1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1.\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nStudies in our laboratory and others have revealed that NTs\n(neurotrophins) are also OLG lineage cell-derived (Byravan et\n(nerve growth factor), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic\nfactor) and NT3 mRNAs are expressed by BF (basal forebrain)\nand CC (corpus callosal) OLGs, as well as OLGs in the frontal,\ncingulate and parietal cortical regions at postnatal ages in\nvivo. NT proteins and mRNAs are associated with BF OLGs in\nby BF OLGs enhance the survival and function of BF\ncholinergic neurons (Dai et al., 2003). Thus the results\nsuggest that OLG-derived NTs are trophic for nearby neurons\nin the CNS.\nWhat is not as clear is how release of the NTs may be\nregulated. We suggest that neurotransmitters may play a role.\nOLGs express a number of neurotransmitter receptors and\nOLG function and development are influenced by neuronal\nal., 2007). Of particular interest to us is that glutamate\nreceptors are present on OLG lineage cells (Yoshioka et al.,\nthat such receptors may regulate trophin content. For\nexample, glutamate increases BDNF release in hippocampal\nneurons and in glial cells, such as astrocytes, Schwann cells\nbecause it is a factor that influences neuronal survival,\nproliferation and differentiation (Alderson et al., 1990;\nal., 2007). Regulation of release of this factor by OLGs,\ntherefore, may have important roles on proximate neurons.\nIn the present study, we investigated the possibility that\nglutamate signals may influence BDNF release from cortical\nOLGs. We report that OLG-derived BDNF increases numbers of\nVGLUT1(+) (where VGLUT1 is vesicular glutamate transporter\n1) glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, glutamate, through the\nactivation of metabotropic receptors and the PLC (phospho-\nlipase C) pathway, increases BDNF release by OLGs.\nExperimental animals\nTime-mated Sprague\u00adDawley rats (Hilltop Laboratories) were\nhoused in clear plastic cages with corncob bedding and\nnestlets. Food and water were available ad libitum. The\nanimals were managed by the UMDNJ/Robert Wood Johnson\nAnimal Facility, which is accredited by AAALAC (the\nAssociation for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory\nAnimal Care). Animal transportation, maintenance, husbandry\nand housing were in compliance with the Laboratory Animal\nin compliance with the National Institutes of Health guide-\nOLG-enriched cultures\nOLGs were purified using a modification (Gallo et al., 1996) of\nthe method of (McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980). Postnatal day 1\nrat pups were killed by hypothermia-induced anaesthesia\nfollowed by exsanguination. The frontal, parietal and\ncingulate cortices were dissected, mechanically dissociated\nand plated on to 75 cm2 flasks precoated with poly-D-lysine\n(0.1 mg/ml). The dissociated cells were cultured in NM-15\n(nutrient medium-15), containing MEM (minimal essential\nmedium) with Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Cellgro),\nsupplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine\nserum, penicillin/streptomycin (0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml\nrespectively) and glucose (6 mg/ml). Cells were maintained at\nhumidified incubator for 12\ndays. Fresh NM-15 was added every 3\u00ad4 days. At the end of\nat 250 rev./min in order to remove supernatant containing\nOLG lineage cells and microglia. To further purify the OLGs,\nthe supernatant was plated on to uncoated 150 mm\npolystyrene dishes at room temperature (22\u00b0C) for 90 min\nfor microglial attachment. OLG lineage cells remaining in the\nsupernatant were collected, centrifuged at 1000 g at 22\u00b0C for\n10 min, and plated on to 10 cm poly-D-lysine-coated dishes\nNM-15. NM-15 was then replaced with OSFM (OLG serum-\nfree medium) for 5 days, comprising a 1:1 mix of Ham's F12\n(Gibco) and BME (basal medium Eagle; Invitrogen), penicillin/\nstreptomycin (0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml respectively), insulin\nprogesterone (20 nM), selenium (30 nM) and glucose (6 mg/\nml) plus thyroxine (0.5 mM), triiodothyronine (0.08 mg/ml) and\nglutamine (1.5 mM). Cultures were highly enriched consisting\nof 91% OLG lineage cells with the remaining cells comprising\nED1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes.\nNeuronal cultures\nE17 (embryonic day 17) fetuses were obtained from time-\nmated Sprague\u00adDawley rats.

The cultures were\nthen incubated with OSFM for 5 days. To evaluate the effect\nof OCM on neuronal cultures, OSFM (1 part OSFM/1 part\nNSFM) or OCM (1 part OCM/1 part NSFM) was added to the\ncultures for 5 days. To specifically evaluate the role of BDNF\nin OCM, a neutralizing anti-BDNF antibody (Promega) was\npre-incubated for 2 h (at 4\u00b0C) with OCM before adding the\nmixture to neuronal cultures.\nCulture treatments\nBefore drug treatment of cultures, OLGs grown in OSFM for 5\ndays were washed twice with PBS. MEM (5 ml) was added to\neach of two dishes (10 cm diameter), which were combined\nfor each control and treatment group. When cultures were\ntreated with antagonist, the antagonist or vehicle was added\nin OSFM for the time specified. The agonist was then added\nalone or with antagonist in MEM for 10 min.\nTreated and control media were collected and concen-\ntrated to 50 ml at the same time and in an identical manner,\nusing Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Devices 5 kDa (Millipore) or\nis molecular weight cut-off). BDNF levels were evaluated by\nELISA or Western blot analysis. Owing to the variability within\nthe controls of individual experiments, each treatment\ncondition was compared with its own control within the\nsame experiment.\nELISA\nELISA was performed using the BDNF Emax ImmunoAssay\nSystem kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol.\nWestern blot analysis\nBDNF release\nMedia from ACPD [trans-(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-\ndicarboxylic acid]- or vehicle-treated OLGs were collected\nand concentrated as indicated above.

OLGs were harvested and lysed in buffer\ncontaining EDTA (10 mM), EGTA (2 mM), SDS (0.1%), CHAPS\nml), soyabean trypsin inhibitor (20 mg/ml), NaF (50 mM), PMSF\ndebris was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected.\nThe protein concentration was determined using the BCA\n(bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).\nProteins were subjected to electrophoresis using a 12%\nNuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and transferred as described above. The\nmembrane was stained with an activated anti-(caspase 3)\nantibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) and protein was\ndetected using ECL. To normalize for loading, the same blots\nwere stripped and evaluated for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase) protein levels using an anti-\nGAPDH antibody (1:1000; Biodesign).

Moreover, BDNF derived from BF\nOLGs enhances the survival of proximate neurons (Dai et al.,\n2003). To determine whether BDNF derived from cortical\nOLGs has similar actions, we evaluated the effects of OCM on\nthe numbers of VGLUT1(+) neurons.

To evaluate whether regulated release occurs\nin OLGs, cortical OLGs were treated for 10 min with\nglutamate (100 mM) and BDNF in the medium was assayed.\nLevels of BDNF were elevated in the medium (Figure 2B),\nindicating that glutamate may regulate the release of BDNF\nfrom OLGs.\nmGluRs mediate BDNF release\nGlutamate acting though ionotropic receptors mediates\nBDNF release from Schwann cells (Verderio et al., 2006)\nand, through mGluRs and ionotropic receptors, may\nmediate release from neurons and astrocytes (Canossa et\ndetermine which glutamate receptor may mediate release\nin OLGs, we first evaluated the receptors present.

Receptor subunits of kainate\nand AMPA, as well as NMDA receptors, were detected\n(Figure 3A). Moveover, both Group I (mGluR1 and 5) and\nGroup II (mGluR 2/3) mGluRs were identified on the cells\n(Figure 3B).\nTo determine which receptors may influence OLGs, cells\ngrown for 5 days in OSFM were treated for 10 min with\nagonist that stimulates Group I and Group II mGluRs. Neither\nkainate nor NMDA had any effect on BDNF release as\ndetermined by ELISA (Figures 4A and 4B). However, ACPD\nincreased the amount of BDNF secreted into the medium\nwithin 10 min of stimulation (Figure 4C). Similar results were\nobtained by Western blot analysis (Figure 4D), suggesting\nthat in cortical OLGs, metabotropic, but not ionotropic,\nglutamate receptors mediate release.\nTo further confirm mediation by mGluRs, the effects of\nMCPG, a Group I and Group II metabotropic antagonist, was\nevaluated.

Activation of PLC induces the cell membrane\nhydrolysis of PIP2\n(phosphatidylinositol biphosphate) into IP3\nand DAG (diacylglycerol).

Moreover, in\nreceptor inhibitor 2-APB (150 mM), and the intracellular\ncalcium chelator BAPTA/AM (80 mM) ACPD-induced increases\nin extracellular BDNF were blocked (Figures 6B\u00ad6D), suggest-\ning that the PLC pathway is a critical mediator.\nACPD or glutamate treatment does not activate\ncaspase 3 or affect cell number\nGlutamate has been reported to be toxic to OLGs. The degree\nof toxicity depends on the OLG population being evaluated,\nthe length of glutamate exposure and the receptor subtype\nbeing activated. AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors have\nbeen shown to mediate these toxic effects (Sanchez-Gomez\nTo rule out the possibility that the release of BDNF is due to\ntoxicity, OLGs were treated with glutamate, ACPD or vehicle\ncontrol for 10 min and activated caspase 3 levels were\nevaluated at 24 h post-stimulation.

In\ncontrast, staurosporine, known to activate caspase 3 and used\nas a positive control, did activate caspase 3 (Figures 7A and 7B).\nIn other studies total cell numbers were determined 24 h\npost-stimulation. No changes were observed among the\ndifferent treatment groups (Figure 7C), suggesting that the\nexperimental conditions used in the present study do not kill\nthe OLGs.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study indicates that cortical OLG-derived BDNF\nprovides trophic support to proximate neurons in culture. As\nsuch, it complements previous work indicating that cortical,\nCC and BF OLGs contain BDNF mRNA in vivo and that BF OLGs\nrelease BDNF that supports proximate BF neurons (Dai et al.,\n2003). Moreover, the present study demonstrates that the\nrelease of BDNF is regulated by glutamate in a process\nmediated by metabotropic receptors and the PLC pathway. It\nis known that OLGs express a host of other growth factors in\nvivo and in vitro (da Cunha et al., 1993; McKinnon et al.,\nFigure 5 Group I, but not Group II, mGluRs mediate BDNF release\n(A) DHPG (100 mM) induces BDNF release into the medium after 10 min stimulation, as determined by ELISA (n56). *P,0.05,\nsignificantly different compared with the control.

Although ionotropic receptors are present on the\nOLGs, they do not appear to mediate release since neither\nstimulation with kainate nor NMDA elicited release.

These studies complement others using\nneurons and astrocytes which suggest that, in other cells,\nglutamate and mGluRs are involved in the release of several\nfactors, including neurotrophins (Bruno et al., 1998; Ciccarelli\nwhere it was studied, release of BDNF through mGluRs was\ndependent on the PLC pathway and the mobilization of\nCortical OLGs are reported to express a variety of vesicular\nwhich are developmentally regulated and may play a role in\nthe regulation of myelin assembly (Larocca and Rodriguez-\nHowever, the presence of these proteins in OLGs in the\npresent study suggests that they may also be capable of\ncontrolling the regulated secretion of BDNF seen previously in\nneurons and glial cells (Canossa et al., 2001; Hartmann et al.,\ndetermined whether BDNF is associated with these or any\nother vesicular proteins in OLGs, VAMP2, secretogranin II and\nchromogranin A are associated with BDNF storage, trafficking\nand release. For example, BDNF was found to co-localize with\nchromogranin A in transfected AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary\ncell line (Goodman et al., 1996), and with secretogranin II in\nSchwann cells (Verderio et al., 2006) and astrocytes (Bergami\net al., 2008) BDNF release is inhibited by tetanus toxin,\nillustrating a VAMP2-dependent mechanism. Interestingly,\nhowever, in Schwann cells glutamate induces release in a\nprocess dependent on ionotropic glutamate receptors\n(Verderio et al, 2006), suggesting differences in BDNF release\nin peripheral compared with central glia, although the role of\nmetabotropic receptors was not examined.\nSignificance for the neuron\u00adglia interaction in\nvivo\nPrevious studies indicate that BF OLG-derived conditioned\nmedia applied to the BF cholinergic neurons enhances\nsurvival and function of these cells (Dai et al., 2003).

The\npresent study extends this observation to the cortex, by\nshowing that cortical OCM applied to embryonic cortical\nneurons increased the numbers of VGLUT1(+) glutamatergic\nneurons, a result also dependent on BDNF. Others have\nimplicated OLG-derived GDNF and IGF-1 as having similar\nOLGs from multiple brain regions may provide support to\nproximate neurons.\nAlthough these studies have been performed in culture,\nthey may have bearing on situations in vivo. OLGs and their\nassociated neurons are affected in a number of degenerative\ndiseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease\nthe cross-talk between neurons and OLGs remain poorly\nunderstood.

Our finding that OLGs may provide\ntrophic support to their nearby neurons through the actions\nof NTs and neurotransmitters suggest another mechanism\nthat may underlie this interaction. BDNF is an important\nmodulator of survival and development (Alderson et al., 1990;\n2007) and mGluRs are protective to both neurons and OLGs\net al., 2004). Continued understanding of this glutamate\u00ad\nBDNF cross-talk may provide an approach with which to\nenhance the viability of both OLG and proximate neurons\ndamaged in a host of degenerative diseases of the CNS.\n"
