    "abstract": "Abstract\nBoth science and the arts have largely disregarded cookery in their quests for the sublime and the beautiful; this article seeks\nto explicate why cookery has been excluded as a subject of analytical and aesthetic interest. By reexamining the particular\nsacredness attached to culture over time, this article outlines how processes of mastering spirit and knowledge go beyond\nphysiology and physical senses (i.e., taste and smell). Fundamental causes for the decline of an established value order, which\nalso gradually shifted the status of cookery, are identified. The development of food-related art and wisdom is considered\nin the context of the end of the cult of culture in its commonsense usage. This essay approaches food and the art of its\npreparation as an epistemological, aesthetic question, as well as an example for illustrating the decomposition of one value\nsystem and the foundation of another; it also details the new opportunities this transformation creates.\n",

Unlike painting, theater, or\nphilosophy, cookery does not suffer from a lack of apparent\nutility, yet at the same time, it goes beyond its central,\nmomentary, and self-evident purpose to encapsulate a con-\ncurrent status as an image, a notion, and an idea. By serving\nas a toy and indicator of accurate memory, both individual\nand collective, food appears within the class of origin myths\n(Gray, 2011). Old cookbooks offer mythological material,\nwith instructive correlations of (omni) knowledge about\nbeing alive; although they preserve ancient lessons and tradi-\ntions, such readings do not belong to the domain of tradi-\ntional wisdom. Whether written down or shared through\nvocal transmissions, the art and being of nutrition are phe-\nnomena capable of unconscious, transgenerational transmis-\nsions, and they determine both who we are and what we are\nlike, revealing perhaps more than we want them to and more\nthan we realize. As Tony Judt (2010) realized, \"We Are What\nWe Eat\" (p. 31), a slogan known in antiquity and Hindu\nteachings as a literal caution; today, the phrase is a subject of\na wider interest and argumentation, encompassing the impact\nof consumer habits on building identities (see also Foulston,\na life and a rare truth that cannot be forged. By moving beyond\nalimentary biographies, bibliographies, or edible memories,\nnutrition indicates identity and becomes a true reflection of\npeople's being, views, and experience. The resulting percep-\ntion or story does not require interpretation, because it can-\nnot deceive or lie but is self-evident and self-sufficient.\nFurthermore, it offers an inexhaustible source of research.\nFood has been the subject of biology, chemistry, and anthro-\npology studies that seek the most accurate representation of\nhumanity (Judt, 2010). In historical terms, food is a key term,\nbecause it represents the foundation not only of civilizations\nbut also of their boundaries, such that it has prompted most\nof the changes in a society, provided measures of economic\ngrowth, and indicated social fragmentation (Holtzman,\n2006). In this sense, the history of food is actually the history\nof the world, in that we can regard magistra vitae from the\nperspective of food development and its impact on the\nappearance of the magistra (Standage, 2010). In addition to\nbeing a driving, cohesive force, the key function of food in\nthe history of humankind has been largely performative.\ninvisible hand of the market,\" Standage (2010) speaks about\nfood through a metaphor of \"invisible fork\" that changes the\nfate of humankind, which is unaware of the main cause of\nthat change (pp. 14-15). In inducing divisions and struggles\n1Institute for European Studies, Belgrade, Serbia\n2University of Dubai, United Arab Emirates\nCorresponding Author:\nGordana eri, Senior Research Associate, Institute for European Studies,\nEmail: gordanadjeric9@gmail.com\nFrom Basic Instincts to Art Performance:\nValue Shifts in the Treatment of Cookery\nGordana eri1 and Laurent Tournois2\n Keywords\ncookery, culinary art, performative history of food, gastronomy, value shift\n2 SAGE Open\nfor power throughout all historical periods, food continually\nrepresents a backdrop for all other contests and struggles.\nThe history of the world, as we know it, thus is inextricable\nfrom the history of food. More than any other fear, fears\nabout a lack of food are easy to manipulate and effective\nroutes to conquest. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (2002)\nprovided remarkably early insights into the importance of\nnutrition, claiming that the destiny of a nation depends on a\ntype of food it has chosen. Despite offering an effective plat-\nform for the physiology of taste, his early 19th-century work\nremained on the margins of learning until recently. Yet\nBrillat-Savarin essentially established the scholarly disci-\npline, unrecognized in his time, of transcendental gastron-\nomy. Soon thereafter, Nietzsche (1888) conditioned the\nsalvation of humankind on its nutrition, suggesting that the\nslavery of ideology that confined people could best be mea-\nsured by their inability to conceive of alternatives, such as in\ntheir food selections.\nAs an insatiable desire and driving force, food also consti-\ntutes a passion, reflecting instinct. In recent years, it has come\nto represent either salvation or catastrophe, such as when it is\nproposed as a cure or the cause of virtually any disease. Any\nmanipulation of food, whether collection, cultivation, prepara-\ntion, or consumption, represents a cultural act (Montanari,\n2006)--more than merely knowledge or merely discourse or\nmerely culture or merely need, though it also is all of those\nthings simultaneously. Traditional approaches forget, or\nignore, that food entails both primary enjoyments and elemen-\ntary values, such as emotional and energy values. However, by\nvulgarizing food perceptions, the clich\u00e9 view of needs has\ngreatly and negatively affected human self-perceptions.\nGuided by the language of needs and necessities, or things\nwe cannot live without, the only acceptable definition states\nthat human survival necessitates food. Such a view has deter-\nmined the shape of the world, whose history--regardless of\nperspective--demonstrates the great influences of both hunger\nand love, as initially established by Freud (1930) and his\nViennese colleagues. In studies that focus systematically on the\nstudy of instinct and gratification, far more progress has been\nmade in investigating the skills and techniques related to the\npreparation of food than in parallel research into sexology\n(Zeldin, 1995). In this narrow assessment, the origin of civiliza-\ntion emerged not just from the conjugal bed but by the emer-\ngence of cooking--the mother of humankind, such that one\ntheory holds that primates became human approximately two\nmillionyearsago,whentheypreparedthefirstmeal(Wrangham,\n2009). Comparable with Darwinian theory in its provocative-\nness and comprehensiveness, Wrangham's theory identifies an\ninitial stage of society as the family, which used the art of living\ntogether in organization around a fire and roasting the items that\nhad been hunted and collected. Cooking has made us the people\nthat we are today, claims the author, it steered us toward civiliza-\ntion, initiated the evolutionary leap, and transformed necessity\ninto artistry, a herd into a group that enjoys meals together. How\nand whether cookery is equivalent to other arts and sciences,\nand why humankind has taken so long to recognize the activ-\nity as such, constitute the central research questions for this\narticle. We adopt a historical perspective, such that the debate\nappears ingrained with issues of values and our inconsistent\nrelation to those values over time. In this sense, we use\nPerroux's (1943) terminology, which defines values as state-\nments or objects that have been assigned importance.\nPhenomena of value correspond to (comparative) judgments\nabout the importance of goods and are based on individual\npreference scales. These phenomena of value can be found in\nany economic system.\nThe Long Prehistory of the First\nRevolution\nAn overemphasis on the corporeal and organic, focused on the\nnose, mouth, tongue, and digestive system, has degraded the\nculinary realm for centuries. In contrast, the process of master-\ning the spirit and knowledge disregarded or conflicted with\nnotions of physiology. In a quest for an absolute, the owners of\nwisdom and guardians of metaphysical knowledge bypassed\ntrivial, necessary, and commonplace ideas, such that scholarly\nand aesthetic inquiry ignored instincts and urges. Theories of\nart and epistemology were associated only with hearing or\nsight. In the name of progress and civilization, culture built a\nwall against biology. For centuries, preferences centered on\nthe pleasures of contemplation and continence rather than an\nimmediate, widely available enjoyment. Because no insights\ninto these spheres and their mastery was available, it became\nimpossible for them to attain cultural status.\nWith its apparent and simple purpose, food became pri-\nmarily associated with consumption and satiety, similar to\nhow the sexual act came to be understood through orgasm or\nreproduction, that is, through its function. Indolence and\ncontemptuous attitudes emerged from the social and human-\nistic schools of thought toward biology and instinctive senses\nof taste and smell, as indirectly reflected in a vulgar, func-\ntionalistic perception of food consumption. For many years,\ncookery did not have its place in traditionally viewed aes-\nthetics. Furthermore, traditional theorists failed to recognize\nthe evident, fundamental artistic principles culinary acts,\nwhich include creation aimed at experience (not just reading,\nlistening, or seeing); unity in action, place, and time; and dis-\ntinctive performativity principles, in the sense that the culi-\nnary act transforms not just states and feelings but the body\nas well.\nBecause it is apparent, utilitarian, and broadly under-\nstandable, the art of cooking does not generally produce\nambiguity; in contrast, classical arts have relied on principles\nsuch as an unclear purpose, distinctiveness, flow of time,\nabstractness, demands, or incomprehensibility except to an\nexclusive minority.\nClosely related to biological needs and temporally coded,\nthe necessary act of cookery had been painfully and slowly\nbecoming a subject of focused analytical or aesthetic research,\neri and Tournois 3\nperhaps also because it reminded the anthropocentric schol-\nars of the unpleasant human proximity to animals. Finally,\nthe opposition to perceiving the art of cooking emerged from\nefforts to preserve the prohibitions and cult of culture, which\nentail dependence on conventional or dominant orders in the\norganization of knowledge and skills, leading to a lack of\nability to realize or recognize alternatives. Bound by self-\ninterest, no existing order can approve of originality, even\nthough seeking alternatives should be the primary founda-\ntion for cultural critiques.\nTo obtain their current prominence, gastronomic knowl-\nedge and skill have required both time and true devotees,\nincluding artists, eccentrics, provocateurs, and multidisci-\nplinary scholars, as well as some favorable circumstances.\nFor this discussion, we note that the first recorded use of the\nterm gastronomy dates back to 1623, but it entered the com-\nmon lexicon only after the foundation of corresponding\nresearch, including iterative experiments, examinations,\nclassifications, analyses, and obtained facts and conclusions.\nIn turn, such research required significant progress in the\nskills associated with preparing various dishes; linguisti-\ncally, it required a practice that was sufficiently recogniz-\nable, as occurred in the aftermath of the French Revolution.\nof gastronomy\" (p. 146). However, because of the clarity,\nnaturalness, and distinctiveness of the experience of senses\nof taste and smell, they remained difficult to prove and thus\nunrecognized or neglected as subjects of study for consider-\nable time.1 Yet these senses, which are arbiters of what is\nedible or inedible, tasty or unpalatable, are incomparable in\ntheir power and sophistication; few visual or acoustic stimuli\nprompt such accurate reactions. In literature, the sense of\nsmell is the only one whose vitality and fatality have been\ncharacterized by a profound, lucid, existential, literary, and\naesthetic reflections (S\u00fcskind, 1986). Reactions to smell and\ntaste include altered moods and conditions, which become\nmanifest instantly and in a distinctly individual manner,\nwhether reflexive, mimicking, or onomatopoeic.\nThese reactions also are difficult to hide and influenced\nby cultural, collective traditions (e.g., Douglas, 1966; Largey\nence has decisive importance, because over the time, taste\nbecomes the character of a culture. Unlike Claude Levi-\nStrauss and structuralists, who prioritize cultural conven-\ntions to distinguish edible from inedible, Harris introduces\nbiopsychological, ecological, and political-economic deter-\nminants of the consumption and production of food (Harris,\n1987). If we overcome disciplinary limitations and prefer-\nences, it is difficult to deny the existence of culinary codes in\nevery society that regulate complex geographic, historical,\nand developmental characteristics, as well as customs, reli-\ngions, worldviews, and alimentary habits, semiotics, and\ndesign. Because this influence is broader than the individual\nlevel, these issues belong to the domain of cultural anthro-\npology more than any other field. Nothing is inherently tasty\nor unsavory, whether dogs, snails, locusts, or pigs; that which\nis edible or inedible is both an individual choice and a choice\nmade by our cultures (see Korsmeyer, 2002).\nMore profound and intimate than other stimuli, smells\nand tastes recount, better than words, what we would not\nremember otherwise. Like the amalgamated voice of chemi-\ncal and emotional processes, they are heralds of the uncon-\nscious and neglected triggers of forgotten personal\nexperiences. Both smell and taste can revive memories of\npast events, and from a physiology perspective, oblivion is\ndeceptive, such that we would approach memory and obliv-\nion differently if we studied them through the registers of\nsmell and taste--those sudden stimuli that highlight the per-\nmanence experience. Scent reminders reveal that, in an emo-\ntional sense, anything that once existed never disappears. It\nis very much the same with the theoretical-historical treat-\nment of culinary art: Dogged by controversies, these issues\nhad been slowly attracting a focused research or aesthetic\nattention, first in philosophy and later in other scholarly\ndisciplines.\nWithout creativity and inspiration, cookery could not\nprogress, yet it generally has been approached as knowledge\nthat gets transformed into a repetitive routine. Of course, it is\na routine, just like any other arts based on knowledge and\nclich\u00e9s. The procedure is the same; the only thing that differs\nis the value position taken toward one or the other type of\nactivity or art. If classical aesthetics include \"masters and\ndilettanti, authentic authors and epigoni, creators and follow-\ners, ingenious minds and spiritual dwarfs, then the same will\nIn short, food is widely understandable and indispensable\nfor everyone, which is both its advantage and its greatest\nshortcoming with regard to the status of food as art in its\npreparation. The immediate, direct gratification of instincts\ndeprived cookery of both aesthetic status and attention as an\nimportant research subject, though without this instinctive\nelement, it is difficult to imagine the existence of any related\nart or significant achievement. Instead, the domination of a\n\"rational,\" hierarchical system of values and knowledge\nrequires an extraordinary performance: to prove the undeni-\nable, self-evident value of culinary works using weighty\napproaches from art and science.\nIf no other method enables us to make ourselves under-\nstood, we note that the wisdom and art of nutrition precede\nenlightenment in other disciplines. In philosophical anthro-\npology, the importance of food is most easily recognized in\nthe Epicurean tradition, a conceptualization of humans and\nthe world in which pleasure is the highest good, continuing\nDemocritus's materialistic system of thought. Post antiquity,\ncenturies passed before sensuous experiences were seriously\ncontemplated; as late as the 17th century, owing to John Locke\nand empiricism, sensuous experience earned legitimacy\nthrough the certitude of cognition, that is, Locke's (1995)\nwell-known assertion that there is nothing in the mind except\nwhat was first in the senses.The emergence of empiricism\n4 SAGE Open\nopened the door to Julien de Offray de La Mettrie's (1997)\nethics of sensuous pleasures, in which he argued that \"instinct\nis wiser than intellect\" (p. 10).\nBecause of his claim that psychological occurrences must\nbe related to organic changes in the nervous system, he was\nseverely criticized first by his fellow physicians and later by\nEnlightenment thinkers (Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Holbach).\nThe attack on La Mettrie came from all sides: He was\ndespised and attacked by everyone, from the French king,\nsenior clerics, Enlightenment thinkers to academic dignitar-\nies. His positions, disputable for the beginning of 18th cen-\ntury, inevitably led to his being driven to Berlin, under the\nprotective patronage of Frederick the Great, where he ended\nhis life (1751), following a sumptuous dinner prepared in his\nhonor. La Mettrie's death, allegedly caused by an excessive\nconsumption of pheasant pate in truffle cream sauce, or\ndeliberate poisoning--it had never been established--spar-\nkled speculations that it was a deserved punishment for his\nexcessively sensual and hedonistic views. In an era ruled by\ntheoretical intellect (i.e., civilized behavior and restraint), it\nwas difficult to write about the finest morality of enjoyment\nor the life whose purpose was seeking for pleasures.\nUnfinished First Revolution\nAlthough Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La\nReyni\u00e8re and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin did not immedi-\nately follow La Mettrie, the founders of the gastronomic\nalphabet continued his hedonic-sensual thought, specializing\nin the wisdom and art of good dining. Through practical and\ntheoretical work, they aimed to prove that skillful treatments\nof food, more than any other skill or art, constitute quests for\ntaste and the sublime. By preferring the invention of a new\nmeal to the discovery of an unknown celestial body, they\napplied their talents to the only topic that also can be tasted.\nGrimod de La Reyni\u00e8re was an eccentric theater lover and\ncritic, who created what modern speakers would call an\nevent. This conceptual artist was a member of various societ-\nies that gathered on specific days of the week to develop, and\nenjoy, the procedures of the emerging science of gastronomy.\nThe results of these gatherings were not just new edible\ninventions but also rules for naming and evaluating meals, as\nwell as improved manners, forms, and orders for serving\nfood. They introduced the idea of a lift between the kitchen\nand dining room, and they produced the methodological\nnotion of a jury of tasters, which still remains an essential\ninstitution for testing new technologies or ingredients in food\npreparation. Such a jury of tasters is responsible for reflect-\ning on and evaluating morsels to determine the taste of a\ndish, prior to writing any text or review.\nTo introduce gastronomy into the fine arts, Grimod de La\nReyni\u00e8re (1978) presented his idea as a revolution, designed to\novercome the stale order that marked the organization of values\nand knowledge. The same aim was pursued by Brillat-Savarin\n(2002), who did not conceal his demand for the highest\nposition for gastronomy. Proceeding from the recognition\nthat nothing can live without food, these provocateurs further\nasserted that there could be no metaphysics or politics with-\nout the reconciliation of humans with their urges, passions,\nand instincts. Ignoring the ruling order as much as it ignored\nthem (their contemporaries remained mistrusting and scared\nof their originality), these founders of hedonism evaluated\nhistorical epochs only according to their contributions to the\nalimentary and progress made in the preparation of food,\nwhether practical, technological, aesthetic, or hedonistic. To\navoid semantic misconceptions, we also note that the hedo-\nnism Grimod de La Reyni\u00e8re practiced had little in common\nwith the contemporary sense of this term; rather, it implied\nself-control, manners, semi-satiating bites, rituals, forms,\norder, sensibility, reflection, and intelligent conversations\nduring the course of meals, which represented acts to share\npleasures and establish closeness (Onfray, 1997). It was not\nimmoderateness or gluttony but quite the opposite, namely,\ncontrolled restraint.\nAnother multitalented gastronomist and a contemporary\nof the originators of the gastronomic scene--as well as true\ndevotee to the beautiful and tasty--Antonin Car\u00eame sought\nto achieve through cookery (pastry making in particular)\nwhat he could not do through architecture. Faced with rejec-\ntions of his projects, he shifted his talent to culinary writings\nand discussions of the art of French cuisine, along with draw-\nings, copper plate engravings, and \"deteriorative,\" edible\nworks modeled after architectural designs. With his knowl-\nedge of architectural styles, which he applied to food prepa-\nration, Car\u00eame became the originator of bourgeois cuisine,\ndefined as follows:\nThe bourgeois cuisine attempts to bound the internal by\nthe external, to negate the spiritual refinement of a dish by an\nalluring appearance. That is the reason for such popularity of\nflamb\u00e9 dish preparation, over-pouring and permeation, soak-\ning and benumbing the taste by alcohol; saucing, covering\nby cream, butter, and b\u00e9chamel sauce spread. Then, glaze\nicing, which hardens the dish and fixes it by a layer of jelly;\npoaching and frying in bread crumbs, which disguise the true\nappearance of eggs and chicken; filling, by means of which\nvolume is artificially increased, and a false appearance is\ncreated (Onfray, 1997). This step forward in culinary form,\ntexture, content, and poetic naming is largely manifested in\nthe altered approach to the contemporary culinary order,\nwhich relied solely on taste and smell. By subordinating his\napproach to the sense of sight, he shifted the art of well-pre-\npared dishes from a focus on smelling to visual sensations,\nwhile also directing attention to stylistic harmony and visual\neffects.\nAlthough hungry for recognition, Car\u00eame had to content\nhimself during his lifetime with the title pastry chef-archi-\ntect, or the Palladio of French cuisine. The new world emerg-\ning after the French Revolution needed precisely this type of\ntalent, because it celebrated (including through food) the\npower of money as a new master, as possessed by merchants,\neri and Tournois 5\nentrepreneurs, and members of the bourgeoisie. Although\nopposed to the ruling system, Car\u00eame served the emerging\norder--as, for that matter, did Brillat-Savarin and Grimod de\nLa Reyni\u00e8re--because \"by abolishing one system of privi-\nleges based on blood, the French revolution created prerequi-\nsites for establishment of a brilliant, brand-new system, this\nIn the years that followed the political revolution, the culi-\nnary revolution remained incomplete, important only to itself\nand a narrow circle of people who could benefit from it. The\nmain ideas of its actors were left unrealized, and the extant\nvalue and knowledge order stayed intact. Chefs remained\nchefs, the bourgeoisie enjoyed ever-tastier dishes, and artists\nand metaphysicians continued to guard their artistic \"tem-\nple.\" Good dishes were necessary but not sufficient to invoke\na fundamental change of the value system, which instead\nrequired outside influence, aided by the receptiveness, and\nthe weaknesses, of the culture itself, as it started to consume\nitself. Ultimately though, the culinary specialties of true rev-\nolutionaries Brillat-Savarin, Grimod, and Car\u00eame would be\nenjoyed by their gastronomic progeny in France and world-\nwide through different types of cheese, cakes, and various\nother dishes--all savored in a French manner of dining. By\neating their dishes, the disciples extended the life of their\ncreators, who will, after an uninterrupted continuity of prac-\nticing, experience the triumph of deserved world fame and\nthe victory in the present day theory and aesthetics--their\nculinary ideas and inventions will be replicated by the artists\nwho wished to be recognized as such.\nIn the 19th century, these culinary provocateurs (i.e.,\nBrillat-Savarin, Grimod, and Car\u00eame) could have found per-\nhaps their greatest ally in Friedrich Nietzsche, a self-pro-\nclaimed disciple of Dionysus. Whether he knew of their\nendeavors, Nietzsche's (1888) poetics of life spoke in their\ndisembodied voices, in his attempt to reassess all values,\nincluding his claims that human salvation depends on the\nform of nutrition. He gave priority to issues of food, climate,\nand residence over to all other questions, despite his tradi-\ntional German education, \"which from the beginning teaches\nlosing sight of realities, in order to run after entirely prob-\nlematic, so called `ideal' objectives\" (p. 41). Indulging his\ninstinct to overthrow idols and idealistic or rationalistic\nhoaxers throughout history, this self-confident sage claimed\nthat what and how we think is directly determined by what\nwe eat.\nFollowing this proclamation of the poetics of life in the\nlate 19th century, many authors remained indebted to\nNietzsche, whether they recognized it or not (mostly not).\nThe question of how we become what we are, as posed in\nthe subtitle of Ecce Homo, appears in Wrangham's (2009)\ntheory of cooking as the mother of mankind. However,\neven today, it is difficult to regard Nietzsche as being one\nof the founders of the ideas on wisdom and art of food\nconsumption, as his work has been rarely interpreted in\nthis key.\nThe (R)evolution That Guardians of the\nCult of Culture Cannot Digest\nThe complex question of the internal collapse of the cult of\nculture, and its co-relation with an event, historical circum-\nstances, or cumulative discontent, necessarily surpasses the\navailable framework of any one discipline, as well as our\nknowledge and ambitions. However, in a context that per-\ntains, directly or indirectly, to the change in the status of the\nart of cooking, we find a decisive role of Marcel Duchamp--\ncooking, a decisive role was performed by Marcel Duchamp\nwith his Chocolate Grinder (1913)--at the end of an epoch\nYet it is hard to define whether Duchamp's subversive acts\nwere directed at visual arts, to overcome the gap between art\nitself and the living world, or aimed to signify the erosion of\nthe previous order of things in the value system and organi-\nzation of knowledge, in terms of perceptions of sublime ver-\nsus low. Beyond objects and images, in the verbal realms of\nsocial and humanistic studies, indicators of change and dis-\ncontent with the ruling value order doubtlessly were\nexpressed before and after Duchamp, such as in Physiology\nof Taste by Brillat-Savarin; in Nietzsche's writings; in psy-\nchoanalysis, when Freud declared that something is wrong\nwith our standards and that \"It is impossible to escape the\nimpression that people commonly use false standards of\nmeasurement . . . They disparage, however, the true living val-\nues\" (Freud, 1930); later in the works by Theodore Adorno,\nClaude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. For example,\nBarthes (1972) helped encourage the shift from linguistic\nsemiology to a cultural version, summarized as poststructural-\nist critique. Through his analyses of advertisements for pan-\nzani spaghetti and similar works, Barthes also revealed an\ninterest in studies of food (see Barthes, 1983).\nSome versions of this cultural end cite the decline of\nvisual arts and art critiques in the 1970s, whereas others note\nthe trend of identifying marketing with culture (Seabrook,\n2000), through the dominance of representation, such that\nthe positions of the symbol and the symbolized switch. Still\nothers focus on the so-called death of the author. Yet they all\nagree that symbolic value of the cultural or artistic, in the old\nsense, became devaluated long ago. The value of the related\ntheory is its ability to register these processes and attempt to\nfind their causes, though the most convincing anticipation of\nthe profound changes actually emerged much earlier, in a lit-\nerary rather than theoretical domain. That is, Robert Musil\n(1965) predicted quick shifts in the evaluation of scientific\nknowledge, claiming\nOur teaching is so strong that it will transform the cesspool of\nyour sins into clear, sparkling mountain streams. But in science\nit happens every few years that something till then held to be in\nerror suddenly revolutionizes the field, or that some dim and\ndisdained idea becomes the ruler of a new realm of thought.\nSuch events are not merely upheavals, but lead us upward like a\nJacob's ladder. (p. 43)\n6 SAGE Open\nHe also foreshadowed the marginalization of humanistic\nvalues that had been typical of the period before 1914.\nCultural theorists, in their irrepressible drive to break from\nobsolete terms and previously imposed metaphysical objec-\ntives, slowly released the ballast of the past, to always find\nsomething new and interesting. Finally, by the end of the\ncentury, humanists had unburdened themselves of every-\nthing from the \"dark past\" and thus irreversibly marginalized\nthemselves as well.\nRegardless of the perspective taken, the collapse of the\ncult of culture took place during the \"short twentieth cen-\nculture, nothing would be the same after that end, as perhaps\nbest revealed in the context of fine arts--the first space to\nopen to culinary arts and ultimately its subordinate in the\npromotion of aesthetic, hedonistic, and consumer aspects.\nThe release from the visual provided a beneficial, important\nstrategy for survival in the new understanding of the cultural\nsphere. Saboteurs in their own fields licensed their profes-\nsional non-involvement strategy first as a provocation, then\nas a fashion or practices; as a result, few modern artists actu-\nally paint. This virus of obstruction and destruction of tradi-\ntional disciplinary conventions spread to other fields, and\nliterary and humanistic critique in general. Camille Paglia\nof negative critique in the United States and the prevailing\nstandard of cautious, indulgent reviews. From her perspec-\ntive, when academic whistles and bells quiet down, an atmo-\nsphere of general uniformity and simulation prevails; in\nfrustrated response, Paglia sharply criticized the inertial aca-\ndemic world, including the gap between it and commercial\nmass media; the means by which humanistic science, in the\nservice of politics, had become cheap propaganda; and voy-\neurism as a dominant cultural clich\u00e9.\nIn the late short 20th century culture, with the decisive aid\nof several actors such as Daniel Spoerri and Peter Kubelka,\nautonomy in the conventional sense of the word was lost.\nEven if not dead, culture in the 21st century changed, com-\npared with the previous century's perception. Cookery ben-\nefited from this death though, as a marginal, unexpected\nbeneficiary of complex processes, as well as directed action.\nIn the early 1960s, Daniel Spoerri attached notes reading,\n\"attention, work of art\" to delicatessen products; in the\n1970s, as the eat-art movement was established in Milan, he\nwas appointed a lecturer in the Department of Fine Arts of\ndecadence in art, this author concluded that nothing remained\nbut \"the sublime art of cookery\" for acquiring the knowledge\nabout oneself. In 1978, the film director and musician Peter\nKubelka became a cookery lecturer at the Academy of Fine\nArts in Frankfurt, in which role he taught that more could be\nachieved by raising awareness of and education about the\nsenses than through intellect. Yet these examples remained\nexceptions at the time, whereas in the present time, they would\nrepresent regular practice. Cookery clearly has gained legiti-\nmacy as an academic subject, as exemplified by the introduc-\ntion of relevant theory and practice in schools. French\nelementary school pupils already participate in systematic\ntraining in the study and formation of taste. This formation of\npersonal identity through taste can hardly be separated from\na general relation to the world or one's body. In addition, the\ncurriculum includes experimenting with known and unknown\ndishes and encouraging openness to the sensations, smells,\nand tastes of different cultures (Zeldin, 1995).\nThe dynamic relationship between cookery and art is\nexperiencing a sharp shift today. The traditionally subordi-\nnated position of cookery to art finally has been altered,\nlargely through the intervention of Marina Abramovi.\nCookery will no longer use the back door to access aesthetics\nand knowledge, but instead, the symbolic capital of art must\nappeal to cookery. In her performance Let Them Eat Volcano\nFlamb\u00e9! staged in the New York restaurant Park Avenue\nWinter, Abramovi effectively demonstrated the equivalence\nof the value of cookery and art, by equalizing the price of a\nmuseum ticket and the price of cake: US$20 was the price of\nentrance to the New York Museum of Modern Art and for the\nconsumption of a dessert that featured her signature. With\nher flamb\u00e9 cake sprinkled by golden leaves, the performance\nartist went even further, to achieve more than a mere equiva-\nlence, through a direct quotation of Antonin Car\u00eame, the\nfounder of bourgeois cuisine. Using flamb\u00e9 and glazed icing\nprocedures to subordinate, in value terms, the internal con-\ntent to external manifestations, Abramovi confirmed the\nparadigm through a combative binary structure, making her\nthe Car\u00eame of American art. If cookery, in the altered value\norder, gains the status of a superior, prestigious form of art,\nthen this new value hierarchy also must be reflected in our\nlanguage, so the formulation, Car\u00eame of American art, must\nbe understood affirmatively, rather than ironically or disparag-\ningly. When Car\u00eame claimed himself a Palladio of French cui-\nsine, his pride reflected the current hierarchy at the time.\nCalling her the Car\u00eame of American art is a compliment to\nAbramovi, within a value system in which the art of food\npreparation dominates. Accordingly, even as she maintains\nessentialist frameworks of internal and external, spiritual and\nmaterial, Abramovi demonstrates the shift of the traditional\nrelations of these values in the cultural hierarchy and affirms\nmaterial, hedonist, and luxury values on formal level, marked\nby golden leaves and flamb\u00e9. Although this shift can be inter-\npreted in at least two ways, the performance clearly transforms\nan old value order and symbolically verifies the change, a\nlong-term process achieved by various means. The initiation\nof cookery into the art world through performance is not\nunusual, because this art form is the closest to the single-time,\nunrepeatable quality of a culinary act. The question that\nremains is whether the symbolic capital of the artistic perfor-\nmance of Let Them Eat Volcano Flamb\u00e9! serves more than the\npurpose of the value inversion of a long-lasting dichotomy,\nbuilt through various means, or contributes to its overthrow.\neri and Tournois 7\nOne way or another though, \"a tortilla has been tossed,\"\nas a colloquial Spanish saying goes. Things were in their\nproper order; the art of preparing and consuming food\nacquired the status it has deserved from the beginning. Yet it\nwould be bitterly noticed by guardians of the metaphysical\ntemple, in a vain attempt to understand the historical move-\nments. Ironically, the art of cookery came to triumph in a\nperiod that, through \"progress\" and the serial production of\nfood, downgraded our consumption to a prehistoric status:\nSimilar to their distant ancestors, modern consumers have\nmeals in places imposed by need, such as fast food stands\nand petrol stations. Because the expansion of cookery coin-\ncided with the fall of \"true culture,\" comparisons are inevi-\ntable--though the global fame and influence of Jamie Oliver\nare hardly comparable with the fame and influence of any\npainter, playwright, or philosopher. Initiated during the\nEnlightenment but neglected for two centuries, gastronomy\nis teaching us a modern lesson, as the manifestation of civi-\nlized behavior, described in studies that have acquired the\ndignity of representing a prestigious scholarly discipline.\nEver increasing investments in the study of food, frequently\nby faculties in the social sciences, design, and art, testify that\ncookery is no longer a distant relative or exotic, unnecessary\nspice. On the contrary, it has become an experimentally\nestablished, verifiable expression of mutual conditioning:\nThrough gastronomy, and its molecular form in particular, a\npowerful alliance has been established between the rational\nand emotional attainment of an objective (This, 2009).\nConclusion\nThe winds of change have started to blow, bringing with\nthem a dynamic era in which, due to progress in communica-\ntions among other things, culture in the old sense of the word\nhas contributed to its own end. For those lulled by the pre-\ndictability of the previous linear flow of time, the ruling\norder, similar to a menu, appeared innovated to the point of\ninedibility. Butmenus cannot change without intentions of\nchange; similarly, these extensive changes could not have\noccurred without some dissatisfaction with the previous\nstate. As a result of our frequently distasteful anthropological\ntheories, the segment of reality that makes our world both\ntastier and more understandable had been marginalized. In\nthis process, supporters of traditional arts--possibly weary\nof examining the aesthetic possibilities of known-to-all pas-\nsions--could have either shrugged their shoulders and joined\nthe trend, or else observed from a distance how the unique\nexperience of creation, including through cookery, became\ncommonplace, usual, and banal. In the language of the domi-\nnant culture of market values and numbers, they might have\nobserved how prices dropped rapidly with the emergence of\nnew artists, including culinary ones.\nThroughout its history, leading to the status that it enjoys\ntoday, cookery has had to traverse long distances, from a routine\nnecessity aimed at fulfilling basic needs to an art performance.\nIt has been an uninterrupted path of testing and perfecting\nculinary skills, first by sense of smell and taste and later in time\nengaging all other senses. In that process, food has become\nmuch more than a central existential problem; its skilled prepa-\nration involves, at the same time, the art of mastering the taste,\ncolor, proportions, and, ultimately, the time and the meaning.\nIts status development, leading to its transformation into\nan artistic act, consisted of slow changes in viewers'perspec-\ntives, sometimes painstakingly, in that awareness of the aes-\nthetic and epistemological value of culinary works lagged\nbehind knowledge of food preparation. However, a rigid cul-\ntural order can be transformed and democratized through a\nseries of more or less successful revolutions that insist on\nawareness of the importance of all senses and receptiveness\nto different viewpoints, as unequivocally demonstrated by\nthe history of cookery. In retrospect, cookery has been invis-\nible as a subject of a serious aesthetic and analytical reflec-\ntions, treated as an object of refraction for metaphysical and\nphysical contemplations on the sublime or the low, and an\nindependent path with a performative impact. The persistent\ninfluence of cookery on the domain of thought also is appar-\nent in the alimentary metaphors used in this text, which facil-\nitate the \"digestion\" of the complex topics. Yet even though\nit remains a demanding topic of study--one that puts taste, as\na measure, to test--the art of cookery is also a research-\nfriendly topic, which should serve as a constant reminder\nthat we cannot linger too long on its theoretical development.\nTo conclude, Dewey (2005) wrote \"by one of the ironic per-\nversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence\nof the works of art upon which formation of an esthetic the-\nory depends, has become an obstruction to theory about\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
