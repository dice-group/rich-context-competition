It does so through a case study on one culturally important\nevent: Hurricane Katrina, one of the costliest and deadliest storms in American history.\nInstrumental in how Hurricane Katrina has been conceptualised as a natural disaster is\nthe vast amount of news reporting that has been published in the American news media.\nThis is because the news media have traditionally been viewed as providing a `window\non the world' (Tuchman, 1978: 1), and as a result, we may say that news `defines and\nthat linguistic analysis can reveal how an event is established as newsworthy.\nThis article therefore aims to make two contributions: first and foremost, it contrib-\nutes to the study of newsworthiness/news values and the evaluation of corpus linguistic\ntechniques. Second, by using a case study that focuses on an important environmental\nevent, this article also makes a contribution to ecolinguistics, which is concerned with\nthe relation between language and the environment (see Bednarek and Caple, 2010; Fill\nand M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, 2001, for overviews). From an ecolinguistic perspective, there is not\nmuch work on the reporting of environmental matters in the media (M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler, 2003),\nalthough climate change news has seen some attention (e.g. Bell, 1991; Carvalho, 2007;\nAmerican television news on Hurricane Katrina from a critical discourse analysis (CDA)\nperspective. With respect to environmental disaster reporting, Cottle (2009) argues that\nwe `need to better understand how the news media variously enter into their constitution\nand forms of response' (p. 70).\nA discursive approach to news values\nThe body of research on news values is vast and diverse, existing mostly within the dis-\ncipline of journalism and communications studies (see Caple and Bednarek, 2013, for a\nreview). By and large, news values are said to drive what makes the news, and the focus\nof this discipline is on answering the question why events make it into the news media.\nWithin linguistics, news values are mainly discussed in passing, with only some excep-\nthat language can be used to maximise news value, and Bednarek (2006) takes up Bell's\nsuggestion with a focus on evaluative language, whereas Cotter (2010) is concerned with\nethnographic newsroom analysis. Caple and Bednarek (2013) and Bednarek and Caple\n(2014) provide further discussion of linguistic approaches to news values.\nFrom the `discursive' perspective that we are taking here, we are concerned with how\nan event is constructed as newsworthy through semiotic resources such as language, as\nsummarised in Table 1 (for comprehensive discussion see Bednarek and Caple, 2012a,\nOne aim of such an approach is to analyse news reporting around an event to identify\nwhat values are emphasised and how each news value is constructed linguistically. To\nclarify, we will undertake a brief example analysis. The following text is from the front-\npage story of the Times-Picayune (New Orleans), published on Tuesday, 30August 2005,\nthe day after Katrina made landfall in Louisiana:\nTable 1. News values (alphabetical order).\nNews value Definition Linguistic resources\nConsonance The event/issue (including\nbut not limited to the people,\ncountries or institutions\ninvolved) is discursively\nconstructed as (stereo)typical\nin the view of the target\naudience\nEvaluations of expectedness (notorious,\nroutine for, famed for...); similarity with\npast (yet another, markedly similar to, once\nagain...); constructions of stereotypes\nand archetypal stories\nEliteness The event/issue (including\nbut not limited to the people,\ncountries or institutions\ninvolved) is discursively\nconstructed as of high status or\nfame in the eyes of the target\naudience\nVarious status markers, including\nlabels, recognised names, evaluations of\nimportance, descriptions of achievement\n(experts at Harvard university, a high-profile\narrest, Barack Obama, the Oscars, a key\nfederal government minister, top diplomats,\nwere selling millions of records a year...)\nImpact The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as having significant\neffects or consequences (not\nnecessarily limited to impact on\nthe target audience)\nEvaluations of significance (historic,\ncrucial...); reference to important or\nrelevant consequences (note that will stun\nthe world, Australia could be left with no\npolicy, leaving scenes of destruction...)\nNegativity The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as negative for the\ntarget audience\nNegative evaluative language (terrible,\nslaughter...); reference to negative\nemotion/attitude (distraught, worried,\ncondemn, criticise...); negative lexis\n(conflict, damage, death, crisis, row...)\nNovelty The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as new and/or\nunexpected for the target\naudience\nIndications of newness (fresh, new...);\nevaluations of unexpectedness\n(astonishing, strange...), comparisons\nthat indicate unusuality (the first time\n(shock at North Cottesloe quiz night...);\nreferences to unusual happenings (British\nman survives 15-storey plummet...)\nPersonalisation The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as having a\npersonal or `human' face\ninvolving personal experiences,\nincluding eyewitnesses (usually\nby non-elite actors)\nReferences to `ordinary' people, their\nemotions, experiences (Charissa Benjamin\nand her Serbian husband; `It was pretty\nbloody scary'...)\nProximity The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as geographically\nor culturally near the target\naudience\nExplicit references to place or nationality\nnear the target audience (An Australian,\nCanberra woman...); references to\nthe nation/community (the nation's\ncapital...); inclusive first person plural\npronouns (our nation's leaders...)\n(Continued)\nLead paragraph:\nHurricane Katrina struck metropolitan New Orleans on Monday with a staggering blow, far\nsurpassing Hurricane Betsy, the landmark disaster of an earlier generation. The storm flooded\nhuge swaths of the city, as well as Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, in a process\nthat appeared to be spreading even as night fell.\nThe headline, CATASTROPHIC, is an example of maximally intensified negative\nlexis, and simultaneously constructs Negativity and Superlativeness. The effects of the\nevent (Impact) and its scale (Superlativeness) are emphasised through expressions such\nas swamps, threatens to inundate, with a staggering blow, far surpassing, flooded huge\nswaths and spreading even as night fell. The event is also established as highly relevant\nthrough references to places that would be well known to the local target audience of The\nTimes-Picayune, constructing Proximity (e.g. 9th ward, St Bernard, Lakeview Levee, New\nOrleans, Slidell, Lake Pontchartrain). Timeliness is also established, as the event is iden-\ntified as recent (e.g. on Monday) and ongoing (appears to be spreading as night fell),\nwith the use of the present tense in the sub-headlines a conventionalised device of estab-\nlishing a sense of immediacy (swamps, threatens).\nThis brief analysis demonstrates how the Times-Picayune emphasises the event's high\nnegative and ongoing impact for its local target audience. Methodologically, we have\nproceeded via manual discourse analysis. But, as Hunston (2011) notes, `ways have to be\nfound to translate research questions prompted by discourse analysis into corpus\nNews value Definition Linguistic resources\nSuperlativeness The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as being of high\nintensity or large scope/scale\n(in the view of the target\naudience)\nQuantifiers (many, all, thousands...);\nintensifiers (sensational, dramatically,\nextreme...), including intensified lexis\n(epidemic, smashed, stun, wreck...);\nrepetition (building after building...);\nmetaphor/personification/simile (a\ntsunami of crime; epidemic swallowing\nSydney, looked like the apocalypse...);\ncomparison (most shocking child abuse\ncase...)\nTimeliness The event/issue is discursively\nconstructed as timely in\nrelation to the publication date:\nas recent, ongoing, about to\nhappen or otherwise relevant\nto the immediate situation/time\n(i.e. current or seasonal)\nExplicit time references (yesterday, today,\nnow, within days...); verb tense and\naspect (have been trying, is preparing...);\nreferences to seasonal/current\nhappenings\nTable 1. (Continued)\ninterrogation questions' (p. 167). In this article, we will test whether discursive news\nvalues analysis (DNVA) can be applied on a much larger scale through corpus linguistic\ntechniques.\nCorpus design and techniques\nThe Katrina corpus\nThis study is based on a specialised corpus of newspaper texts from an online news aggre-\ngator (Potts, 2013). The sampling unit is a single article (containing headline, byline,\ndateline, source name, publication date and publication section, where available), and the\nsampling frame consists of all database articles meeting the following parameters:\n1. originally published in a major American print publication;\n3. containing search terms Katrina AND (hurricane OR storm OR flood OR\ndisaster).\nAs texts were gathered from an online database, metadata pertaining to the original sec-\ntion and page number of texts is erratically included and often unreliable. Therefore,\ntexts from various subgenres of reporting (e.g. letters to the editor, obituaries) are\nincluded in the corpus. Although the overwhelming majority of data is news, it is not\npossible to identify the exact proportion of other newspaper matter without manually\nchecking metadata in 41,964 texts. However, by focusing on high-frequency items we\nmay be able to limit the influence of non-news and the influence of special topic news\n(e.g. business, sports).\nFor corpus analysis, we used the web-based corpus analysis system CQPweb (Hardie,\n2012), which annotated the data using the seventh version of the Unit for Computer\nResearch on the English Language (UCREL) Constituent Likelihood Automatic Word-\ntagging System (CLAWS), and the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS), assigning\npart-of-speech (POS) and semantic tags (semtags) to each text. CLAWS has an error rate\nof approximately 1.5%, with around 3.3% of ambiguities (such as multiple tags assigned to\nwords that may belong to two classes) left unresolved (Leech et al., 1994: 625). Using the\nsame corpus as in this article, Potts (2013) found that in approximately 90% of cases,\nUSAS provided the most appropriate semtag for a word in its given context (in 85% of\ncases this was listed first in the string of candidates and deemed `most likely' by the tag-\nger). This leaves approximately 10% of (mostly low-frequency) types incorrectly matched\nor unmatched. These were deemed acceptable confidence thresholds for this study.\nUsing corpus linguistic techniques to analyse news values\nIn this section, we briefly explain the corpus techniques that have so far been employed\nin DNVA. Bednarek and Caple (2012b) use frequency lists and concordancing for analy-\nsis of news values in one environmental news story, complementing this with manual\nmultimodal discourse analysis. Bednarek and Caple (2014) suggest that various corpus\nlinguistic techniques can be used to study newsworthiness. However, for reasons of\nscope, they focus only on word/bigram frequency and keywords, applying two different\nmethods to a small corpus (approximately 70,000 words).\nThe first method is to manually identify, from frequency/keywords lists, those forms\nthat seem to have the potential to construct news values. These are called `pointers'\n(Bednarek and Caple, 2014: 145) to newsworthiness and examples include yesterday\n(Timeliness), chief executive (Eliteness), the most (Superlativeness), England (Proximity\nfor a British target audience), attack (Negativity) and the first (Novelty). Concordance\nanalysis allows for qualitative examination of these forms, while range analysis can help\nto identify in how many different texts they occur.\nThe second method is to investigate topic-associated words using concordancing to\ngain insights into which news values are associated with particular concepts or entities.\nFor example, the word car, which has no apparent potential to construct news value, is\nfrequent in Bednarek and Caple's corpus, and concordances can show what news values\nare discursively associated with it.\nIn this article, we provide a first case study on a large newspaper corpus, including\nboth synchronic and diachronic aspects of analysis. The main aim of this case study is to\napply and test the integration of corpus techniques in DNVA. We evaluate corpus tech-\nniques that were not tested previously, in particular tagged lemma frequencies, colloca-\ntion, key part-of-speech tags (POStags) and key semantic tags.\nThe main statistic employed here is log likelihood (LL). We use the LL ratio for ranking\nkeyness and identifying statistically significant collocates by measuring the confidence\nthat results are not due to chance (Rayson et al., 2004). This tends to favour higher-\nfrequency words, and is preferred here for this reason to avoid a potential skewing by low\nfrequency and therefore less-dispersed collocates, which might occur in special topic news,\nobituaries or letters to the editor (cf. section `The Katrina corpus'). For this reason, we also\nset a minimum of five for frequency of node, collocate and collocation. We mainly use a\nwindow span of four words to the left to four words to the right (4L-4R), as this is the most\ncommonly used in corpus linguistic studies on English, although a window of five is also\ncommon in computational linguistics (McEnery and Hardie, 2012: 129). We recognise that\nchoice of statistic is not unproblematic. Ranking keywords by LL has recently been prob-\nlematised (e.g. Gabrielatos and Marchi, 2012), but it remains the most widely used keyness\nstatistic, and as a result, no other option has been offered to date in CQPweb and Wmatrix,\nthe concordancers utilised here. Furthermore, since different collocation measures mean\ndifferent results, this is an area where future experimentation could be undertaken \u00ad which\ncollocation measures work best for identifying news values?\nAlthough the main objective of this study is an investigation into the use of corpus-based\ntechniques to explore newsworthiness, we are also working with discourses. Therefore, as a\nside effect, we will also gain insights into how a specific happening \u00ad Hurricane Katrina \u00ad\nwas linguistically constructed as newsworthy in major American newspapers.\nFindings\nSections `The tagged lemma frequency list' and `Collocation' focus on tagged lemma\nfrequencies and collocation analysis, using a subset of the Katrina corpus, comprising\nthe months August and September 2005. The storm touched down in the last week of\nAugust, which makes the data from this month potentially the richest. The subsequent\nmonth includes the largest amount of Katrina material. This subcorpus (9.65 million\nwords) hence focuses on the earlier stages of the event and news cycle. Analyses will be\nsynchronic.\nIn sections `Key parts-of-speech'and `Key semantic tags', we perform keyness analy-\nsis of POS and semantic tags across a short-term diachrony, to test whether key linguistic\ndevices indicate changed news values in Hurricane Katrina reporting over time. For this\nin 5360 texts). The August subcorpus contains texts published as the event unfolded,\nwhereas the September subcorpus reflects the immediate aftermath, and the October\nsubcorpus encompasses coverage of the continuing fallout.\nThe tagged lemma frequency list\nTable 2 shows a list of the top 200 most frequent lemmas used as a particular POS, cat-\negorised according to perceived potential to construct a specific news value and exclud-\ning punctuation (the tags are explained at http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/URG/codes.\nhtml#klettpos, accessed 12 June 2014).2 This categorisation is based on hypothesis \u00ad no\nconcordancing or collocation analysis was undertaken at this stage, because of the high\nmentioned below. Where specific examples are provided, they come from the corpus. We\nhave avoided multiple categorisations, but do note occasionally when an item could also\nbe placed in a different category.\nAs expected, there are many function words that are not clearly identifiable as point-\ners to a specific news value. This is not to say that they cannot be used to construct\nnewsworthiness, depending on the co-text (Bednarek and Caple, 2014: 147). The table\nalso includes nouns, verbs and adjectives that tell us little in and of themselves about\nnewsworthiness, although in a specific co-text they might construct news values. To give\njust one example, lemmas like company, business, school and center may be used with\nproper nouns which establish the local (Proximity) or elite (Eliteness) nature of the\nrespective entity.\nThere is also a considerable amount of high-frequency verbs that do not clearly point\nto a specific news value, including reporting expressions (e.g. say, tell). As hypothe-\nsised by Bednarek and Caple (2014: 147), reporting verbs are nevertheless useful as a\nstarting point, because we can analyse the speakers associated with such verbs in terms\nof constructed status: ordinary affected people/eye witnesses (Personalisation) versus\nauthorities (Eliteness). Collocation analysis may be helpful here, especially when deal-\ning with a large corpus. Table 3 shows the top 50 collocates, excluding punctuation, for\nthe lemma say, which is the most frequent reporting verb at rank 10 with 86,700 instances.\nTable 3 suggests that elite sources are often cited, as indicated through the high-status\nor authority role labels such as officials, analysts or executive, and proper nouns referring\nto leading politicians (President George Bush, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana\nGovernor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco). Concordancing shows that Maestri also refers to\nTable 2.

Other collocates are not easily classifiable,\neither because they are pronouns or general terms of address or because they are com-\nmon surnames (Smith, Williams, Davis, Brown) or first names (John, Mike, Robert, Jim,\nMichael), which can be used with both elite and ordinary news actors. Concordancing\ncould be used to establish proportions of `ordinary' versus `elite' speakers here.\nNevertheless, this very brief collocation analysis confirms the hypothesis that reporting\nverbs can be a useful starting point for investigating news values.\nTo return to the broader discussion of Table 2, it may appear surprising that the\npositive lemma good is so frequent, occurring 7769 times in the corpus. After all,\nNegativity is more commonly recognised as a news value than Positivity (though see\nNegativity has been called `the basic news value' (Bell, 1991: 156). However, the\nadjective good (comprising the word forms good, better, best) may not necessarily\nrefer to positive happenings and events around Katrina (collocates of best include\nway, thing, interests, friends, worst) and may also be negated (e.g. not/n't occur 309\ntimes to the left of the word form good) or used for comparison (e.g. than is the most\nsignificant 4L/4R collocate of better). Nevertheless, this is an intriguing finding and\nan example where a frequency list can come up with unexpected results, which can\nthen be explored further.\nWe now move on to those lemmas that can be classified as potential pointers to a\nspecific news value (based on Table 1). For Eliteness, this includes the proper noun bush\nand his title president, as well as adjectives and nouns pointing to authorities or official\nservices such as official, federal, red (as in Red Cross), government, service, team and\nagency. For Personalisation, this includes lemmas pointing to ordinary people: people,\nfamily, resident, child \u00ad to this we can add evacuee and victim (from the Negativity and\nImpact row). From the perspective of news values analysis, the latter nouns construct\nTable 3.

More detailed analysis of attributes and naming\nstrategies for human referents in the Katrina corpus is provided in Potts (2013).\nFor Proximity and Timeliness, we have included as `pointers' all potential indicators\nof place and time, including expressions that may anaphorically, cataphorically or exo-\nphorically point to a place (there, here) or time (then), for example,\nWe know the devastation is worse there [the coast] than it is here [Lucedale]. (Atlanta Journal\n\u00ad Constitution)\nWe must emphasise, however, that not all place and time references establish\nProximity and Timeliness. The question is whether or not a particular place reference\nconstructs the event as geographically or culturally near the target audience and whether\nor not a particular temporal reference constructs the event as recent, ongoing, about to\nhappen or seasonal. Thus, lemmas like after, when, before, while may more often sim-\nply construct temporal relations between happenings, rather than constructing news\nvalue, as in this example:\nThe water and sewage pumps in the coastal refinery city of Baytown malfunctioned during the\nhurricane, and residents were asked to conserve water Saturday while the city worked on the\nproblem. (Washington Post)\nA word like there can simply be used in existential constructions, too, rather than\nconstructing Proximity:\nThe deaths were declared storm-related because there was some physical evidence the person\nmade an effort to survive after the storm, Eckert said. (Times-Picayune)\nFor Proximity, pointers further include the first person plural lemmas we and our.\nWhen used in a way that includes the target audience, these can establish Proximity.\ntions from small samples might be the only way of establishing the extent of inclusive\nusage here.\nTo continue with our discussion of Table 2, pointers to Novelty comprise indications\nof `newness' (new, first), which emphasise the various ways in which aspects of events\nare new or `a first'.3 This is very common in news discourse in general, but collocation\nor concordance analysis could tell us more about the specific entities constructed as\n`novel' in Katrina reporting.\nPointers to Superlativeness include quantification and intensification. Even small\nnumbers (one, two, three) may intensify on occasion (e.g. one billion), as may the lem-\nmas some (e.g. some of the toughest times) and any (e.g. we don't have any insurance.\nNone. Not a dime). like can be used in a simile to intensify (e.g. Home . . . looks like a\n`war zone'; it looks like a bomb went off), which is why it is included here, but it is mul-\ntifunctional and not all of its 7800 instances are likely used to intensify. than is included\nin this category because we assume it occurs in intensifying constructions such as more\n. . . than, or ADJ-er than. just, even, only construct Superlativeness in expressions like\nprices tripled in just weeks; even metro Atlanta could feel some effects of the storm; in\nonly four hours Saturday, the Salvation Army raised $10,922.\nFinally, the last row in Table 2 includes pointers to both Negativity and Impact. They\nare included in the same category here because impact tends to be constructed as nega-\ntive in disaster reporting. This category includes words which construct cause\u00adeffect\nrelations (because, leave; e.g. more than 1\nmillion people could be left stranded) and\nhurricane-related labels (hurricane, storm), including its name (katrina), since hurri-\ncanes are likely to be culturally evaluated as negative. Also included are words that\nconstruct the event as a problem (disaster, emergency) and words we hypothesise refer\nto needing or providing help (help, relief, effort) or to the hurricane's negative effects,\nincluding on people (damage, evacuee, victim).\nPerhaps slightly more problematically, we have also included the lemmas oil, gas,\nfood, price, money and move. We have included these here because we hypothesise that\nthey refer to negative effects in terms of prices and availability of oil, gas, food and the\nmovement of people after disasters (non-causative leave may also be used here). This\nhypothesis is grounded in previous research on the event, as well as an understanding of\nthe corpus and its sociocultural context. Potts (2013: 124) shows that adjectival collo-\ncates from the semantic category `movement, location, travel and transport' co-occur\nwith naming strategies resident, victim and survivor in the Katrina corpus. News\nworthiness is socially negotiated, and so it is critical that any analysis of newsworthiness\nis buttressed by research into and awareness of the sociocultural context. Although it is\nimpossible to read each text in this corpus in depth, we know that the gulf region is a\nknown industrial hub, so oil, gas, price, money are likely to refer to the hurricane's nega-\ntive impact. Some instances may result from the business news stories in the corpus, as\nexplained earlier.\nIt is now time to evaluate the technique of using a tagged lemma list to explore news\nvalues. Where it appears superior to a pure frequency list is in its power to disambiguate.\nFor example, the use of new tagged as substantive shows instances where it is used as\npart of a location name (New Orleans \u00ad Proximity), whereas its use as an adjective may\nconstruct Novelty. It also allows the identification of high-frequency lemmas such as say\nas well as the frequency of its individual word forms. However, the tagged lemma list\ndoes share some of the problems of the frequency list. Word forms and lemmas are mul-\ntifunctional. Some have a range of different meanings, so that they may construct differ-\nent news values or no news value depending on their usage and meaning in a given\nstretch of text. Others construct several news values at the same time (e.g. victim,\ndisaster, damage), making multiple classification a messy necessity. These issues mean\nthat such a list can only be used as a starting point, to formulate a range of hypotheses\nwhich need to be confirmed through additional qualitative analysis.\nCollocation\nAs noted earlier, Bednarek and Caple (2014) use concordancing of topic-associated con-\ntent words to find out what news values are constructed around a given entity. However,\nwhen using a large corpus, concordancing may not be viable, and other methods of\nexposing `non-obvious' meaning \u00ad or `meaning which might not be readily available to\nnaked-eye perusal'(Partington et al., 2013: 11) \u00ad in discourse might be employed to better\neffect. Here, we explore whether collocation analysis could be used for the same purpose.\nTo do so, we will focus on the top 100 right-hand collocates of hurricane (Table 4).\nTable 4 shows that the top 100 right-hand collocates of hurricane include the names of\nvarious hurricanes and other proper nouns, the latter potentially constructing Proximity\n(Gulf, Florida, Miami). Furthermore, most of the noun collocates establish Negativity,\nSuperlativeness and/or Impact, through reference to providing help (relief, efforts, fund,\nrecovery, effort, benefit, protection, concert, Lemon-Aid), to the negative effects and\npower of the hurricane (aftermath, winds, devastation, damage, impact, disaster, flood-\ning, havoc, strength, rampage, surge, fury), and to affected people (victims, evacuees,\nsurvivors). The latter also constructs Personalisation, as argued previously. Only some\nnouns appear unrelated to news values, referring to the stages/actions associated with hur-\nricanes: season, landfall, zone, path, strike, activity. Similar to the nouns, most of the verb\ncollocates construct Negativity (e.g. threatened), Superlativeness (e.g. slammed) or\nImpact (e.g. caused). Often all three news values are established simultaneously: for\ninstance, devastated and ravaged construct the hurricane as high in negative impact. Only\nsome verbs refer to the stages/actions of hurricanes, for example, approached, passed.\nThe adjective collocate subsequent primarily co-occurs with word forms referring to\nthe negative impact of the hurricane (evacuation, flood, flooding, floodwaters, levee\nbreak, closing, damage, relief efforts), hence clearly constructing Negativity and Impact\n(Figure 1).\ncomparisons, which are sometimes used for Superlativeness and/or Novelty, and which\nmay also explain the collocating hurricane names:\nThe magnitude of the disaster in St. Bernard has surpassed Hurricane Betsy in 1965.\n(Times-Picayune)\nKatrina would also be the nation's deadliest hurricane since 1900.

To explore news values constructed around the entity `Katrina' more fully, we\nalso need to consider the left-hand co-text as well as collocates for additional referential\ndevices (storm, Katrina). Around the word form hurricane, repeatedly constructed news\nvalues are Negativity, Superlativeness and Impact. This is an unsurprising result, since\nwe would expect disaster reporting to emphasise an environmental event's high negative\nimpact on the community. Since collocation analysis uncovers what we would expect it\nto uncover, rather than any counter-intuitive results, it may in fact be a useful technique\nfor news values analysis: `\"uncovering the obvious\"... gives more credibility to other\nnon-obvious findings' (Baker et al., 2013: 30). This suggests that collocation analysis\ncan indeed pinpoint repeated constellations of specific news values constructed around\nentities. However, since it focuses on the immediate co-text, rather than the whole news\narticle, it can only provide a partial view of news values constructed around a particular\nissue. But there is also merit in showing how news values are constructed and collocation\nanalysis has the power to identify recurring phraseologies (e.g. the co-occurrence of\nFigure 1. Concordances for hurricane + subsequent.\nhurricane with high-intensity verb forms such as slammed, ripped, blasted), figurative\ndevices such as metaphor/personification (e.g. roar, fury, wrath) and rhetorical strategies\n(e.g. historical comparison). It thus aids the identification of common conventions and\nclich\u00e9s of hurricane news reporting.\nKey parts-of-speech\nCan corpus linguistic techniques help us to understand changes in the construction of\nnewsworthiness over time? To test this, we now discuss a key POStag analysis on three\nKey POStags from each of these subcorpora were generated using the other two sub-\ncorpora as reference. Keyness was calculated using LL with a significance cut-off point\nof 0.001%.4 For reasons of scope, only the three items with the highest confidence scores\nin each category are explored here at greater length. To do so, we identified the specific\nlexical items making up the greatest proportion of each key POS category, and used col-\nlocation analysis to gain a broad understanding of meaning in use, through the lens of\ncommon context. When deeper analysis was needed (e.g. to disambiguate instances of\npolysemous words), we took randomly thinned samples of 50 instances and observed\npatterns at the concordance level. The first subcorpus to be discussed is August 2005\n(Table 5).\nThe POStag with the highest LL score in August 2005 is `Past tense of lexical\nverb', which is somewhat surprising, given that this is the `breaking news' subcorpus.\nWhile the past tense can construct events as recent (the news value of Timeliness),\nthis depends on specific explicit or implied temporal reference (e.g. yesterday vs last\nyear). A single item \u00ad said \u00ad accounts for over 30% of this result, and occurs with\ngovernment officials and spokespeople (Eliteness), and, less frequently, `ordinary'\neyewitnesses (Personalisation); top collocates (span \u00b13, minimum frequency: 5,\nLL>15.13) include he, she, officials, Mr., Blanco, Nagin, spokesman (see also section\n`The tagged lemma frequency list' earlier). Other, dramatically less frequent, past\ntense lexical verbs (lost, killed, struck, died, warned, caused, canceled, urged)\nindicate Negativity and Impact.\nTable 5. Key part-of-speech tags in the August 2005 subcorpus.\nNo. Part-of-speech In subcorpus `Aug\nIn reference subcorpus\nLog\nlikelihood\nFrequency\n(absolute)\nFrequency\n(per mil.)\nFrequency\n(absolute)\nFrequency\n(per mil.)\n1 Past tense of lexical\nverb\n2 Singular weekday\nnoun\n3 Singular noun of\ndirection\n`Singular noun[s] of direction'(e.g. north, south, east, west) are pointers to Proximity,\nalthough top collocates highlight a multitude of contexts: the nouns of direction collocate\nwith proper and common nouns of place (Florida, shore), and measurement nouns and\nadverbs (miles, farther). All of these may indicate Proximity, but this relies on the dis-\ntance between the location of its target audience and the mentioned locations. US loca-\ntions (such as Florida) are culturally/geographically near a US audience (national\nProximity), whereas references to local places construct Proximity for the target audi-\nence of local newspapers (local Proximity). Nouns of direction are good indicators of\nlocal Proximity when capitalised (e.g. `South Carrollton Avenue'), indicating proper\nnames of places in a given (known) context.\nFinally, instances of `Singular weekday noun' underscore Timeliness; in 49 out of\n50 random concordance lines, these refer to instances in the (very near) past, report-\ning on the movements, statements, and impacts upon people in the previous week.\n`Singular weekday noun' also appears as a key POStag in the September 2005 subcor-\npus, and is the only repeated key tag across the subcorpora (Table 6). Concordancing\nshows that these nouns refer to dates that are not recent in relation to the date of\npublication and hence do not construct Timeliness. Rather, they temporally situate\nevents, such as the hurricane's strike, in relation to the present, and contribute to\nestablishing one of the `\"five W's and an H\" \u00ad who, when, where, what, how, why' \u00ad\nOne key September POStag indicates clear shifts in comparison to August reportage:\noveruse of the `Infinitive' in contrast to previous overuse of the past tense lexical verb.\nThe infinitive in English is so flexible \u00ad taking its tense from auxiliaries \u00ad that it is not a\nreliable indicator of Timeliness (though it tends to be present-focused and forward-look-\ning in concordance lines). Frequent items in this POS group favour mental/behavioural\nprocesses (see, know, want, think), including (pro)social activities (e.g. help). While the\ninfinitive itself does not point to a news value, these lexical items convey both personal\nand national Impact. Mental/behavioural processes are individual, and help to convey\npersonal accounts of speakers in their `own voices', as eyewitnesses, offering Person-\nalisation. Many of these mental/behavioural processes (in the infinitive) are incorporated\nthrough inclusion of quotations:\nTable 6.

(Atlanta Journal \u00ad Constitution)\nWhile quotations from high-status professionals generally construct Eliteness, in the\nfirst example above, Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Wooley constructs himself as\nan eyewitness, with reference to his particular experience and emotions, thus also per-\nsonalising the event. In the second example, an ordinary citizen is offering help through\npersonally identifying with the affected residents.\nWhat emerges from Table 6 as characteristic of September 2005 compared to the\nmonths before and after is overuse of third personal plural personal pronoun (they). In\nonly 5 out of 50 sample concordance lines are they named individually in the extended\ncontext; they refers to generalised evacuees, government officials and employees of aid\norganisations. This indicates a weaker form of Personalisation, as people are incorpo-\nrated as generalised referents rather than individualised actors who are associated with\nprocesses or quotations (see e.g. concordance below). Rather than hearing from indi-\nviduals themselves about their experiences, we now hear about groups of individuals,\nsome of whom are Elite. This is similar to the distancing and objectification in Hurricane\nKatrina reporting observed by Potts (2013):\n`The result is that many of our citizens simply are not getting the help they need, especially in\nNew Orleans' he said. (New York Times)\nWe move on now to discussion of the final subcorpus, representing the continuing\naftermath of the storm. Compared to August and September, October 2005 features a\nhigh amount of measurements and numbers, two of its key POS (unit of measurement,\ncardinal number) contributing to this preference (Table 7).\nCardinal numbers do not reliably indicate newsworthiness here, as these include dates\n(of varying distance from the present), counts (from small to great) and radio stations.\nTable 7.

Damage estimates ranged up to $10\nbillion.

(USA Today)\nIn the first example, $10 (unit of measurement) billion (numeral noun) in damages are\nestimated; in the second example, 72% of poll respondents say they are `worried' about\neffects (Personalisation, Negativity, Impact), with the high unit of measurement (72%)\nadding Superlativeness. A total of 40 of the top 50 lexical items contained within `Unit\nof measurement' are amounts in US dollars, highlighting the continuing negative impact\non financial stability after the storm.\nThis subcorpus stands apart from the others in one final way: singular month nouns are\nkey in October as opposed to singular weekday nouns, which were key in August and\nSeptember. Events are no longer conveyed in terms of distance within a week, but in terms\nof months (i.e. maximally within a year from the present). The most frequent items within\nAugust (7.38%), which still convey a degree of Timeliness, as they refer backwards and\nforwards in time only one (or, rarely, two) months into the past or future. It must be noted,\nthough, that Timeliness is usually measured in terms of days rather than months, and one\ncould argue that the use of month nouns in this subcorpus simply situates events in time.\nIn this section, we tested whether key POStags are useful for investigating the gram-\nmatical construction of newsworthiness across a diachrony. We suggested that key POS\ncategories in August, September and October 2005 could be linked to differing empha-\nses upon various aspects of newsworthiness. However, some key POStags are more\neasily linked to newsworthiness than others. On the whole, key POStags serve as good\nindicators of differences between various reporting periods, but involve many levels of\nanalysis to uncover the relationships that may (or may not) exist between these occur-\nrences and news values. This includes viewing the constituents of each POStag to gain\na better understanding of prominent patterns contributing to keyness as well as colloca-\ntion and concordance analysis of randomly thinned samples.\nKey semantic tags\nUsing USAS, each corpus item was assigned a tag denoting its correspondence to 1 of 21\nmajor discourse fields and 232 subdivisions. The semantic tags `show semantic fields\nwhich group together word senses that are related by virtue of their being connected at\nsome level of generality with the same mental concept' (Archer et al., 2002: 1). Items\nsharing semantic tags (e.g. say and claim) might not be frequent enough in isolation to\nmake it to the top of a frequency list (as in section `The tagged lemma frequency list'),\nbut in combination, may be a useful pointer for broader meanings. In this section, we\nparing the corpora, as described above. We consider the categories in the first instance,\nthen describe the most frequent constituents, and finally make use of collocation or\nconcordance line analysis to illuminate patterns.\nThe most key semantic subcategories in August 2005, as Hurricane Katrina was trav-\nelling across the Gulf Coast, directly relate to the event: `Weather', `Liquid' and\n`Damaging and destroying' all convey the Impact of the storm to varying degrees. Items\nfrom the `Weather' category convey Negativity, and are additionally intensified by their\ncollocates, which construct Superlativeness: Both hurricane and storm collocate with\ndevastating, major, powerful, deadly and catastrophic; winds collocates with high,\nstrong, heavy, fierce and powerful; flooding is frequently described as worst, severe,\nwidespread and extensive (\u00b13 span, LL >15.13 minimum frequency: 5).\nItems tagged `Damaging and destroying' (e.g. damage, damaged, broken, broke,\nripped, harm) describe the immediate aftermath of the storm in terms of negative impact\n(most prominently), but also in terms of Superlativeness (e.g. with intensified lexical\nitems devastation, destroyed, destruction, collapsed, ravaged). In an interrelated pattern,\nwords semantically tagged as `Liquids' describe Impact in terms of direct and indirect\nconsequences: the category contains 42.61% water and 5.11% waters, contrasting to\ntural Impact (flooding, oil spills), but also financial Impact (the rising cost of gasoline).\nImpact of both of these types is accompanied by Superlativeness; collocates include\nmeasurements (`27 feet of water') and comparative descriptors (`pushed ... gasoline\nprices sharply higher').\nIn comparison to the key semtags of August 2005 in Table 8, the key semtags of\nSeptember 2005 (in Table 9) appear at first glance markedly more `personal'. However,\ndeeper examination uncovers patterns previously explored. The most key semtag in this\ncatastrophe and 1.38% catastrophes. Less frequent are adjectives from the same word\nfamily (e.g. catastrophic, 4.22%; disastrous, 0.98%) and the negative evaluative adjective\nworst (1056 occurrences, 10.59% of semtags). This semantic tag thus incorporates both\nnegative lexis and evaluative language (Table 1), but both types of resources construct the\nTable 8.

Patterns that were uncovered during key POStag analysis also hold strong in the\nfocus on the monetary Impact of Hurricane Katrina: all three of the semantic subcatego-\nries are concerned with money and business.\nItems from `Money: Affluence' (e.g. fund, earnings, income, profit, capital) and\n`Business: Generally' (business, businesses, economy, inc. contracts, contract, corp)\nemphasise this financial Impact, as well as convey Eliteness (of large, powerful corpora-\ntions and funds). Impact and Eliteness are also conveyed through the items belonging to\nthe `Business: Selling' semtag (e.g. sales, market, buy, trade, sold, sell, sale, markets),\nalthough Timeliness is also integrated, often through predictions of sales/markets futures\n(sales of building products are expected to climb substantially). Comparison to previous\nmarket events and circumstances, such as 11 September 2001, also occur:\nBut investors believe that the hurricanes have made third-quarter results somewhat irrelevant in\nterms of predicting what's to come \u00ad not unlike the situation that faced the market after the\nSuch a comparison with 9/11 arguably constructs the hurricane's impact both as\nsevere, and as in line with expectations (Impact/Superlativeness/Consonance).\nIn this section, we devoted some time to exploratory analyses using key semantic\ntags.

This is because semantic fields have\nmuch more in common cognitively than items sharing a word class. Items from a seman-\ntic field may share, for instance, specific negative meanings (as was the case with the\nnegative impact category `Damaging and destroying'), or attract a set of (grammatically\nsimilar) collocates which establish a particular news value (as was the case with intensi-\nfying adjectival collocates of hurricane and storm from the `Weather' key semtag). For\nan initial overview of key areas that may contribute to constructing newsworthiness in a\ngiven corpus, we recommend key semantic tag analysis over key POStag analysis for\ntransparency and rapidity.\nConclusion\nThere are a number of reasons why it is challenging to analyse the construction of news\nvalues using corpus linguistic techniques.5 First, there is no closed list of news value\ndevices \u00ad news values can be constructed by an open-ended range of lexical or gram-\nmatical resources (word forms, lemmas, phrases, whole clauses or sentences). This\nmeans that we cannot search the corpus for a defined set of devices. However, as news\ndiscourse is conventionalised, we could search for selected devices that are known to be\ncommonly used in news reporting to construct news values (e.g. temporal markers such\nas last, yesterday, common emotion nouns such as fear, hope, concern or semantically\nrelated adjectives such as unexpected, astonishing, shocking). Additionally, as we argue\nin this study, collocation analysis can be used to identify news values established in the\nimmediate co-text of topic-associated content words (e.g. hurricane).\nSecond, if we consider newsworthiness as a property of texts rather than individual\nitems, we also need to look at how it is constructed intra-textually. For this, we need to\nconsider the text as a coherent communicative event \u00ad reading it horizontally and as a\nwhole \u00ad which is not a recognised strength of corpus approaches (Tognini-Bonelli, 2001:\n19). But where corpus linguistic methods excel is in the identification of inter-textual\npatterns in datasets. In so doing, these methods can help to quantify and identify repeated\nsequences, uncovering common practices and conventions in news reporting. As our\nNo. Semantic tag In subcorpus `Oct.\nIn reference\nsubcorpus `Aug/Sept\nLog\nlikelihood\nFrequency\n(absolute)\nFrequency\n(per mil.)\nFrequency\n(absolute)\nFrequency\n(per mil.)\nstudy has illustrated, corpus techniques can help reveal how phraseologies, figurative\ndevices and rhetorical strategies construct news value. For instance, in the Katrina cor-\npus a cause\u00adeffect relation (Impact) is set up by event (e.g. hurricane) + (the) subsequent\nimpact (e.g. flooding); Superlativeness is constructed through metaphors and personifi-\ncation (hurricane + roared; the hurricane's fury, wrath), and historical comparison (com-\nparable in intensity to hurricane Camille of 1969 . . . only larger).\nThird, the construction of news values is heavily co-text-dependent, because language\nis multifunctional. In Hunston's (2011) words, `the meaning of any word cannot be identi-\nfied reliably if the word is encountered in isolation' (p. 14). Frequency lists and keyness\nmeasures, which calculate occurrences without co-text, can be used as input for hypoth-\neses, but concordancing or collocation analysis needs to be undertaken to identify mean-\nings. With a small corpus, this can be more easily achieved; the corpus allows qualitative\ninvestigation of all or most instances of a given lemma, POS or constituent of semantic\ndomain. It would be possible, for example, to closely examine all indicators of place and\ntime using automatic tagging with follow-up concordancing. When exploring a large cor-\npus (such as the one used in this study), collocation analysis is helpful, but concordancing\nis restricted to randomly thinned samples. There is also the possibility of focusing on just\none news value, as concordancing of more samples is then more manageable.\nWhat are some of the next steps to be taken? More case studies on different topics and\ndifferent types of news corpora are needed, and there are at least two additional methods\nthat need to be tested on large datasets for DNVA: n-grams and p-frames, where word\nforms are not listed in isolation but rather with repeated co-textual patterns.6 On a more\ntheoretical level, the notion of (de)emphasis needs to be investigated in depth. While one\napproach would assume that (de)emphasis correlates with frequency of occurrence (rep-\netition), another approach would be positional. From this perspective, news values that\nare constructed in the summary (Van Dijk, 1988), abstract (Bell, 1991) or nucleus (Feez\net al., 2008) \u00ad headline and opening paragraph \u00ad may be considered as the most empha-\nsised, because this part of the news story arguably comprises the `most important news\nelement of the story in addition to the choice of angle or \"hook\", or approach to the\nthat news story structure can be usefully investigated from a corpus perspective.\nThis study suggests that all tested methods could provide useful insights into the con-\nstruction of newsworthiness in a large corpus. While POStagged lemmas and POStags\nrequire comprehensive follow-up qualitative analysis, semtags appear the most insightful\nin themselves for providing an overview of newsworthiness, and collocation analysis may\nbe useful for identifying news values established in the co-text of topic-associated words.\nFunding\nThis work was supported in part by the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science\nNotes\n1. In this article we focus on language, although the discursive approach incorporates other\n2. No clear pointers to Consonance were identified in the top 200. This might be because it is\nrarely individual word forms that establish this news value, with the exception of certain\nexpressions (e.g. expected, familiar). More research is needed to investigate how Consonance\nis constructed linguistically.\n3. The word novelty is ambiguous, indicating `newness' or `unusuality'. It would be possible to\nre-name Novelty as Unexpectedness and to include newness as a sub-category of Timeliness.\nExpressions such as not, just, no, only, but, while, even may need to be added as resources\nfor Novelty, as negation and contrast/concession are linked to expectations (Bednarek, 2006:\n48\u00ad49). On the other hand, these expressions would be frequent in any corpus, are multifunc-\ntional, and may not necessarily construct newsworthiness.\n4. As the corpus has been tagged using CLAWS7, each instance of punctuation has been tagged\nas itself (e.g. ;_;). These are not collapsible into meaningful units of investigation, and have\nbeen disregarded. Likewise, only unambiguous POStags and semtags have been considered\nfor keyness.\n5. Some of these points also apply to other phenomena, such as evaluation (see Hunston, 2011).\n6. N-grams are `recurring sequences of n words'(McEnery and Hardie, 2012: 41); with p-frames\none slot is variable (e.g. the * of ).\nReferences\nArcher D, Wilson A and Rayson P (2002) Introduction to the USAS category system.
