This population-based study\nis aimed to determine the presence of associations between a wide array of genetic variants and emerging\ncardiovascular risk markers among adult US women.\nMethods: The current analysis was performed among the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III phase 2 samples of adult women aged 17 years and older (sample size n = 3409). Fourteen candidate\ngenes within ADRB2, ADRB3, CAT, CRP, F2, F5, FGB, ITGB3, MTHFR, NOS3, PON1, PPARG, TLR4, and TNF were examined\nfor associations with emerging cardiovascular risk markers such as serum C-reactive protein, homocysteine, uric\nacid, and plasma fibrinogen. Linear regression models were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.0. The\ncovariates included age, race/ethnicity, education, menopausal status, female hormone use, aspirin use, and lifestyle\nfactors.\nResults: In covariate-adjusted models, serum C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly (P value\nConclusion: The significant associations between certain gene variants with concentration variations in serum\nC-reactive protein and homocysteine among adult women need to be confirmed in further genetic association\nstudies.\nBackground\nCoronary heart disease and stroke remain the leading\ncauses of death and disability for men and women in\nthe United States [1,2]. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular\ndisease, which affects the heart, brain, and peripheral\ncirculation, is responsible for the majority of the cases\n[3]. Traditional risk factors cannot fully account for the\nvariation in the prevalence of heart disease in the gen-\neral population. Some biomarkers, including C-reactive\nprotein, fibrinogen, uric acid, and homocysteine, are\namong those which have been proposed as potential\nmodifiable risk factors/markers in the last two decades.\nInflammation plays a key role in the initiation, pro-\ngression, and outcome of atherosclerosis [4,5]. In pro-\nspective studies, markers of inflammation such as C-\nreactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen have been found\nto be predictive of atherosclerosis and an increased risk\nof CVD events [4-16]. Elevated levels of plasma homo-\ncysteine and serum uric acid have been associated with\nincreased risk of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease\n[17-21]. In addition, these emerging cardiovascular risk\nbiomarkers influence each other and are correlated with\nconventional risk factors/markers such as high blood\n* Correspondence: afan@cdc.gov\n1National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA\n\u00a9 2010 Fan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The candidate genes in this\nstudy, i.e., ADRB2, ADRB3, CAT, CRP, F2, F5, FGB,\nhave been suggested to confer excess risk of cardiovas-\ncular disease, although the results are inconsistent from\ndifferent association studies [25]. These candidate genes\nwere selected from a set of variants that were previously\ngenotyped in the NHANES III genetic data [26] and\nwere identified from systematic literature reviews of pre-\nviously published candidate gene association studies and\nThe evidence on the associations of four novel risk\nfactors/markers with these genes may help identify\nintermediate pathways of CVD susceptibility in the gen-\neral population. For example, because genetic traits con-\nfer a risk of inflammation, common gene\npolymorphisms (> 1% frequency in the general popula-\ntion) may explain an individual's likelihood of develop-\ning inflammation or why some have a greater\ninflammatory response than others [34-36]. The\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III DNA bank offers a unique sample to\ncarry out this analysis as it has a large sample size and a\ndiversity of ages, races and ethnicities that is representa-\ntive of the US population. We examined the presence\nand magnitude of associations between candidate\ngenetic variants (n = 27) within ADBR2, ADBR3, CAT,\nPPARG, TLR4, and TNF [26,37] and four cardiovascular\nrisk markers (CRP, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and uric\nacid) among adult women.\nMethods\nStudy Sample\nof the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). The NHANES are complex, mul-\ntistage cross-sectional sample surveys conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nNHANES III included a stratified multistage probability\ndesign to provide national estimates of common diseases\nand their respective risk factors for the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population in the United States ages\ncollection for NHANES occurs at three levels: a brief\nhousehold screener interview, an in-depth household\nsurvey interview, and an extensive medical examination\n[38]. Population weights are calculated for each indivi-\ndual to make the data representative of the US popula-\ntion. In the second phase of NHANES III, white blood\ncells were frozen and cell lines were immortalized with\nthe Epstein- Barr virus, creating a DNA bank. The cur-\nrent analysis was performed among adult women aged\nby the NCHS Ethics Review Board. NHANES III DNA\nbank, selection of candidate genes and variants, genotyp-\ning methods, and quality controls are detailed elsewhere\nGenotyping Methods\nMost genotypes were assayed either by TaqMan (5'\nnuclease assay; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or\nby the MGB Eclipse Assay (3' hybridization triggered\nfluorescence reaction; Nanogen, Bothwell, WA). ADRB2\nand F2 were genotyped using pyrosequencing. Water\ncontrols and DNA samples with known genotypes, pur-\nchased from Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) were\nincluded on each well plate [26].\nBiochemical Analysis\nThe laboratory procedures for the assessment of serum\nC reactive protein, serum uric acid, serum homocysteine\nand plasma fibrinogen are available from the NCHS\nCovariates\nPotential confounders of the gene-outcome relationship\nwere selected a priori.

Other covariates include BMI (< 25 kg/m2,\nfemale hormone use (yes/no), and aspirin use (yes/no).\nDetails on descriptions of covariates are available else-\nStatistical Analysis\nWeighted allele frequencies of genetic variants in the US\npopulation by race/ethnicity using the NHANES III\nphase 2 DNA bank have been presented elsewhere [26].\nDeviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were\ntested in a standard unweighted analysis using Chi-\nsquare goodness-of-fit approach. Point estimates and\n95% confidence intervals for the distribution of the\ndemographic, lifestyle and biomarker variables were cal-\nculated. The Taylor series linearization approach was\nused to estimate the variance for standard errors.\nAdjusted means of the outcome variables (inflamma-\ntion markers) by gene variants were obtained from mul-\ntiple linear regression models. Candidate covariates/\npotential confounders included age, race/ethnicity, edu-\ncation, menopausal status, female hormone use, smoking\nstatus, drinking status, dietary fiber intake, total energy\nintake, physical activity, body mass index, and aspirin\nuse. However, only significant covariates \"in the crude\nmodels\" were retained in fully-adjusted models for a\nspecific marker predicted by certain genetic variants. For\nCRP, total energy intake was excluded; for fibrinogen,\ndietary fiber intake was excluded; for homocysteine,\ndrinking status was excluded; and for uric acid, drinking\nstatus and aspirin use were excluded. Minimally\nadjusted models were also presented with adjustment of\nonly race/ethnicity. We presented adjusted means by\ngenotype [40] and made groupwise comparisons. A P\nvalue  0.05 of the Satterthwaite-adjusted F-statistic in\nfully adjusted models was considered as statistically sig-\nnificant. False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted P values\n(adjusted for a maximum of 27 tests) are presented\nalong with unadjusted P values from Wald Chi-square\ntests. All outcome variables were right-skewed and were\nthus log-transformed before analysis. The analyses were\nperformed in SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.01 (Research Tri-\nangle Institute, NC, 2007) to account for the complex\nsampling design, non-response, and sample weights for\nGenetic Component of NHANES III.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study population based on the\nweighted frequency distribution was 81.3% non-Hispanic\nAmerican.

This population-based genetic association\nstudy provides evidence that some intermediate CVD risk\nmarkers may be influenced by common genetic variants.\nNumerous candidate gene studies have examined the\nrole of inflammatory gene polymorphisms and the risk\nof CVD [41-45]. However, the findings remain inconsis-\ntent and the magnitude of associations remains modest\n[46]. C-Reactive protein is a systemic marker of inflam-\nmation and plays an important role in the pathogenesis\nof atherogenesis and its thrombotic complications.\nPlasma C-Reactive protein concentrations have been\nassociated with CRP polymorphisms [42,43]. Although\nC-Reactive protein concentrations are a strong indepen-\ndent predictor of future vascular events, there has been\nno direct evidence that CRP variants contribute to cardi-\novascular disease phenotypes such as carotid intima-\nmedia thickness or arterial thrombosis [47-49].\nFibrinogen plays a key role in the final step of the coa-\ngulation cascade, i.e., the formation of fibrin; and it is a\nmajor determinant of plasma viscosity and erythrocyte\naggregation. There is a large variation on estimates of\nthe genetic heritability of plasma fibrinogen [44,45]. The\nresearchers who estimated low heritability argued that\nenvironment, rather than genetic influences, has a\ngreater effect on the level of plasma fibrinogen. It is also\nunder debate whether plasma fibrinogen is a primary\nrisk factor/mediator for coronary heart disease, or\nwhether it is a marker for disease [50]. A large cohort\nstudy showed that fibrinogen may partly mediate the\neffects of other risk factors on carotid atherosclerosis,\nthough it may not play a causal role [51]. The evidence\nfrom molecular biology seems to support the view that\nfibrinogen is a marker, rather than a mediator, of vascu-\nlar disease [52]. Whether the association of plasma fibri-\nnogen with the gene polymorphisms found in this\nreport could be replicated in other genetic association\nstudies remains unknown.\nThe findings that serum uric acid levels were asso-\nciated with CRP and TNF polymorphisms need to be\nconfirmed by other studies especially because the asso-\nciation was no longer significant after FDR adjustment.\nThe underlying mechanisms need to be examined. In\nthe literature, uric acid levels have been shown to be\ncorrelated with plasma levels of circulating TNF-alpha\n[53] and increased CRP expression [24]. Other genetic\nvariants have been found to explain the variance in\nPlasma homocysteine is a thiol compound derived\nfrom methionine that is involved in two main metabolic\npathways: the cycle of activated methyl groups, which\nrequires folate and vitamin B12 as cofactors; and the\ntranssulfuration pathway to cystathionine and cysteine,\nwhich requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor.

FDR = false discovery rate.\nplasma homocysteine may be caused by genetic defects\nin enzymes involved in its metabolism or by deficiencies\nin cofactor levels [57]. Although the genetic influence of\nMTHFR polymorphisms on homocysteine levels is well-\nknown, it is under debate whether the MTHFR poly-\nmorphism per se might be an independent contributor\nto cardiovascular risk [58].\nThere are some limitations in this study. First, the\nNHANES DNA bank was set up mainly to assess the\nallele frequency of these genes in a population-based\nsample, but it may not necessarily be one of the strong\nstudy designs to do genetic association studies. Second,\nour candidate genes were not selected based solely on\nexplicit molecular/cellular biological pathways. For\nexample, our study shows significant associations\nbetween ADRB3 and MTHFR genes to be associated\nwith concentrations of serum C-reactive proteins\nalthough ADRB3 was mainly proposed to be a candidate\ngene for blood pressure and MTHFR was for serum\nhomocysteine. The results are not surprising because of\ncomplex pathogenetic connections between immuno-\ninflammatory reactions, elevated homocysteine levels,\nand high blood pressure [59,60]. Third, the four biomar-\nkers investigated in the study are largely influenced by\nenvironmental factors which may not be adequately cap-\ntured by current study.\nWe did not investigate whether genetic and environ-\nmental factors modify each other in these associations.\nFor example, hormone replacement therapy (especially\nestrogen) might be associated with increased inflamma-\ntory activity [61]. How genetic factors interact with\ninflammation-modulating effects of estrogen in causing\nadverse effects on atherogenesis or determining unfavor-\nable clinical outcome is worthy of further investigation.\nFurther studies are also needed to validate findings from\nrecent genome-wide association studies that have\nConclusion\nOur study provides some evidence that genetic factors\ncontribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and\nother CVD risk markers among adult women. Such\nknowledge may lead to improved prevention and treat-\nment efforts. Identifying the variants that may modify\nthe levels of these risk markers may allow for improved\ntargeting and treatment of individuals or populations at\nan increased risk for future CVD events.\nAdditional file 1: Supplemental Tables.
