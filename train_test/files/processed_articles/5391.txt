From an evolutionary perspective, this\nasymmetry may explain many differences between men and women, for instance a\ndifference in sources of jealousy between the sexes (Buss, Larsen, Westen, and\nSemmelroth, 1992), a tendency for men to try and control women's sexuality in order to\nprevent cuckoldry, and a greater need by men for reassurances over their paternity\nIn this study, we explored sex asymmetries present (or absent) as a response to a\nhypothetical scenario in which, suddenly, new information about paternal and maternal\nHypothetical parental discovery\nrelatedness becomes available. If paternity uncertainty has been a prominent force shaping\nmale behavior, we would expect men to react in a more negative way than women when\ndiscovering that their child does not carry their own genes. On the other hand, as female\nreproductive potential is more limited than that of males, women have more to lose when\ninvesting in unrelated offspring. Rationally, it may be that women react in a more negative\nway than men\nwhen finding out that the offspring is not genetically related to them. Before describing the\nstudy, we briefly review two literatures: one on sex differences in parenting investment and\none on rigid versus flexible responses to parental uncertainly.\nSex differences in parental investment\nAccording to parental investment theory, men and women face different trade-offs\nbetween mating and parenting, resulting in a host of putative hard-wired sex differences in\npsychological mechanisms (Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999). The basic asymmetry is not\nspecific to humans. Female mammals, in almost all circumstances, invest more in their\noffspring than males do and can be confident that the offspring shares their genes. As a\nconsequence, males can enhance their reproductive success by pursuing multiple mating\nopportunities (but see Kokko and Jennions, 2008 for discussion), whereas female fitness\ncan be enhanced by choosing partners with good genes and/or resources. Indeed, one\ncommon view is that males are competitive and promiscuous, and females are coy and\nThere has been great interest in investigating the effects of genetic relatedness on\npaternal care-giving (e.g., Anderson, Kaplan, Lam, and Lancaster, 1999; Anderson,\nKaplan, and Lancaster, 2007), but this literature has largely ignored women. For example,\nwe know that there is a relationship between mating and parenting effort. Men are most\nlikely to invest resources in offspring (whether they are the genetic father or not) if they are\nin a relationship with the mother. Hence, male parenting might reflect future reproductive\nopportunities with the mother of that offspring (Anderson, 2000), as well as increase the\nsurvival and well-being of purported genetic descendants (Geary, 2000), both of which may\nhave a function in increasing men's fitness (Anderson, 2000). The parental conflict\nliterature has focused on female choice for partners (e.g., Alonzo, 2010) and has not\nconsidered women's parental investment as a function of relatedness. Because the\nreproductive rate of females is much lower than that of males, bringing up unrelated\nchildren is more costly to women in terms of decrease in lifetime reproductive success.\nWomen may have evolved mechanisms to increase reproductive success in terms of an\nincreased desire for biological children (Brase and Brase, 2012; Rotkirch, 2007), and this\nlonging seems to translate into a positive experience, especially in women who are in an\nestablished relationship (Adair, Brase, Akao, and Jantsch, 2014). Furthermore, some\nstudies in this area have shown that women have a harder time coping with adoption\n(Goldberg, Kinkler, and Hines, 2011) and rearing step-children (MacDonald and DeMaris,\n1996) than men have. Because women's life-time reproductive span is shorter than that of\nmen, one would expect women to experience more negative emotions than men when\ninvesting time in genetically unrelated children. Circumventing female choice may have\nhigh reproductive costs for women (see Apostolou, 2013, for a discussion of rape), but this\nhas not, to our knowledge, been studied in humans. One of the aims of the present study is\nto address sex differences in parenting-related emotions and decisions in scenarios where\nHypothetical parental discovery\ngenetic relatedness with the offspring is manipulated (Buss and Malamuth, 1996). Our\nstudy is based on self-reports in response to hypothetical scenarios. This study will need to\nbe complemented in the future by other approaches.\nAlthough women's fitness can be enhanced by choosing a mate with good genes,\nthere is little research investigating parenting behavior in situations where females conceive\noffspring with a male they did not choose. Data on children conceived as a result of rape\nsuggest that women may feel alienated from the child, but this could be due to the trauma\ncaused by forced copulation (Ee and Kleber, 2013). Although new reproductive\ntechnologies have resulted in an increase of pregnancies with unintended genetic material\n(Liebler, 2002), there are as of yet no systematic studies looking at emotional differences\nbetween the sexes when discovering that the other sex gamete was that of a stranger.\nThe role of knowledge and rational choice\nIt seems reasonable that some aspects of human evolution have shaped human\nbehavior and emotional responses. However, evolutionary arguments have also been\ncriticized. In their review on sex differences Wood and Eagly (2002) contrast an essentialist\napproach, common within evolutionary psychology, and a social constructionist approach,\nmore common within the social sciences. The essentialist stance describes differences\nbetween men and women as originating from evolutionary pressures (Caporael, 2001). The\nsocial constructivist approach focuses on social pressures, stereotypes, and cultural patterns\nthat cause and reaffirm the roles of each sex. The two are not, however, mutually exclusive.\nA fundamental difficulty in making claims about underlying mechanisms is that\nchoices that make sense from an evolutionary perspective may also make sense from a\nrational standpoint. The feelings that one experiences towards a son who is adopted may\ndepend on a bias towards investing in one's own genes, but it can also depend on a generic\nself-serving bias that makes everybody more positively inclined towards the self and what\nis more directly linked with the self, including, for instance, our own name (Nuttin, 1985).\nIn other words, a self-serving bias may increase fitness but multiple self-serving biases may\nall stem from a generic egocentric predisposition rather than specific evolved mechanisms.\nMoreover, rational choices are not necessarily conscious (Reder and Schunn, 1996)\ncreating a problem in the interpretation of what people may report.\nAn interesting example is the response to faces that look like one's own. Both men\nand women find self-resembling faces attractive, but there is contradictory evidence about\nhow people react to self-resemblance in the faces of infants. In some studies the preference\nwas stronger in men (Platek, Burch, Panyavin, Wasserman, and Gallup, 2002), whereas in\nothers it was absent (DeBruine, 2004) or stronger in females (Bressan, Bertamini, Nalli,\nThe fact that differences between men and women in parenting are widespread does\nsupport the hypothesis that they represent essential differences between the sexes. On the\nother hand, maternal certainty and paternal uncertainty are well known facts that may affect\nindividual behavior and culture because they are important and universal aspects of human\nlife. Evolutionary psychology faces a well-known problem: It is impossible to change the\nworld to test the hypothesis that human behavior would remain constant (at least in the\nshort term) even if conditions were to drastically change. Such impossible manipulation\ncan be tried at least as a thought experiment, or within a science fiction scenario.\nHypothetical parental discovery\nScience fiction scenario\nIn this study, we attempted an \"impossible\" experiment. To do so, we placed\nparticipants in the only place in which unimaginable things can take place: a science fiction\nnarrative (see Appendix 1). Participants read one of the possible hypothetical scenarios in\nwhich the baby was not from the chosen egg/sperm donor (Not-other condition) or the baby\nwas genetically not theirs (Not-you condition) and then rated their reactions to the\nscenarios. The narratives were identical for both sexes, creating symmetry in parental\nuncertainty. In addition, in our narratives, gestation does not take place in the womb,\nremoving another reproductive difference between men and women.\nLet us assume that paternal uncertainty has shaped the male psyche in such a way\nthat men will alter their disposition and their behavior towards a baby on the basis of the\nlikelihood that that baby carries their own genes. This may emerge in various ways, and\ndoes not need to be under conscious awareness. Although infanticide is relatively rare,\nbabies are much more likely to be killed by stepfathers than by genetic fathers (Daly and\nWilson, 1988). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the paternal response to finding out\nthat a baby is not genetically related to them will be much stronger than the response to\nfinding out that a baby is not genetically related to the partner. We can also formulate an\nalternative hypothesis: Perhaps the importance of knowing that a child carries our own\ngenes will be just as strong for mothers. It is possible that children who share genes with\ntheir parents are seen as more valuable, for generic egotistic reasons. Let us call this the\negocentric hypothesis. The key test, therefore, will be whether the egocentric effect will be\nstronger for men than for women. If so, there will be an interaction between type of mistake\n(self and donor) and sex of the participant (men and women).\nIn summary, we investigated sex-differences in two hypothetical situations relating\nto parenting: a situation where a child is not genetically related to the parent, and a situation\nwhere a child is genetically related to the parent, but conceived with a person who the\nindividual did not choose. We expected that due to higher constraints in female\nreproductive potential, and perhaps due to social pressures, women would have stronger\nnegative emotions than men in both situations. It is also possible that men are more affected\nby the situation where the child carries the genes of the partner, but not theirs, because of\nthe similarity between this situation and that of cuckoldry. We also included relationship\nstatus, as being in a stable relationship is a strong predictor of the intention to have\nbiological children (Schoen, Astone, Kim, Nathanson, and Fields, 1999) and, at least in\nmen, predicts the investment in related and non-related offspring (Anderson, 2000).\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nIn total, 1,186 participants filled in an on-line survey on \"Fertility, conception, and\nsexuality,\" advertised on an on-line participation website. To make the sample more\nuniform, we decided to exclude individuals who were non-heterosexual, did not report their\nsex, or were under the age of 18. We were left with a sample of 1,007 volunteers (343 men,\nnot reported; 525 British, 482 Other). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of\nthe University of Liverpool. No payment or credit system was used to attract participants.\nHypothetical parental discovery\nProcedure\nAfter reading an information page and giving consent, participants were directed to\na page with a set of demographic questions (sex, age, sexual orientation, relationship\nstatus). Following this, participants read a hypothetical science fiction vignette on a\nsituation where babies were created in a baby-lab (http://www.liv.ac.uk/vp/sf_intro.html).\nBased on random assignment participants were either in a condition where, due to a\nmistake, (i) the baby was not genetically related to the participant (n = 505), or (ii)\ngenetically related, but the sex gamete of the other parent was not one chosen by the\nAfter reading the story, participants were asked to rate (i) How upsetting they would\nfind the situation (1 = Not at all upsetting, 10 = Extremely upsetting, (ii) How much an\neffect this would have on their relationship with the child (1 = No effect, 10 = A great\neffect), (iii) How likely would they be to keep the baby (1 = Very unlikely, 10 = Very\nlikely), and (iv) How angry they would be to the lab for the mistake (1 = Not angry, 10 =\nVery angry).\nData analysis\nTo investigate the interactions between sex, relationship status, and experimental\ncondition on the reactions to the vignettes, we conducted a multivariate analysis of\nvariance, controlling for age and the number of existing children. This was followed by\nunivariate ANOVA's to investigate the interactions further. We also conducted t-tests in\norder to reveal any significant main effects and simple main effects between the\nindependent variables.\nResults\nIn Table 1 and Figure 1, we report the descriptive statistics for each experimental\ncondition, broken down by sex and relationship status.\nTable 1.

The between-participants IV's were sex (male, female),\ncondition (not your genes, not chosen gametes), and relationship status (single, in a\nrelationship). The dependent variables were ratings for (i) how upsetting they would find\nthe situation, (ii) effect on their relationship with the child, (iii) likelihood of keeping the\nbaby, and (iv) anger evoked by the mistake. Table 2 shows the multivariate statistical\nvalues for the analyses.\nWe found a significant interaction between the experimental condition and\nrelationship status, sex and relationship status, and significant main effects on condition,\nsex, and relationship status (see Table 2). In order to investigate the multivariate ANOVA\nfurther, we conducted univariate and pairwise tests for each dependent variable separately.\nFor clarity, we only report the significant interactions here, but an interested reader can\ncontact the authors for full results. Significant interactions were found between condition\nHypothetical parental discovery\nand relationship status for (i) perceived relationship with the child, F(1, 1000) = 4.92, p <\n= .01. Individuals who were currently partnered in the \"not chosen gametes\" condition\nthought their relationship with the child would be less affected (M = 2.66, SD = 2.05)\nTable 2.

Participants were less likely to keep the baby (t[1005] = -6.71, p <\nthe child is not genetically related to them compared to the condition where the other sex\ngamete was not the chosen one (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Lastly, we analyzed the\ndifferences between men and women in their reactions, and found that although women felt\nHypothetical parental discovery\nDiscussion\nParticipants felt more negative when the baby was not carrying their own genes,\nhighlighting the importance of genetic relatedness on parenting emotions irrespective of the\nsex of the individual. Women felt angrier than men, but were more likely to keep the baby.\nStronger negative reactions could be a reflection of the higher lifetime reproductive cost\nincurred by women who (i) have had their mate choice options removed by conceiving with\na potentially low-quality male, or (ii) invest expensive reproductive time in bringing up\ngenetically unrelated children. This finding is consistent with the \"baby-fever\" research\nsuggesting that women have a stronger and fundamental drive to have children that are\ntheir genetic progeny (Brase and Brase, 2012; Rotkirch, 2007). However, despite stronger\nnegative emotions, women were more likely than men to keep the baby in both conditions.\nAccording to work by Sarah Hrdy and colleagues (Hrdy, 1999, 2009), cooperative breeding\nand allomothering played a key role in human evolution (Burkart, Hrdy, and Van Schaik,\n2009), and could provide a plausible explanation for the higher likelihood of keeping the\nbaby despite stronger negative emotions. Experimental evidence suggests that women have\nevolved greater sensitivity to infants, possibly as a proximate mechanism for maintaining\nallomothering behavior (C\u00e1rdenas, Harris, and Becker, 2013). The higher likelihood of\nwomen in our study keeping a child could be based on the same mechanisms. Future work\nshould investigate the nature of sex differences between behavior (i.e., keeping the child)\nand emotions and feelings towards the child and the situation. Women may have evolved a\nhigher sensitivity to signals of need, resulting in care-giving behavior, but may still\nexperience frustration because of the high fitness costs.\nRelationship status of the participants played a role in the decision to keep the\ngenetically unrelated child. Participants who were currently in a relationship were more\nlikely to keep a genetically unrelated baby than single participants were and thought that\ntheir relationship with the child would be less affected. It is possible that partnered\nindividuals are more ready to make positive decisions about parenting, even when they are\nconsidering a child without the input of the current partner. Current relationship status has\nbeen identified as an important variable in mating-related decisions (Burriss,\nMarcinkowska, and Lyons, 2013; Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2002).\nEspecially in men, relationship affects the investment in current offspring irrespective of\ngenetic relatedness, which could be a tool for securing future offspring with the partner\n(Anderson, 2000), as well as increase the survival and well-being of the supposed genetic\noffspring (Geary, 2000). It is possible that being in a relationship changes the attitudes that\npeople have about children, and makes them more positive about the idea of being a parent.\nWe come now to the discussion of what was not confirmed by the data. In the\nintroduction we have discussed some reasons why men may be more sensitive to\ndiscovering that the genes were not theirs. It is possible that men have evolved a host of\nanatomical, physiological, and psychological anti-cuckoldry mechanisms, as paternity\nuncertainty has been a recurrent problem during evolutionary history (Goetz and\nShackelford, 2009). If these psychological mechanisms did exist, men would be expected\nto have a much stronger negative attitude towards discovering that a child that they are\ncaring for is not carrying their own genes. On this basis, we predicted an interaction\nbetween condition and sex, which was not present. One possibility is that the vignettes lack\necological validity and do not reflect how people would react in real life. Another\nHypothetical parental discovery\npossibility is that we succeeded in making the hypothetical situation symmetrical and that\nmale and female behavior was symmetrical as a consequence, as predicted by theories that\nstress the rationality of human reproductive choices.\nIn conclusion, we provided evidence for sex differences in the responses to\nhypothetical scenarios that were similar for both sexes. We found that women reported\nmore negative emotions but also a higher likelihood of keeping the baby, demonstrating a\npossible conflict between parenting emotions and actual behaviors. Parenting decisions are\nlikely to be based on a host of rational and instinctive mechanisms (Chasiotis, Hofer, and\nCampos, 2006), and future research should concentrate on detangling the role of conscious\nand unconscious decision making in parental investment.\nReferences\nAdair, L.
