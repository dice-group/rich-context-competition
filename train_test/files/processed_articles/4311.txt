The present study\nexamines the perspectives of 34 parents regarding the adult outcomes for their children who experienced emotional and\nbehavioral problems in their youth. Participants completed an online survey containing questions about their child's behavioral\ncharacteristics, educational experiences, and adjustment to adulthood as well as questions about the stress they experienced\nas a parent of a child with EBD. Both quantitative and qualitative measures were used to assess parents' perceptions of factors\naffecting their child's successful or unsuccessful adult outcomes. Remaining in school was related to positive adult outcomes,\nwhile exclusionary disciplinary experiences such as suspension and expulsion were related to negative adult outcomes.\nThe relationship of results to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act's goals for adult functioning and\nimplications for both parents and practitioners serving students with EBD are discussed.\n",

Such children may be considered to have an\nemotional or behavioral disorder, usually categorized either\nusing the classification system of the schools or the mental\nhealth system. The Individuals With Disabilities Education\ndefines emotional disturbance by both the presence of mal-\nadaptive behavior and negative educational impact as crite-\nria. Descriptors of the disability include an inability to learn\nthat cannot be explained by other factors; an inability to\nbuild satisfactory relationships with peers and teachers; inap-\npropriate behavior or feelings under normal circumstances; a\ngeneral pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression; and\nthe tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associ-\n(4)(i)(A-E). In order for a student to be found eligible for an\nIndividualized Educational Plan (IEP), at least one of the\nindicators must be present, must be serious, extend over\ntime, and have a negative impact on the child's educational\nprogress. In contrast, mental health professionals utilize the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th\ned., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR;American PsychiatricAssociation,\n2000) to classify children with mental disorders. The DSM-\nIV-TR system is multiaxial covering a broader range of diag-\nnoses, including severity levels and etiology, than IDEIA.\nAs schools and mental health organizations use different\nclassification systems to identify children who need their\nrespective services, it is therefore possible for children who\nhave a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis to be found ineligible for\nschool-based special education services due to the absence of\na negative impact on educational progress. It is very difficult\nto separate the literature clearly based on the distinct but\noverlapping nosological systems. The relevant difference\nwhen discussing education outcomes is the IDEIA require-\nment that emotional or behavioral problems have a negative\nimpact on educational achievement. While it is true that\nschools are bound by law to use the IDEIA definitions, it is\nalso true that children with emotional problems not covered\nby IDEIA exist. For the purpose of this study, both children\nwith emotional and behavioral disabilities classified by\neither IDEIA or the DSM series will be referred to as children\nwith emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD).\nNotwithstanding identification by IDEIA of some chil-\ndren and adolescents who have significant mental health\nconcerns, there remain unmet needs of children and adoles-\ncents with behavior problems in schools who are either iden-\ntified by DSM criteria alone or are not identified at all.

These same goals for transi-\ntion to adulthood have been recognized for children with\ndisabilities, and these universal goals were made explicit in\nthe most recent reauthorization of IDEIA. However, despite\nprogress since the passage of initial federal special education\nlegislation in 1975, students with disabilities have lagged\nbehind typically developing peers in achieving adult inde-\npendence. In recognition of this situation, Congressional\nfindings in the preamble to the 2004 reauthorization of\nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reaffirm\nand reinforce that the purpose of Special Education is to pre-\npare students for \"further education, employment, and inde-\nCongress noted that \"providing effective transition services\nto promote successful post-school employment or education\nis an important measure of accountability for children with\nAlthough these goals historically have been present in\nlaw, the 2004 reauthorization put particular emphasis on\ntransition services to improve overall outcomes in these\nareas. Much previous research has focused on single out-\ncome measures that report graduation rates (U. S. Department\nof Education, 2008) or employment outcomes (Zigmond,\n2006), rather than multidimensional measures of adult func-\ntioning (K. H. Armstrong, Dedrick, & Greenbaum, 2003).\nThe aforementioned research has led to a general consensus\nthat outcomes for EBD students in young adulthood are not\npositive, confirming the necessity of Congressional intent to\nstrengthen transition services to improve adult functioning in\nthe community through postsecondary education, employ-\nment, and independent living.\nAlthough disability legislation under IDEIA includes\ntransition services for students with EBD by teaching skills\nneeded for independent functioning in young adulthood,\nnevertheless, the educational experiences that these students\nreceive often are negative. Since the passage of the Safe\ntices such as suspension and expulsion increasingly have\nbeen used as schools adopt \"zero tolerance\" approaches to\ndiscipline. Such practices have been found to be arbitrarily\ndelivered in many cases and to be used disproportionately\noften for children with disabilities and minority students,\nparticularly African American males (Aud, KewalRamani, &\nEBD have been suspended or expelled in elementary or mid-\ndle school, while 73% have been suspended or expelled in\nhigh school (SRI International, 2006; Wagner, Kutash,\nDuchnowski, Epstein, & Sumi, 2005). In comparison, in\n2005, the U.S. expulsion rate for general education students\nalone, more recent data indicated the overall expulsion rate\nfor general education students is approximately 3% (Stillwell,\nSable, & Plotts, 2011) whereas for high school students with\nStudents affected by these and other negative school\nexperiences are more likely to drop out before comple-\nting high school, and students with EBDs have been found\nto have the highest drop-out rate (55.9%) among stud-\nents receiving special education or general education (U.S.\nDepartment of Education, 2003; U.S. Department of\nEducation, Office of Special Education Programs, 2007).\nApproximately 61% of students labeled EBD drop out of\nschool and only 32% graduate compared to 75% of students\ngraduating nationally in the United States (U.S. Department\n2001). Furthermore, high-stakes testing mandated by the\nNo Child Left Behind Act of 2002 was predicted to con-\ntinue to increase the overall drop-out rate (Schargel, 2003,\n2011) and that has indeed been borne out by other research-\ners (McNeil, Coppola, Radigan, & Vasquez Heilig, 2008).\nthe General Educational Development (GED) high school\nequivalency test self-reported mental health concerns as\ncontributing to their school failure and dropping out (Koller\n& Bertel, 2006). Historically, relatively few students with\nEBD have gone on to postsecondary education (Rogers &\nRogers, 2001) and this trend appears to be continuing, with\napproximately one third of students with mental health\nproblems pursuing any postsecondary educational program,\n20% enrolling in 2-year community colleges and fewer\nthan 6% entering 4-year colleges according to the National\nLongitudinal Transition Study\u00ad2 (Government\nOther postschool outcomes are also poor for students with\nEBD. There are high rates of unstable employment, unem-\nployment, poverty, restricted social networks in the commu-\nnity, and criminal behavior in students with EBD who do not\ncontinue to postsecondary education (Bradley, Doolittle, &\nand Mental Health Services Administration, 2008). When\nstudents with EBD reach the age at which transition to\nWynne et al. 3\nadulthood begins, their rates of substance abuse and criminal\nactivity rise to well above the norm as has been shown for\nover a decade (Greenbaum et al., 1996; Janz & Banbury,\nAs two decades of research indicate, children and ado-\nlescents with EBD have both negative school experiences\nand poor young adult outcomes despite normal or near-\nnormal cognitive functioning. To improve outcomes for\nstudents who have experienced severe problems in school,\nhome\u00adschool\u00adcommunity collaboration is even more\nimportant than it is for typical students according to the\nNational Association of School Psychologists (NASP;\nQuinn & Lee, 2007). In addition, major U.S. initiatives\nhave long recognized the crucial role parental involvement\nplays in improving schools in both general and special\neducation settings (No Child Left Behind Act, 2002; Sailor,\n2002) and this continues to be true (K. J. Anderson &\nfor effective parent\u00adschool partnerships and collaboration\nto develop, trust and nurturance are essential. Trust is nec-\nessary for the home\u00adschool relationship to flourish; while\nnurturance involves treating all team members with\nwarmth and recognizing the unique expertise that each\nbrings to the table. A nurturing communication style is\ndevoid of judgment and negative stereotyping between\nschool and community partners (Eagle, Dowd-Eagle, &\nSheridan, 2008). For parents to trust school professionals\nthey must feel that school professionals understand their\nunique perspectives and experiences with their children.\nUnfortunately, parents of students with EBD may be\navoidant of contact with the school because past interactions\nmay have been contentious and challenging (Wang, Dishion,\nStormshak, & Willett, 2011). Although accusations are coun-\nterproductive and raise tension, professionals tend to blame\nparents for children's behavior problems (Hinshaw, 2005) to\nsuch a degree that as a group, parents of children with EBD\nare viewed unidimensionally as either inadequate caregivers\nor directly contributory to their children's problems (Home,\nlittle research has examined the ecological impact a child\nwith EBD has on the family and the family's functioning\n(Wang et al., 2011). Children and adolescents who fit either\nthe IDEIA or DSM definitions of emotional and behavioral\nproblems present challenging behavior problems for their\nparents (M. I. Armstrong, Birnie-Lefcovitch, & Ungar, 2005;\nOlive & Liu, 2005). Parents of a child with EBD experience\nextra strain (Scharlach et al., 2006; Taylor-Richardson,\nHeflinger, & Brown, 2006), more challenges in meeting both\nfamily and work demands (Rosenzweig, Brennan, & Ogilvie,\n2002), and more parenting stress than parents of normally\ndeveloping children (M. I. Armstrong et al., 2005; Williford,\nFurthermore, studies have shown that children with\nemotional and behavioral problems are costly to raise and\neducate, for society in general, and presumably, for parents\nas well (Cohen, Miller, & Rossman, 1994; Loeber, Burke,\nyears ago Cohen (1998) found that the cost to society of a\nsingle high-risk youth dropping out of school and engaging\nin criminal behavior ranged between US$1.7 and US$2.3\nmillion dollars; this figure would be approximately US$2.4\ndisabilities, emotional and behavioral problems are the\nmost expensive concerns to treat in North America (J. A.\nAnderson, McIntyre, Rotto, & Robertson, 2002; Bradley\net al., 2008); and use of public services throughout youth\nand adulthood by children with behavior problems is 10\ntimes higher than for children with no conduct problems\n(Foster & Jones, 2005). Studies show that in addition to\nrelational and overall stress, having a child with an emo-\ntional disability includes significant economic burden (M. I.\nArmstrong et al., 2005). Low-income families are particu-\nlarly vulnerable to out of pocket expenses for their child\nwith emotional disabilities (Newacheck, Inkelas, & Kim,\n2004). In addition to creating an economic burden on the\nfamily, perceived financial strain also has a negative impact\non children across many domains, including use of positive\nparenting practices, a child's self-esteem (Reichman,\nCorman, & Noonan, 2008), use of mental health services\n(Brannan, Heflinger, & Foster, 2003; Costello, Compton,\nKeeler, & Angold, 2003), and increased behavioral prob-\nlems including impulsivity, antisocial behavior, and depres-\nsion (Ryan, Boxmeyer, & Lochman, 2009; Wadsworth,\nRaviv, Compas, & Connor-Smith, 2005). These relation-\nships between perceived financial strain and negative out-\ncomes apply to families across all-income levels.\nParents are charged with the primary responsibility of car-\ning for their children. Federal law as delineated by the\nSupreme Court of the United States regards parents as the\nfirst and best advocates for their children (Winkelman v.\nParma City School District, 2007), but many school person-\nnel view parents of students with EBD as difficult to work\nwith and often blame them for their children's problems\ntime in school with teachers or at home with parents and par-\nents have valuable information that is necessary to gain a\nbroader understanding of the child. According to both IDEIA\n(2004) and independent research on home\u00adschool collabora-\ntion, parents should have an equal role in decision-making\nprocesses for effective home\u00adschool collaboration to achieve\npositive outcomes for children (Christenson & Thurlow,\n2004). If children are having problems in school, home\u00ad\nschool collaboration is even more important than for typi-\ncally developing children (Quinn & Lee, 2007). Therefore,\ngaining the parents' perspective is invaluable to education\nprofessionals serving children with EBD.\nResearch has not examined parent perspectives on out-\ncomes for adult children with EBD in regard to achieving\nIDEIA transition goals. The IDEIA goals of postsecondary\neducation, independent living, and financial independence\n4 SAGE Open\nare realistically attainable for this population, more so than\nfor children with severe cognitive and physical disabilities.\nLittle attention has been given to whether or not children\nwith EBD do achieve these goals as young adults, the degree\nof caregiving strain experienced by parents while raising\nchildren with EBD, the relationship between parental finan-\ncial strain and young adult outcome, and parent attributions\nrelating to their children's success or lack of success as\nadults. In addition, as much of the literature on children with\nEBD explicitly addresses low\u00adsocioeconomic status (SES)\nfamilies, it is important to consider the experiences of par-\nents who had adequate access to financial resources for child\nrearing to filter out the direct effects of poverty on attainment\nof IDEIA goals. This study examines the relationship\nbetween adult outcomes for children with EBD and IDEIA\ntransition goals, as well as parental strain, financial impact,\nand parental attributions of their child's adult outcome for\nfamilies who are not beset by a large number of social and\neconomic problems\nResearch Questions\nResearch Questions 1: How do adult children's outcomes\ncompare with IDEIA goals of post\u00adhigh school educa-\ntion, employment, and independent living from the\nparents' perspective?\nResearch Questions 2: How stressful do parents find car-\ning for a child/adolescent with emotional and behav-\nioral problems at differing ages?\nResearch Questions 3: Does perceived parental financial\nstrain affect the child's adult outcome?\nResearch Questions 4: To what do parents attribute their\nadult child's success or lack of success?\nMethod\nParticipant Characteristics\nParticipants included 34 parents of children 18 or older who\nexperienced moderate to severe emotional or behavioral\nproblems in childhood or adolescence. The respondents were\noverwhelmingly female, with 31 females and 3 males, 85%\nCaucasian, and had a median age range of 50 to 55 years.\nThe parents' median educational level fell within the \"col-\nlege graduate\" range and 7 of the respondents received grad-\nuate or professional degrees. During their children's school\nyears, the SES of the respondents was more normally distrib-\nuted than education, with 28% of respondents describing\nthemselves as working class or below, 36% as middle class,\nand 28% as upper-middle class, with 8% as \"very poor/\nunemployed.\" By the time the child graduated from high\nschool, 28% described themselves as working class or below,\n30% as middle class, and 42% as upper-middle class with no\nrespondent endorsing \"very poor/unemployed.\"\nSampling Procedures\nRecruitment of parents of children with EBD for research is\nparticularly challenging due to the stigma associated with this\ndisability. It can be difficult for researchers to locate adequate\nsamples of adults who experienced EBD as children/adoles-\ncents or their parents. Having an \"invisible disability,\" the\nstigma of mental illness, and negative stereotyping of parents\nof children with EBD (Marsh, 2004) contribute to the diffi-\nculty in finding participants for follow-up studies. The devel-\nopment of online support forums for parents of children with\nEBD created a space where family members could communi-\ncate with others with similar child-rearing experiences away\nfrom the judgment of the public eye. The existence of these\nforums also gave researchers access to a national pool of par-\nticipants that heretofore would have been very difficult to\ncontact. There are advantages to studying parents who are\nonline support group members including wide geographic\nsampling frame, anonymity, and ease of data collection\nthrough online survey techniques.\nBecause the numbers of parents of adults who experi-\nenced emotional and behavioral problems as children is a\nsmall part of the population of parents of all children with\ndisabilities, invitations were posted on three online parent\nforums frequented by parents of children, adolescents, and\nyoung adults with emotional and behavioral problems to\nrecruit participants. The anonymity of both the participants\nand the names of the websites was guaranteed to obtain the\napproval of both the website owners and the institutional\nreview board (IRB) at the sponsoring university. Participants\nvolunteered by clicking on an active link on an invitation that\ntook them to the consent form approved by the IRB. Upon\naccepting the terms of the consent, the participants were\ndirected to the anonymous survey.As parent participants vol-\nunteered for inclusion in the study by completing a survey,\nand because the number of parents with qualifying children\nwho visited the support group sites during the 30 days the\nsurvey was available is unknown, there is no way to calculate\nthe response rate for the survey. Furthermore, as with all\nanonymous surveys, there is no way to verify that nonre-\nsponders are comparable with responders.\nParents rated their adult children on many dimensions,\nincluding their perception of whether the child's transition to\nadulthood was successful or unsuccessful (description\nbelow). To be included in this study, an adult child must have\nbeen rated in the highest two categories (successful/extremely\nsuccessful) or in the lowest two categories (unsuccessful/\nextremely unsuccessful) on the 7-point index and have con-\ngruent parental verbal descriptions of the adult child's cur-\nrent status. As there were 17 parents who rated their adult\nchild in the successful groups and 43 who rated their child in\nthe unsuccessful groups, 17 were randomly drawn by com-\nputer from the 43 in the unsuccessful groups to provide a\ntotal sample size of 34 parents.\nWynne et al. 5\nMeasures and Constructs\nSurvey Instrument. The measures below were operational-\nized in a survey particularly designed to address the\nresearch questions in this study. In addition to the indices\ndescribed below, parents also provided information\nregarding their adult child's type of education--general\nor special; presence of a behavior intervention plan; high-\nest educational level completed; parent rating of child\nbehavior; presence of DSM diagnoses; and mental health\nservices obtained by parents outside of school settings. In\naddition, parents supplied demographic information\nabout themselves. Parents rated their child's behavior at\nthree separate stages, including preschool, elementary/\nmiddle school, and high school, to detect differences\nthroughout the child's development. The Caregiver Strain\nQuestionnaire (CGSQ) was included in its entirety,\nalthough in the survey document, it was presented to\nrespondents as a matrix that was not designated by spe-\ncific name to avoid bias.\nDefinition of \"Successful\" and \"Unsuccessful.\"The revision of\nIDEIA in 2004 highlights the importance of students in spe-\ncial education pursuing the same goals of postsecondary\neducation, employment, and independent living as typical\nyoung adults. Not only are these goals applicable to students\nin general and special education, but they also largely tran-\nscend racial, cultural, and language differences in that chang-\ning one's status from that of a dependent child to an\nindependent adult is not only present in groups within the\nUnited States but also internationally (Arnett, 2001).\nAlthough the exact formulation of \"success\" might vary\nacross groups, in the United States, most parents hope their\nchildren will complete their education, obtain employment,\nand assume adult functions commensurate with their abili-\nties. Therefore, achieving the goals of postsecondary educa-\ntion, employment, and independent living in some form may\nbe assumed to be part of a parental definition of \"successful\"\ntransition to adulthood; however, for young adults with\nchildhood EBD, it was unknown what definitions of being\n\"successful\" adults their parents would hold. Experienced\nparents should be able to determine their child's attainment\nof various developmental milestones that mark adulthood\nand are encompassed by IDEIA goals within the context of\nthe severity of the adult's child/adolescent problems and\ntheir own cultural expectations. Given the belief that parents\nare valuable sources of information about their child's over-\nall functioning, their subjective ratings and open-ended\ndescriptions of their child's success or lack of success were\nobtained. We wanted parents to evaluate their adult child's\nadjustment to adulthood with \"all things considered\" because\nno a priori list of criteria or examples of success or lack of\nsuccess would be universally applicable to this very diverse\nsample of adults who experienced EBD as children. An\nimplicit purpose of this study was to determine how a\n\"successful\" adult or an \"unsuccessful\" adult with childhood\nEBD is described from the perspective of the child's parent.\nTo address this aim in a comprehensive manner, three types\nof parent measures of successful and unsuccessful adjust-\nment to adulthood were used: a 7-point index that ranged\nfrom \"extremely successful\" to \"extremely unsuccessful,\" a\ndichotomous forced choice (successful\u00adunsuccessful), and a\nqualitative narrative question that was used to verify what\nparents meant by \"success\" or \"lack of success\" and to what\nthey attributed their child's successful or unsuccessful adult\noutcome.\nThe CGSQ.The CGSQ (Brannan, Heflinger, & Bickman,\nall a problem) to 5 (very much a problem). To account for\npossible differences in the strain at various times in the\nchild's development, parents were asked to rate their child at\nthree ages: preschool, elementary/middle school, and high\nschool. An aggregated mean score was obtained for each par-\nent based on their recollection of stress throughout the child's\ndevelopment. The CGSQ has been factor analyzed, and the\nresulting indices were evaluated for internal consistency in\nthis sample using Cronbach's alpha. Consistent with the lit-\nerature, high Cronbach's alpha measures were obtained. The\nalphas, means, and standard deviations for the factors are as\nfollows: Objective Caregiver Strain,  = .94, x = 3.26, SD =\nSD = 1.017. In addition to the three factors identified by\nBrannan et al. (1997), a fourth index was constructed to mea-\nsure financial stain using two items from the CGSQ related\nto financial consequences of caring for a child with behavior\nproblems (4. Family member having to do without things;\nand 7. Financial strain). This index, which yielded an  = .89,\nunanticipated very high level of parent purchased mental\nhealth services and was analyzed separately from the original\nindices.\nEducational Attainment.Parents were asked to report their\nchild's highest grade completed; whether the child com-\npleted high school, and if so, whether a diploma or GED was\nobtained; and whether their child had pursued any postsec-\nondary education. The responses were coded into three cat-\negories: dropping out of school before graduation, completing\nhigh school, and attaining postsecondary education.\nEmployment Status.Employment was coded as \"full-time,\"\n\"part-time,\" or \"unemployed.\" In the qualitative data, there\nwere apparent differences in the meaning of \"unemployed\"\nwith some parents characterizing their adult child as cur-\nrently (but temporarily) unemployed while others indicated\nthat unemployment was a chronic state in which the adult\nchild was \"unemployable.\" However, for quantitative analy-\nses, these were combined into one category.\n6 SAGE Open\nIndex of Positive Activity. To capture the wide range of experi-\nences described by parents for quantitative data analyses, an\nindex was created to include both postsecondary education\nand employment in a single measure of the degree to which\nthese adults were \"positively occupying\" their time. Those\nwho were working full-time, attending school full-time, or\nattending school at least part-time while working at least\npart-time were considered to be fully positively occupied.\nThose adult children who were only working part-time, only\nattending school part-time, or were stay-at-home parents\nwithout part-time employment were considered to be par-\ntially positively occupied. Finally, those who were unem-\nployed, not attending school, incarcerated, or whose\nwhereabouts were unknown were considered to be not posi-\ntively occupied.\nResidential Status. Responses detailing an adult child's living\nsituation were coded as being independent, dependent on the\nparent, dependent on others, or a negative residential out-\ncome. Parents who described their child as paying his or her\nown rent were coded as independent; those who stated that\ntheir child lived with them and did not contribute to costs of\nliving were coded as dependent on their parent; those who\nstated that their child lived with a spouse, significant other,\nor roommate and did not contribute to costs of living were\ncoded as dependent on others; while those who specified that\ntheir adult child was homeless, incarcerated, transient living\nwith peers and abusing substances, or whose location was\nunknown were coded as a negative residential outcome.\nFinancial Independence. Parents indicated whether their child\nwas totally financially independent; partially independent\nand receiving minor assistance (from them, a spouse, or from\nanother individual), partially independent and receiving\nmajor assistance (from them, a spouse, another individual, or\nfrom Social Security Supplementary Income [SSI]); or\nwhether the child was totally dependent on the parent or the\nstate.\nIndex of Independent Living. This index combined residential\nliving situation and financial independence to create a single\nmeasure of attainment of two important IDEIA goals for\nadult independence. All degrees of residential status and\nfinancial independence were assigned weights which were\ncombined to yield a 7-point scale ranging from totally depen-\ndent to totally independent. Each adult child was assigned a\nscore on the resulting 7-point scale to represent his or her\noverall adult independence.\nStudy Design\nVarious methodologies have been used to attempt to ass-\ness outcomes, including prospective longitudinal, cross-\nsectional, and retrospective methods. Prospective designs are\nsuperior but generally, they are not feasible due to high\nattrition rates, residential mobility of the sample, cost, and\ntime; therefore, retrospective studies have been utilized\ndespite methodological limitations (Brewin, Andrews, &\nGotlib, 1993). For the present study, a retrospective approach\nwas selected.\nThe design technique of using online surveys is advanta-\ngeous for accessing individuals who may otherwise not vol-\nunteer to participate in a study dealing with sensitive\ninformation (McCabe, 2004; Pealer, Weiler, Pigg, Miller, &\nther advantage of online surveys is that they often produce\nmore candid answers than intrusive methods such as face-to-\nface interviewing (Kiernan, Kiernan, Oyler, & Gilles, 2005;\nOlsen, Wygant, & Brown, 2004). In this study, parents were\nable to participate anonymously, which may have allowed\nthem to feel more comfortable discussing their children's dif-\nficult problems than otherwise would have been the case\n(Colvin, Chenoweth, Bold, & Harding, 2004).\nResults\nAdult Children\nPreliminary Analyses.To clarify parent perceptions of the\nbehavior of their developing child, they were asked prelimi-\nnary questions about their child's behavior at ages 3 to 5.\nDespite clear differences in parental ratings of adult adjust-\nment, as young children, these adults were equally problem-\natic in many areas of functioning, and no statistically\nsignificant differences were found. The successful and\nunsuccessful groups were equivalent on the following early\nchildhood measures of severity indicating that both groups\nhad significant emotional or behavioral problems by school\nentry: presence of DSM diagnosis, age at which problematic\nbehaviors were first noticed by the respondent, attendance in\ngeneral prekindergarten programs, and their need for or use\nof early intervention services. The common behavior prob-\nlems in both samples included opposition and defiance at\nhome, mood swings, \"meltdowns,\" anxiety, specific fears\nand phobias, overdependence for age, and language delays.\nTherefore, these groups appear to be appropriately matched\nto make comparisons in their outcomes as adults.\nDemographic Analyses.Demographic information for the\nadult children is depicted in Table 1. The majority of the\nsample of adult children is below age 25 and ranges from 18\nyears. When compared with the male\u00adfemale distribution in\nthe general population, the sample contains an excess of\nfemales (61.8%) which was found to be statistically signifi-\ncantly different from the general population. However, as the\nnumber of boys with emotional and behavioral problems\nexceeds the number of girls (Baillargeon et al., 2007; Lahey\nof girls in the sample does not reflect the underlying\nWynne et al. 7\npopulation. This may be due to the fact that, in this sample,\nfemales were more likely than males to be rated as successful\nand all individuals rated as either \"successful\" or \"very suc-\ncessful\" were included in analyses. The adult children are\nslightly more diverse than their parents but the children also\nare predominantly Caucasian. Despite majority racial status\nof both parents and adult children and most parents reporting\nat least adequate financial resources by their child's high\nschool graduation, there is a wide variance in educational\noutcomes, ranging from an adult child who was expelled\nfrom the fifth grade to an adult child with a graduate degree.\nAs reported in Table 1, two adults completed eighth grade or\nbelow, 9 completed some high school, 13 completed the 12th\ngrade, and10 adults completed some postsecondary educa-\ntion, with 3 graduating from 4-year colleges and 1 adult\nobtaining a graduate degree.\nResearch Question 1: How do Adult Children's\nOutcomes Compare With IDEIA Goals of\nPost\u00adHigh School Education, Employment, and\nIndependent Living?\nSeveral survey items that were used to measure adult child\nparticipants' progress on the IDEIA goals of post\u00adhigh\nschool education, employment, and independent living are\ndisplayed in Table 2.

There were significant dif-\nferences between the groups, which were evaluated using\nMANOVA. The assumption of homogeneity of variances\ndren described as unsuccessful reported more financial dis-\ntress on each item than those whose children were successful.\nboth of the univariate Fs were significant: Strain, F(1, 25) =\nResults from other survey items suggest that both groups\nof parents tried to purchase as many services outside the\nschool as possible because private service utilization was\nhigh in both groups but not significantly different. Both\ngroups frequently obtained mental health assessments (86%\nunsuccessful and 77% successful, respectively). Both groups\nutilized residential treatment via parental placement at a high\nrate (47% unsuccessful and 53% successful) indicating many\nparents purchased services that would cause strain in most\nfamily financial situations. Twenty-six of 34 (76.5%) adults\nwere treated in a Residential Treatment Center (RTC) at\nsome point during their school years. However, those who\nhad been treated in an RTC were no more or less likely to be\nsuccessful as adults.\nWhile the long-term adult outcomes of treatment in an\nRTC were inconclusive for this sample, the prevalence of its\nuse as a form of treatment provides an indirect measure of\nseverity of individuals' problems: 15 of 17 unsuccessful\nadults and 11 of 17 successful adults received residential\ntreatment. This finding suggests that the level of severity of\nproblems was very high and that parents sought independent\ninterventions frequently.\nThere was a significant difference in type of placement:\nWhen all involuntary placements were compared with\nvoluntary parental placements, the difference was significant,\nside the home by parents whereas unsuccessful adults were\nplaced outside the home by other agencies, particularly by the\ncourts.\nResearch Question 4: To What Do Parents\nAttribute Their Adult Child's Success or Lack of\nSuccess?\nParents were asked, using an open-ended response format, to\ndescribe factors to which they attributed their child's suc-\ncessful or unsuccessful adjustment to adulthood. Tables 5\nand 6 depict their responses.\nAs can be seen in Table 5, parents most often attribute\ntheir child's successful adjustment to adulthood to factors\nwithin the child such as intelligence, talent, positive attitude,\nmaturity, motivation, or work ethic, and factors within the\nparent or family environment such as family support, finan-\ncial assistance, and forced independence or tough love. In\naddition, mental health services were mentioned by parents\nas aiding in their child's positive adjustment. Few parents\n(6.4%) cited education or school-based services as helping\ntheir child achieve a positive adult outcome.\nThe data in Table 6 show that parents most often attribute\ntheir child's unsuccessful adjustment to adulthood to factors\nwithin the child such as emotional problems, stubbornness,\nimpulsivity, opposition, defiance, poor coping skills, an\ninability to hold a job, lack of respect for authority figures,\nnegative life choices, risky sexual behaviors, poor judgment,\nignorance of stated rules, noncompliance with medication or\ntreatment, substance abuse, or other symptoms of a mental\nillness or specific conditions included in their DSM diagno-\nses. Nearly 10% of parents cited poor school supports, a lack\nof education, or negative school environment as contributing\nto their child's unsuccessful adult outcome.\nDiscussion\nIn an era when the graduation rate for students with EBD\nof this study is staying in school through postsecondary\nTable 4.

The IDEIA\ngoal of postsecondary education was associated with par-\nent perception of success, and to some, this might seem to\nbe an obvious relationship. While graduating from high\nschool alone was not associated with success in this study,\nperhaps because the majority of these students completed\n12th grade thus restricting the variance, dropping out of\nhigh school and pursuing postsecondary education were\nclearly important predictors of unsuccessful and success-\nful adult outcomes, respectively. In this sample, there was\na 68% high school completion rate and a 29% participa-\ntion in postsecondary education suggesting that these par-\nents went to great lengths to keep their children engaged\nin education. Thus, even in a small sample, the results are\ncongruent with IDEIA's emphasis on postsecondary edu-\ncation apparently because those engaged in postsecondary\neducation were more likely to be rated as successful by\ntheir parents. However, as students with behavioral prob-\nlems in general are much more likely to drop out or be\nexpelled from high school, achieving the IDEIA goal of\npostsecondary education (that should be attainable for this\ngroup of students based on cognitive ability) deserves\nmore attention than current educational policies support.\nIEP transition plans for high school students with EBD\nshould be tied to postsecondary educational goals stress-\ning specific skills that will lead to improved employment\nopportunities.\nIn contrast, another important finding was the relationship\nof expulsion and unsuccessful outcomes. Expulsion is an\nextremely negative predictor of success of students with\nEBD. No student in this study who was expelled was rated as\nsuccessful in adulthood despite majority status and adequate\nsocial capital of his or her family. It is generally known that\nstudents with EBD are more likely to violate school rules, be\nsuspended, and eventually expelled from school. In this\nstudy, use of punitive discipline was not associated with pos-\nitive outcomes.\nAdult Adjustment and IDEIA Goals\nSuccessful adjustment to adulthood was significantly\nrelated to employment status as well as independent living\nand financial independence. Considering all of the parent\ntime and an additional 5 (16%) were employed part-time.\nFurthermore, only 14 adults (41%) were considered to be\n\"fully positively occupied,\" suggesting that many students\nwith EBD leave high school unprepared for either employ-\nment or postsecondary education.Although 20 adults (59%)\nwere living independently, only 6 (18%) adult children\nwere described as being fully financially independent. This\nsuggests that while there is clearly a positive benefit to\nachieving the IDEIA goal of postsecondary employment\nand independent living, a large majority of adult children in\nthis sample have not achieved financial independence.\nGiven that the adult children were all reported to be of nor-\nmal or high-average cognitive functioning, it is not surpris-\ning that the majority attained independent living status,\nmeaning they can successfully manage and care for them-\nselves. However, the contrast between percentage that\nattained independent living and the percentage that attained\nfinancial independence indicates that they may not be\nachieving their full potential.\nThese findings are even more troubling when one consid-\ners that these adults have parents with at least average edu-\ncational and SES levels and the sample includes more\nindividuals with majority status than those generally\ndepicted in the literature or than would be expected in a ran-\ndom sample of parents of all students with EBD. If the\nyoung adult children of parents with this level of social capi-\ntal experience problems fully occupying themselves either\nwith full-time work or postsecondary education, it is diffi-\ncult to imagine that young adults with EBD in childhood\nwho have less well-educated and resourced parents would\nfare better or even as well. Thus, the somewhat positive\nskew of the current sample probably depicts a picture that is\noptimistic compared with the underlying group of adults\nwho had EBD during childhood/adolescence. This strongly\nsuggests that even higher levels of negative adult outcomes\nin children with EBD than shown in this study are likely in\nthe population. Furthermore, at the time these data were col-\nlected, the economy had begun to deteriorate, which proba-\nbly would depress outcomes for all young adults, with\nchildhood EBD or not. Future studies could include a more\ndiverse sample in the study to verify these results as well as\ntake changing economic conditions into account.\nParental Strain\nNot surprisingly, parents whose adult children were unsuccess-\nful reported higher levels of strain during their child-rearing\nyears in all measured spheres and more negative effects on\ntheir mental health. It is easy to understand why having a child\nwith serious emotional and behavioral problems of long dura-\ntion would be stressful for any parent (Long, Gurka, &\nBlackman, 2008). Causality cannot be established, but parents\nof the adult children who did not improve year after year and\ntherefore were still unsuccessful reported significantly more\nstrain than parents of the successful adult children, who experi-\nenced equivalent problems as young children. Conversely, see-\ning a child/adolescent on an improving trajectory leading\neventually to a parent rating of successful or highly successful\nobviously could reduce perceived stress. It is possible that the\nadults' current outcome affected parents' recall of their strain.\nAttempts were made to guard against this bias, however, by\nasking parents to reflect on strain at three levels of child devel-\nopment. Nevertheless, as many of the unsuccessful adult chil-\ndren remain under their parents'care, or at least are financially\ndependent, parents may have reported current as well as his-\ntoric strain.\nFinancial Strain\nIn a similar pattern to parental strain, parents of unsuccessful\nadult children reported significantly more perceived finan-\ncial strain during their child's youth than parents of success-\nful adult children. This relationship existed despite the\nparents reporting equivalent incomes and parental purchase\nof costly mental health services and residential treatment\nwas high in both groups. However, \"financial strain\" is sub-\njective and it is possible that parents whose intervention\nattempts were not succeeding stretched their family budgets\nfurther than parents of successful adults by trying to provide\nall possible interventions. In addition, while there was no\nsignificant difference in the rate of residential placement\namong the adult children, it is possible when residential\nplacements failed to produce improvement, the parents per-\nceived more financial strain due to anticipating the need to\npurchase additional services.\nParent Attributions of Success or Lack of Success\nParents commonly attributed both successful and unsuccess-\nful adjustment in adulthood to factors internal to the child.\nEven though one third of the adult children had IEPs as\nyouth, less than 10% of the parents mentioned school ser-\nvices as affecting outcomes. This result may be somewhat\ndiscouraging to professionals who are working with this\npopulation of students and are attempting to provide inter-\nventions that will foster positive growth and development\nwithin the child's home or school environment. However,\nknowing that parents feel that internal characteristics are\nvery important to determining adult outcomes for this group\nof children, professionals can try to adapt and design inter-\nventions that capitalize on positive individual traits and alle-\nviate the effects of negative personal characteristics.\nImplications and Future Research\nDespite the stigma associated with being identified as a stu-\ndent with EBD under IDEIA, qualifying for special educa-\ntion may serve as a protective function for students who are\nmore likely than average to violate school rules. Increasing\nschool identification of students with DSM diagnoses under\nIDEIA criteria may be beneficial because an IEP provides\nlegal protection against arbitrary disciplinary actions as well\nas access to transition planning. Consequently, it is possible\nthat the presence of an IEP alone would have protected the\nunsuccessful students from expulsion and thereby increased\ntheir chances for success. In this study, however, the pres-\nence of an IEP was not directly related to successful or\nunsuccessful adult outcomes perhaps due to the time period\nin which these adult children were in school.\nIn this study, no successful student was expelled, making\nit clear that expulsion is connected to negative outcomes for\nthis sample. School staff should work to develop preventive\nstrategies such as positive behavioral interventions and sup-\nports that would bring student behavior to acceptable levels\nand obviate the need to use highly punitive measures such as\nexpulsion.\nOnline parent samples can be problematic as parent par-\nticipants may be better educated and more affluent than the\npopulation of parents of children with EBD in general; fur-\nthermore, participating parents must be computer literate and\nhave access to a computer. While it is true that the sample in\nthis study is positively skewed in terms of educational and\nSES level, we wanted to investigate the achievement of\nIDEIA 2004 goals in a sample of parents of adult children\nwho experienced EBD as children/adolescents under the\ncondition of having family resources and a level of parent\neducation that are higher than other samples of parents of\nstudents with EBD. The rationale was that if the children of\nparents who were financially stable and reasonably well-\neducated did not fare well, it is unlikely that outcomes would\nbe better if the parents had lacked access to education, were\npoor, and were undergoing many stresses in addition to par-\nenting a child with EBD. If the adult children had done\nexceptionally well, then there would be a confound with\ntheir parents' resources. As only 17% of the adult children\nrated by the entire sample were considered \"successful\" or\n\"very successful,\" the design is not confounded. Based on\nthe findings from this study, it would be beneficial for addi-\ntional research to examine the adult outcomes for a larger\nsample of children that is more racially and socioeconomi-\ncally diverse for purposes of comparison. Additional focus\nshould be given to school-based services and whether or not\npreventive measures or appropriate special education ser-\nvices would produce positive outcomes for this population.\nFinally, as shown by the current study, the percentage of stu-\ndents with EBD who actually receive specialized services\nin school is small compared with the numbers of children\nand adolescents who experience significant emotional and\nbehavioral problems. Therefore, it would be important for\nfuture studies of children with emotional and behavioral\nproblems to include children with DSM diagnoses in addi-\ntion to students found eligible for special education services\nunder IDEIA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
