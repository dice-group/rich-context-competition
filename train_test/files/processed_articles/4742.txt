The current research begins to address this gap in the literature by\nexperimentally examining the nature of the perceived benefits available to gay men and\nstraight women in the context of these friendships. Using insight provided by an\nevolutionary social psychological perspective, we predicted that relationships between\nstraight women and gay men may be uniquely characterized by an exchange of unbiased\nmating-relevant advice in the absence of ulterior motives.\nThe Nature of Friendships Formed Between Straight Women and Gay Men\nPreliminary investigations have begun to examine the unique closeness of\nfriendships formed between straight women and gay men. However, many of these studies\nhave been qualitative in nature and focused primarily on the women - often referred to as\n\"fag hags\" or \"fruit flies\" - who regularly associate with gay men (see, e.g., Castro-Convers\nthat gay men provide positive attention for these women that straight men do not provide.\nFor example, gay men are viewed as accepting and admiring women for who they are,\nregardless of their physical appearance (Cho, 2001; Warren, 1976). As a result, women\nwith more gay male friends report increased feelings of sexual attractiveness and greater\nappreciation for their body relative to women who do not have gay male friends (Barlett,\nPatterson, VanderLaan, and Vasey, 2009). They also report feeling valued for their\npersonality instead of their sexuality when they are with their gay \u00ad as opposed to straight \u00ad\nwomen report an increased sense of honesty and security when interacting with their gay\nmale friends compared to their heterosexual male and female friends (Grigoriou, 2004).\nAlthough most of the research conducted up to this point has examined straight\nfemale-gay male friendships from the female perspective, there is research suggesting that\ngay men place similarly high value on their friendships with straight women. For example,\na study conducted by Grigoriou (2004) revealed that gay men view their straight female\nfriends to be particularly trustworthy sources of information regarding their romantic lives,\ncontrasting it with their experiences with other gay men. In this study, gay men described\ntheir friendships with straight women to be `meaningful' and `deep,' whereas their platonic\nrelationships with other gay men were described as `shallow' and `superficial.' Taken\ntogether, these findings suggest that honesty and trust may be the foundation for close\nfriendships formed between straight women and gay men.\nThe Absence of Deceptive Mating Motivations Among Gay Male and Straight Female\nFriends\nAlthough previous research suggests that gay men and straight women perceive one\nanother to be uniquely trustworthy sources of social support, researchers have not yet\nexperimentally examined what distinguishes these friendships from those that gay men and\nstraight women form with other individuals. Though seemingly counterintuitive, a\nfunctional psychological perspective suggests that these friendships may be set apart by\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nunique mating-relevant benefits exchanged by individuals within these friendships in the\nabsence of sexual interest and competition.\nPrevious research reveals some of the potential costs associated with women's\nfriendships with heterosexual men and women. Although straight male friends frequently\nprovide women with physical protection, economic resources, and valuable information\nabout the \"male perspective\" (Bleske and Buss, 2000; Lewis et al., 2011), these friendships\ncan also suffer due to men's sexual attraction toward their female friends. For example,\nmen tend to perceive more sexual interest in women's actions than women intend\n(DeSouza, Pierce, Zanelli, and Hutz, 1992), and indeed, men often interpret friendly\ngreetings or actions performed by their female friends as indicating sexual interest (Abbey,\nWhereas women's friendships with straight men may be tainted by one-sided sexual\ninterest, women's friendships with other straight women may be tainted by a different\nbrand of mating-relevant mistrust: intrasexual competition. Despite the companionship and\nemotional support that straight women often receive from their female friends (Bleske and\none another's mate attraction efforts (Bleske and Buss, 2000; Buss 2003). Indeed, previous\nresearch demonstrates that women utilize a number of deceptive strategies to successfully\noutcompete each other for access to desirable mates (e.g., competitor derogation and\nTooke and Camire, 1991). Research has also demonstrated that women's same-sex\nfriendships are more fragile and less tolerant than men's (e.g., Benenson et al., 2009).\nTherefore, like women's friendships with straight men, straight women's friendships with\neach other can be maligned by skepticism and distrust, particularly with regards to mating-\nrelevant concerns.\nRelative to straight women's same-sex friendships, there has been very little\nresearch conducted on gay male friendships; however, some recent research suggests that\ngay men's friendships with one another may be tainted by similar concerns as those\ninherent in straight women's friendships with each other. Despite the benefits of social\nsupport and identity development that gay men receive from their gay male friends (Kocet,\nstraight women) often compete with one another for access to desirable mates. Although\nresearchers have not explicitly tested the specific mate competition techniques most often\nutilized by gay men, it is possible that gay men use the same strategies employed by\nstraight women when competing for mates (i.e., competitor derogation and manipulation;\nFisher and Cox, 2010). Indeed, research suggests that gay men do view their gay male\nfriends as potential threats to their intimate relationships (Grigoriou, 2004).\nGay men's relationships with each other are further complicated by potential sexual\ninterest that may arise within these friendships. Although researchers have not yet\nexamined the nature of sexual motives that may intrude into relationships between platonic\ngay male friends, it is possible that these relationships may possess some of the same\ncharacteristics as platonic friendships formed between heterosexual men and women. In\nother words, sexual interest on the part of one individual may prevent an honest exchange\nof information from taking place within these friendships. Due to concerns about\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\ncompetitive and sexual deception that may operate simultaneously in gay male friendships,\nthe lack of trust between gay men noted in previous research (Grigoriou, 2004) may be\nespecially pronounced in mating-relevant contexts.\nThe Current Research\nIn light of the various challenges that straight women and gay men often encounter\nin their other friendships (i.e., mating competition/interest), we hypothesize that the trust\nand honesty that often characterizes gay male-straight female friendships may be rooted in\nmating-relevant domains. For example, straight women may experience increased trust in\ntheir relationships with gay men due to the absence of deceptive mating motivations that\nfrequently taint their relationships with straight men (sexual interest) and other straight\nwomen (mate competition). Similarly, the sexual interest and competitive motives that may\ntaint gay men's friendships with each other are notably absent from their relationships with\nstraight women. Despite being sexually attracted to the same gender (i.e., men), gay men\nand straight women are neither potential romantic partners nor mating competition for each\nother. They are thus uniquely positioned to provide one another with mating-relevant\nadvice and support that is not tainted with ulterior motives borne from intrasexual rivalry or\nsexual attraction. Therefore, we hypothesize that gay male-straight female friendships may\nbe characterized by a unique exchange of trustworthy mating advice not readily available to\ngay men and straight women via their other friendships. In the current research, we used an\nexperimental design to test the prediction that straight women and gay men will perceive\nmating advice (e.g., information about potential mating opportunities) provided by one\nanother to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by other individuals.\nExperiment 1: Straight Women's Perceptions\nExperiment 1 examined women's perceived trustworthiness of advice offered by a\ngay male target relative to straight male and female targets. Because straight women's\nrelationships with straight men and other straight women are often tainted by deceptive\nmotives related to mating interest or competition, respectively (e.g., Abbey, 1982; Fisher\nand Cox, 2010), we predicted that straight women would perceive mating-relevant\ninformation provided by a gay male to be more trustworthy than similar advice provided by\na straight male or straight female.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants.\nParticipants were 88 heterosexual undergraduate women (Mage\n= 3.04; 30 in the straight female condition, 29 in the straight male condition, and 29 in the\ngay male condition) recruited from the psychology subject pool at a mid-sized university.\nAll students received partial course credit in exchange for their participation.\nDesign and procedure.\nParticipants completed the experiment at partitioned computer terminals. They were\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\ntold that they would be participating in a study examining how online profiles influence\nfriendships, and accordingly, they were asked a few questions regarding online profiles in\norder to bolster the believability of our cover story. Participants were then asked to\nconsider the following scenario:\nImagine that you have recently been invited to a party by your friend. It is the night\nof the party and your friend becomes ill. However, they suggest you attend the party\nwith one of their neighbors. You do not know this person, but you decide to look\nthem up on Facebook before accompanying them to the party.\nNext, participants were randomly assigned to view a fictitious Facebook profile\nostensibly belonging to one of three targets: a straight female, a straight male, or a gay\nmale. They then answered a series of questions about the scenario and the target they\nviewed. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked to identify the sexual\npreference of the target that they viewed to verify that they had noticed the target's sexual\norientation. Additionally, participants were asked to indicate whether they themselves\nidentify as gay, bisexual, straight, or other. We excluded from the final data analyses\nparticipants who failed to correctly identify the sexual orientation of the target (n = 7) and\nnon-heterosexual participants (n = 2).\nTarget stimuli.\nThe Facebook profiles were identical (e.g., all profiles indicated the target's name\nwas \"Jordan,\" listed the same hobbies, etc.) except that target photographs and sexual\npreference information were modified and paired to create three different target profiles\n(i.e., a straight female, straight male, and gay male). Therefore, the same target photograph\nwas used for the straight male and gay male target profiles. We selected female and male\ntargets that appeared to be around college-aged and were averagely attractive. To ensure\nthere were no significant differences in attractiveness between the male and female targets,\nparticipants were asked to rate the attractiveness of the target they viewed on a scale\nranging from 1 (very unattractive) to 7 (very attractive). The analysis revealed no\nsignificant differences in attractiveness ratings given to the male and female targets (p >\n.99). Further, all targets received mean attractiveness ratings near the mid-point of our 7-\npoint rating scale (female target: M = 4.83; gay male target: M = 4.83; straight male target:\nDependent measures.\nAfter viewing their randomly-assigned target profile, participants were asked to\nimagine attending a party with the depicted individual and to consider a variety of\nhypothetical scenarios in which the target offered them mating-relevant advice (e.g., told\nthem how to interpret an interaction with an attractive member of the opposite sex). We\nassessed the degree to which participants said they would trust this advice using eight items\n(see Appendix for full list of items). All items were presented on 7-point Likert-type scales,\nwith higher values corresponding to greater perceived trustworthiness of advice offered by\nthe target.\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nParticipants also answered three questions designed to assess their perception of the\ntarget's ability to help them find a mate. Specifically, participants rated the likelihood that\nthe target could help them find an opposite-sex other in the form of (a) \"a fling,\" (b) \"a\ndate,\" and (c) \"a potential relationship\" on 7-point rating scales (endpoints: 1 = very\nunlikely, 7 = very likely).\nResults\nWe first created composite scores for items assessing the perceived trustworthiness\nof mating advice ( = .79) and perceived mating help ( = .71) provided by the targets. A\nmultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed differences in the perceived\ntrustworthiness of mating advice offered by the targets, F(2, 79) = 4.63, p = .01. Follow-up\ntests (Tukey's LSD, p < .05) revealed that participants perceived advice offered by the gay\nmale target to be more trustworthy (M = 4.45, SD = 0.95) than advice offered by the\ntrustworthiness of advice provided by the straight male and female targets (p > .99), nor\nwas there a significant difference in the perceived mating help provided by the targets (p =\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 revealed that straight women perceive mating advice provided by gay\nmen to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by straight men or women.\nAlthough women did not indicate that the gay male target would be any more helpful in\nfinding them a potential mate than the other targets, the results provide preliminary support\nfor the hypothesis that friendships between gay men and straight women may be\ncharacterized by an exchange of mating advice that is not tainted by ulterior mating\nmotives. Experiment 2 examines this hypothesis from the gay male perspective.\nExperiment 2: Gay Men's Perceptions\nPrevious research suggests that gay men perceive their friendships with straight\nwomen to be more meaningful and honest than their friendships with other gay men\n(Grigoriou, 2004). The logic of our functional perspective suggests that this may be due to\ngay men's friendships with one another being tainted by deceptive mating motivations\nsimilar to those that taint straight women's friendships with straight men (e.g., sexual\ninterest; Abbey, 1982) and with other straight women (e.g., mate competition; Fisher and\nCox, 2010). Therefore, Experiment 2 was designed to test the prediction that gay men will\nperceive mating advice offered by a straight female target to be more trustworthy than\nadvice offered by a gay male target.\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that straight women's increased perceived\ntrustworthiness of mating advice was specific to gay men, and did not generalize to straight\nmen, who may possess deceptive intent due to sexual interest in their female friends. In\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\norder to test the specificity of our predicted effects to straight women, Experiment 2\nincluded a novel \"lesbian female\" target condition. Previous research suggests a unique\nbond that exists between gay men and straight women, specifically (e.g., Grigoriou, 2004;\nHopcke and Rafaty, 1999; Malone, 1980); however, there has been very little research\nconducted examining friendships between gay men and lesbian women. Although the\nresearch that does exist suggests that gay men and lesbian women have little in common\nand therefore rarely enter into close relationships with one another (Grigoriou, 2004;\nWeeks, Heaphy, and Donovan, 2001), lesbian women lack ulterior motives that could\npotentially taint the mating advice they offer to gay men (i.e., lesbian women are neither\nsexual competition nor potential romantic partners for gay men). In sum, lesbian women\nmay lack the motivation to deceive their gay male friends in mating domains; however,\ntheir mating advice may not be seen as particularly useful either since lesbian women and\ngay men do not share many common interests, including the gender to which they are\nprimarily sexually attracted (e.g., Weeks et al., 2001). Accordingly, our analyses regarding\ngay men's perceptions of lesbian relative to straight women were somewhat exploratory in\nlight of the dearth of research exploring friendships between gay men and lesbian women.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants.\nParticipants were 58 homosexual men (Mage\nstraight female condition, 20 in the lesbian condition, and 18 in the gay male condition)\nrecruited from the university and at community-wide events geared towards the LGBT\n(lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community. A trained research assistant invited\nprospective participants to complete an online survey for which they would receive no\ncompensation beyond their participation. Again, we excluded from the final data analyses\nparticipants who failed to correctly identify the sexual orientation of the target they viewed\n(n = 16) and any participants who did not identify themselves as exclusively gay (n = 9).\nDesign and procedure.\nParticipants completed the experiment online. The cover story, design, procedure,\nand target stimuli were the same as Experiment 1, except that the straight male target\ncondition was replaced with a lesbian female target condition. The lesbian female target\nprofile was the same as the straight female target profile (e.g., we used the same target\nphoto and presented the same profile information) aside from indicating the target's\nromantic interest in women (as opposed to men). Again, there were no significant\ndifferences in attractiveness ratings given to the three targets (p = .93).\nDependent measures.\nThe scenario and dependent measures were similar to those used in Experiment 1,\nbut items were modified to reflect the participants' sexual orientation (e.g., the potential\nromantic interests in the scenarios were gay men).\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nResults\nAgain, we created composite scores for items pertaining to perceived\ntrustworthiness of mating advice ( = .83) and expected mating help ( = .75). A\nMANOVA revealed differences in the perceived trustworthiness of mating advice offered\ngay men rated the mating advice provided by the straight female target as more trustworthy\nwas no difference in the perceived trustworthiness of advice provided by the lesbian female\nand gay male targets, p = .61.\nFigure 1. Mean trustworthiness of advice offered by targets as rated by straight women\n(Experiment 1) and gay men (Experiment 2). Note: Full scale runs from 1 to 7. Error bars\nrepresent M +/- (2SE).\nIn addition, the degree to which gay men believed that each target could help them\nacquire a mate varied between conditions, F(2, 55) = 3.91, p = .03. Follow-up tests\nrevealed that participants rated the straight female target as more likely to help them\n1.18), p = .01, d = 1.00. However, the difference in perceived mating help offered by the\nstraight and lesbian female targets (M = 3.88, SD = 1.32) was not statistically significant (p\n= .17), nor was there a significant difference in perceived mating help provided by the\nlesbian female and gay male targets (p = .16).\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 2 provide additional support for the hypothesis that close\nfriendships between straight women and gay men may be characterized by a unique\nexchange of unbiased mating-relevant information that may not be available in their other\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nrelationships. Specifically, gay men perceived the mating advice offered by a straight\nfemale target to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by a gay male target. They\nalso rated the straight female as more potentially helpful in finding them a romantic partner\nthan the gay male. These effects were predicted due to the absence of sexual interest and\ncompetitive motives between straight women and gay men that may hinder the formation\nof close and honest friendships between gay men.\nThe results of Experiment 2 also suggest that this increased perceived\ntrustworthiness of mating advice was specific to straight women. Specifically, gay men\nperceived advice offered by a straight female target to be more trustworthy than similar\nadvice offered by a lesbian target. This finding suggests that gay men and straight women\nmay perceive one another to be uniquely trustworthy sources of advice and support in\nmating-relevant domains. Although lesbian women may not harbor any deceptive mating\nmotivations in their associations with gay men, our findings are in accordance with\nprevious research noting the lack of closeness between gay men and lesbian women in\nsocial contexts (see e.g., Weeks et al., 2001). This finding is in stark contrast with the\nemotional depth that has been shown to characterize friendships formed between gay men\nand straight women (e.g., Grigoriou, 2004). Though gay men and lesbian women may face\nsimilar social challenges (e.g., prejudice) due to their shared stigmatized sexual identity\n(Herek, 2000), these global commonalities might not necessarily influence gay men's and\nlesbian women's ability to assist one another across more specific domains, including those\nrelated to mating.\nGeneral Discussion\nPrevious qualitative research has noted that friendships between straight women and\ngay men are characterized by acceptance and comfort in the absence of sexual pressure,\nsocial stigmatization, or interpersonal anxiety (see e.g., Cruz and Dolby, 2007; Grigoriou,\nAlthough these studies provide some insight regarding the nature of close relationships\nformed between straight women and gay men, few empirical investigations have been\nconducted to examine the nature of the specific benefits perceived to be available to gay\nmen and straight women in these relationships relative to their friendships with other\nindividuals. Guided by a functional perspective on human mating, the current studies\nprovide the first experimental evidence that straight women and gay men perceive each\nother to be uniquely trustworthy sources of mating-relevant information and assistance.\nSpecifically, our results demonstrated that straight women perceive mating-relevant advice\noffered by a gay man to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by a straight man\nor woman (Experiment 1). Similarly, gay men perceive mating advice offered by a straight\nwoman to be more trustworthy than advice offered by another gay man or a lesbian woman\n(Experiment 2). Taken together, these findings provide preliminary support for our\nfunctional hypothesis that the emotional closeness shared by straight women and gay men\nmay be rooted in the absence of deceptive mating motivations (i.e., sexual interest or\nintrasexual competition) that frequently taint their relationships with other individuals.\nInterestingly, our results also demonstrated that gay men's perceptions of increased\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\ntrustworthiness were specific to straight women. Specifically, gay men in Experiment 2\nrated advice provided by a straight female to be more trustworthy than information\nprovided by a lesbian target. Although lesbian women may not bring any deceptive mating\nmotives into their relationships with gay men, research suggests that close friendships\nformed between gay men and lesbians are relatively rare due to important social, cultural,\nand emotional differences that exist between these individuals (Grigoriou, 2004; Weeks et\nal., 2001). Indeed, even though gay men tend to befriend women more often than other\nmen, research suggests that gay men tend to gravitate towards friendships with\nheterosexual females more readily than friendships with lesbians (Schneider and\nWitherspoon, 2000). Similarly, lesbians tend to befriend others who are of the same sex\nand sexual orientation as themselves (Schneider and Witherspoon, 2000; Stanley, 1996).\nIn addition, because previous research suggests that the mutual attraction to men is highly\nvalued and discussed in friendships between gay men and straight women (Hopcke and\nRafaty, 1999), it is possible that the absence of this shared interest may hinder the\nformation of close friendships between gay men and lesbian women. Thus, despite the\nabsence of ulterior mating motivations associated with attraction or competition, gay men\nmay be less apt to trust mating advice offered by lesbians (relative to straight women) due\nto their lack of shared interests (specifically those related to the male gender).\nAlthough gay men and straight women perceived each other as providing the most\ntrustworthy mating advice, our results pertaining to the perceived mating help offered by\neach target were less clear. For example, women in Experiment 1 did not perceive the gay\nmale target to be any more likely to help them find a mate than the straight female or male\ntargets. On the other hand, gay men in Experiment 2 did expect the straight female to be\nsignificantly more helpful in this regard relative to the gay male. This discrepancy may owe\nitself to the fact that gay men do not readily form close associations with straight men, nor\n1994b). Therefore, it is not surprising that women do not expect gay men to be especially\ncapable of finding them a mate. On the other hand, gay men do tend to form close\nfriendships with straight women, as the previous literature has suggested (e.g., Grigoriou,\n2004; Hopcke and Rafaty, 1999). Therefore, it is likely that gay men perceive women to\nhave close connections with other gay men who could become romantic partners.\nAdditionally, this finding could also be driven by the limited availability of gay \u00ad relative\nto straight \u00ad men. Unlike women, whose potential mating partners (i.e., straight men) are\nmuch more numerous, gay men are less abundant in the general population and are often\nmore difficult to identify. Thus, it would be especially beneficial for gay men to utilize an\nunbiased source (e.g., straight women) to aid them in locating other gay men as romantic\npartners. Straight women, however, would not necessarily need to utilize gay men in this\ncapacity because their mating opportunities with straight men are more numerous and\nreadily identifiable. This relative difficulty in identifying gay men may have also\ncontributed to the absence of a significant difference between straight and lesbian women's\nperceived likelihood of helping gay men find potential romantic partners (Experiment 2).\nAlthough we did not predict this in advance, due to the lack of competition between\nlesbians and gay men and the relative difficulty in identifying available gay men in the\ngeneral population, gay men may look to lesbian women to help them identify potential\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nmates due to their involvement in the LGBT community (Garnets and D'Augelli, 1994;\nIn addition to providing initial experimental insight into the functional relevance of\nclose relationships formed between gay men and straight women, the current research\nprovides additional evidence that the mating psychologies of homosexual individuals may\nbe functionally-tuned in ways similar to heterosexuals. For example, previous research\ndemonstrates that gay men and straight men place a similar premium on physical\nattractiveness in their potential romantic partners, despite their discrepant sexual\norientations (Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, and Gladue, 1994). Therefore, although gay men may\nnot have an opportunity to directly participate in reproduction via conventional means, gay\nmen, specifically, and homosexual individuals, more generally, likely possess evolved\npsychological mechanisms that would promote successful reproductive outcomes\nregardless of one's sexual orientation (e.g., gender-specific mate preferences, a tendency to\ntrust advice offered by individuals lacking ulterior mating motives).\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe results of the current studies provide convergent empirical support for the\nhypothesis that friendships between gay men and straight women are characterized by a\nmutually beneficial exchange of unbiased mating advice. However, there were some\nimportant limitations to our studies that should be noted. First, the participant samples used\nin Experiments 1 and 2 were restricted in important ways. Gay males were relatively\nunavailable in our university sample; therefore, a majority of our gay male participants in\nExperiment 2 were recruited from the local community. It is possible that this sample may\nhave differed in a number of unintended ways \u00ad including socioeconomic status, education\nlevel, and ethnicity \u00ad from the female participants in Experiment 1, who were all college\nstudents. Further, because gay men were somewhat difficult to recruit, the final analytical\nsample for Experiment 2 was relatively small (N = 58). However, despite this small sample\nsize, the effect sizes obtained in Experiment 2 were relatively large, suggesting a robust\neffect. Regardless, future research should test the reliability of the demonstrated effects\nacross a larger and more diverse sample of gay and straight men and women.\nIn addition, the current experiments did not examine straight women's and gay\nmen's perceived trustworthiness of mating advice offered by lesbian women and straight\nmen, respectively. Although lesbian women do not serve as potential mate competition for\nstraight women, their lack of shared interest in men may decrease the utility of the mating-\nrelevant advice with which they may provide straight women. Also, one-sided sexual\nattraction on the part of lesbian women may further complicate these relationships and\ndecrease the perceived trustworthiness of advice they provide to straight women. Similar\ncomplexities may characterize relationships between gay and straight men. Again, gay men\nand straight men do not compete with one another for access to mates; however, they are\nnot attracted to the same sex either, which may decrease the usefulness of mating advice\nprovided by straight men to gay men. Further, research has demonstrated that close\nfriendships between gay men and straight men may rarely form due to homophobic\nconcerns that often operate within these dyads (e.g., Grigoriou, 2004; Herek, 1988;\nRumens, 2008). For these reasons, we expect that the mating advice offered by lesbian\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nwomen and straight men to straight women and gay men, respectively, will be perceived to\nbe significantly less trustworthy than the mating advice exchanged by straight women and\ngay men. Future research should examine how heterosexual and homosexual individuals\nperceive same-sex targets of different sexual orientations.\nThird, the current experiments demonstrated the perceived trustworthiness of\nmating advice exchanged by gay men and straight women. However, we did not examine\nwhether this increased trustworthiness is specific to mating-relevant domains or if straight\nwomen and gay men similarly value each other's advice across domains (e.g., career\nadvice). Although future research should examine this possibility, the logic of our\nfunctional perspective suggests that the unique trust shared by straight women and gay men\nshould be most pronounced in mating domains, where there is an increased likelihood of\nbeing deceived by other individuals harboring ulterior motivations related to mate\nattraction or competition. Gay men and straight women, however, may not view each other\nas being especially trustworthy sources of information in other domains within which they\nmay compete with one another. In other words, although gay men and straight women do\nnot directly compete for mates, their respective genders and sexual orientations do not\npreclude them from competing with one another in domains unrelated to mating (e.g.,\ninterviewing for the same jobs). Therefore, it is unlikely that the heightened trust\ndemonstrated in our experiments would generalize across other domains within which gay\nmen and straight women are likely to compete.\nA fourth limitation of the current studies is that we examined the perceived mating\nbenefits received by straight women and gay men within these relationships. We did not,\nhowever, examine whether either party actually benefits from this mating advice or if these\nperceived benefits influence the formation of actual friendships between gay men and\nstraight women. Because previous research suggests that women benefit from friendships\nwith gay men in a number of ways (e.g., with regards to having positive feelings towards\ntheir physical bodies; Barlett et al., 2009), the unbiased advice that women and gay men\nexchange likely benefits them both psychologically and socially. Future research should\nexplore precisely how gay men and women benefit from this advice (e.g., enhanced\nattractiveness, social desirability, or ability to attract romantic partners) and whether these\nperceived benefits translate into actual mating success.\nFinally, the conclusions that can be drawn from the findings of the current research\nare also limited by some of the experimental parameters that we put into place. Most\nnotably, we presented only one target per experimental condition across both experiments.\nTherefore, it is possible that our effects may not generalize to other male and female\ntargets. Also, although we hypothesized that close friendships between gay men and\nstraight women are characterized by an exchange of trustworthy mating information, our\nexperiments did not explicitly test this hypothesis as participants were asked to imagine\ninteracting with a person that they had just met instead of a close friend. Therefore, the\neffects may not reflect women's and gay men's tendencies to trust mating advice offered by\nclose friends with whom they regularly interact. Future research should examine whether\nour results generalize to close friendships formed between gay men and straight women.\nRegardless, our results highlight the perceived trustworthiness that characterizes mating\nadvice exchanged by straight women and gay men and may provide insight into the\nStraight women and gay men exchange trustworthy mating advice\nformation of gay male-straight female friendships.\nConclusion\nPopular culture and previous research alike have noted the special bond between\nstraight women and gay men. The current studies explored whether unbiased mating advice\nexchanged by gay men and straight women may provide the foundation for these\nfriendships. Our results suggest that straight women and gay men perceive mating advice\nprovided by each other to be more trustworthy than similar advice offered by other\nindividuals, whose advice may be tainted by deceptive mating motivations. In addition to\nbeing the first experimental examination of the nature of the perceived benefits available to\nindividuals within these relationships, these findings provide an important step in\nunderstanding the unique and important bond shared by straight women and gay men.\n"
