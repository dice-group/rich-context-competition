It negatively\naffects the person's work and occurs regularly, over a period of\ntime (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, & Cooper, 2011). In those individ-\nuals targeted for abuse, cross-sectional studies report depres-\nsion, difficulty sleeping, and symptoms of burnout (Nielsen &\nEinarsen, 2012). In terms of consequences for employers, these\nbehaviors have been associated with employee absenteeism,\nillness, legal and medical costs, early retirement, and general\nworkplace instability (Hershcovis & Barling, 2010). Boddy,\nMiles, Sanyal, and Hartog (2015) find that employees in bully-\ning situations tended to arrive late for work, leave early, and\ntake longer breaks.\nIt seems obvious that bullying behavior in the workplace not\nonly affects the mental and physical health of a targeted indi-\nvidual employee, but also threatens the stability and productiv-\nity of other employees, at a significant economic cost to the\nemployer, in terms of workman's compensation, lowered\nmorale, and employee turnover (Aub\u00e9 & Rousseau, 2014;\nHouschman, O'Reilly, Robinson, & Wolff, 2012; Mawritz\net al., 2012). It is imperative to better understand how this kind\nof damage is inflicted in the workplace, to ameliorate it. This\narticleproposesatheoreticalmodel,drawnfromrecentresearch\nin neuroscience and from relevant discussions in clinical psy-\nchology, that identify the various members of a bullying mob\nand their motives for participation in workplace abuse.\nNeuroscientists concerned with the nature of social intel-\nligence, or what is referred to as empathic capacity, find that\nit is normally distributed in the general population (Baron-\nCohen, 2011). The literature concerned with this research\nsuggests that those who will engage in bullying or abusing a\nfellow employee are found at the extreme lower end of this\ndistribution, while targeted employees are found at the higher\nend (Namie & Namie, 2009). When the discussions presented\nby clinical psychologists are reviewed, the various roles\nplayed by participants in workplace abuse become clear.\nThe following discussion presents an explanatory account\nthat suggests that workplace bullying does not occur as a\nresponse to normal difficulties in social interactions, nor\ndoes it have to involve public displays of aggression and\nobvious bullying behaviors. The harm visited on a competent\nemployee is the result of a zero-empathy organizer who\ndirects stealth attacks, with an intention to increase the tar-\nget's stress, reduce their social status, and create the condi-\ntions for their possible exit from the workplace.\nSocial Intelligence\nAn explanation of the nature of coordinated employee abuse\nbegins with a fundamental biological fact that explains how\na person could find pleasure and satisfaction in causing dis-\ntress and anguish to a workplace associate, to the extent that\n1Professor Emeritis, Southern Illinois University\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: profpopp@gmail.com\nSocial Intelligence and the Explanation\nof Workplace Abuse\nJerome Popp1\n Keywords\nworkplace abuse, social intelligence, neuroscience research, bullying, empathy\n2 SAGE Open\nhe or she becomes physically ill, resigns, or, in extreme\ncases, commits suicide (Nielsen, Nielsen, Notelaers, &\nEinarsen, 2015). Neuroscientists distinguish between (a)\ngeneral intelligence, which consists of reasoning and mem-\nory, and (b) social intelligence, or empathic capacity, which\ngives us compassion and a conscience. These two forms of\nintelligence are supported in different areas of the brain\n(Lieberman, 2013). General intelligence is located on the lat-\neral surface of the brain, while social intelligence is found on\nthe medial or midline region. Given that the two intelligences\nare supported by distinct brain areas, it is possible, for exam-\nple, that a person could be high in one form of intelligence\nand low in the other, or high or low in both.\nEmployees with high social intelligence, that is, highly\nempathic individuals, more easily understand what other\npeople are thinking and their intentions, what neuroscientists\nrefer to as mindreading or mentalizing. Some employees are\nbetter than others at understanding or interpreting the com-\nments or intentions of those with whom they interact. They\nare also better at understanding the emotional states of oth-\ners, a skill referred to as affect matching. Lieberman also\nincludes empathic motivation, the impetus to assist another\nin distress or to recognize another's success, as a third char-\nacteristic of highly empathic people.\nAn important point for the study of workplace abuse is\nthat individuals at the extreme lower end of the distribu-\ntion of social intelligence have no conscience and are inca-\npable of experiencing shame or remorse. This means that\nthere are no limits on their behavior, beyond that of self-\nprotection. It should be recognized that the presence or\nabsence of a conscience is an important division in the\nhuman population, one that is more important in under-\nstanding the differences in people we encounter than is\ngeneral intelligence, race, or gender (Stout, 2005). This\ndivision is especially important in understanding work-\nplace abuse. The idea of a lack of a conscience, or signifi-\ncantly below average social intelligence, is fundamental to\nunderstanding all forms of human cruelty (Baron-Cohen,\n2011). Individuals in any corporation or social institution\nshould not assume that their workplace is free of individu-\nals with no conscience, those who have no limits on their\nbehavior. On average, there is one zero-empathy individ-\nA benefit of this research is that the terminological issue\nof how to refer to these zero-empathy individuals is simpli-\nfied, at least for purposes of understanding workplace abuse.\nBabiak and Hare (2006) conceptually distinguish psychopa-\nthy, sociopathy, and antisocial personality disorder (APD).\nThey posit psychopathy as biologically based, but sociopa-\nthy as a learned condition. Stout considers sociopaths as hav-\ning no conscience and, consequently, having no limits on\ntheir behavior, other than avoiding a context that would\nreduce their ability to do what they please and feel no respon-\nsibility or obligation to anyone except themselves. Boddy\nThere seems to be little agreement on the definitions of these\nterms in the literature.\nFor clinical diagnoses of individuals and their treatment,\nthe various classifications of these disorders are important,\nbut for an explanation of workplace abuse, the classification\nof zero-empathy allows us to understand the basic physio-\nlogical nature of employees who attack other employees,\nwith the intent to cause them serious harm. These individuals\nlack the biological underpinnings of what makes us social\ncreatures (Lieberman, 2013). They are found most com-\nmonly in positions that give them unsupervised control over\na small group of somewhat vulnerable individuals, where\nthey can behave as they wish, without accountability (Stout,\nBaron-Cohen report that zero-empathy individuals are char-\nacterized by schadenfreude, the German word for enjoying\nthe pain or distress experienced by others.\nAs Stout (2005) observes, these individuals are unable to\nprocess emotional experience, except when this experience\ncan be coldly intellectual. Although it is not possible to scan\nthe brains of employees thought to be of zero empathy and\nwho enjoy inflicting pain on others, the reality is that in prin-\nciple these problem employees are identifiable, which means\nthat these analyses are related to an objective reality, not sim-\nply opinions about someone's behavior.\nLeaders of Abuse\nAt the extreme lower end of the social intelligence distribu-\ntion, we find individuals with zero social intelligence who\nare capable of extremely negative treatment of others. At the\npositive end of this distribution are those characterized by a\nhypersensitivity to the mental and emotional states of other\npeople. When zero-empathy employees first enter the work-\nplace, they sort other employees into four categories: (1)\nthose who are competent and productive; (2) those who can\nbe induced to take part in the abuse of a targeted employee;\n(3) those who are attracted to, and find enjoyment in gossip\nabout coworkers; and (4) those who are irrelevant to their\nplans and methods. Individuals targeted for abuse are those\nwho stand out as more respected, intelligent, popular, com-\npetent, or attractive (Stout, 2005). The presence of these\nemployees in the workplace is offensive to zero-empathy\nemployees, which leads them to seek what Stout refers to as\nexistential vengeance. By hypothesis, employees targeted for\nabuse are those at the higher end of the social intelligence\ncurve. Conscientious, and well-liked, they are generally con-\ncerned when someone else is in pain or distress. Within any\ngroup, these employees will have a slightly higher social\nstatus.\nAnyone whose behavior is not limited by a conscience\nlearns early in life that when individuals lose friends, for\nwhatever reason, it is significantly distressing for them.\nConsiderable research supports the fact that the three greatest\nsources of stress are (a) low social status, (b) lack of friends,\nand (c) childhood stress (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2009). If the\nemployees targeted for abuse can be made to feel rejection\nby their associates, they will experience despair that can lead\nto anguish and depression.Asecondary objective is to reduce\nthe amount and quality of the employee's work, so that they\nare passed over for recognitions or special assignments. The\nunrecognized superiority of the zero-empathy employee is\ndemonstrated to everyone, when it is seen that these respected\nemployees can be reduced in status and shown to be less than\nothers think. In their ability to bring down more socially\ndesirable individuals and productive workers, they prove\ntheir power over all others, which, as it turns out, is remark-\nably easy to accomplish.\nMembers of the Mob\nThe leaders of workplace abuse surround themselves with\nemployees who are either somewhat insecure in their posi-\ntions, or who are themselves without a conscience (McGregor\nmobbing reveals multiple participants in the abuse of an\nemployee (Davenport, Schwartz, & Elliott, 1999; Duffy &\nSperry, 2012). The clinical literature describes the motivation\nof individuals who will participate in the infliction of harm on\na fellow employee and reports that these individuals can be\norganized and directed by a leader, which is consistent with\nthe basic account of workplace abuse (Babiak & Hare, 2006).\nThese are persons who are apathetic and willing to follow a\nleader who can protect them, because they lack self-confi-\ndence and tend to avoid conflict (McGregor & McGregor,\n2013). Employees new to the job may find that they are poorly\nprepared for, or dislike the tasks required of them. These\nemployees are readily identified by the leader of the abuse.\nIn situations where employees are subjected to explicit\nevaluations, these individuals may seek protection by joining\nthe leader, with the belief that this person is in control of the\nworkplace. They may also see the power of the leader, referred\nto by Babiak and Hare (2006) as a puppetmaster, and fear\nbecoming a target themselves (Maarit & Vartia, 2001; Namie\n& Lutgen-Sandvik, 2010). The McGregors further hypothe-\nsize that some of these individuals may bear a grudge, be jeal-\nous or angry, or feel let down in some way by the person\nreceiving the abuse. They become followers in employment\nsituations that afford the zero-empathy employee undersuper-\nvised control over others, especially those who seek a para-\nPeople have a basic sensitivity to their relative standing in\na group, which is a powerful motivator of their behavior\n(Wohlforth, 2009). When individuals lose friends and experi-\nence lowered status, the stress the zero-empathy employee\nwants to create is achieved. Those targeted experience even\ngreater stress when they can no longer enjoy exercising their\nskills and competence in the workplace. This occupational\nstress is incomprehensible to the abuse leaders, because the\nworkplace for them is a field of play, a place where they can\ndemonstrate their superior powers to themselves and others.\nWith no conscience, they find no pride in doing something\nwell; they will never be seen as hard workers, because their\nattention and energies are directed elsewhere. They stand to\ngain in social status if the targeted person is driven from the\nworkplace or is discredited.\nLow social status individuals who reject participation in\nthe abuse leader's activities may have already achieved com-\npensation in the form of resource exchange, by engaging in\nother institutional activities in which they see themselves as\nhaving a higher status. Examples of such exchanges might\ninvolve increased participation in church activities, commu-\nnity groups, family relationships, sports, or recreational pas-\ntimes. In these activities, individuals can prove they are\nvalued by others, evidence sought to fortify their own value\nParticipants in a Whisper Campaign\nA method of employee abuse more effective than bullying is\nremoving an employee's friends and lowering his or her social\nstatus with a whisper campaign. Zero-empathy employees are\nalert for, and intensely cultivate, those employees who will\nenthusiastically participate in gossiping. Determining how\nemployees respond to gossip is part of the zero-empathy\nemployee's initial sorting process mentioned earlier. Those\nfound to be eager listeners or contributors become active par-\nticipants in the campaign against a targeted individual. The\nwhisper campaign is an endless activity; the abuser's schaden-\nfreude from gossip is pursued any time another person will\nlisten. This is similar to the saturation technique used in adver-\ntising, and eventually seems to influence, perhaps sublimi-\nnally, many employees' views of the targeted individual.\nBabiak and Hare (2006) warn that an employee's reputation\ncan be destroyed without his or her awareness that anyone\nwould have doubts about the employee's character or compe-\ntence. The victim of a whisper campaign can be reenvisioned\nas a \"problem employee,\" without their knowledge.\nContent for the campaign is obtained in two basic ways.\nNegative comment fishing is the technique of initiating a\nconversation with a targeted employee and then mentioning\nanother employee's name. The zero-empathy employee will\nmake negative comments about that employee, hoping to\nentice the targeted employee to follow the lead and say\nsomething negative also. The targeted employee may respond\nwith an innocuous comment or nod in agreement about a tan-\ngential matter. The other employee is then told of what was\nsaid and who said it. Note that the zero-empathy employee is\nin no way inhibited from enhancing what was said by the\ntargeted employee.\nOther effective techniques for demeaning a colleague\nmight include the creation of a derogatory name for the per-\nson targeted for removal. These may include, but are not lim-\nited to, negative descriptors of physical appearance or\nbehavior that implies the target is deficient in some way or\n4 SAGE Open\ndoes not fit within the values of the workplace, and is thus\ndeserving of scorn. Abuse leaders usually float a derogatory\nname within the group to see who will embrace it enthusias-\ntically. A person can become vilified simply by the zero-\nempathy employee's repeated use of an unflattering label.\nA source of stress beyond those mentioned by Wilkinson\nand Pickett (2009) is the devastation competent persons\nexperience when they observe incompetent employees\nrewarded or recognized as a part of their compensation for\nmob membership. They also experience great stress when\nthey observe respected former colleagues obediently follow-\ning the demands of a puppetmaster. Other employees, who\nare currently not being bullied, live in fear of being the next\ntarget, and report higher stress levels and intentions to leave\nthan nonexposed workers (Emdad, Alipour, Hagberg, &\nJensen, 2012). These situations are especially troubling when\nlocal political maneuverings are given a higher priority than\nthe services and products provided to customers or clients.\nOn a strictly humanitarian level, this deterioration of work-\nplace atmosphere and harm to competent individuals should\nbe of concern, but there is a financial cost to companies as\nwell. A study by Fattori et al. (2015) estimated the economic\ncost of bullying to employers in terms of losses in productiv-\nity as upward from 15%.\nWhen incompetent employees become members of a\nmob, the quality of their work often deteriorates even further.\nUnder the protection of the zero-empathy employee, even\nthe feeblest of striving seems unnecessary. More serious is\nthe decline in work quality of the targeted employee, who is\noften driven into depression by mobbing activities. Other\nemployees who observe this diminishing of quality through-\nout their workplace also experience increased stress, which\nhas an impact on job satisfaction and the quality of their\nexplained by 1% of the work population. One percent of the\nemployees in a company can emotionally and healthwise\nimpact a quarter of the employees. The work of many others\nmay be affected as they sense the anguish of their fellow\nWhile a business, corporation, or any institution, may not\nbe destroyed by employees with no conscience and their\nminions, their presence most assuredly means the institution\nor organization is underperforming its potential. As noted,\nresearchers estimate the percentage of these individuals in\nsuggest, they will control a number of other employees.\nWhen participants in the whisper campaign are included in\nthe abuse mobs, a high percentage of the workforce could be\ninvolved in the abuse of the better employees.\nIn a Forbes interview (Asghar, 2013), Martha Stout\nobserved that having a sociopath as an employee can be\nexpensive, in terms of its eventual cost to an organization.\nZero-empathy employees may be immune from organiza-\ntional discipline because they have control of a significant\ngroup of employees. Moreover, they may also protect their\nfollowers from discipline, which means that they also do not\nhave to perform to retain their positions, and the overall qual-\nity of the work product declines significantly. Employees\nwho readily support the leader's activities may not reveal\nantisocial attitudes, but neither do they display moral charac-\nter or professional responsibility.\nConsequences for Targeted Employees\nTargeted employees are empathic individuals, who are, by\nnature, constant monitors of how they are perceived by those\nwith whom they interact. This renders them more vulnerable\nthan average to the devastation of these attacks (Namie &\nNamie, 2009). They may wonder whether those who partici-\npate in their mobbing sensed a judgment that they were weak\nemployees, and that this judgment has somehow been recog-\nnized by the attackers. The targeted employees may attempt\nto show members of the mob that they do not feel superior to\nthem or want them to experience any distress, which only\nreassures zero-empathy leaders that their destructive plan is\nworking.\nEmployees who are targeted experience anxiety and dis-\ntress because of their elevated blood levels of cortisol, the\nfight or flight hormone, and may interpret this response as a\nsign of personal weakness. Holding themselves to high stan-\ndards of performance, they experience a lowered self-confi-\ndence, because their reaction seems to be excessive.\nInterpreting anxiety as personal weakness can lead them to\nassume responsibility for their loss of friends and lowered\nsocial status. When efforts to appease attackers fail, they\nwithdraw from as many forms of contact as are possible in a\nwork situation.\nWe know that targets of abuse may suffer long-term\nimpairments with regard to their occupational careers, their\nmental well-being, self-esteem, and physical health. Some\nindividuals require various forms of therapy to reenter the\njob market (Namie & Lutgen-Sandvik, 2010). Asking for\nmore involvement by the psychiatric community, Kemp\n(2014) also notes that targets often need psychiatric treat-\nment and that these attacks can have a lifelong impact. He\nalso observes that supervisory personnel generally have dif-\nficulty identifying workplace abuse.\nThere are reports that sustained exposure to these work-\nplace attacks leads to high blood pressure and increased risk\nof coronary heart disease. With continued exposure to this\nkind of treatment, increased levels of cortisol may cause\npanic attacks. In the extreme, attacked employees experience\nend-state anxiety, which is emotional paralysis; the person is\ndisabled and cannot perform the most basic of tasks (Namie\n& Namie, 2009). As the level of stress for the targeted\nemployee increases, thinking and memory are also impaired.\nStress may cause a shift in memory from more flexible cog-\nnitive thinking to the more rigid habitual memory (Sabrina,\nMarcel, & Wolf, 2005). This suggests that targeted employ-\nees engaged in creative activities may become weaker\nproblem-solvers than before, though this change may not be\nobservable.\nAt the first signs of emotional discomfort, an abused\nemployee should take some defensive action (Temin, 2010).\nContinued bullying by abusers over weeks and months can-\nnot be endured without significant emotional damage. An\nabused employee should avoid thoughts of reactive aggres-\nsion, which is a common response from individuals who feel\nthey have low social status (Henry, 2007). These responses\nwill provide new content for the whisper campaign, and\nthose who observe these actions will be drawn to agree with\nthe abusers' comments about the targeted employee's stabil-\nity. The empathic capacity that makes the abused employee a\nvaluable employee is also the characteristic that makes the\nemployee more vulnerable to the efforts of his or her attack-\ners, and gives the attacker a greater sense of personal power.\nBy design, many colleagues will not recognize the abuse\ntaking place, with respect to desirable employees (Babiak\n& Hare, 2006), but they will recognize their abilities and\ncompetence. When they falsely learn, by means of the\nwhisper campaign, that the targeted employee believes he\nor she is better, more important, or more valuable than\neveryone else, the noninvolved employees may believe the\ngossip and develop some disdain for the targeted person.\nSome may be relieved to know that the individual is not so\nperfect after all.\nAt a critical point, the targeted employee's levels of corti-\nsol may increase to the point where there is an impairment of\njudgment and behavior. This, in turn, provides credibility for\nthe zero-empathy employee's constant negative comments.\nOriginal doubters may begin to think the criticism is legiti-\nmate. Once again, the disbelief that an employee in their\nmidst could intentionally visit this kind of evil on a colleague\nprotects the zero-empathy employee and renders more effec-\ntive the abuse of a good employee. When these highly\nempathic and productive targeted employees are rejected and\ndefamed by those who obviously have no commitment to the\norganization, the situation becomes unbearable for them.\nWorse still is the discovery that the employee's former\nfriends are part of the abusive mob. Zero-empathy mob lead-\ners know that a former friend who has become an abuser is\nespecially devastating to a targeted employee.\nNote that overt, hostile, and heated bullying will call\nattention to itself as behavior that is markedly deviant from\nnormal employee-to-employee interaction. But the subtle\nday-by-day distancing of former friends from a targeted\nemployee is much more devastating than being addressed in\na hostile manner by angry colleagues. Although bullying is a\ndevice frequently used, the sole focus on this behavior misses\nthe numerous subtle aspects of abuse. Moreover, employees\nmay fear that if they report abuse, they will be seen as over-\nreacting. They may also be aware of the resentment toward\nthem by other employees, who regard their popularity as the\nresult of some sort of manipulation. Having low social intel-\nligence, these employees cannot comprehend what it is about\nthe abused employee that is so valued by others, and may not\nbe unhappy to see the targeted employee in distress.\nMore productive and desirable employees will be the first\nto leave, because they have more employment options than\ntheir peers and will more quickly and directly grasp the\nintentions of the zero-empathy employees and the mob mem-\nbers with whom they work. Their departure is seen by those\nwho remain as a clear demonstration of the power of the\nabusers. Employees who cannot leave, for whatever reason,\nprovide the greatest pleasure for the zero-empathy leaders,\nbecause this allows them the social status of master of the\nworkplace.\nMembers of the mob may, in private, explain to targeted\nemployees that if they would act differently, they would be\nbetter accepted. This is intended, of course, to make the tar-\ngets feel that it is their fault that they are being rejected--an\nabusive technique sometimes referred to as gaslighting.\nUndermining self-confidence is an effective device for\nincreasing anxiety. If other employees see the target as emo-\ntionally broken down, but without knowledge of the mob-\nbing going on, the target will experience an even greater\ndistancing from peers, which of course escalates anxiety\nlevels.\nThe most troubling aspect of these attacks is not the joy\nsome find in hurting others; some people are wired for creat-\ning distress in those with whom they interact. When it\nbecomes clear to targeted employees that they are under an\nattack in which their former friends are actively and enthusi-\nastically participating, they believe either that the insecurity\nof employees with whom they work and who participate in\nthe mobbing must be greater than they thought, or that the\nsupposed friendships were forced and inauthentic all along.\nThere is one additional torment visited upon the targeted\nemployees. Neuroscientists report that there exists what they\nrefer to as the default network. When we are unoccupied for\neven a few seconds with a task or problem, the default net-\nwork takes our minds to other people (Lieberman, 2013).\nNeuroscientists think that this network makes us more social,\nin that we learn about other people in small episodes during\nthe day. For a targeted employee, the default network adds to\nthe distress of being mobbed, because their thoughts are of\ntheir tormentors, former friends, and associates. When peo-\nple are experiencing abuse by their associates, it is these indi-\nviduals to which the default network turns, and serves to\ncycle thinking over and over on the instances of bullying.\nEventually, they may experience panic attacks, which at\ntimes will be detected by others. If they abruptly leave a\nmeeting, this is observed with glee by the zero-empathy\nemployee. When someone under attack cannot leave a posi-\ntion or if there is no other source of relief, depression's end\nstate is realized. In this state of emotional paralysis, employ-\nees find it difficult to function in the workplace or anywhere\nelse. Physical illness may follow, and whatever the conse-\nquences of the abuse on targeted employees, their families\nwill also experience collateral damage.\n6 SAGE Open\nDavia Temin (2010), a workplace consultant, urges those\ncaught in these workplace situations to trust their instincts, if\nthey suspect that a sociopath has infiltrated the company. She\nencourages affected persons to keep records, including taped\nconversations, if allowed in their states, and to keep all\nemails that may pertain to abuse of any kind. Temin also\ncounsels targets to defend themselves with the truth, and not\nto let a lie go unchallenged. Sooner, rather than later, she sug-\ngests that affected persons leave the company, as it often\ntakes justice in these situations a long time to win out. It is\nbetter to leave with one's physical and mental abilities intact\nthan to wait too long. Finally, Temin urges employees to sup-\nport each other in the workplace, to the extent this is possi-\nble. Good people rarely recognize evil, as this kind of\nbehavior is incomprehensible to them. Under these circum-\nstances, the friendship of those who stay rational in these\nsituations is vital.\nHelp for affected individuals is available on a number of\nwebsites, including the Workplace Bullying Institute (2017),\nwhich offers self-help advice and personal coaching for indi-\nviduals targeted for workplace abuse. They also collect and\ncoordinate research associated with workplace bullying\nworldwide, and promote legislative advocacy on behalf of a\nsafe and positive work environment.\nFurther Research\nMoving forward in the attempt to mitigate the destructiveness\nof sociopaths in the workplace will require studies that\ndevelop more highly sophisticated and accurate screening\ntools for use in the hiring practice. Surveys that identify effec-\ntive methods of approaching HR for help in situations that\nsuggest sociopathic activity and those that document legal\narguments successful in prosecuting those who have been so\nidentified would also be valuable. Similar surveys could help-\nfully identify and share ways that workplace colleagues and\nunions provide support for victims of sociopathic assault.\nSummary\nThis article proposes the study of workplace abuse by means\nof a theoretical model drawn from recent research in neuro-\nscience, and from the psychological literature concerned\nwith individuals who intentionally harm those with whom\nthey associate. The proposed explanation of this abuse iden-\ntifies the employees targeted for abuse as competent and\nrespected individuals in the workplace. These persons are\nselected by one or more zero-empathy individuals who inten-\ntionally cause distress and anxiety in their targeted associ-\nates. Lacking a conscience, they enjoy inflicting pain on\nbetter qualified employees and gain satisfaction from the\npower they are able to demonstrate in bringing down a well-\nregarded colleague. Leaders of these attacks select other\nweaker employees to assist in the bullying of the targeted\nemployee. They, in turn, join in on the abuse, either out of\nfear or because they have something to gain in being associ-\nated with a power source that will protect them, in return for\ntheir loyalty. Members of the whisper campaign are low-\nempathy employees who enjoy discussing the pain and mis-\nfortunes of their fellow employees. Those targeted are urged\nto recognize when this kind of abuse is occurring, to resist\nself-blame, and to leave the situation, if at all possible.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAsghar, R.
