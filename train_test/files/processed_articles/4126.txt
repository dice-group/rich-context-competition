    "abstract": "Abstract\nStrong professionals who influence the development of healthcare services have domi-\nnated healthcare organizations for many years. However, this dominance has been\nchallenged recently through patient involvement. One method of achieving patient\ninvolvement is experience-based co-design (EBCD), in which patients and healthcare\nprofessionals work together to improve care. Patient involvement has considerable\npotential, but also presents certain challenges. This article addresses these challenges\nusing experiences from patients and healthcare professionals who participated in two\naction research projects that aimed to improve patient experienced quality using EBCD\nin pediatric care. The paper shows that patient involvement in quality improvements can\nchallenge the traditional roles of professionals and patients by new roles as\nco-designers. The role as co-designer embraces new perspectives for healthcare pro-\nfessionals that force them to step out of their comfort zone. Accordingly, healthcare\nprofessionals are able to view patients as equal partners in improvement work.\nReflecting dialogues during the projects offered eye-opening stories for patients and\nhealthcare professionals that enabled them to construct a common picture of care. The\ncontribution of this study is strengthening earlier research that argues that an action\nresearch approach can strengthen important values for successful EBCD projects: equal\npartnerships, new roles, and dialogue. The findings show that the combination of EBCD\nand action research is a promising approach to address the challenges of patient involve-\nment in healthcare improvement.\nAction Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/arj\nCorresponding author:\nSusanne MK Gustavsson, Skaraborgs sjukhus, Plan 3 adm Gula Gatan, 541 85 Sko\n\u00a8vde, Sweden.\nEmail: susanne.m.gustavsson@vgregion.se\n",

Based\non experiences from joint improvement efforts in service industries in general\n(Carbonell, Rodri\u00b4guez-Escudero, & Pujari, 2009; Witell, Kristensson,\nGustafsson, & Lo\n\u00a8 fgren, 2011), patients are also likely to be important resources\nin healthcare improvement by contributing knowledge from their personal\nexperiences.\nHowever, patient involvement practices are often problematic and have there-\nfore not been widespread in healthcare (Luxford, Gelb Safran, & Delblanco, 2011).\nStrong professional dominance in healthcare has been the main explanation for\ndifficulties in involving patients in ongoing care activities or improvements\n(Luxford et al., 2011). The presence of strong professionals such as physicians,\nnurses, etc. in healthcare is an advantage, in that they bring the benefit of their\nknowledge, but also a challenge because it can be hard for management to influence\nmedical professions in society is based on trust that professionals always put the\nbest interests of the patient first (Wilensky, 1964). However, researchers have also\nargued that professionals actively guard their arenas and positions by ensuring that\nthey dominate their knowledge domain, precluding other actors from challenging\ntheir decisions (Abbott, 1988; Freidson, 2001). Allowing patients to access this\nknowledge domain challenge the status and identity of professionals (Andersson,\n2015). Thus, a professional logic has two competing characteristics--service ideal\nbut have different implications. The service ideal means that a professional, acting\naltruistically, always works in the best interest of the client. Professional dominance\nis the egocentric belief that only a professional knows what is best for a client/\npatient (Liff & Andersson, 2011). These competing characteristics explain why joint\nimprovement efforts involving patients and healthcare professionals are a natural\nevolution based on the altruistic service ideal in professional logic, but also chal-\nlenge the very core of professional logic considering egocentric professional\ndominance.\nDespite several examples of mutual gains with positive and sustainable improve-\nment results, the clash between these logics entails inevitable challenges\nwhen healthcare professionals and patients are involved in joint improvements\nMaher, 2008). New roles and approaches are required for both healthcare profes-\nsionals and patients. Luxford, Gelb Safran, and Delblanco (2011, p. 513) argued\nthat one barrier to moving from a ``provider focus'' to a ``patient focus'' is chan-\nging ``the mindset of employees.'' Staff may also feel that involving patients in\nimprovements is time-consuming and competes with daily work tasks (Donetto,\nOne method of involving patients in healthcare improvement is experience-\nbased co-design (EBCD), in which healthcare professionals and patients use their\nown experiences as pivotal points of departure for developmental efforts in order to\ndescribed as an action research (AR) method (Robert, 2013), even if it often is\nused as an improvement method without research ambitions. In Sweden, where the\ncurrent study took place, EBCD has only been an improvement method.\nCombining EBCD and AR means adding a research part to EBCD and also\ntaking advantage of AR's ability to support conditions that enable development\nand change, such as equal power distribution between healthcare professionals and\npatients as they jointly contribute knowledge to the healthcare system (Hughes,\nfew studies have provided insight into the effects of combining EBCD and AR\nIn the present article, we address the challenges of patient involvement in health-\ncare quality improvements by describing experiences from patients and healthcare\nprofessionals who collaborated in AR projects, by using EBCD in pediatric care\nsettings at a Swedish hospital. Involving patients in the research process results in\nco-production of knowledge, sustainable change, and translation of knowledge\n(Gillard, Simons, Turner, Lucock, & Edwards, 2012). However, few research\npapers have explored the benefits of combining EBCD and AR, and studies on\nEBCD have mainly been case studies that report outcomes from improvement\nprojects (see Bowen, Dearden, Wolstenholme, & Cobb, 2011; Boyd, McKernon,\nPrevious research\nThis section includes a brief overview of previous research in the field of patient\ninvolvement in improving healthcare and, more specifically, the EBCD method.\nPatient involvement in healthcare improvements\nPatient involvement is a central aspect of sustainable healthcare (Lifvergren et al.,\npatients may take greater responsibility for their own care, for managing healthcare\nservices, and for improving the quality of care.\nOne step towards patient involvement may entail using patient experiences to\nevaluate care as a basis for improvements executed by healthcare professionals\n(Coulter, Locock, Ziebland, & Calabrese, 2014). Healthcare organizations have\ngone a step further in recent years, emphasizing public and patient involvement\nGustavsson and Andersson 3\nin service development and participation in decisions around one's own treatment\n(Tritter & McCallum, 2006), which implies a view of active patients as co-produ-\ncers of healthcare quality (Bate & Robert, 2006; Lengnick-Hall, Claycomb, & Inks,\nThere is a lack of research about improvement projects that involve patients\nparticipating together with healthcare professionals. However, Crawford et al.\n(2002) described how the experience of participating in joint improvements can\ndiffer between patients and healthcare professionals. Patients welcomed the invita-\ntion to participate and their self-esteem often improved as a result of their contri-\nbutions. However, they sometimes felt the process was unsatisfactory as it was not\nintended to devolve power to patients, but to legitimize decisions made by health-\ncare professionals. In an additional study (Engstro\nmotives for patients to join were identified: restitution after poor treatment, desire\nfor contact with others, volunteerism, desire to make a contribution, or the enjoy-\nment of having a task to complete. Crawford et al. (2002) described that healthcare\nprofessionals found the experience rewarding, but also described difficulties in their\nrelationship with patients; for instance, decision-making processes were slowed\ndown. However, organizations became more open to involving patients and the\nprojects had a general effect on organizational attitudes.\nBowen and Wright (2010) described further challenges, which included a conflict\nbetween patient involvement and professional values and daily habits.\nFurthermore, even when professionals were positive to patient involvement,\nthere was a gap between values and practice (Lord & Gale, 2014). Because\nthe experiences of healthcare professionals and patients can differ, a collaborative\napproach is needed in order to capture as many areas of improvement as\npossible (Gustavsson, 2014). In addition, if patients--who are the experts in\ntheir own experiences--are given the opportunity to be involved in the health ser-\nvice improvement and design, a shift may occur in expertise and, in turn, in the\npower relations between patients and professionals (cf. Tritter & McCallum, 2006).\nAccordingly, patient involvement in improvement work needs careful manage-\nment if it is to realize its full potential (Armstrong, Herbert, Aveling, Dixon-\ninvolve patients in improvement initiatives, but lack knowledge and experience\net al., 2010). While it is important to use patients' unique experiences when striving\nfor higher healthcare quality, the challenges must be illuminated. Successful col-\nlaborative improvements in healthcare require courage to change the current roles\nfor patients and healthcare professionals.\nExperience-based co-design\nBate and Robert (2007) developed the EBCD method in collaboration with the\nNHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. AR was used as an approach to\ntest new methods of involving patients in improvement efforts on equal terms with\nhealthcare professionals. The EBCD methodology was inspired by several research\napproaches: participatory action research, user-centered design, learning theories,\nand a narrative-based approach (Bate & Robert, 2007). In EBCD, healthcare\nprofessionals and patients work together in four steps: capturing experiences,\nunderstanding experiences, improvement, and follow-up (Bate & Robert, 2006,\n2007; Tsianakas et al., 2012). During these phases, storytelling is a basic foundation\nfor improvements, and there are opportunities to engage in dialogue that supports\nlearning among individuals, groups, and organizations.\nThe first examples of EBCD in healthcare came from a head-and-neck cancer\nquently used elsewhere, such as emergency health services (Iedema et al., 2010),\nbreast and lung cancer services (Boyd et al., 2012; Tsianakas et al., 2012), neonatal\ncare (Gustavsson, 2014), outpatient services for the elderly (Bowen et al., 2011),\nand mental health (Larkin et al., 2015).\nThe results of such collaborative improvement projects included fast access to\nreliable health advice, effective treatment delivered by trusted professionals,\ninvolvement in decisions, respect for preferences, clear and comprehensible infor-\nmation and support for self-care, and attention to physical and environmental\nneeds (Maher & Baxter, 2009). A collaborative approach can tackle both simple\nand complex problems (Gustavsson, 2014). Even if the accomplishments are small,\nseveral improvements simultaneously or within a relatively short time can produce\na vast shift in the entire experience and may lead to deeper, longer-term changes in\nattitudes and behaviors (Robert et al., 2015).\nAccording to Pickles, Hide, and Maher (2008), the EBCD methodology ensures\nthat healthcare professionals draw upon the experiences of patients and their\nfamilies in order to truly reflect on patient needs. These experiences help the par-\nticipants see their care pathway from different perspectives with an emotional\ntouch (Iedema et al., 2010). The EBCD methodology is a process in which\npeople who have everyday experiential knowledge combine with people who\nhave expert knowledge (specialist, discipline-based) and the two knowledge systems\nenrich one another (Bate & Robert, 2007). Hence, the dynamic process is a complex\nsocial intervention that has an impact that can be difficult to evaluate (Iedema\net al., 2010). Furthermore, the process depends on the participants' personal devel-\nopment; changes in the healthcare professionals' motivation, skills, and self-con-\nfidence; and the development of trust and new relationships between the various\nparticipants (Donetto et al., 2014). The novelty of EBCD is that patients are\ninvolved in all phases, not only sharing their experiences, but also positioned as\nactive partners with healthcare professionals (Tsianakas et al., 2012). If the\nimprovement process leads to new understandings, relationships, and engagement,\nit can potentially support a more equal partnership between patients and health-\ncare professionals (Iedema et al., 2010).\nCollaboration under these circumstances is challenging because few social or\ndiscursive rules for co-design processes currently exist. For instance, the role of\nimprover has been reserved for healthcare professionals. Other challenges include\nGustavsson and Andersson 5\nengaging people's commitment to the idea of collaborative improvements and\ntalking about their experiences. EBCD is sometimes seen as impractical because\nthe methodology (such as conducting interviews or making films) is time-consum-\ning and the corresponding number of improvements made may be relatively small\nAnother challenge is that the EBCD approach shifts the focus from a strong\nmanagement orientation to a more user-centric organizational approach, which\nmay lead to promising future developmental directions (Bate & Robert, 2007).\nEBCD as an AR approach\nAn AR approach may strengthen EBCD project outcomes by enhancing scientific\nand ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority and increasing credibility\nand participation (Payne et al., 2011). Iedema et al. (2010) suggested that EBCD\ncombined with AR is related to four discursive domains of co-design as: (i) a\ndeliberative process that engages patients and healthcare professionals, (ii) a reflex-\nive process, (iii) a research methodological capacity-building process, and (iv) a\ndialogic process through which practical improvements can be consequential.\nThese domains, which arise when EBCD and AR are combined, align with the\nprocess of knowledge development in AR that Reason and Torbert (2001)\ndescribed, which include cycles that generate experiential, presentational, propos-\nitional, and practical knowledge. The four steps in EBCD: capturing experiences,\nunderstanding experiences, improving, and following up (Bate & Robert, 2006) are\nsimilar to the AR cycle described by Coghlan and Brannick (2008) (see Table 1).\nEven though there are similarities between EBCD and AR there are benefits of\nthe combination. One is the reflection that occurs through AR that may not be\nfound in ordinary improvement projects using EBCD. A reflection process that\ngoes beyond the actual project, when the research process continues. In addition,\neach step in the EBCD process can be strengthened by the experiential learning\ncycle: experiencing, reflection, interpreting, and then taking action (Coghlan &\nBrannick, 2008). Reflective inquiry in AR can be from first-, second-, and third-\nreflections on ``. . . changing practices, ways of thinking and quality of attention''\n(Torbert & Taylor, 2008, p. 240) and is vital for developing critical subjectivity\n(Burgess, Pirkis, & Coombs, 2006). Second-person inquiry entails collective\nlearning within a group of people, such as organizational learning, and third-\nperson inquiry concerns the theoretical contributions to academia (Torbert &\nMethod\nThe research approach was based on AR and the study design was inductive and\nqualitative. The authors sought to analyze and describe the experiences of\nresearchers, healthcare professionals, and patients who participated in projects that\ncombined EBCD and AR, and to address the challenges. Consequently, we chose a\nqualitative approach for its relevance for analyzing practical implications, social\nrelations, and verbal and textual data, in an attempt to achieve an in-depth\nunderstanding of the phenomenon (Flick, 2009).\nInsider action researcher\nDuring the first part of the AR process, the first author functioned mainly as a\nmethod facilitator, guiding the teams through the EBCD phases. She had previ-\nously worked as a midwife in the organization, but here she took the role of an\ninsider action researcher (IAR), which presented both advantages and challenges.\nOn one hand, the author felt like an insider; someone who was familiar with the\norganization, the other people working there, and had experience of caring for\nchildren in neonatal care and children with diabetes. On the other hand, in her\nrole as an IAR, she felt as though the participants viewed her as an outsider,\nsomeone who was no longer active in the workplace. She had to consider these\ndifferent roles in the reflective process. The most difficult aspect of this process was\nabstracting the practical issues and experiences into theoretical reflections;\nhowever, as a doctoral student, she could turn to her university supervisors for\nassistance. It is not uncommon for someone conducting AR in his or her own\norganization to feel confused about his or her different roles (De Guerre, 2002;\nThe second author participated in the diabetes project as the father of a daugh-\nter with diabetes, but then also took an active role during the writing of this paper.\nAs a researcher in healthcare management, he has experience in healthcare organ-\nizations as an outsider, but has never worked in healthcare. He enrolled in the\nproject with no research plans, but after the completion of the improvement project\nhe was invited to participate in a joint writing project with the first author.\nThe second author recognized that the different roles he had played during the\nprocess provided various perspectives. During the improvement project, the second\nauthor was an insider to some extent, as a participating, committed father with the\ngoal of improving diabetes care for children. At the same time, he was an outsider\nin the organization compared to the first author. During the writing process, the\nTable 1.

These various perspectives\nenhanced the reflective capacity of the AR process.\nContext\nThis paper is based on two AR projects in pediatric care processes in a Swedish\nhospital. The pediatric division has worked with quality improvement processes for\napproximately 10 years, but has only had modest patient involvement.\nThe first project, the neo project, was located in the neonatal care department\nand involved healthcare professionals from the delivery, maternity, and neonatal\nwards. The participants in the neo project included nurses, midwives, and nursing\nassistants (n \u00bc 7); and parents (n \u00bc 5; two fathers and three mothers). The mothers\nhad two perspectives: that of a patient giving birth and that of a parent of a child\nneeding neonatal care.\nThe second project, the diabetes project, focused on care processes for children\nwith diabetes and involved the children's medical department and outpatient clinic.\nFour fathers and three mothers of diabetic children participated, together with\nseven healthcare professionals (three nurses, a physician, a psychologist, a social\nworker, and an improvement facilitator).\nThe term ``patient'' as used in the two projects includes mothers as patients when\ngiving birth, their partners, and parents as spokespersons for their sick children.\nBoth projects lasted for about nine months and were inspired by EBCD, with\nfour phases: capturing, understanding, improving, and following up experiences\n(Figure 1).\nThe outcomes, in the form of established improvements in the patient processes,\nhave been described in earlier publications (Gustavsson, 2014; Gustavsson et al.,\n(1) Capturing experiences\nThe first phase was capturing the experiences, in which patients and healthcare\nprofessionals were interviewed individually. The interviews, which lasted approxi-\nmately 60\u00ad90 minutes, were recorded and transcribed. One open-ended question was\nused: Can you describe your experiences of the care process, and how you felt in\nvarious situations? The first author documented the mentioned situations and\nrelated feelings in an ``emotional map,'' which consisted of a timeline that compiled\npatient processes with experiences from all individual interviews. One map consisted\nof patients' experiences and another of the healthcare professionals' experiences.\n(2) Understanding experiences\nThe second phase was understanding the experiences. In this phase, all the\npatients/relatives met to agree on the contents of the map and to highlight\ncommon improvement areas. A similar meeting was held with all healthcare pro-\nfessionals. Thereafter, both groups met for a reflection dialogue in which the two\ngroups listened to each other's experiences and identified ``touch points'' of joint\nimprovement areas. A list of prioritized improvement areas was developed\ncollaboratively.\n(3) Improving experiences\nDuring the third phase--improving--the healthcare professionals and patients/\nrelatives worked in groups or pairs to solve problems using the plan, do, study, act\n(PDSA) cycle (Deming, 1986). Some participants met during the improvement\nwork and others met via telephone and/or e-mail. The improvement facilitator\nsupported this phase.\n(4) Follow-up meeting\nApproximately three months after the improvement phase started, a follow-up\nmeeting was held in which participants in the project groups presented the com-\npleted improvements. These meetings also included ward managers, who supported\nthe accomplishment of some improvements that required managerial involvement.\nDuring the meeting, participants also reflected on the methodology and highlighted\nthe challenges and advantages they had experienced in the combined EBCD/AR\nprojects. After the meeting, the IAR distributed a questionnaire that captured the\nparticipants' experiences of the EBCD/AR process in order to complement the\njoint reflections.\nTable 2 provides a more detailed picture of the projects' time lines and activities.\nIndividual interviews\nwith parents\nIndividual interviews\nwith staff\nFocus group\nwith parents\nFocus group\nwith staff\nFocus group\nwith parents\nand staff\nExperiences and feelings are captured\nImprovement areas are identified\n\"Touch Points\" are identified\nFollow-up meeting with parents, staff and managers\nCollaborative improvements\nAction-\nresearch\nFigure 1.

How do we move forward? What did we learn?\nData collection and analysis\nThis paper draws upon three sources of empirical material: recorded and tran-\nscribed reflective dialogues from all the group meetings in both projects, a ques-\ntionnaire regarding the participants' experiences after project completion, and the\nIAR's field notes during the project. Each project had six or seven group meetings\n(see Table 2). The questionnaire was sent by mail to 28 recipients and had a\nresponse rate of 61 percent. The questions were open-ended. Examples of questions\ninclude: How was your experience of attending a project in which patients and\nhealthcare professionals collaborated? How do you think that the improvement\nwork was affected by the fact that patients and healthcare professionals\ncollaborated?\nData were analyzed in three stages. First, we used first-person inquiry, based on\nthe first author's reflections of being an IAR. The first author kept a personal diary\nduring the project. The notes in the diary contained different experiences during the\nprocess that contributed to learning, e.g. situations that felt difficult or positive.\nSecond, we used qualitative analysis to examine transcripts of the group meetings\nand the questionnaires (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004) and perform a second-\nperson inquiry of the project participants' reflections and learning. The texts\nwere read several times in order to capture, code, and translate units of meaning\ninto categories and themes. The third-person inquiry stage of the analysis consisted\nof reflections on the theoretical contribution to research. The reflection was man-\naged through dialogues between the IAR and other researchers. The reflection\nand analysis continued between the IAR and the co-author during the writing\nof this paper.\nThe validity of this study is based on the deliberate, conscious adoption of the\nAR cycle of planning, taking action, and evaluating the action, which in turn leads\nto further planning. Reliability was ensured by having different parties in both the\nacademic and organizational settings triangulate data. For example, after the first\nauthor had analyzed interviews with patients and healthcare professionals, the\nresult was brought back to them in an emotional map for confirmation. Such\ntriangulation strengthens the trustworthiness of research (Bryman & Bell, 2007;\nCoghlan & Brannick, 2008). The generalizability of this study is analytical\nrather than statistical (Bryman & Bell, 2007) and the lessons learned during this\nproject can support learning for others.\nCollaboration on equal premises during the project provided a valuable ethical\nsafeguard. Participants took part in the study voluntarily and were informed\nthat they could withdraw at any time. Before starting the projects and the research,\nwe received ethical approval from the ethical review board in Gothenburg\nExperiential lessons from the combined EBCD/AR\nprojects\nThe findings are based on reflections in first-, second- and third-person inquiry,\ncompiled and presented as four themes (see Figure 2).\nEye-opening stories (A) is a theme that leads to the construction of a common\npicture (B). The third theme is new challenging roles (C), which leads to healthcare\nprofessionals leaving their comfort zone (D). The themes will be further presented\nwith descriptive quotations from patients and healthcare professionals.\nEye-opening stories\nDuring the improvement process, patients and healthcare professionals had the\nopportunity to speak about their own experiences and reflect collaboratively\nabout the narratives. When they spoke about their own experiences they were\nable to reflect on their memories of the care process and they said they felt good\nabout being able to recall situations that mattered to them. One parent said the\nexperience reminded her of psychotherapy:\nIt was so nice to talk with others who had the same, similar experiences--others who\ntruly understand what you are going through. (Parent in the diabetes project)\nPatients and healthcare professionals affirmed each other's experiences, first in the\ngroup meeting and later when meeting others:\nThey [healthcare professionals] were shocked by our bad experiences, which also made\nit feel like we were ``on the same side.'' (Parent in the diabetes project)\nPatients said that this process involved ``eye-opening stories.'' One strength of the\nEBCD method was that it enabled participants to listen to stories face-to-face,\nwhich they felt gave the improvement areas more attention and dignity. In add-\nition, healthcare professionals confirmed the patients' stories and could ask ques-\ntions and give comments that contributed to a common understanding of the\nEye-opening stories\nConstrucng a\ncommon picture\nNew challenging roles Healthcare professionals\nleaving their comfort zone\nFigure 2. Four themes.\nGustavsson and Andersson 13\nexperiences. Professionals stated that it is very easy to have limited vision, and that\nthis way of working on improvements was revealing.\nYou can easily become ``blind.'' One thinks differently depending on whether one is a\npatient or a healthcare professional. It is great [to see] with fresh parent/patient eyes.\n(Nurse in the neo project)\nThe professionals often thought they knew what was best for patients, but small\nthings that may not matter greatly to professionals can be very important to\npatients. The professionals also mentioned the positive effect of dialogues with\npeople from other wards in the project groups:\nWe understand each other better, now that we know a little more about each other's\nactivities. (Midwife in the neo project)\nNew perspectives on situations in the care process supported learning and strength-\nened collaboration between wards. Patients and healthcare professionals were\ninspired by the combined improvement/research approach and said the process\ntook advantage of and helped to develop creative ideas.\nThe IAR continually sought to reduce the gap between the experiences of pro-\nfessionals and patients and supported the creation of spaces for dialogues in which\nparticipants could co-construct a joint picture of the patient journey. For example,\nthe IAR raised situations from the interviews that could be improvement areas, and\nsuggested action.\nConstructing a common picture\nHealthcare professionals and patients increased their understanding of how various\nsituations in the care process could be experienced. The reflective dialogues con-\nfirmed that the two groups took each other seriously. Professionals had to listen\nto the patients first, instead of giving directives and instructions. Patients highlighted\nthe positive effects of ``bouncing'' their experiences off the professionals. The dia-\nlogue had synergistic effects, such as mutual understanding and development of\nimprovement ideas. According to patients, this kind of dialogue felt rare in ordinary\ncare meetings, which tend to focus on biomedical aspects. The collaborative reflec-\ntions provided opportunities for seeing situations from different perspectives, and\nparticipants gained new understanding of the care process. For example, there were\nsome situations that patients and healthcare professionals experienced in totally\ndifferent ways. Both groups felt that a diversity of views came together during the\nprojects in order to arrive at a more common perspective of patient processes.\nParticipants said it felt good to share and listen to other people's experiences.\nI learned that my ``little banal'' thoughts and experiences made a big difference in the\ncare of other patients. It feels incredible and very beautiful. (Mother in the neo project)\nPatients in the diabetes project saw particular value in meeting each other and\nengaged in active dialogues about their experiences. During the project they started\nan association for families with children with diabetes. The participants did not\nexperience the work process as arduous, but rather as a good and fascinating\nendeavor.\nVery nice! Good to work with them (healthcare professionals) and nice to be taken\nseriously. (Parent in the diabetes project)\nDialogues and collaboration were foundations in the improvement work. During\nthe dialogues, the patients and healthcare professionals also reflected on the\nimprovement process and pros and cons of EBCD.\nNew challenging roles\nParticipants felt that the power relationship between professionals and patients was\nmore equalized in the improvement/research process than in relationships in an\nordinary care episode:\nAs a patient you might not dare to give as much feedback to the healthcare profes-\nsionals, but when you work together like this where everyone is on the same terms, it\nwas very positive. (Mother in the neo project)\nThe patients found their role different and more equal than in their usual role as\npatients. They reported they were positively disposed to being part of the improve-\nment team and contributing to better care for sick children. The improvement/\nresearch approach enabled participants to get to know each other and supported\nthe collaboration in the groups.\nIt was also nice to learn about healthcare professionals behind the role. The collab-\noration became somehow more humane. (Parent in the diabetes project)\nOne parent stated being able to help with anything that could lead to better health\nfor her child was beneficial and that it felt ``great'' to avoid the powerlessness that\notherwise comes with being the parent of a sick child.\nThe patients' new role was initially uncomfortable for most professionals, who\ndid not know how to handle it. The patients initially showed a higher attendance\nand commitment than the professionals. One of the improvement facilitators in the\ndiabetes project felt frustrated that the professionals did not show commitment\nfrom the beginning:\nIt felt strange and frustrating that the healthcare professionals did not receive the\ninput and offer of assistance to the same extent as the offers were given by parents.\n(Improvement facilitator in the diabetes project)\nGustavsson and Andersson 15\nDuring the projects, those people involved obviously acted in new roles. The pro-\nfessionals were unused to encounters with the patients in their ``improvement role.''\nThe healthcare professionals were initially anxious to take responsibility for all\nthe improvements in the projects. The IAR had to suggest collaboration with\npatients and support joint improvement work. The IAR noted that the profes-\nsionals appeared to be ashamed that they might not have provided good experi-\nences for the patients. They felt motivated to improve because they thought it was\ntheir duty to do so, and the role of a patient/parent as an improver seemed odd.\nSome patients' suggestions for improvements and knowledge exceeded those of\nthe professionals. This difference contrasted with normal practice, in which pro-\nfessionals are usually superior based on their professional medical competence.\nHence, in the final stages of the projects, the professionals expressed that the role\nof patients as co-designers was obvious and should always be considered in all\nhealthcare improvement projects. Patients shared that expectation:\nI hope that you are satisfied and continue to use us patients for development purposes.\n(Parent in the neo project)\nIt feels like the right way to do improvement work. We as healthcare professionals\ncannot know how patients experience different situations if we don't ask them. (Ward\nmanager in the neo project)\nOne of the nurses in the diabetes project stated:\nWe work as a team and I am probably a ``team person'' and believe in the synergy\neffect of more value, if we can have a stimulating dialogue.\nThe professionals were keen to have continued collaboration with patients in future\nimprovement initiatives. The improvement projects were considered successful, and\nparticipants were surprised about what could be accomplished.\nIt is absolutely necessary to work in this way! Good improvements, not difficult to\nimplement, but healthcare professionals do not find them by themselves. (Manager in\nthe neonatal project)\nIn the follow-up meetings, participants found it valuable and gratifying to hear\nabout successfully completed improvements. There was also a feeling that long-\nterm relations were being built between patients and healthcare professionals.\nHealthcare professionals leaving the comfort zone\nThe fourth emergent theme was stepping out of one's comfort zone, which relates\nto established patterns of improvement work that were challenged in the projects.\nInitially, the healthcare professionals were not excited about the idea of working\nwith patients in improvement projects. This attitude was particularly evident in the\ndiabetes project because the patients and professionals still had a care relationship,\nwhereas in the neonatal project the patients had ended their care episode. Parents\ninitially found it strange to work collaboratively on improvements; they were\nunused to coming up with suggestions for how to improve their children's care.\nThe professionals also felt uncomfortable and feared being criticized or accused of\nnot doing their work well. At the initial collaborative meetings, both parties felt\nnervous and tense.\nThere was a certain excitement and anxiety in the air at the beginning, but it decreased\nlater on. (Improvement facilitator in the diabetes project)\nThe improvement facilitators noted that the patients were much more engaged in\nthe mission than the professionals during the first meetings. Later on in the project,\ntensions disappeared and the collaborative improvement work went more\nsmoothly.\nPatients and healthcare professionals believed that patients can help drive\nimprovement projects and are an untapped resource for healthcare. Professionals\nalone cannot identify all the improvement areas that matter to patients. During the\nprojects, healthcare professionals became aware of new information and collabor-\nation between professionals and patients became a natural way of working with\nimprovements. Patients expressed trust in the approach and sought increased use of\nEBCD in healthcare.\nIt feels very good and natural as a patient to be involved and make suggestions for\nimprovement through experiences. (Parent in the neo project)\nDiscussion\nThis section starts with a discussion of the findings in relation to earlier research\nand then discusses the benefits of combining AR and EBCD.\nStrong professionals in healthcare have traditionally not allowed patients to be\ninvolved in improvement work (Andersson, 2015). The present paper shares experi-\nences that may be of value when testing new approaches to develop healthcare that\ninvolve patients in collaboration with healthcare professionals.\nOne experience that the patients and healthcare professionals shared in the\nprojects in this paper was that the variety of perspectives from participants stimu-\nlated different interpretations of the experiences and the findings that emerged. The\npatients had the whole picture of the process, whereas healthcare professionals saw\nonly occasional episodes and were sometimes blind to the patient's experience.\nThus, the patients have important insights about how to make improvements.\nThis information can be important for quality improvement work in healthcare,\nas argued in earlier research (Bate & Robert, 2006). Luxford et al. (2011) claimed\nthat the most common barrier to an increased patient focus is the attitude of\nGustavsson and Andersson 17\nprofessionals. In the presented projects the professionals developed a ``patient-\nfocused'' mindset during the reflective dialogues; in that way, the dialogues\nhelped cross the above-mentioned barrier. Bate and Robert (2007) highlighted\nthat EBCD can help to approach the shift from a strong management orientation\nto a more user-centric organizational approach. It is important for healthcare\nprofessionals to realize that the care they think they provide is not always the\ncare that patients experience (Larkin et al., 2015). During the reflective dialogues,\nparticipants in the studies constructed a common picture of the care process. These\ndialogues helped reduce the gap between the experiences of patients and of health-\ncare professionals and helped to identify and prioritize improvement areas. Earlier\nresearch related to reflecting dialogues in AR aligns with these findings (Reason &\nParticipation in the projects challenged existing roles that had been assumed by\nprofessionals (Luxford et al., 2011) and patients, and challenged them to develop\nnew roles as co-designers during the improvement process. The collaborative\napproach contributed to learning in the context of the professional\u00adpatient rela-\ntionship and the patients in this study perceived an increase in equality between\nprofessionals and themselves. Patients highlighted the different role that the pro-\njects offered them, which was unlike what they were used to when meeting with\nhealthcare professionals. These findings support earlier research related to new\nunderstanding, relationships, and a more equal partnership (Iedema et al., 2010).\nThe AR approach supported reflections about patient involvement in improve-\nments, and the IAR observed a decreased professional dominance and an empow-\nered patient role. This finding aligns with earlier research that indicated a power\nstructure shift between patients and healthcare professionals (Tritter & McCallum,\n2006). In the diabetes project, a social network was funded to support a sustainable\nco-design relationship between healthcare professionals and patients. In the pro-\njects, the combination of EBCD and AR helped healthcare professionals to leave\ntheir comfort zone and venture into projects that entailed new roles and a new set\nof medical practices.\nPrevious work on EBCD has shown that patient involvement can lever-\nage healthcare improvement (Bate & Robert 2006), but the present study\nshows four ways in which AR can enhance this effect: (1) reflective dialogue,\n(2) knowledge development beyond the actual project, (3) greater legitimacy,\nand (4) interplay between EBCD and AR enable results beyond each of the\napproaches:\n(1) EBCD is based on sharing experiences--mainly listening to others--while AR\nprovides a reflective dialogue on these experiences, which promotes a\ncommon view of care practices (see Iedema et al., 2010). Reflective dialogues\nduring the projects affected the outcomes in several ways. Both individual and\ncollaborative reflections were stimulated by the preconditions for dialogue\nthat AR brought to the EBCD process (Iedema et al., 2010; Reason &\nTorbert, 2001). Arenas for dialogues were provided several times during all\nsteps of the project. Participants also engaged individually in reflective practice\nafter the project, as first-person inquiry when completing the questionnaire.\n(2) Knowledge development became more extensive because reflection goes\nbeyond the actual improvement project to include patient involvement, gen-\neral improvement work, and the quality of specific care processes (in this case,\ncare for diabetic children and neonatal care).\n(3) The research agenda lent greater legitimacy to the project and widened the\nimpact of the results, which is also mentioned in earlier research (Payne et al.,\n2011). For example, the projects have been presented at conferences and in\nnews articles, and the diabetes project has been included in films related to\nservice design. It can be assumed that a research agenda also will improve\nsustainability, as there is a responsibility to report a result.\n(4) The interplay between the EBCD methodology and the AR approach created\nvalue beyond each. This study illustrates that the AR approach can\nstrengthen the conditions that previous research has shown to be important\nfor successful EBCD projects: equal partnership, new roles, and dialogue. The\ncollaborative power of dedicated healthcare professionals and patients\nresulted in collaborative learning and several accomplished improvements\nThe dynamic processes of AR and EBCD strengthened the results of the actual\nimprovement projects and generated knowledge about patient involvement in qual-\nity improvement for the organization. However, the AR element caused the results\nto extend beyond the organization and also reach other healthcare organizations\nand the research community. A traditional research project without the ``action''\npart may not have supported knowledge development during the improvement\nwork or the participants' roles, as it did in this case.\nConclusion\nPatient involvement in healthcare improvement is challenging in many ways, but\nthis paper also shows the potential of AR and EBCD to influence both profes-\nsionals and patients to develop new roles as co-designers. Leaving their comfort\nzones, examining new ways of interacting with each other and sharing experiences\nall serve to promote eye-opening situations that will encourage healthcare profes-\nsionals to embrace new common pictures of care. Managers are often willing to\ninvolve patients in improvement work, but lack the knowledge and experience of\n2010). This paper may help fill that gap of knowledge and practical experience.\nThere is also a contribution in the area of shifting focus from healthcare profes-\nsionals to patients in healthcare improvements. Accordingly, the findings\nstrengthen earlier research and show that the combination of EBCD and AR is\na promising approach with which to address the challenges of patient involvement\nin healthcare improvement.\nGustavsson and Andersson 19\n"
