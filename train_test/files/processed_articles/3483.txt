    "abstract": "Abstract: Proponents of Terror Management Theory (TMT) argue that many facets\nof disgust serve to defend against existential anxiety accompanying cognizance of\none's mortality. Because the passage of time brings death closer, this view predicts\nthat the intensity of disgust elicited by reminders of death should increase with age.\nSkeptical of TMT, we conducted Internet-based studies using the instrument created\nby TMT proponents. Results reveal that age is negatively, not positively, correlated\nwith death disgust sensitivity, a pattern consistent with adaptive habituation rather\nthan terror management. The same result was obtained using in-person\nadministration of the instrument in Costa Rica, a society characterized by attitudes\ntoward death that differ from those of the U.S. Additional work in Costa Rica\ndemonstrated that, contrary to TMT predictions, attention to one's own death need\nnot increase disgust reactions to the body or its products. Both the evocative power of\ndeath stimuli and the negative effects of age on death disgust are consistent with the\nargument that disgust is an adaptation motivating disease avoidance rather than a\npsychodynamic defense mechanism.\n",

Paul Rozin and\nJonathan Haidt, the principal pioneers in this enterprise, have, together with their\nassociates, generated a large body of empirical findings, shedding new light on\ndisgust. Because their work constitutes a thematically coherent corpus, we refer to\nthis team collectively as the Rozin School. The Rozin School proposes that a disgust-\nlike emotion evolved to protect the body from the oral incorporation of pathogen- and\ntoxin-bearing substances (Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin,\ncontamination, disgust, the Rozin School argues, is readily extended to other\ndomains.\nA principal conceptual hazard that symbolically-mediated disgust ostensibly\nguards against is the recognition that humans are animals. Inspired by the work of\nanthropologist Ernest Becker (1973), and relying on the same premises as the\ntheoretical framework now known as Terror Management Theory (TMT) (see\nGreenberg, Solomon, and Pyszczynski, 1997 for review), the Rozin School claims\nthat knowledge of our own mortality induces existential anxiety, a condition that\nTMT proponents describe as a fitness-reducing paralytic state \u00ad consumed by an\nawareness of the inevitability of death, individuals are, it is postulated, unable to\nengage in the tasks that contribute to survival and reproductive success (Greenberg,\nSolomon, and Pyszczynski, 1997; Solomon, Greenberg, Schimel, Arndt, and\nPyszczynski, 2004). Because humans are aware that animals are mortal, being\nreminded of our animality provokes this paralyzing anxiety. Disgust is thus\npurportedly adaptively employed as a defense against existential terror, an\nexplanation invoked to account for the linkage between disgust and such stimuli as\ncontact with animals, body products, violations of the body envelope, and the dead\n(Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Kluck, and Cornwell, 2001; Haidt,\nHaidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore, 1999; Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, and Imada,\nConsistent with the above reasoning, the Rozin School and allied Terror\nManagement investigators hold that the application of disgust to the domain of sexual\nbehavior is motivated by a panhuman need to distance oneself from the animality of\nmating (Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, and Imada,\nand Solomon, 2002; Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Kluck, and\nRecently, we demonstrated that disgust sensitivity in the sexual domain, and only in\nthe sexual domain, increases as a function of the likelihood of conception across the\nmenstrual cycle (Fessler and Navarrete, 2003a). It is difficult to see how such\npatterned domain-specific changes in disgust sensitivity can be explained by the\nnotion that sexual disgust derives from an intense need to avoid recognition of one's\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nown mortality. In contrast, these changes are exactly what should be expected if\nwomen's sexual disgust is an evolved adaptation that reduces the probability of\nbiologically suboptimal sexual unions (e.g., incest, bestiality, etc.) during the fertile\nphase. This led us to question the Rozin School's oft-repeated claim that, rather than\ndirectly reflecting the workings of an evolved mechanism, many aspects of disgust\nexperience instead constitute an attempt to avoid existential terror. We therefore\nsought to examine the domain in which the postulated phenomenon ought to loom\nmost large, namely disgust reactions to stimuli that are overtly associated with death.\nIf, as TMT proponents argue (Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,\n2000), disgust responses to reminders of death constitute an attempt to avoid the\nanxiety attending the recognition that we are mortal, and if, as part of that\nrecognition, each of us knows that the passage of time inexorably brings us closer to\nthe day that we will die, then disgust sensitivity in the death domain should increase\nwith age, since the motivation to deny our impending death should be enhanced as the\nfateful day draws closer.1\nAlthough Quigley, Sherman, and Sherman (1997) noted that disgust\nsensitivity declines with age, their study focused only on young adults, and they\nreport only overall disgust sensitivity, rather than disgust sensitivity by domain;\nsimilar considerations apply to Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley's observation that `There\nare hints ... that disgust sensitivity declines after the teen years,' (2000, p. 648). In\nthe course of our investigation of changes in disgust sensitivity over the menstrual\ncycle, using the same instrument employed by both Quigley, Sherman, and Sherman\nand the Rozin School, we also found a decline in overall disgust sensitivity with age\n(Fessler and Navarrete, 2003a); however, our study involved only reproductive-age\nwomen. In a very large sample spanning a wide age range, Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie\n(2004) showed declines in disgust sensitivity with age; however, their study\nemployed stimuli not directly related to death. As the literature thus does not\nilluminate the relationship between age and disgust sensitivity in the death domain,\nwe sought to address this issue via three avenues. First, we reanalyzed data\npreviously collected in two Internet-based surveys that employed the Disgust Scale\n(Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994), the instrument created by the Rozin School, the\nprincipal advocates of the Terror Management account of death disgust. Second, we\nconducted a new Internet-based survey using the Disgust Scale. Lastly, because\nattitudes toward death vary across cultures, in order to ensure that any patterns found\nwere not the unique product of U.S. culture, we orally administered a translated\nversion of the Disgust Scale in rural Costa Rica, a cultural environment in which\nindividuals have greater familiarity with death, and in which death fears are more\nboldly confronted, than is generally true in the U.S.\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nStudy 1 \u00ad Reanalysis of prior Internet-based administrations of the Disgust Scale\nMethod\nIn order to shed light on the relationship between age and death disgust, we\nrevisited data collected previously in the course of two Internet studies conducted for\nother purposes. The first study, described to participants as `Surveys on Diet,\nDisgust, and Motion Sickness,' consisted of a dietary inventory on the first web page,\nfollowed by the Disgust Scale on a second page, followed in turn by a questionnaire\non susceptibility to motion sickness (see Fessler, Arguello, Mekdara, and Macias,\n2003 for details). In the second study, titled `Body Awareness and the Self,' the\ninitial web page asked participants to rate how disgusting they found the prospect of\ntransplantation of each of twenty different body tissues; the Disgust Scale was then\npresented on a separate page (see Fessler and Haley, in press, Study 3, for details). In\nboth studies, participants were recruited through postings to clearinghouse web sites\n(e.g., Psychological Research on the Net, SocialPsychology.org) and listservs (e.g.,\nPsych-L, Anthro-L). Participation was anonymous, and no compensation was\noffered.\nResults and Discussion\nWe pooled data from the two studies, limiting the analysis to adults who\ncompleted every item on each questionnaire and eliminating multiple entries from the\nsame IP address. This produced a combined sample of 921 individuals (635 women\nsensitivity, we examined responses to death-related questions on the Disgust Scale,\nincluding both true/false questions (e.g., \"It would bother me to sleep in a nice hotel\nroom if I knew that a man had died of a heart attack in that room the night before,\"\netc.) and scalar `how disgusting' questions (e.g., \"You accidentally touch the ashes of\na person who has been cremated,\" etc.) (see Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994). In a\nmultiple regression analysis in which the independent variables were age, sex, and a\ndummy variable controlling for mean differences between the two samples,2 we\nfound a significant main effect for age in which increasing age predicted lower\ndisgust sensitivity to death stimuli. As will be discussed later, a sizeable body of work\ndemonstrates that, in many domains, women are generally more disgust sensitive than\nmen. Consistent with this literature, we also found a main effect for sex, as, on\naverage, men showed significantly less disgust sensitivity toward death stimuli than\ndid women. (see Table 1 full regression statistics).\nWe explored sex-x-age interactions in a second step. However, adding these\ncross-products did not significantly increase the variance explained in the regression,\nand they were therefore removed from the model. This revealed that, although men\nwere less disgust sensitive towards death stimuli than were women, the slopes\npredicting disgust sensitivity as a function of age did not differ between the sexes.\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nTable 1. Study 1. Summary of Multiple Regression Analysis for Variables\nPredicting Death Disgust. Values reflect standardized beta weights. Dataset dummy\nvariable controls for mean differences between datasets.\nVariable  S.E. t Sig.\nStudy 2 \u00ad Internet-based administration of the Disgust Scale alone\nMethod\nBecause the materials analyzed in Study 1 were not originally collected for\nthe purpose of examining age effects on death disgust sensitivity, in both of the\nsurveys, the Disgust Scale was preceded by a questionnaire addressing a different\ntopic; likewise, in both cases, demographic information was collected at the\nbeginning of the survey. These procedures raise the possibility that the pattern\nevident in the results reflects age-dependent priming effects produced by stimuli not\ndirectly pertaining to death disgust. To address this limitation, we conducted an\nadditional Internet survey in which the Disgust Scale was presented in isolation. A\nlink labeled `An Investigation of the Effects of Context on Emotional Reactions,'\nposted on clearinghouse web sites, led to the Disgust Scale, followed by a separate\npage containing questions regarding age, sex, and the setting in which participation\ntook place (the latter information was collected for reasons not relevant to the present\ndiscussion).\nResults\nEmploying the same criteria for inclusion as those used in Study 1 produced a\n11.7). In a multiple regression analysis in which the independent variables were age,\nsex and their interactions, we found significant main effects for age and sex.\nConfirming previous results, death disgust sensitivity declined significantly with age,\nand men were less disgust sensitive than women (Table 2). A second step in which\ninteraction terms were added once again revealed that, although men had a lower\nmean level of death disgust sensitivity than did women, the slopes predicting disgust\nsensitivity as a function of age did not differ between the sexes.\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nTable 2. Study 2: Summary of Multiple Regression Analysis for Variables Predicting\nDeath Disgust. Values reflect standardized beta-weights.\nVariable  S.E. t Sig.\nStudy 3 \u00ad In-person oral administration of the Disgust Scale in rural Costa Rica\nParticipants for Studies 1 and 2 were recruited using web sites and listservs\nthat are directed primarily at an English-speaking North American audience. It is\ntherefore likely that many participants in Studies 1 and 2 either primarily identified\nwith U.S. culture, or else were intimately familiar with it. Adherence to a cultural\nworldview plays a central role in TMT (Greenberg, Solomon, and Pyszczynski,\n1997). Because attitudes toward death vary substantially across cultures (Counts and\nCounts, 1991), we therefore felt it important to demonstrate that the effects of age on\ndeath disgust sensitivity documented in Studies 1 and 2 are not unique to those who\nare well-versed in North American culture.\nRural Costa Rica differs along many important dimensions from the dominant\nculture of the U.S. (Hofstede, 1991), and numerous traditions, practices and beliefs\nremain relatively unadulterated by North American influences (Biesanz , Biesanz,\nand Biesanz, 1999). As in other agricultural areas in the Developing World, people in\nrural Costa Rica are frequently exposed to the death of animals, as animals are killed\nfor food, pests and predators are exterminated, and farm animals die of injuries or\nage. In addition to the general exposure to the cycle of life and death typical of rural\ndwellers, Latin Americans are noteworthy for the degree to which they appear to have\nnormalized death. Many Hispanic authors have noted that mortality concerns are\nexpressed openly in Latin American cultures, rather than repressed as they often are\nin the U.S. (e.g. Delibes, 1966; Fierro, 1980). Likewise, death themes have been\nstaples of Hispanic written and oral traditions for centuries, and may have pre-\nColumbian roots in both the Spanish and the Mayan and Aztec traditions (Siefken,\n1993). Consistent with these generalizations, practices in rural Costa Rica reflect an\neasy familiarity with death. Dying relatives usually pass away in the home, not in\nhospitals, and surviving family members are present at the moment of death. In the\nimmediate aftermath, family members often remain in close proximity to the\ndeceased, sometimes embracing and kissing the corpse. More generally, people\nfrequently visit relatives' graves and memorials, and picnics at a loved one's tomb are\ncommon, particularly during religious holidays; food is sometimes left at the grave\nfor the deceased to consume. Correspondingly, with regard to overarching attitudes\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\ntoward death and dying, rural Costa Ricans are more open about their anxieties, more\nfamiliar with the death process, and much more fatalistic in their attitude toward\ndeath than is typical in the U.S. (Biesanz , Biesanz, and Biesanz, 1999; Navarrete,\n2004). Hence, because of the many relevant contrasts with contemporary U.S.\nculture, rural Costa Rica constitutes a promising setting in which to evaluate the\ndegree of universality of patterns of emotional reactions to reminders of death.\nIn addition to examining the effects of age on death disgust in rural Costa\nRica, we also used this opportunity to test a related prediction promulgated by\nproponents of a Terror Management approach to disgust. Goldenberg, Pyszczynski,\nGreenberg, and Solomon (2000) and Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,\nKluck, and Cornwell (2001) argue that, because disgust defends against fitness-\nreducing existential anxiety, reminders of death should intensify the disgust reaction\nto stimuli, such as the body and its by-products, which remind people that they are\nanimals, and hence are mortal. Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,\nKluck, and Cornwell (2001, Study 1) tested this hypothesis in a North American\nuniversity sample by administering the Disgust Scale following contemplation of\none's own death; results revealed that, relative to a control condition, mortality\nsalience increased scores on the body products and animal disgust sensitivity\nsubscales. The authors interpret this finding as supporting the Rozin School's notion\nthat disgust responses serve as a symbolic, distal defense against death by\ndifferentiating humans from animals.\nIn previous research, we found that, contrary to the core predictions of TMT,\nreminders of death failed to increase worldview defense among Costa Rican\nparticipants (Navarrete, 2004; Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and Kirkpatrick, 2004).\nWe hypothesized that these null effects were due to cultural differences, as overt\ndeath fears may not be particularly salient to individuals in societies such as Costa\nRica in which beliefs, practices, and fatalistic attitudes make exposure to death\nthemes less problematic than is true for people living in societies that emphasize\nsecular life and control over one's own destiny. Rural Costa Rica was thus a useful\nlocation for a test of the TMT claim that, due to evolved panhuman features of mind,\nmortality salience should enhance disgust sensitivity toward the corporeal aspects of\nhuman animality.\nMethod\nStudy participants were 82 Costa Rican citizens (29 men and 53 women)\nliving in the community of Cariari, in the Lim\u00f3n Province of the Republic of Costa\nRica--a region with a primarily agricultural economy in which bananas are the\nprincipal export. Participants were recruited door-to-door in their homes to participate\nin a survey on personality and social attitudes, and ranged in age from 16 to 73 (Mean\nwith the modal education level at the completion of primary school (6 years).\nBecause rural Costa Ricans have little or no familiarity with written surveys,\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nwe employed an in-person structured interview format. With the aid of literate local\nassistants, the second author translated the Disgust Scale into colloquial Costa Rican\nSpanish. The resulting translation was then inspected by two faculty members at the\nD'Amore Language School in Quepos, Costa Rica, who edited the translation for\nclarity. Finally, the edited version was presented to local assistants, who substituted\nfamiliar colloquial terms for any formal phrases. The survey was then administered\nby a male research assistant who was na\u00efve to the hypotheses being tested.\nParticipants were given a mortality salience prime, the Positive And Negative\nAffect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, and Tellegen, 1988), the Disgust Scale,\nand an assay of several demographic items. The mortality salience prime, similar to\nthat used in typical TMT research, asked participants to describe the feelings that the\nthought of their own death aroused in them, and to describe what happens when one\nphysically dies. Participants in the treatment condition were given the mortality\nsalience prime before the administration of the Disgust Scale, while participants in\nthe control condition were given the prime after the Disgust Scale. Following Terror\nManagement protocols (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and Breus, 1994),\nthe PANAS was administered as a delay and distraction before administration of the\nDisgust Scale.\nResults and Discussion\nIn evaluating the effects of age and sex on death disgust sensitivity, we\nconducted a regression analysis similar to those described above. A dummy variable\ncoded for whether participants were exposed to the mortality salience prime before or\nafter administration of the Disgust Scale.\nAnalysis revealed a main effect for age, a marginally significant effect for\nsex, and no effect for mortality salience on death disgust sensitivity (see Table 3).\nInteraction terms were not significant and were removed from the model. As in our\nInternet studies, death disgust decreased as a function of age, and men showed less\ndeath disgust than did women. Mortality salience failed to produce a significant\nchange in disgust sensitivity toward death stimuli.\nTable 3. Rural Costa Rica: Summary of Multiple Regression Analysis for Variables\nPredicting Death Disgust. Values reflect standardized beta-weights.\nVariable  S.E. t Sig.\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nIn assessing the TMT prediction that reminders of death should intensify the\ndisgust reaction to animality and by-products of the body, we conducted a\nmultivariate regression in which the animal and body products subscales of the\nDisgust Scale were the two dependent variables; mortality salience, sex, and age were\nthe predictors. The analysis revealed no effect for mortality salience on either\nsubscale, no age effects, and a main effect for sex, with men being less disgust\nsensitive toward animal and body-function disgust stimuli than women (see Table 4).\nContrary to the predictions, and previous findings, of TMT researchers working in the\nU.S., in Costa Rica reminders of death failed to intensify the disgust reaction to those\ndomains which blur the human\u00adanimal boundary.\nTable 4. Rural Costa Rica: Summary of Multivariate Regression Analysis for\nVariables Predicting Animal and Body-Function Disgust. Values reflect standardized\nbeta-weights\nVariable  S.E. t Sig.\nLimitations\nAlthough the Disgust Scale incompletely predicts performance on behavioral\nmeasures of disgust sensitivity (Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore,\n1999), given that the instrument was created for this purpose by the Rozin School,\nthis limitation does not reduce the challenge that our findings pose to the latter's\nexplanation of death disgust. Nevertheless, additional studies using other means of\nmeasuring death disgust sensitivity are necessary before definitive conclusions can be\nreached regarding the effects of age on death disgust. Given our cross-sectional\ndesign, it is possible that the patterns we report are due to cohort effects rather than\nage-related changes in disgust sensitivity. However, we know of no evidence\nsuggesting that death disgust sensitivity has increased among younger adults in recent\nyears, and, given the increasingly realistic and graphic portrayals of death popular in\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nentertainment consumed by Western young people, it is more likely that, at least in\nour Internet samples, the opposite is true.\nSeveral readers of a draft of this paper suggested that the age-related increases\nin death disgust predicted by Terror Management approaches to this emotion might\nbe masked by overarching psychological changes such as the reduction in negative\nemotional reactivity with age (cf. Mather et al., 2004). We acknowledge that our\nmethods do not allow us to rule out this possibility. Nevertheless, if, as Terror\nManagement Theory claims, existential anxiety is truly fitness-reducing, and if, as\nasserted by the Rozin School and other proponents of TMT, death disgust is an\nimportant means of combating such paralytic anxiety, then one might reasonably\nexpect that natural selection would have found a way to maximize, rather than\nconstrain, individuals' emotion-mediated abilities to combat increasing paralysis as\nthe end of life looms closer with the passage of time. By way of comparison,\nconsider the threat posed by dangerous animals, a factor that has plausibly constituted\na significant source of selective pressure over the course of human evolution. Fear of\ndangerous animals leads individuals to avoid activities that place them at risk of\nattack, and hence, within limits, such fear is fitness-enhancing today, and would have\nbeen in the ancestral past as well. Due to age-related changes in physical robusticity,\nolder individuals are generally less able to fend off dangerous animals than are\nyounger adults. Consistent with this pattern, older adults report greater fear of large\ncarnivores (Roskaft, Bjerke, Kaltenborn, Linnell, and Andersen, 2003) and dogs\n(Boyd et al., 2004) than do younger adults. This suggests that, when the fitness costs\nare both real and evolutionarily recurrent, emotional responses vary in an adaptive\nfashion as a function of age despite the influence of overarching age-related changes\nin negative emotional reactivity.\nGeneral discussion\nA straightforward reading of Terror Management Theory suggests that\ndefenses against existential anxiety should progressively increase as the inevitability\nof senescence, and hence death, becomes increasingly evident. The Rozin School and\nallied TMT researchers assert that disgust reactions to death are part of such defenses,\ngenerating the prediction that death disgust should increase with age. Here, using the\nmeasure of disgust sensitivity devised by the Rozin School, we have shown that,\ncontrary to this prediction, disgust sensitivity in the death domain declines with age.\nRecently, some proponents of TMT have argued that what they term `successful\naging' involves abandoning those defenses against death anxiety thought to be\ncharacteristic of younger adults, replacing them instead with coping mechanisms\ncentering on what is described as `self-transcendence' (McCoy, Pyszczynski,\nSolomon, and Greenberg, 2000). This revised formulation of TMT fares no better in\nour tests. If disgust reactions to death and reminders of death are a defense against\nexistential anxiety characteristic of one stage of life, and if defenses of this type are\nlater replaced by self-transcendence, then the relationship between age and death\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\ndisgust should shift sometime in old age. Younger individuals should exhibit a\npositive correlation between death disgust and age since, being still reliant on defense\nmechanisms involving denial and avoidance, with each passing year they should\nwork harder to distance themselves from their approaching deaths. In contrast, older\nindividuals should exhibit a negative correlation between death disgust and age since,\nthe greater their age, the longer the opportunity they have had to work toward self-\ntranscendence, and hence the less they should need to deny their mortality through\ndisgust reactions to death. In each of our studies we found a significant main effect\nfor age, indicating that the relationship between death disgust and age does not\nexhibit the inverted U-shaped function predicted by this version of TMT.\nIn addition to demonstrating that TMT is unable to predict the relationship\nbetween age and death disgust, our Costa Rican study reveals that, contrary to the\npredictions of Terror Management theorists, in at least one population, mortality\nsalience induction does not enhance disgust responses to reminders of animality.\nAlthough Terror Management Theory explicitly purports to provide an\nevolutionary account of human responses to death (Solomon, Greenberg, Schimel,\nArndt, and Pyszczynski, 2004), viewed from the perspective of contemporary\nevolutionary psychology, TMT is premised on a number of questionable assumptions,\nincluding the view that anxiety is fitness-reducing, and the claim that all animals\nKirkpatrick, 2004). Elsewhere (Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and Kirkpatrick, 2004)\nwe have provided evidence that the experimental prime, mortality salience induction,\nemployed in much TMT research lacks the uniqueness ascribed to it by TMT\nadvocates. Together with the results presented above, these observations lead us to\nconclude that Terror Management Theory does not provide a solid foundation on\nwhich to construct theories of disgust.\nAlthough Paul Rozin was one of the earliest proponents of a neo-Darwinian\napproach to behavior (cf. 1976), while noting the evolutionary origins of disgust as a\nmotivator of behavioral prophylaxis, the Rozin School has nevertheless emphasized\nfeatures of disgust, such as elicitation by culturally-defined morally objectionable\nbehaviors, that deviate from this function (Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, and Imada, 1997;\nRozin, Lowery, Imada, and Haidt, 1999). In contrast, following suggestions by Nesse\nswing the pendulum back toward a more comprehensive evolutionary account of\ndisgust, documenting that, across disparate cultures, this emotion is elicited by\nstimuli, such as feces, vomit, and spoiled food, that constitute avenues for pathogen\nKurzban and Leary, 2001). Consistent with this view, Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie\n(2004) recently showed that disgust elicitation is influenced by cues (wound type,\ncolor of liquids, etc.) that are discretely associated with sources of disease. In\nprevious work, members of our research group have argued that a) the salience of\nThe Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives\nanimals and animal parts as disgust elicitors reflects the hazards of pathogen\ntransmission that such objects posed in ancestral environments (Fessler and\nNavarrete, 2003b); and b) the relative salience of various parts of the human body in\ndisgust events is a function of both their vulnerability to biological contamination and\ntheir role in producing contaminants (Fessler and Haley, in press). Recently, we\ndemonstrated that food disgust sensitivity is elevated during the first trimester of\npregnancy, a period when, due in part to reproductive immunosuppression, the costs\nof food-borne illness are greatly elevated (Fessler, Eng, and Navarrete, 2005). While\nwe acknowledge that disgust experiences are importantly shaped by cultural beliefs,\nwe believe that this growing corpus of evidence indicates that many features of\ndisgust are best explained in terms of the functional importance that avoiding sources\nof biologically relevant contamination held for our ancestors. Given that a) for most\nof human history, death was often caused by disease, and b) pathogens proliferate on\ncorpses and carcasses, it follows that disgust reactions to death are parsimoniously\nexplained as one facet of an emotion that evolved to decrease exposure to fitness-\nDeclines in disgust sensitivity with age may reflect habituation as a result of\nrepeated exposure to death-related stimuli over time. Habituation can be viewed as\npart of the adaptive modulation of responses to indices of potentially harmful\ncircumstances: because caution and avoidance are costly due to the time, energy, and\nmissed opportunities that they entail, it is adaptive to reduce such responses when\nexperience reveals that, in the given environment, the stimuli at issue do not index\nsignificant hazards. Note that the habituation explanation is incompatible with the\nRozin School's claim that death disgust defends against existential terror -- defense\nmechanisms can be likened to mental calluses and, like their physical equivalents,\nthey ought to become increasingly robust, rather than increasingly weak, with\nsuccessive exposure to abrasive features of the environment. Our account of death\ndisgust thus combines an "
