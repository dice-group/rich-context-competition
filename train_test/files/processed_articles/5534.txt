    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn Autobiography of My Mother, Jamaica Kincaid utilizes alternating points of view to portray the novel's overarching\nnarratological, spatio-temporal, and ideological concerns. Kincaid crafts her story's postmodern narrative in interesting ways\nby implementing both first-person-singular and first-person-plural points of view as aging protagonist, Xuela Richardson,\nreviews her life and tells her complicated, coming-of-age tale involving her ongoing struggle against colonial racism and\nthe oppression of women. Often, the narrator speaks alone to explore the quest she is undertaking, a journey in which\nshe receives little help from potential mentors in her colonial island setting, and here Kincaid relies on the singular view.\nAlternately, Kincaid switches to the plural view to portray the possibility for camaraderie that Xuela pursues in alliances\nwith others, namely, women who might serve as potential mother figures but fail. In some instances, the protagonist speaks\ntogether with both family and community members to present their common thoughts regarding their shared sense of\nsubjugation in Dominica's island setting, yet these acts of co-narration do not bring her the solace she seeks. As the narrator\ncontemplates her identity, one affected by her mother's death, her father's abandonment of her, her rejection by her\nstepmother and stepsister, and her dismissal by teachers and classmates, Xuela attempts to tell her story both alone and with\nothers. Finally, however, Xuela discovers that any capacity for self-knowledge lies beyond her in an alienating world, and she\nremains displaced within Dominica's culture.\n",

I had never heard of it, I had\nnot been expecting it, I was twelve years old, but its appearance,\nto my young mind, to my body and soul, had the force of a\ndestiny foretold.\nSome indigenous peoples have viewed menses as a holy time\nin which women remain alone for spiritual reasons, including\nthe receiving of visions, and in Jamaica Kincaid's (1996) The\nAutobiography of My Mother, the narrator does experience an\nepiphany concerning her future. Nevertheless, in an interview\nabout the novel, Kincaid said that, culturally, a woman's men-\nses represents a \"shame[ful]\" event (Garner, 1996, p. 7). In\nmany tribes, a woman's cycle signals her temporary exile and\ncategorization as untouchable. In Xuela Richardson's case,\nthe episodes of exile and alienation last longer. In addition, a\nwoman's menses indicates her initiation from childhood\ninto womanhood, with its rigid existence: marrying, having\nchildren, and attending to household duties. In Autobiography,\nwhen the narrator receives her menses, she represents a\n15-year-old, first-person narrator from Dominica, who is liv-\ning in the early 20th century and faced with the aforemen-\ntioned paradigms concerning women's roles. She discusses\nthe changes affecting her, both biologically and categorically,\nbecause of her menses. At one point, evaluating the circum-\nstances of Lise LaBatte, a defeated woman with whom she\nresides, Xuela asks, \"To want desperately to marry men, I\nhave come to see, is not a mistake women make; it is only\nthat, well, what is left for them to do?\" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 64).\nThe image of a woman involved in menses, an occurrence\nsignaling her adulthood, represents one of separateness, and\noften the narrator presents herself as a silent, solitary figure.\n1Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Durant, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTara Hembrough, Department of English, Humanities & Languages,\nSoutheastern Oklahoma State University, Morrison Hall 314,\nEmail: thembrough@se.edu\nIsolation and Inclusion: The Modulation\nof Limited and Plural Points of View in\nJamaica Kincaid's The Autobiography of My\nMother\nTara Hembrough1\n Keywords\nKincaid, autobiography of my mother, narration, women, colonialism\n2 SAGE Open\nXuela finds herself alone for many reasons. Her mother is\ndead, and her father, an inconstant presence, does not care\nabout her. The protagonist's stepmother calls her a thief and\nturns her stepsiblings against her. Moreover, Xuela walks to\nschool with classmates who, mistrustful of one another, are\nnot her friends. She sleeps with a man who does not care for\nher, becomes pregnant by him, and briefly carries a baby for\nhis wife, who has no children of her own but wishes to raise\nthe one she hopes Xuela will provide. As the narrator defines\nherself via the first-person-limited view, she finds herself\nalone in her struggle for an identity unscripted by colonial,\nsocioeconomic, or gendered maxims. Still, Xuela searches for\ninterplay with others. In various instances, she attempts to\nrelieve her isolation by temporarily uniting herself with mul-\ntiple groups--males and females, Africans and Caucasians,\nchildren and adults, family and community members. The\nnovel purports to be the narrator's mother's autobiography\nbut represents Xuela's own halting, fictional account of her-\nself and community and reflects her \"strained, equivocal rela-\ntionship to language and the discursive frames it embodies\"\n(Simon, 2005, p. 31). Kincaid narrates her protagonist's tale\nvia what Kincaid presents as a mixed genre, reinforcing\nXuela's attempt to dispel the confusion and ambivalence she\nexperiences in rendering her identity in narrative form.\nKincaid's narrative technique underscores the narrator's\ndual stratagems for expressing herself as both a private figure\nand group member formulating her subjectivity. Kincaid\nmostly implements the first-person-limited-view to depict the\nprotagonist's remote nature and at other times forays into the\nfirst-person-plural to explore her potential for fellowship. Thus,\nKincaid prevents Xuela's first-person narrative from becoming\ntoo limited by modulating the voice and delving into the first-\nperson-plural, in some instances, to illustrate the protagonist's\neffort to join a collective consciousness. Kincaid's reconfigura-\ntion of the limited view represents an expansion of its tradi-\ntional use. Xuela, narrating her tale mostly alone, refuses to\nsuccumb to colonial stereotypes. Her entrance into woman-\nhood becomes a catalyst to developing a worldview in conflict\nwith the dominant schema. In undertaking a feminine quest,\nXuela describes her birth, her early removal from home, her\nsearch for mentors beyond her home, which exerts a patriarchal\ninfluence on her, instances of disorientation, and interactions\nwith and resistance to her colonial world. Through such mile-\nstones, the protagonist discovers a new awareness, giving her a\nvoice and means to tell her own narrative rather than act as a\nplayer in others' tales. Nevertheless, via Kincaid's point of\nview, Xuela also calls attention to the manner in which spatio-\ntemporal and ideological considerations affect storytelling, the\nnature of which remains problematic for her.1\nLiterature Review of Point-of-View\nConcerns\nVarious theorists from the 20th and 21st centuries have culti-\nvated or expanded point-of-view theories, especially\nconcerning the limited view. To plumb the ramifications of\nthe first-person-limited, which Kincaid foregrounds in her\nnovel, it is helpful to analyze Henry James's theories.\nDisregarding both Romantic and utilitarian compositional\nis to \"attempt to represent life\" (p. 389). Realists represent\nnot only the ordinary and common but also the privately\napprehended and perceived.2 For Realists, writers must gen-\nerate distinctive material utilizing narrators with singular\nvantage points as opposed to revamping old myths involving\ncommunity logic and played out by stock characters.\nThrough the limited view, narrators disclose their motives\nand portray their actions in a manner allowing readers to\ndraw close to them while avoiding the artificiality of an\nintrusive, omniscient narratorial presence. In The Portrait of\nbilities for sight via a limited view by invoking the metaphor\nof a house. This \"house of fiction\" offers countless windows\nfrom which one might peer. Characters gazing at the same\ntree, for instance, will have \"impression[s] distinct from any\nother\" (p. 52). Because one can conceive of multiple out-\ncomes for any experience, Realists viewed perception,\nmorality, and \"truth\" as relativistic and pluralistic, and James\nurged writers to implement a limited view in which narrators\nforegrounded their personal realities.3\nToday, narrative theorists are focusing on the growing\nnumber of perspectives that authors apply to render narra-\ntors' complicated voices, Burkhard Niederhoff (2011, n.p.)\nfinds, including \"intermediate cases, embeddings, transgres-\nsions or unusual combinations\" of points of view.4 More\nrecent theorists have also broadened discussions of perspec-\ntive by foregrounding the first-person-plural view and add-\ning ideological and spatio-temporal concerns to its\nmust account not only for narrators' positions but also for\ntheir mental landscapes and \"privilege\" in accessing story\nargues that narrators' views are linked to their \"psychologi-\ncal idiosyncrasies, attitudes, [and] norms and values\" (p.\n213), as opposed to being confined to a rendering of events,\none supposedly devoid of moralizing, as it is for James\nand \"mirror[s],\" reflecting the story's action without judg-\nLike other contemporary narratologists, Susan Lanser\n(1981) finds point-of-view discussions to be complicated.\nFor Lanser, this is because \"[u]nlike such textual elements as\ncharacter, plot, or imagery, point of view is essentially a rela-\ntionship [between the seer and his or her object] rather than a\nconcrete entity,\" which can be difficult to pinpoint (p. 13).\nFor Lanser, like Booth, a writer's gender, socioeconomic\nstanding, and values play a part in creating a work's perspec-\ntive. Wolf Schmid also recognizes multiple components as\ncomprising point of view. According to Schmid, in each text,\nauthors render relationships among point-of-view aspects\nHembrough 3\ndifferently, making conversations about it nebulous\n(Niederhoff, 2011, n.p.). Thus, newer theorists question the\nold divide between authors and narrators.\nSince the Realists, rifts introduced into the limited view,\nand especially the first-person-limited, allow characters to\nexperience potentially inclusionary instances. In some more\nrecent, postmodern, fictional works, first-person narrators,\ntelling stories, wish to unify themselves with others, despite\nthe impossibility for total, sustained communion, and authors\nswitch between first-person-limited and first-person-plural\nviews. This \"new\" type of narration through the first-person-\nplural, via the pronoun \"we,\" represents a storytelling devel-\nopment, with narrators discovering that they are not the only\nones experiencing social alienation. Post\u00adWorld War I, when\nJames was writing, and Modernism had emerged, many indi-\nviduals felt separated from cultural standards. But by the\n1990s, in a postmodern era, when Kincaid published\nAutobiography, differentiation from communal values repre-\nsented the norm. Most characters, having become outsiders\ntogether, held an almost mythical nostalgia for the past. This\nchange in perspective created perforations through which a\nnarrator could speak with others via the first-personal-plural\nin attempted agreement,5 even though utilization of the first-\nperson-plural has remained sparse, according to Uri Margolin\n(1996), because of issues regarding narratorial authority,\nbecause one character must speak for others and access their\nthoughts.\nThe Novel's First-Person-Limited Point\nof View\nIn Autobiography, Kincaid uses the first-person-limited to\nilluminate the narrator's solitude, a condition that, tradition-\nally, might have allowed her to reflect upon her circum-\nstances as the text's main feature. James recommends using\nthe first-person-limited to portray narrators' sense of isola-\ntion, and in Autobiography, Kincaid implements the first-\nperson-limited to prompt Xuela to contemplate her own\nfractured identity based on age, gender, race, and socioeco-\nnomic factors. All first-person narrators are what Booth calls\n\"unreliable,\" because they cannot see beyond themselves to\nrender a so-called objective view of a situation as an omni-\nscient or otherwise removed narrator might do (1983, n.p.).\nNonetheless, Xuela is further distinguished as being \"unreli-\nable\" because, in some instances, such as at the novel's\nbeginning, she narrates from a child's point of view, while,\nlater, as an adult narrator, she is separated from her earlier\nself due to her increasing knowledge.\nBound by colonial confines, Xuela is involved in a \"psy-\nchological\" quest (Caton, 1996, p. 1) to discover her identity.\nKincaid writes about young protagonists exhibiting cogni-\ntive awareness (Timothy, 1990) as they begin to understand\ntheir sexuality (Kenney, 1985) and familial ties (Niesen de\nAbruna, 1995). These women \"gain self-awareness and a\ncritical understanding of their social and cultural context\nthrough many contradictory relationships with the mother\nand the Mother Country: ones of love, rejection, education,\nloss, and emulation and disobedience\" (Hughes, 1999, p.\n14). In Autobiography, Kincaid mostly elects to utilize the\nlimited view to depict such struggles as part of the narrator's\nown silent, incomplete, or painful communications with\nmother figures, family and community members, and herself\nas she ages.\nBecause of spatio-temporal restrictions placed on narrat-\ning one's yesteryear, Xuela, fitting Booth's guidelines for the\nunreliable narrator, does not recall prior events in the same\nmanner each time. She likens the experience of evaluating\nher memories to standing atop a hole and looking down at a\ndollhouse, where, depending on how the light hits, the\nscene's aspects change. The first-person-limited supposedly\nallows readers to understand at least one main character inti-\nmately in a way that omniscient, removed narrators might\nnot. However, Kincaid demonstrates that, oftentimes, a first-\nperson narrator's skills of critical analysis fall short: In\nAutobiography, the protagonist is unable to explain herself\ncategorically, fragmenting any summation of her persona. In\neither speaking as a child and offering a so-called authentic-\nity and simplicity in her storytelling, or communicating as an\nadult with insight and purpose, Xuela cannot provide readers\nwith any life picture, despite Kincaid's reliance on the lim-\nited view, which Realists believed suitable for this purpose.\nAs a further impediment to readers' analysis of Xuela's\ncharacter, as well as to her own self-understanding, the pro-\ntagonist speaks little with others, even though she can some-\ntimes intuit their thoughts and vice versa. The book contains\nno dialogue and, thus, no means by which readers might hear\nand see Xuela's interactions. Instead, foregrounding a first-\nperson-limited view, Kincaid filters the narrative through the\nprotagonist's head to render the novel interior in nature.\nAlthough Xuela often refuses to talk with others, this does\nnot mean that she does not have a story to tell involving\nhappy moments and times of emotional deprivation. Early\non, she states,\nI spoke to myself because I grew to like the sound of my own\nvoice . . . I was lonely and wished to see people in whose faces I\ncould recognize something of myself. Because who was I? My\nmother was dead; I had not seen my father in a long time.\nBeginning as a child, the narrator speaks to herself to for-\nmulate her history, even if it is a mythical one, as are all his-\ntories, and even if she is unreliable in Booth's terms, as are\nall storytellers, Kincaid implies. Nevertheless, the protago-\nnist is denied a positive self-concept because her supposed\nmother, Xuela Claudette, is dead, her father, Alfred, is apa-\nthetic toward her, and her stepfamily disdains her. Moreover,\nthe protagonist boasts a mixed ethnicity, being half Carib\nand, thus, marginalized in a colonial setting.\n4 SAGE Open\nXuela attempts to comprehend her \"own subjectivity and\ncapacity for agency\" by telling her tale in a manner that cen-\nAutobiography represents a \"biomythography\" or \"a reenvi-\nsioning of a life experience which reveals multi-layered his-\ntories and collective memory\" (p. 130). The narrator relies\non history and memory to assemble the tersely rendered sto-\nries that Alfred may have told her, colonial accounts of the\nisland's people she learns at school, religion-based rhetoric\nand folklore, and family and community members' tales to\nconstruct her and her community's experiences. Still, these\nartifacts fail to provide Xuela with any holistic, meaningful\naccount. In addition, because Kincaid relies on the first-per-\nson-limited, any information that the narrator amasses as a\nperipheral and, thus, unreliable figure, in Booth's terms, is\ninfluenced by her liminal location.\nIn narrating Autobiography, the protagonist's concern is\nunderstanding her mother's life and Xuela's place in it. Still,\nKincaid selects a first-person-limited view that positions\nXuela as the only character to ruminate on the woman's past,\neven though Kincaid might have offered other characters'\naccounts of the mother to enlarge readers' comprehension.\nKincaid's book is called the narrator's mother's \"autobiogra-\nphy,\" yet, categorically, one must write one's autobiography\noneself. Although Autobiography problematizes genre clas-\nsifications, writing about one's own life does allow Caribbean\nautobiographers to recognize the \"interculturative processes\"\naffecting their views of their culture, race, and gender\n(Paquet, 2002, p. 4), and Sandra Paquet's claim regarding the\nbenefits of composing an autobiography for Caribbean writ-\ners might be extended to apply to autobiographers-as-narra-\ntors, such as Xuela, too. As the girl narrates her mother's\nso-called autobiography, she discusses the forces at play,\nincluding colonialism, gender, and socioeconomic station,\ninvolved in constructing her own identity, even if, in post-\nmodern terms, Kincaid's narrator questions her ability to\nknow or say anything.\nIn the novel, Xuela, narrating with an outsider's voice,\nadopts a stance toward her audience that lends itself tradition-\nally to the limited view. She muses on her mother's identity,\nwhich the narrator constructs surreptitiously, and discusses it\nonly via the first-person-limited view, because other charac-\nters do not share or will not admit to having experienced a\nsimilar grief to hers concerning a parent's loss. In reconstruct-\ning her mother's past, Xuela wishes to be cognizant of her\nlineage, yet she finds this outcome foreclosed. Her mother\ndies when Xuela is born supposedly, and so she never knows\nher, and \"this loss represents a legacy of loss: in infancy her\nmother was abandoned and left at the gates of a convent, and\nher father was abandoned in his youth by his father\" (West,\n2003, p. 6). Just as Xuela's own parents, orphaned or left\nbehind, must have created visions of their predecessors, she\ninvents her mother and father. Autobiography represents an\nexample of how Kincaid's \"fiction circles round and round\nthe troubled concept of motherhood, constantly replaying a\nsituation of loss, longing, lack, and unanswerable desire\"\nperson-limited in instances in which the narrator discusses\nher mother, Xuela asks herself the same questions concerning\nher mother's identity and offers herself the identical answers,\ngenerating little feedback about her background, except from\nwithin her own psyche.6\nSometime after her mother's death, the protagonist goes\nto live with Alfred's laundress, Ma Eunice, who also fails to\nfill Xuela's mother's place. Oftentimes, African American\nwriters create mother figures \"prominently featured in com-\nrepresents one such example, as a mother figure without the\ncapacity to love Xuela or any of her children. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous\n(1976, n.p.) describes the presentient communication that a\nmother and her baby engage in as ecriture feminine, and in\nmany societies, the female is linked with language because\nwomen, spending time with children during their formative\nyears, teach them to speak. Nevertheless, one cannot locate\nthe paradigm of the instructive, nurturing mother figure in\nAutobiography:\n[T]he image of the beatific mother encouraging her children to\nspeak historically did not apply to women of African descent in\nthe Caribbean. The dominant colonial class portrayed enslaved\nwomen as actively lascivious temptresses, fickle wives, and\napathetic mothers. These women could not reign in a domestic\nhaven because they were compelled to work for their masters\nfrom sunrise to far past sundown. If their children were not sold\nto another plantation, they were typically cared for by others.\nEunice, presumably a descendent of African slaves, contin-\nues her foremothers' and their masters' patterns by engaging\nin domestic labor, including washing others' laundry, for lit-\ntle recompense. She considers child-rearing and washing\nlaundry to be domestic labor tasks of an equal nature. Once\nEunice feeds and clothes the narrator, Eunice seems to\nbelieve that she has met her responsibilities.\nIn Xuela's early life, Eunice represents a central figure,\nbut due to the distant, apathetic relationship they share,\nKincaid never implements the first-person-plural view to\nally them in thought or speech, just as the protagonist can\nnever co-narrate with her mother. Indeed, Xuela does not talk\nto anyone until she is 4 years old and then only to ask for\nAlfred, a request showing that she only attempts to commu-\nnicate with those who might love her. Even when the conse-\nquences are severe, such as when Eunice punishes the\nnarrator for refusing to apologize for breaking Eunice's plate,\nXuela remains silent, barring a verbal dialogue between\nfemale characters. Later, when Eunice takes Xuela to school,\nKincaid utilizes first-person-plural narration to represent the\ntwo walking together (Kincaid, 1996). Still, Kincaid does not\ninvoke the first-person-plural to allow the characters to chat\nabout the school. In light of gender and socioeconomic\nnorms, Eunice probably never received an education, and\nHembrough 5\nneither do her children, so there is little common ground for\nthe females to inhabit.\nNonetheless, the education that Xuela receives provides\nher with little benefit, and she does not know why she is\nattending school, only to learn European values rendering\nher a \"subaltern\" in colonial terms. As places linked to her\nracial background, the narrator studies European history\nwithout having been to Europe and gains little information\nabout either her island's history or Africa, \"that place on the\nmap, the one . . . that is a configuration of shapes and shades\nof yellow\" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 50). Xuela is restricted by her\neducation, as opposed to having her life broadened by it.\nIn Autobiography, Kincaid is concerned with the narra-\ntor's search to identify her own purposes, idiom, and world-\nview, while coming to terms with an unresponsive father and\nunknown mother (Garner, 1996). Xuela's mother is missing,\nbut Alfred does not fulfill a guiding role in his daughter's life\neither, even though she assumes his intentions toward her to\nbe compassionate. Because Alfred, \"her only living connec-\ntion to her mother\" (West, 2003, p. 4), allies himself with the\ncolonizer's patriarchal values, Xuela cannot question him\nabout his attitudes, which leaves little room for them to speak\ntogether in any potential implementation of the plural view.\n\"Having no mother and no functional father, Kincaid's enig-\nmatic heroine has no link to the past and no road to the\nfuture\" (p. 4). Unable to formulate cause and effect relation-\nships concerning her existence, the narrator does not grasp\nwhy Alfred leaves her with Eunice.\nLater, when Afred believes that a male classmate has\ninflicted a wound upon his daughter and that she is defending\nthe boy by hiding his name, Alfred sends her to Roseau to\nlive with the family of a business associate, the childless\nLaBattes, and she is barred again from interpreting his pur-\nposes, which remain unspoken but resemble a financial\ntransaction. Prevented from accessing her father's mind-set,\nXuela, narrating via Kincaid's limited view, contends that\nshe has never comprehended what Alfred \"wanted\" from her,\neven though she herself, refusing to explain her injury, also\nprevents conversation (Kincaid, 1996, p. 62). In this instance\nof the novel's concerns regarding characters' refusal to\nspeak, Alfred's countenance represents a \"mask\" that Xuela\nfinds impossible to read (p. 39). She believes that the mask\nthat Alfred wears and the jailer's suit that he dons come to\nrepresent his true self, if such a thing as a \"self\" exists, a\nquestion Kincaid poses. Alfred \"has adopted the colonizer's\ntastes, his language, his religion, and his values\" (Adams,\n2006, p. 8), and the father figure in Kincaid's work \"is a man\noutside the woman's world\" (Dutton, 1989, p. 2), someone\nincomprehensible to the narrator, even as she herself dons\ncostumes to \"become\" a schoolgirl, upper class housewife,\nand day laborer in the novel.\nAlthough Kincaid mostly renders Autobiography via the\nfirst-person-limited, in a few scenes involving father and\ndaughter, Kincaid expands Xuela's purview, and the narra-\ntor uses the pronoun \"we\" to describe their shared actions,\neven if she and Alfred do not co-narrate through the first-\nperson-plural. The first example occurs when Xuela, as a\nyoung child, writes letters to Alfred that she meant for her\nmother but never planned to send, which her teacher mails\nnonetheless. In this scene, the protagonist uses \"we\" to nar-\nrate her and Alfred's journey back to his home and her new\nexistence after he rescues her from Eunice's house and the\nschool. Xuela's reference to her father and herself as \"we,\"\non the journey to his house, implies that momentarily, she\nhopes to connect with Alfred and that, as with Eunice, walk-\ning her to school, the open road represents the only place\nthat this sense of unity may be forged. Pursuing her quest\njourney, the protagonist is not confined in anyone else's\nhouse at the moment, and if this were a typical plot, she\nmight travel forward into a time where traditional roles no\nlonger persist. In Autobiography, however, as with the walk\nXuela and Eunice undertake, Kincaid neglects to move from\nthe first-person-limited to the first-person-plural because in\ntheir colonial setting, the narrator does not perceive her\nfather's abode as hers, and Alfred's breath \"was not the\nOnly once in the novel does Xuela attempt to reach out to\nAlfred by utilizing the pronoun \"we\" in her speech.\nNonetheless, Kincaid retains the limited view here, as the\nnarrator discovers that Alfred's household offers a sense of\nanimosity. Xuela comments on the \"hatred and isolation in\nwhich we all lived\" (p. 50), states of being that cause her to\nwant to leave his residence. Afterward, Alfred sends his\ndaughter to live with the LaBattes so that she can become a\nschoolteacher. As in other instances, the characters do not to\nspeak in common here, blocking any possibility for shared\nverbal discourse. Having developed a sense of \"detachment\"\n(Oczkowicz, 1996, p. 2) from their community and finding\nthemselves located on the periphery, Kincaid's protagonists\noften evaluate other characters' mental states while going\nunnoticed themselves (Simmons, 1998, p. 5), as in these pas-\nsages concerning Xuela's observations about her father.\nIn a later instance of Kincaid's reliance on the limited\nview, Alfred, via a hired man, sends the narrator a letter,\nrequesting her to return home from her construction job,\nwhich she took after leaving the LaBattes, and she rejects the\nformal language and format her father chooses to compose it.\nIn response to Xuela's inclusion of Alfred in a shared world-\nview, he refuses to register the sense of sequestration that she\ndescribes, or else, in the book's postmodern fashion, the\nveneer and the \"real\" have become one and the same for him.\nThroughout the novel, the protagonist has maintained limited\ncontact with her father. Still, she hoped at various points that\nhe would love and reveal himself to her. However, Alfred\ndies as an old man without the duo having connected.\nAlthough Xuela has reached middle age now, she describes\nherself as an orphan. She has lost all opportunities for speak-\ning together with blood family members via Kincaid's plural\nview. Nonetheless, within the novel's course, speaking in\nunison with a favorable outcome was impossible anyway.\n6 SAGE Open\nAlthough Xuela does not experience any belonging with\nher biological family, her connection with her stepfamily is\nworse, and she remains at cross purposes with members. To\nshow her separation, the narrator refers to her father's new\nwife, another of the novel's failed mother figures, as \"the\nwoman who was not . . . [her] mother\" (p. 52). In turn,\nXuela's stepmother claims that the girl represents a thief,\nwho would steal away the stepchildren's \"inheritance\" (p.\n52), although what legacy that signifies is unknown, because\nAlfred demonstrates little affinity for any of the children,\neven his son, who mimics him. The stepmother, who Xuela\nterms, with remove, as her \"father's wife\" (p. 32), hates her\nin a manner incomprehensible to the narrator and tries to kill\nher with a poison-laden necklace. The stepmother, who also\nvalues her son more highly than her blood daughter, ignores\nany supposed bonds between women altogether, seeking to\nend them, even by death, which would block any dialogue\nbetween stepmother and stepdaughter forever.\nAt only two points does Kincaid open the narrative to\ninclude the stepmother's possible point of view in conjunction\nwith Xuela's to allow them to co-narrate, but the result is not\npositive regarding their ability to commiserate. One is when\nthe stepmother, out of duty, teaches Xuela to wash herself, and\nthe girl utilizes the pronoun \"we\" to contend that \"[w]e would\nnever love each other\" (p. 33). By depicting the women's\nshared hatred via the plural view, Kincaid represents them as\ndueling antagonists, as much as victims of their milieu, and\nlimits the amount of sympathy readers might demonstrate for\nXuela as protagonist. She and her stepmother face and often\npromote common strictures regarding their gender, race, and\nsocioeconomic status, which they might discuss otherwise,\nbecause these schemas render them, as women, abject in a\npatriarchal regime. Yet, as Xuela claims generally, \"To people\nlike us, despising anything that was most like ourselves was\nalmost a law of nature\" (p. 52). Such scorn as her community\nmembers identify for themselves takes the force of nature's\nlaw, but their mutually felt emotion is generated by colonial\nattitudes about race, class, and gender.\nDaily, the stepmother, like other characters that fore-\nground their negative interactions, while leaving opportuni-\nties for caring or even ambivalent speech unexplored, tells\nher own daughter that she does not love her. For this reason,\nXuela feels sorry for her stepsister, even if the narrator dubs\nher \"my father's daughter.\" Still, in portraying the stepsis-\nters' relationship, Kincaid rejects the potential of applying a\nplural view to allow them to cospeak about the pain they\nhave experienced through a lack of parenting. In fact, Xuela\nis unable to cospeak in any sustained, mutually beneficial\nway with any female character in Autobiography. Instead,\nnarrating through Kincaid's limited view, the protagonist dif-\nferentiates herself from the girl by commenting on her own\nso-called superior position: Xuela does not have to cope with\nthe same type of betrayal her stepsister faces because the nar-\nrator's mother is dead, a situation preventing any discourse\nbetween mother and daughter, for better or worse.\nIn discussing constructions of perspective, James\nidentify with others that is similar to the one Xuela encoun-\nters with her stepfamily. In James's scenario, the characters\ngaze upon the same scene, just as Kincaid's characters look\nat Dominica's common scenery. James describes cohorts,\nwho together watch \"the same show, but one seeing more\nwhere the other sees less, one seeing black where the other\nsees white, one seeing big where the other sees small\" (p. 7).\nAlthough the watchers study the same scene via the same\nmedium, the panes of glass through which they peer differ\nenough for their interpretations of it to be radically opposed.\nLikewise, in Autobiography, the stepmother, her daughter,\nand Xuela all represent women trapped in a marginalized set-\nting, but they cannot empathize in speech regarding their\nshared plight.\nWhile Kincaid implements the limited view to illustrate\nthe opposition Xuela faces in her relationships with family\nand community members and her ongoing sense of alien-\nation from the world, Kincaid also chooses the limited to\ndepict the isolation that the protagonist intuits is connected to\nher life stages, particularly puberty. Xuela finds it difficult to\ndescribe her \"changing self\" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 58), because,\ntemporally, she cannot apply any understanding she has of\nthe past to present circumstances. The narrator's lack of per-\nceived connection between events places her in a state of\nlimbo--outside childhood's bounds but not inside those of\nadulthood. In the novel's beginning, Xuela neither possesses\nany aspirations, nor is she presented with any real choices\nwhen she arrives at the LaBatte household, where she\nbecomes a concubine, to fulfill the couple's wishes, and\nschoolgirl, to meet her father's desires. In reaction to these\nimposed circumstances, she states, \"I did not object, I could\nnot object, I did not want to object; I did not know how to\nobject openly\" (p. 63). Without options or the possibility of\nmaking decisions, the protagonist, having no voice and no\nchampion, narrates from Kincaid's limited view. Just as\nXuela has obeyed her father, stepmother, and Eunice, the\nnarrator never thinks of refusing Lise anything, even being\ndispatched as a \"gift\" to her husband (p. 68). Still, Xuela\nnever considers herself part of the LaBatte family and, thus,\nincluded in a larger community either. This social rejection\non her part lends itself to Kincaid's imposition of the limited\nview in portraying the narrator's continuing sense of\nestrangement.\nDuring the day, Xuela attends school, where she remains\nquiet because she is female, and at night, she has sexual rela-\ntions with Jacques LaBatte, where she is also silent as he puts\nhis hand over her mouth, and she realizes that her life is in \"a\nstate of upheaval\" (p. 73). However, no one wants to hear the\nprotagonist narrate her story, which is why Kincaid maintains it\nin the limited view here. Xuela has no one in whom to confide\nor to act as a model for her. She must act both as a child and\nwoman, and Kincaid relies on the limited view to depict her as\na character with both public and private personas, guises that\nHembrough 7\nthe protagonist discovers do not coincide with each other.After\nlosing her virginity, she states, \"I was not the same person that\nI had been before\" (p. 71) and expresses a schism in her self-\nconcerned with both her changing physicality and experience.\nThis split makes rendering any \"clear,\" continuous account of\nherself difficult, perhaps enough so to prohibit Xuela from\nentering into conversations with others via a plural view for\ntheir possible affirmation of her figure in these passages.\nAs her adult sensibilities emerge, the protagonist decides,\nwithout informing anyone, that she will not follow Lise's\nplan involving Xuela's having a baby by Jacques. For the\nnarrator, having maintained an interior personality via\nKincaid's mostly limited-view narration, this resolve is sim-\nple. A schoolgirl prevented from having a voice, Xuela keeps\nher opinions to herself, even as her current mother figure,\nLise, expects her to assume a surrogate's role in birthing a\nbaby instead of allowing Xuela to be a child. Kincaid writes\nin a style that is \"spare\" and \"deceptively simple\" (Garner,\n1996, pp. 1-2), and this style seems appropriate, especially in\nscenes in which Kincaid describes Xuela's adolescent state,\nabout which she possesses an imperfect understanding. Via\nKincaid's limited view, the protagonist is occupied in narrat-\ning complicated options for herself, even if her evaluation of\nthem seems opaque in complementing her youthful reason-\ning. It is not until Xuela becomes pregnant, undergoes an\nabortion, and faces the possibility of death that she declares,\n\"I believed then that I would die, and perhaps because I no\nlonger had a future I began to want one very much\" (Kincaid,\n1996, p. 82). Here, Kincaid utilizes the limited view to depict\nthe narrator making resolutions for herself and by herself for\na future in which she remains alone, never locating the com-\nmunity she seeks. Indeed, it is possible that Xuela becomes\nthe mother of a daughter never introduced in the book.\nBecause Kincaid stays in the limited view for the novel's\ngreater part, Xuela's confusion in navigating her experiences\nis heightened. When she first arrives in Roseau, all seems new\nand exciting, yet soon, her feelings of glee wane. The pro-\ntagonist faces a spatio-temporal divide in narrating her life\ncircumstances: She has left behind the familiar map of places,\npeople, and events for shocking ones that leave her some-\ntimes wiser but often numb. Xuela states, \"I long now to feel\nfresh again, to feel I will never die, but that is not possible. I\ncan only long for it; I can never be that way again\" (p. 62).\nBecause of the time and space divide, she finds it difficult to\nnarrate her history, even if she believes it represents one that\nwomen in her community share and, as Kincaid implies,\nshould have a language for disseminating.As Xuela grows, so\ndoes her world outlook. Nonetheless, because of Kincaid's\nlimited view, the narrator keeps her revelations to herself, as\ndo the other voiceless women in their colonial society.\nIn addition to being set apart from those in her culture for\nnumerous reasons, Xuela is also inhibited from claiming a\nvoice and gaining possible self-agency because of her socio-\neconomic status, a factor pushing her toward her society's\nperiphery and making the limited view appropriate for her\nresponse. In Eunice's as well as Alfred's houses, and then in\nthe LaBatte's abode, the girl represents little more than a ser-\nvant and perceives her life as being \"small and limited\" (p.\n59), a situation blocking her ability to narrate greater self-\npossibilities. At the mission school, she has learned that her\ncolonial milieu was constructed based on a \"history of peo-\nples\" with whom she would never interact, namely,\nCaucasians (p. 199), and Xuela's ideological and temporal\nsense of remove from the subjects she has studied impairs\nher potential to narrate from a place in which she might fea-\nture herself in a prominent, valued way within the dominant\nparadigms.\nInterestingly, in an interview, Kincaid revealed that as a\nchild, she was also made aware that she should strive to\nreach her potential, but her teachers and parents utilized\nEnglish standards as success's measurement, and she was not\nEnglish (Pupello, 2012, n.p.). In Autobiography, Dominica's\nEuropean-based ideology influences Xuela to \"feel humili-\nated, humbled, small\" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 59), although it is\nthe people of African descent themselves, including Alfred,\nwho help to reinforce such continuing values and limit the\noptions for narratives that can be spun and spoken together\nvia a plural view.\nFeeling confined by local precedents, as well as by the\nspaces in which she resides, the narrator argues that Roseau\ncannot be \"called\" a true city given to trade and the intermin-\ngling of ideas, a capitol in which \"plots are hatched and the\ndestinies of many are determined\"; instead, it represents an\n\"outpost\" (p. 61). Moreover, the countryside also signifies a\n\"false paradise\" that is \"beautiful, ugly, humble and proud;\nfull of life, full of death\" (p. 32). Describing the locations\nwhere she is given shelter by different families, Xuela feels\nrestricted and shaped by her landscape and the shifting lan-\nguage available to depict it, and throughout the novel, she\nwonders how she can construct an open destiny for herself,\nbecause her locations predetermine it. As with Eunice's bro-\nken plate depicting an English countryside labeled \"heaven,\"\nthe protagonist discovers that there is no utopia to be attained,\nand that any narrative she creates for herself is either limited\nby her gender, socioeconomic status, and race, or is false.\nAt last, when Xuela finds that she has been unable to\nascertain her identity or life purpose, Kincaid implies in the\nnovel that with language's failure to signify, all narratives\nthat the characters render are false, leading to a collapse in\nmeaning for any narrator or narrators speaking from either a\nlimited or plural view. By the end, spatially, attempting to\nnarrate her parents' stories, the protagonist discovers that\nwhat she does not know is like a sea swallowing her (Kincaid,\n1996). Similar to the \"black room\" of history that she per-\nceives as an empty space for those of her culture and race (p.\n3), this sea, no different from her island's mountains and\ncoastlines, represents a desolate, unnavigable landscape\nyielding no knowledge to depict.\nBecause of her early life circumstances, Xuela decides not\nto bear children, another context for which Kincaid might\n8 SAGE Open\nhave implemented a first-person-plural view through which\nthe protagonist could have discussed her and her children's\ncommonalities, because she \"understands that she will never\npossess the self-knowledge, connectedness, or inheritances\nthat parents impart to their children\" (West, 2003, p. 7).\nXuela, unable to narrate her past, cannot foresee her future,\nespecially one involving children. The loss of her mother \"has\nparalyzed Xuela with the notion that if she should have a\nBesides Lise, no one in the novel demonstrates a definite love\nfor Xuela, one she believes she must experience to return.\nIn literature representingAfricanAmerican and Caribbean\nwomen, the mother usually holds the place \"of the matri-\narch--a nurturing, long suffering caregiver for whom sacri-\nfice is second nature and without whom the child's identity\nformation is either traumatized or unforgivably altered\"\ning no mother figure assuming a nurturer's role, remains\ntraumatized. The narrator's rejection \"of motherhood is ulti-\nmately a refusal of meaning, specifically a refusal of meta-\npossible in postmodern terms, Xuela defines her own land-\nscape through Kincaid's limited view to prevent others from\nimposing the identity of motherhood upon her, even if she\nremains haunted by it.\nAfter committing an abortion and deciding not to become\na mother, the acceptable role for a person of her gender, race,\nand status, Xuela retreats to live alone in a hut. There, she\ncontinues to tell her tale while totally removed from others.\nSpeaking from this minimalized location, the narrator\nexpounds on why she does not want to be a mother, school-\ngirl, mistress, or housemaid. She does not want to suffer\nsilently the fate of women, such as her old friend, who walks\nby silently without speaking and has aged dramatically. The\nlinking of the \"postcolonial with woman . . . almost inevita-\nbly leads to the simplicities that underlie unthinking celebra-\ntions of oppression, elevating the racially female voice into a\nout the novel, Xuela problematizes the metaphor of the cel-\nebrated mother by depicting how women's available roles\nlead to their demoralization.\nAbiding in the hut, the girl positions herself as an exile\nand outcast by rejecting women's venues, either saintly or\nevil as constructed in colonial terms, and taking on the\nappearance and labor of a man by purchasing a dead man's\nclothes, cutting her hair, and working on a construction site.\nStill, living alone as if in a tomb and digging and filling the\nsame holes at the site, she identifies herself as \"not a man,\nAlthough Xuela, earning an income for the first time,\nexpresses a sense of independence as a wage earner, she\nfinds that the day laborer's existence is not any superior to\nprior positions she has held. Rejecting roles associated with\nher race for both genders, the protagonist becomes a zombie,\nnot dead but not alive to any purpose either, certainly not one\nof bringing a baby into the world, which someone must\nmother and teach to narrate its own tale.\nAs a result of Xuela's campaign for independence, or per-\nhaps because all people are alone in postmodern terms, as\nKincaid implies, the girl forms no close relationships, a con-\ntext leading Kincaid to remain mostly in the limited view for\nthe novel's course. Later in life, Xuela marries Philip, a\nCaucasian doctor resembling her father, a conqueror impos-\ning his mark on the landscape, but, as Kincaid suggests, as\nmuch a pawn of his environment as anyone else. Despite the\nnarrator's marriage, a sacred bond fusing two people, she\nexperiences no unity with either Caucasians or males, just as\nshe has been unable to find female companionship. Once,\nXuela and Philip may cospeak via the first-person-plural\nview, or she may be speaking for both of them simply, when,\nmarrying, they explain that \"we were very serious\" about\ntheir vows, and that their \"union was so palpable, so certain,\nwe could almost feel it with our hands\" (p. 214). Still, despite\nthe moments in which they share an allied front on their wed-\nding day, Xuela remains separated emotionally from her hus-\nband until his death (as well as afterward).\nMeanwhile, the narrator does not form any relationships\nwith those of aboriginal descent either, because the Caribs,\nher mother's people with whom she would have liked to have\nassociated, or so she thinks, have been decimated. The pro-\ntagonist identifies her lover, Roland, a poor stevedore, as the\nonly person about whom she has ever cared but finds that her\nliaison with him is fleeting, too. Xuela implements the pro-\nnoun \"we\" to describe a time with Roland in which \"we were\nhappy\" (p. 166), but readers do not learn much about the\ncouple's hopes, probably because the two possess no future\nto co-narrate, as he is married. Although engaged in a quest,\nshe \"find[s] no community to provide her a meaningful sense\nof place and self--the self she ultimately constructs is\ndefined by loss and isolation\" (West, 2003, p. 3). Kincaid\nrelies on the limited view to render Xuela a solitary being,\ndiscovering that she cannot identify with family members,\nwomen, or even potential children. Interactions with men\nand romantic partners of both African and Caucasian descent\nfail to provide camaraderie, too.\nThe Novel's First-Person-Plural Point\nof View\nConsidering her protagonists, Kincaid deemed Xuela \"more\ngodlike\" than other heroes she constructed previously\non the first-person-limited to render the novel in Xuela's\nvoice, language, and ideological framework seems fitting.\nNevertheless, in various sustained instances, Kincaid keeps\nAutobiography from becoming too narrow by interjecting\nthe first-person-plural as Xuela co-narrates with others,\nnamely, children and women, sharing her context, even if\nthey do not forge a collective consciousness. Kincaid's use of\nthe plural view allows the narrator to reach out to others and\nHembrough 9\nattempt to include them in her speech acts, even if these acts\ndo not provide her with the community she requires.\nIn the first example of Kincaid's application of the first-\nperson-plural, as a child, Xuela is united in sentiment and\npurpose with her classmates as they walk to school during\nthe time before Alfred sends her to Roseau. The students'\nrelationship is not characterized by friendship, however, but\nby mistrust and fear. Feeling part of a larger whole represent-\ning the island's native inhabitants, but barred from exploring\nany commonalities, the girl states of the group, \"We were\nnever to trust one another . . . [even though] these people\nwere ourselves, . . . [who] shared a common history of suffer-\ning and humiliation and enslavement and genocide\" (Kincaid,\nleast partially of African descent, and many of their ancestors\nwere enslaved, killed, or otherwise exterminated, the class-\nmates believe that they do not possess any bond. Their par-\nents, who do not speak in common in the novel either,\nreinforce this sentiment of mutual mistrust by telling them\nnot to befriend one another.\nIn discussing Xuela's and her classmates' experiences\nwith their teacher, an African woman, who despises her own\nracial and cultural heritage and teaches students to do the\nsame, Kincaid once again implements the plural view to por-\ntray the students' collective assessment of the woman, one\nbased similarly on a mistrust of someone of their race and\nstanding. Nevertheless, in this passage, Kincaid also includes\nthe teacher's voice within the first-person-plural viewpoint\nto reveal that the teacher and students hold reciprocating\nbeliefs concerning their relationship's nature. Full of self-\nloathing for her background, the teacher, according to the\ngirl, \"did not love us; we [Xuela and the students] did not\nlove her; we [the teacher, Xuela, and the students] did not\nlove one another\" (p. 15).\nThe teacher and children are united in disregard for one\nanother, yet their strategy for shared representation separates\nthem and prevents constructive dialogue. Although Xuela's\n\"story is intensely private, avoiding mention of the island's\npolitical affairs in favor of her thoughts and relationships, it\nis imbrued with the history of colonialism and slavery\"\n(Schultheis, 2001, n.p.), and in this scene, the \"facts\" of their\ncollective history, which the narrator and her community\navoid discussing, continue to affect the students' relation-\nships with one another and their teacher. Despite Kincaid's\nplural view, no one talks openly and jointly about the island's\nhistory, a situation reinforcing a pattern of the inhabitants'\noppression through their inexpression of themselves.\nWithin this same time frame, Kincaid utilizes the first-\nperson-plural to depict Xuela and the children united again in\ncommunicating a tale involving an apparition representing a\nnude, dark-skinned female, who, singing, draws one boy to\nswim to her in the river and drown. The children's story, told\nby numerous witnesses among them, including the narrator,\nto both group members and their parents, is rejected by the\nadults, who consider their offspring untrustworthy and abject\nbecause of their sharing of mythical tales, with elements fea-\ntured in native culture. Later, the children, excepting Xuela,\ndismiss the narrative, too, having absorbed the doubt that\ntheir parents exhibit for stories refuting European values and\n\"truths.\" Concerning the children's failure to speak and be\nheard, despite their having presented a shared outlook via the\nfirst-person-plural view, she states,\nEverything about us is held in doubt and we the defeated define\nall that is unreal, all that is not human, all that is without love, all\nthat is without mercy. Our experience cannot be interpreted by\nHaving had their claims denied by their parents, who pro-\nhibit the children, including Xuela, from relating the drown-\ning episode again, the children fail to identify and, thus,\ncomprehend the horror they have witnessed in their friend's\ndisappearance, and all but the narrator discredit the event, a\nresult rupturing their collective account. \"Caribbean people,\nwhose lived experience is framed by African-derived ways\nof seeing the world, often will disavow their own praxis to\nAutobiography, Kincaid demonstrates how, through the van-\nishing boy's example, in the future, the children's stories\nmay continue to separate them instead of unit them, despite\nKincaid's plural view here. By blocking speech concerning a\nmissing community member, the townspeople prohibit his\nstory's sharing and, thus, its remembrance.\nWhile Kincaid implements the first-person-plural so that\nXuela may attempt to speak with her schoolmates by using a\nset of shared colonial values, Kincaid also applies the plural\nview in passages involving women, who, like the children,\nsuffer a similar social subjection in the book. The greatest\nexample occurs when the protagonist is sharing her days\nwith Lise, with whom Xuela communicates silently, and who\nshe understands in a way that she never does with anyone\nagain. One day, Lise, imparting her life story, teaches the girl\nto make coffee for Jacques, with whom Xuela is having sex-\nual relations, and the narrator states,\nWhen we were alone we spoke to each other in French patois,\nthe language of the captive, the illegitimate; we never spoke of\nwhat we were doing and we never spoke for long; we spoke of\nthe things in front of us and then we were silent. (Kincaid, 1996,\nLise and Xuela speak alone but together in this passage,\nwhere their words are not captured, and they talk not of\nlarger socioeconomic circumstances, identities, or ideolo-\ngies, as women who could assist each other might, but of\ncasual topics, perhaps ones not worth exploring to their colo-\nnial society at all and, thus, not included in the narrative.\nAlthough the protagonist and Lise never openly discuss the\nsituation involving their sharing of a man, this passage repre-\nsents an instance in which the women, having a common rep-\nresentation in their milieu as captives and illegitimate people,\nexchange ideas, however slight, as Kincaid foregrounds their\nexpressions via a plural view.\nLater, Xuela and Lise also communicate nonverbally, and\nKincaid implements the plural view again to depict this\nexchange, one that their society might not have thought wor-\nthy for them to render verbally either. The girl and Lise ana-\nlyze each other as friends, contenders, and mother and\ndaughter, silently, stating, \"We sat on two chairs, not facing\neach other, speaking without words, exchanging thoughts\" (p.\n75).Although the novel's focus remains on Xuela throughout,\nboth women take the spotlight in these instances of shared\nconversation narrated through Kincaid's plural view.\nA third time in which Kincaid implements the plural view\nis to include not only the narrator and Lise but also Jacques in\nthe narration's collective rendering. Here, all three are\ninvolved in a love triangle about which none speaks verbally\nto the group. Underlying tension is created when Xuela\nexplains that Lise listens to the girl and Jacques having sex\nbut never mentions the encounters, and neither does anyone\nelse. With feigned ignorance and even joyful acceptance of\ntheir shared position, Xuela states that, in this scene, they all\nknow that the rain is falling outside the house, but that \"we\nnever heard it\" (p. 76). In this passage, narrated via Kincaid's\nplural view, the characters signal that no collective communi-\ncation concerning their liaisons occurs, not even in a manner\nallowing the mention of something as trivial as the weather.\nBy refusing to speak and skirting chance meetings in the\nsame room, the housemates avoid a direct confrontation con-\ncerning their tryst, one that might compel them to communi-\ncate about their state of affairs verbally. Xuela reveals, \"We\nwere never the three of us together; she saw him in one room,\nI saw him in another\" (p. 77). Here, Kincaid begins with the\nplural view and returns to the limited one, with the protago-\nnist noting the characters' location, not their thoughts about\nsuch placements. The trio forgoes the possibility for explor-\ning everyone's desire via a shared point of view, an outcome\npreferable for all interests here, at least at the outset, Kincaid\nimplies. Although Xuela participates in shared speech with\nthe LaBattes in this scene, they never concern themselves\nwith her motives or fate.\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. states that Kincaid writes about a\n\"self-contained world\" (New York State Writer's Institute,\n1999, p. 1), and her implementation of a limited view in the\nnovel, with some scenes punctured by instances of the first-\nperson-plural, invokes characters' sense of sequestration.\nWhen Xuela returns to the LaBattes'house after aborting her\nchild, she finds the couple on the steps, and Kincaid main-\ntains the first-person limited as the protagonist describes the\nevent, because the trio's members hold no shared feelings to\nco-narrate. Xuela can comment only on everyone's close\nproximity in location by stating, \"We stood, the three of us,\nin a little triangle, a trinity, not made in heaven, not made in\nretains the limited view as the narrator describes the charac-\nters' placement in the island's setting, where they are united\nin a religious-like context but find no words to depict their\nformation's relevance. The trinity's members fail to speak\ntogether again before Xuela leaves the LaBattes' house once\nand for all, where she has experienced her final instance of\nparticipating in the sharing of women's speech via Kincaid's\nplural view.\ning windows \"of dissimilar shape and size, [that] hang so, all\ntogether, over the human scene\" (p. 7). These windows\nshould allow for more similarity in viewpoint, yet they are\n\"mere holes in a dead wall\" (p. 7), not shared markers.\nLikewise, even as Kincaid broadens point-of-view concep-\ntions through communities of \"we\" comprised mostly of\nchildren and women in the novel, this plurality only reveals\nmembers' collective distrust and indicates the type of con-\nstraints colonialism has placed on the narrator's possible\nfuture encounters with others. Xuela, walking with her\nschoolmates and talking to Lise, discards her sense of soli-\ntariness via Kincaid's limited impositions of the plural view,\nbut only for a shared locus of fear and disappointment, a con-\ntext rendering Xuela's sense of alienation, as well as that of\nher fellow citizens, only greater.\nThis is Autobiography's theme: Once one's identity has\nbeen fractured, stolen, or altered, one's stories become incoher-\nent, implausible, and meaningless, too. The narrator's mother\nrepresents the island's original, mythic culture, which has been\ndismantled and denied. Meanwhile, Alfred, with his Scottish\nAfrican background, assumes the colonizer's stance toward his\nfellow natives but can offer no positive replacement for a cul-\nture that has been eradicated either.7 Narrating alone or with\nothers, Xuela attempts to understand her story and locate an\nempathetic or at least concerned listener, but when she either\nreveals her thoughts or shares the ideas and actions of others,\nsuch attempts to widen the narrative on her part to create mean-\ning only portray how narrow the characters' sense of them-\nselves and their dimensions, limited by a colonial setting, are.\nConclusion\nAutobiography is a Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age story,\nbut Xuela is hampered in her quest's progress by the genre's\ntraditional framework because she possesses few role mod-\nels for growth and rejects, as a source of enlightenment, edu-\ncation's place, which focuses either on the colonizers and\ntheir imposition of Christianity, or island folklore, which fea-\ntures stories about nymphs that no one registers. Abandoning\nmentors and epistemological frameworks, the narrator cre-\nates her own book of values to conduct her life. She \"repre-\nsents the existential protagonist who seats herself at the\ncenter of her world, constructing codes of ethics and moral-\nity that originate in her own self-conceived and self-validated\nparadigms\" (West, 2003, p. 8). Often, Caribbean women are\nportrayed as storytellers or lascivious mulattos, \"living on\nthe edges of urban communities belonging to no settled cul-\nnovel, Xuela adopts the storyteller's role to confront her cir-\ncumstances and question those who have stolen, distorted, or\ndestroyed the island's culture. Autobiography explores the\n\"structures of domination, racism, sexism, and class exploi-\ntation\" and shows the manner in which they \"make it practi-\ncally impossible for black women to survive if they do not\nas storytelling.\nAs yet another role, Caribbean women can adopt mother-\nhood \"as the antidote to paternal power\" (Schultheis, 2001,\nn.p.). Still, this function, in many cases, \"limits female sexu-\nality and identity to procreation, thereby reinscribing the met-\naphor of the family\" (n.p.) and is a paradigm Xuela rejects.\nThe appearance of her menses provides her not only with the\nability to bear children but also with the will to give her life\nmeaning or mother herself. Repulsed by her island's colonial\nstandards and the oppression she has endured at family and\ncommunity members' hands, as defining act, Xuela commits\nan abortion after leaving the LaBattes to reject another's life\nand provide her own with opportunities, whatever those\nmight be. She states, \"I had never had a mother, I had just\nrecently refused to become one, and I knew then that this\nAs readers interrogate Xuela's subjectivity, they may\nexpect that the tension between her sense of solitariness,\ndepicted by a limited view, and her struggle to empathize\nwith others, portrayed by the plural view, will result in the\nnovel's climax as she determines her position. In the end, the\nnarrator discovers that she must speak alone, because every-\none with whom she has attempted to forge relationships is\ndead or forever unavailable. The novel's dramatizes Xuela's\nhope for communication and realization that she does not\nhave a worldview of interest or access to anyone in her\nimpaired community.\nHowever, at a few points, Kincaid, enlarging Xuela's bound-\naries, transcends both the limited and plural views as the nar-\nrator addresses readers directly, as when she states, having\nperformed her first abortion, \"I knew things that you could\nonly know if you had been through what I had just been\nthrough. I carried my life in my own hands\" (p. 83).Although\nXuela wants someone with whom to share her story, the tale\nfinally becomes one about readers' perception of the story's\nsubject itself. In Autobiography, Kincaid relies on a limited-\nview narration because the protagonist must undertake to\nunderstand and perceive herself. Xuela finds that her life is\n\"limited\" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 59), as is her ability to narrate\nher story, even with others' assistance via the plural view.\nYet, the protagonist considers that history has made her peo-\nple \"silent\" (p. 62), and to remain quiet represents a \"self-\npunishment\" (p. 60) that she cannot endure.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. Scholars have examined The Autobiography through gen-\nder-based, colonial, politico-economical, epistemological,\nidiom-related, and narratological lenses. Within the latter\ntwo categories, R\u00e9jouis (2003) describes Xuela's alterna-\ntions between French and Creole depending on her agenda,\nSimon (2005) explores Kincaid's characters' ambiguous\nrelationship to language, Adams (2006) discusses how\nKincaid uses allegory and \"self-writing\" as \"counter dis-\ncourses\" to colonial texts, and Schultheis (2001) investi-\ngates how Xuela appropriates multiple voices in the novel\nas Kincaid disrupts traditional autobiographical forms.\nHowever, no one has investigated fully the novel's point-\nof-view considerations.\n2. In deciding what to foreground, James warns fellow writers,\n\"Do not think too much about optimism and pessimism; try\nand catch the colour of life itself\" (p. 413). Interest for read-\ners lies in unique characters with matchless vantage points.\nIndeed, \"[h]umanity is immense, and reality has a myriad of\n3. For Norman Friedman (1955), narrators represent a \"fixed\ncenter\" (p. 108) from which all information is filtered, as if\nthrough a camera lens, a context that Realists believed was\nauthentic to life. Friedman was writing when Realism repre-\nsented the standard literary style, and the communal or omni-\nscient voice was implemented infrequently.
