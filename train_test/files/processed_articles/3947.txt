    "abstract": "Abstract\nThrough our case study of a Brazilian not-for-profit focused on sustainability initiatives, we expand knowledge about\ncommunicative labor in different Brazilian organizational environments, especially in the third (nonprofit/nongovernmental)\nsector. Based on a case study for which thematic analyses of in-depth interviews with the entire nongovernmental organization\n(NGO), including its board and staff, were conducted, we found three communicative labor processes that displayed how\nmembers entered into, thought about, performed, embodied, and sustained interaction in ways that are considered to\nbe a hallmark of the particular Brazilian third-sector organization that we studied. The three processes of communicative\nlabor--depicting NGO work as meaningful labor, producing commonality and difference, and transcending contradictions--\nenabled NGO members to withstand difficulties and engage productively in the tensions of doing communicative labor in\nBrazilian environmental work. Despite the volatile political-economic and diverse cultural environment in Brazil, the NGO's\ncommunication enabled them to adapt to and proactively shape environmental efforts, thus modeling sustainability and\nresilience.\n",

With pub-\nlicity and events surrounding the 2016 Olympics, reports cel-\nebrated the human and bio-diversity in Brazil but also\ndisplayed the poverty, political instabilities, and crime in\nBrazil, as well as consequences of the Brazilian Zika virus\n(Cugola et al., 2016). With such broad and deep opportuni-\nties and needs in Brazil, NGOs feel pressures from diverse\nsectors and challenges inherent in the meanings and conduct\nof sustainability work itself.\nSpecifically, Brazilian NGO and global professionals\nengaging in sustainability efforts, find that they must manage\ntensions in their political positions, social practices, and\ndaily activities (F\u00e1tima do Carmo Guerra, dos Santos de\n& Buzzanell, 2017). These tensions are symbolic as they\nenact work that they perceive to be meaningful but frustrat-\ning, and material as they seek impact through short-term\ndeliverables but struggle with long-term solutions within\ncomplex interdependent human and material systems (F\u00e1tima\nTensions also emerge in their internal and external ethical\nresponsibilities, including their communicative labor.\ncommunicative labor refers to processes of mutuality,\nauthenticity, and affect through which people share experi-\nences.

As noted earlier, Brazil has a\ncritical role in the global ecological system. Its political-eco-\nnomic-cultural complexities and paradoxes provide a forum\nto study communicative labor aligned with Putnam's (2012;\nmunication scholarship that promotes an internationalization\nagenda and attends to organization-society problematics. As\nPutnam and Mumby (2014) noted, organizational communi-\ncation scholars \"examine the relationships between organi-\nzations and their broader societal structures by exploring\nsuch issues as social justice, corporate social responsibility,\nsocial movements, and corporate identity in a globalized\nworld\" (p. 11). Central questions have to do with identities,\nresponsibilities, and democratic organizing processes. We\nattend to the ways that members of a Brazilian environmen-\ntal agency perceive the meanings and meaningfulness of\ntheir work and the tensions that they experience in doing\ncommunicative labor that enables sustainability.\nTo pursue our goals, we begin by providing an overview\nof communicative labor and tensional approaches to lay the\ngroundwork for our case study about a NGO in Brazil dedi-\ncated to environmental sustainability efforts. We detail our\ninterview and document data and thematic analysis proce-\ndures and then discuss three processes of communicative\nlabor--depicting NGO work as meaningful labor, producing\ncommonality and difference, and transcending contradic-\ntions--that enable NGO members to perform their work\ndespite disruptions and obstacles and to model strategic\ninteraction processes. We close with our theoretical and\npragmatic contributions and their implications for communi-\ncative labor, sustainability discourses and materialities, and\ncommunity resilience.\nLiterature Review\nIn this section, we frame communicative labor from a ten-\nsional theoretical approach and then we discuss Brazilian\nenvironmental NGOs, focusing on one NGO in particular.\nFirst, communicative labor encourages action \"in the name\nof doing good\" (Dempsey, 2007). In NGOs, communicative\nlabor can involve generation of locale-specific, paradoxical,\nand neocapitalistic appeals (e.g., Stahelin, Accioly, &\nlabor is materialist and communicative insofar as labor gener-\nates value through its embodiment of creativity and coopera-\ntion (Greene, 2004). Analyses of communicative labor offer\ninsight into the ways in which doing work can both perpetu-\nate and lessen inequalities through adherence to \"parameters\nset by others\" and disregard of the \"wicked problems\" cen-\ntered in ethical-capitalistic paradoxes (Alvesson & Willmott,\nTaking a tension-centered approach enables a focus on\nprocess, specifically the ongoing sense making and ethical\ndecision making that enable people to embody values and\nideological beliefs more or less into everyday action (e.g.,\nD'Enbeau & Buzzanell, 2011). This approach foregrounds\nthe ironies and complexities at discursive and material inter-\nsections while noting that contexts, identity negotiations,\nand knowledge shift. It means that organization members\nare constantly in the process of organizing thus enabling\nchanges when proposed interventions do not seem to be pro-\nductive. As such, a tensional approach destabilizes realities.\nIt encourages communicative labor, enacts resistance and\ncomplicity, fosters and closes options, and recognizes that\norganizing can only be constituted through navigation of\ndiscursive-material tensions (Putnam & Boys, 2006;\nTrethewey & Ashcraft, 2004). For Mitra and Buzzanell's\n(2017) examination of sustainability work, a tension-cen-\ntered approach to sustainability professionals' efforts and\ncareers illuminates the nuances, complexities, and contesta-\ntions in meaningful work.\nSpecifically, Mitra and Buzzanell (2017) found that the\nsustainability professionals (n = 45, from seven different\ncountries) whom they interviewed found their work to be\nmeaningful through the ways in which they could enlighten\nbusinesses, engage in direct interactions with stakeholders,\nand negotiate political cultures. They reported feeling not\nonly compelled and gratified to engage in this labor but also\nchallenged emotionally, intellectually, and physically.\nChallenges and opportunities arose from lack of resources,\nefforts to frame their efforts in ways that produce desired\nresults or, at least, open stakeholder interactions to further\nconversation. They constantly navigated the need to produce\ndeliverables with the complexities of long-term solutions\n(see also D'Enbeau & Buzzanell, 2011). Finally, they drew\nmeaningfulness from the internal and external sources of\nwork valuation, as well as their commitments and abilities to\nMarchiori and Buzzanell 3\nwork somewhat autonomously (admitting that their autono-\nmies could also be isolating and detracting). As Dempsey\nbridge overarching ideological and practical tensions through\ncommunicative labor. This communicative labor frames the\nefficacy of action. It also redefines and revalues aspects and\nnegotiates inclusion in ongoing discursive-material work--\nprocesses that contribute to and detract from perceived\nmeanings and meaningfulness of work and the very ways in\nwhich sustainability is accomplished.\nTo contribute to greater understandings of communicative\nlabor in international organizational communication arenas,\nwe examine internal NGO discourses and their consequences\nthrough an empirical study of Brazilian third-sector organiz-\ning, specifically of an environmental sustainability group,\nlocated in Londrina, within the state of Paran\u00e1. In Brazil,\nNGOs (or ONGs, the Brazilian acronym for NGOs) have sig-\nnificantly increased in number with estimates reaching\nfoundations and associations supporting environmental activ-\nities, particularly environmental education (Instituto\nBrasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica e Instituto de Pesquisa\nStill, there is no definitive study on the actual number of\nNGOs in the country (Campagnac, 2006; Conselho\nEmpresarial Brasileiro para o desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel,\n2010). Moreover, environmental management, interest in\nindigenous knowledge and material utilization, and educa-\ntional initiatives to teach the general population about envi-\nronmental issues in Brazil have increased considerably in\nrecent years (Stahelin et al., 2015). These initiatives question\npolicy, program, and practice contradictions, adversarial\nstakeholder and class relations, and long-term impacts on the\nenvironment itself as well as understandings of human-envi-\nronmental connections (Stahelin et al., 2015). In Brazil,\nefforts have triggered governmental programs, bringing\ntogether public and private organizational partnerships and\nsituating responsibilities through policies and constitutional\nmandates, particularly individual responsibilities for environ-\nmental impacts and governmental responsibilities for educa-\ntion, with NGOs pivotal in these processes (Trist\u00e3o & Trist\u00e3o,\n2016). Within this contentious context with adversarial pub-\nlic-private sector and regional stakeholder interests, NGO\nmembers need to construct communication processes that not\nonly enable them to accomplish their goals efficiently and\neffectively but also work with the contradictions they face in\nprocess, output, and advocacy (for such paradoxes, see\nMethod\nWe analyze data gathered by a Brazilian research group sup-\nported by The National Council for Scientific and\nTechnological Development (CNPq), of which the first\nauthor was a member. Based primarily on thematic analyses\nof deep interviews with members of the entire NGO, or man-\naging Board of MAE (which included staff as well as the\npresident and professionals) and of NGO documents and\nobservations of interactions before, during, and after the all-\norganization weekly meetings, we discuss how participants\nengage in efforts to discursively construct a distinctive orga-\nnizational identity that promotes particular ideological and\npragmatic commitments in environmental sustainability and\nin participatory organizing. In doing so, we acknowledge\nthat participants may have overemphasized the productive\nnature of their reported interactions, perhaps because of their\n(stated) commitments/calling to NGO environmental sus-\ntainability work or perhaps because of their desire to tell a\nseamless story that shifts attention from the contradictory\norigins and toward institutionalization of third-sector inter-\nests in Brazil (Peruzzo, 2009). Even so, how such processes\nare embedded in organizing is significant since Brazilian\norganizations have only recently begun shifting from exter-\nnal organizational foci toward recognizing the value of inter-\npretive approaches (Putnam & Casali, 2009; Management\nCommunication Quarterly Brazil Forum, 2009). Moreover,\norganizations and environmental policy decision makers\ntypically do not utilize scientific reports, which make per-\nsonal connection, translation of expert opinion, and abilities\nto speak to and across professional and cultural languages or\nexpertise of various stakeholders particularly daunting in\nBrazil (Carneiro & da-Silva-Rosa, 2011). Communicative\nlabor to (re)create images of commitment, multidisciplinary\ncollaboration, and united communicative efforts within the\nNGO and to external publics is essential as this particular\nNGO is viewed as a model for participatory action in\nBrazilian society. Even so, the volatile sociopolitical and\neconomic context that is Brazil threatens environmental pro-\ntections (Tollefson, 2016). As such, the case parallels\nBrazilian national movements away from political dictator-\nship and censorship and toward concerns with democratiza-\ntion, voice, citizen's rights, empowerment, education, and\ntransparency with real material consequences for everyday\nalso provides insight into how diverse stakeholders and\nexperts engage with the ongoing contestation in Brazilian\nCase Study\nIn our case study, we utilized the processes of communica-\ntive labor to extend tensional approaches about NGO action\nand institutionalization in Brazil and offer pragmatic or utili-\ntarian value (Yin, 2003). In drawing out our case, we discuss\nour participants, procedures, and context.\nWe conducted in depth, face-to-face interviews with the\nentire managing board of the organization as well as other\nmembers including one paid staff member, totaling 14\n4 SAGE Open\npeople. There were nine men (64%), and five women (36%)\nranging in age from the late 20s through 50s. All participants\nwere Brazilians and had a history of dedication to environ-\nmental causes. They came to their volunteer work through\ndifferent backgrounds, characterizing themselves as journal-\nists, lawyers, biologists, geologists, social scientists, admin-\nistrators, and secretaries. We do not identify their quotes by\ngender or by organizational role and expertise. We do not do\nso for two reasons: (a) because of the ease with which indi-\nviduals could be identified and (b) because members engaged\nin consistent communicative labor to depict their environ-\nmental work and interactions as strategically designed to\nuphold collaboration and portray a united front on behalf of\nenvironmental sustainability . This consistency (in perceived\npractices aligned with communicative labor and environ-\nmental sustainability work tensions) enabled the authors to\nreport theoretical saturation.\nOur interviews ranged from 1 to 2 hours each and cen-\ntered on focal questions about interactions, communication,\nand day-to-day practices, such as \"how do you do your work\nhere at MAE?\" We used a flexible semistructured approach\nguided by very few primary questions and dependent on\nprobes that emerged from interviewees' comments, as well\nas our observations and document analyses (Patton, 2002).\nInterviews were conducted in Portuguese and English,\ndepending on the MAE member's preferences. During trans-\nlations by the first author, both authors examined linguistic\nchoices and context together to determine appropriate\nEnglish phrasing and meaning. All interviews were recorded\nand transcribed. Transcripts were verified for accuracy\nagainst the original recordings.\nIn addition to interviews, we also reviewed documents and\nwebsites. We engaged in observations, particularly of team\ndecision-making meetings that took place every Tuesday dur-\ning the data collection period. During these times, we\nobserved interactions during meetings and different work-\nplace encounters that occurred before and after meetings.\nDuring these meetings, members often discussed activities\nand recounted everyday decision making that occurred with\nall members regardless of position and stated expertise. For\ninstance, we heard accounts of and observed times when\ninterns (students) would make suggestions or provide input\nthat then would be validated by the group as useful. We\nobserved instances when members disagreed about strategies,\nthe value of certain information, and the utility and planning\nof upcoming environmental events. These observations and\ndocument analyses were used to corroborate findings and\ncheck for contradictions between what was said and what\nmembers did in their communicative labor.\nThrough inductive thematic analyses, general to more\nspecific categories centering on our areas of interest were\ndeveloped (Patton, 2002). We worked independently then\ncollectively to discuss and refine the themes or semantic pat-\nterns, relying on criteria of recurrence, repetition, and force-\nfulness (Owen, 1984). These criteria encourage attention to\nexact and similar linguistic choices, phrasing, and argument\nstructures that are used by participants as well as emphases\nand other nonverbal aspects of their expressions. Through\nexamination of their semantic patterns and language, we\ncould gauge what in their perceived communicative labor\nwas important to them as individuals and were reportedly\nstructured within their organizational culture.\nIn our data analyses processes, we utilized our strengths\nas a bilingual Brazilian scholar who guided the research team\nbut was not a member of the NGO and as an organizational\ncommunication researcher independent of the data gathering\nprocesses but expert in areas of case interest. Before writing\nthis article, the first author presented findings to the organi-\nzation not only for their use in strategic planning and reflec-\ntion about their everyday practices but also as a member\ncheck for the validity of our results.\nBecause context is important in case studies not simply as\nbackground but more so as a driving force for communica-\ntive labor, we briefly describe the NGO MAE in Brazil that\nfocuses its efforts on sustainability, preservation, and conti-\nnuity of social, economic, cultural, and environmental assets\nfrom various levels of current society. The World Business\nCouncil for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) categorizes\nsustainability as progress that meets current needs without\ncompromising future capabilities. However, sustainability\ndoes not focus only on resource allocation and opportunities\nover time but also on egalitarian distribution between current\nand future generations (Milne, Kearins, & Walton, 2011).\nCorrespondingly, MAE is intensely active in the environ-\nmental scene of the Brazilian city of Londrina, in the south-\nern state of Parana, since it was founded in 2001 by volunteers\nand interns at the Londrina Environmental Public Ministry.\nAccording to its president (biologist Eduardo Panach\u00e3o),\nMAE came about as a response to a disaster that had signifi-\ncant environmental impacts in a northern region of the city.\nAt that time, volunteers were investigating large oil spills in\nrivers in a suburb of Londrina called Ribeir\u00e3o Lind\u00f3ia, where\nwarehouses stored fuel.1 The initial worries facing the found-\ners centered on the lack of any legal framework for environ-\nmental issues in the city at the time. Instead, environmental\nissues fell under the jurisdiction of the Public Ministry. A\nlack of whistleblowers and little concern on the part of the\nlocal populace spurred some individuals to establish MAE.\nAt that time, the clash between neoliberal ideologies, envi-\nronmental concerns, and sustainable community develop-\nment came to the forefront. Using the contradictory spaces\nopened by these different discourses and stakeholder inter-\nests, the MAE sought to provide unified but strategically\nambiguous framings of events and of their work (see\n1996) to achieve their aims of safeguarding the environment\nand educating the general population, offering leadership\nand expertise in Brazilian environmental issues. Today, MAE\nis credited with environmental quality in Londrina through\npartnerships with Public Ministry of Paran\u00e1 and different\nMarchiori and Buzzanell 5\nrural and environmental entities of Londrina (Radio CBN\nOver time, as Peruzzo (2009) noted, Brazilian NGOs\nshifted tactics to encourage active involvement of citizenry\nand promote a more egalitarian Brazilian society. In its two-\nfold environmental and societal mission, MAE and citizens\nworked on empowerment through discourse, interaction, and\npartnerships (see Peruzzo, 2009). MAE interacts with diverse\nstakeholders involved in environmental issues: government,\ncommunity partners, and private companies. Its history as an\norganization and its history for confrontation, especially in\nthe legal realm, have made MAE a regional and state-level\nclearinghouse and advocate for environmental concerns. As\nsuch, MAE's discourse \"occupies a political space in devel-\noping the collective cultural and societal hegemony\"\n(Peruzzo, p. 665). The communicative labor of invested\nstakeholders involves the ongoing (re)production of ideal-\nized organizing processes that are homogeneous in outward\ndisplay but punctuated by confrontations of interests.\nReported strategic interactions both support the NGO image\nand provide a space for internal struggles about Brazilian\nenvironmental and business sector interests.\nTensional Themes of Communicative\nLabor\nWe argue that MAE engages in communicative labor to cre-\nate images of collaboration and dialogue whereby all mem-\nbers--from the president to secretaries--forego privileging\ndisciplinary expertise and status to work on behalf of the\nenvironment and of modeling participatory organizing. Most\nreport and demonstrate (through our observations and docu-\nments describing meetings and other formalized encounters)\nstrategic interactions aligned with this communicative labor.\nTheir interactions also strategically punctuate points of con-\ntradiction. Thus, as volunteers (and one paid member, a sec-\nretarial staff member), they not only do the work of\nenvironmental sustainability efforts but they also do the\nwork of sustaining and managing tensions productively.\nWe organize our findings to describe how members enter\ninto and discuss interactional processes, and how they engage\nin discursive and material processes that they believe can\nsustain the NGO's work. These findings display members\nengaged in communicative labor (a) depicting NGO work as\nmeaningful labor, (b) producing commonality and differ-\nence, and (c) transcending contradictions.\nCommunicative Labor Depicting NGO Work as\nMeaningful Labor\nAll participants framed their focus on environmental sustain-\nability as meaningful labor, with many saying that such work\nwas a labor of love. In using the phrase labor of love, they\nexplained that they were saying that they would (and did)\nwork without a \"paycheck\" and that the common drive in\n\"making money\" did not characterize their experience.\nIndeed, they were volunteers so their phrasing was not only\nmetaphorical but also literal. They also framed their work as\ninvoking \"caring.\" They did such work because, they said,\nthey believed in its importance. They described their work as\na challenge of great importance with which all could identify\nand celebrate (\"they think it is important\"; \"an achievement\nfor the NGO is an achievement for all of us\"). As one mem-\nber put it,\nIt is important to know that no one is here for a paycheck;\neveryone believes in the cause, they think the same, and they\nwant it to work out right. It is not like a company where the boss\nand the owner want it to work out because they want profits and\nthe rest only do their jobs to guarantee their salary, without\ncaring if they are really doing their best. Here we believe that an\nachievement for the NGO is an achievement for all of us.\nLike Dempsey and Sanders's (2010; see also Dempsey,\nsustainability professionals, MAE members framed their\ninvolvement with work as benefitting a greater good than\nthat afforded by corporate employment. Moreover, the strong\nidentification with \"everyone\" who \"think[s] the same\" and\nrevels in \"achievement[s] for all of us\" offers powerful\nincentives for membership and for engaging in interactions\nthat strategically represent this form of idealized community.\nAs another member stated, \"We are here because we really\nbelieve and not just to get a paycheck at the end of the\nmonth,\" which they believe others do.\nAll of the MAE members expressed similar statements\naffirming strong identification with environmental sustain-\nability causes. They expressed the value of and an availabil-\nity to serve and exchange ideas and opinions with others for\nenvironmental good, a collective pursuit. In this framing of\ntheir work as communally constructed, they perceived inter-\naction as strategic in its function to accomplish goals: \"Our\nfunction as a NGO is primarily to seek interaction between\nall of the elements involved in the areas we work in, which\nare environmental issues.\" They maintained that \"There is no\ncompetition here . . . people interact because they want to;\nbecause they think it is important. Not because we are forced\nto.\" Interaction grew out of the desire to do good work; inter-\naction required that they \"are all open to each other\" and\nfollow \"our ideals.\" This admittedly idealistic depiction\nrequired ongoing communicative effort to uphold. It was\nupheld not only for external stakeholders but also as refer-\nence for the meaningfulness of their work and negotiations\nof everyday interaction.\nBecause of the collective adherence to environmental\nchallenges and opportunities, MAE's organizing processes\nwere not derived from a formal structure, but rather from the\nprocesses that were constantly (re)constructed through each\nperson's contributions and the values to which they have\n6 SAGE Open\nagreed (see value or ideologically focused organizing pro-\ncesses, Buzzanell et al., 1997).2 The communicative labor\ninvolved in this identification work was omnipresent and\nshifted members' perceptions of relationships from work as\nlabor for external gratifications to work as expressed through\nand in friendship and family imagery. As one member put it,\nWe end up confusing the professional relationships, as activists,\nwith friendship. The relationships that we develop here inside\nthe NGO end up being so close that they can't just be limited to\nthe professional arena. It is worth stressing that the NGO is a\nfamily. This comes from the trust that we give to each person. In\nthe moment in which you work with it [trust], you can't then\ndisconnect it.\nSuch strong identification can promote decision prem-\nises that encourage similar sense-making processes and\ncommon solutions among members (Tompkins & Cheney,\n1985) that shape and are being shaped by locales, identities,\nand practices (Kuhn, 2006). Yet, paradoxically, it also can\npromote exclusion of those who might profess lower iden-\ntification or offer non-normative decision premises, a prob-\nlematic issue given great diversity in Brazil. In many ways,\nit seemed possible that their communicative labor regulated\nand constituted member identities in fairly limited ways\n(Alvesson & Willmott, 2002), a sacrifice with which mem-\nbers, by logical extension of their comments, seemed to\nreadily accept.\nCommunicative Labor Producing Commonality\nand Difference\nMembers' reported high levels of identification and com-\nmunicative labor to perpetuate images that all members\nselflessly dedicate themselves to environmental causes and\nparticipatory practices resulted in a paradox of freedom.\nThe assumed and discursively affirmed commonality\namong members about work being a labor of love enabled\nthem to also take initiative, which meant considering an\nindividual to be both active and proactive, in concert with\nand aligned against the collective, conversant with insider\nlanguage and ready to introduce new ideas. In taking initia-\ntive or producing productive difference, the notion of how\ninteraction was accomplished routinely dominated partici-\npants' responses. In speaking about others with MAE as\nwell as himself, this participant suggested the following\nprocess whereby members constituted their community\nthrough interaction:\nI think that the initial interaction is the impulse, that first thing,\nthe catalyst that got them to get up and come get to know the\nNGO. I think that this is the first interaction. When talking about\ninteraction here inside, it is the contact that they make with the\nprofessionals from the diverse areas. They start to understand\nthe language that is spoken here inside and starting from this is\nthe so-called interaction process.\nThe interaction process with its strategic integration of simi-\nlarity and difference centered around work projects, as\nanother participant noted:\nI assumed certain roles without really having had any previous\nexperience with the people with whom I was working here. So,\nI had already taken up some responsibilities, and I had already\nstarted to participate more actively in the organization to an\nextent that, even before I had officially gone to the last board\nmeeting, I had already participated in management meetings\nabout the same things.\nNGO participants perceived their work to be interaction--\nmaking contact with other members, meeting with and learn-\ning from people, taking initiative to grow and sustain\nrelationships with experts, and developing capacities to engage\n2011), even if it meant \"swearing\" at each other:\nHere we have many relationships, inside and outside of work\n. . . The relationships are great; they aren't just something about\nwork, about the routine. This is a good thing because we talk\nabout NGO issues in various places, in various situations;\neverything is connected to what we do here. This helps a lot, to\nhave people know each other, to have more contact, to be able to\ntalk about something later, to call someone, even to swear at\nthem and them at me when we need to, this is really good.\nFreedom, as part of these reported strategic interactions\n(see Deetz, 2010), was considered to be a necessary compo-\nnent for MAE members to drive interaction. Freedom meant\nthat different individuals--experienced in their areas of\nknowledge--perceived boundarylessness in their abilities to\ntake initiative to act and interact in sharing insights and to\nlearn throughout MAE, as well as connection with others and\nenvironmental causes to which they shared dedication. We\nobserved that their connections manifested themselves inter-\nactionally and structurally through active involvement in\nmeetings, questioning of topics under discussion, and dis-\nplaying the continuous interest in and movement toward\nmutually creative decisions (see Deetz, 2010). These interac-\ntions were created throughout the conduct of their work,\nmaking the pattern more identifiable than specific incidents.\nCommunicative Labor Transcending\nContradictions\nOpenness, transparency, and harmony resonated in discourse\nand the interaction practices of MAE members. However,\nthese processes were not without struggle at times, just as har-\nmony does not mean that everyone is happy and gets along\nwell continuously. Instead, these qualities operated as values\nthat underlay everyday interaction and as interaction goals\ntoward which MAE members worked. Although MAE mem-\nbers reported these values and spoke about them in inter-\nviews, we observed the \"swearing\" and grappling with issues\nMarchiori and Buzzanell 7\nthat some might perceive as conflict but that MAE members\nconsidered necessary for dialogue and collaboration to hap-\npen. One professional MAE member perceived that\nManagement meetings are open; they don't have an agenda, so\nthere are various topics. We try to focus the specific research\ngroups, but everyone is free. I think that the freedom and\ninitiative that everyone has, they must have [it] in order to\nmaintain this rhythm; because nothing here is required, these are\nthe differences that let interaction happen with everyone.\nThe communicative labor to produce consistency in strate-\ngic interaction, work toward the common good, and collective\naction meant that discourse, spatio-temporal considerations,\nstructure, and embodied practice had to match. The struggle to\nmaintain interaction as the means of work is evidenced in\nattention to the seemingly smallest details through the over-\narching structure of MAE, according to one member:\nWe avoid changing dates/times, mainly to allow the people who\ngo to the NGO to organize themselves as much as possible, but\nalso to allow other people to also come. . . . There are things that\nwe manage to build internally, from internal interaction, and from\nexternal [interaction], with society, with government. These are\nprocesses that we see as facilitating this type of relationship.\nAnother member commented that MAE strives to create a\nculture and structure that is \"friendly and not so formal, . . . .\nbecause from the moment you bureaucratize the work envi-\nronment a lot, at least here, you end up hindering this interac-\ntion between the people, the members.\"\nAs one member said, \"interaction is what makes things\ndevelop.\" The work required physical presence, putting one-\nself out there to interact with different people in spaces that\nmight not always be personally comfortable but that align\nwith the NGO mission:\nOne of the things that people always stress heavily: Don't just\ncome [to be] in your group. Don't participate just in your group's\nactivities, because in your group everyone speaks the same\nlanguage. Now, as a biologist communicates with a law intern,\nas a law intern talks with a volunteer that has never studied\nanywhere, the message here is: exchange knowledge, get\ntogether. I say physical presence is very important. People need\nto be here with some constancy . . . doing that interaction.\nDespite this fairly consistent depiction of discursive-\nmaterial linkages to the mission and the communicative\nlabor needed to (re)enact and embody messages, members\ndid discuss contradictory opinions about the means, effi-\nciency, and satisfactory fulfillment of goals through commu-\nnication. As displayed in previous interview excerpts, most\nparticipants depicted MAE as intensely participative. They\npointed to communication as the process capable of reaching\nall groups and members; formally observed (by us) through\nchannels such as email and meetings and informally through\nphone calls, casual encounters, dialogues, and conversa-\ntions--often conducted in close proximity. They embodied\nthe environmental work that they promoted in their physical,\nintellectual, emotional, and advocacy labor. MAE members'\nvaried activities. These included: planting seedlings, engag-\ning in public expositions and debates about the environment,\ncreating briefs about and reporting environmental crimes\n(whistleblowing), protecting and supporting urban cityscapes\nand green environmental spaces (such as parks and plazas,\nand other green areas), and driving the kinds of research and\nconservation projects that could move Brazil to the forefront\nof proactive, as well as reactive, environmental work.\nOn a day-to-day basis, among the other services MAE\noffers to the public are books, videos, and references about\nthe environment. They conduct information sessions about\nLondrina and the region, and about area tourist attractions.\nThe MAE offers excursions, walks, hiking, and adventurous\nactivities in the areas under their watch, which function daily\nbetween 9 AM and 12 PM. MAE members are also constant\nparticipants in local, regional, national, and international\nconferences. They produce and disseminate journalistic arti-\ncles, scientific research, and practices that are based on glob-\nally accepted concepts. In short, there are many activities in\nwhich MAE members engage such that they are stretched in\nterms of ability to interact in the ways that they want and to\ndo the work that they find so meaningful.\nAs a result, some participants stated that there were many\nproblems within MAE and these were due to lack of com-\nmunication. These participants perceived the MAE commu-\nnication structure to be inefficient and incapable of reaching\nall organization members--they assessed such processes as\ncompromising productive interaction and stifling the consti-\ntution of different kinds of knowledge and expertise. Thus,\nall MAE participants' statements did not reveal a seamless\nutopian view of the NGO's operations that they labored to\ncommunicate but, rather, depicted MAE as a contested site of\ndiverse meaning-making and information-sharing with dif-\nferent stakeholders internally and externally.\nBecause of these diverse opinions, we questioned whether\nthe formal and informal processes, as well as the organiza-\ntion's overall official message, could be understood and\nagreed upon at all organizational levels and by all stakehold-\ners. Clarity, coherence, and transparency internally and\nexternally have long been considered fundamental for orga-\nnizational success, especially for NGOs, although such char-\nacterizations have been challenged (e.g., Scott, 2013).\nIndeed, a tension-centered approach would indicate that such\ncharacterizations are not the most productive because they\ndo not leave openings for contestations that can lead to\nchange. To ensure that knowledge and recognition of strate-\ngic processes were shared, MAE members described the\nneed for effective and efficient formal communication chan-\nnels and \"formal spaces.\" Formal communication processes\ncould be characterized as inclusionary and proactive but also\nas reactive, occurring as means of insuring satisfaction of\n8 SAGE Open\nday-to-day informational needs to enable overall organizing\nprocesses and organizational accomplishments:\nThere is always someone who doesn't know something, and this\ncould end up hindering them because they could get help, or\ngive an idea. I really want the communication here\u00adthat\ninformation I know could reach everyone\u00adto happen in an\nefficient manner, but even so I think that everyone here is\nintegrated.\nThe NGO MAE members showed consensus concerning\nthe necessity (\"requirement\") of individual initiative to pro-\nvide and seek out expertise, with proactive interactions often\nconstituting informal communication practices. As one mem-\nber asserted,\nIt is more natural, here the individuals are conscious of this, of\nthe importance for us to interact, in order to acquire more\ninformation, change our way of thinking, and growing as both\nprofessionals and human beings. It is not a question of work; it\nis a requirement.\nIndividuals who took advantage of multiple formal and\ninformal communication channels managed to stay informed\nabout diverse questions, or at the very least, those that were\nof interest to their area of expertise:\nInformation is transmitted to all of these groups. And at least if I\ndon't want it and decide to block this access--the negative part\nof my actions--this information still reaches me. Of course\nthere are a lot of emails that circulate here and I can read them\nand discard [irrelevant ones], or an issue can catch my attention\nand I can integrate it, and react to it. But it is very efficient and\nenables people's actions. I can omit it if I desire, but it reaches\nme, even if I am not interested.\nIn short, when informal communication was insufficient\nfor work accomplishment internally and externally, for col-\nlective knowledge generation, and for structure, then formal\nchannels enabled reactive strategic interaction:\nThe idea is to always minimize reactive interaction, leaving this\nonly for bureaucratic issues concerning NGO management and\ncoordination. But when you refer to NGO action management, it\nis always proactive, in that people always have initiative.\nThe communicative labor involves image creation of\nseamless value, interaction, and embodied performance inte-\ngration: \"when we get together, independent of whether it is\na group from a specific area or not, we develop the next steps\ntogether, in alignment with the needs.\" Although not satis-\nfactory to all members at all times and for all considerations,\nMAE's interactional dynamic constituted structure, process,\nand relationship to produce deeply embedded practices\nwhereby members reportedly had access to collective, for-\nmal, and informal meetings and encounters. This communi-\ncative labor to transcend contradiction and communicate\nconstantly was intense and all consuming, as one member\nrecounts:\nConversations are important; they are essential for our work, our\nactions. We are always connected, . . . communication keeps\ncirculating among everyone, from one to another. It is truly a\nprocess. All day long things happen differently . . . you always\nhave to seek out new ways to solve problems, to communicate to\nothers what you want, what you need. People have to understand\nthis, if they don't, they never solve anything, it is impossible.\nThe relentless burden of doing good work, making connec-\ntions, and maintaining relationships is evident in a member's\ncomment that \"If I fail to accomplish my task I will hinder a\nfriend of mine, ... [namely] the NGO president or vice-presi-\ndent, or treasurer, or group director,\" and in another member's\nremark that everything they do in MAE is interconnected:\n\"The people here want to know each other; they want to be\nfriends, because they want the things to go right. They want . .\n. to make things change.\" Without strong identification pro-\ncesses, communicative labor to (re)create love of labor and\nreported strategic interaction for accomplishing environmen-\ntal and participatory goals would not be sustainable:\nIf we didn't have everyone integrated like this, the organization\nwouldn't make it. I think it is a differential, and I think this is\nwhy the NGO is still here after [more than] 10 years, because\neveryone is cooperating and everyone is helping out.\nDiscussion\nOur study provides an empirical foray into analyzing the ten-\nsion-centered communicative labor in a Brazilian NGOfocused\non environmental sustainability. This research extends contem-\nporary Brazilian scholars' work in broadening organizational\ncommunication approaches and redressing previously limiting\nfoci on public relations (Marchiori & Oliveira, 2009).\nSpecifically, communicative labor depicted NGO work as a\nlabor of love, producing commonality and difference, and tran-\nscending contradictions in communication processes and out-\ncomes. These processes were not seamlessly enacted without\ncontestation, ongoing individual and collective efforts, and\nheated emotions. However, these processes facilitated goals to\nwhich all were oriented and wanted to model internally and\nexternally for Brazilian society.As a result MAE members per-\nceived strong desires to report and embody the values guiding\ntheir communicative labor. Although we did not ask MAE\nmembers specifically about the meanings of their work, we\nfound that their identification with environmental and civic\ngoals for their local and national communities provided insight\ninto these areas. They expressed how their communicative\nlabor was consistent with the overarching meaningfulness they\nperceived in environmental sustainability work itself and in the\npressures they experienced when they did not feel as though\nthey were producing such meaningfulness. Attention to these\nindividual meanings and the collective meaningfulness of work\nMarchiori and Buzzanell 9\nas aligned with communicative labor contributes not only to a\ntension-centered approach to organizational and environmental\ncommunication but also to understandings of NGO organizing\nin general.\nWe acknowledge that there are limitations to our study.\nFirst, although we utilized documents and observations for\nour study, we used interviews as our primary data gathering\nmethod. Use of interviews may have limited the conclusions\nwe could draw from our study insofar as participants may\nhave responded in idealistic or utopian ways to our inquiries\n(Alvesson, 2003). During the interviews, we were always\naware of this aspect, but even so, further research could\ninvestigate the differences between what members say and\nwhat they do at the NGO MAE, particularly how members\noperate within, contest, and resist particular organizational\nAnother limitation refers to not gathering data in the com-\nmunities where the NGO is active and not gathering data\nfrom various other external stakeholders. We admit that such\nadditional data gathering would have enriched our findings.\nHowever, our interest centered on how the members of the\nNGO as a whole expressed and constructed their interactions\nto accomplish their goals and manage tensions in their inter-\nnal organizing processes. We encourage further research in\nthe communities' co-constitution of communicative labor\nwith MAE and with greater attention to diverse stakeholders\nand sites of operation. We note that it would be informative\nto do similar research with members of other environmental\nsustainability organizations around the globe and in connec-\ntion with the adaptive-transformative capacities inherent in\ncommunity resilience (e.g., Long et al., 2015).\nFurthermore, because of the intensity of environmental\nand interactional work that MAE members do, we suggest\nthat consideration of greater understanding of their everyday\nresilience labor might prove productive. Following Agarwal\nand Buzzanell's (2015) study on not-for-profit members'\nefforts to sustain their identification, involvement, and abili-\nties to assist others and themselves in reintegrating after\ndisasters, we note that MAE members' remarks during inter-\nviews and their activities when faced with environmental\nwrongdoing and crises seem to align with the familial, ideo-\nlogical, and destruction-renewal network ties that Agarwal\nand Buzzanell found. Understanding MAE members' com-\nmunicative construction of resilience might offer further\ninsights into their organizing processes, perceived meaning-\nfulness of their work, and other aspects.\nTo close, through our case study of a Brazilian not-for-\nprofit focused on sustainability initiatives, we expand knowl-\nedge about tensions inherent in communicative labor and\norganizing paradoxes in different Brazilian organizational\nenvironments, but especially in the third (nonprofit/nongov-\nernmental) sector. Communicative labor processes displayed\nhow members entered into, thought about, structured, and\nsustained interaction strategically to resolve tensions and to\nmodel the interactive processes that are considered to be a\nhallmark of the particular Brazilian third-sector organization\nthat we studied. Our findings not only contribute theoreti-\ncally to tensional approaches to organizational communica-\ntion but also pragmatically to how sustainability efforts\nrequiring collaborations for work accomplishment and mem-\nber identifications are perceived to operate. Because we pre-\nsented our findings and their implications to the NGO\nleadership who wanted to find out how they might engage\nwith each other and their work more productively, we con-\nsider our work to be engaged scholarship that contributes to\nthe ways members make sense of and navigate NGO's ethi-\ncal and political work (Dempsey, 2012; Dempsey & Barge,\n2014) in sustainability realms, as well as the ways contradic-\ntion and paradox are part of communicative labor (Dempsey,\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. The city of Londrina, located in the North of the state of Parana,\ncovering 171,500 hectares, Londrina has a large rural area that\nhas around 600 rivers and streams. The valley floors where the\nstreams are located are areas of permanent preservation and\nconstitute \"Linear Parks\" (following the course of the stream).\nThese are rare in cities the size of Londrina. These parks help\nstabilize the climate, protect water resources, reduce the pres-\nsures of urbanization, and are sought out for recreation. The\nTibagi, the largest river in the basin, supplies 60% of the city's\ndrinking water and has suffered consequences of environmen-\ntal degradation.\n2. Except for having a president, Meio Ambiente Equilibrado\n(MAE) is organized around three study and production\ngroups: Grupo de DireitoAmbiental (GDA, the Group\nfor Environmental Law), Grupo T\u00e9cnico Ambiental\n(GTA, the Group of Environmental Experts), and Grupo\nComunica\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental (GCA, the Group for Environmental\nCommunication). The GDA consists of interns, law students,\nvolunteers, and lawyers. In partnership with Londrina's\nProsecutor for Environmental Affairs, this specific group\nundertakes all stages of civil action, from investigation to fil-\ning suit in court based upon environmental and urban law. This\ngroup's primary areas of action include regions of permanent\npreservation, public service contracts, plazas, and the devel-\nopment of privately owned subdivisions in environmentally\nprotected areas (which are often authorized by government\nagencies, but still result in environmental degradation and\npublic health risks). The professionals from the GTA focus on\nproving scientific research to be used as reference for any legal\nproceedings filed by the GDA. Their research generally tar-\ngets environmental recovery, reforestation, and water, wildlife,\nflora, and urban zoning. The GCA oversees public and press\nrelations, and also develops public awareness campaigns.\nReferences\nAgarwal, V., & Buzzanell, P. M. (2015).
