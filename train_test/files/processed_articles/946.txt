Generally, STD reports were higher for adoles-\ncents not living in 2-parent homes, and lower income was only asso-\nciated for black males.\nConclusion: Overall, SES is only a weak to moderate marker for\nadolescent STD risks. The relationship of SES and STDs varies by the\nSES measure used and differs across race\u00adgender groups. Other\nindividual factors such as risk behaviors or community factors such as\nincome inequality could play a more critical role for adolescent STDs\nthan family SES.\namong adolescents between 15 and 20 years old in the United\nStates.1,2 Racial and gender disparities in STDs still exist between\ngroups of adolescents. In 2001, the reported number of chlamydial\ninfections, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary syphilis for\nblack females were 3.5 times that of black males, 2 times that of\nwhite females, and 16 times that of white males.3\nBeyond identification of racial and gender disparities in adoles-\ncent STD outcomes,4,5 few studies have considered factors related\nto these differences. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been as-\nsessed in relation to racial disparities in self-reported STDs in the\nYouth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and gonor-\nrhea or chlamydial infections rates among 12 to 20 year olds in San\nFrancisco.6,7 In the YRBSS, black\u00adwhite differences in reported\nSTDs actually increased after adjustment for parental education,\nfamily income, and regional location.7 In San Francisco, racial\ndifferences in gonorrhea rates decreased with declining neighbor-\nhood SES, but disparities in chlamydial infections were not con-\nsistently affected by neighborhood SES.6\nDirect statistical comparisons of adjusted risks in racial/ethnic\nor gender groups have been criticized because the exchangeability\nconditions that give adjusted estimates their interpretability are\nhard to justify in substantive terms.8\u00ad10 In these comparisons,\nblack is the exposed group and white is the unexposed group,\nalthough this counterfactual cannot be justified as a result of the\npractical impossibility of conditioning on a sufficient number or\ntype of measured variables. Statistical comparisons of adjusted\nrisks in racial/ethnic groups remain problematic even when con-\nsidering only a single aspect in these comparisons. For example,\nwhen racial comparisons are adjusted for SES, residual associa-\ntions between race and social position persist after adjustment\nbecause measured SES quantities are an incomplete representation\nof true social position and its many correlates.8,11,12 Stratification\nby race/ethnicity and gender has been suggested as one way to\nconsider differences between groups while avoiding problems of\nThe authors acknowledge David Savitz, Kathie Harris, Olga Sarmiento,\nDionne Gesink Law, Rebecca James Baker, Lynne Sampson, Marlene\nSmurzynski, and Rachel Williams for their contributions to this manu-\nscript.\nSupport was provided in part by the UNC STD Clinical Research Center\n(NIAID UO131496) (WCM, VJS) and the Clinical Associate Physician\nProgram of the General Clinical Research Center (RR00046), Division of\nResearch Resources, National Institutes of Health (WCM).

SES was measured by 4 different indicators: maternal\neducational attainment, maternal occupation, household composi-\ntion, and adjusted household income. We hypothesized that family\nSES markers would differ by race and gender and that income\nwould be a relatively weak marker, particularly among blacks.\nThese analyses were performed on black and white adolescents\nbetween the ages of 12 and 21 participating in the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave 1\nMaterials and Methods\nThe design and methods for Add Health have been described\npreviously.14 Briefly, Add Health is a longitudinal study of a\nmultistaged sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. The Add\nHealth sample with appropriate application of sampling weights is\nrepresentative of in-school American adolescents. In addition to\nin-depth adolescent interviews during 1995, a parent or caregiver\nwas interviewed when available.\nThe current study population includes non-Hispanic black and\nwhite adolescents who reported a history of sexual intercourse\nwhite females, and 1485 white males. The sample was limited to\nsexually experienced adolescents, because STD risks are minimal\nand 3402 (71%) white males were excluded as a result of lack of\nsexual experience.\nThe outcome, any self-reported STD history, was based on\nresponses to questions about having ever been told by a clinician\nthat they had gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomo-\nniasis, genital warts, herpes simplex virus, or HIV/AIDS.\nWe assessed 4 socioeconomic indicators: maternal educational\nattainment, maternal occupation, family household composition,\nand 1994 adjusted household income. Self-reported maternal ed-\nucational attainment was categorized into high school graduate or\nless, some post-high school education, and college graduate or\nfurther education. The categories of adolescent-reported maternal\noccupation were no occupation, service or manual labor, nonpro-\nfessional office, and professional. The adolescent report of mater-\nnal occupation was used because only 1 caregiver was interviewed,\nand the survey question related to the occupation of that individual\nrather than the occupation of both parents. Household composi-\ntion, as reported by the adolescent, was grouped into 2-parent,\nsingle-mother, and other household structures, which included\nsingle-father homes, foster placements, and households headed by\nnonparent family members. Parental report of household income\nwas divided by the federal poverty threshold income for the same\nhousehold size to represent the relative amount of income beyond\nbasic subsistence.16,17 Income was then categorized relative to the\nAnalyses were performed separately by race and sex to allow for\ninvestigation of factors important for each of these groups. Prev-\nalence odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using generalized esti-\nmating equations (GEE) that accounted for the complex survey\ndesign of Add Health (stratified, unequally weighted sample with\nmultiple sampling levels) with the GENMOD procedure in SAS\nFor each race\u00adgender group, simple models were developed\nseparately for each of the 4 SES measures. The influence of several\nother variables on the SES\u00adSTD associations was assessed in\nmultiple logistic regression using GEE, accounting for the com-\nplex survey design. Variables assessed as potential confounding or\nmodifying factors included age, sexual behaviors (number of sex-\nual partners, history of trading sex for money or drugs, and history\nof rape experience [female as survivor/male as perpetrator]), sex-\nual risk perceptions (sexual orientation, condom use knowledge,\nand feelings regarding protection against STD and HIV risks),\nnonsexual risk behaviors (substance use, including cigarettes, al-\ncohol, marijuana, and cocaine; history of being held back a grade\nin school; perceived health status; and lack of health insurance),\nand parental factors (parents belonging to the parent\u00adteacher or-\nganization [PTO] and parent's satisfaction with the parent\u00adchild\nrelationship). Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were used to iden-\ntify intervening variables not appropriate for inclusion in the\nIn models containing each SES measure and 1 additional factor,\nfactors were tested for effect modification and were retained, as\nsuch, if stratum-specific ORs differed by 150% or more and the\nBreslow-Day test of homogeneity was significant (P 0.20); how-\never, no factors met these criteria. Initial assessment of confound-\ning was based on models with each SES factor and a single\nadditional variable. Factors creating 10% or greater change in the\nSES\u00adSTD ORs were placed in full models. Backward elimination\nwas used to eliminate variables from full models, dropping each\nadjustment factor 1 at a time. Factors that created a 10% or greater\nchange the SES\u00adSTD associations were retained in final models.\nTo improve robustness, final models are based on analysis of\nimputed data from multiple Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nimputations performed in the SAS MI procedure.21 Because re-\nsponse to the household income measure was low (74%), sensi-\ntivity analysis on a range of possible values for missing incomes\nwas performed. For the sensitivity analysis, 1 of the following was\nused to replace missing income values: 1) values imputed in SAS\nMI, 2) median tract income, or 3) placement of all missing values\nin the high, or 4) low income categories. Results from these\nreplacements were compared with results for individuals with\nnonmissing income data (complete cases).\nThis study was approved by the University of North Carolina\nMedical Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nThe mean age for each race\u00adgender group of study participants\nwas 17 years old (standard error [SE]  0.1). Over 50% of black\nmales reported engaging in sexual intercourse with more than 1\npartner (Table 1), whereas less than 50% of the other race\u00adgender\ngroups reported multiple partners. Reports of all types of drug use,\nincluding cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and marijuana\nor cocaine use, were more common among white adolescents than\nblack adolescents with white males having the most prevalent drug\nuse.\nIndicators of Socioeconomic Status\nNationally representative estimates of family SES were gener-\nally lower for black adolescents (Table 2). Eleven percent to 15%\nof black adolescents had college-graduate mothers, whereas close\nto 20% of white adolescents had college-graduate mothers. Close\nto 70% of each race\u00adgender group had mothers who worked in\nservice fields, manual labor, or nonprofessional office positions.\nSingle-mother homes were the most common living arrangements\nfor black adolescents, whereas over two thirds of white adolescents\nlived with 2 parents. Over 50% of black adolescents were in the\nlowest-income group, whereas fewer than 25% of white adoles-\ncents had this same income level.\nSexually Transmitted Disease Prevalence\nThe prevalence of STD reports was lowest among white males\ngroup was chlamydial infection.\nMaternal Education\nLower maternal education was weakly, but not significantly, asso-\nciated with higher STD reports across all groups, except white fe-\nmales. The odds of STDs for black females with mothers in the high\nblack females with college-graduate mothers (Table 3). The odds of\nmothers in the lowest educational group than for those with college-\ngraduate mothers. STD levels were lower or similar for white females\nin the lower maternal education groups compared with those with\ncollege-educated mothers. For white males, a strong but imprecise\nassociation existed between lower maternal education and STDs.\nAfter adjusting for additional factors, maternal education\u00adSTD asso-\nciations changed very little (Table 4).\nMaternal Occupation\nIn bivariate analyses, nonprofessional maternal occupations ap-\npeared to be associated with higher STD reports for all groups\nexcept white females (Table 3). Black females with mothers em-\nreport STDs than black females with mothers in professional\noccupations. Black males experienced similar or greater magni-\ntudes of effect as black females, but these associations were less\nprecise and not statistically significant. For white females, mater-\nnal occupation was not associated with STD reports in contrast to\nTABLE 1.

STD reports appeared to be higher\nfor white males with mothers in nonprofessional occupations with\nstrong associations for service and office-position categories, but\nthese associations were imprecise.\nAfter adjustment, associations between nonprofessional mater-\nnal occupations and reported STDs increased slightly for black\nfemales (Table 4). For the other race\u00adgender groups, these asso-\nciations changed little, typically toward the null.\nHousehold Composition\nIn bivariate models, self-reported STDs were consistently higher\nfor those living in single-father, nonparental, or foster homes\n(Table 3). For all groups, the odds of STDs were approximately 2\ntimes higher for adolescents in these households compared with\nthose in 2-parent homes. Single-mother households were not\nstrongly associated with STDs for black females, black males, and\nwhite females. With only 1 STD report among white males in\nsingle-mother homes, a negative association with STDs was found.\nAfter adjustment, most household composition\u00adSTD associations\nremained unchanged or decreased slightly (Table 4). Household\ncomposition associations increased for black males to 2.9 times\n(95% CI, 1.1\u00ad7.5) higher odds of STDs for other household types\nmother homes when compared with 2-parent homes.\nTABLE 2.

In the\nlowest-income group, STD odds for black males were 2.7 (0.5\u00ad\n15.4) times higher than those with the highest income, but this\nestimate is imprecise. The associations between lower household\nincome and reported STDs changed little in multivariate analysis\n(Table 4).\nSensitivity Analysis of Missing Household Income Data\nAs a result of the high level of missing household income data\n(26%), which was unlikely to be missing at random,12 we per-\nformed a sensitivity analysis of unadjusted income\u00adSTD associa-\ntions with missing incomes replaced with different values. Asso-\nciations for black females, white females, and white males varied\nlittle across the different replacement methods (Table 5), suggest-\ning that income was missing approximately at random in these\ngroups. For black males, however, when missing values were\nplaced into the lowest-income group, the results were similar to\ncomplete case associations. Given that STDs were more prevalent\ndifferences suggest that reported crude and adjusted lower in-\ncome\u00adSTD associations for black males could be underestimates\nof the true association.\nDiscussion\nThe relationships among SES, race, gender, and negative health\noutcomes have been repeatedly identified as important public\nhealth issues.12,22\u00ad24 However, these associations are difficult to\nassess because of complexities in the relationships among race,\ngender, and SES, as well as the difficulty in identifying appropriate\nSES measures.8,9,11 In this examination of family SES and adoles-\ncent self-reports of STDs, we performed analyses stratified by race\nand gender, because direct comparisons have limited validity ow-\ning to the inability to adjust for the myriad of factors responsible\nfor observed differences. We examined 4 SES measures to assess\ndifferences in their associations with adolescent STD reports for\nthese race\u00adgender groups.\nWe observed substantial differences in the family SES and STD\nrelationships by race, gender, and SES measure. Generally, mea-\nsures indicating lower SES were more consistently related to STD\namong blacks. Family structure, maternal occupation, and, to a\nlesser extent, maternal education were associated with STDs\namong black females and males. For black males, the association\nof STDs with maternal education and occupation were not statis-\ntically significant; however, the magnitude of the point estimates\nwere comparable to those of black females, suggesting important,\nbut imprecise, effects. In contrast, only nontraditional family struc-\nture was associated with STD among white females. Income was\ngenerally a poor indicator of STD risk in all groups, as expected.\nThe observed differences in the association of SES measures\nand STDs by race and gender could represent racial differences in\nTABLE 4.

The single absolute, and difficult-\nto-measure, risk factor for STD acquisition is sexual contact with\nan infected partner. One step removed from this risk factor is\nparticipation in a sexual network with infected persons. In the\nUnited States, sexual networks are highly segregated by race.25,26\nFurthermore, the geographic distribution of blacks and whites by\nSES is not equivalent. Lower SES blacks tend to be concentrated\nin urban areas and the rural southeast,27 both areas with a high\nprevalence of STDs. In contrast, lower SES whites are spread\nthroughout rural areas in the remainder of the United States, which\ntend to have low STD prevalence. Our results suggest that for\nblacks, economic advantage, measured by maternal education or\nmaternal occupation, could be associated with removal from a high\nSTD-prevalence sexual network to a lower-risk network, perhaps\nthrough relocation to a more affluent area. In contrast, white\nadolescents with lower SES could be living in areas with histori-\ncally low STD prevalence. It would be of interest to assess the\ncontextual settings that these adolescents reside within to deter-\nmine whether the geographic context of their communities are\nclearly associated with the individual SES measures and STD\nprevalence.\nWe expected family SES to have a stronger impact on adoles-\ncent STDs because family SES should affect the adolescent's\nproximity to and interactions with high-risk sexual networks. We\nanticipated that family SES would influence residential loca-\nand parental capacity to discuss sexual risks.29,33\u00ad43 Instead, the\nrelatively weak associations found suggest that family SES might\nbe less important than other factors such as individual risk behav-\niors and community-level influences, including community SES.\nIndividual factors such as number of sexual partners and trading\nsex for drugs or money have been associated with STD reports in\nracial\u00adgender subgroups.44 Additionally, when adjusted for indi-\nvidual risk behaviors, black\u00adwhite disparities in adolescent STDs\nwere reduced, whereas they increased when adjusted for SES.7\nAlthough neighborhood poverty levels were not found to consis-\ntently reduce racial disparities in adolescent STDs,40 other com-\nmunity-level influences such as income inequality, segregation,\nand social capital investment have yet to be investigated and could\nprove to be critical for disparities in adolescent STDs as they have\nWe did not anticipate an absence of association between mater-\nnal education or occupation and STDs for white females. In\naddition to the potential contextual explanations, differences in\nindividual risk behavior could contribute to the observed differ-\nences in SES measures. Among female adolescents, lower parental\neducation has been associated with early sexual activity but not\nwith number of sexual partners,48 suggesting less variation in\nsexual risks across SES levels for white females compared with\nother groups. Although we adjusted for the number of sexual\npartners, we could not assess other partnership characteristics such\nas concurrency49,50 and partnership age or racial dispari-\ntions.\nUnfortunately, in the United States, race remains a marker of\nSTD prevalence. The substantial disparity in STDs by race is\nunlikely to be the result of biologic mechanisms, but rather, results\nfrom a complex interaction of individual and contextual factors,\nincluding SES. The complexity of these numerous relationships\ncontributes to the fact that observed racial disparities cannot be\nadequately assessed in single models directly comparing racial\ngroups. In epidemiologic terms, direct race comparisons are diffi-\ncult to justify because the implicit counterfactual comparison is not\njustifiable.8\u00ad10 By examining the relationship of SES measures and\nSTD after stratification by race and gender, we clearly demon-\nstrated that the association of these measures with STDs differs by\nrace, which supports our underlying rationale for using this strat-\nified approach.\nSES is a multifaceted construct that cannot be described ade-\nquately with a single measure. We observed, as have others in-\nvestigating similar outcomes including adult STDs55 and adoles-\ncent initiation of sexual intercourse,48 that household income had\nweaker associations than other SES measures. Although measure-\nment error and missing data are plausible explanations for this\nweak association, income could simply not reflect the complexity\nof SES. Other measures of family SES such as wealth,12,56 parental\n(not only maternal) measures, or composites of multiple SES\nmeasures56 could have provided different insights than the 4 SES\nmeasures used.\nOur selected socioeconomic indicators have potential limita-\ntions, including appropriateness, number of missing observations,\ndifferential reporting, and measurement error. We held the SES\nTABLE 5.

With\nfewer blacks in the highest SES groups and fewer whites in the\nlower groups, we lose the ability to create categories representing\nthe nonoverlapping tails of these distributions, which could be\ncritical in health disparities.12,22,57 Also, the same absolute levels\nof SES do not imply the same level of benefits for each group with\nblacks and females benefiting less than whites and males at the\nThe cross-sectional study design limits assessment of the causal\nrelationship between SES and STD reports. However, directions of\npotential causal relationships are not in doubt because the family\nSES indicators (maternal education, maternal occupation, house-\nhold composition, and annual household income) are unlikely to\nresult from an adolescent's STD status. Temporality could be a\nproblem, particularly in relation to other variables included in this\nstudy. The outcome includes infections occurring throughout the\nsexual histories of these adolescents, so we cannot be certain that\nrisk behaviors and attitudes preceded STD diagnosis.58\nAlthough the STD prevalences in this study are similar to those\nfrom other adolescent STD research,7 our prevalence underesti-\nmates the true prevalence of infections because it is based on\nself-reports. Potential causes for underestimation include underre-\nporting, asymptomatic infections, and lack of screening in high-\nrisk populations. Underreporting of STD diagnoses can result from\nembarrassment or misunderstanding of a diagnosis.59,60 In Add\nHealth, audio computer-assisted interviews (A-CASI) were con-\nducted to limit bias and nonresponse for sensitive items such as\nSTD histories.61\u00ad64 Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infec-\ntions are common among females and would be missed unless\nscreening occurred.65,66 Female patients commonly undergo STD\nscreening, but regular contact with the medical system is less\nfrequent for adolescent males. However, because sexually trans-\nmitted infections are more commonly symptomatic in males, treat-\nWe combined multiple STDs in a single measure to maximize\nthe STD prevalence.

However, more in-depth\nconsiderations of adolescent STD disparities have been limited.\nOur results demonstrate important differences in family SES and\nincreased adolescent STD reports when stratified by race and\ngender. Future investigation of adolescent STD disparities, partic-\nularly with biologic measures of prevalent infections, should strat-\nify by race and gender when possible. In addition, studies consid-\nering the role of SES should include multiple indicators. For most\nadolescents, family SES has minimal effects on STD risks, but\nother factors could still influence these outcomes, including ado-\nlescent-specific factors and community-specific factors.\nReferences\n1.
