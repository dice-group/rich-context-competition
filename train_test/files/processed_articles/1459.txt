The majority of US adults (56%, or 87 million individuals) are at low short-term\nbut high lifetime predicted risk for cardiovascular disease. Twenty-six percent (41 million adults) are at low short-term and\nlow lifetime predicted risk, and only 18% (28 million individuals) are at high short-term predicted risk. The addition of\nlifetime risk estimation to 10-year risk estimation identifies higher-risk women and younger men in particular.\nConclusions--Whereas 82% of US adults are at low short-term risk, two thirds of this group, or 87 million people, are at\nhigh lifetime predicted risk for cardiovascular disease.

We previously devel-\noped an algorithm to predict lifetime risk for cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) and found that risk factors measured at age 50\nyears effectively stratified Framingham Study participants to\na spectrum of observed lifetime CVD rates (5.2% to 68.9%)\nand median survivals (39 to 28 years).4 These patterns were\nsimilar in contemporary US multi-ethnic cohorts for risk\nfactors measured at various ages.5 Furthermore, we recently\nused this algorithm to investigate the implications of long-term\npredicted risk for CVD specifically among those at low 10-year\npredicted risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).6 Even at\nshort-term but high (39%) lifetime predicted risk had greater-\nburden and progression of subclinical CVD compared with the\nlow short-term and low (39%) lifetime risk group.6\nEditorial see p 4\nRecognizing that current risk assessment strategies may\ninadequately assess CVD risk in many women and younger\nmen, US national guidelines from the NCEP7 and the Amer-\nican Heart Association8 now endorse consideration of life-\ntime risk in primary prevention.

Furthermore, specific lifetime risk estimates may be\nused to enhance risk communication and motivation for\npatients with high predicted lifetime risk but low predicted\nshort-term risk, as well as to assist policy makers and\nresearchers seeking to understand current or project future\nCVD burden. However, a formal method for synthesizing\ninformation about 10-year and lifetime risks is not currently\nprovided. A stepwise stratification system whereby individ-\nuals with low short-term predicted risk are then evaluated for\nlifetime predicted risk could accomplish this, but the potential\nutility of designating a low short-term/high lifetime risk\ngroup of Americans would be better appreciated if the\npopulation prevalence of this group were known. Therefore,\nwe applied our previously published lifetime risk algorithm to\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nUS adults in each of 3 risk groups: low short-term CHD/low\nlifetime CVD, low short-term CHD/high lifetime CVD, and\nhigh short-term CHD predicted risk.\nMethods\nStudy Participants\nWe included CVD-free, nonpregnant participants ages 20 to 79 years\nthe noninstitutionalized US population9 targeted by the NCEP/ATP\nIII for cardiovascular risk prediction.7 We defined participants as\nhaving CVD if they answered \"yes\" when asked if a doctor or health\nprofessional ever told them they had CHD, heart attack, stroke, or\ncongestive heart failure. We excluded participants with missing\nvalues for blood pressure (n698), cholesterol (n306), or height or\nweight (n63) to obtain our final study sample (n6329) (Supple-\nmental Figure 1). For self-reported data, answers other than \"yes\"\nwere assumed to be \"no.\"\nRisk Factor Ascertainment\nWe defined CVD risk factors as follows. Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined by self-reported health professional\u00addiagnosed diabetes (but\nnot \"borderline\" diabetes); cigarette smoking was defined by self-\nreport of currently smoking every day or some days and having\nsmoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime; and antihypertensive and\nlipid-lowering medication use was also defined by self-report. Blood\npressure measures were performed by trained and certified physi-\ncians using previously described procedures and a mercury manom-\neter9; the average of the last 2 measurements were used whenever\navailable, although single measurements were used if they were the\nonly available measurements. Total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\ncholesterol were measured as described previously.9 Obesity was\ndefined as body mass index 30 kg/m2.\nDefinitions of Risk Strata\nWe determined the distribution of 3 risk strata in the US population:\nlow 10-year/low lifetime, low 10-year/high lifetime, and high 10-\nyear predicted risk, as defined below. For the main analysis, we\ncalculated 10-year predicted risk for hard CHD (myocardial infarc-\ntion or coronary death) for all participants using the ATP III risk\nassessment tool,10 and we defined a calculated risk of 10% or\ndiagnosed diabetes as \"high 10-year predicted risk\" because individ-\nuals with this level of predicted risk would potentially be eligible for\nintensive preventive measures, including drug therapy.7 Among the\nparticipants with low (10%) 10-year predicted risk (and no\ndiabetes), we assigned lifetime predicted risk for CVD (myocardial\ninfarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, atherothrombotic stroke,\nintermittent claudication, or CVD death) using our previously\npublished algorithm,4,6 as shown in Table 1. We defined \"low\nlifetime predicted risk\" as the 2 lower risk strata (\"all optimal\" or\n\"1 not optimal\" risk factors), which, according to our prior work,\nhave predicted lifetime risk 39%,4 and \"high lifetime predicted\nrisk\" as the 3 higher risk strata (\"1 elevated,\" \"1 major\" or \"2\nmajor\" risk factors), which have predicted lifetime risk 39%.4 This\nstratification was chosen a priori based on the previously observed\napparent natural separation in lifetime risks of these 2 groups in the\nFramingham cohorts4 as well as in a large pooled sample of US\nmulti-ethnic cohorts.5 It has been further justified with recent work\ndemonstrating differential burden and progression of subclinical athero-\nsclerosis in younger adults using the identical stratification algorithm.6\nIn further analyses, we also included obesity (body mass index\nmg/dL for women) as major risk factors. To examine whether a more\nstringent definition of low short-term risk would weaken the distinc-\nTable 1.

For\nthe first, we defined low short-term risk as 6% predicted 10-year\nrisk for hard CHD (and absence of diabetes) using the ATP III risk\nassessment tool.10 For the second, we defined low short-term risk as\n20% predicted 10-year risk for total CVD (coronary death,\nmyocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, ischemic\nstroke, hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intermittent\nclaudication, or heart failure) (and absence of diabetes) using the risk\nfunctions published by D'Agostino et al.11\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used survey procedures in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC) to generate accurate frequencies and variances accounting for\nthe complex, multistage design of the NHANES. We used the survey\nweights to estimate the number of noninstitutionalized, CVD-free\nand nonpregnant US adults ages 20 to 79 years in each group.\nAnalyses were performed for all eligible adults and were stratified by\nage, sex, and race subgroups. For some subgroup analyses, we split\nthe population into fewer categories to avoid presenting data from\ncells with fewer than 30 subjects, as recommended by the NHANES\nAnalytic Guidelines.9 When results from fewer subjects are provided,\nthis is noted in the tables.

Exclusion on the basis of\nmissing variables was somewhat more likely for blacks (19.4%)\ncompared with whites (12.1%). The final study sample was\nrepresentative of 86.4% of the noninstitutionalized, nonpregnant,\nCVD-free US population ages 20 to 79 years. Specific partici-\npant characteristics, weighted to reflect the US population, are\nshown in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.\nDistribution of Risk Strata\nAmong the overwhelming majority (82.0%) of US adults\nwith low short-term predicted risk (Table 2), two thirds are at\nhigh lifetime predicted risk, whereas only one third are at low\nlifetime predicted risk (see Table 1). Of note, the proportion\nof US adults with very low lifetime risk due to all optimal risk\nfactors is small, at 11.4%; the proportion is smaller in men\nthan in women and is dramatically smaller in older compared\nwith younger age groups (Table 2). The estimated size of the\nUS population in each risk stratum is shown in Figure 1.\nEffect of Demographic Variables on Risk Strata\nAt the youngest ages, almost all men and women are at low\nshort-term predicted risk, and further stratification by lifetime\npredicted risk produces 2 groups of substantial sizes in both\nsexes (Table 2). For example, as shown in Figure 2, the\nmajority of men younger than 60 years and women younger\nthan 80 years old are at low 10-year predicted risk, and\namong this large group the majority have low 10-year but\nhigh lifetime predicted risk. However, at older ages the\nproportion at high short-term predicted risk is markedly\nhigher in men than in women, such that in the oldest age\nwomen are at low-short term predicted risk. Thus, at older\nages, lifetime risk stratification identifies a much larger group\nshort-term/high lifetime risk compared with men (7.4% of\nmen ages 60 to 79 years) (Table 2 and Figure 2). Patterns of\npredicted risks are similar among races; although Mexican-\nAmericans had lower predicted risk compared with other\nracial groups (Table 2), this is probably the result of their\nyounger age distribution (Supplemental Table 1).\nEffect of Including Low HDL Cholesterol and\nObesity as Major Risk Factors\nWhen low HDL cholesterol and obesity are also counted as\nmajor risk factors, the proportion with high lifetime predicted\nrisk is larger, though modestly so (Table 3). For example,\nincluding both risk factors causes 10.3% of adults to move\nfrom the low short-term/low lifetime predicted risk group to\nthe low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group.\nDistribution of Major Risk Factors\nTable 4 gives the proportion and absolute numbers of US adults\naffected with each of the elevated and major risk factors. The\nwide distribution of isolated risk factors indicates that no single\nrisk factor is responsible for determining the lifetime risk\nstratification. For example, despite its high prevalence (espe-\ncially among younger adults), smoking as the sole risk factor\nresults in high lifetime predicted risk status in only 9.4% of\nindividuals who have low short-term predicted risk.\nEffect of Altering Low Short-Term Risk Definitions\nWhen low short-term risk is defined either as 6% predicted\n10-year risk for hard CHD (and absence of diabetes) using the\nrisk for total CVD (and absence of diabetes) using the risk\nfunctions published by D'Agostino et al,11 the distribution of\nlifetime predicted risk among those at low short-term pre-\ndicted risk does not change meaningfully (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThe present report represents the first analysis of the distri-\nbution of lifetime CVD risk strata in the US population, and\nit has 2 major findings.

Among those 40 to 59 years of age, a\ngroup that may be of particular interest for clinical preven-\ntion, 80% have low short-term predicted risk, but three\nfourths of these have high lifetime predicted risk. Second, the\nsize of the low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group\nis substantial in women and younger men, precisely the\npopulations for which the ATP III risk assessment tool has\nCurrent Study in Context\nPrior studies have reported the distribution of lifetime CVD\nrisk strata in selected cohorts.4\u00ad6 Using the same lifetime risk\nalgorithm used in the present study, these prior studies\ndemonstrated that the low short-term risk group comprises 2\ngroups, which are defined by lifetime predicted risk and are\nquite disparate with respect to subclinical disease burden and\nprogression6 as well as CVD event rates over the lifespan.4,5\nAlthough these studies are valuable for their outcome mea-\nsurements, a strength of the present study is that the contem-\nporary nationally representative sample provides more rele-\nvant information about the current distribution of lifetime risk\nstrata in the United States.\nPrevious reports have provided the distribution of short-\nterm CHD risk strata in the US population, with about three\nfourths of US adults consistently classified as \"low risk\" by\nATP III guidelines.1\u00ad3 However, there has been no prior\nreport of the distribution of lifetime CVD risk strata in the US\npopulation, and the present study demonstrates the striking\ndeparture of this distribution from that of 10-year CHD risk.\nWhereas 82% of CVD-free US adults are at \"low risk\" based\non 10-year CHD predicted risk alone, the group at \"low/low\nrisk\" based on stepwise stratification by lifetime CVD pre-\ndicted risk is much smaller, at 26%.\nSignificance of Demographic Variables and Risk\nFactor Definitions\nAlthough the Framingham Risk Score for 10-year predicted\nrisk of CHD represents an important advance in primary\nprevention that has allowed clinicians to match intensity of\ntherapy to absolute risk, it has well-recognized limitations,\nparticularly in women and younger men.1,12\u00ad14 The stepwise\nstratification system used in the present analysis identifies a\nlow short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group that is\nhighly prevalent in the US population, particularly in women\nand younger men. This is because the lifetime risk algorithm\ncomprising the \"second step\" in our stratification is not\ndependent on sex or age and stratifies observed lifetime risk\nsimilarly for both sexes and all adult age groups studied to\ndate,5 whereas the Framingham Risk Score (and the related\nATP III tool) is overwhelmingly dependent on the weighting\nof the sex and age variables. In fact, we showed in the present\nanalysis that the lifetime risk algorithm is not driven by any\nsingle risk factor and that it identifies a substantial low\nshort-term/high lifetime risk group even when stringent\ndefinitions of low short-term risk are applied.\nClinical and Public Health Implications\nWe therefore believe that our results provide support for\nadoption of this stratification system by healthcare profes-\nsionals to aid risk communication for a large segment of the\nUS population. Assigning a lifetime predicted risk status to\nUS adults presenting for primary prevention would change\nthe message to those 87 million individuals with low short-\nterm but high lifetime predicted risk. As an example of what\nthese individuals may be counseled to expect in terms of\nabsolute risk, 50-year-old participants in the Framingham\nHeart Study with \"high predicted lifetime risk\" had absolute\nto 50.2% for women.4 For a specific illustration of the\nmotivational utility of the lifetime risk estimate, consider a\n50-year-old nonsmoking, nondiabetic woman with total cho-\nlesterol of 240 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 58 mg/dL, and\nuntreated systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg. Her 10-year\nhard CHD risk is 2% according to ATP III, but her lifetime\nCVD risk is a more motivating 50%.4 Additionally, individ-\nuals with low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk could be\ninformed that at present, even at young ages, they probably\nhave significantly greater subclinical disease burden com-\npared with those with low short-term/low lifetime predicted\nrisk due to a more favorable risk factor profile.6 Such facts may\nbe useful for motivating lifestyle changes or adherence to\nTable 3.

The more\ninclusive focus on total atherosclerotic CVD as the end point for\nlifetime risk makes the estimate more relevant for women,\nwhose majority of first events are stroke rather than CHD15 and\nwho have considerable morbidity and mortality from other\nnon-CHD outcomes such as heart failure.8,16,17 Furthermore, the\nextended time frame of lifetime risk avoids false reassurance for\nwomen and younger men with unhealthy lifestyle habits who are\nnonetheless \"low risk\" for a coronary event in the short term.\nGiven that more women than men die of CVD each year in the\nUnited States17 and that younger adults are beginning to see a\nreversal in declines in CHD mortality18 (probably caused by\nincreases in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syn-\ndrome in this age group), relevant and motivating risk messages\nare urgently needed for these segments of the population. The\naddition of a second step to risk assessment with lifetime risk\nestimates shows promise in this regard.\nWe believe that our results may also prove useful on a\npublic health level. Our data might assist in the estimation of\ncosts associated with any new guidelines regarding long-term\nrisk, and they also provide a current baseline for population\nburden of lifetime predicted risk against which the effects of\nfuture public health and clinical interventions may be mea-\nsured. In particular, we report that only 11.4% of American\nadults are at optimal predicted risk. This is important because\nintensive pharmacological and behavioral therapy to normal-\nize risk factors in the 87 million individuals with low\nshort-term/high lifetime predicted risk is unlikely to be\nfeasible economically. Avoidance of the onset of risk factors\nin the first place--or primordial prevention19,20--has been\nshown to be not only a more sustainable but also a more\neffective means of reducing CVD mortality than either\ntreating these risk factors (as in primary prevention) or\ntreating clinical CVD (as in secondary prevention).21\u00ad23 In\nfact, multiple studies24\u00ad28 have defined and examined an\noptimal risk group and demonstrated that these individuals\nnot only live substantially longer than those with 1 or more\nelevated risk factors, but they rarely have CVD despite this\nlonger life span and additionally end up with fewer comor-\nbidities, better health-related quality of life, and decreased\nhealthcare costs in older age. Clearly, increasing the propor-\ntion of Americans with both low 10-year and low lifetime\npredicted risk would have dramatically beneficial effects on\npublic health. Thus, programs that focus on primordial\nprevention, in combination with clinical practice that stresses\nthe maintenance of a healthy lifestyle and monitors rates of\nadverse change in risk factor levels even before they become\n\"treatable,\" are likely to have the best long-term success in\nreducing the burden of CVD in the United States.\nPotential Limitations\nBecause fasting glucose levels were not available for the\nmajority of participants, we relied on self-report to identify\ndiabetes; therefore, a small proportion of individuals with\nundiagnosed diabetes may have been misclassified as lower\nrisk. Additionally, the applicability of our risk stratification\nalgorithms to all races is not ensured; both the 10-year10 and\nlifetime4 risk stratification algorithms were developed in the\nexclusively white Framingham cohorts. However, the 10-year\nrisk functions for hard CHD have since been shown to be\ntransportable to other races,10,29 and the lifetime risk stratifi-\ncation algorithm has been validated in the multi-ethnic (black\nand white) US cohorts of the Chicago Heart Association\nDetection Project in Industry30 and the Cardiovascular Life-\ntime Risk Pooling Project5 as well in CARDIA and MESA,\nwith data on subclinical disease.6 Finally, our short-term and\nlifetime predicted risks were for different end points; whereas\nthe short-term outcome for our main analysis is hard CHD, as\nrecommended by current guidelines,7 the lifetime outcome is\ntotal atherosclerotic CVD. However, we did compare short-\nterm CVD with lifetime CVD predicted risk in a secondary\nTable 4.
