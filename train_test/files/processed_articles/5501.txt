The large amount of data now available\nnot only offers great opportunities but also poses new chal-\nlenges. One of the core challenges is the functional equiva-\nlence of the constructs and indicators used. Many social\nscientists who use cross-national comparative survey data\nfor their research are not sufficiently aware of this problem.\nIn the meantime, however, numerous researchers have pro-\nposed strategies to improve the comparability of cross-\nnational survey data and developed statistical tests which\nallow one to determine whether empirical constructs meet\nthe requirements of functional equivalence in all countries in\ncomparison (e.g. Bachleitner et al., 2014; Blasius and\n2010). In this article, we want to make a contribution to this\ntype of research by investigating the functional equivalence\nand validity of religiousness indicators in three prominent\ncross-cultural surveys: the International Social Survey\nProgramme (ISSP; 2008), the World Values Survey (WVS;\nIn the first section of this article, general theoretical\u00ad\nmethodological assumptions and principles of cross-cultural\ncomparisons are discussed. The starting point is the question\nof whether social phenomena are culturally universal and\nthus can be measured in different cultures by means of uni-\nform scales or whether cultural relativism is the more appro-\npriate position. Cross-cultural survey researchers usually\nlean toward cultural universalism, assuming that the investi-\ngated social constructs can be defined and operationalized in\nFunctional equivalence and validity of\nreligiousness indicators in cross-cultural\ncomparative surveys\nFranz H\u00f6llinger and Anja Eder\n Keywords\nCross-cultural research, survey research, functional equivalence (item equivalence, construct equivalence), religiousness\nInstitut f\u00fcr Soziologie, Karl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t Graz, Graz, Austria\nCorresponding author:\nFranz H\u00f6llinger, Institut f\u00fcr Soziologie, Karl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t Graz,\nEmail: franz.hoellinger@uni-graz.at\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\na way that produces equivalent results for all participating\ncountries. Accordingly, it is believed that survey results--\nsimilarities or differences between countries--correspond to\nactual similarities or differences with regard to the measured\nconstructs. However, as we will show, the claims of item\nequivalence, construct equivalence, and content validity\nought to be questioned throughout all phases of the research\nprocess.\nThe topic of religiosity poses particular methodological\nchallenges for cross-cultural surveys. The major reason for\nthis lies in the difficulty of defining \"religion\" and \"religios-\nity\" and of narrowing down these concepts empirically.\nSince \u00c9mile Durkheim, countless sociologists have tried to\npropose an adequate definition of religion. Most sociologists\nagree that a sociological definition of religion should com-\nprise more than monotheistic religiosity; however, there is no\nconsensus concerning the scope of meaning of this term (e.g.\nof this article deals with the basic question of defining reli-\ngion in the context of cross-cultural comparative research.\nIn the third part, we investigate the equivalence and valid-\nity of indicators and constructs for the measurement of reli-\ngiousness in Western (monotheistic) and East Asian religious\ncultures. Therefore, four Christian countries (Spain,\nGermany, Russia, and the United States), one Muslim coun-\ntry (Turkey), and four East Asian countries (Thailand, South\nKorea, Taiwan, and Japan) were selected for the analysis.1\nMeasurements in cross-national comparative surveys can be\ndistorted due to three types of bias: item bias (single items do\nnot measure the underlying indicator in the same way in dif-\nferent countries), construct bias (empirical constructs, for\nexample, scales, do not measure the same underlying theo-\nretical concept in all countries), and method bias (distortion\nof results due to different sampling and application meth-\nods). Our empirical analyses refer to the aspects of item bias\nand construct bias, leaving the question of method bias aside.\nWhereas much of the research in this area is limited to\ntesting functional equivalence by means of sophisticated sta-\ntistical procedures (e.g. Davidov et al., 2011; Matsumoto and\nVan de Vijver, 2011), our contribution starts with the more\nfundamental question of the intercultural meaning of single\nitems that are commonly used for the measurement of religi-\nosity (religious affiliation, prayer, and attending religious\nservice). From a detailed comparison of the linguistic formu-\nlation of these items in different languages and across the\nthree surveys, we try to obtain evidence of whether the\nconcept of religiosity has the same meaning in the selected\ncountries and to what extent the results depend on the exact\nformulation of the item. Subsequently, we use confirmatory\nfactor analysis (CFA) to test whether two religiousness scales\nderived from the ISSP 2008, a scale measuring \"religiosity\"\n(belief in God, prayer, and attendance of religious service)\nand an \"Eastern-belief\" scale (belief in reincarnation,\nNirvana, and spiritual power of ancestors), are structurally\nequivalent across countries. In the final step, we proceed to a\nsubstantive analysis, comparing religiousness scales from\nthe three surveys in order to examine to what extent scales\nthat claim to measure the same construct in fact produce\nsimilar results when applied to different countries.\nMethodological fundamentals and\nchallenges of cross-cultural survey\nresearch\nCross-cultural research claims to investigate attitudes, val-\nues, and social behavior within countries and cultural areas\nas well as to uncover similarities and differences between\nthem (e.g. Haller et al., 2009). On one hand, cross-cultural\nresearch presupposes the existence of universal social char-\nacteristics and behavior (e.g. Hofstede, 2001; Inglehart,\nexample, assumed in his pioneering study \"The elementary\nforms of religious life\" that the fundamental codes of religi-\nosity are similar in primitive and advanced societies. On the\nother hand, anthropologists such as Herskovits (1972) and\nGeertz (1973) argue in favor of a cultural relativistic approach\nthat human attitudes and behavior can be fully understood\nonly in terms of the individual's own culture but not from a\nuniversal scientific perspective. In recent years, the contra-\ndictory positions of cultural universalism and cultural\nrelativism have tended to converge (Reckwitz, 2005).\nThis development has been facilitated by the fact that\ncultural areas are no longer perceived as enclosed contain-\ners (Lefebvre, 1991). Moreover, cultural-deterministic\napproaches assuming a causal effect from culture on the indi-\nvidual have weakened.\nMost social scientists today believe in the existence of\nuniversal types of behavior and values (Bachleitner et al.,\nquestion of which attitudes, values, and social behavior are\nsufficiently universal to be an appropriate topic for cross-\ncultural survey research (Bachleitner et al., 2014). The deci-\nsion whether universality can be assumed depends on the\nspecific topic, theoretical considerations, and spectrum of\ncountries that are compared.\nCross-cultural comparisons presuppose that the investi-\ngated theoretical concepts and item formulations have at\nleast a similar meaning across the compared countries and\ncultural areas. Scholars have been analyzing this classical\nclaim of functional equivalence since the 1960s (Johnson,\n1998). The question of functional equivalence starts with the\ncomparability of theories (equivalence of theory). Given the\nplurality of social scientific theories, there is an obvious lack\nof universal theories which cross-cultural research could rely\non (Bachleitner et al., 2014: 60). In addition, the predomi-\nnant theories were developed on the social and cultural back-\nground of Western countries and cannot be translated easily\ninto non-Western contexts. The problem of equivalence\ncontinues at the level of linguistic formulations. Different\nH\u00f6llinger and Eder 3\nlanguages do not always use the same terms and phrases to\ndescribe the same social phenomenon, and specific terms\nmay have different meanings, relevance, and connotations:\n\"Terms are cultural constructs, which are socially rehearsed,\nare valid in limited regions and underlie traditions\"\n(Bachleitner et al., 2014: 61; translated by the authors). The\ncultural impact on meanings can also be seen in the historical\nchange of the meanings and relevance of terms, which may\noccur at different periods in different societies.\nThe functional equivalence of latent constructs and single\nindicators is a major quality criterion in cross-cultural\nresearch. However, in many cases, this claim leads to the\nselection of the lowest common denominator of measurable\nindicators, which do not have the same relevance in all coun-\ntries. Consequently, social constructs are rarely investigated\nin their comprehensive scope and multidimensionality. In\nother words, in order to satisfy the claim of functional equiv-\nalence, a construct bias is accepted by putting at risk the\nmeasurements' content validity (Van de Vijver and Leung,\nCulture-dependent interpretations of item formulations by\nthe respondents might lead to an item bias, when single items\ndo not measure the underlying indicator in the same way in\ndifferent countries, which in turn puts at risk the content\nvalidity of cross-cultural measurements. Particularly, the\ntranslation of items is a complex task and crucial for the\nequivalence of items. However, \"a literal translation of items\nand questionnaires does not guarantee the equivalence of\ninstruments [...]. Therefore functional equivalence is a much\nmore important objective in comparative research\" (Peschar,\nwhether translation problems are purely linguistic or due to\ndifferent meanings across cultures (for linguistic equiva-\nlence, see Harkness et al., 2010). Even within the same cul-\ntural area, identical questions can have different meanings\nfor subcultures. In order to improve translations, procedures\nlike Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretest, and\nDocumentation (\"TRAPD\") and back translations from the\ntarget language to source language are applied (e.g. Behr\nconstruct and item equivalence in cross-cultural survey\nresearch is to work commonly on the questionnaires with\nrepresentatives from all cultural areas in an equal discourse\nand close teamwork with professional translators (Behr et al.,\nFunctional equivalence in cross-cultural surveys is checked\nwith the usual methods of reliability testing and item statistics.\nReliability is tested in regard to the internal consistency of\nscales (Cronbach's alpha), difficulty of items (variance and\nselectivity), and dimensionality of scales within and across\ncountries. Item statistics provide information on the patterns\nof approval and rejection in the selected countries, but leave\nunclear culturally caused method biases (e.g. culturally\ndependent response patterns). The dimensionality of the data\nis examined by explorative factor analyses or correspondence\nanalyses (e.g. multiple correspondence analyses by Blasius\nand Thiessen, 2006). Currently, the most prominent method\nfor testing construct equivalence is CFA because this proce-\ndure allows one to test whether the data for each country fit the\nspecified theoretical dimensions (see Byrne, 2001). Another\nmethod for the examination of functional equivalence is based\non multi-group comparisons (multi-group confirmatory factor\nanalysis [MGCFA]; see Lubke and Muth\u00e9n, 2004). Commonly\nused fit measures in CFAs are the root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean squared\nresidual (SRMR), and the comparative fit index (CFI).\nHowever, the application of these fit measures has been criti-\ncized for their limited explanatory power (Prudon, 2015).\nStatistical testing of the reliability and functional equiva-\nlence of measurements is a precondition for high-quality\ncross-national comparative survey research, but it does not\nguarantee the content validity of social constructs. Two com-\nmonly used methods for examining construct validity are\ncognitive interviews and the comparison of survey data with\nexternal criteria. So far, only few studies have applied cogni-\ntive interviewing in the context of cross-cultural surveys\nfor the small number of respondents and the problem of\nunstandardized and uncontrolled selection of cases, and\nvious examples indicate that they contribute to prevent sta-\ntistical artifacts in cross-cultural surveys (e.g. H\u00f6llinger\nDefinition and measurement of\nreligiosity\nThe term \"religion\" in its present meaning has existed for\nonly about two centuries. It originated, on one hand, from the\ndiscourses of the Enlightenment that drew a sharper dividing\nline between the mundane and the sacred spheres of life than\nin earlier times; on the other hand, the emerging discipline of\ncomparative religious studies required a general concept of\npoints of reference for the scientific construct of religion\nwere the monotheistic world religions, in particular,\nProtestantism. Sociologists distinguish two types of defini-\ntion of religion: Substantive definitions determine religion\nwith respect to the belief in sacred objects, such as supra-\nnatural beings, or the experience of so-called sacred phe-\nnomena. Riesebrodt (2010), for example, defines religion as\n\"practices that are based on the assumption of the existence\nof (usually invisible) personal or impersonal superhuman\npowers\" (p. 113). In order to avoid theological constrictions,\nthe substance of religion is many times designated by rather\nabstract terms, such as the distinction between a profane and\nbetween immanence and transcendence (Luhmann, 2013;\nSch\u00fctz and Luckmann, 1973). The second type of definition\n4 Methodological Innovations\ndefines religion by its social functions, for example, the\nfunction of coping with the contingencies of human exist-\nence or the function of ensuring social cohesion. Both sub-\nstantive and functional definitions have been related also to a\nnumber of phenomena that are quite far away from the com-\nmonsense understanding of religion, such as the solemn feel-\ning of connectedness with one's nation or the cultic veneration\nDespite the extension of the meaning of religion in theo-\nretical discourse, the overwhelming majority of sociological\nstudies on religion focus on the usual Western understanding\nof the concept. Quantitative surveys that investigate individ-\nual religiousness typically consider religious beliefs (belief\nin superhuman entities or powers, notions of afterlife) and\npractice (such as frequency of attending religious services\nand prayer; e.g. Norris and Inglehart, 2011; Pollack and\nRosta, 2015). In a number of studies, attempts have been\nmade to determine dimensions of religiosity by means of\nscales. Pierre Brechon (2007), for example, distinguishes\nfour dimensions: religious practice, belief in God, religious\nfeelings, and trust in churches.\nThe use of single-variable indicators and/or scales for the\nmeasurement of religiousness raises the question of the sta-\ntistical relationship between different indicators or scales.\nStark and Glock proposed five universal dimensions which\nshould be considered: belief, knowledge, experience, prac-\ntice, and consequences of religiousness (moral conduct of\nlife). In their pioneering studies, they have shown that the\ndimensions of religious belief, ritual participation, individual\ndevotion (prayer), and religious experience are only weakly\ncorrelated with each other (Stark and Glock, 1968). Following\nthis line of research, a number of American studies have con-\nfirmed that these dimensions are partly independent from\neach other. Other scholars, however, have demonstrated that\nthe correlations between different dimensions of religious-\nness are rather strong (on average above 0.50) and thus argue\nthat religiousness should be considered a one-dimensional\nconstruct (a detailed review of these studies can be found\nanalyzed similar religiousness scales in Germany; they\nfound that the three dimensions of practice, belief, and expe-\nrience are strongly correlated, forming a single factor when\nsubmitted to factor analysis, whereas the cognitive dimen-\nsion (religious knowledge) is an independent factor.\nMany sociologists who study religion in cross-national\ncomparative perspective assume that religiosity is a univer-\nsal phenomenon that can be compared across societies\naccording to common criteria of definition and operationali-\nzation. This claim is particularly strong in the case of the RM\n(Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009). Timothy Fitzgerald rejects\nsuch universalistic assumptions vehemently. According to\nhim, the concept of religion as a whole is a Western ideology\nthat has elevated the complex of occidental religion to the\nstatus of a universal concept. This concept was imposed on\nnon-Western societies or accepted voluntarily by them in the\ncourse of colonialism, although the cultural practices of\nthese people many times do not correspond to the Western\nconcept of religion (Fitzgerald, 2000). In his view, this is par-\nticularly true for Eastern Asia because in this cultural area\n\"religious\" and \"secular\" rites and beliefs are so closely con-\nnected with each other that the separation of a specific reli-\nother scholars of comparative religion and anthropologists\ndefend the position that it is not justified to compare religion\ncross-culturally on the basis of a set of characteristics that\nproposed solution is to define religion in the sense of\nWittgenstein's concept of family resemblances by a number\nof characteristics and to designate cultural action and symbol\nsystems as religious if several but not necessarily all defining\nThe operationalization of religiosity\nin three cross-national comparative\nsurveys\nThe methodology of cross-national comparative survey\nresearch was developed in Europe and in the United States.\nThe European Values Study (EVS) was the first project to\nestablish this method in the form of a permanent research\ncooperation. The first wave of EVS was carried out in 10\nEuropean countries, the United States, and Canada in 1981\u00ad\n1982. Since that time, numerous countries from all conti-\nnents joined this project. Due to the increasing cultural\ndiversity of the participating countries, it became more and\nmore difficult to develop questionnaires that were adequate\nfor all cultural areas. Thus, in the third wave of the program,\nthere was a split between the EVS with around 40 participat-\ning countries and the WVS with 50 member countries. Also,\nthe initiative for the ISSP emerged from a few highly devel-\noped Western countries. In the meantime, 25 European and a\nsimilar number of non-European countries participate in this\nproject.\nSince only Western countries were involved in cross-\nnational research in the initial period, the investigation of\nreligion had a clear focus on the Christian religion. In the first\nwave of EVS, the central indicators for measuring religiosity\nwere church attendance and prayer, as well as belief in God,\nheaven, hell, devil, and sin. The only item that went beyond\nthe monotheistic horizon was belief in reincarnation. In the\nfirst ISSP module on religion (carried out in 1991), religion\nhas been studied with similar indicators. Some items, in par-\nticular the questions about \"born-again experiences,\" are\nclearly tailored to the religious culture of the United States;\noutside this cultural area, these questions are difficult to\nunderstand and of little relevance. Another study which\nexamines religion in cross-national comparative perspective\nis the RM. This survey was carried out twice (2008 and\nH\u00f6llinger and Eder 5\nindividual religiousness more systematically than the afore-\nmentioned surveys using a scale that comprises the five\ndimensions of religion according to Charles Glock: belief,\nparticipation in community rituals, individual devotion,\nknowledge, and experience. In addition, this research instru-\nment distinguishes \"theistic\" and \"pantheistic\" (or non-theis-\ntic) religiosity. For the theistic type of religion, individual\ndevotion is measured by the frequency of prayer and for the\npantheistic type by the frequency of meditation. In the same\nway, the questionnaire includes items on theistic experience\n(\"feeling that God intervenes in your life\") and pantheistic\nexperience (\"feeling to be one with all\"). The five dimen-\nsions (sub-scales) were combined to a single scale which\nclaims to measure the \"centrality of religion\" for respondents\nfrom different religious backgrounds (monotheistic or poly-\nIn the following, we will investigate the methodological\nchallenges of the cross-national comparative study of reli-\ngion using the example of the ISSP, WVS, and RM. In the\nfirst step, we deal with the problem of item equivalence.\nQuestion formulation and item\nequivalence\nReligious affiliation\nThe problem of functional equivalence arises already for the\nquestion of religious affiliation. In some countries, religious\naffiliation is determined by institutional membership, and in\nothers, it is not. In East Asia, but also in Africa and Latin\nAmerica, many people have multiple religious identities, that\nis, they take part in the rituals of several religions (Gentz,\nreligious affiliation has to be reworded in correspondence\nwith the situation of the respective country. WVS and ISSP\nhave opted for different question formats. In the English\nmaster version of the WVS, the question is, \"Do you belong\nto a religion or religious denomination? If yes, which one?\"\nIn the ISSP, \"What is your religious preference?\" In Russia,\nthese items are translated as \"Do you confess a religion? If\nyes, which one?\" (WVS) and \"Do you follow a religion? If\nyes, which one?\" (ISSP). For Japanese respondents, the term\n\"religious affiliation\" is not meaningful; thus, the question\nwas reworded to \"Do you actually practice a religion? If yes,\nplease tick only one category from the following list.\" This\nnote was added because many Japanese participate in rituals\nof more than one religion. From this first example, it gets\nobvious how Western standards are translated into non-West-\nern contexts in order to fulfill comparability.\nTable 1 shows the results from the question of religious\naffiliation in the three surveys. In Turkey, Thailand, Japan,\nand Spain, the three (or two) surveys give rather similar dis-\ntributions. In Russia, the United States, and Taiwan, the\nquestion format of the WVS--\"Do you belong to a religious\ndenomination? If yes, which one?\"--leads to significantly\nhigher proportions of respondents who assign themselves to\nthe category \"no religion\" than the direct question \"Which is\nyour religious preference?\" of ISSP and RM. Both in the\nWVS and in the ISSP, more than half of the Japanese\nrespondents attributed themselves as religious none.\nApparently, only respondents who have a stronger affinity to\nBuddhism or to one of the new Japanese religions (like Soka\nGakai) assign themselves as religious affiliates, while the\npractice of the popular Shintoist rituals is not associated with\nthe term \"religion.\" Another explanation for the high propor-\ntion of non-religious in Japan could be that respondents with\nmultiple religious identities are reluctant to assign them-\nselves to only one religion.\nIndicators of individual religiousness\nIn most surveys on religion, the frequency of attending reli-\ngious services and frequency of praying are the central indi-\ncators of religious practice. In cross-national comparative\nperspective, it is problematical, however, to measure the\ndegree of religiosity with these indicators. Only in the three\nAbrahamic religions are believers expected to attend reli-\ngious services on a weekly basis. And even here, there are\ndifferences: In one part of the Muslim world, it is common\nthat only men participate in the communal Friday mosque\nprayer, while women pray at home. Therefore, in the Turkish\nISSP, women were not asked about participation in mosque\nprayer, but whether they carry out Friday prayer (Salt). In\nthe WVS, both men and women were asked about participa-\ntion in the mosque prayer. This is evidently the reason why\nthe proportion of regular worshipers is almost twice as high\nin the Turkish ISSP as in the WVS (see Table 2). In the\nEastern Asian religions, there is no equivalent to the mono-\ntheistic tradition of regular (weekly) community service.\nReligious celebrations in the temple are held only on holi-\ndays; otherwise, there are rituals at a private shrine in one's\nhome and individual temple visits. Therefore, in Japan, the\nitem on attending religious services was adapted to \"visit to\na temple or Shinto-shrine\" in the WVS and \"visit to a place\nof prayer and devotion\" in the ISSP. In Taiwan, both surveys\nasked about \"participation in religious activities.\" The large\ndifferences between the results of WVS and ISSP for Taiwan\nmay be due to the fact that respondents have a different\nunderstanding of what a religious activity is.\nAlso in regard to the frequency of prayer, we find consider-\nable differences between the three surveys for several coun-\ntries.These differences may be due to not only different formats\nof response categories but also different question formulations.\nThus, the higher frequency of prayer in the Taiwanese WVS in\ncomparison with ISSP may be due to the fact that the WVS\nquestion was formulated \"How often do you pray or light\nincense?\" was formulated, whereas the ISSP asked only for\nprayer. This example demonstrates that the scope of the\nconcept \"prayer\" is not clearly determined in cross-national\ncomparative perspective and that, therefore, the results are not\n6 Methodological Innovations\nfully comparable. The RM also asked about meditation; this\nquestion, however, provides curious results which are probably\ndue to the fact that the concept of meditation has different con-\nnotations in the countries in comparison and/or that the item\nformulations differed between countries (the RM does not\nprovide a documentation of the question wordings in the par-\nticipating countries).\nISSP and the RM included some additional questions in\norder to get a more differentiated picture of the importance of\nreligion in the lives of respondents. In the ISSP, respondents\nwere asked whether they have an altar or religious objects\n(such as a cross or an icon) in their home. In the RM, Hindus,\nBuddhists, Taoists, and affiliates of other Eastern Asian reli-\ngions were asked whether they have a shrine in their home.\nResults show that this is much more frequently the case\nin Eastern Asian countries and Orthodox Russia than in\nProtestant and Catholic countries and indicate that religion is\nprobably more important for the people in the former coun-\ntries than one would assume if one considers only the fre-\nquency of prayer and participation in religious service. In all\nthree surveys, respondents were, moreover, asked to give a\nself-assessment of their religiousness. As the surveys had\ndifferent numbers of response categories, the results are not\nfully comparable. It is striking, however, that differences\nbetween the studies are exceedingly high in Taiwan and\nThailand. This finding, again, indicates that the meaning of\n\"being religious\" fundamentally differs between Western\nand Eastern Asian societies.\nTable 3 gives an overview of religious beliefs in the\nselected countries. Although belief in God was determined\nwith different response categories, the three surveys produce\nquite similar results with the only exception of Thailand. The\nRM also asked for belief in angels and demons. In these\nquestions, the differences between countries are much greater\nthan for belief in God; the same applies to belief in hell.\nTherefore, if one wants to compare the degree of disenchant-\nment across different societies, it makes sense to consider not\nonly the belief in God but also other religious beliefs.\nIn ISSP2008, efforts have been made to also consider beliefs\nthat are particularly relevant for Asian religions. Respondents\nwere asked whether they believe in reincarnation, Nirvana, and\nsupernatural powers of deceased ancestors. The proportion of\npersons who believe in these ideas is in fact much larger in\nTaiwan and Japan than in Western countries. However, South\nKoreans do not believe more frequently in these ideas than\nRussians and Americans and thus deviate from the Asian pat-\ntern. The surprisingly high level of belief in reincarnation and\nNirvana in Turkey seems to be an artifact, due to a translation\nthat evokes associations with Muslim religious beliefs. It may\nbe the case also that Christians who indicate belief in reincarna-\ntion associate it with Christian rebirth rather than the Indian\nconcept of reincarnation. A high proportion--20\u00ad50%--of\nrespondents in the four Christian countries, Turkey, and Japan\n\"don't know\" if they believe in Nirvana. In all, 30% of the\nRussian and 25% of the Japanese respondents were also unable\nto say whether they believe in reincarnation and supranatural\nSpain Germany Russia United States\n Turkey South Korea Thailand Taiwan Japan \nISSP: International Social Survey Program; WVS: World Values Survey; RM: Religion Monitor.\nRounded values; categories with values <0.5% and other religions were omitted from the table.\nH\u00f6llinger and Eder 7\npower of ancestors. In view of these results, the criterion of item\nequivalence is not fulfilled sufficiently for some questions.\nIn the RM, the aspect of religious experience was also\nconsidered by the question, \"How often do you experience\nsituations in which you have the feeling that God or some-\nthing divine intervenes in your life?\" The results of this ques-\ntion are highly correlated with belief in God both on the\nindividual level (r=0.64 for the combined dataset) and on the\naggregate level of countries (r=0.91). For non-theistic reli-\ngious experience, the equivalent question was, \"How often\ndo you have the feeling that you are in one with all?\" Since\nthe concept of \"all-experience\" is associated in particular\nwith the mystical religious traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism,\nand Daoism, one should assume that such experiences occur\nmore frequently in Eastern Asian than in Western countries.\nHowever, this is not reflected in the survey results: In Turkey,\nSpain, and the United States, the proportion of respondents\nwho indicate that they have had \"all-experiences\" is higher\nthan in Thailand and South Korea. Thus, it has to be assumed\nthat the formulation \"feeling to be one with all\" was either\ntranslated differently or that it does not transmit the intended\nnotion of \"mystical experience\" to all respondents.\nStructural equivalence of religiousness\nIn quantitative research on religion, the strength of individual\nreligiousness is commonly measured by scales that consider\nitems on religious belief (faith) and religious practice. For\nmonotheistic religions, the most important indicators in this\nregard are belief in God, frequency of prayer, and frequency of\nattendance of religious services. Prayer, participation in reli-\ngious rituals, and belief in some kind of divine power are also\nrelevant for the East Asian religions. However, a scale that\nconsiders only these indicators may underestimate the impor-\ntance of religion in EastAsian countries. Thus, in the following,\nwe will compare our sample of countries in regard to two scales:\nThe first scale is composed of the three items mentioned\nabove--belief in God, prayer, and attendance of religious\nservice--and will be called (intensity of) \"religiosity.\" The\nsecond scale includes belief in reincarnation, belief in Nirvana,\nand ancestor belief and will be called \"eastern beliefs.\"\nIn the first step, we use CFA to examine whether this list\nof items meets the criteria of structural equivalence for our\nsample of countries. We hypothesize that the six items form\ntwo distinct factors. Furthermore, we expect the two factors\nto be correlated with each other. This correlation should be\nhigher in East Asian countries because here eastern beliefs\nshould go together with religious practice (measured by\nthe religiosity factor). In Western countries, the correlation\nshould be lower because here for a part of the population\neastern beliefs (and practices, such as Yoga or Tai Chi) repre-\nsent an alternative to theistic religiosity (see Figure 1).\nTable 4 presents the findings of the CFAs for four\ncountries which exhibit different patterns of results (for the\nremaining countries, the analysis produces similar patterns\nof results2). Consistent with our hypothesis, a two-factor\nsolution fits the data significantly better than a one-factor\nTable 2.

The fit measures RMSEA and CFI indicate that the\ndata have an acceptable fit in four countries: Spain, Germany,\nTaiwan, and Japan. Consistent with our hypothesis, the cor-\nrelation between the two factors is higher in the two Eastern\nAsian countries than in Spain and Germany. For the United\nStates and South Korea, the fit coefficients are at the border-\nfor CFI). In the United States and South Korea, religiosity\nand eastern beliefs are practically uncorrelated (in the\nUnited States, the correlation is even slightly negative). For\nTurkey, the fit coefficients are below an acceptable level.\nThis is in part due to the small variance of the \"belief in\nGod\" variable (95% of the respondents believe in God; see\nTable 3). Corresponding to the results of CFA, the reliability\ntest on the basis of Cronbach's alpha proves high internal\nconsistencies of the two religiousness scales with the excep-\ntion of Turkey.\nIn the bottom part of Table 4, we also present the correla-\ntion between subjective religiosity (\"Would you describe\nyourself as a religious person?\") and the two scales. One can\nsee that considering oneself a religious person is much more\nstrongly associated with belief in God, prayer, and attend-\nance of religious services than with eastern beliefs. This is\nthe case in particular in the Christian countries Spain,\nGermany, and the United States, but also in South Korea. In\nthe East Asian countries Japan and Taiwan, the difference is\nless pronounced, but even here religiousness is more strongly\nassociated with the Western concept of religion than with the\ncharacteristic beliefs of Eastern Asia.\nComparison of religiousness scales\nfrom ISSP, WVS, and RM\nIn the following, we will compare the degree of religiosity in\nour sample of countries according to the mean scores on the\nreligiosity scale and the eastern belief scale described above.\nIn addition, we will compare the results of the ISSP reli-\ngiousness scale with two religiousness scales derived from\nthe WVS and RM, in order to examine to what extent scales\nthat claim to measure the same construct in fact produce\nsimilar results when applied to different countries. The\nWVS-religiousness scale is composed of the same three\nitems as the ISSP religiousness scale, belief in God, fre-\nquency of prayer, and frequency of attendance religious\nTable 3.

For the RM, we use the \"centrality of reli-\ngion\" scale developed by Stefan Huber which is based on\nCharles Glock's dimensional model of religion and claims to\nmeasure the centrality of religion in people's life in a compa-\nrable way across different religious cultures. For this pur-\npose, some of the indicators are formulated in a \"theistic\"\nand in a \"pantheistic\" version; for those indicators that are\nrepresented by two parallel items, the higher of two values is\nused for the calculation of the scale score of a person (Huber,\nis composed of five items, each representing one dimension\nof religiousness: belief in God or something divine (belief\ndimension), frequency of participation in a public religious\nritual (public practice), (maximum value of) frequency of\nprayer or frequency of meditation (private practice), fre-\nquency of thinking about religion (cognitive dimension), and\n(maximum value of) frequency of \"having the feeling that\nGod intervenes in one's life\" or \"having the feeling to be one\nwith all\" (experience dimension).\nThe results presented in Figure 2 correspond to the propor-\ntion of respondents in the single countries who have scores\nabove the scale median of the combined dataset. In the follow-\ning, these persons will be referred to as religious. The findings\ncan be summarized as follows: For seven of the nine countries,\nGermany, the United States, Turkey, South Korea, Thailand,\nTaiwan, and Japan, the two religiousness scales derived from\nthe ISSP and the WVS and the centrality of religion scale from\nthe RM give rather similar results (differences amount to less\nthan 10%). For Spain and Russia, the differences are some-\nwhat larger: According to the ISSP scale, 48% of the Spanish\nrespondents are religious; according to the WVS scale, only\n35% are religious. For Russia, the discrepancies between the\nthree studies are larger: Here, the \"centrality of religion\" scale\nof the RM determines a clearly lower proportion of religious\nrespondents (23%) than the religiousness scales of ISSP(35%)\nand WVS (48%). The plausibility of these results can be\nchecked by considering other religiousness indicators reported\nearlier in this article. Tables 2 and 3 show that the proportion\nof persons consider themselves as religious, as well as the pro-\nportion of those who believe in angels, demons, and hell is\nsomewhat higher in Russia than in Germany and Spain. Thus,\nthe results of the religion scales of ISSP and WVS for Russia\nseem to be more plausible than the result of the \"centrality of\nreligion\" scale of the RM.\nAccording to the assumptions of comparative religious\nstudies, one should expect that belief in reincarnation,\nNirvana, and spiritual presence of ancestors is more wide-\nspread in East Asian countries than in monotheistic cultures.\nThis assumption is only partly confirmed by the ISSP data.\nJapan and Thailand, two countries that are shaped by Taoist\nand Buddhist traditions, in fact have clearly higher scores on\nthe eastern belief scale than the Christian countries Spain,\nGermany, Russia, and the United States. Turkey, however,\nhas the highest mean score on this scale among all countries,\nand the score for South Korea is similar to that of the United\nStates and Russia. It has to be assumed that these discrepan-\ncies are primarily due to measurement errors, the formula-\ntion of items, and different understanding of the meaning of\nthese concepts in the participating countries.\nIn Japan and Taiwan, the country mean scores on the\neastern belief scale are significantly higher than the scores\nTable 4.

This finding suggests that the\nlevel of religiosity in Eastern Asian countries is underesti-\nmated when the measurement of religiosity is based only on\nindicators that are particularly characteristic of monotheis-\ntic cultures (belief in God, regular attendance of commu-\nnity rituals, and regular prayer). Also, Thailand has\nrelatively low scores on the religiousness scale, similar to\nthe scores in the highly secularized European countries of\nGermany and Spain. The validity of this result is question-\nable: Country reports and qualitative studies on the reli-\ngious culture of Thailand show that Thai religion is\ncharacterized by the strong presence of a syncretism of\nBuddhist and indigenous shamanic traditions (Kittiarsa,\nRM who indicated to own a private shrine (see Table 3) cor-\nresponds to this image. It seems that the religiousness\nscales of WVS and RM do not capture this aspect of reli-\ngiousness sufficiently. (The eastern belief items were not\nasked in these studies; presumably, Thailand would have\nsimilarly high scores on this scale than Japan and Taiwan.)\nSouth Korea has relatively low mean scores both on the\nreligiousness scale and on the eastern belief scale. In view of\nthe dynamic process of economic modernization, it seems\nplausible that this country has undergone a similarly strong\nprocess of secularization as the highly developed Western\ncountries. However, there exists a caveat against such an\ninterpretation: During the last decades, a considerable pro-\nportion (around 40%) of South Koreans have converted to\nChristianity. According to a report of the Pew Forum, a con-\nsiderable part of the Christians in South Korea belong to\nPentecostal or charismatic churches.3 A number of scholars\nargue that such forms of ecstatic religiousness can prosper\nonly in societies where they are nourished by autochthonous\nspiritualist traditions. This is definitely the case for South\none should assume that also in South Korea, a certain type of\nreligiousness has not been captured with the survey scales.\nConclusion and outlook\nIn this article, we investigated the measurement of religious-\nness in three cross-national comparative surveys, the ISSP,\nWVS, and RM. In the first step, we demonstrated that the\nchallenge of functional equivalence starts with the formula-\ntion of apparently simple questions, such as the question of\nreligious affiliation. The comparison of the self-assessment\nof religious affiliation in the three surveys shows that in\nsome countries the results depend to a considerable extent on\nthe details of the formulation of the question. For Japan,\nTaiwan, and Russia, we found large differences between the\nresults of the surveys which seem to be due to the ambiguity\nof the concept of religious affiliation in East Asian countries\nand the culture-specific degree of social desirability of reli-\ngious self-declaration.Also in regard to the core indicators of\nreligiousness, attendance of religious service, prayer, and\nbelief in God, the three surveys exhibit different results for a\npart of the countries. Here, it is difficult to decide whether\nthe discrepancies are due to differences in the formulation of\nthe question and the number and formulation of answer cat-\negories or differences in the sampling and fieldwork proce-\ndures. This problem is also due to insufficient documentation\nof questionnaire translations.\nIn the core section of this article, we have shown by\nsingle-country CFAs for a set of variables taken from ISSP\nFigure 2. Comparison of four religiousness scales (% of the population with values above the scale median of the combined country\ndataset).\nRM 2009: Centrality of religion: Likert scale: Frequency of attending religious ritual+maximum of frequency of prayer or frequency of meditation+thinking\nof religion+belief in God+maximum of experience of divine intervention or feeling to be one with all. WVS 2010\u00ad2014: Religiosity: Likert scale: belief in\nGod+attendance of religious service+prayer. ISSP 2008: Religiosity: Likert scale: belief in God+attendance of religious service+prayer. ISSP 2008: Eastern\nreligious beliefs: Likert scale: belief in reincarnation+belief in Nirvana+ancestor belief.\nH\u00f6llinger and Eder 11\n2008 that a two-factor solution that distinguishes \"religious-\nness\" and \"eastern beliefs\" fits the data significantly better\nthan a one-factor solution. These scales also have a high\ninternal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for all countries\nexcept for Turkey. The analysis also indicates that the subjec-\ntive concept of \"being religious\" is more strongly associated\nwith the Western concept of religiousness (belief in God,\nattending religious service, and praying) than with eastern\nreligious beliefs, not only in Western but also in Eastern\ncountries. The RM has tried to overcome the problem of\nmeasuring religion across different culture areas by means of\na scale that includes theistic and pantheistic (or non-theistic)\nforms of religiosity. However, this methodology yielded\ndoubtful results in some respects: Thus, for example, the pro-\nportion of respondents considered as religious in the panthe-\nistic sense (i.e. persons who meditate and experience to be\n\"one with all\") according to this scale is clearly higher in the\nUnited States and Spain than in Thailand and South Korea.\nSummarizing our findings, we can say that the paradigm\nof cross-national comparative survey research of \"asking the\nsame questions\" is difficult to apply and problematic with\nrespect to the topic of religiosity. Also, the idea of comparing\nthe level of religiousness of countries belonging to different\nculture areas by a single scale that is supposed to include all\ndimensions of religiosity falls short. Our finding that the\nconcept of \"being religious\" is much more strongly associ-\nated with theistic (Western) forms of religion than with\nEastern religious beliefs both in Western and in Eastern\ncountries confirms Fitzgerald's assertion that non-Western\nsocieties have adopted the Western concept of religion\n(Fitzgerald, 2000) and do not include traditional beliefs and\nrituals of their own culture into this concept. From this, it\nfollows that questionnaires which are based on the Western\nconcept of religion will lead to biased results when applied to\nworldwide cross-cultural comparison. The participation of\nscientists from different cultural contexts in the process of\nquestionnaire construction is an essential strategy to prevent\nsuch biases. However, this procedure also cannot guarantee\ncross-cultural content validity. For a deeper understanding of\ncomparative survey results, it is also highly important to con-\nsider the countries not only as variables but to interpret and\nquestion the findings on the basis of a profound knowledge\nof their culture and history.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
