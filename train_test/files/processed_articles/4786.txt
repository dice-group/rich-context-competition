    "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most deadly subtype of leukemia, and many patients with this disease seek\nother complementary therapies, one of which is Chinese medicine. We set out to provide reliable data regarding the\nbenefit of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for AML patients, using mortality as the main outcome measure. We also\ncharacterized the herbal prescriptions of patients. Methods. Using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research\nDatabase, we performed a nationwide population-based cohort study among AML patients from 1997 to 2010. The Cox\nregression model was used to adjust for comorbidities and other variables, and the hazard ratios (HRs) of CHM users and\nnon\u00adCHM users were compared. Results. After 1:1 matching, 498 patients were included into the study. The HR of the\nshown to be dose dependent (P < .001). The 3 single-herbs most commonly prescribed were Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen),\nAstragalus membranaceus (Huang Qi), and Spatholobus suberectus (Ji Xue Teng). The 3 mutli-herb products most commonly\nprescribed were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Gui Pi Tang, and Qi Ju Di Huang Wan. Conclusion. Prospective controlled clinical\ndata is still needed, however, this study provides real-world data regarding the benefit AML patients may have from CHM.\nThis study suggests that all AML patients, regardless of age or other prognostic factors, may achieve longer survival times\nwhen receiving CHM in addition to standard therapy.\n",

Consequently, there is little interest among\nresearchers to challenge CM in a clinical setting, and the\nsparse material available regarding CM in the context of\nAML consists of basic cell-line experiments.11,12 A system-\nChinese clinical trials using CM for cancer. Many of these\ndid not use international standards such as CONSORT or\nTREND and were not peer reviewed, rendering the few\nstudies that might relate to leukemia and AML dubious.13\nThis, in turn, creates a situation where primary caretakers\nare unable to provide educated advice to the patients seek-\ning further complementary therapies.\nFortunately, real-world data are available on this topic.\nAccording to past data from Taiwan, for example, where\nCM is available as part of the National Health Insurance\nlized CM services.14 This is a substantial amount of data\nconsidering that 99% of Taiwanese are covered by the\nNHI.15 The NHI recognizes 3 major modalities of CM treat-\nment: (1) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) products, which\ncome in the form of single-herb or multiherb products; (2)\nacupuncture, which also encompasses moxibustion and\ncupping; and (3) manual therapy, including acupressure,\nTuina, and chiropractic.16 Since some of these modalities\nare harder to accurately reproduce than others, in this study\nwe chose to focus on CHM.\nAll treatments reimbursed as part of the NHI are regis-\ntered in the Taiwanese NHI Research Database (NHIRD).\nThis dataset provides a nationwide population-based claims\ndatabase with long-term follow-up, thus reducing the poten-\ntial for sampling bias. We have previously investigated the\nuse of CHM therapy in diseases such as chronic myeloid leu-\nand peptic ulcer disease.21 In the current study, we sought to\nprovide insight into the potential of integration of CHM ther-\napy for patients withAML, through a nationwide population-\nbased retrospective cohort study, comparing CHM users and\nnonusers, using mortality as the outcome measure.\nMethods\nDatabase\nThe NHIRD contains information regarding each clinical\nvisit and hospitalization incident of all its beneficiaries as\nwell as treatment received and drugs or CHM prescribed.\nAll diseases in the NHIRD are classified using the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). In this study, we made\nuse of the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients file for\ncollection of data. This file is linked to all inpatient and out-\npatient claims for catastrophic illness patients. This file\nincluded all available NHI records of AML patients in\nTaiwan as well as all the treatments reimbursed for both\nstandard and CM therapies. For an AML patient to be regis-\ntered in this file, their diagnosis must be reviewed by a\nlicensed hematologist or oncologist, ensuring the confirmation\nof disease. After identifying patients through this data set we\nsearched these patients' corresponding information, including\ncomorbidities, in the NHIRD inpatient and outpatient files. It is\nimportant to note that only treatments administered by trained\nand licensed CM physicians are recorded in the NHIRD.\nStudy Population\nAll patients 18 years old and above, diagnosed with AML\n2010, were included. End of follow-up time was defined as\nto age, sex, and index year.\nIn this study, we excluded patients who had not received\nany form of standard therapy. During this process of exclu-\nsion, we discovered that many patients had begun a course\nof treatment prior to their AML diagnosis being entered into\nthe NHIRD. We, therefore, also included any patient who\nhad received C/T or radiotherapy within 6 months prior to\ntheir formal AML diagnosis.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn this study, SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was\nused for statistical analysis of all information retrieved from\nthe NHIRD. The statistical differences between the two\ngroups were determined through the 2 or Fisher exact test\nfor categorical variables, and the independent t test was\nused for continuous variables. Exploratory analyses of haz-\nard ratios (HRs) were performed through a Cox propor-\ntional hazard model, taking into account age, gender,\nurbanization level, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI),\nwith a 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used\nfor categorical covariates. Only P values <.05 were consid-\nered statistically significant.\nEthical Considerations\nThis study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki\nDeclaration guidelines. The data sets obtained from the\nNHIRD were encrypted and deidentified for the protection\nof patient privacy, and the identification of individuals was\nimpossible by any means. The Research Ethics Committee\nof China Medical University and Hospital approved this\nResults\nA total of 4825 patients were diagnosed with AML within\nmeet the study's inclusion criteria, 2757 patients remained.\nThese patients were grouped according to a cut-point of a\nminimal 30 days of accumulated use of CHM. In our initial\nresults, the non-CHM group contained significantly more\npatients older than 60 years. Because the majority of\npatients older than 65 years do not receive C/T in Taiwan,\nthis posed a substantial risk for statistical a artifact. We\nwere, thus, obliged to randomly match the patients by age\n(by 5-year intervals) at the cost of sample size. In addition,\nboth groups were matched according to sex and index year,\nresulting in 249 patients in both the CHM group and the\nnon-CHM group (Figure 1).\nCharacteristics of patients in both groups can be seen in\nTable 1. The frequency of women was higher in the two\ngroups (56%). The mean age of patients was 46 years, with\nyears. The NHIRD records the urbanization level of the\nlocation where treatment occurred. As the level of urbaniza-\ntion may correlate with socioeconomic status, adding this\nitem bears meaning, and no statistical difference (P < .05)\nwas found to exist between the CHM and non-CHM groups\nin this respect. Also, no statistical differences were found\nbetween the two groups in terms of type of treatment\nreceived (radiotherapy, C/T, or stem cell transplant) and CCI\nscore, which has been shown to be related to survival time in\nyears for the non-CHM and CHM groups, respectively.\nTable 2 presents the related HR of the items listed in\nTable 1, as determined through a Cox proportional hazard\nmodel. After adjusting for age, gender, urbanization level,\nCCI, and treatment received, the HR of morbidity in the\npared with that of the non-CHM group. An additional factor\nthat may influence the efficacy of CHM is the delay between\nthe time of diagnosis and initiation of CHM treatment,\ndefined by some as \"lag time to treatment.\" The lag time to\ntreatment may differ from patient to patient, and its influ-\nence on the improvement of prognosis has been discussed in\nprevious studies.23 We, therefore, took lag time to CHM\ntreatment into account in Table 2, and the adjusted HR was\nin the NHIRD we were able to track the cumulative days of\nCHM administered to patients, and thus in Table 3, we\ninvestigated a further aspect of reduction in HR. It is shown\nthat patients who took CHM for 30 to 89 days had a HR of\nfrom the non-CHM group; patients who took CHM for 90 to\nand patients who took CHM for more than 180 days had a\nanalyzed the average time from AML diagnosis to com-\nmencement of CHM treatment.

This is also illustrated in\nThe longer survival time of the CHM group can be seen\nin 2 Kaplan-Meier plots. Figure 3 illustrates the difference\nin survival time between the two groups, with the CHM\ngroup displaying superior outcomes (P < .0001). Figure 4\nstratifies the groups according to patient age. It is clear that\neach age subgroup from the CHM group achieved longer\nsurvival time compared with the respective non-CHM sub-\nFigure 1. Study population flowchart diagram. Of the total\nnumber of AML patients registered in the NHIRD (n = 5955),\nthe exclusion process, as well as matching 1:1 by age, sex, and\nindex year, both groups contained 249 patients.\nAbbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CHM, Chinese herbal\nmedicine; NHIRD, National Health Insurance Research Database.\nCHM is available to all patients of the NHI as concen-\ntrated granulated powders manufactured by pharmaceuti-\ncal companies with GMP certification, which ensures the\nquality and consistency of product batches. Single-herb\nproducts are produced by extracting 1 single substance,\nwhereas multiherb products are formulae composed of\nseveral single herbs. In Table 4, we analyze the HR of the\n10 single- and multiherb products most commonly pre-\nscribed. All were found to be statistically significant (P <\n.001). The 3 single-herb products most commonly pre-\nscribed were Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen), Astragalus\nmembranaceus (Huang Qi), and Spatholobus suberectus\n(Ji Xue Teng). The 3 most commonly prescribed multiherb\nproducts were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Gui Pi Tang, and Qi\nJu Di Huang Wan.\nDiscussion\nWhether one is a proponent of CM or not, there is no ignor-\ning the fact that patients, including cancer patients, seek\nthese treatments when faced with health issues. A small\nCanadian cohort study showed that among breast cancer\npatients, the use of CM had doubled between 1998 and\nwhereas in Germany, a study from 2007 reported that\namong 1030 patients with gynecological and breast malig-\nthe statistics are among leukemia patients because no stud-\nies have been conducted. Nevertheless, the above data dem-\nonstrate that although we should eventually strive for\nevidence ranked high on the evidence-based medicine\nTable 1.

Patients\nfrom the CHM group had a 49% lower HR than that of the\nnon-CHM group. Moreover, it was shown that patients\nwho took CHM for longer periods of time experienced a\nmore substantial decrease in HR. Certain influences, such\nas motivation of patients, cannot be ruled out in this type\nof retrospective study; however, this dose-dependence\nsupports the possibility of a causal relationship between\nthe two.\nIn the past, there have also been conflicting reports as to\nwhether or not the so-called lag time to treatment predicts\noutcome in certain populations in AML.27,28 To test the pos-\nsibility that decrease in HR was a result of this phenomenon\nand not a result of dose dependence, we analyzed the\nmedian lag time to treatment of each one of the subgroups\nin Table 3. We found that all 3 groups commenced CHM\ntreatment roughly 7 months following AML diagnosis, and\nthis did not seem to be a significant factor.\nThere are different types of factors that may lead to\nfavorable or unfavorable outcomes in AML, most signifi-\ncant of which are various molecular mutations. A recent\nstudy performed in Taiwan showed that out of 378 AML\ndiagnosed with unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities,\nand 13.2% presented positive ones.29 Yet one of the most\nsubstantial prognostic factors, associated with poor survival\nin AML, is the genetic mutation of Fms-like tyrosine kinase\npossess mutated FLT3 and receive a target therapy named\nsorafenib, which induces growth arrest and apoptosis of\ncells fostering this mutation.32 However, cytogenetic abnor-\nmalities, such as the favorable t(8;21) or the unfavorable\n11q23 and the FLT3 gene mutation mentioned above, all go\nunregistered in the NHIRD, and we were, therefore, unable\nto conclusively rule out the influence of these on our results.\nWe sought to address the lack of FTL3 status of patients in\nthe NHIRD and adjusted our data for the use of sorafenib.\nUnfortunately, only in recent years has it become standard to\nprescribe this drug to FLT3-positive patients in Taiwan, and\nTable 3.

Despite the\nlack of these data, we did manage to challenge the notion that\nthe improvement in HR of the CHM group was a result of sam-\npling bias. In many cases of high-risk or refractory AML,\npatients opted for HSCT. HSCT patients accounted for roughly\n10% of the cohort and were evenly distributed among the two\ngroups. Moreover, HSCT patients from the CHM group had a\n38% lower HR compared with HSCT patients who did not\nreceive CHM (P = .04). This suggests that not only were high-\nrisk patients evenly distributed between the two groups, but\nalso that they might benefit from CHM treatment.\nAn additional important aspect of our results is shown in\nFigure 4. Not only does the incidence of AML increase with\nage, but the latter is also an important prognostic factor.33\nOne population-based study from Sweden stratified more\nthan 2700 AML patients according to 5-year age groups and\nshowed a near perfect correlation between this stratification\nand survival time.34 In the Kaplan-Meier curve presented in\nFigure 3, we performed a similar stratification according to\nage and discovered that in this Taiwanese cohort, there was\nalso a strong correlation between age and survival time.\nCorrespondingly, there was a proportional improvement of\nsurvival time for patients in the CHM group over the non-\nCHM group. This finding once again challenges the notion\nthat improvement of HR was due to an uneven distribution\nFigure 3. Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in patients\nwith acute myeloid leukemia according to Chinese herbal\nmedicine (CHM) use. The curves have been adjusted according\nto the median lag time to treatment (213 days), as described in\nFigure 4. Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival in patients\nwith acute myeloid leukemia according to Chinese herbal\nmedicine (CHM) use, stratified by age group. The curves have\nbeen adjusted according to the median lag time to treatment\nFigure 2. Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival of patients\naccording to length of consumption of Chinese herbal medicine\nadjusted according to the median lag time to treatment (213\ndays), as described in Table 3.\nof low-risk and high-risk patients among the two groups. It\nis known that the incidence of AML with favorable cytoge-\nnetic abnormalities decreases with age.35,36 Following this\nrationale, if improvement in HR was a result of favorable\nprognostic factors, and not CHM, plot trends would have\nappeared differently in Figure 4.\nAn investigation of the specific role played by the sin-\ngle- and multiherb preparations presented in the results is\nbeyond the scope of this study. These were presented for 2\nmain reasons: (1) to summarize the collective experience of\nTaiwanese CM physicians and provide other CHM practi-\ntioners a reference point and (2) in hopes that future\nresearch, whether it be basic or clinical, may use these find-\nings to assert a causal relation and therapeutic mechanism.\nConclusion\nIt is a reasonable assumption that a portion of AML patients\nseek complementary forms of therapies following their\ndiagnosis. Although this study cannot replace a controlled\nclinical trial or prove a causal relation, it strongly suggests\nthat adjunctive CHM therapy may benefit AML patients of\nall ages, including those with poor prognosis. We are unable\nto infer whether this is a direct result of the CHM consumed,\na synergistic effect with standard agents, or even just a\nresult of the former reducing the adverse effect of the latter\nand consequently leading to more successful treatments.\nWe hope that this study may serve as a foundation for fur-\nther future research. The quality of life and safety outcomes\nshould also be included in future studies.\n"
