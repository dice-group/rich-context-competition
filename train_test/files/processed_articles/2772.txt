One\naspect of social justice involves the differential treatment of demographic groups in the crim-\ninal justice system. While data consistently show that Blacks and Hispanics are often\ntreated differently than Whites, one understudied aspect of these disparities is how police\nofficers' assessments of suspects' size affects their decisions. Using over 3 million cases\nfrom the New York Police Department (NYPD) Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) Database,\n2006\u00ad2013, this study is the first to explore suspects' race, perceived size, and police treat-\nment. Results indicate that tall and heavy black and Hispanic men are at the greatest risk\nfor frisk or search. Tall and heavy suspects are at increased risk for experiencing police\nforce, with black and Hispanic men being more likely to experience force than white men\nacross size categories.\n",

This case, along with the fatal shooting of unarmed\nblack teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson MO on August 9th, 2014, has drawn public aware-\nness to issues surrounding racial profiling and excessive use of police force. There have been\nseveral other recent cases in which unarmed black men have been killed by the police [2,3]\nincluding: Dante Parker, who died after being stunned by a Taser gun multiple times by police\nin Victorville, CA on August 12th, 2014; Walter Scott, who video footage [4] shows was shot\nmultiple times while running from an officer in North Charleston, SC on April 4th, 2015; and\nCitation: Milner AN, George BJ, Allison DB (2016)\nBlack and Hispanic Men Perceived to Be Large Are\nat Increased Risk for Police Frisk, Search, and Force.\nEditor: Brion Maher, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, UNITED STATES\nCopyright: \u00a9 2016 Milner et al.

A recent report [6] shows that black males are 21 times more likely than\ntheir white counterparts to be shot and killed at the hands of police at a rate of 31.17 deaths per\nmillion as compared to 1.47 deaths per million for white males. While the data clearly demon-\nstrate racial disparities, an understudied aspect surrounding race and the use of force is how\nofficers' perceptions of suspects' size may affect police treatment. Aside from being black, Gar-\nat the time of their deaths [1,7,8], and this may, along with their race, have affected the percep-\ntions and actions of police officers. Human visual perception is not an objective or unbiased\nprocess [9]; an officer's perception of the size of a suspect--and thus of the potential physical\ndanger posed by that suspect--may be influenced by the suspect's race, independent of actual\nsize. Size, like beauty, may be in the eyes of the beholder.\nIn fact, when describing his encounter with Michael Brown to the grand jury, Officer Dar-\nren Wilson testified that he \"felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. that's just how\nbig [Brown] felt and how small [Wilson] felt.\"[10] Wilson also testified that \"[Brown] had the\nmost aggressive face. That's the only way [Wilson] can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's\nhow angry [Brown] looked.\" Wilson explained that he fired 12 shots at Brown because \"at this\npoint it looked like [Brown] was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making\nhim mad that [Wilson was] shooting at [Brown] [11].\" Not only does Wilson's description of\nthe events indicate that Brown's size influenced Wilson's actions, his claims that Brown became\nstronger after being hit by bullets, referring to Brown as \"it,\" and comparing Brown to an\naggressive demon also speaks to racial issues.\nNegative images of black men in American society have evolved from slavery to modern\ntimes and continue to influence perceptions of racial difference. Past stereotypical themes such\nas the \"black brute\" and \"noble savage\" are evident in contemporary media depictions of black\nmales as dangerous (e.g., notions of black men as thugs and gangsters) and superhuman (e.g.,\nnotions of what Spike Lee has termed \"the mystical, magical negro\" and the black athlete) [10\u00ad\n13]. Waytz, Hoffman, and Twawalter's recent study [14] shows that a significant number of\nwhite persons still perceive black persons on both implicit and explicit levels to possess super-\nhuman capabilities as well as deny blacks persons' pain. This research along with Wilson's tes-\ntimony highlights the importance of analyzing the intersection of suspects' race and size when\nstudying police behavior.\nAnother recent high profile case suggesting a connection between race, perceived size, and\npolice treatment involved the New York Police Department (NYPD) and 6'7, 220 lbs., black\nNational Basketball Association (NBA) player, Thabo Sefolosha, who suffered a broken fibula\nPero Antic, who is white, was unharmed [15]. The NYPD provides a rich ground for investiga-\ntion into racial disparities in policing because of their Stop, Question, and Frisk program. The\nNYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk program is legally rooted in Terry v. Ohio (1968) [16], which\npermits law enforcement officers to conduct limited warrantless searches if they have a level of\nsuspicion of probable cause. Under Terry, if officers witness unusual conduct which leads them\nto believe that a person has a weapon and is presently dangerous, officers may conduct a search\nand frisk the individual to determine if they are carrying a weapon. Although The Fourth\nAmendment [17] protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures and requires\nsearch warrants to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause, in 2009, the Wis-\nconsin Court of Appeals upheld that a suspect's furtive-type movement (suspicious, shifty, or\nstealthy behavior), and other circumstances suggestive of a threat to a police officer's safety,\ncan be the basis for a protective search [18].\nLarge Blacks and Hispanics at Increased Risk for Physical Police Intervention\nrole in study design, data collection, and analysis,\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nIn Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of the precincts with the greatest percentage of stops by the\nNYPD as measured against its population (29.1% in 2011), furtive movement was listed by\nofficers as the reason for half of the stops conducted between January 2006 and March 2010\n[19,20]. Furtive movement is often discussed by scholars as a catch-all category for police to\nstop whomever they please, and frequently results in a disproportionate amount of racial\nminorities who are stopped. A 2012 report from The New York Civil Liberties Union [20]\nshows that in 70 of the 76 New York precincts, black and Hispanic persons were the suspects\nin over half of NYPD stops, even in areas where black and Hispanic individuals represented\n14% or less of the population. In almost half (33) of the precincts, black and Hispanic persons\naccounted for more than 90% of stops and were more likely to be frisked than Whites who\nwere stopped. The report also showed that in a one year period there were more stops of\nyoung black males relative to their population in the city, suggesting that young black men\nwere stopped multiple times. Furthermore, 90% of the young black and Hispanic men who\nwere stopped by NYPD officers were deemed to be innocent [21]. In Brownsville, the arrest\ncity, and in more than 50,000 stops in Brownsville during this time period, only 25 guns were\nrecovered [19,20]. Because of the empirical evidence documenting racial disparities in NYPD\npractices, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Shira Scheindlin stated in Floyd v. City of NY\n(2013) [22] that the NYPD had targeted racially defined groups, thus violating both the\nfourth and fourteenth constitutional amendments. However, Scheindlin's ruling did not pro-\nhibit the use of Stop and Frisk tactics; rather, it required officers to more clearly prove the\nreason for their stops. It was not until March 2015 that NYPD officers were prohibited from\nconducting stops solely on the basis of suspects' furtive movement or presence in a high\nAlthough many studies [24\u00ad31] document the relationship between race and differential\ntreatment by the NYPD, only one [29] examined the association between size, measured by\nbody mass index (BMI; kg/m2), and criminal punishment by the NYPD. Masicampo et al. [29]\nfound that rates of criminal punishment are related to suspects' body size, suggesting the possi-\nbility that given the stigma of obesity, obese individuals are penalized more harshly for some\ntypes of crime. However, the authors did not report how race affected results, and by combin-\ning height and weight into a single index (BMI) lost the ability to estimate the separate associa-\ntions of height and weight with criminal punishment. Cullinane et al. [32] examined the\nrelationship between intimate partner violence, offender and victim body masses, and arrest\ndecisions and found a significant correlation between offender and victim body masses and\narrest decisions. However the researchers could not identify the cause of the correlation, and\nsimilarly to Masicampo et al., the study did not examine racial effects nor did it include a vari-\nable for height.\nIn the current study, we test the relationship between physical police intervention and\nboth perceived size and BMI, as well as explore how suspects' race may be associated with\nthese relationships. Apart from Masicampo et al. and Cullinane et al., no previous research\nhas analyzed suspects' perceived body size and police practices, though past theories of biol-\nogy and crime, such as Sheldon's somatotyping of criminal behavior [33] as well as several\nrecent studies assess the relationship between individuals' body type, height, and weight and\nlikelihood of committing crime and being arrested [34\u00ad36]. Here we used data from the\nNYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) Database, 2006\u00ad2013 to test whether perceived\nheight and weight are related to physical police intervention, including whether suspects\nwere frisked or searched, whether force was used against suspects, and whether race affects\nthe relationship.\nLarge Blacks and Hispanics at Increased Risk for Physical Police Intervention\nMethods\nData\nNYPD SQF data are publically available and do not contain identifying information; therefore,\nthis study was approved by The University of Alabama at Birmingham's IRB under the Appli-\ncation for Designation of Not Human Subjects Research. The most recent years available for\nyears were excluded due to noted concerns with the usability of the coding of `suspected crime,'\na key covariate in our model.\nThe SQF database is comprised of officer-recorded reports of their interactions with individ-\nuals \"when the officer has reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in criminal activity.\"\nThis level of interaction is referred to as a \"stop, question, and frisk\" interaction and is consid-\nered to be between \"common-law right of inquiry\" and arrest in terms of severity, although a\nSQF interaction may escalate into an arrest [30]. Each entry contains information regarding the\nsuspect, the reasons for the stop, the circumstances of the stop, and the officer's response. The\n18 years and older, of which 10% were white, 53% were black, and 32% were Hispanic. Due to\nthe small numbers of suspects denoted as Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan\nnative, and other (178,113 cases, 5% of sample) the three groups were merged and analyzed in a\nsingle `other' category. Additional descriptive statistics for this sample are given in Table 1.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics for the values reported in the NYPD SQF database from 2006\u00ad2013. Categorical variables are given as N(%) while con-\ntinuous variables are given as Median (IQR).\nTotal White Black Hispanic1\nSuspect Characteristics\nStop Time and Location\nPolice Intervention\n1 Includes Black-Hispanic and White-Hispanic individuals.\nLarge Blacks and Hispanics at Increased Risk for Physical Police Intervention\nVariable Definitions\nWe emphasize that when we refer to height, weight, or size, we refer to the officer-perceived\nvalues unless otherwise noted. We considered these perceived values to be reasonable for analy-\nsis as it is the officer's perception of suspect size rather than clinically measured values that\ncould affect their decision to physically intervene. The perceived size of the suspect was defined\ncategorically based on the combination of recorded height (under 66\", 66\u00ad72\", 73\"; under\nchosen because they were the 10th and 90th percentiles in this sample and approximate reason-\nable bounds for what constitutes a tall, short, light, or heavy adult American male.\nWe also analyzed the NYPD SQF database using the suspects' BMI category instead of\nheight and weight categories. Suspect BMIs were calculated via the officer reported height and\noverweight (25 to 30 kg/m2), or obese (over 30 kg/m2). No values were missing but a small por-\ntion (0.64%) had values for height, weight, or BMI that were deemed biologically implausible\nbased on what was observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nBMI replaced using multiple imputation [38].\nStatistical Analysis\nGeneralized linear mixed models were used to make inferences about the combinations of race\nand size, modeled as a race-by-height-by-weight interaction, with regard to the marginal odds\nof the suspect being frisked or searched and to the odds of having force used against them. The\nwhite suspects as the reference group while controlling for thirty-two covariates relating to the\ntime and place of the stop, the reasons for the stop (including the suspected crime), and suspect\ncharacteristics besides race and size [30]. The precinct in which the stop took place was treated\nas a random effect to account for correlation present between stops due to similarities in the\nneighborhoods or the officers making the stops. The covariates used in the analysis are listed in\nTable A in S1 File, and their effects are given in Tables B, C, D, and E in S1 File. The alpha level\nto determine statistical significance and confidence interval (CI) width was set at 0.01 (2-tailed;\n99% CIs) to account for the large sample size.\nThe analysis of the different definition of size using BMI categories was identical to the one\ndescribed above.

Recent events have drawn public awareness to issues of police violence, and specifically,\nthe relationship between citizens' race and officers' behavior. Our results add to the discussion\nby showing that not only are there racial disparities in police physical intervention, there is also\nan association between suspects' officer-perceived size and police physical intervention as well\nas an association between suspects' race, their officer-perceived size, and police treatment.\nFig 3. The adjusted odds ratios for the suspect being frisked or searched (top) or having force used\non them (bottom) by race and BMI category compared to normal weight white suspects, controlling\nfor stop characteristics. The blue circle denotes white suspects, the red diamond denotes black suspects,\nand the green square denotes Hispanic suspects. Error bars indicate the 99% confidence interval for the\ngroup estimates.\nLarge Blacks and Hispanics at Increased Risk for Physical Police Intervention\nAlthough suspects perceived to be tall or heavy have increased risk of physical police punish-\nment, suspects perceived as tall and heavy are at still greater risk and tall, heavy, black and His-\npanic men are at the greatest risk of all.\nFurther analyses show that there is a slight association between suspects' obesity status and\nofficers' decisions to physically intervene, especially for obese black suspects. In fact, Garner,\nBrown, and Parker, were all classifiable as obese (BMIs were 30 or more) [1,7,8] at the time of\ntheir deaths. However, the associations are not monolithic and do not lend themselves to obvi-\nous interpretation. More work is needed to explore whether obesity status as a function of race\naffects officers' decisions. Obesity may be an important component in studying police treat-\nment of suspects not only because obesity had risen nationwide, but because obesity is more\ncommon in certain racial groups [40], and is a highly stigmatized condition [41\u00ad43]. Past\nresearch shows that rates of weight discrimination are high [44] and that obesity elicits stigma\nand negative character assessments of obese people as non-compliant, evil, disgusting, unintel-\nligent, and mean-spirited [44\u00ad51] which may affect police behavior.\nAside from police treatment, recent studies [52,53] on size and the criminal justice system\nhave focused on sex but not race. The current study is the first to test the interaction among\nrace, perceived size, and criminal punishment. Although it has been shown that even when\nmen and women are of equal actual height, men are perceived to be taller than women [54], we\nknow of no comparable findings on the effects of race on perceived body size and conducting\nsuch studies would seem merited.\nOur results suggest that researchers should incorporate measures of suspects' size (or per-\nhaps more aptly, perceived size) when studying police behavior and police may benefit from\ninformation about stereotypes associated with size and race. To explore and address long-\nstanding issues of racial stereotyping and bias, future research should examine how officers\nperceive the sizes of differently-raced suspects as well as their feelings towards differently-raced\nsuspects across size categories. One weakness of our study is that the data are merely observa-\ntional, which inhibits our ability to assert that the association between race/size and stop out-\ncomes is causal. Experiments should be conducted to determine if there is an association\nbetween suspects' race and police officers' likelihood of overestimating or underestimating sus-\npects' size. Another weakness of our study is that it only examines male suspects. Future studies\nshould examine the relationship between race, perceived size, and physical police intervention\nwith regard to female suspects in order to understand the nuances associated with intersection-\nality in terms of race, perceived size, sex, and police treatment. Additionally because our study\nonly utilized NYPD data, our findings cannot necessarily be generalized to the broader popula-\ntion, and research examining suspects' race, perceived size, and differential treatment by police\nwould benefit from nationally representative data.\nTo reduce the influence of both covert and overt prejudice in police treatment of suspects,\nwe recommend that officer training programs incorporate education on different types of racial\nbias which extend beyond old-fashioned, biological, Jim Crow racism to include instruction on\ncultural and more nuanced forms of racism such as systemic racism [55], symbolic racism [56],\nlaisse-faire racism [57], and colorblind racism [58]. We also encourage policy makers and\nscholars to continue to examine how legislation associated with racial profiling may result in\ndisparities and how the personal characteristics of police officers and suspects are related to\ninequalities in the criminal justice system.\nSupporting Information\nS1 File.
