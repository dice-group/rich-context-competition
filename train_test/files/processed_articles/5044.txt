    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe recent terrorist attacks and ongoing state of emergency in France have brought questions of police surveillance into\nthe public spotlight, making it increasingly important to understand how police attain data from citizens. Since 2005, the\nFrench police have been using IBM's computer program, i2 Analyst's Notebook, to aggregate information and craft\ncriminal narratives. This technology serves to quickly connect suspects with crimes, looking for as many associations as\npossible, ranking and visualizing them based on level of importance. Recently, surveillance and state power have been\ntheorized as having shifted to a posthegemonic, order. Drawing from literature on power, surveillance, and identity, this\npaper considers the various ways that algorithms can impact policing under a state of emergency by comparing the\ntechnical protocol of i2 Analyst's Notebook with the administrative protocol of the French state. Using i2 Analyst's\nNotebook as an example, this paper argues that posthegemonic theories of power have their place in determining how\nalgorithms can be used for surveillance, but that they cannot completely explain their use under the state of emergency.\n",

Using police testimony\nfrom an investigation by the French national assembly,\nthis paper shows the importance of data extraction as a\npolice tactic under the state of emergency. The technical\nprotocol of i2 Analyst's Notebook, which allows for\ndata extraction at its current scale, is compared with\nthe administrative protocol of the nation-state. Using\nAgamben's work on the state of exception, I argue that\nthe state of emergency is a central function of liberal\nstatehood, as opposed to a temporary lapse in\ndemocratic judgment. The algorithm and the data visu-\nalization are more than just the mediums of state\ncontrol and they are part of its material constitution.\nThis argument brings along with it discussions\nof power operating as posthegemonic, and the ``post-\npanopticon'' era of surveillance, which raise questions\nof how social life is controlled and by whom. For the-\nories of surveillance and power, this work focuses on\nScott Lash's ``Power after hegemony'' (2007), and\nDavid Lyon and Zygmunt Bauman's Liquid\nSurveillance: A Conversation (2013). These authors,\nalong with others, have made the case that power no\nlonger operates from above in a traditional hegemonic\nfashion, but rather that it operates from below, in\nUniversity of Washington, USA\nCorresponding author:\nKyle Kubler, Department of Communication, University of Washington,\nSeattle, WA, USA.\nEmail: kubler@uw.edu\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-\nat-sage).\nBig Data & Society\njournals.sagepub.com/home/bds\nhorizontal forms of communication. By putting surveil-\nlance literature in conversation with that of algorithms,\nI show how the state of emergency in France validates,\nbut also complicates concepts of posthegemony, par-\nticularly regarding the state.\nThe state of emergency in France creates a unique\ncase study for understanding the role of algorithms in\nthe creation of political identity. For scholars that evoke\nFoucault, Agamben, and Deleuze to theorize the inter-\nsection of state power and surveillance technologies, I\nhope the example of France today will be a helpful\nexpose\n\u00b4 of state violence and identity. I draw heavily\nfrom Dan McQuillan's ``Algorithmic state of exception''\n(2015) and John Cheney-Lippold's ``A new algorithmic\nidentity'' (2011) to test these theories against the current\nstate of emergency in France, showing the intersections\nand limits of current scholarship. Cheney-Lippold uses\nDeleuze and theories of posthegemony to show how\nalgorithms create a fragmented identity of dividuality.\nFor McQuillan, algorithms create an ungovernable\nspace of exception that allows them to determine iden-\ntity in this way. I argue that the creation of dividual\nidentity aligns with the technical protocol of i2\nAnalyst's Notebook, and the administrative protocol\nof the French state, but that it is not necessarily indica-\ntive of posthegemonic power, nor a result of states of\nexception created by the algorithm itself. The state of\nemergency is an example of how the state creates divi-\ndual identity, not through exception, but as a rule of its\nexistence. For some, the increasing use of algorithms in\ngovernance and policing is seen as inhumane or\nundemocratic. My goal is not to discourage this conver-\nsation, but to take it further by making an ontological\nconnection between how both algorithms and the state\noperate through identity, control, and exclusion.\nState of emergency\nIn response to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13\nNovember 2015, France has been under a state of emer-\ngency which has drastic effects on law enforcement.\nLegally, this allows the police1 significant freedoms that\nare not limited to conducting house raids and putting\npeople under house arrest without approval from a\njudge, collecting and monitoring information obtained\nfrom potential suspects, and the ability to block websites\nand prevent public gatherings (Human Rights Watch,\n2016a). These freedoms allow police access to vast\namounts of data, with over 18 terabytes collected and ana-\nlyzed since November 2015 (Raimbourg and Poisson,\ncuted and more than 500 people have been put under\nhouse arrest (Human Rights Watch, 2016b). The state of\nemergency has now been extended for a fourth time, which\nwill last until July 2017. In an era of policing that relies\nheavily on computer software to aggregate information, it\nis important to understand the potential these technologies\nhave for influencing surveillance and policing.\nWhile much of the legal focus in France has been on\nthe changes during the state of emergency, impactful\nchanges to data privacy and security laws took place\nearlier, in 2014 with the LPM Act (loi de programma-\ntion militaire). Along with allowing the deployment of\n7000 soldiers during times of crisis, the LPM Act also\n``provided an opportunity to modify the legal regime\napplicable to administrative access to communications\ndata, in order to give counter-terrorism services\nbroader access'' (CNIL, 2015). The Charlie Hebdo\nattacks in January 2015 activated the LPM act and\nbrought along with it the Intelligence Act of 24 July\n2015.2 The Intelligence Act allowed intelligence services\nto hold communication data of potential suspects for\nup to five years (previously one year before the LPM),\nwiretapping and electronic surveillance were extended\nbeyond just the suspect to include family and friends,\nauthorized the use of keyloggers and other software to\nmonitor and record computer use, and introduced\nIMSI catchers, or fake cell phone towers that capture\nmobile phone data (CNIL, 2015). These previous legal\ndecisions have affected the way data has been collected\nand analyzed during the state of emergency.\nThe legal parameters of the state of emergency have\nfluctuated since it has been in effect. The period from\nnumber of raids and house arrests. When the state of\nemergency was continued in February, the constitu-\ntional court deemed it unconstitutional to seize data\nfrom citizens during house raids. In the period imme-\ndiately following this decision, from February until\nJuly, raids and house arrests were at their lowest.\nHowever, after the terrorist attack in Nice during\nemergency was extended again, with a reevaluation of\ndata seizure laws. For the newly ratified state of emer-\ngency, French police can seize property such as cell\nphones and hard drives, on the condition that a signifi-\ncant connection to a crime or terrorist plot can be\nproven. For this data to be stored, connections to a\ncrime must be ratified by a judge, which according to\nthe vice-president of the State Counsel, Jean-Marc\nSauve\nthis ruling, house arrests have increased 50%, and raids\nUnsurprisingly, these raids and house arrests have\nbeen carried out along highly racialized and religious\nlines. Due to the strict secularization laws in France, the\nstate does not have official census data on race or reli-\ngion, making quantitative answers to these questions\ndifficult. Estimations of the Muslim population in\nFrance are around 8%, mostly of north African\n2 Big Data & Society\ndescent, with the most well-known study done by the\nFrench Institute for Demographic Studies (INED,\n2010). However, with a Muslim population of only\n8%, it is estimated that Muslims make up 50\u00ad70% of\nthe prison population (Khosrokhavar, 2013). With this\nmassive overrepresentation of Muslims in prison\noccurring for many years before the state of emergency,\ncertain a priori assumptions about discrimination in\nthe implementation of the state of emergency can be\nmade. It is worth noting here that despite the secular\nresistance to providing census data for the Muslim\npopulation in prison, the French state seems to have\nno qualms about making its antiterrorism programs\nexplicitly tied to stopping radical Islam. This can be\nseen clearly in their antiradicalization campaign started\nin 2014 called #alwaysachoice which provides people\nwith a nationwide hotline to call if they think someone\nthey know is becoming a radical jihadi. One of the\nmany problems with this approach is that it ignores\nall other forms of radicalization, in favor of only\nseeing radicalization as a process that happens within\nIslam. For some, this level of discrimination is\nexplained away by the fact that most severe terrorist\nattacks in France over the past five years have been\nassociated with ISIS, yet the degree to which the\nFrench state selectively uses its secularization laws is\nevident.\nSome of the best evidence available so far regarding\nhow the state of emergency has been implemented by\nsecurity forces in France comes from a report by the\nFrench national assembly, in which different security\nadministrators and police officers testified. One of\nthese officers is Colonel Charles-Antoine Thomas, the\nhead of the gendarmes in Val d'Oise, a region that\ncovers much of the northern suburbs of Paris. When\nasked how long house raids usually take, Colonel\nCharles-Antoine Thomas replied: ``it depends on the\namount of data that's discovered; that's what takes us\nthe longest. For us, the best part is the data, because\nsometimes we can find signs of logistics networks,\nnobody sleeps with their AK!'' (Raimbourg and\nof data accumulation in the house raids under the state\nof emergency. It is software like i2 Analyst's Notebook\nthat facilitates this type of policing, by providing a tool\nthat can sort, order, and present the large amount of\ndata collected through these raids. This approach relies\non data visualizations to analyze a high volume of data\nin such a short amount of time (Seidler and Adderley,\ni2Analyst's Notebook\nNotebook (hereafter known as i2AN) in conjunction\nwith the beginnings of criminal analysis programs\ninitiatives were part of a broader plan to bring\ngovernment data online in a centralized and easily shar-\nable format. They defined how long police could keep\npersonal information about suspects and victims on file,\nas well as created unified databases for storing this\ninformation. ANACRIM was recently updated two\nyears ago to help automate the retrieval of information\nfrom all police databases so that it can be more easily\nintegrated into their network analysis software, i2AN\nis a visual intelligence analysis environment that can\noptimize the value of massive amounts of information\ncollected by government agencies and businesses. With\nan intuitive and contextual design it allows analysts to\nquickly collate, analyze and visualize data from dispar-\nate sources while reducing the time required to discover\nkey information in complex data. (IBM, 2016)\nOne of i2AN's most important functions is to import\ndata from multiple datasets and produce visualizations\nthat will help reveal connections that would not be\nmade otherwise. This type of software enables police\nforces to access large amounts of public data while\nconserving resources and time (Kennedy et al., 2015).\nSimilar initiatives to digitize and centralize police rec-\nords have occurred across the world to take advantage\nof policing software. If the databases are not entirely\nreadable by the data-mining algorithms in the software\nthis can lead to inefficiencies and error (Kantardzic,\nAzzam et al. (2013: 8) define data visualization as\n``a process that (a) is based on qualitative or quantita-\ntive data and (b) results in an image that is representa-\ntive of the raw data, which is (c) readable by viewers\nand supports exploration, examination, and communi-\ncation of the data.'' This definition helps clarify the\npurpose of data visualization, which is to speak and\ninterpret on behalf of information that might not other-\nwise have a voice. For the French police, i2AN's visu-\nalization tool is most valuable in analyzing criminal\nnetworks. This role is explained in the police journal\nNational Gendarme Review,\nIntelligence network analysis is an essential step in the\nadoption of action and a prerequisite to decision\nmaking. i2 Analyst's Notebook permits analysts to\nquickly class, analyze and visualize data from multiple\nsources. It reduces the time necessary to recognize\nnecessary information to craft a solid and timely net-\nwork which allows the identification, prediction, pre-\nvention and interruption of terrorist, criminal, and\nThe use of the visual not only allows for a unique\nview of the data, but it also represents the speed and\nprocessing capacity of the software. In ideal circum-\nstances, data visualization promotes exploration and\nexamination like the above definition denotes, but\nsometimes the opposite is true. In certain situations, it\nis possible for the visualization themselves to become\nthe answers instead of an interpretive tool for decision\nmakers.\nDespite the inherent notion of objectivity in the\nword data, our social world and technologies shape\nand rationalize our understanding of facts. This is espe-\ncially true for police work. Dealing with environments\nthat are constantly in flux, there is never a situation\nwhere officers will have all the available information\non a subject or crime. Widespread use of the internet,\nmobile phones, and other geolocatable technologies\n(bank cards, transit pass, etc.) have vastly expanded\nthe data available to police departments (Alison,\n2014), which have responded by introducing soft-\nware that aggregates information from multiple\ndatabases in real time. With so much information\nbeing processed at once, data visualization becomes a\nvital component in the synthesis and comprehensibility\nof data. To make the information intelligible to ana-\nlysts, visualizations create cognitive shortcuts for faster\nand more efficient information processing (Kantardzic,\ni2AN is not a predictive policing software like the\nmore popular software PredPol. For PredPol, algo-\nrithms play the role of the analyst once the data has\nbeen collected (usually a process done by other algo-\nrithms). What is usually meant by predictive policing is\nalgorithms making predictions for where and when\ncrime is going to occur. For i2AN, algorithms data-\nmine and provide visualization readouts of that infor-\nmation, but a human analyst is still required to decide\nabout a target or action. The level to which this soft-\nware constitutes predictive policing is based on several\nfactors, the most well-known being algorithms that\nattempt to replace the role of the analyst in evaluating\nthe results of the data-mining process. However, the\npresence of a human analyst does not preclude policing\nfrom being predictive to some degree, even if it doesn't\nfall under the traditional definition of predictive poli-\ncing. The processes of data-mining and visualization\nare correlative in nature (boyd and Crawford, 2012),\nand many of these policing software are based on the-\nories of crime that value the correlations of past crimes\nto predict future ones (Benbouzid, 2015). The human\nanalyst is still making a prediction of the future based\non past events, so the major difference between our\n``predictive'' and nonpredictive policing software is\ndetermined not by the nature of prediction, but who/\nwhat is doing the predicting.\nClarifying the similarities is important, since much\nof PredPol's popularity has come in the form of\ncritiques about its predictive capacities, without a\ndeeper evaluation of the underlying connection between\nsearch algorithms and the state (Brakel and\ncategorization has changed how power is distributed\nthrough the coevolution of technologies and govern-\nance (Just and Lazer, 2016). Police software such as\ni2AN can take the form of a list-plus-algorithm, with\nthe list of inputs serving as the background on which\nthis problem to the protocol of list-plus-algorithm soft-\nware like i2AN.\nLists-plus-algorithms are envisaged doing many useful\nthings: prompting redirection of resources towards\nareas of greatest need, for instance. Yet, for many,\nlists-plus-algorithms dissemble as much as they dis-\nclose, perturb as much as they excite. Even as they\nare identified with enhanced capacities of prediction\nand preemption, these practices also evoke a sense of\ndiminished capacity[. . .]The use of list-plus-algorithm\nfor global governance seems, at once, an apotheosis\nof rationalism and a condition of reason's demise.\nFor i2AN, and other similar policing software, infor-\nmation about a subject or object in question is mined\nfrom multiple private and public databases, depending\non the level of access granted to the agency in question.\nThe data then appear in visualization for an analyst, or\nanother algorithm, to evaluate. When the simple\nmining of databases is not enough, the information is\nextracted through more forceful measures such as a\nhouse or business raid in which cell phones and hard\ndrives are confiscated. The very real threat of terrorism\nin France today has exacerbated the need for the\nFrench state to go to these extreme measures, under-\nlining the diminished capacity that Johns mentions of\nthese algorithms to accurately identify terrorist threats.\nThese lists-plus-algorithms must briefly be put in\ntheir historical context, as their development is part\nand parcel to that of capitalism (Mager, 2012) and\nmodern warfare (Amoore, 2009). Capitalism, the liberal\ndemocratic state's counterpart, relies on the commodity\nform to organize and distribute goods. Search algo-\nrithms are built to take a commodity and divide it\ninto its material inputs for supply chain organization\nor into its constituent cultural value so that it can best\nbe advertised to consumers. i2AN is a direct descendent\nof the decision-tree algorithms that, originally used for\nretail, have now been adopted by militaries for counter-\nterrorism and cybersecurity. The primary role of these\nsoftware is to ``translate probable associations between\npeople or objects into actionable security decisions''\n4 Big Data & Society\nsystem of addressability had to be created. Amoore\ntraces how the development of these technologies\nwent from addressability to locatability.\nAddressability allows one's location to be searched,\nwhile locatability allows one to be tracked.\nIndividuals are broken down into their constituent\nparts and repackaged to craft a network that is\ndeemed the most lucrative for identifying potential sus-\npects. The ability to quickly leverage algorithmic deci-\nsions about potential terrorist targets through house\nand business raids increases the effectiveness of this\napparatus, which is historically linked to both com-\nmodification and warfare. House arrest is a highly\naccurate form of locatability, where those arrested are\nrequired to check in to a police station up to three times\na day. However, this method is costly and doesn't cast a\nwide enough net. Going after a hard drive or cell phone\nreduces the need to use other, traditional methods of\nobtaining information such as interrogation and tor-\nture, and can provide a wealth of data on criminal net-\nworks that can then be analyzed with i2AN. The use of\nthe state of emergency to accomplish these goals can be\nfollowed to the protocol of both i2AN and the state.\nProtocol\nThe concept of protocol is used in many ways, with two\nof the more common uses being the operations of a\ntechnical system, and a set of administrative rules.\nBoth definitions are valuable in understanding how\nthe technical protocol of software such as i2AN reflects\nadministrative protocol of the French state of emer-\ngency. Algorithms play a large role in surveillance\nand search, and it is their technical protocol that deter-\nmines how information is stored and accessed\n(Galloway, 2004). Galloway defines protocol as\n``against interpretation. This is to say that protocol\ndoes little to transcode the meaning of the semantic\nunits of value that pass in and out of its purview''\n(p. 52). Simply put, protocol is the potential for\nexistence within a system or software. ``The limits of\na protocological system and the limits of possibility\nwithin that system are synonymous'' (p. 52). Protocol\nis not descriptive of data pathways within software, it is\nthose data pathways. Understanding protocol allows\nfor actions by the police to be viewed through the pos-\nsibilities of their software. Rather than a deterministic\nview of technology's influence on policing, protocol\nprovides just one factor out of the many technical, pol-\nitical, religious, and economic factors that shape police\naction in the state of emergency.\nWhen looking at the technical protocol of i2AN, one\ncan start with its GUI-WIMP interface (Graphical User\nInterface-Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointers) that is\naccessed predominantly through a desktop computer.\nThis means that the i2AN interface responds to user's\nactions with the mouse and keyboard. There are certain\naffordances, imagined and material, that are present\nwhile working with i2AN on a desktop that work\ntogether with technical and administrative protocol to\nconstruct possible action, (Nagy and Neff, 2015). A 2D\nsocial network analysis, in the form of a node and link\ngraph, is laid on top of a GIS map, where suspects can\nbe dragged around the screen, enlarged with a double-\nclick, and ordered based on their importance. These are\nall components of how criminality is visualized and\nunderstood in i2AN.\nThe default screen for working on a new project in\ni2AN is a blank page surrounded on the top and right-\nhand sides with toolbars. To begin working the user\nmust import a dataset that has values recognizable to\ni2AN. These datasets have been compiled by\ndata-mining algorithms and generally have not yet\nbeen interpreted by a human analyst. The program\nhas multiple options for data visualization and gives\nits user multiple options for how they want the cluster-\ning and centrality of the nodes to be weighed and\nvisually displayed, which augments the focus of the\ngraph. These options can be checked or unchecked,\nleading to a large variety of outcomes based on the\nuser's preference. i2AN also gives users the option to\ncustomize the weight of each link in the network to\nemphasize different degrees of connection. The magni-\ntude of these options is only a sampling of the various\nways a single dataset can be interpreted and is an\ninstructive glimpse at the possibilities of i2AN.\ni2AN's use of node and link graphs for visualizing\nsocial network analysis brings up issues of accuracy,\nparticularly under the state of emergency, where the\ngoal is to find out about future terrorist plots, or ter-\nrorists, from the inside out. Node and link graphs are\nnot known for being a good visualization for this type\nof risk (Hall et al., 2015). For these visualizations to\nadequately represent the relationships between nodes,\nthere needs to be a clear identity distinction between the\ninsiders and outsiders of a network. Commenting on\nnode and link visualizations, Hall et al. (2015) note\nthat ``visualization presupposes fixed behaviour types:\ninsiders are either loyal or malicious. Such a distinction\ncomplies with militaristic approaches of the past, but in\ncloud computing the distinction between insiders and\noutsiders is not easy to make'' (p. 95). It is important to\nnote that the theoretical background for terrorist net-\nwork analysis is still developing (Lindelauf et al., 2011).\nDespite adopting theories from other fields that use\nsocial network analysis, ``the evidence concerning\nterrorist network structures however is often anec-\ndotal'' (p. 63). While identity descriptors such as\nname, race, gender, might be known, the meaning of\nthat identity in terms of its threat may not be. As this\narticle will attempt to show, distinguishing insiders\nfrom outsiders is a task that algorithms attempt to\naccomplish. This task is central not only to the state\nof emergency but to the state itself.\nAdministrative protocol also represents limits of\npossibility, but instead of a technical structure, it\napplies to a social structure. The nature of the sovereign\nand the state of exception reveal the administrative\nprotocol of the nation-state. In allowing a sovereign\nbody to govern and make laws that all must follow, it\nbecomes quite difficult to prevent that body from\nbreaking its own rules. This rule of exception is a fea-\nture, not a bug of sovereign statehood.Early philosoph-\nical investigations into this dual quality of the state\nbegin with Schmitt C (2005), in his essay Political\nTheology, where the sovereign is that which defines\nthe nature of exception. Further work by Ernst\nKantorowicz (1957) in, The King's Two Bodies,\nlooked at the dual nature of governance in medieval\nEurope, coining the popular phrase ``body politic.''\nTo reference the above quote by Fleur Johns (2016:\n128) that the state is the only one to both set the\nrules and call time out is both ``an apotheosis of ration-\nalism and a condition of reason's demise.''\nThe contemporary philosophical work on the state\nof exception is centered around Giorgio Agamben's\n(1995), Homo Sacer series, which draws heavily from\nboth Schmitt and Kantorowicz. At the surface, it seems\neasy to separate exception and rule into two different\nlegal categories, but Agamben stresses that exceptional\nlegal circumstances in fact define the rule. ``Only\nbecause its validity is suspended in the state of excep-\ntion can positive law define the normal case as the\nrealm of its own validity'' (p. 17). The ontologically\ninseparable connection between rule and exception\ndemonstrates the administrative protocol of sovereign\nstatehood. The state of emergency is thus a defining\nfeature of the French state, used to redefine who it con-\nsiders as citizens internal to its rule, and who it con-\nsiders as external threats. How algorithms affect this\ndistinction between inside and out is discussed further\nin the section on identity and exception. Both adminis-\ntrative and technological protocol shape policing and\nthe use of algorithms, and it is through this lens that the\nstate of emergency can be used to question theories of\npower and posthegemony.\nPower and surveillance\nThe implications of algorithmic police surveillance in\nFrance must be evaluated in the context of theories of\npower and hegemony. Along with developments of\npostmodernism in the second half of the 20th century,\ncritiques of modernist analyses of power began to\nemerge from thinkers such as Michel Foucault and\nJean Baudrillard. This line of thinking has involved\nthe term ``posthegemony,'' which replaces structuralist\nnarratives of power from above with power from within\nor below. The modern usage of hegemony is commonly\nassociated with Antonio Gramsci, to refer to a source\nof totally dominating power, be it the state, capital,\ncolonialism, etc. Many others have taken up this term\nin different disciplines, with a notable example being\nStuart Hall in cultural studies. It is through this con-\nception of hegemony within cultural studies that Scott\nLash roots the move to posthegemony. One of the\ntenants of this theory relies on how we perceive and\ncommunicate data, information, and fact. Lash points\nto the algorithm being an integral medium for commu-\nnicating power and domination in a posthegemonic era\nFor Lash, the difference between hegemony and\nposthegemony relies on where power is located. ``The\nhegemon is above. It is outside and over. In the post-\nhegemonic order, power comes to act from below: it no\nlonger stays outside that which it `effects'. It becomes\ninstead immanent in its object and its processes''\nfrom below is in ``a change from an extensive (and\nhegemonic) regime of representation to an intensive\ntheories of networks and the multitude from Hardt and\nNegri's Empire, Lash sees posthegemonic control in the\ncommunication networks made constant by ubiquitous\nmedia and the protocol through which the media tech-\nnologies are constructed. Since many agree we are in\nthe era of ubiquitous media and computing, the poten-\ntial for algorithms to produce posthegemonic power is\nrithm does embody posthegemonic power from below\nsince it is embedded in the architecture of mediated\ncommunication. Data becomes a higher priority for\npolice because mediated, and thus searchable, record-\nable, and organizable, actions encompass a greater por-\ntion of total human actions. When viewing power at the\nlevel of the algorithm, a shift to posthegemony seems\nplausible. However, forms of data extraction seen in the\nstate of emergency in France place the role of the algo-\nrithm within a broader structure of state power,\ndemonstrating the limits of posthegemony.\nIf the necessary power to control society was pro-\nduced only from below, through our networked com-\nmunication and with the help of algorithms, there\nwould be no need for the state of emergency, or perhaps\neven the state itself. The state of exception demon-\nstrates the necessary separation of inside and outside,\nabove and below, that is constitutive of the state.\nAlgorithms as material lines of code reflect this separ-\nation as well. They interpret information from the\n6 Big Data & Society\ninside, to produce a result from the outside. It is the act\nof interpreting, through code and visualization, that\ndefines this separation in the use of algorithms. When\ninterpreting the use of data and information under\nposthegemony Lash writes: ``in the post-hegemonic\nage the concept is dis-intermediated and we come up\nagainst facts as raw sense data. In their rawness, facts\ncome very much alive'' (p. 64). It may be the case that\nwe as subjects encounter this raw sense data, but the\ngoal of i2AN for the French police, however successful,\nis to remove this rawness and make the data compre-\nhensible so that it can be acted upon. The state of emer-\ngency exists as an admittance of the failure of\nposthegemonic forms of power to guarantee social\npeace. i2AN may help govern from below in some post-\nhegemonic fashion, but the data it receives, extracted\nfrom house and business raids, demonstrates the hege-\nmonic form of domination that still persists.\nFollowing the move to posthegemony, the term post-\npanopticon has been used in the field of surveillance\nstudies by Zygmunt Bauman, and David Lyon, in\ntandem with the phrase liquid modernity. The concept\nof liquid modernity is analogous to posthegemony in\nthat it highlights the flexible nature of control and\npower. Postpanopticon describes a mode of surveil-\nlance that is not determined by direct state observation,\nas was the case with Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, but\nby indirect monitoring, prediction, and self-surveillance\n(Bauman and Lyon, 2013). Self-surveillance to this\ndegree is made possible by ubiquitous media use and\nalgorithms. Postpanoptical prediction creates what\nLyon calls a data double. ``The information that\nproxies for the person is made up of `personal data'\nonly in the sense that it originated with a person's\nbody and may affect their life chances and choices''\n(p. 8). This is how i2AN operates, by creating a con-\nglomerate of data points about an individual and trying\nto connect them to a network of other potential sus-\npects. Finally, Bauman sees the traditional era of pan-\nopticon surveillance still in operation today, but only\nfor certain people. In the era of liquid modernity, more\nhegemonic forms of panopticon surveillance operate at\nthe social margins, in prisons, at borders, and the out-\nskirts, while those with more social value and wealth\nare surveilled at a postpanoptical distance (Bauman\nand Lyon, 2013). What is of interest here is what\nthese theories of surveillance can tell us about the cur-\nrent state of emergency in France and what role the\nalgorithm plays.\nAs mentioned above, the state of emergency exposes\nthe state as a traditional, hegemonic form of power,\ndespite methods of control that might be deemed post-\nhegemonic. The state of emergency is the enclosure and\nreduction of the free space that was previously pur-\nchased by social classes willing, and able, to surveil\nthemselves. In the case of house arrests, the social mar-\ngins creep into everyday life, making the home a prison,\nand the neighborhood a border. One of the central\nfunctions of the house raid is to help police forces\nredraw these boundaries by gathering data of criminal\nnetworks. This is demonstrated in a conversation\nbetween the minister of justice, Jean-Jacques Urvoas,\nand the departmental director of public security in\nLoiret, Pascal Belin.\nUrvoas: In your opinion, is intelligence gathering the\nmain benefit of the state of emergency?\nBelin: I would say the interest in house raids has dimin-\nished really quickly. For example, with this group of\nChechens, the first house arrest and raid focused on the\ntreasure of the group; the examination of their\ncomputers - with documents in cyrillic . . . - that was\nvery interesting. But the rest of the group quickly\nwent underground. The house raids were no longer\nvaluable: we found wiped telephones, no call records,\nno text messages, no contacts . . . just like the com-\nputers, completely empty. (Raimbourg and Poisson,\nWhile arresting criminals and ending the threat of ter-\nrorism are clearly the overall goals of the state of emer-\ngency, the more immediate and specific goal of the\nhouse arrest and raid, as tactic, is access to data that\nwould not be available under normal legal circum-\nstances. Those that previously existed at a postpanop-\ntical distance, now feel the immediacy of hegemonic\nstate power. With this information, one's data double\ncan be used to discover criminal networks and lead to\nfuture arrests.\nIdentity and exception\nSurveillance tools that function using algorithms bring\nup questions of identity and formation of subjectivity\nunder the state. Cheney-Lippold's ``A new algorithmic\nidentity'' (2013) explores this topic extensively and\noffers a base on which identity in the state of emergency\ncan be analyzed. Cheney-Lippold uses Deleuze's theory\nof the dividual and Foucault's work on biopolitics and\npower to argue that algorithmic search and surveillance\ncreate floating, adaptable identities, analogous to\nBauman and Lyon's data double. This allows for soft\nforms of state control, as seen in the posthegemonic\nera, to replace the hard power of previous state discip-\nline. ``Many mechanisms of control have shifted to\npractices external to the body, where discipline has\noften become more or less unnecessary if control can\nbe enacted through a series of guiding, determining,\nThis form of control creates dividuality, an idea\noriginating with Deleuze, which refers to individuality\nthat is constantly subdivided into constituent parts, or\ndividuals. ``These dividuals become the axiom of con-\ntrol, the recipients through which power flows as sub-\njectivity takes a deconstructed dive into the digital era''\n(p. 169). Control in this sense is the form of power that\nmodulates conditions of possibility without direct, dis-\nciplinary uses of force. It seems that while softer forms\nof control certainly fit with some of the technical proto-\ncol of search and surveillance algorithms, this does not\nexclude those algorithms from also serving hard discip-\nline. The example of France during the state of emer-\ngency shows that those algorithms can be used for\ndisciplinary roles, while still treating the citizen as a\ndividual. After all, the goal of the state of emergency\nin creating dividuality through i2AN is to capture ter-\nrorists, the hyper-targeted individual.\nThe raid and house arrest are tactics that perform a\nparticular type of surveillance. They are conducted on\nindividuals that could be dangerous to the state, but\nwho do not have enough evidence against them to be\narrested. Their dividuality, or data double, has not soli-\ndified into a credible identity for the state, and thus\nrequires further investigation. This identity monitoring\nduring the state of emergency is explained again by\nPascal Belin during his testimony to the French\nNational Assembly.\nIn three fourths of the cases, the house raids allowed us\nto check up on people who had been signaled to us as\nhaving a troubling change in behavior or talked about\nsupporting Daesh: we could see, at these people's own\nhomes, if these signs were just associated with a general\nunhappiness, or if it was something more serious.\nThis type of verification is another instance of an\nenclosure of borders coming from above, when the\ntactic of surveillance from below is insufficient. The\nstate of emergency is the admittance of an increased\nthreat level that requires a reconfiguration of data dou-\nbles and dividualities, to more precisely surveil certain\npopulations. Where Bauman and Lyon urge us to think\nof a liquid modernity with data flows and networks as\nsources of power, the house raid is a reminder of the\nstate's desire to monitor and appropriate them.\nWhat is at play here is not only the question of how\nto coherently make sense of the massive amounts of\ndata that get plugged into these lists-plus-algorithms,\nbut how this process of mining, visualization, and ana-\nlysis changes the nature of the subjects that the data\nrepresent. The algorithm calculates correlations\nfrom the list that is definite, ordered, and yet endlessly\nalterable; this combination of protocols is what Johns\nalgorithmic decision making, Diakopoulos (2016) div-\nides it into four different parts: prioritizing,\nclassification, association, and filtering. These tasks\nare shared by both list and algorithm in a way that\nmakes transparency and regulation difficult.\nIn theory, it is the judicial system of liberal democracies\nthat is supposed to defend the civil liberties of individ-\nuals against unlawful search and identification from\nthese algorithms. In many cases this means restricting\nthese algorithms from working at their full potential.\nOnly certain information about subjects can be used at\na certain time or only with permission from a judge.\nIn France, along with many other countries, the collec-\ntion and sorting of data for commercial and judicial\npurposes is common place. The state of emergency\nallows for these practices of information gathering by\nthe police to take place without the normal judicial\nrestraint.\nDeferred decision making from state to algorithm is\nelaborated by Dan McQuillan in ``Algorithmic states of\nexception.'' Drawing from Agamben's notion of homo\nsacer, McQuillan urges us ``to look at the nature of the\nmaterial-political apparatus that connects data to deci-\nsion-making and governance'' (p. 565). For Agamben's\nthesis that Western law has placed nation-states in a\npermanent state of exception, there is perhaps no\nbetter example than France's ever-extending state of\nemergency. Ontologically this state of exception puts\nthe state in a position of ``being-outside and yet belong-\ning'' which McQuillan correlates to the nature of\nalgorithms in governance. The tension of power from\nabove versus below, and inside versus outside, are\nbrought up once again. Since the sovereign nation-\nstate can both make laws and exempt itself from\nthem, it is both outside the purview of its own laws,\nwhile being fundamentally bound to their creation. As\nterrorism threatens to undermine the foundations of\nthe western nation-state, the state must reciprocally cir-\ncumvent its own legal system to defend itself.\nFor McQuillan, the fear is that ``the new algorithmic\napparatus can be characterized by the production of\nstates of exception'' (p. 578) indicating not just a lack\nof legal protection, but a fundamental inability of law\nto deal with these issues since they are themselves legal.\nThis means that the somewhat autonomous nature of\nthese algorithmic apparatuses has the potential to be as\nungovernable as the state itself. Expanding on this def-\ninition of algorithmic states of exception, the example\nof i2AN highlights ways that algorithms can alter and\nexacerbate states of exception that are not their own.\nIt is not that i2AN has created its own state of excep-\ntion, but rather that it has been embedded into that of\nthe state, with the same extrajudicial predicament as the\noriginal homo sacer in Ancient Greece. i2AN creates the\nvisual and geographic boundaries for a state that treats\n8 Big Data & Society\nits subjects as data-mining opportunities. Above, it was\nthe state itself that was treated as ``being-outside yet\nbelonging,'' but it is through this relation that\nAgamben points to the state's ability to use measures\nsuch as a state of emergency to render its own subjects\nas also ``being-outside yet belonging.'' Being the subject\nof extrajudicial house raids and arrests situates citizens\nbelonging to the state at the same time as it removes\nthem from the regular judicial system, the being-outside\nthe law. The ability to split the subject in this way is an\nexample of algorithmic identity dividing the individual\ninto multiple dividual parts. Algorithmic identity is\nblurred at the level of the dividual, being outside of\nspecific categories, yet each subject has the potential\nto be the homo sacer, or the terrorist. It is in this\nsense that the police raid and house arrest, as tactic\nof the state of emergency, creates the homo sacer. The\ncriminality is undetermined at first, with the raid ser-\nving as an identity adjustment period through data\nextraction and analysis. For some this adjustment\ncomes quickly, but for others, this liminal period of\nhouse arrest can last over a year (Pascual, 2016b).\nConclusion\nThe role that algorithms play in policing during the state\nof emergency in France is complex and subject to con-\nstant change. From a theoretical standpoint, the oper-\nations of i2AN's lists-plus-algorithm and its visual\ncomponent challenge ontological conceptions of indi-\nvidual state subjects. I have attempted to show how\nthe creation of dividual state subjects and data doubles,\nthrough algorithms can be used for hard state power, or\ndiscipline, as well as soft biopolitics or surveillance. Not\nonly are the data-driven police raids a clear form of\nhard, disciplinary power, but they also expose the\nbasis through which posthegemonic soft power regimes\nof control are created. Just as the carrot rarely works\nwithout the threat of the stick, it is also the stick that\nmakes one interested in the carrot in the first place.\nThis analysis of i2AN is only a glimpse of the differ-\nent roles played by algorithm and the state. I argue that\nthe data sorting and mining capabilities of i2AN allow\ndata collection to be a feasible means of policing, which\nhas taken the form of raids and house arrests during the\nstate of emergency. The form of data extraction reflects\nthe technical protocol of i2AN, just as the state of\nemergency reflects the administrative protocol of the\nliberal nation-state. A task for further research is an\nin-depth look at how police analysts directly interact\nwith i2AN and what effect that has had on police oper-\nations. Considering the ways in which social conditions\ninfluence relationships between decision making and\ntechnology is incredibly valuable and can add much\nto the theoretical grounding presented in this paper.\nRaids and house arrests provide the French police\nwith a massive amount of information about a select\npopulation that they would not have without the legal\nexemptions of the state of emergency. With a justice\nsystem that is both racially and religiously discrimin-\natory, the data extraction taking place exacerbates\nexisting inequalities and has the potential to do so\neven after the state of emergency comes to an end.\nTheories of postpanopticon surveillance or posthege-\nmonic power get us part of the way in understanding\nhow control is mediated through algorithms but they\nmust not neglect theories of hegemony that came before\nthem. To develop a framework for how algorithms\ninfluence power, surveillance, and identity, we must\ncontinue to refine and develop theory that reflects con-\ntemporary examples of policing such as France's state\nof emergency.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
