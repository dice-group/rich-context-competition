This study examined 258 due process hearings held over the past 8 years in Massachusetts to\nexamine the characteristics of students at the center of these disputes, the issues that were addressed in the hearings, and\nthe representation utilized by parents and school districts. The findings from this study indicated that (a) Massachusetts\nschool districts utilized attorney representation and won due process hearings at notably higher levels than parents, and (b)\nthe most frequently addressed issues at due process hearings were Individualized Education Program (IEP) development/\nimplementation and educational program placement, which are issues that represent the core mandate of IDEA to provide\nrecommendations for policy actions and areas for future research.\n",

As part of the process for ensuring\nthat children with disabilities receive this level of educa-\ntional service, IDEA outlines both procedural and substan-\ntive requirements that must be met by school districts\n(Drasgow, Yell, & Robinson, 2001). Procedural requirements\ninclude processes such as including parents in decision-mak-\ning processes and adhering to timelines for evaluation and\nprogram development. Substantive requirements address\nissues of quality and appropriateness, including the content\nof each eligible child's Individualized Education Program\n(IEP), the types of special education and related services pro-\nvided, and the selection of the educational environment(s) at\nwhich services are provided.\nResearch has demonstrated that school districts often\nstruggle to meet the procedural and substantive requirements\nof special education law (Drasgow et al., 2001), including\nthe provision that stipulates that parents should be included\nas participants in the educational decision-making process\nSalas, 2004; Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Javitz, & Valdes,\nflicts arise between parents and school personnel regarding\nthe development of IEPs or the implementation of education\nservices, IDEA (2004) outlines a process for dispute resolu-\ntion. There are three formal procedures for resolving special\neducation disputes: mediation, resolution meetings, and due\nprocess hearings. Mediation is the least adversarial and most\npro-active of these options (Mueller, 2009; Zirkel &\nMcGuire, 2010). In mediation, both sides utilize an impartial\nmediator to resolve their differences and reach a mutually\nacceptable agreement. Mediation is a voluntary process, and\nany agreements resulting from this process are developed\nthrough cooperation and compromise between the parties.\nThe other two formal resolution procedures identified in\nIDEA are resolution meetings and due process hearings.\nResolution meetings are a relatively recent addition, having\nbeen included in IDEA during the 2004 reauthorization in an\n1Lewis University, Romeoville, IL, USA\n2Attorney-at-Law, Crown Point, IN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nWilliam H.

Resolution meetings are manda-\ntory if a parent has filed for due process and any agreements\nreached are binding (IDEA, 2004b). If the resolution meeting\nis not successful in solving the existing dispute, then the third\nformal resolution procedure outlined in IDEA is enacted.\nDue process hearings include all of the formal elements of\ndispute resolution, including review of evidence, written\nand/or oral testimony, and the frequent use of attorney repre-\nfinal judgment comes from a hearing officer, and the results\nare legally binding.\nOf the three formal dispute resolution procedures pro-\nvided by IDEA (2004), due process hearings are the most\ncostly in terms of time, fiscal resources, and impact on rela-\ntionships between school personnel and parents (Cope-\nhigh as US$50,000 per hearing, with an average cost running\n2009). Despite these considerable costs, the number of due\nprocess hearings across the nation rose steadily in the 1990s\nremained at a high level of over 2,000 hearings annually dur-\n2010). The number of hearings is not evenly distributed\nacross all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In the most\nrecent state-by-state analysis, Zirkel and Scala (2010) found\nthat nine states and the District of Columbia accounted for\nthrough 2009. The nine states were New York, Connecticut,\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Hawaii, Texas,\nMassachusetts, and Illinois.\nGiven the high volume of due process hearings, their sig-\nnificant financial costs, and the negative impact on parent\u00ad\nschool relationships, it is important to further examine the\nexisting research on this IDEA dispute resolution procedure.\nOver the past 15 years, research on due process hearings has\naddressed the disability characteristics of children at the cen-\nter of the disputes, the issues addressed during the hearings,\nthe prevailing parties, and the extent to which legal and lay\nrepresentation was utilized by the disputing parties. Regarding\nthe characteristics of children involved in due process hear-\nings, Mueller and Carranza (2011) reported that students with\nspecific learning disabilities and students with autism spec-\ntrum disorders were at issue in just under half of 575 due pro-\ncess hearings held in 41 states. Students categorized as having\nother health impairments, emotional disturbance, or intellec-\ntual disabilities were the next most frequently occurring\ngroups in the hearings. This finding was consistent with a pre-\nvious study (Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999) that identified stu-\ndents with learning disabilities as the largest disability group\nrepresented in due process hearings. The Newcomer and\nZirkel (1999) study had an unexpected finding in that stu-\ndents with multiple disabilities were involved in 17% of the\nhearings in their sample, as compared with these students\nrepresenting only 1.9% of the overall population of students\nreceiving special education services. This finding was not\nsupported by the Mueller and Carranza (2011) study.\nPrevious research on special education due process hear-\nings has consistently found that the most frequent issues at\ndispute involve educational placement, IEPs, assessment/\nevaluation, and service delivery (Cope-Kasten, 2013;\nrepresented almost half of the due process hearings exam-\nfrom Minnesota and Wisconsin over a 12-year period, and\nsimilarly found that IEP (47%) and placement (35%) were\nfrequently occurring issues. The author also reported that\nservice provision (42%) and evaluation (38%) were common\ndue process hearings in Iowa over a 12-year period. The\nmost frequently occurring issues were placement (46%) and\nResearch that has examined the prevailing parties in due\nprocess hearings has yielded inconsistent results. Two earlier\ncated that parents prevailed on a majority of issues addressed\nat hearings. However, subsequent research (Cope-Kasten,\nRickey, 2003) has demonstrated that school districts prevail\non the largest portion of issues in due process hearings.\nFurthermore, Cope-Kasten (2013) examined the parties'suc-\ncesses by type of representation. The author found that in\ncases where parents did not have attorney representation,\nschool districts prevailed in 98% of the hearings. When par-\nents did have attorney representation, school districts pre-\nvailed in 64% of the hearings. In an earlier study on\nrepresentation, Kuriloff and Goldberg (1997) reported that\nparents perceived that they had more relative power in the\ndispute than parents who used a lay advocate or represented\nthemselves. Ahearn (2002) found that many states did not\ncollect on data on representation at due process hearings, and\nthat those that did collect data reported that there were issues\nwith securing affordable attorneys for parents.\nPurpose and Research Questions\nGiven the continued high volume of due process hearings\nconducted annually in the United States and the relatively\nlimited amount of research conducted in this area (Reiman\net al., 2007), additional research on due process hearings can\npotentially benefit a wide range of stakeholders. These stake-\nholders include children with disabilities, their parents, edu-\ncators, advocates, attorneys, researchers, and policy makers.\nParticularly with another reauthorization of IDEA on the\nhorizon, continued research in this area is timely and impor-\ntant. The authors wanted to build on the previous research by\nconducting a longitudinal study of due process hearings\nBlackwell and Blackwell 3\nwithin a state that continues to have consistently high vol-\numes of hearings each year. It was hoped that by engaging in\nan in-depth study of due process hearings within a state that\nconsistently has a high number of due process hearings,\ninformation can be uncovered that would shed light on\npotential ways to effectively resolve conflicts sooner and at a\nlower fiscal and relationship cost than occurs during due pro-\ncess hearings.\nAfter consulting the existing research on the number of\ndue process hearings held in each state (Zirkel & Gischlar,\nMassachusetts as the target state. Massachusetts ranked in\nthe top 10 states nationally in the number of hearings held\nannually and ranked 12th nationally in the number of hear-\nings held per capita (Zirkel & Gischlar, 2008). The authors\nalso had a more personal reason for selecting Massachusetts\nas the focus of this study. Both authors had previously\nworked in special education service provision and disability\nadvocacy in Massachusetts at the local and state levels.\nAlthough the authors no longer work within the state, there\nremains a vested interest in trying to uncover information\nthat may lead to more collaborative dispute resolution, as\nwell as improved procedures and services for students that\ncan prevent disputes from arising in the first place. Having\nworked in multiple states, the authors felt that the results\nfrom a study on due process hearings in Massachusetts could\nalso inform and benefit stakeholders in other jurisdictions.\nWith the considerable costs of special education litiga-\ntion (Daggett, 2004) and the findings from previous research\nthat indicated school districts win a notable majority of due\nprocess hearings (Cope-Kasten, 2013; Lupini & Zirkel,\nfelt it was important to examine the extent to which parents\nobtain legal and lay representation, and to determine if there\nwere any patterns in the frequency of use of representation\nover time. The authors were also interested in examining a\nhigh volume of due process hearings over a number of years\nto determine if there were any trends in the types of issues\nthat were brought to due process hearings and the character-\nistics of students who were the subject of these hearings.\nThe following research questions were developed to guide\nthe study:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Student characteristics: What were the characteristics\nof students who were the focus of due process hear-\nings, including disability categories, grade levels, and\neducational placements? Were there trends in these\ncharacteristics over time?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Issues: What were the issues addressed in due process\nhearings? Were there trends in these issues over time?\nHow often did parents and school districts prevail on\neach of these issues?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Representation: How often do parents and school\ndistricts utilize legal and lay representation at due\nprocess hearings? Were there trends in types of\nrepresentation over time? How often did parents and\nschool districts with different types of representation\nprevail in due process hearings?\nMethod\nData Source\nThe data set for this study was all written due process hearing\ndecisions issued by the Massachusetts Bureau of Special\nEducation Appeals (BSEA; n.d.) from July 1, 2005 through\nJune 30, 2013. The authors felt that selecting a starting point\nof July 1, 2005 provided data that would primarily include\ndisputes arising since the most recent reauthorization of\nIDEA in 2004. Data collection was straightforward as all\nhearing decisions in Massachusetts are available to the pub-\nlic via the BSEA's website. Each written decision file was\ndownloaded and an Excel database was created to manage\ndata entry, coding, and analysis. A total of 258 hearing deci-\nsions were identified and included in the analysis. There\nwere an additional 23 hearing decisions that were excluded\nfrom the study because they only addressed disputes between\nschool districts related to financial responsibility for stu-\ndents' special education programs.\nCoding and Analysis\nAfter identifying the 258 due process hearing decisions,\neach hearing file was logged in the project database. The\ninformation logged for each case included the case number,\nfiscal year (based on a July 1 to June 30 schedule), hearing\nofficer who issued the decision, and the school district name.\nEach written hearing decision was then read and coded. The\ninitial code set was informed by previous published research\non due process hearings and judicial outcomes (Cope-\nknowledge and experience with special education dispute\nresolution. The initial definitions for the codes were refined\nand additional codes were identified during the establish-\nment of intercoder reliability and during ongoing conversa-\ntions between the two principal investigators. The final code\nset was as follows:\n1. Legal representation--The type of representation\nused by each party (attorney, pro se with advocate/\nconsultant support, pro se).\n2. School level--School level of the student at question\nin the dispute at the time of the due process hearing\n(preschool, elementary, middle school, high school,\npost\u00adhigh school).\n3. Primary disability category--Primary disability of the\nstudent as stated in the written hearing decision. In\ncases in which the student presented with multiple dis-\nabilities, the code \"multiple\" was used. For purposes\n4 SAGE Open\nof this study, the terminology for the disability catego-\nries used was taken from the Massachusetts special\neducation regulations.\n4. Educational program placement--The educational\nenvironment for the student at the time of the hearing\nrequest.\n5. Prevailing party--The prevailing party for each issue\n(district, parent, mixed).An example of a mixed deci-\nsion was a due process hearing in which related ser-\nvices were an issue. In this instance, the parent won\nthe portion of the issue focused on physical therapy\nservices, and the school district won the portion of\nthe issue focused on occupational therapy services.\n6. Issues--The identified issue(s) in dispute. Each sepa-\nrate issue addressed within a due process hearing was\ncoded. The subcodes for issues were as follows.\na. Evaluation--Evaluation process and proce-\ndures for determining areas of need and poten-\ntial services, including independent education\nevaluations and the selection/qualifications of\nevaluators.\nb. Extended school year services--Special educa-\ntion and related services provided to eligible stu-\ndents beyond the typical 10-month academic year.\nc. Identification--Eligibility determination for\nspecial education services.\nd. IEP--Components and development of the IEP,\ncommonly examined to determine the extent to\nwhich the IEP was calculated to provide a free\nappropriate public education in the least restric-\ntive environment.\ne. Placement--Location of special education ser-\nvices for a student, including services provided\nin general education settings and specialized set-\ntings that will provide the student access to the\ngeneral education environment to the appropri-\nate extent; includes unilateral placement of stu-\ndent by parent.\nf. Procedural safeguards--Procedural protec-\ntions afforded to students, parents, and schools\nthrough federal and state special education laws\nand regulations; included timelines, parental\nconsent, and written notices.\ng. Related services--Developmental, rehabilita-\ntive, corrective, and supportive services that are\nnecessary to assist a student in accessing and\nbenefiting from special and general education\nservices; included specialized transportation,\noccupational therapy, physical therapy, and ori-\nentation and mobility services.\nh. Suspension/expulsion--Removal of a student\nfrom the agreed-upon placement due to disci-\nplinary actions; included both in-school and out-\nof-school suspensions.\ni. Transition--Practices and procedures related\nto transition planning for secondary students to\nassist in developing the knowledge, skills, and\nstrategies for accessing and benefiting from\npost-secondary opportunities such a college,\nemployment, independent living, and commu-\nnity participation.\nThere were a limited number of instances in which a vari-\nable could not be assigned a code because the information\nwas not provided in the written decision. For these instances,\nthe data was recorded as \"not indicated.\"\nThe two authors were equally responsible for all of the\ndata collection, coding, and analysis. To refine codes and to\nestablish intercoder reliability, an initial set of 20 hearings\nwas randomly selected and coded by both authors. After\nmeeting to compare codes and refine the code book, the\nauthors then re-coded these 20 hearing decisions plus an\nadditional 32 hearing decisions (for a total of 20% of the\nsample). Intercoder reliability was calculated based on these\n52 hearing decisions using a formula recommended by Miles\nand Huberman (1994): Reliability = (Number of agreements) /\n(Total number of agreements plus disagreements). The final\nintercoder reliability calculation was 98.1%. Throughout the\nentire coding and analysis process, the authors frequently\ndiscussed any questions regarding codes and often examined\nportions of hearings together to ensure that an agreed-upon\ncode was assigned. All data were recorded in a master data-\nbase to better facilitate analysis and reporting. As the pur-\npose of this study was to present and describe population\ndata from due process hearings over time, descriptive statis-\ntics were deemed most appropriate for the analyses (Vogt,\nFindings\nCharacteristics of Students in Due Process\nHearings\nThe 258 special education due process hearings were ana-\nlyzed to determine the characteristics of students at the cen-\nter of these disputes, including their primary disability\ncategories, grade levels, and educational program place-\nments at the time of the hearing request. These data are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nOver the 8-year period of this study, the most common\ndisability categories were multiple disabilities (29.1%), fol-\nlowed by specific learning disabilities (23.6%), autism\nother disability categories were present in less than 50% of\nthe hearings. Regarding trends in disability categories over\ntime, there were three notable items. The percentage of stu-\ndents with multiple disabilities were markedly higher from\nfiscal year (FY)10 to FY13 than in earlier years, with per-\nBlackwell and Blackwell 5\nand 55.6% in FY13. The percentage of students with specific\nlearning disabilities declined steadily from FY07 to FY13.\nThe percentage was 44.7% in FY07, and then moved to\nThe third notable item was the decline in the percentage of\nstudents with emotional/behavioral impairments in due pro-\ncess hearings. The percentage was 28.0% in FY06, moved to\nThe grade levels of students at the center of due process\nhearings were relatively evenly distributed. There were\nat the middle school level, 36.0% at the high school level,\nand 5.4% at the post\u00adhigh school level (e.g., students ages\n19-21 in transition programs). Trend analysis indicated that\nstudents at the post\u00adhigh school grade levels were repre-\nsented in due process hearings at a high point of 13.5% (5\nhearings) in FY09, and then have declined to being involved\nin no hearings in either FY12 or FY13. No other potential\ntrends were identified in these data.\nThe students' educational program placements at the time\nof the hearing request were also examined. The most fre-\nquent placements were general education classrooms with\ninclusive and/or resource room support services (44.2%),\nfollowed by separate public or private day schools (18.6%),\nsubstantially separate special education classrooms within\nthe public school (17.4%), and residential/hospital programs\n(11.6%). Longitudinal analyses indicated a potential trend in\nthe type of educational program placement for students\ninvolved in due process hearings. From FY11 to FY13, there\nwere declines in the percentages of students placed in gen-\neral education classrooms with inclusive/resource supports\nstudents placed in substantially separate classrooms with\nTable 1.

There\naddressed 2 issues, and 55 hearings that addressed 3 or more\nissues. The number of issues addressed annually peaked in\nin due process hearings is presented in Table 2.\nThe most frequently addressed issues in due process hear-\nings were related to the development and content of IEPs\ntwo areas were the most common issues in each of the 8\nyears examined. IEP and student placement were also fre-\nquently addressed in the same hearings. The two were identi-\nThe next most frequently addressed issues were procedural\nsafeguards (10.3%), evaluation (8.5%), and related services\n(7.7%). There were no trends in these areas over the 8 years,\nbut it should be noted that evaluation had a 1-year spike in\nFY10 (16.0% of all issues that year). The issues of identifica-\ntion, extended school year services, suspension/expulsion,\nand transition were all under 3.0% of the total issues\naddressed. The only change over time in these areas was with\nextended school year services. Since FY10, only 1 due pro-\ncess hearing has addressed this area as an issue. Of the 9\ntransition-related issues, 5 of these were presented in hear-\nings during FY09. No other year had more than one transi-\ntion issue addressed at a due process hearing.\nThe due process hearings were also examined to deter-\nmine the prevailing parties on each issue. While one of either\nthe school district or parent typically prevailed on an issue,\nthere were some instances in which the hearing officer pre-\nsented a mixed decision in which both parties prevailed on\nvarious aspects of the same issue. The data on prevailing par-\nties were analyzed in the aggregate for the 8-year period of\nthis study, as the majority of the issue cells had n-sizes that\nwere too small to be usefully examined by individual fiscal\nyear. Table 3 presents the data on prevailing party by issue.\nOverall, school districts prevailed on 62.5% of all issues,\nparents prevailed on 27.2% of issues, and a mixed decision\nwas issued on 10.3% of the issues. When examined by issue,\nthe range of issues on which school districts prevailed\nextended from 50.0% of issues involving suspension/expul-\nsion to 71.4% of issues involving evaluation. The percentage\nof issues in which parents prevailed ranged from 14.3% of\nissues involving evaluation to 50.0% of issues involving sus-\npension/expulsion. Besides evaluation and suspension/\nexpulsion, there were no issues in which it appeared one\nparty prevailed out of proportion to the overall rate of suc-\ncess on all issues combined. The issue of placement was fur-\nther examined to determine the outcomes of these issues\nwhen parents had unilaterally placed the student prior to the\ndue process hearing. In the 48 hearings in which this situa-\ntion was evident, districts prevailed on 27 issues related to\nunilateral placement by the parent (56.3%), parents prevailed\non 15 issues (31.2%), and a mixed decision was presented on\n6 unilateral placement issues (12.5%). These percentages\nwere consistent with the overall success rate of these parties\non other issues related to placement.\nTable 2.

In all 258 hearings (100%) from\nFY06 to FY13, school districts utilized attorney representa-\ntion. Over this same time period, parents had attorney repre-\nsentation in 40.3% of due process hearings, represented\nthemselves pro se in 103 hearings (39.9%) and utilized advo-\nings (4.7%), parents did not participate.

The two lowest\nyears for parent use of attorney representation were in FY13\nwith FY08, parents represented themselves pro se with or\nwithout advocate support in over 50.0% of the due process\nhearings. In the final 2 years of this study, parents were pro\nse with or without advocate support in 61.8% (FY12) and\nThe due process hearings were also analyzed to determine\nhow often the parties won with different types of representa-\ntion. As the n-sizes for parent representation cells were small\nin most years, these data were analyzed in the aggregate of\nthe 8 years of the study. For purposes of this analysis, a party\nwas deemed to have won a due process hearing if that party\nprevailed on all issues. If both parties prevailed on separate\nissues within a hearing, then the outcome was coded as\n\"mixed.\" The data on prevailing party by type of representa-\ntion is presented in Table 5.\nSchool districts had attorney representation in all 258 due\nprocess hearings, and won 55.0% of these hearings.

First, this study\nwas restricted to one state, Massachusetts. Although the\nauthors believe that the findings from this study can inform\nand benefit stakeholders in other states, the fact remains that\nthis research is embedded within the context of a single state\njurisdiction. Another limitation relates to inconsistencies in\nthe level of detail provided in the written hearing decisions\nover the 8 years of this study. A total of 10 hearing officers\nissued written hearing decisions, and each officer utilized a\nslightly different format and sometimes marked differences\nin the level of descriptiveness. In other instances, the same\nhearing officer provided a high level of detail in one hearing\nbut a lesser level of detail in another. The authors of this\nstudy particularly found it difficult to identify and code the\nprimary disability category of students. Decisions issued in\nmore recent years provided less straightforward statements\nof the primary disability category indicated on the student's\nIEP, and instead provided greater levels of descriptiveness\nregarding evaluation report findings, witness testimony, and\nareas of student need. When it was not clear that one disabil-\nity category was primary, these data were coded as \"multiple\ndisabilities.\" The potential impact of this issue on the data set\nis addressed below in a discussion of the findings related to\nstudent disability categories.\nImplications and Areas for Future Research\nThe disproportionate percentage of issues and hearings on\nwhich Massachusetts school districts prevail is an area for\nconcern. Over the 8 years of this study, school districts\nprevailed in 55.0% of hearings and received a mixed decision\nin an additional 24.4%. When disaggregated to the level of\nspecific issues addressed in hearings, school districts pre-\nvailed on 62.5% of all issues and received a mixed decision in\nan additional 10.3%. This finding is consistent with research\nfrom four other studies conducted in the past 15 years in other\nThe authors of this study theorize that the unbalanced\nresults in outcomes could be the result of unequal access to\nprofessional legal advice and representation. This can affect\nthe outcome of special education disputes in two ways. First,\nthere is the possibility that inadequate information and legal\nadvice is available to parents when making decisions on\nwhether to take a dispute to due process hearing. The find-\nings in this study indicated that parents were more likely to\nrepresent themselves with or without advocate support than\nthey were to enlist attorney representation. When parents did\nrepresent themselves, they frequently did not win, prevailing\nin only 10.7% of hearings in which they represented them-\nselves pro se and 20.5% of hearings in which they were pro\nse with advocate support. In this case, we are seeing high\nvolumes of parents with access to limited information choos-\ning to take issues into a very costly and time-consuming pro-\ncess in which they will often not prevail. Another possibility\nis that school districts have greater access to professional\nexpertise and legal representation that provide effective sup-\nports for determining which issues to take to due process and\nfor presenting evidence and arguments at the hearings. In this\nstudy, school districts utilized attorney representation in\n100% of the due process hearings and prevailed in the major-\nity of hearings and on the majority of issues.\nBased on these findings, the authors agree with Cope-\nmay not represent a fair means of resolving special education\ndisputes. At the most fundamental level, it appears that par-\nents are not able and/or willing to access the same level of\nprofessional legal expertise that school districts access. A\nmajor factor in this issue is likely due to the real or perceived\ncosts of attorney representation. State government initiatives\nto create programs that provide pro bono attorney representa-\ntion for parents could be one possibility for alleviating this\nissue. A potential area for future research is to examine avail-\nable programs across states to determine the extent to which\naffordable attorney representation is provided for parents.\nThis research could be an important update to earlier research\nfrom Ahearn (2002) that found that states that did collect\ndata on attorney representation reported issues with securing\naffordable representation for families.\nA stated goal of this study was to uncover information\nfrom due process hearings that could shed light on potential\nways to effectively resolve conflicts sooner and at a lower\nfiscal and relationship cost than occurs during due process\nhearings. As Mueller (2009) has suggested, the use of alter-\nnative dispute resolution strategies such as IEP facilitation,\nTable 5.

However, the authors of this study found\nvery limited information available in the written hearing\ndecisions regarding the extent to which alternative dispute\nresolution procedures had been attempted or the types of pro-\ncedures that had been utilized. This is an area for future\nresearch, both within Massachusetts and across other juris-\ndictions. Additional research in this area could potentially\nhelp make the case that the next reauthorization of IDEA\nshould include provisions that require school personnel and\nparents to demonstrate that they have attempted multiple\nalternative dispute resolution strategies prior to any case\nmoving forward to a due process hearing. Although the reso-\nlution meeting requirement that was added in 2004 was a\nmove in the right direction, further steps likely need to be\ntaken that address potential disagreements much earlier in\nthe process.\nThe findings from this study indicate that many of the\nissuesaddressedduringdueprocesshearingsinMassachusetts\nare related to IEP development/implementation and educa-\ntional program placement. This finding is consistent with\nprevious studies in other locations from Cope-Kasten (2013),\nand Rickey (2003). This is an important issue to address as it\ndirectly relates to the IDEA mandate of providing eligible\nstudents with a free appropriate public education in the least\nthat there is a need to reconsider the effectiveness of the pro-\ncess for developing IEPs and determining the educational\nenvironment for students receiving special education ser-\nvices. Research on the development and quality of IEPs has\nconsistently demonstrated that (a) schools struggle to meet\nthe procedural requirements associated with IEP develop-\nment, (b) IEPs are often not individualized to meet the unique\nneeds of each child, and (c) parents are often not meaningful\nparticipants in the program development process (see\nBlackwell & Rossetti, 2014, for a review of literature on IEP\ndevelopment). The previous research on education place-\nment has presented a picture of legal, programmatic, and\nphilosophical challenges related to determining the least\nrestrictive environment for students (Kavale & Forness,\n2000). Future research across multiple states could focus\nmore directly on issues related to IEP development/imple-\nmentation and educational program placement within the\ncontext of due process hearings. The research could poten-\ntially enable state policy makers and authors of the next\nIDEA reauthorization to find ways to promote more collab-\norative models for student program development.\nThe findings related to student characteristics presented a\nfew potentially noteworthy issues. First, the data indicated\nthat there has been an increase in recent years in the percent-\nage of disputes involving students in outside placements\nsuch as public and private day schools, residential schools,\nand hospital settings. The authors feel that this is not surpris-\ning, and it is likely that more disputes would arise involving\nthe placement of students in higher cost settings. Future\nresearch could focus on this issue in other state contexts to\ndetermine if a larger pattern is emerging.\nSecond, the data indicated that there were a high percent-\nage of students with multiple disabilities (29.1%), with a\nmarked increase over the past 4 years. This finding was con-\nsistent with earlier research in other jurisdictions from\nNewcomer and Zirkel (1999), but was not supported by later\nresearch from Mueller and Carranza (2011). As discussed in\nthe limitations section, there were inconsistencies and a gen-\neral lack of clarity in the ways that disability information was\ndescribed in the written hearing decisions. As a result of this\nlack of consistency and clarity, the authors may have used\nthe \"multiple disabilities\" code during analysis more fre-\nquently than IEP teams would typically use this category\nduring eligibility determination processes. However, even\nwith this caution in mind, the authors believe that it stands to\nreason that there could be increased disagreement on the\nmethods and approaches for educating students with more\ncomplex educational support needs, such as those students\nidentified as having multiple disabilities. As the amount of\nresearch continues to expand on human cognition and devel-\nopment, the amount of available information and theories on\nhow best to respond to this information also expands. This\nscenario could result in an increase in competing theories on\neducational supports for students with multiple, complex dis-\nabilities. Additional research is needed on this issue. A multi-\nstate study that more closely examines due process hearings\ninvolving students with multiple disabilities could shed fur-\nther light onto this issue.\nFinally, the data indicated that there has been a steady\ndecline in the percentage of due process hearings that\ninvolved students with specific learning disabilities (44.7%\nand students with emotional/behavioral impairments (28.0%\nhypothesize that there could be two potential explanations\nfor these apparent trends. One possibility is that school dis-\ntrict personnel and parents are utilizing the increasing amount\nof research available on how to best educate and support stu-\ndents with specific learning disabilities and students with\nemotional/behavioral impairments. As the available knowl-\nedge base is increasing and becoming more widely available,\nparties are better able to make effective programmatic and\nplacement decisions, thereby reducing the number of poten-\ntial disagreements that could result in due process hearings.\nThe other possibility is that the challenges with coding the\nprimary disability category during the analysis phase of this\nstudy may explain the apparent decrease in the percentage of\nstudents with emotional/behavioral disabilities and specific\nlearning disabilities involved in due process hearings. In re-\nchecking the disability codes used from FY09 to FY13, the\nauthors noted that the due process hearing decisions written\nin these years frequently provided detailed descriptions of\nboth the academic and emotional/behavioral challenges\nfaced by students, but often did not include a clear statement\nof the primary disability category. The authors coded these\ncases as \"multiple disabilities,\" when it could be the case that\nthe student IEP identified one specific primary disability cat-\negory. Additional research is needed before any reasonable\nconclusions can be reached regarding the prevalence of stu-\ndents with specific learning disabilities and students with\nemotional/behavioral disabilities involved in due process\nhearings.\nConclusion\nOf the three formal dispute resolution procedures provided\nby IDEA (2004), due process hearings are the most costly\nin terms of time, fiscal resources, and impact on relation-\nships between school personnel and parents (Cope-Kasten,\ncated that Massachusetts school districts utilized attorney\nrepresentation and won due process hearings at notably\nhigher levels than parents. The findings also indicated that\nthe most frequently addressed issues at due process hear-\nings were IEP development/implementation and educa-\ntional program placement, which are issues that represent\nthe core mandate of IDEA to provide a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment (IDEA,\npresented in this article can help inform practices in\nMassachusetts and other state settings so that special edu-\ncation disputes are addressed sooner and more effectively,\nthereby resulting in more equitable dispute outcomes for\nparents and school districts.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nturn around forum.
