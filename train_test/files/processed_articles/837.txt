The purpose of this analysis was to examine the association of sociodemographic variables and health-\nrelated conditions with 5-year declines in cognitive function among Mexican American elderly persons.\nMethods. The cognitive function of 1759 participants was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination\nbelow on the MMSE at follow-up, and (2) a decline of at least three points, the mean change in MMSE scores among re-\nspondents who obtained scores at or above the 5th percentile distribution at baseline.\nResults. Cognitive decline was significantly associated with sociodemographic variables including age, education,\nmarital status, and household composition. In addition, respondents with reported vision impairment, stroke, and diabe-\ntes were at increased risk for cognitive decline after controlling for multiple potential confounders.\nConclusion. Although age and education have been reported as the more salient predictors of cognitive deterioration,\nother sociodemographic and several medical conditions including stroke and diabetes should be considered as part of\ncognitive aging studies among Mexican American elders.\nECENT literature has focused on understanding fac-\ntors predicting decline in cognitive function among\nnormal older adults (1\u00ad4). This research has focused pre-\ndominantly upon non-Hispanic white elders. Little attention\nhas been paid to other ethnic minority groups, particularly\nHispanic elders. The Hispanic population of the United\nStates is one of the fastest growing minorities and is ex-\npected to surpass African Americans to become the largest\nminority group sometime this decade (5). Understanding\ncognitive decline in this expanding population is of major\npublic health importance (2,6).\nData from longitudinal studies have suggested that, in\ngeneral, older age (7), lower education level (8), higher ini-\ntial levels of cognitive performance (9,10), and higher de-\npressive symptomatology (11,12) are associated with higher\nrates of cognitive decline. In addition, several studies have\nsuggested that certain medical conditions, such as hyperten-\nsion (13), stroke (14), diabetes (4), and hearing and visual\nimpairment (15), are associated with cognitive decline and\nindirectly with the incidence of possible dementia.\nAlthough the aforementioned findings may generally\nhold for non-Hispanic whites, it is unclear as to how these\nfindings can be generalized to other subpopulations, such as\n . A limited number of studies have\nfound a significantly higher prevalence of cognitive impair-\nment among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites\n(4,16). In a recent study of older  , Black\nand colleagues (17) documented significant associations be-\ntween sociodemographic variables, comorbid disease states,\nand cognitive performance. These findings, however, were\nbased on cross-sectional data.\nThe purpose of the present study was to extend the earlier\nwork reported by Black and colleagues (17) by examining\ncognitive decline in a large probability-based community\nsample of older   residing in the South-\nwestern United States. Specifically, we are interested in ex-\namining (1) changes in cognitive function in older Mexican\nAmericans over a 5-year period; (2) demographic variables\nsuch as age, gender, education, immigration status, house-\nhold composition, and marital status that may predict cogni-\ntive decline; and (3) whether a group of health-related con-\nditions measured at baseline can predict cognitive decline at\n5-year follow-up. That is, do health-related characteristics,\nincluding depressive symptoms and medical conditions, add\nto the prediction of cognitive decline after the effects of so-\nciodemographic variables have been controlled?\nMETHODS\nSample\nData used in this study were part of the Hispanic Estab-\nlished Population for the Epidemiological Study of the El-\nderly (Hispanic EPESE), a population-based survey of older\n  residing in the Southwestern United\nStates. A full description of the rationale, methods, and sub-\nject characteristics of this study can be found elsewhere\n  aged 65 and older representing approx-\nNew Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California in\nceased, 312 were lost to follow-up, and 127 refused to be re-\nR\ninterviewed. In addition, 224 subjects were excluded from\nthe analyses because they were unable to answer one or\nmore cognitive-related items as a result of physical limita-\ntions (such as being too ill, being blind, or being impaired\nby arthritis). Thus, the final sample consisted of 1759 sub-\njects with complete data at both baseline and follow-up. All\ninterviews were conducted either in Spanish or English, de-\npending on the respondent's preference, by interviewers who\nwere fully bilingual and predominantly of Hispanic origin.\nMeasures\nThe primary outcome measure was the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE). The MMSE is among the most fre-\nquently used cognitive screening measures in studies of\nolder adults (19). This instrument has been used extensively\nin community surveys, nursing home studies, longitudinal\nstudies of aging, and in clinical investigation (20). Using\nconventional cut-points, the MMSE has consistently yielded\ncorrect classification rates of 80% to 90% when compared\nwith physician assessments of cognitive impairment and de-\nThe English and Spanish versions of the MMSE were\nadopted from the Diagnostic Interview Scale (DIS) used in\nprior community surveys (22). This Spanish version of the\nMMSE has met standard criteria for development of trans-\nlated tests, including formal translation, back-translation,\nand consensus by committee for final item content. Addi-\ntionally, the Spanish MMSE has been successfully used in\ncommunity surveys of   (23). Owing to\nreported poor item equivalency, however, the serial-sevens\nitem was not used in the present version. Bilingual inter-\nviewers were thoroughly trained in administration and scoring\nof the MMSE, both through workshops and videotaped in-\nstruction. As has been recommended in the literature (24), re-\nsponses of \"don't know\" and refusals were counted as errors.\nIn addition to sociodemographic characteristics (gender,\nage, education, literacy, marital status, immigration status,\nand household composition), respondents were also as-\nsessed for the presence of depressive symptomatology using\nthe self-reported Center for Epidemiological Studies\u00adDepres-\nsion (CES-D) scale (25). A score of 16 or greater on the\nCES-D was used to delineate high levels of depressive\nsymptoms. Respondents were also measured for sensory\nimpairment in terms of hearing and vision. Hearing was as-\nsessed using the 10-item Hearing Handicap Inventory for\nthe Elderly\u00adScreening version (HHIE-S) (26). Scores ranged\nfrom 0 to 40 with 10 indicating no impairment. Near vi-\nsion was measured using cards, each with seven-digit num-\nbers of three different type sizes: 7-, 10-, and 23-point. Sub-\njects held these cards at least 7 inches from their eyes and\nwere then asked to read the numbers. Participants who\ncould only read the 23-point were considered to have near-\nvision impairment. Functional distance vision was mea-\nsured using a modified Snellen test employing directional\nered impaired. In addition, self-reported medical diseases\nwere assessed by asking respondents if they had ever been\ntold by a doctor that they had any of the following condi-\ntions: diabetes, stroke, and hypertension.\nBecause there are no established normative guidelines for\ndetermining cognitive decline, we used two sets of criteria\nto identify individuals who had declined to severe impair-\nment (Criterion-1) and individuals with a more moderate\nimpairment decline (Criterion-2). Criterion-1 was defined\nby using a fixed MMSE cutoff score derived from the litera-\nture on experimental and clinical populations (28), and re-\nspondents were classified as \"cognitively impaired\" if their\nMMSE scores at baseline were less than 18. At 5-year fol-\nlow-up, \"unimpaired\" subjects at baseline were categorized\nas having \"declined\" if their MMSE scores had dropped to\nless than 18 points, indicating a decline to severe impair-\nment.\nAnalyses using Criterion-1 are based on subjects with\nthe entire total sample. Of the 1716 subjects with baseline\nat follow-up. Of those who declined, 115 had baseline\ndistribution of cutoff scores at baseline and at follow-up).\nCriterion-2 used a cutoff MMSE score based on the dis-\ntribution of scores from the sample itself rather than on cut-\noff scores derived from other non-Hispanic populations. We\nadapted the NINCDS-ADRDA Work Group's work in de-\ntermining cognitive impairment when respondents' scores\nfell at or below the 5th percentile of their normal control\ngroup (3,29). We extended this control group guideline to\ninclude our entire total population sample and to identify in-\ndividuals with more moderate cognitive decline relative to\nothers within their own group. The sensitivity and specific-\nity of this criterion have been examined and reported in an\nearlier study (11). Based on the 95th percentile distribution,\nor higher at baseline, and the mean change in MMSE scores\nfrom baseline to 5-year follow-up for this group was 3.35\npoints. Hence, respondents were considered to have cogni-\ntively declined if, at follow-up, their scores had decreased\nby at least 3 points since baseline. Under Criterion-2, 921\nsubjects were classified as having cognitively declined, and\ndistribution of cutoff scores using this criterion.\nTable 1.

Predictors in-\ncluded age, gender, education, marital status, immigration\nstatus, and household composition (i.e., number of people\nliving in the household). After controlling for these vari-\nables, baseline depressive symptoms and selected health\nconditions were then added to each model. Descriptions of\nbaseline variables are given in Table 2. The dependent vari-\nable was the presence or absence of cognitive decline (as\ndefined by Criteria 1 and 2) at follow-up.\nRESULTS\nCriterion-1 Data\nThe results of the logistic regression models are pre-\nsented in Table 3. With increasing age, there was a signifi-\ncant increase in the odds of cognitive decline during the\n5-year study interval. Subjects with less than 5 years of edu-\ncation were significantly more likely to experience decline.\nCompared with participants who were living alone, respon-\ndents who lived with others had almost twice the odds of\nexperiencing decline. Married respondents were less likely\nto decline. Gender and immigration status were not signifi-\ncant predictors of decline.\nWe next added diabetes, stroke, hypertension, hearing\nand vision impairment, and depressive symptoms to the\nanalysis. Results indicated that baseline diabetes, stroke,\nand near-vision impairment were significant predictors of\ndecline. Hypertension, hearing impairment, distant vision\nimpairment, and depressive symptoms were not predictive\nof decline as defined by Criterion-1. Furthermore, including\nthese health characteristics did not alter the significant ef-\nfects of age, education, marital status, and household com-\nposition.\nCriterion-2 Data\nWe conducted additional analyses to examine whether\nsociodemographic and health-related variables would pre-\ndict cognitive change among respondents who had dropped\nat least three points or more on the MMSE since baseline.\nOlder age and lower education were significant predictors\nof decline whereas gender, marital status, immigration status,\nand household composition were not (see Table 3). Under\nCriterion-1, subjects who had a history of stroke or diabetes\nwere found to decline over the follow-up interval. However,\nunder Criterion-2, diabetes and stroke did not significantly\npredict decline. After adjusting for sociodemographic and\nhealth characteristics, elderly persons with near-vision im-\npairment remained significantly more likely to decline than\nthose without near-vision impairment. Finally, respondents\nreporting high levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D 16)\nwere significantly more likely to decline than those report-\ning lower levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D 16).\nFurther analyses were conducted to examine the interaction\neffects of age with education, stroke, diabetes, hyperten-\nsion, and depressive symptoms. None proved to be signifi-\ncant for either Criterion-1 or Criterion-2 analyses.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this analysis, we examined the effect of noncognitive\nvariables on cognitive decline over a 5-year period using\ndata from the Hispanic EPESE. The most noteworthy find-\ning evident in the present study is the different predictive\npatterns across the two criteria. Results for both criteria in-\ndicated that gender and immigration status were not predic-\nTable 2.

Living with others\nwas predictive of changes in cognitive impairment among\nparticipants who had dropped to 17 or below (Criterion-1),\nbut was not associated with Criterion-2 decline (3 points).\nAn explanation for this finding could be attributed to the\nlevel of manifestations of decline. Subjects who dropped to\nan MMSE score of 17 or below at follow-up declined to se-\nvere cognitive impairment, which made them dependent on\nothers. They were also more likely to have experienced cog-\nnitive and other difficulties at baseline and, thus, were more\nlikely to live with family members. Contrarily, most sub-\njects who declined under Criterion-2 were likely to have\nonly declined to a moderate level of cognitive impairment.\nThus, they may have experienced some diminution in cog-\nnitive capacity yet at a moderate level that would allow\nthem to function without the assistance of others. This\nwould support the idea that Mexican American families try\nto manage cognitively impaired elders in their home envi-\nronments and have them relocate to the family home only\nwhen they become less manageable due to decline or cata-\nstrophic event (e.g., hip fracture, pneumonia).\nAlthough hypertension was not predictive of cognitive\ndecline, stroke and diabetes were significant predictors of\ndecline to the severe category (Criterion-1). They were not,\nhowever, predictive of decline of three or more points (Cri-\nterion-2). These results are in agreement with previously\npublished findings that the lack of significance may reflect\nthe fact that stroke and diabetes are more likely to associate\nwith a higher degree of cognitive decline (31,32). We did\nfind that diabetes and stroke predicted decline to the severe\ncategory. Other studies have suggested that increased dura-\ntion of diabetes is associated with increased cognitive im-\npairment (31,33) and that the risk for cognitive impairment\ndecreases as the interval between stroke and impairment in-\ncreases. For example, the odds for cognitive impairment 3\nmonths after onset of stroke were found to be higher than\nthe odds of cognitive impairment after 52 months of follow-\nup (34). Hypertension was not associated with cognitive de-\ncline, although it has been found to be inversely related with\nmemory in older adults (35). The discrepancy in such find-\nings can be partly explained by different measures of hyper-\ntension. The absence of an accurate blood pressure measure\nmay reduce the ability of our models to identify the associa-\ntion between hypertension and cognitive decline.\nDepressive symptomatology was independently associ-\nated with cognitive decline. Previous research with the same\ndata has shown high rates of depressive symptoms in older\n , especially women (36). It is possible\nthat depression sometimes mimics early dementia by caus-\ning a decline in scores on cognitive status tests (12,37).\nNear-vision impairment was significantly associated with\ncognitive decline under both criteria. Vision impairment has\nbeen found to influence the level and quality of interactive\nexperiences of older adults, thereby reducing their capacity\nto develop and maintain relationships and to participate in\nactivities that may improve their physical, mental, and psy-\nchosocial well-being (38). Thus, it is possible that visual\nimpairment could exacerbate cognitive impairment indi-\nrectly if it predisposes an individual to depression and social\nisolation. Hearing impairment was not predictive of decline\nin the present study, which is consistent with prior research\nsuggesting that this condition per se is not an independent\nrisk factor for cognitive decline (39). However, when evalu-\nating degree of dementia, the presence of severe hearing\nloss coupled with cognitive impairment can result in a much\ngreater degree of dementia (38).\nCertain limitations to the present study should be noted.\nFirst, the study employed self-reported data of depressive\nsymptoms and, thus, may not be equivalent to a clinical di-\nagnosis of depression. We believe that the use of a standard\nclinical diagnosis of depression is necessary in order to\nyield a more accurate relationship between depression and\ncognitive decline. Second, the medical conditions are self-\nreports of subjects about their health status. However, prior\nresearch has found consistency between self-reported medi-\ncal conditions and conditions reported in medical records\n(32). Despite these limitations, the present study adds to our\nunderstanding of the complex interrelationships between\ndepressive symptoms, chronic diseases, and cognitive func-\ntioning in older adults. Our findings also suggest that, as a\nscreener, the MMSE may substantially overestimate cogni-\ntive impairment in older   if these corre-\nlates are not taken into account. More important, increasing\nthe awareness of these strong associations can help clini-\ncians, particularly those who do not regularly work with\n , better monitor cognitive decline,\nwhich has been associated with mortality and the onset of\n"
