However, the acceptability of mindfulness training and whether it can augment behavior change in ECS is\nunknown. We aimed to examine; 1) the feasibility of the Mindfulness in Motion + Diet (MIM+D) intervention and 2) the\npreliminary efficacy of MIM+D for improving mindfulness, diet, PA and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Methods:\nECS (Mage=62.4, \u00b15yrs from diagnosis) completed assessments at baseline, 8 and 14 weeks. Feasibility was determined by\nintervention completion surveys, attendance and adherence data. We used repeated measures ANOVA's (SPSS 22.0) and\neffect size estimates (Cohen's d) to examine changes in mindfulness, diet, PA, and HRQL over time. Results: Thirteen ECS\n(76%) completed the MIM+D program and attendance (6/8 sessions) was 90%. Women reported favorably on the overall\nquality (mean of 4.75/5) and benefits of the MIM+D program; however, would have preferred receiving MIM+D closer to\ndiagnosis. Intention to treat analyses found MIM+D did not significantly improve any outcomes. However, an intervention\ncompleters analysis showed significant change in mindfulness (p=.0039) and small to moderate estimates for change in fruits\nand vegetable intake (d=.23), MVPA (d=.45), RAND SF-36: MCS (d=.46), and sleep quality (d=.68). Conclusions: Integrating\nmindfulness training into behavioral interventions is feasible and ECS that adhere to these lifestyle programs may benefit.\nHowever, future research should examine the-long term effects of mindfulness-based behavioral lifestyle interventions.\n",

Novel behavioral interventions, such as those that include\na mindfulness-based approach, may offer one option for\nchanging dietary behaviors and healthy lifestyle behaviors\nthat may help with sustainable weight management.\nMindfulness is a Western conceptualization of a tradi-\ntionally Eastern practice of meditation and concentration\nthat was popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn, who describes\n1Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA\n2The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA\n3The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA\n4University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAlexander R.

Klatt, PhD3\n Keywords\nendometrial cancer, survivorship, mindfulness, lifestyle behaviors, physical activity, diet\nmindfulness as \"paying attention in a particular way: on pur-\npose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.\"10(p 4)\nThis focus on developing nonjudgmental awareness has\nsignificant implications for the ways in which people react\nto stressful life events and self-regulate their behavior.\nMindfulness can be thought of both as a practice and as a\nstate of awareness and has previously been the focus of a\nnumber of interventions in cancer care. One review reports\nthat mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are associated\nwith significant improvements in anxiety, depression,\nstress, sexual difficulties, physiological arousal, and\nimmune functioning, as well as self-reported quality of\nlife.11 More recently, there has been a growing interest in\nthe potential of mindfulness-based approaches to support\nweight loss efforts12,13 and as a way of controlling eating\nhabits.14 One hypothesis is that unregulated emotional\nresponses are often integrated into eating behaviors (emo-\ntional eating); however, evidence is mixed.15 Broadly,\nmindfulness posits that people need to slow down and dis-\nengage from habitual automatic responses to environmental\nor emotional cues, thereby providing space to cognitively\nmake better choices related to their lifestyle behaviors.\nIn terms of lifestyle modification, dietary adjustment\nalone can be effective, but it is well established that diet in\ncombination with physical activity (PA) is the most benefi-\ncial behavioral strategy, especially with regard to maintain-\ning healthy, metabolically active lean tissue.16 Therefore,\nmodifying both diet and PA to address obesity-related out-\ncomes in these survivors is critical. Not surprisingly, evi-\ndence suggests that only a small number of survivors\n29%) guidelines.7,17 However, to date, only a limited num-\nber of studies have examined lifestyle interventions that\naim to address this,18,19 none of which has incorporated\nmindfulness into their intervention.\nA recent review that included 8 studies--4 cross-sec-\ntional, 1 retrospective, 1 prospective, and 2 randomized tri-\nals--examined the relationships between obesity, diet, PA,\nand health-related quality of life (HRQL) in EC survivors\nand reported that meeting PA and dietary recommendations\nwas positively associated with overall HRQL. Obesity was\nalso negatively associated with HRQL, physical well-being,\nand fatigue.20 While EC survivors do seem to have the\ncapacity to improve their lifestyle behaviors, especially in\nthe context of structured interventions, there is much evi-\ndence to suggest that as a population, EC survivors do not\nsee their condition as especially threatening and therefore\nare not motivated to change their behaviors. Furthermore,\ninterventions that aim to increase moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity (MVPA) to the level of the guidelines\n(150 minutes)21 may be limited by the functional capacity\nof morbidly obese women with no prior experience of exer-\ncise; it is not yet clear if behavioral changes can occur with\nless intensive contact or whether alternative methods of\nsupporting lifestyle change may be more or less efficacious.22\nBecause lifestyle behaviors are often complex, utilizing\ncomprehensive approaches to behavior change may hold\npotential, especially in a hard-to-reach population, such as\nEC survivors. In addition to mindfulness, another tech-\nnique that is increasingly adopted as part of behavioral\ninterventions and in health coaching is motivational inter-\nviewing (MI). Miller and Rollnick describe MI in lay terms\nas \"a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a\nperson's own motivation and commitment to change.\"23(p12)\nA meta-analysis showed that MI has previously been effec-\ntive in addressing BMI, total blood cholesterol, systolic\nblood pressure, and alcohol use.22 Furthermore, mindful-\nness that leads to less emotional reactivity and nonjudg-\nmental awareness may actually support the use of MI\ntechniques. For EC survivors, who are known to have poor\ndiets, low levels of PA, and diminished HRQL, mindful-\nness-based approaches could potentially be incorporated\ninto traditional lifestyle interventions to enhance adoption\nof these healthy behaviors. We were therefore interested in\nwhether an alternative behavioral lifestyle intervention that\nincorporated a mindfulness-based approach could feasibly\nimprove dietary and PA behaviors by enhancing behavioral\nself-regulation.\nAs far as we know, this single-group, pre-post study is\nthe first to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of\ndelivering a mindfulness-based dietary counselling inter-\nvention (Mindfulness In Motion + Diet [MIM+D]) to a\ngroup of overweight and obese, early-stage, type I EC sur-\nvivors. Our primary hypothesis was that EC survivors\nwould be (a) interested in participating and (b) find the\nMIM+D program feasible and acceptable. Secondary\nexploratory aims of this study were to examine the effects\nof the intervention on levels of mindfulness, diet, PA par-\nticipation, physical function, and HRQL. Our secondary\nhypotheses were that, for those women who adhered to the\nprogram, we would see improvements in mindfulness,\nlifestyle behaviors, physical functioning, and HRQL. We\ndid not assess weight loss as a primary outcome given the\nshort time frame of the study, and while the intervention\nwas not focused on PA per se, it did incorporate gentle\nyoga and a dietary counselling program that espoused the\nbenefits of PA. These data may inform the design and\ndelivery of subsequent lifestyle intervention trials target-\ning EC survivors.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board\n(Cancer) of the Ohio State University. This pre-post inter-\nvention study was designed to examine the feasibility and\npreliminary efficacy of delivering a mindfulness-based\ndietary counseling intervention to EC survivors. While the\nprimary focus was on diet, we were still interested in\nwhether participants would begin to incorporate PA partici-\npation, based on its inclusion in conversations related to\ndiet and health. Over a period of 24 months, there were\napproximately 500 EC patients treated through our\nOB-GYN clinics, and we estimated that a minimum recruit-\nment rate of 15% would allow us to estimate effect sizes for\nthe design of a larger trial, while also allowing us to reach\nour recruitment targets within the available timeframe. We\naimed to assess mindfulness, dietary behavior, PA, physical\nfunction, and select HRQL outcomes in a group of surgi-\ncally treated, early-stage (I and II) type I EC survivors.\nParticipants attended weekly sessions of the MIM+D inter-\nvention for 8 weeks at the cancer center and transitioned to\nhome-based practice during weeks 9 to 14. Assessments\nwere completed at baseline, follow-up 1 (8 weeks), and\nfollow-up 2 (14 weeks). The person completing assess-\nments also delivered the intervention. To assess the feasibil-\nity of our approach, on completion of the study, we asked\nparticipants to evaluate separately the mindfulness and\ndietary counseling components of the study. Adherence was\ntracked through attendance to study sessions and with self-\nreport logs.\nParticipants\nThe focal point for recruitment was a large metropolitan\nuniversity's gynecological (GYN) oncology clinic, but also\nincluded patients of other local GYN oncology clinicians.\nPatient records and in-clinic visits were the primary means\nfor identifying potential participants. After patients were\nidentified, the study staff conducted telephone-screening\ninterviews to assess interest and confirm that participants\nsatisfied the eligibility criteria (Table 1). They were then\nscheduled baseline assessment visits. All possible subjects\nmust have been surgically staged and treated for type 1,\nearly-stage (I and II) EC. We targeted these women because\nthey were most at risk for disease recurrence, future comor-\nbidity (CVD and type 2 diabetes), and experiencing com-\npromised HRQL due to sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary\npractices. The recruitment procedures for this study\nincluded a combination of mail-out invitations and in-clinic\noffers to participate in the study.\nMindfulness in Motion + Diet Intervention\nMindfulness in Motion (MIM)24 is an 8-week MBI that\nemphasizes mindful yoga as a way to develop a healthy\nrelationship with the body and provides a practical strategy\nfor stress management. It includes music, yoga, and mind-\nfulness instruction and practice, and has been described in\ndetail elsewhere.25 The movements and breathing exercises\nare simple and can be practiced daily in the worksite or\nhome. Participants were provided with a CD/DVD and\nguidelines for home-based mindfulness and yoga, as has\nbeen done in prior studies, and is an integral part of the\nprotocol.25-28 The components of each week's MIM and\nDietary sessions are shown in Table 2. At 14 weeks, partici-\npants completed a second follow-up to determine the adher-\nence to the training postintervention and the efficacy of the\napproach.\nDietary Counselling\nThe 30-minute dietary counselling sessions were conducted\nby a registered dietitian. These sessions immediately fol-\nlowed the MIM session during weeks 1 to 8. The specific\ndietary objectives were consistent with the Therapeutic\nLifestyle Changes recommended in the Adult Treatment\nPanel III Report of the National Cholesterol Education\nProgram29 and the American Institute of Cancer Research.30\nThe nutrition intervention encourages reductions in portion\nsize and caloric and fat consumption together with a gradual\ntransition from an animal-based diet to a more plant-rich\ndiet while still incorporating animal foods, including milk\nand meat, with an emphasis on monitoring food proportion\nand portion size. Specific goals of the dietary component\nTable 1.

Participants were taught how\nto set realistic goals for changing their dietary behavior,\nwhile learning to self-monitor through the completion of\ndietary logs. They were also taught the importance of antici-\npating and overcoming barriers to dietary behavior change.\nThese skills were intended to support and improve partici-\npant's self-efficacy for dietary behavior change. Participants\ndid not explicitly set goals of weight loss or for PA; how-\never, they could have done this on their own using the tech-\nniques taught. We specifically focused goal-setting on\ndietary behavior itself, with the intention being that this\nwould foster weight loss in the long term. Broadly, this the-\nory-based intervention was designed to facilitate the devel-\nopment of behavioral self-regulatory skills needed to\nsuccessfully adopt and maintain a change in dietary behav-\nior over the long term.\nMeasures\nDemographics, medical history, mindfulness, dietary qual-\nity, and measures of psychosocial and HRQL/QOL (quality\nof life) variables were conducted using surveys. We used\nboth self-report and accelerometry for PA and a standard\nbattery of functional tests for assessing physical function.\nFinally, we assessed weight status using the IDXA lunar\n(GE) for body composition.\nMindfulness was assessed with the 5-Facet Mindfulness\nQuestionnaire (FFMQ)33 and the Mindfulness Attention\nAwareness Scale (MAAS).34 The FFMQ measure was created\nusing a factor analysis approach to identify the underlying\nindependent facets tapped by multiple mindfulness ques-\ntionnaires and has demonstrated acceptable psychometric\nproperties when comparing experienced meditators with non-\nmeditators with  coefficients for all facets ranging from .67\nActing with awareness, Nonreacting, Nonjudging, and\nDescribing--all of which have shown strong expected rela-\ntionships with psychological metrics. The MAAS is a mea-\nsure proposed to tap a unitary operationalization of\nmindfulness and has been previously validated in a cancer\nTo measure the dietary intakes of EC survivors, we used\nthe Food Habits Questionnaire (FHQ).37 This measure was\ndeveloped as a screening tool for dietary quality related to\nthe prevention of cancer and CVD, with a focus on the\nassessment of dietary fats and whole grains. It typically\nincludes 49 questions related to frequency of food intake\nover 6 categories. In the RENO diet heart study, the test-\nretest reliability of this measure was (Pearson r = .92) and a\nCronbach's  level of .85. It is recognized that there are\nmore in-depth analyses of food intakes available; however,\nfor the purposes of this study, we chose this measure for its\nbrevity as well as ability to capture meaningful data in con-\njunction with other measures as part of a larger survey.\nPA was assessed using both objective accelerometers\nand self-reported data via the modified Paffenbarger\nPhysical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)38 to measure weekly\nMVPAlevels in EC survivors. PAparticipation was assessed\nobjectively with the uniaxial, Kenz LIFECORDER\n(Suzuken Kenz Inc Limited, Tokyo, Japan) accelerometer.\nThe LIFECORDER (LC) has previously established valid-\nity and reliability.39-41 The PAQ measures the amount of\ntime typically spent by an individual in various types of PA,\nincluding stair climbing, walking, and structured exercise.\nComparison of the level of accumulated weekly PA can be\nmade using the current American College of Sports\nMedicine/US Department of Health and Human Services\nguidelines of 150 minutes of MVPA per week. Prior\nresearch has demonstrated the PAQ has acceptable valid-\nity and reliability.42 Physical function was assessed using 4\nTable 2.

The Short Physical Performance\nBattery (SPPB) is composed of 3 subcomponents that test\nbalance, gait speed, and leg strength and endurance.43 We\nalso conducted 3 timed performance-related mobility tasks:\nthe 400-m walk, participants completed 10 clockwise laps\naround a 40-m indoor course as quickly as possible. For the\nstair-climb task, participants were timed while they\nascended a set of 10 stairs turning around at the top of the\nplatform, and then descending the stairs. In the lift and carry\ntask, participants picked up a container--weighing 10 lbs--\nwith both hands, turned and walked around a cone placed 5\nm away. They then returned to the shelf to place the con-\ntainer down. Performance on each test was measured in the\ntotal time (in minutes and/or seconds) to complete the task.\nQuality of life was assessed from both a global perspec-\ntive as well as within a more disease specific context\n(HRQL). Globally we used the Satisfaction with Life Scale\n(SWLS), a 10-item, Likert-type questionnaire with reported\nvalidity and reliability,48 and for the specific aspects of\nHRQL we used the RAND SF-36, which is well-known and\nhas acceptable validity and reliability.49 The Pittsburg Sleep\nQuality Index (PSQI) was used to sample typical sleep pat-\nterns over the previous month, which is determined to be a\ntime frame within which transient issues with this aspect of\nnormal functioning may vary. The measure has been shown\nto be valid and reliable in prior research.50\nTo assess the feasibility of our approach, on completion of\nthe study, we asked participants to evaluate separately the\nmindfulness and dietary counseling components of the study\n(Figure 2). Adherence was tracked through attendance to\nstudy sessions and with self-report logs. The preliminary effi-\ncacy analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package\nfor Social Sciences (SPSS, version 22). Data were cleaned\nand examined for outliers and missing values. SPSS by\ndefault conducts analyses by dropping cases for which there\nare missing data. We therefore carried data forward from the\nlast visit for which there was an assessment to conservatively\nevaluate the effect of the intervention. Following an exami-\nnation of the demographics of the study population, we con-\nducted bivariate correlations to determine the relationships\nbetween the primary variables of interest. Alpha was set a\npriori at a level of P = .05. Repeated-measures ANOVAs\nwere then used to determine the effects of the MIM+D inter-\nvention on changes in all outcomes of interest.Analyses were\nconducted using the intention-to-treat principle with the last-\nvalue-carried-forward approach used to account for missing\ndata. Where assumptions of sphericity were violated as deter-\nmined by Mauchley's test, we used the Greenhouse-Geisser\nadjustment to interpret main effects. Given this was a feasi-\nbility and preliminary efficacy study involving a small sam-\nple size, effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated by taking\nthe mean difference and dividing by the pooled standard\ndeviation to better estimate the meaningfulness of change for\neach observed outcome following the intervention. By con-\nvention, the values and meanings for effect size estimates are\na small effect size (d = .2), a moderate effect size (d = .5), and\na large effect size (d = .8). Finally, we also conducted an\nexploratory analysis for intervention completers (adherence)\nfollowing the same steps as above where appropriate.\nResults\nRecruitment processes and flow are detailed in the\nCONSORT diagram (Figure 1). Briefly, 438 patients were\nscreened and contacted about the study, leading to 43\n(9.8%) that showed an interest. Of these, we excluded 26\npatients who were (a) too active (5), (b) had recently par-\nticipated in yoga (3), (c) were underweight (4), (d) who\nFigure 1.

There were a total of 17 par-\nticipants that completed baseline measures on all outcomes\nof interest (40%). Two subjects did not start the interven-\ntion due to scheduling conflicts, and a further 2 dropped\nout by follow-up 1 and another 2 by follow-up 2, leaving a\nwho completed the entire study (65%). While we did have\nsome dropout over the course of the intervention, those\nwho completed the study reported a high level of satisfac-\ntion with the intervention (Figure 2). In particular, it was\nnotable that the majority of the participants reported that\nthey felt they would have benefitted most from this inter-\nvention had it been offered to them when they were first\ndiagnosed and early in the course of their treatment.\nWomen in the study were predominantly white (88%),\nwell-educated, with a mean age of 61.1 \u00b1 7 years, considered\nwith multiple comorbidities, including 30% who were type\n2 diabetic, 65% who had hypertension, 24% with arthritis,\nand 12% with depressive symptoms (see Table 3).\nInterestingly, in the 2 women that were only slightly over-\nweight by BMI criteria, body fat % (IDXA) measures\nshowed they were actually obese. Given the short time frame\nof the study, we did not expect to see significant weight loss.\nHowever, we did examine body composition changes for\nthose women who completed the intervention. These results\nare reported with the rest of the intervention completion data\nand are shown in Table 7. The 95% CIs for all analyses are\navailable by request from the corresponding author.\nMindfulness\nTable 4 shows the results of the intervention on mindfulness\nscores over time. For the 5 different factors of the FFMQ,\nthere were no statistically significant or meaningful effect\nsize changes over time. In terms of the MAAS, we again did\nnot see a statistically significant change (p = .15; 95% CI =\npointed toward a small improvement.\nDietary Quality\nFood habits data are reported in Table 5. Scores in each cat-\negory represent the relative quality of eating habits, ranging\nfrom poor to excellent. At baseline, only 2 women showed\npoor choices in the grains category, with no scores below 8,\nwhich indicates a high risk for cancer.37 There were no poor\nchoices in the fruits and vegetables category, 3 (18%) in the\nfairly good range, and the rest (82%) in the excellent range.\nHowever, 24% of women had poor dairy choices, with the\nmajority (59%) in the fair category. Meat scores are a mea-\nsure of protein intake and include items such as beans and\nfish. No subjects were in the poor category, 29% in the fair\ncategory, 65% fairly good, and one in the excellent cate-\ngory. The fats and oils category indicates the general way a\nperson cooks their meals or the type of meals they typically\nchoose if eating out. Eighty-eight percent of women were\nmaking poor choices. Given the sample, this is not surpris-\ning. Seventy-seven percent of participants were making\npoor choices in the \"other\" category, which referred to fast\nfood, sugary foods, and items such as alcoholic beverages.\nTable 3.

Despite recruiting chal-\nlenges, women who were eligible and completed the study\nreported favorably on the intervention. Seventeen women\nparticipated in baseline screening, 13 of whom completed\nthe intervention (76%). We did not see changes in dietary\nbehavior; however, there was some evidence that outcomes\nimportant to cancer survivors may have improved. From a\npreliminary efficacy standpoint, there may be some poten-\ntial for incorporating a MBI into more conventional behav-\nioral lifestyle approaches for EC survivors; however, the\nsmall sample size and study design mean further investiga-\ntion is warranted.\nFrom the demographics of the study participants, it is\napparent that obesity was prevalent and that a high burden\nof comorbidity existed, further reinforcing the need for\nbehavioral modification in this group of survivors.4\nParticularly interesting was the fact that 2 participants who\nwere only marginally overweight by BMI criteria were\nfound to have a high degree of body fatness when assessed\non the IDXA, a more accurate measurement of body fat.\nThe implications of this are that while BMI is useful for\ndetermining risk in a large population, individually women\nwho have poor dietary habits and who do not engage in PA\nmay still have high levels of adipose tissue. This is a spe-\ncific risk factor for developing type I EC and further places\nthese women at high risk for future comorbidity.51 Lifestyle\nmodification is therefore an important goal for overweight\nand obese EC patients and survivors who (a) may be at risk\nfor disease recurrence and (b) have a high burden of comor-\nknown characteristics of this patient population (sedentary,\npoor diet, and high comorbidity), there are few systematic,\nsupportive care approaches focused on healthy lifestyle\nbehaviors during survivorship.\nOne study--a randomized controlled trial designed to\ntest the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention for weight loss\nand PA in 55 EC survivors--did find that women in the life-\nstyle arm lost weight and increased their PA relative to the\ncontrol group at 1 year.55 The authors also examined HRQL\nand mediators of change in the feasibility intervention and\nreported that self-efficacy was much lower in morbidly\nobese survivors and that the intervention did not improve\nHRQL.56 In a larger follow-up trial, these findings were\nconfirmed, suggesting that lifestyle interventions can be\neffective when survivors adhere to exercise and dietary\nguidance.57 More recently, Basen-Engquist and colleagues\nexamined the response of obese versus nonobese EC survi-\nvors to an exercise intervention. In the STEPS to Health\nstudy, 100 posttreatment, stage I-IIIa survivors participated\nin a single-arm 6-month study of home-based exercise. At\nbaseline, obese survivors had worse cardiorespiratory fit-\nness and self-reported measures of HRQL.58 While non-\nobese survivors improved their fitness and exercise behavior\nto a greater extent than obese survivors did, both groups\nimproved their HRQL and reduced stress to the same\ndegree. Obese survivors also improved their exercise from\ntheir baseline levels.\nFrom a feasibility standpoint, there were some difficul-\nties in recruiting patients to this study. One example of the\nkind of difficulties met was the response from one particu-\nlar EC patient when asked about her interest in a lifestyle\nintervention study for healthy EC survivorship. She replied\nthat she \"had been treated for her cancer and was now bet-\nter.\" This perhaps is an indication of the fact that many\npatients are not acutely aware of the importance of lifestyle\nbehaviors on their risk for developing EC in the first place\nor on their continued health following diagnosis.59 While\nclinicians do recognize the importance of weight loss and\nincreasing PA for these patients, they do not always have\nthe time or the specialized training to meaningfully impact\nthis aspect of their patient's lives.60,61 Furthermore, women\nwith type I EC may be unique as cancer patients and survi-\nvors in part due to the fact that the majority of them are\nsurgically treated without adjuvant therapies and are survi-\nvors at 5 years postdiagnosis.62 Despite these challenges,\nwomen who did show an interest in the study reported\nfavorably on both the mindfulness training and the dietary\ncounselling components. The once-weekly meeting sched-\nule was also an achievable demand on time. It was reported\nby one woman that she had become uncomfortable because\nshe had begun to feel responsible for causing her health\nproblems; while unfortunate, there is always a concern that\na program to increase awareness will cause some psycho-\nlogical discomfort and therefore this was specifically\naddressed as a risk in the informed consent document.\nOverall, we do feel this type of intervention is safe and fea-\nsible in this population of cancer survivors.\nDue to the small sample size, we were not statistically\npowered to detect significant differences in primary or sec-\nondary outcomes. However, we still felt it was valuable to\nexplore the preliminary efficacy of our intervention.\nSpecifically, we did not see statistically significant improve-\nments in mindfulness measured with the FFMQ, dietary\nquality,PA,orHRQLutilizinganintention-to-treatapproach.\nEffect size estimates and an exploratory completers'analysis\ndid indicate the potential of our intervention to improve\nsome outcomes. Results for the FFMQ at baseline showed\nthat EC survivors had similar scores compared with a popu-\nlation of regular meditators, meaning it may be that we saw\na ceiling effect with the FFMQ as these scores were already\nhigh at baseline. Scores for the MAAS at baseline were,\npreviously found in a mixed group of cancer patients (mean\nSD = 0.63) but slightly higher than another sample of cancer\nimprovement measured with the MAAS, and it is feasible\nthat this unitary operationalization of mindfulness was more\nspecifically targeted by the intervention. While a number of\nstudies have explored the role of mindfulness in the context\nof weight loss, the findings are mixed.12-15 The role of self-\nefficacy in relation to weight loss has also been examined in\nother studies. Findings from the SUCCEED trial indicated\nthat improvements in self-efficacy accompanied a decrease\nin BMI following a lifestyle intervention.18 While there has\nbeen no specific examination of mindfulness, self-efficacy\nand their relationship to weight loss in EC patients, Rejeski\nand colleagues have previously found that changes in the\nWeight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire partially mediated\nthe effects of their lifestyle intervention on weight loss.63\nThere is also some evidence that coping self-efficacy may\nmediate the relationship between aspects of mindfulness and\nemotion regulation,64 and that mindfulness still predicts\ndepression, anxiety, stress, and well-being even when\naccounting for self-efficacy.65 This may suggest that mind-\nfulness can still offer unique benefits beyond those found in\nmore traditional behavioral interventions focused on improv-\ning self-efficacy.\nThe most interesting findings were related to dietary\nquality. The FHQ has been shown to be positively correlated\nwith more robust 3-day food records,37 but may be limited in\nits capacity to capture the details of dietary patterns.\nHowever, in general, we expected to see poorer scores in\nmost categories and that they would improve as a result of\nthe intervention. One possibility is that women had an\nawareness of the importance of a healthy diet (eg, fruit and\nvegetable intake) and this led to them self-reporting higher\nthan expected scores at baseline. Once they had been taught\nto identify healthy foods and patterns of eating, they may\nthen have more accurately reported on their dietary patterns,\nand this was reflected as a worsening of scores over time.\nDespite this, we did see women self-report in the poor cate-\ngory for both \"fats and oils\" and the \"other\" category that\nreflects fast food and high-fat cooking methods, which\nwould confirm poor eating habits. In a similar fashion, we\ndid not see PA, as measured objectively, improve signifi-\ncantly. We did, however, find some women who increased\ntheir walking and MVPA a great deal. Furthermore, self-\nreport did show a modest increase in PA overall. Again, this\nintervention talked about the importance of MVPA but did\nnot specifically aim to increase this in a structured way, as\nwith the dietary counseling. The introduction of gentle yoga\nand the mention of PA may have resulted in the improved\nphysical functioning we saw reflected in the improved\nSPPB, even though none of the scores indicated risk for\nfuture disability (<10). The primary driver of this change\nseemed to be the chair stand time. This may have been a\nreflection of improved technique or simply an increased\nmotivation on the part of the participants. In terms of the\nHRQL and QOL broadly, we again saw high scores at base-\nline, meaning it was unlikely we would see much improve-\nment. However, there were still some women who reported\nlow levels initially and who did respond positively, and\nalthough not significant, Cohen's d did indicate a small posi-\ntive effect. Sleep quality is particularly responsive to mind-\nfulness training24 and that may have been the case here.\nDespite not improving to a level below the cutoff for poor\nsleep quality (>5 indicates a poor quality of sleep), sleep\nquality still improved when looking at the completers' anal-\nysis and effect size estimates. This finding warrants further\nexamination in this population, as many health problems and\ncomorbidities, including fatigue, depression, hypertension,\nand CVD risk, are associated with poor sleep quality.66,67\nThere were a number of limitations to the current study.\nFirst, we conducted multiple statistical tests on a limited\ndata set and therefore the likelihood of making a type 1\nerror was high. Because this was an exploratory study, pri-\nmarily to test feasibility, we felt it was valuable to explore\nthe potential effects of the intervention. Additionally, we\nwere underpowered to detect significant changes in our\noutcomes, and a larger number of women would have\nallowed a more robust examination of the interventions\neffects. We also lacked either a no-treatment or different\ntreatment control group for comparative purposes. We had\ninitially proposed such an intervention, but limitations in\nthe recruitment schedule meant we focused on a single-arm\nintervention. We did not have a large number of minority\nparticipants, which is typical of many research studies, but\nin the future, there should be a significant effort to include\na representative proportion of survivors in order to refine\nrecommendations and determine which programs will be\nof most benefit based on cultural norms and expectations\nof supportive care. We would urge some caution with\nregard to the generalizability of the findings of the current\nstudy. Specifically, the enrollment challenges indicate that\nlarge numbers of EC survivors may not be interested in this\ntype of intervention. Hard-to-reach populations require a\nmultipronged approach to recruitment that includes both\nmail and in-person contact, providing access to informa-\ntion sessions to generate interest and especially by garner-\ning support of the clinical providers. If possible and\nfeasible, providing incentives to participation with the use\nof travel vouchers or gift cards can also be of help. Another\nlimitation of this study related to recruitment was a lack of\nadequate surveys to determine why women were not inter-\nested in this study. This could have provided important\ninformation that would serve to improve enrollment in\nfuture studies. Another limitation was that the same person\nconducted the assessments and delivered part of the inter-\nvention, which could have biased some of the results.\nFinally, adherence to home-based mindfulness training and\ndietary logs was self-reported and impossible to verify.\nStrengths of this study were that we began by conducting\na theory-based examination of PA and dietary behavior in the\nsame population to refine and target the intervention. The\nMindfulness in Motion and the Dietary counselling portions\nof the intervention have both been previously validated in\nresearch studies.24,26,68 However, this was the first time they\nhave been combined to target a unique population of cancer\nsurvivors in order to improve lifestyle behaviors and poten-\ntially relevant health outcomes. Most traditional approaches\nto weight loss (increasing PA and improving diet) may be\nseen as particularly challenging for women who are dealing\nwith a diagnosis of cancer, obesity, and trying to manage\nmultiple comorbidities. This approach therefore aimed to\nreduce the impact of psychological barriers (anxiety, depres-\nsion) to making healthy lifestyle choices by increasing survi-\nvors' ability to self-regulate their behavior (eg, improving\ndiet). This skill set would then hypothetically \"prime\" par-\nticipants to be more receptive to making healthy eating\nchoices and engaging in PA. It should be noted that a recent\nstudy by Zhang et al examined the proportion of EC patients\nthat would be safely able to exercise based on their medical\ncharts.69 Only 14% of patients were deemed safely able to\nexercise unsupervised, which points to the need for programs\nwhere lifestyle change can be gradual and/or staged.\nMindfulness training that incorporates gentle yoga and move-\nment first may then pave the way for more substantial behav-\nior change efforts, such as starting an exercise program.\nConclusions\nDespite the limitations of the current study, a number of\nwhich related to challenges with recruiting an adequate\nsample, there does seem to be some potential for develop-\ning and disseminating novel behavioral lifestyle programs\nfor EC patients and survivors. There is a significant need\nto improve diet and increase PA in this population and\ndeveloping approaches that (a) are acceptable and achiev-\nable by a large number of women dealing with a diagnosis\nof cancer and comorbidity concurrently and (b) can\nenhance the capacity of women to self-regulate their\nbehavior and successfully maintain healthy lifestyles\neven in the face of challenging psychosocial barriers,\nsuch as anxiety and depression, that could lead to\nimproved supportive care.\nMindfulness training is increasingly advocated as part of\nintegrative medical care and has a number of significant\nbenefits. It is a life skill that can be taught and learned by\nanyone, is not expensive, and does not result in adverse side\neffects. Newer approaches to teaching mindfulness are being\ntranslated into eHealth and mHealth settings, which means a\ngreater capacity for dissemination and therefore reach. We\nneed to make sure that investigations of this type of lifestyle\ntraining are done within the context of well-designed, the-\nory-based scientific trials if we hope to see greater uptake\nand incorporation of mindfulness-based approaches into\nevidence-based practice for health management.\n"
