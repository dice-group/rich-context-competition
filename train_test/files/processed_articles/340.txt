Yet, recent\nresearch has identified subgroups of metabolically healthy\nobese persons and high-risk normal-weight persons, high-\nlighting the variability in cardiometabolic health across a\nrange of body mass index (BMI) groups (4,5). Although\nmost attention has focused on current weight, research sug-\ngests that weight history can independently influence meta-\nbolic and cardiovascular outcomes (6\u00ad8).\nThe vast majority of research on weight gain and cardio-\nvascular risk controls for weight in early adulthood and ex-\namines the influence of subsequent weight gain (9\u00ad11).\nHence, a positive association between weight gain and car-\ndiovascular risk may occur simply because those who have\ngained more weight also have higher current weight (12). In\ncontrast, we focus on whether weight history contributes to\nmetabolic risk controlling for current BMI. From a clinical\nstandpoint, it is important to know whether information on\na patient's weight history has relevance above and beyond\nthe patient's current weight status.\nThe age at which weight gain occurs (i.e., the timing of\nweight gain) may also modify the risk of metabolic syndrome\nSpecial Issue: Obesity in Older Persons\nMetabolic Syndrome and Weight Gain in Adulthood\nDawn E.

The influence of long-term adult weight history on metabolic risk independent of attained body mass\nindex (BMI) is unknown.\nNutrition Examination Surveys, we examined weight change for two periods of adulthood: prime age (age 25\u00ad10 years\nago) and midlife (the last 10 years). Weight changes in each period were categorized as stable (gain <10 kg) or gain (gain 10\nkg) to create weight history comparison groups: stable-stable, gain-stable (prime age gain), stable-gain (midlife gain), and\ngain-gain (continuous gain). Persons who lost weight were excluded. Logistic regression predicted odds of metabolic\nsyndrome and its subcomponents based on weight history, adjusting for current BMI and covariates.\nResults. Participants in the gain-stable group had 89% elevated odds of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio = 1.89, 95%\nCI: 1.19\u00ad3.01) relative to the stable-stable group, even after adjustment for current BMI. All weight gain groups had in-\ncreased odds of low HDL and high triglycerides relative to participants with continuously stable weights. No significant\nassociations were found between weight history and hypertension or high glucose.\nConclusions. Weight history confers information about metabolic risk factors above and beyond attained weight sta-\ntus. In particular, adult weight gain is related to risk of low HDL and high triglycerides. Weight history may contribute to\nour understanding of why some obese older persons are metabolically healthy but others are not.\nKey Words: Metabolic syndrome--Weight history--Body mass index--Lipids.\n(2). Research has shown that relative risk of hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol, and diabetes associated with a given BMI is\nhigher at younger ages (13,14). Additionally, earlier adult\nweight gain appears to confer a greater risk for coronary heart\ndisease than later life weight gain (15). The health conse-\nquences of weight change may differ by age for a variety of\nreasons, including age differences in the interrelationships be-\ntween body weight, body composition, and health behaviors.\nThe aim of this analysis was to determine whether long-\nterm adult weight history predicts metabolic syndrome in-\ndependent of current weight.\nMethods\nAnalyses used participants from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted be-\nducted in 2-year cycles (16). Each survey consists of an\ninterview and a medical examination. Eight years of the most\nrecently available data are combined here to create an ade-\nquate sample size. Eligible participants included persons aged\n50\u00ad64 years who participated in the fasting subsample. Anal-\nyses used STATA 10.0 survey commands to produce weighted\nestimates and account for the complex survey design.\nThe NHANES interview component included a weight\nhistory questionnaire with the following questions: \"How\nmuch did you weigh 10 years ago?\" and \"How much did you\nweigh at age 25?\" Recalled weight has been found to be\nhighly correlated with measured weight (Pearson correlations\nof .73\u00ad.87) for men and women with recall periods as long as\nwere measured as part of the medical examination.\nAnalysis was restricted to participants aged 50\u00ad64 years\nfor three reasons: (a) Based on typical weight trajectories,\nparticipants' current weights should be near each individ-\nual's highest BMI, providing the opportunity to collect a\ncomplete weight history before significant age-associated\nweight loss has occurred (21,22); (b) This age group is of\nparticular interest because it represents a period when the\nprevalence of metabolic syndrome increases (23); and (c)\nBecause the weight history questionnaire asked about\nweight at age 25 and 10 years prior to the interview,\nthe sample age range must be narrow enough to allow for\nreasonably comparable weight change intervals across\nparticipants.\nFigure 1 depicts observed periods of weight change. Two\nmeasures of weight change were computed. Prime age\nweight change was computed as the difference between\nself-reported weight 10 years ago and weight at age 25 years,\nand midlife weight change was computed as the difference\nbetween current measured weight and self-reported weight\n10 years ago. We modeled weight change, rather than BMI\nchange, because information about height is incorporated\ninto analysis by controlling for baseline BMI and a measure\nof absolute weight change may better reflect changes in fat\nWeight change for each interval was categorized as loss\n(any weight loss), stable (a gain of less than 10 kg/22 lb), or\nare clinically meaningful (9), and slight variations in this\ncut point did not meaningfully alter our results. Because in-\ntentionality of weight loss was unknown and unintentional\nweight loss may confound associations between weight\nchange and health (25), participants who lost weight were\nexcluded. Thus, our analysis of patterns of weight change\nfocused on participants with four possible patterns of weight\nchange across two age periods: stable-stable (stable weight),\ngain-stable (prime age gain), stable-gain (midlife gain), and\ngain-gain (continuous gain).\nFigure 1. Weight history measure summary.\nFigure 2. Weight history comparison groups.\nIn accordance with guidelines of the American Heart As-\nsociation and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n(26), metabolic syndrome was defined as having three or more\nof the following: (a) triglycerides greater than or equal to 150\nmg and the dL or treatment for elevated triglycerides; (b)\nHDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL in men and less than 50\nmg/dL in women or treatment for low HDL; (c) blood pres-\nsure greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg or use of antihy-\npertensive medication; (d) fasting glucose greater than or\nequal to 100 mg/dL or drug treatment for elevated glucose;\nor (e) waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm\nin men or 88 cm in women. Up to four blood pressure read-\nings were obtained, and all readings after the first were av-\neraged to compute systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\nWaist circumference was measured to the nearest millime-\nter. Serum lipid and glucose measures were analyzed in the\nfasting subsample. Triglycerides were measured enzymati-\ncally using a series of reactions in which triglycerides\nHDL was measured using a heparin\u00admanganese precipita-\nserum using the Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics\n(Branchburg, NJ) direct HDL method. Glucose concentration\nwas determined by a hexokinase method. Participants re-\nported whether they were currently taking medication to\nlower their blood pressure or medication for diabetes. Current\nuse of fibrates and nicotinic acid were considered indicators\nof treatment for elevated triglycerides and low HDL (26).\nUsing logistic regression, we predicted the relative odds\nof metabolic syndrome and its subcomponents at age 50\u00ad64\nyears based on current measured BMI and weight history\npattern. The stable-stable category is used as the reference\ncategory in all analysis. Hence, given the same current BMI,\nwe compare persons who have roughly maintained weight\n(within 20 kg) since age 25 years with those who experi-\nenced gains during prime age (gain-stable), gains during\nmidlife (stable-gain), and continuous weight gain (gain-\ngain). Controlling for BMI at the time of the exam allows us\nto examine whether weight history exerts an effect on meta-\nbolic syndrome and its components that is independent of\ncurrent weight status. Figure 2 depicts a simplified schematic.\nModels compare those with a stable BMI (shown at the\nsample mean of 30.4 kg/m2) with those who gained weight\n(shown as 10 kg of weight change) during the prime age\nperiod, the midlife period, or both.\nIf length of exposure to excess weight is the primary de-\nterminant of metabolic syndrome risk, those with stable\nweights should have the highest risk of metabolic syndrome\nand its subcomponents and those who gained weight most\nrecently, in the midlife period, should have lower risk of\nmetabolic syndrome. However, if weight gain during the\nprime age or midlife period has unique negative metabolic\nconsequences, participants who gained weight during that\nperiod may have higher relative risk. The effect of weight\ngain may also differ by current weight status. For example,\nweight stability may be protective among those who are not\nobese, but harmful among obese persons. Hence, we also\ntest for interactions between weight change categories and\nobesity status.\nAll models additionally controlled for current age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity (African American, Mexican American, and\nother compared with non-Hispanic white), education (less\nthan high school and more than high school compared with\nhigh school graduate), income (using the poverty income\nratio), smoking history (current smoking and former smok-\ning compared with never smoking), and exercise (any vig-\norous activity in the past 30 days vs no activity). Because\nwaist circumference is strongly associated with BMI and\nmay have an overwhelming influence on any association be-\ntween weight change and metabolic syndrome, additional\nmodels excluded waist circumference from the definition\nof metabolic syndrome and predict modified metabolic\nsyndrome (MMS), defined as having at least three of the\nremaining four risk factors (27).\npated in the fasting exam components, 18 were missing\nmeasured height or weight data, 65 were missing weight\nhistory items, 97 were missing metabolic syndrome data,\nand 121 were missing additional covariates. Additionally,\n535 participants with weight loss or a history of under-\nweight were excluded. Underweight has long-term health\neffects thought to reflect unmeasured disease (28), and as-\nsociations between weight gain and health are likely to be\nsignificantly different in this group, where weight gain may\nindicate recovery from disease (e.g., cancer). This yielded a\nfinal analytic sample of 915 participants.\nResults\nTable 1 provides sample characteristics by weight his-\ntory. Stable-stable trajectories were observed in 38.1% of\nTable 1.

Age varied across weight history\ngroups; participants in the stable-gain group were younger\nthan those with continuously stable weights but those in the\ngain-gain group were older. Women were more likely to be\nin the gain-gain group. Participants in the stable-gain and\ngain-stable groups had lower incomes than those with con-\ntinuously stable weights. Participants with a gain-gain pat-\ntern were less likely to have been engaged in vigorous\nexercise in the past 30 days relative to those with stable\nweights. Participants in all three gain-related weight history\ngroups had higher current mean BMIs and a higher preva-\nlence of obesity than those with stable weights. Participants\nin the stable-gain and gain-gain groups had higher BMIs at\nage 25 years than those with stable weights. The prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in all weight\ngain groups relative to those with stable weights.\nTable 2 provides odds ratios (ORs) from a logistic regres-\nsion predicting the odds of metabolic syndrome and its sub-\ncomponents. Model 1 predicts metabolic syndrome based\nonly on weight history and demographic characteristics,\nwithout controlling for current BMI. In this model, all three\ngain weight history patterns were associated with elevated\nrisk of metabolic syndrome relative to continuously stable\nweight. As expected, the highest risk was associated with\ngain in both age periods (gain-gain); participants in this group\nhad more than five times the odds of metabolic syndrome\nrelative to participants in the stable-stable group (OR =\n(Model 2), participants in the gain-stable (prime age gain)\ngroup had 89% increased odds of metabolic syndrome\npatterns were not significantly associated with metabolic\nsyndrome after BMI adjustment.\nHigh waist circumference may have an overwhelming in-\nfluence on any association between weight change and met-\nabolic syndrome. To address this issue, Table 2 also provides\nORs from a logistic regression predicting the odds of MMS\nby weight pattern. MMS excludes waist circumference, so\nthat metabolic syndrome is defined by having three or more\nof the remaining four risk factors (27). Using this definition,\nhistories had elevated odds of metabolic syndrome relative\nto the stable-stable group.\nFurther analysis examined the association between weight\nhistory pattern and the components of metabolic syndrome,\nexcluding waist circumference. Weight history pattern was\nnot associated with hypertension or high glucose, though\ncurrent BMI was significantly and positively associated\nwith these risk factors. Participants in all three weight gain\ngroups had elevated odds of low HDL, with more than twice\nthe odds of low HDL observed for the gain-stable group\nTable 2.

Participants in all three weight gain\ngroups also had elevated odds of high triglycerides, ranging\nfrom 95% increased odds for the stable-gain (midlife gain)\ntimes elevated odds for the gain-gain group (OR = 2.56,\nThe advantage of weight stability may be protective among\nthose who are currently not obese but harmful among obese\npersons. Interactions between obesity status and the weight\nchange categories, however, were not statistically significant\nin any of our models. Indeed, the strength of the estimated\ninfluence of weight gain on MMS, low HDL, and higher trig-\nlycerides appears large and positive among obese persons.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this analysis was to determine whether long-\nterm adult weight history predicts metabolic syndrome in-\ndependent of attained BMI. Previous analysis has shown\nthat duration of overweight predicts metabolic syndrome in\nU.S. adults (8). This article builds on prior analysis by ex-\namining weight gain itself across a broader span of adult-\nhood. Compared with participants in the stable-stable group,\nthose in the gain-stable group, who experienced weight\ngains during the prime age period (age 25 years to a mean\nage of 47 years), had elevated odds of metabolic syndrome\nat age 50\u00ad64 years, even after accounting for current BMI.\nThis relationship was particularly strong after excluding\nwaist circumference from the definition of metabolic syn-\ndrome; participants who gained 10 kg or more during the\nprime age period had approximately twice the odds of MMS\nat ages 50\u00ad64 years, regardless of whether prime age weight\ngain was followed by weight stability (gain-stable group,\nThese findings suggest that weight gain during adulthood\nmay have a unique effect on metabolic risk. Further analysis\nsuggested that this effect may occur through an association\nbetween weight gain, low HDL, and high triglycerides.\nThese results point to a potential association between weight\ngain during adulthood and atherogenic dyslipidemia, a pri-\nmary mechanism through which obesity is thought to be as-\nsociated with cardiovascular disease (29).\nThese relationships did not appear to vary by current\nweight status. Even among participants who were obese at\nmidlife, weight gain during adulthood appeared to confer\nadditional risk relative to weight stability. Recent research\nhas highlighted the heterogeneity of metabolic risk among\nthose who are obese (4,5). These results suggest that weight\ngain in adulthood may be one risk factor that could help us\nunderstand why some obese persons are metabolically\nhealthier than others.\nThere are several potential explanations for the indepen-\ndent effect of weight gain on lipid profiles. The pathways\nthat lead to obesity may differ by age and these varied path-\nways may exert unique effects on risk factors, such that in-\ndividuals with the same current weight but different weight\nhistories have different metabolic profiles. For example,\nweight gain in adulthood may be more a product of health\nbehaviors, but weight gains earlier in life may be more\nheavily influenced by genetic disposition (30). The health\neffects of obesity may be different for those with early-onset\nobesity than for those who became obese related to factors\nin adulthood. Previous research has identified a group of\nmetabolically healthy obese individuals, characterized by\nan earlier onset of obesity (before age 20 years) and lower\nlevels of visceral adipose tissue, as well as lower levels of\ntriglycerides and higher levels of HDL relative to their met-\nabolically unhealthy counterparts with later-onset obesity\n(31). Weight gain in adulthood may be more likely to result\nin visceral fat accumulation, which accords a higher risk for\nhigh triglycerides than fat accumulation in other areas (32).\nThus, participants who became obese in adulthood may dis-\nplay particular behavioral or body composition characteris-\ntics that alter risk profiles relative to those who became\nobese at an earlier age.\nIn contrast to findings for HDL and triglycerides, none of\nthe measures of weight history used here was associated\nwith high glucose, consistent with the hypothesis that at-\ntained weight may be the most dominant risk factor for dia-\nbetes, regardless of weight history (33). The same may be\ntrue of hypertension.\nPrevious research on the association between weight\nchange and cardiovascular risk factors has typically exam-\nined the effect of weight change independent of baseline or\nearly-life weight, rather than current or attained weight (9).\nThis research has yielded critical public health insights: a\n2001 meta-analysis concluded that every kilogram of weight\ngain after high school increased the risk of coronary heart\ndisease by 5.7% for women and 3.1% for men (9). However,\nthis approach reveals little about whether prior weight infor-\nmation is useful in the clinical setting, in which physicians\ntypically use current weight to assess cardiovascular disease\nrisk. Associations between weight gain and current health\nstatus that control for baseline weight may simply reflect the\nfact that those who have gained the most weight have higher\ncurrent weights. This analysis suggests that much of the ef-\nfect of previous weight change on metabolic syndrome and\nits subcomponents is accounted for by controlling for cur-\nrent BMI. However, even after controlling for current BMI,\nwe found that participants who gained weight in adulthood\nhad substantially elevated odds of low HDL and high trig-\nlycerides (relative to stable weight persons). Future research\nshould examine these associations using longitudinal data\nthat allows for more specific comparisons of the effects of\nweight gain during different age periods.\nThere are important limitations to this analysis. First, any\nattempt to categorize weight history is likely to be oversim-\nplified and may obscure differences within weight history\ngroups. For instance, by coding all participants who gained\nless than 10 kg as having stable weights, we include partici-\npants who could have gained as much as 19.8 kg since age\n25 years in the stable-stable category. If anything, however,\nthis is likely to result in an underestimate of the effects of\nweight gain, because participants in the reference group\nhave not had truly stable weights. Previous studies have\nsuggested that slight weight gain in late adulthood may be\nassociated with improved health (relative to stable weight,\ndeclining weight, or larger gains), but it is not possible to\ndistinguish these potential differences in the coding scheme\nused here (34). We experimented with modeling weight\nhistory using several different methods. These included the\nuse of multiple categories for each age period (e.g., stable,\negories based on quintiles of weight change for each period;\nclassifying persons based on the percentage of total weight\ngain that can be attributed to each period; simply modeling\ncontinuous BMI in each period; and modeling total weight\ngain without separating by age period. In each case, results\nsuggested that larger weight gains were associated with\nMMS, low HDL, and high triglyceride levels. We elected to\nuse the method presented in this article because we find it to\nbe the most straightforward to interpret. Future research us-\ning more complex measures and categorizations of weight\nhistory is needed.\nAnother limitation was our use of self-reported weight\nhistory. Although recalled weight has been found to be\nhighly correlated with measured weight, those who most\nseriously misreport weight gain may bias results, particu-\nlarly if participants with metabolic syndrome were more\nlikely to underreport previous weights. An additional limi-\ntation of this self-reported weight history questionnaire is\nthat the period of weight change differed based on current\nage, resulting in overlap between the prime age and midlife\nperiods. Alternate models that excluded participants aged\n60\u00ad64 years to create a more narrow current age range\nyielded generally similar results, but had less power due to\nreduced sample size. Finally, our analysis was based on\nsecular trend of increasing weight across all ages (35), it is\ndifficult to know whether these results are generalizable to\nother cohorts with different weight histories.\nDespite these limitations, this research has yielded impor-\ntant findings. Weight history confers information about met-\nabolic risk factors above and beyond attained BMI. In\nparticular, adult weight gain is related to risk of low HDL\nand high triglycerides. Weight history may contribute to our\nunderstanding of variability in cardiometabolic health within\ncategories of current weight status (e.g., why some obese\nolder persons are metabolically healthy but others are not).\nFunding\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholars program\nand National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (K12-\n"
