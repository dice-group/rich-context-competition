    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nGlu (glutamate), the excitatory transmitter at the main\nsignalling pathway in the retina, is critically involved in\nchanges in the protein repertoire through the activation of\nsignalling cascades, which regulate protein synthesis at\ntranscriptional and translational levels. Activity-dependent\ndifferential gene expression by Glu is related to the\nactivation of ionotropic and metabotropic Glu receptors;\nhowever, recent findings suggest the involvement of Na+-\ndependent Glu transporters in this process. Within the\nretina, Glu uptake is aimed at the replenishment of the re-\nleasable pool, and for the prevention of excitotoxicity and\nis carried mainly by the GLAST/EAAT-1 (Na+-dependent\nglutamate/aspartate transporter/excitatory amino acids\ntransporter-1) located in Mu\n\u00a8ller radial glia. Based on the\nprevious work showing the alteration of GLAST expression\ninduced by Glu, the present work investigates the\ninvolvement of GLAST signalling in the regulation of\nprotein synthesis in Mu\n\u00a8ller cells. To this end, we explored\nthe effect of D-Asp (D-aspartate) on Ser-2448 mTOR\n(mammalian target of rapamycin) phosphorylation in\nprimary cultures of chick Mu\n\u00a8ller glia. The results showed\nthat D-Asp transport induces the time- and dose-\ndependent phosphorylation of mTOR, mimicked by the\ntransportable GLAST inhibitor THA (threo-b-hydroxyaspar-\ntate). Signalling leading to mTOR phosphorylation includes\nCa2+ influx, the activation of p60src, phosphatidylinositol 3-\nkinase, protein kinase B, mTOR and p70S6K. Interestingly,\nGLAST activity promoted AP-1 (activator protein-1) binding\nto DNA, supporting a function for transporter signalling in\nretinal long-term responses. These results add a novel\nreceptor-independent pathway for Glu signalling in Mu\n\u00a8ller\nglia, and further strengthen the critical involvement of\nthese cells in the regulation of glutamatergic transmission\nin the retina.\n",

It also plays a key role in the\nregulation of gene expression required for physiological\nadaptive processes, including synaptic plasticity (Thomas and\nThe ability of Glu to drive a diversity of functions relates to\nits interaction with a wide variety of receptor subtypes and\ntransporters that act independently or in combination to\nattain differential responses. Glutamatergic activity is\nmediated by iGluRs (ionotropic receptors) and mGluRs (G-\nprotein-coupled metabotropic receptors).

To date, five subtypes of transporters known\nas EAAT1\u00ad5 (excitatory amino acids transporters 1\u00ad5) have\nbeen reported. The glia transporters EAAT-1 [GLAST (Na+-\ndependent glutamate/aspartate transporter)] and EAAT-2\n(GLT-1) are responsible for more than 90% of the Glu uptake\nin the brain.

In fact, Glu and\ntransportable blockers down-regulate Glu uptake in a\nreceptor-independent manner (Gonzalez and Ortega, 2000;\nGadea et al., 2004). Furthermore, the coupling of GLAST/\nEAAT-1 activity to the Na+/K+ ATPase in astrocytes\npromotion of mTOR phosphorylation in cerebellar glia\n(Zepeda et al., 2008) has also been reported.\nDysfunction of EAATs is specifically involved in excitotoxic\nneuronal death under pathological neurodegenerative con-\nditions and ischaemic stroke injury, characterized by the\nelevation of extracellular Glu. Hence, the characterization of\nsignalling mechanisms activated by transporter function may\nprovide tools for the modulation of EAAT function under\npathological conditions.\nIn order to provide evidence for GLAST/EAAT-1-mediated\nGlu signalling in the vertebrate retina, we analysed\ntransporter-dependent mTOR phosphorylation in primary\ncultures of chick MGC. Our results show that GLAST activity\ntriggers Ca2+ influx, and increases mTOR phosphorylation and\nAP-1 (activator protein-1) DNA-binding activity, suggesting\nthat Glu imbalance could alter the translation of proteins\ninvolved in gene regulation in the retina.\nMaterials\nTissue culture reagents were obtained from GE Healthcare.\nWortmannin, amiloride [3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N-(diamino-\nmethylene)pyrazine-2-carboxamide], PP2 {4-amino-5-(4-\nchlorophenyl)-7-(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine},\nW7 [N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide],\nAMPA, KA acid, NMDA, CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-\n2,3-dione), DL-TBOA (DL-threo-b-benzyloxyaspartic acid),\nTHA (threo-b-hydroxyaspartate), D-Asp and Glu were all\nobtained from Tocris-Cookson. 45Ca2+ and [a32P]dATP was\nfrom PerkinElmer.

The results presented in Figure 1(B) show that a\ntime-dependent increase in mTOR phosphorylation by Glu\nwas also induced by 1 mM D-Asp.

A discrete non-significant\nincrease in mTOR phosphorylation by AMPA and KA was\ndetected (Figure 1D), suggesting that the transporter activity\nis responsible for most, if not all, of the Glu-induced mTOR\nphosphorylation.\nIn order to confirm these results, MGC were treated for\n30 min, prior to D-Asp or THA addition, with 50 mM of the non-\nNMDA iGluR antagonist CNQX (Figure 2A), the NMDA receptor\nantagonist MK-801, the group I mGluR antagonist LAP5, or with\nCPCCOEt, the group II/III mGluR antagonist (Figures 2B and 2C).\nThe results showed that Glu receptor antagonists failed to block\nthe increase in mTOR phosphorylation induced by D-Asp or THA,\nfurther supporting the fact that the effect of Glu on mTOR is\nmainly transporter-mediated. Moreover, as D-Asp does not\nactivate Glu receptors, the lack of a statistically significant\ndifference between the Glu- and D-Asp-induced effects further\nindicates that mTOR phosphorylation is transporter-mediated.\nGLAST/EAAT-1-dependent mTOR\nphosphorylation\nIn order to directly confirm that the D-Asp-induced increase\nin mTOR phosphorylation relies on GLAST/EEAT-1 transport\nactivity, the effect of transportable and non-transportable\nGLAST inhibitors was analysed. As shown in Figure 3(A), D-\nAsp-induced increase in mTOR phosphorylation was mimicked\nby 100 mM of the transportable inhibitors THA and PDC. In\ncontrast, the non-transportable inhibitor TBOA (100 mM) had\nno effect. As the expression of EAAT-4 in MGC has been\nrecently reported (Fyk-Kolodziej et al., 2004), we evaluated\nthe involvement of this transporter in mTOR phosphorylation.\nAs clearly shown in Figure 3(B), pretreatment with the\nspecific EAAT-4 blocker T3MG did not alter the D-Asp\nresponse, ruling out the participation of EAAT-4.\nIf, indeed, the effect of D-Asp and THA is mediated by\nGLAST activity, it should be abolished in the Na+-free\nmedium. As clearly shown in Figure 3(C), mTOR phosphoryla-\ntion was completely prevented by substituting choline\nchloride for NaCl, clearly demonstrating the involvement of\nNa+-dependent transport in this process. In order to provide\nevidence for transporter-mediated mTOR activation, we\nFigure 1 D-Asp induces Ser-2448 mTOR phosphorylation\n(A) MGC were treated with 1 mM Glu for the indicated time periods, and the level of total and Ser-2448 phosphorylated mTOR were\nanalysed by Western blot as described in the Materials and methods section.

Exposure of the cultured\ncells to D-Asp or THA results in a rapamycin-sensitive increase\nin 4E-BP phosphorylation.\nGLAST-induced mTOR phosphorylation is\nCa2+-dependent\nIntracellular Na+ increase driven by GLAST may activate Na+/\nCa2+ exchange, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca2+\nconcentration. In order to assess the Ca2+-dependence of the\nGLAST response, the cells were treated with D-Asp or THA in\nCa2+-free medium supplemented with 500 mM EDTA. As\nshown in Figure 4(A), removal of extracellular Ca2+ fully\nprevented the GLAST effect on mTOR phosphorylation. These\nresults demonstrate that GLAST-mediated mTOR phosphor-\nylation requires Ca2+ influx. As a possible mechanism linking\ntransporter activity to Ca2+ entry, the activation of the Na+/\nCa2+ exchanger by GLAST-mediated Na+ influx was ex-\nplored using the inhibitors amiloride and KB-R7943. The\nresults in Figure 4(B) show that both compounds prevented\nD-Asp-induced mTOR phosphorylation. Since calmodulin is\nthe main Ca2+ intracellular receptor, its possible participation\nin GLAST induction of Ca2+-dependent mTOR activation was\nexplored. The results in Figure 4(C) show that 25 mM of the\ncalmodulin antagonist W7 fully prevented the D-Asp\nresponse. Collectively, these data indicate that the D-\nAsp increase in mTOR phosphorylation is achieved through\nthe entry of Na+ as a result of GLAST activity and the\nconsequent activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which, in\nturn, increases the intracellular Ca2+ that binds to calmodulin.\nTo further confirm this conclusion, confluent MGC cultures\nwere exposed to a 1 mM D-Asp solution containing 1 mCi/ml\n45Ca2+ for various time periods. As shown in Figure 5(A),\nD-Asp induced a fast time-dependent influx of 45Ca2+, which\nsaturated at 3 min. As expected, removal of extracellular Na+\nions prevents the D-Asp-induced 45Ca2+ influx (Figure 5B).

In contrast, the non-transportable\nGLAST inhibitor TBOA did not induce 45Ca2+ influx\n(Figure 5D). The EAAT-4 blocker T3MG failed to prevent the\nD-Asp-evoked response (Figure 5E). Furthermore, the Na+/\nCa2+ exchanger specific inhibitor KB-R7943 prevented the D-\nAsp-triggered increase in 45Ca2+ influx (Figure 5F), clearly\nindicating a transporter-induced effect. To rule out the\nparticipation of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels\n(VGCC), confluent MGC cultures were pre-incubated with\n10 mM nifedipine and the effect of D-Asp measured. As\nshown in Figure 5(G), pre-incubation with nifedipine did not\nmodify the D-Asp-dependent Ca2+ influx.\nIntracellular signalling involved in GLAST-\nmediated mTOR phosphorylation\nTo establish the molecular signalling cascade involved in\nGLAST-mediated mTOR phosphorylation, we first explored the\nparticipation of PI3K, known to act upstream of mTOR in\nseveral systems. Pretreatment of MGC for 15 min with 10 nM\nof the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, completely prevented the\nincrease in mTOR phosphorylation induced by either D-Asp or\nTHA (Figure 6A).\nThe phosphorylation of membrane phosphatidylinositol at\nthe C3-OH position of the inositol ring by PI3K is known to\nanchor proteins containing PH (pleckstrin homology) domains\n(Harrington et al., 2004), such as PKB. The results in\nFigure 6(B) demonstrate that 100 nM of the PKB inhibitor\nPKBI-IV was capable of preventing the GLAST-mediated\neffect, indicating the involvement of PKB, downstream of\nPI3K, in GLAST-dependent mTOR phosphorylation.\nActivation of PI3K involves the docking of the re-\ngulatory subunit of PI3K to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue\n(Vanhaesebroeck and Alessi, 2000). We evaluated the possible\ninvolvement of the Src (non-receptor tyrosine kinase p60src)\nin GLAST signalling. As clearly shown in Figure 6(C), MGC\npretreatment with 10 nM of the specific Src inhibitor PP2,\nprevented the D-Asp effect on mTOR. Since Src activation\nrequires Tyr-527 in a dephosphorylated state, we examined the\nphosphorylation level of this residue in D-Asp-stimulated MGC\nand showed that, indeed, D-Asp treatment sharply reduced\nTyr-527 p60src phosphorylation levels (Figure 6D).

The results\nshown in Figure 7(B) clearly demonstrate that Na+/Ca2+\nexchanger and calmodulin participates in the transcriptional\nregulation mediated by GLAST.\nDISCUSSION\nTraditionally regarded as supportive and passive elements,\nglia cells have proven to be critically involved in glutama-\ntergic transmission (Eulenburg and Gomeza, 2010). The\nparticipation of glia cells in the control of excitatory\ntransmission through the so-called Glu/glutamine shuttle,\nwhich replenishes releasable Glu stores in neurons, has been\nrecognized for more than 25 years (Shank and Campbell,\n1984). Furthermore, an energetic neuronal dependence on\nastrocytes has also been described for glutamatergic synapses\n(Pellerin, 2008). In spite of the fact that most Glu receptors\nare expressed in glia cells (D'Antoni et al., 2008), the\navailability of Glu for inter-neuronal and neuron\u00adglia\nFigure 4 D-Asp-induced mTOR phosphorylation is a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-dependent event\nmTOR phosphorylation was detected as for Figure 1.

It is\ntherefore conceivable that transporters may contribute to\nGlu signalling, particularly in glia cells. In this context, we\nhave described the regulation of Glu removal in radial glia\ncells by a transporter-mediated process involving the regu-\nlation of GLAST/EAAT-1 membrane expression (Gonzalez and\nHampson have demonstrated a direct coupling of Glu\ntransporters to the Na,K-ATPase in glia cells (Rose et al.,\n2009). In such a scenario, it is tempting to speculate that\nintracellular signalling activated by Glu transporters could be\nlinked to the long-term regulation of glia\u00adneuronal reciprocal\ninteractions in excitatory transmission.\nThe results from this study clearly show that the transport\nprocess itself triggers a signal transduction cascade involving\nthe activation of p60src, PI3K and PKB (Akt) linked to\nextracellular Ca2+ entry, which leads, not only to the\npromotion of translation by Ser-2448 phosphorylated\nmTOR, but also to transcriptional activity mediated by\nCa2+-dependent binding of inducible transcription factors,\nsuch as the AP-1. In this regard, the activation of CaMKII\ninduces the phosphorylation/activation of RTKs which, in\nturn, allows PI3K membrane anchoring and activation (Wang\nand Proud, 2011). We show here, that Ca2+ entry promoted by\nGLAST activity induces a transient mTOR phosphorylation\npossible that the Ca2+ signal activates phosphatase 2A that\nwould dephosphorylate and inactivate p70S6K, thus reducing\nmTOR Ser-2448 phosphorylation giving up the transient\nnature of the effect (Nunbhakdi-Craig et al., 2002).\nFurthermore, as CaMKII has been shown to activate the\nexpression of c-fos through the MAPK MEK/ERK cascade in\nMu\n\u00a8ller glia, the proposed GLAST signalling cascade is\nsupported by the increase in AP-1 binding (Abe and Saito,\nAs mTOR has been regarded as a master regulator of protein\nsynthesis (Foster and Fingar, 2010) and AP-1 DNA binding is\ncritical for the transcriptional control of a number of genes\n(Shaulian, 2010), it is possible that the removal of Glu from the\nsynaptic cleft is linked to gene expression regulation in glia\ncells. A working hypothesis is that specific genes, such as those\ncoding for the Glu transporters, the Na+/K+-ATPase, glutamine\nsynthetase or the neutral amino acid transporters could be the\ntargets of GLAST-dependent gene expression regulation, and\ncould participate actively in glia\u00adneuronal coupling. Work\ncurrently in progress in our group is aimed at the identification\nof these genes.

The elevation of\nintracellular Ca2+ leads to the up-regulation of c-fos transcription and the promotion of AP-1 DNA-binding activity. On the other\nhand, Ca2+ entry results in p60src Tyr-527 dephosphorylation and Trk transactivation, the recruitment and activation of PI3K and Akt/\nPKB, which, in turn, results in mTOR phosphorylation and an increase in mRNA translation.\n\u00b4pez-Colome\n\u00b4 and others\n340 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nnutrient availability correlated with protein synthesis for\nhousekeeping glial functions, transporter signalling to mTOR\nand gene expression could play a role in linking these responses\n(towards cell division).\nThe functional significance of signalling through the\ntransporters compared with the cascades activated via Glu\nreceptors, and the fact that both would lead to gene expression\nregulation in glia cells (Lopez-Bayghen et al., 2006), is elu-\nsive at this point.
