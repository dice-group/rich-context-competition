Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) was used to collect data from a statewide sample of adults in\nMichigan identified through random-digit dialing (n = 560). CATI interviews were supplemented with web- and paper-based\nsurveys for nonrespondents. We used latent class analysis to characterize patterns in public perception, using a vignette\ntechnique that assessed (a) whether adults recognize adolescent marijuana use as a problem, (b) how they view the efficacy\nof treatment, (c) how they view help-seeking with mental health professionals, and (d) whether they support prevention\nservices for adolescents. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between class membership\nand demographics, substance use, and methodological factors. Three latent classes were identified: (a) a discriminating group,\n(b) a low-concern group, and (c) a high-concern group. Age and substance use were among the strongest determinants for\nmembership in the discriminating group.

Estimates from the National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health suggest that there are 18.1 million current\n(past month) marijuana users in the United States (Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n[SAMHSA], 2012). Among American illicit drug users,\nroughly two thirds (64.3%) report the use of only marijuana\n(SAMHSA, 2012). Marijuana use often begins during adoles-\ncence1 and by 12th grade, 36% of young people in the United\nStates report past-year marijuana use (Johnston, O'Malley,\nBachman, & Schulenberg, 2012). Rates of recent (past\n30 day) marijuana use among adolescents now exceed rates\nrespectively; Johnston et al., 2012). Annual prevalence data\nhave also documented increases in the rates of marijuana use\n(Johnston et al., 2012). Among adolescents and young adults\nwho use marijuana, approximately 26% meet Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.;\nDSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) crite-\nria for marijuana abuse or dependence (Wu, Woody, Yang,\nPan, & Blazer, 2011). Approximately half of the individuals\nwho enter treatment for marijuana use are below the age of 25\n(Budney, Roffman, Stephens, & Walker, 2007).\nWhile marijuana use is relatively common, it has been\nconnected to several adverse outcomes, particularly among\nadolescents. Adolescent marijuana use has been associated\nwith an increased risk of a range of negative health outcomes,\nincluding future depression and anxiety disorders (Rey,\nMartin, & Krabman, 2004), fatal automobile crashes\n(Asbridge, Hayden, & Cartwright, 2012), accidental injuries,\nchronic bronchitis, and respiratory infections (Hall &\nDegenhardt, 2009). As adolescent brains are still developing,\nthe results of frequent marijuana use are a particular concern\namong this age group. Frequent marijuana use among ado-\nlescents can have a detrimental impact on cognitive func-\ntioning and may affect functional and structural development\nin areas of the brain involved in higher intellectual capabili-\nties (Lisdahl, Nagel, & Tapert, 2010; Schweinsburg, Brown,\n& Tapert, 2008).

Resko1\n Keywords\npublic perception, marijuana, adolescents, latent class analysis\n2 SAGE Open\n1,000 people, for example, found individuals who used mari-\njuana heavily in adolescence and continued through adult-\nhood showed a significant drop in IQ between the ages of 13\nand 38 (Meier et al., 2012). Under the influence of marijuana,\nadolescents also may display impaired judgment, contribut-\ning to risky behaviors such as unprotected sex, driving under\nthe influence, or riding with an intoxicated driver (Gruber &\nPope, 2002). Earlier age of onset for marijuana use is associ-\nated with increased risk of developing substance-use prob-\nlems (Brook, Brook, Zhang, Cohen, & Whiteman, 2002;\nDespite these potential consequences, the levels of per-\nceived risk and disapproval of marijuana among adults and\nadolescents are low and steadily declining (Gallup, 2011;\nJohnston et al., 2012). When Gallup, for example, first sur-\nveyed adults in the United States regarding marijuana legal-\nization in 1969, only 12% favored it. Results of a more recent\nsurvey indicate that 50% of Americans now support mari-\njuana legalization (Gallup, 2011). Among adolescents, the\nperceived risk associated with marijuana use has been declin-\noccasional marijuana use as a great risk (Johnston et al.,\n2012). Studies suggest that adolescents who believe a par-\nticular substance involves low levels of risk of harm and/or\nwho approve of its use are more likely to use that substance\n(Cleveland, Feinberg, Bontempo, & Greenberg, 2008). The\nrecent declines in perceived risk are indicative of recent\nshifts in American community norms that are more tolerant\nSeptember 2013, twenty U.S. states and the District of\nColumbia have enacted laws making medical marijuana\nlegal for adults.2 Approximately 70% of adults in the United\nStates favor laws making it legal for doctors to prescribe\nmarijuana to reduce pain and suffering (Gallup, 2011). Voters\nhave also recently approved ballot measures to legalize rec-\nreational marijuana use among adults in Colorado and\nWashington State. Although these policies have received\nbroad public support, there is some concern that these\nchanges could lead to increases in access to marijuana and\nincreases in the likelihood and frequency of marijuana use\namong children and adolescents (Freise & Grube, 2013).\nFew studies have examined the public's perceptions of,\nand response to, marijuana use in adolescents. Previous\nresearch on the attitudes toward adolescent marijuana use\nhas focused on the views of adolescents (e.g., Cleveland\n(e.g., Fisher et al., 2006; Winters, Anderson, Bengston,\nStinchfield, & Latimer, 2000). Little is known about the gen-\neral public's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward adoles-\ncent marijuana use and related problems. While the recent\nopinion polls (e.g., Gallup, 2011) and referenda indicate some\nleniency toward marijuana (Freise & Grube, 2013), there are\nat this time few accompanying indicators of a strong commit-\nment to prevention of use among the adolescent population.\nAdolescents rarely enter into substance-abuse treatment\nindependently (Godley & White, 2005). Consequently, their\nsubstance-abuse prevention and treatment needs must be\nunderstood in the context of familial, social, and cultural\nexpectations. Until service providers understand the public's\nideas and expectations, they cannot adequately anticipate\nbarriers to treatment that need to be surmounted before ado-\nlescents can benefit. Furthermore, even when adolescents do\nenter into treatment, treatment goals will likely be derailed if\nparental and community beliefs counter treatment recom-\nThe purpose of the current study is to use a person-cen-\ntered approach to examine patterns in the public perception\nand attitude toward marijuana use among adolescents.\nPerson centered-models (e.g., latent class analysis [LCA],\nmixture modeling, growth mixture models, cluster analysis)\nhighlight the heterogeneity within data and can help to iden-\ntify groups of individuals who share similar attributes or\nrelationships among attributes (Laursen & Hoff, 2006). This\napproach contrasts the more dominant variable-centered\nresearch paradigm which describes associations between\nvariables rather than individuals.3 LCA is a form of person-\ncentered analysis that has been widely used in the substance-\nuse field (e.g., B. O. Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2000; O'Connor &\nColder, 2005). Classes of distinct subgroups are identified\nbased on similar response patterns for a set of indicator vari-\nables (McCutcheon, 1987). For the present study, we use\nLCA to characterize patterns based on whether adults in\nMichigan (a) recognize adolescent marijuana use as a prob-\nlem, (b) view treatment to be effective for adolescent mari-\njuana use, (c) view help-seeking with mental health\nprofessionals to be an appropriate strategy for addressing\nadolescent marijuana use, and (d) whether they support pre-\nvention services for adolescents. After identifying these\nclasses that share similar configurations of their public per-\nception of adolescent marijuana use, we explore whether\ndemographic characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, being\na parent), personal experiences with alcohol and drugs, and\nmethodological factors (e.g., type of survey) are associated\nwith different class memberships. Based on previous studies\nthat found an individual's own use of substances contributes\nto their broader opinions of substance use (Hilton &\nKaskutas, 1991; Latimer, Harwood, Newcomb, & Wagenaar,\nwe hypothesize that each participant's personal experience\nwith alcohol and other substances will influence his or her\nopinions on adolescent marijuana use. Building on earlier\nsubstance-use studies (e.g., Pukstas, 2006), we also antici-\npate that parental status and other demographic variables\n(e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and gender) would influence par-\nticipants' attitudes and beliefs related to adolescent mari-\njuana use.\nMethod\nSurvey Sample and Procedures\nWe used computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)\nto collect data from a statewide sample of adults in Michigan.\nMichigan provides a useful context for this particular study,\ngiven that its voters approved the use of medical marijuana\nfor adults in a 2008 statewide ballot measure by a substantial\nmargin. Random-digit dialing was used to identify a sample\nof 4,445 active telephone numbers. Surveys were conducted\nwith households where a person 18 or above agreed to par-\nticipate. To ensure an adequate sample size and inclusion of\nindividuals with only wireless telephone service or with no\nphone service at all (Galesic, Tourangeau, & Couper, 2006),\nthe telephone survey was supplemented with paper- and\nweb-based surveys for nonrespondents. With the assistance\nof a directory information service provider, we were able to\nappend addresses to about half of the active telephone num-\nattempts, paper copies of the surveys were sent to all nonre-\nspondents for which we had a mailing address (n = 1,720).\nThe mailed packet also included information on how to\naccess the survey online, including the web address and a\nlog-in ID and password. Individuals who indicated they did\nnot have time to complete the survey over the telephone were\nalso provided with the web address to complete the survey\nonline or were offered the survey by mail. Participants were\noffered a US$5 gift card for their participation.\nAfter 2 months of telephone interviewing and the mailing\nto survey nonrespondents, data collection ceased. The total\nnumber of unduplicated completed surveys was 624. During\nwere removed from the survey sample due to known ineligi-\nbility (having dispositions such as disconnected number,\nbusiness number, fax/modem, unqualified resident). Using\nguidelines from theAmericanAssociation for Public Opinion\nResearch (AAPOR, 2011), we calculated the response rate,\nmargin of error and response rate.4 A response rate of 25.8%\nwas obtained for the statewide survey and the margin of error\nwas \u00b13.8 percentage points. The cooperation rate was 58.3%.\nFor the current study, 64 participants were excluded from\nanalyses due to nonresponse on all of the vignette questions.\nThis results in an analytic sample size of n = 560.\nMeasures\nFor the current study, we adapted a vignette technique that\nhas been used in public opinion research on mental illness\n(Pescosolido et al., 2008). Two vignettes describing mari-\njuana use among 16-year-old adolescents were developed.\nBy focusing on this age, we were able to ensure participants\nwould be older than the adolescents described in the\nvignettes. We also felt there may be greater variability in the\nattitudes toward marijuana use among 16-year-olds com-\npared with younger adolescents (e.g., 13-year-olds). These\nvignettes featured varying contexts, levels of marijuana use,\nand problems associated with use.\nAfter each of the vignettes, participants were asked as\nseries of questions in response to the situation that was\ndescribed (see the appendix for the vignettes and additional\nsurvey items). These questions addressed perception of prob-\nlem severity, belief in treatment efficacy, and attitude toward\nhelp-seeking with a professional. The first question mea-\nsured the perception of problem severity by asking: \"How\nserious would you consider this teen's problem, if any, to\nbe?\" (very serious, somewhat serious, not very serious, or\nnot at all serious). The next question addressed the belief in\ntreatment efficacy and asked, \"How likely do you think it is\nthat would this situation improve with treatment?\" (very\nlikely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely).\nThe third question addressed help-seeking behaviors: \"If this\nchild were your own, how likely is it that you would seek\nhelp from a doctor, nurse, counselor, psychologist, social\nworker, or other mental health professional?\" (very likely,\nsomewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely).\nResponses on these three questions were dichotomized to\ncreate indicator variables for the LCA. Responses for the\nproblem severity question were coded as 1 for serious (com-\nbining very serious and somewhat serious) and 0 for not seri-\nous (combining not very serious and not at all serious). The\nother items were coded 1 for likely (combining very likely\nand somewhat likely) and 0 for unlikely (combining some-\nwhat unlikely and very unlikely). One additional question\nfrom previous public opinion research (Pukstas, 2006) asked\nparticipants about their general support for marijuana pre-\nvention efforts. This item evaluated the level of agreement\nwith the statement, \"It is possible to reduce marijuana prob-\nlems through prevention\" (strongly agree, somewhat agree,\nor somewhat disagree or strongly disagree). Responses for\nthis question were also coded as 1 for likely (combining very\nlikely and somewhat likely) and 0 for unlikely (combining\nsomewhat unlikely and very unlikely). These seven items (six\nquestions based on the vignettes and the one question\naddressing marijuana prevention more generally) were com-\nbined and used as the indicator variables for the LCA.\nAdditional survey items were included as independent\nand control variables. These included the participant's demo-\ngraphic/background characteristics, substance use, and the\ndata collection strategy (see the appendix for specific survey\nitems). Demographic measures included age (in years), gen-\nder (male or female), and marital status (coded as married\nand cohabitating vs. not married). Highest level of educa-\ntional attainment was measured and responses were coded\ninto two groups (1 for those with bachelor's degree or higher\nand 0 for those with less than a bachelor's degree). Parental\nstatus was measured with two items assessing whether par-\nticipants have children (including adult children) and whether\nthey have children are below age 18 in their household. Two\nquestions from the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan\net al., 2002) were included to ask about recent experiences\n4 SAGE Open\nwith alcohol or marijuana. These items asked \"How many\ndays in the past month have you used alcohol?\" and \"How\nmany days in the past month have you used marijuana?\" An\nadditional item from the National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth (SAMHSA, 2012) was adapted to measure lifetime\nexperiences with drugs other than marijuana. This question\nasked: In your lifetime, have you ever tried other illicit drugs\n(other than marijuana), like cocaine or crack or heroin, or\nany other substance not prescribed by a doctor, to get high or\nto achieve an altered state? Two final items were used to\nassess the impact of the recruitment strategy. These items\nexamined the extent of landline telephone usage (less than\n1/3 of telephone calls on a landline coded as 1 and 1/3 or\ngreater coded as 0) and survey mode (CATI, web, or paper).\nAnalytic Strategy\nLCA is a form of person-centered analysis and is used to\nidentify different and distinct patterns within the broader\npopulation, based on the similarity of responses to the ado-\nlescent marijuana use variables (e.g., problem recognition,\nand treatment efficacy). This approach may facilitate the\nidentification of particular subgroups within the population\nthat vary in the extent to which they view adolescent sub-\nstance abuse as a problem and the extent to which they sup-\nport substance-abuse treatment for problems related to\nadolescent marijuana use. We compared a series of latent\nclass models to determine the optimal model in terms of bal-\nancing model fit and parsimony. Multiple indicators were\nexamined to assess model fit, including the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978), entropy and\naverage latent class posterior probabilities, the number and\npercentage of participants in the smallest class, and interpret-\nability of results.\nThe BIC (Sclove, 1987) is considered to be one of the\nmore reliable indicators of model fit in LCA (Nylund,\nLower BIC values indicate better model fit. BIC can be used\nto assess relative fit when comparing models with various\nnumbers of classes (e.g., two classes vs. three classes).\nPosterior probabilities provide another criterion to assess\nmodel fit in LCA. Rather than assigning each individual par-\nticipant to a specific class (as is done in cluster analysis), in\nLCA each participant is assigned a probability value for\nmembership in each class. These probabilities are a function\nof each individual's response patterns, the number of latent\nclasses, and the proportion of individuals estimated to be in\neach class (Roesch, Villodas, & Villodas, 2010). In a well-\nfitting model, each participant will have a high probability of\nmembership in one class and low probability of membership\nin all other classes. Entropy provides an aggregate measure\nof the posterior probabilities and is an indicator of how well\nclasses can be distinguished. Entropy values above 0.8 are\nconsidered acceptable (Ramaswamy, DeSarbo, Reibstein, &\nalso be taken into consideration when comparing latent class\nmodels. Classes with less than 5% of the sample in the small-\nest group are generally discouraged unless smaller groups\nare expected, based on theory or epidemiology (Weller,\nBowen, & Bowen, 2013).The final and perhaps most impor-\ntant model selection criteria are substantive meaning and\ninterpretability (B. O. Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2000; O'Connor &\nColder, 2005). According to numerous LCA experts, sub-\nstantive meaning and interpretability are critical consider-\nations that can sometimes supersede statistical criteria for\nselection of the final latent class model (B. O. Muth\u00e9n &\nOnce the final latent class model was identified, we con-\nducted multinomial logistic regression to investigate the\nrelationship between class membership and demographic\ncharacteristics, substance use, and the data collection strat-\negy. Race/ethnicity, initially classified into five categories in\ndescriptive analysis (i.e., non-Hispanic White, African\nAmerican, Hispanic, Asian American, and Other) was con-\nverted into dichotomous variables (i.e., White and non-\nWhite) for multinomial logistic regression because of small\nsample sizes in several groups. Data were weighted using\nsampling weights that adjust for oversampling based on age,\ngender and race/ethnicity. Latent class models were con-\nducted in Mplus version 6.12 (L. K. Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n,\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics5\nwith an average age of 49 years (SD = 16.3). Half of the par-\nticipants (49%) were female, and more than half (60%) were\nmarried or cohabitating. Most of the participants (77%) self-\nidentified their primary racial or ethnic origin as white/\nCaucasian, while a smaller proportion of participants identi-\nfied themselves as Black/African American (13%), Latino/\nHispanic, American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, or Arab/\nMiddle Eastern (less than 3% for each of these groups). While\nthe majority of participants (79%) reported having children,\nonly 39% had children under the age of 18. Regarding educa-\ntional level, 58% had earned a high school diploma/GED or\nless, while 42% of participants had completed a college\ndegree (26% had completed a bachelor's degree and 16% had\ncompleted a graduate or professional degree). More than half\nthe sample (54%) reported recent (past 30 day) alcohol use,\nwhile only 6% reported recent (past 30 day) marijuana use.\nAlmost a quarter of participants in the sample (22%) reported\nthat they have used nonmedical prescription drugs or illicit\ndrugs other than marijuana in their lifetimes.\nMost participants (74%) completed the survey through\nthe CATI, while smaller numbers completed the web (2%) or\npaper (24%) surveys. Approximately a third of participants\n(37%) reported that they receive few of their telephone calls\n(one third or less) on a land-based telephone line; 18%\nreported receiving between 1/3 and 2/3 of their calls on a\nlandline. Just under half of the sample (45%) reported receiv-\ning most of their phone calls (2/3 or more) on a land-based\ntelephone.\nFifty-four percent of participants considered the first sce-\nnario to be a serious problem. For the second scenario, the\nmajority of participants (92%) identified the situation as a\nserious problem. Approximately one third of participants\n(32%) felt the situation in scenario one would improve with\ntreatment, while 83% felt the situation in scenario two would.\nA large proportion of participants reported that they would\nseek help from a health professional (e.g., doctor nurse,\ncounselor, psychologist, social worker) if the teens in the\nscenarios were their own children (66% for scenario one and\n83% for scenario two). Most participants (86%) agreed with\nthe statement that it is possible to reduce marijuana problems\nthrough prevention.\nLCA\nWe determined that the three class model provided a more\noptimal solution, compared with one- two-, three-, four-class\nmodels. The three class model exhibited the best empirical fit\nand had a clearly distinguishable set of classes that were con-\nceptually plausible. Figure 1 presents the adolescent mari-\njuana use ratings for each class. The seven marijuana indicator\nvariables are along the x-axis and the probabilities of class\nmembership are plotted along the y-axis. The probability of\nclass membership represents the average probability that\nmembers in a class reported high scores (indicator variable =\n1) on each item. The distinguishing features of each class\nwere used in selecting names for each class. The first class\nhad moderate probabilities for problem recognition and help-\nseeking for the first vignette (Class 1: \"discriminating class\"\n26.7%). This class had higher probabilities of problem recog-\nnition and help-seeking for the second vignette, which\ninvolved more problems (e.g., problems at school, marijuana\npossession arrest). The second class had low probabilities of\nproblem recognition and help-seeking behaviors for both\nvignettes (Class 2: \"low concern\" 7.0%). The final and largest\nclass, had high probabilities of problem recognition and help-\nseeking across the two scenarios (Class 3: \"high concern\"\nMultinomial Logistic Regression\nTo learn more about patterns related to the public perceptions\nof adolescent marijuana use, we looked at demographic char-\nacteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, being a parent), alcohol\nand drug use, and methodological factors (e.g., type of sur-\nvey) for each of the public perception latent classes, using\nmultinomial logistic regression analysis. The multinomial\nlogistic regression model was estimated by entering all vari-\nables simultaneously. Each latent class is compared with the\nhigh-concern reference group (Class 3). Table 1 describes the\nrelationships between the public perception classes and the\nstudy variables. When comparing the discriminating group\n(Class 1) to the high-concern group (Class 3), there were sev-\neral notable differences. The discriminating group (Class 1)\nwas significantly younger than the high-concern group\n(Class 3). Other demographic variables (i.e., gender, race,\neducation, marital status, and parental status) were not sig-\nnificantly different between the discriminating and high-con-\ncern public perception groups. The variables indicating\nsubstance use of the respondent were among the strongest\ndeterminants of group membership. Adults in the discrimi-\nnating group (Class 1) were more likely than the high-con-\ncern group (Class 3) to report alcohol or marijuana use in the\npast 30 days (alcohol odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; confidence\n11.80]). Those participants in the discriminating group (Class 1)\nwere also more likely than the high-concern group to report\nuse of drugs other than marijuana (lifetime; OR = 2.24 CI =\n2) to the high-concern group (Class 3), there were no dis-\ncernible differences.\nDiscussion\nThe health, psychosocial, and legal consequences associated\nwith marijuana use can be serious and the results of this\nstudy suggest that most adults have concerns about mari-\njuana use among adolescents. The largest group of partici-\npants (Class 3 \"high-concern group\" n = 476) recognized\nboth situations in the vignettes as potential problems. The\nsecond largest group of adults (Class 1 \"discriminating\ngroup\" n = 173) ascribed different levels of problem severity\nto the hypothetical situations. These adults appeared to have\nfewer concerns with marijuana use that occurred in a social\nV1: Problem\nRecognion\nV2: Problem\nRecognion\nV1: Improve\nwith\nTreatment\nV2: Improve\nwith\nTreatment\nProfessional\nHelp\nProfessional\nHelp\nMJ\nPrevenon\nFigure 1.

Adults\nin this discriminating class (Class 1) were more concerned\nby the vignette that involved marijuana use in multiple con-\ntexts (e.g., social settings and alone) and several problems\nrelated or potentially related to marijuana use (e.g., falling\ngrades, school suspension, and marijuana possession arrest).\nThis finding may reflect the attitude that experimentation\nwith marijuana during adolescence or young adulthood does\nnot necessarily indicate a very serious problem. For many\nadolescents, marijuana use is developmentally limited and\ndoes not lead to substance-use problems later in life\n(Schulenberg et al., 2005). It also may reflect the popular\nperception that marijuana is not considered an \"addictive\"\ndrug.\nParticipants in Classes 1 (discriminating group) and 3\n(high-concern group) reported stronger beliefs in treatment\neffectiveness, particularly in reacting to the second vignette.\nThese groups also showed higher levels of support for help-\nseeking and indicated greater willingness to seek profes-\nsional help if the adolescents described were their own\nchildren. It is possible that this willingness may be over-\nstated. Previous research using vignettes and hypothetical\nhas shown that willingness to seek help is likely to be lower\nwhen faced with a similar situation in real life. Regardless,\nthese results provide insight into how the general public\nassesses risk and views treatment for marijuana use among\nadolescents.\nResults indicate that individuals in the discriminating\ngroup (Class 1) were significantly younger and reported\nhigher rates of current substance use, compared with the\nhigh-concern group (Class 3). The finding that the discrimi-\nnating group was significantly younger is consistent with\npublic opinion research that has demonstrated some differ-\nences in attitudes toward marijuana along age lines. Analysis\nof the General Social Survey, for example, suggests that the\nage cohort least likely to favor marijuana legalization in\nthe United States (Caulkins, Coulson, Farber, & Vesely,\n2012). The findings of the current study suggest that one's\npersonal experiences with alcohol and drugs may also be\nimportant factors in shaping individual dispositions to con-\nsider a situation problematic and urge treatment. Sherman,\nNelson, and Steele (2000) suggested that individuals often\ninterpret situations involving health risks in such a way that\nthey can preserve a positive self-image. It is therefore not\nsurprising that many marijuana users do not see their use as\nparticularly risky or problematic (Kilmer, Hunt, Lee, &\nNeighbors, 2007). The current study further suggests that\nthese types of assessments may also hold true when assess-\ning the risks for adolescent marijuana use.\nAlthough most participants (93%) expressed some con-\ncern related to the vignettes involving adolescent marijuana\nuse, a small group did not consider either of the situations in\nthe vignettes to be problematic or situations where they\nwould seek treatment if the teens were their own children\n(Class 2; n = 52). In terms of their demographic background\nand substance-use characteristics, the low-concern group\n(Class 2) was fairly similar to the high-concern group (Class\n3) that identified both vignettes as hypothesizing serious\nproblems. Although these groups are similar with regard to\nrecent alcohol and marijuana use, it is unclear whether these\nTable 1.

Other\nstudies have suggested that individual' past experiences\nusing marijuana are an important determinant in the per-\nceived risk associated with marijuana use (Kilmer et al.,\n2007) and the attitude toward marijuana policies (Williams,\nvan Ours, & Grossman, 2011). In a sample of college stu-\ndents, Kilmer and colleagues (2007) found that the perceived\nrisk associated with marijuana use was greater among nonus-\ners of marijuana than among those who did. Williams et al.\n(2011) similarly found in the Australian Drug Strategy's\nNational Household Survey that both current marijuana use\nand past use were significantly associated with supporting\nmarijuana legalization. Future research on public attitudes\ntoward adolescent marijuana use should explore whether\nthere are any differences in past substance use and substance-\nuse related consequences over the life span and if these fac-\ntors are likely to impact group membership.\nLimitations and Future Research\nResults of this research should be viewed in the context of its\nlimitations. Due to the low response rate, generalizability\nmay be limited. The CATI helped us to achieve a relatively\nhigh level of coverage of the state population and ensured\nprivacy and accuracy of reports of sensitive information\n(Galesic et al., 2006). However, its use may have also\nresulted in some bias. Sampling for this multimethod survey\nwas conducted using random-digit dialing and may under-\nrepresent those individuals who do not have a telephone or\nwho only have mobile phones. Although 20.0% of our sam-\nple reported that they receive all of their phone calls on a\nmobile telephone, this number is likely to be lower than the\nrate of wireless-only households in Michigan. Estimates\nfrom the National Health Interview Survey, for example,\nsuggest that, during the period which this study was con-\nducted, 29.2% of households in Michigan were wireless only\n(Blumberg et al., 2011). Previous research on telephone sur-\nveys has also indicated that demographic factors such as\nincome and employment are significantly related to partici-\npation (Johnson, Holbrook, Cho, & Bossarte, 2006). It is\npossible that these factors are also related to variables in this\nstudy. Finally, it is also worth noting that the assessments\nwere limited in scope and focused on just the two situations\ndescribed in the vignettes. Future studies would benefit from\nusing a broader range of situations that include more varied\nlevels of substance use, use of other substances and more\nvaried characteristics of the adolescents (e.g., gender, age,\nrace) as well as more detailed measures (e.g., lifetime sub-\nstance-use experiences). The current study reflects only on\nthe public attitude toward 16-year-old adolescents and does\nnot reflect attitude toward older or younger adolescents.\nAdditional research on other ages and research using other\nsamples are also needed to establish stronger confidence in\nthe classes derived from the current data (Bauer, 2007;\nRoesch et al., 2010). The current application of LCA is a\ngood first step toward this end.\nConclusion\nThe current study used a vignette technique to examine the\nattitudes and beliefs held by the general public about adoles-\ncent marijuana use. Marijuana has generally been perceived\nas being associated with a lower level of risk, and both ado-\nlescents and adults may be less likely to perceive a need to\ntreat adolescent marijuana problems. Understanding the pub-\nlic's views is important as the number of state-level policies\nproviding adults access to marijuana for medical and recre-\national purposes increases. Public opinion can help to shape\nwhat individuals consider to be a problem and what advice is\ngiven to adolescents and caregivers of adolescents facing\nproblems related to marijuana. The attitudes and beliefs of\nthe general public have been noticeably absent from the\nresearch literature. The present study offers insight into how\nthe general public responds to marijuana use and related\nproblems among adolescents. This research represents only a\nfirst step in understanding these cultural attitudes, and future\ninvestigation is needed to examine other factors related to\nadolescent marijuana use and treatment. A joint understand-\ning of the larger cultural context, coupled with a greater pub-\nlic awareness of effective treatment opportunities may offer\na pathway to improved outcomes for adolescents.\n8 SAGE Open\nAppendix\nSurvey Items and Vignettes.\n1.
