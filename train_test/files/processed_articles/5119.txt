    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvidence suggests that there is usually a long delay between noticing first signs of dementia and\nseeking medical help. We conducted a systematic review of what people experience and how they\nmake decisions during this time, and used a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesise the\nfindings. Screening and quality assessment resulted in nine studies eligible for inclusion. People\nwith dementia mainly report experiencing memory lapses, while carers focus on more subtle\nchanges in personality. People respond to these changes in one of three ways: 1) they discount\nthem as normal; 2) they reserve judgement as to their cause and significance, or 3) they\nmisattribute them. Pivotal events can finally trigger help seeking. Active reflection and seeking\nof further evidence may lead to earlier recognition of the possibility of dementia and the need to\nseek help; it also reduces the risk of a pivotal event. Public education should aim to improve\nrecognition of more subtle signs and to encourage repeated evaluation and reflection.\nCorresponding author:\nLucy Perry-Young, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Innovation Park, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK.\nEmail: lucy.perry-young@nottingham.ac.uk\nDementia\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/dem\n",

Although no cure currently exists for dementia, early diagnosis\ncarries significant personal, social and economic benefits which have the potential to improve\nquality of life for patients and reduce carer burden (Banerjee & Wittenberg, 2009; Getsios,\nBlume, Ishak, Maclaine, & Herna\nIn order for diagnosis to happen, a person, or someone close to them, must first identify a\nproblem, associate that problem with dementia and make a decision to seek medical help.\nAlthough a general public population study indicated that people would seek help if they\nnoticed memory problems in themselves or someone else (Dale, Hemmerich, Hill, Hougham,\n& Sachs, 2008), other studies, which are based on real as opposed to hypothetical situations,\nsuggest a markedly different picture. For example, studies of real dementia trajectories\nreported averages of between 8 and 52 months from first signs to first medical\nconsultation (Boise, Morgan, Kaye, & Camicioli, 1999; Bond et al., 2005; Chrisp,\nIt is likely that these numbers are an underestimate of the actual length of delay because\nparticipants in all of the studies had eventually sought a diagnosis.\nSeveral possible explanations have been offered for this delay. Firstly, the symptoms of\ndementia can be difficult to recognise. In a survey of older people meeting criteria for\ndementia, Eustace et al. (2007) found that 29% of primary informants failed to recognise\nchanges in their loved one's memory. The attribution of memory problems to normal aging\nClark et al., 2005). Other recognised reasons for delay are: difficulty discussing symptoms\nwith the person with dementia (Clark et al., 2005); difficulty accepting dementia (Boise et al.,\n1999; Clark et al., 2005); the person with dementia being angry or refusing to see a doctor\n(Clark et al., 2005); desire to protect the autonomy of the person with dementia (Boise et al.,\n1999); family disagreements about the problem and the course of action (Boise et al., 1999);\nand difficulty talking with the doctor about mental health issues (Boise et al., 1999).\nThese reasons for delay in help seeking are echoed by the findings of studies into help\nseeking for mental health. This literature suggests that the most common reasons for delay in\nhelp seeking are: stigma and embarrassment (Gulliver, Griffiths, & Christensen, 2010;\nMeltzer et al., 2000), difficulty recognising symptoms (Clausen & Yarrow, 1955; Gulliver\net al., 2010), self-reliance and/or preference for lay help (Oliver, Pearson, Coe, & Gunnell,\n2005; Rickwood, Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005), lack of ability to express emotions\nproblems are not a legitimate illness (Pill, Prior, & Wood, 2001; Prior, Wood, Lewis, & Pill,\nthe fear of consequences of seeking help (Dew et al., 2007; Owens et al., 2011).\nThe wider help-seeking literature has shown that people respond to the signs of illness in\ndiverse and often unexpected ways. While it might seem obvious that a person seeks help\nPerry-Young et al. 35\nwhen he/she is `sick', what constitutes sickness and what is considered to be appropriate\naction in response to sickness varies widely between individuals and groups (Zola, 1973).\nZola (1973) challenges three major and common assumptions about the reasons individuals\nseek a medical consultation. The first assumption is that most people at most times in their\nlives are asymptomatic. We know however from studies in which family health diaries were\nkept (e.g. Robinson (1971)), that `we may to some degree be sick every day of our lives'\n(Zola, 1973, p. 678). The second assumption is that the more serious or frequent the\nsymptoms, the more likely people are to seek help. Zola challenges this assumption by\nhighlighting the evidence that, for serious physical or mental disorder, there is often at\nleast one person out of treatment for every person in treatment. The third assumption is\nthat a rational individual experiencing symptoms would, after a time, seek a medical\nconsultation. Here Zola highlights the studies of delay in seeking help for cancer.\nOthers have demonstrated that most people rely heavily on personal social networks as a\nfirst `port of call' in seeking help, noting that many illness episodes are recognised and\nmanaged within these networks without professional help (Cornford & Cornford, 1999;\nstudies, several `dynamic' models, which acknowledge the role of social networks, have\nbeen proposed to describe the ways in which individuals make decisions about whether or\nnot to seek professional help (Biddle, Donovan, Sharp, & Gunnell, 2007; Dingwall, 1976;\nAdamson, Dixon, & Hunt, 2013). These dynamic models highlight that changes are\ninterpreted in light of knowledge gained through interactions over time (Wyke et al., 2013),\nthat changes are observed, attributions made about their cause, and their social significance is\ndetermined (Saint Arnault, 2009), and that the threshold for defining the need for help may be\nmovable (Biddle et al., 2007). Despite the wealth of insight these models provide, they do not\nfully account for situations in which family and social network members play a more active\nrole in recognising that something is wrong and seeking help on behalf of another person.\nThese situations may be particularly common in some mental health conditions, including\ndementia, where illness is characterised by a lack of awareness.\nFurther exploration is needed to understand how people come to recognise a problem and\nseek professional help for individuals showing early signs of dementia. There has been no\nattempt to systematically review and synthesise the qualitative literature on the help-seeking\nbehaviours of people with dementia and members of their family and social networks.\nAim and research question\nThe aim of this review was to systematically search, critically appraise and present a\nsynthesis of the literature on the social dynamics of help seeking for dementia. The\nspecific research question was: How do people experience and interpret early signs of\ndementia and make decisions about whether and when to seek medical help?\nMethods\nWe used systematic reviewing techniques to search for, and appraise the quality of all\nqualitative studies that were relevant to the research question. After data were extracted,\nthe findings of these papers were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic method (Noblit &\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy (Appendix) was built up using the Ovid platform and was amended\nwhere necessary to work in other databases. The following databases were searched from\ntheir inception up to May 2015: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, HMIC, British\nNursing Index, Social Care Online and ASSIA. This produced 3650 hits. After removal of\nduplicates, two reviewers (LP-Y and GO) independently screened titles and abstracts to\nassess eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewers met to\ncompare findings and resolve any discrepancies. Full texts were obtained and screened\nagain by both reviewers. The two reviewers met again and resolved discrepancies without\nneeding to consult a third reviewer. Key journals were hand searched, as well as reference\nlists of key papers.\nBox 1 lists the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nQuality assessment\nAlthough the practice of appraising the quality of qualitative research for use in reviews and\nsyntheses is often debated (Campbell et al., 2011; Hammersley, 2002; Popay, Rogers, &\nWilliams, 1998), our initial readings indicated that some of the papers were of\nquestionable rigour and so we decided that quality appraisal was necessary. Two\nreviewers (LP and GO) independently assessed the 16 studies using the Critical Appraisal\nSkills Programme (CASP) assessment tool for qualitative research (CASP, 2013). A further\neight papers were excluded because of issues with rigour and, in some cases, because only a\nvery small section of the paper was relevant to the pre-diagnosis period (for example, Brown\nillustrates how the final selection of papers was made.\nData extraction\nA data extraction form was used to extract the main concepts, sub-concepts and participant\nquotes from each paper; this forms the data for the synthesis.\nTable 1 describes the basic study information of each paper.\nBox 1.

We\ndecided to include the six-stage model because it was based on a much greater amount of data.\nPerry-Young et al. 41\nIn a meta-ethnography, each study is reduced to its key concepts, and the concepts of each\nstudy are translated into one another in an effort to establish similarities and differences\nbetween them. According to Noblit and Hare, ``The translation of studies takes the form of\nan analogy between and/or among the studies.'' (1988, p. 10). The meta-ethnographer\n`translates' by taking each key concept from the first paper, comparing it closely with\nsimilar concepts in the second and subsequent papers, and drawing analogies of the type\n`X is like Y except for Z'.\nNoblit and Hare describe three ways in which studies are related to one another:\n. The accounts are directly comparable and their translations do not reveal opposition,\ntherefore they are `reciprocal' translations.\n. The accounts stand in opposition; these are `refutational' translations.\n. The studies taken together represent a `line of argument'.\nBritten et al. (2002) describe three levels of thinking that are brought together in a meta-\nethnography: `first-order' concepts or interpretations of the phenomenon being studied\n(those of the primary research participants, represented by original quotations); `second-\norder' concepts or interpretations (those of the primary researchers); and `third-order'\nconcepts or interpretations (those of the reviewers or secondary researchers). First and\nsecond order concepts are extracted from each of the primary studies. Third-order\nconcepts are developed during the synthesis stage.\nFollowing data extraction, we populated a table with the second-order concepts from\neach paper, in order to assess the degree of reciprocity between them. After juxtaposing\nthem in this way, we then translated the concepts of the papers into one another. We\nstarted by comparing just two of the studies. Once these two studies' concepts had been\nclosely compared, the list of translations that was produced was compared with the next\nstudy's concepts. This process continued until all the papers had been translated into\none another. The resulting list of concepts was then taken back to the original studies\nin a fashion not dissimilar to the constant comparison method used in Grounded\nTheory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). This enabled us to make inferences about what the\nstudies told us when taken together as a whole and thus develop a line-of-argument\nsynthesis.\nFindings\nThe views of 249 participants were represented, including 32 people with dementia and 217\ncarers (171 spouses, 39 children, six sons- or daughters-in-law and one sibling). Of the carers,\nthe majority were female (60%), while the majority of people with dementia were male\n(59%). Three of the studies were conducted in Canada, two in the USA, two in the UK,\none in the Netherlands and one in Sweden. All the studies employed unstructured or semi-\nstructured interviews but different approaches and methods of analysis were described (see\nThe main concepts were ordered under three groups: changes experienced, delaying\nfactors and advancing factors. Figure 2 shows which papers contributed to each concept.\nWhere quotes are included, speech marks denote study participants' words (i.e. first-order\ninterpretations) and inverted commas denote primary researchers' words (second-order\ninterpretations).\n(i) Changes experienced\nThis concept was evident in all of the papers, though the authors used different words for it,\nsuch as changes in the family member and disrupted family life (Van Vliet et al., 2011),\nawareness of early signs (Leung et al., 2011) and first signs and contrary behaviour (Krull,\n2005). The majority of papers spoke about changes in terms of both what was experienced\n(changes in the family member) and how it was experienced (contextual factors).\nChanges in the family member. Changes in the family member included memory and cognitive\nchanges, such as becoming more forgetful, not being able to find the right word and a\ngeneral loss of ability to perform usual tasks. There were also instances of changes in\nbehaviour, personality and relationships. Leung et al. (2011) reported that, in people with\ndementia, ``behaviours became increasingly inconsistent with how they `used to be'.'' Other\nparticipants noted a general loss of interest in things and a change in the relationship\nbetween the person with dementia and carer:\n``The behaviour of my husband changed. He just did not respond when I needed help or when I\nneeded an arm around my shoulder.'' (Van Vliet et al., 2011)\nSometimes this change in the relationship was more dramatic:\n``I just got me a bite to eat . . . I was sitting there and he came and he said, ``are you sleeping?''\nAnd I started to say, ``no,'' and he said, ``Well, this will wake you up. In the morning, I'm calling\na lawyer, I want a divorce!''

Summary of findings showing contributions of each paper to concepts.\nPerry-Young et al. 43\nKoehn et al. (2012) and Van Vliet et al. (2011) both noted that only carers mentioned the\npersonality and relationship changes. Studies that interviewed both people with dementia\nand carers found that only carers noticed personality and relationship changes; those that\ninterviewed only carers mostly1 reported both memory changes and personality/relationship\nchanges, and the one study that interviewed only people with dementia only reported\nmemory changes. The types of change reported by people with dementia and carers in\neach study are shown in Table 2.\nContextual factors. Most of the papers discussed the contextual factors that influenced how the\nchanges were experienced. Some highlighted the social manifestations of the changes, such as\ntheir impact on work and family life (Brown & Alligood, 2004; Krull, 2005; Leung et al.,\n2011; Van Vliet et al., 2011), while others commented on the variable rates of decline (Koehn\net al., 2012; Leung et al., 2011). Social manifestations included family and marital conflict\nand tensions in the work place:\n``It was a terrible period in which you would rather stay away from home because of the tension\nmy husband brought. He was very nasty to the children.'' (Van Vliet et al., 2011)\n``She experienced a lot of grief; she did not understand anything about all the accusations she got\nat work. They accused her of neglecting things at work and I had to go out of my way to comfort\nFour papers noted that the realisation that the events or behaviours were deviant or\nindicative of dementia occurred in retrospect. Keady (1999) adds to this concept the idea\nof noticing as an active process rather than a single moment in time.\n(ii) Delaying factors\nDelaying factors contained four distinct sub-concepts:\n. Discounting, misattributing and deferring;\n. Interpersonal issues;\n. Delays due to different cultural expectations;\n. Delays due to services.\nDiscounting, misattributing and deferring. With the exception of Brown and Alligood (2004),\nall papers made at least some reference to the discounting and misattribution of\nsymptoms. A behaviour can be discounted by being regarded as normal for that person\n(consistent with their usual self), normal compared with other people, or part of normal\nageing:\nNormal for the person: ``My wife always was a forgetful person, so these problems were not\nobvious for me.'' (Van Vliet et al., 2011)\nNormal compared with others: ``We all forget things'' (Leung et al., 2011)\nNormal aging: ``I knew something was not right. I thought well, it's just her age'' (Krull, 2005)\nTable 2. Types of changes reported by the person with dementia and carers.\nRobinson et al.

(Mukadam, Cooper, Basit, & Livingston, 2011)\n``Our mother died last year and we all put it down to him being sad and depressed about it all''.\nIn one paper, Van Vliet et al. (2011), the authors include `noticing a problem but not\nattributing to anything' as a misattribution. We consider, however, that noticing a\nproblem but not attributing it to anything is neither discounting nor misattributing, as the\nfollowing quote demonstrates:\n``If your wife always has been active, but stops doing that all of a sudden, you think: `what is\ngoing on?' However, I never knew what to make of it; I was never able to label this behaviour. I\nonly thought it was very annoying.'' (Van Vliet et al., 2011)\nMcCleary et al. (2013) also talk about carers' ambivalence about what the cause of the changes\nmight be. We would interpret both this ambivalence and `noticing a problem but not attributing\nto anything' (Van Vliet et al., 2011) as `deferring'; a decision about the cause of the event is\nsimply deferred or put to one side until the person is better able to make sense of and evaluate it.\nWe make the distinction then between when the person thinks the behaviour or event is normal\n(discounting), when they think it is due to another cause (misattributing), or when they are\nunsure what the cause is and thus reserve judgement for the time being (deferring).\nInterpersonal factors. Only four of the papers contributed to this concept (Brown & Alligood,\ndenial was reported, either on the part of the person with dementia (Keady, 1999; Mukadam\net al., 2011; Van Vliet et al., 2011), who denied the problem or tried to hide the signs, or on\nthe part of the carer (Brown & Alligood, 2004), who minimised the problems as a means of\ncoping. Denial of a problem, on part of the person with dementia or a family member, makes\ncommunication about the changes difficult.\nCarer: ``And I kept telling myself, ``Well, it's not Alzheimer's. They don't know what they're\ntalking about because this man is perfectly normal!'' When all the time I, I knew, but just did not\nwant to accept it.'' (Brown & Alligood, 2004)\nIt is not clear in either case whether the act of minimising or denying was intentional. It is\nparticularly unclear in the case of the person with dementia because lack of awareness is a\nmanifestation of the illness.\nWhen people with dementia cover up the signs that something is wrong, carers can gain\nlittle understanding and confirmation from their social network members, who may not\nnotice the `covered-up' problems (Van Vliet et al., 2011):\n``That period was very tiring for me because I could not convince anyone that something was\nwrong. My husband . . ., knew very well how to manage in specific situations, so nobody noticed\nanything. He could really fool people.'' (Van Vliet et al., 2011)\nThus, when the person with dementia denies changes and hides the signs, this can cause\ninterpersonal strains between them and the caregiver and delay help-seeking. This can lead\nto a moral dilemma for the carer, who may have noticed a problem but is reluctant to seek\nhelp because they feel they would be betraying the person with dementia or breaching their\n``He [carer] didn't want to say anything because he was too frightened in case he lost her [the\nperson with dementia's] trust.'' (Mukadam et al., 2011)\nThis moral dilemma can be heightened by respect for the family hierarchy, and a feeling of a\nfamily duty to care. The carer may also wish to protect the person with dementia, particularly\nwhen they have concerns about the stigma of mental illness (Mukadam et al., 2011).\nDelays due to different cultural or religious expectations. Four of the studies made contributions to\net al., 2012; Krull, 2005) are directly and reciprocally translatable, except that they apply to\ntwo different cultures: American and Chinese. The argument put forward in both papers is\nthat there is a cultural or religious expectation that forgetfulness is a normal sign of aging.\nGiven that the majority of the other papers also make reference to participants' beliefs that\nthe changes they were experiencing were a normal part of aging, it could be assumed that this\nis a much wider cultural phenomenon, and not specific to these two cultures.\nAnother study to contribute to this concept, Mukadam et al. (2011), gives an example\nfrom an Asian culture, where there was an expectation that, when a son marries, his wife\ntakes over the household tasks and so the parent's loss of ability to perform those tasks may\nbe less noticeable. McCleary et al. (2013) describe how one of their participants viewed the\nchanges as natural in connection with a Hindu deity, Lord Shiva:\n``I think, well first of all this is natural. You can't help too much. This is, everything is, on a decline...\nthis Law of Shiva is working. Everything is deteriorating, getting back to the recycle process.''\nDelays due to services. In Koehn et al.'s (2012) study, new immigrant caregivers faced\nparticular difficulties in accessing resources:\n``I did not know [about support services] because although I was here for nearly three years, I\nwas at home [caring for my child and mother]. I don't know many people here. I did not come\nacross these social services and their information before . . . Moreover, I do not know what type\nof social services are available to these patients in Canada.''\nIn some cases, a high level of trust in the services resulted in delayed help seeking, as it was\nexpected that the doctor would pick up on the changes:\n``No the doctor they keep seeing him they don't tell me anything . . . I rely on the GP.''\nIn other cases the opposite was true, and the carer delayed seeking help because of a lack of\ntrust in the GP or in psychiatry services (Mukadam et al., 2011).\n(iii) Advancing factors\nMukadam et al. (2011) term this concept `factors precipitating help seeking'. The term was\nchanged to `advancing factors' as this encompasses more concepts that refer to factors which\nPerry-Young et al. 47\nfacilitate acknowledging, discussing and observing as well as seeking medical help, and thus\nadvancing progress along the trajectory towards diagnosis. This main concept has the\nfollowing sub-concepts:\n. Active reflection and seeking further evidence;\n. Exposure to information and past experience;\n. Pivotal event.\nActive reflection and seeking further evidence. Some participants described processes of active\nreflection and the seeking of further evidence. For some carers this meant `increased\nsurveillance' of the person with dementia and `checking out' with family members (Keady,\n1999). In some cases, information was actively sought from family and social network\nmembers (Keady, 1999; Robinson, Ekman, Meleis, Winblad, & Wahlund, 1997), while in\nother cases the network members were forthcoming with their observations (Brown &\nAlligood, 2004; Krull, 2005). In either case, the observations of others were compared with\nthe participant's own observations and were used as a basis for re-assessment of the situation:\n``His brother also talks to me and then sometimes when he says something I took it lightly. He\nsays `No. No. There's nothing to take, it's not a laughing matter. We have to look into it. It can\nbe serious. He needs some treatment, attention.' So I told him, `Let's go to the doctor and see.'''\nThe accumulation of events also prompted comparison and reflection and led to a process of\n`gradually piecing together' (Brown & Alligood, 2004; Koehn et al., 2012; Leung et al.,\n2011). This process of active reflection and seeking of further evidence leads to the\nredefinition of the situation. The new definition of the situation can then be used as a\nbenchmark against which to measure further events, or it may be sufficient in itself for the\nparticipant to want to seek medical help.\nThe people with dementia in the study by Robinson et al. (1997) described a similar\nprocess of active reflection. They reported a gradual awareness that the changes they\nexperienced were no longer random or isolated experiences in their lives, so that they\nwere no longer able to normalise them.\n``I had been shopping and forgot my groceries in the store . . . I didn't even realize as I came home\nor when I got to the car, and then I actually started wondering about myself''\nExposure to information and past experience. Of the four papers that contribute to this concept,\nthree mentioned recognition of dementia on the basis of previous family experience of the\nthe idea of increased recognition of dementia on the basis of professional knowledge of the\ndisease, or exposure to information about it (Koehn et al., 2012). When engaged in active\nreflection, the participant can draw upon, and make comparisons with, their knowledge stock\nand their experiences of other people's dementia. Again, this can contribute to a redefinition\nof the situation and advancement along the trajectory to diagnosis.\nPivotal event. At times, the period of active reflection and seeking further evidence was\ncut short due to a pivotal event that caused dramatic recognition of the need to seek\nmedical help. Most commonly this took the form of a crisis or potentially dangerous event\nthat caused participants to recognise that the situation was more serious than they thought\n2013). Examples included traffic accidents, getting lost and burning saucepans. In other\ncases, the pivotal event consisted in participants being told by their doctor that they had\ndementia when they had consulted the doctor about another problem (Koehn et al., 2012;\nMukadam et al., 2011). A unique example of a pivotal event is described by Leung et al.\n(2011), where a person with dementia spontaneously disclosed their memory problems while\nvisiting the doctor for another reason:\n``It was a flip comment when I was walking out of the doctor's office . . . I said, `Oh by the way\ncan you do anything for memory loss?'''\nIn this latter example, the snap judgement of the participant to disclose their concerns to the\ndoctor was pivotal in the advancement of the trajectory towards a diagnosis.\nDiscussion\nLine of argument synthesis\nTable 3 shows the key concepts from the papers, the primary authors' second-order\ninterpretations and our third-order interpretations.\nBy translating the concepts and synthesising these translations we are able to propose the\nfollowing line of argument. The early signs of dementia are experienced not only as changes\nin memory and cognitive functioning, but also as changes in personality and strains in\ninterpersonal relationships within family and work contexts. It seems that people in the\nearly stages of dementia tend to be more aware of the memory and cognitive changes and\nnot the changes in their personality and relationships. This contributes to the moral\ndilemma faced by family members, who may have noticed changes but, due to lack of\nawareness or denial on the part of the person with dementia, may feel unable to do\nanything about it through fear of upsetting or betraying the person. Noticing occurs as a\nprocess, in which new events are evaluated in relation to the stock of knowledge the\nindividual holds, which is influenced by their level of medical understanding and past\nexperiences.\nWhen an event occurs, individuals respond by either generating a hypothesis about the\ncause of the problem, or simply deferring judgement about the cause of the event until a later\ndate. When hypotheses are generated, they contribute to the stock of knowledge held by the\nindividual that is used to interpret future events; past events help to shape the evaluation of\nthe current event and, at the same time, past events are re-evaluated in light of new events.\nFreeman's (2010) work on narrative reflection has relevance here; Freeman states that `self-\nunderstanding occurs in significant part through narrative reflection, which is itself a product\nof hindsight'. He asserts that through hindsight and narrative reflection, things can be seen\nthat could not have been seen at the time the event occurred.\nThe accumulation of events causes suspicion and individuals begin to actively monitor the\nsituation, gather information from others, and compare and reflect. Pivotal events can occur\nwhich cause a rapid advancement along the trajectory towards a diagnosis, either through\nsudden recognition of a problem, sudden recognition of dementia, or sudden recognition of\nthe need to seek medical help. These pivotal events are usually crises that give rise to safety\nconcerns or great tensions in relationships.\nPerry-Young et al. 49\nTable 3.

As new\n(continued)\nPerry-Young et al. 51\nThe following metaphor helps to express this line of argument. Consider each unusual\nevent as an object that a person comes across and needs to deal with. They must make an\nassumption about what the object is and `file' it accordingly in a cupboard. They might\nassume that this unusual event is normal behaviour, or the result of another health problem.\nIf the person is unsure about what the object is (what the event means), they might file it\nprovisionally before looking for similar objects to confirm or disprove their suspicions\n(surveillance and seeking the opinions of others). If a person is not ready to make a\njudgement about what the object is or cannot face thinking about it at that time, they\nmay just throw it in the cupboard without worrying about where it lands, and close the\ndoor. In this case no assumptions have been made about the object but it is still accessible in\nthe cupboard. As the individual comes across further objects, the same process is followed,\nTable 3.

This is usually\na crisis or safety concern.\n- Dementia recognised\nwhen seeking help for\nanother problem\n- Carer's patience finally\nsnaps and they confront\nthe person with dementia\nA pivotal event causes the\nrecognition of a need to\nseek medical help, or at\nleast a sudden\nadvancement along the\ntrajectory to diagnosis At\nthe time of this\nrecognition the person\nmay not have hypothesised\ndementia, or they may\nhave hypothesised it some\ntime ago\naKoehn et al. introduced this concept but the other papers are in support of it when taken together \u00ad see Table 2.\nbut this time there is a further option: to look at the objects already in the cupboard,\ncompare them with the new object and use them to decide where to place it. In this way,\nas the person views what is already in the cupboard, they might also decide to reorganise the\ncontents according to new assumptions. If objects in the cupboard are allowed to simply\naccumulate without the person ever taking stock of where the objects relate to each other,\nthere is a risk of the cupboard reaching full capacity and bursting open. This represents a\npivotal event, where stress and strain may have been mounting for some time and the door\nbursts open and the contents (and their underlying meanings) are clear to see.\nThese findings appear to support much of the evidence from the help-seeking literature.\nAs the literature suggests, the experiences of individuals that are represented and interpreted\nwithin these nine studies show that help seeking is a complex process of recognising changes\nand making sense of them within the individuals' existing spheres of knowledge. This review\nalso demonstrates a clear reliance on lay networks in making attributions about the cause of\nchanges, as is described by Cornford and Cornford (1999), Freidson (1970) and Kleinman\naccount for the influence of social networks on decision making, they do not specifically\naccount for those situations in which a family member or friend has to interpret the changes\nand act on behalf of the ill person. In a study about the role of family members and friends in\nrecognising and responding to mental distress, Owens et al. (2011) draw attention to the\nmoral dilemma faced by those who must act on behalf of a significant other. They may\nrecognise the need both to alert other members of the social network and to seek\nprofessional help, but fear that doing so would constitute betrayal and might damage\ntheir relationship with the distressed person, thus cutting off a vital source of social\nsupport. This review reports similar experiences reported by family members, who felt\nthat discussing changes with others and seeking professional help would breach the trust\nof the person living with dementia.\nLimitations of existing literature and implications for further research\nAlthough this synthesis provides a strong line of argument about the ways in which people\nweigh up the meaning of individual experiences, several concepts (delays due to people with\ndementia, delays due to families and delays due to cultural expectations) suggest that there is\na strong interpersonal dimension to the way in which people make help-seeking decisions.\nWhile we have been able to account for these concepts and create third-order interpretations\nabout them, information in the individual studies about these issues was sparse and\nunderdeveloped. Thus the line of argument that emerges from existing studies does not\nsufficiently reflect the whole experience of recognising and responding to the signs of dementia.\nFurther work is needed to draw out some of the complexities involved in the interpersonal\naspects of decision making, including the effects of familial and cultural practices and the\nmoral dilemmas faced by family members who are worried about upsetting or betraying the\nperson with dementia. The review has highlighted that looking back on events through\nhindsight, and weighing and corroborating them, enables people to make sense of\nindividual experiences in the light of previous experiences. Family members may be\nconcerned that engaging in such reflective practices, including actively gathering evidence\nand weighing it up, may be a serious breach of the person's autonomy and thus risks\nupsetting or alienating them.\nPerry-Young et al. 53\nFuture work might also address the following areas:\n. Which signs and symptoms people with dementia can and cannot become aware of, and\nhow this affects communication with and between family members?\n. How commonly people notice personality changes and tensions in relationships and what\nthey attribute these to?\n. How people utilise their lay referral networks, including which network members they\nseek advice from?\n. The moral dilemmas faced by family members about upsetting or betraying the person\nthey are concerned about.\nImplications for practice\nA number of implications for practice also arise from the findings of this review, mainly in\nthe area of public health. Current public health messages about early signs of dementia focus\nheavily on memory changes and loss of cognitive abilities. This review highlights other\nimportant early signs, such as behavioural and personality changes, and the social\nmanifestations of dementia in familial and work relationships. More recent research has\ndrawn attention to changes in sense of humour (Clark et al., 2015). Increasing public\nawareness of these more subtle and diverse changes might enable people to make earlier\nand more accurate hypotheses about problems they are experiencing and their possible\ncauses. A development of the metaphor we described could encourage people to sort the\nobjects as they are placed in the `cupboard', instead of just throwing them in, and to review\nthe contents regularly.\nAs the findings have shown, experiences are often allowed to accumulate before a person\ndecides to review and evaluate them in light of each other. A public health message could\nencourage people to weigh up and compare their experiences both with those of other people\nand with their own experiences from previous years. This reflection allows individuals to\nconsistently evaluate problems and make and test hypotheses. The trajectory toward a\ndiagnosis is then more likely to be characterised by a smooth and steady growth of\nrealisation, rather than a relative lack of awareness until a pivotal event occurs. For the\nperson with dementia, this could mean that they receive the diagnosis while they still have\nchance to make sense of it and plan for the future, and for some it could also mean the earlier\ncommencement of medications that can potentially slow the decline.\nA final implication for practice stems from the concept of `delays due to services'. Both\nKoehn et al. (2012) and Mukadam et al. (2011) reported instances of delays because doctors\nhad not recognised the signs of dementia, delays because of lack of trust in services, or delays\ndue to lack of knowledge of the system among recent immigrants. This suggests that more\ncould be done to improve clinical decision making and to engage minority groups who may\nface specific barriers to accessing services.\nConclusion\nSystematic searching, screening and appraisal allowed us to identify nine high-quality\nqualitative studies of the ways in which people come to recognise and respond to the early\nsigns of dementia. Data were extracted from each paper and, following a meta-ethnographic\napproach, these were translated into one another to produce key concepts, namely: the\nchanges that were experienced; factors that delayed help seeking, and factors that advanced\nthe help-seeking process. Taken together, the papers present a common line of argument.\nThe argument suggests that events are not experienced in a social and historical vacuum\nand that the recognition of dementia and the need to seek medical help is part of a long\nprocess, rather than a single moment in time. Individuals notice a wider range of signs than\njust memory and cognitive changes; personality changes and general tensions in relationships\nat work and at home are also reported. Active reflection on the meaning of events and\ngathering of further evidence appears to lead to earlier recognition of the need to seek\nmedical help; it also reduces the risk of a pivotal event that could potentially be a crisis\nsituation. This process occurs as a repeating cycle of noticing, attributing, developing\nhypotheses and observing, comparing and reflecting. Familial and cultural factors can\nserve to delay medical help seeking, including fear of upsetting the person with dementia\nand feeling a duty to care for them within the lay network, but further work is needed in this\narea to understand these interpersonal issues and their impact.\nAuthors' note\nThe views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the\nDepartment of Health.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for\nLeadership in Applied Health Research and Care for the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC).\nNote\n1. The exception to this is in Mukadam et al. who only ascribe one sentence to the changes noticed:\n`nearly all the carers reported that the first symptom they noticed was forgetfulness'. Therefore,\nother symptoms may also have been noticed after the forgetfulness, but this is not reported. Because\nonly one sentence is afforded to this, and because the authors say that forgetfulness is the first (not\nnecessarily the only) symptom, this was not considered as a refutation.\nReferences\nAlzheimer's Society.
