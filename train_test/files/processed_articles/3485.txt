In languages such as English,\nthere are quite a few tests available for early assessment and interventions. In India, a multilingual society, all children going\nto school learn to read at least in three languages, including English.

It\nprepares the children for all their educational endeavors and\nis a key to the possibilities that the future has in store for\nthem (Bialystok, Luk, & Kwan, 2005). When beginning to\nreceive formal instruction in reading, a large majority of chil-\ndren show no difficulty in learning how to read and write\nunder normal conditions. However, several millions of chil-\ndren and adults worldwide, despite having average or above\naverage cognitive abilities, adequate educational conditions,\nnormal hearing and vision, have specific impairment in pick-\ning up reading (Schulte-K\u00f6rne et al., 2007). Well-designed\nliteracy assessments help identifying the problem of students\nin literacy development and guiding appropriate instruction\nCommeyras, 2008; National Council of Educational\nIndia is one of the largest functionally multilingual coun-\ntries in the world (Annamalai, 2001). The Report of the\nof India recommended the Three-Language Formula (TLF),\nwhich necessitates all primary schools to teach three lan-\nguages to pupils (Kothari, 1966). The TLF includes mother-\ntongue or the regional language; the official language of the\nUnion or the associate official language so long as it exists;\nand a modern Indian or foreign language not covered above\nand other than that used as a medium of instruction. After the\napproval of the parliament, it was incorporated into the\nNational Policy on Education in 1968, and today almost all\nschools in India expose their students to the learning of three\nlanguages. In the state of Karnataka (where the present study\nwas conducted), majority of the schools teach Kannada,\nEnglish, and Hindi. Kannada, a Dravidian language, is the\nofficial language of Karnataka State and is spoken by about\n50 to 60 million people in India. It is an agglutinative, highly\ninflective language, which follows subject\u00adobject\u00adverb\norder canonically. Kannada orthography is an alphasylla-\nbary, in which orthographic units (called akshara) represent\nsyllables. It is a transparent orthography. As the grain size is\nlarger, it has a larger set of symbols. Furthermore, it has\nhardly a few monosyllabic words, the most common words\nhaving two or three syllables (more details of Kannada may\n1Department of Psychology, University of Mysore, Mysore, India.\n2Genomics Laboratory, Department of Studies in Zoology, University of\nMysore, Mysore, India.\nCorresponding Author:\nPrakash Padakannaya, Department of Psychology, University of Mysore,\nEmail: prakashp@psychology.uni-mysore.ac.in; prakashp99@gmail.com\nCatch Them Before They Fall: A Simple\nTest of Sight-Word and Pseudo-Word\nReading in Kannada for a Quick and Early\nAssessment\nMarita Saldanha1, Anand Siddaiah1, Avinash M. Veerappa2,\nNallur B. Ramachandra2, and Prakash Padakannaya1\n Keywords\nsight-word reading, pseudo-word reading, Kannada, early assessment, primary schoolchildren\n2 SAGE Open\nlanguage used all over India, belongs to the Indo-European\nfamily of languages. Both Kannada and Hindi orthographies\nare derived from a common source, Brahmi (Coulmas,\n1989). English and the Indian writing systems have contrast-\ning features with respect to transparency, grain size, and the\northographic principle (Padakannaya & Mohanty, 2004;\nPadakannaya & Ramachandra, 2011). Furthermore, different\nwriting systems put different cognitive demands on readers,\nwhich are reflected in the way reading and spelling/spelling\nare acquired in those languages (Chengappa, Bhat, &\nPadakannaya, 2004; Padakannaya, Rekha, Vaid, & Joshi,\nGoswami, 2006). In such multilingual settings where chil-\ndren are formally exposed to two or three languages simulta-\nneously, testing needs to be done in all the languages children\nare learning for any assessment or diagnostic purposes.\nThere are several standard tests available for assessing\nreading ability in languages such as English that facilitate\nresearch studies and early assessment of reading skills in nor-\nmal and at-risk children. However, in a multiliterate setting\nlike India, there is dearth for such tools in local languages.\nThere is an urgent need to develop tests in the Indian lan-\nguages, which will help identify children in need for interven-\ntion. This will save them from the vicious circle of the mental\ntrauma they would experience on account of academic diffi-\nculties. Here, we report an attempt at developing a quick and\nreliable measure for assessment of decoding and sight-word\nreading skills of higher primary and high schoolchildren in\nKannada language, one of the major languages of India, in the\nlines of Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) in\nEnglish (Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999). The TOWRE,\na widely used test in English, assesses sight-word efficiency\nand phonemic decoding efficiency by asking readers to read a\nlist of high frequency words and another list of pseudo-words\nfor 45 s each. The Performance on the first list provides a\nmeasureofone'ssight-wordreading,whereasthePerformance\non the second list provides an index of one's decoding ability.\nThe present article presents a brief account of our attempt at\ndeveloping a similar measure in Kannada with an assumption\nthat development of such measures helps cross-linguistic\ncomparisons in multilingual contexts prevailing in India.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifty (30 boys and 20 girls) students, studying in an English-\nmedium school and taught Kannada and English from the\nfirst-grade level, participated in the study. Their age ranged\nfrom 10 to 18 years. Twenty-six of them were studying at the\nmiddle school level (Grades 5-8), and 24 were from the sec-\nondary to the higher secondary level (Grades 8-12) as per the\nIndian school system.\nTheir inclusion in the study was based on the class teach-\ners' checklist report endorsing that children were average or\nhigher than average performers with consistency in academics\nand did not have any observable physical or psychological/\nbehavioral/emotional problems on record. All of them\nbelonged to middle or high socioeconomic families.\nProcedure\nThe first phase involved preparing a list of words for sight-\nword efficiency (drishti pada in Kannada) and pseudo-words\n(husi pada in Kannada) for phonological decoding efficiency\nsections of the proposed Kannada test. The first author went\nthrough Kannada language textbooks of Grade Levels 1\nthrough 5, made a list of words and frequency of their appear-\ning in the textbooks. These words were arranged according to\ntheir frequency, that is, words of high frequency were placed\nat the beginning of the list, followed by words that were less\nfrequent (the frequency ranged from 1 to 117). Following\nthis, we performed a median split and considered the words\nabove the median for the proposed list for sight-word reading.\nOf this list, we prepared two separate lists A and B of 72\nwords matching for frequency and mixing words of varied\nlengths and syllables in complexity. The mean frequency of\nthe difference was not statistically significant. Both the lists\nwere serially rearranged in the order of increasing frequency\nof words. Furthermore, two experienced primary school\nKannada language teachers ranked the words based on their\nperception of how familiar the words were to schoolchildren.\nThere was a very significant correlation between the raters\n(.95 and .93, respectively, on Lists A and B).\nTwo lists of 62 pseudo-words each were prepared for\nassessing phonological decoding skill. Pseudo-words (husi\npada) were prepared by substituting a phoneme or a syllable\nof a real word by another without violating the orthographic\nrules of Kannada language. The composition and arrangement\nof pseudo-words within the lists were similar to those of sight-\nword (drishti pada) lists, that is, they were arranged in an\nincreasing order of length and syllable/akshara complexity.\nThus, at the end of the first phase, we had two lists (A and B),\neach for assessing sight-word reading skill and pseudo-word\nreading skill. The whole process of preparing the final list of\nwords along with two helpers took about a month's time.\nReliability Measures\nAnew group of 10 students (6 girls and 4 boys) from a higher\nprimary school participated in this part of the study aimed at\nchecking the odd\u00adeven reliability and reliability coefficient\nfor the whole test. Every participant was asked to read the\nlists of words arranged column wise on a sheet of paper, as\nquickly and accurately as possible on saying \"start\" until told\nto stop. They were instructed that they should skip words\nfound difficult and proceed with the subsequent ones. The\nnumber of words correctly read in 45 s, and the total number\nof words read as well as the time taken to read the whole list\nwas noted down. The order of administration of lists was ran-\ndomized to control the order effect. The odd\u00adeven reliability\nSaldanha et al. 3\nand reliability coefficient for the whole test for sight-word\nand pseudo-word lists are presented in Table 1. All the mea-\nsures exhibited a very high degree of reliability and internal\nconsistency.\nThe stability-over-time or test\u00adretest reliability was deter-\nmined by administering these tests to a group of 50 children\nwith a gap of 2 weeks between testing sessions. The obtained\nmean, standard deviations, and correlation coefficient values\nof the pre- and post-test scores are shown in Table 2. The\nmagnitude of the correlation coefficient values was .91 and\nabove, which definitely meet the required criterion of .90 for\nsuch purposes (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). The alternate\nforms, used to assess sight-word and pseudo-word reading,\nwere also found to be highly correlated (see Table 3).\nValidity\nThe lists of sight words and pseudo-words were evaluated\nfor validity. If these tests tap underlying reading skills, the\nreading scores should increase over the grade levels and the\nmean differences between lower and higher grades should be\nstatistically significant.\nA gradual increase in performance over the grade levels\non all word lists was observed (see Figures 1-3). The results\nof the independent-samples t tests confirmed that the mean\ndifferences between lower grades (5 and 6) and higher grades\n(11 and 12) on the total score of formsAand B of sight words\n(drishti pada) and pseudo-words (husi pada) were signifi-\nrespectively.\nConclusion\nTo make important decisions with respect to specific scores,\na reliability of .90 is the bare minimum, and a reliability of\n.95 is considered the desirable standard (Nunnally &\nBernstein, 1994). Most values in the present study reached or\nexceeded the minimum standard of .90. Thus, the reading\nlists constructed (given in the appendix) for assessing sight-\nword reading and pseudo-word reading are reliable tools that\ncould be the resources available in Kannada for assessment\nTable 1.
