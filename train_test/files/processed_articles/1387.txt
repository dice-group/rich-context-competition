At least 30 HPV types infect the genital area, and persistent\ninfection with high-risk HPV types is the strongest risk factor\nfor cervical cancer. High-risk HPV types, including 16, 18, 31,\n33, and 35, are found in up to 93% of cervical cancers world-\nAssessing the extent of genital HPV infection in the US pop-\nulation has been difficult for many reasons. HPV does not grow\nin tissue culture, closely related types cause different diseases\n(e.g., cervical cancer and genital warts), and most infections\nare asymptomatic. No surveillance systems exist, and no large\npopulation-based prevalence surveys have been feasible. Cur-\nrent knowledge of HPV prevalence and risk factors is based\nlargely on measuring viral DNA in genital epithelial cells.

Serologic testing is\na better measure of cumulative exposure, and type-specific se-\nrologic assays have become available in recent years. Corre-\nlations between assays for IgG antibodies to HPV-16 capsids\nand detection of HPV DNA, high-grade cervical neoplasia, and\nnumber of lifetime sex partners indicate that seroassays are\nuseful epidemiologic research tools [8\u00ad10].\nSeroepidemiologic data also are useful for establishing prev-\nalence of infection in the general population and for identifying\ngroups at highest risk for targeting prevention and clinical ser-\nvices. We report here the results of a national seroepidemiologic\nsurvey of HPV-16 infection performed on surplus serum sam-\nples from the second phase of the third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conductedfrom\nMethods\nStudy populations and study design. The NHANES is a series\nof cross-sectional national surveys conducted by the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). These surveys use a complex, stratified, mul-\ntistage, probability cluster design to select a representative sample\nof the US civilian noninstitutionalized population [11].\nNHANES III oversampled children aged !5 years, persons aged 60\nyears, Mexican Americans, and blacks. For this analysis, race/eth-\nnicity was defined by self-report as non-Hispanic white and non-\nHispanic black (referred to as \"white\" and \"black\" in the text), and\nMexican American. Persons who did not identify themselves in these\ncategories were classified as \"other.\" The poverty index was calcu-\nlated by dividing the total family income by the poverty threshold,\nas defined by the US Census [12], with adjustment for family size at\nthe time of the interview. Urban residence was defined as residing in\na county in a metropolitan area; all other counties were defined as\n\"nonurban.\" Limited sexual history questions were asked of ado-\nlescents aged 15\u00ad16 years. A more extensive sexual behavior ques-\ntionnaire was administered to participants aged 17\u00ad59 years.Alcohol,\ncocaine, and marijuana use questions were asked of study subjects\nResponse rates in the NHANES III have been described else-\nwhere [13]. We tested serum samples available from the second\nparticipants, 7218 serum samples were available for HPV testing\nSerologic testing. Serologic testing for HPV-16 was performed\nat the CDC. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by expres-\nsion of an HPV-16 L1 recombinant baculovirus in insect cells, as\ndescribed elsewhere [14, 15]. ELISAs were standardized and per-\nformed as described elsewhere [14]. In brief, purified VLPs were\npooled as a single lot sufficient to complete the entire study and\nwere aliquoted and frozen at 70C until use. Microtiter plates\n(Immulon II; Dynatech Laboratories) were coated overnight with\n0.1 mg/well VLPs. Plates were washed with Tween 20\n(PBST) and were blocked for 1 h with diluent (10 mM Tris plus\nSuperBlock [Pierce]) containing 0.5% Tween 20. Plates were washed\nwith PBST and were incubated with 50 mL of serum (1:20 in diluent\nplus 10% insect cell lysate) per well at 37C for 1 h. Plates were\nagain washed with PBST and were detected by use of alkaline\nphosphatase\u00adconjugated goat anti\u00adhuman IgG antibody (Roche\nMolecular Biochemicals) and alkaline phosphatase substrate\n(Phosphatase; Sigma). Raw absorbance values were detected at 405\nnm in an automated plate reader (Dynex MRX II Revelation).\nEach serum sample was tested in duplicate wells. For a given sam-\nple, if the SD of the absorbance value of either well was 125% of\nthe mean absorbance value of the duplicate wells, testing was\nrepeated.\nFor quality control and evaluation, we used known positive and\nnegative human serum samples (gifts of M. Hagensee, Louisiana\nState University, and H. Strickler, National Cancer Institute [now at\nAlbert Einstein School of Medicine]). Additional negative serum\nsamples were obtained from Egleston Children's Hospital (Atlanta).\nControl serum samples also were used to prepare pools of high-\npositive, low-positive, and negative serum controls. The pooled con-\ntrols were used to monitor day-to-day and plate-to-plate variation.\nResults for individual control serum samples that were run\nthroughout the course of the NHANES III analysis were used in\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the\nELISA cutoff value for discrimination between positive and nega-\ntive samples [14, 16]. Evaluation of ROC plots indicated that a\ncutoff value of 0.64 absorbance resulted in 93% sensitivity and\n98.5% specificity. Type-specific serologic testing for herpes simplex\nvirus (HSV) types 1 and 2 was performed at Emory University by\nimmunodot assays based on purified glycoproteins gG1 and gG2\nby methods described elsewhere [17, 18].\nStatistical analysis. We explored bivariate associations with\nHPV seropositivity and the following demographic, social, sexual,\nand reproductive variables for women and men separately: age,\nmarital status, race/ethnicity, residence, region (Northeast, Mid-\nwest, South, West), education level, poverty index, use of tobacco,\nalcohol, marijuana, or cocaine, early age at first intercourse(defined\nas !18 years), number of sex partners (lifetime and past year), years\nof sexual activity (calculated by subtracting age at first intercourse\nfrom age at study enrollment), and HSV-1 and HSV-2 seropositiv-\nity. In addition, for women we considered the number of live births,\noral contraceptive use, and cervical cancer; for men, we considered\nwhether the man reported ever having sex with other men.\nPrevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total US pop-\nulation and to account for oversampling and nonresponse to the\nhousehold interview and physical examination [19, 20]. Persons miss-\ning HPV test results were significantly younger than those with HPV\nresults; therefore, the weights provided by NCHS were further ad-\njusted by using the weighted proportion of response in each age group\nand then were poststratified by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. These\nadjusted weights were used for the prevalence estimates and for the\nlogistic regression model to identify variables associated with HPV\nseropositivity. The confidence intervals (CIs) for the prevalence es-\ntimates were calculated on the basis of log transformation with the\nSE of the log prevalence calculated by use of the delta method [21].\nThe SEs for the prevalence estimates were obtained by using SU-\nDAAN software [22]. Similarly, approximate SEs of prevalenceratios\nwere calculated by use of the delta method based on the log of the\nprevalence ratio by use of SEs from SUDAAN.\nWe used logistic regression to determine variables that were in-\ndependently associated with HPV-16 antibodies in sexually active\nmen and women separately. Participants whose race/ethnicity cat-\negory was \"other\" were excluded from these analyses because of\nsmall sample sizes. The initial logistic model included all demo-\ngraphic variables with a bivariate Wald x2 statistic P value .05.\nAfter these variables were entered into the model, we used the\nSatterthwaite-adjusted x2 to determine statistical significance at the\nlevel. Variables in the model that were statistically signif-\nicant remained in the model; other variables were omitted if there\nwas no evidence of data-based confounding (130% change in the\nparameter estimate). A step-up logistic regression model was fitted\nwhere pairwise interactions were added to the remaining main ef-\nfects in the logistic model and were considered to be statistically\nsignificant if the Satterthwaite-adjusted x2 .\nResults\nlence was significantly higher in women (17.9%) than in men\n(7.9%), yielding a female:male prevalence ratio of 2.3 (95% CI,\nblacks, and 8.9% among Mexican Americans. With increasing\nage, HPV-16 seroprevalence increased in women to 24.7% at ages\nTable 1.

These variables were further explored\nby logistic regression. No statistically significant differences in\nHPV-16 seropositivity were found for marital status, residence,\nregion, poverty index, tobacco use, number of live births, years\nof sexual activity, or HSV-1 seropositivity.\nIn the logistic model, age, race/ethnicity, marijuana smoking\n(ever), and age at first sexual intercourse were significantly as-\nsociated with HPV-16 seropositivity before adding number of\nlifetime sexual partners into the model. However, after includ-\ning number of lifetime partners in the model, marijuana smok-\ning (ever) and age at first sexual intercourse were no longer\nstatistically significant and were dropped from the model. No\nother variables were statistically significant or important con-\nfounding variables when added to this model.\nNext, we fitted a step-up logistic regression model and added\npairwise interactions to the main effects model. No pairwise in-\nteractions were statistically significant. Because of the limited\ndegrees of freedom in this complex survey setting, age and num-\nber of lifetime partners were treated as continuous variables to\nassess any interactions. The final model appears in table 3.\nIn men, HPV-16 seropositivity was significantlyassociatedwith\nseveral variables (tables 1 and 2), including age, race/ethnicity,\nmarital status, poverty index, residence, age at first intercourse,\nyears of sexual activity, number of lifetime sex partners, number\nof sex partners during the past year, and having sex with a man.\nThese variables were subsequently explored by logisticregression.\nNo statistically significant differences in HPV-16 seropositivity\nwere found for region, education, tobacco use, cocaine use, al-\ncohol use, ever having sex, or HSV-1 or -2 seropositivity. In the\nlogistic model, we recoded age as a dichotomous variable (!30\nyears vs. 30 years), since the log odds estimates were similar\nographic variables that remained statistically significant in the\nlogistic model were age, residence, and race/ethnicity. The other\ndemographic variables did not appear to be important confound-\ning variables and hence were omitted from the model. Next,\nsexual variables with statistically significantbivariateassociations\nwere added. Only age at first sexual intercourse, years of sexual\nactivity, and having sex with men remained statistically signifi-\ncant. No other variables appeared to be confounders. Although\nage was no longer statistically significant, it was retained in the\nfinal model since it appeared to be confounded with years of\nsexual activity. Next, a step-up logistic regression model wasfitted\nwhere pairwise interactions were added to the main effectsmodel.\nOne interaction, race/ethnicity and residence, was statisticallysig-\nnificant. The final logistic model appears in table 4.\nDiscussion\nThese findings document the high levels of HPV-16 infection\nin the United States, especially in women. In each racial/ethnic\ngroup, seropositivity was at least 2 times higher in women than\nin men, and seropositivity was high even in women who re-\nported only 1 sex partner over their lifetime. Differences in\nseropositivity between men and women were not unexpected,\nsince anatomic and other biologic differences usually portend\ngreater susceptibility to most sexually transmitted diseases for\nwomen than for men. For example, higher transmission risk\nfrom men to women for gonorrhea and HSV-2 [23\u00ad27] and\nhigher population-based prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia,\nand HSV-2 seropositivity in women are well documented [17,\n28]. However, the most likely explanation for higher HPV-16\nseropositivity in women is that women and men have funda-\nmental differences in immune response after exposure [29\u00ad33].\nand higher mean ELISA values for women than for men.

Anorectal mucosal exposure may be more likely to\nproduce a detectable immune response and could contribute to\nthe high seropositivity in men who had sex with men.\nWe found associations between HPV-16 seropositivity and\nsexual behavior in women and men, and age in women. Al-\nthough HPV DNA detection is strongly age-dependent in\nwomen [2, 36, 37], seroprevalence studies in men and women\nhave not shown consistent associations with age [8, 32\u00ad34,\n38\u00ad41] and, in general, have not shown the expected linear\nassociations that are consistently seen for HSV-2 infection [42].\nThe strong association between HPV-16 seropositivity and\nnumber of lifetime sex partners and no association with number\nof recent partners observed in our study have been reported\nmeasure of lifetime rather than of recent exposure.\nSeropositivity in persons who reported no sex partners may\nbe explained by underreporting of sexual behavior [43, 44],\nvertical or other nonsexual transmission, including oral and\nnongenital infection [45\u00ad48], or false-positive serologic tests.\nUnderreporting of sexual activity is likely, especially since the\nquestionnaire did not define sexual intercourse. Oral-genital\nand manual-genital contact could transmit HPV infection yet\nmight not be reported as sexual intercourse [43, 44, 49]. Low\nlevels of HPV-16 seropositivity have been observed in those\nwho have not had intercourse and children in previous studies\nthat used similar serologic assays [50, 51].\nThe HPV-16 seroprevalence observed in our study probably\nunderestimates the cumulative prevalence of HPV-16 infection\nin the United States for several reasons. First, not all persons\nwho become infected with HPV-16 develop a serologicresponse.\nPrevious studies in women showed that !60% of those with\nnewly detectable HPV-16 DNA develop HPV-16 antibodies\n[52], with a median lag time to seroconversion of 11.8 months.\nSecond, duration of seropositivity is not well defined. A study\nof 11 women showed that levels of antibodies to HPV-16 per-\nsisted for the 7\u00ad13-year follow-up period [53]. Another study\nof 1656 pregnant women showed that antibody levels were sta-\nble during a 4-year follow-up period [54]. Whether persistence\nof antibodies differs across demographic groups has not been\nstudied. We are not aware of any published data on persistence\nof antibodies in men.\nOur findings have important public health implications for the\ndevelopment of cervical cancer prevention and control strategies.\nNational HPV seroprevalence data will be valuable for HPV\nvaccine research and for development of HPV vaccine programs.\nProphylactic vaccines for HPV-16 based on L1 virus-likeparticles\nshow great promise, and vaccine development is well underway.\nTopics under debate include whether to vaccinate women only\nor perhaps men only, the ideal age at vaccination, and which\ntypes of HPV to include in a vaccine [55, 56]. Our national data\non seroepidemiology of naturally occurring HPV-16 infection is\nuseful to establish baseline HPV-16 seroprevalence in demo-\ngraphic groups, to highlight differences in humoral immune re-\nsponses between men and women, and to document a high bur-\nden of infection with this single HPV type. Moreover, a system\nfor monitoring seroprevalence over time will be valuable to assess\neffectiveness of vaccine programs.\n"
