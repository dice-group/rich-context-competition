The implications of these developments for optimal conduct of monetary\npolicy are analyzed in a standard open economy model which is augmented to allow\nfor endogenous portfolio choice. The model shows that monetary policy takes on new\nimportance due to its impact on nominal asset returns. Nevertheless, the case for price\nstability as an optimal monetary rule remains.

A drawback of many of these papers is that international financial markets are\nmodelled either by the absence of any type of international risk- sharing or by full risk-sharing. In\nreality, international financial markets seem to be somewhere in the middle.

In a\nfirst case trade in bonds and equities is possible and full international risk-sharing is achieved, for any\nmonetary policy. In this case the portfolio composition of bonds and equities is independent of\nmonetary policy. Then price stability is an optimal policy for conventional reasons, since it eliminates\nthe welfare losses coming from slow price adjustments. On the other hand, when asset trade is\nrestricted to a real non-contingent bond, deviating from price stability is in general desirable in order\nto alleviate risk- sharing inefficiencies. But in the intermediate and more realistic case, with trade in\nnominal bonds, monetary policy affects the composition of portfolios. Monetary policy plays a dual\nrole. First it can be used so as to support the flexible price equilibrium of the economy. But monetary\npolicy can also enhance the degree of international risk- sharing itself, by improving the hedging\nproperties of nominal bonds. This second property of policy is conceptually independent of the first; it\nremains useful even in a flexible price economy. We find that in an environment where nominal bonds\nare traded, a policy of strict price stability will endogenously generate full international risk-sharing.\nStrict price stability is desirable on two counts. It supports the flexible price outcome, and it also\nallows nominal bond returns to offer full risk-sharing against country specific productivity shocks.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDie wachsende Bedeutung und Komplexit\u00e4t der internationalen Finanzm\u00e4rkte ist eines der\nhervorstechendsten Merkmale in der Weltwirtschaft der letzten Jahre. Wirtschaftspolitiker und\nWirtschaftswissenschaftler haben dar\u00fcber spekuliert, welche Folgen diese Entwicklung f\u00fcr die\nAusgestaltung einer optimalen Geldpolitik hat. Die meisten Zentralbanken folgen heute einer Politik,\nbei der ein Ziel f\u00fcr die Inflation verfolgt wird. Dabei ist Preisstabilit\u00e4t, angemessen definiert, das\nzentrale Ziel der Geldpolitik. Muss diese Schlussfolgerung ge\u00e4ndert werden, wenn wir bedenken dass\nInl\u00e4nder in gro\u00dfem Umfang ausl\u00e4ndische Finanzaktiva halten, wobei Ver\u00e4nderungen in deren Preise\nund in den Wechselkursen wesentliche Verm\u00f6gensverteilungseffekte haben?\nIn einer geschlossenen Volkswirtschaft beseitigt eine geldpolitische Regel, die die Preise\nstabilisiert, die Ineffizienzen, die mit Preisanpassungen verbunden sind. In einer offenen\nVolkswirtschaft h\u00e4ngt dagegen die Optimalit\u00e4t einer Politik, die nur auf Preisstabilit\u00e4t ausgerichtet ist,\nvon der Struktur der internationalen Finanzm\u00e4rkte ab. In fr\u00fcheren Papieren ist gezeigt worden, dass\nfehlende vollst\u00e4ndige internationale Risikoteilung mit den Ineffizienzen aus tr\u00e4gen Preisen zusammen\nspielen kann und dass im Ergebnis stabile Preise m\u00f6glicherweise nicht das einzige optimale Ziel der\nGeldpolitik sein sollten. Ein Nachteil vieler dieser Papiere ist jedoch, dass die internationalen\nFinanzm\u00e4rkte entweder so modelliert werden, dass es gar keine internationale Risikoteilung gibt oder\ndass im anderen Extrem die Risikoteilung vollst\u00e4ndig ist. Die Realit\u00e4t scheint aber irgendwo in der\nMitte zu liegen. Wenn wir zulassen, dass die Portfoliowahl endogen ist, ist es m\u00f6glich, dass die\nGeldpolitik die Struktur und Effizienz der internationalen Finanzm\u00e4rkte beeinflusst.\nIn unserem Papier analysieren wir Geldpolitik unter unterschiedlichen Annahmen bez\u00fcglich\nder Finanzm\u00e4rkte. In einem ersten Fall ist Handel mit festverzinslichen Wertpapieren und Aktien\nm\u00f6glich. Unabh\u00e4ngig von der Geldpolitik kann hier vollst\u00e4ndige internationale Risikoteilung erreicht\nwerden. In diesem Fall ist die Zusammensetzung der Portfolios von der Geldpolitik unabh\u00e4ngig. Aus\nden bekannten Gr\u00fcnden ist dann eine Geldpolitik, die Preisstabilit\u00e4t sichert, optimal, da sie die\nWohlfahrtsverluste beseitigt, die aus langsamen Preis\u00e4nderungen resultieren. Wenn auf der anderen\nSeite nur inflationsindexierte Bonds international gehandelt werden k\u00f6nnen, dann ist im Allgemeinen\neine Abweichung von Preisstabilit\u00e4t vorteilhaft, um Ineffizienzen bei der Risikoteilung zu mildern. In\ndem realistischeren Fall mit Handel mit nicht indexierten Bonds beeinflusst die Geldpolitik die\nZusammensetzung des Portfolios der Haushalte. Die Geldpolitik spielt hier eine zweifache Rolle. Sie\nkann genutzt werden, um ein Gleichgewicht zu realisieren, das dem bei flexiblen Preisen entspricht.\nAber Geldpolitik kann auch dazu dienen, die internationale Risikoteilung zu unterst\u00fctzen, in dem sie\ndie Hedging - Funktion der Bonds verbessert. Diese zweite Funktion ist konzeptionell von der ersten\nunabh\u00e4ngig; sie bleibt auch in einer Welt mit flexiblen Preisen sinnvoll. Wir finden also, dass in einer\nWelt in der nominelle Bonds gehandelt werden, eine Geldpolitik, die auf Preisstabilit\u00e4t ausgerichtet\nist, endogen vollst\u00e4ndige Risikoteilung sichert. Strikte Preisstabilit\u00e4t ist also aus zwei Gr\u00fcnden\nerw\u00fcnscht. Sie hilft ein Gleichgewicht bei flexiblen Preisen zu sichern und zum anderen Risikoteilung\nbei l\u00e4nderspezifischen Schocks zu erm\u00f6glichen.\n1 Introduction\nThe growth in the size and complexity of international financial markets has been one of the\nmost striking aspects of the world economy over the last decade. Lane and Milesi-Ferretti\n(2001,2006) document the increase in gross cross-border holdings of bond and equities, de-\nscribing this as a process of financial globalization. Economists and policy makers have\nspeculated on the implications of financial globalization for the design of monetary policy. 1\nMost central banks now follow a policy of inflation targeting. Under this policy, price stabil-\nity, appropriately defined, is the principal goal of monetary policy. Is this conclusion altered\nby the presence of large cross border gross holdings of financial assets, where movements in\nasset prices and exchange rates may have significant wealth redistribution eects?\nThis paper explores the implications of financial globalization for the design of monetary\npolicy. We can address the question raised above, because our model determines the structure\nof gross holdings of cross-country financial assets. The principal finding is that endogenous\nportfolio structure does not alter the case for price stability as an optimal monetary policy.\nIn fact, it may even reinforce this case. In an environment where financial markets are\nincomplete, price stability is desirable because it enhances the international risk-sharing\nproperties of nominal assets, even without nominal goods price rigidities.\nA theoretical foundation for price stability has been given by King and Wolman (1999),\nWoodford (2003), and others, using sticky-price dynamic general equilibrium models. A\nmonetary rule devoted to stabilizing prices eliminates the ine!ciency of costly price adjust-\nment. In an open economy, however, the optimality of price stability as the sole goal of\nmonetary policy depends on the structure of international financial markets. Benigno and\nBenigno (2003) show that stability of producer prices is optimal when financial markets are\ncomplete. But Benigno (2001) and Obstfeld and Rogo (2002) show that the absence of\nfull international risk-sharing may interact with the ine!ciency arising from sticky prices,\nso that price stability may not constitute the unique optimal goal of monetary policy.\nA drawback of many of these papers is that international financial markets are modeled\neither by the absence of any type of international risk-sharing (e.g. trade in non-contingent\nbonds) or by full risk-sharing (complete markets). In reality, international financial markets\nseem to be somewhere in the middle. Once allowance is made for endogenous portfolio\nchoice, it is possible that monetary policy rules actually aect the structure or e!ciency\nof international financial markets. Thus, the analysis of monetary policy with endogenous\nportfolio structure is an important direction for this literature.\nResearch along these lines has been hindered by the di!culty of integrating portfolio\nchoice into dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. This paper resolves this\ndi!culty by using a methodology developed in Devereux and Sutherland (2006), which can\nincorporate optimal portfolio choice in a standard DSGE setting in a tractable way. This is\ncombined with an otherwise standard two-country model of an open economy with staggered\nprice-setting. The paper allows for a range of financial structures, diering in the number\nof assets traded across countries. In one case, the only asset is a non-contingent real bond,\nand there is no portfolio choice at all. In another case, there is trade in nominal bonds and\nequities and given our stochastic environment, markets are complete. In an intermediate\ncase, nominal bonds denominated in each country's currency can be traded. Portfolio choice\nis then endogenous, but asset markets are incomplete.\nThe model delivers analytical solutions for gross asset holdings under each financial mar-\nket configuration. We ask how monetary policy interacts with portfolio choice in aecting\nmacro-economic outcomes, investigate how monetary policy influences the degree of inter-\nnational risk-sharing, and characterize an optimal monetary policy.\nWith trade in both bonds and equities full international risk-sharing is achieved, for any\nmonetary policy. In this case the portfolio composition of bonds and equities is independent\nof monetary policy. Then price stability is an optimal policy for conventional reasons, since\nit eliminates the welfare losses coming from slow price adjustment.2 On the other hand,\n2Throughout this paper the focus is on optimal monetary policy from a global perspective, i.e. where\nmonetary policy in all countries is chosen cooperatively to maximize world aggregate welfare. In our model\nprice stability is the optimal cooperative policy for all parameter combinations as long as financial markets\nare complete. Benigno and Benigno (2003), who analyze a framework which is similar to the complete-\nmarkets version of our model, show that price stability is only a non-cooperative equilibrium for certain\nparameter combinations.\nwhen asset trade is restricted to a real non-contingent bond, deviating from price stability\nis in general desirable in order to alleviate risk-sharing ine!ciencies.\nBut in the intermediate case, with trade in nominal bonds, monetary policy aects the\ncomposition of portfolios. Monetary policy plays a dual role. First, it can be used so as\nto support the flexible price equilibrium of the economy. But monetary policy can also\nenhance the degree of international risk-sharing itself, by improving the hedging properties\nof nominal bonds. This second property of policy is conceptually independent of the first;\nit remains useful even in a flexible price economy. We find that in an environment where\nnominal bonds are traded, a policy of strict price stability will endogenously generate full\ninternational risk-sharing. Strict price stability is desirable on two counts. It supports the\nflexible price outcome, and it also allows nominal bond returns to oer full risk-sharing\nagainst country specific productivity shocks. Even if prices are fully flexible, there is still a\nnon-trivial welfare case for price stability, if asset markets are incomplete.\nThe model implies that countries are holding large osetting gross nominal asset posi-\ntions, so that exchange rate movements can generate substantial `valuation eects'. But the\npresence of these eects does not directly change the optimal monetary rule. Because portfo-\nlios are chosen optimally, the wealth redistribution arising from exchange-rate-induced valua-\ntion eects represent the workings of an e!cient international financial structure. Moreover,\nmonetary authorities do not have to be concerned with these redistributions. It is desirable\nto use the exchange rate in the traditional Friedman (1953) manner - to generate e!cient\nterms-of-trade adjustment. The new insight from this paper is that Friedman's prescription\nmay hold even without his underlying assumption of sluggish nominal goods price adjust-\nment. When risk sharing is obtained via trade in nominal bonds, the Friedman argument -\nthat it is better to use the exchange rate to facilitate terms of trade adjustment rather than\nprice levels - is supported, even in a fully flexible price economy.\nThis paper is related to a growing literature on the analysis of portfolio composition and\nfinancial markets in dynamic general equilibrium models. The method used here is developed\nin Devereux and Sutherland (2006). Related papers are Engel and Matsumoto (2006), Evans\nendogenous portfolio choice into a complete markets version of a sticky-price open economy\nmacro model, focusing on the `home equity bias' puzzle. They do not directly analyze the\nrole of monetary policy. Kollmann (2006) and Evans and Hnatkovska (2005) construct\nnon-monetary dynamic general equilibrium environments with endogenous portfolio choice.\nKollmann's (2006) analysis is based on complete markets, also examining the determinants of\nhome equity bias. Evans and Hnatkovska (2005) employ a numerical approximation method\nto solve for portfolio choice.3\nA slightly older literature has examined the determinants of trade in nominal bonds.\nSvensson (1989) develops a two period cash in advance model to analyze the determinants\nof nominal bond trading and the welfare gains to asset trade, but does not characterize the\nspecific gross portfolio positions or the determination of optimal monetary policy. Bacchetta\nand Van Wincoop (2000) also develop a two period endowment economy model, and focus\non the impact of nominal bonds on capital flows. An early fundamental contribution is\nThe next section develops the open economy model. Section 3 discusses the approach\nto solving for optimal portfolios. Section 4 solves for the optimal portfolios and discusses\nthe eects of monetary policy on portfolios. Some conclusions follow.\n2 An Open Economy Macro Model\nThere is a `home' and `foreign' country. Each country is specialized in a particular range of\nproducts. Only the equations relating to the home economy are described, since those of the\nforeign economy are similar. Consumers can trade in a range of financial assets. The menu\nof assets is varied, but at its most extensive there are four assets, consisting of home and\nforeign equity shares, and home and foreign nominal bonds. There are two types of shocks\nin each country; interest rate (or financial market) shocks, and productivity shocks.\naddition, Tille and Van Wincoop (2007) present a method similar to that used in this paper.\n2.1 Consumers and Firms\nAll agents in the home country have utility functions of the form:\n\"\nX\n\nw\n NOw\n\u00b8\nwhere F is a consumption index defined across all home and foreign goods, O is labor supply\nand H is the expectations operator. The consumption index F for home agents is given by:\nF =\n\"\n\nF\n\nK\n+\n\n\nF\n\nI\n# \nwhere FK\nand FI\nare indices of individual home and foreign produced goods with an elastic-\nity of substitution between individual goods !> where ! A 1. The parameter  is the elasticity\nof substitution between home and foreign goods. Home and foreign goods are assumed to\nhave equal weight in the consumption basket. Combined with an assumption of producer\ncurrency pricing, this ensures that purchasing power parity holds in all states of the world.\nThe aggregate consumer price index for home agents is:\nS =\n\nK\n+\nI\nwhere SK\nand SI\nare the aggregate price indices for home and foreign goods.\nThe budget constraint of the home country agent is:\nSw\nFw\n= zw\nOw\n+ Sw\nw\n+ Sw\nQ\nP\nunw\nwhere Zw\ndenotes the net value of nominal wealth for the home agent, zw\nis the nominal\nwage, and w\nis the real profit stream of the home firm that accrues to the home country\nagent. The final term represents the total return on the home country portfolio, which is\ncomprised of Q assets, where Q  4. The term n>w31 represents the real holdings of asset\nn, brought into period w from the end of period w  1, and un>w\nis the period w real return on\nthis asset. The home consumer is the default owner of home firms and receives all profits\nfrom home firms. In cases where an international equity market exists however, claims to\nhome profits may be transferred to foreign consumers via trade in equity shares. From the\ndefinition of wealth, it must be the case that Zw\n= Sw\nP\nQ\nn\n> since, total w  1 asset\nholdings must add up to beginning of period w wealth.4\nOptimal consumption and leisure choices imply:\nw\n= Hw\nzw\nw\n= NSw\nAnd optimal portfolio choices imply:\nHw\nEach firm produces a single dierentiated product.

Sticky prices are modeled as Calvo-style contracts with a prob-\nability of re-setting price given by 1  = To keep the model as close as possible to the\nbenchmark open economy formulation, it is assumed that all prices are pre-set in terms of\nproducer's currency. If firms use the discount factor lw+l to evaluate future profits, then the\n4Firms earn monopoly profits because each firm is the supplier of a dierentiated good. Note also that,\nbecause the home agent receives all home profits, in a symmetric equilibrium with zero net foreign assets\n(Zw\n= 0), gross portfolio holdings exactly oset each other in value terms. This is simply an accounting\nconvention which simplifies the development of the model, but it is not at all critical. It is easy to treat\nall profit income as traded on a stock market. In this case, even in a symmetric equilibrium with zero net\nforeign assets, agents in each economy would have non-zero net portfolio positions. The solution method for\nportfolios applies equally to this environment.\ndynamics of the newly-set price e\nSK\nand the home price index SK\nare:\ne\nSK>w\n=\n!\nHw\n\"\nP\nlw+l\nl zw+l\nDw+l\n[K>w+l\nHw\n\"\nP\nlw+l\nl[K>w+l\n> SK>w\n=\nh\nK>w\nwhere [K>w+l represents demand for the home firm's output.5\n2.2 Monetary Authorities\nMonetary policy is represented as an interest rate schedule which is subject to stochastic\nfinancial shocks. Monetary authorities follow a policy that adjusts the path of the rate of\nreturn on the nominal bonds of their respective currencies. But in addition, assume that\nthere are financial market shocks which aect equilibrium nominal interest rates, outside the\ndirect control of the monetary authorities. This leads to an interest rate rule described by:\n\nSK>w\n\u00b6\nexp(pw\nwhere pw\nis an l=l=g= stochastic shock such that, Hw31\n[pw\n] = 0, Y du[pw\np\nrole of pw shocks in the model is to allow a shorthand way of introducing non-productivity\nrelated disturbances to domestic inflation rates.6\nNote that the rule (9) determines the nominal interest rate as a function of historic\ndomestic SSL inflation rates. We choose SSL rather than FSL inflation rates because it\nis well known that in a benchmark complete markets open economy (without `cost-push' or\ngovernment spending shocks), it is optimal (from a global welfare point of view) to stabilize\nSSL inflation rates. The main analysis of the paper will focus on the relationship between\nthe stance of monetary policy, captured by the parameter , and the equilibrium portfolio\n5When markets are incomplete, there is an open question relating to the discount factor \nw+l. If\nfirms discount future profits at the same discount rate as their shareholders, then both home and foreign\nintertemporal rates of substitution need to enter into the firm's evaluation of future profits. However, at\nthe level of approximation at which the portfolio solution is obtained, time variation in the firm's discount\nfactors drops out. The discount factor at this level of approximation is simply .\n6Devereux and Sutherland (2007a) provide a more complete justification for pw shocks.\nholdings among countries.\n2.3 The Menu of Assets\nAsset trade may take place in nominal bonds of each currency, and in the equities of each\ncountry. Home nominal bonds represent a claim on a unit of home currency. The real\npayo to a home nominal bond purchased at time w is therefore 1@Sw+1. The real price of\nthe bond is denoted ]E>w\n= The gross real rate of return on a home nominal bond is thus\n]E>w\n)= From the definition of the monetary policy rule, note that it must be\nthe case that Uw+1\n@Sw\n]E>w\n).\nHome equities represent a claim on home aggregate profits. The real payo to a unit of\nthe home equity purchased in period w is defined to be w+1\n+ ]H>w+1, where w+1 is the real\nvalue of home country profits, and ]H>w is the real price of home equity. Thus the gross real\nrate of return on the home equity is uH>w+1\n)@]H>w\n3 Solving the model\nThe model is closed with the assumption that GDP is demand determined, hence\n\\w\n=\n\nSK>w\nSw\nFw\n+\n\nSK>w\nVw\nSW\nw\nFW\nw\nThe full solution to the model is described by the sequence {Fw\n> FW\nw\n> e\nSK>w\n> e\nSI>w\n> SK>w\n> SIw\n> Vw\n>\n\\w\n> \\ W\nw\n> Uw\n> UW\nw\n==uQ>w\n}, and the vector w\n==Q>w\n} which solves equations (6)-(7),\n(8)-(10) and the equivalent equations for the foreign economy.\nThe open economy macro literature typically proceeds by solving a first-order approxi-\nmation of a model around a non-stochastic steady state. This method, however, can not be\nused in cases where there are multiple assets but incomplete markets. This is because, up\nto a first-order all assets are perfect substitutes, so the portfolio allocation is indeterminate.\n7Aggregate home country profits are defined as w\n= (SK>w\n\\w\n zw\nOw\n)@Sw\n=\nThe existing literature therefore tends to confine attention to asset market structures where\nthe portfolio allocation problem is not relevant. This section summarizes a procedure for\nobtaining optimal portfolio shares for any asset market structure by means of a second-order\napproximation approach.\nA full description of the method of solution for portfolio variables is contained in Devereux\nand Sutherland (2006). Here, only a brief account of the approach is presented. A separate\nAppendix with a more complete description of portfolio solutions is available upon request.\nThe method is based on an approximation where all variables except portfolio holdings are\nset at their values in a symmetric non-stochastic steady state. Portfolio holdings at the\napproximation point, denoted \u00af\n> are treated as unknowns, and the method yields a solution\nfor \u00af\nFirst, re-write the portfolio selection equations for the home country as follows:\nHw\n] is the vector of excess re-\nturns, using the Qwk asset as a reference. Second-order approximation of (11) and its foreign\ncounterpart can be used to obtain the following:9\nHw\nb\n b\nFW\n\u00b4\nb\ni\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\nwhere a hat is used to indicate a log-deviation from a non-stochastic steady state.10\nDevereux and Sutherland (2006) that this equation can be used to derive a solution for\n\u00af\n by making use of the following three properties of the approximated model. First, (12) is\na second-order accurate approximation so the individual components b\n b\nFW\nand b\n8In eect, \u00af\n represents asset holdings in a near-non-stochastic steady state.\n9Assume that the innovations are symmetrically distributed in the interval [> ]= This ensures that any\nresidual in an equation approximated up to order q can be captured by a term denoted R\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\n10The notation for returns is slightly dierent. Define ^\n=\n[^\n ^\n> ^\n ^\n> ===^\n ^\n] where ^\n(n = 1===Q) is the log-deviation of\nun>w+1 from its value in the non-stochastic steady state..\nneed only be approximated up to first order. Second, all assets are perfect substitutes in\nexpectation up to first order, so b\nu{>w+1 is a mean-zero i.i.d. process up to first order. And\nthird, in a first-order approximation of the model, the only aspect of portfolio behavior that\nmatters is \u00af\n.\nDevereux and Sutherland (2006) describe in detail the steps involved in employing these\nthree properties to derive a solution for portfolio holdings. In essence, the method combines\n(12) with a first-order approximation of the non-portfolio equations of the model to yield a\nsolution for \u00af\n.\nFor convenience, Table 1 summarizes the first-order approximation of the non-portfolio\nparts of the model, where  = @ [(1  )(1  )]. When  = 0, the model all prices are\nadjusted in each period, so the equilibrium is that of a flexible price economy. Note that, in\npractice, it turns out to be easier to work with a transformation of \u00af\n, given by e\n  \u00af\n@\n\u00a1\n\\\n\u00a2\n,\nwhich is approximately the steady state portfolio to GDP ratio.\n4 Equilibrium Portfolios and Monetary Policy\nThree dierent asset market configurations are considered. First, assume trade only in a\nnon-contingent risk-free real bond (the `QF economy'). In this case, there is no portfolio\nselection problem at all, and the solution is equivalent to the standard incomplete markets\nopen economy model with only intertemporal trade. To obtain this outcome in the model, the\nb\nu{w\n= 0 is imposed to replace condition (12). The second case allows for trade\nin nominal bonds in either currency (the `QE economy'). This allows for more international\nrisk-sharing, so long as the ex-post returns on the two bonds dier. But markets are still\nincomplete, since there are four independent shocks but only two assets. Finally, allow for\ntrade in both nominal bonds and equity (`the QEH economy'). This sustains complete\nmarkets, since there are four assets with independent returns.11 The key contribution of the\n11Strictly speaking, this menu of assets is only su!cient to sustain the complete markets equilibrium in a\nfirst-order approximation of the model. In general, it would be necessary to add a fifth independent asset\n(such as an indexed bond) to the QEH economy in order to sustain the full complete markets equilibrium.\nThis additional asset is not held in the symmetric steady state analyzed in this paper. It only comes into\npaper is the detailed analysis of the QE economy, since many previous papers have analyzed\neconomies with either no risk-sharing at all (QF), or complete markets (QEH).\n4.1 Optimal Portfolios\nThe model is entirely symmetric, and is approximated around an initial steady state where\nZ = 0. This implies that in the QE economy, agents in both countries will have bond\nholdings that sum to zero, and in the QEH economy, their equity holdings and bond holdings\nwill separately sum to zero. Thus, for the home country, e\n+ e\nW\n= 0 in the QE\neconomy, and separately, e\n+e\nW\n+e\nW\n= 0 in the QEH economy,\nwhere an asterisk denotes the investment in the foreign asset, and the other notation is self-\nexplanatory.\nTable 2 describes the optimal portfolio holdings in the QE and QEH economies. Note\nthat when  = 1 (unit elasticity of substitution across home and foreign goods), the optimal\nasset holdings in all cases are zero. This is the Cole and Obstfeld (1991) result that trade in\ngoods alone ensures full risk-sharing across countries under a unit elasticity of substitution\nbetween home and foreign goods. In the QE economy, optimal holdings of home currency\nbonds are positive (negative) when  A 1 ( ? 1).12 But the size of e\ndepends on\nthe importance of technology shocks relative to monetary policy shocks. When technology\nshocks are predominant, so that 2\nD\np\n$ 4, bond holdings tend to 1\n, while as\nD\np\n$ 0, bond holdings tend to 1\n.\nTo explain these portfolio shares, first imagine that each country has a zero portfolio\nshare of all assets. The model from Table 1 can then be solved by setting e\n = 0 and the\nresulting solution for b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\nb\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n=\n\n(xw\n xW\nw\n) \n( + )\n(pw\n pW\nw\n)\n\u00b8\nplay at higher orders of approximation, where time variation of portfolio holdings is relevant.\n) A 0 is assumed. This ensures that a home technology shock leads\nto a terms of trade deterioration for the home economy.\n13To simplify the notation, in deriving these expressions it is assumed that c\nZw\n= 0. Since total wealth is\npredicable one-period ahead, it has no implications for portfolio solutions.\nAt the same time, if each country held a zero portfolio, the excess return on foreign bonds\n(which equals the unanticipated depreciation in the exchange rate) would equal:\nb\nu{>w\n=\n\n(xw\n xW\nw\n) \n( + )\n(pw\n pW\nw\n)\n\u00b8\nWithout any portfolio diversification, (13) shows that in response to a positive home\ncountry productivity shock, home relative consumption rises, when  A 1. To hedge this\nconsumption risk, home consumers should hold an asset that has a negative correlation with\nhome productivity. Since from (14) the exchange rate depreciates when home productivity is\npositive, then it is best to have a long position in home bonds, matched by a short position\nin foreign bonds. The scale of bond holdings must be proportional to 1@(1  ) since the\npayo on a one period bond represents a one-time, transitory return, while the productivity\nshock is a permanent income increment. Thus, in order to hedge the consumption risk from\nproductivity shocks, bond holdings must be large relative to GDP.\nIn response to a home country interest rate shock, from (13) relative home consumption\n, when  A 1. At the same time, (14) indicates that domestic inflation\nfalls relative to foreign inflation, and the exchange rate appreciates. A portfolio with a long\nposition in home bonds will then have a positive payout, oering a hedge against the interest\nrate shock. Thus, in the QE economy, for both types of shocks, consumers would like to\nhold a positive position in domestic currency bonds, and a negative position in the other\nWhen  ? 1, the opposite reasoning applies. Now b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\nfalls in response to a home\nproductivity shock,15 and rises in response to a home country interest rate shock. So foreign\ncurrency bonds represent a good hedge against consumption risk on both counts.\nThe extent of nominal bond holdings will depend on the degree of price stickiness. As\n14This result does depend on the configuration of shocks, the structure of the model, and the monetary\npolicy specification. Under a monetary targeting rule for monetary policy, an optimal bond portfolio may\ninvolve a long (short) position in foreign currency (home currency) bonds, even when  A 1.\n15In this case the negative welfare impact of a terms-of-trade decline following an increase in x is greater\nthat the positive welfare eect of higher home GDP.\n falls, there is less price stickiness, so that consumers can ignore the direct consumption\nfluctuations due to interest rate shocks, and bond holdings will be lower. Note also that\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af ?\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af. Since interest rate shocks are transitory, households need to hold a\nsmaller bond position to hedge these shocks than productivity shocks. Thus, as 2\nD\np\nrises, gross bond portfolios will rise in both countries.\nWhen  = 0 (i.e. fully flexible prices) the solution for e\nD\nD\np\n.\nThe greater are interest rate shocks, the smaller is the country's bond portfolio. This points\nto a key qualitative feature of the model with endogenous portfolio choice. In the benchmark\nopen economy macro model of Table 1, money is completely neutral if prices are flexible,\nsince the model is based on a `cashless' economy as described by Woodford (2003). The QF\neconomy reflects this property (see below). But in the QE economy, where agents must use\nnominal bonds to engage in international risk-sharing, the excess return on nominal bonds\n(i.e. the exchange rate) is aected by interest rate shocks, even in a flexible price economy,\nas shown in (14). Hence, interest rate shocks reduce the eectiveness of nominal bonds as a\nhedging device against consumption risk due to productivity shocks.\nIn the NBE economy, households will also hold a positive nominal bond position in\nhome currency bonds (negative in foreign currency bonds) when  A 1, but will also now\nhold a positive share of foreign equity. Unlike the QE economy, portfolio shares are now\nindependent of the relative size of shocks. Since markets are complete in this case, the QEH\nportfolio ensures that b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n= 0 for every possible realization of shocks. This implies that\nthe relative volatilities of the shocks are irrelevant for the portfolio solutions which achieve\nthis.\nHoldings of foreign equity are given by 1\n. If prices were fully\nflexible, i.e.  = 0, then no nominal bonds would be held at all, and the optimal equity\nportfolio would hold a share 1\nin foreign equity, matched by the negative of this in home\nequity. This is a `full diversification' outcome. Agents in each country hold equity shares\nsuch that, in equilibrium, they have a claim to half of the GDP of their own country, and\nhalf that of the other country. When  = 0, the real return on equity is independent of\nmonetary shocks. In this case, agents hold no nominal bonds. In contrast to the QE case,\nmoney is fully neutral in the QEH economy, under flexible prices.\nMore generally, with sticky prices, the real return on equity and bonds depends on both\nproductivity shocks and money shocks, so the optimal portfolio weights must reflect this. As\n rises, portfolio shares held in equity fall, while the portfolio share in bonds rises. In fact\nthere is an interesting discontinuity in the determination of equity holdings at  = 0. With\nfully flexible prices, the elasticity  has no implications for equity holdings at all,16 and there\nis complete portfolio diversification. But for any positive  there is a value of  close enough\nto unity such that e\nr 0. Thus, there can be almost complete equity home bias even\nfor very small degrees of price rigidity, if  is relatively close to unity.17\n4.1.1 Portfolio holdings and Monetary Policy\nHow does the stance of monetary policy aect portfolio holdings? Using the parameter  as a\nmeasure of the tightness of monetary policy, a higher  can be interpreted as a policy placing\nmore emphasis on price stability. From Table 2 the following result can be established:\nResult 1: In the NB economy, a rise in  increases the gross holdings of nominal\nbonds. In the NBE economy, the holdings of bonds and equities are independent of .\nIn the QE economy, markets are incomplete, and bond holdings have to act as a hedge\nagainst a combination of productivity shocks and interest rate shocks. The higher is , the\nless impact will interest rate shocks have on the variance of consumption. As  rises, bonds\nholdings are dedicated more and more to the hedging of productivity shocks, which require\nhigher gross holdings. On the other hand, in the QEH economy, the portfolio which achieves\nfull risk-sharing is independent of the relative importance of each shock, as shown above.\nBut the eect of changes in the monetary policy parameter  in the model is only to scale up\n16This is because both relative consumption (as in (13)) and relative equity returns respond to productivity\nshocks in proportion to (1  ).\n17Home bias is equivalent to a value of e\nH>QH close to zero, since the zero-portfolio status quo implies that\nthe home agent owns 100 percent of the home equity. The potential for sticky prices to generate home equity\nbias in portfolio is highlighted in Engel and Matsumoto (2006). These results are dierent principally due\nto the dierent monetary rule employed in this paper.\nor down the relative importance of the interest rate shocks in overall volatility. As a result,\nchanges in the monetary policy stance which alter the share of total volatility due to the\ndierent shocks have no impact on the portfolio shares in the QEH economy.\n4.2 Risk-Sharing and Portfolio Holdings\nNow we focus on the risk-sharing implications of the portfolio positions under each asset\nmarket structure, and describe the optimal monetary policy rules in each case. To avoid\nissues of non-cooperative behavior, define an optimal monetary rule as one which maximizes\nthe sum of expected utility across home and foreign households. Since the model is fully\nsymmetric, in equilibrium expected utility is equalized across countries. Moreover, because\nthe welfare distortions due to both price stickiness and incomplete assets markets may be\nseparated, an optimal monetary policy rule may be described without explicitly solving a\nwelfare-maximizing policy problem.\nAs a measure of risk-sharing, Table 3 reports the conditional variance of relative con-\nsumption movements; yduw31\n( b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n). In addition, for each case, the Table reports con-\nsumption variance yduw31\n( b\nFw\nIt is easiest to begin the description of Table 3 from the NBE case, in which markets are\ncomplete. In this case, there is full risk-sharing. Since there is no home bias in preferences\nor real exchange rate variability, consumption is equalized across countries. Due to price\nstickiness however, monetary policy does aect the variability of consumption. A policy of\nstrict price stability will eliminate the eect of interest rate shocks on consumption. This\ncaptures the traditional role for monetary policy. By eliminating the eect of sticky prices,\nmonetary policy replicates the flexible price equilibrium with complete markets. In other\nwords, as seen from Table 3, setting  $ 4 in the QEH economy is equivalent in its eect\n18While the e!ciency of assets markets in risk-sharing can be assessed by the degree to which yduw1\n( b\nFw\n\nb\nF\nw\n) diers from zero, there is no special welfare significance to the use of yduw1\n( b\nFw\n) as opposed to the\nconditional variance of output or employment in either country. The comparison of yduw1\n( b\nFw\n) across the\nthree asset market configurations serves to illustrate the dierent characteristics of monetary policy in the\nQF and QEH economies as opposed to the QE economy. In particular, monetary policy is important in\nthe first two cases only to the extent that  6= 0. Finally, as noted above, all conditional variances are well\ndefined, despite the unit root in the wealth distribution.\nto setting  = 0. Since markets are complete, then it must also be the case that full price\nstability is an optimal cooperative monetary policy in the QEH environment.19\nIn the QF economy there is a failure of international risk-sharing, except in the special\ncase where  = 1. Monetary policy can enhance risk-sharing by eliminating the impact of\ninterest rate shocks on consumption. Conceptually however, this works in the same way as\nin the QEH economy. That is, monetary policy enhances international risk-sharing only by\nsupporting the full flexible price equilibrium of the QF economy. Moreover, monetary policy\ncannot attain full international risk-sharing. Even in the flexible price equilibrium house-\nholds cannot use non-contingent bond trade to oset the consumption risks of productivity\ndisturbances.20 Within this restricted class of monetary rules, a policy of price stability is\nstill optimal in the QF economy. But it may be inferred from the results of Benigno (2001),\nObstfeld and Rogo (2002) and Devereux (2004), that an alternative monetary rule (e.g. a\nrule which responds to both the interest rate and the exchange rate), which leads allocations\nto deviate from the flexible price equilibrium would do better. An alternative rule would\nact so as to eliminate interest rate shocks, but also lead consumption and employment in\neach economy to respond more closely to that of the equilibrium with complete markets.21\nHence, price stability is not e!cient within a wider class of monetary rules.\nIn the QE economy, the stance of monetary policy has a more complex eect. This is\nbecause monetary policy aects the holdings of nominal bonds in each currency. Monetary\npolicy has a two-fold eect on risk-sharing. First, as in the QF and QEH economies, by\nsetting  $ 4, monetary policy can in the traditional manner, support the flexible price\nequilibrium and eliminate the influence of interest rate shocks on consumption volatility.\nBut the monetary stance also endogenously enhances international risk-sharing. A policy\nof strict price stability leads agents to concentrate their gross nominal portfolio holdings\ntowards eliminating country specific productivity shocks, and allowing them to ignore the\n19It is assumed that any distortions associated with monopoly pricing are eliminated by optimal subsidies.\n20If productivity disturbances were temporary, then non-contingent bond trade would oer some risk\nsharing benefits. In this case also, monetary policy can enhance the sharing of consumption risk due to\nproductivity shocks, but it still cannot achieve fully e!cient risk sharing.\n21See Benigno (2001) for an elaboration, within a model almost identical to our NC economy.\npresence of interest rate shocks. In doing so, increasing  generates eectively complete\ninternational assets markets. Table 3 indicates that as  $ 4, yduw31\n( b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n) goes to\n( b\nFw\n) approaches 1\nD\n. Thus, price stability leads to the equivalence of the\nQE and the QEH economies.\nThe enhanced role of monetary policy in the QE economy is distinct from the traditional\nfunction of monetary policy in eliminating the eects of sticky prices. To see this, take the\ncase of fully flexible prices; i.e.  = 0. Then there is no role for monetary policy at all in\nthe QF or the QEH economies. But in the QE economy, monetary policy still plays a role.\nWhen  = 0, in the QE economy,:\n( b\nFw\n) =\n\nD\nD\np\nD\np\n)\n\u00b8\n( b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n\nD\np\nD\np\n\u00b8\nThe monetary stance parameter  still appears in (15) and (16), even though  = 0. Moreover\nboth consumption variance and the degree of risk-sharing are aected by the variability of\ninterest rate shocks. By setting  $ 4 monetary policy eliminates the influence of interest\nrate shocks, ensuring that yduw31\n( b\nFw\n) in (15) approaches the consumption variance of the\nNBE economy, and that yduw31\n( b\nFw\n b\nFW\nw\n) in (16) approaches zero. The influence of monetary\npolicy in this case operates purely through its ability to enhance the eectiveness of nominal\nbonds in hedging country specific productivity disturbances. The relative return on nominal\nbonds is given by the unanticipated change in the exchange rate. When  = 0> the conditional\nvariance of the return may be written as:\n({Vw\nD\np\nD\np\n)\nBy pursuing a policy of price stability, the policy-maker ensures that the distribution of\nreturns on nominal bonds depends only on productivity shocks, and is independent of interest\nrate shocks.\nThe welfare implications for the QE economy follow immediately from these observations.\nPrice stability is an optimal policy in the QE economy, even though markets are incomplete.\nPrice stability is optimal for two reasons. First, it eliminates the eect of sticky nominal\nprices. Secondly, even if all prices were flexible, price stability is still optimal because it\nensures that the real return on nominal bonds reflect only the e!cient fundamental shocks\nto productivity, and are independent of interest rate shocks. This ensures that households\nmay use nominal bonds to achieve full cross-country risk-sharing. Therefore, price stability\nsupports the first-best allocation.22\nThe discussion of this sub-section may be summarized as follows:\nResult 2: a) In the QF economy, international risk sharing is limited, and an optimal\nmonetary rule would in general deviate from price stability; b) In the QEH economy,\nthere is full risk international sharing, and price stability is optimal because it repli-\ncates the flexible price equilibrium; c) In the QE economy, price stability is optimal,\nbecause it replicates the flexible price equilibrium, and at the same time generates full\ninternational risk-sharing.\nThe generality of these results is discussed below. Note however that if there were no\ninterest rate shocks, then there would be full risk sharing, independent of , since in this case\nthe exchange rate would reflect only productivity shocks. But even in this case, monetary\npolicy is important in the sense that nominal exchange rate flexibility is required for nominal\nbonds to share risk. If one or both countries acted so as to peg the nominal exchange rate,\nthen no risk-sharing at all could be achieved in the QE economy.\n4.3 Capital Flows and Exchange Rate Volatility\nThe previous section showed that a policy of price stability can act so as to enhance inter-\nnational risk-sharing as well as sustain a flexible price equilibrium. What implications does\n22It is important to note that this result does not depend on our restricted class of monetary rules. Any\nmonetary policy rule that generates full risk sharing can be fully optimal only if it also supports price\nstability. Even when  = 0, an optimal policy using a wider class of monetary rule than (9) will ensure that\nthe nominal exchange rate responds e!ciently to productivity shocks, and SSL inflation is zero.\nthis have for exchange rates and capital flows? Since exchange rates aect the returns on\nnominal bonds and equity, this question also relates to the issue of how monetary policy\nshould aect the distribution of asset returns.\nTable 4 illustrates the implications of each asset market environment for the behavior of\nthe current account (locally equivalent to the trade balance) and the exchange rate. The\ntable shows the variance of the current account and the exchange rate as a function of the\nunderlying interest rate and productivity.\n4.3.1 Exchange Rate Volatility\nFrom Table 4 it can be seen that in the QF economy, for both interest rate and productivity\nshocks, exchange rate variability is lower, the higher is , while the same mechanism does\nnot operate in the QEH economy. This is due to the income eects of shocks, causing labor\nsupply to move in the opposite direction to consumption and output, acting so as to stabilize\nthe terms of trade. This channel does not operate in the economy with full risk-sharing across\ncountries. But these eects will partially operate in the QE economy, since risk-sharing is\nnot perfect in that case.\nHow does exchange rate variability dier across the three dierent asset market configu-\nrations? First, focus on a comparison of exchange rate variability for a given value of  and\np\n. Using the relevant rows of Table 4, the following result can be established:\nResult 3: For given values of  and 2\np\nexchange rate volatility across regimes satisfies\nthe following inequalities: yduw31\n({Vw\n({Vw\n(Vw\n)QF=\nThe expressions for yduw31\n({Vw\n({Vw\n({Vw\n({Vw\nare shown in Table 4. Both expressions are positive, for  A 1. Thus, exchange rate volatility\nis greatest under the complete markets regime, and lowest in the regime with no risk-sharing\nat all, with the nominal bond economy lying somewhere in between. Notice from the expres-\n({Vw\n({Vw\n)QE, if either type of shock is absent, then exchange\nrate volatility is equal in the QEH and the QE economy. This follows from the results\nof the previous section, since with only one type of shock, nominal bonds can achieve full\nrisk-sharing.\nResult 3 indicates that increasing the number of assets traded increases exchange rate\nvolatility, for a given monetary rule. But the previous section showed that the monetary\nrule itself could alter the eective degree of completeness of assets markets. This raises the\nquestion of how the stance of monetary policy influences exchange rate volatility.\nFrom inspection of Table 4, it can be seen that under both the QF and QEH economies,\na policy of price stability unambiguously reduces exchange rate volatility, since it eliminates\nthe direct component of exchange rate volatility coming from interest rate shocks. Under the\nQE economy however, the monetary stance aects exchange rate variability both directly\nthrough the aect of interest rate shocks and indirectly through altering the composition of\nthe portfolio. The first eect will clearly reduce exchange rate volatility, but from Result\n3 the second eect may increase exchange rate volatility, since it moves the QE economy\ncloser to the QEH economy. Again using Table 4, the following may be established:\nResult 4: An increase in  may either increase or reduce exchange rate volatility. In\naddition, the relationship may not be monotonic.\nThis result can be verified by looking at a special case of yduw31\n(Vw\n)QE where prices are\nflexible ( = 0). In that special case:\n(Vw\nC\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\np\nD\np\nIf  A (1 + )@, this expression may be positive. The more important are productivity\nshocks relative to interest rate shocks, the more likely it is that the expression is positive.\nMoreover, the relationship may be non-monotonic, since when  A (1 + )@, (17) is more\nlikely to be positive, the higher is  itself. Since price stability is an optimal monetary policy\nin, in the QE economy, it follows that an optimal policy may involve either increasing or\nreducing the volatility of asset returns.\nIn the more general case however, with some price stickiness, the direct channel of mon-\netary policy on exchange rate volatility becomes more important. In fact, calibration of\nthe general value for Cyduw31(Vw)QE\nC\nsuggests that it is likely to be negative in the range of\nempirically relevant parameter values.\nIt has been shown that monetary policy aects the gross portfolio position in the QE econ-\nomy. But the monetary rule also impacts on net capital flows. This is described in Table\n4. Given that productivity shocks are permanent, in the economy without risk-sharing, a\nproductivity shock has no impact on the current account, since there are no gains from in-\ntertemporal consumption smoothing following a productivity shock. Table 4 indeed indicates\nthat under the QF economy, the current account is aected only by interest rate shocks. In\ncomparing the QEH and QF economies for a given monetary policy rule, the volatility of\nthe current account is unambiguously higher in the complete markets case. It is also possible\nto show that the current account is more volatile in the QE economy than the QF economy,\nalthough the comparison between the QE economy and the QEH economy is theoretically\nIn the QF and QEH economies, Table 4 indicates that a rise in  always reduces the\nvolatility of the current account, since it tends to eliminate the component of the current\naccount that is due to interest rate shocks. But in the QE economy, a rise in  also increases\nthe weight put on hedging against productivity shocks in the optimal portfolio. This tends\nto increase the volatility of the current account, since the more that productivity shocks are\nhedged, the more the country will engage in trade imbalances as a result of the risk-sharing\nof these shocks. To illustrate this mechanism, again focus on the special case where  = 0.\nIn that case:\nResult 5: In the QE economy with  = 0, current account volatility is increasing in .\n23For  = 0, the volatility of the trade balance is always higher in the QEH economy. But for a high\ndegree of price stickiness, this conclusion may be reversed.\nThis result may be confirmed by noting from Table 4 that the volatility of the current\naccount is independent of 2\np\nin both the QF and QEH economies. But in the QE economy,\nthe current account may be then written as:\n(FDw\n)|\n=\n\"\nD\nD\np\n#\nExpression (18) implies that interest rate shocks reduce the volatility of the current\naccount, since consistent with the previous results, they reduce the usefulness of nominal\nbonds in supporting risk-sharing. An increase in  eliminates the eect of these shocks on\nbond returns and enhances the eectiveness of nominal bonds in risk-sharing. Hence it\nincreases the variability of capital flows.\nWhen  A 0, the conventional channel of monetary policy operates. In that case, a policy\nof price stability may either increase or reduce the volatility of capital flows.\n5 Generalizing the results\nThe analysis above is restricted to a special case, with utility linear in leisure, no home\nbias in preferences, and permanent productivity shocks. This is necessary only so as to\nobtain manageable algebraic expressions. The solution procedure also gives solutions for\nmore general cases, but they can be interpreted only through calibration and numerical\nsolutions. But even so, the qualitative results of the paper are unchanged in more general\ncases. Conceptually, it is straightforward to see why this is so. Even under more general\nconditions, but remaining within a framework where there exist just productivity and interest\nrate shocks, a monetary policy which supports the flexible price equilibrium in the QE\neconomy will lead to an endogenous movement towards completeness in financial markets.\nTherefore, because it eliminates all welfare distortions, this policy must be fully optimal.\nWith a more general extension of the model, the results would have to be qualified\nsomewhat. For instance, if more shocks are introduced, it is no longer true that price stability\nfacilitates full risk sharing in the QE economy, since eliminating interest rate shocks as a\nsource of variability in bond returns would not allow for complete markets. For example the\nmodel can be extended to allow for common shocks to the preference for home vis a vis foreign\ngoods. In that case, price stability does not generate full risk sharing in the QE economy.\nBut price stability is fully optimal in the QEH economy, because with productivity interest\nrate and preference shocks, setting  $ 4 eliminates the impact of preference shocks on\nbond returns, and allows a portfolio of equity and nominal bond holdings to support full\nrisk-sharing (an Appendix, available on request describes this model more fully).\nOf course more generally, for a wider mix of country-specific shocks, an explicit welfare\ncomparison across alternative monetary rules would be necessary. This would require higher\norder solutions.24 Nevertheless, the principle that monetary policy has a role to play in\nenhancing the e!ciency of nominal asset returns would still remain.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper shows how a simple benchmark two-country sticky-price open-economy macro\nmodel can be amended so as to incorporate endogenous portfolio choice. We solve for the\noptimal portfolio holdings of national equities and nominal bonds, and show how these\ndepend on the magnitude of stochastic shocks, the degree of price stickiness, and the stance\nof monetary policy. A key result is that a monetary policy of strict price stability is desirable,\nnot just because it sustains the flexible price equilibrium outcome of the real economy, but\nalso because it endogenously generates full international risk-sharing. This argument for\nprice stability holds even in a fully flexible price economy, and arises due to the fact that\nsuch a policy maximizes the risk-hedging properties of nominal bond returns.\nMore generally, our results suggest that while financial globalization alters the environ-\nment within which monetary policy operates, it may not alter the fundamental objectives of\noptimal monetary policy.\n24In addition, it would be necessary to compute higher order elements of portfolio solutions of the type\ndescribed by Devereux and Sutherland (2007b)\nReferences\nBacchetta, P., van Wincoop, E., 2000.
