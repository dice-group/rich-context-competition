    "abstract": "Abstract\nModern human resource management (HRM) has been found to be unsatisfactory as a model and as a praxis concerning\nhuman beings in organizations. This article proposes a conceptual change from resource to human being, which we define\nas \"persons management.\" After addressing what a person is (a subject navigating between individualism and collectivism; a\ncreative, ethical, and complex being), this text examines how persons can be managed, remembering that persons manage\npersons. In a dialogical sense, they can help each other and work together, even if they are adversaries. In that sense, persons\nmanagement must strive to be sustainable at the human, organizational, and environmental levels. We examine certain\ntheoretical and conceptual aspects implied by this restructuring of the field.\n",

However, from an ethical\nstandpoint,arepeoplereallyresources likeanyotherresource?\nIn this sense, the central question is not \"can we treat human\nbeing like objects,\" which is often the case, but how and why\nnot to do it. Moral philosophy from Kant (categorical impera-\ntive) to Jonas (responsibility principle) has proposed concep-\ntual frameworks to guide us in that direction. Furthermore,\nthe humanities and social sciences have specifically evolved\nby clearly differentiating people from the rest of the physical\nworld (Giddens, 1976; for reasons, among others, grounded\nin the hermeneutical dimension of human being and socio-\nlogical inquiry), as both their interiority and their will must be\ntaken into account. Although it is possible to objectify a per-\nson, this does not result in a complete picture of a \"human\nbeing,\" a picture that could do justice to its richness and com-\nplexity. There is a strong humanistic current in management\nthat have evolved in the 20th century from the human rela-\ntions school to the development of organizational behavior\nand organizational development with important figures such\nas Likert, Maslow, Argyris, and McGregor. They still are read\nand are sources of inspiration. However, many of their ideas\nand suggestions are still not used widely in organizations\ntoday. In this article, we will propose a critique of HRM,\nguiding us toward a management of persons in organizational\nsettings, which we hope could be more ethical.\nThe context and content of HRM teaching are important\nto consider. In North America and in other English-speaking\ncountries, HRM is mainly taught in management programs\noffered through administration faculties, which often advo-\ncate a unitary vision of HRM, and in industrial relations (IR)\nprograms through social science faculties, which offer a plu-\nralist vision of HRM. HRM is built as a discipline that is part\nof the general field of management, which addresses the\noperational dimensions in relation to human beings within\norganizations. Thus, generally speaking, management deals\nwith organizational behavior, organizational theory, and stra-\ntegic management.2 According to this point of view, HRM\nimplements the organizational strategy that is recognized by\ncurrent organizational theory, usually expressed in a form\nthat stems from the contingency theory rooted in a financial\nconception of increasing shareholders' equity (Khurana,\n2007). This legitimacy process draws also on a conservative\nand often positivist approach to human behavior, despite\nwhat organizational behavior has to offer. This could lead, in\n1Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMarie-No\u00eblle Albert, Professor, Sciences de gestion, Universit\u00e9 du\nRimouski, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada G5L 3A1.\nEmail: marie-noelle_albert@uqar.ca\nFrom Resource to Human Being:\nToward Persons Management\nMichel Fortier1 and Marie-No\u00eblle Albert1\n Keywords\ncomplexity, HRM, human nature, person, stakeholder\n2 SAGE Open\nour view, to serious problems of abuse and even inhumanity.\nNot only does HRM in management seem dominated by a\none-dimensional conception of human beings (often the eco-\nnomically conceived rational being), but it is also unhistori-\ncal, non-critical, and geared to a privileged minority. If HRM\nin IR appears more critical and more historically justified,\nrecent trends seem to demonstrate the same failings as those\nfound in HRM stemming from management because of the\nincreasingly accepted premise of the dominant \"economism\"\nwith its truncated vision of the \"person.\" To our knowledge,\nthere is no HRM university program grounded in the radical\ntradition of thought in management or IR schools.\nA first observation that stems from those preceding com-\nments is that North American HRM, mainly centered on\npractitioners, corresponds to the alignment of HRM practices\nwith strategic management and to its contribution toward the\nprofitability and use of the \"best practices\" in the industry as\na means of achieving those ends. Critical HRM, as is well\nknown, is European and more present in IR. Its supporters\nchallenge the unitary vision of their colleagues on the other\nside of the Atlantic, denouncing the authoritarian and manip-\nulative character of an HRM designed only for the sole ben-\nefit of management and shareholders. Greenwood (2002)\ngoes even further, claiming that ethics is almost absent from\ncurrent practices in modern HRM. Based on the works of\nLegge (1996), she explains the existence of two very clear\ntendencies among businesses: \"hard\" HRM, where human\nbeings are simply factors of production obtainable at the\nlowest possible cost and disposable after usage; and \"soft\"\nHRM, where the same results can be achieved in a more\nsubtle way through manipulation. Until very recently, few\ntreaties had been making ethics their central theme in the\ngeneral field of management and in the more specific branch\nof managing human beings. Winstanley and Woodall (2000a,\n(2007), as well as Pinnington, Macklin, and Campbell\n(2007), have all published collective works dealing explicitly\nwith moral issues raised by HRM practices and by manage-\nment, but a clear model challenging HRM has not emerged\nfrom their efforts, nor has a coherent ethical stance.\nHence,3 to achieve a new model, a first step would be to\nquestion HRM's very name (Inkson, 2008, has aptly ask this\nquestion), for \"[t]here are implicit assumptions inherent in\nthe conception underlying the expression human resource\nthat the passage from personnel management to the concep-\ntualization of human beings as \"resources\" has paved the\nway for renewed exploitation and abuse. The objectification\nof the human being is most certainly possible, but it does not\nmean that human beings should be treated mainly as objects.\nOver the past few decades, several authors have also\nexpressed the wish to see HRM profoundly transformed\naccording to ethical criteria, even if there is no real consen-\nview, this has not resulted in a transformation of theorizing\nor practices in HRM. To achieve those goals, we propose\nswitching from HRM to person management.\nIn defining person management, one must clarify what a\nperson is and how a person differs from a resource. This is not\na trivial difference because human beings viewed as resources\ndo not hold the same status and, above all, are not treated in the\nsame manner. Thus, we will compare what constitutes a per-\nson with its counterpart in the resource tradition.

HRM = human resource management.\nFortier and Albert 3\nA Person Rather Than a Resource\nWhat in fact is a \"person\"? In a sense, it is the opposite of a\ncentaur: we know what it is without ever being able to point one\nThe term person is widely present in common language.\nHowever, although everyone seems to be familiar with its\nmeaning, grasping it specifically remains difficult. How do\nwe then truly define a person?\nA Subject Rather Than an Object\nIf we consider a non-human resource, it is for us an object or\nan instrument devoid of will power. Because of its human\nnature, a person must be treated with respect and approached\ndifferently from other resources (Mel\u00e9, 2009c). A person is\nfirst and foremost defined as a subject, that is, a source of\ninfluence and intervention.According to Morin (1999), a sub-\nject \"is both an obvious and mysterious notion\" (p. 144).4\nNevertheless, it is possible to imagine a subject as the cause\nof its own action because of the subject's interiority, freedom,\nand personal autonomy (Mel\u00e9, 2009c). Yet, this autonomy\nand freedom cannot be separated from certain dependencies,\neven from subservience (Morin, 1999). Subjects oscillate\nbetween selfishness and altruism. On one hand, subjects can\nbe egocentric--placing themselves in the center of their own\nworld until they disintegrate at the time of death--while oth-\ners may mean nothing to them. On the other hand, subjects\ncan be altruistic, devoted to others and not seek all the atten-\ntion (Morin, 1999). We will come back to this complexity of\nthe subject, and thus the person (cf. A Complex View of\nHuman Nature Rather Than a Reductionism View of Human\nNature section) and to these notions of altruism and selfish-\nness (cf. Oriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather Than\nEgoistic section).\nA Flesh and Blood Being Rather Than a Category\nHRM defined human beings as resources; this founding defi-\nnition is theoretical categorization, which has profound prac-\ntical impacts. A resource can be easily \"tagged\" and that\nhelps us know in which compartment we can \"store\" it for its\neventual use. A resource has no say in this regard. The same\ncould be done with a person even though a person is whole\nand complete, in body and soul, and could object to our type\nof categorization. In this respect, Mounier (1952) explains\nwhat is a person:\nOne might expect that personalism would begin by defining the\nperson. But one can only define objects exterior to man, such as can\nbe put under observation. Here is my neighbour. He has a unique\nfeeling of his body, which I cannot have; but I can look at this body\nfrom without, examine its dispositions, its heredity, its form, its\nmaladies; in short, I can treat it as an object of physiological,\nmedical, or other knowledge. He exercises functions, and there is a\nfunctional order and a functional psychology, which I can apply to\nthe study of his case, although they are not he, the whole man in his\ntotal reality. Moreover, and in the same way, he is a Frenchman, a\nbourgeois, a socialist, a Catholic, etc. But he is not a Bernard\nChartier, he is Bernard Chartier. The thousand ways in which I can\ndistinguish him, as an example of a class may help me to understand\nhim, and above all to make use of him, they show me how\npractically to behave towards him. But these are merely sections\ntaken, in each case, through one aspect of his existence. (p. xvii)\nThe term person comes from the Greek word pros\u00f4pon,\nwhich means a face, a thing, an individual in the flesh, or a\nconcrete individual who is playing a role (Housset, 2007). It\nis what others see of the self and of its identity (Vernant,\n1996). This concrete individual and his or her identity make\nthis person a unique being. The conception adopted here of a\nperson rests more specifically on personalism. Indeed,\ndespite its heterogeneousness perspective, personalists agree\non a person's uniqueness and dignity (Mel\u00e9, 2009c). More\nprecisely, personalism differs greatly from any other form of\ncollectivism, because, in a community, a person retains\nautonomy and individual freedom. The person is not only an\nindividual who can simply be counted as part of a commu-\nnity but rather a unique being that can neither be replaced nor\nregistered as abstraction (Mel\u00e9, 2009c). A person also differs\nfrom individual, because a person is not seen as someone\nleading an isolated existence, linked to others solely through\na social contract. On the contrary, a person is seen as a social\nbeing intrinsically related to others and leading an interde-\nConsequently, a person is both unique and multifaceted,\ndifferent from others. Hence, a person cannot be understood\nby observing only one facet, and though grasping all of them\nmay seem difficult, researchers and specialists must keep in\nmind a person's multifaceted composition. Mintzberg (2009)\nexplains that individualism is a beautiful idea as it produces\nincentives, promotes leadership, and fosters development.\nHowever, persons are also social animals and need social\nglue to unite them for their own good. This is what Mintzberg\ncalls \"community.\" The community entails taking care of\nwork, colleagues, and one's place in the world. He positions\ncommunity spirit between individualistic leadership, on one\nhand, and collective citizenship, on the other. This view of\ncommunity is very close to the one that Mel\u00e9 (2009c)\ndescribes, in which a person shares with others common\ngoals and goods that belong to the community, while main-\ntaining a sense of individuality.\nA Creative Being Rather Than an Underling\nWhen we use a resource, we just want it to respect our plans or\nproceedings. Material resources have no inner drives so to speak;\nthey cannot transform themselves, and they are passive and\nmostly predictable. Person has already been proposed as a notion\nfostering human wealth (from a psychological standpoint) from\n4 SAGE Open\nthe perspective of enhancing capabilities (Giovanola, 2005,\n2009). Imagination (the traditional madwoman of the house)\nhelps persons find original solutions to contingencies they are\nfaced within daily life. This possibility has always disturbed\nrationalists who, at best, saw it as an aesthetical side to the mind\nand, at worst, an irrational aspect that must be eliminated through\nrigor and logic. Yet, imagination implies the possibility of mov-\ning forward, creating, innovating, and being visionary. Human\nbeings are able to gravitate toward an ideal even if they cannot\nfully attain it and, what is more, they seem to be able to question\nreceived ideas. Persons, as creative beings, are also intuitive and\nbase their actions on impulses, which lead them to reach their\ngoals (Shlien, D'Arifat, & Ducroux-Biass, 2007).Although their\nactions are turned toward the future, which is to say toward their\ngoals, they are not mechanical. Being creative is more an instinc-\ntive process, set apart from the intellect (Bergson, 1946). It is true\nthat \"a creative mode of thought operates outside of the visible\nlimits of a problem. It requires a sense of freedom that enables a\nperson to focus on a problem by using his or her imagination\"\n(Shlien et al., 2007, p. 78). Persons are therefore subjects, which\nimply that they are free, notably free to act in a creative way in\nany given situation and according to their own views.As bureau-\ncratic organizations tend to foster hierarchical procedures where\ncreativity is anathema, at least when it comes from below, this\nposes a serious problem for anyone wishing to standardize and\ncontrol human behavior from above. In practice, the underlings\nhave the unfortunate habit of behaving unpredictably at times,\nwhich leads to elaborate contraptions to control this nefarious\ntendency. In that controlling sense, HRM could be seen as one of\nthe best models to date. Last the notion of \"human richness\"\n(Giovanola, 2005) offers us a range of varied possibilities that\nare tangibly embodied within capabilities, as meant by Sen\nsible means to enable people to express their abilities in society\nand within organizations and to try to reduce inequalities instead\nof waiting for the perfect system, which may never come to exist.\nIt appears that, in its actual form, HRM is incapable of enabling\nthe full expression of human capabilities, whence the importance\nof evolving toward persons management.\nOriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather\nThan Egoistic\nHuman resources, if we follow economic lore, are individual-\nistic and selfish. More realistically, Flahault (2008), like\nMorin (1973), demonstrates that a person can be altruistic and\nselfish, as well as nice and mean to others. Consequently, it is\npossible for selfishness to inhabit a person who is nonetheless\nopening up to others. Instead of denying this phenomenon,\nbeing aware of it and taking it into consideration might be\npreferable. Human nature, as a concept, seems to condition a\nperson's ethical standpoint and moral behavior. From a\nrestricted view, human nature becomes one-\ndimensional, whereas, from a broader view, human nature\ncan expand in a more complex and realistic fashion (e.g.,\nJonas's ethics of responsibility or Morin's ethics of complex-\nity). To be open to others, a person should follow certain rules\n(Mounier, 1952): going out of the self--the antithesis of ego-\ncentrism, narcissism, and individualism; understanding--\nstop seeing things from your personal point of view and try\ninstead to see them from the point of view of others, while\nremaining yourself; taking upon oneself--sharing the des-\ntiny, the trouble, the joy, or the task of one another; feel what\nothers feel; giving--a person's economy is an economy of\ngiving, not an economy of compensation or calculation; and\nlast, faithfulness. In fact, a person's trajectory is a constant\nadventure, even though a person's general state continually\nchanges (Bergson, 1946). This faithfulness does not mean\nbeing bound to a restricting agreement, but agreeing to a sus-\ntainable relationship.These rules are similar to those described\nby Mel\u00e9 (2009c). In this respect, the \"Golden Rule\" or \"ethics\nof reciprocity\" require persons to put themselves in someone\nprinciple of human dignity: One can neither use nor treat per-\nsons as objects. Others are treated like objects when they are\ntreated as absentees or used in an instrumental fashion. To\ntreat others as subjects, as a presence, means acknowledging\nthat they can neither be defined nor classified for good, that\nthey are inexhaustible and filled with hope (Mounier, 1952).\nThe value of openness to the Other was developed by Levinas\nunderstood in three different ways. In the first, openness\nrelates to the essence of a human being opening up to be seen.\nIn the second, openness refers to consciousness opening up to\ndevelops, \"openness is the skin made vulnerable by insults\nand wounds\" (p. 105). This openness relates to sincerity,\nwhich means \"to embrace vulnerability, let go, and surren-\nder.\" For this reason, one cannot ask someone else to sin-\ncerely open up to others in this fashion, this process can only\nbe part of a very personal journey. Being open toward others\ncan encourage others to open up. Fa\u00ff and Albert (2005) dis-\ntinguish the logic of closing up from the logic of opening up\nto others. When a person closes up, exchanges and reasoning\npatterns become robot-like (Fa\u00ff, 2004). Thus, closing up\nbecomes an impediment to persons management. This sin-\ncere openness to others can reflect a humanistic leaning,\nwhich focuses on the wealth that develops within relation-\nships. In this context, a person, the whole person, develops\nactions that can be endlessly renewed, an approach that culti-\nvates long-term closeness and friendship (and not only calcu-\nlated trust).\nConsequently, moral foundations depend on the whole-\nness of a being, that is, of a person. According to this per-\nspective (Morin, 2004), ethics is rooted in the human trinity\nof \"person-society-species.\" A person is a psychological\nbeing who voluntarily develops an ethical standpoint through\nwhich to view the world. A person is also a member of a\ngiven society that influences this person's very being and\nmoral standards. Last, a person is a complete biological\nFortier and Albert 5\nbeing too, sharing common traits with other members of the\nsame species, such as gregariousness and a need for coopera-\ntion. Ethics associated with this trinity is necessarily com-\nplex as it emerges from dialogic relationships between\nindividual voluntarism, constraints, social permissions, and\nthe animal nature of a person. Furthermore, for human\nbeings, moral responsibility is a responsibility that cannot be\nshared, transferred, or abandoned (Levinas, 1981).\nA Complex View of Human Nature Rather Than\na Reductionism View of Human Nature\nHRM uses a simplified model of human nature, often implicit\nin its theorizing and not acknowledged either in practice.\nThis model is tailor-made to suit the demands of HRM stra-\ntegic requirements. Contrary to this tendency, persons man-\nagement put forth a conception grounded in complexity\ntheory. Morin (2001) explains that human beings are both\ncomplex and interwoven into complexity. Human beings are\nboth similar and different from one another. A person is a\nhomo sapiens (a rational/wise being) and a homo demens (an\nirrational/insane being), living with this limitless polariza-\ntion and never knowing for certain when it will be one or the\nother. Rationality is not localized, but rather scattered, satu-\nrated with irrationality, and only instrumental. Rationality is\nadapted to the practical finalities to which it is dedicated\n(Morin, 1973). Persons are therefore complex beings in\nwhom the principles of complex thinking can be found\nfaceted, persons comply with the dialogic principle, which is\nto say that persons make the existence of antagonisms pos-\nsible. In this respect, dialogic is defined as\nthe complex unity that exists between two logics, entities, or\ninstances, that are complementary, concurrent and antagonistic,\nand which feed on one another, cooperate, but are also in\nopposition and battle each other. In dialogic, the oppositional\nforces remain and constitute complex entities or phenomena\n(there is no synthesis, which is the expected result in classical\n\"Oriented Toward Other, but Strategic Rather Than Egoistic\"\nsection reflected this dialogic nature for humans, as we noted\nthat persons can be altruistic and selfish, as well as nice and\nmean. Second, emergence is rendered possible through intu-\nition and creativity. This is where we find the recursive prin-\nciple, which open up new forms of participation for persons\nin the organizational setting. Third, persons are also gov-\nerned by the hologramatic principle (\"the whole is in all the\nparts, which constitute the whole and is more than the sum of\nits parts\"). In this sense, we find some of \"Bernard Chartier\"\nin the French part of Bernard Chartier (cf. A Flesh and Blood\nBeing Rather Than a Category section). Fourth, persons are\ninterdependent, and so are their multiple facets. Finally, per-\nsons' common goals (cf. A Flesh and Blood Being Rather\nThan a Category section) follow the teleological principle.\nThis conception of human nature is a far cry from the reduc-\ntionist view used in HRM and is best suited for a world in\nconstant mutation.\nPrinciples of Person Management\nRather Than HRM\nThe term management comes from the Italian maneggiare,\nwhich, in turn, comes from the Latin manidiare, which is\nlinked to Latin manus meaning \"hand.\" The hand naturally\nsymbolizes force and power, so the word manus originally\nmeant the authority of the head of the family, the pater famil-\nias. The father had the power of life and death over the peo-\nple living under his roof, as well as imposing moral\nobligations on them (Sampley, 2003). For these reasons, the\nword \"management\" does not accurately fit the ideas we\ndefend. Yet, to date, we have not found a term likely to suit\nour purposes, so for the moment, we use the expression per-\nsons management. This expression refers to people manag-\ning other people, where a person is the common denominator\n(i.e., basic unit) for all stakeholders involved in cooperation\nand mutual aid, allowing the sustainable development of per-\nsons and organizations.\nPersons Manage Persons Rather Than Managers\nLeading Employees\nHRM helps to lead employees, and in this sense, managers\nand employees are seen as categories (cf. A Flesh and Blood\nBeing Rather Than a Category section). This conception of\nresource overlooks all the different facets of human beings.\nPersons are unique while sharing common features. They\nlive together and may choose to be open or not be open to\nothers, revealing as such their complex, creative, ethical, and\npolitical facets. Persons management is more specifically a\nrelationship where a person manages another person. It goes\nbeyond the traditional manager\u00ademployee relationship by\nbringing together two persons who are unique and who share\na number of goals. They both occupy different functions,\nbut they never cease to be persons, with all the complexity\nthat this involves. Both share the same community, which\nmeans that they are not only involved in mutual relationships\nbut that they form a whole, a \"we\" (Mel\u00e9, 2003). This \"we\"\nneither automatically implies that these agree with each other\nnor that they naturally envision reaching the same goals, but\nrather that they share a certain number of common elements.\nThis humanistic way of managing persons evolves within a\nhumanistic organizational culture, which has four character-\nistics (Kleinfeld, Cludts, & Mel\u00e9, 2003). The first relates to\nthe recognition of humans' dignity and uniqueness, their\nsociable character, and their capacity for self-development.\nThe second focuses on respect for persons and human rights.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe third looks at the need to care for those around us, and\nthe fourth explores the need for management that encourages\npublic interest instead of self-interest. These characteristics\nimply that persons are complex, unique, with common traits,\nand are open to others. This also infers that organizations are\ncomposed of persons (not resources) who have a number of\ncommon goals. This humanist conception does not ignore\nthe fact that businesses need a set of formal mechanisms to\nmake profits and to adapt to markets and their natural and\nMorin (1999) views persons as subjects oscillating\nbetween selfishness and altruism. Selfishness contributes to\nopportunism, whereas altruism calls for benevolence. Brun\n(2008) defines benevolence as an attitude leading to desiring\ngoodness and facilitating problem-solving with real respect\nfor each person. To offer a genuine interest, benevolence\nshould be present in everyday situations and not only in pol-\nicy statements. Brun (2008) explains that benevolence is not\na constraint but an opportunity and a choice leading to the\nhealthy growth of people and organization. Cappeletti,\nKhalla, Noguera, Scouarnec, and Voynnet-Fourboul (2010)\nthink that the time has come to find a benevolent approach\ncompatible with economic constraints. They define benevo-\nlence as the well-being of others, comparing it with charity,\nwhich also promotes well-being, but which does not take\ninto account others' true motivations. Benevolence can,\ntherefore, operate according to person management perspec-\ntive in which selfish and altruistic human beings can sin-\ncerely open up to others. It is only in the presence of sincere\nopenness that benevolence can exist. However, because of\nthe complex nature of persons, one must be clever and pre-\nvent the subordination of one's altruistic behaviors to others'\nselfish behaviors.\nEmployees as Collaborators Rather Than\nEmployees as Subordinates\nMost jurisdictions in advanced societies defined the hired\npeople in organizations either as officers or as subordinates.\nThis entails specific rights and duties for all, but the rights\nportion of the legal contract is rather thin for the subordinates\nwho must obey the officers of the corporation. If civil society\nis democratic as an institution, most organizations in busi-\nness and government are not. In the market economic sys-\ntem, competition is the predominantly favored mechanism\nthought to ensure regulation, within and between companies,\nwith wealth being the ultimate goal to strive for. Yet, compe-\ntition is far from being the only significant and efficient\nmechanism capable of ensuring economic and social regula-\ntion. One of the great characteristics of constructs relative to\ncollective actions (organization), according to Crozier and\nFriedberg (1980), is the actors' mutual adjustment within the\nstrategy. If confrontation is a possibility, it is rarely the first\nchoice. Thus, mutual aid stands as an important factor of\nresilience for those often submitted to important stressors in\ntheir work-related environment. A clear shift from patriar-\nchal and warlike values to more feminine ones based on\nsharing, mutual aid, and, above all, on concern for others, the\nvery foundation of ethics (Ricoeur, 1995) is also emerging\nwith many new ventures. One must recall that Ricoeur's def-\ninition of ethical ambitions is the aim of a \"good life\" with\nand for others, inside fair institutions. Consequently, if com-\npetition is sometimes an acceptable mechanism, its omni-\npresence or even prevalence can seriously slow down all\nethical developments. Furthermore, if employees are pitted\nagainst each other in an endless competition for economic\nsurvival where they are only hands executing orders obedi-\nently, the results could be counterproductive to say the least.\nAs Khurana (2007) points out, the alignment of modern\nmanagement on a purely financial conception of strategic\nmanagement relies on a very specific definition of human\nnature and consistent ethics. The highly controversial text of\nJensen and Meckling (1994) on \"The Nature of Man\" pre-\nsented human nature triumphantly filled with selfishness,\ncalculation, and some form of rationality. This conception of\npersons seems to dominate in strategic management circles,\neven though it is criticized (Mintzberg, Simons, & Basu,\n2002) as being incompatible with companies' reality. A play-\ner's economical selfishness abstractly built, shall we say,\noutside of physical life presents a psychological and social\nhorizon too narrow for human nature to be based on. Thus all\nemployees of a giving organization are best understood as\ncollaborators with different roles and talents, not as cogs in a\nwell-oiled machine or as subordinates ordained along a hier-\narchical chain of command. Furthermore, we could picture\nall collaborators as valued human beings from the humblest\njanitor, to the receptionist and up to the manager who must\nhelp them do their work and not be served by them like a\nnoble of old.\nAn Expanded View of Stakeholders Rather Than\na Narrow One\nIn HRM, the stakeholder theory has been cited as an example\nof how complex and conflicting political relations can be\nwithin organizations (Ferrary, 2009). Hence, in general, few\nstakeholders, except employees and managers, are considered\nimportant topics of research for the discipline. However, the\nstakeholder's perspective has become one of the pillars of\nbusiness ethics over time. As a result, stakeholder theory had\ngiven a voice to persons who often struggle to be heard. We\nadopt here the most extensive conception of stakeholder man-\nagement and considered all persons affected by the organiza-\ntion as within our field of interest. We will not extend further\non our comments regarding this aspect, except to note a trend\nin the recent evolution of the workforce in Western societies.\nOne of the most salient elements in the present-day context of\nperson's management is that the workforce is transforming\ntoward diversity. This situation commands the management of\ndiversity and welcomes tolerance of otherness. Over the past\nFortier and Albert 7\nfew decades, we have witnessed the development of a femi-\nnine and masculine multiethnic workforce (even transgender\nin some countries), of all ages, social environments, with vari-\nous curricula, and so on. The monolithic nature of the work-\nforce seems to belong to the past, but tensions subsist even\nthough laws in several countries prohibit discrimination. There\nis, therefore, a need to become more sensitive to difference\nand to adopt management styles, which reflect that difference.\nLast, workers are also consumers and that dimension cannot\nbe excluded from our conception of germane topics in person\nmanagement as a human life must not be conceived in isolated\nfragments (the employee at work) but constituted of many\ninter-related dimensions (employee, consumer, parent, citizen,\nplayer, etc.; see also Cleveland, Byrne, & Cavanagh, 2015).\nA Generalist View Instead of a Specialist View\nKaufman (2007) in his review of the historical evolution of\nthe field reminds us that in the personnel management era, a\ngeneralist stance was the norm:\nIt goes on to say that the term \"personnel\" as used in the USA\nstresses that the function is \"recognized as part of the\nManagement\" and that personnel is not just a staff function but\nincludes \"anyone who supervise employees, from the assistant\nforeman to the president.\" (p. 25)\nIn contrast, HRM has evolved and defined itself as a special-\nized field of study, a kind of technocratic solution to the\nhuman \"problem\" in organizations. A question could then be\nasked: Are the other business specialties not concerned with\nhuman beings? Nevertheless, being the specialist of the\nhuman \"variety\" of resources, hopefully on par with the\nother organizational resource specialists, entails professional\nopportunities and financial privileges. However, this has\nbeen gained at a price far too high in our view: the dehuman-\nizing of organization, the reification of the discipline, and the\nsubservience to economic elites often oblivious to those not\nin the fold. We believe that person management is best under-\nstood as the management of management and calls, for that\nreason, for a generalist stance, which embraces all the aspects\nof management. Organizations are many things, as Morgan\n(1986) has aptly shown, but fundamentally it boils down to a\ntool at the service of humanity; not the other way around. In\nbecoming a specialty of \"the using up of humans as resources,\namong others,\" HRM is oblivious to its most noble aims, the\ncomplexities, and the possibilities implied by them, which,\nwe insist, is a tool for the betterment of human beings. In that\nsense, it must be reformed in a profound way.\nEthical Comprehension of Behavior Rather Than\nMoralizing of Behavior\nFrom our prior comments, we can conclude that we need a\nnuanced ethical comprehension of human behavior and\nendeavor in organizations. But more often than not, what we\nobserve in HRM practices is a moralization5 of the actions of\nthe participants in organizational life, mostly directed to\nlower level employees and aimed at achieving purely eco-\nnomic goals. The flourishing of behavioral codes of conduct,\nof so called ethical codes (which are purely deontological, if\nnot legal, in their conception and application), cannot replace\nthe moral subject, that is, a person. Human beings are the\nsole repository of moral impulse, moral imagination, and\nmoral conduct. What must be put forward is the possibility of\ndeveloping and using, beyond bureaucratic control, the\nmoral compass guiding persons. All the ethical codes in the\nworld will be of no avail if there are no moral human beings\nto comprehend them, interpret them, and correct them as the\nsituation commands. We are conscious that some people\ncherish the idea that human being cannot be moral if they are\nnot constrained to be.6 It is not a belief we share, as history\nhad amply proven otherwise; on the contrary, human beings\nare the only and last moral bastions. Following the rules\nblindly had resulted in all sorts of disastrous and inhuman\ndeeds.7 This is not to say that rules are not important but that\nthey alone cannot be the solution. We need persons with real\nethical understanding, not the factice or cosmetic window\ndressing offered by many ethical codes, which is all the\nmorality some organizations have to offer (Pinnington et al.,\nSome Operational Characteristics\nFollowing our discussion on principles used to manage per-\nsons, we will now look at elements characterizing implemen-\ntation, which will help understand how person management\ncould distinguished itself from HRM in concrete organiza-\ntions. We are not exhaustive in this demonstration.8 We will\npresent only a few salient examples, which are impartiality,\nthe sharing of advantages and risks, the use of tools, the\nimplied time horizon, the hidden costs, and, as a synthesis,\nthe articulation of different types of logic.\nImpartiality in Human Relation Rather Than\nImpersonality\nManagers and employees have traditionally had an imper-\nsonal and task-oriented relationship with one another. This\nimpersonality was put forth to avoid nepotism and favorit-\nism. Impersonality refers to an abstraction of the person.\nWith this impersonality, a human is not a subject, but instead\nan object, and persons need to be recognized as subjects. So,\nto avoid favoritism, we have to use another principle of\naction, which is not fraught with difficulty like impersonal-\nity. Duhamel (2003) distinguishes impartiality from imper-\nsonality. Impartiality does not require that you be friends or\nthat you make friends, but if you do have friends, you are\nlinked to them through social obligations that fall under the\ncriterion of impartiality. \u00d6zler and Buyukarslan (2011)\n8 SAGE Open\ndefine impartiality as the opposite of favoritism. It combines\nindividualist and collectivist dimensions (like the notion of\nthe person). The difference between impersonality and\nimpartiality is not just conceptual. In a practical way, imper-\nsonality puts processes at the center of organizations and\nmakes them responsible for all actions. As Bauman (1994)\nhave aptly commented, if things go wrong within an organi-\nzation where the responsibility is impersonal, the result is\nastonishing: In practice, nobody is held responsible if every-\none has followed the rules. When nobody feels responsible,\nhorrible deeds could be accomplished. Impartiality allows\nperson to be responsible and promotes relationship between\ndifferent persons, not necessarily friendship, but openness to\nothers.\nSharing of Advantages and Risks Rather Than\nAsymmetrical Power and Advantages\nMuch has been said about the financial risks incurred by\nentrepreneurs and investors in business projects. In this mat-\nter, the most adverse outcome is bankruptcy, which happens\nquite frequently with small businesses. Yet, employees also\nexperience risks and inconveniences. Senior executives are\nin a distinctive situation because they can negotiate consid-\nerable advantages that often shelter them from the basic\ncontingencies of everyday life. The situation of \"mere\"\nemployees is strikingly different. Certain employees risk\ntheir health, even their lives. Each year, in every country,\nwork-related accidents and deaths paint a sad picture. When\nwe add employees who have mental health problems in the\nworkplace, it seems that any financial compensation would\nseem negligible for those facing these risks. But work is\nrarely a choice; it's a necessity for most people. We must\nalso take into account the inconveniences and sacrifices\nnecessary for employees to obtain a position, not to mention\nto keep it. Thus, employees must be mobile and available;\nthey must accept the fact that work ties are weak and that\nthey will have to cope with the business cycle. Although the\nnotion of suffering at work has long interested specialists,\nfew have highlighted the advantages of pleasant working\nconditions. It is possible that the Puritan attitude, which\nstemmed from Protestant work ethics, has held up the devel-\nopment of a work organization focused on the well-being of\nits employees, and not solely on work discipline as it is usu-\nally understood (Barbash, 1984). Relationships with col-\nleagues have long been recognized as a key factor of\nresilience in the workplace (Brun, 2002). Contrary to com-\npetitive situations in which workers are pitted \"against\"\neach other, cooperation and participation foster interper-\nsonal ties, which permit the unfolding of positive effects\nthrough supportive social relationships. In the same way,\nhierarchal relationships within the workplace provide a\nplethora of possibilities, which stems from the style of lead-\nership adopted, a style that must be chosen to induce respect\nand morality toward the employees.\nConsidering the set of mental and physical health factors,\nentailed by the psychosocial factors of work within firms, we\nare forced to conclude that one must have a global and ethi-\ncal vision to use the tools to manage employees, from job\nattribution to performance appreciation. Only a wide per-\nspective enables corrections to be made to current practices\nand makes it possible to go beyond traditional HRM.\nTraditional HRM has proven to be successful in terms of\nincreasing a firm's sales figures, but demonstrates far less\nsuccess in terms of increasing human well-being. A good\nstart would be to better balance all the advantages and disad-\nvantages encountered by working in organization (Cleveland\nTools as Guide and Not as Ends in Themselves\nHRM in practice is mainly concerned with tools as it is fash-\nioned as a bureaucratic solution to the human problem in\norganizations. In keeping with this spirit, Pettersen (2000)\nexplains how to develop and validate measurement instru-\nments to assess human potential in organizations. He advo-\ncates a mechanistic approach to lessen the judgment and\ninterpretation of the persons building and using the tool. This\nconception comes close to the computer metaphor (Morgan,\n1986). Yet, if one wants to be able to take into account the\ncomplexity of persons and their environment, it would be\npreferable to change metaphors. An alternative metaphor\nfounded on the concept of enaction may better take into\naccount at the same time the subjective character of the sub-\nject as well as the objective character of the object. This\nwould allow persons to use the tools as guides and use their\nprofessional judgment to act. The tools are representations of\na reality, but they are not the reality (the map is not the terri-\ntory). Although these representations are useful for under-\nstanding reality, they should leave room for professional\njudgment. Acting within the computer metaphor may lead to\nbeing less responsible, because, in this case, the action does\nnot depend on reflection but on an automatic procedure. The\nactor is not responsible for the action because he has not\nmade a decision; rather, he has applied a procedure mechani-\ncally. In this instance, the tool, which can be seen at the out-\nset as a way of attaining finality, can become an end unto\nitself. This change from medium to end makes it possible to\ndisregard the essential finality. A mechanistic approach,\nthrough its determinism, puts emphasis on the fulfillment of\nprefixed criteria. However, complex situations (the same is\ntrue of persons) shed light on unexpected elements. This\nunpredictability can help reach the original finalities differ-\nently from the way previously programmed. Must we favor\nthe ends we strive to reach or stick to the ways we have cho-\nsen for reaching them? Adopting logic based on finalities\nrather than on processes would seem to us preferable for\nordering priorities. The professionalism of managers allows\nthem to use their judgment in attaining their goal because\nthey are guided, not blinded, by management tools. This\nFortier and Albert 9\ncould be embraced by all persons working in organizational\nsetting.\nLong-Term Orientation (Sustainable) Rather Than\nShort-Term Orientation\nFor Pirson and Lawrence (2010), the \"economic man\"\nengages only in short-term transactions because he acts on\nopportunities. At its extreme, it is predatory behavior often\nfounded on individualistic premises. In contrast, humanist\nphilosophers envision the long-term relationships with oth-\ners as a central element for human beings, a condition stem-\nming from \"being together\" in this world. Management, as\nMel\u00e9 (2009a) points out, is often guided by the idea that each\nperson is different and must be treated according to her or his\nqualities and personality. Even if these concepts apply mainly\nto the management of talents, it is possible that they will\nbecome the key to the success of organizations, leading to\nhumanistic and economic approaches complementing each\nother (Pirson & Lawrence, 2010). Beaupr\u00e9, Cloutier,\nGendron, Jim\u00e9nez, and Morin (2008) explain that sustain-\nable development does not condemn all economic activity; it\nmeans considering this activity differently, taking into\naccount the limits of both the environment and the develop-\nmental aspirations of individuals and organizations.\nAccording to these authors, complying with these precepts of\ncorporate social responsibility (CSR) can have positive con-\nsequences on organizational health. Nevertheless, Beaupr\u00e9\net al. notes that the implementation of CSR practices and sus-\ntainable development had not really helped integrating the\nhuman dimension at the heart of values and principles of\nsocial responsibility within organizations. Consequently,\nintroducing CSR and sustainable development principles\ninto HRM practices remains in an embryonic state or is only\nslowly being implemented in businesses. Plinio (2009)\ndefines the sustainable performance of organizations as the\nperformance that makes the attainment of short-term objec-\ntives possible while remaining focused on long-term objec-\ntives. Therefore, all results, short term as well as long term,\nincrease the benefits for the organization, the parties\ninvolved, and our civil society. Delios (2010) explains that\norganizational leaders should proactively modify the nature\nof their competitive environment by promoting social\nresponsibility. Finally, Marchington (2015) have recently\nnoted that HRM is neglecting the long-term perspective in\nlooking up too much on the hierarchy and with his narrow\nfocus on performance goals even if unfortunate conse-\nquences will follow for its practitioners.\nGarriga and Mel\u00e9 (2004) have classified the different\nCSR conceptions into several categories: instrumental,\npolitical, integrative, and ethical. The CSR advocated by\nBeaupr\u00e9 et al. (2008) can be identified with the fourth group,\nthe ethical one. This corresponds to person management\nbased simultaneously on ethics and sustainability. Thus, by\nrethinking management sciences according to a humanist\nperspective, we are looking at the long-term horizon even\nthough it is possible to have partial objectives helpful in\nattaining ulterior goals (Mel\u00e9, 2009b). The CSR, whatever\nits shape, is an integral part of an organization's strategy. To\nwork, such a strategy should be part of the common goals\nshared by the members of the organization, even though the\nintent might change over time. This sustainable develop-\nment of persons can also help reduce costs (often hidden\ncosts) associated with turnover, absenteeism, and so on.\nTaking Into Consideration Hidden Costs Not Just\nthe Obvious One\nManaging persons with little benevolence may seem to\nincrease performance in the short term. For example, Mel\u00e9\n(2009a) explains that massive layoffs and relocating facto-\nries in view of saving money on salaries, as well as other\npractices, illustrate how powerful and widespread this con-\nception of short-term economics is. Yet, practices that do not\nemphasize persons management can generate substantial\nhidden costs, as defined by Savall and Zardet (2008). For\nexample, based on the literature regarding work-related\nstress, Leung, Skitmore, and Chan (2007) re-explore the dif-\nferent kinds of stressors. There are personal stressors, task-\nrelated stressors, organizational stressors, and physical\nstressors. It is therefore possible to observe that only the per-\nsonal stressors (type A behavior, for example), cannot be\nlessened through an ethical and responsible management of\npersons. Persons management means, among other things,\ntaking into consideration almost all of the stressors to\ndecrease their impact. The American Institute of Stress esti-\nmates that work-related stress costs American companies\nmore than US$300 billion per year (Bishara & Schipani,\n2009). In fact, stress can lead to absenteeism, employee turn-\nover, mistakes, reduced productivity, increased professional\nburnouts, lower morale, as well as higher risks of drug and\nalcohol use, violence at work, and harassment (Bishara &\nment often looks carefully at the costs related to their divi-\nsion, numerous hidden costs are not considered (Garman,\nCorbett, Grady, & Benesh, 2005). For example, according to\nO'Connell and Kung (2007), there are three main compo-\nnents associated with retention costs not often calculated:\nstaffing, vacation, and training. Cascio (1999) defines four\ntypes of hidden costs: separation, replacement, training, and\nthe difference in the performance between those who have\nleft and their replacements. Few studies have measured these\ncosts, but Hillmer, Hillmer, and McRoberts (2004) evaluate\nthe \"real costs\" of turnover in call centers, which were major.\nHowever, even if it is obvious that employee turnover gener-\nates other types of hidden costs, the difficulty of evaluating\nthem makes it also difficult to document them. Following\nthis lead, recent studies have focused on the hidden costs of\nabsenteeism, such as Cascio and Boudreau (2010). Even if\nmany authors agree that there are costs generated by\npresenteeism, this type of cost is even less examined than the\nfirst two we cited. The studies evaluating costs are sparse,\nbecause it is difficult to quantify the amount of money that\norganizations could save by reducing employee turnover,\nabsenteeism, and other adverse effects of stressors (Bishara\n& Schipani, 2009). But these costs could nevertheless be\nestimated important, and HRM does not even acknowledge\nthem most of the time. Person management tries to obtain\nestimates of all the costs and not only those traditionally\nconsidered.\nArticulating Different Logics Rather Than\nShareholder Value Maximization\nPersons use points of view, ways of thinking, and values,\nwhich convey a genuine strategy and way of understanding\norganizational life. These different logic perspectives can\nsometimes converge, but they are frequently divergent, if not\ncontradictory. Morgan (1986, as well as Burrell & Morgan,\n1979), in presenting the political nature of the organization,\nunderlines the three all-important ideologies that are in direct\nopposition within the organizational space, ideologies\nemphasizing the different types of logic that sustain persons\nas strategic actors. Therefore, the unitary vision, often fos-\ntered by owners and top managers, denies that there are dif-\nferences in interests and power, and that conflicts are inherent\nin the organization of work. Unlike the previous perspective,\nthe radical perspective challenges not only a difference in\ninterests at work and power relationships but also the legiti-\nmacy of the claims made by leaders in market economies.\nThe pluralist vision, which is sometimes seen as an awkward\nreformist perspective, favors the multiple stakeholder per-\nspective. This view recognizes the plural nature of interests\nand forms of power in organizations and accepts the conflict-\ning nature of the relationships between the protagonists that\nthis entails. Yet, this perspective opens the door for an even-\ntual agreement between the actors. Recently, Buren,\nGreenwood, and Sheenan (2011) examine the hypotheses\nbehind the strategic management of the unitary perspective,\nwhich informs the conception of many HRM practitioners.\nTheir analysis of HRM reflects Khurana's (2007) insights for\nmanagement as a whole. It is useful to remind the reader that\nKhurana, after having traced the history of major North\nAmerican schools of management, was deeply concerned\nabout the fact that the high ideals that had spurred on the\ncreators of these schools had not resulted in a professional-\nization of management. On the contrary, given the alignment\nof the financial strategy on the valorization of shareholders'\nassets since the early 1980s, these schools of management\nhad become mercenary training camps. In addition, the idea\nof taking into account employees as primary stakeholders\nseems to have been abandoned, and the pluralist vision that\nrecognizes the differences between organizational actors\nalso appears, in practice, to have been dropped. In our view,\nthe choice we face consists either of adopting the uncertain\nrevolution implied by the radical partisans of change or a\nreturn to a revived pluralist view. We tend to favor the plural-\nist conception as a guide for person management as it appears\nto be grounded more solidly in business practices and from\nan ethical point of view.\nConclusion\nBased on numerous comments about the inadequacies and\nlimits of present-day HRM, in particular its alignment with\nstrategic management, which tends to commodify humans to\nbeing in the sole service of maximizing shareholders' assets,\nwe proposed that the real nature of human \"resources\" must\nbe urgently reconceptualized. It appears that human beings\nare not like other resources or assets of the organization. In\nthis sense, the notion of the \"person\" provides us with an\nimportant and complex conception of the organizational\nactors, a conception, which can serve as the foundations of\nrenewed practices. It may also point out to new directions in\nhelping emancipate human beings through a more humanis-\ntic management. In that sense, persons management may\nalso be seen as an ideal type in the Weberian sense. Even if it\ndid not fully exist in reality, it serves as a guide to improve\nour practices.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. The plural of person is people in English. In Human Resources,\nincluding in the Canadian Government, people management\nis used, and not persons management. Terminologically, per-\nson is considered very impersonal and cold, and is just a term\nused in legal writing. However, people management possesses\na meaning which does not convey what we are talking about\nhere. Person in its singular and plural use to describe human\nbeings in organization offer a more complex and nuance pic-\nture as Mel\u00e9 (2012) shows in a recent article.\n2. For each domain, \"popular\" textbooks in a university setting\nmake it possible to define the conception being transmitted; for\nexample, in organizational behavior (McShane & Steen, 2008),\norganizational theory (Hodge, Anthony, & Gales, 2002), and\nstrategic management (Dess, Lumpkin, & Eisner, 2009).\n3. It could be argued that changing the name human resource\nmanagement (HRM) for person management does not change\nanything in the field. We are in accord with the spirit of this\ncomment. However, if we want to change something, we must\nstart from somewhere. Language games are not innocuous\nand have the potential to change our thinking and our actions\n(see, for instance, Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Human beings in\norganizational setting have been characterized in many ways,\nFortier and Albert 11\nand this fact must be taken into account. Wren and Bedeian\n(2009) in outlining the evolution of managerial thought help\nus remember that we have talked in the past of people manage-\nment, personnel management, the human factor, human rela-\ntions, the social person, before settling for HRM where human\nbeings (persons) are conceived primarily as assets (for the use\nof other human beings [persons]). In the same vein, Kaufman\n(2007) insists on the historical duality in coming to term with\nthe human factor that is represented in the managerial tradition\nand the industrial relations (IR) school. Those strands fuses\ntogether in HRM around the idea that we need to go from a\ncost conception of persons in organization to an assets con-\nception. HRM was in that sense viewed justly as a progress;\nhowever, the strategic shift of the 80s and 90s does not have\ndelivered what was hope for. Suggesting \"persons manage-\nment\" is a proposal to go beyond the ambiguity of HRM label.\n4. The English translations in this text from French sources will\nbe our own unless otherwise noted.\n5. Moralization is imposing, controlling, and judging the moral\nbehavior of others while not be constrained by the same rules.\nThis offers no leeway for the person to use his own moral judg-\nment, only rules to follow.\n1994) about the lack of faith in human morality not guided\nby \"legislators,\" but also his presentation of bureaucratic and\nbusiness ethics hindrance to morality. \"In other words, no one\nelse but the moral person themselves must take responsibility\nmodern bureaucracies and inhumanity.\n8.
