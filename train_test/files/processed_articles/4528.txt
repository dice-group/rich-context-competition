However, although in acute trauma a\ndecrease of the base excess presumably due\nto hyperlactataemia is a strong indicator for\nan increased morbidity and mortality,6\u00ad9\nunbalanced solutions are still widely used\ndespite an additional decreasing effect on\nbase excess through hyperchloraemic\nFor short-lasting elective (trauma) sur-\ngery, crystalloids are generally recom-\nmended for perioperative fluid and volume\nreplacement;14,15 in contrast to this, goal-\ndirected haemodynamic management in\ntrauma surgery is regularly performed with\nTo date, there have not been any studies\nthat have compared the usual standard, i.e.\nan unbalanced crystalloid, with an infusion\nstrategy that uses a mixture of both\nbalanced crystalloids and colloids within\na goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm.\nEarlier studies researching this issue could\nnot exclude interference with occult hypo-\nperfusion or hypervolaemia as they neither\nmeasured circulatory flow nor did they guide\nthe administration of study fluids by\nadvanced target controlled haemodynamic\nmonitoring.12,13 With regard to the current\nconcept of infusion therapy, hydroxyethyl\nstarch (HES) should only be used for\nacute blood loss in noncritically ill patients\nwithout kidney disease.18\nThe primary objective of this present\nstudy was to investigate changes in the\nstandard base excess (SBE) as a key par-\nameter of the metabolic acid\u00adbase status\nwhen applying two different infusion regi-\nmens for elective hip replacement within a\ngoal-directed haemodynamic algorithm. In\none group, an unbalanced chloride rich\ncrystalloid solution was infused, whereas in\nthe other group a balanced crystalloid\nmixed 1 : 1 with a balanced colloid was\ninfused. Both concepts are considered\nstandard treatments in different medical\ncommunities around the world. As second-\nary outcome measures, further acid\u00adbase\nparameters, the amount of perioperative\nfluid infusions applied, haemodynamic\nparameters and renal function were\ninvestigated.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThe study was conducted as a single-\ncentre, randomized, double-blind,\nparallel-group study, registered with\nby the Bundesinstitut fu\n\u00a8 r Arzneimittel und\nEthics approval was obtained from the\nLandesamt fu\n\u00a8 r Gesundheit und Soziales\n(LaGeSo), Ethical Committee of Berlin\n(chairman of board 6: Dr J. Hamann),\nEligible patients were !60 years old and\nscheduled for primary elective hip replace-\nment surgery in the Centre of Musculoske-\nletal Surgery, University Hospital Charite\n\u00b4 ,\nCampus Charite\n\u00b4 Mitte, Berlin, Germany,\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom each patient at least 1 day prior to\nsurgery.\nThe patients were stratified preopera-\ntively according to the American Society\nof Anesthesiologists Physical Status\nClassification System (ASA 1 and 2 versus\nASA 3 to rule out confounding due to an\nimpaired health status).19 To determine\ndemographic and clinical characteristics\nbeside ASA, the risk for postoperative\nnausea and vomiting (APFEL score),20 the\nPhysiological and Operative Severity Score\nfor the enUmeration of Mortality and\nMental State Exam (MMSE) points,23 the\nhealth status (EQ-5D) of the EuroQol group\non admission,24 and the postoperative cog-\nnitive deficit (POCD) using the Cambridge\nNeuropsychological Test Automated\nBattery (CANTAB) and International\nStudy of Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunc-\ntion (ISPOCD) neuropsychological bat-\nteries were measured.25 Complications were\ndocumented according to the Clavien\u00ad\nDindo classification.26 There was an exten-\nsive list of exclusion criteria, which is\navailable from the corresponding author\nupon request. The study ended according\nto schedule.\nStudy groups\nThe study medications for intraoperative\nfluid management were either buffer-free\nRinger's solution\u00d5 (Baxter, Unters-\nchlei\u00dfheim, Germany), containing no bases\ndegradable to bicarbonate ions, alone\n(unbalanced group), or Plasma-Lyte\u00d5 (crys-\ntalloid) combined with Plasma Volume\n1 : 1 ratio (Baxter) (balanced group)\n(Table 1).\nRandomization into the two study\ngroups was accomplished using computer-\ngenerated random numbers and performed\nin blocks of four. For blinding, consecu-\ntively numbered (randomization numbers)\nclosed envelopes were used, which contained\nthe coded assignment to the therapy.\nBuffer-free Ringer's solution is character-\nized by its high chloride concentration\n(155.5 mmol/l), which resembles the chloride\nconcentration of 0.9% (w/v) saline\n(154 mmol/l). Although it does not contain\nany buffer such as lactate or acetate, buffer-\nfree Ringer's solution contains sodium,\npotassium and calcium as cations and not\njust sodium as in saline solution. For sim-\nplicity, in this study, the group who received\nthe unbuffered, chloride-rich Ringer's solu-\ntion is called the unbalanced group. All\npatients underwent general anaesthesia and\nwere operated upon by one of the authors\n(C. P.) or by another surgeon under his\ndirect supervision.\nGoal-directed therapy\nDuring surgery, all patients were treated\naccording to a goal-directed therapy (GDT)\nalgorithm as previously published.3 Briefly,\nin addition to standard monitoring, the fluid\nresponsiveness of all patients was monitored\nby oesophageal Doppler (CardioQ\u00adODM\nsystem; Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK).\nThe guidance parameter for fluid manage-\nment was stroke volume (SV). If the SV\nstudy fluid over 5 min, volume responsive-\nness was assumed and the fluid challenge\nwas repeated until the SV failed to rise by\n10%. Thereafter, no further boluses of the\nstudy fluid were given until a 10% decrease\nin SV occurred. After fluid optimization,\nmean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac\nindex (CI) served as safety parameters\nwithin this algorithm. In this context, nor-\nepinephrine, dobutamine or enoximon were\nallowed to keep the MAP between 70\u00ad\nsurface area.3 Previous routine data from\nthe Department of Anaesthesiology and\nIntensive Care Medicine, Charite\n\u00b4 \u00ad\nUniversita\n\u00a8 tsmedizin Berlin, obtained with-\nout goal-directed treatment showed that at\nleast 2 l of intravenous solutions were\nadministered during hip replacement.\nAn arterial line was inserted if this could\nbe accomplished within no more than two\nattempts; otherwise blood pressure was\nmeasured noninvasively. In both cases,\nmeasurements were carried out using stand-\nard monitoring equipment (Philips\nIntelliVue MP80TM patient monitor;\nPhilips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany).\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial, or\nin cases where arterial catheter insertion was\nnot feasible, peripheral venous blood gas\nanalyses (BGA) were performed every\n15 min until the end of surgery, and every\n30 min postoperatively until discharge from\nthe recovery room (ABL700 blood gas ana-\nlyser; Radiometer Medical, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j,\nDenmark).\nDespite the different origins, all blood\nsamples were included in the analyses.\nAccording to Toftegaard et al.27,28 it was\nTable 1.

Electrolytes, pH, blood\ngases, lactate, haemoglobin and standard\nbicarbonate (cHCO\u00c0\n-(P,st)) were directly\nmeasured using a radiometer (ABL700\nblood gas analyser; Radiometer Medical).\nSerum albumin was measured by the Institut\nfu\n\u00a8 r Laboratoriumsmedizin, Charite\n\u00b4 \u00ad\nUniversita\n\u00a8 tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, from an\narterial or venous blood sample collected\nat the same time-point. All blood gas ana-\nlyses were undertaken immediately after\ncollection of the blood sample. Blood sam-\nples for blood counts or blood chemistry\nwere sent immediately to the Institut fu\n\u00a8 r\nLaboratoriumsmedizin, having been stored\nat room temperature prior to analysis.\nKidney function parameters\nNeutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin\n(NGAL) was determined using an NGAL\nTestTM kit (BioPorto, Gentofte, Denmark).\nSerum creatinine was measured by the\nInstitut fu\n\u00a8 r Laboratoriumsmedizin from an\narterial or venous blood sample collected at\nthe same time-point.\nStatistical analyses\nResults are expressed as median (25% and\n75% percentiles) or frequencies (%), unless\notherwise specified. After checking the dis-\ntributions for normality, differences between\nthe two groups were tested using nonpara-\nmetric exact Mann\u00adWhitney tests for inde-\npendent groups or exact Wilcoxon tests for\npairwise comparisons. Frequencies were\ncompared using the exact Mantel\u00adHaenszel\ntest (ordered categories) or the exact 2-test\nin contingency tables. Changes in clinical\noutcomes with regard to time were analysed\nusing multivariate nonparametric analysis\nof longitudinal data in a two-factorial design\n(1st [independent] factor: groups; 2nd\n[dependent] factor: repetitions in time).\nTherefore, all the time-points were simul-\ntaneously compared on the corresponding\nresponse curves. In the multivariate analysis,\nthree hypotheses were tested: (i) differences\nin groups (Group); (ii) differences in time\n(Time); and (iii) one hypothesis about\ninteractions between the two factors\n(Group \u00c2 Time). Lastly, each group was\nchecked for differences in time, separately.\nMoreover, a nonparametric multivariate\nanalysis of covariance with the baseline as\nthe covariate was applied to adjust for\npossible baseline influences in some of the\npreceding analyses. After global testing, post\nhoc analyses were carried out to detect\nspecific differences with respect to groups\nfor fixed times (Mann\u00adWhitney tests). A\ntwo-tailed P-value <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant. All tests have to be\nunderstood in the area of exploratory data\nanalysis. Therefore, no adjustments for mul-\ntiple testing have been made. All numerical\ncalculations were performed using the\nSPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 20.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5, and the SAS\u00d5 statistical pack-\nage, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,\nUSA).

One of these patients had\nto be excluded before receiving the study\nmedication because of a planned extension\nof the operation, so 40 patients received\nstudy fluids and their data were collected for\nthis study. All patients received cementless\nhip replacement in the supine position using\na minimally invasive technique. The demo-\ngraphic and clinical characteristics of the\npatients did not differ significantly between\nthe two groups (Table 2).\nThe SBE and pHcalc\nwere significantly\nlower (Figure 2; P < 0.05 for all compari-\nsons) and plasma chloride concentrations\nwere significantly greater (Table 3; P < 0.05\nfor all comparisons) in the unbalanced\ngroup during (intraoperative course of\nchloride not shown) and immediately after\nsurgery compared with the balanced group.\nAnalyses using the Stewart\u00adFencl\napproach showed that the changes in SBE\nwere the result of changes in both chloride\nconcentration and albumin concentration,\nwhereas free water and serum lactate had no\ninfluence on SBE in this setting (Figure 3).\nIn this context, there was a significantly\nlower serum albumin concentration 1 h after\nsurgery in the balanced group compared\nwith the unbalanced group (P < 0.05) (Table\n3). Time courses of plasma lactate, pCO2\n,\nand plasma potassium (data not shown), as\nwell as plasma sodium (Table 3), were\nuneventful.\nAt 1 h postoperatively, there was still a\nslight increase in plasma chloride in the\nunbalanced group compared with baseline\nand the concentration was significantly\ngreater compared with the balanced group\nserum protein concentrations were signifi-\ncantly greater in this group compared with\nthe balanced group (P < 0.05 for all com-\nparisons) (Table 3). A 6 h postoperatively,\nthere were no longer any significant differ-\nences in serum protein and serum albumin\nconcentrations between the groups (Table\n3). The intraoperative time course of the\nhaemoglobin concentrations was similar\nbetween the two groups (data not shown),\nwhereas at arrival in the recovery room, the\nhaemoglobin concentrations in the balanced\ngroup were significantly lower compared\nwith the unbalanced group (P < 0.05). This\ndifference in the haemoglobin concentration\nbetween the two groups had disappeared at\npostoperative day 1 (Table 3).\nAs a result of GDT, which was guided by\nSV optimization, equal volumes of study\nfluids were administered to the two groups\n(Figure 4a). The SV (Figure 4b), as well as\nMAP, cardiac output and flow time cor-\nrected (FTc) (data not shown), did not differ\nsignificantly between the two groups during\nsurgery.\nPatients in both groups received norepin-\nephrine.

Apart from using a goal-\ndirected algorithm, at the time that this\npresent study was started, these two regi-\nmens of intraoperative fluid administration\nwere common practice in anaesthesiology all\nover the world.\nThe main finding of the present study was\nthat the administration of 1200 ml (median)\nof an unbalanced crystalloid solution with\nan unphysiologically high chloride concen-\ntration was able to induce acid\u00adbase dis-\nturbances as demonstrated by a significant\ndecrease in SBE compared with a balanced\ncrystalloid mixed 1 : 1 with a balanced col-\nloid. Surprisingly, although a colloid was\ninfused in the balanced group, this had no\neffect on the amounts of fluids needed to\nmaintain haemodynamic stability and nor-\nmovolaemia in this setting.\nThe use of balanced fluids within a GDT\nprotocol prevented the decrease in SBE that\nwas encountered when unbalanced fluids\nwere used during elective hip replacement\nsurgery in the present study. Since pCO2\nand\nplasma lactate remained within the normal\nrange, the developing metabolic acidosis was\nmost likely due to the administration of a\nhigh chloride load through the unbalanced\ninfusion solution. This notion is also in\naccordance with the calculations on the\ncontribution of chloride, albumin, lactate\nand free water to base excess (Figure 3).\nThese small deviations in acid\u00adbase status\nwere still detectable even after 500 ml of a\nbalanced crystalloid infusion had postopera-\ntively been infused in the recovery room but\nresolved within the next few hours.\nWhen preparing for this present study,\nthe amounts of fluids usually infused during\nelective hip surgery were measured and were\nfound to be approximately 2 l. However,\nusing this GDT regime, this present study\nrequired during an intraoperative period\nlasting a mean of 1:40 h (i.e. approximately\nAnalysing the data by the Stewart\u00adFencl\napproach revealed that the decrease of the\nSBE in the unbalanced group seemed to be\nmainly associated with the change of plasma\nchloride whereas the change of serum albu-\nmin, especially in the balanced group, seems\nto have almost no influence on SBE.\nThe idea behind the concept of combin-\ning an HES with a crystalloid (1 : 1) in one of\nthe study groups in the present study was to\nprovide sufficient hydration and to obtain a\nbetter haemodynamic profile.35\u00ad37 However,\nboth groups showed no differences in the\nintraoperative course of SV, cardiac output,\nFTc, or MAP or plasma lactate concentra-\ntion. In a study comparing a balanced\ncrystalloid with a balanced colloid solution\nwithin a goal-directed haemodynamic algo-\nrithm, there was significantly less haemo-\ndynamic stability in the crystalloid group\ncompared with a colloid group.38 This\ninstability was not seen within the first\nhour of surgery; however, it became appar-\nent after 1\u00ad1.5 h. In the present study, the\nhaemoglobin level was significantly reduced\nin the balanced group at the end of surgery\ncompared with the unbalanced group. This\nmay indicate that the circulating blood\nvolume was higher in the balanced group,\nbut since both groups showed no differences\nin the amounts of the study fluids adminis-\nthe context of short-lasting elective hip\nreplacement surgery within a GDT regimen\ndoes not seem to offer a benefit in terms of\nfluid volume as long as blood loss is small.\nAt the same time, there was no clinically\nrelevant bleeding tendency or increased\nblood loss and no increase in registered\nused in this clinical setting. In addition, no\ndeterioration in renal function measured by\nurine output, serum creatinine and NGAL\nadministered within this goal-directed\nhaemodynamic algorithm. These current\nfindings were consistent with a study in\npatients undergoing major gynaecological\nsurgery in which balanced colloids were\nadministered within the same goal-directed\nhaemodynamic algorithm.38 It has to be\nnoted, however, that this present study was\nnot powered to investigate tolerability or\nsafety issues of HES.\nThe equality of the amounts of fluids\ninfused was unexpected, since the volume of\ndistribution for crystalloids is the extracel-\nlular space, whereas the (physiological)\nvolume of distribution for colloids is the\nplasma volume. The extracellular space is\nabout five times the plasma volume.\nAccordingly, to replace a blood loss of\n1200 ml as used in the present study. The\nreason for this remarkable difference may be\ndue to the volume kinetics of crystalloids.40\nAccording to Hahn et al.,41 the initial frac-\ntion of a crystalloid that remains in the\nnormovolaemic patients and the shift to the\ninterstitium may take several minutes. This\nnotion is supported by the intraoperative\nand postoperative course of haemoglobin\nconcentrations in the present study.\nIntraoperatively, haemoglobin concentra-\ntions did not significantly differ between\nthe two groups in the present study, while in\nthe recovery room, the haemoglobin con-\ncentrations in the balanced crystalloid/\ncolloid group were found to be significantly\nlower than in the unbalanced crystalloid\ngroup, which might be explained by the\ndelayed shift of the crystalloid from the\nintravascular to the interstitial compart-\nment, whereas the colloid remained primar-\nily in the intravascular compartment.\nExplanations for these findings cannot be\nderived from studies on sepsis,42,43 blunt\nmultiple trauma44 or states of hypervolae-\nmia,45 where a leakage into the interstitial\nspace by destruction of the endothelial sur-\nface layer might be assumed as the mechan-\nism responsible. Therefore, the results of this\npresent study cannot be extrapolated to\nmajor trauma cases where there is greater\nvolume turnover due to the inflammatory\nresponses and destruction of the endothelial\nsurface layer is regularly present.\nThis present study had two limitations.\nFirst, no significant differences were\nobserved between the two groups regarding\nlength of hospital stay, mortality and delir-\nium/POCD. However, to address these out-\ncome parameters adequately, randomized\ncontrolled trials with larger numbers of\npatients are necessary, especially with\nregard to delirium and POCD, and possibly\nmore severe derangements in acid\u00adbase\nstatus induced by greater volumes of infused\nunbalanced solutions. Secondly, the present\nstudy was performed in patients treated\nwithin a highly standardized clinical path-\nway undergoing surgery with rather low\nblood loss. Therefore, it is not clear whether\nthese results would also be valid or even\nmore pronounced in major and/or longer\nlasting operations with a greater volume\nturnover. A timely application of colloids\nmay be advantageous in such a setting with\nregard to interstitial oedema and haemo-\ndynamic stability, especially if guided by\nGDT.38 In contrast, this cannot be extended\nto unstable proinflammatory situations (e.g.\nsepsis).\nBased on the results of the present\nstudy, during short-lasting (1\u00ad1.5 h) hip\nreplacement surgery highly standardized\nwithin a clinical pathway, even small\namounts of an unbalanced, chloride-rich\nsolution caused a significant fall in SBE.\nThese effects were seen even without major\nblood loss or volume turnover and within a\ngoal-directed haemodynamic algorithm to\navoid hypo- or hypervolaemia. In the\ndescribed setting and during short-lasting\noperations, this present study has neither\nobserved clinical benefits nor disadvantages\nreasons of volume replacement.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nAarne Feldheiser received travel support from\nDeltex Medical.
