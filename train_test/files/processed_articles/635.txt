The findings are based on the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey. The dis-\ntribution of help-hours is very skewed, mirroring the skewness of limitations in physical and cognitive functioning.\nControlling for these limitations, the most important coping resources are the combinations of helpers who join\nforces, and coresidence with a helper. The effect of helpers' networks is large and consistent across marital status\nand living arrangements. The networks are more extensive for married than for unmarried persons. In reference to\npersons who rely only on nonrelatives: (a) a network of a spouse and children enables a married person to have 40\nadditional weekly hours of help, (b) a network of children and others enables an unmarried person to have 29 addi-\ntional help-hours per week if he/she coresides with other adults and 10 additional weekly help-hours if he/she does\nnot. The issue of concern for public policy is whether such family networks will be preserved and, if not, how to ob-\ntain thefunds for the alternative of sufficient paid help in the community.\nTHE growth in the number of very old Americans can be\nexpected to increase the number of persons who de-\npend on others for long-term assistance with daily activities\nof personal care and household tasks. At present, most of\nthese individuals are living in the community and are rely-\ning mainly on informal help at home. Their ability to do so\ndepends on the community resources available to help cope\nwith disability. This study assesses the effects of economic\nand social resources that make continued living at home\npossible.\nInformal help depends on the availability of family\nhelpers and on sharing living quarters with them. The net-\nwork of kin relationship upon which elderly people rely is\nan outcome of life events that usually took place many\nyears earlier and are beyond their control when they are old\nand disabled. The extent to which children and other rela-\ntives are legally obligated to provide helping services is not\nclear. Bulcroft, Van Leynseele, and Borgatta (1989) sur-\nveyed the existing state laws on filial responsibility in 1988\nand reported substantial interstate differences in the con-\ncept of who is expected to support elderly relatives and to\nwhat extent. In fact, as Stone and Kemper (1989) show,\nfewer than one in four sons and daughters of disabled par-\nents are active caregivers at any point in time. But the\namount of help used at home also depends on living ar-\nrangements over which an elderly person may have some\ncontrol.\nA study by the Congressional Budget Office (1988), de-\nscribing changes in American living arrangements, sug-\ngests that both elderly persons and their children prefer to\nlive apart. Specifically, elderly persons prefer to live with a\nspouse only or, when the marriage dissolves, to live alone.\nbut the percentage of elderly individuals sharing living\nquarters with an adult other than a spouse declined from\nFund Commission on Elderly People Living Alone (Harris\npercent explicitly stated their preference for this arrange-\nment. Data from the 1990 Census show a further decline, to\n14.7 percent, in the proportion of elderly persons living\nwith adults other than a spouse (National Institute on Aging,\nHowever, functional limitations and disability may\nchange these preferences. Boersch-Supan (1990) showed\nthat a transition to household sharing with helpers was due\nto limitations in performing personal care activities. Bishop\n(1986) determined that the probability of living alone de-\ncreased with disability in self-care and mobility. But\nWorobey and Angel (1990) found that the preference of\nunmarried elderly individuals for living alone was so\nstrong that, except for the most severely incapacitated,\nthose who suffered a decrement in functional capacity over\nlikoff and Morris (1990), studying both elders and their\nchildren, concluded that children were less willing than\ntheir parents to share living quarters. In a multiperiod anal-\nysis, Boersch-Supan et al. (1992) showed that elderly in-\ndividuals had a very strong preference for living with\nchildren in order to avoid institutionalization and that high-\nincome elderly paid for help in the community to ease the\nburden on their children.\nThe present study differs from previous studies in three\naspects. First, this study measures the amount of help by\nthe number of hours of help; it is based on the National\nLong Term Care Survey (NLTCS) of 1989, which is the\nfirst NLTCS to have information on hours of help. Studies\nthat were based on earlier NLTCS (e.g., Hanley and\nby the number of days during which help was received, a\nvery imprecise measure of the amount of help-time. Sec-\nond, customarily, marital status and having children have\nbeen specified as indicators of helpers. The present study\nrefines these indicators by specifying as helpers the differ-\nent combinations of relatives and nonrelatives on whom a\ndisabled person relies for help. Third, this study differs\nfrom several other studies in its treatment of living arrange-\nments. Hanley and Wiener (1991) specified these arrange-\nments as an exogenous variable, and Sangl (1992) esti-\nmated household composition as an exogenous variable.\nKemper (1992) excluded living arrangements from the re-\ngression analysis although Kemper's (1990) model demon-\nstrated that living arrangements are an essential endogenous\nvariable. A recent study by Pezzin, Kemper, and\nReschovsky (1996) is the first published study that rectifies\nthis situation. It specifies living arrangements as an endoge-\nnous variable affecting the amount of help provided to en-\nrollees in the \"channeling\" experiment. But there is an in-\nherent weakness in findings from such experiments; as\npointed out by Kane (1988), behavior that is induced by\ntime-limited experiments is very different from behavior\nunder nonexperimental circumstances. The present study\ntreats living arrangements as an endogenous determinant of\nhelp in the community; its findings reflect behavior that can\nbe generalized to all elderly individuals needing long-term\ncare in the community.\nThis study quantifies the effects of coping resources on\nthe amount of help obtained by community-dwelling el-\nderly persons. The findings point to the pivotal roles of in-\nformal helpers and coresidence with family members in de-\ntermining the amount of in-home help received by\nchronically disabled persons. The concern for public policy\nis whether family networks can continue to provide as\nmuch help in the future; and, if they cannot, where to ob-\ntain the funds for the alternative of sufficient paid help to\nprevent unmet need for help in the community.\nConceptual Issues\nThe amount of help that disabled elderly persons can use\nis constrained by the resources at their disposal. These re-\nsources are usually accumulated at an earlier phase of the\nlife cycle; when they are drawn down because of declining\nhealth at life's end, they are not likely to be replenished.\nResources can take the forms of tangible and intangible\nwealth. Tangible wealth can be exchanged (sold) for cash or\nis available as a stream of annuitized income (e.g., Social\nSecurity benefits and employer-provided pensions). This\nwealth is based on bequest and worklife activity. Intangible\nwealth is a fund of goodwill amassed during prime years\nthrough the partnership with a spouse in marriage, the nur-\nturing of children while raising them, and by maintaining\nenduring close relationships with other relatives (siblings,\ncousins, nephews and nieces) and friends; this wealth can\nbe used more efficiently when disabled elderly persons\nshare living quarters with their helpers than if they do not.\nThe stock of tangible wealth is subject to fluctuations due to\nthe vagaries of business conditions. The stock of intangible\nwealth is also subject to fluctuations when caregivers have\ntheir own health problems or have to allocate time to other\nactivities (e.g., raising children or market work); it is wiped\nout in the case of estrangement or at the time of death. Pro-\nlonged use, due to the need for help over a long period, can\ndeplete these resources. The cost of long-term care is ex-\nplicit when paid help is purchased and the tangible wealth is\ndrawn down. The cost of unpaid help is implicit in the strain\nthat such help puts on the relationship between the helpers\nand the helped. The depletion of intangible wealth is ob-\nserved when informal caregivers stop being caregivers.\nThe regression model described below specifies the\namount (hours) of help as a function of available resources.\nThe amount of help is estimated separately for married and\nunmarried persons because marriage provides a combina-\ntion of helpers that is not available to unmarried individu-\nals. For unmarried individuals a distinction is made be-\ntween living with other adults and living alone because the\nchoice of sharing living quarters is a means to obtaining\nmore help and, therefore, is an endogenous choice. The\nequation for each subset of unmarried persons is adjusted\nfor the endogenous choices of sharing living quarters and\nreceiving more help or living alone and forgoing additional\nhelp. The difference between comparable coefficients of\nthese two subsets indicates the difference in the amount of\nreceived help due to different modes of living.\nDeterminants of Help: Needs and Resources\nThis study is based on the 1989 National Long-Term\nCare Survey (NLTCS). The survey was designed to repre-\nsent functionally limited elderly persons (ages 65+) who, in\n1989, reported needing or expecting to need assistance with\nat least one activity of daily living (ADL) or instrumental\nactivity of daily living (IADL) for a period of 3 months or\nlonger. The ADLs are listed here in the sequence in which a\nperson is likely to lose the ability to perform them without\nassistance: bathing, dressing, getting around the house, get-\nting to and using the toilet, continence, getting in and out of\nbed, and eating, a sequence that is known as the Katz scale.\nThe IADLs consist of activities that enable individuals to\nlive in the community: housework, laundry, meal prepara-\ntion, shopping for groceries, getting around outside the\nhouse, managing money, using the phone, and taking oral\nmedicine. While Katz et al. (1963 and subsequent studies)\nhave shown that the ADLs follow a sequence that forms a\nscale of accumulated disabilities, no similar scale has been\nfound for IADL disabilities. However, persons with more\nthan two ADL disabilities (i.e., with ADL disabilities in ad-\ndition to bathing and dressing) are likely to need help with\nIADLs. Since this study investigates in-home help, it is\nbased on the LTC-3 component of the NLTCS, which is a\nsample of 4,463 community-dwelling disabled elderly per-\nsons. The findings from this sample can be inferred to all\nsimilarly disabled elderly who were living in the commu-\nnity (not in nursing homes) in 1989. (A detailed description\nof this dataset is provided by Manton, Corder, and Stallard,\nThe aim of the study is to determine how the elderly use\ntheir resources to satisfy their need for help. Hence, the rel-\nevant dependent variable is the total amount of in-home\nhelp that can be obtained to meet this need. In the 1989\nNLTCS, the amount of help is measured by the number of\nhelp hours per week. The weekly hours can exceed 168\nwhen more than one helper is involved. The help needed to\nperform ADLs and IADLs is unskilled in the sense that no\nspecial training is required to be a helper. It can be secured\neither by paying dollars or by relying on family and friends.\nBoth paid and unpaid help render the same type of services\nand can equally satisfy the same kind of need. Each is pro-\ncured with different resources: Cash income and tangible\nassets are used to purchase the former; intangible wealth\nand shared living quarters are conducive to obtaining the\nlatter. Differences in the availability of resources imply dif-\nferences in the total amount of in-home help. The regres-\nsion analysis estimates the effects of coping resources\nwhile controlling for different levels of need.\nThe need for help is specified by the number of ADL dis-\nabilities and cognitive impairment. As shown by Katz et al.\n(1963), the accumulation of disabilities is positively associ-\nated with need for help. NLTCS' evaluation of cognitive\nfunction is based on the Short Portable Mental Health Sta-\ntus Questionnaire (SPMSQ), a 10-item questionnaire with\nquestions designed to measure awareness, orientation,\nshort-term memory, and problem solving. Persons with 4 or\nmore incorrect answers are considered cognitively impaired\n(Coughlin and Liu, 1989). Also, a person is assumed to be\ncognitively impaired when a proxy reports that the sample\nperson is demented or otherwise mentally disabled. A per-\nson who gives 2--3 incorrect answers is classified as border-\nline impaired.\nCash income, financial assets, and eligibility for third-\nparty payments facilitate the use of paid help and also facil-\nitate the purchase of assistive equipment. Liu, Manton, and\nLiu (1985) have demonstrated a positive correlation be-\ntween cash income and paid help in the community. Public\nsector programs such as CHAMPVA and CHAMPUS\n(which are associated with past military service) provide\npayment for long-term care and so does Medicaid. How-\never, the data for cash income and financial assets are noto-\nriously imprecise because a large number of interviewed\npersons either do not know or refuse to disclose this infor-\nmation. The data on cash income were obtained from a\nrange-card. There was no range-card for financial assets;\ntherefore, the data on financial assets could not be used for\nthe purpose of this study.\nFamily, friends, and shared living quarters are other cop-\ning resources. Availability of family helpers and helping\nfriends depends on relationships nurtured earlier in life (be-\nfore the onset of disability), as explained by Goldscheider\nThese relationships are evident in the combinations of\nhelpers shown in Table 1. The amount of help received\nfrom relatives and nonrelatives is sensitive to marital status\nand choice of living arrangements by unmarried persons.\nHaving a spouse increases the help received from the dif-\nferent combinations of helpers, suggesting that spouses\nmight be able to mobilize other helpers in addition to pro-\nviding their own help. An unmarried person who coresides\nwith other adults is likely to receive more help than a per-\nson who is living alone. Hence, marital status and the living\narrangements of unmarried persons are indicators of the re-\nsources available to cope with disability in the community.\nTable 1 presents the covariates of the regression analysis,\nthat is, the personal characteristics that determine the\namount of in-home help. These covariates are shown sepa-\nrately for married and unmarried persons. For the latter, a\nfurther distinction is made between living with others and\nliving alone. Unmarried individuals who are living with\nothers are more likely to need help than unmarried persons\nliving alone because the former are more likely to have\nADL disabilities or to be cognitively impaired. Family\nmembers constitute the main resources for obtaining help.\nThe networks of family helpers are more extensive for mar-\nried than for unmarried persons because the former can\nhave help from a spouse alone or in combination with chil-\ndren and others. The networks of family helpers are fragile\nfor persons living by themselves; one half of this group has\nno family helpers and relies solely on nonrelatives as\nhelpers. Marital status is also associated with differences in\nfinancial resources. Unmarried persons have less income\nand are less likely to own a home. To compensate for the\ndisadvantage of not being married, some unmarried persons\ncoreside with other adults. Unmarried individuals in great\nneed of help are more likely to live with others than other-\nwise similar persons with less need, who are likely to con-\ntinue living alone.\nTable 2 shows the distribution of help-hours for 3,088\npersons who reported receiving help during the week pre-\nceding the interview. Half of all help-recipients had no more\nthan 25 hours of assistance, but a small fraction of disabled\npersons absorbed a large amount of human assistance. The\nselected percentiles demonstrate that this distribution is pos-\nitively skewed with the greatest skewness observed for un-\nmarried persons coresiding with other adults. As shown in\nTable 1, this group had the highest proportion of persons\nwith three or more ADL disabilities. At each shown per-\ncentile, this group received more help than any of the other\ngroups. The least skewed is the distribution for persons liv-\ning alone, a group that had the smallest proportion of indi-\nviduals with three or more ADL disabilities; at each shown\npercentile, it received the smallest amount of help.\nResults From the Regression Analysis\nThe dependent variable is measured by the number of\nhours of help used by community-dwelling persons during\nthe week preceding their interview. Of the 4,463 sampled\nindividuals, 76.3 percent reported the number of hours\n(7.1% reported zero hours or no help and 69.2% reported a\npositive number of hours). Information on the numbers of\nhours was not recorded (NR) for the remaining 23.7 percent\nof the sample. The need for help serves as an exogenous\nproxy for deciding whether NR hours are equivalent to zero\nhours or to positive hours. The need indicators are: number\nof ADL limitations, cognitive impairment, and very old\nage. The proportions of persons having each of these char-\nacteristics are examined for the three subsets: (i) positive\nhours, (ii) zero hours, (iii) NR hours. The subsets are com-\nTable 1.

Information avail-\nable upon request shows that subset (i) differs from subset\n(ii) and from subset (iii) in that it has much higher propor-\ntions of persons who have three or more ADL disabilities,\nwho are cognitively impaired, and who are age 85 and\nolder; the differences are statistically significant at 5 per-\ncent or 1 percent levels. In contrast, the differences between\nsubsets (ii) and (iii) are smaller and are not statistically sig-\nnificant. The same pattern is found for the entire sample\nand for each of its subgroups: married, unmarried, living\nalone, or living with others; hence, NR hours are treated as\nzero hours. The dependent variable is a continuous variable\nthat is censored at zero hours.\nConceptually, the number of help hours is a variable that\ncan have both positive and negative values because a person\ncan be either a recipient or a provider of help. The observed\nhours in this sample are the ones received by elderly per-\nsons, with no help as the limit. A regression model with\nsuch a limited dependent variable is estimated as a Tobit.\nTwo Tobit equations distinguish between marital statuses\nbecause married persons can have combinations of helpers\ndifferent from unmarried individuals. Two additional Tobit\nequations distinguish between living arrangements of un-\nmarried persons because unmarried persons in great need\nfor help are more likely to coreside with other adults than\nto be living alone. Table 3 presents the Tobit results. Part A\npresents the coefficients; Part B shows the marginal effects\nof the explanatory variables on the amount of help that\nwould have been received by persons needing help (the\nlatent dependent variable), adjusted by the probability of\nreceiving help [as specified by McDonald and Moffitt\nLiving arrangements of unmarried persons with chronic\ndisabilities are specified as an endogenous determinant of\nhelp-hours. Each equation of unmarried persons is adjusted\nfor this endogeneity. For all unmarried persons, predicted\nliving arrangements are specified as an explanatory instru-\nmental variable (the identifying variables are home owner-\nship and the number of children). But the sensitivity of liv-\ning arrangements to the need for help suggests that these ar-\nrangements ought to be interacted with indicators of need.\nFurther, different modes of living can be conducive to dif-\nferent combinations of helpers. The separate equations for\npersons living alone and for persons coresiding with other\nadults interact all other determinants of help with living ar-\nrangements. Because they are based on an endogenous sort-\ning, they have to be adjusted for this sorting (selection). As\nfor endogeneity is derived from an auxiliary probit equa-\ntion (available upon request). It estimates the probability of\ncoresidence as a function of the need for help, controlling\nfor other personal characteristics that might affect this\nprobability. The probability of sharing living quarters in-\ncreases with the difficulties in physical and cognitive func-\ntioning and decreases with the use of assistive equipment. It\nis positively associated with cash income, home ownership,\nand the number of children; and sharing is more likely for\nBlacks and other non-Whites than for Whites.\nThe discussion focuses on the marginal effects of vari-\nables with statistically significant coefficients. The control\nvariables are indicators of need for help. The number of\nweekly help-hours increased consistently and substantially\nwith the number of ADL disabilities. The effects of other\nindicators of need are much smaller and less consistent.\nCognitive impairment increased the amount of help for per-\nsons sharing living quarters with other adults, and age 85+\nincreased the hours of help used by persons living alone.\nReliance on assistive equipment, when limitations in physi-\ncal and cognitive functioning are held constant, comple-\nmented human assistance (as suggested by Manton, Corder,\nThe major resources used to obtain help are the network\nof helpers, living arrangements, cash income, and third-\nparty payments. The help received from the network is not\nindependent of marital status and living arrangements. The\namount of help depends very much on the kin relationship\nbetween the helpers and the helped. The reference group\nconsists of persons whose helpers are only nonrelatives.\nThe cooperation of a spouse and children enabled an el-\nderly person to have as much as 40 more hours of help per\nweek; and married persons who relied solely on their\nspouses or only on their children had 31 and 34 additional\nhours, respectively. The unmarried had a less extensive net-\nwork and, therefore, received less help; for them, the\namount of help depended very much on living arrange-\nments. For all unmarried persons, living alone reduced help\nby 7 weekly hours compared to living with other adults.\nThe help which an unmarried parent received from his/her\nchildren amounted to 25 additional hours per week if living\nquarters were shared, and 8 additional hours if they were\nnot. But children together with others enabled unmarried\nindividuals to receive 29 additional hours if they were liv-\ning with other adults but only 10 hours if they were living\nalone. The data clearly show the pivotal role of close rela-\ntives in the network of helpers. Persons whose network did\nnot include close relatives did not have as much help as in-\ndividuals who were helped by a spouse and children; and\nsimilarly, living alone led to much less help than living\nwith a spouse or other adults.

Individuals differ in their needs as\nwell as in the level and mix of resources at their disposal,\nand these differences lead to different amounts of help\nused. Controlling for indicator of needs, this study esti-\nmates the effects of available resources on the number of\nhours of help used during a given week.\nThe distribution of help hours is very skewed. A rela-\ntively small fraction of disabled persons absorbs a large\namount of human assistance. This skewness reflects the dis-\ntribution of limitations in physical and cognitive function-\ning; only about one quarter of community-dwelling dis-\nabled elderly persons has difficulty with performing three\nor more routine activities of personal care and/or are cogni-\ntively impaired. The distribution of help-hours varies by\nliving arrangements as does the distribution of ADL dis-\nability and cognitive impairment. Unmarried persons living\nwith other adults have the most help but also a much higher\nlikelihood of being cognitively impaired and/or disabled in\nthree or more ADLs.\nThe most reliable determinants of the amount of help re-\nceived by elderly persons are the number of ADL disabili-\nties, the network of helpers, and living arrangements. The\nnumber of hours of help increases consistently with the\nnumber of ADL disabilities for different marital statuses\nand living arrangements, for men and women, and for\nWhites and non-Whites. Controlling for the effect of needs,\nmarried persons receive much more help than unmarried\nones and, among the latter, individuals coresiding with\nother adults more than those living alone. Married persons\nfare best when a spouse is joined by children as helpers; for\nunmarried individuals, the combination of children and oth-\ners is the most conducive to receiving help. None of the\nother variables that represent need (cognitive impairment\nand very advanced age) or coping resources (assistive\nequipment, cash income, and third party payments) have\nany consistent effect, and the magnitudes of their effects\nare quite small.\nOther studies have determined that the networks of fam-\nily helpers are conducive to having help at home. This\nstudy, however, differs in three aspects. First, the customary\nindicators for this network have been marital status and\nhaving children, whereas in this study, the network is speci-\nfied by various combinations of helpers. Second, this study\nmeasures the amount of help with greater precision than\nstudies that were based on earlier NLTCS, replacing fre-\nquency of contact (i.e., the number of days during which\nhelp was received) by the amount of help-time (number of\nhours). Third, this study treats living arrangements as an\nendogenous determinant of help-hours. In this respect, it\ndiffers from the earlier studies that specified modes of liv-\ning as an exogenous variable. It also differs from a recent\nstudy which specified living arrangements as an endoge-\nnous choice because the findings from that study were ob-\ntained from an experiment that was known to its partici-\npants as being time-limited, a knowledge that was likely to\naffect their behavior. The present study, which is based on a\nnational probability sample, can be generalized to all com-\nmunity-dwelling elderly persons who need long-term care;\nit determines the extent to which the number of help-hours\nused at home can be attributed to coping resources, the\nmost important of which are different combinations of\nhelpers across marital status and living arrangements.\nVariables that represent the need for help and the state-\nof-the-art technology for assistive equipment are not\namenable to any changes (including policy incentives) in\nthe short run. In the long run, as a result of biomedical re-\nsearch, appropriate prevention and medical treatments\nmight reduce the need for help, and innovations in assistive\ntechnology might lessen dependence on human assistance.\nThe levels of income and assets, which signal ability to pay\nfor help, are mostly determined by earnings during work-\nlife. The network of helpers, which depends mostly on\nhaving a spouse and adult children, is usually an outcome of\npast events. The concern for public policy is whether family\nhelp will continue to be the major source of assistance for\nlong-term disabled persons living in the community.\nThe networks of helpers are expected to change in the fu-\nture as an increasing number of elderly individuals will\nhave no spouse due to divorce, or because proportionally\nmore persons will have never been married. Childless el-\nderly individuals lack an important source of support in old\nage. Parents who, because of divorce, were absent during\nchild-rearing years may not be able to rely on help from\ntheir children. Coresidence with adult children, the most\nprevalent mode of shared living quarters by unmarried el-\nderly persons in 1989, might decline; and residence in\nboard-and-care homes or in other assisted living facilities\ncan be expected to increase (Eckert and Lyon, 1992; Kane\nand Wilson, 1993). The estimates of the amount of help re-\nceived from the informal networks suggest an order of the\nmagnitude of help that will have to be paid for when an in-\ncreasing number of elderly persons switch to living in facil-\nities that provide help for pay. The issue for public policy is\nhow to raise the funds that would support paid help in the\ncommunity for elderly individuals who do not have the\nmeans to pay for help on their own and cannot rely on the\ntraditional networks of family helpers.\n"
