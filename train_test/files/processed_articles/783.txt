The risk of thinness in relatives of obese individuals was\nsubstantially lower than in the general population.\nCONCLUSION: Because the familial risk ratio for extreme obesity is higher than for moderate levels of obesity, the\nnumber of families required to achieve adequate statistical power in gene mapping studies of obesity can be reduced\nsubstantially by focusing on family members of extremely obese individuals (BMI ! 40).\nKeywords: familial risk ratio; lambda; body mass index; obesity; linkage; family study\nIntroduction\nTraditional methods in genetic epidemiology, such as\nfamily, twin and adoption studies have identi\u00aeed\ngenetic susceptibility as a major contributing factor\nto the familial aggregation of obesity;1 these studies\nhave provided the impetus for a new area of investi-\ngation designed to map and characterize genes which\npredispose humans to be obese. The identi\u00aecation of\nsuch genes will be challenging, in large part because\nthe expression of obesity may depend on numerous\nfactors: multiple obesity-susceptibility loci (and their\npotential interactions), reduced penetrance and envir-\nonmental variables such as availability of a calorically\ndense diet. Several segregation studies report results\nthat are consistent with major gene in\u00afuence on\nobesity.1,2,3 Although some genes eventually may be\nfound to have large effects on some obesity pheno-\ntypes in humans, already more than 70 genes or\nchromosome regions have been implicated as having\nsome role in obesity in humans or animal models.4\nThe dif\u00aeculties facing studies designed to identify\nobesity-susceptibility genes in humans are evident\nfrom the inconsistencies in results across studies.\nDifferences may be due to:\n(1) actual locus heterogeneity (for example, differ-\nent genes or combinations of genes leading to\nobesity in different populations);\n(2) inadequate statistical power to detect poly-\ngenic loci with small effects (high rates of false\nnegatives);\n(3) low prior probability that any particular gene will\nhave a measurable effect in a particular sample\n(high rates of false positives) or\n(4) environmental heterogeneity (for example,\ndifferences in exposure to risk and protective\nfactors).\nFurthermore, it has been shown that replication of\nsusceptibility loci for a complex trait requires a longer\nperiod of time (for example, a larger sample size) than\nthe initial detection of linkage.5\nGiven these challenges facing linkage studies of\nobesity, it is necessary to employ a study design that\nmaximizes the feasibility of localizing obesity-sus-\nceptibility loci and that allows for replication of those\n\u00aendings. Risch6 has shown that, for both monogenic\nand polygenic traits, models of inheritance can be\nexamined by computing a risk ratio, which compares\nthe prevalence of a trait in relatives with the preva-\nlence of the trait in the population.

It is clear that prevalence of\nmoderate levels of obesity in families ascertained\nthrough an extremely obese member is high;7,8 how-\never, the speci\u00aec familial and population rates have\nnot been reported and it has been unclear whether the\nprevalence of extreme obesity in relatives increases as\nthe obesity in the proband increases. In this paper, we\ndetermined obesity risk ratios using a sample ascer-\ntained through extremely obese probands and consid-\nered practical implications for selecting obesity\nthresholds for a linkage study.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nWe recruited members of the National Association to\nAdvance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA). We asked mem-\nbers to provide height and weight for themselves and\nfor their \u00aerst-degree relatives. The members of\nNAAFA were mostly female, Caucasian and college\neducated. A detailed description of the participants\nhas been reported previously.8\nObesity index\nWe used body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) as an index\nof obesity.\nAge and gender standardization of obesity prevalence\nand risk ratios\nTo compute age and gender standardized prevalence\nrates,9 we created six categories: three age categories\nthen applied an equal weight of 1/6 to the prevalence\nrate for each age\u00b1gender category to standardize the\nage distribution in the two populations. The weighted,\nage\u00b1gender speci\u00aec prevalence rates for all \u00aerst-\ndegree relatives (parents and siblings) of NAAFA\nprobands were totaled and compared with those\nobtained from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) data. In our analysis,\nwe restricted the NHANES group to the Caucasian\nsubjects who enrolled in the \u00aerst phase of NHANES\nIII and were examined in mobile examination clinics\nbecause they were ascertained at the comparable time\nRisk ratios were calculated by dividing the age and\ngender standardized obesity prevalence rates in the\nrelatives of probands, by the age and gender standar-\ndized obesity prevalence rates in the NHANES III\nsubjects, yielding a standardized risk ratio (SRR).\nStandard errors were approximated by 1/b[(p(1 7 p)/\nn], where b is the baseline risk of reaching the obesity\nthreshold in the population, p is the proportion of\nrelatives who reached the threshold, and n is the total\nnumber of relatives in the group. To compute standard\nerrors, we assumed family members are independent\nand the prevalence rates from the NHANES data are\nconstants. Con\u00aedence intervals based on the approxi-\nmated standard errors are anti-conservative and\nshould be considered minimal.\nGrouping probands by body mass index (BMI)\nthresholds to compute standardized risk ratios\nWe grouped proband BMI in two ways. We \u00aerst used\nthree ascending, non-overlapping thresholds of obe-\ndetermine whether the risk of obesity in relatives\nincreases with the obesity of the proband (Interval\nmethod). We then used three ascending overlapping\nthresholds of proband obesity (BMI ! 30, BMI ! 40\nand BMI ! 45) to assess the overall impact on study\ndesign of ascertaining families through probands\nexceeding various obesity thresholds (Threshold\nmethod). We used these thresholds to de\u00aene obesity\nin the relatives as well. The thresholds correspond to\npopulation, respectively, and denote moderate to\nextreme levels of obesity.\nCalculation of standardized risk ratios for thinness\nWe computed age and gender speci\u00aec SRR for thin-\nness in relatives (BMI 20) to determine if thinness\nin relatives was negatively correlated with the degree\nof obesity in the proband. Less than 8% of the general\nadult population has BMI 20.\nAccuracy of self-reported BMI\nFor a subset of probands (n  11) and their relatives\n(n  30), we measured their height and weight to\nassess the accuracy of informant's reported values.\nWe computed a Pearson's correlation coef\u00aecient\nbetween the measured and reported values for heights\nand weights.\nResults\nOf the 2444 questionnaires given to NAAFA subjects,\n981 (39%) were completed and returned. Respondents\nwere excluded from further analysis if they were\nadopted, male or had a BMI ` 30. The remaining\n840 respondents (probands) provided information on\ntheir 2349 relatives. We restricted our analysis to\nrelatives whose ages ranged between 20 and 74 y to\nmatch subjects in the NHANES sample.\nAge\u00b1gender standardized prevalence rates of obesity\namong the relatives of extremely obese women vs the\ngeneral population: Grouping probands by BMI interval\nThe range of obesity thresholds familial risk ratios of\nobesity in the \u00aerst-degree relatives increased with\nRisk ratios for extreme obesity\nJH Lee et al\ndegree of obesity in the probands (Figure 1).

Moderate levels of\nobesity (BMI ! 30) were common in the general\npopulation; however, in the families of extremely\nobese women, the prevalence rates of obesity were\napproximately twice as high as that in the general\nobesity threshold to BMI ! 40 in the relatives of the\nextremely obese women resulted in a more than \u00aeve-\nfold increase in the prevalence rates of obesity com-\npared with the rate in the general population (11.8\u00b1\nthreshold was used (BMI ! 45), the prevalence rates\nwere nearly eight times that of the general population\nFigure 1 Age and gender standardized risk ratios (SRRs),\ncomparing the prevalence rates of obesity in relatives of pro-\nbands with extreme obesity vs the rates in the population.

The net effect\nis a systematic underreporting of BMI that would have\nlittle effect on the placement of individuals in the BMI\nthreshold categories.\nDiscussion\nThe familial risk ratio for obesity increased approxi-\nmately linearly with the probands' BMI, and the risk\nof extreme obesity in relatives of extremely obese\nprobands (BMI ! 40) was more than \u00aeve-fold higher\nthan in the general population. Selecting families\nthrough extremely obese probands with BMI ! 40\nappears to provide a balance between the competing\nneeds of gene mapping studies: a high familial risk\nratio and a suf\u00aeciently high population prevalence to\nmake family ascertainment feasible.\nRisk ratios and statistical power in obesity gene\nmapping\nRisch12 extended the work of James13 and proposed\nthat the recurrence risk in relatives (approximated by\nSRR in this paper) conveniently provides an estimate\nfor statistical power to detect linkage in studies\ninvolving affected relative pairs. Our \u00aendings support\nthe usefulness of the l in genetic studies of obesity.\nIt is possible to maximise the ef\u00aeciency of a gene\nmapping study design by concentrating on probands\nwith extreme obesity (BMI ! 40). Risch6 has sug-\ngested that for phenotypic traits with risk ratios b 5,\nthe potential exists for a large proportion of the trait\nvariation to be accounted for by a major gene. For a l\nof 5.0, 186 sib pairs are needed to detect linkage\n(assuming two genes contributing equally and addi-\n(polymorphism information content14) of 0.8, markers\n10 cM apart); however, for a l of 2.5, more than twice\nas many pairs are needed to generate comparable\nlevels of statistical power.12 Therefore, selecting\npairs of relatives with higher familial risk ratios\nincreased the statistical power to detect linkage.\nAllison et al15 applied the l statistic to \u00aene gene\nmapping in obesity to determine the required sample\nsize to localize putative genes. Using the data from\npublished and simulation studies, the authors con-\ncluded that ls for milder forms of obesity were\ndisappointingly low. This observation led to the pre-\ndiction that an impractically large number of sibling\npairs would be necessary to achieve adequate statis-\ntical power to detect linkage for obesity related genes.\nIn the current study, we examine ways to improve\nstatistical power in obesity linkage studies. We\nshowed that the statistical power can be increased\nby studying family members with extreme obesity\n(BMI ! 40). If one posits a \u00aeve gene model (assuming\n\u00aeve genes contributing equally and additively, mar-\nkers 10 cM apart and PIC of 0.8), with a familial risk\nratio of 5.0, approximately 569 affected sibling pairs\nwould be needed to detect linkage at 80% power at a\nthough these numbers are large, they represent sig-\nni\u00aecantly smaller sample sizes than those required\nwhen families with more modest levels of obesity are\nascertained.\nAlthough the bene\u00aets of studying more extremely\naffected probands and their families are straightfor-\nward, the rarity of the subjects make them dif\u00aecult to\nrecruit; therefore, a balance has to be achieved\nbetween the decreased need to recruit large numbers\nof subjects and the increased effort needed to ascertain\nindividuals with more extreme phenotypes. To illus-\ntrate this point, we employed an analysis similar to\nthat used by Todorov et al17 and found the costs of\nscreening and ascertaining a family doubles as the\nminimum proband BMI is raised from 40 to 45. Thus,\nselecting families through probands with BMI ! 40\nappears to be the best compromise.\nThe method of examining extremely discordant\nsibling pairs has been advocated as a powerful\nmethod to map genes for complex traits,16 but it\nmay be a dif\u00aecult analytical method for obesity\nFigure 2 Age and gender standardized risk ratios (SRRs), com-\nparing the prevalence rates of obesity in relatives of probands\nwith extreme obesity vs the population prevalence rates of\nobesity. Ascending overlapping thresholds of obesity of body\nmass index (BMI) (kg/m2) were used to de\u00aene moderate to\nextreme levels of obesity in the \u00aerst-degree relatives (Threshold\nmethod). Thinness in relatives was de\u00aened as BMI 20.\nRisk ratios for extreme obesity\nJH Lee et al\nwhen extremely obese probands are ascertained.18 In\naddition to the relative scarcity of subjects with a\nBMI ! 40, the likelihood that such subjects will have\na thin family member is lower than one would expect,\nbased upon population rates. For extremely obese\nprobands, the probability of having a thin \u00aerst-\ndegree relative (BMI 20), was nearly half the gen-\neral population prevalence rate and this further adds to\nthe dif\u00aeculty of subject recruitment for sibling pairs\nwith extremely discordant BMIs. Without thin sib-\nlings, however, families become less informative to\ndetect linkage. As recently suggested, it may be\npossible to overcome some of these inherent dif\u00aecul-\nties by raising the threshold for thin relatives to the\nThe familial risk ratio provides a heritability index\nfor traits, and it assumes the shared family environ-\nment has a negligible in\u00afuence on the familial aggre-\ngation of the trait. This assumption, as it pertains to\nobesity, has been comprehensively reviewed by Grilo\nand Pogue-Geile,20 who concluded that shared family\nenvironment has little, if any, effect on the aggrega-\ntion of obesity within families. So to the extent that\nfamilial risk ratios give accurate estimates of genetic\nsusceptibility, our data demonstrate that extreme obe-\nsity is more heritable than moderate levels of obesity.\nThis conclusion is further supported by the work of\nLaskarzewski et al,21 who compared the rates of\nobesity among families of probands in the upper and\nlower tertiles of weight-for-height and found the rates\nof obesity to be much higher in the families with an\nobese proband. MacLean and Rhode22 also observed\nan increased risk of obesity in relatives of patients\nwith extreme obesity by comparing the proportion of\nproband families that have any relative with BMI ! 40\nagainst control families (odds ratio  24.5; 95% CI,\nis family rather than individual, it is not a reasonable\nestimator of l.\nWe ascertained families with extreme obesity\nthrough members of NAAFA which led to an ascer-\ntainment of probands which are over 90% female.\nAlthough we restricted our analysis to relatives of\nfemale probands, we included both male and female\nrelatives of female probands. The familial risk ratios\nin female relatives are comparable to those in male\nrelatives (data not shown). Because extreme obesity is\nless common in men than in women, we predict that\nfamilial risk ratios would be higher than the observed\nfamilial risk ratios if we had ascertained male pro-\nbands, selected for comparable BMI values and their\nrelatives.\nAccuracy of reported BMI\nWe used reported values of heights and weights,\nrather than measured values. Several studies have\nshown that self-reported values of heights and weights\nof families, we compared the reported values of\nheights and weights against the measured values,\nand found the correlation to be reasonably high.\nAs expected, we observed a systematic bias in\nthat respondents underreport BMI. If the results\ncan be generalized to all subjects in our study,\nthe actual risk in \u00aerst-degree relatives should be\nhigher than the estimated risk based on the reported\nConclusion\nWe observed that the risk of obesity in relatives\nincreased proportionally with the proband BMI, with\nmore extremely obese probands having relatives with\nmore extreme phenotypes. These results suggest that\ngenetic in\u00afuences are stronger in extreme obesity than\nin moderate levels of obesity. In genetic studies of\nobesity, statistical power can be increased by ascer-\ntaining families through probands with extreme obe-\nsity, with a BMI ! 40 providing a good balance\nbetween a high familial risk ratio and a high enough\npopulation prevalence to make family recruitment\nfeasible. Because the prevalence of thinness was low\nin relatives of extremely obese probands, the extreme\ndiscordant sibling pair method may require raising the\nthreshold for thin relatives.\n"
