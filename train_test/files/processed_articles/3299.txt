A critical analysis\nof how this information is covered is necessary to determine whether there is need for change of style in the presentation\nof this information . This is so because till date, there exists a gap in literature on how preventive knowledge on HIV is\npresented in the Kenyan print media. The data for this paper was gathered using both quantitative and qualitative designs.\nThe paper relied mainly on the content analysis methodology in which the Daily Nation newspapers were searched for articles\non HIV. The Daily Nation was purposively studied for this paper because it has the largest selling publication with the highest\ncirculation and therefore, can adequately represent Kenya's newspapers. All the issues of the year 2010 were purposively\nstudied and this yielded a total of 365 copies for this paper. Findings of this paper indicate that the print media in Kenya lack\nconsistency in the coverage of HIV issues. They also lack a clear editorial policy on the coverage of the epidemic that could\nguide in a sustained and effective method of coverage of the epidemic. Prominence of the HIV articles, which is a very crucial\naspect in coverage, is also found to be lacking. This paper recommends that the print media should focus on consistency in\ntheir coverage... It is The print media should involve the general public, including people living with HIV in the discussion of\nthe epidemic.\n",

The disease has not\nspared any country. It has affected both rich and poor coun-\ntries (Ndambuki, McCretton, Rider, Gichuru, & Wildish,\nThe first AIDS case in Kenya was diagnosed in 1984. In\n1985, the government established the National AIDS\nCommittee to advise the Ministry of Health in Kenya (MOH)\non matters related to HIV control. In 1986, the MOH formu-\nlated policy statements and guidelines on safe blood supply.\nThe First Medium Term Plan was developed in 1987.\nAlthough the highest rates of infection were initially concen-\ntrated in marginalized and special risk groups, for more than\na decade Kenya has faced a mixed HIV epidemic; new infec-\ntions occurred in the general population and vulnerable,\nhigh-risk groups. In 1999, the Government of Kenya (GOK)\ndeclared the HIV epidemic a national disaster and estab-\nlished the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) to coor-\ndinate the multisectoral response to HIV.\nThe GOK responded by publishing informative articles in\nthe press and launching a poster campaign urging people to\nuse condoms and avoid indiscriminate sex. Since then, HIV\nprevalence has been found to be highest among a number of\ngroups, such as sex workers, injecting drug users (IDUs),\nmen who have sex with men (MSM), truck drivers, and\ncross-border mobile populations. Up to one third of new\ninfections in 2008 were within these \"key populations at\nhigher risk.\"\nPrevalence Rates and HIV Knowledge\nand Behavior\nAccording to the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS;\nDemographic Health Survey (KDHS; 2009) estimated prev-\nalence in the same population at 6.2%.

HIV and AIDS educa-\ntion is an essential part of HIV prevention. In Kenya, HIV\neducation is part of the curriculum in both primary and\nsecondary schools, and for a number of years, Kenya has\ndelivered educational campaigns to raise nationwide\nawareness of the issue. As a result, awareness about HIV\nand AIDS in Kenya is high.\nvention methods is high: 75% of women and 81% of men\naged 15 to 49 know that use of condoms can reduce the risk\nof getting AIDS virus, and 92% of women and 93% of men\nknow that abstinence or limiting sexual intercourse to only\none uninfected partner reduces chance of getting HIV.

Research across more severely affected, low-income\ncountries clearly demonstrates that HIV is the most serious\nimpediment to economic growth and development in such\ncountries; there is no reason to expect Kenya to be an excep-\ntion (Kenya National Aids strategic Plan [KNASP]\nMedia and HIV Prevention\nThe media has the social responsibility to ensure that infor-\nmation relating to HIV is on the public domain. To achieve\nthis responsibility, journalists should strive to write clearly\nand objectively on the subject.\nThe choice of the print media and particularly the Daily\nNation for this paper was informed by the fact that portable\nmedia can be carried away and used later. This enables the\naudience to repeat and review the messages, hence, reinforc-\ning their behavior change. Behavioral models in the print\nmedia may become more influential by virtue of the media\nthemselves, which appear to have a status-conferred function\nfor information sources in popular news and entertainment\nKenya's AIDS epidemic depends on a number of factors,\nwhich include HIV-related knowledge among the general\npopulation, social stigmatization, risk behavior modification,\naccess to quality health care and services for sexually trans-\nmitted infections, provision and uptake of HIV counseling\nand testing, and access to care and antiretroviral therapy,\nincluding prevention and treatment of opportunistic infec-\ntions. In collaboration with various stakeholders, the Kenya\nNational Aids Strategic Plan III (KNASP III), which was\nlaunched in January 2010. Although HIV prevalence seems\nto have stabilized, new HIV infections have been estimated\nvention of new infections, reduction of HIV-related illnesses\nand death, and mitigation of the effects of the epidemic on\nhouseholds and communities.\nThe awareness of HIV is universal with 99% of women\ngroup for which the level of awareness of AIDS falls below\n98% is women and men with the lowest wealth quintile. The\nThe success of AIDS prevention and control programs\nworldwide depends on the ability of information, education,\nand communication (IEC) interventions to address this issue\nand establish norms of safe sex that are acceptable to (and\nfeasible for) sexually active populations. Therefore, one of\nthe prerequisites to the development of effective interven-\ntions will be a sound understanding of the dominant patterns\nof sexuality around the world and in different cultures and\nsubcultures (Carballo, Cleland, Carael, & Albretch, 1989).\nKnowledge and information are the first lines of defense\nfor the young people (UNAIDS, 2004). The use of the media\nis driven by the recognition that the media can help in reach-\ning those whose status is negative and encourage them to\nretain this status, to support those whose status is positive\nand urge them to be careful so as not to spread the virus and\nto maintain hope through positive living, and in general, to\neducate society as a whole to develop sustainable structures\nthat will contribute to the prevention and effective manage-\nment of HIV.\nA key strength of the media in this sense is their agenda\nsetting capacity. They can sustain a topic for long in the pub-\nlic arena and therefore, extensive discussion that supports\nsome action in a given topic (Kiai, 2000). Other functions of\nMogambi et al. 3\nthe media with regard to HIV include providing accurate and\nfactual information on HIV on a regular basis, humanizing\nthe statistics and demystifying the epidemic, presenting the\npublic opinion of the disease, educating the public on the\nneed for community-based structures in HIV prevention and\nmanagement, and presenting a holistic picture of HIV as well\nas advocating for accountability and responsibility in the\nHIV prevention and management sector.\nThis paper sought to investigate the role that the mass\nmedia and particularly the print media have played in the\ndissemination of information concerning HIV in Kenya. In\ndoing so, the paper also sought to determine the prominence\ngiven to this information by one of Kenya's mainstream\nnewspapers (Daily Nation) in terms of coverage.\nNewspaper Readership in Kenya\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Nation Media Group\nSince 2000, a slight improvement has been noted for those\nwho read newspapers daily. The research revealed that daily\npeople (75%) consider the media as a source of credible\ninformation.\nThe Daily Nation Newspaper\nThe Daily Nation newspaper is seen as the most influential\nof all the newspapers in Kenya. \"It is widely regarded as\nbeing independent and balanced\". It is the largest newspaper\nnot only in Kenya but in the whole of East Africa. Its circula-\ntion is above 200,000 copies per day but as copies are often\nread by many people, the actual readership is much higher. It\nhas a market share of about 75%. The biggest competitor of\nthe Daily Nation is The Standard, published by the Standard\nGroup.\nThe Daily Nation is a morning newspaper published on\nall 7 days of the week, available in all major cities in East\nAfrica. The Saturday version is called Saturday Nation while\nthe Sunday version is known as Sunday Nation. Its offices\nare located at Kimathi Street in the Nairobi Central Business\nDistrict.\nThe Daily Nation also maintains a website, nation.co.ke,\nwhich publishes many articles from the newspaper and has\nmore than three million daily page viewers. The website and\nits archives are accessible free of charge.\nUse of Media Messages in Combating\nHIV in Kenya\nSince the early 1990s, surveys have indicated that in many\nareas of the African continent, widespread awareness of HIV\ncoexists along with highly skewed detailed knowledge. The\ndemographic and health surveys conducted during the 1990s\nin Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia showed that knowledge of\nthe disease was almost universal, but very few people were\naware of or believed in the protection offered by condoms\n(Caldwell, 1999). This paper therefore looks into the possi-\nble reasons for the lack of effectiveness in the media mes-\nsages in disseminating information on HIV.\nScholars have increasingly documented the need to\nincrease awareness on HIV among people. Ndeti (2004,\n2012) posits that adolescents require more information on all\naspects of HIV, including skills of protecting themselves\nfrom infection, resisting peer pressure, being assertive and\nnegotiating for safer sex. Although this paper focuses on the\nkind of information that needs to be included by the media in\nthe fight against the epidemic, it does not address the equally\nimportant issue of how this information should be presented\nto the target audience to ensure its effectiveness.\nIEC\nResearch has shown that IEC approaches are highly effective\nin increasing knowledge on HIV but they have minimal\nimpacts on behavior changes (Wyss, 2001). Based on this\nand the fact that the mass media effects in developing coun-\ntries is not well documented, this paper examined the print\nmedia messages in combating HIV in Kenya with a view of\nlooking at how they are presented, the prominence given to\nthem, and the frequency with which they occur in the\ndailies.\nThe impact of IEC on behavioral changes may be less\nstrong, and experiences from several industrialized countries\nhave shown improvements in levels of HIV-related knowl-\nedge following mass media campaigns, but limited effect on\nbehavior. This paper therefore sought to find out if journal-\nists use IEC messages in the print media and the limitations\nthat they have. It also sought to suggest ways in which these\nlimitations, if any, could be addressed to make them effective\nin causing behavior change among the audience.\nEffects of Mass Media Health\nCampaigns in Developing Countries\nKenya is one of the developing countries in which print\nmedia campaigns in the fight against HIV has not been well\ndocumented. The media have a pivotal role to play in com-\nbating HIV. It is often said that education is the vaccine\nagainst HIV. Research shows that some countries have been\nusing the media in combating HIV. It has also been observed\nthat the mass media messages are an important source of\nknowledge regarding HIV, but that this knowledge is inade-\nquate, and often contains misconceptions (Wyss, 2001).\nSalmon andAtkins (2003) argue that health campaigns have\na long, well-established, and respected heritage as an apparatus\nfor promoting public health and welfare. This phenomenon\nhas, however, not been witnessed in Kenya despite the pres-\nence of print media, which can be effectively used to influence\n4 SAGE Open\nbehavior changes. The Daily Nation newspaper for instance\ncan be effectively used in HIV prevention campaign owing to\nits national outlook in terms of coverage and readership.\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO; 2006),\nmost governments have turned to the mass media as a means\nof informing their population, shaping social norms and\ninfluencing behavior associated with the transmission of\nHIV. Torwell and Rodney (2010) affirm that the mass media\nplay a central role in informing the public about health and\nmedical issues. They further say that the print media, particu-\nlarly newspapers, have been found to be an effective media\nfor influencing the general public as well as opinion leaders\non issues of public health.\nIt is also acknowledged that newspapers are best suited\nfor explanations and in-depth analysis because of the length\nallowed for in print and the relative ease of access. Collins,\nAbelson, Pyman, and Lavis (2006) recognized print news as\nan integral source of public policy information as well as a\nmedium to persuade public opinion, depending on selection\nand presentation of issues (Torwell & Rodney, 2010).\nPresentation of HIV Information in the\nPrint Media\nThe way in which information on HIV is presented in print\nmedia to the audience matters a lot if it has to be effective in\nbehavior change. Doak, Doak, Fredel, and Meade (1998) sug-\ngested a number of strategies for effectively presenting\nprinted information to people with low health literacy. These\nstrategies are as follows: only give advice that is immediately\nessential, divide the information into easy-to-understand\nparts, include visual images with each information part, put\nall information in the appropriate context, make instructions\ninteractive, offer visual examples, use testimonials, use active\nvoice and conversational style, use bullets to organize infor-\nmation, and use friendly content that is appealing and cultur-\nally appropriate. If these strategies are adopted by the print\nmedia in Kenya, many positive changes will be brought about\nin combating HIV. This paper therefore sought to find out the\nway in which information on HIV is presented and suggest\nways in which journalists can improve in the presentation of\nthis information.\nSome of the ways in which information can be presented\nto the audience in the print media is through using entertain-\nment columns. In this way, audience will find it more inter-\nesting. Singh (2011) argues that media is capable of\npreventing HIV with an ultimate goal to cure it through its\ncapabilities to impart education through entertainment. This\ncan be effectively used by the Daily Nation Newspaper in its\nentertainment columns.\nContribution by Other Stakeholders\nTo complement the work of journalists in their work of\nreporting on HIV and AIDS, other stakeholders, such as\nscientists, physicians, public officials, and nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs) are also important. By increasing pub-\nlic awareness, it may also elicit the support that is essential to\nbring risks under control (Jha et al., 2001).\nPrevention Efforts\nAlthough better ways of keeping people with HIV infec-\ntion alive and well were sought, efforts must be intensified\nto prevent any further spread of the virus. Prevention is the\nkey to curtailing the ultimate impact of AIDS. Perhaps, the\nmain lesson learned so far during this pandemic is that\nsexual behavior change is an achievable goal. There is\ngrowing evidence that people from striking diverse cul-\ntures on different continents have managed to adopt safer\nbehaviors, such as having fewer sex partners, choosing\nnonpenetrative forms of sex, and, the best documented,\nCarefully crafted messages by the print media need to\nreach the general public so as to ensure truly universal edu-\ncation about HIV. However, these behavioral interventions\nhave hardly been implemented in Kenya, and where they\nhave been, they are on far too limited a scale to make a real\nimpact on the pandemic.\nSources of Information on HIV\nSources from which information on HIV are obtained is an\nimportant factor to be considered by the journalists when\nthey cover stories. It has been argued by different scholars\nthat because of the complexities surrounding the HIV issues,\njournalists require a wide array of information sources to\nprovide quotes, background information, explanation of\ncomplex aspects or technical details, useful suggestions and\nleads, new findings or other news, and even contact with\nother sources (Miller & Williams, 1998).\nDifferent sources bring different values to the news on\nHIV. One of the most important sources of information is\nPLWHIV. This is because they are in an advantaged position\nto tell their HIV stories. Therefore, involving PLWHIV as\nthe sources of stories would help make the information more\npragmatic in fighting the epidemic. This will increase the\neffectiveness of the messages in influencing behavior change\nin the targeted audiences.\nical need to address the HIV problem is reflected in the Sixth\nMillenium development Goals (MDG), which seeks to halt\nand begin to reverse the spread of HIV by 2015, and to make\naccess to treatment for HIV universal for all those who need\nit. This fundamental goal can be best achieved by increasing\nawareness of HIV issues such as prevention ways, in which\nit can be transmitted among other issues through the print\nmedia.\nBarnett and Whiteside (2006) argue that the relative role\nof information, observation, and instruction are important for\nMogambi et al. 5\nHIV prevention programs, their design, and understanding of\nwhy they have succeeded or failed. They further say that\ninformation-based decisions are grounded on messages and\nthe theory of reasoned action and planned behavior rather\nthan experience or observation.\nUse of Different Media in Carrying\nInformation on HIV\nA few countries have been successful in the use of media in\nthe dissemination of information on HIV. Uganda is often\nheld up as a model for Africa in the fight against the epi-\ndemic. This success can be attributed to several factors,\nwhich include strong government leadership, broad-based\npartnerships, and effective public education campaigns.\nUgandan experts believe that the simple act of talking has\nmade profound difference to the course of the country's epi-\ndemic. The fact that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni\nallowed a free discussion on HIV in the media, among orga-\nnizations and the civil society is cited as a key element of the\ncountry's success in reversing the epidemic (UNAIDS,\n2004). Other countries such as Kenya can also adopt the\nsame strategy of increasing the role of the print media. This\nis because the print media has the potential of providing a\nplatform for important discussions by media personalities,\nmedical experts, public officials, and the public.\nThailand is another country which has recorded declining\ntrends of HIV infection. This is a demonstration that the pan-\ndemic beats a retreat in the face of determined and sustained\nmassive efforts in generating awareness among people and\nempowering people with information to combat it effectively.\nVisibility in the media, and informed and sympathetic visibility\nat that, is an effective step toward creating greater awareness.\nLeaders of the media, in cooperation with other segments of the\nsociety, can play a significant role in educating public opinion.\nIn the United States of America, the media has been used\nsuccessfully to dispel myths which had long been held about\nthe epidemic. It was, for instance, believed that Aids was a\ndisease for the gays. When studies began to suggest that het-\nerosexual transmission could take place through sex work-\ners, the press responded by increasing coverage (Nelkin,\n1991). The Kaiser's National Surveys have also confirmed\nthat the media in the United States are one of the most impor-\ntant resources for information for Americans on HIV--the\nmedia are named more often than health care providers or\nschools (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 2004)\nIn Russia, the Russian Media Partnership to combat HIV\n(RMP)--a group of more than 30 media and communica-\ntions partners, including TV networks, print partners, radio\nnetworks, and online companies was formed. The partner-\nship launched Russia's first coordinated public education\ncampaign, STOPSPID (Stop AIDS), on World AIDS Day,\nIn Tanzania, the Radio Tanzania soap opera Twende na\nWakati (Let's Go With the Times), which was first broadcast\nin 1993, greatly increased listeners' willingness to discuss\nissues related to the virus. After the program had been aired\nfor several seasons a survey reported that 65% of the respon-\ndents said they had spoken to someone about Twende na\nWakati and more than 8 in 10 reported having adopted a HIV\nprevention measure as a result of listening to the show\nBenefo (2004) concurs with the argument that mass media\ncan be effective in combating HIV. He states that conveying\nHIV information in the mass media has done a great deal to\nteach Ghanaians about the disease. He goes on to say that it\nhas raised awareness of the importance of using condoms\nand partner fidelity and has made fidelity in sexual relations\nand condom use to be seen as feasible and likely behavioral\nresponses to the epidemic.\nWhat this means is that the print media in Kenya can,\ntherefore, be used effectively in the fight against the epi-\ndemic if it forms partnerships and come up with programs\ndesigned to prevent transmission of the HIV virus.\nIssues\nFrom the review of literature, this paper found out several\nissues which need to be addressed. First, most of the scholars\nconcur that the print media is an invaluable tool in the dis-\nsemination of information on HIV (Doak et al., 1998; Singh,\nagainst HIV do not seem to have taken the role of the print\nmedia seriously in the fight against HIV. Instead, they have\nfocused more on areas such as Voluntary Counseling and\nTesting (VCT), provision and distribution of condoms, and\nprovision of antiretroviral treatment for persons living with\nAIDS, among other interventions. Despite the fact that all\nthese measures are important, the government, NGOs, and\nother stakeholders in the fight against the AIDS pandemic\nshould also incorporate the use of print media in the dissemi-\nnation of HIV information to the public. This is because the\nmedia is capable of preventing HIV transmission through its\ncapabilities to impart education through entertainment.\nA review of literature also showed that in areas where the\ngovernment and other stakeholders have made an attempt to\nuse the mass media in the fight against the pandemic, very\nlittle regard is given to the way in which this information is\ncovered. This has a lot of implications on the efforts to com-\nbat the epidemic as it touches on several issues among them\nbeing the credibility of the sources of information on HIV in\nthe print media, the amount of information on HIV covered\nthe frequency of coverage, as well as the style of presentation\nof this information in the newspapers.\nShortcomings of the Print Media in\nCombating HIV\nDespite their potentially effective role in combating HIV, the\nprint media in Kenya have some shortcomings. These include\n6 SAGE Open\nthe profit orientation of most media houses, which lead them\nto focus on sensationalism, even in health topics, to increase\nsales. Real public health issues therefore get very little cov-\nerage. There is also lack of in-depth analysis that can help\ncommunities to act on their health concerns as most stories\ntend to give only general information to people. Journalists\nshould analyze health issues rather than just reporting them\nroutinely. There also exists a huge gap between health offi-\ncials, researchers, and the print media. Some media houses,\nfor instance, are accused of relying more on politicians rather\nthan health officials who would provide them with accurate,\ncomprehensible, and credible information on HIV.\nReporters were also found to lack specialization and clear\nunderstanding of issues relating to HIV, which causes them\nto distort information sometimes with catastrophic results.\nFor example, it is argued that Kenyan journalists still refer to\nPLWHIV as victims (African Woman and Child Feature\nService). The media could therefore address this issue by hir-\ning professional science editors who can report competently\non the subject of HIV.\nIt also emerged that the print media in Kenya still lacks\ninnovativeness in developing stories that can lead to behav-\nior change. They simply provide information, which does not\nnecessarily target specific populations at greater risk of\ninfection such as the youth, women, commercial sex workers\n(CSWs) among others.\nOther factors external to the workings of the media which\nnevertheless negatively affect the media in combating HIV\nare denial, stigma, and discrimination. In addition to strength-\nening the stigma, discrimination keeps many from seeking\ninformation or help if they are infected, these beliefs pro-\nmote denial, allowing many in society to distance themselves\nfrom the realities of the epidemic, and therefore, to be lulled\ninto a false sense of security.\nSampling Procedures\nAll newspapers for the period under review were searched\nfor articles on HIV. The reviewed newspaper has daily and\nweekend editions. There was no categorization in this\nsense because all the newspapers within this period were\nsearched, irrespective of the day on which they were pub-\nlished. Using this method, therefore, the researchers\nsearched all the newspapers in the year under the paper for\ninformation on HIV. This information was in the form of\nnews items, opinions, editorials, features, letters to the edi-\ntor, magazines, and research reports among others that had\nsubjects touching on HIV. The subjects of this information\nincluded but were not limited to new medical discoveries,\ngovernment policies regarding HIV, financial assistance\ntoward fight against HIV, views of PLWHIV, religious per-\nspectives, and any other issue concerning HIV. Any daily\nor weekend edition of the newspaper with information on\nHIV was included in the sample. Those which did not have\ninformation on HIV were also part of the count. The\neditorial policy of the newspaper was analyzed to give an\nidea of the influence it might have on the writing on the\nsubject. Senior editors and writers explained about edito-\nrial policy of the newspaper on such issues like HIV and\neffects on writing about the subject, which illuminated on\nthe data collected quantitatively.\nData Analysis and Presentation\nThis research sought to analyze articles on HIV issues during\nthe specified period (January 1st to December 31st) in Kenya\nappearing in the Daily Nation newspaper. In this respect the\nfollowing aspects were analyzed and coded accordingly. The\nunit of analysis was an individual story (news story, feature,\nand editorial, letter to editor or commentary) whose content\nwas be examined in terms of\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Number of articles,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Their size (in cm2),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Type (whether news, Opinion, feature, editorial, book\nreview, letter to editor, or advertisement),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Placement (front page, page 2, page 3, other inside\npages, special feature/magazine section, or back\npage),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Prominence (edition lead, page lead, main editorial, or\nspecial commentary),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Main event (or occasion)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Main actor (Government, NGO, the United Nations\nsystem, PLWHIV), and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Main subject.\nThe table (the main research instrument) was designed in\nsuch a way as to ensure flawless entry of the data into a\nmicrocomputer for analysis. The subsequent data aggrega-\ntion and analysis was done using the SPSS computer soft-\nware and involved mainly charts to indicate associations and\ndifferences in the treatment of HIV stories by the Daily\nNation newspaper.\nFindings\nThe researchers used content analysis to collect data for this\npaper. First, the process involved selecting a sample of 365\ncopies of Daily Nation newspapers. Once the researchers\nselected a representative sample from the population, he\nembarked on perusing them while looking for stories on HIV.\nThe process involved identifying the story; classifying them\ninto their respective categories, for example, a news item, a\nfeature story, an editorial, an advertising feature, news in\nbrief, opinion, letter to the editor, among others; measuring\nthe amount of space allocated for them in cubic centimeters;\nand determining the source of the story, the placement of the\nstory in the newspaper, the number of stories in the newspa-\nper, the main event, the intention of the story, and the origin,\nthat is, whether local or international.\nMogambi et al. 7\nAfter collecting the data the researchers presented it in\ndifferent ways based on the type of interpretation that is\nintended to the audience. The researchers made use of tables\nand pie charts to present the data from the research. To meet\nthe objectives of this paper, the researchers focused on some\nof the aspects from the findings in the process of analysis.\nThe aspects which the researchers analyzed include: number\nand size of articles published every month of the year under\nthe paper, type of article and its frequency of coverage during\nthe year under the paper placement of the article in the news-\npaper, themes covered in the article, and sources of the sto-\nries in the articles.\nNumber and Size of Articles Published\nOne of the objectives of this paper was to examine the amount\nof space allocated to articles on HIV to determine the\nprominence given to them in the print media. The number and\nsize of articles covered in a topic are some of the aspects of\nthe agenda setting theory of the mass media. It is evident that\nif a topic is perceived by a news media as important, it will\nfrequently cover that topic as well as allocate substantial\namounts of space for them. In this way, the mass medium will\nfind a way to present to the public their views and how they\nfeel about the topic. It also plays a role in establishing a plat-\nform to illustrate, discuss, or even debate an issue that a paper\nwants to focus on creating, thus, a mass of public discussion.\nFrom Charts 1 and 2, it is evident that December accounted\nfor the largest number of articles on HIV covered during the\nyear under this paper (27). The amount of space allocated to\nof all the space allocated to articles on HIV during the period\nunder review. This is mainly because the first day of\nDecember of every year is World Aids Day and therefore the\nChart 1. Size (in cm2) of articles published in each month of 2010.\nChart 2. Number of articles and percentage of allocated space.\n8 SAGE Open\nDaily Nation dedicates a lot of their spaces to stories on HIV.\nThe Daily Nation had 27 articles on HIV on this particular\nday during that year.\nIt emerged from the reviewed literature that most research-\ners are more concerned with the dissemination of information\non HIV to the targeted audience, without regard to how this\ninformation is presented for it to be more effective in behavior\nchange. Examining the amount of space allocated to articles\non the epidemic as well as the frequency with which these\narticles are published was therefore important in this paper.\nThe other phenomenon which is clear from Charts 1 and\n2 is that the month of August accounts for only 1% of the\nnumber of articles covered during the year under the paper.\nThis is mainly because the newspaper was preoccupied with\ncovering stories on the referendum as this was the month in\nwhich Kenyans were to go on referendum over a new consti-\ntution. It is also important to note that apart from the first day\nof December, stories on HIV were covered on only 7 other\ndays within the month. On average, each of the other months\n(apart from December and August) had an average of 7.8%\nof the total number of articles covering HIV.\nFrom this pattern of coverage, it is clear that the print\nmedia in Kenya lacks consistency in the coverage of HIV\nissues. The extreme variation in the frequency of coverage as\nwell as the space allocated to articles on HIV during the\nperiod under the paper is an indication that the print media\norganizations in Kenya lack a clear editorial policy on the\ncoverage of information on the epidemic.\nTypes of Articles\nJournalists distinguish between hard news and soft news\n(Curran, Douglas, & Whannel, 1980). Soft news generally\ndeals with the less serious news, such as news about person-\nalities or celebrities, human interest, or gossip. Hard news\ngenerally concerns the more serious news with such salient\nfoci as those of high rank in government or other institutional\nhierarchies, news of events which affect large numbers of\npeople, or news which possesses national or international\nsignificance for the past or future.\nFrom this paper, it appeared that the majority of the arti-\ncles were in the soft news category. This is because most of\nthem were not accorded much salience in terms of place-\nment, size, and frequency with which they occurred during\nthe period under the paper.\nThe articles on HIV were categorized into six groups.\nThese included news, editorials, opinions and letters to the\neditor, brief news, and special reports (features [news fea-\ntures and advertisement features] and reports). The number\nof each of the categories was represented in Table 1.\nThe majority of articles from the content analysis were news\nitems which accounted for 44% of all the sampled articles. This\nis significant as it shows that the journalists in the media house\nstrove to publish as many news items as possible during the\nyear under the paper. It is also an indication of the importance\nwith which the media house regards issues on HIV. It was also\nimportant that the news items be examined closely for aspects\nsuch as adherence to journalistic ethics and codes.\nThis was followed by special reports, which accounted\nfor 35% of all the sampled articles. In this research special\nreports included reports from research, news features, adver-\ntisement features, and magazines. Special reports are a sig-\nnificant category of articles in a newspaper in that they not\nonly give an in-depth analysis of issues but they also allocate\nbig amounts of space to the articles.\nOpinion articles represented 7% of the sampled articles.\nArticles in this category included analyses by writers of the\nDaily Nation as well as commentaries by guest writers.\nAlthough it may be argued that guest commentators' views\ndo not represent those of the media house, it is also accept-\nable to argue that by sanctioning a publication, the editor, by\nimplication, indicates that she or he agrees with it, and con-\nsequently, takes responsibility of the contents thereof. Brief\nnews accounted for 6% of all the articles sampled.\nFinally, editorials and letters accounted for 5% and 3%,\nrespectively. Editorials are also effective in the agenda set-\nting theory of the mass media in that they are articles written\nor approved by the editor, which gives a newspaper's views\non a current topic. With only 5% of the articles being editori-\nals during the year under the paper, it is evidently clear that\nthe media house has not done enough in giving its views and\nposition on the issue of HIV. It is also an indication that other\nissues are given salience over HIV by the print media.\nLetters to the editor also play an important role in the fight\nagainst HIV in that it offers a platform for the general public to\nair their views to the media house on issues regarding the epi-\ndemic. From the paper, it was found out that letters to the edi-\ntor accounted for only 3% of all the articles on HIV. This is\nconsidered too little because the public views on the epidemic\nare also important if the war on the epidemic is to be won. The\nsmall percentage of the letters to the editor could also be an\nindication that the readers of the print media do not find arti-\ncles on HIV interesting, and consequently, they are not moti-\nvated to respond to the articles on HIV in the newspaper.\nTable 1. Type, Frequency, and Percentage of Articles.\nType of article News Editorials Opinion Brief news Letters to editor Special features\nMogambi et al. 9\nPlacement of Articles\nPlacement is another very important aspect in the agenda set-\nting function of the mass media. Placement refers to the posi-\ntion of an article in the newspaper. The aspect of placement\nis important in that it is an indication of the importance of the\ntopic in the article. Some of the most important positions in\na newspaper are considered to be the first, second, third, and\nthe back page of the newspaper. When an article is placed in\nthese pages, it facilitates rapid reading as it helps the reader\nto get a glance of what he wants to know. Placement of arti-\ncles in these pages has the potential of attracting the readers'\nattention. Buckler and Travis (2005) argue that newspaper\neditors, in their agenda setting role, consider the front page\nstories the most important ones of the day and therefore the\nones that entice the largest audience.\nFrom the content analysis carried out on the Daily Nation\nnewspaper, the writer found the placement of stories on HIV\nas shown in Table 2.\nFrom the above table, it is evident that articles on HIV\nwere not placed as much as possible in the pages considered\nto be prominent in the newspaper during the period under\npaper. This was a serious omission on the part of the newspa-\nper given the importance of the subject under discussion.\nFrom the paper, the researchers found out that only one story\nappeared in the front page of the Daily Nation newspaper in\nthe period reviewed. Only one story also appeared in the\nback page of the newspaper during the year under the paper.\nPlacement in the second and third place was, however, much\nbetter, with six articles appearing in these pages in the period\nunder the paper.\nApart from the most prominent pages mentioned above,\nplacement of articles in magazines, special report pages, and\npullouts and features is also important as it shows the seri-\nousness with which the newspaper treats the topics in the\narticles. This is because the articles are treated not only\nexclusively in most of these publications but are also\naccorded substantial amounts of space. In this respect, the\nDaily Nation newspaper scored highly in that most articles\non HIV were covered in form of news features, special\nreports, advertisement features as well as magazines such as\n\"Living Magazine\" among others.\nThemes Covered in the Articles\nTheme in this paper has been used to refer to the main sub-\nject of the article published in the articles. This may also be\nused to refer to the major aim of the writer of the article.\nIn this paper, it was found out that most of the articles had\nthemes on discoveries made in HIV treatment, achievements\nwhich have so far been made in the fight against the HIV\npandemic, government policies and legislations on HIV, IEC\non HIV, appeals made by groups and individuals in the fight\nagainst HIV, activities geared toward combating the epi-\ndemic, personal views of PLWHIV, obstacles faced in the\nfight against Aids, issues surrounding funding for combating\nthe epidemic, and others. The pie chart (Chart 3) is a sum-\nmary of the themes covered in the articles in the year under\nthe paper.\nLack of Detailed Knowledge\nThe findings of this paper concurs with the argument that in\nmany parts of Africa, Kenya included, there is widespread\nawareness of HIV which coexists with highly skewed\ndetailed knowledge (Caldwell, 1999). Most of the articles on\nHIV in the period under the paper revolved around govern-\nment policies and legislations on HIV (15%), achievements\nmade in the fight against HIV (14%), and views of PLWHIV\n(14%). Articles on IEC were a paltry 8%.\nMain Actors in the News\nMain actor refers to the main source of the news for the arti-\ncle. In communication, and in particular health communica-\ntion, the source of the information to be passed across to the\naudience will determine how the message will be received by\nthe audience. One of the most commonly considered source\nfactors is source credibility. This aspect has two primary\ndimensions; expertise and trustworthiness (Berlo, Lemart, &\nResearch shows that expert sources are generally more\npersuasive than those lacking expertise and the relationship\nbetween trustworthiness and persuasion is also generally\npositive (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken, 1978). Furthermore,\neffects of source expertise and trustworthiness are often con-\ntext dependent.\nResearch has also shown that inaccurate information can\naffect the success of preventive initiatives, like health cam-\npaigns. It is therefore, important to examine where journal-\nists obtain HIV information. In this research, sources were\ncategorized into eight groups, namely: journalists, health\nexperts, and GOK, Unite nations, NGO, PLWHIV, guest\ncommentators, and others. These can be represented as in the\nTable 2. Placement of Articles.\nPlacement Front page Second and third page Back page Inside pages\nThe State\nThe state in this research has been used to refer to the sources\nof news from government. These may include health minis-\nters, Secretaries in the ministry of health, officials in the\nKenya Medical Research Institute, and other government\nofficials, who are authorized to comment on issues regarding\nHIV. Most of the state sources in this research gave news on\nissues regarding achievements, which have so far been\nachieved by the government in the fight against the epidemic,\ngovernment policies and legislations regarding HIV, and IEC\nmaterials by the ministry of health, among other issues. In\nthis paper, the state sources accounted for 22% of all the\narticles on HIV in the year under the paper.\nHealth Experts\nThe term health expert in this paper has been used to refer to\nindividuals who are qualified to provide health care. These may\ninclude doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. It also refers to\nresearchers in the field of medicine. One of the objectives of\nthis paper was to examine the articles to determine the exper-\ntise of the sources of information on HIV. Previous researchers\nhave noted that expert sources are generally more persuasive\nthan those lacking in expertise. Therefore, the importance of\nusing expert sources in disseminating information on HIV can-\nnot be overemphasized. In this regard, the print media did fairly\nwell in the use of expert sources in the dissemination of infor-\nmation regarding new discoveries made in the management of\nHIV and educating the public on prevention measures.\nPLWHIV\nThe involvement of PLWHIV in the dissemination of informa-\ntion on HIV is also very important in that the media gives them\na platform on which to air their views on such issues. PLWHIV\nare people who keep looking for solutions and require daily\nexperience from resolving psychological and social problems\nassociated with their HIV status. The solutions discovered by\nPLWHIV today can be used in future for others who face the\nsame problem. Therefore, their full involvement and participa-\ntion in design, planning, implementation, and evaluation of\nprograms is crucial to the development of effective responses\nto the HIV epidemic. In this paper, however, articles whose\nsources are PLWHIV account for only 15% of all the articles\non HIV in the year under the paper. It is also worth noting that\nmost of the articles by PLWHIV are concentrated on one per-\nson living with the HIV virus. This is a feature in form of a\ndiary, in which AsuntaWagura, a person living with HIV who\nhad publicly declared her HIV positive status several years\nago, writes informative articles on her experiences as a person\nliving with HIV. In this column, she advises, educates, and\ncounsels the general public on issues about HIV. Though this\nis a positive step by the Daily Nation newspaper, it would be\nbetter if journalists get the views of various PLWHIV as they\nhave different experiences.\nJournalists\nIn this paper, the articles by the journalists account for 18%\nof all the articles on HIV in the year under the paper. This\nTable 3. Main Actors in the News.\nSource State Health experts PLWHIV Journalist NGOs UN\nGuest\ncommentators Others\nChart 3. Themes covered in articles.\nis an indication of many issues surrounding the reporting of\nHIV information by the journalists. First, it points out to the\nfact that most journalists lack appropriate training in mat-\nters concerning HIV and so most of them shy away from\nthe task of investigating and writing stories on HIV. As a\nresult of this therefore, they rely on a wide array of sources\nto provide quotes, background information, explanations of\ncomplex aspects or technical details. It also implies that\njournalists are constrained by time and resources in most of\nthe print media houses.\nIn this paper, the term nongovernmental organization (NGO)\nhas been used to refer to any nonprofit, voluntary citizens'\ngroup, which is organized on a local, national, or interna-\ntional level. They are task-oriented and driven by people\nwith a common interest and perform a variety of service and\nhumanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to govern-\nments, advocate and monitor policies, and encourage politi-\ncal participation through provision of information. Some are\norganized around specific issues, such as human rights, envi-\nronment, or health. They provide analysis and expertise,\nserve as early warning mechanisms and help monitor and\nimplement international agreements. The paper only focused\non those NGOs organized around health issues, and in par-\nticular HIV.\nIn this paper, NGOs accounted for 8% of all the sources of\ninformation on HIV during the period under the paper. This\nwas rather less given the major role played by the NGOs in\nthe fight against the epidemic. By limiting the number of\narticles from these organizations, the journalists and by\nextension the audiences eventually miss out on important\naspects, such as expertise in research and analysis of issues\non HIV, which would have been provided by the NGOs.\nFraming of HIV Stories\nThe concept of framing is related to the agenda setting tra-\ndition but expands the research by focusing on the essence\nof the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. The\nbasis of framing theory is that the media focuses attention\non certain events and then places them within a field of\nmeaning. Framing is an important topic because it can\nhave a big influence on the interpretation of messages in\narticles by the audience.\nIn this paper, the researchers focused on how the journal-\nists framed articles on HIV with a view of determining the\neffectiveness of the articles in disseminating information on\nHIV to the target audience. The choice of language by jour-\nnalists is one of the most important elements of framing. This\nis because language helps us to remember information and\nacts to transform the way in which we view situations.\nFrom the findings of this paper, despite the efforts that\njournalists put in covering information on HIV, their choice\nof words was not appropriate in some of the articles. This\nconcurs with the views raised by a research done by the\nAfrican Woman and Child Feature Service. They argue that\njournalists lack specialization in the area of HIV. For\ninstance, the journalists seemed to have overused the term\nAIDS instead of HIV. From the findings, some of the titles\nof articles read, \"Kenya misses out on AIDS drugs\" (Daily\ndelay AIDS drugs\" (Daily Nation, Wednesday, February\nfew examples of instances where journalists substituted the\nterm HIV with AIDS.\nThe above examples are an indication that journalists in\nthe Kenyan print media are not well versed in the terminol-\nogy of HIV. Instead of sensitizing their target audiences with\naccurate information on HIV, they end up creating miscon-\nceptions on the epidemic.\nAmong the key findings of this paper is that print media\nin Kenya lacks consistency in reporting issues on HIV. It\nwas found out that articles on HIV are at their peak during\nevents such as World AIDS Day, government reports on\nthe progress so far made in the fight against the epidemic,\nas well as sponsorships by different organizations in the\nfight against the epidemic. The number of articles then\ndecline in other periods as the print media focus on issues\nother than the epidemic. Other findings from the paper\ninclude the fact that the print media in Kenya has not done\nvery well in placement of articles on HIV in the newspa-\nper. It was found out, for instance, that during the entire\nperiod under the paper, only one article on HIV made it to\nthe front page, which is considered the most prominent\npage of a newspaper. This was considered as a serious\nlapse on the part of the newspaper editors as it is an indica-\ntion that issues on HIV are not given the attention and\nprominence that they deserve.\nConclusion\nThe print media in Kenya was found to be lacking in consis-\ntency in reporting HIV issues. At times, it is flooded with\narticles on HIV, and then there are longer periods when it is\nsilent on the issue. What often spurs the print media coverage\nof the epidemic were found to be events such as announce-\nments by the government and other stakeholders on the\nachievements so far made in combating the epidemic, new\ndiscoveries made in the treatment and management of HIV\nas well as features revolving around PLWHIV. Articles on\nthese themes and others were also found to be concentrated\nin the month of December. This is mainly because most of\nthe coverage in December is based on sponsorships and pub-\nlic campaigns to mark the World AIDS Day event, which is\nobserved on 1st of December annually. This is an indication\nthat there is lack of drive in the print media organizations in\nKenya to address the epidemic.\nThough there are a fairly good number of articles on HIV\nin some of the months in the year under study, the amount of\ncolumn space allocated to them might not be proportionate to\nthe weight which the epidemic carries. The importance of an\nissue is normally judged by the amount of column space allo-\ncated to it among other aspects such as placement and the\nfrequency with which it occurs in the newspaper. The print\nmedia can do better by allocating enough space to articles on\nthe epidemic. It has been acknowledged through research\nthat media managers will not give regular coverage to HIV\nissues if there is no reader interest. This paper found that\nmost articles on the epidemic were poorly displayed and\ntucked away in the inside pages of the newspaper.\nAnother lapse is that there are only a very limited number\nof articles in form of letters to the editor. This scenario is an\nindication of either lack of interest on the part of the general\nreadership to contribute on matters concerning the epidemic\nor the editors do not publish adequate number of letters from\nthe general public. Involving the general public in the fight\nagainst the epidemic is very important.\nThe paper also found out that only a few articles on HIV\n(8%) contained detailed knowledge on HIV. These were in\nform of IEC materials. This finding concurs with then asser-\ntion that there exists a widespread awareness on HIV, but this\nknowledge coexists with highly skewed detailed knowledge.\nAccording to Caldwell (1999), the demographic and health\nsurveys conducted during the 1990s in Tanzania, Kenya, and\nZambia indicated that knowledge of the disease was almost\nuniversal but very few people were aware of or believed in\nthe protection offered by condoms.\nBased on the findings of this paper, it can be argued that\nprint media in Kenya still has a generally low and temporary\ncoverage of HIV issues on print media. This kind of cover-\nage cannot therefore create the necessary input in terms of\nawareness and change in behavior in tackling HIV.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBarnett, T., & Whiteside, A.
