    "abstract": "Abstract: The current set of studies examined regret involving action and inaction in the\nrealm of romantic relationships by testing whether such regret is associated with the\ncharacteristics of one's mate. In study 1, 394 participants reported on a previous casual\nsexual encounter, and in study 2, 358 participants reported on a previous romantic\nrelationship. In both, instances of actual engagement and instances of passing up\nopportunities were studied. Study 3 was experimental and elicited reactions to hypothetical\nscenarios from 201 participants. Regret reported by men in both study 1 and study 2 varied\nas a function of the perceived attractiveness of the participants' actual and potential mate.\nRegret reported by women in study 2 varied as a function of the perceived stinginess of the\nparticipant's mate and perceived wealth of the participants' potential mate. Study 3 found\nthat sex differences in type of regret (with men regretting inaction more than women)\noccurred only when the mate presented in the scenario was described in ways consistent\nwith mate preferences. Together these findings suggest that regret differs between the sexes\nin ways consistent with sex differences in mate preferences.\n",

Regret is an unpleasant emotion\nSex differences in regret\ncommonly felt when we experience some unfortunate outcome that we believe would have\nbeen different had we taken a different course of action.\nThere has been a great deal of research on regret, including investigations into what\npeople most commonly regret, what outcomes generate the most intense regret, and how\npeoples' thoughts about regret change over time (Gilovich and Medvec, 1995; Kahneman\nand Tversky, 1982; Landman, 1987). In a meta-analysis involving adults of varying ages\nand occupations the three most cited regrets in life were education, career, and romance\n(Roese and Summerville, 2005). In a sample of college students romance topped the list\n(Roese and Summerville, 2005). It is not surprising that romance trumped education and\ncareer among this group as college students are in the midst of pursing education and most\nhave yet to confront challenges regarding career. Another important distinction in regret\nresearch centers on the difference between action and inaction regrets. Regrets of action\ncenter on what should not have been done, whereas inaction regrets center on what should\nhave been done, but was not (Gilovich and Medvec, 1995). Which do people regret more?\nThis question has been the subject of much research, and the answer, not surprisingly,\nappears to be that it depends. For instance, Gilovich and Medvec (1995) found time frame\nto be an important factor; in the short term action is regretted most, but over time inactions\npredominate.\nDespite the considerable amount of research on regret, sex differences in regret\nhave rarely been found. In achievement domains, educational domains, and even most\nsocial domains, men and women do not seem to differ in terms of what causes them regret\n(Gilovich and Medvec, 1995). Roese, Pennington, Coleman, Janicki, Li, and Kenrick\n(2006), however, found a characteristic sex difference specific to the domain of romantic\nrelationships. The sex difference centers on the distinction made above between action and\ninaction regrets. In three studies, Roese et al. (2006) found that in the context of romantic\nrelationships, men tend to experience regrets of inaction (failing to pursue romantic\npossibilities) over action (engaging in romantic encounters), whereas women report regrets\nof inaction and action equally. Importantly, this difference in type of regret was found only\nfor romantic relationships, and not for familial relationships or friendships. When\nexamining only the sexual aspects of romantic relationships, a more extreme sex difference\nemerged, wherein men reported particularly high levels of regret for inaction and women\nreported higher levels of regret for action.\nRoese et al. (2006) cite evolutionary factors as a possible explanation for these sex\ndifferences. According to sexual strategy theory, basic differences in the reproductive\nbiology between men and women have led to the evolution of sex differences in mating\nstrategies and preferences (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). One important reproductive difference\nbetween men and women is asymmetry in minimum levels of parental investment\npregnancy, lactation, and usually childcare, men need only engage in a single act of sex to\nproduce a child. Secondly, although men who mate with a variety of sexual partners in a\ngiven time span may sire multiple offspring, having multiple partners confers no such\nbenefit to women (Symons, 1979). Indeed, it is well documented that men have a greater\ndesire for sexual variety and a greater willingness to engage in casual sex relative to\nSex differences in regret\n1993; Schmitt, 2003). Thus, casual sex is thought to play a larger role in the strategic\nrepertoire of men than women because it has historically conferred a much greater\nadvantage to men than to women. In addition, because fertility is more strongly tied to\nyouth in women than in men (Williams, 1957), a failed relationship may pose a larger\nreproductive cost to women than men.\nThus, the sex differences in regret identified by Roese et al. (2006) may be\nunderstood by proposing that such regret results from engaging in behaviors that run\ncounter to evolved sexual strategies. Men may disproportionately regret neglecting to\npursue romantic opportunities (inaction) because failing to pursue such opportunities has\nhistorically hindered reproductive success. In contrast, among women, for whom there has\nhistorically been greater cost associated with action, it is instances of action that are\ndisproportionately regretted (at least with respect to purely sexual aspects of relationships).\nIf it is true that sex differences in relationship regret reflect divergent sexual\nstrategies, then we might expect sex differences in regret to vary as a function of mate\ncharacteristics in ways that map onto differences in mate preferences. The primary purpose\nof the current research is to test this proposition. Although there are some characteristics\nthat men and women both value heavily in a mate (e.g., kindness), other characteristics are\nmore heavily valued by members of one sex than the other. Men tend to value\nattractiveness and youth in their mates, and women tend to value those with resources and\nthose willing to provide said resources. That men and women tend to value different\ncharacteristics in their mates has been widely documented (Buss, 1989; Buss and Schmitt,\nAllgeier, 1992). For instance, one study involving thousands of participants from three\ndozen cultures found women more heavily valued resources and status in mates and men\nmore heavily valued physical attractiveness (Shackelford et al., 2005). According to sexual\nstrategy theory, these mate preferences stem from sex differences in what constrains\nreproductive success (Buss and Schmitt, 1993, but see Eagly and Wood, 1999, for an\nopposing view). Specifically, because women invest more heavily in offspring and have\nsharp constraints on quantity, the primary reproductive limitation for women centers\naround the resources they can secure for themselves and their children. Women therefore\nvalue men with resources and those who demonstrate a willingness to commit those\nresources. The primary limitation to men's reproductive success is access to healthy and\nfertile females. Since relative youth and physical attractiveness provide strong cues to\nhealth and fertility in females (Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002; Thornhill and Gangestad,\n1999), men are hypothesized to value such qualities in potential mates. Thus, we propose\nthat the pattern of relationship regret identified by Roese et al. (2006) will be moderated by\nmate characteristic. Specifically, we propose that men will be particularly regretful of\nmissed romantic opportunities when the potential mate is attractive and may regret\nromantic involvements more when the mate is relatively unattractive. Women, on the other\nhand, may be particularly regretful of romantic involvements when the mate is low in\nresources (or withholds them) and may regret missed opportunities more when the potential\nmate is relatively high in resources and generous with them.\nIn three studies we tested whether sex differences in relationship regret vary in the\nways proposed above. The first two studies took the form of a survey. In study 1,\nSex differences in regret\nparticipants were asked about either a previous one-night stand or about a situation in\nwhich they believe they had the opportunity to engage in a one-night stand. In study 2,\nparticipants were asked about either a previous romantic relationships or missed\nopportunity for a romantic relationship. In both studies participants reported their level of\nregret in regard to the target situation and rated their previous partner or potential partner\non a variety of characteristics. In study 3, we presented participants with a hypothetical\nscenario that described a person either partaking in or passing up the opportunity for casual\nsex or a romantic relationship with someone who varied in terms of physical attractiveness\nand resource potential. Participants then rated how regretful they believe they would be had\nthey been the protagonist in the scenario.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nIn both studies, participants were students enrolled in upper division psychology\nand biology courses at Southeastern Louisiana University who participated in the study for\nextra credit. In study 1 (the casual sex study), 394 students participated. Of these, seven\nwomen and three men reported being either homosexual or bisexual. Data from these\nindividuals were not included in the data analysis, resulting in a sample of 158 male and\n226 female participants. In study 2 (the romantic relationships study) 358 students\nparticipated. Of these, five of the men and seven women reported being either homosexual\nor bisexual and were thus not included in the data analysis, resulting in a sample of 144\nmale and 202 female participants. The mean age of the participants in study 1 was 21.01\nyears and 21.95 in study 2. In neither sample did male and female participants differ\nMaterials\nThe questionnaire packet contained either the action survey or the inaction survey\nand a demographic questionnaire.\nCasual sex survey (Study 1)\nAction. In the action survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent\ncasual sex experience they have had with a member of the opposite sex (an experience in\nwhich the participant had sexual intercourse, i.e., a one-night stand). They were asked to\nthink of an encounter in which no romantic relationship (i.e., no dating) occurred prior to or\nfollowing the experience. If the participant had not had such an encounter in his or her life,\nthe participant was asked to skip ahead to the last page of the packet. The first question\nasked the participant to report how long ago the event had occurred in months. The next\nitem asked participants to rate how much they regret the encounter on a scale from 1 (not at\nall) to 7 (severely). Next, participants were asked to rate the person with whom they had\nhad the encounter on six characteristics, each on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely).\nThe characteristics were: funny, kind, stingy, physically attractive, wealthy, and honest.\nSex differences in regret\nThese traits reflect the primary traits of interest (physically attractive, wealthy, and stingy)\nas well as several traits that are generally desired in a mate. Stingy was included because it\nis not only the possession of wealth, but the willingness to provide said wealth that is\nassumed to be of value to women, and because wealth is not common among students. The\norder of the six items was randomly determined for each participant.\nInaction. In the inaction survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent\nopportunity where they believe they could have had a casual sexual encounter (could have\nhad sexual intercourse, i.e., a one-night stand) with a member of the opposite sex, but chose\nnot to or did not try hard enough to. They were asked to think of an encounter in which no\nromantic relationship (i.e., no dating) occurred prior to or following the experience. The\nremaining part of the survey was identical to the action survey with the exception that\nparticipants were asked to rate how much they regret not having had the sexual encounter.\nRomantic relationship survey (Study 2)\nAction. In this survey, participants were asked to think of their most recent former\n(i.e., not current) romantic relationship. Romantic relationship was defined for them as a\npreviously ongoing relationship that could be defined as a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship\n(not a strictly sexual one). The remainder of the survey was the same as in study 1 except\nthat participants were asked to rate how much they regret having been in this relationship\non a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (severe) and were asked to report how long ago the\nrelationship had ended in months.\nInaction. In this survey, participants were asked to think of the most recent situation\nin which they believe they could have entered into a romantic relationship with someone,\nbut they chose not to or did not try hard enough to. They were told to think of a situation\nthat the respondent believes may have possibly turned into an ongoing relationship that\ncould be defined as a boyfriend/girlfriend (i.e., not a strictly sexual one). They were then\nasked to take a moment to think about this \"possibly could have been\" relationship and the\nother person involved before answering the questions that followed. The remaining part of\nthe survey was identical to the action survey except that the participants were asked to rate\nhow much they regret not pursuing this relationship and asked how long ago this\nopportunity had occurred.\nDemographic questionnaire. The last page asked participants to report their sex,\ntheir sexual orientation, and their age.\nProcedure\nThe experimenter arrived at the beginning of the class and administered the surveys\nto the students. Participants received either the action survey or the inaction survey. The\nexperimenter announced that the purpose of the study was to investigate different types of\nrelationships, and that participants would receive one of several different versions of a\nsurvey about relationships. The experimenter announced that completion of the survey was\nvoluntary and stressed the anonymous nature of the questionnaire.\nSex differences in regret\nStudy 1 Results\nSixty one men (77%) completed the action survey and 64 men (81%) completed the\ninaction survey. Sixty nine women (61%) completed the action survey and 89 women\n(78%) completed the inaction survey1. Recall that the participants were told to skip the\nsurvey and complete only the demographic form if they had not experienced the situation\ndescribed in the survey. Whereas men did not differ in the rate with which they completed\nSex differences in regret by type (action vs. inaction) for causal sex encounters\nBefore analyzing the relationship between mate characteristics and regret, we\nexamined whether the pattern of sex differences in type of regret identified by Roese et al.\n(2006) was evident in the current sample. To do this we conducted a 2 (sex of participant)\nX 2 (type of encounter: action vs. inaction) ANOVA with rating of regret as the dependent\nregret for action (M = 3.85) exceeded regret for inaction (M = 2.19). Importantly, the\nWhile men reported relatively similar levels of regret for action and inaction, t(124) = 1.22,\np = .27, (M = 3.16 and M = 2.86, respectively), women reported much higher levels of\nrespectively).\nMate qualities as predictors of regret for casual sex encounters\nWe used multiple regression analyses to test our predictions about the relationship\nbetween mate characteristics and regret. We conducted a separate regression analysis for\neach sex and each type of regret (action vs. inaction). In each of the four analyses, the six\ncharacteristic ratings were entered into the regression model with the rating of regret as the\ncriterion variable2. These regressions involve the simultaneous entry of all the variables, so\nthat the coefficients reflect the unique predictive power of each predictor while controlling\nfor all others.\n1 The mean number of months that had reportedly elapsed since the event had occurred was 2.92 for those\nwho completed the action survey and 2.56 for those who completed the inaction survey. A 2 (type of\nencounter; action vs. inaction) X 2 (participant sex) ANOVA on the number of months revealed this (action\n= .299, nor the interaction between type of encounter and participant sex, was significant F(1,258) = 1.49, p =\n2 Not surprisingly, many of the trait ratings were weakly to moderately correlated. In study 1, correlations\namong trait ratings varied in strength from .02 (between fun and kind) to .59 (between kind and honest). In\nstudy 2, correlations among ratings varied in strength from .03 (between stingy and fun) and .52 (between\nkind and honest). All predictors in this model and the subsequent models tested in study 1 and study 2\nexhibited VIF values less than 2.\nSex differences in regret\nMate characteristics as predictors of action regret in casual sex encounters\nOur first regression analysis examined regret in response to having engaged in the\ncasual sex encounter (action regret). Table 1 reports the coefficients. In this and all\nsubsequent regression analyses, simple regression models produced findings that did not\ndiffer substantially from the combined models reported below.\nTable 1.

We note, however, that women reported very low levels of regret for inaction (M =\n1.61), which may have precluded any detectable association with the predictors.

Regression coefficients of mate characteristics predicting regret involving a\nromantic relationship (Study 2) conducted separately by sex and type of encounter (Action\nvs. Inaction)\nAction B B Inaction B B\nMen Men\nWomen Women\nDiscussion\nThe primary purpose of the study was to test for sex differences in the mate\nqualities that predict regret. Consistent with expectations, mate attractiveness accounted for\na significant amount of variance in regret among men for both sexual encounters and\nromantic relationships. This held true for both action and inaction regrets. Thus, the more\nattractive the woman, the less regret our male participants reported over having engaged\nromantically or sexually with her and the more regret they reported over having missed out\non an opportunity to have engaged romantically or sexually. Notably, mate attractiveness\nwas the only trait that significantly and consistently predicted regret among men in all four\ntypes of romantic/sexual scenarios. In contrast, mate attractiveness did not significantly\npredict regret among our female participants for any of the four types of romantic/sexual\nscenarios.\nThe pattern of findings for our female participants was only moderately consistent\nwith predictions. Our predictions for women largely held up in the romantic relationship\nsurvey. Among our female participants only, mate wealth (in missed relationship\nopportunities and, to a marginal extent, in relationships) and mate stinginess (in\nrelationships) was related to regret. Contrary to expectations, stinginess was not associated\nSex differences in regret\nwith regret among women in the inaction context. Perhaps stinginess is hard to assess\noutside of an actual relationship.\nNeither perceived mate wealth nor perceived mate stinginess accounted for a\nsignificant amount of variance in regret involving casual sex among women. Mate\nresources are likely less important in very short term mating situations in which continued\ninvestment is generally unlikely. In addition, whereas a mate's physical attractiveness may\nbe readily and immediately apparent in a casual sex scenario, a mate's wealth or stinginess\nis generally not. Lastly, when it came to inaction, women reported little regret, very\npossibly resulting in a floor effect.\nThe only quality that predicted regret in women in the sexual context was honesty\nin sexual action encounters, such that women who rated their mates as less honest reported\nrelatively greater regret over having engaged in casual sex. We believe this may have\nresulted from dissatisfaction with the limited nature of the encounter coupled with the\nbelief that her mate may have deceived her about the nature of the encounter. Researchers\nhave identified forms of deception that are used to achieve the goals of one sex at the\nexpense of the other (Haselton, Buss, Oubaid, and Angleitner, 2005). One of the most\nrobust forms of deception identified in this research is that of men deceiving women about\nthe depth of their feelings or magnitude of commitment in order to gain sexual access.\nBelieving that one has fallen prey to such a deception may have been a contributing factor\nin women's regret in such situations. Although it is important not to read much out of\nmarginal findings, we briefly note here that the tendency for men to regret sexual inaction\nless when the woman in question was perceived as kind may tie into this as well. There are\ncertainly many reasons a man may have little regret about passing up an opportunity for a\none-night stand. One reason may be the belief that having a one-night stand may not be in\nthe best interest of the woman involved. This concern may weigh more heavily when the\nwoman in question is believed to be kind.\nAs expected, men and women differed in the type of regret (action vs. inaction) they\nexperienced with respect to both casual sex and romantic relationships. We discuss these\nfindings in the general discussion.\nOverview\nBoth study 2 and (to some extent) study 1 found that partner characteristics\npredicted relationship regret in ways consistent with known mate preferences. It is our view\nthat the mate qualities influenced the intensity of regret experienced among our\nparticipants. One could argue, however, that the causal direction between partner\ncharacteristics and regret runs in the opposite direction; that regret experienced after a\nsexual or romantic encounter distorts or colors one's perceptions of one's partner. The\npurpose of our third study was to conceptually replicate the findings of study 1 and 2 by\nconducting an experiment. Converging results from different methods would provide\ngreater confidence in our findings and allow for stronger causal conclusions about the\nimpact of mate characteristics on regret. In this third study, participants were asked to rate\nhow regretful they would feel if they were the main character in a hypothetical scenario\nSex differences in regret\nthat described a person either partaking in or passing up the opportunity for casual sex or a\nromantic relationship with someone who varied in terms of physical attractiveness and\nresource potential.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 201 students (100 male) enrolled in an introductory psychology\ncourse at Southeastern Louisiana University who received partial course credit for\nparticipating. Eleven of our participants (eight female and three male) reported that they\nwere either homosexual or bisexual and were thus not included in our data analysis. The\nmean age of the participants was 20.37 years. Our male and female participants did not\nDesign\nThe experiment was a 2 (sex of participant) X 2 (type of relationship; casual sex or\nromantic) X 2 (type of situation; action vs. inaction) X 2 (mate characteristic; resource\npotential vs. attractive) between subject factorial design.\nMaterials\nHypothetical scenarios. Sixteen scenarios were created corresponding to the 16\ncells resulting from crossing the four factors. The instructions for all scenarios read as\nfollows: \"The following reports a hypothetical situation that may or may not be similar to\nsomething that might happen to you. Please put yourself in the position of the main\ncharacter, (described as `you'), as you read the scenario.\" All scenarios were between 224\nand 234 words in length and began by stating that the main character was single. The male\nand female versions differed only in terms of the name of the love/sex interest and relevant\npronouns.\nThe scenarios that presented the casual sexual encounter involved the main\ncharacter going to go eat at a local bar and grill with his or her friend. At the bar and grill,\nthe main character meets a woman/man named Ashley/Mike. \"The two of you become\nengrossed in conversation, you realize you have quite a bit in common such as that you are\nboth college students. You have a good time chatting and laughing with one another.\" As\nthe establishment begins to close down, Ashley/Mike asks if you would like to finish the\nconversation at her/his apartment. The main character agrees. The ending of this scenario\ndepends upon the action/inaction factor. In the action versions, the scenario ends with:\n\"once you get to the apartment one thing eventually leads to another and the two of you\nhave sex. The next morning, you wake up in Ashley/Mike's bed. After a brief conversion\nwith Ashley/Mike, you leave her/his apartment. You never see Ashley/Mike again.\" In the\ninaction versions, the scenario ends with: \"Once at Ashley/Mike's home it becomes\napparent Ashley/Mike would like to have sex. You tell her/him you are not interested and\nleave her/his apartment. You never see Ashley/Mike again.\"\nThe scenarios that presented the romantic relationship involved the main character\nmeeting a woman/man named Ashley/Mike in class. \"One day in class, a woman/man\nSex differences in regret\nstrikes up a conversation with you. After talking for a while you realize you have quite a bit\nin common with one another and end up talking regularly before class for the remainder of\nthe semester.\" Later the scenario reads that \"Ashley/Mike seems interested in you. On the\nlast day of class, Ashley/Mike hands you her/his phone number and asks that you call\nher/him if you are interested in going out sometime.\" It further states that \"from previous\nconversations, you know s/he is not interested in any sort of casual or purely sexual\nrelationship.\" In the action versions, the scenario ends with: \"You end up calling her/him\nand in time the two of you begin to date one another exclusively. The relationship lasts for\nabout 9 months. Eventually, however, you two split and go your separate ways, and you\ndon't see Ashley/Mike again.\" In the inaction versions, the scenario ends with: \"You gladly\ntake her/his phone number but end up not calling her/him. You never see Ashley/Mike\nagain.\"\nPartner characteristic was manipulated by describing the love/sex interest as having\nhigh resource potential (and average attractiveness) or as being highly attractive (and\naverage resource potential). The description appeared midway through the scenario. We\nincluded information indicating that the love/sex interest was average with respect to the\nnon-target trait in order to preclude participants from inferring a high value on that non-\ntarget trait which would likely result from a halo effect or implicit personality theory. In the\nhigh resource potential conditions, the love/sex interest is described as being \"confident\nand ambitious. S/he is a business major who has a great job lined up when s/he graduates.\nIn terms of looks, s/he is rather plain, and is of average attractiveness.\" In the attractiveness\nconditions, the love/sex interest is described as \"being good-looking and nicely built. You\nconsider him/her to be very physically attractive. S/he doesn't seem to have many\nambitions and is not yet sure what s/he wants to do for a living.\" We believe that this last\nsentence, when combined with the information that the love/sex interest is a college\nstudent, describes a person of fairly average resource potential for this population.\nThe dependent measure of regret. The exact wording of the question used to assess\nregret varied slightly by condition. Participants were asked to rate how much he or she\nwould regret the sexual encounter (or passing on the encounter) described in the scenario or\nhow much he or she would regret having been in relationship (or not pursuing the\nrelationship, i.e., not calling Ashley/Mike) described in the scenario. Participants provided\ntheir ratings on a 1 (no regret) to 7 point scale (extreme regret).\nPost-scenario survey. The purpose of the post scenario survey was to perform a\nmanipulation check and to collect demographic information. Participants were asked to\nreport how Ashley/Mike was described in the scenario. Following this task, participants\nwere asked to indicate whether they were currently in a romantic relationship, and, if so,\nhow long they had been in the relationship, their sex, their sexual orientation, and their age.\nProcedure\nExperimental sessions were run in groups of a maximum of five participants. After\nproviding brief instructions and emphasizing the anonymous nature of their responses, the\nexperimenter distributed a scenario and accompanying regret question to each participant\nand told the participants to return the sheet to a communal envelope when done. Scenarios\nwere randomly distributed except that men received a male version and women a female\nSex differences in regret\nversion. Once everyone placed their completed responses in the envelope, the experimenter\ndistributed the post-scenario survey. Once everyone had completed the post-scenario\nsurvey, the participants were debriefed, thanked, and excused.\nCoding participant descriptions. In order for mate characteristics to have affected\nratings of regret, participants must have both read and registered the few sentences\npresented in the scenario that described the partner as either physically attractive or having\nhigh resource potential. In order to identify and analyze data from only participants who\nshowed evidence of having read and registered the critical information we had a graduate\nstudent, blind to the hypothesis and participant condition, code participants' description of\nAshley/Mike. The description was coded as adequately described if those in the resource\npotential condition mentioned either that the person was ambitions or some synonym of\nambitious, had a job lined up, or was a business major or if those in the attractiveness\ncondition mentioned that the person was attractive or some synonym of attractive.\nResults\nTen of the female participants and 11 of the male participants did not adequately\ndescribe the potential mate as depicted in the scenario, and thus were dropped from the\nanalyses. We then conducted a 2 (sex of participant) X 2 (type of relationship; casual sex or\nromantic) X 2 (type of regret; action vs. inaction) X 2 (partner characteristic; resource\npotential vs. attractiveness) ANOVA with rating of regret as the dependent variable. There\nwas only one significant main effect, which was sex of participant, F(1,153) = 5.58, p =\nway interaction between sex of participant and type of regret was significant, F(1,153) =\n43.44, p = .001. This two way interaction shows that while men reported higher levels of\nregret for the inaction scenarios than for action scenarios (M = 4.84 and M = 3.41,\nrespectively), women reported higher levels of regret for the action scenarios than the\nThis two way interaction was qualified by two significant three way interactions.\nFirst, and most importantly, it was qualified by partner characteristic.

When women\nwere presented with a partner of considerable wealth potential (and average looks) regret\nfor action no longer significantly exceeded that of inaction.

Simple effect analyses revealed that men reported higher levels of\ninaction regret than action regret regardless of whether the scenario depicted a romantic\nrelationship or a purely sexual encounter.

Our results are as predicted. Men reported relatively greater regret in response\nto a scenario in which they imagined passing up the opportunity for a sexual or romantic\nrelationship (compared to imagining having engaged in one), but only when the love/sex\ninterest was described as attractive (and average in wealth potential). When the love/sex\ninterest was described as average looking (and high in wealth potential), men no longer\ndisproportionately reported regret in response to failing to pursue over partaking in the\nsexual/romantic relationship.\nOverall, women reported greater regret in response to imagining engaging in a\nsexual or romantic relationship than in response to imagining passing on the opportunity.\nHowever, again, this tendency depended upon the particular characteristics possessed by\nthe romantic/sex interest. The pattern held when the love/sex interest was described as\naverage in wealth potential (and high in attractiveness). When the love/sex interest was\ndescribed as high in resources (and average attractiveness), women no longer\ndisproportionately imagined regretting partaking in the sexual/romantic relationship. This is\nexactly the pattern one would expect if attractiveness was more highly valued by men and\nwealth potential more highly valued among women.\nCuriously, the pattern above did not vary significantly by type of relationship. It\nseems reasonable to expect that the relative importance of mate characteristics might differ\nsomewhat depending on the nature of the relationship. That it did not in this experiment\nmay in part be due to the relatively short term nature of the romantic relationship we\npresented in our study. Perhaps the two characteristics would differentially affect regret if\nwe had included scenarios that involved a genuinely long term relationship such as\nmarriage.\nOne limitation of our experiment involves the manner by which we manipulated\nmate characteristic. In our experiment the two target characteristics (wealth and\nSex differences in regret\nattractiveness) were pitted against one another. High in terms of one characteristic was\npaired with average of the other, and vise versa. One could argue the differences in the\nratings found in the study was driven less by attraction towards the target characteristic and\nmore by an aversion to the non-target characteristic. We think that unlikely and note that\neven if aversion played a role it did so in way consistent with mate preferences. However,\nfuture research should disentangle the two target characteristics in order to provide a\nclearer picture of the mechanisms underlying these findings.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe findings reported here are largely consistent with that of previous research\nshowing that degree of regret experienced by men and women in romantic and sexual\ndomains differs according to whether the regret was one of action (regret over having\nengaged in a relationship or sexual encounter) or inaction (regret over having passed up an\nopportunity to engage in a relationship or sexual encounter), with men tending to regret\ninaction more than women (Roese et al., 2006).\nWhen asked about a previous romantic experience (study 2), men reported greater\nregret over failures to pursue a relationship (inaction) than having had one (action), while\nwomen's ratings for these two (action vs. inaction) were similar. This pattern mirrors the\nfindings reported by Roese et al. (2006, studies 1 and 2). Men in their study\ndisproportionally reported inaction regrets while women reported the two types of regrets\nwith equal frequency. This similarity in findings emerged despite considerable differences\nin the way regret was assessed in these the two investigations. Participants in the present\nstudy were asked to think about their most recent romantic relationship or failure to pursue\na romantic relationship. Regret was then measured along a continuum. In contrast, Roese et\nal. (2006) asked participants to identify romantic events that caused them regret.\nParticipants' descriptions were then categorized as action or inaction and their relative\nproportions compared. Thus, the similar pattern emerged whether the romantic events in\nquestion involved highly variable levels of regret or were, by definition, regretful.\nSex differences in the action/inaction dichotomy were more pronounced in the\ncontext of casual sexual experiences. Women in our studies reported much higher levels of\nregret over having had a one-night stand than over passing one up (either in real-life or in\nresponse to a scenario). In contrast, men reported similar levels of action and inaction\nregret (for a real-life one-night stand encounter) or reported greater regret for inaction than\naction (in response to a scenario featuring a one-night stand). Men and women reported\nsimilar levels of regret, however, in response scenarios featuring romantic relationships\n(study three), with both reporting more regret for inaction than action. Sharper sex\ndifferences in the sexual domain is once again consistent with the findings reported by\nRoese et al. (2006, study 3) who found greater sex differences in the sexual compared to\nnonsexual components of previous relationships. Theoretically, that sex differences were\nstronger in the context of casual sex is not surprising as men and women's sexual strategies\nare thought to diverge most in this context (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).\nAcross our studies, the greatest regret was reported by women in reference to\nengaging in casual sex. This is consistent with recent research showing that a substantial\nSex differences in regret\nproportion of women (but few men) report an array of negative emotions following a one-\nTogether these findings may suggest there remain considerable sex differences with respect\nto the psychological consequences of casual sex, despite recent advances (e.g., reliable\nbirth control) having mostly leveled the playing field with respect to the physical\nconsequences.\nThe primary purpose of the current research was to examine whether regret in\nromantic and sexual domains varies as a function of mate characteristics in ways consistent\nwith sex differences in mate preferences. The results of our three studies largely, although\nnot entirely, confirm our hypotheses. In all three studies, men's regret (both action and\ninaction) was related to the perceived attractiveness of his mate or potential mate. This held\ntrue for actual relationships and sexual encounters (study 2 and 1 respectively) and was\napparent in our experimental study as well (study 3), where disproportionate regret for\ninaction was more pronounced for physically attractive mates.\nIn contrast to our male participants, females' level of regret in romantic and sexual\nrelationships was unrelated to mate attractiveness. As expected, mate wealth and stinginess\nwas related to regret for women, although the relationships were not as strong or consistent\nas was the case of mate attractiveness for men. For previous sexual encounters (study 1),\nneither of these characteristics was significantly related to regret. These characteristics did,\nhowever, significantly predict regret in former romantic relationships (study 2). The\nstingier the mate was rated, the greater the reported regret over having had that romantic\nrelationship, and the wealthier the potential mate, the more regret the women reported over\nhaving failed to pursue a romantic relationship. The importance of mate resources to\nwomen's regret was also apparent in our experimental study (study 3) where\ndisproportionate regret for action in response to a scenario was less pronounced for mates\nhigh in resource potential.\nTaken together these findings conform quite well to our predictions. It is important\nto note, however, that participants in all three studies were, for the most part, young adults.\nThe sex differences found in these studies may not hold in older and more diverse samples.\nFor instance, the importance of the mate characteristics wealth and attractiveness may\nbecome less sex differentiated as people get older, and thus the relationship between mate\ncharacteristics and regret may become less sex differentiated as well. Perhaps the largest\nlimitation of our study is the potential for demand characteristics and social desirability to\nhave impacted responding. Sexual behavior in particular is a socially sensitive topic, and\ncollecting data in a classroom setting (as in studies 1 and 2) may have made salient sex-\ntyped societal expectations. We can't deny the possible influence of such factors. We note,\nhowever, that in studies 1 and 2 our sample consisted only of those individuals who\nadmitted to the stated sexual or romantic experience. It seems likely the participants most\nprone to these biases would have opted out of completing the survey. In addition, we took\nseveral measures to reduce biases in responding (e.g., anonymous responding, a between\nsubject design, trait ratings collected following regret rating).\nAlthough the mate characteristics of wealth and stinginess were related to regret for\nwomen, the relationships were both fewer and weaker than was the case of mate\nattractiveness for men. This is in line with several previous studies indicating that the\nSex differences in regret\nimportance of mate attractiveness in men's preferences is more consistent across cultures\nand seemingly less amendable to societal factors than is women's preferences for men with\nresources (Eagly and Wood, 1999; Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Perhaps the importance of\nmate resources to women's mate preferences (and perhaps to women's reproductive\nfitness) has been overstated. However, it is also likely that the impact of mate resources\nmay be weaker among female college students than among the general populations. Most\nmale college students have few resources and current status in regard to resources is not a\ngood predictor of later status. In addition, mate wealth and stinginess may have yielded\nweak associations in comparison to mate attractiveness because such factors may be more\ndifficult to ascertain and be less salient than physical attractiveness.\nThe literature on mate preferences has often been criticized on the grounds that its\nfindings are based on paradigms in which participants list their ideal mate preferences or\nexamine vignettes and photographs of strangers (e.g., Dickermann, 1989; Eastwick and\nFinkel, 2008). Such methods, it has been argued, may not reveal preferences that occur in\nreal relationships. In the present research, two of the three studies examined ratings derived\nfrom actual interpersonal experiences and found that the level of regret coinciding with\nmate preferences were often sex differentiated in the expected manner. In addition,\nparticipants in the current studies were never directly asked about mate preferences, and yet\nmate characteristics were implicated in expected ways. By providing some (albeit indirect)\nevidence of sex differences in mate preferences in the context of real relationships and\nasked in a nontransparent manner, these studies serve to further bolster confidence in the\npattern of sex differences identified in previous research.\nWe maintain that the sex differences discovered here, like those initially found by\nRoese et al. (2006), may be understood by viewing such regret as the result of engaging in\nbehaviors that run counter to evolved sexual strategies. Men may disproportionately regret\nneglecting to pursue romantic opportunities because failing to pursue such opportunities\nhas historically hindered reproductive success, while women may disproportionately regret\naction (at least for purely sexual aspects of relationships) because of the greater costs\nassociated with action than inaction for women. Likewise, men may regret missing out on\nromantic opportunities more (and regret romantic entanglements less) when the mate in\nquestion is attractive because, historically, mating with such women enhanced men's\nreproductive success. In contrast, women may regret romantic entanglements less (and\nregret passing up romantic opportunities more) when the mate in question has resources\nbecause, historically, mating with such men enhanced reproductive success. Thus, the\nregret we feel may not only be a product of our own personal past experiences, but also a\nproduct of humanity's past, reflecting lessons learned and passed down by our ancestors.\nThe sex differences reported here may also be explained by the differences in\njustifications and rationalizations that men and women may have at their disposal in sexual\nand romantic domains. Previous research has shown that regret occurs more frequently in\nareas that allow for free choice (Roese and Summerville, 2005), and is more keenly felt\nwhen actions are unconstrained by outside forces (Cooper and Fazio, 1984) and are\ncounter-normative (Zeelenberg, van den Bos, van Dijk, and Pieters, 2002). Men may\nexperience less sexual regret following action than women because they may feel they have\nless choice over such actions than do women (\"that's what men do\"). This may be\nSex differences in regret\nparticularly true when the mate is attractive (\"how could I say no\"). Likewise, women may\nregret sexual inaction less than men do because of greater constraints on sexual behavior\n(e.g., greater reputational concerns, greater physical risks). These factors may wield some\ninfluence in romantic relationships as well, with women and men being differentially able\nto justify partaking and passing up relationships based on the characteristics of the mate or\npotential mate.\nWhether one favors distal or proximal explanations for these sex differences, the\nconsequence of such sex differences in regret are the same. Regret, although unpleasant to\nexperience, serves an important purpose; it pushes people toward corrective action\nRoese, 2008; Zeelenberg, 1999). In the romantic realm, what causes regret depends on\none's sex. The current findings reveal just how tailored such regret may be, functioning to\nnudge men and women to seek out and to avoid potential mates in accordance to who is (or\nwho has been) most reproductively beneficial.\nReferences\nBuss, D.
