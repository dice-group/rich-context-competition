    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper is intended to contribute to the discussion of the differential level of adoption of Big Data among research\ncommunities. Recognising the impracticality of conducting an audit across all forms and uses of Big Data, we have\nrestricted our enquiry to one very specific form of Big Data, namely general purpose taxonomies, of which Mosaic,\nAcorn and Origins are examples, that rely on data from a variety of Big Data feeds. The intention of these taxonomies is\nto enable the records of consumers and citizens held on Big Data datasets to be coded according to type of residential\nneighbourhood or ethno-cultural heritage without any use of questionnaires. Based on our respective experience in the\nacademic social sciences, in government and in the design and marketing of these taxonomies, we identify the features of\nthese classifications which appear to render them attractive or problematic to different categories of potential user or\nresearcher depending on how the relationship is conceived. We conclude by identifying seven classifications of user or\npotential user who, on account of their background, current position and future career expectations, tend to respond in\ndifferent ways to the opportunity to adopt these generic systems as aids for understanding social processes.\n",

Many\ninnovative methods have been developed by social sci-\nentists to analyse Big Data. This paper does not how-\never focus on methods. Rather, it examines the\nadoption of geodemographic or postcode-based classi-\nfications such as Acorn and Mosaic which classify\npeople on the basis of the demographics of the neigh-\nbourhood in which they live and Origins, an ethno-\ncultural classification, which infers cultural background\nfrom a person's name.1\nThe relevance of these systems in a world of Big\nData is that they enable people of known identity to\nbe categorised by proxies for social status and ethnicity\nquickly, inexpensively, without the need to develop a\nbespoke classification system and without the need for\nthem to respond to a survey questionnaire.\nIn an introductory section we contextualise our dis-\ncussion within the framework of the wider discussion\nregarding the adoption of Big Data as an alternative\nsource of empirical evidence to that of the social survey.\nWe then explain the origins of generic taxonomies\nwhose standardised categories are derived from the\nuse of Big Data and discuss their potential complemen-\ntarity with better established taxonomies whose\n1Kings College London, London, UK\n2Webber Phillips Ltd, London, UK\nCorresponding author:\nRichard James Webber, Kings College London, 3 Bisham Gardens,\nEmail: richardwebber@originsinfo.eu\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-\nat-sage).\nwidespread use results from the ease with which they\ncan be included as questions in survey questionnaires. It\nis important in this context to distinguish, on the one\nhand, generic taxonomies, these being designed by one\ngroup of researchers for use by an extensive population\nof other third party users, from bespoke taxonomies,\nthese being designed by a user group primarily for use\nin its own research projects or from research projects\nwhose purpose is aimed at improving quantitative\nmethods for optimising different forms of classifica-\ntion.2 It is the use of the first category, generic taxo-\nnomies, which is the exclusive subject of this paper. The\nother categories are already well-documented and dis-\ncussed in the academic literature.\nTo understand the uneven adoption of generic taxo-\nnomies among the groups of potential user for whom\nthey have been designed we review some of the features\nof these new taxonomies which, on the basis of our\nexperience, prove problematical for certain categories\nof user and attractive to others. This leads us to a\nconsideration of the theoretical basis on which\nthey are constructed and the challenges these new\ngeneric taxonomies present to existing theoretical\nconceptualisations.\nFrom this consideration of their features and rela-\ntionship to theoretical constructs we believe we are in a\nposition at the conclusion of the paper to identify a\nnumber of broad categories of user or potential user\nand to characterise them according to how likely they\nare to adopt these taxonomies.\nBig Data as an alternative to the social\nsurvey\nFirst let us consider the wider context of the adoption\nof Big Data in the social sciences. In their seminal paper\n`The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology', Savage\nand Burrows (2007) warn that the future effectiveness\nof the social science community is in danger of being\nprejudiced by over reliance on the social survey as a\ntool for generating quantitative evidence.3 In their\nopinion there are many fields of interest to the social\nscience community that could be more effectively inves-\ntigated using large-scale data sets of the kind generated\nas by-products of the digitalisation of transaction pro-\ncessing systems (``Big Data'') which, generally speak-\ning, contain data on the whole population as opposed\nto a sample drawn from it. The key advantage therefore\nthat most Big Data databases hold over traditional\nrespondent surveys files is that they contain informa-\ntion on a larger number of cases, the information is\nmore up to date and is typically more granular. For\nmany researchers a further advantage of Big Data is\nthat it delivers information about revealed behaviour\nrather than stated preferences.\nIt is argued that by failing to broaden their meth-\nodological tool kit the practice of social scientists and\npolicy analysts stands apart from that of commercial\norganizations. Almost all the largest commercial organ-\nisations now accept the strictures of management con-\nsultants such as Peppers and Rogers (2003) that a\ncritical source of competitive advantage lies in the\neffectiveness with which a company uses transactional\ninformation to understand customer needs. This, they\nargue, can only be achieved through the creation of\nlarge data repositories. The purpose of the Savage\nand Burrows paper was to describe what, by compari-\nson with the commercial sector, constitutes a compara-\ntive failure to adapt to these new opportunities. The\npaper did not set out to provide an explanation for\nthis failure.\nOf course Big Data will never entirely replace the\nfindings of questionnaire-based surveys. The challenge\nto the social sciences is to find an appropriate balance.\nThough one can argue about what constitutes an\nappropriate balance, in 2007, the year the Savage and\nBurrows paper was published, there was little evidence\nof social scientific researchers being among the van-\nguard of Big Data users. The situation today has not\nchanged markedly. The high level of interest that the\npaper generated has had only a moderate impact on the\nusage of Big Data notwithstanding the exhortations of\nfunding bodies such as the Economic and Social\nResearch Council (ESRC) and the contents of follow\nup papers such as Uprichard et al. (2009).\nIn our view, the explanation for the modest impact\nof the paper on the culture of research practice is not\nthat the intended audience of social scientists did not\nhear or did not understand its message. More likely\nexplanations lie in the inter-connection of cultural prac-\ntices, institutions and assumptions which characterise\nthe organisational structures in which different cate-\ngories of potential user operate. Institutional challenges\ninclude the obstacles involved in gaining access to the\ntypically commercially sensitive, proprietary databases\ncontrolled by privately owned companies for whom the\ndata is a valuable asset \u00ad witnessed by competition to\nacquire the Tesco club card subsidiary Dunn Humby,\nthe challenges that fragmented research communities\ncan have in mobilising the resources to store and\nmanipulate databases of great size and complexity\nand, as we explain later, the shorter time horizons\nover which researchers' investment in new modes of\nanalysis need to be amortised given the length of time\nfor which the projects or research teams in which they\nwork are funded.\nCultural explanations (by which we mean the norms\nof accepted academic practice) include the current pri-\nvileging of explanation over description, assumptions\nregarding the salience of causation, verifiability and\n2 Big Data & Society\nthe importance of theory and concepts. These practices\nare reflected, for example, in the statistical techniques\nwhich students are taught and tend to rely on, the cri-\nteria by which grant applications are evaluated and the\nyardsticks by which the output of institutional research\nis judged. A further and fundamental contrast with\n`mainstream' social science involves the way in which\nthe latter often proceeds through the use of the `com-\nparative method' (across for example time, space or\ndifferent cultures) and the analysis of social change.\nIn commercial applications relatively greater attention\nis given to evidence and less to theory and what con-\nceptualised originate from the use of data are likely to\nbe treated as commercially sensitive. Crudely put, the\nacademic community relies on traditional methods as a\ncommon currency by which the richness or otherwise of\nits research endeavours can be evaluated on a peer\nbasis.\nContrary to the presumption of Thrift (2005) that\ncapitalism finds no difficulty in exploiting Big Data\nfor commercial advantage, an analogous debate can\nbe found in the journals of the commercial market\nresearch industry (Mouncey, 2014). Here it is asserted\nthat mainstream market research companies, notwith-\nstanding their expertise in how to interpret the output\nof social surveys and present its implications for cor-\nporate strategy, have consistently failed to apply these\nskills to the analysis of ``Big Data''. This emerging\nmarket has therefore been left open to exploitation by\nspecialist data analytics businesses many of whose\nfounders' careers were built from expertise in statistics\nand information technology rather than in social scien-\ntific research.\nWhen considering the potential evidence value of Big\nData as compared with traditional survey sources, it is\nimportant to recognise a key dilemma faced by the\nresearcher. That is how to reconcile the competing\nadvantage of a rich source of behavioural evidence\nwith a comprehensive array of key demographic\nclassifications.\nIn comparison with sample surveys such as the\nGeneral Household Survey (GHS), Big Data datasets\ntend to contain a proportionately greater wealth of\nbehavioural data but at the cost of much less rich\ndemographic content. This difference results not from\nthe intrinsic characteristic of Big Data datasets. It is not\nnecessarily that they are ``big'' or that they are differ-\nently structured from other forms of data, though they\noften are, but that they involve the secondary use of\ndata collected intentionally or ostensibly for some other\npurpose. The predominant sources of this by-product\ndata are transactional processing systems, often\nupdated remotely, digitally and in real time in which\nthere is no baseline data or anchoring in categories of\nsocio economic status (SES) such as occupation,\nethnicity and marital status. Such systems might be\nones that process customer orders, maintain the finan-\ncial balances in customer accounts or enable digital\nconnectivity, for instance through delivering access to\nwebsites, engaging with social media, enabling tele-\nphone traffic or providing information on spatial loca-\ntion. Increasingly the data is also collected intentionally\nfrom applications whose primary use provides ``permis-\nsion'' for its secondary use. Either way, they arguably\ngenerate much richer sources of behavioural data than\nsurvey questionnaires. However given that an organisa-\ntion's customer/client insight team does not by defin-\nition have ultimate control over what information is\ncontained within a Big Data database, analysts are\nrestricted to accessing whatever data fields were speci-\nfied as necessary for the efficient processing of the trans-\nactional system. In most cases these fields do not\ninclude measures of class, age, ethnicity or gender.\nFor the academic social scientist the absence of these\nfields is likely to constitute a major obstacle since, as a\ngeneral rule, these classifications are the basis on which\nmuch social scientific theory and hence explanation has\nbeen developed. For analysts in commercial organisa-\ntions this is much less problematic since the theoretical\nconcepts on the basis of which businesses make deci-\nsions are to a much greater extent developed around the\nrelationship of one behaviour to another, not the rela-\ntionship of behaviour to demographics. Whereas aca-\ndemic researchers may be more likely to use constructs\nin the form of general rules, commercial researchers\ntend to use constructs which are specific to individual\nindustrial sectors or even individual businesses.\nDemographic details such as age and gender may of\ncourse be collected via a parallel system such as the\napplication processing system for a loyalty card.\nWhere this is not the case social scientific research usu-\nally has an interest in finding a method of inferring\nthem from other data fields that are available or in\nusing proxies for them.\nThis is where the new generic taxonomies play a par-\nticularly useful role and why the increasing use of Big\nData has resulted in their growing use as alternatives to\ntraditional taxonomies. Measures of neighbourhood\ntype and cultural background can be appended to any\nBig Data dataset that contains a customer/client name\nand address. This can be done quickly, cheaply, retro-\nspectively or in real time, unobtrusively and without the\ndistorting effects of high levels of non-response (Harris\nTaxonomies enabled by Big Data\nAccepting that the proprietary nature of its content\nconstitutes a barrier that restricts access to Big Data\ndatasets by the wider research community, in this\nWebber et al. 3\nsection of the paper we consider it useful4 to examine\nthe cultural and institutional constraints on the adop-\ntion of Big Data within the more restricted frame of\nnew generic taxonomies derived from Big Data. In par-\nticular, we consider the origins, data sources and meth-\nods used to build these classifications, the commercial\norganisations that deliver them and the role they play in\nthe analysis of Big Data sets. This particular segment of\nthe world of Big Data is referred to, but not explicitly\ndifferentiated, by Savage and Burrows (2007). It is of\nparticular relevance to the wider discussion on the\nadoption of Big Data since in this particular segment\nneither cost nor proprietary ownership constitutes a\nsignificant barrier to use. We define this segment as\nthe relatively new generic taxonomies such as the geo-\ndemographic classification systems Acorn and Mosaic\nand the ethno-cultural classification system Origins.\nMosaic and Acorn are taxonomies which enable cus-\ntomers/clients/citizens to be classified into some 60 or\nso standard categories according to the type of residen-\ntial neighbourhood in which they live. Origins is a\ntaxonomy which uses personal and family names to\ninfer a person's most likely ethno-cultural heritage.\nThis classification system uses a complex set of rules\nwhich place individuals into the most appropriate one\nof some 200 different categories.\nWhilst very early versions of Acorn and Mosaic were\nconstructed solely using census statistics, the versions of\nthese taxonomies in current use have been constructed\nusing access to a variety of Big Data sources. Their\nvalue to commercial and social research is that from\nthe name and postcode field on a Big Data dataset it\nis possible to append both neighbourhood type and\ninferred heritage. Using these taxonomies as the axes\nin tabulations makes it possible to analyse behavioural\ndata on different datasets using a consistent basis for\ncomparison. A perceived benefit of these taxonomies to\nthe social sciences is that linked to Big Data they go\nsome way to bridging the `quantitative/qualitative' dis-\ntinction by enabling access to a richness of interpret-\native material that is often beyond the capability of\nconventional statistical analysis. Few investigations of\nsocial behaviour take place without reference to a tax-\nonomy derived from one or more of the categories by\nwhich social class, race, religion, age, gender, geog-\nraphy and household composition are commonly rep-\nresented.5 It is the analysis of behaviour against the\ncategories contained in these taxonomies that provides\nthe evidence against which theories can be tested and\ndeveloped. Inevitably there is a tendency for taxonomic\ncategories of this sort to become institutionalised in the\nform of ``standard'' classification systems. Office of\nNational Statistics (ONS) standard socio-economic\nclasses and ethnic groupings are examples.\nConsistency of categorisation makes it is possible to\ncompare cross-tabulations sourced from independently\ncollected behavioural databases.\nBig Data poses a challenge to such taxonomies and\nthey to it. It is easy to overlook the fact that the prac-\ntices by which people are categorised according to their\nsocial class and ethnic origin were developed in an\nenvironment where the survey was the principal\nmethod of collecting behavioural information.6 To\npractitioners familiar only with the use of social surveys\nas a source of quantitative evidence it is not necessarily\napparent that such taxonomies are often not practical\nor, if they can be obtained, not necessarily optimal in a\nBig Data environment. Likewise the proxies for class\nand ethnicity which it is possible to apply in a Big Data\nenvironment are not necessarily characteristics which\nusers of survey questionnaires would find it easy to\nadopt without an investment of time and concentra-\ntion, both of which may be in short supply.\nTaxonomies designed for use in survey research,\nwhilst designed to be predictive of differences in behav-\niour, have necessarily been designed in a form which\ncaters for the practicalities of the questionnaire as a\ndata gathering instrument. Respondents tick the box\nwhich matches their age band and gender and, from\nthe occupation and the country of origin that they\nwrite in, the survey administrator uses look-up tables\nto translate occupations into social classes and coun-\ntries of origin into standard ONS ethnic groupings.\nMulti-variate taxonomies such as Mosaic, Acorn and\nOrigins work in a quite different way. Given that Big\nData repositories are rich on behavioural information\nbut light on conventional demographics, they are more\nlikely to employ complex grouping algorithms, based\non fuzzy logic and implemented using various forms of\ncluster analysis. Customers / citizens are then organized\ninto ``natural'' classes on the basis of multiple attributes\ncrossing a number of different domains.\nThe sense in which these classes are ``natural''\n(as opposed to ``purposive'') is that the categories are\ndeliberately not created in such a way as to reflect pre-\nexisting theoretical representations of social structure.\nThey are what most social scientists would therefore\ncharacterise as `empiricist constructs'. It would be\nodd if there were no correspondence between their nat-\nural clusters and the categories of traditional taxo-\nnomies but ultimately such correspondence is\nincidental rather than designed. Since most social sci-\nentific theory is based on constructs of which con-\nventional taxonomies are designed to be the\nrepresentations, a frequent criticism of ``commercial''\nsociology by academic social scientists is that it uses\nconcepts that are a-theoretical,7 that they have little\nmore than descriptive value and that they have little\nto offer by way of causal explanation. To this consumer\nmarketing analysts reply that the new generic\n4 Big Data & Society\ntaxonomies provide a more effective source of causal\nexplanation than single dimensional constructs that\nare inherently difficult to link to behavioural informa-\ntion and that the apparent lack of development of\ncausal theory in commercial organisations cannot be\npresumed solely from the absence of papers authored\nby commercial practitioners in academic journals.\nAnother key distinguishing attribute of taxonomies\narising from ``Big Data'' is that they are multi-variate\nby contrast with most (though not all8) taxonomies\nagainst which survey behaviour is tabulated. On\ngrounds of practicality these tend to be built from a\nsingle criterion as respondents necessarily find it diffi-\ncult to operate a complex rule set involving multiple\ncriteria.9\nWhere different fields of a questionnaire are com-\nbined, as for example with indices of deprivation, the\nderived taxonomy is typically created by summing\nscores on data variables each of which acts as a surro-\ngate for a more general and less easily defined syn-\ndrome, deprivation. This contrasts with the practice\nof defining categories using permutations of values\nfrom variables from different domains (such as families\nwith children without a car).10 Thus one would expect a\nclustering of retail loyalty card-holders based on previ-\nous purchasing history to produce a set of natural clus-\nters which can be interpreted partly but not exclusively\nin terms of age, income and family composition. One\nwould also expect the categories to be differentiated in\nterms of take up of promotional offers, use of own-label\nversus manufacturer brands and frequency of shop\nvisits. The manner in which these clusters are described\nwould align more closely with the language used\nby qualitative researchers (or even political strat-\negists) than with the language of professional\ndemographers.\nA common application of Big Data is to build\nbespoke taxonomies which segment an organization's\nown customers or clients on the basis of transactional\ninformation. In this instance, it may be less important\nfor the categories to be comparable with widely used\nclassifications than would be the case in an academic\nsocial scientific or public sector application; the organ-\nization concerned may place little value on the added\ntheoretical understanding of the sort that would be\nobtained by aligning the individual classes with pro-\nfessionally accepted standards. Nevertheless there are\ncontexts in which commercial organizations benefit\nfrom using generic taxonomies recognised as standard\nby the syndicated industry databases that they sub-\nscribe to, such as the National Readership Survey\nand the British Market Research Bureau's Target\nGroup Index.\nThe complementary relationship between user spe-\ncific and generic industry-accepted taxonomies is nicely\nillustrated by the behaviour of retail banks many of\nwhom place customers into the categories resulting\nfrom the bespoke taxonomies they build using previous\ncustomer behaviour. In such a taxonomy it is likely that\nat least one cluster will be characterised by customers\nwho have tended to prove unresponsive to the promo-\ntion of new financial products. When this bespoke tax-\nonomy is further segmented on the basis of the\ncategories of a generic taxonomy the bank's insight\nteam is now likely to be able to distinguish between\nthose relatively inactive customers who tend not to\nrespond to promotion because they have little dispos-\nable income from those who are unresponsive because\nthey undertake the majority of their financial transac-\ntions with a competitor or a specialist adviser.\nFor all these reasons, it is unlikely that a generic\ntaxonomy such as Mosaic, Acorn or Origins will pre-\ncisely replicate any of the measures on the basis of\nwhich social scientific theory has been constructed\nand it is not logical to evaluate their validity solely on\nthe basis of how accurately they replicate a traditionally\nasked demographic construct. Their categories are\nexamples of different constructs, seldom as clearly\narticulated as those developed in academia, and\nare designed to be used in different contexts. These\nconstructs have been slower to find their place in aca-\ndemic social scientific than among media and political\nclasses.\nClearly there are contexts where it is too inappropri-\nate or too expensive to obtain from each customer the\ninformation needed to place them in a formal tax-\nonomy of the sort that is used in a survey questionnaire.\nA charity would almost certainly experience a drop in\nthe value of its donations if it asked potential donors\nfor their annual income. A chain of betting shops\nwould receive short shrift from punters if they were\nasked their religion or ethnic identity. In contexts\nsuch as these it is more practical for an organization\nto make use of one of the Big Data derived classifica-\ntions that are marketed by information service pro-\nviders as alternatives to class and ethnic origin.\nLinking an externally built classification system to\none's own customer records is possible only if the two\nhave access to a common match key. In contexts where\ngoods have to be delivered or bills posted no-one\nobjects to providing a supplier with a record of their\nname and address.11 As a result the various compo-\nnents of a person's name and address are the fields on\ncustomer files which are most often used as match keys\nused for appending generic classifications.\nThe various elements of a person's name and address\nprovide a surprisingly rich range of material on the\nbasis of which inferences can be made. Many\nwomen's marital status can be inferred from whether\nthey style themselves as Mrs, Miss or Ms. Gender can\nWebber et al. 5\nbe predicted with a 90% or greater accuracy from\nthe personal name. Particular personal names, such as\nIvy and Wayne, are associated with particular gener-\nations and socio-economic backgrounds. Personal\nand family names, such as Mohammed or Van Dijk,\noften indicate ethnic origin, language, religion or\ndenomination.\nThe postcode field provides perhaps the most valu-\nable source of information since, even in the era of\nsocial media, the social influences to which people are\nlikely to be exposed are typically a function of the\ndemographics of the immediate neighbourhood in\nwhich they and their families live. All these inferences\nare examples of the potential value of by-product data\ngenerated as a result of the operational requirement to\ncapture name and address for the purposes of delivery\nand/or billing.\nNames and postcodes are the two elements of the\nname and address which most lend themselves to the\nconstruction of serviceable taxonomies. Postcodes are\nthe units of geography now used by Experian, CACI\nand other vendors of geodemographic classifications.12\nThese classifications make use of over 200 different\nmeasurements, derived from official, administrative\nand census sources, resulting in each postcode being\nassigned to the most appropriate one of 60 or more\ngeodemographic categories. By analogy Origins is a\nsystem which associates each record contained in an\norganization's name and address file with one of 200\nethno-cultural backgrounds. A Big Data database con-\ntaining the personal and family names of 600 million\ndifferent adults was used to build this classification\nsystem.\nWhen used in combination with the software that\nappends them to customer / citizen files, taxonomies\nof this sort offer a variety of attractions. They provide\na very fast and inexpensive method of categorising very\nlarge numbers of customer or citizen records. They are\nnon-intrusive. Their match rate of over 99% means that\nthe validity of results is not compromised by uneven\nresponse rates.13 The categorisation is consistent, can\nbe updated on a regular basis and is independent of the\ncontext or the operation of the classification process. It\npermits consistent comparison between analyses of dif-\nferent datasets and at different times and, in respect of\nethnicity, a consistent set of categories irrespective of\nthe countries where the names have been collected.14\nIt is thought that postcode classifications are used by\nthe majority of UK15 organizations with databases con-\ntaining information on two million or more customer\naddress records. Because geodemographic classifica-\ntions have been appended to respondent data for each\nof the most widely used market research surveys\nresearchers can examine their predictive power across\nmany thousands of behaviours. On balance the level of\nthis discriminatory power is broadly similar to that of\nstandard measures of social grade. Qualitative field-\nworkers such as Butler and Robson (2003) have\nreported a very close correspondence between their\nown impressions of the character of communities\nwhere they have conducted research and the portraits\nused by geodemographic classifications to describe\npostcodes within their study areas. Indeed given the\ngranularity of the postcode system, with over\n1.4 million geographical pieces, and the 60 or so differ-\nent classifications that a taxonomy usually identifies, it\nwould be surprising if a natural taxonomy of neigh-\nbourhoods based on the resources of Big Data could\nnot provide a much more fine grained and accurate\ndescription of a neighbourhood than any metric based\non a single-dimensional domain.\nTo a large degree, this results from the freedom of\ncomputer algorithms to create natural clusters which\nare unconstrained by constructs derived from pre-exist-\ning theory and from the use of a single theoretical\ndimension. The Mosaic label ``Liberal Opinion'' is a\ngood example. It was coined to describe neighbour-\nhoods characterised by, among other things: large num-\nbers of recent graduates, particularly in the humanities;\nliving in privately rented purpose-built or converted\nflats; low levels car ownership; low child populations,\nespecially among school age cohorts; many children\nborn to mothers in their 30s.\nNo single demographic dimension would be capable\non its own of identifying this type of neighbourhood, or\nwhat, in Bourdieu's terminology, can be described as a\n``milieu''. It is our contention that academic social sci-\nence and commercial sociology can come together fruit-\nfully when focusing on emergent social groupings such\nas this. New generic classifications built from Big Data\nshould be able to provide greater nuance to terms such\nas `new urban middle class' or even `gentrifier' as well\nas locate them in space and enable their purchasing\npreferences to be recorded.\nThat a category such as ``Liberal Opinion'' does have\ninherent validity is evidenced by the results of the ana-\nlyses of market research surveys to which Mosaic codes\nhave been appended. These identify diagnostic behav-\niours such as frequent foreign holidays especially to off-\nbeat locations, early adoption of new personal digital\ntechnologies, extensive use of restaurants and coffee\nshops, heavy readership of newspapers and on-line\nmedia channels, frequent visits to cinemas, theatres\nand exhibitions and support for environmental and\ninternational charities. In the 2010 General Election\nConservative candidates achieved consistently lower\nthan average swings in constituencies with the highest\nproportion of electors in this type of neighbourhood.\nThe downside of using such a taxonomy is that the clus-\nters are re-optimised at least every time the results of a\n6 Big Data & Society\nnew census are published. This makes it particularly dif-\nficult to undertake temporal comparison.\nThe ability of a taxonomy based on multi-variate\ncriteria to create more meaningful categories than one\nbased on a single survey question is equally relevant to\nthe classification of people by ethno-cultural back-\nground. Clearly there needs to be some method of rec-\nording a person's heritage. But is that best obtained by\nasking them their religion, their country of birth, their\nethnicity, their self-identification, the country where\ntheir parents were born or when they entered the\nUK? Each of these questions has appeared on a post\nwar British census but we contend that no single ques-\ntion on its own provides an optimal basis for a general\npurpose taxonomy which will maximise discrimination\nwhen comparing the behaviours of members of minor-\nity communities.\nOrigins operates at a variety of levels of granularity.\nAt the coarse level the natural categories are interpreted\nfrom the overlap of race (or colour), religion and geog-\nraphy. The natural grouping ``Muslim'' includes Black\nAfricans with predominantly Muslim names. Detailed\ncategories such as Fijians and people of Indian descent\nfrom Surinam would be placed in the same general\ngrouping as people with ``Hindu or Sikh'' names who\nare geographically South Asian. East Asian is a group\nprimarily distinguished on the basis of geographical\nlocation whilst ``White'' and ``Black'' are distinguished\nprimarily on the basis of appearance.\nWhen the Origins classification was built the inten-\ntion was not to create a taxonomy incorporating reli-\ngion and language as well as race. However the\noptimisation algorithm used to build the taxonomy cre-\nated a number of categories which could be effectively\ninterpreted only by using all three of these dimensions.\nFeatures of new taxonomies that\ninfluence potential users\nIn order to understand differences in the speed of adop-\ntion of these new generic taxonomies it is important to\nundertake a brief summary of some of their key fea-\ntures which differentiate them from traditional classifi-\ncations and which are relevant to potential users.\nFor some potential users these differences present no\nhindrance to adoption. Indeed for some applications\nand user categories these differences represent clear\nadvantages. For other potential user groups these fea-\ntures may be off-putting.\nWhen business planners in commercial organisations\nsuch as Experian or CACI evaluate the market poten-\ntial for a new segmentation system their evaluations\nwould typically take into account an inventory of\npotential applications which are then assessed in\nterms of potential impact and hence potential return\nthrough sales. At this stage in the product cycle these\nprojections are likely to be based on an assessment of\npotential benefits to different user groups, it being dif-\nficult to gauge the extent to which factors (including\nthose which we have broadly termed institutional and\ncultural earlier in the paper) are likely to influence the\nrate and level of adoption in different areas of\napplication.\nIn due course the deployment of the sales team is\nadjusted on the basis of where it is easiest to win new\nbusiness. Any variance between the sectors of antici-\npated and actual usage is typically explained by the\nmanagement of the sales force in terms of the rational-\nity or irrationality of actors or even their levels of intel-\nligence and insight. Uneven adoption is not interpreted\nin terms of the differences of perceptions and expect-\nations that result from differences in culture and organ-\nisational structure.\nIn the following section we set out the key features of\nthese classifications which contribute to differential\nrates of adoption among different potential user\ngroups. These features are discussed under seven head-\nings as follows.\na. Actionability\nThe characteristic commonly used to justify the\nadoption of geodemographic classification in the com-\nmercial sector is its ``actionability''. Whilst it was per-\nfectly practical for a media buyer to select advertising\nslots on commercial television channels on the basis of\nwhether the social class and age of a programme's audi-\nence matched that of a brand's users, social class and\nage could not be used to target contact channels such as\ndirect mail, door to door distribution, tele-marketing or\ncustomer mailings which, by their very nature, have\nmuch greater potential for reaching finely-grained audi-\nence segments.\nFor these channels, taxonomies based on names and\naddresses proved more ``actionable'' since these com-\nmunications channels could be targeted right down to\nthe person, household or street (postcode) level. The\nuse of such communication channels is not confined\nto commercial organizations. Charities, political parties\n(Webber, 2006) and a number of government organiza-\ntions regularly use these channels to communicate with\ncitizens and Big Data based taxonomies have been\nproved as popular with them as with the marketing\ndepartments of commercial organizations.\nMaximising the precision of targeting is a more\npressing objective for people involved in ``direct'' mar-\nketing and the use of generic geodemographic taxo-\nnomies for behavioural analysis tends to be restricted\nto the identification of the market segments that gener-\nate most profitable response to communications.\nWebber et al. 7\nb. Perceived purposes\nPeople who work in academic and not for profit\norganizations can harbour feelings towards the taxo-\nnomies of commercial organizations that range from\nmild scepticism to ideological hostility \u00ad and of\ncourse this is a two way street with commercial sociolo-\ngists declaiming their academic colleagues as not living\nin the same world. Common objections are that the\nconstruction of these products is not methodologically\nrigorous, that build processes are not transparent and\nthat the purposes for which they were designed are not\naligned with the requirements of social research. Many\nof those who have been exposed to generic taxonomies\nbuilt from Big Data are unaware that the methods used\nto build geodemographic and ethno-cultural taxo-\nnomies originated within the public sphere.\nThe methodology currently used to build geodemo-\ngraphic classifications is largely based on that developed\nduring the Liverpool inner city deprivation study spon-\nsored by the Department of the Environment, Planning\nResearch Applications Group (PRAG) (1975), the\nobjective of which was to differentiate neighbourhoods\non the basis of their different manifestations of depriv-\nation. Cummins et al. (1999) explain how tables that\ninfer ethnicity from names were first built by officers of\nBradford City Council with the aim of improving access\nto public service by people of South Asian origin.\nThe concern that the methods are unacceptably lack-\ning in transparency undoubtedly results in part from\nthe difficulty academic social scientists have in accessing\nthe journals in which papers (such as Webber, 2000)\nwhich describe the methods used to build them have\nbeen published.\nThese are not factors which generally weigh heavily\non the minds of commercial users or the brokers\nbetween academia, politics and the media but they are\npowerful influences in some sections of the academy\nalthough the primary sense of `unease' is the task, gen-\nerally ignored by the developers, of interpreting the\n``natural'' clusters arising from the classification pro-\ncess within the pre-existing theoretical constructs famil-\niar to social scientists. A secondary concern is the\ndifficulty of undertaking time series comparisons\ngiven that the taxonomies change every 10 years.\nSome of these concerns are expanded on in the follow-\ning section.\nc. Evaluation of methodology through independent\nreplication\nIt is often held that taxonomies based on Big Data\nare not susceptible to independent replication. The abil-\nity to replicate findings based on free access to data sets\nis a central tenet of research in the natural sciences\nwhere it is arguably easier to control for external con-\nditions than it is in the social sciences. In the social\nsciences it is reasonable to suppose that replicability is\nmore relevant where an objective of much research\nwork is to demonstrate causal connections or where\nmathematical models are used to generate future\nscenarios.\nWhere geodemographics are used for description,\nreplicability is less relevant. As a rule differences in the\nmethodologies used to build classifications have some\nbut very little impact on the extent to which different\nclassifications can predict variations in behaviour.16\nThe concern with verification cannot be considered\nother than in the context of a belief in whether or not\nthere is a truthful representation which it is the object-\nive of research methods to try to replicate. If such a\nbelief is not held any solution is necessarily viewed as\nthe product of subjective assessment.\nCommercial organizations, which are primarily con-\ncerned with the ability of technology to deliver per-\nformance objectives, tend to focus less energy on\nmethodological verification than on tests to determine\nwhether a new taxonomy will outperform those taxo-\nnomies currently used to support key business pro-\ncesses. Confronted with such a classification for the\nfirst time commercial users like to enter their home\npostcodes and check whether the geodemographic por-\ntrait matches their impression of their neighbourhood.\nResearchers are more likely to want to ask questions\nabout methods and motivations although anecdotally\nmany academic researchers do precisely the same in\nterms of entering their home postcodes and those of\nclose friends. For the commercial user the reputation\nof the product and of its vendor are of paramount influ-\nence. The quality of documentation, support and ancil-\nlary consultancy are also critical buying considerations.\nd. Definition or description\nAn inherent problem with a taxonomy which is\nbased on multiple domains is how best to label its cate-\ngories. This is particularly an issue for natural rather\nthan a bespoke classification. Tensions necessarily exist\nbetween whether labels should aim for a precise defin-\nition or a memorable and insightful description.\nA recurring complaint of some members of the aca-\ndemic research community is the subjective and impre-\ncise character of the labels used. Quantitative\nresearchers, in particular, tend to dislike the way in\nwhich Mosaic and Acorn labels limit themselves to 20\ncharacters. This limitation is often assumed to follow\nfrom a desire to satisfy the requirements of commercial\nusers. Such labels tend to resonate better with qualita-\ntive or mixed mode researchers. By contrast commer-\ncial users prefer to use labels such as ``Global\n8 Big Data & Society\nConnections'' which are descriptive, easy to understand\nand to remember and not overly precise. Their use\ncomes more naturally to those who work in advertising\nagencies and the media who are accustomed to the need\nto distil the findings of focus groups into tag lines such\nas ``Worcester Woman'' or ``White Van Territory''\nwhich are understandable to their clients.\nWhilst clearly it is possible to define categories in\nformal classifications such as ``persons aged 45\u00ad64'' or\n``South Asians'' in few characters, it is impossible to\ncreate succinct definitions of complex multi-dimen-\nsional categorisations. Indeed multi-dimensional classi-\nfications by their very nature challenge the disposition\nof those for whom exactitude of measurement may be a\nmore important consideration than deeper understand-\ning of a complex world.\nFor the commercial user an important consideration\nis to be able to identify and attach labels to groups such\nas ``Caring Professionals'' or ``Coronation Street'' which\nare often subjectively felt to exist but which are other-\nwise difficult to define and for which specific modes of\ncommunication are believed to be appropriate.\nFor qualitative academic researchers the appeal of\nthe finer grained categories produced by a natural\ngrouping is that they may be able to sharpen the spatial\nand theoretical definition of concepts already current in\nsocial research. To them labels such as ``New Urban\nColonists'' or ``Summer Playgrounds'' are not just\ntarget groups that can be reached on the ground but\nphysical conceptualisation of social processes which,\nbecause they are difficult to represent in the form of a\nsurvey questionnaire, are difficult to pin down in prac-\ntice. They offer an opportunity to overcome a dilemma\nwhich many academic social scientists struggle with,\nthat of integrating the social and the spatial.\nA good example is the choice of the Mosaic label\n``Alpha Territory'' for the name of an ESRC funded\nresearch project which investigates the impact of\nLondon's increasingly global population of supposedly\nfootloose, ultra-high net worth residents on patterns of\nassociation among elite London neighbourhoods\n(Burrows, 2013). It could legitimately be complained\nthat the term ``Alpha'' has no formal meaning is\nsocial research. Nevertheless it is an example of a\nterm that is both economical and efficient in denoting\na group of very high achievers who are strongly ori-\nented towards delivery, whose culture is dismissive of\nanything that is sub-standard in quality or performance\nand whose language regularly borrows from the termin-\nology of global capital.\ne. Multi-dimensionality\nThe persisting popularity of indices of deprivation\nand of school league tables suggests the preference of\nthe UK political elite for one-dimensional ranking over\nmulti-dimensional classification. The predilection for\ngood\u00adbad rankings is even more evident in the pages\nof the British Sunday papers. In this context it is ironic\nthat the original justification for the development of\ngeodemographic classifications was to identify the dif-\nferent types of deprived neighbourhood for which dif-\nferent policy interventions would be appropriate. This\nwas intended to replace a policy under which all prior-\nity area funding was channelled to the same ``worst''\nareas, irrespective of whether or not the programmes\nwere appropriate to their needs.17\nAs a general rule marketers, whether in the commer-\ncial or public sector, are much more focused on seg-\nmentation than academic social scientists, policy people\nand journalists. The aim of marketers is to separate\ncustomers into discrete groupings on the basis of differ-\nences in needs and motivations and then improve effi-\nciency by tailoring communications to the needs of each\nmarket segment. This approach to customer relation-\nship management is reflected in the form of the metrics\norganizations want to be able to access on their data-\nbases and which they use to track the effectiveness of\ntheir campaigns.\nWhether or not this communication process is\nundertaken by commercial or not for profit organiza-\ntions is less important than people may suppose. One of\nthe earliest types of organization to adopt geodemo-\ngraphic classification were US and UK political parties.\nWhilst many constituency MPs wax lyrical about\nthe contribution these systems can make to their\nre-election, it seldom occurs to them that the very\nsame tools could be equally effective in improving the\ntargeting of public services communications to their\nconstituents.\nf. Systematic bias\nA key consideration of any taxonomy is whether its\nclasses contain any systematic bias in relation to behav-\nioural variables against which they may be analysed.\nThis is particularly relevant in two respects. Where\nerrors are random it is usually safe to use a taxonomy\nfor measuring and comparing distributions of a popu-\nlation by classes of that taxonomy. It also suggests that\nthe use of classes within a taxonomy to model behav-\nioural outcomes is likely to be reasonably accurate. For\nexample, it is statistically accepted that different social\nclasses have different propensities to vote Conservative\nor Labour in a UK general election. Let us suppose that\nthese different propensities were uniform throughout\ntowns and cities of the United Kingdom. In this case\nwe might reasonably suppose that it would be possible\nto predict the Conservative and Labour shares of the\nvote in each parliamentary constituency simply by\nWebber et al. 9\nmultiplying the proportions of its electorate in each\nsocial class by the national propensity of each social\nclass to vote Conservative or Labour.\nIt might surprise many to learn that on the basis of\nthis arithmetic the Conservative party would not have\nwon a single one of the 165 seats it won in the UK\ngeneral election of 1997. The reason is that in upper\nclass neighbourhoods, upper class electors are more\nlikely to vote Conservative than where they are in a\nminority and vice versa. The social class of your neigh-\nbours provides as good an ability to predict how you\nwill vote as does your own social class and one which is\nmore uniform in its predictive power in different types\nof constituency. Likewise it has been shown by Webber\n(1975) that although the level of unemployment in\nLiverpool in the 1970s was far lower among workers\nwho were professionals or managers than among\nunskilled workers, a professional or manager living in\na neighbourhood of inner city council flats was more\nlikely to be unemployed than an unskilled worker living\nin a prosperous suburban neighbourhood.\nThese are just two examples of individual behaviour\nbeing subject to neighbourhood effects, replicated in\ncountless other studies \u00ad in other words, the behaviour\nof immediate neighbours affects the behaviour of the\nindividual. In these two cases it would appear either\nthat what we define as a ``Professional or Manager''\nconceals multiple different sub-populations or other-\nwise that professionals and managers behave in system-\natically different ways according to where they live.\nThere is systematic bias, in this case by type of\nneighbourhood.\nLogically it would be reasonable to suppose that\nthe categories created by a natural classification,\nwhich is constructed using a wide array of different\ninput variables and where no single one dominates\nthe clustering algorithm, will be much less subject to\nthis sort of systematic bias than traditional classifica-\ntions which are defined using the response to a single\nsurvey question. This goes some way to explain one of\nthe attractions of neighbourhood classifications to\nretail multiples who need a reliable method of estimat-\ning likely levels of demand for different products and\nservices in the catchment areas of locations where they\nmight open a new store. Since the propensity of dif-\nferent geodemographic types to consume different\nproducts is readily available from syndicated survey\nsources and since the distribution of Mosaic types\nwithin particular catchment areas is also known, a\nbasic model which multiplies purchasing propensities\nin each Mosaic type by the proportion of the catch-\nment area that they represent will provide an estima-\ntion of local levels of product demand relatively free\nfrom systematic error.\ng. Self-identification\nComparing taxonomies arising from Big Data and\nthe formal classifications designed for use in survey\nquestionnaires throws up interesting tensions regarding\nthe role of self-identification and ascription in the cat-\negorisation process. A significant number of academic\ncommentators express mild concern at the practice of\nassigning an ethno-cultural classification to subjects in\na database thereby denying them the opportunity (or\nindeed right) to specify their own self-identity. This\nraises a number of interesting questions. If it is right\nfor the individual to select the ethnic origin that he or\nshe identifies with, should not that right apply in the\ncase of social class? And should we define areas of mul-\ntiple deprivation on the basis of asking people whether\nthey feel they or their near neighbours are deprived?\nIn contexts where either class or ethnicity is used as a\nbasis for analysing citizen attitudes and behaviours to\nwhich identity is relevant, such as for example self-\nworth or perceptions of the degree of racial discrimin-\nation within an organisation, this would be a powerful\nargument. However this argument has less power when\none is considering behaviours which are more likely to\nresult from inherited characteristics, such as for exam-\nple the political party a person supports. In these cir-\ncumstances a more effective predictor, if it could be\nconstructed, might be the ethno-cultural category to\nwhich a person's parents belonged.\nPersonal experience has taught us that asking the\nsupermarket check-out operator or the waiter ``what\nare you / where do you come from?'' seldom elicits a\nfavourable response. It is clearly impertinent. However\nit is our experience that posing the question ``where\ndoes your name come from?'' seldom elicits a negative\nresponse. Their name, though seemingly a very\npersonal characteristic, is seen by most people to have\na sufficient independence from their identity that\nits origins can be discussed without trespassing on per-\nsonally sensitive territory. Indeed discussion of the\norigins of the owner's name will often lead to discus-\nsion of quite personal areas of their life history.\nThis distinction is relevant when considering the high\nrate of non-response to ethnic questions by survey\nrespondents as well as to the acceptability of using\nnames as proxies.\nA common response of people when asked whether\nthe portrait of the type of neighbourhood their post-\ncode falls matches their self-perception is that it pro-\nvides only middling accuracy but, however, it is a very\naccurate description of their neighbours. None of us\nparticularly like being put in a box notwithstanding\nthe interest we all have in finding out which box\nothers belong to.\n10 Big Data & Society\nChallenges to existing\nconceptualisations\nIn previous sections we have described the features of\ntaxonomies derived from Big Data which can be\naligned or misaligned with the requirements and cul-\ntures of different groups of potential users. In this sec-\ntion we examine two other problematical characteristics\nof new taxonomies based on Big Data, particularly\nthose which can prove difficult when incorporated\nwithin the traditional conceptualisations which under-\npin social scientific theory.\n(a) Timescales of inherited characteristics\nWhen formal and Big Data derived taxonomies pro-\nduce two apparently inconsistent classifications of the\nsame individual, many researchers understandably pre-\nsume that any discrepancy must be due to error of some\nkind. In practice these inconsistencies can often be\nexplained by the period of time over which the influence\nof inheritance decays.\nAccording to the results of the 2011 census few large\nEnglish cities have a smaller proportion of people who\ndeclared themselves as Irish than Middlesbrough.\nHowever Middlesbrough is close to top on the ranking\nof English cities by proportion of inhabitants with Irish\nsurnames. The reason for this paradox is that family\nnames indicate distant heritage, in the case of\nMiddlesbrough a heritage some four or five generations\nback, whereas self-identity, as recorded in the census, is\na more forward-looking definition, often corresponding\nto the culture the respondent aspires to belong to or\nwith which she or he identifies.\nThe extent to which it is distant ascribed inheritance\nor current self-identification that is more predictive of\nbehaviour will vary from behaviour to behaviour. An\nexample of distant heritage being more predictive of\nattitudes than self-identification is the source of support\nfor an independent Scotland. Despite 10% of Scottish\nresidents bearing Irish Catholic surnames the pro-\nportion who self-identify as Irish is just 1%. YouGov\nsurvey results show the 10% of Scottish residents with\nIrish Catholic surnames to be more supportive of\nScottish independence than people with Scottish sur-\nThis example nicely illustrates a number of issues\nrelevant to the conceptualisation of ethnic or religious\nclassification. First, as has been long known to US pol-\niticians, that historically distant heritage can continue\nto have a very real impact on present behaviour. In\nother words the influence of heritage on behaviour\ncan decay very slowly. The second is that the number\nof respondents who self-identify with their distant heri-\ntage may be far smaller than the number whose\nbehaviour is influenced by it, in the case of the Scots\nIrish 10 times. Taking into account these two factors it\nis evident that the group of people who claim a particu-\nlar identity, in this case Scottish, can easily conceal very\nimportant behavioural distinctions, in this case to sup-\nport an Independent Scotland (Phillips, 2014).\nEthno-cultural background does not correspond\nexactly with self-identity. The two represent different\ncomponents of ethnicity.\n(b) The use of proxies\nGiven their entrenched use and institutional accept-\nance, it is understandable that what were originally\nintended as indicative proxies can over time become\nmistaken for the entities that they were originally sup-\nposed to be indicative of. It is easy for analysts as well\nas researchers to slide into the assumption that there is\na 1:1 correspondence between an ``indicator'' and the\ncharacteristic which it was originally intended to\n``indicate''.\nClass, which is a multi-faceted and nebulous but\nnevertheless a real characteristic (because we know it\ndiscriminates on behaviour), eventually becomes con-\nfused with the occupational classification which was\noriginally intended as a proxy for it. This explains\nwhy class has fallen into so much disfavour in both\ncommercial and academic sociology \u00ad a rare achieve-\nment. Research originators as well as research users\nslide into a reification where metrics are no longer sep-\narate indicators from the complex, multi-faceted con-\ncepts for which they were intended to act as proxies.\nIn such an environment it becomes easy to suppose\nthat any discrepancy between a challenging taxonomy\nand the incumbent proxy is misinterpreted as a source\nof error \u00ad the incumbent has become the reality.\nThis slide is well illustrated by the use of an index of\nmultiple deprivation which, as its name implies, can do\nno more than act as a proxy for whatever deprivations\nlocal residents experience. Once deprivation becomes\nunambiguously identified with its manifestations, local\ncouncillors speak proudly about their wards being in\nthe 10% most deprived in the country when in reality\nthey are in the highest 10% of wards as measured by a\nbundle of proxies for deprivation.\nThis confusion may seem immaterial until we find as\nperspicacious authority of the condition of minority\ncommunities as David Goodhart (2013) argue that a\ndisadvantage experienced by minority ethnic popula-\ntions is that they are more likely than whites to live in\nareas of deprivation when, in practice, this will continue\nto be the case by definition so long as the size of the\nminority population remains one of the indicators used\nin calculating the index.\nA classification of potential users\nIn previous sections we have sought to explain differ-\nential adoption of new taxonomies on the basis of the\nfeatures that differentiate them whether positively or\nnegatively from traditional taxonomies. In this section\nwe believe that it is possible to identify seven broadly\ndifferent characterisations of user or potential user,\neach differing in terms of their likely response to the\nopportunity to make use of generic taxonomies of the\nsort described in this paper.\nHad it been our intention to undertake such\ndistinctions based on an academically rigorous and\nverifiable methodology this would not be possible.\nInstead we have the opportunity to draw on the experi-\nence of the lead author (Webber) who has worked\nwith geodemographic data for 40 years, devising,\npromoting and consulting on the use of Acorn,\nMosaic and Origins by diverse potential user groups.\nOur identification of these types also follows in part\nfrom the consideration of some of the institutional\npractices and cultural preferences described earlier in\n(a) Corporate Information Managers\nOne important group of actors is commonly found\nin large, consumer facing corporates such as banks,\nutilities and retailers who sustain relationships with\ntheir customers via some form of customer account.\nThese can be described as Corporate Information\nManagers. This group also characterises the people\nwho manage the campaign databases used by political\nparties. This group would typically style themselves as\ninformation or insight specialists whose expertise lies\nnot so much in information processing as in informa-\ntion management.\nMuch of the focus of the work of members of this\ngroup involves testing strategies which can deliver\nimprovements in operational performance. Though\nmany will have graduated with a degree in a quantita-\ntive discipline, few would identify themselves primarily\nas social scientists. That is not to say that they do not\nhave a deep interest in citizen' / consumer behaviour. It\nis just that this understanding, if it is conceptualised,\ntends not to use the terminology commonly used\namong members of the academic social science\ncommunity.\nThough members of this group share a belief in a\ncommon set of business precepts, conceptualisations of\ncustomer motivation and behaviour are necessarily spe-\ncific to the particular industrial sector within which they\noperate. They aspire to and often succeed in developing\na holistic, multi-dimensional view of consumers which\nenables them to communicate in a quite nuanced\nmanner using one-to-one communications channels\nsupported by sophisticated campaign management\nsoftware.\nThis group is typically early adopters of taxonomies\narising from Big Data on account of the size of the\ndatabases that they manage, the ease of adding taxo-\nnomies to them and their focus on actionability.\nThough this group may need to apply for permission\nto make major financial investments in new data they\nare seldom required to explain to people outside their\nimmediate team the data and methodologies that they\nuse.\nTheir role is deeply embedded in the organization.\nStability of purpose enables people to adopt a long\nterm perspective.\n(b) Strategic Marketing Advisers\nDistinct from this group are Strategic Marketing\nAdvisors, many of whom work in advertising agencies,\nbrand consultancies and communications agencies.\nThis group of actors is highly focused on the use of\ntaxonomies of consumers, both to identify key audi-\nences for communications programmes and to match\nthe message to the audience. Traditionally this group\nhas ascribed a premium to qualitative description and\nhas focused more heavily than the previous group on\nunderstanding attitudes, values and motivations rather\nthan just propensities to purchase specific products.\nThis group relies heavily on conventional taxonomies\nsuch as class, age and education and is open to the use\nof attitudinal or multi-dimensional categories, such as\nthe ``Worcester Woman'' and ``White Van Man'',\nfavoured by political strategists.\nThe particular interest that this group shows in taxo-\nnomies arising from Big Data is the ability of the labels\nto succinctly describe categories that they consider to be\nrelevant to their clients. This group does not confuse\nproxies with reality. When using a taxonomy it is less\nconcerned than Corporate Information Managers\nabout discriminatory power or actionability than by\nwhether the taxonomy will be accepted among the\ndiverse sets of actors by whom they are paid. Does\nthe taxonomy have a good ``brand'' reputation and\nare the categories instantly intelligible? Another\nimportant characteristic of this group is that most of\nthe projects that its members work on have limited dur-\nation and their involvement with clients, being stra-\ntegic, tends not to extend to the implementation of\ntaxonomies within operational systems.\nBy contrast comparison with the Corporate\nInformation Managers, this group is more likely to\nvalue Big Data based taxonomies for defining the\nbroad segments for the purpose of brand positioning\nand campaign strategy. They tend not to get involved in\nthe systems which drive one-to-one communications.\n12 Big Data & Society\n(c) Early Career Researchers\nWithin the academic research community we can\nalso identify a diverse set of actors most of whom are\nlittle exposed to these forms of classification. For Early\nCareer Researchers, there is potentially a penalty for\nusing new taxonomies especially those that do not\nhave self-evident correspondence to the concepts used\nin established theories and the metrics by which they\nare represented.\nTheir thinking tends to be less bound by the iterative\nprocess of testing and feedback that characterises com-\nmercial consumer insight specialists and, perhaps due\nto their lower levels of direct contact with the subjects\nof their research, it is easier for them to confuse metrics\nwith the realities these metrics were originally intended\nto be proxies for.\nFunding through research grants is dependent on the\njudgement usually of older and more experienced spe-\ncialists many of whom have institutionalised interest in\nthe use of existing taxonomies, not least as a result of\ntheir use in the research outputs that have contributed\nto current theoretical knowledge.\nResearch outputs are constrained by the need to\ncommunicate findings according to particular modes\nof expression and influence is necessarily dependent\non the use of terms whose meaning is clearly under-\nstood. Thus the adoption of alternative classifications\ndoes constitute a significant investment and risk on the\npart of the research practitioner. The risk is that they\nmay not have sufficient knowledge to defend their\nresearch methodologies from the criticism of methodo-\nlogical experts, particularly where literature reviews are\nlikely to be thin and finding citations of acceptable\nrigour will be hard. The upside is that their approach\ncan be seen by their more senior peers as `cutting edge'\nand the associations with the private sector are increas-\ningly regarded as `brownie points' by senior managers.\nDespite these drawbacks isolated individual\nresearchers have pioneered the use of these new taxo-\nnomies in a variety of fields.19\n(d) Researchers favouring quantitative methods\nWithin the academic community there are small but\nimportant sub-groups. One of these, Quantitative\nMethodologists, are actors whose principal interest is\nnot so much in the behavioural patterns that are the\ntraditional object of social scientific study but in\ndeveloping and critiquing statistical methods in their\nown right. Whilst the conduct of this form of research\nclearly has potential advantages in terms of methodo-\nlogical innovation, it is often said that with creating\neffective taxonomies being as much an art as a science\ncompeting methodologies are difficult to critically\nevaluate in the absence of direct experience of the differ-\nent applications to which a taxonomy is likely to be put.\n(e) Researchers favouring mixed mode approaches\nAnother important sub-group is Mixed Mode\nMethodologists, often relatively experienced research-\ners, who combine an interest in quantitative methods\nwith highly specific and localised in-depth qualitative\ninterviews. Geodemographic taxonomies are received\nparticularly favourably by this group since they give\nbroader geographical context to the results of localised\nresearch, provide evidence of whether particular find-\nings are part of a more widespread pattern and help\nidentify other communities where the processes that\nthey have identified are likely to be most apparent.\nThis group is often more comfortable generating\nresearch outputs which are descriptive. The language\nby which they conceptualise processes often conforms\nless precisely to the language of established theory and\nthe categories by which it is otherwise represented. Such\nresearchers often have to be bilingual in terms of facing\ntwo rather different constituencies at the same time.\n(f) Opinion Shapers\nThe network of actors that mediates between the\nacademic community, the media, think tanks, political\nadvisers and civil servants, Opinion Shapers have a\nmore ambivalent attitude towards taxonomies arising\nfrom Big Data. Whilst these actors derive their reputa-\ntion from disseminating ideas which are new, their\ninfluence is constrained by the fact that they are oper-\nating in a world where the recipients of their influence\nare sorely pressed for time.\nGiven that their role is primarily to influence and not\nto execute, a critical requirement of the ideas that they\npromote is that they should be expressed in terms that\nare already understood. Like successful advertising, the\nmessages this group propounds have to be conveyed in\nthe briefest of moments. This pressure contributes to an\nenvironment where it is very difficult to operate other\nthan within conceptual frameworks and taxonomies\nwhich are highly institutionalised. To be effective this\ngroup has to focus on narrative rather than taxonom-\nical detail and on stories involving big absolute num-\nbers rather than relative frequencies.\nHeavy reliance on these institutionalised terminolo-\ngies and the assumption that everyone understands\nwhat is meant by them results in this group being\nprone to equate proxies with realities and can result\nin an institutional complacency where people are\nunwilling to invest the time and effort on new ways of\nseeing the world, however accurately these taxonomies\ncapture current social realities.\n(g) Civil Servants\nGiven the intense focus of Civil Servants on the pref-\nerences and thought processes of their (supposed) pol-\nitical masters, it is understandable why this group of\nactors should be the least receptive of any group to the\nnew taxonomies arising from Big Data. Recruited\nmostly from the humanities rather than from quantita-\ntive disciplines, the culture of this group tends not to\nprioritise direct experience or the analysis of evidence\nfrom primary sources. The evaluation of the effect of\nnewly implemented policies is contracted out to aca-\ndemic researchers and consultants; service delivery is\noutsourced to organizations that have no commercial\ninterest in the use of Big Data and encounters with the\nsubjects to whom public services are delivered is too\ninfrequent to sensitise this group to whether existing\ntaxonomies adequately capture the variety of the con-\ntemporary social world.\nAmong this group it is the policy agenda that drives\nan increasingly tightly prescribed research requirements\nagenda. One can picture the dinner table guests of Sir\nHumphrey Appleby20 \u00ad or even Lord (Gus) O'Donnell\n\u00ad recounting anecdotes to illustrate personal idiosyn-\ncrasies or describing accidental encounters in the\nsocial world (`according to my Colombian cleaning\nlady . . .'), then sharing their experiences of focus\ngroups or imagining smart ways of using administrative\ndata to reduce the reporting burdens under which busi-\nness or the public sector suffer.\nIf members of this group did subscribe to the view of\nPeters and Rogers that information management is a\nprincipal source of competitive advantage, it is ques-\ntionable whether they would apply it to the process of\ndeveloping public policy (partly because they do not\nhave competitors in what they regard as a monopoly\nover policy). When celebrating the creative industries\nand scientific innovation which they claim to be a hall-\nmark of the modern British economy, it is doubtful\nwhether they would suppose that their own ways of\nconceptualising the citizenry could benefit from innov-\nation of this sort.\nConclusion\nThis paper develops the general contention made by\nSavage and Burrows that Big Data can provide insights\ninto social behaviour which are beyond the reach of\ntraditional survey questionnaires. It is our belief that\nit is not helpful to criticise particular groups for not\nmaking greater use of Big Data than they have.\nWhilst we believe that it is not possible to provide a\ntheoretical explanation for the uneven adoption of Big\nData as a whole, we believe it is possible to identify the\nreasons for differential adoption of the generic\ntaxonomies that have been developed principally from\nBig Data sources. We contend that examining the dif-\nferential adoption of this particular form of Big Data is\nuseful since it is one where differences in adoption\nrates cannot be explained either by the data being pro-\nprietary and confidential in nature or by the cost of\naccessing it.\nOn the contrary, we conclude that the uneven adop-\ntion of these taxonomies is better explained by differ-\nences in the circumstances of potential user groups and\nthe relationship that exists between the objectives and\nstandards that guide research practice and the features\nwhich differentiate new taxonomies from traditional\nones, some of which are off-putting to certain groups\nbut attractive to others.\nWe conclude that the adoption of generic taxonomies\nbased on Big Data is likely to be faster in environments\nwhere it is possible to measure improvements in the\nachievement of specific performance metrics. Adoption\nis slower where the evaluation of research work rests on\nits contribution to theories that are explicit and methods\nare the common currency of the peer group that provides\nthe most important formal means of evaluation\n(through status, promotions and appointments), that\nhave been established through a collaborative pro-\ngramme of research involving multiple stakeholders\nand in which the evaluation process is characterised by\nextensive, external review. On the basis of our experience\ngeneric taxonomies based on Big Data are more likely to\nbe adopted where external stakeholders are relatively\nlittle involved in directing research activity and where,\nas a result, a specialist analytic team is granted a rela-\ntively high level of autonomy to implement ``whatever\nworks best'' in a results-driven environment. Acceptance\nis likely to be greatest where there is long term continuity\nin the management of the analytic team and where the\ninvestment in understanding new taxonomies can confi-\ndently be deployed over a longer period than a typical\nresearch grant or ministerial appointment.\nThe conclusion that we have drawn from our ana-\nlysis is that the adoption of taxonomies based on Big\nData is far from random, that actors' reactions are\nmuch less capricious than we had supposed and that\nit has proved much easier to develop theoretical explan-\nations for the uneven use of these systems than we had\noriginally expected.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit\nsectors.\n14 Big Data & Society\nNotes\n1. The lead author has been involved in the development of\neach classification.\n2. Social Network analysis is just one example of a number\nof effective classification methods to have been developed\nin the social sciences from which it has proved difficult to\ncreate a standard generic taxonomy appropriate for use\nby multiple different users.\n3. In the paper they bracket the social survey, which has to\nsome extent gone out of fashion, with the semi-structured\ninterview and make the point that both rely heavily on\ninference to the whole population.\n4. These taxonomies are considered ``generic'' in that, like\nclass and ethnicity, they support research applications\nacross a wide range of applications and across a variety\nof different industries and they become used as a common\nstandard for comparing and/or integrating results from\ndifferent datasets by virtue of their consistent application.\n5. It is probably worth noting that these concepts tend to be\nnationally specific with, it might be said, the British being\nparticularly focused on issues of class whereas in North\nAmerica and much of Europe class does not have the\nsame resonance or meaning. In the US race/ethnicity\nhas long been much more central to sociological analysis\nof difference.\n6. These categories were updated in the 1990s using socio-\nlogical rather than medical categories in terms of the way\nthey treated `social' class and occupational and status\nmeasures following the Goldthorpe and Lockwood\nmodels combining them into the currently used\nNational Statistics Socio Economic Categories (NS\nSeC) in place of the previously used Social Economic\nGroups (SEG) and Registrar General measure of class.\nThis of course created the huge problem that the previous\nclassifications of occupational class were not compatible\nwith the new ones \u00ad David Rose produced some useful\nlook-up tables to enable a comparison between the two\nclassifications but the analysis of these was often the\nsource of controversy and threatened the historic trend\nrequirement that it was argued earlier was key to social\nscientific method \u00ad see Butler et al. (2008) for an example\nof this and the subsequent critique by Davidson and\n7. To this it can be countered that if the key objective of the\ngrouping algorithm is to produce natural groupings that\nmaximise discrimination on observed behaviour, it would\nbe surprising if there were not a high level of overlap\nbetween natural and conventional taxonomies, which\nfor the most part there invariably is.\n8. The 2011 census is a noteworthy exception to this\ngeneralisation.\n9. To a degree this is what is being requested when respond-\nents are asked to report their ethnic self-identity. But here\nthe rule sets that different respondents will use are neither\nconsistent nor explicit.\n10. Though the census is getting better at that.\n11. Though this is not necessarily the case with transactions\nundertaken digitally which is why the new taxonomies are\nnot so often used to analyse web based transactions as\nthose using physical channels.\n12. Unlike the government sector, which summarises statis-\ntics by administrative divisions, the commercial sector has\na culture whereby statistical analysis is undertaken almost\nexclusively using the postcode hierarchy.\n13. More particularly in relation to Origins it avoids the\nproblems associated with differential non-response.\n14. Nevertheless analysts in different countries may want to\naggregate detailed categories into different broader\ngroupings. Systems for inferring gender from name are\nnot country-independent, Andrea for example being a\nboy's name in Italy but a girl's name in Britain.\n15. These systems are also operational in 25 other countries\naround the world.\n16. This assertion is based on involvement of the authors in\nthe specification and testing of alternative methodologies\nover four updates to the Mosaic build methodology.\n17. This is a similar point to what Tudor Hart called the\n`inverse care law' based on insights derived from being\na medical practitioner in the deprived mining areas of\nSouth Wales from which he concluded that the deprived\nareas needed more resources but invariably got less.\n18. The evidence base on which this typology is constructed\nderives to a significant degree from access to information,\nsuch as the attendance lists of geodemographic confer-\nences and user groups, discussions with attendees, inven-\ntories of licensed users, discussions with sales staff,\ncustomer visits and responses to presentations to different\ngroups of potential user \u00ad some of which was shared in\nconfidence.\n19. For example criminology, medical research, bacteriology,\nbibliographics and tourism.\n20.
