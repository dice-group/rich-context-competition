Anthropometric measurements, hepatic enzymes, lipid profile, blood levels of albumin,\nglucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-2) index of all participants were also\nassessed.\nResults: Fifty-two patients with HSJ and 30 control subjects were involved in the study. The\ncoronary, short gastric and perisplenic veins were the most common shunting vessels. There were\nno significant differences between patients and controls in terms of body mass index or liver\nfunction. The degree of shunting vessels, blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test120/0\n, insulin,\nHOMA-2 index, glycosylated haemoglobin, cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, and C-\nreactive protein were significantly higher in the patients with IR. A positive correlation was found\nbetween the degree of the shunting vessels and the HOMA-2 index.\nConclusions: Patients with chronic HSJ and PSS without liver dysfunction had a high incidence of\nIR and diabetes. The study showed that PSS and IR are related and therefore patients with PSS\nshould be screened for IR and vice versa.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Radiology, Jinshan Hospital, Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China\n2Department of Dermatology, Jinshan Hospital, Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China\n3Department of Gastroenterology, Jinshan Hospital, Fudan\nUniversity, Shanghai, China\nCorresponding author:\nJinwei Qiang, Department of Radiology, Jinshan Hospital,\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Therefore, the\naim of this current study was to investigate\nthe incidence of IR and diabetes in patients\nwith chronic HSJ and PSS.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\npatients with a history of HSJ were recruited\nfrom Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University,\nShanghai, China, which is located in a\nformer HSJ endemic region. The disease was\nconfirmed by combining the findings of a\ntypical liver ultrasonography with results of\nclinical tests and a history of infection. Active\nschistosomiasis was diagnosed by positive\nKato-Katz test.13 Exclusion criteria included\nactive schistosomiasis, history of viral hepa-\ntitis, alcoholism, hepatocellular carcinoma,\nprimary hypertension, type 1 diabetes and\ntype 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives (i.e., to\navoid genetic factors). Healthy volunteers\nserved as control subjects. The control sub-\njects were recruited from the local population\nattending a clinic for routine examination\n(Department of Physical Examination\nCentre, Jinshan Hospital, Jinshan, Shanghai).\nThestudywasapprovedbytheInstitutional\nReview Board of Jinshan Hospital of Fudan\nwritten informed consent was obtained from\nall participants before CT imaging and labora-\ntory tests were performed.\nClinical data collection\nAfter a 12-h fast, blood samples were col-\nlected from all participants and analysed for\nlevels of insulin, glycosylated haemoglobin\n), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol\n(Cho), high-density lipoprotein (HDL),\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) and C-\nreactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotrans-\nferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin\ntime (PT) and albumin (Alb) using standard\nbiochemical procedures. After the samples\nwere collected, each participant underwent\nan oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For\nthis test, the participant received 75 g\nglucose orally and plasma glucose was\nence between the 120 min and 0 min glucose\n) was calculated.\nThe body mass index (BMI) was calcu-\nlated as follows: BMI \u00bc mass/height2.\nInsulin resistance was determined using the\nupdated homeostasis model assessment\n(HOMA-2) index.5 Using the HOMA-2\ncalculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homa-\ncalculator/), steady state b-cell function (%\nB), insulin sensitivity (%S) and HOMA-2\nindex were calculated. Patients with a\nHOMA-2 index > 2 were considered to\nhave IR.\nCT image analyses\nPre- and post-contrasted CT images in the\narterial and portal phase were taken for\nall participants using a 128-slice CT scanner\n(SOMATOM\u00d5; Siemens, Erlangen,\nGermany). Ultravist\u00d5 contrast medium\nwas used (370 mg I/ml; Bayer Healthcare,\nBerlin, Germany) and administered intra-\nvenously at a dose of 2 ml/kg and at a rate of\n3 ml/s. The parameters were as follows:\n0.6 mm collimation; 1.0-mm slice thickness;\n0.6 mm interval; and 1 pitch. The scanning\nrange extended from above the diaphragm\nto the inferior pole of the right kidney.\nAll of the imaging data were recon-\nstructed by two radiologists (i.e., one\nauthor [Y.L.] and the other an independent\nassessor) who were blinded to participant\ninformation. The axial and coronal thin-slab\n(10 mm) multiplanar reformations of the\nportal phase were reconstructed and\nobserved by scrolling the mouse at a work-\nstation (Syngo; Siemens). The presence,\nanatomy and grade of the shunting vessels\nwere evaluated according to the procedures\ndegree of a shunting was evaluated using a\nfour-point scale (i.e., 0, no shunting vessels;\n1, mild dilatation of a shunting vessel; 2,\nmoderate dilatation (round) of a shunting\nvessel; 3, significant dilatation (tubular or\nserpentine) of a shunting vessel.14 For each\npatient, the total score for all shunting\nvessels was calculated independently by the\ntwo radiologists and the mean of the two\nscores was used to indicate the degree of\nshunting.\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size was estimated using a\nclinical research sample size calculator\nwith HSJ and 19 control subjects were\nrequired to detect a significant difference in\nHOMA-2 IR between the two groups with\nmany subjects that became available in the\nstudy duration period.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. One-way analysis of\nvariance was used for the laboratory tests\nand the nonparametric Kruskal\u00adWallis test\nwas used to evaluate the degree of the\nshunting vessels. Spearman's rank correl-\nation coefficient was used to determine the\ncorrelation between the degree of the shunt-\ning vessels and HOMA-2 index or diabetes.\nAgreement between the two radiologists was\nestimated by calculating k statistics and was\ninterpreted as follows: < 0.40, fair\nprobability level of < 0.05 was considered\nto be statistically significant.\nResults\nOf the 135 patients with HSJ that were\nrecruited to the study, 83 were excluded\n(active schistosomiasis [n \u00bc 1], history of\nviral hepatitis [n \u00bc 45], alcoholism [n \u00bc 2],\nhepatocellular carcinoma [n \u00bc 8], primary\nhypertension [n \u00bc 11], type 1 diabetes or\ntype 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives\n27 women) were enrolled into the study;\nhad HSJ and had been cured for more than\n35 years. Schistosoma japonicum eggs were\nnot detected in the faeces of any of the\npatients. Previous upper digestive bleeding\nhad been recorded in 31 patients (60%) but\nnone of them had experienced a bleed within\nthe previous 3 months. Splenomegaly was\nfound in 25 patients (48%) and ascites in\nthree patients (6%). Neurological\nsymptoms, such as deficits in attention,\ndisturbance of sleep, rigidity and tremor\nAccording to plasma glucose levels,\nresults of the OGTT and the HOMA-2\nindex, patients were subdivided into the\nfollowing groups: non-IR (n \u00bc 17), IR with-\nout diabetes (n \u00bc 16), and IR with diabetes\n(n \u00bc 19). Thirty healthy volunteers\n20 women) served as age-matched control\nsubjects.\nTypical long stripes of strong echo or\nhyperdense calcification in the liver were seen\non ultrasound or CT images of the patients\nwith HSJ. The anatomical types and the\nfrequency of the shunting vessels in the 52\npatients with HSJ are shown in Table 1.\nThirteen types of shunting vessels (i.e.,\ncoronary, gastroepiploic, oesophageal, para-\noesophageal, short gastric, perisplenic,\nsplenorenal, gastrorenal, paraumbilical,\nabdominal wall vein, retroperitoneal-para-\nvertebral, mesenteric and omental) were\nidentified and graded. The coronary vein,\nshort gastric vein, perisplenic vein,\nTable 1.

Vessels wider than 6 mm were\nclearly observed and could be distinguished\nfrom the lymph nodes on post-contrasted CT\nimages (Figure 1). The k statistics agreement\nbetween the two radiologists was 0.80 and so\nthe interobserver agreement was substantial.\nA mild, moderate and significant degree of\nthe shunting vessels was observed in 14, 31\nand 7 patients, respectively.\nThere were no statistically significant\ndifferences between all four study groups in\nterms of BMI or liver function (i.e., ALT,\nAST, TB, TG, Alb) (Table 2). The degree of\nthe shunting vessels, plasma glucose,\n, plasma insulin, HOMA-2\nindex, HbA1c\n, Cho, HDL, LDL, and CRP\nwere significantly different between the\npatients with IR and the control subjects (see\nTable 2 for the specific details of the significant\nbetween-group differences; P< 0.05).\nCompared with non-IR patients, there\nwere significantly more shunts and higher\nlevels, insulin concentrations\nand HOMA-2 index values in patients with\nIR (see Table 2 for the specific details of\nthe significant between-group differences;\nFigure 1.

These findings are\nsimilar to a previous study in cirrhotic\npatients that showed a 60% to 80% preva-\nlence of IR and a 30% prevalence of\ndiabetes.4 In patients with chronic HSJ\nwith IR and normal plasma glucose in the\npresent study, the function of b-cells was\nupgraded resulting in a statistically signifi-\ncantly higher HOMA-2 %B value compared\nwith non-IR patients or control subjects. In\nthese patients, the combination of sufficient\ninsulin secreted by the pancreas to reduce\nthe amount of glucose and the decreased\ninsulin clearance due to PSS lead to hyper-\ninsulinaemia. With the progression of the\ndisease, the pancreas would `burn out' and\nhyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia would\nensue.18 An interesting observation was that\nthe CRP level was elevated in all patients\nwith chronic HSJ compared with control\nsubjects, which is suggestive of systemic\nLiver dysfunction is generally perceived\nto be the main contributing factor of IR\nbecause of a decrease in hepatic insulin\nclearance.1 However, the aetiology of IR in\nthese patients is unclear because portal\nhypertension and PSS are common compli-\ncations in cirrhotic patients and they may\nalso contribute to the IR.4\u00ad6\nOne study showed that in patients with\nchronic HSJ, the primary pathological\nchanges were marked periportal fibrosis,\nrelatively intact hepatic sinusoids and\nslight hepatocyte injuries that are different\nfrom those in cirrhosis or other liver dis-\neases.20 These pathological changes lead to\nportal hypertension and subsequent PSS.3\nIn the present study, all patients with\nchronic HSJ had a normal liver function,\nwhich was consistent with findings from our\nprevious study.12 A lack of correlation\nbetween IR and liver histological severity\nin cirrhotic patients has been reported else-\nwhere.21,22 Therefore, we hypothesize that\nIR in patients with chronic HSJ might be\ncaused by portal hypertension and subse-\nquent PSS rather than by liver dysfunction.\nThis present study confirmed that CT\nimaging can be used to evaluate the degree\nof shunting vessels.9 A positive correlation\nwas found between the degree of shunting\nvessels and the HOMA-2 index. The most\nfrequent shunting vessels were the coronary\nvein, short gastric vein, perisplenic vein,\nFigure 2. Scatter graph showing the change in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-2) index with\nthe increase in the degree of shunting from the 52 patients with hepatic schistosomiasis japonica. A positive\ncorrelation was seen between the two variables (r \u00bc 0.67; P < 0.05; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).\ngastroepiploic vein, and splenorenal vein,\nwhich cannot be evaluated by endoscopy.14\nTherefore, when a patient with chronic HSJ\nand PSS is identified, regardless of liver\nfunction, IR or diabetes should be con-\nsidered and investigated. Conversely, in an\nHSJ endemic region, in any patient with IR\nor diabetes, PSS should be considered as a\ncontributing factor in their pathogenesis.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nFirst, patients with HSJ and PSS often lack\nclinical features and so some patients with-\nout a clear history of schistosomiasis may\nhave unintentionally been excluded from the\nstudy so creating a population bias.\nSecondly, elevated CRP was found in\npatients with HSJ and IR but no clinical\nfeatures of systemic inflammation were\nfound in these patients. Further studies are\nrequired to confirm these current findings.\nIn conclusion, the present study demon-\nstrated that patients with chronic HSJ and\nPSS without liver dysfunction had a high\nincidence of IR and diabetes. Additionally,\nthe study showed that PSS and IR are\nrelated and so patients with PSS should be\nscreened for IR and vice versa.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by Shanghai\nMunicipal Commission of Health and Family\nReferences\n1.
