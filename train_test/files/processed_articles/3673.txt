Monitoring on-site has an important role in achieving these objec-\ntives; it controls trial conduct at trial sites and informs the sponsor on systematic problems. In the past, extensive on-site\nmonitoring with a particular focus on formal source data verification often lost sight of systematic problems in study pro-\ncedures that endanger Good Clinical Practice objectives. ADAMON is a prospective, stratified, cluster-randomised, con-\ntrolled study comparing extensive on-site monitoring with risk-adapted monitoring according to a previously published\napproach.\nMethods: In all, 213 sites from 11 academic trials were cluster-randomised between extensive on-site monitoring (104)\nand risk-adapted monitoring (109). Independent post-trial audits using structured manuals were performed to determine\nthe frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings at the patient level. The primary outcome measure is the propor-\ntion of audited patients with at least one major audit finding. Analysis relies on logistic regression incorporating trial and\nmonitoring arm as fixed effects and site as random effect. The hypothesis was that risk-adapted monitoring is non-\ninferior to extensive on-site monitoring with a non-inferiority margin of 0.60 (logit scale).\nResults: Average number of monitoring visits and time spent on-site was 2.1 and 2.7 times higher in extensive on-site\nmonitoring than in risk-adapted monitoring, respectively. A total of 156 (extensive on-site monitoring: 76; risk-adapted\nted. Depending on the trial, findings were identified in 18%\u00ad99% of the audited patients, with no marked monitoring\neffect in any of the trials. The estimated monitoring effect is 20.04 on the logit scale with two-sided 95% confidence\ninterval (20.40; 0.33), demonstrating that risk-adapted monitoring is non-inferior to extensive on-site monitoring. At\nmost, extensive on-site monitoring could reduce the frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings by 8.2% com-\npared with risk-adapted monitoring.\nConclusion: Compared with risk-adapted monitoring, the potential benefit of extensive on-site monitoring is small\nrelative to overall finding rates, although risk-adapted monitoring requires less than 50% of extensive on-site monitoring\nresources. Clusters of findings within trials suggest that complicated, overly specific or not properly justified protocol\nrequirements contributed to the overall frequency of findings. Risk-adapted monitoring in only a sample of patients\nappears sufficient to identify systematic problems in the conduct of clinical trials. Risk-adapted monitoring has a part to\nplay in quality control. However, no monitoring strategy can remedy defects in quality of design. Monitoring should be\nembedded in a comprehensive quality management approach covering the entire trial lifecycle.\n1Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany\n2Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, Bonn, Germany\n3Clinical Trials Centre Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany\n4KKS-Network/National ECRIN Office, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany\n5Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics, and Epidemiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany\nCorresponding author:\nOana Brosteanu, Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, Leipzig University, Haertelstr. 16-18, 04107 Leipzig, Germany.\nEmail: oana.brosteanu@zks.uni-leipzig.de\n",

Monitoring on-site has an important role in achiev-\ning these objectives; it controls trial conduct at trial sites\nand informs the sponsor on systematic problems. In the\npast, on-site monitoring with a particular focus on\nextensive, but non-targeted source data verification\noften lost sight of systematic problems in trial proce-\ndures, thereby endangering GCP objectives.1,2 In light of\nthe fact that monitoring is time consuming and generates\nextensive costs, the efficacy of this expenditure is being\nquestioned more and more.3,4 New regulatory guidance,\nincluding the recently released addendum to the GCP\nGuideline (International Council for Harmonisation\nof Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for\nHuman Use E6 R2),5 recommends optimising the effi-\ncacy of monitoring and complementing it with other\nmeasures to make better use of available resources.1,2,6\nIn 2004, implementation of the European Union's\nparticular for academic investigator\u00adinitiated trials.\nFrequency and extent of the necessary on-site monitor-\ning were unclear and cost-efficient approaches were\nurgently needed, but difficult to implement due to a lack\nof clear guidance. Therefore, we developed a structured\napproach to perform risk analysis and define corre-\nsponding risk-adapted monitoring strategies, published\nThe main idea was to focus monitoring on trial-\nspecific risks to essential GCP objectives, namely, to\nassure that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of\ntrial subjects are protected and their safety ensured and\nthat data and reported results are reliable. This tool is\nreferenced in the European Medicines Agency's reflec-\ntion paper on risk-based quality management1 as well\nas in the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance\non a risk-based approach to monitoring.2\nThe Risk ADApted MONitoring (ADAMON) study\nwas set up to investigate whether a trial-specific, risk-\nadapted, reduced on-site monitoring strategy as pro-\nposed in Brosteanu et al.7 is as effective as an extensive,\nnon-targeted on-site monitoring strategy in preventing\nmajor or critical violation of GCP objectives, as ascer-\ntained by independent audits at the end of the trial.\nMethods\nStudy design\nADAMON is a stratified, cluster-randomised non-\ninferiority study. Trial sites within participating clinical\ntrials were randomised either to extensive or to risk-\nadapted monitoring.7 Cluster randomisation was used\nbecause monitoring affects trial sites as a whole by\nretraining local staff concerning trial procedures trig-\ngered by detected findings. In addition, applying differ-\nent monitoring strategies to individual patients within\none site was deemed unfeasible.\nInclusion criteria for trials were as follows: rando-\nmised, multicentre (at least six trial sites) clinical trials\nwith a non-commercial sponsor; having Standard\nOperating Procedures for data management and trial\nsupervision, central monitoring of at least basic extent,\nand classification as K2 (intermediate risk) or K3 (low\nrisk) based on a trial-specific analysis as proposed in\nBrosteanu et al.7 The classification is based on the fol-\nlowing components: (a) the potential risk of the thera-\npeutic intervention evaluated in the trial as compared\nto standard medical care, (b) the presence of at least\none of a list of risk indicators for the patient or the trial\nresults and (c) the robustness of trial procedures (reli-\nable and easy to assess primary endpoint, simple trial\nprocedures). A trial belongs to K3 (low risk) if the risk\nof the therapeutic intervention is comparable to that of\nstandard medical care, no other risk indicators are\npresent and the trial procedures are robust. In contrast,\na trial belongs to K1 (high risk) if either the risk of the\ntherapeutic intervention is higher than that of standard\nmedical care, and other risk indicators are present, or if\nthe risk of the therapeutic intervention is markedly\nhigher than that of standard medical care. Trials in\nmonitoring class K1 (high risk) were not included, since\nin K1 extensive on-site monitoring is only marginally\nmore extensive than risk-adapted monitoring.\nExtensive on-site monitoring comprised checking\nexistence of trial subjects, informed consent documents\nand complete source data verification for all patients.\nVisits were scheduled as frequently as necessary in order\nto fulfil the aforementioned monitoring tasks (at least\nannually while patients in trial).\nRisk-adapted on-site monitoring depended on the\nassigned monitoring class (K2 or K3) and the monitor-\ning findings at the first visit as well as during the trial\n(for details, see Table 1).\nOutcomes\nPrimary endpoint of the ADAMON study is the pro-\nportion of audited patients with at least one major or\ncritical violation of essential GCP objectives in one or\nmore of five error domains: informed consent process,\npatient selection (eligibility criteria critical for safety\nand/or efficacy), intervention (protocol deviation with\nimpact on patient safety or data validity), endpoint\nassessment and serious adverse event reporting. Major\nor critical GCP violations (in the following referred to\nas `major audit findings') were determined in indepen-\ndent ADAMON audits at the end of the trial looking\nat all individual patients in all participating trial sites.\nAuditors were not in contact with monitors and had no\nvested interest in the trial. The proportions of patients\nwith major audit findings in specific error domains were\nassessed as secondary endpoints.\nFor supportive analysis, the proportion of patients\nwith major audit findings that were not already identi-\nfied by on-site monitoring during the trial was listed as\nfurther secondary endpoint. Monitoring findings were\nextracted retrospectively from monitoring reports.\nMonitoring reports used templates provided by the\nrespective trial sponsor. However, the supportive anal-\nysis turned out to be only feasible for the informed\nconsent process for which monitoring reports included\npatient-level lists of findings. For other error domains,\nthe different documentation systems for monitoring\nand audit findings precluded their comparison and\nreconciliation.\nMeasures against bias\nRandomisation of trial sites within participating trials\nwas performed centrally in Leipzig stratified by accrual\npotential (small vs large, if available) and type of site\n(University Clinic, General Hospital, Surgery, if appli-\ncable). The ratio was 1:1, except in one trial 1:2 (extensi-\nve:risk-adapted) due to resource limitations. Trial sites\nwere informed by their respective trial sponsor about\nADAMON and the planned audits, but not about the\nassigned monitoring arm.\nAudits were standardised using detailed trial-specific\naudit manuals developed by the ADAMON team.\nManuals defined trial-specific protocol requirements to\nbe verified and GCP violations to be counted as major\nADAMON audit findings. They counted as audit find-\nings only if they still persisted at the time of auditing.\nGCP violations remedied by appropriate monitoring\nfollow-up actions were not counted.\nAudit findings were documented on an audit case report\nform separately for each patient of the respective trial site\n(refer to supplement for a sample audit manual and audit\ncase report form in German). ADAMON audits were per-\nformed jointly by teams of two ADAMON-trained audi-\ntors. Auditors came from separate institutions and had no\nprior involvement in the audited trial. Preferably, the same\nteam audited all trial sites of one trial. Audit teams were\nnot informed of the sites' monitoring strategy and did not\nhave access to any monitoring reports.\nAudit findings were reviewed in a blinded manner by\nmembers of the ADAMON team and discussed with\nauditors, as necessary, to ensure that reporting was con-\nsistent with the ADAMON audit manuals.\nTable 1.

The monitor assessed and documented noticeable problems, taking into account compliance with ICH-GCP and the protocol as well as the\nresources of the site staff to conduct the trial. This was checked and confirmed by the trial's project manager.\nProcedures\nFor each screened trial, a structured risk analysis\naccording to Brosteanu et al.7 was agreed upon between\nthe ADAMON and the respective trial team, and a\nmonitoring class was determined. In addition, existing\nprocedures for central oversight and data management\nwere discussed. For eligible trials, a contract concerning\nADAMON participation was concluded with the trial\nsponsor.\nKey data were defined and trial-specific manuals\ndeveloped for each monitoring strategy. These manuals\nwere the basis for contracts with the trial sponsors.\nADAMON funded extra monitoring costs arising from\nparticipation in ADAMON.\nConduct of monitoring was the responsibility of\nthe respective trial sponsor. For each monitoring strat-\negy, disjoint teams of monitors were trained by the\nADAMON team. The ADAMON team received\nthe monitoring reports and supervised adherence to the\nmonitoring manuals, providing additional training for\nmonitors if required.\nStatistical analysis\nBoth the intervention (monitoring strategy) as well as\nthe endpoint assessment (audit) were customised to\neach trial, but using a common structured approach.\nTrials varied in complexity. Finding rates are thus only\ncomparable within each trial. ADAMON relies on\nmeta-analysing results obtained within each trial, with\na model assuming that trial-specific differences between\nextensive on-site monitoring and risk-adapted monitor-\ning on the logit scale (i.e. log odds ratios) are compara-\nble across trials.\nThe protocol-specified analysis is logistic regression\nincorporating trial and monitoring arm as fixed effects\nand trial site as a single random effect, corresponding\nto a fixed-effect meta-analysis. In addition, it assumes\nthat the variance of site random effects can be estimated\nacross trials; such estimates may be unstable with only\nfew sites for a given trial.\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we also present a standard\nrandom-effect meta-analysis of separate and indepen-\ndent trial-specific treatment effects on the logit scale\nobtained with logistic regression with monitoring arm\nas fixed effect and site as a random effect.\nPrimary result of the ADAMON study is an esti-\nmate (with 95% confidence interval) of the effect of\nrisk-adapted monitoring on the proportion of patients\nwith major audit findings.\nADAMON set out to recruit 12 trials with at least\npatients to achieve a power of 80%. This was based on\nsimulations assuming an average of 10\u00ad30 patients\nincluded per site, variance of the site random effect of\n0.6\u00ad1 on the logit scale (describing the cluster effect;\ncorresponding intra-class correlation coefficient\n5%\u00ad10%.8 Evidence for these planning assumptions\nwere limited.\nThe non-inferiority margin was set to 0.60 on the logit\nscale. In the planning scenario, this corresponded to an\nincrease in finding rate from 7% with extensive on-site\nmonitoring to 12% with risk-adapted monitoring.\nResults\nTrials\nwere screened and 15 included. Of those, two never\nstarted recruitment, and a further two terminated very\nearly due to insufficient accrual. ADAMON audits\nwere performed in the remaining 11 trials (Figure 1).\nTable 2 alphabetically lists and characterises these\ntrials,9\u00ad16 which cover a broad spectrum of indications.\nThree trials were assessed as monitoring class K3 (low\nTABEA and SYNCHRONOUS, for full trial names\nsee Table 2), only a sample of trial sites took part in\nADAMON. In NIC-PD, only the German trial sites\nwere involved. For all further analyses, the 11 trials are\npseudonymised using an internal trial number unre-\nlated to the alphabetical order.\nTrial sites and audits\nOverall, 213 trial sites were randomised between exten-\nsites, 27 sites never recruited any patient; 186 trials sites,\n89 of which were monitored extensively and 97 in a\nrisk-adapted manner, recruited a total of 1967 patients.\nFrom these, 30 sites with 47 patients were not audited:\none site refused the audit, and in the last five audited\ntrials, 29 sites with less than three patients were not\naudited due to limited resources (Figure 1). Thus, 156\nsites were audited and included in the final analysis: 76\nextensively monitored sites, which had enrolled 955\npatients, and 80 sites monitored in a risk-adapted man-\nner, which had enrolled 965 patients.\nIn five trials, audits took place as planned after last\npatient last visit. Due to funding and time limitations,\naudits were performed in four trials after last patient\nin, but before end of trial (mainly trials with long-term\nfollow-up per patient). In two trials, accrual was still\nongoing at the time trial sites were audited; in these\ncases, audits were restricted to patients having com-\npleted their treatment.\nally audited. Audit duration was limited to 5 days;\nthus, in large sites (.45 patients), only a centrally pre-\nselected random sample of patients was audited.

Average audit duration per patient\nwas 2.6 h and similar between monitoring arms (2.7\nextensive on-site monitoring and 2.5 risk-adapted\nmonitoring).\nImplementation of monitoring\nMonitoring efforts differed markedly by monitoring\nstrategy within each participating trial (Figure S1 and\nFigure S2 supplement). With extensive on-site monitor-\ning, the number of monitoring visits per patient and the\ncumulative monitoring time on-site was higher com-\npared to risk-adapted monitoring by a factor of 2.1 and\n2.7, respectively (ratios of the efforts calculated within\neach trial and summarised with the geometric mean).\nAs expected, these factors were more pronounced in\nand 2.1 in K2).

Thus, non-inferiority is shown.\nDescription of audit findings by error domains\nWe performed a detailed explorative analysis of all\n2456 findings, which will be published separately. The\nmost frequent types of findings by error domain are as\nfollows.\nFindings in the informed consent process (N = 292)\nmainly concerned dating the signature by the participat-\ning patient (missing, delayed or not written by patient;\nN = 180). Another problem was information being\nprovided by staff not qualified for this task (N = 38).\nWe did not find positive evidence that any audited\npatient entered a trial without being aware of his/her\ntrial participation.\nWith regard to patient selection (N = 436), mea-\nsurements required for the assessment of eligibility were\nnot performed, not performed in a timely manner or\nwere out of range in 175 cases. In total, 89 findings\nconcerned violation of complicated rules on prohibited\nco-medication mainly in one of the trials. In 71 cases,\nincluded patients either did not belong to the targeted\nFigure 2. Monitoring effect on the primary endpoint. Figure 2 shows the forest plot of a random-effect meta-analysis of within-trial\nmonitoring effects. The overall estimate of the random-effect meta-analysis closely agrees with the model-based estimate of 20.04\nwith two-sided 95% confidence interval (20.40; 0.33). There is no significant heterogeneity between trials. Note that trial #05 is\nnon-informative because there were major findings in all but one patient. Trials are grouped by risk class. The intervention effect\ndoes not differ by risk class. The black vertical line at 0.6 shows the pre-specified tolerance margin for claiming non-inferiority.\nOverall and in both subgroups, the non-inferiority margin is outside the meta-analysis confidence interval (CI).\ntrial population to which the trial question applied\n(N = 18) or compliance with eligibility criteria was not\nfully verifiable.\nFindings in intervention (N = 758) mainly con-\ncerned treatment modification rules in complex treat-\nment schemes: In 227 findings, a treatment\nmodification rule was ignored, and in further 166, a\nmodification rule trigger (e.g. blood counts before start\nof next therapy cycle) was not measured or not mea-\nsured in a timely manner. In all, 90 relevant dose devia-\ntions were noted.\nA total of 629 findings concerned endpoint assess-\nments: an endpoint was not assessed in 95 cases, mea-\nsured inadequately in 181 cases and not on schedule in\nIn serious adverse event reporting (N = 356 find-\nings), the most frequent finding was non-reporting of a\nserious adverse event (N = 73) or reporting with delay\nadverse event was not reported or reported with delay,\nwere not reported in extensive on-site monitoring com-\nMonitoring findings\npatients with extensive on-site monitoring and 287 of\nThis difference is expected since risk-adapted monitor-\ning required only a sample of patients to be monitored.\nFinding rates per patient calculated for patients actually\nmonitored in all error domains were comparable (456\nmonitoring). This also applies to each error domain\n(see Figure S8 supplement for a model-based analysis).\nMonitoring findings in relation to subsequent audit\nfindings\nThe purpose of this section is to report on the quality of\nmonitoring (rate of audit findings not already detected\nby monitoring) and the degree of remedy of findings\nthrough monitoring (rate of monitoring findings not\nmentioned again by auditors). The informed consent\nprocess was both monitored and audited in 1402 cases.\nAudit and monitoring agreed on `no finding' in 894 and\non `finding' in 134 cases, resulting in a concordance rate\nadapted monitoring: 73.0%). For details, see supple-\nment Table S1. In 76 cases, the audit detected a finding\nnot reported by monitoring (7.8% of all 970 cases with-\nout monitoring findings; extensive on-site monitoring:\nreported any more as audit findings, due to monitoring\nfollow-up actions.\nDiscussion\nADAMON compared two monitoring strategies: exten-\nsive standard on-site monitoring with complete source\nFigure 3.

Error domains: informed consent process (IC), patient selection (eligibility criteria critical for safety and/or efficacy;\nSEL), intervention (protocol deviation with impact on patient safety or data validity; INTV), endpoint assessment (END) and serious\nadverse event reporting (SAER). There is no statistical evidence that type of monitoring makes any difference in reducing the\nnumber of major findings neither overall nor in specific error domains.

This endpoint was chosen to deter-\nmine whether the nature and amount of monitoring\ninfluence the number of GCP violations that occur in a\ntrial and are not remedied by monitoring.\nADAMON shows that risk-adapted monitoring is\nnon-inferior to extensive monitoring, although it\nrequired less than 50% of the monitoring resources.\nAs trials differed in complexity and therefore overall\nfinding rate, the primary analysis is based on the logit\nscale. The tolerance margin for the difference in audit\nfinding rates was pre-specified as 0.6 on the logit scale.\nThe estimate of the monitoring effect in the primary\nendpoint is 20.04 on the logit scale with two-sided\nFigure S9 (supplement) translates logit differences into\neasier to interpret finding rate differences depending on\nan assumed overall finding rate with extensive monitor-\ning. Observed finding rates varied between 18% and\n99%. Possible benefit with extensive monitoring not\nexcluded by the conditional 95% confidence intervals is\nattained with finding rates of about 50%. Thus, if there\nwas a benefit from extensive monitoring, the effect\nwould remain small compared to the overall finding\nrates.\nADAMON only audited 82% of all patients audita-\nmonitoring). We do not think that this deviation\ninduces bias, since the reasons for not auditing fol-\nlowed the same rules in both arms: We were not able to\naudit 30 trial sites with less than 3 patients (47 patients\nin total) due to logistic and financial constraints.

A secondary objective of monitoring is describ-\ning the adherence to GCP and trial rules. Without\naudit results, knowledge about GCP violations in the\ntrials would clearly depend on the results of monitoring\nvisits only and thus on the monitoring strategy. The\nabsolute number of reported monitoring findings was\nhigher with extensive on-site monitoring than with risk-\nadapted monitoring, simply because with risk-adapted\nmonitoring only a sample of patients and source data is\nmonitored. But the finding rates per monitored patient\nwere almost identical. This suggests that risk-adapted\nmonitoring provides a representative sample of findings\nfrom a sample of patients monitored and thus should\nbe sufficient for the assessment of overall trial protocol\ncompliance and detection of systematic problems in\ntrial conduct, thus allowing the trial sponsor to imple-\nment adequate corrective and preventive measures to\nimprove the trial's quality.\nWe found some evidence of remedy of GCP viola-\ntions by monitoring, namely, in informed consent and\nin a shift from serious adverse event not reported to\nserious adverse event reported with delay. But remark-\nably, there was no evidence of an actually preventive\neffect of monitoring on the occurrence of GCP viola-\ntions by either monitoring strategy. In particular, there\nwas no consistent trend of less findings in later patients\nwithin a trial site (data not shown).\nThe observed finding rates were surprisingly high\n(18%\u00ad99%). In designing ADAMON, we had assumed\na finding rate of about 5%\u00ad10% based on a review\navailable at that time.8 Finding rates per patient have\nrarely been reported in a systematic way. ADAMON\nfills this information gap.\nIn setting up audit manuals, our aim was to define\nfindings with impact on patient safety and rights and\nvalidity of trial results including existence of source\ndata for important trial items. We used strict defini-\ntions in ADAMON audit manuals to reduce variance\nin finding assessment by the auditors. In specifying\nwhich deviation from a given rule was to be recorded\nas a finding, we relied on the wording of trial rules in\nthe respective trial protocols applying rather liberal tol-\nerance limits. Some of the findings can be regarded as a\nviolation of detailed GCP requirements or the wording\nof a study rule, but not necessarily as a breach of the\nunderlying objective. A detailed attempt to classify\nADAMON findings accordingly will be published\nseparately.\nIn developing the audit manuals from the trial pro-\ntocols, we were confronted with trial rules and require-\nments that appeared unnecessarily complex and\nsometimes ambiguous. Trial protocols also tended to\nbe overly specific causing avoidable friction with local\nclinical practice. These shortcomings clearly contribu-\nted to the high finding rates.\nThe nature, extent and suspected root causes of the\nADAMON audit findings imply that the majority of\nthe GCP violations cannot be retrospectively remedied\nor prospectively prevented by simple source data verifi-\ncation and subsequent generation of queries. More\nattention to potential problems would have to be paid\nwhile developing the trial protocol and case report\nforms.\nADAMON had no influence on the quality of design\nor control of the extent of trial oversight and intensity\nof central monitoring in the participating trials. Recent\nwere not available at the time when ADAMON trials\nstarted.\nADAMON did not interfere with escalation of and\nreaction to monitoring findings. Monitoring reports\nindicate that in some trials, reactions to monitoring\nfindings were unassertive such that systematic problems\nwere not adequately addressed.\nADAMON focussed on academic investigator\u00ad\ninitiated trials. We nevertheless hypothesise that results\nare generalisable beyond academic trials, because error-\nprone trial rules and error-prone complex clinical set-\ntings are not restricted to investigator-initiated trials.\nThis is also supported by publicly available summaries\nof inspectional observations of the US Food and Drug\nAdministration and the European Medicines\nCentral statistical monitoring has the potential to\ndetect a considerable proportion of findings without\non-site monitoring.24,25 ADAMON was not designed\nto assess how much central statistical monitoring can\ncomplement or partly substitute on-site monitoring. In\nparticular, we have not shown that on-site monitoring\ncan be safely omitted.\nADAMON was also not designed to investigate the\noverall impact of the findings on the reliability of the\nresults of the participating trials. Eight of the trials\nhave been already published, mostly in major journals.\nSeveral publications suggest that reliable results can be\ngenerated in real-world settings in large trials as long as\nrandomisation and avoidance of systematic bias is\ndata corrections triggered by source data verification\nonly minimally affect trial outcomes.\nTo our knowledge, ADAMON is the first fully pub-\nlished trial comparing effectiveness of monitoring stra-\ntegies;29\u00ad31 three related studies (OPTI-misation of\nMONitoring (OPTIMON), Strategic Timing of\nAntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial Monitoring\nSubstudy and TargetEd Monitoring: Prospective\nEvaluation and Refinement (TEMPER) study) \u00ad with\ndifferent foci and designs \u00ad will become available in the\nfuture. The French OPTIMON study compares the\nefficacy of two monitoring strategies: one based on the\nclassic standards of quality assurance and the other one\nbased on the risk level (OPTIMON scale) with pre-\ndefinition of scientific and regulatory priorities. The\nstudy involves clinical research studies with risk level\nA, B or C (low to intermediate risk) in the OPTIMON\nscale.32 The START monitoring sub-study is part of an\ninternational HIV treatment trial. In START, all sites\nare centrally monitored and are required to perform\nlocal quality assurance activities according to a local\nmonitoring plan. In addition, sites are randomised to\nreceive, or not receive, annual on-site monitoring.33\nFinally, the Targeted Monitoring, Prospective\nEvaluation and Refinement (TEMPER) study\ninvestigates the efficacy of central monitoring in com-\nbination with targeted for-cause on-site monitoring.\nProblematic sites identified by central monitoring are\npaired with similarly sized inconspicuous sites. Both\nare monitored on-site. Finding rates are compared\nusing a matched pair design.34\nSince the design of ADAMON in 2007, the interna-\ntional discussion has moved towards prospective qual-\nity by design measures for both the scientific and the\noperational design of clinical trials and towards the\ncombination of risk-based on-site monitoring with cen-\ntral statistical monitoring.1\u00ad3,17 ADAMON results pro-\nvide basic empirical evidence to support this new\nparadigm, which was scarce up to now.\nIn conclusion, ADAMON has shown that risk-\nadapted monitoring is non-inferior to extensive moni-\ntoring in avoiding violations of GCP objectives as\ndetected in post-trial audits, although it required less\nthan 50% in monitoring resources. Extensive on-site\nmonitoring compared to risk-adapted monitoring may\nimprove the sponsor's knowledge about what went\nwrong in a trial, but does not reduce the number of\nmajor or critical GCP violations that occur.\nADAMON results suggest that progress in reducing\nfrequency of GCP violations requires improved quality\nof trial protocols and comprehensive quality manage-\nment based on a careful analysis of inherent risks for\npatients' safety and rights as well as reliability of trial\nresults.\n"
