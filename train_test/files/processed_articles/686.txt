Although it is generally agreed that\ncrowding out is a problem, there is widespread dis-\nagreement regarding its extent. The Peer Review sec-\ntion offers an opportunityfor healthpolicy leaders and\nresearchers to present differing interpretations of a\ncontroversial issue. Here, Lisa Dubay and Genevieve\nKenney, and David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber, set\nout opposing views on the impact of Medicaid expan-\nsions on private coverage. Following that, Richard\nCurtis and colleagues, then]ohn Holahan, comment on\nthe importance and the policy implications of the\nauthors'findings.\nand morbidity in the United States and\nthe erosion of private insurance coverage\nsparked major expansions in the Medicaid\nprogram beginning in 1986. These expansions,\nwhich were aimed at increasing prenatal and\nother health services available to pregnant\nwomen, were followed by large increases in\nthe number of Medicaid-eligible births and\ndeclines in the number of births to uninsured\nwomen.1 Nonetheless, recent research on the\nnational impact of these expansions suggests\nthat they had only a small effect on the timeli-\nness of prenatal care and the incidence of low-\nbirthweight births.2\nA number of researchers have suggested\nthat the lack of improvement during the early\nyears of the expansions may have been the\nresult of demographic changes in the popula-\ntion giving birth, continuing problems with\nthe Medicaid enrollment process, and access\nproblems that low-income pregnant women\nfaced.3 Two other factors that may help to ex-\nplain the lack of strong effects serve as the\nfocus for this paper: the extent to which\nMedicaid is reaching its target population,\nand the extent to which Medicaid is substi-\ntuting for employer-sponsored coverage.\nSpeculation on the latter issue has been\nfueled partly by the fact that following the\nexpansions, growth in Medicaid-covered\nbirths vastly outpaced the decline in un-in-\nsured births, which indicates that there was a\nreduction in private insurance coverage dur-\ning the expansion period. Indeed, some ob-\nthe increase in Medicaid coverage for preg-\nnant women was attributable to the \"crowd-\ning out\" of private insurance.4 Crowding out\nis a phenomenon whereby more generous\nMedicaid eligibility policies that are designed\nto extend coverage to the uninsured may\nprompt some privately insured persons to\ndrop their coverage to take advantage of the\nexpanded public subsidy.

In fact, other ob-\nservers have argued that the previous litera-\nture fails to adequately control for the secular\ndeclines in employer-sponsored coverage that\nwere occurring over the period of analysis.7\nOur goal here is to document the changing\npicture of health insurance coverage for preg-\nnant women in the four-year period following\nthe Medicaid expansions and to assess the ex-\ntent to which crowding out may have influ-\nenced trends. We attempt to build on the pre-\nvious literature by identifying and analyzing\ninsurance coverage of pregnant women and\nmaking an explicit attempt to account for\nsecular changes in employer-sponsored insur-\nance coverage over the period.8 A key contri-\nbution of this paper is that it examines the\npotential for crowding out at different eligi-\nbility thresholds.\nData And Methods\nFor this analysis we used The Urban Insti-\ntute's Transfer Income Model, Version 2\n(TRIM2), a microsimulation model of tax and\ntransfer programs affecting individuals and\nfamilies.9 The database underlying TRIM2 is\nthe March Current Population Survey (CPS),\na nationally representative sample of the U.S.\npopulation. For this analysis, we used the\n\u00b7 Extent of crowding out. Here we sum-\nmarize the four steps used to estimate the ex-\ntent of crowding out over the expansion pe-\nriod.11 First, because we believe that the\npotential for substitution of Medicaid for em-\nployer coverage varies dramatically by in-\ncome, we examined how the distribution of\ninsurance coverage of pregnant women\npoor (family incomes up to 100 percent of\npoverty) and near-poor (family incomes of\nwomen.12 Second, we netted out the declines\nin employer coverage for a group likely to be\nunaffected by the expansions--men ages\neighteen to forty-four--by income group, to\nexplicitly control for the erosion of employer-\nsponsored coverage occurring over the period\nindependent of the expansions. What re-\nmains is the amount of the decline in\nemployer-sponsored coverage attributable to\ncrowding out for each income group. Third,\nwe divided the crowding-out effect by the in-\ncrease in Medicaid enrollment for pregnant\nwomen to assess how much of the increase\nresulted from crowding out, by income group.\nFinally, we weighted our results by the per-\ncentage increase in the number of Medicaid-\nenrolled pregnant women over the time\nperiod in each income group.\n\u00b7 Caveats. Several problems with the CPS\ndata and limitations to our analysis should be\nnoted. First, estimates of the uninsured from\nthe CPS reflect the number of persons for\nwhom none of the specified types of coverage\nis reported for the year (the default category).\nIdeally, respondents would be asked whether\nthey had been uninsured for either part or all\nof the past year. Thus, if survey respondents\nare answering the questions as intended, the\nonly persons reported as uninsured on the\nCPS are those without insurance for the en-\ntire year.\nSecond, persons responding to the CPS\nmay be reporting their coverage status at the\ntime of the interview, rather than their status\nduring the previous calendar year, as re-\nquested. The evidence suggests a mix of re-\nsponses among CPS respondents. For this\nanalysis we assume that respondents are re-\nporting coverage during the previous year.13\nThird, participation in Medicaid and other\nincome-related programs is almost certainly\nunderreported because the number of persons\non the survey who report participation is\nmuch lower than the number of program par-\nticipants. We use the TRIM2 edited version\nof the CPS to address this concern.14\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - V o l u m e 16, Number 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Women in this cate-\ngory are likely a mix of those who retained\nboth Medicaid and employer-sponsored cov-\nerage for some part of the year and those who\nhad Medicaid at some point during the year\nand employer coverage at another point. It is\nnot clear how to interpret changes in the\nstatus of such respondents. We assume that\nhalf of them had only Medicaid coverage at a\npoint in time and that the other half had only\nemployer coverage. Therefore, counts of these\nrespondents are split evenly between those\nwho reported having had the two types of\ncoverage in each of the two years.\nFifth, pregnant women are not explicitly\nidentified on the CPS. We use an algorithm\ndeveloped for other Urban Institute projects\nthat identifies women who were pregnant in\nthe year prior to the March survey.15 However,\nour approach underestimates the number of\npregnant women.16 Also, it does not allow us\nto capture changes in insurance coverage that\nmay have occurred during the last one to three\nmonths of pregnancy for those women whose\ninfants were born between January and\nMarch of a given survey year.17\nSixth, the CPS data are cross-sectional. A\ndefinitive analysis of the issue of crowding out\nrequires the use of a longitudinal database to\nshed light on the dynamic nature of health\ninsurance coverage. Since the only other work\nto date on this issue also uses the CPS, our\nanalysis provides additional context for as-\nsessing those results.\nFinally, we assume that changes in insur-\nance coverage of men ages eighteen to forty-\nfour are an appropriate control for what\nwould have happened to coverage of pregnant\nwomen in the absence of the expansions. To\nthe extent that what happened for the com-\nparison group is not a reasonable counter-\nfactual for pregnant women, our results may\nbe biased. If the secular declines in dependent\ncoverage are more significant than for individ-\nual coverage, we may be underestimating the\ndecline in employer-sponsored coverage that\nwould have been expected for pregnant\nwomen independent of the expansions, since\npregnant women are more likely than men to\nhave dependent coverage. In fact, there is evi-\ndence to suggest that this is the case: Between\ntributions rose by twice as much for family\ncoverage as for individual coverage.18 There-\nfore, we believe that the likely bias in this\nanalysis is to overestimate the crowding-out\neffect.\nResults\nour sample reported having Medicaid cover-\nage at some point during the year they were\npregnant, and 54 percent reported having\nemployer-sponsored coverage (Exhibit 1). Al-\nmost 8 percent of all pregnant women were\nuninsured for all of 1992. The importance of\nMedicaid coverage varied tremendously by in-\ncome group.\n\u00b7 To what extent is Medicaid covering the\ntarget population? To determine the extent\nto which the Medicaid expansions have\nreached their target population, we calculated\nMedicaid participation rates for all eligible\npregnant women. Two-thirds of all pregnant\nwomen who were eligible for Medicaid cover-\nage were actually enrolled. This varied by\nMedicaid eligibility category. More than 90\npercent of those women who were eligible\nthrough Aid to Families with Dependent\nChildren (AFDC) eligibility were enrolled in\nMedicaid. Participation rates for the popula-\ntion made eligible through the poverty-\nrelated Medicaid expansions was lower, in\npart but not entirely because of the greater\nprevalence of employer-sponsored coverage\namong these women. Women with employer\ncoverage who were eligible for Medicaid un-\nder the poverty-related expansions enrolled in\nMedicaid at a rate of 30 percent, while eligible\nwomen without employer coverage enrolled\nat a rate of 44 percent. Of those pregnant\nwomen who remain uninsured, 41 percent\nhad family incomes below 100 percent of pov-\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - January/February 19 9 7\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Moreover, 81 percent of\nuninsured pregnant women were eligible for\nMedicaid coverage.\n\u00b7 Did the Medicaid expansions crowd out\nemployer insurance? To determine the extent\nof crowding out, we first examined changes in\ninsurance coverage for pregnant women by\nincome group and then compared the trends\nfor pregnant women to those of a comparison\ngroup. Based on these differences, we esti-\nmated the extent of crowding out that oc-\ncurred over the expansion period.\nChanges in health insurance coveragefor thepoor,\ncomes below 100 percent of poverty), the\nshare with Medicaid coverage increased by\ntion, the share of poor pregnant women with\nemployer-sponsored coverage increased by\npercent). The share of poor pregnant women\nwho were uninsured fell by almost seven per-\npercent--a much larger decline than for all\npregnant women, for whom the rate of unin-\nsurance fell by only three percentage points.19\nThese patterns suggest that the expan-\nsions resulted in a decline in the number of\nbirths to uninsured women living in poverty\nand virtually no crowding out of employer in-\nsurance. Given the dramatic drop in the per-\ncentage of poor pregnant women without in-\nsurance, the expansions in Medicaid appear\nto have provided a \"safety net\" for these\nwomen. The lack of crowding out is likely\nattributable in large part to the low level of\nemployer insurance coverage for households\nat this income level.\nChanges in insurance coverage for the near-poor,\nerty) were different.

To explore the reasons for the shift from\nemployer-sponsored to Medicaid coverage,\nwe compared the experience of pregnant\nwomen with that of men ages eighteen to\nforty-four, who would not have been affected\nby the income-eligibility expansions. Given\nthe lack of evidence of crowding out for poor\npregnant women, we limit our comparison of\ntrends to the near-poor. For men in this cate-\ngory, employer coverage dropped from 40.2\nloss of private coverage was offset to some\nextent by an increase of 2.2 percentage points\n(from 6.4 percent to 8.6 percent).

Also, near-\npoor pregnant women showed much larger\nincreases in Medicaid coverage than did their\nmale counterparts. Finally, near-poor preg-\nnant women showed virtually no increase in\nuninsurance, while it increased for men.\nThese results indicate that there was likely\nsome crowding out of employer-sponsored\ncoverage for near-poor pregnant women as a\nresult of the expansions. But the decline in\nemployer-sponsored coverage for men sug-\ngests the possibility that some of the switch-\ning from employer coverage to Medicaid for\npregnant women was unrelated to the expan-\nsions.

How much of the in-\ncrease in Medicaid coverage can be attributed\nto crowding out? From step three of our\ncrowding-out estimation procedure above,\nwe calculate that 45 percent of the increase in\nMedicaid coverage for near-poor pregnant\nwomen is the result of the crowding out of\nemployer-sponsored insurance.22\nWhen we make separate estimates of the\nextent of crowding out for near-poor preg-\nof poverty and for those with incomes of\npercent and 59 percent, respectively, of the\nincrease in Medicaid coverage over the period\nis attributable to the crowding out of em-\nployer insurance, although the standard er-\nrors are large because of the smaller sample\nsizes. Even though the data do not permit us\nto assess this definitively, the 27 percent\ncrowding-out estimate for the group with in-\ntent with that found for children up to age ten\nusing the same methodology.23 Together these\nfindings suggest that more crowding out will\noccur as Medicaid eligibility expansions move\nup the income ladder, and that there is much\nless crowding out for eligibility levels under\nTo estimate the total crowding-out effect,\nwe must account for the fact that two-thirds\nof women gaining Medicaid coverage over the\nexpansion period (for whom there was no ap-\nparent crowding out) had incomes below the\nfederal poverty line. When we do this, using\nstep four above, we estimate that 14 percent of\nthe overall increase in Medicaid coverage for\npregnant women that occurred between 1988\nand 1991 is attributable to the crowding out of\nemployer-sponsored coverage.24\nTo shed light on what accounts for the in-\ncreases in Medicaid enrollment over the pe-\nriod, we decomposed the increase in Medicaid\ncoverage into its components (Exhibit 3). An\nestimated 71 percent of the increase in Medic-\naid enrollment was from pregnant women\nwho would have been uninsured if it were not\nfor Medicaid. And while 14 percent of the in-\ncrease is attributable to declines in employer-\nsponsored coverage because of crowding out,\nalmost an equal amount was attributable to\ndeclines in employer-sponsored coverage re-\nsulting from either the erosion of employer-\nsponsored coverage or business-cycle effects.\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using the TRIM2 edited version of the 1989 and 1993 March Current Population Surveys.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - V o l u m e 16, Number 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Certainly, the low\nMedicaid participation rates for pregnant\nwomen covered under the expansions are a\npartial explanation for the lack of a strong\nimpact. The reason for the low participation\nrates is unclear. Further research is needed to\naid our understanding of whether women\nwho are eligible under the poverty-related ex-\npansions are unaware of their eligibility for\nMedicaid, whether they are unwilling to en-\nroll because of the stigma associated with\nMedicaid coverage, or whether major prob-\nlems remain in the eligibility determination\nprocess. Given the large percentage of unin-\nsured pregnant women who are eligible for\nMedicaid, it is important for states to develop\nstrategies to identify such women and to help\nthem receive services early in pregnancy.\nAlso, the apparent shift from employer-\nsponsored to Medicaid coverage for the near-\npoor, resulting from both the erosion of and\nthe crowding out of employer coverage,\nmeans that Medicaid is substituting for some\nof what would have been private insurance\ncoverage in prior years. This may account, in\npart, for the lack of strong improvement in\naccess to prenatal care and birth outcomes for\nthe nation as a whole. It is possible, however,\nthat states that raised the income threshold\nfor pregnant women only up to the mandated\nlevel (133 percent of poverty) and had low\nAFDC eligibility thresholds or low levels of\nemployer coverage prior to the expansions\nmay have had less crowding out and may\ntherefore see more positive effects from ex-\npanded eligibility than other states.\n\u00b7 Policy implications. First, given that the\nMedicaid expansions took place when em-\nployer coverage was deteriorating, the\nnumber of pregnant women lacking insurance\ncoverage almost certainly would have risen in\nthe absence of more generous coverage poli-\ncies for pregnant women--a trend that would\nhave been most acute for the near-poor.\nSecond, extending Medicaid coverage up\nto the federal poverty level is likely to involve\nvery little crowding out and to greatly reduce\nthe number without insurance. However, ex-\ntending Medicaid coverage above the poverty\nlevel may well lead to crowding out, given the\ngreater extent of employer-sponsored cover-\nage of the near-poor and the untenable finan-\ncial burden these families may face to retain\nsuch coverage. The effect is likely to vary ac-\ncording to how far above the poverty line eli-\ngibility is increased. At the same time, limiting\nMedicaid coverage to those in poverty will\nleave a large number of near-poor persons\nwithout insurance coverage. States that raise\neligibility standards above the federal poverty\nline may want to implement policies that en-\ncourage employers and individuals to main-\ntain their level of effort.\nSeveral states with Medicaid Section 1115\nwaivers have proposed or implemented such\npolicies. For example, Hawaii mandates that\nemployers provide insurance to all full-time\nemployees, and Rhode Island requires that\nchildren and pregnant women with incomes\nover 185 percent of poverty be under- or\nuninsured to obtain Medicaid coverage. In ad-\ndition, some states have begun to take advan-\ntage of federal legislation that allows Medic-\naid to pay copayments, deductibles, and\npremium contributions under the employer\nplans of Medicaid-eligible persons in an effort\nto maintain employer contributions.\nOur research raises three important public\npolicy questions. To what extent does Medic-\naid crowd out private insurance with expan-\nsions of the program? For what reasons do\nwomen who choose to substitute Medicaid\nfor employer-sponsored coverage do so? And\nwhat is the trade-off with such expansions\nbetween crowding out and no insurance at\nall? Definitive information on each is essential\nfor policymakers who are considering further\nchanges to the Medicaid program.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S - January/February 19 9 7\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The TRIM2 model uses the health insurance\nquestions and other data from the CPS to create\nhealth insurance status indicators for each indi-\nvidual. In addition, TRIM2 corrects for under-\nreporting of Medicaid enrollment and identifies\neach Medicaid-eligible person's eligibility cate-\ngory. To do this, TRIM2 passes each person on\nthe CPS through the various state rules for\nMedicaid eligibility to identify which persons\nare eligible for coverage. Statistical procedures\nare used to choose enough additional persons\nfrom the pool of eligible persons who did not\nreport coverage on the CPS to match the known\nenrollment figures. For example, after correc-\ntion, TRIM2 identified 24.3 million Medicaid en-\nrollees on the March 1991 CPS, a figure much\ncloser to the 24.7 million known to have been\nenrolled than to the 19.6 million reporting cover-\nage on the uncorrected CPS. The TRIM2 model\naligns program enrollees with known enroll-\nment figures in each state by age and disability\ngroup. When we use the unedited CPS, our\ncrowding-out estimates remain unchanged.\n15. We first identify all infants under age one. We\nthen match infants to their mothers using infor-\nmation on family structure and assume that the\nmothers were pregnant during the previous year.\n16. This occurs because (1) women who were preg-\nnant during the year but did not deliver in the\nrelevant March-to-March period are not identi-\nfied; and (2) not all infants can be matched with\na mother. The former issue should not bias analy-\nses of the percentage of pregnant women with\ncertain characteristics, because we are simply\ntaking a sample of pregnant women in a given\nyear: those who delivered their children in the\ntwelve months prior to the survey. The latter\nissue may affect our results somewhat if the di-\nmensions we are examining (income or insur-\nance coverage) are correlated with our inability\nto identify the mother.\n17. Although we are not certain of either the direc-\ntion or the magnitude of this effect, we believe\nthat it is likely to result in a slight underestima-\ntion of Medicaid coverage and a corresponding\noverestimation of employer-sponsored coverage\nand the uninsured. Based on 1991 data in Califor-\nnia, Georgia, Michigan, and Tennessee, we esti-\nmate that between 8 and 18 percent of all\nMedicaid-financed deliveries are to women who\nenrolled in Medicaid in the third trimester of\npregnancy. From this we estimate that the lack\nof information on changes in insurance status of\nthese women in their last months of pregnancy\ncould translate into an underestimate of Medic-\naid coverage by 3.75 percent when the whole\nsample is considered but should not affect esti-\nmates of changes in health insurance coverage. In\naddition, it may slightly underestimate actual\nMedicaid participation rates.\n18.
