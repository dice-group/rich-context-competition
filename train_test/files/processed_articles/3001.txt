Consistency of Self-Perc eived and Proxy- Reported Ancestrv\nTL) assess the consistency of self-perc e ived ancestry with ancestry as perceived by proxies, we comp ared subjects' self-classification in initial interviews with their primary classificat io n by proxies in follow-up interviews. T his compari son was restrict ed to study subjects who wer e known to have died or who were disabled.\n3. Correspondence of Self-Perceived and lnren iewer\u00ad Obseried Ancestry\nTo assess th e correspondence of  self-perceived  ancestry with ancestry as perce ived by NHANES observers, we compared subjec ts' primary self-classifi c at ion in fol\u00ad low-up interviews with their racial classification by in\u00ad terviewers a t initial int er view s. We used se lf-classif ic a\u00ad tion at follow-up ( rather  than  at  initial  int e rvi ew) because persons classified as \"Negro\" by interviewers at initial int erviews were not allowed to classify their own ancestry. The comparison here was between racial cat\u00ad egories, White, Negro, and O ther , and self-design ated ancestry that included diverse European  groups  (com\u00ad monly classified as White), Bl.a.ck and African, and other s, such as American Indian, Chinese, and Japanese (com \u00ad monly classified as neither White nor Negro or Bl.a.ck ).\n4. Correspondence of Self-Perceiwd and Funeral Director\u00ad Reported Ancestry\nTo assess the correspondence of self-perceived ancestry with race on death cert ific ates, we compared the initial self-classification of study subjec ts who died during th e follow-up period with their classification as record d by funeral directors. Death certification require s that the decedent 's race be written in; certificates provide exam\u00ad ples, White, Black, American Indian, rather than a checklist. Because subjects classified as \"Negro\" by inter\u00ad viewers were not asked their ancestry, th ese persons were excluded from this compariso n.\n5. Ancestry as Classified by Interviewer and Funeral Director\nTo assess the correspondence of  ancestral  classification by observers in different circumstances, we compared\n\noptions were available at initial interview  and  follow\u00ad up- th e fixed-option coho rt- 58.3 % (95 % CL =\n55.6 %, 61.Qt\u00be_))  of the  U.S. popula tion specified  the  same or similar primary identity in both int erv iews (Table 1 ). Sarne self-classification ranged from a low of  1.2%  (95 % CL = 0.0\u00b0t'il, 2.5%) am o ng persons  initially classifying them se lve s as American and 14 .4% (95% C L = 4.5%, 24.3%) among persons ini tially classifyi ng them se lve s as American Indian, to a h igh of 100.0% (95 % C L =  80.7 %, I 00.0%) for persons initi ally classifyin g themselves as Chinese o r as Japanese (T ab le 1). Of perso n s who initially reported that they did  not  know  th e ir  ance stry,  34.7 % (95 % CL=  25.2%,  44.1%)  also  rep orted  that  the y did not know at follow-up. The mean time from initial to follow-up interviews was 9.9 years. Consistency of self\u00ad classific at io n did not vary in any  consiste nt  pattern  by time betwe en in terviews.\n  Of persons initia lly classifying them se lves as American who changed their classification, 87.4% (95 % CL = 82.9%, 91.8 % ) subsequently specified European identi\u00ad ties, for examp le, English/Welsh or Irish; of persons ini\u00ad tially classifyin g them selves as American Indian wh o changed their classification, 86.1% (95 % C L = 78. l %, 94.2%) subseque n tly took a spec ific European ident ity.

That is , 15.4% of subjects specified ance str ies at initial in te rview that dif\u00ad fered from all four ancestr ie s specified at follow-up. Con\u00ad sistency was lower among persons spec ifying three (81.6%; 95% CL = 78.5%, 84.7%) and two (81.2%;\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I.

Patterns of consistency followed consistency between ancestry and primary identity at follow-up ( that is, lowest consistency among American and American Indian, and greatest con\u00ad sistency among European ancestries).\n  In comparison with persons specifying only one back\u00ad ground at follow-up, among subjects who specified two ethnic backgrounds in follow-up interviews, 46.7%  (95% CL = 43.6%, 49.8%) were consistent in their primary ancestral identification from first to follow-up interviews. The proportion reporting consistent primary ancestries from first to follow-up interviews decreased in subjects reporting three (36.3%; 95% CL = 31.9%,\nethnic backgrounds at follow-up.\n\nAmong 1,267 proxies in the NHANES cohort, 39.3%  were spouses or roommates of the deceased, 38.4% were children, 11.3% were siblings, and the remaining 11.0% were nonrelatives. Based on this sample, proxies in the United States did not know the backgrounds of 10.3% (95% CL = 7.6%, 12.9%) of adult subjects. Among proxies who specified a primary ancestry for subjects, self-classification of ancestry at initial interview was consistent with proxy reports at follow-up interviews for 55.1% (95% CL= 49.9%, 60.3%) of subjects (Table 1). Consistent classification was lowest for subjects initially classifying themselves as American (0.8%; 95% CL = 0.0%, 2.3%) and American Indian (13.6%; 95% CL = 0.0%, 28.6%), and highest for subjects initially classify\u00ad ing themselves as Mexican (98.3%; 95% CL = 95.0%,\n100.0 %). There were too few decedents who self-iden\u00ad tified as Chinese or Japanese at first interview to allow comparison with proxy report at follow-up.\n\n= 97.9%, 99.6%) were identified as Negro by the inter\u00ad viewer. Among subjects who self-identified as European, consistency with interviewer-assessed race was greater than 91%.\n\nBased on a sample of 1,265 NHANES subjects who were known to have died at follow-up, 95.9% (95% CL = 86.8%, 100.0%) of persons who classified themselves as American Indian in initial interviews were classified as White on the death certificate and 4.1% (95% CL = 0.0%, 13.2%) as Bku:k (and none as American Indian). Of persons who did not know how to classify themselves at initial interview, 97.0% (95% CL = 91.4%, 100.0%) were classified as White and 3.0% (95% CL = 0.0%, 8.6%) as Black on death certificates. Among other per\u00ad sons who initially specified an ancestry, there was close correspondence with racial classifications on death cer\u00ad tificates.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that ancestral identification cannot be assumed to be a fixed or singular characteristic of persons in the U.S. population. We found that clas-\n\n\n\n\nsificati o n of a person's ancestry var ie s ove r time and by method of ascerta in ment, re lations hip between person classifyin g and person classifi e d, vital sta tus of sub je ct , and spec ifi c c ategory o f ancestry.

Fifteen per ce n t of person s d id not specify the same or a similar ancestry at follow-up among fo ur ancestral backgroun ds. Forty- five per cent of persons we re classifi e d diffe re ntly by proxies in a fol\u00ad low-up int e rview . Inconsis tenc y in classifica tio n both by self and by proxy was greates t for persons wh o classifi e d them selves as American and American Indian, and low es t for persons who classified themselves as Chinese, Japa\u00ad nese. In consistenc y in th e classificati o n of diverse Euro\u00ad pean origin s was var iable.\n  C o mpariso n of th e self-classificati o n o f ancestry with the classifi c ation of race by in tervie we rs in dicates h igh corresp ondence for W hites and low co rrespondence for American Indians.\n  NH AN ES I and NHEFS were no t designed for th e present study, and th e questio n s asked at fir st and fol\u00ad low-up in tervie ws we re no t iden tical. Neve rtheless, where as th e first ques tio n refe rred to \"natio nal origin\" and th e seco nd to \"other parts of the wo rld\" and \"ethnic background,\" both also ref erred to \"ancestry.\" The dif\u00ad ferenc e in questio n s may particul arly h ave affecte d th e respo nse c h o ice \" American,\" since persons born in th e Unit ed S tat es may have co nsidered themselves to be of A merican national origin , but not of A merican ethn ic\u00ad ity. In general, howeve r, although it is possible that the questio n was interpreted differen tly  fro m  first  to  fol\u00ad lo w-up int erv ie ws, the use of co mmon concept s as we ll as ident ic al o r simil ar categories o n both occasio ns make s d iffere nt ial in terpret ation less likely.\n  The numb er and order of respon se ch oices also d if\u00ad fered in th e two int e rview s. Identic al res ponse choice s asked at diffe rent time s have differ en t meanings  if th e cho ic es ch ange. Co mpariso n amo ng classific ati o n sys\u00ad tems with diffe rin g alternatives may exagge rate in co n\u00ad sisten cy. Beca use we compared classificatio n s at two differ e nt periods in time, we  were  un able to d istingui sh ch anges du e to differen ces in the questio n from chan ges due to sh ifti n g sub ject ident it y. Diffe re n c es in ques tions and res ponse alternat iv es are also foun d in succe ssive decenni al U .S. Censuses , which are, nevertheless wid ely\nused to assess populatio n trends, mak e pro je c ti ons, est i\u00ad mate  in terce nsal  populatio n s, and  evalu ate  censuses.10\n  The  fin dings on the in consistency  of self-classificat io n o f ancestry in th is study are simil ar to  result s of a study in wh ich samples of persons in  U.S.  ho use h o lds we re int erviewe d at a 1-year int erva l and asked to indica te th e ancestry of household me mbers from a list of  altem a\u00ad tives.4 From one year to th e next,  35.3%-35.7%  of  per\u00ad sons were classified with d iffe ring anc estri es . The h ighe r rate of ov erall consisten cy th an that found in the prese n t stud y may co rrespond to the shorter time int e rval be\u00ad\ntween interviews in the previous study. Problems of consistent iden tificati on have also been noted for Hi s\u00ad\npanic populations 19 and for American India ns.2\u00b0 C en sus\nresearch ers co nclude: \"A cent ral problem is the in abilit y\n\no f the ce nsus data to reflec t a clear, un ambiguous, and\nob je ctiv e defi nition of exa ctly who is a me mber of th e Hispanic populat io n.\"19 Inconsistenc y may be explain ed\nby \"fu zzy group boundaries\" - amb iguity about the cri te\u00ad ria of group me mb e rsh ip- and \"sh ifti ng identit y\"\u00ad\nchan ges  of  a  pe rson' s  ident ity  o ver  time .19\n  The fi nd in gs on th e consistenc y o f self- and inter\u00ad viewer-classificat io n of ancestry and race in this study confirm an ea rlie r study in wh ich 100 % of self-iden tifie d Rus sians and Canadians and 99.9% of O ther Euro peans were classifie d as White by the int ervie wer ; 97.6% of self-identified Black, N egro, o r Afro-Americans were clas\u00ad sified as Black ; 83.9% of self-identifi ed American Indian or Alaskan N ative wer e classified as White or Black, o n ly 16.1%  as  Other; and  24.6%  of  self -ident ified  Asian  o r Paci fic Islanders we re classifi e d as White, 74. l % as Other.7 Finally, th e findin gs on the consistency o f self- and death certifica te classifi ca tio n of  ancestry  and race  in this stud y are similar to  a  study  in  which the  demo\u00ad graph ic in forma tion on a  sa mple  of  1986 U.S.  death cert ific ates was co mpared to in form atio n re ported by\nne xt of kin.6 A mo ng decedents rep orted by  n e xt  of  kin to be White , 99 .5% were iden tified as White o n dea th cert ific ates; ident ic al reporting was 99.0% for Black s, 78.9% for Asian/P aci fic Islanders, and 76 .3% for American Indians.\n  Th e \" meas ure ment \" of ancestry is a crit ical to o l for the elimin atio n of diffe re nces in health  status  amon g racia l/eth nic populati o ns. O ur study in d ica tes that the iden tificatio n of ancestry is problemat ic, part icularly for American Indians , persons of several Eu ropean ancestrie s, and  persons  wh o  perce ive  themselves  to   be  America n. O ur stud y indi cates that, if self-percept io n of ance stry is taken as th e stand ard  for  racial/ethni c  ident ific ation , then it should be noted th at the stand ard  it self is a fluid one, for se lf-perception changes over time.\n  Given mulciple ance stries, inco n sistency should be expect ed.  In  this  study,  compared  with  person s wh o spe c ifi ed only o ne eth nic background , pe rsons wh o spec\u00ad ified two backgrounds we re 2.4 times as likely  to  be inconsi stent in their  self-classification;  persons specify\u00ad ing  three  backgrounds  we re  2.9  times  as  likely to  be inc onsistent in their self-classific at io n ; and those wh o specifi e d four backgro und s were 3.4 t imes as lik ely to be inc onsisten t. The  mo re  heterogeneo us  one perce ives one 's ancestry to  be, the  more one's self-identificationis likely to  change  over  time.  But,  even among  persons who specified only one et h nic backgro und, 15% alter ed their self-classific atio n fro m o ne  in terview to  the next . A nothe r so urce o f diffic ult y in the assessment of an\u00ad cestr y may be the und erlyin g co ncept s th emselve s. The validity of th e concept of \"r ace\" has been questioned in recent decades; and biological notion s of \"r ace\" may be confused with cultural and  behavioral  notio n s of \"eth\u00ad nici ty.\"-21 23 Effo rt s should be made to validate the cate\u00ad gories \" race \" and \"eth nic ity,\" and, if valid , to establish basic  an th ropologic  and  other  scient ifi c principles  for the collecti o n o f public health in formati on on racial and ethnic populations. Studi es employin g th ese categorie s should clearly define and operation alize th e m so th at\n\n\n\n\nresear c hers and resp on dent s know what th e categories mean and so that  inform at io n  is compatihle  fro m snurce to sourc e. It may he that the  categories  of  race  and ethnicity do not fit stan dard criter ia of mutu al ex cl usiv\u00ad ity, exhaustiveness, and reliah ilit y, and th a t \"fuzzy lo gic\" (in which attributes need not apply or not app ly to give n individuals, but may  partially  apply) is  mor e  appropri\u00ad ate' \\ use of fuzzy lugic, howeve r, would further  cnmpli\u00ad cate the calculation of rates and other epidemiologic measures.\nFin ally, classifica tio n by se lf and othe rs is also co m\u00ad\nplicated by social att itudes an d political res pon ses to ancestral grnups and by mu lt iple and changin g percep\u00ad tions of soc ial identity in different segments of th e  po p\u00ad ulati on. Alth ough we may cont inue to use system s of ancest ral classific at io n, the interpretation of  classifica\u00ad tion will require un derstanding of the meaning  and processes of anc estral identifi cation in  dive rse  segmen ts of th e population.\n\nReferences\n1.
