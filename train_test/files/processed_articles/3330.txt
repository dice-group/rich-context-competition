The aim of this study was to investigate\nthe epidemiology of IPA in patients with liver failure in an effort to reduce patient mortality.\nMethods: The patients with liver failure (including acute liver failure , sub-acute liver failure ,\nacute-on-chronic liver failure and chronic liver failure) were recruited from 2011 to 2016. The\nclinical data of these patients were retrieved for the study.\nResults: In total, 1077 patients with liver failure were included in this study. Of the 1077 patients,\n53 (4.9%) had IPA. Forty-four (83%) patients with IPA died. Independent risk factors for IPA were\nmale sex (hazard ratio [HR] \u00bc 2.542), hepatorenal syndrome (HR \u00bc 2.463), antibiotic use\nConclusions: IPA is a fatal complication in patients with liver failure. Male sex, hepatorenal\nsyndrome, antibiotic use, and steroid exposure were independent risk factors for IPA. When\npatients with liver failure have these risk factors and symptoms of pneumonia such as cough or\nhemoptysis, clinicians should be cautious about the possibility of IPA.\n",

Invasive diagnostic proced-\nures such as fiberbronchoscopy are neces-\nsary to confirm a diagnosis of aspergillus\ninfection, but such procedures are often not\nfeasible in patients with severe respiratory\ninsufficiency and critical illness who are not\nundergoing mechanical ventilation.6\u00ad9\nMoreover, the European Organization for\nResearch and Treatment of Cancer\n(EORTC) restricted the scope of the stand-\nard diagnostic definitions to receipt of a\nsolid organ transplant, hereditary immuno-\ndeficiencies, connective tissue disorders, and\nreceipt of immunosuppressive agents10;\nhowever, these criteria cannot necessarily\nbe extrapolated to patients with liver failure.\nFew studies have been performed to\nevaluate patients with liver failure who\ndevelop IPA, and possible risk factors such\nas the ABO blood group and use of an\nartificial liver support system have received\nlittle attention. Little is known about the\nclinical presentation and treatment of IPA in\npatients with liver failure. Therefore, the aim\nof this study was to collect data about\npatients with liver failure to investigate the\nepidemiology and possible risk factors for\nIPA in an effort to reduce the mortality in\nthis population.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis retrospective study was conducted in\nthe State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis\nand Treatment of Infectious Diseases,\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, the First\nAffiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,\nZhejiang University, China. The study was\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang\nUniversity, and the need for consent was\nwaived because the study was retrospective\nand the data were analyzed anonymously.\nStudy population\nPatients with liver failure [including acute liver\nfailure (ALF), subacute liver failure (SALF),\nACLF, and chronic liver failure (CLF)] were\nadmitted into the infectious disease wards of\nthe First Affiliated Hospital, College of\nMedicine, Zhejiang University, China from\npatients were retrieved for the study. The\nfollow-up period for the patients with IPA\nwas 3 months after discharge.\nDiagnostic criteria\nLiver failure was defined according to the\nfollowing criteria specified by the 13th Asia-\nPacific Congress of Clinical Microbiology\nand Infection Consensus Guidelines for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of liver failure:11\nALF: Abrupt onset accompanied by grade\nII or higher hepatic encephalopathy (HE)\n(according to the I- to IV-grade classifica-\ntion) and appearance of the following symp-\ntoms within 2 weeks: a) fatigue with severe\ngastrointestinal tract symptoms such as\nanorexia, abdominal distension, nausea,\nand vomiting; b) progressive aggravation\nof jaundice; c) hemorrhagic tendency with\nan international normalized ratio (INR) of\n!1.5 or prothrombin activity (PTA) of\n40% and exclusion of other causes;\nand d) progressive reduction in liver size.\nSALF: Slower onset than ALF and appear-\nance of the following symptoms within 2 to 26\nweeks: a) fatigue with gastrointestinal tract\nsymptoms, b) rapidly deepening jaundice with\na total bilirubin (TBil) level 10 times higher\nthan the upper limit of normality or a daily\nincrease of !17.1mmol/L, c) occurrence of\nHE, and d) hemorrhagic tendency with an\nof other causes.\nACLF: Acute or subacute deterioration\nof liver function in patients with chronic\nliver disease, usually accompanied by the\nfollowing symptoms: a) fatigue with gastro-\nintestinal tract symptoms, b) rapidly\ndeepening jaundice with a TBil level 10\ntimes higher than the upper limit of normal-\nity or a daily increase of !17.1 mmol/L, c)\nhemorrhagic tendency with an INR of !1.5\nor PTA of 40% and exclusion of other\ncauses, d) progressive reduction in liver size,\nand e) occurrence of HE.\nCLF: Progressive deterioration and\ndecompensation of liver function in patients\nwith liver cirrhosis, usually accompanied by\nthe following symptoms: a) a significant\nincrease in TBil, b) a significant decrease in\nalbumin, c) a hemorrhagic tendency with an\nof other causes, d) ascites or other symp-\ntoms of portal hypertension, and e) occur-\nrence of HE.\nWe used the EORTC consensus defin-\nition of invasive Aspergillus infection,10\nwhich was diagnosed if the following two\ncriteria were fulfilled: one microbiologic\ncriterion (positive sputum culture) and one\nclinical criterion. In the present study, a\ndiagnosis of IPA was made based on the\nfollowing: a) positive culture of Aspergillus\nspp. from sputum and b) the presence of one\nof the following three signs on computed\ntomography: dense, well-circumscribed\nlesions(s) with or without a halo sign, air-\ncrescent sign, or cavity.\nRisk factors for IPA\nIn this study, the following variables were\nassessed as risk factors for the occurrence of\nIPA: sex, age, ABO blood group, type 2\ndiabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, malig-\nnancy, human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) infection, antibiotic use, steroid\nexposure, use of an artificial liver support\nsystem, neutropenia, gastrointestinal bleed-\ning, HE, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).\nThe definitions of some of these factors are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Student's t-test was performed for\ndescriptive analysis and comparison of con-\ntinuous variables. Fisher's exact probability\ntest and the chi-square test were conducted\nto calculate and compare the percentages for\ncategorical variables. Logistic regression\nanalysis was used to examine the effects of\nindependent variables on IPA. P value of\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant\nfor all analyses.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study cohort\nIn total, 1077 patients with liver failure\nwere included in this study. Of these 1077\ncharacteristics of the patients are shown in\nTable 2 and Table 3. The most common\nreason for hospital admission was SCLF\nantibacterial treatment for >5 days, and\n84 (7.8%) were exposed to corticosteroids\nfor >7 days. The antibacterial treatments\nwere administered for both prophylaxis\nand treatment (pneumonia, spontaneous\nbacterial peritonitis, and septicemia).\nSteroids were used to decrease persistent\nhyperbilirubinemia and treat autoimmune\ndiseases. Eight (0.7%) patients developed\nneutropenia.\nwere diagnosed with IPA. The characteris-\ntics of the patients with IPA are shown\nin Table 3.

There were no differences in the\nsurvival rate among patients treated with\ndifferent antifungal agents (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nInvasive aspergillosis has been traditionally\nregarded as an infection mainly occurring in\nimmunocompromised or immunodeficient\npatients, such as those with neutropenia,\nhematologic malignancies, organ trans-\nplantation, or HIV.12 Although invasive\naspergillosis has been reported in patients\nwith liver cirrhosis and liver transplant-\nin patients with liver failure.\nA previous study16 confirmed invasive\naspergillosis as a frequent undiagnosed com-\nplication of patients with ALF or end-stage\nliver disease, with a mortality rate exceeding\n70%. In the present study, the mortality rate\namong patients with liver failure who devel-\noped IPA was 83%. The reason for the high\nTable 3.

Patients with liver\nfailure often have a high bleeding tendency,\nwhich is a contraindication for invasive\nexaminations such as pulmonary puncture\nbiopsy or bronchoscope. Thus, only one\npatient in our study had tissue evidence of\nAspergillus fumigatus infection that was\nacquired after the recovery of liver failure.\nMoreover, liver failure is not a host factor\nof invasive fungal disease in the EORTC\nconsensus; thus, the diagnosis of invasive\nAspergillus infection in patients with liver\nfailure is quite difficult according to the\nEORTC consensus definition. Because of\ndelayed diagnosis and patients' financial\nconstraints, 17% of patients did not receive\nantifungal treatment. One study16 showed\nthat a high percentage (52.8%) of patients\nwith acute or advanced liver disease were\ndiagnosed with invasive aspergillosis post-\nmortem. Therefore, further research of the\nepidemiology, risk factors, and clinical\nmanifestations of IPA in patients with liver\nfailure may improve the diagnosis rate.\nIn the present study, the incidence of IPA\nin patients with liver failure was 4.9%.\nBone marrow transplantation, prolonged\nneutropenia, and solid organ transplant-\nation have been identified as high-risk fac-\ntors for invasive aspergillosis.17\u00ad21 Invasive\naspergillosis occurs in 1% to 9% of liver\ntransplant recipients14; this is similar to\nthe morbidity rate of the patients with liver\nfailure in the present study. As a result of a\ndepression of both humoral and cell-\nmediated immunity, liver disease alone pre-\ndisposes to bacterial and fungal infections.22\nPatients with liver failure patients are\nTable 5.

Effect of antifungal agents in the treat-\nment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\nDeath Recovery p value\nAntifungal agent\nimmunosuppressed and should be con-\nsidered an at-risk population for IPA.\nAn expert consensus23 recommended\nthat the main risk factors for IPA should\ninclude neutropenia, malignancy, and pro-\nlonged steroid treatment. In the present\nstudy, HRS (p \u00bc 0.014), steroid exposure\nwere independent risk factors associated\nwith the occurrence of IPA in patients with\nliver failure. These findings are consistent\nsteroid exposure before IPA diagnosis.\nSurprisingly, patients with liver failure who\ntook corticosteroids for >7 days had an 18-\nIPA than those who did not use corticoster-\noids or used them for <7 days.\nCorticosteroids predispose patients to\nopportunistic infections through functional\nimpairment of macrophages and neutrophil\nfunction.24 Thus, corticosteroids should be\nused with caution in patients with liver\nfailure.\nHRS may be precipitated by infection.25\nAdditionally, renal failure has been asso-\nciated with defective cell-mediated immunity\nand impaired granulocyte\u00admacrophage\nfunction, which are the predominant host\ndefenses against fungal pathogens.26\nMoreover, male sex (p \u00bc 0.035) was also a\nrisk factor for IPA; this has not been found\nin previous studies. A possible reason for\nthis result is that immune system damage in\nmale patients with liver failure is more severe\nthan in female patients. However, this needs\nfurther research.\nIn patients with liver failure, both the\nclinical diagnosis and treatment of IPA are\nchallenging. The guidelines of the Infectious\nDiseases Society of America27 recom-\nmended voriconazole as the primary therapy\nfor IPA. However, this drug is metabolized\nin the liver and potentially hepatotoxic.27\nThus, it should be used with caution in\npatients with liver failure patients. In the\nvoriconazole as an antifungal agent, and the\ndose of voriconazole was not adjusted.\nNo skin rashes or transient visual disturb-\nances were observed. Moreover, it is difficult\nto estimate whether liver injury has been\ninduced by voriconazole in patients with\nliver failure. Because such patients' liver\nfunction is severely damaged, infection\ncould lead to impaired liver function and\nultimately higher mortality.28 However,\nliver function did not worsen after using\nvoriconazole in our recovered patients.\nOur study has some limitations. First, the\nsmall numbers of patients with some host\nfactors of invasive fungal disease develop-\nment in the EORTC consensus, such as HIV\nor neutropenia, may have led to statistical\nerror. Second, liver failure is not a host\nfactor of invasive fungal disease develop-\nment in the EORTC consensus; therefore,\nthe patients in our study did not fulfill\nthe definition of proven IPA according\nto the EORTC consensus. Moreover, inva-\nsive diagnostic procedures were not feasible\nin our patients with liver failure, which\nmay have resulted in missing patients\nwith suspected disease based on radiologic\nimaging. Third, we did not collect data\non the daily corticosteroid dose and could\nnot fully explore the impact of dose or\nduration on mortality. Finally, male sex as\na risk factor for IPA was not thoroughly\nresearched.\nIn conclusion, IPA is a potentially fatal\ncomplication in patients with liver failure,\nand delayed diagnosis and treatment may\ncontribute to high mortality. Steroid expos-\nure, antibiotic use, male sex, and HRS were\nindependent risk factors associated with the\noccurrence of IPA. When patients with liver\nfailure have these risk factors and symptoms\nof pneumonia such as cough or hemoptysis,\nclinicians should be aware of the possibility\nof IPA. Early and appropriate antifungal\ntreatment may improve the survival rate in\npatients with liver failure.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the Medical and\nHealth Science and Technology Project of\nReferences\n1.
