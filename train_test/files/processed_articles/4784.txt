Urinary protein/creatinine levels\nincreased after donor nephrectomy, but after 6 months they returned to baseline values. Renal volume increased\nafter nephrectomy, but these changes did not show any correlation with uAGT/creatinine, uAGT/protein, estimated\nglomerular filtration rate or systolic/diastolic blood pressures. uAGT/creatinine at 6 months and urinary protein/\nConclusion: After donor nephrectomy, increasing uAGT levels can be the result of activation of the intrarenal renin\u00ad\nangiotensin system affecting the compensatory changes in the remaining kidney. The long-term effects of increased\nuAGT levels on the remaining kidney should be examined more closely in future studies.\n",

A low risk of the\ndevelopment of ESRD in donors suggests that different pro-\ntective mechanisms are involved in the long term.2,3\nAngiotensin II (Ang II) is an important component of the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS), and is responsible for pre-\nserving the fluid balance and vascular tone of the body by\nshowing its effect mainly on the afferent arteriole.\nNephrectomy changes the response of the kidney to Ang II\nas an increase in renal resistance, and causes an increase in\nglomerular pressure without causing blood pressure changes\nas a result of the shift of the main effect from the afferent\narteriole to the efferent arteriole. Whether these changes are\ndue to systemic or intrarenal RAS effects is unknown.5\nUrinary angiotensinogen (uAGT) is synthesised in proximal\ntubule cells and then excreted to the tubular lumen. After\ncleavage by renin, angiotensin I occurs and through the\nangiotensin-converting enzyme, Ang II develops. Increased\nintrarenal Ang II causes malignant hypertension and renal\ndamage in animal studies.6 In cell culture studies, Ang II\nwas responsible for the proliferation of glomerular cells,\ntype I collagen increase in mesangial cells and hypertrophy\nof tubular cells. So Ang II has many effects on growth and\nfibrogenesis in the kidney.7\nuAGT is a marker of intrarenal RAS, but there is still a\ndebate as to whether it may be a marker or a result of renal\ndysfunction. Previous studies showed that uAGT increases\nin diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic\nkidney disease, IgA nephropathy, chronic kidney disease\nand kidney transplant recipients.8\u00ad12\nIn this study we aimed to investigate the effects of liv-\ning donor nephrectomy on uAGT levels, blood pressure,\nGFR, proteinuria and compensatory hypertrophy of the\nremnant kidney in living kidney donors during a 1-year\nfollow-up.\nMaterials and methods\nThis was a prospective cohort study performed after\napproval by Ankara University School of Medicine ethics\ncommittee for clinical studies in accordance with Helsinki\nDeclaration guidelines, and written informed consent was\nand Renal Diseases partially funded the cost of the study.\nLiving kidney donor candidates were evaluated between\nthe study. Demographic features (age, gender, body mass\nindex, body surface area (BSA)) were recorded. Physical\nexamination (office blood pressure) and biochemical\nparameters (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cre), uric\nacid, sodium, potassium, urine protein/creatinine ratio\n(UPCR)) were obtained preoperatively and postopera-\nmated with the CKD-EPI formula (GFR = 141 \u00d7 min\nindicates the minimum of Scre/ or 1, and max indicates the\nAll donors were analysed for kidney volume by ultra-\nsonography before surgery and at months 6 and 12 to show\nthe compensatory hypertrophy in the remnant kidney.\nUltrasonography was performed with the Toshiba Applio\n(Tokyo, Japan) by using a 2\u00ad4 MHz convex transducer by\none expert radiologist. Donors were scanned from a lateral\nor posterolateral view for optimal visualisation of the kid-\nney. The maximum length of the kidney in the longitudinal\nplane was measured. The width and thickness were meas-\nured in two orthogonal directions in the plane perpendicu-\nlar to the longitudinal axis of the kidney at the level of the\nrenal hilum. The renal volume was calculated by multiply-\ning these three measurements with 0.523. The unit of\nmeasurement was the centimetre (cm).14 Renal volumes\nare corrected for BSA.15\nSamples were collected preoperatively and postopera-\nat -80\u00b0C. uAGT measurements were made with a com-\nmercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) kit (Human Total Angiotensinogen Assay Kit;\nIBL, Japan) after all samples were collected. Urine sam-\nples were stored the night before the work day at +4\u00b0C.\nELISA measurements was based on the method recom-\nmended by the manufacturer. The urine samples were\ndiluted 10-fold with enzyme immunoassay buffer. After\npreparation of the samples, the antibody solution was\nadded to the precoated plate. Following the instructions in\nthe manual, the chromogen and stop solution was added,\nrespectively, and finally the plate was read on the plate\nreader to obtain the standard curve, and the results were\ncalculated. The tests were performed in Ankara University\nSchool of Medicine, Ibni-Sina Hospital, Research\nLaboratory of the Department of Nephrology. The results\nof uAGT were obtained as ng/ml. uAGT levels were nor-\nmalised with urinary creatinine and urinary protein.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using the statistical pack-\nage for social science 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nDemographic and clinical data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD,\nmean \u00b1 SE percentage, or, if the data showed no normal\ndistribution, as medians and ranges. Temporal changes in\nindividual parameters were analysed using the two-tailed\nWilcoxon matched-pairs test, repeated measures analysis of\nvariance followed by Bonferroni's post-test, or Friedman's\nKendi Celebi et al. 3\ntest followed by Dunn's post-test as appropriate. Spearman\nand Pearson correlation tests were used to assess associa-\ntions between variables. Mixed effects models were used to\nevaluate the associations between study parameters over\ntime also after kidney donation. Significance was defined at\nResults\nTwenty healthy donors were included in the study. Four\ndonors were excluded from the study due to lack of data.\nAfter exclusions, 16 patients were included in the study. The\nmean age of the donors was 48 \u00b1 9 years. Three donors were\nmen and 13 donors were women. Five of the donors were\nparents, eight donors were spouses, two donors were relatives\nand one donor was a sibling. With the exception of one donor,\nall donors had left nephrectomy. The baseline characteristics\nof living kidney donors are presented in Table 1. Briefly, pre-\noperative mean office systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 112\n\u00b1 13 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 73 \u00b1 8\nmmHg. Mean body mass index was 29 \u00b1 3 kg/m2 and BSA\ndl. Urinary protein was 70 \u00b1 26 mg/day and creatinine clear-\nFollow-up results are given in Table 2.\nSerum creatinine was increased after donor nephrec-\ntomy and remained higher than baseline values (P<0.001).\nThe estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower\nat all follow-up points of the study and eGFR loss at the\nafter nephrectomy (P<0.01), but after that it increased\nslightly and remained high throughout the study (P<0.001).\nUPCR (g/g) was elevated after nephrectomy (P<0.01) and\nremained high for the first 6 months and then returned to\nbaseline values at the first year (P>0.05).\nOffice SBP and DBP did not show a significant change\nthroughout the study. At the 15th day, SBP was minimally\nelevated, but there was no statistical significance and the\nSBP level was never elevated above the normal limits.\nOffice DBP showed an undulating course and returned to\nbaseline levels after 1 year. There was no difference from\nuAGT/creatinine was increased about fourfold imme-\ndiately after nephrectomy (P<0.01). The increase contin-\nued until month 6 (P<0.01) and then showed a slightly\ndecrease at month 12, but was still fivefold higher than\nuAGT/protein was higher than baseline values and\nshowed a similar trend to uAGT/creatinine.

Neither uAGT/\ncreatinine nor uAGT/protein showed a correlation with\nother study parameters (P>0.05). The only statistically sig-\nnificant correlation was found between uAGT/creatinine\nKidney volume changes and also both SBP and DBP had\nno correlation with AGT excretion.\nMixed effects models were used to evaluate the associ-\nations, if any, between changes in uAGT/creatinine and\nother study parameters over time also after kidney dona-\ntion. In living kidney donors, increased uAGT/creatinine\nlevels did not demonstrate any association with the change\nseen in all parameters assessed in this study during 1-year\nfollow-up.\nDiscussion\nThis study showed that uAGT excretion increases after\nnephrectomy in healthy living donors. Although it tends to\ndecrease after 6 months, it remains high at year 1.\nProteinuria increases after nephrectomy, but returns to\nbaseline values at the first year.\neGFR decreased 31% after nephrectomy in our study and\nthis result is consistent with previous studies.After 11 years'\nfollow-up eGFR loss was 30% and no patient developed\nESRD. Mean age was similar with our study.16 Another\nstudy with 6 months'follow-up showed similar GFR loss in\ndonors.17 ESRD risk seems lower in kidney donors, but\nsome studies report increased ESRD risk especially in\nAfrican American donors.2 Kidney donors show similar\ncharacteristics after nephrectomy. At 1 month postopera-\ntively renal function stabilises and no significant change\ndevelops at 1 year follow-up.18 Long-term follow-up results\nshow that unless additional risk factors such as diabetes,\nobesity and proteinuria develop, there is no increase in\nTable 1.

A meta-analysis\nalso confirmed that kidney donors have the same risk for\ndeveloping ESRD as age-matched controls at long-term\nESRD is an important and minatory endpoint after kidney\ndonation, but clinicians have still not defined the cardiac\neffects of reduced GFR in otherwise healthy people. A con-\ntrolled study showed an increase in left ventricular mass and\na decrease in aortic distensibility in donors after nephrec-\ntomy. Therefore, in the long term low GFR due to nephrec-\ntomy may be a cardiovascular risk factor for kidney donors.20\nIn our study, we observed that uric acid levels decreased\nin the early postnephrectomy period. After the first month,\nit showed an increase and remained high during the study\nperiod compared to baseline values, but no donor devel-\noped overt hyperuricemia. This can be explained by hyper-\nfiltration after nephrectomy and low eGFR may responsible\nfor the increase in uric acid levels at follow-up. Controlled\nstudies demonstrate that kidney donors have higher uric\nacid levels than controls.21 A causal relationship between\nhyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease is still not clear;\nour study suggests that the kidney responds with hyperfil-\ntration to an abrupt fall in eGFR (nephrectomy) and donors\ndid not develop elevation of uric acid at this time, but\nthereafter with the continuous low eGFR levels uric acid\nlevels remained stable and higher than baseline levels.\nMany studies on proteinuria after nephrectomy have\nbeen reported. A controlled study of living kidney donors\ndemonstrated that the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and\ntotal protein excretion rate were similar.21 Proteinuria\nremains below 1 g/day in most donors in the long term.2 A\n40-year follow-up study showed that only 6.2% of donors\ndeveloped proteinuria and the risk factors were male gen-\nder and higher body mass index.3\nThe compensatory increase in renal volume after\nnephrectomy ranged from 22% to 30% and our results\nwere similar. Long-term follow-up studies showed that\nhypertrophy developed less in the elderly and body mass\nwas associated with kidney volume and eGFR.22,23\nIn rats, Ang II infusion after nephrectomy causes an\nincrease in renal vascular reactivity. Joly et al. demon-\nstrated that vasodilator prostaglandins decreased the con-\nstrictor effect of Ang II, but after nephrectomy this effect\nwas diminished.24 In humans, the response of the remain-\ning kidney to Ang II was also changed after nephrectomy.\nThe expected changes such as increased GFR and renal\nblood flow occurred and Ang II response was influenced\nby the baseline reactivity of renal vessels. Lower GFR,\nlower glomerular pressure and increased afferent arteriole\nresistance was associated with a greater renal response to\nAng II infusion.5 These effects may be considered as a sys-\ntemic Ang II model, but the effect of the intrarenal RAS in\nthese responses has not yet been elucidated. There are as\nyet no studies in humans about the effect of nephrectomy\non uAGT. uAGT is a marker of the intrarenal RAS and is\nproduced from the S3 segment of the proximal tubule then\nreleased to the tubular lumen and excreted with urine. Ang\nII, derived from the proximal tubule AGT, results in hyper-\ntension as a consequence of increased tubular sodium and\nwater absorption.25 Gociman et al. showed increased water\nintake and diuresis, immunostaining of AGT at proximal\ntubule sections, a 30% increase in remnant kidney weight\nand increased uAGT/kidney weight excretion in mice after\nnephrectomy.26 While the vast majority of the glomerular\nultrafiltrate is absorbed in the proximal tubule, increased\nexpression of AGT in the proximal tubule may play an\nimportant role in ensuring circulating volumetric balance.\nAfter unilateral nephrectomy, elevation ofAGT expression\nTable 2.

As the\neGFR fall increases, uAGT excretion and type IV col-\nlagen excretion was increased.27 The eGFR results of\nour donors are compatible with stage II CKD. Animal\nstudies showed that Ang II infused mice exhibit\nincreased proinflammatory cytokine expression and\nalso increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis.28 In our study\nthe positive correlation between month 6 uAGT/creati-\nnine and year 1 urinary protein/creatinine may be an\nearly sign of renal damage. An increase in uAGT \u00ad the\nprecursor of intrarenal Ang II \u00ad may be the leading find-\ning of future renal fibrosis.\nThe uAGT/protein level did not show a correlation with\nother study parameters, but increased at the follow-up\nwhen compared to baseline values and remained high over\nthe whole study. The study by Eriguchi et al.29 showed\nAGT immunostaining in injured podocytes of rats and\nintraglomerular AGT signals in patients with focal seg-\nmental glomerulosclerosis. In the human study patients\nwith focal segmental sclerosis showed higher levels of\nuAGT/protein than patients with minimal change dis-\nease.29 uAGT/protein may be a marker for podocyte dam-\nage and affect the uAGT level. When the effect of\nnephrectomy on glomerular haemodynamics is examined,\nLenihan et al. showed that increased renal plasma flow,\nhyperperfusion and hypertrophy of the remaining glomer-\nuli cause adaptive hyperfiltration without causing glomer-\nular hypertension.30 So there is no expected glomerular\ndamage, and the increase in AGT is not attributable to the\nglomerulus. Increased uAGT may be the reason for hyper-\ntrophy of the remaining kidney.\nOur study has several limitations. First, this is a pre-\nliminary study, and a limited number of living donors were\nexamined after donor nephrectomy only for 1 year. Thus\nthe results obtained should be confirmed using a larger\ncohort in the future with long-term follow-up. Second, glo-\nmerular haemodynamics and compensatory changes in the\nremaining kidney were not evaluated in detail. Although it\nis well known that the physiological function of the local\nRAS in the kidney includes the regulation of blood pres-\nsure, glomerular filtration, and reabsorption at the tubules,\nthe underlying mechanisms of compensatory changes after\nnephrectomy are still not well defined. Despite the fact\nthat uAGT has been proposed as a good marker of intrare-\nnal RAS in several reports, the long-term effects of local\nRAS activation represented by increased uAGT levels in\nthe remaining kidney should be examined more closely in\nfuture studies.\nThe increase of uAGT after nephrectomy in donors\nmay be a result of hyperfiltration and compensatory\nhypertrophy or may be a sign of early renal injury with a\nconsequence of declining GFR. Ang II plays an important\nrole in the development of compensatory changes in the\nremaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy, but it is\nstill unclear whether systemic or intrarenal RAS activa-\ntion is more important. There may be other pathways such\nas prostaglandins or paracrine/autocrine effects of Ang II.\nIncreasing the number of donors and prolongation of the\nfollow-up period may lead to the elucidation of the param-\neters associated with the increase in uAGT after nephrec-\ntomy and a better assessment of the risk associated with\nnephrectomy in renal donors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThe Turkish Society of Hypertension and Renal Diseases, a\nnon-profit national organisation in Turkey, supported the costs\nof this study.\nReferences\n1.
