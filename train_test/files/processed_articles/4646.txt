    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe major subject matter of the proposed article is the gap between global value of health and its practical implementation\nin the form of actual daily practices. The article addresses the concept of health in contemporary society and claims healthy\nlifestyle ideology to be the essence of contemporary health culture. Thus, this ideology is discussed as a basic framework\nproposed by the modern discourse with respect to body practices management as it builds up its logic of practice. Meanwhile,\nhealth-oriented lifestyle is considered to be a practical logic derived out of it. The author shows that there are four types\nof interconnection between the logical practice and the practice of logic, whereas health-oriented lifestyle is one of them.\nThe article aims to demonstrate that health-oriented lifestyle concept in its visionary ideal form is quite far from being a\npractical guide for daily human behavior. Human beings are not ready to fight all their affections although they know much\nand sometimes they feel they can do much. This means that the basic ground for an evident discord between the high value\nof health and its practical incorporation into daily activities of concrete individuals lies in the field of physicality matters and\ncivilization's disability to manage them.\n",
    "reduced_content": "sgo.sagepub.com\nArticle\nThe Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO,\n1946) states, \"The enjoyment of the highest attainable stan-\ndard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every\nhuman being without distinction of race, religion, political\nbelief, economic or social condition.\"(p. 1) Based on this\nstatement, health may be attributed to a range of underlying\nhuman values. And, indeed, it can be treated as a basic\nresource whose quality determines the usefulness of human\nlife and the nature of individual's participation in social life.\nBut when we take into account the sociocultural side of\nhealth phenomenon, it becomes clear that at different stages\nof social development there were different health discourses,\nor historically variable types of health culture. The defining\nset of health factors, health definition itself, as well as the\ngeneral value of health had been changing over the pass of\nepochs. Throughout civilizing process, the idea of health as a\ncompletely deterministic external condition (health as a\nfaith) changed by the vision of health as a result of each indi-\nvidual's personal choice. Initially, the responsibility for\nhealth fell on various natural and supernatural forces of\nexogenous nature; however, modern society tends to blame\nindividuals and their lifestyles for what is happening with\ntheir health. For instance, according to a modern point of\nview, individual health is by 60% dependent on the lifestyle\n(Lalonde, 1981). Figure 1 illustrates this vision with respect\nto health risk factors admitted by the WHO.\nAdmittedly, modern people by themselves tend to assume\nthat they really do influence on the way their lives go. For\ninstance, the latest available European Value Study (EVS)\ndata show that more than 58% of people gave the Score 7, 8,\n9, or 10 when answering the question \"How much control\nover your life?\" where 0 meant \"none at all\" and 10 stood for\n\"a great deal\" (European Value Study Wave 4 Data, 2008).\nMoreover, contemporary health discourse tends to posi-\ntion health as a great value in its temporal sense that makes\nhealth valuable as a thing in itself. Whereas globally accepted\ndefinition of health is extensively generalized,1 health gains\nthe status of the highest point of human well-being and\nself-realization.\nThereby, the concept of health, as problematized in frames\nof contemporary cultural discourse, is closely related to the\nnotion of lifestyle. Notwithstanding the fact that the value of\nhealth can be treated as somewhat significant in any kind of\nsociety, and some researchers even tend to treat health \"as\nnatural, absolute and perpetual life value\" (Shapovalova,\n2007), considerable discrepancy between the global value of\n1Institute of Sociology Nas of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine\nCorresponding Author:\nOlga Pakholok, Institute of Sociology Nas of Ukraine, 12, Shelkovichnaya\nEmail: paholokoo@gmail.com\nThe Idea of Healthy Lifestyle and Its\nTransformation Into Health-Oriented\nLifestyle in Contemporary Society\nOlga Pakholok1\n Keywords\nhealthy lifestyle ideology, logic of practice, practical logic, health-oriented lifestyle\n2 SAGE Open\nhealth and its practical incorporation into daily activities in\nthe form of an important lifestyle element can be observed.\nThe purpose of this article is to analyze the nature of this\ninconsistency and to develop a solid explanation for its via-\nbility. At that, the logic of our cogitations will be as follows.\nFirst of all, we are going to distinguish between healthy life-\nstyle ideology and health-oriented lifestyle by means of\nusing the concepts \"the logic of practice\" and \"the practical\nlogic\" of health culture in contemporary society. Then, we\nare going to appeal to some empirical evidence to demon-\nstrate how these concepts reveal themselves in real life. For\nhealthy lifestyle ideology of contemporary society, we will\naddress to the latest available European Social Survey (ESS)\ndata, and for health-oriented lifestyles (or their opposites),\nwe will turn to WHO Reports. Thus, we intend to show how\nideology is constructed to make people adhere to healthy\nlifestyle principles and what is the problem of its transforma-\ntion into health-oriented day-to-day activities.\nSo, the logic of practice is understood as the condition of\noperation and the principle of structuring for practical logic,\nwhile practical logic, in its turn, enables the actors to perceive\nthe logics of practice, to judge, and to act (Sch\u00e4fer, 2009). As\nfar as lifestyles are sets of practices and attitudes that make\nsense in certain contexts (Chaney, 1996), we are going to dis-\ncuss the context of healthy lifestyle and after that, the life-\nstyle itself. With respect to our subject area, the healthy\nlifestyle ideology will stand for the logic of practice, whereas\nhealth-oriented lifestyle will represent the practical logic.\nGenerally, the major distinction between healthy lifestyle\nideology and health-oriented lifestyle is quite transparent--\nthat is, the distinction between the idea and its practical\nembodiment. Nevertheless, it is important to provide more\nsophisticated and deep-root explanation for differentiation\nbetween these concepts. Lifestyle points at steady forms of\npersonal behavior that are the result of free choice making in\nframes of field-dictated limits; it is the personal way to solve\nsocial system antagonisms (Beck, 1992). Lifestyle represents\nan absolutely modern form of status differentiation, which\nimplies that status is derived not from the occupation or a\ncertain set of individual privileges but from the way these\nprivileges and resources are used individually. Many people,\nin particular, choose their occupation and the way of its orga-\nnization based on its compatibility with their personal life-\nstyle values (Chaney, 1996). Thus, we can assume that\nindividual choice is a very important aspect in conceptual\nreflection of lifestyle as a notion. Using Ionin's (2000)\nexpression, \"the style can exclusively be present only where\nthe choice is present\" (p. 195). Consequently, the social role,\nor the free behavior choice pattern, is the lifestyle's mole-\ncule. The style is a typical choice in frames of possible. As\nwe already made it clear, we are going to analyze the healthy\nlifestyle as the logic of practice and a certain ideological\nfield that offers its consumers a set of principles and direc-\ntions toward practical actions with respect to their body and\nhealth. Let us consider it closer.\nHealthy Lifestyle Ideology: Politics,\nMarket, and Branding\nFirst of all, it should be mentioned that healthy lifestyle ide-\nology in its general global meaning is indeed formed under\nthe dictation of real medical statistics: In contemporary\nFigure 1. The risk transition: Over time, major risks to health shift from traditional risks (e.g., inadequate nutrition or unsafe water and\nsanitation) to modern risks (e.g., overweight and obesity; World Health Organization, 2009).\nPakholok 3\nworld, the main mortality factors are disorders associated\nwith the way people live their lives. Thus, according to WHO\ndata, 10 major mortality factors among world population are\n(WHO Official Site, n.d.; see Figure 2).2\nWe can distinctly see that so-called \"civilization diseases\"\n(chronic and degenerative disorders) start to fulfill the top\nplaces among human death factors. These diseases increas-\ningly depend on the lifestyle that one chooses, and on the\nquality of one's life as well as on one's ability to use the\navailable resources of own body strategically and demon-\nstrate self-reliable orientation toward health during one's\npersonal lifestyle.\nIn general, healthy lifestyle criteria are quite simple and\nexhaustive: The list of indicators to assess the level of per-\nsonal deduction for everyday health care includes dietary\ninclinations, physical activity, and unhealthy habits (Knger,\n2005). In addition, workplace conditions, public and domes-\ntic violence, reproductive behavior, and so on can be taken\ninto account (Huss-Ashmore et al., 1992). These are the\nbasic healthy lifestyle principles, which can be found\nthroughout the whole space of social interactions--from\nschool and university textbooks (in Valeology, Principles of\npersonal and social safety, etc.) to political programs.\nHealthy Way of Life As a Matter of\nSocial Politics\nThe issue of health as a matter of state politics (biopolitics)\ncan be effectively illustrated by means of Foucault's princi-\nple of state power efficacy, which is based on simultaneous\ngeneralization and individualization. It turns out that, in gen-\neral, health is a personal decision of an individual, and at the\nsame time, it is the question of national importance. Thus, we\ncan observe panopticon effect in action, when control over\nthe members of society is very successfully implemented in\na latent way, and to a large extent they act as controllers. At\nthe end of the day, the health care system becomes a religion\nof modern society. Through the establishment of \"uncertain\nnormality\" discourse, only few can be treated as healthy, and\neveryone, in fact, becomes a potential patient, which means\nentering the field of control, risk assessment, and external\n(state) intervention (Kevin, 2007). Some researchers go even\nfurther by stating that public health policy is actually a pro-\ngram of social control packaged in a wrapper of healthy life-\nstyle idea promotion. The idea here is in an unprecedented\nself-control at the cost of provoking public excitement\nincreasing resulting as an effective system of individual\nbehavior regulation (Fitzpatrick, 2001). They even talk about\ncontemporary death of humane medicine and the rise of\nIt is important to state that we are not giving here any\nassessments of healthy lifestyle ideology as a political issue.\nWe are rather trying to find its place in frames of political\nsystem. It is obvious that healthy lifestyle ideology does not\nexist as an independent database of health state factors and\nways to maintain good health. It rather finds direct expres-\nsion in state national legislation promoting everyday health-\nfocused behaviors among general public. For instance,\nArticle 32 of the Law of Ukraine \"Basic Law of Ukraine on\nHealth Care\" proclaims the following:\n4 SAGE Open\nThe State shall promote the establishment of healthy way of\nliving by means of spreading scientific knowledge about health,\nmedical, environmental and physical education organization,\nimplementation of activities aimed at improving hygienic\nculture, creating the necessary conditions, including medical\nmonitoring of physical training, recreation and tourism,\ndevelopment of medical and athletic facilities, dispensaries,\nrecreation centres and other health facilities to combat health\nhabits which are harmful for human, establishing a system of\nsocio-economic incentives for individuals adopting healthy\nlifestyle.\nUkraine has made public policy limiting smoking and alcohol\nconsumption.\nUkrainian legislation, in general, requires from its citi-\nzens taking care of their personal health: The Article 11 of\nthe Law of Ukraine on Health contains the following clause:\n\"Citizens of Ukraine ought to take care of their health.\" The\nquestion of real force of this clause is just another one, as it\nis clear that no one (at least for now) recovers fines and puts\nbehind bars for overeating, lack of sleep, or lack of physical\nactivity. However, in some countries, the attempts to intro-\nduce a practice of tax on unhealthy lifestyles already have\nbeen made. Italian Health Ministry wants to introduce a tax\non soft drinks and alcohol (O'Leary, 2012)--several coun-\ntries, including Hungary and Denmark, have implemented\nnominal \"fat taxes\" on unhealthy foods; France has an extra\ntax on sweetened drinks; Peru plans to implement a junk\nfood tax in coming months (Koebler, 2012); and Arizona\nauthorities want to tax smokers and obese people (Forer,\n2011). Monique Currie, the deputy director of the state\nMedicaid office in Arizona and one of the advocates of this\ninitiative, said as follows:\nIf you do not want to change your life and take responsibility for\nyour health, which ultimately leads to public spending, then you\nwill have to participate in co-financing. You must take\nresponsibility for the fact that your smoking costs us a round\nsum.\nMoreover, WHO, as it is stated in the latest Watch Report\non the 65th World Health Assembly,\nshould provide technical support and expert advice to member\nstates on the implementation of fiscal, legislative and regulatory\nmeasures to improve food and nutrition. This should involve\ntechnical support to finance ministries on the administration of\nnational food tax and regulatory systems and administration, as\nwell as the production of manuals and toolkits. (WHO Watch\nAt this point, as we already mentioned, we are going to\nrefrain from evaluating political programs and social policies\nwith regard to health behavior promotion at whole. In the\nlong run, our task here is to show the key role played by the\nhealthy lifestyle phenomenon in modern sociocultural dis-\ncourse at the level of political organization.\nHealthy Way of Life As a Matter of\nMarket Strategy and Branding\nIn frames of market economy, we can consider health and\nhealthy lifestyle as power brands and elements of an excep-\ntional new philosophy that is sometimes called \"wellness\nphilosophy.\" According to expert estimations, the healthy\nlifestyle industry, which recently was just at the level of\ninfancy, promises to be a new billionary industry the next\ndecade. Today, the wellness market is compared with the\nhigh-tech sector in terms of capital turnover. The world-\nwide annual turnover in the industry, according to the anal-\nysis of the famous American businessman and economist\nPaul Zane Pilzer, is about 425 billion U.S. dollars. The\nresearcher notes that in 2000, Wellness industry in America\nhas already been the one with sales up to 200 billion U.S.\ndollars, and about a half of that amount was spent on sports\nclubs and 70 billion U.S. dollars on vitamins and minerals\nIndeed, today's society market can be the first to react\non public needs for meeting the aspirations to lead a\nhealthy lifestyle. It makes a huge amount of package offers\nthat can provide a person with a possibility to buy healthy\n(organic) food, visit gyms, health clubs, beauty salons,\nspas, and so on. The proportion of people willing to make\nsubstantial investments in their health grows very fast.\nAccording to the German economic research institution\ngest that they actively use the means to maintain personal\nThus, the market eagerly turns the idea of healthy life-\nstyle into the industry of savory versions, a plethora of pub-\nlic and commercial broadcasting programs (and books)\ndesigned to make science, technology, or philosophy of\nhealth accessible to the \"average man\" (Allen & Anderson,\n1994, p. 4). That is an easy way to make healthy lifestyle a\nfashionable and stylish trend. In modern world, everyone is\nin rush for health. The notion of healthy lifestyle has already\ngained the archetypical traits. Advertising companies use\nthis widely to make different products more attractive to\npublic. Table 1 shows the list of slogans, used in advertise-\nments presented all over the world All of them tend to dra-\nmatize the health phenomenon.\nTo that we can also add that even such unhealthily viewed\nbrands as Coca-Cola are trying to join the ranks of healthy\nlifestyle ideology. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola used the advertis-\ning slogan \"Have a Coke and a Smile\" to boost sales. These\ndays, it is more like \"Have a Coke and Hit the Gym.\"And the\nhead honchos at Coke have revamped the brand's advertis-\ning, with a focus on how to incorporate Coca-Cola products\ninto a healthy lifestyle (Breene, 2013).\nPakholok 5\nHealth-Oriented Lifestyle\nSo, we have shown that healthy lifestyle is an ideology that\nis the general logic of practice open for various kinds of prac-\ntical embodiment. Now we can go further to the analysis of\nthe practical logic itself. The interconnection between the\nlogic of practice and the practical logic is such that the first\nserves as the source for knowledge and means necessary for\nthe second. Hence, we have purposefully split the concepts\nof healthy lifestyle and health-oriented lifestyle. Healthy\nlifestyle is seen by us as a kind of clich\u00e9 that can hide or\nmask various aspects of health as a sociocultural phenome-\nnon. Meanwhile health-oriented lifestyle is the practical\nimplementation of healthy lifestyle idea in a specific bio-\ngraphical situation.\nFirst of all, when talking about health-oriented lifestyle,\nwe should mention the aspect of personal choice embedded\ninto actions that constitute it. This leads us to recognizing it\nin frames of intentionality, meaning that health-oriented\naction can be broadly defined as the intentional and reflec-\ntive activity that has been consciously thought out and aimed\nat a specific target (Verlen, 2001). Here, of course, we are\ntalking about health as such a target. Taking this intentional-\nity aspect into consideration, we may typify health-oriented\nlifestyle as a recommended act (as opposed to those allowed\nand forbidden; Sorokin, 1992). Indeed, health orientation in\neveryday practices is often viewed as a kind of above-normal\nactivity that is not usually demanded, being although highly\ndesirable. Such behavior is certainly being endorsed by\ndifferent means and, moreover, may be seen as a feat. An\nindividual showing intentional focus of his or her lifestyle on\nhealth may be perceived as being largely self-limiting,\nabstaining from various \"unhealthy temptations\" and getting\na reward for it in a form of certain positive image in public\neyes. Health-oriented lifestyle choice entails a number of\n\"awards\" on its bearer. Except the health itself, an individual\nfollowing healthy lifestyle is seen as a model of organization,\ndiscipline, purposefulness, responsibility, strong will, and\neven more. He or she is capable of making an effort, con-\nsciously \"signing\" under the constant hard work on himself\nor herself.\nOur understanding of the sense hidden under the concept\nof health-oriented lifestyle can be widened by means of\ninvolving some ideas initially proposed by Habermas in\nframes of his social action theory. Thus, according to him,\nthere are four types of social action: strategic (utilitarian),\nnormative (similar to Weber's value-rational action), dra-\nmatic, and communicative action (Habermas, 1984). If we\nanalyze the various types of relation to health and corre-\nsponding actions determined by it, we can talk about the fol-\nlowing. Strategic behavior toward health stands for the\negocentric not too far-sighted actions of individuals aimed at\ngetting fast results (when people become concerned about\nhealth in terms of short-term profit which is, in fact, a symp-\ntomatic treatment not reaching the essentially of the prob-\nlem). To some extent, this type of action is purely technical\nand temporary, not related to an attempt to implement a com-\nprehensive revision of the general life strategy behavior;\nTable 1.

However,\nwhen health is normal, the need for daily (prophylactic)\nreproduction of health depreciates sharply, health resources\nstart to be confined, yielding in a hierarchy of motives to\nother factors such as getting pleasure, building a successful\ncareer, and so on. Normative action reflects noninternalized\nattitudes, which means that under other social circumstances,\nsuch as the absence of coercion or other external influence, a\nperson would not adhere to certain principles of a healthy\nlifestyle. A striking example of such kind of activity is the\nway of life of many children and teenagers. Until they are\nunder elder control, they are normally fed, they follow opti-\nmal sleep and rest regime, and generally do not resort to bad\nhabits, but in case of the absence of control they willingly\nviolate basic principles of a healthy lifestyle. Such kind of\nbehavior is inherently infantile as it desperately lacks self-\nreflection. This means that a person imitates a lifestyle\nimposed on him or her by someone else and, accordingly,\nwould not necessarily adhere to it in other context. Dramatic\naction, in this context, expresses human desire of self-\nrepresentation, the will to be in the center of the most fashion-\nable trends with regard to a healthy lifestyle (fashion for\nphysical activity, organic food, natural personal hygiene and\nhousehold products, etc.). The actual health-oriented lifestyle,\nto our opinion, is the one representing communicative activ-\nity that is the one associated with a high level of self-\nreflection and long-term prospect; lifestyle-oriented health, in\nother words, is a lifelong strategy. Depending on the length of\nindividual's life perspective in relation to own health, and\nalso on the type of emotional commitment, all types of actions\ncan be placed on an integrated axis of coordinate (Figure 3).\nThe visionary aspect of health-oriented lifestyle can be\nbrightly illustrated by Piaget theory of cognitive develop-\nment. Health-oriented lifestyle may be regarded to as a kind\nof final stage (the highest point) of individual development\nrepresenting a well-established striving to a steady state of\ndynamic equilibrium. At the \"sensorimotor\" stage, a person\nlearns to read the signals of own body, and during this period,\nthe main type of activity is strategic that is reducing unpleas-\nant (painful) sensations and maximizing of pleasures.\n\"Preoperative stage\" corresponds to normative behavior. At\nthis stage, a person has to take certain patterns of behavior\nfor granted not passing them through his or her own con-\nscious mind. \"Operational stage\" turns on self-reflection pro-\ncess in a person, but it does not awaken awareness of the\nimportance of certain actions in the long-term prospect. And\nfinally, on the \"stage of formal operations,\" a person devel-\nops the rational structure of thinking. It provides an individ-\nual with an opportunity to understand the symbolic value,\nuse abstract strategies to understand the hidden meanings,\nand make general conclusions in the context of the develop-\nment strategy of his or her own life in terms of health.\nThus, we are talking about health-oriented lifestyle as a\ndaily production of individuals' health. This means that vir-\ntually any everyday person's activity is being correlated with\nits possible impact on health. That is what may be referred to\nas self-sufficient type of health orientation (Bredikhina,\n2006), when a person operates with a sufficient knowledge\nabout health and actively implements the principles of\nhealthy lifestyle ideology in his or her everyday practices.\nSelf-sufficiency in health orientation is the grounding foun-\ndation of health-oriented lifestyle formation. Its basic prin-\nciple is preventive character of actions related to health.

Types of actions.\nPakholok 7\nis reflected in the idea of a strategic management of health as\na finite resource accompanied with individual orientation\ntoward long-term outlook and total correlation between all\nthe aspects of vitality and possible health risks.\nAnother important dimension of health-oriented lifestyle\nis the matter of conscious lifestyle choice. Otherwise, the\nwhole idea would be a substitute, mere fashion following, a\nforced temporary measure, a compromise with oneself on the\nbasis of self-deception, and so on. Actually, we are talking\nabout the health-oriented lifestyle choice as \"the heroic\npass,\" provided with a high level of awareness and responsi-\nbility, as well as making a constant daily choice while fight-\ning with two basic neurotic obsessions of mankind that are\nAdmittedly, health-oriented lifestyle, generally speaking,\nis not a very enjoyable way of existence, which is not sur-\nprising, as \"any kind of awareness multiplies suffering\"\n(Kozlovskij, 2011). It is much easier to go with the flow, put-\nting the whole set of responsibility for one's own health on\npoor heredity, environmental pollution, and bad health care and\nliving conditions, promoting the enjoyment motto, \"We all are\ngoing to be there sooner or later.\" Opposed to that, adherence to\nhealth-oriented lifestyle is about self-improvement and self-\ncommitment; thus, it demands a huge set of efforts. This\ninvolves investment of time as well as socially constructed\nforms of attraction with all the conjugated limitations, self-\ndenial, and self-sacrifice (Bourdieu, 2002).\nDoubtlessly, that is what constitutes the ideal (visionary)\npractical logic. It is hardly that much commonplace when\nwe shift our attention to empirical reality. The latest usually\ndazzles with a vast range of destructive practices of all\nkinds and forms--from poor eating habits to high levels of\nalcohol and drugs consumption. The following data (see\nFigure 4) show some figures on prevalence of these\nunhealthy activities and their consequences worldwide\nAnd here is WHO projection on what is going to happen\nif people continue to live like they do now (Figure 5).\nNote. IHD = Ischemic heart disease.\n8 SAGE Open\nWe can see that the interconnection between the logical\npractice and the practice of logic is quite compound. Here,\nwe were talking about four types of that interconnection,\nnamely, strategic, normative, dramatic, and communicative\ntypes of health orientations. We also stated that only the lat-\nest can be seen as pure health-oriented lifestyle. So here we\nare getting close to the question why this visionary highly\nvaluable and truly beneficial strategy for organizing life\ndoes not become a commonplace reality for majority of\nindividuals. We believe here that the main reason for that is\nrooted deep into cultural codes of Western civilization.\nAccording to Elias (2000), civilizing process is about mov-\ning toward greater suppressing and controlling of the affec-\ntive side of human identity. Still, the problem is that\nnotwithstanding all the civilizational efforts to bring the\nphysicality under control, the body keeps dictating its own\nrules: All kinds of dependences, emotional or physical, mild\nand severe, are manifest illustrations for this. Thus, civiliza-\ntion progress, being significantly successful in bringing\nmore instruments for rational control and providing mass\npopulation with the necessary knowledge and means for\ncontrol over physicality, has to face that the latter still is too\nstrong. After all, physicality is much more \"experienced\" in\ncomparison with \"modern ratio.\" The thing is that body is a\nfield for direct implementation of any general healthy life-\nstyle ideological principles.And the problem hidden beneath\nthat is body's own rules of functioning that often lead a per-\nson toward gaining momentary pleasures without assuming\nhis or her later consequences. Thus, people really have a\nhigh value of health and they usually understand the set of\nbasic principles of healthy lifestyle but they still WANT to\nget pleasure. Although there was no target international\nresearch that could corroborate this thesis, we can demon-\nstrate the ambivalence between cultural and affective by\nmeans of existent ESS data (Figure 6).\nWe can see here that those culturally driven values (like\nimportance to follow traditions and customs, to follow the\nrules, to behave properly) do not confront with the value of\nfreedom and craving for hedonistic values (like importance\nto seek fun and pleasure, try different things, and have a good\ntime).\nThus, even within the social sciences, one should consider\nthe physicality in the sense that, despite the general civiliza-\ntion tends to \"curbing affections\" (Elias, 2000), the body\ncontinues to dictate its own terms and conditions, often not\neven allowing the consciousness to enter the decision-mak-\ning process.\nTo summarize, we can conclude that healthy lifestyle ide-\nology, which is embodied in politics and economy, is not\nFigure 5. Projected trends in total deaths for selected causes,\nNote. ESS5 = European Social Survey Round 5.\nPakholok 9\nthat easily transformed into health-oriented lifestyle.\nEventually, we have ascertained that a lifelong adherence to\nhealth-oriented lifestyle is really challenging and hard,\nwhich can be an additional reason why a wide range of\ndestructive practices are there in the place. However, the\nmain reason, as we put it, lies in the milieu of civilization's\nincapacity to curb physicality and its affections. As long as\ncivilization largely puts this responsibility on personal\nchoice and lifestyle decisions, individuals find themselves\nstuck between integrated knowledge about health and\nhealthy lifestyle and their emotional strivings and desires\nfor obtaining pleasure (which too often, although not neces-\nsarily always, tend to be not that healthy). Taking the fact\nthat short-term gains tend to prevail over long-term benefits\ninto consideration, the body usually wins. Moreover, we\npointed out that there is a certain underrepresentation of\nphysicality matters (as determinants of human behavior) in\nsocial sciences and in modern health discourse at large. The\nthing is that civilization, despite its general tendency to fight\nfor human health, simply cannot afford raising individuals\nwho would be deeply concentrated on filling their bodies\nwith mindfulness in frames of communicative health-ori-\nented lifestyles. At long last such people would rather be\nascetics than social beings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social\nwell-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\"\n(Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization\n2.
