Furthermore, the experience of\nincarceration is unevenly distributed. Black Americans, for example, make\nup 12.3% of the general US population, but they comprise 38% of state or\nfederal correctional institutional populations (West et al., 2010; Humes\net al., 2011). Black Americans often have difficulty accessing mental health\nresources that are sensitive to and fulfil their clinical needs, and yet they\nare an under-researched group in the field of psychology. Indeed, many Black\nAmericans have better access to mental health resources in jail than in their\nhome community (Youman et al., 2010). Many come from low income fam-\nilies and/or disadvantaged neighbourhoods, so they may be vulnerable to\ntrauma exposure and subsequent PTSD (Brewin et al., 2000; Gapen et al.,\n2011). Thus, research on PTSD and incarceration may be particularly rele-\nvant to better understanding of the mental health needs of Black Americans\nand changing this situation.\nLifetime rates of trauma exposure are high in incarcerated populations,\nalthough they may be disproportionately so in certain subgroups, such as\nand colleagues (1999) surveyed women arriving in prison, about half of\nwhom were African American, and found that 70% of the sample reported\nhaving experienced severe physical violence and 59% sexual abuse before\nthe age of 18years, much higher than rates reported in national surveys in\nthe general population. Briere and Elliott (2003), for example, found that\njust under a third of women in general report experiences consistent with\nchildhood sexual abuse. In custodial settings, further victimisation may oc-\ncur; one state-wide epidemiological survey found that approximately 40%\nof male and female prisoners had experienced sexual or physical violence\nin the 6months prior to assessment while incarcerated (Wolff et al., 2007,\nAlthough there is now plentiful evidence of high rates of psychopathology\namong prisoners (Fazel and Seewald, 2012), there is little information available\non some specific disorders, PTSD among them. Goff et al. (2007), in their sys-\ntematic review, found that of 103 studies identified pertaining to mental health,\nonly four examined PTSD; its prevalence ranged between 4% and 21%, but they\ndid not analyse social or ethnic subgroups.\nOur aim, therefore, was to test for any relationship between PTSD and incar-\nceration in a nationally representative sample of Black Americans.\nAssociations between PTSD and incarceration 111\nMethod\nSample and procedures\nWe used data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) (Jackson\net al., 2004b). The NSAL was carried out as a supplement to the National\nComorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) to investigate racial, ethnic and cul-\ntural influences on psychopathology and health; it includes incarceration data\nonly on Black Americans, limiting comparison to other racial groups. Black\nAmerican is the term adopted by the NSAL to encompass participants of African\ndescent currently living in the USA who self-designate their racial identity as\nAfrican American or Afro-Caribbean.\nThe sample was collected using the same four-stage area probability sampling\nprocedure used in other Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology (CPES) studies,\nwith data adjusted for oversampling, and household-level and person-level non-\nresponse. Further explanation of recruitment strategies, materials and procedures\nused in the CPES studies are described elsewhere (Heeringa et al., 2004; Jackson\nAmericans were included in our analysis.\nMeasures\nThe NSAL diagnostic questionnaire was constructed from the World Health Or-\nganisation's expanded version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-\nview (CIDI), developed for the World Mental Health (WMH) Survey\nInitiative following the structure of the NCS-R (Kessler and \u00dcst\u00fcn, 2004), using\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Diagnostic in-\nterviews were conducted by trained lay interviewers using computer-assisted\ntechnology with Blaise programming to accommodate the complicated diagnos-\ntic algorithms and skip patterns. Prior versions of the WMH-CIDI have been\nshown to have high concordance with blind clinical appraisals (Kessler et al.,\n1998). These data were collected after incarceration at one single point in time\nfor each participant.\nPotentially traumatic event history and posttraumatic stress disorder\nThe WHO-CIDI PTSD interview section assessed exposure to several different\nDSM-IV-TR criterion A1 potentially traumatic events (PTEs), ranging from\ncombat to natural disasters, and asked respondents to indicate whether each\nevent occurred (yes/no); this tool does not include a frequency assessment. After\nthe trauma history was completed, participants were asked to identify the worst\nPTE and presence or absence of PTSD symptoms specific to that event assessed.\nIn this interview, symptom assessment began with the most PTSD-specific\nsymptom cluster (i.e. cluster B, re-experiencing symptoms). Skip algorithms were\nimplemented after each cluster (B, C and D) so that if an individual did not meet\nthe threshold for any one cluster (i.e. only experienced one avoidance symptom\ninstead of the required three), the remaining symptom clusters and/or symptoms\nwere not assessed and presumed absent or missing. Although this approach is\nefficient, it makes analyses of the full range of symptoms for any trauma deemed\nupsetting enough to trigger the symptom assessment untenable. Information\nabout the PTE considered the worst or the only PTE identified was used along\nwith symptom ratings to generate diagnoses of PTSD. Neither past 12months\nnor lifetime PTSD diagnoses necessarily correspond to presentation at the time\nof interview. This interview assessment tool has adequate reliability\n(kappa=0.75), but it underestimates interpersonal PTE exposure (Schlenger\nTo examine how the characteristics of the worst PTEs were related to incar-\nceration history and PTSD status, worst traumatic event was defined as a categor-\nical variable with two classes, primary traumas and secondary traumas; this\nclassification approach is similar to that used in prior epidemiological research\n(Sledjeski et al., 2008; Pilver et al., 2011). Primary traumas occurred directly to\nparticipants and comprised events such as physical assault and combat. Second-\nary traumas were those either witnessed by participants or the participant learned\nthat it had happened to someone close to them. Number of PTEs was defined as\nan ordinal variable with four levels (no event; one event; two to four events; five\nor more events).\nIncarceration history\nThe incarceration questionnaire covered the number and length of time spent in\nvarious incarceration settings (e.g. reform school, detention centre, jail and\nprison). This questionnaire was piloted before being administered to Black\nAmericans in the NSAL study only, rather than all CPES study participants.\nThe incarceration section screening item asked, `Have you ever spent time in a\nreform school, detention center, jail, or prison?' Because of conceptual differences\nand low numbers of reform school and detention centre experiences (119), these\nwere excluded from analyses; thus, for this study, the binary incarceration\nvariable was defined as confinement in a jail or prison. Data on length of time in-\ncarcerated were not included because of lack of consistency and high rate of\nmissing data.\nDemographic covariates\nIn line with previous research (Sledjeski et al., 2008; Pilver et al., 2011), demo-\n50+years), educational level (any college vs others), household income\nMidwest; south), urbanicity (urban vs rural), marital status (living as\nAssociations between PTSD and incarceration 113\nif married/married vs single) and race/ethnicity (African American vs\nAfro-Caribbean). Family member currently incarcerated was defined by its pres-\nence among first-degree relatives only.\nStatistical procedures\nAnalyses were conducted using Taylor Series Linearisation with Statistical\nAnalysis Software-callable SUDAAN version 10 to estimate standard errors\n(SEs) and confidence intervals (CIs) that may account for the design effects in\ncomplex surveys. Weighted frequencies, adjusted to represent the US civilian\npopulation, were computed to detail the demographic characteristics of the total\nsample as well as by history of incarceration (Table 1). Statistical associations\nwith demographic characteristics by incarceration history status were tested using\nWald chi-square. Multiple logistic regression models were conducted to produce\nadjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs so as to examine the association be-\ntween incarceration history and PTSD diagnosis (lifetime and past 12months);\nall models were adjusted only for demographic variables significantly related to\nincarceration at the bivariate level (p<0.05 in Table 1).\nResults\nDescriptive data\nFive thousand and eight Black Americans were included in our analyses. Their\ndemographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.\nRespondents in the 30\u00ad39 age category were more likely to have prison expe-\nrience compared with those in the 18\u00ad29 range. Respondents with no college ed-\nucation were more likely to have prison experience compared with those who did\nhave college experience. There was no significant difference between jail and\nprison subgroups in age, education of PTSD, so we treated experience of incarcer-\nation as a single category in subsequent analyses.\nSE=0.3) indicating prison time.

Consequently, all these variables were included in multivariate\nanalyses.

Participants with a history of incarceration ex-\nperienced an average of 5.15 (SD=3.51) PTEs, whereas those without such a his-\ntory had experienced an average of 3.26 (SD=2.79) PTEs; adjusting for\ndemographic covariates, this difference was significant ( =1.68, SE=0.24,\np<0.001). In the entire sample, approximately 77% of the sample experienced\ntwo or more PTEs (Table 2).\nMultiple weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses, with incarceration\nas the dependent variable and potentially traumatic incidents together with the\ndemographic variable highlighted as the independent variables, revealed that a\nhistory of incarceration was significantly and independently associated with a va-\nriety of PTEs (Table 3). Specifically, respondents with a history of incarceration\nwere more likely to have experiences of car accident (AOR, 1.9), man-made\ndisaster (AOR, 1.7), being beaten by a partner (AOR, 2.7), being beaten by an-\nother person (AOR, 3.5), mugged (AOR, 2.4), raped (AOR, 2.1), sexually\nassaulted (AOR, 1.7), stalked (AOR, 1.8), fought in combat (AOR, 1.7), to\nhave done something that killed someone (AOR, 3.0) or something that injured\nsomeone (AOR, 3.1). Further, respondents with a history of incarceration were\nmore likely to have someone close to them experience a trauma (AOR, 1.8), wit-\nness a fight (AOR, 3.0) or witness another person seriously injured (AOR, 2.6).\nResults from multiple weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses of the\nlikelihood of PTSD status, given incarceration history while controlling for de-\nmographic factors, revealed that a history of incarceration was about twice as\nAssociations between PTSD and incarceration 117\nTable 2: PTSD diagnosis and characteristics of the study sample by incarceration history status\nchi-\nsquare p valueb\nn % (SE)a n % (SE)a n % (SE)a\nNote:\nSE = standard error; PTE = potentially traumatic event; PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder.\naWeighted percentages for categorical variables and standard error (SE) for continuous variables.\nbp value from Wald chi-squared test.\nTable 3: Weighted multivariate logistic regressions demonstrating the relationship of incarceration history to PTE prevalencea\nPrimary traumas Secondary traumas\nNote:\nPTE = potentially traumatic event; primary traumas are those experienced directly by the respondent, secondary traumas are those witnessed by the\nrespondent.\nBold indicates statistical significant findings.\naAdjusted for ancestry, sex, age, education, income, region, urbanicity and family incarceration status.\nAssociations between PTSD and incarceration 119\nlikely among those with PTSD as among those without, whether this was taken\nadjusting for demographic covariates. Further, after adjusting for number of PTEs,\nincarceration history remained significantly associated with lifetime PTSD\nDiscussion\nIn this study of a nationally representative sample of Black Americans, we found\nthat not only had those with incarceration histories elevated rates of exposure to\npotentially traumatic experiences, but also they were more likely to be suffering\nwith PTSD than their peers who had not been incarcerated. This relationship\nremained significant even after adjusting for demographic covariates. This\nelevated risk denotes significant mental health needs.\nAlthough it is unclear what discrete risk is associated with each PTE, it is pos-\nsible that the cumulative risk of these events comports vulnerability. Some of the\nPTEs more likely to have been experienced in the incarcerated population would\nalso be those expected to occur within incarceration facilities; those with a his-\ntory of incarceration, for example, were two to three times more likely to witness\nanother person seriously injured or physically beaten by another person and over\nthree times more likely to have done something that injured someone. Regardless\nof the temporal relationship of PTEs, PTSD and incarceration, this indicates\nneed for trauma-specific services within this population.\nOur findings suggest that formerly incarcerated Black Americans had twice\nthe likelihood of 12months and lifetime PTSD endorsement. Although other\nliterature on risk factors for PTSD suggests that demographic variables tend to\nhave small effects, in our study, a number of demographic variables were associ-\nated with incarceration status. Their influence was small--and controlled for in\nfinal models, so in this sample, experience of incarceration was functionally\nsimilar to the risk of experiencing a trauma sufficient to precipitate PTSD. This\nrelationship remained significant for lifetime PTSD even after controlling for\ngreater PTE exposure and demographic covariates, indicating it is likely incarcer-\nation itself that imparts a risk for developing PTSD. In other words, even com-\npared with persons with analogous trauma exposure and demographics, the\nexperience of incarceration increased the likelihood of meeting diagnostic\nthreshold for lifetime PTSD.\nOur findings have broad implications for the criminal justice system and pub-\nlic health, as they may mean that incarceration has the potential to have an im-\npact on the psychological health of detainees. Indeed, some research has shown\nthat men with PTSD who were incarcerated and released back in the community\nwere more likely to reoffend than men without PTSD (Kubiak, 2010). Thus, ef-\nfective treatment for PTSD symptoms for those incarcerated in jails/prison is in\nthe best interest of the community and can be carried out successfully with cur-\nrent evidence-based, trauma-focused programmes (Wolff et al., 2012).\nBecause of the cross-sectional nature of the data, we were not able to assess\nthe temporal relationship between PTEs, PTSD and incarceration, nor the effect\nof length of time incarcerated. It would be fruitful to take a more longitudinal\nperspective in future research. More specific questions might then also be an-\nswered; for example, is it the inherent stress of incarceration, which includes lack\nof autonomy and changed social relationships, or the increased risk of violence\nduring incarceration that most influences the likelihood of experiencing PTSD\namong incarcerated individuals?\nLimitations\nThe designers of NSAL included the incarceration survey as a first national test\nof including this type of survey in a general population-based epidemiological\nstudy, but they chose only to do so in one of the populations most affected by\nincarceration--Black Americans. Thus, incarceration data were not available\nfor comparison from other ethnic or racial groups, so it is unclear whether the\nincreased prevalence of PTSD found among incarcerated persons may be lim-\nited to the repeatedly PTE-exposed members of the Black American community\nrather than incarcerated persons in general. Regardless, results indicate that the\nnegative mental health consequences are prolonged. Indeed, this is in spite of\nthe lack of frequency data for the PTEs; therefore, this relationship may even\nbe underestimated. In addition, we may have underestimated these difficulties,\nas Black Americans are more likely than other racial minorities to be currently\nincarcerated or homeless; these two populations are excluded from national\nhousehold surveys, potentially biasing estimates of mental health disorders\n(for information on this methodological issue in the NSAL, see Jackson et al.,\n2004a). Finally, given the NSAL's PTSD assessment methods, discontinuing as-\nsessment for PTSD once minimal criteria were met, the severity of DSM-IV-TR\nPTSD symptoms could not be evaluated. This almost certainly means that the\nseverity of PTSD was underestimated in this sample, and limits comparisons\nwith DSM-5 estimates.\nConclusions\nWe found increased exposure to traumatic experiences and increased prevalence\nof both past 12months and lifetime PTSD among Black Americans who had ever\nexperienced incarceration in jails and/or prisons. Black Americans who had been\nincarcerated were at least twice as likely to have had PTSD as those who had not\nAssociations between PTSD and incarceration 121\nbeen incarcerated, even after adjusting for demographic covariates and trauma\nexposure. These findings indicate incarceration itself may impart risk for PTSD.\nTaken in the context of prior literature, these results suggest a pronounced need\nfor comprehensive psychological services for Black Americans who have experi-\nenced incarceration as well as for evidence-based trauma therapy for those cur-\nrently incarcerated. Future research is recommended to investigate how\nincarceration may precipitate, maintain and/or exacerbate PTSD among\nprisoners.\n"
