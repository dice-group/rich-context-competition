ESRD\ncarries substantial economic burden, with a cost of $24\nbillion per year in the USA, a figure that is increasing\nannually [6]. Despite this, our understanding of the causes\nof kidney disease is limited.\nIn animal models of CKD, serum phosphorus concentra-\ntion is directly associated with renal structural changes and\nfunctional decline [7]. In humans, hyperphosphatemia is as-\nsociated with rapid progression of established CKD [8\u00ad10]\nand the development of ESRD [8, 10]. Hyperphosphatemia\nas observed in advanced kidney disease [11] or tumoral\ncalcinosis [12] is associated with accelerated vascular calci-\nfication and the development of arteriosclerosis in humans.\nIn light of these observations, we sought to determine\nwhether serum phosphorus is associated with incident CKD\nintheOffspringcohortoftheFraminghamHeartStudy(FHS).\nIn a complementary analysis, we further assessed whether\nserum phosphorus is associated with incident ESRD in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), a nationally representative study in the USA.\nMaterials and methods\nFHS sample\nThe design of the Framingham Offspring Study is detailed elsewhere [13].\nFor the present analysis, participants who had serum phosphorus measured\nat the second examination cycle (1978\u00ad81), who also attended the eighth\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA 2011.

The median follow-up was\n25.1 years. All participants provided written informed consent, and the\ninstitutional review board of the Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massa-\nchusetts approved the study.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nA full description of NHANES III is available elsewhere [14]. Briefly,\nNHANES III was a national probability sample of US non-institutionalized\nadults !18years of age whounderwenta baselinephysical examinationand\nlaboratory testing, had vital status information available at follow-up and\navailable linkage to Medicare and Medicaid files (n \u00bc 13 372). The median\nfollow-up of participants included in the present analysis was 9.1 years.\nNHANES III was approved by the institutional review board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics and each participant signed an informed con-\nsent. The institutional review board at the Albert Einstein College of Med-\nicine determined the current NHANES analysis to be exempt.\nAssessment of serum phosphorus level\nFasting serum phosphate levels were drawn at the baseline visit in FHS. In\nNHANES, a random subset of approximately one-third of participants was\nassigned to fast overnight prior to their study visit. The remaining approx-\nimately two-thirds of the sample did not fast. In the FHS, serum pho-\nsphorus was measured using a standard colorimetric method (Roche\nDiagnostics, Alameda, CA), and the intra-assay coefficient of variation\nwas 5.6%. In NHANES III, serum phosphorus was measured using a\nHitachi model 737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diag-\nnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The coefficient of variation was 1.8\u00ad2.8%.\nMeasurement of risk factors in FHS\nIn FHS, participants underwent examinations approximately every 4 years.\nEach examination visit comprised a detailed medical history, physical ex-\namination including blood pressure (BP) measurements, anthropometry\nand laboratory assessment of risk factors. Two BP measurements were\ntaken using a mercury sphygmomanometer after 5 min of rest, and the\naverage was used in the analyses. Hypertension was defined as systolic\nBP ! 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ! 90 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensive\nmedications. Body mass index (BMI) was defined as weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of height in meters. Persons who reported having\nsmoked cigarettes during the previous year were classified as current smok-\ners. Fasting levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood\nglucose were measured using standardized assays. Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined as a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher\nor the use of insulin or any hypoglycemic agents. Proteinuria was assessed\nusing urine dipstick tests (Ames Labstix, Elkhardt, Indiana) dipped for 1\nmin in spot urine samples collected during the clinic visit [15]. Proteinuria\nwas defined as dipstick protein trace or above.\nPrevalent CVD was defined as a history of one or more of the follow-\ning: non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina pectoris (stable or unstable),\nstroke or transient ischemic attacks, peripheral vascular disease or con-\ngestive heart failure. CVD events were adjudicated by a committee of three\nexperienced investigators.\nMeasurement of risk factors in NHANES III\nIn NHANES III, interview questions, physical examination and laboratory\nvalues were assessed at baseline and processed per a standardized protocol\n[14]. BP was measured six times following a standard protocol. Hyper-\ntension, diabetes and BMI were defined as in FHS. Participants were\nconsidered to have baseline CVD if they reported a history of heart failure,\nstroke and myocardial infarction or had reported a surgical or percutaneous\nintervention for any of the above. Participants who reported having\nsmoked !100 cigarettes during their lifetime were classified as current\nsmokers if they answered affirmatively to the question `Do you now\nsmoke cigarettes?' Low socioeconomic status was defined as 200% of\nthe poverty index. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was assessed using\na spot urine sample. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio and C-reactive protein\n(CRP) were log-transformed to achieve normality for statistical analyses.\nAssessment of eGFR and incident CKD outcome\nIn the FHS, the primary outcome studied was the development of incident\nCKD, defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.732 using the Modification of Diet\nin Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [16], by the eighth examination cycle\n(2005\u00ad08). This definition of incident CKD is consistent with our prior\nwork in this area [17]. It has been widely used in prior epidemiological\nstudies, has relatively good agreement with other definitions of incident\nCKD and demonstrates relatively consistent risk factor associations\n[18]. Serum creatinine levels were measured using the modified\nJaffe\n\u00b4 method. In NHANES III, ESRD incidence was defined as initiat-\ning chronic dialysis. ESRD cases through 1 July 2001 were identified\nthrough linkage of the NHANES III database with Medicare files. Spe-\ncifically, the ESRD Patient Master File and Death Notification (Form\n2746) was used to identify participants initiating chronic dialysis ther-\napy following their NHANES III study visit. In both studies, calibration\nof serum creatinine values to the Cleveland Clinic Laboratory standard\nStatistical analyses\nFramingham Heart Study. Baseline characteristics of study participants\nwere calculated by phosphorus category and the statistical significance of\ndifferences compared using v2 tests for categorical and one-way analysis\nof variance for continuous variables. Correlation between serum phospho-\nrus values and CKD risk factors were evaluated using Pearson's correla-\ntion test. Baseline phosphorus was considered both in categories (<2.5\ntinuous variable (per 1 mg/dL higher phosphorus level). The association\nbetween phosphorus category and risk of CKD was tested using logistic\nregression models. Two sets of regression models were constructed: (i)\nadjusting for age, sex and eGFR, (ii) a multivariable model adjusting for\nage, sex, eGFR, BMI, diabetes mellitus, systolic BP, treatment for hyper-\ntension, smoking and HDL cholesterol. In these regression models, the\nreference category for the phosphorus levels was 2.5\u00ad3.49 mg/dL, which\ncontained the highest number of individuals. A linear trend in odds ratios\n(ORs) was calculated across categories.\nAs serum phosphorus is associated with CVD risk and cardiovascular\nmortality [20, 21], and because CKD and CVD may be causally linked\n[22], we performed a sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we repeated the\nlogistic regression analyses after excluding individuals with prevalent\nCVD in a secondary analysis. We performed two additional sensitivity\nanalyses, adjusting for serum calcium and dipstick proteinuria.\nThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. As in FHS,\nbaseline phosphorus was considered as both a categorical and continuous\nvariable in NHANES III. However, there were insufficient ESRD cases in\nNHANES III (n \u00bc 65) to perform an analysis using four baseline phos-\nphorus categories. As the risk for kidney disease appeared to increase in\nparticipants with serum phosphorus !4 mg/dL in FHS, we categorized\nNHANES III participants as having serum phosphorus !4 mg/dL or <4\nmg/dL in the categorical analyses. In sensitivity analyses, we also eval-\nuated levels above and below 3.5 mg/dL and 4.5 mg/dL, separately. Base-\nline characteristics of the study participants were calculated by phosphorus\nlevel (<4 mg/dL and !4 mg/dL). Poisson regression models were used to\ncalculate the relative risk (RR) for incident ESRD associated with serum\nphosphorus. Follow-up time for each individual was calculated as the\nnumber of days between their baseline visit and the incidence of ESRD,\ndeath or 31 December 2000, whichever occurred first. Due to the small\nnumber of events, statistical adjustment was made using propensity score\nanalysis. The propensity for having phosphorus levels !4 mg/dL was\ndetermined using a logistic regression model with age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nhypertension, history of CVD, diabetes mellitus, BMI, HDL cholesterol,\nuse of cholesterol-lowering medications, CKD, serum albumin, log uri-\nnary albumin-creatinine ratio, log CRP and low socio-economic status as\nthe covariable vector. In addition, serum phosphorus was also modeled as\na continuous variable. As in the FHS analysis, secondary analyses were\nconducted for participants without CVD at baseline.\nAnalyses of FHS were performed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Insti-\ntute, Cary, NC). NHANES analyses were performed using Stata version 10\n(Stata Corp., College Station, TX), accounting for its complex survey\ndesign. Also, to account for the over-sampling of subgroups and partic-\nipant non-response, all NHANES III analyses incorporated sampling\nweights. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRole of the funding source. FHS is funded by the National Heart, Lung\nand Blood Institute (N01-HC-25195). The funding sources had no role in\nthe design, conduct or reporting of the study or in the decision to submit\nthe report for publication. NHANES III and Medicare linkage data was\nperformed and made publicly available by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS). The NCHS had no role in the design, conduct, reporting\nor the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nCross-sectional correlates of serum phosphorus level in\nFHS\nThe demographic characteristics of the FHS participants\nare shown in Table 1.

We were able to extend our findings and\nadditionally document an association between serum phos-\nphorus and ESRD in the nationally representative\nHyperphosphatemia is a common complication of estab-\nlished CKD and the relationship between phosphorus and\nprogression of kidney disease has been characterized in this\ncontext [23]. Several studies report elevated serum phos-\nphorus levels as predictive of the rapid progression of kid-\nney disease [8\u00ad10] and the development of ESRD [10]. The\npresent study extends the current literature by demonstrat-\ning an independent association between phosphorus level\nand both incident CKD and ESRD.\nThere are several potential mechanisms that may explain\nour observations. First, baseline eGFR was substantially\nincreased in the highest phosphorus group in FHS, repli-\ncating a relationship observed in an earlier analysis of the\nCholesterol and Recurrent Events study [21]. A confounder\nlikely mediates this association, as neither phosphorus ad-\nministration nor serum phosphorus concentration has a di-\nrect effect on GFR [24, 25]. Diet is one such potential\nconfounder, as serum phosphorus concentration correlates\ndirectly with dietary phosphate intake in humans [26]. A\nhigh-protein diet induces renal hyperfiltration in animal\nmodels, [27] patients with CKD [28] and in healthy volun-\nteers [28], and may accelerate renal functional decline in\nTable 2.

Conversely, dietary protein restriction attenuates\nhyperfiltration in animal models of kidney disease [30\u00ad36]\nand delays the progression of established kidney disease in\nhumans [37\u00ad39]. Processed foods high in phosphorus-\nbased food additives [40] are associated with elevated\nphosphate intake and serum concentrations in CKD pa-\ntients [41], and increasing poverty is also independently\nassociated with increased serum phosphate, possibly medi-\nated by a diet rich in such processed foods [42].\nSecondly, the association between serum phosphorus\nand risk of CKD may be explained by renal calcific arterial\ndisease. Serum phosphorus is associated with CVD risk in\nthe general population [20] and in those with known CVD\n[21]. Evidence suggests that this risk is mediated by phos-\nphorus-induced arteriosclerosis and vascular calcification\n[43], and hyperphosphatemia may directly stimulate arte-\nrial calcification via upregulation of core binding factor a-1\nin vascular smooth muscle cells [44].\nFinally, it is possible that a higher prevalence of subclin-\nical renal disease existed in the highest phosphate group\nthan is indicated by the MDRD eGFR equation. It has\nbeen suggested that as MDRD was originally developed\nin disease-based cohorts, it may perform poorly in healthy\npopulations [45]. Misclassification of mild CKD could po-\ntentially explain both high phosphorus concentration and\nthe higher risk of CKD/ESRD. However, as the MDRD\nequation generally overestimates the prevalence of CKD\nin a general population sample [46], any effect due to mis-\nclassification is likely to be small.\nNotably, when analyzed as a continuous variable, serum\nphosphorus was associated with an increased risk of ESRD\nbut not incident CKD. This may be due to differences in the\ncomposition of the two study samples, such as the inclusion\nof participants with baseline CKD in the NHANES III anal-\nysis or differences in the ethnic composition of the samples,\nwhich is known to influence phosphorus level [47].\nThe finding that serum phosphorus in the upper range of\nnormal is associated with incident kidney disease may have\nimportant public health implications. As serum phosphorus\nlevels !4.0 mg/dL, but within the normal range, are asso-\nciated with both incident CKD and CVD [20, 21], the\ncurrently accepted upper limit of the `normal range' of\n4.5 mg/dL may require revision downwards.\nThere are several strengths to this study, including the\nwell-characterized participants from FHS and NHANES\nIII, the well-defined CVD risk factors and the long duration\nof follow-up. By making use of data from two distinct\nstudies, we were able to extend our observations from in-\ncident CKD to ESRD. Also, there are some important lim-\nitations. Dietary information was not available for\nparticipants in this FHS exam cycle, and we cannot exclude\nits importance as a confounder. A time-to-event analysis\nwould have been preferable in FHS, as was performed in\nNHANES III, but was not possible due to the cyclical\nnature of follow-up in that study and consequent inability\nto time CKD onset. The FHS sample was predominantly of\nEuropean ancestry, which may limit the generalizability\nof these findings. However, we note that NHANES III is\na multi-ethnic nationally representative sample that pro-\nduced comparable results. We used slightly different ana-\nlytic strategies in FHS as compared to NHANES because\nof low numbers of ESRD cases in NHANES and the lack\nof laboratory follow-up. We did not adjust for other un-\nmeasured potential confounders of the associations seen\nincluding FGF-23, parathyroid hormone levels and uri-\nnary biomarkers. Also, laboratory follow-up for identify-\ning incident cases of CKD was not available in NHANES\nIII. As both studies have an observational design, causality\ncannot be inferred. Finally, a survival bias may have ex-\nisted in our analysis, as participants were required to attend\nboth the initial and follow-up examinations, and those\nwith the greatest risk factor burden may have died during\nthe long follow-up.\nIn conclusion, serum phosphorus levels in the high-\nnormal range are associated with a 2-fold higher risk of\ndeveloping new-onset CKD and ESRD in the general\npopulation. Further research is required to investigate the\ncauses of this association between phosphorus homeostasis\nand an increased risk of developing renal disease.\n"
