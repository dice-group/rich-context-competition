Genet Med 2009:\nKey Words: genetic testing, barriers, health disparity, race, ethnicity\nUsing national representative sample data, this article exam-\nines racial and ethnic differences in the following barriers\nto genetic testing: (a) knowledge about genetic testing; (b) type\nof health insurance coverage; (c) concerns about the potential\nmisuse of genetic testing; and (d) lack of trust in a medical\ndoctor to keep their medical information private. It uses a\nnational representative sample and ordered and binary logistic\nregression analyses building on previous works by Singer et al.1,2\nGenetic testing for predisposition of certain diseases is be-\ncoming common because scientific discoveries in the field of\ngenetics and their implementation are enabling people to get\nspeedy diagnosis of disease and treatments that are individually\ntailored with minimum side effects. These predictive genetic\ntests will allow individuals who wish to know information about\ntheir individual disease susceptibilities to take steps to reduce\nthose risks.3\nAccess to expensive genetic tests is likely to further widen\nthe gap between those who already receive the best care and\nthose who do not.4 Racial and ethnic disparities in health\ncontinue to be evident among a range of diseases and health\ncare services. Hence, genetic testing raises a number of issues\npertinent to the provision of health care and the formulation of\npublic policy.5 Genomic revelations propose to define human\nnature and alter the natural history of disease.6 However, cau-\ntion must be taken about these expectations when social deter-\nminants of health are still significant factors globally affecting\nmedicine in the 21st century.\nPersistent inequities in access to health care could be inten-\nsified by advances in genetic knowledge.1,7 From past experi-\nence, those who will benefit most from these advances will\nprobably be those who can afford to do so. Even the Healthy\nPeople 2010 revolves around low-cost solutions to public health\nissues such as increasing women's folic acid intake to prevent\nneural tube defects. But nowhere in this lengthy document does\nit push for access by the general population of women to costly\ngenetic innovations such as genetic screening for breast or\novarian cancer.8 Genetics plays a role in approximately half of\nthe 10 leading health indicators selected as public health issues\nobjectives, only one deals specifically with genetics (newborn\nscreening).\nGenetic research has given us a greater understanding of the\ncontribution of genes to health disparities.10 However, discus-\nsions regarding the implications or applications of genomic\nmedicine have not included the perspectives of racial or ethnic\ngroups.11 The socioecological model provides a useful frame-\nwork for understanding the factors and barriers that influence\nracial and ethnic disparities in the use of genetic testing. An\necological model examines factors and behaviors from a mul-\ntilevel perspective such as intrapersonal (knowledge, attitudes,\nbeliefs), interpersonal (social norms and cultural acceptance),\ninstitutional and community (identification of resources and\nequal access to services), and policy (laws regarding confiden-\ntiality and discrimination).12,13 Each level is manipulated and\nreinforced by factors and behaviors from the other levels of\nFrom an ecological perspective, interactions at all levels can\nprovide opportunities or constraints15 in the utilization of ge-\nnetic testing. For example, previous studies have found that\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics are less likely to know about\nthe availability of genetic testing for disease risk1,16\u00ad18 and\nAfrican Americans are less likely to have confidence in the\npotential benefits of genetic testing than whites.16\u00ad18 Others\nfound African American and Latino populations to be more\nlikely to view genetic testing as interfering with \"God's\nWill.\"19,20 Other cultural issues such as discussing cancer risks\nwith family members may also arise during genetic counseling\nand testing among minority populations.21 Thompson et al.19\nshowed evidence that African American women who declined\nBRCA1/2 counseling believed genetic testing to be just another\nattempt to stigmatize African Americans.\nApprehension about possible privacy breaches, stigmatiza-\ntion, and discrimination may cause physicians and consumers\nalike to avoid genetic-related services and participation in re-\nsearch.4 Historically, in the United States and in Europe, ex-\nplanatory causes of particular diseases or social problems have\nFrom the Institute of Public Health, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceu-\ntical Sciences, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida.\nGebre-Egziabher Kiros, PhD, 209-D FSH Science Research Center, Institute\nof Public Health, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Florida\nA&M University, Tallahassee, FL 32307.

For example, the\neugenics movement in the United States in the early 1900\nproposed solutions to social problems such as poverty by en-\ncouraging fertility among the upper and middle classes and\ndiscouraging childbearing among the lower socioeconomic\ngroups. Another example is the period during which Nazi war\nhomosexuals on the grounds that they were genetically inferi-\nor.11 More recently, the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control\nAct of 1972, which was intended to increase the availability of\nservices for this trait, resulted in insurance and job discrimina-\ntion against individuals carrying this trait.19\nAlthough physicians are deluged with new genetic discover-\nies and ethical dilemmas, many lack the basic knowledge and\nskills necessary to incorporate genetic testing and genetic coun-\nseling into their practice.22,23 Many primary care practitioners\nlack information about genetic services and options available to\npatients.24 Not knowing which choices are available decreases\ntheir confidence to assess, counsel, and refer patients to services\noffered by genetic clinics. Lack of or poor knowledge of clinical\ncancer genetics lessens the chance that a high-risk patient will\nbe referred to a genetic counselor for potential familial cancer\ninheritance.4\nThe characteristics of the primary care physicians of African\nAmerican and non-Hispanic white women may reflect the dif-\nferences in the use of primary prevention genetics such as\nBRCA1/2 counseling.17 Primary care physicians seen by African\nAmericans experience more difficulty delivering specialized\ncare than primary care physicians visited by non-Hispanic\nwhites.25 Additionally, physicians treating black patients are\nless likely to be board certified. Shields et al.26 found that\nminority-serving physicians were less likely to order genetic\ntesting and less likely to refer a patient to a genetic specialist or\ngenetic counselor.\nThe discovery of genetic predisposition to chronic and in-\nherited disease has set up the potential for discrimination in\neverything from who is marriageable to who is insurable. And\nif insurers are allowed to use genetic information in adjusting\npremiums, the burden of paying large if not impossible sums to\nobtain health care coverage will afflict numerous Americans\nwho never thought of this as their problem.27 Patients who are\nemployed in low-paying jobs with little or no health care\nbenefits are more likely to experience barriers to genetic ser-\nvices for financial reasons. African Americans are less likely\nthan non-Hispanic white Americans to have private or employ-\nment-based health insurance and more likely to be covered by\nMedicaid or other publicly funded insurance.5\nHypotheses\nThe purpose of this article is to examine racial and ethnic\ndifferences in barriers to genetic testing: (a) knowledge about\ngenetic testing; (b) type of health insurance coverage; (c) con-\ncerns about the potential misuse of genetic testing; and (d) lack\nof trust in a medical doctor to keep their medical information\nprivate. The study posits the four null hypotheses stated below.\nHypothesis 1: There is no difference in knowledge about\ngenetic testing by race/ethnicity.\nHypothesis 2: There is no variation in concerns about the\nmisuse of genetic testing by race/ethnicity.\nHypothesis 3: There is no difference in the type of health\ninsurance coverage among respondents by race/ethnicity.\nHypothesis 4: There is no difference in lack of trust in\none's physician to keep medical information private by\nrace/ethnicity.\nTo achieve our aims and test the above hypotheses, a national\nrepresentative sample of data collected in the year 2000 by the\nUniversity of Maryland College Park Survey Research Center\nwas used to investigate racial and ethnic disparities in knowl-\nedge and concerns about genetic testing. The specific barriers to\ngenetic testing that are examined include knowledge, health\ninsurance, concerns about misuse of testing, privacy and con-\nfidentiality concerns, and distrust in their medical doctor.\nWe conducted a power analysis for logistic regression with\nseveral predictor variables using the software PASS (Power\nAnalysis and Sample Size) to determine the adequate sample\nsize needed for our study. To achieve a power of 0.90 and\nmedium effect size of 0.5 at a 0.05 significance level corre-\nsponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.50, a sample size between\nassumed. The total sample size for our analysis was 1724 men\nnon-Hispanic whites, 386 Latinos, and 351 blacks. For detailed\ninformation about study design, sample size, and other infor-\nmation see Ref. 1.\nFour dependent variables were analyzed in detail: knowledge\nindex about genetic testing, types of health insurance coverage,\nindex regarding concerns about misuse of genetic testing, and\nmistrust in physicians. Following Singer et al.1 the knowledge\nindex about genetic testing was constructed from seven ques-\ntions (Cronbach's alpha  0.65) by adding the number of\ncorrect answers given by each participant. Respondents who\nanswered six or seven questions right were combined together.\nThe constructed knowledge index variable is an ordinal variable\nand has six categories with a range of one to six. An index about\nrespondent's concerns about misuse of genetic testing was\ncreated from eight questions (Cronbach's alpha  0.71). This\nindex is also an ordinal variable having three categories: 1, 2,\nand 3 where 1 shows the lowest concern and 3 shows the\nhighest concern about the potential misuse of genetic testing.\nThe questions used to create both indices are listed in the Appen-\ndix, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/A1431.\nThe third dependent variable investigated in this study is the\nrespondents' type of health insurance: Medicare, Medicaid,\nprivate insurance, or any insurance (all analyzed separately).\nThe type of health insurance variable had only two categories\n(yes or no). The last dependent variable examined is whether or\nnot the respondent trusts his/her physician to keep medical\ninformation private. The question asks \"How much do you trust\nyour doctor to keep medical information about you private? (1)\na great deal, (2) somewhat, (3) only a little, (4) hardly at all, (8)\nDon't know, (9) Refusal.\" Those who answered (8) and (9)\nwere small and were excluded from the final analysis. This\nvariable is also an ordinal variable. In addition to race/ethnicity,\nthe list of covariates used to predict each dependent variable\noutlined above include age, gender, marital status, education,\nemployment, number of adults in the household, religiosity,\nwhether the respondent knows anyone having a child born with\na genetic defect, and region of residence.\nDescriptive statistics were used to examine distribution of\nresponses; 2 tests were used to assess associations between\nrace/ethnicity and all other predictor variables used in this\nstudy. Ordered logistic regression was applied for the ordinal\ndependent variables: knowledge index, concerns about potential\nmisuse of genetic testing, and lack of trust in a medical doctor.\nBinary logistic regression was used for type of health insurance.\nAll analyses used Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Version\n9.1.3, Cary, NC).

Additionally, McFadden's\npseudo-R2 was used to indicate how useful the predictor vari-\nables were in predicting the dependent variable. Pseudo-R2 in\nlogistic regression is analogous to the coefficient of determina-\ntion (R2) used in linear regression.28,29 However, it does not\nhave the same variance interpretation. Therefore, pseudo-R2\nvalues should not be compared across datasets. Pseudo-R2 val-\nues between 0.2 and 0.4 are considered very satisfactory.29 The\nOR, also a measure of effect size in logistic regression,28 and its\ncorresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), which measures\nthe precision of the OR are also reported.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the percentage distribution of respondents by\nrace/ethnicity and all the predictor variables used in this study.\nIt also presents a 2 statistic together with its corresponding P\nvalue as a measure of association between each predictor vari-\nable and race/ethnicity. More than 70% of the respondents were\n35 years or older. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents were\nfemales and 41% were males. More than half of the respondents\nwere currently married or living with a partner, more than 85%\nhave high school education or more, and about 70% were\nworking either full time or part time. About 64% of respondents\nlive in households where there are at least two adults and 39%\nof respondents attend religious services at least once a week.\nOverall, about 56% of respondents know someone having a\nchild born with a genetic defect (63.5% for non-Hispanic\nassociation between the predictor variables considered in this\nanalysis and race/ethnicity using a 2 analysis show there is a\nsignificant difference at   0.05 level of significance except\nNon-Hispanic white respondents tended to be older than both\nblacks and Latinos and blacks were less likely to be currently\nmarried (30.4%) than non-Hispanic whites (58.7%) and Latinos\n(53.8%). There was also a significant difference in the educa-\ntional level of respondents by race. Latinos (31.3%) had the\nhighest percentage of respondents with less than high school\neducation and non-Hispanic whites (30.9%) had the highest\npercentage of respondents with college degree or higher educa-\ntion. Living arrangement measured by the number of adults in\nthe household also varied considerably by race. Although about\n52% of black respondents live in a household where there are\ntwo or more adults, about 68% of both non-Hispanic whites and\nLatinos live in a household where there are two or more adults.\nThere was a significant variation in respondents' \"attendance of\nreligious services at least once a week\" among non-Hispanic\nwas also substantial variation in knowing someone having a\nchild born with a genetic defect by race/ethnicity. Although 63.5%\nof non-Hispanic whites reported that they know someone having a\nchild born with a genetic defect, only 43.8% of blacks and 48.7%\nof Latinos answered affirmatively for the same question.\nTable 2 presents OR from an ordered logistic regression\nmodel predicting knowledge about genetic testing. The likeli-\npresented model fits the data well. The pseudo-R2 value (0.37)\nindicates that the model is highly satisfactory in predicting\nknowledge about genetic testing. After adjusting for all the\nvariables included in the regression model, there was a strong\nassociation between race/ethnicity and knowledge about genetic\ntesting. Both blacks and Latinos had significantly lower knowl-\nedge compared with non-Hispanic whites. Given that all other\nvariables in the model are held constant, the odds of having\nadequate knowledge among blacks and Latinos compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites was lower by 28% and 52%, respectively.\nMarital status was also significantly associated with respon-\ndent's knowledge about genetic testing. Comparing single ver-\nsus currently married or living with a partner, the odds of higher\nTable 1 Continued\nCharacteristics\nRace/ethnicity\nHow often do you attend religious\nservices?\nKnow anyone having a child born with a\ngenetic defect?\nData source: United States public knowledge and attitudes about genetic testing, 2000 survey.\nGED, general equivalency diploma.\nSuther and Kiros Genetics IN Medicine \u00b7 Volume 11, Number 9, September 2009\nknowledge about genetic testing was 1.63 times greater among\nsingles than among currently married, given that all other vari-\nables in the model remain constant. As one would expect,\neducation also played an important role in knowledge about\ngenetic testing. Although having a less than high school edu-\ncation was negatively associated with knowledge (OR  0.70,\nand college or more than college education (OR  2.13, 95% CI\n1.66\u00ad2.73) was positively associated. Being the only adult in a\nhousehold was negatively associated with high knowledge\nscore. Furthermore, knowing anyone having a child born with a\ngenetic defect significantly increased knowledge score by 29%\n(measured by the frequency of religious services attendance),\nemployment, and region of residence had no significant effect\non knowledge about genetic testing.\nResults of OR obtained from a logistic regression model by\ntypes of health insurance coverage found significant differences\nin the type of health insurance coverage by race/ethnicity.\nCompared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks were more likely to\nless likely to have private insurance (OR  0.55). Latinos were\nless likely to have private insurance (OR  0.49) or no insur-\nance at all (OR  0.60) compared with non-Hispanic whites. As\nexpected (results are not shown), older respondents (aged 65\nand older) were more likely to have Medicare and those 45\nyears old above had higher odds of having a private insurance\ncompared with the 35 to 44 age group. Compared with women,\nmen were more likely to have Medicare and Medicaid. Al-\nthough single and previously married had higher odds of having\nMedicare and Medicaid, they were less likely to have private\ninsurance. Education had also a significant effect on type of\nhealth insurance. On one hand, less than high school education\nwas positively associated with Medicaid, but negatively asso-\nciated with having private health insurance or having any other\ninsurance at all. On the other hand, college education was\nnegatively related with Medicare and Medicaid and positively\nrelated with having a private insurance or any insurance. In\naddition, being unemployed or working part time was positively\nassociated with Medicare and Medicaid, but negatively associ-\nated with having a private insurance or any insurance.\nRespondents were asked the extent they agree or disagree\nwith the single statement \"Information from genetic tests is\nlikely to be misused.\" Although 20% of non-Hispanic whites\nTable 2 Odds ratios from ordered logistic regression\nmodel predicting knowledge about genetic testing\nCharacteristics Knowledge 95% CI\nRace/Ethnicity\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nCurrently married or with partner\n(reference)\nEducation\nHigh school graduate/GED\n(reference)\nEmployment\nNo. adults in the household\nHow often do you attend religious\nservices?\nKnow anyone having a child born\nwith a genetic defect?\n(Continued)\nTable 2 Continued\nCharacteristics Knowledge 95% CI\nRegion\nGED, general equivalency diploma.\nData source: United States public knowledge and attitudes about genetic testing,\nGenetics IN Medicine \u00b7 Volume 11, Number 9, September 2009 Barriers to the use of genetic testing\nagree or strongly agree with the statement, more than one third\nof blacks (34%) and 28% of Latinos agree or strongly agree\nwith the statement. This indicates there is substantial variability\nin concerns about the misuse of results from genetic testing by\nrace/ethnicity with minorities expressing more concern than\nnon-Hispanic whites.\nResults from an ordered logistic regression model predicting\nmore concerns about misuse of genetic testing are presented in\nthe model in predicting respondent's concerns about the misuse\nof genetic testing. The odds of blacks (OR  1.66, 95% CI\nmore concerned about the potential misuse of genetic testing\nversus non-Hispanic whites was higher by 66% and 58%, re-\nspectively. Gender was associated with concerns about the\npotential use of genetic testing. Men were 21% less likely to be\nconcerned about the misuse of genetic testing than women.\nCollege-educated respondents were 37% less likely to be more\nconcerned about the misuse of genetic testing compared with\nthose with a high school degree. Religiosity was also signifi-\ncantly and positively associated with more concerns about the\nmisuse of genetic testing. Age, marital status, employment,\nnumber of adults in the household, knowledge of someone\nhaving a child born with a genetic defect, and region were not\nassociated with concerns about misuse of genetic testing.\nFinally, Table 4 presents results from an ordered logistic\nregression model predicting respondent's lack of trust in their\nmedical doctor in keeping information about them private. The\nthe pseudo-R2 value (0.19) confirmed that the model was sat-\nisfactory in predicting lack of trust in a physician. Again,\ncontrolling for the effects of all the variables in the model, there\nwas a significant difference in lack of trust in a physician by\nrace/ethnicity. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks and\nLatinos were more likely to distrust their medical doctor in\nkeeping their medical information private by 48% and 64%,\nrespectively. In addition, after taking into account the effects of all\nother covariates in the model, the odds of having a higher level of\ndistrust were 1.39 times higher for men than for women. Except for\nrace/ethnicity and gender, all other variables included in the model\nwere not significant in predicting distrust in a medical doctor.\nIn summary, we posited four null hypotheses that stated there\nis no racial/ethnic difference in knowledge about genetic test-\ning, concerns about the potential misuse of genetic testing, type\nTable 3 Odds ratios from ordered logistic regression\nmodel predicting more concerns about the potential\nmisuse of genetic testing\nCharacteristics Mistrust index 95% CI\nRace/Ethnicity\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nCurrently married or with\npartner (reference)\nEducation\nHigh school graduate/GED\n(reference)\nEmployment\nNo. adults in the household\nHow often do you attend\nreligious services?\nKnow anyone having a child\nborn with a genetic defect?\n(Continued)\nTable 3 Continued\nCharacteristics Mistrust index 95% CI\nRegion\nGED, general equivalency diploma.\nData source: United states public knowledge and attitudes about genetic testing,\nSuther and Kiros Genetics IN Medicine \u00b7 Volume 11, Number 9, September 2009\nof health insurance, and mistrust in a medical doctor. The\nresults presented in this study strongly rejected these null hy-\npotheses and provide strong evidence that there are significant\ndifferences in these barriers to genetic testing.\nLimitations\nThe data used in the analyses were based on self-reports and\nsocial desirability response bias could be a potential problem.\nAdditionally, although our findings may reflect true differences\nby race and ethnicity in genetic testing, the significant associ-\nations between race/ethnicity and the predictor variables used in\nthis analysis may create a potential for confounding effects.\nDISCUSSION\nEcological analyses suggest that individuals are influenced\nby circumstances in their day-to-day sociocultural and physical\nenvironments. Racial and ethnic disparities in genetic testing are\nreinforced by factors and behaviors on multiple levels: intrap-\nersonal (knowledge and beliefs), interpersonal (social norms\nand cultural acceptance), institutional (identification of re-\nsources and equal access to services), and policy (laws regard-\ning confidentiality and discrimination).\nBlacks and Latinos are less likely to use genetic testing than\nnon-Hispanic whites because of challenges and barriers they\nface including lack of knowledge or lack of adequate informa-\ntion provided by their physicians about genetic testing. Our\nanalysis points to the need of educating minority populations\nabout genetic testing so they will be able to make informed\ndecisions about their own health and the health of their family\nmembers. Furthermore, education and counseling should be\ntailored to the educational level and socioeconomic status of the\nindividual.30,31 As Hall and Olopade4 so aptly pointed out, the\ntrue power of knowledge is to be familiar with your own genetic\nrisk or family history, which will enable you to ask your\nphysician whether or not you should be tested.\nThere is a significant difference in health insurance coverage\nby race and ethnicity, which in turn may reflect the disparities\nin access to genetic testing. Although blacks are significantly more\nlikely to be covered by Medicaid or Medicare than non-Hispanic\nwhites, they have less private insurance coverage. For Latinos, they\nare less likely to be covered via a private health insurance. For both\nblacks and Latinos, the disparity in private health insurance cov-\nerage means less access to expensive genetic testing.\nTable 4 Odds ratios from ordered logistic regression\nmodel predicting lack of trust in a medical doctor\nCharacteristics Lack of trust 95% CI\nRace/Ethnicity\nAge\nGender\nMarital status\nCurrently married or with partner\n(reference)\nEducation\nHigh school graduate/GED (reference) 1.00 --\nEmployment\nNo. adults in the household\nHow often do you attend religious\nservices?\nKnow anyone having a child born with a\ngenetic defect?\n(Continued)\nTable 4 Continued\nCharacteristics Lack of trust 95% CI\nRegion\nGED, general equivalency diploma.\nData Source: United States Public Knowledge and Attitudes about Genetic Test-\nGenetics IN Medicine \u00b7 Volume 11, Number 9, September 2009 Barriers to the use of genetic testing\nDistrust in the medical system has been determined to be\nhigher among African Americans than non-Hispanic whites and\nmay serve as a barrier to health care.19,32,33 Given the racial\nfocus of the eugenics movement in the past, and historical\nexperiences like the Tuskegee experiment, racial differences in\nattitudes about genetic testing in the general population are\nparticularly important.16 Health care professionals who identify\nand address these cultural issues may increase the number of\nhigh-risk minorities who inquire about genetic counseling and\nare referred for risk-appropriate genetic services.34,35 In addi-\ntion, information campaigns about the benefits of genetic testing\nthat focus on minorities and promoting minority participation in\ngenetic research are of paramount importance. Advancing the\nrole that racial and ethnic minorities play in shaping and en-\nhancing genetic research will further encourage the develop-\nment of critical policies that address the ethical, social, and legal\naspects of genomic medicine.\nREFERENCES\n1.
