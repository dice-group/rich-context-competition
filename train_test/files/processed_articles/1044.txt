This study assesses implications of changes in coresidence with adult children for parents' marital relations,\nhypothesizing that transitions into coresidence lower marital quality and transitions out of coresidence increase marital\nquality.\nMethods. Panel data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households are used to analyze\nwhether change in three measures of marital quality--time together, happiness, and disagreements--is related to adult\nchild coresidence.\nResults. When adult children move out, parent couples increase their time together; there is a tendency for reduced\ntime together when the nest ``refills.'' However, there are no effects of moves in or out on the marital happiness of parents\nor the number of marital disagreements they have. There is also no effect on time together or on marital quality when one\nadult child moves out but another moves in during the same period. The presence of younger children has more consistent\nassociations with marital quality.\nDiscussion. Coresidence with adult children does not appear to be an experience that disrupts the quality of marital\nrelations. It may be that qualitative dimensions of coresidence experiences with adult children matter more than\ncoresidence per se.\nPARENTHOOD is stressful, particularly when children are\nyoung, and particularly for women. Research has shown\nthat the transition to parenthood leads to lower psychological\nwell-being and marital quality (Belsky & Kelly, 1994;\nMcLanahan & Adams, 1987), with a rise in marital happiness\nafter the nest empties (Van Laningham, Johnson, & Amato,\nwhat circumstances, do the effects of parenthood continue when\nchildren move into adulthood?\nRelations with adult children later in life have inconsistent\neffects on well-being (Ward & Spitze, 1998), reflecting a mix of\npositive and negative dimensions of such ties (Luescher &\nPillemer, 1998). Children's problems, however, can be a source\nof distress for parents (Pillemer & Suitor, 1991), as are the\ncommon disagreements and conflicts in parent\u00adadult child rela-\ntions (Clark, Preston, Raskin, & Bengtson, 1999; Umberson,\n1992). Thus, adult children continue to affect parents, but those\neffects appear to be weaker than those for young children.\nWhat about circumstances in which adult children live\n(coreside) with parents? One would expect differences between\nhaving young children at home and having coresident adult\nchildren. The latter, although still receiving some assistance\nfrom parents (Spitze & Ward, 1995; Ward, Logan, & Spitze,\n1992), require much less care and attention than young chil-\ndren. They may also be positively selected, as those who stay\nor return to the nest may get along well with parents and help\nSpitze, 1992). However, coresidence with parents in adult-\nhood may imply failure to attain adult status or a crisis such as\nunemployment, and thus it may create parental stress. Further,\ncoresidence intensifies the nature and effects of parent\u00adchild\nrelations, as interaction and exchange are heightened (Rossi &\nOur research focuses on the implications of adult child co-\nresidence for parents' marital relations in midlife. Longitudinal\ndata allow us to assess change in parents' time together and\nmarital quality in response to moves into and out of the nest by\nadult children. Prior research has addressed needs and circum-\nstances that lead to adult child coresidence and the nature of\nparent\u00adchild relations in such households. We begin with an\noverview of those patterns and then discuss how adult child co-\nresidence may affect parents' marital quality.\nPatterns and Consequences of Coresidence\nCoresidence by adult children and parents is not uncommon.\nApproximately 30% of parents from their 40s to their 60s co-\nreside with an adult child, and approximately 15% of parents\na parent (Ward et al., 1992). Indeed, adult child coresidence\nhas increased recently, as children are leaving later and are\nmore likely to return to the nest (Goldscheider, Goldscheider,\nprimarily tend to reflect children's needs and circumstances,\nwith adult children using the parental nest as a safety net or home\nalternative scenario of coresidence by frail elderly parents and\ncaregivingchildrenrepresentsasmallproportion,evenofcoresid-\ning older parents and adult children (Aquilino, 1990; Ward et al.,\nResearch on the quality of relations between parents and\ncoresident adult children and the effects of coresidence on\nwell-being has relied mostly on cross-sectional data, yielding\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\na positive but incomplete picture. Coresident parents and\nadult children generally report satisfaction with coresidence\nand positive relations (Suitor & Pillemer, 1988; Ward & Spitze,\nparental well-being is more mixed. Umberson and Gove (1989)\nreported that both mothers and fathers with coresident children\n(of any age) have lower well-being, but Menaghan (1983)\nfound no significant effect of the presence of coresident\nchildren over the age of 22 on parents' well-being. Using panel\ndata, White and Edwards (1990) found that nestleaving in-\ncreases parental life satisfaction if there is continued contact\nwith the child. More generally, parents' distress has been found\nto be increased by adult children's problems, with no significant\ndifference by whether the child coresides or not (Pillemer &\nEffects of Children on Parents' Marriages\nAlthough much is known about how children influence their\nparents' well-being, less research has focused on parents'\nmarriages. Further, that research has tended to focus on minor\nrather than adult children. It has been grounded mainly in two\ntheoretical traditions. First, on the basis of exchange theory\nand the derived assumption that spouses receive benefits and\nexperience costs of marital relations (Suitor & Pillemer, 1987),\nit has been suggested that the presence of children modifies\nthe balance between costs and benefits, at least temporarily\n(Bradbury, Fincham, & Bench, 2000). Parents experience\ngreater financial stress (White, Booth, & Edwards, 1986), have\nless time alone together, and tend toward more gender-\nstereotyped roles (Walzer, 1998). The latter is seen as pushing\nwomen into more household services and men into greater\nbreadwinning responsibility than they might prefer (Umberson\nSecond, researchers have discussed the impact of children\non parents' well-being and marital quality from a role theory\n& Edwards, 1990). Children potentially increase role strain or\nrole overload because the heavy demands of caring for them are\nlikely to conflict with other roles or create an overwhelming\ntotal burden. This is likely to be true more for mothers, who\ntend to bear more of the child-care burden. The empty nest can\nalso be viewed in terms of role change or loss.\nThe presence of adult children may have some of the con-\nsequences suggested by these theoretical perspectives, but to a\nlesser degree. Adult children may contribute to family finances\nor at least support their own living expenses. They may con-\ntribute to household labor, although perhaps also adding to the\ntotal workload, particularly to the mother's share (South &\ntime alone but, again, not to the extent that a younger child\nAdult children's presence, and particularly their return, may\nalso have particular consequences that are distinctive from\nthose of younger children. Adult child coresidence may disrupt\nthe normative empty nest of midlife marriages. Continuing\ncoresidence by older children may violate parental expectations\nand generate conflict. Umberson and Gove (1989) suggested\nthat ``the benefits of parenting later in the life course partly\ndepend on one's children achieving and maintaining indepen-\ndence from parents'' (p. 455). Concerns about children's\nsuccess may influence the perceived success of the marriage\nand benefits derived from it. Transitions, as when children\nreturn to the nest, can also disrupt routines and relationships.\nRole theory suggests that any role change, including role loss,\ncan have negative consequences (White & Edwards, 1990), and\nthe empty nest is a vulnerable time in marriages (Heidemann,\nThere is limited but mixed evidence on how parents' marital\nquality relates to adult child coresidence. Some findings are\nbased on cross-sectional data. For example, Suitor and Pillemer\n(1987) reported no effect of adult child coresidence on marital\nquality for parents over the age of 65, suggesting that any ef-\nfects may apply more to coresidence with young adult chil-\ndren. However, they do find an association between the quality\nof the parent\u00adchild relations with coresident adult children\nand parents' marital conflict. Ward and Spitze (1998) found that\nintergenerational exchanges between ``sandwiched'' parents in\nmidlife and their adult children had little association with\nparents' marital quality, as generally high satisfaction in midlife\nmarriages was sustained despite occasional intergenerational\nburdens.\nSome studies have used longitudinal data to examine\nchanges in marital quality with the transition to an empty nest.\nWhite and Edwards (1990) found that marital happiness in-\ncreased after the nest emptied, particularly when the last child\nto leave was younger (indicating recency of launch and perhaps\nthe relief from the launch of a teenager rather than an older\nchild). Menaghan (1983) found increased feelings of marital\nequity, though there was no parallel effect on affection or ful-\nfillment. Van Laningham and colleagues (2001) indicated that\nemptying the nest slows down an otherwise steeper decline in\nmarital happiness over time.\nThus, research on changes in coresidence has produced\nmixed results on the effects of coresident adult children on\nparents' marriages. These studies have tended to focus on the\ninitial period of nestleaving by very young adults, with less\nattention to transitions by older adult children; no study has\nexplicitly examined the effect of a return to coresidence on\nparents' marital happiness. Research has also focused on sub-\njective dimensions of marital quality, with no attention to more\nobjective and behavioral indicators, such as time together.\nAims and Hypotheses\nOur research investigates the effects of transitions in and out\nof adult child coresidence on parents' time together and two\ndimensions of their marital quality. Possible selectivity in the\ncharacteristics of parents and children who coreside compli-\ncates efforts to assess the effects of coresidence (Aquilino,\nrelated to family structure, history, and, in particular, factors\nassociated with the quality of parent\u00adchild relations that may\npartly account for the apparent outcomes of coresidence.\nIn their analysis of panel data, however, White and Rogers\n(1997) concluded that there is no evidence of selection into\ncoresidence of parents and adult children with particularly\nharmonious relations.\nThe theoretical perspectives we reviewed imply negative\nconsequences of adult child coresidence for parents' marriages.\nExchanges are likely on balance to favor the adult child rather\nthan the parent, and the resulting imbalance could affect marital\nquality. Similarly, although the ``role loss'' implied by an\nemptied nest may be stressful for parents and their marriage, the\nrole perspective also predicts negative consequences from role\nstrain or overload that may result from adult child coresidence.\nThus, although we do not view our analysis as explicitly test-\ning the applicability of either theory, we hypothesize positive\nconsequences of transitions out of coresidence and negative\nconsequences of transitions back into living with adult children;\nthe implications of stable coresidence over time are less clear.\nFirst, we hypothesize that transitions out of coresidence with\nan adult child will increase parents' time together, whereas\nhaving an adult child move back into an emptied nest will have\nthe opposite effect. As indicated earlier, the presence of young\nchildren in a household is likely to mean that parents have less\ntime for each other, as well as increasingly differentiated roles\n(Walzer, 1998). Although coresidence with an adult child may\nhave different and smaller effects, it is nonetheless likely to\nreduce parents' time alone with each other (Heidemann et al.,\nSecond, we hypothesize that transitions out of coresidence\nwith an adult child will increase parents' marital happiness and\nreduce disagreements, whereas a refilled nest will have opposite\nconsequences. Although problems that may lead to a particular\nchild's coresidence are likely to influence parents' well-being\n(Pillemer & Suitor, 1991), the processes we are focusing on\nin this article relate more generally to the presence of any\nadult child. However, we also compare the consequences of\ncontinued coresidence with the same adult child with those\nof living at a later point with a different adult child. We also\nexamine the effects of continued coresidence with the same or\ndifferent adult child, in comparison with those of emptying or\nrefilling the nest.\nThird, although there is only weak evidence of gender dif-\nferences in coresidence experiences, it can be hypothesized that\neffects of coresidence may be greater for women because of\ngender-based differences in the nature and impact of family\nroles and relations. Mothers are likely to be providing more\nhousehold services to children, and, although these may de-\ncrease with the child's age, a gap between mothers and fathers\nMenaghan (1983) found effects of the empty nest on feelings\nof marital equity, and, although she did not report gender dif-\nferences, it seems likely that such concerns would be more\nsalient for wives, given related past research (e.g., Robinson &\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are from the first and second waves of the National Sur-\nrepresenting the noninstitutionalized U.S. population, with over-\nsampling of several demographic groups (including Blacks and\nHispanics) and household types; 77% of primary respondents\nwere resurveyed (personal interviews and self-administered\nquestionnaires) at Wave 2.\nOur analyses use a subsample at Wave 2 who had an adult\nchild (aged 19\u00fe) at Wave 1, were married to the same person at\nboth waves, were householders (the owner or renter, to focus on\nthe typical form of coresidence in which adult children live in\ntheir parents' household), and had data for all variables used\nin the analyses (as described in the paragraphs that follow).\nThis yielded a sample of 1,365 persons, with the following\ncharacteristics: 43% men, 85% non-Hispanic White, and mean\nRegarding coresidence with adult children, 28% of respond-\nents (n \u00bc 384) coresided with an adult child at Wave 1; this\nbut not at Wave 2, 109 (8%) did not coreside at Wave 1 but did\nat Wave 2, and 872 (64%) did not coreside with an adult child\nat either wave. A substantial majority of coresident households\n(76\u00ad80%) had only one coresident adult child. In addition, 12%\nof respondents had a child younger than 19 in the household,\nanother 6% had a grandchild in the household, and 92% had an\nadult child living outside of the household.\nVariables\nMarital quality. --The dependent variables reflect three\naspects of marital quality measured at both waves: time spent\nwith each other, marital happiness, and marital disagreements.\nTime together is self-reported and therefore has subjective\nelements, but it refers to a more objective aspect of the rela-\ntionship; we view happiness and disagreements as more sub-\njective indicators of marital quality. To assess time together,\nrespondents were asked, ``During the past month, about how\noften did you and your husband or wife spend time alone with\neach other, talking, or sharing an activity?'' (from 1 \u00bc never to\n6 \u00bc almost every day). Respondents assessed overall marital\nhappiness with a standard item: ``Taking all things together,\nhow would you describe your marriage (T1)/relationship\n(T2)?'' (from 1 \u00bc very unhappy to 7 \u00bc very happy). Frequency\nof disagreements (from 1\u00bcnever to 6\u00bcalmost every day) were\nreported in six areas--household tasks, money, time spent\ntogether, sex, in-laws, and children--combined into a scale\n(range \u00bc 6\u00ad36, alpha \u00bc .76). For missing cases to be reduced,\nmissing items for the scale were recoded to the item mean for\nrespondents with missing data for only one or two of the six\nitems. Because of skewness in distributions of the measures of\nmarital quality, extreme scores were recoded to truncate the\ntails; comparisons with analyses using the original coding and\nwith analyses using log transformations indicated that empirical\npatterns are similar across these options. We use the three\nmeasures to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the\nquality of marital relations that reflects both positive and nega-\ntive dimensions of marital relations, as well as both objective\nand subjective elements (Johnson, White, Edwards, & Booth,\n1986). The quality of these midlife marriages was generally\nquite positive (see Table 1).\nCoresidence. --We focus on patterns of stability or change in\ncoresidence between parents and adult children. Coresidence\nstatus entails four possibilities: coresidence at both waves (with\nthe same or different children), coresidence at Wave 1 but not at\nWave 2, coresidence at Wave 2 but not at Wave 1, and not\ncoresiding at either wave. To more clearly assess patterns of\nchange in coresident situations, our analysis divides the sample\ninto two subgroups: first, parents coresiding with an adult child\nat Wave 1, to compare those who coreside with the same adult\nchild at Wave 2 (n \u00bc 91), coreside with a different adult child at\nWave 2 (50), and do not coreside with any adult child at Wave\n2 (243); and second, parents not coresiding with an adult child\nat Wave 1, to compare those who still do not coreside (872)\nwith those who do coreside at Wave 2 (109). In combination,\nthese comparisons capture the diverse patterns of stability and\ntransitions in or out of coresidence with an adult child between\nthe two waves.\nFor the most part, these situations extend past the traditional\nnestleaving by very young adult children, but they also reflect\na variety of ages. Coresident adult children at Wave 1 had\nwas 28.9 if the same adult child coresided at both waves, but it\nwas only 22.8 if a different adult child was coresident at Wave\n2. The latter appear to be primarily younger children replacing\nor remaining as their older siblings leave. Among parents\nwhose households refilled (i.e., who did not coreside with an\nadult child at Wave 1 but did at Wave 2), the mean age of the\ncoresident adult child at Wave 2 was 25.8, reflecting a mix of\nyounger children aging into adulthood (40% of these coresident\nadult children had been adolescents living with their parents\nat Wave 1) and older adult children returning to the nest. In\ncombination, these patterns allow us to look at a more diverse\nset of coresident households than in previous research: different\ntransitions in and out, as well as stable coresidence by an adult\nchild over approximately 5 years.\nControl variables. --Analyses included control variables\nlikely to be related to marital quality: age, gender, and race\nor ethnicity (dummy variables for Blacks and for Hispanics);\neducation (as an indicator of socioeconomic status); and self-\nrated health (from 1 \u00bc very poor to 5 \u00bc excellent). Missing data\nfor health were recoded to the mean to conserve sample size.\nWe also included characteristics of coresident children: age,\ngender (presence of a son), and family status (whether the\nhousehold included a child or partner of the coresident adult\nchild; of the 250 households with a coresident child, only 10\nincluded that child's partner and only 35 included a child).\nPresence in the household of a young child (younger than 19)\nof the respondent (parent) was also included.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe hypothesized that coresidence with an adult child would\nnegatively affect the quality of parents' marital relations, both\nin terms of time together and marital happiness and disagree-\nments. More specifically, transitions into coresidence would be\nrelated to lower marital quality, whereas transitions out would\nhave opposite associations. It is less clear whether continuing\ncoresidence, or a distinction between same versus different\ncoresident adult child, would be related to change in marital\npatterns.\nTo address these issues, we focus on change in two respects.\nFirst, measures of the dependent variables at Wave 1 are\ncontrolled in regression analyses to focus on change in marital\nquality between Waves 1 and 2. Analyses using change scores\nfor the dependent variables yielded equivalent results for the\ncoresidence variables. Second, we divide the sample according\nto coresidence or noncoresidence with an adult child at Wave 1,\nusing dummy variables to reflect stability or change in co-\nresidence arrangements at Wave 2. For those coresiding with\nan adult child at Wave 1, coresidence with the same child at\nWave 2 is the omitted category for comparison with coresi-\ndence with a different adult child and coresidence with no adult\nchild. For those not coresiding with an adult child at Wave 1,\nnot coresiding at Wave 2 is the omitted category for comparison\nwith having an adult child move into coresidence at Wave 2.\nWe also hypothesized that coresidence with an adult child\nwould be more strongly related to marital quality for women\nthan men. Following the guidelines of Jaccard, Turrisi, and\nWan (1990), we assessed this by testing the statistical\nsignificance of change in R2 when multiplicative interaction\nterms for gender with coresidence status were added to the\nregression analyses.\nTable 1 summarizes descriptive data for variables for the\ntotal sample and by gender. Patterns of adult child coresidence\nand characteristics of coresident children do not differ for men\nand women. Women report slightly lower marital happiness,\nTable 1.

Looking first at patterns of coresidence with adult\nchildren, we find that increased time together as a couple is\nassociated with having a coresident adult child leave (and there\nis no statistically significant difference between continuing\ncoresidence with same vs. different adult child). In addition,\ndecreased time together is related to having an adult child move\ninto the household, though this association is marginal ( p ,\n.10). These patterns support our first hypothesis. However, co-\nresidence status is not related to changes in either marital happi-\nness or disagreements. In particular, neither a transition out of\ncoresidence with an adult child nor a transition into coresidence\nis related to these indicators of marital quality. There is also\nno difference between coresiding with the same adult child\nor a different adult child. Thus, our second hypothesis is not\nsupported.\nGender exhibits little association with the measures of mari-\ntal quality. In particular, none of the gender interaction terms\nadd significantly to the variance explained, indicating that,\ncontrary to our third hypothesis, implications of coresidence\nwith adult children do not differ for men and women. How-\never, among parents coresiding with an adult child at Wave 1,\nwomen compared with men exhibit a decrease in marital happi-\nness and an increase in marital disagreements (though the latter\nis marginal, p , .10); in contrast, women compared with men\nexhibit decreased marital disagreements among parents who\ndid not coreside with an adult child at Wave 1. These patterns\nsuggest that coresidence may be more problematic for women,\nbut the associations are relatively weak and, as we noted,\nthere are no significant gender interactions in the associations\nbetween marital quality and coresidence transitions.\nAlthough the control variables are not the focus here, we\ncan note some variations related to age, race or ethnicity,\nand health. Older respondent age tends to be associated with\nincreases in time together and marital happiness, and with\ndecreased marital disagreements. Better health also tends to be\nassociated with increases in reported marital quality. Black\nrespondents exhibit decreased time together and increased\ndisagreements. The presence of a young child (younger than\n19) in the household tends to be associated with reduced time\ntogether, lower marital happiness, and more frequent marital\ndisagreements. However, the association between presence of\na young child and marital happiness and disagreements is\nsignificant only for those without a coresident adult child at\nWave 1. This suggests that the presence of an adult child may\nreduce the effects of a young child. The characteristics of\ncoresident adult children are generally unrelated to marital\nquality, except that increased time together is associated with\nolder child age (if coresident at Wave 1) and presence of a child\nor partner.\nDISCUSSION\nWe began this article by noting that the burdens of parent-\nhood have received particular attention for parents of young\nchildren; we asked whether those burdens continue to be evident\nafter children move into adulthood. Coresidence by parents\nand adult children offers an opportunity to look at this question;\nif there are effects, they might be expected to be particularly\nevident in such circumstances, paralleling the usual situation\nfor parents of younger children.\nPanel data were used to assess the implications of co-\nresidence with adult children, in particular transitions into and\nout of coresidence, for changes in marital quality. We were able\nto assess diverse circumstances of coresidence with adult\nchildren, moving beyond nestleaving by very young adult\nchildren to include coresidence stability and transitions by older\nadult children. On the basis of arguments derived from ex-\nchange theory and role theory, we hypothesized that coresi-\ndence with adult children would negatively affect both more\nobjective and more subjective dimensions of marital quality,\nreducing parents' time together and leading to lower marital\nhappiness and more frequent disagreements. We also expected\nstronger effects for mothers than fathers, on the basis of earlier\nliterature that found such gender differences for younger chil-\ndren and because we expected mothers to provide more house-\nhold services to coresident children than do fathers.\nWe find evidence in favor of only our first hypothesis.\nChanges in adult child coresidence do appear to affect parents'\nTable 2.

Transitions out of coresidence are\nrelated to increased time together, though transitions into co-\nresidence are only marginally related to less time. Thus, this\nimportant aspect of marital interaction appears to be elastic with\nrespect to the presence of coresident adult children, as could\nbe expected when there is another member of the household.\nBut what does this mean about the reported quality of those\nmarriages?\nIn contrast to these effects on time together, we find that\ncoresidence transitions are unrelated to marital happiness and\ndisagreements. Thus, although these middle-aged and older\nparents' marriages are affected in the more objective sense of\ntime together, the more subjective assessments of their mar-\nriages do not change. It would appear, thus, that any effects\non these parents' psychological well-being that can be traced\nto emptying or refilling the nest do not extend to the quality\nof the marriage itself. This may be due to the long durations\nof most of the marriages represented here; perhaps they are\nless vulnerable than the shorter term marriages that are generally\nfound to be affected by the addition or presence of young\nchildren. It may mean that any effects of coresidence attribut-\nable to changed exchange relations or modifications in the mix\nof roles are modest enough not to extend to marital quality.\nMore specifically, it appears that the implications of an adult\nchild in the household are less pronounced than those of a\nyounger child. There is little evidence here or in other research\nthat parental and spousal roles affect each other through\nrole conflict or strain after children have reached adulthood.\nParenting a young child is a more encompassing role, whereas\nthe parental role has less depth or breadth with adult children.\nWe also expected that wives or mothers would be affected\nmore than fathers by coresidence with an adult child, but this\nhypothesis is not supported by our analyses. We did find some\nmain effects of gender, but these differences were small, and\nthe overall patterns for men and women are very similar. It is\nimportant that there are no interactions between gender and\nchanges in coresidence status in our equations for marital\nquality. Gender differences in parent\u00adadult child relations have\nbeen assumed to be significant, with a special focus on the\nmother\u00addaughter relation (e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990), but other\nrecent analyses have found fewer differences than expected (e.g.,\nLogan & Spitze, 1996; Umberson, Chen, House, Hopkins,\n& Slaten, 1996). The similarity in adult child coresidence\nexperiences for men and women may reflect similar family\ncircumstances for middle-aged mothers or fathers and young\nadult daughters or sons who are in coresident households\neven if there are some differences in parent\u00adchild relations in\ncoresident households, they do not appear to extend to the ex-\nperience of marital relations for either women or men.\nAs a unique addition to earlier literature on marital quality,\nwe examined not only potential changes leading to an empty\nnest but also the effects of a return to the nest by adult children.\nHowever, despite our expectation that returns to the nest might\nsignal adult children's problems that would affect parents'\nevaluation of the success of their marriage, as well as disrupt\nmarital roles and routines, we found no effects of return co-\nresidence beyond a marginal decrease in parents' time together.\nNeither transitions into nor out of coresidence are associated\nwith marital happiness and disagreements.\nSimilarly, we had wondered whether it mattered more\n``which'' adult child leaves or returns, rather than ``whether''\nthat occurs. We separated out the effects of the same child\nremaining or a different child entering the nest. We found no\ndifference between these two situations. In addition, the charac-\nteristics of coresident children that we were able to incorporate\ninto these analyses exhibited little association with marital\nquality. However, these are admittedly limited tests of this ques-\ntion. Umberson (1989) concluded, as have other researchers\nwho focus on the effects of role incumbencies, that the context\nis crucial, and that parenting can be a source of both benefits\nand stress, depending on other factors. For coresidence such\nfactors may include the reasons for coresidence, presumably\nreflecting problems in the child's life, the adult child's charac-\nteristics, and the quality of both past and present parent\u00adchild\nrelations. It seems likely that, under some circumstances, returns\nby ``problem'' children would indeed be a strain on marriages\nor lead to more disagreements. However, this situation may\nbe rarer than the more routine returns, which have a mix of\nmildly positive and negative consequences. Although we could\nnot address this directly in the context of these analyses, we\nwould argue that this is a promising avenue for further research.\nConsistent with other research (e.g., that by Van Laningham\net al., 2001), we find that the presence of younger (minor)\nchildren has more consistent associations with the quality of\nparents' marital relations than the presence of adult children. As\nwe have noted, younger children in the household likely entail\nmore intensive and day-to-day parenting, with greater parental\neffort and deflection from the spousal role. Our analyses also\nsuggest, however, an intriguing interaction between the pres-\nence of younger and older children: We find that the presence\nof a coresident adult child may buffer the effects of a young\nchild on marital quality, perhaps because the adult child\nassists the parents in various ways (e.g., babysitting).\nAn alternative explanation of the null effects for adult child\ncoresidence and marital quality is that coresidence is selective\nof those with positive relationships. We noted earlier, however,\nthat White and Rogers (1997) found that parents and adult\nchildren who coreside are not characterized by more positive\nprior parent\u00adchild relations. This is supported by other analyses\nusing a different subset of the data used here, a subset that\nenabled a focus on family relations over time with particular\nchildren as they moved from adolescence into young adulthood\n(Ward & Spitze, 2002). Those analyses found that the quality of\nfamily relations during adolescence does not predict whether\nchildren subsequently coreside when they reach young adult-\nhood.\nThus, we would argue instead that coresidence and its\nimplications should be understood within the broader context\nof parent\u00adchild relations. Parents and adult children exhibit\nstrong intergenerational ties along a number of dimensions of\nsolidarity, including contact and proximity, affection, feelings\nof normative obligation, and exchanges of support (Logan &\nsistance between parents and adult children, and especially\nfrom parents to adult children, are commonplace and expected.\nThough only a minority of parents actively assist their adult\nchildren at any particular time, and an even smaller minority\ncoreside, helping children is an expected part of the parental\nrole. These normal, and normative, intergenerational exchanges\nappear to be managed by parents with generally little effect on\nparent marital quality (Ward & Spitze, 1998). This extends to\ncoresidence, which most commonly occurs when children are\nin young adulthood, a period when support from parents to\nchildren is relatively high (Logan & Spitze, 1996). Rather than\nviewing coresidence by adult children as ``counternormative''\nand disruptive of the lives and relationships of parents, it can be\nseen as a dimension of family solidarity and expected parent\u00ad\nchild exchange patterns.\n"
