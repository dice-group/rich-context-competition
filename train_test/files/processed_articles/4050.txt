We have observed that some patients develop one or\nmore of the diabetes-induced complications despite the short\nduration of their disease whereas others may have had the dis-\nease for 10 or more years without any of these complications.2\nThese initial observations prompted us to investigate whether\ngenetic risk factors may play a role in the development of\nT2DM or subsequently acquiring any related complications.\nBoth of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and meth-\nylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) enzymes have\nbeen previously suggested as potential candidate genes for the\npathogenesis of T2DM and its complications in addition to the\ndevelopment of cardiovascular diseases.3\u00ad6\nGenetic combination of angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme with methylene\ntetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms\nand the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus\nin Bahrain\nEinas M Al-Harbi1, Eman M Farid2, Khalid A Gumaa2, Abdulla H\nDarwish3, Mohammad Alenizi4 and Jaipaul Singh5\n Keywords\nBahrain, type 2 diabetes mellitus, angiotensin-converting enzyme, methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase, polymorphism\nMolecular Genetics Laboratory, Kuwait Medical Genetic Center, State\nof Kuwait\nCollege of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Arabian Gulf University,\nKingdom of Bahrain\nDepartment of Pathology, Bahrain Defense Force Royal Medical\nServices Hospital, Kingdom of Bahrain\nGeneral Department of Criminal Evidences, Ministry of Interior,\nFarwaneyia, State of Kuwait\nSchool of Forensic and Investigative Sciences, University of Central\nLancashire, UK\nCorresponding author:\nEinas M Al-Harbi, Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Kuwait Medical\nGenetics Center, Ministry of Health, Sulaibikat, 80901, Kuwait.\nEmail: alharbi_em@yahoo.com\nOriginal Article\nThe insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE\ngene was the first candidate gene of the renin\u00adangiotensin\nsystem (RAS) for a predisposition to diabetic nephropathy.7\nThe gene was discovered and described in 1990 by Rigat et\nal.8 and was shown to account for about half of the pheno-\ntypic variance of serum ACE concentrations in the normal\npopulation.8 The human ACE gene is located on the long\n25 introns. The polymorphism is characterized by the pres-\nence (insertion) or absence (deletion) of a 287-bp Alu1 ele-\nment inside intron 16 of the ACE gene, producing three\ngenotypes (DD, II and ID heterozygote).8,9 The highest\nserum ACE activity was seen in the DD genotype while the\nlowest was seen in the II genotype.8 In addition to its role in\na predisposition to diabetic nephropathy, the ACE polymor-\nphism has been suggested as associated with such diabetic\nhypertension.14,15 Earlier studies have also demonstrated an\nethnic variation in the frequency of I/D polymorphism in\nFrosst et al.18 identified a C-to-T substitution at nucleo-\ntide 677 that converts an alanine to a valine residue which\nis responsible for the synthesis of a thermo-labile form of\nMTHFR, a key enzyme in homocysteine metabolism.\nIndividuals with homozygosity for the T allele are predis-\nposed to the development of hyperhomocysteinemia, espe-\ncially with a low level of plasma folate.19 However, the\nrelationship between MTHFR polymorphisms and hyper-\nhomocysteinemia has not been well established yet,\nalthough C677T polymorphisms of MTHFR variants have\nbeen implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular dis-\neases including hypertension.18\nThe association of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism\nshowed that the frequencies of D allele and DD genotypes\nwere high among the general Bahraini population.20\nMoreover, there is a strong association of D allele and DD\ngenotypes with the high prevalence of T2DM,2 these initial\nobservations are in total agreement with most reports from\nother populations, yet not shown to be a risk factor for the\ndevelopment of T2DM.2 Meanwhile, the relationship\nbetween the disease progression in Bahraini T2DM popula-\ntion and the genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677T is\nstill under investigation.\nTherefore, the aim of the current study was to test the distri-\nbution of MTHFR C677Tgene polymorphism among Bahraini\nT2DM patients and to examine the interaction between ACE\nI/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms on the risk of devel-\nopment of T2DM and its long-term complications.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nThis case-control association study recruited a total of 171\nunrelated adults amongst Bahraini T2DM patients and 188\nage-matched, healthy control non-diabetic Bahraini adults.\nThe project had the relevant ethnical clearance from the\nEthics Committee of Arabian Gulf University and other\nrelated institutions to undertake the study.\nDNA extraction\nVenous blood was collected by venipuncture both from\novernight fasting T2DM patients and healthy controls in\nvacutainer tubes with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid\n(EDTA) as anticoagulant. Peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells were used as a source of genomic DNA. Extraction of\nDNA was accomplished according to the protocol of the\nQIAamp DNA Blood Mini Spin Column (QiageGmbH,\nACE I/D polymorphism genotyping\nGenotyping was performed on extracted DNA by the\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of oligonucleo-\nMarkham, Canada). The reactions were performed with 5\npmol of each primer in combination with Taq PCR Master\nMix (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). PCR was used to\ndetect two alleles of the 190 bp deletion (D allele) and 490 bp\ninsertion (I allele) fragments. DNA was amplified using\nprimer and PCR cycling conditions as described earlier.21\nEach sample that had the DD genotype was re-amplified with\nan insertion-specific primer pair, which recognized an inser-\ntion-specific sequence.22,23 The PCR products was analyzed\non 2% agarose gels after staining with TMVistra Green.\nThe single point mutation in the gene that codes for MTHFR\nC677T had been analyzed by PCR\u00adrestriction fragment\nlength polymorphism (RFLP) assay as described by Frosst\net al.18 The regions containing the 677 base of MTHFR\nwere amplified by PCR using a sense primer\nantisenseprimer(5-AGGACGGTGCGGTGAGAGTC-3).\nThe presence or absence of mutation depended on the\nrestriction enzymes to recognize the restriction sequence\nand then cut it into two bands which were analyzed on 2%\nagarose gels after staining with TMVistra Green.\nStatistical analysis\nThe distribution of allele and genotype frequencies between\npatients and controls was determined by allele counting and\nthe statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version\n20 statistical package for Windows, which also computed\nthe p value, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval\n(CI).

In contrast, MTHFR C677T gene polymor-\nphism was negatively associated with T2DM. In addition,\nthe data for gene combination with the ACE I/D polymor-\nphism did not show any significant correlations with the\ndevelopment of T2DM among Bahraini patients.\nThe Bahraini population is an Arabian Peninsula popula-\ntion. The characteristics of Arabic populations make them\nideal for the study of complex, polygenic, multifactorial disor-\nders such as T2DM. The Arabic populations are characterized\nby genetic homogeneity due to the tribal structure of their soci-\nety, large family size and extensive consanguinity1,2 which\nindicates the need to increase the number of the samples.\nIn relation to ACE gene polymorphism and its associa-\ntion with T2DM and its long-term complications in the\nBahraini people, we reported earlier that there was a high\nlevel of the D allele and DD genotypes of the ACE I/D gene\namong the general Bahraini population.20 In turn, this may\nexplain the highest prevalence of T2DM and its complica-\ntions in addition to hypertension in Bahraini population.1\nThe mode of action of the ACE I/D gene was not known\nuntil now, however, earlier reports showed that D allele is\nassociated with higher plasma ACE concentrations.9,21\nSimilarly, other studies have now shown that patients with\nthe DD genotype can develop cellular hypertrophy, prolif-\neration and disruption of the extracellular matrix and\nsecrete cytokine and growth factors. Collectively, these ini-\ntial data suggest that ACE I/D polymorphism is a candidate\ngene for increasing the incidence, pathogenesis and pro-\ngression of several diseases including cardiomyopathy,25\nhypertension26 and T2DM with its long-term macro and\nmicro vascular complications27 including diabetic nephrop-\nathy.28 This is further supported by data in this and earlier\nstudies confirming the association of D allele and DD gen-\notypes with the risk of development T2DM.2 Moreover,\nthese observations are also in close agreement with other\npopulation studies confirming the association of ACE I/D\nAlthough the current study did not show any effect of\nthe MTHFR gene and its combination with ACE I/D gene\nin the progression of T2DM in Bahrainis, further investiga-\ntion is required to support the current study. Yet, the rela-\ntionship between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and\nits exact action with T2DM worldwide is under question.\nSeveral previous studies have shown no association\nbetween the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM\nCzech populations.35 In contrast, other data have indicated\na significant association with T2DM among Moroccan,36\nChinese37 and Polish38 populations with the possibility of\nincreased risks of cardiovascular disease and hyperten-\nsion.39 In addition, ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymor-\nphisms in combination have been reported to increase the\nrisk of developing T2DM in the Tunisian populations3 who\nsuffer from ischemic stroke6 and pregnancy-induced hyper-\ntension.40 However, neither the ACE I/D nor the C677T\nMTHFR polymorphism was reported to be associated with\nrisk of myocardial infarction in the Polish population.38\nIn conclusion, the present data confirmed the significant\nassociation of T2DM with ACE I/D polymorphism but no\nsignificant association with MTHFR C677T. Furthermore,\nno influence was detected on the progression of diabetes\nwhen both polymorphisms were combined.\n"
