In fact, an\noverweight smoker's life expectancy is, on average, 13 years\nshorter than a normal weight nonsmoker's life expectancy (2).\nThe associations between obesity and smoking are complex. In\ngeneral, smoking is associated with lower body weight (3\u00ad6). It\nis hypothesized that smoking lowers body weight set-point (7),\nwhich leads to increased energy expenditure until the nicotine-\ninduced set-point is achieved (8). In addition, smoking gener-\nally extends satiety, which may decrease between-meal snacking\nand caloric intake (7). An alternative hypothesis is that smoking\ndelays the usual age-related weight gain (9,10). Smokers' body\nweight also may vary depending on frequency of smoking and\nsocioeconomic status. It has been shown that individuals who\nsmoke heavily are typically more overweight than light smok-\ners (11\u00ad13) and lower socioeconomic status is associated with\nincreased likelihood of being overweight (14). Finally, although\non-going smoking may be related to lower body weight, smok-\ning cessation is often followed by weight gain (3,15).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report to compare the\nprevalence of obesity in smokers seeking treatment as part of\na smoking cessation trial with a general population sample of\nnever smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. This will\nilluminatewhetherthemostat-risksmokers,thosewithcomor-\nbid obesity, are especially likely, or unlikely, to volunteer for\ncessation treatment. In addition, it is important to characterize\nthe nature of the risk posed by the concurrent risk factors of\nobesity and smoking. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to\ncompare the prevalence of obesity and other health character-\nistics among treatment-seeking smokers using participants in\nthe Wisconsin Smokers' Health Study (WSHS), with a \ngeneral\npopulation of smokers participating in the National Health\nMethods and Procedures\ncomplete baseline BMI, smoking, and demographic characteristics\nfrom the WSHS were selected.

Data from treatment-seeking\nsmokers in the Wisconsin Smokers' Health Study (WSHS) and individuals who completed the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005\u00ad2006 were pooled and obesity rates and other health characteristics\nwere compared. The prevalence of obesity was significantly higher among WSHS treatment-seeking smokers\n(36.8%) vs. NHANES current smokers (29.6%), but the obesity rates of WSHS treatment-seeking smokers did not\ndiffer from NHANES former smokers (36.5%) or never smokers (36.5%). Treatment-seeking smokers were more\nlikely to be female and to have higher educational attainment compared to NHANES participants. Analysis of health\ncharacteristics revealed that treatment-seeking smokers had higher levels of dietary fiber and vitamin C and lower\nblood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose compared to NHANES current smokers. Results\nsuggest that treatment-seeking smokers may have a different health profile than current smokers in the general\npopulation. Health care providers should be aware of underlying heath issues, particularly obesity, in patients seeking\nsmoking cessation treatment.\n1School of Medicine and Public Health, Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA; 2School of Medicine and\nPublic Health, Department of Medicine, Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.\nCorrespondence: Tara L.

Exclusion criteria\nincluded using any noncigarette form of tobacco, currently taking\nbupropion, medical contraindications for any of the study medica-\ntions (bupropion, nicotine patch, or nicotine lozenge), high alcohol\nconsumption (6 drinks per day on 6 or 7 days of the week), history of\nseizure, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, an eating dis\norder,\na recent cardiac event, or allergies to the medications. (M.E. Piper,\nS.S. Smith, T.R. Schlam et al, unpublished data).\nTo compare treatment-seeking smokers with a general \npopulation\nof smokers, we selected participants, age 20, from the NHANES\nstage probability sample of the noninstitutionalized population of\nthe United States. Certain population subgroups were oversampled,\nincluding adolescents aged 12\u00ad19 years, African Americans, and\nMexican Americans, to allow for precise estimates from each group.\nFrom the NHANES sample with complete data for BMI, smoking, and\ndemographic \ncharacteristics (n = 4,081), we identified three classes\nand current smokers (n = 588, defined as smoking >10 cigarettes per\nday). Thus the combined NHANES and WSHS final sample (n = 5,509)\nincluded 4,081 individuals (never, former, and current smokers) from\nthe NHANES sample and 1,428 treatment-seeking smokers from the\nWSHS sample.\nFor both the WSHS and the NHANES samples, BMI was calculated\nusing participants' clinically measured weight and height (kg/m2). A\nclassified as normal weight, a BMI of 25.0\u00ad29.9 as overweight, and a\nBMI of 30.0 as obese (16). Seventy-seven participants were classified\nas underweight. Because these individuals made up a small proportion\nof the total sample (1.4%), we combined these individuals with the\nnormal weight category.\nIn addition to BMI, we used demographic, dietary, blood lipids and\nglucose, and smoking behavior variables collected from the WSHS and\nNHANES to further compare health characteristics among the groups\nof smokers.\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC), where standard descriptive statistics (mean or %) were used\nto describe demographic, physical, and lifestyle variables. For signifi-\ncance testing, 2-tests were used to compare categorical variables and\ngeneral linear models were used for continuous variables. An  of 0.05\nwas used to identify significant differences between treatment-seeking\nsmokers, current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. This\nstudy was approved by the University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison Human\nSubjects Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows that obesity was significantly more prevalent\namong treatment-seeking smokers in the WSHS than current\nCombined overweight/obesity rates in treatment-seeking\nsmokers were similar to NHANES never smokers (70.7 and\n70.8%, respectively), while NHANES former smokers had the\nhighest rates (74.4%) and NHANES current smokers had the\nTable 1 shows selected demographic, smoking, diet, and\nbiochemical characteristics among smokers in the WSHS and\nNHANES samples.

Finally, current smokers in\nthe NHANES general population sample had the lowest com-\nbined rates of overweight/obesity compared to never smokers,\nformer smokers, and treatment-seeking smokers. Data from\ncurrent smokers in the NHANES sample support the finding\nthat smokers tend to have lower body weight than nonsmokers,\npossibly due to differences in body weight set-points (3\u00ad7). We\nhad originally anticipated a similar finding among treatment-\nseeking smokers, but this was not the case. One possible expla-\nnation for why the sample of \ntreatment-seeking smokers was\nactually more obese than the sample of current smokers is that\nthe treatment-seeking sample was drawn from smokers living\nTable 1Selected demographic, smoking, and health characteristics by smoking status in adults participating in the NHANES\nCharacteristic\nTreatment-seeking\nEthnicity (%)\nEducation (%)\nSmoking behaviors\n Time to smoke after waking (%)\n Cigarettes smoke/day (%)\nDiet behaviors (mean \u00b1 s.d.)\nBiochemical (mean \u00b1 s.d.)\nFor continuous variables, values in the same row with different superscript numbers are significantly different, P < 0.05 (Tukey\u00adKramer adjustment for multiple \ncomparisons).\nFor categorical variables, superscript number 1 represents significance of P < 0.0001 in WSHS treatment-seeking smokers vs. NHANES current smokers on basis of\n2-comparisons.\nHDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; WSHS, Wisconsin Smokers' Health Study.\nbrief reports\n \nin Wisconsin. This regional sample may have higher obesity\nrates in general than national estimates. However, this expla-\nnation is unlikely because the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System found that obesity rates for Wisconsin are\nOne last possible explanation involves the current study's\nfinding that the treatment-seeking smokers smoked at a\nheavier rate than the current smokers in the general popula-\ntion. It may be that individuals who smoke at a higher rate\n(i.e., smoke more cigarettes per day) are more likely to seek\ncessation treatment due to their inability to quit (18,19). In\naddition, individuals who smoke more may be more over-\nprevious quit attempts (23).\nIn the present study, current NHANES smokers appeared\nto have poorer lifestyle behaviors than never smokers, former\nsmokers, and treatment-seeking smokers. This finding was\nexpected, as risk behaviors (low intake of fruits and vegeta-\nbles, low physical activity, and high alcohol consumption)\ntypically cluster together in smokers (24). However, this trend\nwas not found in treatment-seeking smokers who appeared to\nhave healthier diet habits than current smokers. Treatment-\nseeking smokers may not only be motivated to quit smoking,\nbut may also be more likely to adopt other healthy behaviors.\nThis possibility is supported from our data which show that\ntreatment-seeking smokers have higher intakes of vitamin C\nand fiber, and lower levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides,\nand fasting glucose compared to current smokers in the gen-\neral population, which may reflect healthier eating.\nThis study should be interpreted with certain caveats.\nFirst, we compared a national sample (the NHANES) with\na regional sample (the WSHS), and differences in the eth-\nnic composition of the two samples may have affected our\nresults. The representation of African Americans, Hispanics,\nand other ethnicities was lower in the WSHS sample than\nin the NHANES sample, and therefore care should be taken\nin extrapolating the findings for the WSHS sample beyond\nwhite treatment-seeking smokers. Second, this study only\nexamined dependent smokers who smoked 10 cigarettes per\nday. This inclusion criteria may have resulted in an under-\nrepresentation of African-American smokers in both samples\nbecause African-American smokers often smoke relatively\nfew cigarettes per day (25,26). Finally, the higher prevalence\nof obesity among the WSHS treatment-seeking smokers\nthan among the NHANES current smokers could reflect that\nsmokers willing to participate in cessation trials, in which\nthey are compensated for their time, may have certain char-\nacteristics (such as low socioeconomic status) associated\nwith negative health outcomes, such as obesity. However, in\na recent study, lifetime characteristics such as socioeconomic\nstatus, education, and ethnicity were similar between smok-\ners who participated in a smoking cessation trial and those\nIn conclusion, we found that treatment-seeking smok-\ners are more likely to be obese compared to a general pop-\nulation of smokers. Our data further revealed that despite\nthe increased health risks due to obesity, treatment-seeking\nsmokers had healthier dietary habits and better blood lipid\nprofiles and blood glucose control than current smokers in\nthe general population, possibly due to making other lifestyle\nchanges, in addition to seeking smoking cessation treatment.\nHealth care professionals should be aware that patients seek-\ning smoking cessation treatments may be at particular risk for\nobesity related outcomes and providing patients with weight\nmanagement or interventions after cessation treatment may\nbe important.\n"
