Introduction\nFree societies attach great importance to public opinion, and rightly so. It's legitimacy is beyond\ndoubt. The role played by public opinion in the conduct of a modern free state is well known [1]. One\nway to find a free society's expression is through opinion polls that are useful in understanding the\npublic's attitude towards specific issues at a particular point in time.\nThe rise of mass-media after the 2nd World War made public opinion polls almost impossible to\ndiscount. Compared to other democratic societies the public participation in policy formulation has\nbeen relatively higher from the time the U.S. was a young nation. In the early years after the birth of\nthis nation, the Jeffersonian view of a bottom-up approach had an edge over the top-down decision\nmaking propounded by both Hamilton and Madison. One of the plausible explanations for this edge is\nthe American Revolutionary War against the British monarchy, which was a rejection of that symbol\nof authoritarian control of the affairs of the state. Both the French statesman Tourquiville (in the early\n18th century) and the British philosopher Bryce (in the late 18th Century) have widely commented on\nthe U.S. public participation in policy making. Over time mass education contributed even more to the\nnotion of participatory citizenry in the governance and public affairs at all levels of society. However,\nthe contribution of public opinion to policy formulation was more theoretical than empirical. The\nmiddle of 20th Century saw the emergence of the new discipline in of Political Science, armed with\nempirical and analytical tools and mass-media based polling techniques as a direct result of rise of\nmass-media after the 2nd World War. For the first time, polling techniques could be used to measure\nthe public's views on policy issues, and ever since then public opinion polls have become a major\nplayer in the states' affairs. However, between the theory of public participation in governance (pre 2nd\nworld war) and practical tools for measuring its contribution is the almost hidden process of how mass\nopinions are formed and how consensus (or lack of it) among the public builds over various issues [2].\nFurther, once the public reaches a consensus what is the process by which such a consensus is\nmaintained?\n2. Background\nIn this paper we analyze the public's high job approval rating for President Clinton. Nearly every\nmajor public opinion poll since January 1998 has given the President a job approval rating of near 60%\nand above (Figure 1)\nM\nM\nay\nO\nN\nM\nO\nD\nN\nO\nApril\nAug.\nD\nec.\nFeb\nSep\nD\nec\nM\nNo data\nPost broke the story\nRepublican Victory\nHealth Care Reform\nSuch high ratings are unusual for the following reasons.\n\u00b7 Historically, second term presidents lose their popularity especially when the presidency is already\nbeing branded by the elite as a \"lame duck.\"\n\u00b7 If a presidency has been dogged by one or another scandal from the day of inauguration (the\nWhitewater, the travel office, FBI files, the presidential campaign fund controversy, and at least\nhalf a dozen Independent prosecutor investigations against cabinet secretaries). These begin to\ntake a toll on popularity as individual power and election support attenuates.\n\u00b7 American politics do not allow second acts [3], i.e., if you make a mistake you often pay the price\nwith your job or at least your popularity.\n\u00b7 Almost no one can retain his/her approval ratings in the face of an unfolding and hence continuous\nscandal (Watergate: Nixon's approval rating fell to 31% in August, 1973, a 36% drop in six\nmonths; Irangate: during the Carter presidency, 31% by October, 1979; Iran-Contra during the\n\u00b7 Unlike other scandals the Lewinsky scandal had the recency effect, in the sense it was something\nthat did not happen a long time ago.\n\u00b7 Unlike other scandals where a president's involvement was at the most circumstantial and\nperipheral the Lewinsky scandal offered no such defense.\n\u00b7 It was impossible to ignore the scandal because there was no escape from the multimedia (TV,\nnewspapers, magazines and internet) exposure and round the clock coverage, most of which was\nnot flattering to the president.\nSeveral explanations have been offered to explain the President's continuing high approval rate.\nMuch has been made of the correlation between good economic times and high approval rating of a\nsitting president. In fact this has been used as the main explanatory variable for the president's\npopularity, i.e, people feel good about their economic well being and give credit to the President.\nSome have talked about scandal weariness among the people. Still others have said that America was\nbecoming more like Europe where personal indiscretions do not affect the public's view of politicians.\nA variation of that has been that, as long as there is no threat to national security people do not mind\nthe not-so-perfect private lives of their elected officials. Yet others have offered the explanation of\nhow the partisan tone of the scandal and the seemingly unfair treatment of the president by the\nopposition made people sympathetic towards the president. Some have talked about cultural and moral\ndecline in the society. In short there have been many explanations, possibly each of them has played a\npart in giving the president such high job approval. So what is driving such high poll numbers? A\nmodel based on Shannon's information entropy is presented in this paper. The results are tested by the\ndata from the ABC/Washington Post's polling archives [5] and it's validity is confirmed using\nKendall's  statistics [6].\nOpinion polls are snap shots of the public's perception. As stated earlier, every major public\nopinion poll between January 1998 and February 1999 gave the president a very high job approval\nrating, reflecting the public's perception of his ability to do the work. It was not as if public did not\nknow about the scandal. One could not have escaped the media coverage of the scandal. So what is\nthe explanation for giving the president such high approval? Could it be that the public filtered out all\nthe noise that passed for minute details about the affair and concentrated mainly on the essence of the\nstory? In other words, once the public realized in the first few days following the January 21st news,\nthat there were no national security issues, nor any financial mismanagement, the entire story became a\ntragedy of human failings. Throughout the following year the basic story remained same. Every new\nand so-called breaking news did not seem to add any new information to the public's perception of the\npresident's behavior.\nAs far back as the 1992 election, the plurality of the public had ignored the character issue and\nvoted Clinton into the office in the three-way race. In the following years, as the public became more\naware of many of his private peccadilloes it continued to separate the president's public life from his\npersonal problems. For example, even after the reinstatement of the Jones lawsuit in May of 1996, the\npublic seemed to have compartmentalized Clinton's private and public lives [7].\nThe following section will introduce the main points of information entropy. Section IV tests the\nmodel using archived data from public opinion polls and the results validated using the Kendall's \nstatistic. Section V provides the conclusion and suggests the future research.\n3. Surprise and Information Entropy\nIn communication theory, the information content of an event is measured in terms of surprise or\nthe unexpectedness of the occurrence of such an event [8]. Suppose, a weather forecast for the North-\nEast U.S. is for light showers on a spring day, and indeed it does rain. Such a forecast has little or no\ninformation value, since the occurrence of showers during the spring season is expected or is a norm.\nInstead if heavy snow is forecast for spring and actually occurs, then such a forecast has more surprise\nand hence high information content than the forecast of spring showers. Thus, the information content\nof a statement is decided by the degree of surprise or unexpectedness of an event. If an event can\noccur in n different ways, then the amount of information obtained is higher when the outcome of the\nevent is least expected. In other words, the least probable event has the most information. Next, let us\nquantify the above explanation in mathematical terms with the help of an example.\nSuppose a card is drawn from a randomly shuffled deck of 52 cards then:\n1. Event A refers to the drawn card being a spade and the probability of obtaining a card of spade is\np(A) = 13/52 = 1/4. Let I(A) denote the information associated with event A.\n2. Event B refers to the drawn card being an ace, and the probability of obtaining an ace is p(B) =\n4/52 = 1/13. Let I(B) refer to the information associated with the event B.\n3. Event C refers to the drawn card being an ace of spade and the probability of obtaining an ace of\nspade is given by the joint probabilities of events A and B and is\np( A  B) = (1/4)*(1/13). And the information associated with the joint events is given by\nI(C)= I(A  B).\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n.\nB\np\nA\np\nB\nA\np\nC\np =\n\n=\nObviously, the probability of drawing an ace of spades from a perfectly shuffled deck of cards is\nmuch less than the probability of drawing any ace, which is less than that of drawing a spades, i,e,\np(C) <= p(B) <= p(A). In other words,\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n.\nA\nI\nB\nI\nB\nA\nI\nC\nI \n\n\n=\nMoreover the event of drawing the ace of spades has more surprise (information) than the event of\ndrawing any ace, which in turn has more surprise (information) than drawing a spades from a deck of\ncards,\n( )\n)\nE\n(\np \n\nNote that the probability of any event E taking place has the following relations:\n( ) ( )\n\nE\nI\nAnd the information associated with that event E can never be negative, i.e.,\nSo what could be the function that will satisfy relations expressed in equations (1) through (4)?\nAccording to Shannon's Information theory [9], the log function will satisfy all of the above relations.\nThus for an event E, a relation of between information I(E) and probability of event E exists:\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n,\nE\np\nlog\nE\nI\nb\n-\n\nwhere, the constant b > 0 is called the base of logarithm. The negative sign helps preserve the non-\nnegativity property of information (equation (4)). Since probability of an event is bounded between 0\nand 1 (equation (3), the logarithm function will hold both for an event that is certain and for an event\nthat is impossible. When an event is certain (its probability is 1), the information associated with it is\nzero. On the other hand, when an event is impossible (its probability is zero), the associated\ninformation is infinite. In the case of an event of drawing an ace of spade the log of joint probability\ntranslates to addition of information of two events, the drawing a spade and the drawing an ace. The\nfollowing equations illustrate the information relations for the above example.\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\n[ ] ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nB\nI\nA\nI\nC\nI\nB\np\nlog\nA\np\nlog\nB\np\nA\np\nlog\nB\nA\nI\nC\nI\n)\n/\nlog(\nB\np\nlog\nB\nI\n)\n/\nlog(\nA\np\nlog\nA\nI\n+\n=\n\n+\n-\n=\n-\n=\n\n=\n-\n=\n-\n=\n-\n=\n-\n=\nThe example above satisfies both the logical and algebraic requirements in the computation of\ninformation content.\nNext let us consider an event that has n number of possible outcomes defined by a probability\ndistribution function f(p\ni\n) over all i=[1, n]. Then what is the average or expected information H of all\nof these events? H is computed as follows:\n( ) ( ) ( )\n\n-\n=\nn\ni\ni\ni\nn\np\nlog\np\np\n,\n,\np\n,\np\nH \nEquation (10) gives the mean or average information associated with an event that is defined in\nterms of its probability function f (P). It is also known as the information entropy of the event, an\nexpression of the degree of randomness in the occurrence of an event. If one does not have an a priori\ndistribution of the probabilities of an event then using the principle of symmetry [10], one must assume\nthat the event occurs with uniform distribution of probability [11]. Such probability distributions are\nreferred to as non-informative because all outcomes are equally possible, and such distributions offer\nminimum information or maximum entropy. For example if an event K can occur in n ways then the\nprobability of each of these outcomes is 1/n and hence the information entropy H\nmax\nis given by:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nn\nlog\nn\n/\nlog\nn\n/\nlog\nn\n/\nH\nn\nmax\n=\n-\n=\n-\n= \nEquation (11) gives minimum average information or maximum information entropy of the event K.\nSuppose, that there is a way to assign a probability distribution because we have information about\nhow the event K occurs, i.e., we have an alternate probability distribution of event K then the let\ninformation entropy associated with such distribution be, H\nC\n,, then the relative entropy of information\nH\nR\nis computed as follows:\n( )\nmax\nC\nH\nH =\nand the organization S is a measure of order or lack of disorder defined as 1 - H\nR\norder is introduced due to knowing an alternate probability distribution of event K as opposed to\nuniform probability distribution and is computed as follows:\n( )\nH\nS\nR\n-\n=\nAn example due to Jessop [8] will make these ideas a little more clear. The Maximum entropy\nassociated with the English language with 26 letters and an average of 8 letters per word is 3.296. This\nwould be equivalent to having a language where all alphabets were equally possible in all 8 letter\nwords, a language with no patterns in the letters and the words. However, the English language does\nexhibit a pattern which makes it intelligible and hence the structured nature of the English language\nobtain a proxy for computing the organization of the English language as = 1- 0.865= 0.135.\nIn the next section let us apply the concepts of information entropy to the public opinion polls\nconducted over a one year period across the nation and its regions, namely the Eastern, the\nMidwestern, the Southern and the Western. Using the definition of surprise or unexpectedness, the\nconcept of maximum entropy, the relative entropy and the order, we can analyze the constancy of the\n4. Application of Information Entropy to the Polling Data\nSuppose, that as part of public opinion polls an unbiased sample of 100 people are selected and each\none of them is asked to record his/her opinion to the following question:\nDo you approve or disapprove of the way the president is doing his job? Of the three select one:\nYes, No, Don't know.\nBefore conducting such a poll, the outcomes according to the principle of symmetry can be:1/3rd of\nthe respondents approve; 1/3rd do not approve and 1/3rd say they don't know. Then the a priori amount\nof information entropy or disorder is given by:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nlog\n/\nlog\n/\nH\nb\n=\n=\n-\n= \nBut as soon as the public opinion is known then the amount of information entropy or ignorance is\nsubject to the actual number of people that answered yes, no and don't know. For example, in the 1992\nelection, Mr. Clinton got 43% of the votes, Mr. Bush got 38% and Mr. Perot got 18%. Then using the\nvote percentages as the proxy for expressing the approval of a candidate, the information entropy for\n[ ] ( )\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\nH =\n\u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n-\n=\nA little improvement is found in equation (15) over the unbiased ignorance of equation (14), since\nthe public knows a little more about the candidate Clinton. In the four years since 1992, the public\nbecame more informed about Mr. Clinton and the poll numbers for the 1996 presidential elections\nreflect the public's approval/disapproval. The following is the breakdown of the percentage of votes\nreceived by each candidate: 49% for Mr. Clinton; 41% for Mr. Dole 41% and 9% for Mr. Perot In\nother words, using the same question from the public opinion poll above, these election votes can be\nseen as 49% saying Yes, 41% saying No and 9% saying Don't Know. Using this data, we obtain from\n[ ] ( )\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\n)\n.\nlog(\n.\nH =\n\u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n-\n=\nThus by 1996, the information entropy or the lack of ignorance was already down by about ~15%.\nAfter the election and all through 1996 Mr. Clinton continued to get better job approval numbers than\never before (See Figure 1, based on data [5] and [7]). By the end of 1997, 59% approved of the job he\nwas doing, the equivalent of information entropy H\nBetween 1992 and 1997, the Clinton Administration was dogged by one or another kind of scandal. In\nspite of such bad publicity, by the end of 1997 enough people knew about Clinton to compartmentalize\nhis public and private lives. In fact, by normalizing the current entropy level with respect to the 1992\ninformation entropy (H\nH\nFurther, the measure of order or organization in Mr. Clinton's job approval rating by the end of\nFigure 2 shows Mr. Clinton's job approval rating for selected dates between 1998 and 1999 (data\nfrom [5]).\nJan\nJan\nFeb\nApr\nJul\nAug\nSep\nSep\nOct\nOct\nDec\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nNeutral\nDisapprove\nApprove\nFigure 2.

Regional entropy of president`s job approval/disapproval rating.\nThus even an average R\nH\ncomfortable with the conduct, did not want Mr. Clinton to be removed from the office. Figure 4 shows\nthe regional approval data and Figure 5 shows the relative magnitudes of the maximum entropy and\nthe regional entropies. The East region has the least amount of entropy. The South, the Midwest and\nthe West regions all converge towards 0.3 and below entropy levels. Similarly, near constant figure\nare computed for the polling data by education and by sex. Even the party affiliations data shows a\nsimilar trend, as if there was a lock in among the Democrats and the Independents in favor of the\nPresident, along with a tiny number of Republicans, while nearly 60% of Republicans disapproved of\nClinton's job performance.\nValidation of the data using the Kendall's  statistics\nKendall's  statistics [6] measures trends in the time series data that has been collected a\nperiodically. If the computed statistic is zero or near zero then there is no trend, suggesting a near\nconstancy of the values in the time series. If the statistics tends to be near +1 then there is an upward\nor increasing trend in the time series values and a decreasing or downward trend of the statistic tends\nto be near -1. Using data from Figure 1, it was found that the statistic remained nearly zero (a bit\nthe near constant value of the information entropy and near constant organization factor (See Figure 2).\ndownward trend and between January of 1995 and December of 1997 the  statistic shows a value of\nstatistics stays steady with near zero value of -0.04762. All of these results agree with the charts\nshown in Figures 1 and 2. Similar statistics were computed for the regional data, both for approval and\ndisapproval numbers. The tables 1 and 2 below show the computed values for approval and\ndisapproval respectively by the regions.\nTable 1. Approval  statistic.\nApproval East Midwest South West\nKendall's \nTable 2. Disapproval  statistic.\nDisapproval East Midwest South West\nKendall's \nBoth the figures in the tables show a lock in of the statistics; only the West has a slightly higher\nnegative value, which suggests that the disapproval numbers decreased over the time period. The data\nin the tables confirms the regional constancy of the information entropy, as shown in Figure 4.\n6. Conclusions and Future Research\nThe information entropy model offers a way to test the public's confidence level in a public figure\ndespite the controversy surrounding the issues. In democratic societies a majority vote is accepted as a\nsign of victory. But in reality, even a super majority may not settle the issues completely. For\nexample, even a three way vote distribution of 75%, 15% and 10% results in an entropy H = 0.31, or\nH\nR\n= 0.67, a reduction of just 33% from the maximum entropy. It may be interesting to investigate\nwhat level of entropy translates into total acceptance of an issue by the public. The model needs to be\ntested on other situations and types of data where there is a vast of number of choices expressed by the\npublic and adding values or weighs to different opinions. Additionally, the model needs to be\naugmented with an opinion formation model. An attempt will be made to integrate the current model\nwith the one developed by Paelinck [13]. The concept of organization factor S needs to be developed\nfurther and tested. A link between organization factor S and self-organizing systems will be explored.\n"
