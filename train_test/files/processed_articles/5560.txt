This has included identifying support options that can be used by Veterans in times\nof distress or crisis. For example, Veterans at increased risk of suicide will sometimes voice complaints indicative of a need\nfor spiritual and pastoral care support. At U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, such support is provided to\nVeterans by clinical chaplains. This discussion paper aims to present the contextual framework in which chaplaincy services\nare provided to Veterans at increased risk of suicide, better conceptualize the spiritual and pastoral care needs of at-risk\nVeterans who request chaplaincy services, and offer practical suggestions for framing the provision of spiritual and pastoral\ncare services.\n",

At present, the\nnumber of Veterans who die by suicide is estimated at 18 to\n22 per day, accounting for approximately 18% of all suicide\ncompletions in the United States (Centers for Disease Control\nrates are thought to be due, at least in part, to the increased\nincidence of diagnosed mental health disorders in this group\n(LeardMann et al., 2013). Be that as it may, suicide is much\nmore than just a mental health issue (Department of Health\nand Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, &\nNational Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2012).\nResearch finds that more than 50% of those who die by sui-\ncide do not have a psychiatric diagnosis (Bertolote &\nFleischmann, 2002). This highlights the need for novel sup-\nport options, not limited only to formal mental health ser-\nvices, which can be accessed by at-risk populations.\nAll VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) staff clinical chaplains\nwho provide spiritual and pastoral care services when\nrequested by the Veteran. Pastoral care is sometimes defined\nas \"a therapeutic modality distinguished by the dialogue of\ncaregiver and careseeker that explores the possibility and\nimplications of a religious definition of the latter's situation\"\ntion of presence and purpose that includes a sense of\nmeaning\" and is inclusive of pastoral care (VandeCreek &\nBurton, 2001, p. 2). Most chaplains also provide a number of\nservices not directly affiliated with any faith tradition, such\nas crisis intervention, emotional enabling, ethical consulta-\ntion, deliberation, life review, patient advocacy, counseling,\nbereavement, and empathetic listening (Handzo et al., 2008).\nUnlike some community-level clergy or pastoral care pro-\nviders, clinical chaplains are specially trained to support\npatients in health care settings.\nVA chaplains have assumed a unique place within the\nstructure of services provided at VAMCs. As a matter of pol-\nicy, the comprehensive health care package offered to\nVeterans is expected to include spiritual and pastoral care\n(i.e., when so requested by the patient; Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 2008a).

Furthermore,\na paucity of literature exists describing the potential applica-\nbility of chaplaincy services to at-risk Veteran populations.\nThis discussion paper aims to present the contextual frame-\nwork in which chaplaincy services are provided to Veterans\nat increased risk of suicide, better conceptualize the spiritual\nand pastoral care needs of at-risk Veterans who request chap-\nlaincy services, and offer practical suggestions for framing\nthe provision of spiritual and pastoral care services.\nAs the largest integrated health care system in the United\nStates (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2013b), VA pro-\ngrams reach Veteran populations recognized as being at\nincreased risk of suicide (Blow et al., 2012; McCarthy et al.,\n2009). The experiences of VA chaplains included in this arti-\ncle are meant to offer a degree of practical insight into at-risk\nVeteran spiritual and pastoral care needs, which may also\nserve to better inform the provision of such services in other\nclinical and community settings.\nA Contextual Framework for\nChaplaincy Services\nAvailable literature and anecdotal evidence suggest that\nmany Veterans ascribe a degree of importance to religion and\nSocial and Demographic Trends, 2011). While \"religion\"\nand \"spirituality\" are frequently used interchangeably, these\nterms actually represent two distinct domains. Religion\nrefers to \"the outwards and often social articulation of belief\nin higher powers, often practiced in a community setting\" (p.\n345) and spirituality is thought to refer to \"an individual's\nquest for understanding the true meaning of life and the\ndesire to integrate with the transcendent or sacred\" (Jonas,\nhaving achieved \"a positive outcome that is meaningful for\npeople and for many sectors of society\" (Centers for Disease\nAchieving a sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being\nis of practical significance to suicide prevention efforts as\nthese domains are thought to cut across the various behav-\nioral, physical, psychological, and social factors which might\nlead one to suicidal behavior (Brown, Carney, Parrish, &\nbeing is considered protective against suicidal behavior (The\nAssessment and Management of Risk for Suicide Working\nGroup, 2013; Department of Health and Human Services\nAvailable research suggests that some at-risk Veteran popu-\nlations have a diminished sense of self-reported spiritual\nwell-being (Kopacz, 2014), highlighting the relevance of\nthese domains to Veteran suicide prevention efforts.\nVA chaplaincy services draw on the principles of\nmeaning-making and look to enhance religious and/or spiri-\ntual well-being by developing a sense of meaning and pur-\npose in the lives of Veterans (Department of VeteransAffairs,\n2008a). VA chaplaincy services are meant to uncover mean-\ning and purpose in one's relationships with self, others, ideas,\nnature, and, when relevant for the Veteran, with a higher\npower, benevolent deity, or God. This is done by examining\none's relationships in the context of their spiritual and/or reli-\ngious values. Meaning and purpose are considered vital for\nensuring a variety of positive physical and psychological\nhealth outcomes (Schulenberg, Hutzell, Nassif, & Rogina,\nAs suggested by Frankl (1984), \"If therapists wish to foster\ntheir patients' mental health, they should not be afraid to cre-\nate a sound amount of tension through a reorientation toward\nthe meaning of one's life\" (p. 128).\nChaplains focus on relationships because they are thought\nto form an intra-, inter-, and trans-relational web that houses\na person's sense of meaning and purpose (Snyder, Lopez, &\nPedrotti, 2011). A degree of distress, inclusive of spiritual\ndistress, may arise when one or more of these relationships\nare threatened or broken. Table 1 presents examples of what\nmany chaplains understand to be indicative of spiritual dis-\ntress. The more significant a particular relationship is, the\ngreater the spiritual distress. Spiritual wholeness is restored\nwhen that which threatens or breaks the patient's relational\nweb of meaning is removed, transformed, integrated, or\ntranscended.\nVeteran Spiritual Needs\nVA chaplains will oftentimes provide care to at-risk Veterans\ndealing with spiritual or moral injury arising from past mili-\ntary experiences as well as a variety of life circumstances not\nnecessarily related to military service. These circumstances\nchallenge the Veteran's existing relationships, forcing him or\nher to redefine their existing sense of meaning and purpose.\nJust as the process of human development affords stages of\ngrowth, so too does spiritual development afford the oppor-\ntunity for living a life of integrity in which life experiences\nKopacz et al. 3\nreflect a deepening of one's spiritual development. It is\nexpected that one's adulthood experiences will instill change\nand transformation within one's spiritual journey. The pro-\ncess of transformation reflects these experiences, experi-\nences that are not childhood experiences but, rather, those of\nan adult. VA chaplains support the Veteran in his or her own\nsearch for meaning as well as determination of what these\nexperiences may have contributed to their spiritual journey.\nAdvances in the organization and delivery of battlefield\nhealth care mean that many service personnel are surviving\ntrauma, which would have otherwise proven fatal in combat\nManring, Hawk, Calhoun, & Andersen, 2009). While bodily\nwounds may heal, this has led to an increase in the number of\nVeterans dealing with otherwise \"invisible wounds.\"\nIndividuals with a history of military service in times of war\nfrequently suffer from psychological distress at varying\ndegrees of severity (Gray, Kaiser, Hawksworth, Hall, &\nBarrett-Connor, 1999). The diagnostic status of Veterans\nnificantly influenced by trauma exposure outside of warzone\ntraumatic stress (Dedert et al., 2009; Hankin, Spiro, Miller,\n& Kazis, 1999). The VA expects that the number of Veterans\nrequiring mental health services will continue to increase in\nthe coming years (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2013a).\nThe conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan differ from those of\npast wars, among others, based on the all-volunteer force as\nwell as the types of warfare conducted in these regions (Hoge\net al., 2004). The unique nature of these conflicts--reflective\nof theater-specific duties and experiences--could influence\nsymptom presentation and treatment (Tuerk, Grubaugh,\nHamner, & Foa, 2009). Besides experiencing situations\nwhich may pose a threat to the life of the service member or\nthose close to them, the experience of active duty may also\ninclude witnessing violence, experiencing a painful loss, or\nhaving one's ethical or moral standards contravened (Nash\nThis has given way to the idea of spiritual or moral injury\nin Veteran populations, conceptually defined as \"perpetrating,\nfailing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts\nthat transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations\"\nchallenge of having to reconcile certain wartime experiences\nwith individual interpretations of right and wrong and is pur-\nported to increase the risk of suicide in some Veteran popula-\nInterpretations of right and wrong may draw on individual\nexperiences related to religion and/or spirituality. In attempt-\ning to deal with different types of trauma, some Veterans\nmight turn to spiritual and pastoral care for support\n(Greenawalt et al., 2011; Mihaljevi, Aukst-Margeti,\nChaplains frequently also encounter at-risk Veterans deal-\ning with a variety of life events (e.g., divorce, illness, rela-\ntionships), not necessarily related to military service. In\nkeeping with pastoral practice, VAchaplains help the Veteran\nuncover a religious and/or spiritual definition in the difficult\ncircumstances they may be experiencing. In doing so, the\naim is to elicit an enhanced sense of meaning and purpose in\nthe life of the Veteran which can be used to better deal with\nturbulent emotions (e.g., loss and grief, hope and despair, joy\nand sadness) arising in the course of these life events as well\nas help reaffirm the Veteran's understanding of self/\npersonhood.\nEmotions frequently encountered in these life circum-\nstances include guilt, sadness, and grief (Berg, 2011; Owens,\nSteger, Whitesell, & Herrera, 2009; Urlic & Simunkovic,\n2009). Guilt is conceptualized as a sense of remorse, regret,\nor self-condemnation, most often linked to a concrete event\n(Bryan, Ray-Sannerud, Morrow, & Etienne, 2013; Henning\nthoughts of self-harm (i.e., suicide ideation) may serve as an\nexpression of remorse for past actions (Bryan, Morrow,\ncrisis situations may arise if a Veteran is unable to express his\nor her guilt in a healthy manner or if he or she rejects social\nsupport, leading to feelings of helplessness and isolation\nSadness and grief are emotional reactions to loss that are\ntypically time-limited (Wellen, 2010). For some Veterans,\ngrief-specific symptoms are distinct from symptoms related\nto war trauma (Pivar & Field, 2004). Nevertheless, if not\ndealt with in a manner appropriate for the individual, grief\ncan become pathological or chronic, adding to one's emo-\nonly a small body of literature has directly examined the\nrelationship between Veteran experiences of grief and differ-\nent health outcomes.\nThe Spiritual Dimension of Suicide\nReligion and suicide have been inextricably linked ever since\nclinicians see religion and spirituality as important to under-\nstanding suicidal behavior (Colucci & Martin, 2008). While\nan extensive literature exists expounding on the many\nTable 1.

Religion and spirituality serve as\nexamples of \"common, culturally generated personal traits,\nsocial relationships, lifestyles, representations of illness and\ntreatments, and/or approaches to planning for prevention and\nmanagement of illness and illness risks\" (Leventhal,\nter understanding the relationship between religion, spiritu-\nality, and suicidal behavior should remain a focus of future\nresearch.\nEngel (1977) proposed a biopsychosocial model of med-\nicine to serve as a conceptual basis for applying the scien-\ntific method to better understand health and illness. This\nmodel posits that health and illness are dependent upon an\ninteraction between biological, psychological, and social\nsystems (Engel, 1980). Spirituality is thought to fall under\nthe social domain of this model (Smith, 2002). Accordingly,\nan enhanced sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being\nmay exact health benefits across all three of these systems\n(Schaefer et al., 2013). For example, individuals who\nascribe a high degree of importance to religion and spiritu-\nality may be more resilient against depression due to ana-\ntomical changes in their central nervous system (Miller\net al., 2014). Meaning and purpose have also consistently\nbeen cited as influencing psychological well-being (Blaek,\npositive social relationships, such as those leading to higher\nsocial support, less loneliness, and less conflict, can be\nbuilt by applying interpersonal constructs frequently asso-\nciated with spiritual and religious tenets, such as gratitude\nand compassion (Jordan, Masters, Hooker, Ruiz, & Smith,\nChaplaincy Services Applied\nFrankl (1984) suggests uncovering meaning and purpose\n\"(1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing\nsomething or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude\nwe take toward unavoidable suffering\" (p. 133). In the\nsame vein, VA chaplains are able to offer spiritual and pas-\ntoral care services aimed at uncovering meaning and pur-\npose in the life of the at-risk Veteran. All such services are\nprovided on a strictly voluntary basis (i.e., based entirely on\nthe private choice of the patient; Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 2008b). The work done by chaplains typically\ninvolves first meeting with the Veteran, assessing their reli-\ngious and/or spiritual needs, and proposing a pastoral care\nplan that can be adapted based on the Veteran's changing\nneeds. VA chaplaincy services do not include a religious\ncomponent unless expressly requested by the patient\n(Department of Veterans Affairs, 2008b). Patients are at lib-\nerty to discontinue any or all services, at any time, and for\nany reason.\nMinistry of Presence\nThe Ministry of Presence serves to facilitate spiritual heal-\ning. \"Ministry of presence in the pastoral office means vul-\nnerability to and participation in the life-world of those\nthe physical presence of a chaplain and their willingness to\nmeet without preconditions (W. F. Sullivan, 2014). The pri-\nmary goal of the Ministry of Presence is to reestablish a\nsense of trust, safety, and consistency for the at-risk Veteran.\nChaplains frequently see those who experience spiritual dis-\ntress as also losing a sense of hope in establishing meaning-\nful relationships. Having felt abandon, such Veterans may\nalso have issues with trust and safety. Ministry of Presence is\nmeant to establish rapport with the individual, leading to a\nrelationship based on consistency. In the context of clinical\nchaplaincy, this involves following the patient's treatment\nagenda and, when appropriate, being pro-active in his or her\nprovision of spiritual care (e.g., offering support after hear-\ning a diagnosis; being consistent and following through with\nTrauma Recovery\nThe search for meaning motivates many Veterans to look for\nsupport from pastoral care providers and VA mental health\nprofessionals (Fontana & Rosenheck, 2005; Hughes &\nHandzo, 2010). Those presenting for VA chaplaincy services\nwill oftentimes look for the restoration of meaning specifi-\ncally related to their trauma, which may \"refer both to the\nnegative events that produce distress and to the distress\nitself\" (Briere & Scott, 2006, p. 3). VA chaplains frequently\nhelp Veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) or those dealing with different types of trauma. A\ndiagnosis of PTSD has been significantly associated with\nsuicidal behavior (Sareen, Houlahan, Cox, & Asmundson,\nas the person with PTSD is seeking to reframe his or her\nassumptions that were held prior to the trauma to accommodate\nthe experience of that trauma, so grief is about redefining one's\nunderstanding of the world, oneself, and others. (p. 56)\nChaplains assist individuals with PTSD to work through\ntheir grief by identifying specific losses, providing a safe\nplace to grieve, providing grief education to normalize emo-\ntional responses, and identifying coping strategies (Hughes\nthat greater consideration should be given to addressing exis-\ntential questions in the treatment of PTSD, stating \"that reso-\nlution of existential questions requires an examination of the\nbases for moral judgments\" (p. 135). VA chaplains help facil-\nitate an examination of morality in the context of the\nVeteran's own religious and/or spiritual background.\nKopacz et al. 5\nHughes and Handzo (2010) also propose eight specific\nspiritual care interventions for those dealing with PTSD:\nclinical use of prayer, healing rituals, confession (i.e., as a\nmeans for guilt resolution and forgiveness-work), percentage\nof guilt distribution, life review/spiritual autobiography\nwork, scripture paralleling/education, reframing God\nassumptions/examining harmful spiritual attributions, and\nencouraging connection with a spiritual community. Prayer\nhas been widely utilized as a coping strategy in clinical set-\nrituals can also help one find a renewed sense of meaning\nConfession helps with the release of feelings of guilt and\nrefocuses the individual on healing through the seeking and\ngiving of forgiveness and pardon (Drescher, Smith, & Foy,\ndistribution helps one reappraise and reframe his or her feel-\nings of guilt by differentiating appropriate from inappropri-\nate guilt. This facilitates a greater ease in dealing with and\nultimately resolving guilt (Scurfield, 2006).\nLife Review\nLife review is defined as \"the process of facilitation of the\nlife review experience or mental process of reviewing one's\nlife\" (Butler, 1963, p. 66). Life review enables one to narrate\nhis or her spiritual autobiography. In doing so, one can redis-\ncover insights, strengths, themes, and so on, and possibly\nfind resonance with his or her current situation following\nexperiences and understanding facilitates a deeper sense of\nmeaning-making. With scripture parallel, one finds scripture\npassages that resonate with or parallel his or her own experi-\nences. This is expected to facilitate meaning, hope, and heal-\ning (Hughes & Handzo, 2010; Landau, Mittal, & Wieling,\n2008). By reframing God assumptions, one reexamines their\nown assumptions about God and God's character. This\nincludes reframing harmful spiritual attributions that may\ncontribute to spiritual distress (Harris et al., 2008; Shaw\net al., 2005). Finally, a chaplain can encourage connection\nwith a spiritual community. This is expected to facilitate\nhealing through connection with a healthy supportive com-\nOther Services\nMantra repetition is considered a spiritual care specialty\nintervention (Hughes & Handzo, 2010). A mantra represents\na word, thought, or sensation--of religious or spiritual sig-\nnificance or with no particular meaning--repeated by the\nindividual (Chan, 2014). A spiritual care provider can utilize\nmantra repetition as a way to focus the patient's attention and\nto bring clarity of the mind. Such an intervention can be par-\nticularly helpful with intrusive recollection, avoidance/\nnumbing, and hyper-vigilance (Bormann et al., 2005).\nCreative writing is another specialty intervention for spiri-\ntual care providers (Hughes & Handzo, 2010). Through this\nintervention, at-risk individuals can discover insights, pro-\ncess grief, and loss, and get in touch with difficult emotions.\nMoreover, such interventions afford the opportunity to inte-\ngrate life experiences over time into a deeper understanding\nof self and relationship to one's environment. The spiritual\ncare provider can facilitate a process in which the patient cre-\natively expresses his or her feelings about the trauma,\ndescribing how it has affected his or her life. This may also\ninclude exploration of the Veteran's feelings in the context of\nreligious and/or spiritual distress (Knaevelsrud & Maercker,\nFrom Theory to Practice\nThere are certain common threads which link at-risk Veterans\nwho engage in chaplaincy services. VA chaplains note that\nmany at-risk Veterans report a history of abuse prior to their\ntime in the military. This would include emotional/psycho-\nlogical, physical, or sexual abuse, or frequently a combina-\ntion of all three. Oftentimes, the Veteran's family of origin\nwas also dysfunctional.\nThis climate is thought to give way to a degree of negative\naffect, including feelings of vulnerability, fear, self-image\nissues, and an inability to trust. The Veteran's emotional\nresponse to their circumstances typically includes anger,\nshame/blame, or guilt. They adapt to this climate by develop-\ning several protective responses. What emerges is an inabil-\nity to be vulnerable after so many years of having one's\nvulnerability violated. Chaplains observe that such individu-\nals will actively seek out and pursue control whenever\nstressed or placed in a trying situation. Security and protec-\ntion are gained through manipulation. Many of these Veterans\nwill then begin to contemplate suicidal behavior after finding\nthemselves in circumstances devoid of the possibility of con-\ntrol, security, and/or protection.\nA typical case will involve a VA chaplain responding to a\nrequest for services made by a patient in a locked-down psy-\nchiatric ward. The patient will most likely have a long his-\ntory of suicide ideation, usually with at least one suicide\nattempt. As related to his or her experiences of religion and/\nor spirituality, the patient will typically profess anger with\nand confusion about God, feelings of rejection by God, and\nambivalence toward life and living. They have skeptically\nsearched for some form of meaning in their lives and perhaps\ntried to establish some type of relationship with a higher\npower. The end result is that the idea of a loving God, who is\nall-powerful, does not make sense to them. Either God does\nnot love him or her, or God is not all-powerful. Some will\nmove toward an atheistic or agnostic worldview as a means\nof lessening their religious and/or spiritual pain.\nAn addictive cycle might develop as other coping skills\ndiminish and fail to provide relief. However, this cycle fails\nto restore the sense of meaning and purpose that they seek\n6 SAGE Open\n(Allen, Nieuwsma, Pollitt, & Blazer, 2014). For some, their\nfailed search for meaning and purpose proves intolerable,\neven more so than before their addictive disorder began. At\nthis stage, many patients will report contemplating suicidal\nbehavior.\nIn collaboration with other clinical mental health provid-\ners, VA chaplains help the patient rediscover the meaning\nand purpose otherwise missing in his or her lives. A new-\nfound sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being, based on\na renewed sense of meaning and purpose, may help the at-\nrisk Veteran to better deal with his or her difficult circum-\nstances (Baumeister, 1990). Select outcomes for spiritual and\npastoral care include increased self-acceptance, better con-\nnecting with others, and, when appropriate for the Veteran,\nreestablishing a relationship with a higher power, benevolent\ndeity, or God.\nConclusion\nThe aim of this discussion paper was to provide practical\ninsight into the spiritual and pastoral care needs of Veterans\nat increased risk of suicide and present the framework in\nwhich VA chaplains attempt to address those needs. As\nresearch examining the different correlates of suicidal behav-\nior among Veteran populations continues to develop, increas-\ning attention will most likely be drawn to the spiritual and\npastoral care needs of at-risk Veterans. Clinical chaplains\nrepresent a professional group qualified to address these\nneeds in health care settings.\nMaking chaplaincy services the focus of empirical\nresearch would invariably help provide an evidence base for\napplying these services to at-risk populations. At present,\nspiritual care constitutes a complementary and alternative\nmedicine modality (Barrett et al., 2003). However, no studies\nor clinical trials have taken place to assess the clinical useful-\nness or applicability of spiritual care as part of suicide pre-\nvention efforts. Of note is that chaplaincy services are rarely\nprovided as a stand-alone service, but rather as part of an\ninterdisciplinary team. Most individuals who seek pastoral\ncare support will also access clinical providers specially\ntrained to formally diagnose and treat mental health disor-\nders (Schindler, Berren, Hannah, Beigel, & Santiago, 1987).\nHealth care professionals are becoming increasingly\nmindful of religious sensitivities among their patients, the\nsalutary benefits associated with religion and spirituality,\nthat most Americans and clinicians hold some type of reli-\ngious beliefs, and the influence of such beliefs on the lives of\nthose who espouse them (Budd, 1999). As these professional\ngroups look to be more attentive to the needs of the at-risk\nVeterans under their care, they should remain mindful that\nsome of the complaints voiced by at-risk Veterans may be\nindicative of a need for religious and/or spiritual support\n(Kopacz, Silver, & Bossarte, 2014). To this end, in collabora-\ntion with other health care providers, clinical chaplains are\nable to offer an added degree of support to at-risk Veterans in\ntimes of distress and crisis.\nAuthors' Note\nThe findings, conclusions, and opinions expressed in this work are\nthose of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs nor should they be construed as\nthe official position of the U.S. Government.\n"
