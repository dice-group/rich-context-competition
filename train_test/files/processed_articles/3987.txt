    "abstract": "Abstract\nTheorists have long noted the nebulousness of dyadic rapport and its nonverbal correlates. In response to Tickle-Degnen's\ncall for a more theoretically complete analysis of the rapport construct, we empirically evaluated her adaptation of\nCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi's optimal experience model with the hope of better conceptualizing rapport's behavioral manifestations.\nDyads (N\ndyad\n= 50) engaged in two interdependent tasks and completed a battery of post-task measures gauging their mood\nand experiences of rapport. To complement self-report measures, we coded rapport-based behavior using both subjective\n(thin-slice judgments) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis) methodologies. According to Tickle-Degnen's model, dyadic\nexchanges with moderate levels of expressivity and interpersonal coordination should yield the highest levels of rapport.\nAlthough data from our objective coding did not trend in this manner, subjective measurements of coordinated expressivity\nmatched the paradigm's prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically support Tickle-Degnen's hypothesis\nand a novel step toward clarifying the rapport construct.\n",

Although researchers\nhave already isolated rapport into three, interrelated compo-\nnents--mutual attentiveness, positivity, and behavioral coor-\ndination (Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1990)--those\ncomponents do not always generate or signal rapport\ncomponents observed in distinctly low-rapport circum-\nways in which they correlate with rapport seem to vary\nContinued work is thus needed to clarify the relationship\nbetween rapport and its behavioral correlates. Recognizing\nthis need, Tickle-Degnen (2006) cited the optimal experi-\nence model of flow theory (Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi, 1990;\nCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi & LeFevre, 1989) as relevant to a more\ntheoretically cogent examination of rapport. In this model,\nCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi (1990) originally proposed that a person is\nmost likely to experience \"flow\" when a task is moderately\ndifficult. If a person finds the task too easy or too challeng-\ning, suboptimal experiences result. Tickle-Degnen (2006)\nconceptualized rapport, like flow, as a kind of optimal expe-\nrience. As such, she theorized that rapport and its behavioral\ncorrelates could similarly fit into an optimal experience\nmodel, where moderate (i.e., \"optimal\") levels of behavior\nwould be indicative of high dyadic rapport.\nThe current study furthers Tickle-Degnen's work by\nempirically evaluating her published model. Specifically, we\nexamined the relationship between rapport and two of its\nbehavioral correlates--namely, nonverbal expressivity and\ncoordination--during dyadic interactions. Ultimately, empir-\nically evaluating Tickle-Degnen's (2006) optimal experience\nmodel may be a crucial first step in distinguishing the \"some-\nizes the rapport construct.\nDyadic Rapport as Affect and Action\nTo begin, a two-component conceptualization of dyadic rap-\nport--one that couples affect with behavior--is most relevant\nto our analysis. Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal's (1990) three-\ncomponent model of rapport classically recognized its affective\n1University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA\n2Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, WA, USA\n3University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland\nCorresponding Author:\nAndrew A.

Indeed, to understand rapport as affect alone\nis to overlook how it is established, built, and maintained.\nIn fact, various dual-system models--including Patterson's\nperception-action system, and Tickle-Degnen's (2006) signal\u00ad\nperception\u00adaction\u00adsignal loop--suggest a link between\ndyadic action and social perception. Behavioral coordination\nduring a dyadic interaction elicits shared perceptions between\ninteractants (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), and more generally,\nnonverbal signaling works to convey information between an\nactor and a perceiver (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Thus, dyadic\naction is intrinsic to the formation and maintenance of rapport,\nas it creates a bidirectional expressway for information sharing\nand rapport development (Dijksterhuis & Bargh, 2001; Grahe\nNonverbal Expressivity as the\nGroundwork of Interpersonal Behavior\nThis dyadic action can be fundamentally understood as non-\nverbal expressivity, which refers to the clarity by which an\nindividual nonverbally communicates his or her emotions\n(Boone & Buck, 2003). Expressivity requires \"expressive-\nness,\" which more generally refers to the behavioral activity\nused to convey an affective state. Tickle-Degnen (2006)\nasserts that such activity is integral to dyadic rapport devel-\nopment. Expressiveness allows for the communication of\nemotions and attitudes from an actor to a perceiver, and in\nturn, the perceiver possesses more information from which\nto reciprocate appropriately and build rapport.\nMuch research concludes that the nonverbal expression of\nemotion remains a crucial ingredient in dyadic interactions.\nExpressivity is positively associated with ratings of relational\nquality and rapport (Fridlund & Russell, 2006; Grahe &\nstudies have even experimentally suppressed participants'\ncapacity for expressivity. Butler and colleagues (2003; Butler,\nLee, & Gross, 2007) discovered that directing dyad members\nto restrain their nonverbal behavior led to negative perceptions\nof the interaction. Although the social importance of expres-\nsivity may vary across cultures (e.g., Butler et al., 2007), it\ndoes seem to be a critical variable in the rapport equation.\nInterpersonal Coordination and\nRapport Development\nTheory and research further suggest that the coordination of\nnonverbal action is important for rapport development. In fact,\nTickle-Degnen (2006) asserts that expressivity is the \"raw\naction material\" required for coordination (p. 387). Said dif-\nferently, when there is no expressivity during an interaction,\nthere is no behavior available for coordination. Coordination\ncan refer to both behavior matching and interactional syn-\nchrony (Burgoon, Stern, & Dillman, 1995; Grammer, Kruck,\n& Magnusson, 1998). Behavior-matching is the nearly simul-\ntaneous mirroring of gestures, facial expressions, or other\nbehaviors between dyad members (Tickle-Degnen, 2006).\nInteractional synchrony occurs on a global level, as when\ndyads interact with a certain rhythm or smoothness (Bernieri\nEvidence at both the behavioral and affective levels sup-\nports coordination's relevance to positive social outcomes,\nincluding rapport (Cappella & Schreiber, 2006). Emotional\ncontagion or \"yoking\" represents a good example of affec-\ntive coordination (Cappella & Schreiber, 2006; Hatfield,\nCacioppo, & Rapson, 1993), as proximate individuals some-\ntimes synchronize their own moods and emotions to reflect\nanother's emotional state. At the behavioral level, some sug-\ngest that synchrony and posture mimicry might contribute to\nthis kind of emotional convergence (Hatfield et al., 1993).\nSuch an explanation makes sense when noting that interac-\ntional synchrony is recognized by both observers (Bernieri\nas a characteristic of high-rapport interactions. Humans may\neven have an innate preference for synchronized interaction\n1990), suggesting that behavioral coordination is also inte-\ngral to establishing and maintaining rapport.\nDyadic Rapport Within the Optimal\nExperience Model\nTickle-Degnen (2006) argued that dyadic rapport--in both\nits affective and behavioral nature--represents an optimal\nexperiencesimilartoakindof\"flowstate\"(Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi,\n1990). An individual enters \"flow\" when she or he becomes\nunconditionally absorbed by a task at hand. While in flow, a\nperson's anxieties often diminish and a feeling of ease results.\nA body of research suggests that individuals are most likely\nto enter flow when they engage in an activity with a diffi-\nculty that matches their skill level within that domain. If they\nparticipate in a task that is either too difficult or too easy for\ntheir perceived skill level, suboptimal consequences such as\nanxiety or boredom can emerge (Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi, 1990;\nCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi & LeFevre, 1989; Mesurado & Richaud de\nwasfirstidentifiedbyNakamura(1988),andCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\n(1990) later integrated this phenomenon into his optimal\nexperience theory.\nTickle-Degnen (2006) believed that a similar kind of opti-\nmal balance is also pertinent to the rapport ecosystem. She\nNelson et al. 3\nreworked optimal experience theory into a model that\nextended its relevance to interpersonal behavior patterns dur-\ning rapport development. According to Tickle-Degnen's\n(2006) model, optimal experiences are those where dyads\nfeel and act in calm, yet attentive ways; suboptimal experi-\nences foster overactive or underactive levels of action and\naffect (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). More specifically, when an\nactor's expressivity is overactive, information is lost between\nan actor and a perceiver. When expressivity is underactive,\nthere is a shortage of nonverbal information passed between\npartners. Frantic behavior also makes coordination between\ndyad members more challenging, and conversely, a lack of\nbehavior means that there is less behavior to coordinate.\nHence, moderate levels of expressivity should promote the\nmost rapport development.\nSome research supports this postulation. Boone and Buck\n(2003) discovered that especially high levels of expressivity\nhindered the formation of trust in unacquainted dyads. They\nalso concluded that expressivity necessitates a moderate\ndegree of expressiveness (Boone & Buck, 2003). In addition,\na longitudinal examination of practitioner\u00adclient interactions\nfound that an intermediate--as opposed to high--frequency\nof attentive or positive behavior was linked to the most favor-\nable rapport ratings (Tickle-Degnen & Gavett, 2003). The\nrelationship between expressivity and rapport levels could\nthus be a nonlinear one, where chaotic (overactive) or sub-\ndued (underactive) action yields the lowest rapport because it\ndisrupts the patterned responsiveness of interactions.\nInterpersonal coordination may also behave in a similar way.\nWhen coordination is gauged on a looseness-to-tightness\nmoderate levels should be most conducive to rapport-building.\nIndeed, research validates this relationship between moderate\ncoordination and more positive interactional outcomes\n(Cappella, 1996; Jaffe, Beatrice, Stanley, Crown, & Jasnow,\nThe Current Study\nThe current study extends this prior work by empirically\nevaluating Tickle-Degnen's optimal experience model.\nUsing a subset of data (Study 2; Nelson, Grahe, Ramseyer, &\nSerier, 2014) published in a public data repository, we exam-\nined associations between dyads' sensations of rapport and\ntheir displays of expressivity/coordination across two inter-\ndependent tasks. In addition, research assistants coded all the\nnonverbal behavior present in these dyadic interaction using\nboth subjective (thin-slice judgments; Ambady & Rosenthal,\n1992) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis [MEA];\nthe resulting data span multiple modes of analysis. Tickle-\nDegnen's model suggests that dyadic exchanges with moder-\nate or \"optimal\" levels of expressivity and coordination\nshould be associated with the highest sensations of rapport.\nAs such, we hypothesized that this pattern would arise in our\ndata, and we further anticipated that it would be supported\nacross both subjective and objective coding.\nMethod\nProtocol/Data History\nThe data in question were first collected in response to a pro-\nposal submitted to an undergraduate research initiative\n(Collective Undergraduate Research Project; Grahe, 2010).\nIn the fall of 2011, Dr. Fabian Ramseyer (e.g., Ramseyer &\nHorowitz, 2010) shared a collection of materials and proce-\ndural information with this research initiative. His proposal\noutlined a methodological replication of Ramseyer and\nHorowitz (2010) that would further investigate the nature of\nbehavioral synchrony during cooperative interactions. Since\nhis submission, several student teams have conducted con-\nceptual replications of this design while also including novel\nmanipulations of their own. A copy of this base protocol is\nshared on our Open Science Framework (OSF) project page\n(https://osf.io/bn3th/wiki/home/), as are PDF copies of both\npre-task (https://osf.io/76rt9/) and post-task (https://osf.io/\nb8agm/) questionnaires. The resulting data have also been\nmade publicly available via the Journal of Open Psychology\nThe current study is one such extension from this base\nprotocol. As a result, not all employed measures are pertinent\nto the present research question, so we only detail those rel-\nevant to our optimal experience hypothesis. Those interested\nin the full battery of measures may visit our OSF project\npage.\nParticipants\nUndergraduate students (N\ndyad\n= 50) from a small, liberal arts\nuniversity in the Pacific Northwest region of the United\nStates enrolled in this study. Dropout tendencies and univer-\nsity demographics contributed to an imbalanced number of\nparticipants across the different dyad makeup conditions;\nspecifically, we tested more female\u00adfemale pairings (n = 27)\nthan male\u00admale (n = 10) and mixed-sex dyads (n = 13). Due\nto the relatively small student population of the university,\nresearchers accounted for possible familiarity between par-\nticipants by using two self-report questions. We treated all\nparticipants according to APA ethical guidelines.\nProcedure\nTo assign a task order to each dyad, we generated a list of\nrandomized numbers where each value corresponded to a\ngiven task sequence. According to this randomization proce-\ndure, 28 dyads were assigned a menu task first, whereas 22\ndyads were assigned a close-calls task first. Participants\nentered the lab upon arrival and chose which side of the table\nto sit on; thereafter, participants could not switch their\n4 SAGE Open\nseating arrangements. After reviewing informed consent and\nvideo consent forms, participants turned to the nearby com-\nputers and completed pre-task assessments while the\nresearcher remained in the room. Upon completion, we again\nasked participants to sit at the central table. An experimenter\nthen read one of the two dyadic task prompts aloud, answer-\ning any questions accordingly. Afterward, the experimenter\nturned on a video camera and began a stopwatch before leav-\ning the room. Following the 6-min task, participants returned\nto their separate computers and answered the posttest mea-\nsures. Researchers repeated these procedures (excluding the\ninitial pretest) for the second of the two dyadic tasks.\nMaterials\nPre-task measures. Prior to their first dyadic interaction, par-\nticipants completed a battery of personality measures.\nInterpersonal difficulties. We used the short-form Inventory\nof Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32; Horowitz, Alden, Wig-\nbehavior in which participants rate how much certain social\nproblems affect them (e.g., \"It is hard for me to socialize with\nother people\"). Ratings were made on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Because\nwe did not have any hypotheses specific to the eight IIP sub-\nscales (i.e., Domineering, Vindictive, Cold, Socially Inhib-\nited, Nonassertive, Overly Accommodating, Self-sacrificing,\nIntrusive), we computed a mean score of interpersonal dif-\nficulties across the full 32 items ( = .84).\nEmpathy. Next, we used a modified version of the Inter-\npersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980) to assess par-\nticipants' levels of empathy. Specifically, we retained three\nof the original four IRI subscales, which allowed us to mea-\nsure empathetic concern (e.g., \"I am often quite touched by\nthings I see happen\"), perspective taking (e.g., \"I try to look\nat everyone's side of a disagreement before I make a deci-\nsion\"), and fantasy (\"After seeing a play or a movie, I have\nfelt as though I were one of the characters\"). Answers ranged\non a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (does not describe me\nwell) to 5 (describes me very well). Again, we compiled all\nitems into a single empathy construct, yielding a mean empa-\nthy score for each participant ( = .86).\nDyadic tasks.In accordance with Ramseyer's proposal,\nresearchers used both a dyadic \"menu task\" and a \"close\ncalls\" experience (adapted from Chovil, 1991) as opportuni-\nties for rapport-building. Beginning with the former, the\nmenu task asked participants to create an imaginary five-\ncourse dinner menu comprised of foods they both disliked.\nThe task was entirely verbal, so participants did not create\nhard copies of their agreed-upon menu. In the \"close calls\"\nprompt, researchers instructed each member of the dyad to\ndisclose past \"near-miss\" or potentially dangerous situations\nthat they had either experienced themselves or heard about\nfrom peers. Dyads had 6 min to complete each task, and we\ndid not predict outcomes to differ across the tasks. For com-\nplete copies of these prompts (Interactions 1 and 2), see our\nOSF page (https://osf.io/a6kis/).\nInteractant familiarity. We did assess the extent to which each\ndyad member might know his or her partner. Specifically,\nparticipants reported how long they had known their partner\non a Likert-type scale from 1 (we've not known each other\nbefore) to 6 (for more than 3 years). They also reported how\nwell they knew their partner on a Likert-type scale from 1\n(first time I've seen him or her) to 6 (we are close friends).\nPost-task measures.After each task, both participants com-\npleted a battery of measures related to the preceding\ninteraction.\nInterpersonal closeness.We used the Inclusion of Others in\nSelf (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992) pictorial-based measure\nto gauge perceptions of interpersonal closeness between inter-\nactants. By using a series of inter-lapping circles to represent\ndifferent levels of \"closeness,\" this measure instructed partici-\npants to choose the set of circles that \"best describes their rela-\ntionship.\" Participants responded on a scale from 1 (no overlap\nbetween the circles) to 9 (nearly complete overlap of the cir-\ncles), with higher levels of overlap designating more closeness.\nMood. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS;\nWatson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) asked participants to recall\nthe degree to which they encountered certain moods (for\ninstance, feeling \"interested\" or \"hostile\") during the preced-\ning interaction ( = .89). Answers ranged on a Likert-type\nscale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with higher scores\nindicating more positive moods.\nRapport. We used the Post-Interaction/Rapport Question-\nnaire (IRQ; Bernieri, Davis, Rosenthal, & Knee, 1994) as\nour primary gauge of dyadic rapport during each interac-\ntion. This measure asked participants to rate the presence of\ncertain rapport-based characteristics during the preceding\ntask ( = .95). Participants rated their experience based on\n18 different qualifiers (e.g., \"coordination\" or \"intensity\"),\nanswering on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all)\nto 9 (extremely).\nBehavioral Coding\nWe assessed displays of interpersonal behavior during each\ndyadic interaction using both subjective (i.e., thin-slice cod-\ning) and objective (i.e., MEA) methodologies. We provide an\noverview of both methodologies below.\nThin-slice coding.The behavioral cues present during interper-\nsonal exchanges exist on objective and subjective levels (Grahe\nNelson et al. 5\n& Bernieri, 2002). Objective cues consist of quantifiable\nactions determined by time (for example, the duration of eye\ncontact between interactants) or quantity (the number of smiles\nmade by each of them). In contrast, subjective cues require the\nobserver to speculate about an actor's or dyad's psychological\nstate. Even so, such speculation is often derived from objective\nbehavior, as when a friend makes inferences about a couple's\nrapport based on concrete instances of smiling and touch.\nBased on these cues, humans intuitively make judgments\nabout interactions and their outcomes (Ambady, 2010;\nDePaulo & Friedman, 1998). Research consistently finds\nobserver judgments to be accurate and in line with interac-\ntants' own perceptions of an interaction (e.g., Ambady &\nRosenthal, 1992). Moreover, quick judgments of interper-\nsonal behavior--even when made at random times during an\ninteraction--are no less accurate than longer judgments\n(Ambady, Bernieri, & Richeson, 2000;Ambady & Rosenthal,\n1992). These so-called \"thin-slice\" judgments, operationally\nunderstood as impressions formed after 5 min or less, are reli-\nable across contexts (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). In some\ncases, these thin-slice judgments are even more accurate than\nthose made after a longer period of time (Patterson &\nStockbridge, 1998).Accordingly, we isolated 30-s slices from\neach videotaped interaction for our coding purposes. To\nreduce the risk of sampling artifact and potential bias, experi-\nmenters selected the first 30 s from the second minute of each\ninteraction for coding purposes.\nThree research assistants unaware of study hypotheses\nthen coded each selection. Before coding began, these coders\nattended multiple training sessions held by the second author,\nand during each session, they practiced using a coding\nscheme specifically created for the purposes of this study\n(see the appendix). Notably, our coding scheme focused on\nthe primary behavioral correlates of rapport as noted by\nTickle-Degnen (2006), and the scheme used language\ndirectly taken from her optimal experience model. Overall,\nratings were made on a 7-point Likert-type scale. A centered\n\"0\" value represented optimal experience, and each pole of\nthe scale (\"-3\" on one side and \"+3\" on the other) repre-\nsented the extremes of suboptimal experience.\nIn particular, coders used this scale to assess behavioral\ndisplays of \"Activity/Expressivity\" and \"Coordination/\nSynchrony.\" Activity/Expressivity is the \"raw behavioral\nmaterial\" necessary for the development of interpersonal\nmal interactions, interactants can feel \"bored\" or \"anxious,\"\nand their expressivity reflects these feelings; when interac-\ntants are engaged in an optimal experience, however, they\ndemonstrate \"calm and energized\" action (Tickle-Degnen,\n2006). We used these same characterizations of suboptimal\nand optimal expressivity in our own coding scheme (see the\nappendix). Based on this scheme, coders rated the Activity/\nExpressivity of each dyad member separately, and these\nscores were averaged to yield a single Activity/Expressivity\nscore for each dyad.\nWe also borrowed Tickle-Degnen's (2006) conceptualiza-\ntion of suboptimal and optimal coordination for our coding\nscheme. Coordination/Synchrony referred to how harmoni-\nous or in sync the dyad appeared while interacting.\nSuboptimal coordination was characterized by an \"empti-\nness\" of behavior at one pole and as \"disordered\" behavior at\nthe other pole; smooth, synchronous displays denoted opti-\nmal experience (Tickle-Degnen, 2006). Because group judg-\nments are often more reliable than single-coder assessments\n(Ambady et al., 2000), each coder separately evaluated all of\nthe interactions for Activity/Expressivity as well as\nCoordination/Synchrony. Inter-rater reliability scores sug-\ngested consistent coding for both Activity/Expressivity ( =\n.93) and Coordination/Synchrony ( = .72) variables.\nMotion Energy Analysis. Subjective evaluations of movement,\nhowever, may be confounded by the observer's inability to\nseparate judgments of synchrony alone from gestalt percep-\ntions of rapport-building. In consequence, technological\nadvancements now allow for more objective techniques of\nsynchrony measurement that can gauge interpersonal motion\nexclusively. Grammer, Honda, Juette, and Schmitt (1999)\nfirst began using automatic movie analysis (AMA) to exam-\nine nonverbal courtship behavior as a way to clarify the\n\"fuzziness\" of interactional movement. AMA reads digitized\nvideo footage of a given interaction. This video footage is\nrecorded with a completely static camera in front of a stable\nbackground with stable light conditions. Motion energy is\nthen detected by subtracting the image of one video frame\nfrom the previous frame. The amount of change (i.e., the\nframe-difference) serves as a quantifiable indicator of move-\nment. These differences paint a singular, overall picture of\nmotion across any given amount of time. Not only is the pro-\ncess less subjective than manual video-coding, but it is both\nefficient and highly reliable (Grammer et al., 1999).\nWe used a similar program--MEA (Ramseyer, 2016;\nRamseyer & Tschacher, 2011)--to objectively evaluate syn-\nchronous behavior during each dyadic task. Like AMA, MEA\nis based on the frame-differencing method. In frame differ-\nencing, pixels from digital videos are converted into their\ngrayscale format, ranging from 0 (true black) to 255 (true\nwhite). Pixel hue changes between two subsequent video\nframes, which are caused by a participant's movement, are\nthen calculated and conceptualized as motion energy (ME;\nKupper, Ramseyer, Hoffmann, Kalbermatten, & Tschacher,\n2010). These calculations of ME are bounded by pre-deter-\nmined \"maps\" or drawn-out regions of a participant's body. In\nother words, if near-simultaneous motion is detected in adja-\ncent regions (for example, an upper body region) for both\ndyad members, it is conceptualized as synchronous move-\nment. Because ME calculations are bounded by these regions,\nshared movement does not need to occur between the same\nbody parts across interactants (e.g., each person's right arm)\nto register as synchrony. Furthermore, because MEA algo-\nrithm reacts to pixel alterations, only the dynamic aspects of\n6 SAGE Open\nmovement are assessed. Thus, dyadic posture sharing or\n\"static\" synchrony is not evaluated using this technique. For a\ncomprehensive overview of the MEA technique, we direct\nreaders to Ramseyer and Tschacher (2011).\nIn the current study, we isolated our analyses to the upper\nbody region of each interactant, which extended from their\nwaist to the top of their head. Although it is theoretically pos-\nsible to do more acute analyses, smaller \"maps\" are prone to\nconflation from stray movements from other body parts\n(Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2014). In addition, because MEA\nmaps are static and drawn over the video footage after it is\nrecorded, body parts (e.g., a head) can easily cross the bound-\naries of smaller maps due to participant movement. Although\nwe did use specific lower body and head maps, this upper\nbody region constituted the largest MEA map and the most\nreliable area for analysis.\nTime series of raw movement quantification from MEA\nwas then used to compute lagged cross-correlations of upper\nbody ME between partners. These cross-correlations repre-\nsent the degree of covariation of ME across partners.\nBecause of the non-stationarity of movement behavior,\ncross-correlations are calculated in separate windows of\n30 s. Each window provides a variety of cross-correlations\nbetween the upper body regions of both partners for different\ntime lags. Instantaneous (or \"zero-lagged\") synchrony is rep-\nresented by ME changes that occur across the same subse-\nquent frames for both partners. However, because synchrony\ncan also be directional (with one partner leading the move-\nment and the other partner following), the cross-correlations\nare shifted in time to also detect synchrony that occurs with\na short time delay (or \"lag\"). We allowed for lags of up to 5\ns. Accordingly, if one partner's ME is matched by the other\npartner within this 5-s allowance, it also registers as syn-\nchrony. Because analyses were completed at a frame rate of\n10 frames/per second, this allows for the calculation of 50\nnegative-lagged correlations (0 to -5 s), 50 positive-lagged\ncorrelations (0 to +5 s), and one zero-lagged correlation for\neach 30-s window. These multiple cross-correlations were\nthen standardized using Fisher's Z, and their absolute values\nwere averaged to yield a single synchrony score for each\ndyad. This global synchrony score served as our objective\nmeasure of nonverbal synchrony across each interaction.\nResults\nData Preparation\nAlthough our protocol yielded a robust assortment of data, the\nscope of this article only allowed for analyses pertinent to\nTickle-Degnen's model. In accordance with Kenny and col-\nleagues' (2006) principle of dyad nonindependence, we aver-\naged interactant rapport ratings (as measured by the IRQ) into\nmean dyad scores; likewise, evaluations of interpersonal\nbehavior were collapsed into dyadic averages. Because sub-\noptimal behavior represented both positive and negative\nratings in our coding scheme, researchers squared all scores\nand thus translated the scale into a linear format; scores now\nranged from 0 to 9. Although we could have also linearized\nscores by taking their absolute value, doing so would have\nundervalued ratings of suboptimal experiences. Instead, we\nsquared these values to increase variability and to emphasize\nthese suboptimal encounters. To also prevent future misinter-\npretation of correlational analyses, we reversed the scale's\ndirection so that higher values represented more optimal\naction. We then averaged evaluations of both behavioral mea-\nsures across the three coders, resulting in a single \"Activity\"\nand \"Coordination\" score for each interaction. In addition,\nbecause \"Activity\" and \"Coordination\" ratings were highly\nboth variables and create an aggregate measure of coordi-\nnated expressivity. Further commentary on the lack of dis-\ncriminate validity between \"Activity\" and \"Coordination\"\nratings is available in the \"Discussion\" section.\nResearchers also conducted a series of control analyses to\nhelp identify potential confounds. A series of t tests revealed\nno differences in our dependent variables between the menu\ntask and close-calls task; similarly, task sequence had no\neffect on these same dependent variables (e.g., all tests had a\np > .05). As such, we averaged all dependent variables across\nboth tasks to yield a single set of scores for each dyad. After\ncollapsing across tasks, we predictably discovered that indi-\nvidual scores on all dependent variables were positively cor-\nrelated between dyad members (e.g., all tests had a p < .05).\nTests of the Optimal Experience Model\nResearchers used a Pearson correlation matrix to evaluate the\nassociation between our dependent measures and behavioral\ndata (see Table 1, which also includes means and standard\ndeviations for these variables). First, with regard to objective\nsynchrony, MEA-generated scores did not share any signifi-\ncant association with self-reported rapport levels. This finding\nruns counter to our hypothesis. The only significant relation-\nship between objective synchrony displays and all posttest\nmeasures occurred with feelings of interpersonal closeness,\nreported higher levels of closeness. Data resulting from our\ncoders' thin-slice judgments, however, did support Tickle-\nDegnen's predictions. We discovered a strong positive rela-\ntionship between dyadic rapport and our composite measure\nof coordinated expressivity approached optimal levels, dyads'\nself-reported experience of rapport also increased.\nIn addition, we conducted a hierarchical linear regression\nto see whether this relationship retained significance after\naccounting for the variance explained by other study vari-\nables. Our model consisted of four steps, with dyadic rap-\nport (as measured by the IRQ) entered as our dependent\nvariable. In Step 1, we included our pre-task measures of\ninterpersonal difficulties (as measured by the IIP) and\nNelson et al. 7\nempathy (as measured by the IRI). In Step 2, we added both\nmeasures of partner familiarity. In Step 3, we included post-\ntask measures of interpersonal closeness (as measured by the\nIOS) and mood (as measured by the PANAS). In our final\nstep, we included MEA-gnereated synchrony and subjective\nratings of coordinated expressivity. Please see Table 2 for a\ndepiction of this model and associated results.\nThe final model reached significance and explained a large\np < .001. After accounting for the other variables, coordinated\nexpressivity still emerged as a significant predictor of dyadic\nrapport, b = .16, p < .001. Moreover, this final step explained\nan additional 12% of the variance in rapport levels primarily\ndue to the coordinated expressivity variable, R2 = .12, F(2,\nfurther supported our hypothesis.\nDiscussion\nThis investigation empirically evaluates Tickle-Degnen's\n(2006) adapted optimal experience model, which uniquely\nextends Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi's (1990) original framework to the\nrapport ecosystem. Her model acknowledges that rapport\ndevelopment depends on the nature--and not simply the\npresence--of particular behavioral displays. Moreover, it\nrecognizes that the association between coordinated expres-\nsivity and dyadic rapport might be a nonlinear one. Analyses\ninvolving the subjective judgments of interpersonal behavior\nsuggest that as an interaction becomes plagued by lethargic\nor disorderly (i.e., suboptimal) behavior, a decrement in rap-\nport levels is also observed. Conversely, interactions marked\nby coordinated, well-balanced (i.e., optimal) behavior are\nassociated with higher rapport ratings. Objective measure-\nments of behavioral coordination did not, however, demon-\nstrate this pattern.\nIndeed, only the subjectively coded behavior of our dyads\nsupported our hypotheses, and this qualification warrants fur-\nther discussion. One possible reason for this discrepancy\nbetween objective and subjective measures is already known:\nMEA-calculated synchrony and subjectively coded coordina-\ntion are theoretically distinct measurements. Not only did our\nTable 1. Correlation Matrix of Outcome Measures.\nNote. Variables represent scores averaged across both dyadic tasks.\nTable 2.

Variables represent scores averaged across both dyadic tasks.\n8 SAGE Open\npast literature has operationalized these constructs differently.\nBecause MEA relies on frame differencing to detect synchro-\nnous behavior, Ramseyer and Tschacher (2011) concede that\nits output is limited to evaluations of dynamic synchrony;\nstatic coordination, as in the mirroring of specific postures or\ngestures, is thus overlooked. In contrast, coders' ratings of\ninterpersonal coordination provided a more holistic measure\nof synchrony, as they plainly coded how coordinated the\ndyads appeared. Whereas MEA is microanalytical in scope\nand thereby generates synchrony scores piecemeal (Bernieri\n& Rosenthal, 1991), thin-slice judgments encompass both\nposture mimicry and displays of coordinated movement.\nA second but related explanation for conflicting results\ncould be due to the gestalt nature of coordination itself. Most\nbasically, MEA is a measure of movement dynamics. It has\nthe capacity to measure the amount, duration, speed, and\ncomplexity of movements between people. Microanalytical\nmeasures such as MEA do not, however, capture all channels\nof communication in the behavior stream (Delaherche et al.,\n2012), and thus, its scope is limited. MEA cannot account for\nany psychological content beyond what is communicated by\ngross body movements, and our current setup yielded low-\nresolution videos where more psychologically informative\nmotion (i.e., facial expressions) could not be assessed.\nAlternatively, accurate observer judgments appear to be intui-\ntive (Ambady, 2010) and a product of human development\n(DePaulo & Friedman, 1998), suggesting that computerized\nmeasures might not yet be capable of reliably reproducing the\nhuman evaluation process. It could also explain why the thin-\nslice judgment method is considered the \"gestalt approach\" in\nrelevant literature (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991). MEA's\nobjective nature means it has the ability to record pure motion\nuntainted by accompanying psychological information.\nNevertheless, with this objectivity comes a rigidity that--\nunlike human judgments--might fail to capture both behav-\nior and affect. Furthermore, it is possible that our measure of\nrapport, which was based on the averages of dyads' self-\nreports, may reduce the association between affect and syn-\nchrony previously found in a larger sample based on\ncomparable dyads (Tschacher, Rees, & Ramseyer, 2014).\nAlso, the apparent lack of discriminant validity between\n\"Activity/Expressivity\" and \"Coordination/Synchrony\" rat-\nings deserves further mention. A distinction between both\nvariables is evident at the positive pole of the coding scheme\n(i.e., the positive extreme of the Activity/Expressivity spec-\ntrum represents frenzied movement, and in turn, disharmoni-\nous displays of frenzied movement on the Coordination/\nSynchrony spectrum) but not at the negative one. Coders\nmay have interpreted \"bored\" interpersonal activity as an\nemptiness of activity; however, this emptiness should have\nbeen marked as suboptimal coordination. In this way, coders\nstill gauged coordination on a looseness-to-tightness scale\n(Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991); however, their judgments per-\ntain more to the organization and intensity of the movement\nthan to its synchronicity.\nFinally, we acknowledge that our composite measure of\ncoordinated expressivity may appear to approximate Tickle-\nDegnen and Rosenthal's (1990) component of dyadic posi-\ntivity. We cite three pieces of evidence to differentiate our\nmeasure of coordinated expressivity from positivity. First,\nour task prompts were not designed to foster positive affect\nbetween dyad members; in fact, these prompts were deliber-\nately meant to elicit challenges for the dyad. For example,\nthe menu task forced dyads to brainstorm foods that they\nboth disliked, which presumably led to some disagreements.\nFurthermore, the close-calls task asked participant to recall\nanxiety-inducing events from their lives. Second, we did not\nfind a significant correlation between PANAS scores and rat-\nings of coordinated expressivity. If coordinated expressivity\nwas simply a proxy for feelings of positivity, we would\nexpect a strong positive correlation between these variables.\nAnd third, although we acknowledge that coders may have\nbeen unable to separate their assessments of behavior from\naffect, they were instructed to focus on behavior exclusively\nwhen viewing the interactions.\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first data-based validation of\nTickle-Degnen's model.Although these conclusions may fall\nshort of clearing the murkiness surrounding rapport and its\nnonverbal indicators, they are still in conversation with\nTickle-Degnen's call for the construct's reconceptualization.\nIdentifying rapport as optimal experience, however, demands\nthat future work explores the association between rapport's\naffective nature and behavioral elements within different\ncontexts (e.g., task demands, environment of interaction,\nand/or presence of distractors).\nReclassifying rapport as optimal experience also\nalludes to the potential overlap between rapport and flow\nstates. Although both constructs remain theoretically dis-\ntinct, this overlap is significant in that it urges develop-\nments associated with one state to inform the other. For\nexample, Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi's (1990) original understand-\ning of optimal experience maintained that people most\noften reach flow state when managing perceived chal-\nlenges in a domain that they are sufficiently skilled in.\nFuture research could then explore whether active interde-\npendent tasks of an optimal difficulty prime rapport devel-\nopment. Investigations into the behavioral indicators of\nflow could also build upon work exploring rapport's non-\nverbal correlates. In sum, borrowing Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi's\n(1990) model not only strengthens our theoretical grasp\non rapport, but in return, it may lend itself to advance-\nments in flow theory.\nLast, we contend that these recommendations are well\nsuited for data-sharing initiatives, and likewise, that open\nscience platforms provide an ample opportunity for col-\nlaborations committed to refining the rapport construct.\nMany open science projects, such as the Open Science\nNelson et al. 9\nCollaboration's (2015) Reproducibility Project and the\nCollaborative Replications and Education Project (Grahe\net al., 2016), focus on close replications alone. In contrast,\nthis study utilized methodological replication as a means to\nadditionally tackle novel theoretical questions. We invite\ninterested theorists to do the same, using four conceptually\nrelated studies and data sets recently published by Nelson\net al. (2014) in The Journal of Open Psychology Data.\nThese data, as well as a summary of each study, is available\nhere: http://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/article/view/\nWe again encourage potential collaborators to visit our\nproject profile via the OSF (https://osf.io/dyntp/) for further\nstudy information and access to materials. Ultimately, it is\nour hope that future investigations make use of similar ave-\nnues to advance studies of the dyadic experience.\nAppendix\nCoding Scheme Used for Subjective Behavioral Judgments\nBEHAVIOR\nCoordination/Synchrony\nHigh scores represent much behavior, but not \"in sync\".
