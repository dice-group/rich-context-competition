There is little epidemiologic data on the development of disability overtime in older persons. This study\nuses prospective data from cohorts followed annually for 6 to 7 years to identify persons who developed severe disability\nand to characterize the time course of their disabling process and subsequent mortality.\nMethods. Incidence rates of severe disability, defined as need for help in three or more activities of daily living\n(ADLs), were estimated for 6,640 persons who had not reported severe disability at baseline and at the first four annual\nfollow-up visits. Among persons developing severe disability, those who reported no need for help in ADLs in previous\ninterviews were defined as cases of catastrophic disability, and those who had previously reported some disability in\nADLs were defined as cases of progressive disability.\nResults. Overall. 212 subjects developed progressive and 227 developed catastrophic disability. The rates of progressive\ndisability and catastrophic disability were 11.3 and 12.1 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively. For both types of\ndisability, incidence rates increased exponentially with age, but the increase was steeper for progressive disability. At ages\n70-74, less than 25% of severe disability was progressive, while over age 85 progressive disability represented more than\nhalf of severe disability. Incidence rates of total and both types of severe disability were similar in men and women.\nMortality after severe disability onset was extremely high. Survival time was unrelated to age at disability onset and type of\ndisability but was significantly longer in women than in men (median 3.44 vs 2.12 years; p < .0001).\nConclusion. Tracking the development of disability provides new and important insights into the disability experience\nin older men and women that are potentially relevant in planning preventive, intervention, and long-term care strategies.\nALARGE portion of the geriatric literature is dedicated to\nstudies of disability in the older population. Prevalence\n(1,2) and incidence (3-5) rates of disability have been\nreported for large samples representative of the general\npopulation. Many predictors of disability have been iden-\ntified, including demographic characteristics, specific\nchronic conditions, and health behaviors. In most cases,\ndisability has been considered as a simple, static condition,\nwhereas the development of disability as an ongoing, dy-\nnamic process has received little attention (6). For example,\nlittle information is available on gender and age differences\nin the course of disability over time. This is an important\nissue, since length of the disabling process and survival time\nafter developing disability are critical elements in assessing\nthe impact of disability and the need for health and social\nservices in selected subgroups of the population.\nThe most important causes of disability in young to\nmiddle-aged persons are congenital or perinatal conditions,\ntrauma, and acute or rapidly progressive diseases (7). For\nalmost all of these conditions the typical time course of the\ndisabling process is rapid, and is assumed to be a sequela of\nthe underlying cause. Conversely, disability in older age is\noften portrayed as the end stage of a progressive breakdown\nof the homeostatic equilibrium (8,9) that takes place in\npersons affected by multiple diseases (10), although it may\nbe accelerated by acute medical conditions (8,9,11). The\nterm \"frailty,\" which has recently been defined in several\nways (12,13), is an attempt to summarize this complex\ncausal chain in a unique notion (14). However, it is also well\nknown that some older persons become disabled suddenly,\nas a consequence of a catastrophic medical event such as a\nstroke, without showing any previous sign of functional\ndecline. Thus, the time required for severe disability to\ndevelop is quite variable; it likely covers a wide range of\ntimes in the older population, but its distribution is com-\npletely unknown.\nCertain aspects of the time course of disability can be\ninferred from the results of a limited number of studies\n(4,15,16), but the dynamics of the process in itself is not\nwell understood (6); no research has used data on incident\ndisability and change in disability status detected longitudi-\nnally over multiple evaluations to track the entire process.\nThis prospective study uses data from a large, population-\nbased sample of older persons who were assessed annually to\ndescribe the temporal characteristics of the process leading\nto severe disability and to understand how these characteris-\ntics are related to age, gender, and subsequent mortality. We\nhypothesized that rapid disability onset would be more\ncommon in the younger segment of the elderly population\nand would be followed by higher mortality rates than disabil-\nity of the same magnitude but with gradual onset.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThis study uses data from three communities of the Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly\n(EPESE), a longitudinal study of persons age 65 years and\nolder, funded by the Epidemiology, Demography, and Bi-\nometry Program of the National Institute on Aging. The\nEPESE design and data collection methods have been de-\na survey was conducted on the entire elderly population\nliving in East Boston (Massachusetts) and in two Iowa\ncounties, and on a stratified random sample of the New\nHaven (Connecticut) population. More than 10,000 partici-\npants, representing more than 80% of the eligible popula-\ntion, were interviewed. Follow-up data from these cohorts\nwere collected annually by telephone or in-person inter-\nviews. Seven follow-up interviews were conducted in Iowa\nand New Haven. In East Boston the data collection ended\nwith the sixth follow-up interview.\nInformation on level of functional disability was collected\nby self-report in all interviews. Participants were asked if\nthey needed help from another person or were unable to\nperform each of the following activities of daily living\n(ADLs): walking across a small room, bathing, dressing,\neating, transferring from bed to chair, and using the toilet.\nOutcome Measures\nThe first part of the analyses described here focuses on\nincidence of severe disability, and the second part on subse-\nquent mortality. Subjects were defined as severely disabled\nif they reported need for help with or inability to perform\nthree or more ADLs.\nPersons known to be free of severe disability for a period\nof four years were followed for two to three additional years\nto detect incident cases of severe disability. In total, 7,771\nsubjects were found alive and reinterviewed at the fourth\nannual follow-up, the starting point for identifying incident\ncases of severe disability in this study. To define a popula-\ntion at risk for developing severe disability, 513 persons who\nhad reported need for help in three or more ADLs on any\ninterview between baseline and the fourth follow-up were\nexcluded from the analysis. Also excluded were 594 subjects\nin whom, in any interview, the sum of missing responses to\nADL questions plus the number of items for which the\nsubjects reported need for help was three or more. These\nparticipants were not included in the study because severe\ndisability could not be ruled out. Incident cases of severe\ndisability were identified over the next two (East Boston) or\nthree (Iowa and New Haven) follow-up interviews. The first\noccurrence of severe disability was considered in these\nanalyses.\nPersons developing severe disability anytime after the\nfourth follow-up were classified into two groups, according\nto their patterns of responses to ADL questions over time. If\na participant reported no need for help in ADLs in the two\ninterviews prior to the development of severe disability, the\nevent was defined as catastrophic disability. If a participant\nreported any need for help in ADLs in the interview prior to\nthe development of severe disability, the participant was\nclassified as having progressive disability. Twenty-four sub-\njects who had reported disability in one ADL two years\nbefore but no need for help in the interview immediately\nbefore the development of severe disability were excluded\nfrom the analysis. Thus, the population considered in this\nSubjects who developed severe disability were followed\nfor mortality through obituaries, interviews with proxies,\nand the National Death Index, for up to 5.5 years after the\nonset of severe disability.\nData Analysis\nCrude incidence rates of total severe disability, progres-\nsive severe disability, and catastrophic severe disability are\nreported as number of events per 1,000 person-years. In\ncomputing these rates, person-years were calculated as time\nbetween the fourth follow-up interview and the onset of\nsevere disability, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the\nstudy period, whichever came first. Cox proportional haz-\nards regression models were used to estimate relative risks\n(RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association\nof age and gender with the two different types of severe\ndisability. When the event considered was progressive dis-\nability, subjects developing catastrophic disability were cen-\nsored at disability onset. Likewise, in the analysis of cata-\nstrophic disability, subjects with progressive disability were\ncensored. In these analyses, persons were classified in five\ning to their age at the time of the fourth follow-up interview.\nA polychotomous logistic regression model with a three-\nlevel outcome was used to compare the relative risks associ-\nated with age and gender of developing progressive disabil-\nity and catastrophic disability versus no disability.\nIn the survival analysis, which was limited to subjects\nwho had developed severe disability, person-years were\ncalculated as time between the onset of severe disability and\ndeath or the end of 1992, whichever came first. Survivorship\nwas analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and\nCox proportional hazard regression models. In these analy-\nses, type of severe disability (progressive and catastrophic),\nage at the onset of severe disability (<85 vs 2=85), and\ngender were considered as covariates. Time of severe dis-\nability onset was considered as the midpoint between the last\nfollow-up interview free of severe disability and the inter-\nview in which severe disability was first detected. Median\nsurvival time post severe disability onset was estimated\nusing the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.\nAll proportional hazard regression models were\ncommunity-stratified.\nRESULTS\nOf the 6,640 persons who were alive and free of severe\ndisability at the beginning of the observation period, 181,\nand three years later, respectively. Crude incidence rates of\nsevere disability for the total population, according to age and\ngender, and by community, are reported in Table 1. The risk\nof developing severe disability during the three-year observa-\ntion period was similar in both men and women, and progres-\nsively higher in the older age groups. Across the entire age\nrange, each five-year increase in age was associated with\napproximately a doubling of the incidence rate of severe\ndisability. In the three communities, age-specific incidence\nrates of severe disability, stratified by gender, were remark-\nably similar (Figure 1). After adjusting for age, gender and\ncommunity were not significant predictors of incident severe\nIn Table 2, progressive and catastrophic severe disability\nare considered separately as two mutually exclusive out-\ncomes. Over the observation period, 212 subjects developed\nsevere disability after they had reported a lesser degree of\ndisability in the previous years (progressive disability), and\n227 developed severe disability with no previous report of\nany need for help with ADLs (catastrophic disability).\nOverall incidence rates of progressive and catastrophic\nperson-years, respectively; Table 2). An exponential in-\ncrease in these two types of disability was seen with increas-\ning age, with the rate of increase steeper for the progressive\ndisability group. Age-adjusted incidence rates were similar\nin men and women.\nTable 2 shows the results of two proportional hazard\nmodels which assess the relative risk associated with age and\ngender of developing progressive disability vs no disability,\nand catastrophic disability vs no disability. Compared with\nthe reference group (69 to 74 years old), subjects between 75\nand 79 years of age were 1.8 times more likely to develop\nboth progressive and catastrophic disability. After age 80,\nrelative risks for both types of disability increased with\nincreasing age, but the increment in the magnitude of the\nrelative risk at each higher age was larger for progressive\nthan for catastrophic disability.

Women were no more likely than men to develop\neither progressive or catastrophic disability.\nAmong those who developed severe disability, the pro-\nportions with progressive and catastrophic disability are\nshown for age- and sex-specific subgroups in Figure 2. With\nincreasing age, progressive disability comprises a larger\nproportion of the total disability for both men and women.\nTo obtain age-specific relative risks of progressive and\ncatastrophic disability that are directly comparable, we fitted\nthe same data with a single polychotomous logistic regres-\nsion model. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure\n3. The age-associated increases in the relative risks for\nprogressive and catastrophic disability begin to diverge after\ndifference between the two coefficients reached statistical\nsignificance.\nTo examine the relationship between disability type (pro-\ngressive vs catastrophic) and the risk of mortality, we per-\nformed subsequent analyses limited to the 439 participants\nwho developed severe disability.

However, after the first two years, the mortality rate\ndeclined and the survival curve became similar to that of the\nolder women.\nThe independent effects of type of disability, age at onset\nof severe disability, and gender on mortality among the\nseverely disabled were tested using a single Cox propor-\ntional hazard regression model.

Figure 5 shows the age-adjusted survival function\nobtained from this model stratified by gender and type of\ndisability. Both the strong gender effect and the lack of a\n\"type of disability\" effect are clearly evident.\nDISCUSSION\nMost of the literature has approached disability in the\nelderly as a static condition rather than as a dynamic process.\nThis view ignores the fact that, depending on the basic\nunderlying causes and on other personal and environmental\ncofactors, disability may begin abruptly, progress slowly,\nremain stable, and may even diminish over time.

The curves are from a Cox\nproportional hazard model and are age-adjusted.\nit is not clear which factors determine length of survival (18-\n21). The onset and progression of disability, and survivor-\nship with disability, delineate the lifetime course of disabil-\nity. Complex and heterogeneous patterns are encountered in\nthe older population, and treating disability as a simple\noutcome may be misleading.\nIn this study, the time course of disability was constructed\nusing prospective data, and two main periods in the process of\ndisablement were distinguished: development of severe dis-\nability, and survival with severe disability. The time at which\nan older person reported severe disability above a specific\nthreshold was used to identify the point of intersection be-\ntween these two periods. Finally, we made a distinction\nbetween subjects who developed severe disability in less than\none year and subjects who had developed severe disability\nover a longer period, defining their process of disablement as\ncatastrophic and progressive disability, respectively.\nThe percent of subjects who developed severe disability as\na catastrophic event was similar to the percent of subjects\nwho developed severe disability more progressively. Over-\nall, older age was associated with increased risk of both\ntypes of disability. However, confirming our hypothesis, the\ncharacteristics of the disabling process were different at\ndifferent ages. Among persons who developed severe dis-\nability, onset at later ages was more likely to be associated\nwith a longer disabling process, and onset at a younger age\nwas more likely to be associated with freedom from disabil-\nity in ADLs during the previous years. In about 60% of the\ncases aged 85 years and older, development of severe dis-\nability was the final stage of a process of functional decline\nthat had started more than one year before, while in the age\nsevere disability reported any disability in ADLs during the\nprevious year. These results suggest that the development of\nsevere disability follows different pathways in different age\ngroups. A plausible interpretation is that younger persons are\nless likely to show progressive disability because the effect\nof minor pathologic events on functional status is counter-\nbalanced by compensatory strategies which may be physio-\nlogical, behavioral, or social (8). In these persons severe\ndisability is more often the \"catastrophic\" result of a major\nevent (i.e., a stroke), or of an event which causes the\nbreakdown of critical compensatory mechanisms (9). The\nsame sequence of pathologic events that a younger person\ncan compensate for may not be \"counteracted\" by compen-\nsatory mechanisms in very old persons, due to underlying\nfrailty (12-14). Consequently, each event is followed by a\nsignificant change in functional status, and disability de-\nvelops \"progressively,\" step by step. In these subjects the\ndecline in physical function may be very slow, and signs of\nfunctional deterioration may be objectively detectable long\nbefore the development of disability in ADLs (22).\nThe differential characteristics of the developmental\ncourse of disability associated with age may be extremely\nrelevant in designing and targeting effective preventive strat-\negies in different age groups. In vulnerable older people with\nmoderate impairments and disabilities, interventions aimed\nat slowing down the impending decline in function may be\nmore effective than primary prevention, in which traditional\nrisk factors are modified. Indeed, inconsistencies between\nstudies assessing traditional risk factors in the elderly may be\nexplained by the presence in the study population of these\nsubjects (23). In this subset of the older population, decline\nin physical function may act as a strong competing risk\nfactor for multiple outcomes.\nThis study also found that the time course of the disabling\nprocess was remarkably similar in men and women. There\nwere no substantial differences between genders in both the\nage-specific incidence rates of overall severe disability and\nthe proportion of persons who developed progressive and\ncatastrophic disability. This result contrasts with previous\nsuggestions that decline in health status associated with age\nis attributable to different chronic conditions in men and\nwomen. According to this view, progressive and non-life-\nthreatening chronic conditions more frequently affect\nwomen, while men are more likely to develop atheroscler-\notic cardiovascular disease that manifests clinically as acute\nevents such as strokes and myocardial infarctions (24).\nHowever, while morbidity may be different in men and\nwomen, Ettinger and colleagues (25) have recently reported\nthat causes of disability are almost the same in older men and\nwomen.\nOverall, after severe disability onset, mortality rates were\nvery high. More than 80% of those who were followed for at\nleast five years died during this period. Women with severe\ndisability had longer survival than men but, surprisingly, age\nand characteristics of the disablement process were not\nassociated with survivorship. Therefore, this study did not\nconfirm our original hypothesis that the rapid onset of\ndisability would lead to higher mortality than progressive\nonset disability. The findings of similar incidence of severe\ndisability but longer survival of women with severe disabil-\nity are compatible with a large body of evidence showing\nhigher prevalence of disability in women compared to men at\nadditional perspective to the interpretation of this phenome-\nnon because it shows very clearly that older women do not\nspend more years living with disability because it develops\nmore slowly and progressively than in men, but that they\nsurvive longer after the onset of severe disability. This\nhypothesis has been suggested by other investigators (4,28).\nHowever, there were limitations in their ability to assess this\nissue, since they could not estimate time at disability onset\nwith reasonable precision.\nThe observed differences in survival between men and\nwomen with severe disability remain to be explained. It is\nlikely that the underlying causes of disability and the rela-\ntionship between disease severity and disability severity may\nbe different in men and in women. Further research using\nthese cohorts will assess diseases predicting severe disabil-\nity, and disease occurrence and cause of death after the onset\nof severe disability. Further research is also needed to\nevaluate whether men systematically underreport disability\nas compared to women, so that men reporting disability are\nin fact more frail and at higher risk of death.\nThe lack of an effect of age and type of disability on the\nrisk of dying in this group of severely disabled older persons\nis also of scientific interest. It is important to consider that\nthe population at risk in this study included subjects aged 69\nyears and older and that the operational definition of disabil-\nity used here identifies a rather severe state. At this end stage\nof the functional spectrum and in this age group, it is quite\npossible that differences in age and the path by which\nindividuals reached their disability state became relatively\ninconsequential. The prognosis quoad vitam is probably\nmore strongly affected by the direct consequences of the\ndisability itself, such as immobilization, malnutrition, social\nisolation, and others. Considering the lack of an age gradient\nin mortality risk, it is surprising that a differential mortality\naccording to gender is still evident in this group.\nThe high mortality rate in those with disabilities confirms\nthe results of many other studies (18-21). Mortality rates in\npersons with disability in three or more ADLs were compa-\nrable or higher than mortality rates reported for patients with\nsevere medical conditions, such as myocardial infarction,\nstroke, hip fracture, and severe septicemia (29-32). How-\never, it should be pointed out that, even for subjects with\ncatastrophic disability, the comparison of our results with\ndata from the literature may be problematic because of age\ndifferences and because those with severe disability repre-\nsent the most severe of these clinical events.\nThe disappearance of the prognostic effect of age for\nmortality at this severity of disability is a relatively new\nfinding. Other reports have found an association between\nHowever, most of these studies used a less severe definition\nfor disability.\nAn important strength of this study is that it used annually\ncollected data from a prospective study on large representa-\ntive populations of elderly persons followed for up to seven\nyears. It thus avoids recall bias that would be present if the\nonset of disability were assessed retrospectively. The study\ndesign permitted the characterization of functional status for\nfour years prior to its baseline, which allowed for the\nidentification of a large population at risk of incident disabil-\nity. Using subsequent follow-up information on this popula-\ntion, we could identify sufficient cases of incident severe\ndisability to do a meaningful analysis. Furthermore, mortal-\nity data on those persons who developed severe disability\nwere available for up to 5.5 years. We are not aware of any\nother cohort in which these analyses would be possible.\nSpecific limitations directly related to the design of this\nanalysis must be considered. Among those at risk of devel-\noping severe disability, we could not identify persons who\ndeveloped severe disability and died before the next follow-\nup visit. Therefore, both incidence rates of severe disability\nand mortality rates of subjects developing severe disability\nare likely to be underestimated in this study. Since we did\nnot have any information on these subjects, we assumed that\nthey were randomly distributed between those with some\nprevious disability (progressive), and those with no previous\ndisability (catastrophic). Whether and how much this as-\nsumption influenced our results is unknown.\nThere were 543 subjects who were excluded from the\npopulation at risk because the number of missing values in\nthe items assessing disability would not allow severe disabil-\nity to be ruled out. Distribution according to age and gender,\ndisability in ADLs (considering only non-missing items), as\nwell as survivorship after the fourth follow-up were similar\nin this group compared to those in the eligible study popula-\ntion. Thus, we have no specific reason to believe that the\nresults of our study would be different if we included this\ngroup in the study population.\nResults of this study are generalizable only to subjects\naged 69 years or older who develop disability in three or\nmore ADLs over their lifetime. From a public health per-\nspective, this is a very important group of the older popula-\ntion (34-38). In fact, persons with these characteristics\nusually need substantial medical care (35), formal and infor-\nmal care in the community (36,39), and are among the most\nlikely candidates for nursing home admission (40,41).\nIn conclusion, this research offers a new concept by which\nto approach the study of disability. Our understanding of\ndisability in the older population may be substantially en-\nhanced by considering the time course of disability develop-\nment and distinguishing between catastrophic and progres-\nsive disability. Approaches to prevention, therapeutic\noptions, and decisions on the use of long-term care may all\nbe illuminated by considering the dynamic aspects of the\ndevelopment of disability, especially as further research\ndetermines the role that modifiable risk factors play in the\ndisablement process. In this study the analysis was restricted\nto the effect of age and gender, basic demographic indica-\ntors. However, the difference by age in the time characteris-\ntics of the disablement process, and the differential mortality\nby gender in those severely disabled, suggest that we have\nmore to learn about this issue and help us to begin formulat-\ning hypotheses about the processes underlying the develop-\nment of severe disability. Further research is needed to\nunderstand how other demographic and psychosocial char-\nacteristics, specific diseases, and other risk factors influence\nthe course of disability onset.\n"
