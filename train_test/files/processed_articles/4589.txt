The form is comedy, as represented\nby the joke. Two intermingled themes dominate this explora-\ntion: comedians' need for their jokes to be recognized as their\nown personal (or authentic) creations, and the media environ-\nment in which the production of comedy is shaped. Omid\nDjalili's comment on his own performance \"This shit doesn't\nintroduces the topic very effectively. If comedy doesn't write\nitself, where does it come from? Freud was interested in pre-\ncisely this question. He remarks that \"The great majority of\njokes . . . are circulated anonymously; one would be curious to\nlearn from what sort of people such productions originate\"\nthe author's own interest in the question when on the school\nplayground in the 1950s he heard jokes that had clearly been\ngiven an elaborate structure by someone who fully understood\nhow to contrive something that used conventional comic tech-\nnique to prompt laughter. At the same time, they were of such\ninfantile stupidity and filthiness that it was impossible to\nbelieve that they had ever been intended to appear in print or\nbe performed in front of a paying audience, live or broadcast.\nBoth Freud and the author were essentially asking their ques-\ntion in a pre-mass communication environment when most\njokes were normally an anonymous oral phenomenon.\nity on the nature of the joke itself. In his second chapter, on\nThe Technique of Jokes, he discusses them as a combination\nof [comic] technique and [humorous] thought. The thought is\na perception of something anomalous whether in language\n(the sort of verbal coincidence that makes a pun), human\nbehavior (someone's quirks or tics), beliefs, relationships,\npolitical and social circumstances, culture both high and low,\nreligion, and science. The comic technique is the presentation\nof this perception in a way that points up what the comedian\nidentifies as its humorous qualities. The technique is most\ncommonly structural and verbal, although comedians empha-\nsize and illustrate their jokes with facial expressions and their\nbody language. Even the most inspired and best structured\njoke is usually most effective when delivered with the judg-\nment and timing of a practiced comedian and when emerging\nconvincingly from a natural or well realized comic persona.\nWhat Freud said in 1905 holds true even today.\nThe second half of the 20th century and the beginning of\nthe 21st has become the era of the stand-up comedian (a per-\nformer who literally stands in front of an audience to deliver\ncomic material). In this era it is possible to uncover much\nmore about the creation of comic content than is true of ear-\nlier periods. In the United Kingdom particularly, and else-\nwhere to a significant but lesser extent, there is an enormous\noutput of comedy in a range of different communication\n1Loughborough University, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nPaul Sturges, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, Loughborough,\nEmail: r.p.sturges@lboro.ac.uk\nThe Production of Comedy: The Joke in\nthe Age of Social Media\nPaul Sturges1\n Keywords\ncommunication studies, communication, culture, technology, cultural communication, new media, performing arts\n2 SAGE Open\nformats. Much of this is created by the stand-up comedians\nwho perform it. It is not especially difficult to obtain insights\ninto the creative processes of stand-up comedy. Many of the\ncurrent creators of comedy are very self-conscious and open\nabout this. Twenty-first century comedians would like to\nthink that their jokes are correctly attributed to them and that\ntheir professional skills and abilities are properly understood.\nJokes still circulate unattributed, with the Internet as chief\nmedium for this. But the nature of the medium often permits\nanyone who is sufficiently interested to trace them back to a\nspecific creator. An effect of this is that writers can now be\nmore effectively judged as artists who make authentic per-\nsonal statements through their comedy. What follows will\nexplore the outpouring of new comic content, as far as pos-\nsible through the words of comedians themselves, with the\nthemes of media influences and authenticity as the main foci.\nMethodology and Literature\nThe method adopted here is to develop a narrative in the\nmanner usual in historical and literary studies. Use is made\nof original testimony derived from the author's ongoing pro-\ngram of interviews with comedians, earlier examples of\nwhich provided the evidence for a previous article (Sturges,\n2010). In what follows, the date and location of an interview\nis given on its first use in the text, but not subsequently.\nEffectively, a small number of interviews and conversations\nis used to suggest something about the activity of a large\ncommunity of performers. An estimate would suggest that\nBritain has hundreds, maybe thousands, of professional\ncomedians constituting a higher number per capita than any\nother country, including the United States. To place this in\nproportion, the 5 million Danes support as few as 20 to 30\nfull-time comedians (Russell, 2013). Making a clear distinc-\ntion between stand-up comedians and comic performers of\ntheatre plays and films or radio and TV series and sketch\nshows is not possible. There is too much overlap. However,\nthe main focus here is on individual comic performance\nrather than scripted sketch and full-length drama comedy on\nstage, radio, TV, and movies. We should, however, note that\nstand-up comedy routines are also recorded and broadcast on\nradio and TV and sold as videos.\nIn addition to interview material, much of the argument\ndeveloped here is based on a reading of selected titles from\nthe literature of comedy. Naturally using the literature begins\nwith the essential insights provided by the scholarly classics.\ntireless cataloguing of, and commentary on, the dirty joke.\nMore recently, the literature of comedy has grown swiftly.\nand Lockyer and Pickering (2005) are worth mentioning as\nproviding particularly relevant context. Henkle (1980) sets\nEnglish popular comedy in a cultural context, as does\nMedhurst (2007) who draws on a rich selection from the\nwealth of recent commentary. Specifically on the joke, Holt's\n(2008) elegant essay illustrates the form very effectively. A\nworking comedian's thoughts on the subject can be found in\nCarr and Greeves (2006). This is very definitely not a schol-\narly work, and indeed much of the source material for a study\nsuch as the present one is popular in intent rather than schol-\narly. Thus, there are relevant general accounts of comedy\nThere is an account of a pioneering scriptwriting collective\nfrom McCann (2006); many textbooks on scriptwriting such\nas Wolfe (1992); and others on performance, of which\nRitchie (2012) is a recent example. The outstanding contri-\nbution to this literature, however, is the remarkably candid\nand informative commentary on stand-up comedy of the per-\nformer and writer Stewart Lee (2010). What Lee does is to\nannotate transcripts of his own live comedy performances\nwith a dense body of comments, explanations, confessions,\nchallenges, and additional comic content. His contribution to\nthe literature of stand-up comedy, and comedy in general, is\na landmark.\nComedy and Broadcast Media\nBefore examining the current mode of production of com-\nedy, it is necessary to look back at the immediate past. The\npast 70 years has seen the mutation of comedy from an art or\nentertainment performed entirely to live audiences to a form\nalso disseminated by mass media and now, in particular, by\nsocial media. This process of change took place in the mid-\n20th century. In the 19th century, comedians were heard in\nthe music halls: performance spaces known for their vulgar-\nity and vitality and found all over Britain. Vaudeville was\nprobably the closest American equivalent. Music hall\ndeclined and died away in the early 20th century, with vari-\nety theatre providing a new outlet for comedy. Variety in turn\ndeclined, but this time in competition with the early manifes-\ntations of broadcasting in the second half of the century. Live\ncomedy in the United Kingdom largely retreated to the\nnorthern workingmen's club circuit. As will be explained\nlater, the comedy of the clubs was generally considered\nunsuitable for media dissemination. Mid-century radio and\nTV essentially incorporated the blander and more acceptable\ncontent that characterized the variety tradition into sketch\nshows and situation comedy. With the exception of the clubs,\ncomedy writing and performance continued to be driven by\nbroadcast media until social media and a new comedy club\ncircuit stimulated the fresh waves of comedy that are the sub-\nject of this article.\nIt is more or less a clich\u00e9 that before mass media a come-\ndian could build a long and successful career with little more\nmaterial than was needed for a single performance, which\ncould be presented in front of different audiences up and\ndown the country. It might be a clich\u00e9, but the evidence sug-\nknown as the Prime Minister of Mirth, was so preeminent in\nthe musical hall days that detailed commentary on his comic\nstyle and content has survived to be collated, for instance by\nHarding (1990). What becomes immediately obvious is that\nRobey did not depend on the strength of his jokes: It was his\ncomic persona, his mode of delivery, and his songs, linked by\ncomic patter, that were the source of his success. Audiences\nregarded this patter as sublimely funny and it is here that we\nmight expect to find jokes. However, to the modern reader,\ntranscripts of his material contain hardly any. He interacted\nwith the audience through poses, gestures, facial expres-\nsions, and indignant accusations that they were reading unin-\ntended meanings into what he said.\nA very different set of demands began to apply in com-\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1923, variety, as\nan entertainment form, transferred to radio more or less\nintact. The strains this created for comedians were apparent\nfrom the beginning, with an official view from the BBC in\n1931 being that \"few comedians are capable of writing their\nown material and the dearth of clever humorous writers is\nprograms, most notably It's That Man Again (frequently\nreferred to as ITMA), were scheduled almost every evening.\nThe extent to which the catchphrases of broadcast comedi-\nans became part of the currency of everyday conversation\nshows how popular comedy was, and why it was regarded as\nan important contribution to national morale. The mass taste\nfor radio comedy that had been nurtured in war time meant\nthat in the post-war years, there was a continuing need for\nnew comic output. Some of the response was predictable,\ndrawing on the undemanding merriment, catchphrases,\nwordplay, and stereotypical characters already popular. This\nmaterial was fed into half hour shows, or slots in longer\nradio variety programs, and used sketches, conversations,\nand monologues to deliver a flow of jokes.\nSome of the material was developed by the performers\nthemselves, but some was from writers who provided mate-\nrial of differing levels of quantity and quality. Thus Bob\nMonkhouse began his career in comedy as a teenager in\n1945, selling pages of his jokes to comedians for a few shil-\nlings at theatre stage doors (Monkhouse, 1993).\nThe career of Frankie Howerd exemplifies the struggles\nof a great performer who was not himself a writer. During his\nshort first radio season in 1946, he effectively used up the\nentire resources of material that he had been touring around\nvariety theatres for years. At first his response was \"studying\na pile of joke books, cannibalising their contents and then\ninserting enough stutters, hesitations and digressions to\nensure that every single joke could be relied on to go a long,\nimprovised research proved inadequate for his needs and in\nNovember 1947 he hired Eric Sykes to write for him. Howerd\nunderstood his debt to Sykes and those who wrote for him\nsubsequently. \"When it came to writers, he knew that no\nother comedian in the country had shown them, both as indi-\nviduals and as members of a profession, so much trust,\nhis writers later successfully adapted to television. BBC\nTelevision, which had a tentative beginning before the war,\nbegan to broadcast in earnest after the end of hostilities, but\ndid not become a significant vehicle for comedy until the\nWhat was distinctive about the early years of mass media,\ncompared with the previous age of live performance, was\nthat the creation of comedy became a major aspect of per-\nformers'work, and indeed the whole profession of the script-\nwriters who served them. This theme of comedy writing as\nwork has become even more significant in the period as\nstand-up comedy has become the dominant mode. What has\nchanged in the age of stand-up comedy is that the balance has\nshifted toward a concept of the comedian as a kind of auteur.\nThere is thus a tension that will be apparent in the following\nsections between the creation of jokes as a form of artistic\nendeavor and as an occupation serving the demand for nov-\nelty of mass media audiences. The contemporaneous devel-\nopment and growth of social media has both raised levels of\ndemand and permitted the comedian to interact with audi-\nences in a way that offers unprecedented reach and speed.\nThe Joke in Stand-Up Comedy\nProbably the dominant theme of commentary on comedy\ntoday is the search for what we will call \"authenticity.\" An\noverarching idea of what authenticity might mean emerged\nin its British version with the \"alternative comedy\" of Alexei\nSayle, Jo Brand, Ben Elton, and others in the 1980s. It was\nfirst heard in London's Comedy Store, and it still dominates\nthe content of routines heard in venues up and down the\ncountry. If it was alternative to anything, that was to the two\ncomic traditions that emerged from music hall and variety.\nThese were light comedy, as broadcast on mainstream radio\nand TV and as performed on stage, and the comedy of the\nnorthern workingmen's clubs. The former set out to amuse\nbut not challenge. The latter tapped into a coarser, crueler\nstrain of comedy in which there is a kind of disgust for the\nbody and its functions, and women and all kinds of minori-\nties might be insulted and demeaned. It was perhaps for the\nworkingmen's clubs that the coarse and ugly jokes of the\n1950s playground had been created. This form of comedy\nwas seldom if ever broadcast in unexpurgated form, although\na few comedians such as Bernard Manning and Roy\n\"Chubby\" Brown built careers that partially lapped over into\nthe media world from the grubby, male-dominated live ven-\nues of the north of England. Commentators generally draw\nattention to alternative comedy's rejection of political and\nsocial establishments in favor of human values, the honest\nway it embraced even the most taboo of subject matter, and\nits angry, expletive-laden voice. It is personal comedy cre-\nated in this spirit that we mean when we talk of authenticity.\n4 SAGE Open\nBut we use the term in a rather broader sense to cover the\ncomedian's ownership of both content (Freud's \"thought\")\nand expression (Freud's \"technique\"). In this article, authen-\nticity refers much more to jokes that reveal a personal voice\nthan it does to jokes that embody a social critique.\nWhen we talk of the work of creating comedy and the\nartistic pressures, we also need to talk of the incentives and\nrewards. Audiences noisily express their intolerance of stale\nandfamiliarmaterial.AccordingtoBethanyBlack(Interview,\nbehave as if they were in the music hall age and tour what is\nbasically a single set or routine round small venues season\nafter season. However good this set might be, the lack of new\nmaterial means that they have no genuine prospect of break-\ning through into the world of radio, TV, stadium gigs, and\nDVDs. All of these demand novelty. At this point, it is impor-\ntant to stress that although the payment offered for a 20-min\nslot in a small comedy club might scarcely cover the expenses\nincurred in travelling there, in contrast, the financial rewards\nof success are enormous. A few very successful comedians\nsuch as Peter Kay, Jimmy Carr, and Michael McIntyre earn\nannual sums measured in millions. The basis for this level of\nsuccess usually involves a regular TV spot, corporate enter-\ntainment gigs, tours of major theatres and even stadiums,\nDVDs of live performances, book contracts, voice-over\nwork, and other peripherals. Even just a smaller impact in\nsome of these forms can represent a comfortable middle-\nclass income level. Comedians who care both about the qual-\nity and integrity of their material and hope for major success\neffectively commit themselves to produce great numbers of\nnew jokes each year. This is impossible without both skill\nand application, but working with social media does facili-\ntate the process in ways that will be illustrated.\nThe Tension Between Effort and\nAuthenticity\nComedy writing is characterized very effectively by Schneider\nIt takes a lot of work to make a good joke. I know it's not work\nin the sense of a seven-year old child down an Angolan tin mine,\nbut I also know some jokes just pop out spontaneously. But more\noften than not, the birth of a joke is a long, painful process,\nwithout gas and air, or epidural (p. 3).\nmight take him and Graham Chapman 2 hr to generate 2 min\nof material. Bethany Black describes similar levels of work.\nUsing her own life and observations as her main sources, she\nsometimes finds readymade jokes emerge. Her experience is\nthat these tend not to be as good as those that require work\n(for instance to set them in character). She aims to devote at\nleast 3 hr per day to writing and tests material via social\nmedia, reckoning that about 20 favorable responses indicate\nthat a joke will work. A comedian such as Gary Delaney\nsists of those tiny comic units we call \"one liners\" has to\ngenerate enormous numbers of jokes. Delaney records them\non his phone as they occur to him. He calculates that only\nabout 1 in 20 is worth persisting with for his own routines\n(though he may use the best of the rest in scripts for other\ncomedians).\nThe nature of this persistence, which turns a comic idea\ninto a well-formed joke, naturally varies from comedian to\ncomedian. Lee (2010) suggests that \"even though critics and\nTV Commissioners always talk about our art form in terms\nof its content, it is the rhythm, pitch, tone and pace of what\nwe do--the non-verbal cues--that are arguably more impor-\ntant\" (p. 299). So we can envisage the work as first identify-\ning or creating content and then giving that content the form\nin which it can be performed successfully. Bethany Black\nidentifies a threefold formula--[writing] skills, turnover [of\ncontent], and a Unique Selling Point [or comic persona]--\nwhich provides for this. Turnover might merely be based on\nthe resolution to create fresh material, but skills include both\nthe writing of jokes and embedding them in a persona. The\npersona tends to be presented to an audience as if it is a truth-\nful representation of the comedian's attitudes, beliefs, behav-\nior, but in fact it is always more or less artificial. Stewart Lee\n(2010) puts it in the following way: \"The personal is absent\nfrom my work. The me you see on stage is largely a con-\nstruct, based on me at my worst, my most annoying, my most\npetty and my most patronizing\" (p. 249). Despite what he\nsays, this is, of course, intensely personal and, indeed,\nauthentic even if it only represents part of his personality and\npart of his natural voice.\nLee, always the most trenchant of commentators, calls\nthose performers whose comedy is written for them as\n\"cheats.\" For the comedian to avoid being a cheat, in Lee's\nterms, is not an easy assignment. It is important to emphasize\nthe point that this represents a break with the past. Griffin\n(2005) says of Ken Dodd, the great survivor of the old-\nschool, that he does not reveal himself in his comedy.\nThis point of view is one of the schisms between comics of the\nold and newer schools. The younger breed clearly thinks that\ncomedy has to be about something and to say something about\nthe comedian; the old pros of Dodd's generation think the\nopposite is true. Funny is funny: no more no less. (p. 201)\nNowadays, there is a core audience, a body of critics, and a\ncommunity of fellow writers and performers that does not\nshare Dodd's view. This community demands that comedi-\nans should not merely deliver highly polished new content,\nbut also speak with their own personal voice.\nNew comedy is expected to avoid the familiar themes\n(mother-in-law jokes, racial stereotyping, etc.) of the pre-\nstand-up era, but where can the comedian look for inspira-\ntion? The idea, sometimes expressed, that only the experience\nof conflict and the awareness of death produce great comedy\nis unhelpful, given that most British and American comedi-\nans have enjoyed comparatively trouble free lives. A few\ncomedians, who have grown up in harder circumstances, do\nhave experience that offers insight into the extremes. Zoe\nthings to say about the caution with which she exposes her\nown experience as a gay woman to public view. Bethany\nBlack does not shrink from developing comedy as a trans-\ngendered lesbian woman. For the majority of comedians,\nthere is a choice of big social and political themes and the\nexploration of daily and domestic experience. Many of them\navoid the big themes and risk banality in the small scale and\npersonal. An alert comedian observes the daily life with an\neye for the bizarre. Delaney's starting point could be a clich\u00e9,\na neologism, something heard on the radio (particularly late\nnight talk shows), song lyrics, or other \"found\" material.\nBlack might see the unintended comedy in an overheard con-\nversation or the \"inspirational\" statements people place on\nFacebook. Comedians also structure jokes around phrases\nand jingles from familiar advertisements or popular TV\nshows. This is material requiring transmutation from its\nessential triviality. Twisting and manipulating it into viable\njoke form is work, and the effectiveness of that work needs\nto be tested.\nTesting New Comedy and Social Media\nMuch of the testing of new material today is no different\nfrom what it might have been in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nIt is done in small venues where quite well-known comedi-\nans will perform work in progress to small audiences for a\nnegligible fee. Sarah Millican (Interview, Derby, January 21,\n2008) follows a personal rule that if material she tests on an\naudience succeeds on three out of five occasions, it is strong\nenough to take its place in her regular live routines. What is\ndistinctive about the current age of comedy is that social\nmedia now offer a powerful alternative to this process.\nExposing new jokes via social media has two values--it is\nboth an invaluable testing ground for material and a means of\nbuilding up a profile with a potential audience. Delaney\nto track about 25% of ticket sales for his 2010 Edinburgh run\nto this following. He finds that using Twitter (not Facebook\nwhich has too static an \"audience\") works better than just\nsitting in front of a screen or a sheet of paper. However, there\nare two downsides to this. Delaney calculates that if one of\nhis jokes gets so re-posted that it goes viral, within little more\nthan 24 hr it is circulating without attribution. After 72 hr\naudiences can be heard commenting \"that just an old pub\njoke,\" rendering good material almost unusable. However,\nsome material transcends this and works despite the familiar-\nity. He hopes to make an audio CD of this \"evolution-tested\"\nmaterial as a kind of heritage of his comedy.\nThe second downside to exposing new material on social\nmedia is that other comedians may appropriate the jokes.\nThis is a common occurrence which occasionally surfaces\npublicly: Delaney, Tim Vine, Marcus Brigstocke, Phil\nJupitus, and others have discussed this (Schneider, 2009).\nTheir response varies from largely impotent anger expressed\nvia the networks and in the media but also, more directly,\nprotests directed at audience members who appear to be\nrecording their act. This is not new and the author well\nremembers the late Mike Reid at a private club performance\nin the early 1970s refusing to continue while an audience\nmember made notes. At the other end of the spectrum of\nresponses, there is a resigned acceptance that this \"borrow-\ning\" is just an incentive to make their own comedy unique\nand less likely to be passed off as someone else's. This is a\nproblem. Originality is hard to achieve precisely because\njokes take standard forms, and because they circle around\nfamiliar topics. The comedians of the past did not worry too\nmuch: the familiarity of much of their material might well\nhave been reassuring for audiences. They were naturally bor-\nrowers, purchasers, and recyclers of jokes. If they used\nsomeone else's joke, audiences would probably not notice,\nor maybe even relish its familiarity. As we have already\npointed out, here were many willing sellers of jokes, and\npublished jokes and other comic material could provide ideas\nand inspiration. The comedian as researcher is not a com-\npletely unknown phenomenon and Ken Dodd, for instance,\nis both a great archivist of comic material and an enthusiastic\nuser of libraries (Conversation after performance at Derby,\nJune 5, 2010). Today, the competitiveness of the comedy\nworld and the media exposure of new jokes make the ques-\ntion of originality a more urgent concern.\nThe ultimate intention is to create a complete comic rou-\ntine from newly-written jokes (and carefully prepared impro-\nvisations). This requires a further input of hard work. Stewart\nLee creates what he calls \"Epic shows full of call backs and\ncross references or supporting shifts of mood or emotional\ngambits\" (Lee, 2010, p. 95) that rely on a narrative or con-\nceptual through line. It is something akin to this that a come-\ndian must create to have any hope of more than just small\nvenue exposure. The testing ground is likely to be a month's\nresidency at the Edinburgh Festival in August of the year. It\nis here that critical attention and the chance of high-profile\nbookings can be generated. Edinburgh comedy shows are\nexpected to last for an hour, which means that a comedian's\nnormal 20 min set will need to be replaced or expanded into\nsomething much more like one of Lee's epics. The extra\nwork this demands is obvious, but a comedian's profession-\nalism points in this way already. Black believes that the life\ncycle of any comedy set, short or long, should be no more\nthan 6 months. This means that while touring one set, another\nmust be in preparation.\nFor the comedian who performs one-liners, the demands\nare very much greater. Gary Delaney, one of the outstanding\none-liner comedians, knows his material works best in a\n6 SAGE Open\n20-min format, describes the structuring of an hour-long\nEdinburgh set. He aims to give the material an upward trajec-\ntory, starting gently before introducing a more shocking\ntheme or a mini-narrative. He will package different parts of\nthe set with contrasting \"voices.\" Occasional songs or bits of\nstage business can be used as punctuation between the parts.\nThe aim is to create rises and troughs, light and shade, with\nsome fixed and some floating breakpoints to avoid the flag-\nging of audience attention. Yet at the same time as he subtly\nshapes his material, he employs total openness, telling the\naudience that \"these are just jokes and some are in bad taste.\"\nThe elaborate artifice of his Edinburgh-length routine is con-\nsiderable even though the consistent tone of his personal\nvoice is always apparent. The virtue of a fully realized rou-\ntine suitable for presentation at Edinburgh is that if it is good\nenough, it can be used for a tour of major venues and an\neventual commercially available DVD.\nConcluding Remarks\nThere is, in Britain and the United States and to a lesser\nextent in other countries, a content producing community\nthat creates the thousands of small, often ephemeral, works\nof commentary on human life that we call jokes. We have\nillustrated how in response to the demands of mass media\nthe writing of jokes became a painstaking professional pro-\ncess, despite the process's essential playfulness. The pos-\nsibilities presented by social media now, in turn, allowed\ncomedians to engage with an extensive public, not limited\nby presence at a specific venue, while their work is in the\nprocess of creation. Social media are both an outlet for con-\ntent and a stimulus for fresh production. Services such as\nFacebook and Twitter disseminate content at a rate which,\ngiven the requirement for novelty in comedy first noted by\nFreud, might seem to threaten to exhaust the production\ncapacity. Indeed, critics periodically speculate that the\nresources are becoming exhausted and that new comedy is\nno longer of the same quality as before. It is reasonable to\nsuggest that the demand for authenticity, which comedians\nand critics impose on the task of writing comedy, actually\ncontributes strongly to more and better quality comic mate-\nrial. Certainly, the production capacity seems to respond\nwith fresh material constantly appearing from both new and\nestablished writers and performers.\nOn every night of every year, comedians try out new\nmaterial which they themselves have created in their own\nauthentic voice in pubs, clubs, and small theatres, but cru-\ncially this is only part of the story. The extent to which this\nmaterial has already withstood the test of exposure via social\nmedia makes it possible to suggest that the media environ-\nment itself is a kind of engine for stimulating new comedy.\nThis might make it sound as though ideas plus social media\nequals jokes. This is far from the case. Whether a comedian\nexplores the most problematic recesses of human behavior,\nas does Lee, or generates inspired wordplay, like Delaney, it\nis expected that there will be an underlying truth and coher-\nence to the material. Comedians who are seen to be giving\nsomething of themselves are valued more highly than those\nwho just seek to amuse. The comedian in the age of social\nmedia is both an artist and a technician employing a range of\ncreative and communication skills to produce new jokes with\nthe flavor of authenticity. Some of the new material that they\ncreate is rubbish: some is gold. Today this distinction can\nemerge fast and decisively. Social media are both a challenge\nand a stimulus for the comedian. There is only one consistent\nfeature between the pre-media age, the age of broadcasting,\nand the current age of social media. This is that someone\nsomewhere is exploring their own responses to life and pol-\nishing this into new jokes that can be offered up to audiences.\nStyle, scale, and media vary, but the joke remains.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBakhtin, M.
