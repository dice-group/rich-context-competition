Increasing\nevidence suggests that it can prevent the tumorigenesis of cancer associated with nonresolving inflammation. However, the\npossible anti-inflammatory mechanism responsible for preventing tumorigenesis of precancerous lung lesions is not well\nelucidated. Materials and methods. Male A/J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups with 10 mice in each group: (1) blank\ngroup (saline), (2) benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] group, (3) and (4) B(a)P + PEL (5 g/kg/d, 10 g/kg/d, administered by gavage), (5)\nB(a)P + celecoxib (30 mg/kg/d, administered by gavage). Nodes on the lung surface were observed and calculated. The\nlevels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 were\ndetected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\n(HIF-), IL-1, miR-101, and Lin28B protein levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Results.\nPEL extract treatment significantly reduced the number of nodes on the lung surface and attenuated B(a)P-induced levels\nof proinflammatory cytokines MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 in lung tissue. The protein expressions of COX-2 and HIF-\nwere significantly decreased by the treatment of PEL. In addition, both PEL extract and celecoxib markedly upregulate\nthe expression of miR-101 while downregulating IL-1 and Lin28B levels. Conclusion. Our study indicated that treatment\nwith PEL extract can not only protect the lung from inflammatory injury but effectively prevent precancerous lung lesions\nthrough regulating the IL-1/miR-i101/Lin28B signaling pathway.\n",

Under long-term exposure or stimulation, the\nacute inflammatory responses to an inflammatory trigger\ncan shift to a chronic one with nonresolving inflammation.2\nIn fact, this inflammation is not a primary cause of cancer,\nit is an essential adaptive response that aims to restore\nhomeostasis and is also a significant contributor to their\npathogenesis. That is, continuous stimulation for this\nhomeostasis causes a microenvironment of unbalanced\n1Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Nanjing, P R China\n2Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Nanjing, P R China\n3Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China\n4Third School of Clinical Medical of Nanjing University of Chinese\nMedicine, Jiangsu Nanjing, P R China\nCorresponding Authors:\nXiao-bin Tan and Liang Feng, Key Laboratory of New Drug Delivery\nSystems of Chinese Materia Medica, Jiangsu Provincial Academy of\nChinese Medicine, 100# Shizi Street, HongshanRoad, Jiangsu Nanjing,\nEmail: njtxb@hotmail.com; wenmoxiushi@163.com\nAnti-inflammatory Effects of Phyllanthus\nemblica L on Benzopyrene-Induced\nPrecancerous Lung Lesion by Regulating\nCheng-cheng Wang, MSc1,2, Jia-rui Yuan, MSc1,2, Chun-fei Wang, MSc2,3,\nNan Yang, MSc1,2, Juan Chen, MSc1,2, Dan Liu, MSc2, Jie Song, MSc2,\nLiang Feng, PhD2,4, Xiao-bin Tan, MSc2,4, and Xiao-bin Jia, PhD2,4\n Keywords\nPhyllanthus emblica L, anti-inflammatory, precancerous lung lesion, IL-1/miR-101/Lin28B signaling pathway\ninflammatory mediators and cytokines such as cyclo-\noxygenase (COX-2), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-,\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interleukin (IL)-1\nresulting in the pathogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of\ntumor. Therefore, regulation of these mediators could\nbecome effective therapy in inflammation-related cancer,\nand treatment would be more efficient if the mechanism\nresponsible for the mediators regulating nonresolving\ninflammation is elucidated.\nNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the lead-\ning cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.3 Evidence\nsuggest that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 is dramat-\nically elevated in the serum of patients with NSCLC. In\nvitro studies indicated that IL-1 promoted the proliferation\nand migration of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, IL-1\nrepresses expression of a tumor inhibitor miR-101 through\nregulating COX-2 and HIF-. Furthermore, the suppression\nof miR-101 downregulates its efficient target Lin28B,\nwhich is another critical mediator of tumor repression.4 A\npathway is a novel regulatory axis of pathogenic inflamma-\ntory signaling in NSCLC.\nPhyllanthus emblica L (PEL), commonly known as\namla, has been used extensively in Asian countries such as\nIndia and Thailand, and collected in Chinese pharmaco-\npoeia (2010). Phytochemical studies show that it is rich in\ntannins, polyphenols, gallic acid, flavonoids, vitamin C,\nand emblicol.5 It has been extensively used to treat various\ndiseases, especially aspects of inflammation such as pneu-\nmonia, hepatitis, and even cancer. There is a wealth of\ninformation indicating that PEL incorporates both cancer-\npreventive and antitumor properties.6 Sultana et al7 have\nsuggested that PEL extract shows strong chemopreventive\npotential for hepatocarcinogenesis with combined activity\nof the reported tannins and flavonoids through modulating\nthe detoxification armory and inhibiting the expression of\nseveral cell proliferation markers.7 Progallin A from PEL\nfruit induces apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma\nand it exerts its apoptotic effect by upregulation of Bax\nexpression and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression.8\nCorilagin, a major component of the phenolic family of\nPEL, shows high biological activity against chromosome\nalterations and DNA damage as well as anti-inflammatory\neffects.9 In addition, PEL could significantly suppress pro-\ninflammatory genes, including COX-2, iNOS, IL-16, and\nIL-6.10,11 PEL extract also efficiently reduced TNF- and\nIL-1 levels with immunomodulatory effects on NSAID-\ninduced ulcers.12 Reported outcomes have strongly sug-\ngested that the anticarcinogenic activity of PEL might be\nattributed to its anti-inflammatory property. However, no\nresearch has been conducted to explore this relationship\nbetween the anticarcinogenic effects and anti-inflammatory\nproperties of PEL. The aim of this study was to provide a\npossible mechanism for the effect of PEL on benzo(a)\npyrene [B(a)P]-induced precancerous lung lesions related\nto the regulation of the inflammatory signaling pathway.\nMaterials and Methods\nReagents\nThe dried fruit of PEL was collected from the actual area\nwhere it is produced: Tibet, China. It was authenticated as\nPEL by professor De-kang Wu from Nanjing University of\nChinese Medicine. B(a)P was offered by Sigma Chemical\nCo (St Louis, MO). Macrophage inflammatory protein\n(MIP-2), TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Key GEN\nBiotech Co, Ltd (Nanjing, P R China). Antibodies of COX-\nBoster (Wuhan P R China). Other chemicals were all\nreagent grade.\nPreparation of Plant Extracts\nThe dried fruit of PEL were ground into powder. The pow-\nder (1 kg) was weighed and extracted with double-distilled\ntime (2 times). Then, the extract was filtered to remove the\nimpurities and was concentrated in a rotary evaporator at\n50\u00b0C under reduced pressure. The yields of dried residues\nwere 21.5%, and the sample was stored at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the\nsupernatant of the samples was filtered through a 0.45-\u00b5m\ncellulose acetate membrane for Liquid chromatography\nelectrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry\n(LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS) analysis. The\ndoses given to animals (5 and 10 g/kg/d) of distilled extract\nof PEL were expressed as grams of the original dry materi-\nals per kilogram body weight.\nLC/ESI/MS/MS Analysis for PEL Components\nThe sample was separated with an Agilent C\nphase consisted of (A) water\u00adacetic acid (100:2, v/v) and (B)\nmethanol using a gradient program of 95% to 85% (B) in 0 to\nflow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the column temperature was\nmaintained at 30\u00b0C. The detection wavelength was set at 280\nnm. LC/MS/MS analysis was performed on Thermo Fisher\nScientific ion trap mass spectrometer, equipped with an elec-\ntrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Bremen, Germany). This\nanalysis was operated under negative-ion mode. The opti-\nmized operating parameters were as follows: ion spray\nvoltage, 4 kV; nebulizer gas (GS1): 0.50 L/min; and curtain\ngas (CUR): 0.15 L/min. The mass spectrometer was detected\nAnimal Treatment\nHealthy male A/J mice (18-22 g) at 8 weeks of age were\npurchased from SLAC Experimental Animals Co, Ltd\n(Shanghai, China). The animal experiment protocol was\nreviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of\nChinese Medicine. First, mice were injected with corn oil\nthe mice were divided into 5 groups randomly, with 10 mice\nin each group, and they were administered for 24 consecu-\ntive weeks: blank group, model group, PEL (5 and 10 g/\nkg/d), and positive celecoxib (30 mg/kg/d) group. Blank\nand model mice were treated orally with saline solution\n(0.9%) by gavage administration each day. All the mice\nwere put to death by suffocation applying CO\nweeks. Lung tissues of mice were fixed in Tellyesniczky's\nsolution (70% ethanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, and 5% for-\nmalin) overnight and stored in 70% ethanol. The lung sur-\nface nodes were calculated by counting under a dissecting\nmicroscope.\nDetermination of MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1\nby ELISA Kits\nBlood samples were collected before sacrifice via the orbital\nthe supernatant was collected for analysis with ELISA kits.\nThe specific procedures were followed by the manufactur-\ner's instructions (Key GEN Biotech Co, Ltd, Nanjing, P R\nChina). Finally, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm\nusing a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax19.0, Molecular\nDevices, USA). The levels of inflammatory cytokines MIP-\n2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 were calculated according to the\nstandard curve.\nImmunohistochemical Analysis\nAll the tissues from lung lobes were cut to 4-\u00b5m thickness\nfor further immunohistochemical analysis. Sections of par-\naffin-embedded samples from mice were prepared follow-\ning the standard protocols. Briefly, sections were dewaxed\nfor 20 minutes at 60\u00b0C and incubated in citrate buffer (pH =\nwashed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) each\nfor 3 minutes and treated with 5% fetal bovine serum at\nroom temperature for 25 minutes. Primary antibodies anti-\napplication in the incubation of tissues, and the sections\nwere incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBS,\nthe sections were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour with the sec-\nondary antibodies and then stained with 3, 3-diaminobenzi-\ndine. An optical microscope was used to take photographs\nof slides.\nWestern Blotting Analysis\nLung tissues were collected from all 5 groups and washed\ntwice with ice-cold PBS. Sequentially, tissues were lysed for\n35 minutes at 4\u00b0C with radio-immunoprecipitation assay, and\nminutes. The concentration of protein was quantified by the\nBCA method according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nThen, the equalized amounts of proteins from each sample\nwere resolved in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl polyacryl-\namide gel electrophoresis) and transferred to a polyvinyli-\ndene fluoride membrane. Additionally, membranes were\nblocked with blocking buffer before being incubated over-\nnight with a 1:250 dilution of specific primary antibodies\nmembranes were washed with tris-buffered saline and\nTWEEN 20 4 times (10 minutes each time), and then chemo-\nluminescence reagents were added for the visualization of the\nprotein bands. The quantification of proteins was analyzed.\nAll experiments were performed at least 3 times.\nStatistical Analysis\nExperimental data in each group were analyzed using SPSS\n11.5 software. (IBM, Armonk, NY). Statistical analyses\nwere performed using a 1-way analysis of variance. P <.05\nwas considered to indicate a statistically significant differ-\nence. All values were presented as means \u00b1 SD.\nResults\nIdentification of Chemical Components\nHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was conducted to identify PEL\ncompounds. Tannins, organic acids, and flavonoids of PEL\ncould be eluted under the proper conditions within 120 min-\nutes. The peaks whose retention time ranges from 3 to 100\nminutes might consist primarily of tannins, organic acids,\nand flavonoids, compared with these reported data.\nFurthermore, as is shown in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1,\naccording to fragment ion information, these compounds of\nPEL were identified as chebulagic acid, gallic acid, chebu-\nlinic acid, mucic acid 2-O-gallate, corilagin, ellagic acid,\nquercitrin-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucosylside,\nrutin, quercetin, kaempferol, and wogonin. Our established\nHPLC-ESI-MS/MS methods could make it possible for\nexperiments with replications.\nPEL Extract Reduces Nodes on Lung Surface\nCompared with the normal, the nodes on lung surface in A/J\nmice were obviously increased by an induction of B(a)P\n(P < .001). However, the number of nodes was reduced by\nPEL extracts, especially by the treatment with a dose of 10\ng/kg/d, compared with model group (P < .01 or P < .05;\nFigure 3). Results showed that administration of PEL did\nhave a significant protective effect on lung tumorigenesis.\nPEL Extract Reduces the Levels of Inflammatory\nCytokines\nELISA analyses for several proinflammatory mediators\nwere carried out. As shown in Figure 4, a remarkable\nincrease of MIP-2, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 appears in the\nmodel mice serum compared with the blank one (P < .001 or\nP < .01). However, an evident decrease in these protein lev-\nels could be observed by the treatment with celecoxib as\nwell as in the PEL extract group compared with B(a)P. In\naddition, the high dosage of PEL extract (10 g/kg/d) could\nsignificantly reverse the levels of these cytokines to normal\nlevels (P < .05 or P < .01). The results suggest that PEL\nextract reducing the odds of precancerous lung lesion may\nbe related to the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines.\nPEL Extract Downregulates the Expressions of\nCOX-2 and HIF-\nAs shown in Figure 5, COX-2 protein expression could be\nmarkedly increased by treatment with B(a)P in vivo when\ncompared with that in the blank group (P < .001). However,\nthe treatment with celecoxib distinctly decreased the high\nand low-dose (5 g/kg/d) PEL extracts also remarkably\ndownregulated COX-2 protein expression in vivo (P < .01).\nInterestingly, the same tendency was seen in HIF- expres-\nsion. This outcome indicated that PEL extract downregu-\nlated the expressions in both COX-2 and HIF- factors and\nalso demonstrated that there is a certain link between these\n2 vital mediators in tumor, which has been reported often.\nEffects of PEL Extract on the IL-1/miR-101/\nLin28B Signaling Pathway\ning pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of\nNSCLC. Thus, Western blot analysis was conducted to\nand it showed that celecoxib as well as PEL extract signifi-\ncantly decreased the overexpression of IL-1 and Lin28B\ncompared with the blank group (Figure 6). Data indicated\nthat PEL extract might provide protection from precancer-\nous lung lesions through regulation of the IL-1/miR-101/\nLin28B signaling pathway.\nDiscussion\nB(a)P, a procarcinogen, has been a complete carcinogen in\nanimal models during the whole process from tumor ini-\ntiation to tumor promotion. Lung tumors generated by\nB(a)P in mouse share many genetic, biochemical, and\nFigure 1. LC/ESI/MS/MS Chromatogram of Phyllanthus emblica L.\nhistopathological characteristics similar to those observed\nin human lung cancer.13 Thus, in this study, we established\nthe mouse model induced by B(a)P following recognized\nprinciple.\nCurrently, lung cancer has been shown to be closely\nassociated with nonresolving inflammation in the process\nof malignant transformation.3 Different phytochemicals of\nPEL extract are reported to possess desirable cytotoxicity\nagainst tumor cells and reverse the status of antioxidants to\nnormal level in cancer-bearing animals.14,15 They not only\nsupplement the conventional treatment that can act at almost\neach step of carcinogenesis but offer better conditions with\nminor side effects.5,13 In the present study, we explored the\nprimary chemical components, tannins, organic acids, and\nflavonoids by implementing LC/MS/MS analysis. In gen-\neral, phenolic compounds of PELmay serve as potential herbal\ncandidates for amelioration of acute and chronic inflammation\nbecause of the modulatory action of free radicals.16 The rutin\nin PEL, which is a flavonoid, is known for its anti-inflam-\nmatory properties and can provide protective effects to the\nFigure 2. Chemical Components of Phyllanthus emblica L.\npancreas.17 Compounds with a galloyl moiety showed\nhigher antiproliferative activity than the flavonoid and are\nworth investigating as potential cancer chemopreventive\nagents.18 Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is abundantly\npresent in PEL fruit, has the potential to shelter the body\nfrom oxidative cascades leading to inflammatory injury.19\nIn addition to these constituents, other substances such as\nchebulaginic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin are also\nTable 1.

Furthermore, a signifi-\ncant pathological feature in acute lung injury is that there are\na large number gathered, along with expression of MIP-2\nmRNA, in lung tissue.25,26 In the present study, we found that\nPEL significantly reduced the levels of TNF-, IL-6, and\nMIP-2, which definitely alleviated the inflammation in acute\nlung injury induced by B(a)P and could be the reason why\nPEL helped restore the production of anti-inflammatory fac-\ntors and prevented the formation of precancerous lung\nlesions.\nAlmost all NSCLC preinvasive precursor lesions have\nhigher expression levels of COX-2 than normal lung\ntissue.27,28 Thus, COX-2 has become an important target of\nchemoprevention, and celecoxib is one of its inhibitors.\nBesides, COX-2 can be dramatically upregulated by various\nstimuli such as IL, TNF-, and other tumor promoters.29\nFurthermore, because tumor cells lacking oxygen is a com-\nmon phenomenon in solid tumors, HIF- is the primary\ntranscription factor that makes sure the organism adapts to\nthe hypoxic condition and is comprehensively involved in\nmetabolism as well as apoptosis of cells.30,31 It ensures nor-\nmal function of the organism and cells under hypoxic\nFigure 4.

To investigate the anti-inflam-\nmatory mechanism responsible for preventing tumorigene-\nsisofprecancerouslunglesions,weexaminedtheexpression\nshowed that PEL extract effectively prevented precancerous\nlung lesions by relieving the inflammatory response through\ndownregulating IL-1 and Lin28B expression and upregu-\nlating the level of miR-101 as well as by inhibiting unfavor-\nableinflammatoryfactorsthatareinvolvedincarcinogenesis.\nThese findings suggest that PEL could inhibit the B(a)\nP-induced precancerous lung lesion by alleviating inflam-\nnaling pathway and is, therefore, expected to be a promising\nchemopreventive agent.\nAlthough there was statistically significant alleviation of\nmalignant transformations in lungs after treatment with\nPEL extract in vivo, we still believe that more in vitro\nmechanism studies need to be done. There definitely exist\nseveral inflammatory pathways leading to cancer, and these\nroads connect with as well as affect each other closely.\nFigure 6.
