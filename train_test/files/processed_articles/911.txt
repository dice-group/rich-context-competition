African-American smokers gained less weight with an increase in parity, while the interactions between\nsmoking and physical activity with parity-associated weight gain in whites were complex.\nCONCLUSION: The effects of sociodemographic and behavioral factors on parity-associated weight gain varied by\nrace and parity change, with the most consistent \u00aendings being that unmarried and unemployed white women had\ngreater parity-associated weight gain, while both white and African-American women who smoked, had higher\neducation, or higher parity had lower parity-associated weight gain. This information may contribute to better\ntargeting and more effective interventions to prevent postpartum weight retention.\nKeywords: parity; pregnancy; postpartum; weight; obesity; overweight\nIntroduction\nThe proportion of US women who are overweight is\nincreasing.1 Being overweight is a risk factor for\nexcess morbidity and mortality from chronic dis-\nease2,3 and carries negative psychological and social\nconsequences as well.4 Having children is frequently\ncited as a cause of weight gain among women and a\ncontributor to their becoming overweight.5,6 Studies\nof the effect of childbearing on body weight have\nfound a range of postpartum weight retention from\nnone at all to 2.0 kg per live birth.6\u00b114 Recent data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Survey's\nEpidemiological Follow-up Survey on white women\nchildbearing to be associated with excess weight\ngain of approximately 1.7 kg and with increased risk\nof both substantial weight gain and becoming over-\nAmerican race, younger age, and low socioeconomic\npartum weight retention, but a number of the support-\ning studies are limited due to reliance on self-reported\nweights, failure to control for sociodemographic and\nbehavioral factors that in\u00afuence weight gain and loss,\nor the use of small or localized samples.\nThe present study examines how the association\nbetween parity increase and weight gain is modi\u00aeed\nby sociodemographic factors such as age, race and\nemployment and behavioral factors such as exercise\nand smoking. We used the most comprehensive pro-\nspective national data set available of those that\ninclude measured weights.

Subjects who were aged 25\u00b174 y when they\ndied and 10,149 participated in the personal inter-\nview.24,25 Participants underwent an extensive perso-\nnal interview at both baseline and follow-up, a\ndetailed baseline medical examination and at follow-\nup, measurement of weight and blood pressure. More\ndetailed descriptions of the design, sample and mea-\nOur original analytical sample was limited to the\nbaseline (NHANES I); were white or African-Amer-\nican (Hispanics, Asians and other races were\nexcluded); had a measured weight at follow-up;\nwere not pregnant at baseline or follow-up; had not\nbeen pregnant in the last 6 mo at baseline or the last\n12 mo at follow-up (pregnancy status in the last 6 mo\nwas asked only at baseline) and who did not have their\n\u00aerst birth (live or stillborn) at the age of 15 y or\nyounger. Choosing 45 y as the upper limit was\ndesigned to limit the sample to women of childbearing\nage, and to make the present analysis comparable to\nthe prospective study of Williamson et al,13 which the\ncurrent study extends by examining how the parity-\nweight relationship they identi\u00aeed using these data is\nmodi\u00aeed by sociodemographic and behavioral vari-\nables.\nThe major independent variable of interest was\nparity change, that is, the difference between the\nreported number of live births at baseline and at\nfollow-up. At the baseline interview, women who\nsaid they had ever been pregnant were asked to\nreport separately their total number of pregnancies,\nmiscarriages and live births. To increase privacy, a\nself-administered reproductive history questionnaire\nwas used at follow-up, although 20% of respondents\nopted to have the interviewer read the questions to\nthem instead.15 Women who reported ever having\nbeen pregnant were asked: `How old were you when\nyour \u00aerst child was born? This means the \u00aerst child\nborn alive or stillborn'; `How old were you when your\nlast child was born?'; `How many live births have you\nhad?'; `Have you ever had a miscarriage?' and `How\nmany miscarriages have you had?' In addition, as part\nof the personal interview, women were asked, `How\nmany children living or deceased have you had?\nRemember not to include adopted or stepchildren.'\nFollowing Williamson et al,13 we used other infor-\nmation on reproductive history to adjudicate\nresponses in which fewer live births were reported\nat follow-up than at baseline, or where there was an\nincrease in parity but inconsistency in other reproduc-\ntive history variables (for example, the mother's\nreported age when she had her last child was lower\nthan her baseline age). We corrected 64 of 69 cases\nwith the birth discrepancies and 29 of the 101 cases\nwith other discrepancies: the other 77 cases could not\nbe adjudicated and were deleted from the sample. An\nadditional 150 women who had missing values for one\nor more of the variables used in the sociodemographic\nregression model were excluded as well, leaving a\nand 418 African-American women).\nFor white women, parity change between baseline\nand follow-up was categorized as none, one, or two or\nmore. For African-Americans, we collapsed the latter\ntwo categories into one because of their small sample\nsize.\nWeight change and the likelihood of substantial\nweight gain were the two dependent variables exam-\nined. Weight change was de\u00aened as weight at follow-\nup minus weight at baseline, using measurements (in\nkg) on calibrated scales taken by trained personnel.\n`Substantial weight gain' was de\u00aened analytically as\nan increase of more than 25 pounds (11.4 kg) between\nbaseline and follow-up. This cut-off was chosen to\nhave a minimum cell size (for white subjects) of 20\nwomen with both substantial weight gain and a parity\nincrease of two or more, which was needed to exam-\nine interactions with other variables. Data also were\nanalyzed with other cut-offs for substantial weight\ngain, such as that used by Williamson et al,13 which\nprovided similar but less stable results. Body mass\nindex (BMI) change was not used as an outcome\nvariable due to increasing awareness that the use of\nratios as response variables in regression analyses can\nlead to spurious results and that adjusting for the\ndenominator measure (in this case height) by includ-\ning it as a covariate in the regression is preferred.27,28\nExamining how sociodemographic and behavioral\nfactors modi\u00aeed the relationship between parity\nincrease and weight gain involved the testing of\ninteractions. Eight sociodemographic covariates and\ntheir interactions with parity change in relation to\nweight gain were examined. These included baseline\nweight; baseline parity (continuous, truncated at 11 as\nthere were very few women with parities greater than\n11 and differential effects were not expected for these\nhigher parities); baseline age (y); employment status\nat baseline (employed or not); marital status at base-\nParity associated weight gain\nWS Wolfe et al\nline (married or not); rural versus metropolitan resi-\ndence (based on where they `lived most of their life'\nas answered at follow-up, or based on size of place\nwhere they resided at baseline if the follow-up\nresponse was missing in the data); family income at\nbaseline (six ordinal categories) and educational level\nat baseline (continuous from 5\u00b117 y, truncated at both\nends). We adjusted for three additional covariates in\nall regression models examined: baseline height (in\ncm), the square of the subject's age to adjust for the\ncurvilinearity of the relationship between body weight\nand age, and the number of years between the baseline\nand follow-up measurements as a control for the\nduration of opportunity for weight change. Both\nheight squared and parity squared were also examined\nbut were not included in further analyses, as the\nrelationship between height and parity with weight\ngain showed no evidence of curvature. Continuous\nvariables were centered at meaningful values in their\nmiddle or near their means to make the regression\ncoef\u00aecients easier to interpret (height was centered at\nyears to follow-up at 10 y; education at 12 y; income\nforms of these variables were used to create the\ninteraction terms.\nThree behavioral variables and their interactions\nwith parity change in relation to weight change were\nexamined: cigarette smoking, recreational exercise\nand nonrecreational physical activity \u00b1 all using base-\nline values to assure that the behavior occurred before\nany weight change (the sample was too small to\ninclude change in these behaviors over the 10 y).\nSmoking status was treated as a dichotomous variable,\nsmoker or nonsmoker. We grouped former smokers\nwith never smokers, because of studies that have\nfound former smokers to be neither heavier nor\nfatter than never smokers30,31 and because there\nwere too few former smokers to examine them sepa-\nrately. Smoking was not assessed at baseline for a\nlarge proportion of the sample. For these cases,\nNCHS's retrospective determination of baseline\nsmoking status using smoking information from the\nfollow-up questionnaire was used (the 42 cases in our\nsample for whom baseline smoking status could not\nbe determined from either questionnaire were treated\nas missing rather than using NCHS's imputed values).\nPhysical activity was assessed with two three-level\nquestions: `Do you get much exercise in things you do\nfor recreation?' (much exercise, moderate exercise, or\nlittle or no exercise) and `In your usual day, aside\nfrom recreation, how active are you?' (very active,\nmoderately active or quite inactive). Two dummy\nvariables were created for each question, with the\nmoderate group as the reference group. Because one-\nday caloric consumption was available for only a\nportion of the sample, it was not included in the\nanalysis.\nWe used multiple linear and logistic regression\nprocedures to determine how the relationship between\nparity increase and weight gain was modi\u00aeed by\nsociodemographic and behavioral variables.32 Using\na standard statistical package,33 we examined two\nregression models for each dependent variable\n(weight change and substantial weight gain). In the\n\u00aerst model, we examined 12 sociodemographic and\nbiological variables (11 described previously plus\nparity change) and looked speci\u00aecally for interactions\nbetween parity change and the following: baseline\nweight, parity, age, employment status, marital status,\nfamily income, educational level and rural/urban resi-\ndence. We used a P-value of 0.10 to screen interaction\nterms so as not to miss any important interactions.29 In\nthe second model, after adjusting for the sociodemo-\ngraphic variables and their interactions that had a\nP ` 0.10, we added the three behavioral variables\n(cigarette smoking, recreational exercise and nonrec-\nreational physical activity) and their interactions with\nparity increase. We used separate regression models\nfor whites and African-Americans, because there were\nnot enough African-Americans to examine racial\ndifferences in the same model using three-way inter-\nactions.\nTo provide nationally representative results we\nused NCHS-generated sample weights. The possible\neffects of in\u00afuential (extreme) observations on the\nregression estimates were examined by using standard\ndiagnostic tests for leverage29 and by examining the\nmodels with and without the most in\u00afuential cases.\nBecause the results changed little without the extreme\ncases, all cases were included. Tests for collinearity\nalso were performed and no problems were detected.29\nBecause the NHANES study design used complex\ncluster sampling that required adjustment of the stan-\ndard errors for inferential statistics,34 we adjusted for\nthe design effects of cluster sampling using SUDAAN\nResults\nSample characteristics and parity-associated weight\ngain\nTable 1 shows that weight gain from baseline to\nfollow-up averaged 4.4 kg for white women and\n5.5 kg for African-American women; in both cases\nthe great majority of the subjects had no increase in\nparity, most having completed childbearing (all sub-\njects were at least 25 y at baseline). Almost a third of\nwhite women and slightly more than half of African-\nAmerican women were overweight at follow-up.\nParity-associated weight gain was considerable in\nwhites, and was greater in African-American women.\nAmong white women, after adjusting for baseline\nparity and the other sociodemographic variables,\nweight gain for non-employed married metropolitan\nwomen averaged 4.2 kg for those with no change in\nparity, compared to 4.7 kg for those with a parity\nincrease of one child and 7.4 kg for those with a parity\nParity associated weight gain\nWS Wolfe et al\nincrease of two or more children (Table 2). Overall,\nweight gain averaged 5.5 kg for those with a parity\nincrease of one or more (result not shown). Among\nAfrican-American women, adjusted weight gain for\nthose with no change in parity averaged 4.9 kg,\ncompared to 7.2 kg for those with a parity increase\nof one or more.\nThe probability of substantial weight gain (more\nthan 11.4 kg between baseline and follow-up) also\nrose with parity increase. White women with a\nparity increase of two or more were almost twice as\nlikely to experience substantial weight gain as those\nwith no change in parity (Table 3). However, the\nprobability increased only slightly for those with a\nparity increase of just one. Among African-American\nwomen, those with an increase in parity were about\n\u00aeve times as likely to experience substantial weight\ngain as those with no parity increase.\nModi\u00aecation of parity-associated weight gain by socio-\ndemographic and behavioral factors\nTable 2 presents the predicted weight gains, and Table\n3 the predicted probabilities of substantial weight\ngain, for each of the sociodemographic and behavioral\nvariables that interacted with parity increase at\nP ` 0.10. Although the values in the tables were to\nillustrate general trends for the whole sample, the\nactual values shown, unless otherwise speci\u00aeed, are\nthose for non-employed, married women residing in\nmetropolitan areas when the other covariates were set\nat their middle values (the full regression models are\nnot shown but are available from the authors).\nFor whites, a parity increase of two or more was\nassociated with greater weight gain in women with\nhigher baseline weight compared to those with lower\nbaseline weight, in non-employed compared to\nemployed women, and in non-married compared to\nmarried women (Table 2). For example, white women\nwho were not employed gained an additional 3.2 kg\nwith a parity increase of two or more compared to\nthose with no parity increase, while employed women\ngained only an additional 0.2 kg. Smoking also inter-\nacted with parity increase in its effect on weight gain\nin white women, but with mixed results. Among\nwomen with a parity increase of two or more, smokers\ngained less additional weight (when compared to\nwomen with no parity increase) than nonsmokers,\nbut among women with a parity increase of one,\nsmokers gained much more additional weight.\nTable 1 Characteristics of the analytical sample by race and parity change categorya\nParity change in whites Parity change in African-Americans\nNone\nOne\nTwo or More\nT\notal\nNone\nOne or More\nT\notal\nBody weight variables\nAge and parity variables\nOther demographic variables\nBehavioral variables\nSmoker (%)\nPhysical activity (%)\naValues are weighted to re\u00afect national probabilities.\nbAdjusted for y to follow-up.\ndHaving a body mass index above the National Center for Health Statistics 85th percentile (27.3) as determined by NHANES II national\nParity associated weight gain\nWS Wolfe et al\nAmong African-Americans, a parity increase of one\nor more was associated with greater weight gain in\nwomen with lower baseline weight, in those with\nlower incomes, and in nonsmokers. Smokers in this\ngroup not only gained less weight than nonsmokers,\nbut they also gained far less than smokers with no\nincrease in parity.\nTable 3 shows that among white women, being not\nemployed, unmarried, in a rural residence, with lower\neducational attainment, having fewer children at base-\nline and having a higher level of nonrecreational\nphysical activity at baseline, all increased the prob-\nability of gaining more than 11.4 kg given an increase\nin parity of two or more (and for marital status, also\nfor a parity increase of one). Younger age increased\nthe probability of substantial weight gain given an\nincrease in parity of one.\nAmong African-Americans, the effect of a parity\nincrease of one or more on the probability of gaining\nmore than 11.4 kg was similar to a parity increase of\ntwo or more among whites. Those with lower educa-\ntional attainment and fewer children at baseline were\nmore likely to have a substantial weight gain. In\naddition, older women were more likely to experience\nsubstantial weight gain with an increase in parity than\nwere their younger counterparts.\nDiscussion\nConcern about the increased prevalence of obesity has\nheightened interest in the relationship between parity\nand weight. Previous studies have shown that parity-\nassociated weight gain, that is, the weight gain related\nto having children, is fairly small, about 1 kg per\nchild.11 In this prospective study we found that\nparity-associated weight gain for white women aver-\naged 0.5 kg for those with an increase of one child and\n3.2 kg for those with an increase of two or more.\nAmong African-American women, the average parity-\nTable 2 Differences in parity-associated weight gain for selected sociodemographic and behavioral subgroups of women\nPredicted10-year weight gain (kg)\nWhite women African-American women\nVariable No increase\nin parity\nParity increase\np-valuea Parity increase\nof !2 children\np-valueb No increase\nin parity\nParity increase\nof !1children\np-valuec\nSociodemographic and biological variablesd\nBehavioral variablesf\nap-value for interaction between `parity increase of 1' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\nbp-value for interaction between `parity increase of !2' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\ncp-value for interaction between `parity increase of !1' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\ndPredicted weight gains for interactions with parity change with a p-value less than 0.10 in a linear regression model that included\nbaseline weight, parity, rural-urban residence, employment status, income, education, marital status, age, age squared, height, years\nto follow-up, parity change and interactions between the \u00aerst eight of these and parity change (R2  6.4% for whites, R2  16.5% for\nAfrican-Americans).

Predicted weight gains for three different levels of each are\npresented in order to show the direction of the interaction.

Our \u00aending that parity-associated weight gain\nwas greater in African-Americans than in whites\nwell as our own cross-sectional analysis of NHANES\nII data.14 In the present study, we also found that\nAfrican-Americans differed from whites in the way\nthat certain variables affected weight gain. These\ndifferences may re\u00afect cultural beliefs and practices,\nor biological factors. On the other hand, they may be\ndue in part to our inability to separate the effect of a\nparity increase of one from that of two or more among\nAfrican-Americans (as we did among whites) due to\nsample size limitations. The small size of the African-\nAmerican sample requires that these results be treated\nwith caution. No large prospective surveys with mea-\nsured weights that include larger samples of African-\nAmericans are available for analysis or for compar-\nison with our results.\nTable 3 Differences in the probability of experiencing substantial weight gain over 10 years for selected sociodemographic and\nbehavioral subgroups of women\nPredicted probability (%) of gaining b 25 lbs (11.4 Kg)\nWhite women African-American women\nVariable No increase\nin parity\nParity increase\np-valuea Parity increase\nof !2 children\np-valueb No increase\nin parity\nParity increase\nof !1children\np-valuec\nSociodemographic and biological variablesd\nBehavioral variablesf\nNonrecreational physical activity\nap-value for interaction between `parity increase of 1' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\nbp-value for interaction between `parity increase of !2' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\ncp-value for interaction between `parity increase of !1' versus `no increase in parity' with variable listed.\ndPredicted probabilities of gaining more than 25 pounds (11.4 kg) for interactions with parity change with a p-value less than 0.10 in a\nlogistic regression model that included baseline weight, parity, rural-urban residence, employment status, income, education, marital\nstatus, age, age squared, height, y to follow-up, parity change, and interactions between the \u00aerst eight of these and parity change\n(R2  3.7% for whites, R2  13.3% for African-Americans).

No behavioral\ninteraction with p-values less than 0.10 were found for African-Americans.\nParity associated weight gain\nWS Wolfe et al\nAge. Among whites, younger compared to older\nwomen were more likely to experience substantial\nparity-associated weight gain with a parity increase of\none, while among African-Americans, the opposite\nwas found. Findings in the literature about the mod-\ni\u00aecation of parity-associated weight gain by age are\nlimited and con\u00aficting and available only for whites.\nOne study found that older women retain more weight\npostpartum,20 but another found that gestational\nweight gain, which is correlated with postpartum\nweight retention, tends to be higher in younger than\nMarital status. The \u00aending in this study that white\nwomen who were not married (never married, sepa-\nrated/divorced or widowed) tended to gain more\nweight over time than those who were married,\nespecially if they had an increase in parity, might be\nexplained by the lack of spousal and other social\nsupport for unmarried mothers. Such a situation may\nexacerbate parity effects on weight gain by making\nexercise and the preparation of healthy meals more\ndif\u00aecult. The presence of a spouse may also operate as\na social control mechanism, with encouragement of\npostpartum weight loss by the spouse. Greater post-\npartum weight retention in unmarried than in married\nwhite women also was reported by Parker and\nAbrams16; in contrast, another report14 found greater\nparity-associated weight in married women, but only\nEmployment. Our \u00aending that being employed\nappeared to lessen the effect of a parity increase of\ntwo or more on weight gain among white women\ncould be attributed to greater concern with body\nimage among employed women. Swedish women\nwho returned to work soon after pregnancy also\nretained less weight than women who stayed\nhome.20,39 Similarly, a nationally representative\nsurvey of white women in the US also found an\ninverse association between employment and parity-\nassociated weight.14 Another explanation for the\neffect of employment may involve energy expenditure\nat work or the structured lifestyle that employment\nimposes.\nEducation and income. Both white and African-Amer-\nicanwomenshowedsimilareffectsforeducation:women\nwith less education had higher risk of substantial weight\ngain with an increase in parity than better educated\nwomen. In addition, among African-Americans, lower\nincome women averaged higher weight gain than women\nwith higher incomes. These results are consistent with the\n\u00aendings of other studies suggesting that in both whites\nand African-Americans, women of lower socioeconomic\nstatus tend to retain more weight postpartum.16 Higher\neducation may provide knowledge or resource in\u00afuences\non postpartum weight loss.\nResidence. No studies other than the authors' pre-\nvious work,14 which also reported greater parity-\nassociated weight in rural women, could be found to\ncompare with our \u00aending that rural white women with\na parity increase of two or more were more likely than\ntheir metropolitan counterparts to experience substan-\ntial weight gain. However, previous studies have\nreported both greater weight and greater parity\namong rural compared to urban women.41\u00b143 The\nisolation and lack of resources in rural areas may\ninhibit postpartum weight loss.\nBaseline weight. Among African-American women,\nparity-associated weight gain was greater in those\nwith lower baseline weights, while in white women,\nthe opposite was found for those with a parity increase\nof two or more. Other studies have suggested that\nwomen with higher prepregnant weights tend to gain\nless during pregnancy38,40 and therefore may retain\nless weight postpartum.10\nBaseline parity. The \u00aending that baseline parity was\ninversely related to the risk of substantial weight gain\nmight re\u00afect a history of sizable gains after earlier\nbirths that made women with more children less\npredisposed to gain substantial additional weight. A\n1990 report found gestational weight gain to be higher\nin primiparas than in multiparas.36 However, another\ninvestigation found that African-American women\nwith higher parity retained more weight postpartum\nthan those with lower parity, but the study did not\nadjust for other variables.16\nSmoking. Among both African-Americans with a\nparity increase of one or more and white women\nwith an increase of two or more, parity-associated\nweight gain was greater in nonsmokers than in smo-\nkers. A similar trend was found in an earlier study of\nwhite women at six months postpartum18 and in a\nnationally representative survey of US women.14\nAdditionally, women who smoke while pregnant\ntend to have lower gestational weight gain,11 which\nis correlated with postpartum weight retention. How-\never, among white women in our study whose parity\nincreased by one child, parity-associated weight gain\nwas greater in smokers than in nonsmokers. This\nunexpected \u00aending persisted when outliers were\nomitted and when different measures of smoking\n(inclusion of imputed values, follow-up values instead\nof baseline) were used. It is not clear why women who\nhad one additional child and smoked gained large\namounts of weight. One possible explanation is that\nmore smokers who had a parity increase of one, quit\nsmoking (a variable associated with weight gain for\nwhich we could not control). However, we found that\nthe percentages who quit smoking were similar across\nthe parity-change subgroups. It may be that other\nunmeasured variables such as stress or intensity of\nParity associated weight gain\nWS Wolfe et al\nsmoking differed in this subgroup. Our results suggest\nthat weight, parity and smoking interact in a complex\nmanner and that further work is needed to understand\nthese relationships.\nPhysical activity. Our \u00aending that, among white\nwomen, those with moderate or high nonrecreational\nphysical activity levels were more likely to experience\nsubstantial weight gain with a parity increase of two\nor more was unexpected. This \u00aending persisted even\nafter we deleted the most in\u00afuential cases, but was\neliminated when follow-up, rather than baseline,\nvalues for physical activity were used (about half\nthe sample changed their reported activity level\nbetween baseline and follow-up). This unexpected\n\u00aending may, in part, be because the questions regard-\ning physical activity were not speci\u00aec to the type or\nintensity of activity. There are few studies on the\neffect of physical activity on postpartum weight\nretention: one study found physical activity to be\ninversely related to postpartum weight retention, but\nan inverse relationship only in African-Americans.14\nPhysical activity is not thought to affect gestational\nLimitations. The present investigation has several\nlimitations. Although the sample was large enough\nto provide considerable statistical power for whites,\nwas designed to be nationally representative at the\ntime the data were collected, and included measured\nweights and heights, the sample size for African-\nAmericans was limited, the data are over 10 y old\nand changes may have occurred since that time, and\nthe results apply only to women who had an increase\nin parity after age 25 \u00b1 the experience of younger\nwomen may have been different, although adjusting\nfor the age at which women had their \u00aerst child did\nnot change our results. In addition, even for whites the\nsample size was not large enough to examine changes\nin some of the characteristics over time because of the\nlimited numbers of women with a change in parity.\nAlso, the sample size was not large enough to exam-\nine subgroups separately by important variables such\nas age and baseline parity, which would have provided\nmore information than statistically adjusting for them.\nA full understanding of this issue would require\nmeasures of additional factors unavailable in this\ndata set, such as attitudes about weight and \u00aetness,\nsocial support, and gestational weight gain.\nFinally, as in other large epidemiological investiga-\ntions, we could not differentiate whether the relation-\nships we found were due to child bearing or child\nrearing.13 Future research should include detailed\nprospective psychosocial studies and qualitative, in-\ndepth investigations of parity-associated weight gain.\nConclusion\nThe amount of weight gain associated with an\nincrease in parity differed by sociodemographic and\nbehavioral factors, and these patterns differed between\nAfrican-American and white women. Our results\nsuggest that several groups of women may be at\ngreater risk for parity-associated weight gain: Afri-\ncan-Americans, rural residents, those who do not work\noutside the home, who have relatively fewer children,\na lower income, are less educated, and/or unmarried,\nand nonsmokers. In addition, among white women\nspeci\u00aecally, those who are younger or who have\nhigher body weights may be at greater risk. Among\nAfrican-American women, those who are older or\nwho have lower body weights may be at more risk.\nHaving insights into which women are at risk for\nweight gain may help target and design interventions\nto prevent postpartum weight retention and obesity in\nwomen.\n"
