For example, displays of anger\nincrease perceptions of dominance, whereas displays of fear and surprise reduce such\ninferences (Knutson, 1996; Marsh, Ambady, and Kleck, 2005; Montepare and Dobish,\n2003). By quickly communicating socially relevant information about interactants'\npersonalities and behavioral tendencies, these expressions facilitate the smooth functioning\nof social interactions and relationships.\nOne interpersonal domain in which individuals typically seek to acquire as much\ninformation as possible about others, and often without directly asking, is that of mate\nchoice. When choosing a romantic partner, individuals prioritize certain dispositional traits\nand seek mates who exhibit these desired qualities, which, as a result, are perceived as\nincreasing a target's sexual attractiveness (Li and Kenrick, 2006). For example, individuals\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\ntend to seek out--and find attractive--mates who exhibit gender dimorphic qualities (i.e.,\ntraits perceived as indicating masculinity or femininity; Buss, 2008; see also Rhodes,\n2006). Evolutionary mating theory suggests that these desired characteristics are likely to\nhave conferred genetic fitness advantages to their possessors (or their possessors'\noffspring) in ancestral environments, and thus increase possessors' mate value (see Buss,\n2008). As a result, it is adaptive for women be attracted to opposite-sex partners who\nexhibit traits such as social dominance, and for men to be attracted to opposite-sex partners\nwho exhibit traits such as youth, amiability, and receptivity to sexual relationships (e.g.,\nBuss, 2008). In a similar manner, emotion expressions that communicate dispositional\ninformation relevant to an expresser's mate value (e.g., dominance, approachability) might\nbe expected to influence expressers' perceived attractiveness.\nSupporting this expectation, a recent series of studies found that distinct emotion\nexpressions have large and gender-divergent effects on perceived attractiveness (Tracy and\nBeall, 2011). The emotions examined in this prior research were happiness, pride, and\nshame--all thought to communicate information relevant to mate value. Though\nparticipants in these studies were not asked to report specific reasons for their attraction to\nthe emotion expressions examined, findings were largely consistent with evolutionary\nexplanations of mate choice. Specifically, happiness--an emotion that conveys femininity\nand sexual receptivity (Brown et al., 1986; Hareli, Shomrat, and Hess, 2009)--was judged\nto be highly attractive when displayed by women, but considerably less so when displayed\nby men. Pride displays, in contrast, increased the relative attractiveness of men more than\nwomen, consistent with the pride display's cross-cultural associations with high-status\n(Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Shariff, Tracy, and Markusoff, 2012; Tiedens, Ellsworth, and\nMesquita, 2000; Tracy, Shariff, Zhao, and Henrich, 2013) and its prototypical features of\nexpanded chest and generally large appearance, known to increase masculinity and male\nattractiveness (Li and Kenrick, 2006). In addition, female shame displays were judged as\nless attractive than female happy displays but more attractive than female pride and neutral\ndisplays, consistent with the assumption that shame's submissiveness connotations increase\ndisplayers' apparent approachability, and thus the attractiveness of shame-displaying\nwomen.\nIn contrast to these findings, which fit with evolutionarily derived theoretical\nexpectations, results that emerged regarding the attractiveness of male shame displays were\nmore unexpected. Men displaying shame were judged as more attractive than men\ndisplaying other emotions. Specifically, across samples ranging broadly in age and\nethnicity, shame-displaying men were rated as equally or more attractive than men\ndisplaying neutrality or happiness, and only slightly less attractive than men displaying\npride. This pattern of results was observed first in a study that asked participants to view\nand rate the attractiveness of one opposite-sex person displaying, in a photo, one of the four\nexpressions, and, second, in a study in which three different samples of participants viewed\nand rated the sexual attractiveness of either 40 or 80 different opposite-sex targets, each\ndisplaying one of the four expressions (such that, across participants, there were 30\ndifferent versions of each emotion expression viewed in total; Tracy and Beall, 2011).\nThis well-replicated finding is surprising because shame is known to convey low-\nstatus (Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Shariff, Tracy, and Markusoff, 2012), and women tend to\nview status as an important characteristic when evaluating the attractiveness of a potential\npartner (Li and Kenrick, 2006). Communicating status information through emotional\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nexpressions would have been adaptive in humans' status-driven ancestral societies, as such\nmessages can help establish and solidify one's position within the social hierarchy\n(Martens, Tracy, and Shariff, 2012). By conveying one's high status, the pride expression,\nfor example, may benefit displayers by informing others that he or she should receive\ndeference (Shariff and Tracy, 2009). Correspondingly, observers of pride displays might\nbenefit by acquiring information about which group members are likely to make good\nleaders, or which members are particularly knowledgeable or skilled and thus should be\ncopied or followed (Martens and Tracy, 2013). In contrast, by signaling low status, shame\ndisplays should function to communicate poorer genetic fitness. As a result, evolutionary\ntheory would predict that men who show shame should be perceived by women as less\nattractive.\nHowever, in addition to its low-status message, shame communicates other trait\ninformation, which might indicate higher mate value: trustworthiness and a respect for\nsocial norms. Shame displays may have originated as a human form of the more ancient\nsubmission displays seen across a wide range of primate species, which function to appease\nconspecifics by signaling the displayer's awareness of others' relatively greater power or\nThroughout humans' evolutionary history, the failure to accede to a stronger or otherwise\nmore powerful adversary would have major costs, including survival (MacLean, 1990), so\nit makes sense that humans would have evolved to show an appeasing expression like\nshame in such situations.\nOver time, the shame-submission display likely shifted toward a response to failure\nor social transgression (common shame-eliciting situations; Lewis, Alessandri, and\nSullivan, 1992); in these situations, the display would serve the same appeasing function by\ncommunicating the transgressor's recognition of his or her violation and regret for it. This\nmessage would likely help avert punishment for the transgression. Eventually, the shame\ndisplay may have come to convey not only regret for the violation of a social norm, but also\none's respect for the norm that was violated (Keltner et al., 1997), and perhaps even a\ngeneral tendency to respect social norms, broadly speaking. Though it seems somewhat\ncounterintuitive that shame displays might communicate both acceptance of norms and also\nthat an individual has broken a norm, there is good reason to think that this is exactly the\ncomplicated message shame evolved to send. In many cultures, displaying shame is\nconsidered to be an important way of demonstrating one's commitment to the group, and of\nprotecting a transgressor from overly negative social appraisals and retribution following a\ntransgression (Haidt and Keltner, 1999; Keltner et al., 1997). The theoretical rationale for\nthis account is that all humans make occasional social transgressions or suffer failures, but\nexpressing shame allows them to demonstrate their awareness that these behaviors are\ntrespasses. The real threat to group harmony, in this view, is the individual who does not\nshow shame.\nBased on this account, displays of shame may signal not only that the individual is\nlow in status and has corresponding poor mate value, but also that he or she respects the\nlocal social norms and thus can be trusted--a message that should indicate high mate value.\nThis latter message may be what accounts for the prior evidence suggesting that women are\nattracted to men who display shame (Tracy and Beall, 2011).\nThus far, we have suggested that attractiveness judgments are guided by evolved\nmating strategies (Buss, 1987). However, the impact of these strategies on mating behavior\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nis expected to vary depending on social and cultural factors (Tovee, Swami, Furnham, and\nMangalparsad, 2006). That is, the functioning of even evolved psychological mechanisms\nis sensitive to variations in local ecologies (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992), and we would\nexpect mate preferences based on dispositional qualities to be subject to differences in\ncultural norms and practices. For example, Li, Valentine, and Patel (2010) found that\nalthough women across cultures value similar personality traits in potential male partners,\nSingaporean women place higher value on certain traits, such as a man's social status,\ncompared to American women.\nGiven the complexity of messages communicated by shame--both low-status and\nhigh respect for social norms and trustworthiness--this expression may be particularly\nlikely to be judged differently in different cultural contexts, depending on the relative value\nassigned to these two messages. The prior findings demonstrating the attractiveness of male\nshame emerged from studies conducted on several samples of women, ranging broadly in\nage. However, all these women were from North American populations, raising the\nquestion of whether this effect would generalize to cultural contexts where women place a\nrelatively higher value on a man's social status, or a lower value on his respect for social\nnorms or trustworthiness.\nIn the present research, we sought to understand the puzzling attractiveness of male\nshame by asking two questions: (1) Do male shame displays communicate genetic fitness,\nor high mate value (i.e., are male shame displays most attractive to women who are most\nlikely to benefit reproductively from mating with shame displayers?); and (2) To what\nextent does the attractiveness of male shame vary across populations that hold different\nvalues regarding shame and the messages it sends?\nTo address these questions, we used two methodological approaches. In our first\nstudy, we adopted the conception-risk assessment approach. A growing body of evidence\nindicates that women's sexual preferences vary across the menstrual cycle, such that\nwomen are most attentive to markers of \"good genes\" in potential mates when conception\nis most likely--that is, the days immediately preceding and during ovulation (Baker and\nBased on this account, if the male shame expression is a reliable signal of good genetic\nquality (by virtue of communicating the displayer's respect for social norms and potential\ntrustworthiness), then women at the highest-risk for conception stage of the cycle should\nfind shame-displaying men more attractive than women at a low-conception-risk stage.\nHowever, past work has shown that women at peak fertility are highly attracted to\ndominant men (Little, Jones, and Burriss, 2007), suggesting that at least one of the\nmessages communicated by shame (submissiveness) is likely to be indicative of poor\ngenetic fitness. Based on this finding, women at high conception risk might be expected to\nbe less attracted to shame displayers. However, because this prior study did not examine\nthe impact of conception risk on perceived attractiveness of shame or other submissive\ndisplays, but only on dominant-appearing men, it remains unclear whether the complexity\nof positive and negative messages communicated by shame result in a net gain or loss in\nterms of mate value.\nIn Study 1 we addressed this question by testing whether women who are at high\nrisk for conception, based on their current stage of the menstrual cycle, are more attracted\nto men displaying shame compared to women at a lower risk for conception. We also tested\nwhether women's risk of conception (based on cycle) influences their attraction to men\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\ndisplaying other emotion expressions (i.e., pride, happiness, and neutrality), to determine\nwhether any shift in preference for shame-displaying men could be attributed to a more\ngeneral tendency for women at high-conception risk to judge male targets as more\nattractive compared to women at low risk.\nIn our second study, we adopted an approach from the cross-cultural psychological\nliterature, in which individuals from maximally divergent cultures are compared, to\nexamine the extent to which certain psychological phenomena might be considered human\nuniversals (see Norenzayan and Heine, 2005). Inherent in this approach is the assumption\nthat if a particular psychological preference is found across groups expected to show\ncultural differences in the relevant trait, then this preference is likely to be a human\nuniversal, and thus may reflect evolutionary processes. Applying this perspective to the\ncurrent research question, if male shame displays are judged as attractive by women living\nin a cultural setting with markedly different customs and values from North America, and,\nin particular, different cultural attitudes about shame and its associated message of low\nstatus, this would suggest that these displays may be universally attractive, and thus\nprovide support for the invariant genetic fitness explanation. Conversely, if we find cultural\nvariation in the attractiveness of male shame, such that women from cultures holding\ndifferent attitudes about the importance of men attaining and demonstrating high status do\nnot find male shame displays attractive, it would support the hypothesis that the\nexpression's attractiveness in North American samples is dependent on culturally specific\nvalues about mate-relevant characteristics within that local ecology.\nThus, in Study 2, we compared the attractiveness judgments of male shame displays\nmade by North American women with those made by women from India. We targeted\nIndian women as a comparison population for several reasons. First, India is one of the\nvery few non-Western countries where researchers have examined recognition of the shame\ndisplay, and produced findings suggesting that shame is recognized equally well by Indians\nand North Americans (Haidt and Keltner, 1999). This finding ensures that any cultural\ndifferences observed in the attractiveness of male shame displays, between the U.S. and\nIndia, cannot be attributed to cultural differences in how the display is recognized.\nSecond, there are major cultural differences between India and North America in\nattitudes toward shame. In North American cultures, shame is considered a \"hidden\"\nemotion, typically not discussed or even acknowledged by those experiencing it (Lewis,\n1971; Scheff, Retzinger, and Ryan, 1989). In fact, shame has been rated by North\nAmericans as the most painful emotion to experience (Lazarus, 1991, p. 557). Not\nsurprisingly then, the shame expression tends to be suppressed by individuals from these\ncultures, even in situations of major public failure (Tracy and Matsumoto, 2008). In\ncontrast, in India, as in many Asian cultures, shame is a highly valued emotion, considered\nessential to social harmony and \"making the world move along\" (see Rozin, 2003, p. 278).\nIndividuals from these cultures tend to reliably display the shame expression in response to\npublic failure (Tracy and Matsumoto, 2008). For these reasons, we might expect Indian\nwomen to find shame-displaying men even more attractive than American women.\nHowever, the third reason for our choice of India as a comparison culture would suggest\nthe opposite hypothesis.\nShame and pride are two emotions that, more than any others, communicate\ninformation about status (Shariff and Tracy, 2009; Steckler and Tracy, 2014). These\nexpressions send strong messages of low and high status, respectively, and they do so when\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nperceived at both an implicit and explicit level, and across highly divergent cultural\nattractiveness of men displaying these status-connoting expressions may be particularly\naffected by cultural variations in attitudes about status, and the importance placed upon the\nstatus of a potential mate. Prior research suggests that women's preference for high- versus\nlow-status partners depends on features of their local ecology; American women tend to\nprioritize a potential male partner's status less than do women from other cultures (Li et al.,\n2011). More broadly, re-analyses of results from a survey examining over 9,000 individuals\nin 37 cultures worldwide (Buss et al., 1990) showed that women's tendency to seek high-\nstatus male partners varies greatly by culture (Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Women from\ncultures with reduced reproductive freedom (i.e., little access to birth control or abortion)\nand fewer educational or economic opportunities for women were found to place a greater\nemphasis on status as an indicator of a male partner's attractiveness, compared to women\nfrom cultures with greater access to these liberties. When women can independently\nacquire the resources needed to support themselves and their offspring, it becomes less\nimportant that they find a high-status mate who will do so for them.\nFrom this perspective, we might attribute the findings of male shame's\nattractiveness among North American women to the fact that these women are not\nnecessarily seeking high-status partners, allowing them to downplay the low-status\nmessage conveyed by shame, and focus on the expression's more positive associations.\nConversely, women in India tend to have considerably fewer educational opportunities, and\na lesser representation in the labor force, compared to women in the U.S. (United Nations\nDevelopment Programme [UNDP], 2011), making Indian women particularly likely to\nvalue and emphasize high status in potential mates. Based on this account, we would\npredict that Indian women would find male shame displays particularly unattractive. Study\n2 tested these competing hypotheses.\nIn both studies, we also assessed individual differences in mating strategies using\nthe Socio-Sexual Orientation Scale-Revised (SOI-R; Penke and Asendorpf, 2008) in order\nto control for individual differences in participants' orientation toward a short-term versus\nlong-term mating strategy. Previous research suggests that these strategies influence\npreferences in the mating domain (including preferences for status-relevant traits; e.g.,\nWaynforth, Delwadia, and Camm, 2005) and can vary across culture and ovulatory stage\n(Schaller and Murray, 2008; see Haselton and Gangestad, 2006). Thus, to ensure that any\neffects found cannot be attributed to differences in mating strategy, SOI-R scores were\ntreated as a covariate in all between-subjects analyses.1\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and procedure\nAsian, 12% Other) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical TurkTM (see Buhrmester,\n1 In all cases, reported effects held when SOI-R scores were not statistically controlled.\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nKwang, and Gosling, 2011) to participate online in exchange for monetary compensation.\nThirty-three women who were not heterosexual were excluded, given our research goals of\nexamining heterosexual attraction,2 and one participant was excluded for giving an\nattractiveness rating of \"1\" to 38 of the 40 target photographs.\nOf the remaining 138 women, we excluded 30 women who indicated that they\neither experienced irregular menstrual cycles,3 were pregnant, or were using any form of\nhormonal contraception (see Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011).\nWomen were shown a calendar of the current and previous 2 months and asked to\nuse it in facilitating their response to the question: \"How many days has it been since the\nonset of your last period of menses?\" To address concerns raised in previous research\nregarding the validity of assessing menstrual history via self-report (Bean et al., 1979; but\nsee Baker, Denning, Kostin, and Schwartz, 1998), after reporting the date of their most\nrecent menses onset, participants were asked, \"Within how many days are you 100%\nconfident in your above estimate?\"; they responded using a scale ranging from 1 to 7,\nwhere 1 indicated \"0 days (I'm 100% confident in my answer),\" 2 indicated \"1 day,\" 3\nindicated \"2 days,\" 4 indicated \"3 days,\" 5 indicated \"4 days,\" 6 indicated \"5 days,\" and 7\nindicated \"More than 5 days (I'm not very confident in my above answer).\" Using these\nconfidence estimates, participants were assigned to one of two conception-risk categories,\nfollowing the 28-day model of the menstrual cycle (Gangestad, and Thornhill, 1998): \"high\nAll additional participants for whom category membership could not be determined\n(high vs. low conception risk) with 100% certainty (n = 34) were excluded. Specifically,\nwe excluded, for example, any participant who indicated that her last menses began 12 days\nago but that she was 100% confident of that estimate within 3 days. In such a case, it was\nassumed that her last period began 9\u00ad15 days ago, and thus that she could not be safely\nincluded in either the high-risk (days 6\u00ad14) or low-risk (days 0\u00ad5 and 15\u00ad28) category. In\ncontrast, any participant who indicated that her last menses began 10 days ago and was\n100% confident within 3 days would be included, because it could be assumed that her\n2 Sexual orientation is not binary; we thus measured this variable using a continuous rating scale (a 1-7 scale\nwhere 1 = \"exclusively heterosexual,\" 4 = \"bisexual,\" and 7 = \"exclusively homosexual\"), allowing\nparticipants to indicate the degree to which they are attracted to members of the opposite sex. Women were\nexcluded from analyses if they rated themselves as a 4 or above on this rating scale; as a result, there were a\nrelatively high number of non-exclusively heterosexual women included.\n3 Though women with irregular cycles are, at times, \"at risk for conception,\" it is impossible to accurately\nestimate the window of high and low conception risk for these women, because our estimations are based on\nthe variation that occurs within a regular 28-day cycle. For this reason, it was necessary to exclude these\nwomen from Study 1, in which the critical tests depended on estimating women's conception risk as\naccurately as possible.\n4 Several previous studies examining the effects of menstrual cycle stage have excluded women who are\ncurrently menstruating or premenstrual (days 0\u00ad4 and 24\u00ad28 since onset) to rule out the possibility that\npsychological effects observed (e.g., mood effects) might be due to hormonal changes associated with the\nmenstrual phase or premenstrual symptoms (see Haselton and Gildersleeve, 2011). Here, we saw no reason to\nexclude these women (n = 20); however, all reported effects hold if these women are excluded from analyses,\nexcept where noted.\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nperiod began 7\u00ad13 days ago, placing her firmly within the high-risk category (days 6\u00ad14).\nThis method of confidence estimation has been used effectively in previous research (Beall\nMaterials\nResearch methods were approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral\nResearch Ethics Board, and informed consent was obtained. Participants viewed photos,\nonline, of 40 men displaying each of four expressions: shame, happiness, pride, and neutral\n(10 photos of each expression). Photos were taken from previous emotion research (Sample\nB, Tracy and Beall, 2011) and portrayed 40 different individuals either in full, from the\nwaist up, or face only. These were collected from online sources (e.g., google.com) by\nresearch assistants blind to the hypotheses, who were trained to identify each expression.\nEmotion-FACS (Ekman and Rosenberg, 2005), as well as criteria developed by Tracy and\nRobins (2007), were used to ensure that each photograph accurately conveyed its intended\nemotion and not any other emotion. Targets portrayed in photos varied in age\n(approximately 18\u00ad49 years) and ethnicity (65% were Caucasian, 8% African American,\n10% Asian, and 17% other). Photos were presented in a randomized order. For each photo,\nparticipants responded to the question, \"How sexually attractive do you find this person?\"\nusing a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Very Unattractive) to 9 (Very Attractive).\nAttractiveness ratings were completed after women responded to questions assessing their\ncurrent risk for conception.\nResults\nMean attractiveness scores for each emotion expression were computed across\nattractiveness ratings of all exemplars of each expression (interrater s ranged from .78\u00ad\n.84).

To understand this\ninteraction, we separately examined the effect of conception risk on attractiveness\njudgments of each expression.\nSpecifically, we conducted four ANCOVAs (controlling for SOI-R), with level of\nconception risk as the fixed factor, predicting attractiveness judgments for each expression.\nThis revealed a significant effect of conception risk for shame-displays; men expressing\nshame were judged as less attractive by women who were at a high risk for conception than\nneutral displays, no significant effects of conception risk emerged, F(1, 64) = 1.17, p = .28,\nrespectively (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

This finding is consistent with the\nhypothesis that shame displays signal poor-quality genes, such that women who are most\nlikely to conceive benefit from not mating with these men. Given that the observed effect\nwas a reduced level of attraction reported by high-risk women, it cannot be attributed to a\ngeneral tendency for high-risk women to find men more attractive. Furthermore, this effect\nseems to be specific to the shame expression.\nThese results lend no support to our account of male shame as attractive because the\ndisplay indicates good genetic fitness. Instead, they suggest that displaying shame may be\nan indicator of poor genetic fitness among men. Thus, the current and previous finding that\nNorth American women find shame-displaying men particularly attractive may be best\nexplained as a byproduct of specific cultural values present in a North American ecology.\nTo support that conclusion, however, we need to examine judgments of shame-\ndisplaying men made by women from other cultural contexts. As mentioned previously,\nAmerican women tend to prioritize a potential male partner's status less than do women\nfrom cultures where women have reduced reproductive freedom (i.e., little access to birth\ncontrol or abortion) and fewer educational or economic opportunities (Li et al., 2011;\nKasser and Sharma, 1999). As a result, North American women may be attracted to men\nexpressing shame because their cultural values allow them to disregard shame's low-status\nsignal (which conveys poor fitness) and instead focus on shame's more pro-social messages\nof appeasement and trustworthiness. In contrast, women from countries where women have\nfewer educational opportunities and a lesser representation in the labor force than in the\nU.S., such as India (UNDP, 2011), might show a relatively weaker attraction to shame-\ndisplaying men. If so, this would support the conclusion of Study 1 that the previously\ndocumented finding of the attractiveness of male shame displays is attributable to cultural\nfactors specific to North American women.\nTo test this possibility, in Study 2 we examined whether the attractiveness of male\nshame displays varies by culture; that is, whether North American women's attraction to\nmale shame differs from that of Indian women.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants, materials, and procedure\nResearch methods were approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral\nResearch Ethics Board, and informed consent was obtained. Participants (total N = 229)\nwere: (a) the 138 American heterosexual women who were recruited for Study 1 (aged 18\u00ad\n42; 73% Caucasian, 10% Asian, 17% Other), including those who had been excluded from\nStudy 1 due to ovulatory stage, irregular menstrual cycles, hormonal birth control use, or\nvolunteered to participate in exchange for monetary compensation on Amazon Mechanical\nTurkTM. All additional participants (i.e., not included in Study 1) reported being\nheterosexual.\nAll participants viewed the same photos, online, as were used in Study 1: 40 men\ndisplaying each of four expressions: shame, happiness, pride, and a neutral control (10\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nmales showing each expression). Photos were again presented in a randomized order, and\nfor each photo, participants responded to the question, \"How sexually attractive do you find\nthis person?\" using a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Very Unattractive) to 9 (Very\nAttractive).8 Women who participated in Study 1 did not make these judgments twice;\nrather, Study 2 draws on these same data, such that 63 participants and their responses\noverlapped between the two studies.\nResults\nAs in Study 1, mean attractiveness scores for each emotion expression were\ncomputed across ratings of all exemplars of each expression (interrater s ranged from .81\u00ad\n.88). To examine whether the effect of emotion expression on attractiveness varied across\ncultural background, we conducted a 4 (emotion) x 2 (cultural identity) mixed measures\nANCOVA (controlling for SOI-R) predicting mean attractiveness ratings. No main effect\nAmerican women do not differ in the extent to which they judge men sexually attractive\nacross the emotion expression displayed.\nHowever, a significant interaction emerged between emotion expression and\nexpressions on attractiveness varied by culture. To better understand this difference, we\nexamined results separately for the U.S. and Indian samples. In the U.S. sample, the same\npattern observed in Study 1 emerged: Shame displays were judged to be more attractive\nboth ps < .001. In addition, shame-displaying men again did not differ significantly in\nmen were judged as significantly more attractive than happy-displaying men, t(135) = 7.42,\nhappy displays were judged as significantly more attractive than neutral, t(136) = 4.62, d =\nHowever, in the Indian sample, a notably different pattern emerged. Here, shame-\ndisplayers were judged to be significantly less attractive than pride-displayers, t(90) = -\nd = 0.40, p < .001. Pride-displayers were more attractive than happy displayers, t(90) =\nhappiness displayers were significantly more attractive than neutral displayers among\nTo more directly test the hypothesis that the attractiveness of male shame displays\nvaries across cultures, we next performed four ANCOVAs with cultural background as the\nfixed factor, controlling for SOI-R, predicting the attractiveness of each expression\nseparately (see Figure 2). Results revealed a significant effect of culture for shame; Indian\nwomen judged men displaying shame to be significantly less attractive than did American\n8 One additional participant was excluded for giving a rating of \"1\" to 39 of the 40 target photographs.\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nemerged for pride, but in the opposite direction; Indian women judged men displaying\npride to be significantly more attractive than did American women, F(1,211) = 6.44, d =\nFigure 2. Estimated marginal mean sexual attractiveness ratings of emotion expressions\n(controlling for SOI-R) shown by 40 different men, as judged by women in the United\nStates and India--Study 2\nNote. n = 229. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.\nThus, Indian women found shame-displaying men relatively unattractive compared\nto American women, despite the fact that Indian culture places a high value on shame and\nshame displays. More broadly, this result suggests that the shame display's attractiveness\nvaries by culture, possibly due to differences in the mate-relevant trait characteristics\nprioritized within each local ecology. Interestingly, the reverse pattern emerged for male\npride displays; Indian women found male pride-displayers more attractive than did\nAmerican women. Given that there was no overall cultural difference in attractiveness\n9 As in Study 1, we also tested whether SOI moderated the effect of conception risk on women's attraction to\nmale shame. We found a significant interaction, F(3, 210) = 6.30, p < .001, indicating that Indian women who\nwere higher in SOI felt a stronger attraction to shame-displaying men, b = -.184, SEb = .093,  = -.133, p <\n.05. However, this same interaction emerged for judgments of neutral expressions, b = -.198, SEb = .083,  =\n-.163, p < .05, suggesting that this effect was not due to any impact of shame, in particular, but rather to a\ngeneral tendency for high SOI Indian women to be particularly attracted to men, regardless of the emotion\nthey are expressing (in fact, a marginal interaction emerged for judgments of pride displays, as well).\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nratings across all targets, these results cannot be attributed to broader cultural differences in\nwomen's ratings of male attractiveness. Rather, this difference seems to be specific to the\nshame and pride displays--the two displays that most strongly convey status information.\nThese results are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shame displays' attractiveness in\nAmerican cultural contexts is partly due to the fact that American women do not place a\nhigh value on the status of a potential mate compared to women from cultures where there\nis less female economic freedom, such as India.\nDiscussion\nThe present research tested competing explanations for the previous finding that\nNorth American women are particularly attracted to men displaying shame. Specifically,\nwe examined whether the attractiveness of male shame displays is best explained by the\nhypothesis that shame displays indicate good genetic fitness, or the hypothesis that North\nAmerican women, in particular, are attracted to male displays of shame as a result of\nparticular features of their local ecology. Results across two studies provide consistent\nsupport for the latter hypothesis.\nMore specifically, Study 1 demonstrated that women at highest risk for\nconception--who tend to be particularly attuned to signals of genetic fitness--are less\nattracted to men displaying shame compared to women at low conception risk. This\nsuggests that the expression's appeal is not likely to be biologically driven and, in fact, that\nshame-displaying men have low mate value, from a genetic standpoint. Past research\nsuggests that women at peak fertility are especially attracted to men who exhibit dominant\ncharacteristics (Little et al., 2007), and given that shame is a low-dominance display, this\ncould be a potential explanation for the findings of Study 1.\nStudy 2 demonstrated a cultural difference in the attractiveness of male shame\ndisplays, with American women showing greater attraction to these displays than Indian\nwomen. This cultural difference may be due to several factors. Specifically, these two\ncultures likely differ in the importance placed on a man's ability to attain high status. Prior\nresearch suggests that women in cultures that allow them the opportunity to acquire the\nresources needed to support themselves and their offspring can be more tolerant of\npotential mates who are low in status (Kasser and Sharma, 1999). Thus, North American\nwomen may be able to find men who display shame attractive, despite the expression's\ncommunication of low-status, because they set aside this implication of the expression and\nfocus on its other, more attractive qualities (e.g., trustworthiness, respect for social norms).\nFuture studies are needed to test whether the perception of these qualities in fact account\nfor the attractiveness of male shame displays among North American women.\nImplications\nThe present findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of human\nemotion expressions and their impact on mate selection. Many emotion expressions\ncommunicate fitness-relevant information to observers, and this may have been an\nimportant factor in their early evolution and persistence. The present findings, however,\nsuggest that the male shame display may indicate poor genetic fitness, and thus that the\nexpression of shame, at least when shown by men, has evolved and persisted for reasons\nother than communicating one's mate value. Given prior research suggesting that shame\nfunctions as an appeasement signal, the shame expression is more likely to have evolved to\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nserve this function; displaying shame in response to social transgression or failure may help\nminimize harm and antagonism from others by communicating the displayer's respect for\nsocial norms and/or others' greater relative power or dominance (Keltner et al., 1997;\nMartens et al., 2012). In situations where such displays are necessary, shame expressions\nhave likely provided a net fitness gain, despite the reproductive fitness loss that may be\nincurred.\nThese findings also have implications for our understanding of the role of status\nsignaling in romantic attraction. Our explanation for American women's propensity to find\nshame-displaying men attractive is that these women do not need to mate with high-status\nmen in order to ensure their own and their offspring's survival, given that American\nwomen typically have equal access to economic and education opportunities (see Kasser\nand Sharma, 1999). The finding that Indian women are less attracted to men showing\nshame (and more attracted to men showing pride) provides some support for this\nexplanation, given that India has considerably lower gender equality than the US (UNDP,\n2011), though more work is needed to directly test this account.\nLimitations and future directions\nOne potential limitation of the current research is that the baseline attractiveness of\nmen in our photo set may have differed by emotion expression condition purely as a result\nof chance (e.g., men showing shame may have been more attractive than those showing\npride regardless of the expression they displayed). However, as noted above, the photo\ncollection procedure used involved the collection of photos by research assistants who were\nblind to hypotheses (see Tracy and Beall, 2011). Therefore, there is no reason to suspect\nthat the photos chosen of individuals displaying shame would be any more or less attractive\nthan the photos of individuals displaying other emotions for any systematic reason,\nespecially given the large number of photos collected. More broadly, by demonstrating\ndifferences in the attractiveness of shame displays (by conception risk and cultural group),\nbut not for overall attractiveness ratings irrespective of emotion (there was no overall effect\nof conception risk or cultural group on attractiveness ratings), our results suggest that the\npresent findings would not emerge irrespective of emotion expression. In other words, if\nmen displaying shame in the photos we used happened to be more attractive than men\ndisplaying other expressions for reasons other than their emotion expression, it is difficult\nto explain why we would have observed the specific effects we did--that women at high\nconception risk found these shame-displaying men less attractive, and that women from\nIndia found these shame-displaying men less attractive.\nAnother methodological limitation, relevant to Study 1, was our assessment of\nwomen's ovulatory cycle using a self-report rather than a hormonal method. Although the\nreliability of the self-report assessment of ovulation has been disputed (Bean et al., 1979;\nbut see Baker et al., 1998), our invocation of a relatively new method to assess women's\nconfidence in their self-reported menses onset helps ameliorate these concerns.\nSpecifically, we asked women to report how confident they were in their estimate of the\ndate of the first day of their last period of menses, and women who could not be included in\none category or the other with 100% confidence were excluded from analyses. Although it\nis likely that women do make errors in their self-reported menses dates, they are also likely\nto have a good sense of their own level of accuracy on this topic, and our method takes\nadvantage of that self-insight in a way that few prior studies have (see also Beall and Tracy,\n2013; Tracy and Beall, 2014). As a result, although the self-report method used here is still\nThe puzzling attractiveness of male shame\nvulnerable to concerns regarding individual differences in when ovulation occurs in the\ncycle, it is substantially less vulnerable to concerns about the potential for inaccurately\nestimating the date of ovulation, as a result of women's failure to accurately report their\nprior date of menses.\nA limitation of Study 2 is that India and the U.S. differ in many cultural and\ndemographic features beyond the critical difference presumed to account for the present\nresults--female economic freedom. Additional research is thus needed to more directly\ntarget the mechanism that accounts for these effects. For example, future studies might\ncompare groups that vary in economic freedom within the same population. If American\nwomen of higher socio-economic status are found to be more attracted to male shame\ndisplays compared to American women of lower socio-economic status, this would provide\nsupport for the proposed mechanism underlying the cultural difference observed in Study 2.\nIn addition, future research is needed to directly address other possible explanations\nfor the now well-replicated finding that American women do not find shame expressions\nparticularly unattractive.10 In addition to trustworthiness and sensitivity to social norms,\nshame may also communicate rebelliousness, given that it occurs in response to social\ntransgression. Rebelliousness connotes risk-taking--behaviors men are known to engage in\nwhen they are motivated toward romantic goals, presumably because they believe it will\nincrease their attractiveness (Baker and Maner, 2008). It is thus possible that in ecologies\nwhere male assertiveness and/or independence are more highly valued, such as American\nculture, shame's appealing \"rebel\" message may override some of the less alluring\nmessages sent by the display. Future work is needed to test this account, and to examine\nwhich of shame's various other social cues (e.g., trustworthiness, social sensitivity,\nrebelliousness) may best explain the extant results. Additional research on this topic would\nbenefit from directly asking women, within various cultural groups, to report the reasons\nfor their attraction to men showing shame. Although mate preferences are largely guided by\nsignals of reproductive fitness that tend to be perceived without conscious awareness (Buss,\nattraction to men displaying shame may be useful for generating additional, culturally\nspecific hypotheses regarding the expression's attractiveness.\nRegardless of these important future directions, the present findings provide new\ninsights on the robust attractiveness of male shame found among North American women\n"
