It is therefore sensitive to self-assessments\nin domains relevant to relational desirability. Positive relationships between self-perceived\nphysical attractiveness and self-esteem found in previous studies may reflect the\nfunctioning of a mating sociometer, designed to monitor individuals' desirability as\nromantic or sexual partners. We thus predicted that these relationships should be mediated\nby self-perceptions of romantic desirability, or more specifically, individuals' confidence in\ntheir abilities to successfully establish and maintain romantic relationships.

However, it\nwas only relatively recently that psychologists have turned their attention to evolutionary\nfunctional explanations of self-esteem. Following early theories of self-esteem, which\nlinked it to feelings of dominance or superiority over others (Mead, 1934/1967; Maslow,\n1937), such explanations have focused on the potential adaptive benefits of self-evaluation\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nin terms of monitoring individuals' status in intra-group competition for dominance,\nresources and mates (Alexander, 1980; Barkow, 1989). One of the most influential current\ntheories, sociometer theory (Leary and Baumeister, 2000; Leary, Tambor, Terdal, and\nDowns, 1995), extends this perspective, proposing that self-esteem functions as an\ninterpersonal monitor of the extent to which an individual is valued or devalued by others\nas a relational partner. It thus monitors the individual's eligibility for lasting, desirable\nsocial relationships. The sociometer is also concerned with motivating people to maintain a\nminimum level of acceptance from others.\nSociometer theory (Leary and Baumeister, 2000) has been supported by a range of\nexperimental and questionnaire evidence. Self-esteem responded to a number of social\ninclusion or exclusion manipulations: For example, participants who are led to believe that\nthey have been rejected by others experience a drop in self-esteem (Kavanagh, Robins, and\nEllis, 2010; Leary, Haupt, Strausser, and Chokel, 1998). People who reported having\nhigher-quality interpersonal relationships also reported higher levels of self-esteem,\naggregate levels of self-esteem in citizens of different countries were positively correlated\nwith the degree of close social interaction characteristic of individuals within those\nsocieties (Denissen, Penke, Schmitt, and van Aken, 2008), and people's scores on a variety\nof measures of self-esteem were positively related to their expectations of being positively\nevaluated by others (Back et al., 2009).\nAccording to sociometer theory, self-esteem not only assesses and responds to the\nquality and quantity of an individual's actual relationships, but also monitors their\neligibility for various potential relationships. Leary and Baumeister (2000) presented\nevidence suggesting that self-esteem is strongly linked to individuals' self-assessments in\ndomains relevant to interpersonal attractiveness. Most modern treatments of self-esteem\nregard it as a multidimensional or hierarchical construct (Fleming and Courtney, 1984),\nmade up of self-evaluations in a number of different domains, and a more global\nassessment of self-worth. For example, an individual may have high self-esteem with\nrespect to academic abilities, whilst having low self-esteem regarding athletic abilities. As\npredicted by sociometer theory, many established dimensions of self-esteem are concerned\nwith attributes which are especially important in establishing and maintaining social\nrelationships. Most measures of self-esteem include subscales assessing participants'\nperceptions of their likeability or social skills, physical appearance, and competence in\nsocially-valued domains such as academic performance or public speaking (Blascovich and\nTomaka, 1991). People's self-assessments on these dimensions strongly predict their\noverall levels of self-esteem (Pelham and Swann, 1989). Thus, global self-esteem is\nderived from perceptions of qualities in specific domains that are valued by others.\nEvolutionary psychologists have elaborated on the notion that self-esteem is an\nadaptive mechanism designed to monitor relational status and eligibility. In particular,\nKirkpatrick and Ellis (2004) argued that social inclusion is not a single adaptive problem,\nbut rather represents a loose collection of numerous more specific challenges. Since the\ncharacteristics of various types of relationships differ, different attributes may be required\nto establish and maintain them. For example, physical attractiveness may be an especially\nimportant asset when trying to attract a mate, but is less important in maintaining\nrelationships with family members or colleagues. Just as self-esteem subsumes a number of\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\ndomains, so too does social inclusion involve a variety of social relationships, each with its\nown adaptive challenges. Thus the structure of self-esteem may reflect the diversity of\nsocial relationships that it has evolved to monitor and maintain, and there may be multiple\nsociometers, each responding to information relevant to a particular type of relationship\n(Kirkpatrick and Ellis, 2004). Furthermore, since various types of social relationships are\nlikely to be of differential importance to specific individuals, we might expect individual\ndifferences in the strength of association between specific self-perceptions and self-esteem.\nSupport for this contention comes from a series of studies showing that people's social\nroles mediated the relationship between specific self-perceptions and self-esteem (Anthony,\nHolmes, and Wood, 2007). People with more interdependent social roles had stronger\nassociations between self-esteem and self-perceived communal qualities, such as kindness\nand supportiveness, than did those with more independent social roles.\nThe perspective of multiple, domain-specific sociometers (Kirkpatrick and Ellis,\n2004), leads us to expect a distinct mechanism that is designed to monitor mating\nrelationship status (i.e., a mating sociometer), given that successfully securing mates is a\nprimary adaptive challenge. If the outcome of this monitoring process is negative, the\nsociometer should react by causing self-esteem to drop. This is supported by studies\nshowing that romantic rejection strongly undermines self-esteem (Baumeister, Wotman,\nand Stillwell, 1993). Conversely, higher satisfaction with romantic relationships (Hendrick,\nHendrick, and Adler, 1988) and perceptions of the commitment of romantic partners (Rill,\nBaiocchi, Hopper, Denker, and Olson, 2009) are associated with higher levels of self-\nesteem. Since the sociometer is also thought to be responsible for monitoring an\nindividual's eligibility for mating relationships (Leary and Baumeister, 2000), self-esteem\nshould reflect self-assessment of desirability as a mate. This was found in two studies\ninvolving overall self-esteem and measures of mate value (Brase and Guy, 2004; Penke and\nA further study (Pass, Lindenberg, and Park, 2010, Study 1) provided additional\nevidence that self-esteem is especially sensitive to people's self-perceptions of their\ndesirability as a mate. Participants of both sexes completed fake personality inventories and\nwere then provided with false feedback relating to their capacity as a mating or friendship\npartner, which was ostensibly based on their responses. Those who received negative\nfeedback about their capacity as a mate reported lower subsequent self-esteem than those\nwho had received negative feedback about their friendship-capacity, and lower than\ncontrols who received no feedback. These findings suggest that since mating relationships\nare of particular evolutionary importance, assessments of eligibility for such relationships\nmay have especially strong effects on levels of self-esteem.\nOne variable which has been widely studied in relation to self-esteem, and which\nhas clear implications for romantic desirability, is self-perceived physical attractiveness. A\nmeta-analysis of studies on the relationship between these variables found a moderate\noverall positive correlation (r = .32) between self-rated attractiveness and self-esteem\n(Feingold, 1992), and that this was significantly stronger for women (r = .32) than for men\n(r = .27). The traditional social science explanation for this sex difference is that it may\nreflect cultural values that emphasize women's physical attractiveness over men's (e.g.,\nMathes and Kahn, 1975). An evolutionary sociometer perspective would hold that since\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nphysical attractiveness contributes more to mate value in women than in men (Buss, 1989),\nwomen's self-esteem should be more strongly related to their self-perceived attractiveness\nthan is men's. In a variety of cultures, male mate value has been shown to be more strongly\nrelated to attributes that reflect access to resources, such as social status, intelligence, and\nindustriousness (Buss, 1989). This is also supported by evidence that self-esteem correlates\nmore strongly with socioeconomic status in men than in women (Twenge and Campbell,\nExperimental evidence also supports the view that self-esteem responds to\nindividuals' perceptions of their market value and that men and women respond to different\ncues to mate value. Pass et al. (2010, study 2) provided participants with false feedback that\nthey were likely to be repeatedly rejected by potential romantic partners. Half were\ninformed that this was due to their physical attractiveness, and half that it was a result of\ntheir lack of competence and status. Women in the attractiveness manipulation condition\nsubsequently reported lower self-esteem than women in both the status manipulation and a\ncontrol condition with no feedback. Men in the status manipulation condition reported\nlower levels of self-esteem than those in the other two conditions.\nThus the mating sociometer perspective predicts that individuals' self-assessments\nin domains relevant to mate value influence their self-esteem because these attributes affect\ntheir ability to form and maintain relationships with mates. The relationship between self-\nperceived attractiveness and self-esteem should be mediated by individuals' assessments of\ntheir desirability, and specifically, their confidence in their ability to form and maintain\nromantic relationships. We sought to investigate this by examining relationships between\nself-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, romantic self-confidence and self-esteem in\na sample of young adults. In doing so we employed a novel social comparison measure of\nself-perceived facial attractiveness.\nFacial attractiveness forms only one component of overall physical attractiveness.\nJudges' ratings of physical attractiveness are strongly influenced by waist-to-hip ratio\n(Singh, 1993; Singh, Dixson, Jessop, Morgan, and Dixson, 2010) and body mass index\n(Tov\u00e9e, Hancock, Mahmoodi, Singleton, and Cornelissen, 2002; Cornelissen, Tov\u00e9e, and\nBateson, 2009) in women, and height (Sear, 2006) and waist-to-chest ratio (Swami and\nTov\u00e9e, 2005; Swami et al., 2007) in men. We thus examined whether participants' feelings\nabout their bodily attractiveness were also related to their levels of self-esteem. Although\nprevious studies have demonstrated positive correlations between body-esteem (a measure\nof individuals' self-perceived bodily attractiveness) and self-esteem (Franzoi and Shields,\nrelationship is partly mediated by individuals' romantic self-confidence.\nThus the present study measured self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness,\nappearance and romantic self-confidence, and self-esteem in a sample of young adults. We\npredicted that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, and self-confidence regarding\nappearance, would be significantly related to self-esteem in both sexes and that these\nrelationships would be stronger in women than in men, and partially mediated by romantic\nself-confidence.\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nrecruited via emails inviting students at two universities in the north of England to\nparticipate in a study on self-perceptions, who took part online. Since the study allowed\nparticipants to complete only some of the measures, separate sample sizes for each variable\nare reported in the Results section.\nMeasures\nThe study consisted of a web-based questionnaire which asked participants to\ncomplete a number of scales in the order shown below. The study was approved by the\nethics committee of the University of Central Lancashire School of Psychology.\nSelf-esteem. Rosenberg's (1965) 10-item Self-Esteem Scale (SES) was used to\nmeasure global self-esteem. This measure asks participants to indicate their feelings\ntowards self-descriptive statements (e.g., \"I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an\nequal basis with others,\" \"At times I think I am no good at all\") on four-point scales\nranging from 1 (\"strongly agree\") to 4 (\"strongly disagree\"). This is the most widely used\nmeasure of self-esteem. Fleming and Courtney (1984) reported a Cronbach's alpha of .88,\nand the scale demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency in the present sample ( =\nSelf-perceived facial attractiveness was measured by asking participants to compare\ntheir level of attractiveness to 25 male and 25 female images. For ethical reasons, the\ncomparison images were composites rather than real individuals. Comparison stimuli were\nconstructed for each sex by digitally combining 50 color JPEG images of faces which had\nbeen rated for attractiveness as part of a previous study: 25 male or female face stimuli\nwere generated such that the two lowest-rated images were combined, then the next two\nlowest, proceeding in that fashion up to the two highest-rated pictures. This method was\nemployed to try to ensure that there would be sufficient variance in the attractiveness of the\nstimuli to which participants would compare themselves. The composite-face stimuli were\nthen rated for attractiveness, on 7-point Likert scales, by 64 undergraduate psychology\nstudents, as part of an unrelated study. The mean ratings for the stimuli ranged from .88 to\nFor the same-sex images, participants were asked to \"Please compare your own face\nto the faces below for attractiveness.\" For the opposite-sex images, participants were\ninstructed: \"In the next set of ratings you will see photos of the opposite-sex. When judging\nyour face against theirs consider whether you think they would consider you as a potential\npartner.\" Participants compared themselves to each image on a seven-point scale where 1\ncorresponded to \"my face is much less attractive,\" 4 to \"same,\" and 7 to \"my face is much\nmore attractive.\" The order of presentation of images within the male and female sets was\nrandomized for each participant.\nResponses were scored in the following manner. Since ratings of 4 corresponded to\nequally attractive, these received a score equal to the mean attractiveness rating of the\nimage presented. Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to degrees of much less attractive and\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nthus received scores equal to the mean rating for the face presented, minus 3, 2, and 1,\nrespectively. Conversely, ratings of 5, 6, and 7 corresponded to degrees of much more\nattractive and thus receive scores equal to the mean rating for the face presented, plus 1, 2,\nor 3, respectively. Thus the formula for scoring the test was:\nItem score = mean attractiveness rating for image + (participant's response \u00ad 4)\nand total test scores were the sum of the scores for all of the items.\nSince participants' comparison scores on the male and female image tests were\nstrongly positively correlated (r = .81, p < .05, N = 246), they were combined to produce a\nsingle facial attractiveness score for each participant. Cronbach's alpha for the combined\nscale was .98, and previous research had demonstrated that scores on the measure\ncorrelated moderately but significantly (r = .67, p < .05) with a widely used single-item\nmeasure of self-perceived facial attractiveness (Bale, 2004).\nSelf-perceived bodily attractiveness was measured using the 35-item Body Esteem\nScale (BES: Franzoi and Shields, 1984). This widely-used instrument measures\nparticipants' global attitudes towards their bodies and also includes sex-specific subscales.\nFor women, these measure sexual attractiveness, weight concern, and physical condition.\nFor men, they measure physical attractiveness, upper body strength, and physical condition.\nThe test consists of a list of body parts (e.g., \"legs,\" \"nose\") and physical attributes (e.g.,\n\"energy level,\" \"physical coordination\"), and participants indicate their feelings towards\neach of them on a scale of 1 to 5 corresponding to \"have strong negative feelings\" and\n\"have strong positive feelings,\" respectively. Franzoi and Shields (1984) reported\nCronbach's alphas for the scale ranging between .78 and .87; in the present sample,  = .92.\nSelf-confidence was measured using the 54-item Personal Evaluation Inventory\n(PEI: Shrauger and Schohn, 1995). Participants are asked to indicate their feelings towards\nself-descriptive statements on four-point scales ranging from 1 (\"strongly agree\") to 4\n(\"strongly disagree\"), and responses are scored such that higher scores represent greater\nself-confidence. Our analyses focused on participants' scores on the Appearance and\nRomantic sub-scales of the measure, which each consist of seven items. Examples of the\nfirst included: (1) \"I am better looking than the average person\" and (2) \"Most people\nwould probably consider me physically unattractive.\" Examples of the second are: (1) \"I\nhave no difficulty maintaining a satisfying romantic relationship\" and (2) \"I have more\ntrouble establishing a romantic relationship than most people do.\" Blascovitch and Tomaka\n(1991) reported Cronbach's alpha values for the subscales ranging between .67 and .89; in\nthe present sample,  = .87 and .83 for the Appearance and Romantic subscales,\nrespectively.\nResults\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics, and Table 2 shows inter-correlations for all\nstudy variables.\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nTable 1.

Given that self-\nperceived facial and bodily attractiveness, and self-confidence in appearance, were\nsignificantly positively related, we created a measure of overall attractiveness by\ncalculating the mean of the standardized scores on these measures for each participant. In\norder to examine whether self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-confidence in\nappearance, and overall attractiveness each significantly predicted global self-esteem in\nboth sexes, we conducted a series of linear regression analyses. Following procedures\ninitially described by Baron and Kenny (1986), we also conducted mediational analyses to\nexamine whether the effects of these predictors on self-esteem were partially mediated by\nromantic self-confidence. Figures 1 to 4 show the results of these analyses.\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nFigure 1.

Standardized regression coefficients for the relationship between overall\nattractiveness and self-esteem as mediated by romantic self-confidence\nNote: The standardized regression coefficient between overall attractiveness and self-esteem controlling for\nromantic self-confidence is shown in parentheses.\nIt can be seen that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-confidence in\nappearance, and overall attractiveness each significantly predicted self-esteem. In order to\nassess whether these relationships were significantly mediated by romantic self-confidence,\nwe followed statistical bootstrapping procedures outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2004),\nemploying their SOBEL script for PASW 18, which calculates mediational effect sizes\nbased on the product of the unstandardized regression coefficients between the predictor\nand mediator, and mediator and criterion (referred to as ab), and reports confidence\nintervals for this based on bootstrap samples. These analyses indicated hypothesized small\nbut significant mediational effects of romantic self-confidence on the relationship between\nsignificant medium mediational effects of romantic self-confidence on the relationship\nbetween self-confidence in appearance and global self-esteem (ab = .102, 99% CI [.010,\nKenny, 2011, for recommendations on how to interpret the magnitude of mediation effect\nsize estimates).\nIn order to examine whether self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-\nconfidence in appearance, and the aggregate measure of overall attractiveness significantly\npredicted self-esteem separately in each sex, we conducted a series of linear regression\nanalyses. In order to examine whether there were any sex differences in the strength of\nthese predictors, we dummy coded sex and calculated an interaction term between this\nvariable and each predictor. Table 3 shows the results of these analyses.\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nTable 3. Sex differences in effects of self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness and\nself-confidence in appearance, and overall attractiveness on self-esteem\nPredictor Sex B SE B  R\u00b2\nNote: SPFA = Self-perceived facial attractiveness, SPBA = Self-perceived bodily attractiveness, SCApp =\nSelf-confidence in appearance, OAtt = Overall Attractiveness\nIn both men and women, as predicted, self-perceived facial and bodily\nattractiveness self-confidence in appearance, and overall attractiveness all significantly\npredicted global self-esteem. Analyses of the interaction terms indicate that, as predicted,\nthe relationship between self-perceived facial attractiveness, and the overall measure of\nattractiveness and self-esteem is significantly stronger in women than in men. Although the\nrelationship between self-confidence in appearance and self-esteem also appeared to be\nstronger in women, this sex difference was only marginally significant (p < .10). Contrary\nto our hypothesis, the relationship between self-perceived bodily attractiveness and self-\nesteem appears to be stronger in men than in women, although this difference was not\nsignificant (p = .37).\nDiscussion\nWe found that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness and self-confidence in\nappearance all significantly predicted self-esteem in both sexes, and in each case, these\nrelationships were partially mediated by participants' romantic self-confidence. This\nsuggests that correlations between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem found in\nprevious studies (Feingold, 1992), and here, can be explained in terms of sociometer\ntheory, which predicts that self-esteem is sensitive to self-perceptions in domains relevant\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nto relational desirability. Our mediational analyses suggest that self-perceived\nattractiveness may influence self-perceived romantic desirability, which in turn may\ninfluence self-esteem (although given the correlational design of our study, we must be\ncautious about inferring such causal relationships). It is important to note that romantic\nself-confidence only partially mediated the relationships between measures of self-\nperceived attractiveness and self-esteem, and that the mediation effects were substantially\nsmaller than the direct effect of each predictor, indicating that there are additional, stronger\ndirect relationships between the attractiveness measures and self-esteem. Given that greater\nphysical attractiveness is also associated with more positive friendship, professional and\neven familial relationships (Langlois et al., 2000), these results are still consistent with a\nsociometer perspective.\nWe obtained more mixed results with respect to sex differences in the associations\nbetween self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem. Although facial attractiveness and\ncomposite overall attractiveness were both more strongly related to self-esteem in women\nthan in men, confidence in appearance was only marginally so, and no sex difference was\nfound for bodily attractiveness. It should be noted that bodily attractiveness measures traits\nrelevant to physical condition and strength which, whilst predicting physical attractiveness\nalso be related to dominance, social status and other variables relevant to parental\ninvestment (Sell et al., 2009). Moreover, athletic ability, which should relate to men's\nassessments of their bodies, is thought to be important in male intrasexual competition for\nmates (Faurie, Pontier, and Raymond, 2004; Farrelly and Nettle, 2007; Schulte-Hostedde,\nEys, and Johnson, 2008). Thus, whilst theory predicts that physical attractiveness, by virtue\nof signaling reproductive potential, should be more important for female romantic\ndesirability (Buss, 1989), by additionally signaling cues to traits relevant to competitive\nability in males, these aspects of bodily attractiveness are likely to be important for self-\nesteem in men.\nThe absence of sex differences in two of the relationships between specific\nattractiveness measures and self-esteem may also be partially due to the demographic\nprofile of our sample, which consisted largely of young undergraduate students. The\nimportance of traits relevant to parental investment, such as social status and economic\nresources, may be attenuated in men of this age group, relative to older men. In their\nabsence, bodily attractiveness may be a more important component of men's romantic\ndesirability, thus explaining the relative lack of a clear sex difference in this case. This\npossibility could be investigated by examining whether the relationship between self-\nperceived attractiveness (particularly bodily attractiveness) and self-esteem is lessened in\nolder men. Similarly, future studies could profitably examine sex differences in\nrelationships between self-esteem and other aspects of mate value, particularly those\nrelevant to parental investment such as wealth and social status.\nAlthough our results broadly support a sociometer perspective on the relationship\nbetween self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem, there are several potential limitations\nto our study. In addition to the usual limitation of being unable to make causal inferences\nbased on cross sectional studies, another limitation is related to the construct of self-\nperceived romantic desirability, and our operationalization of this as romantic self-\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nconfidence, measured by the PEI. The decision to use this measure was based on the\nreasoning that a functional sociometer perspective would predict that self-perceived\nattractiveness correlates with self-esteem because physical attractiveness is an attribute\nimportant for the ability to form and maintain romantic relationships. Thus we predicted\nthat individuals' romantic self-confidence, which concerns their self-evaluations of this\nability, should mediate the link between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem.\nAlthough the PEI measure of romantic self-confidence has excellent psychometric\nproperties (Shrauger and Schohn, 1995), it has not been as widely used as other measures\nsuch as the Self-Perceived Mating Success Scale (SPMSS; Landolt, Lalumi\u00e8re, and\nQuinsey, 1995). This focuses on people's perceptions of how much positive attention they\nreceive from members of the opposite sex, and their access to sexual partners. Although\nthese perceptions are likely to influence confidence in the ability to form and maintain\nromantic relationships, we considered that the PEI provided a more direct measure of\nromantic self-confidence. A further consideration is that items on the SPMSS are primarily\nrelevant to short-term relationships. The mating sociometer perspective predicts that self-\nesteem should be sensitive not only to desirability as a short-term partner but also to\nconfidence in the ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships, especially for\nwomen. Given that the PEI includes items relevant to both short- and long-term\nrelationships, it therefore provided a more comprehensive measure of self-perceived\nromantic desirability in the present context.\nAnother potential limitation concerns our interpretation of sociometer theory,\nspecifically the prediction that individuals' confidence in their ability to form and maintain\nromantic relationships should mediate the relationship between self-perceived\nattractiveness and self-esteem. An alternative possibility is that specific self-perceptions\ndirectly influence self-esteem, rather than the relationship being mediated by conscious\nappraisals of the significance of level of physical attractiveness for individuals' romantic\nrelationships. On this view, self-esteem would simply be an affective \"gut reaction\" based\non the extent to which others value the individual as a relational partner. Leary (2004)\nsuggested that the sociometer system may have evolved from more primitive, purely\naffective systems designed to monitor dominance-submission and inclusion-exclusion\nrelationships in the immediate social context. He went on to argue that the emergence of\nthe conceptual self in humans created a more complex sociometer system which integrated\nindividuals' immediate, non-conscious affective reactions to social feedback with longer-\nterm cognitive appraisals of their abilities and relational value. We suggest that the direct\nrelationship between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem found in the present\nstudy largely reflects the non-conscious, affective response of the sociometer system to\nindividuals' everyday experiences of interactions with others, which are likely to be\ninfluenced by their appearance. The mediational effect of romantic self-confidence may\nreflect conscious appraisals of the implications of the level of attractiveness for the\nperson's ability to form and maintain romantic relationships. According to this analysis,\nhad we found no mediational effect of romantic self-confidence, we would not necessarily\nreject a sociometer account of the relationship between self-perceived attractiveness and\nself-esteem, but perhaps instead conclude that conscious appraisals of the implications of\nattractiveness for romantic relationships do not influence this.\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\nThis discussion relates to wider issues surrounding the conceptualization and\nmeasurement of components of the self and self-esteem. Theories and measures of self-\nesteem have traditionally placed different degrees of emphasis on self-evaluations of\ncompetence, skills or abilities, and a more affective, global sense of self-worth (Wells and\nMarwell, 1976). Different theoretical models of self-esteem have disagreed about whether\nthese are truly distinct but related constructs, or are aspects of the same construct. Although\nthis issue is beyond the scope of the present paper, our analysis does assume that self-\nconfidence is distinct from self-esteem. Consistent with this, Shrauger and Schohn (1995)\nfound that scores on a measure of romantic self-confidence were independent of those on\nRosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale, a global measure of self-worth. We therefore\nconsider that including these two measures in the current study provided a valid means of\ninvestigating whether romantic self-confidence mediates the relationship between self-\nperceived attractiveness and self-worth. Although we interpreted the significant positive\nrelationship between these measures in terms of a sociometer perspective whereby\nromantic self-confidence predicts self-esteem, we cannot rule out the possibility that the\ncorrelation reflects an overlap between instruments which are measuring similar constructs.\nIt is important to note that our mediational analyses assumed that specific self-\nevaluations causally affect self-esteem. Sociometer theory suggests that this reflects the\nadaptive function of self-esteem, which evolved to monitor individuals' relational status\ntogether with traits relevant to this (Leary and Baumeister, 2000). However, given that the\ncorrelational design of this and almost every previous study in this area (e.g., Feingold,\n1992) does not allow a definitive causal interpretation of the associations, we must seek\nalternative evidence for these causal assumptions. Pass et al. (2010, study 2) did find that\nwomen who were given negative false-feedback about their physical attractiveness\nsubsequently reported lower self-esteem than controls, suggesting that changes in self-\nperceived physical attractiveness do have an immediate impact on self-esteem.\nAlternative theories of self-esteem propose that self-worth causally affects specific\nself-perceptions (Brown, Dutton, and Cook, 2001): Thus self-esteem would drive\nperceptions of attractiveness, rather than the reverse, as assumed here. To our knowledge,\nno previous research has examined whether experimentally manipulating individuals' self-\nesteem affects their self-perceived attractiveness. To eliminate the possibility that this is the\ncase, further experimental research, which independently manipulates specific self-\nperceptions (e.g., Pass et al, 2010) or self-esteem, is required in order to examine their\npossible effects on each other. Similarly, longitudinal diary studies examining whether\nchanges in self-esteem are predicted by everyday changes in individuals' self-perceptions\nin domains relevant to interpersonal relationships, and their experiences of interactions with\nactual or potential romantic partners, would help to differentiate between these alternate\ntheories.\nIn addition, further research could profitably examine whether the kinds of\nmediational relationships we discuss here also operate in the context of other, non-romantic\ninterpersonal relationships as would be suggested by a modular sociometer perspective\n(Kirkpatrick and Ellis, 2004). For example, Srivastava and Beer (2005) investigated\nrelationships between individuals' attachment styles, self-evaluations and self-perceptions\nof the regard of others for them, and others' actual liking of them, in a series of small group\nA mating sociometer perspective of self esteem\ninteractions. They showed that, consistent with a sociometer perspective, being liked by\nothers lead to more positive self-evaluations, and this was moderated by individuals'\nattachment anxiety. Further research of this kind investigating complex relationships\nbetween constructs including self-perceptions and evaluations, self-esteem and individual\ndifferences in interpersonally relevant variables (such as attachment style) in the context of\npeer and family relationships would complement the present research and provide further\ninsight into the possible functioning of the sociometer.\nIf self-esteem is an evolutionary adaptation, we would expect it to functionally\ninfluence individuals' interpersonal behavior. Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2004) suggested that\none of the ways in which the sociometer system might do this is by linking self-\nassessments of relational value with adaptive choices about relational targets, through the\nmediating influence of self-esteem. A study by Kavanagh et al. (2010) supports this\nsuggestion. Participants first received either accepting or rejecting feedback about their\ndesirability as a date from an attractive confederate of the opposite sex. This feedback was\nfound to influence how well-matched they felt they were with individuals of the opposite\nsex who differed in mate value. Those who had received rejecting feedback rated\nthemselves as being more compatible with low mate-value targets, whereas those who had\nreceived accepting feedback rated themselves as more compatible with high mate-value\ntargets. These effects were mediated by changes in self-esteem in response to acceptance or\nrejection. Kavanagh et al. (2010) argued that this supported a sociometer view of the\nfunction of self-esteem, in that participants were adaptively regulating their relational\naspirations in response to interpersonal feedback. Other than this, there is at present little\nevidence that self-esteem causally affects relational behavior (Baumeister, Campbell,\nKrueger, and Vohs, 2003). Thus future research could profitably examine whether self-\nesteem adaptively guides relational behavior, as predicted by sociometer theory. In\nparticular, studies could examine whether self-esteem influences the use of specific mate\nattraction (Buss, 1988a) and retention (Buss, 1988b) tactics. If self-esteem does influence\nindividuals' use of such tactics in adaptive ways, this would support the sociometer theory\nview that self-esteem evolved to monitor and regulate interpersonal relationships.\nReferences\nAlexander, R.
