Of special interest\nare Denver and Seattle, where the Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer\nclosed during the intervening year. The data from the CPS indicate that civic engage-\nment in Seattle and Denver dropped significantly from 2008 to 2009--a decline that is\nnot consistently replicated over the same time period in other major American cities\nthat did not lose a newspaper.

Today, as newspapers struggle through a rocky transi-\ntion from an analog past toward a digital future, the question of newspapers' importance is\nespecially pressing. In Paul Starr's (2011) words, \"More than any other medium, newspa-\npers have been our eyes on the state, our check on private abuses, our civic alarm systems.\nIt is true that they have often failed to perform those functions as well as they should have\ndone. But whether they can continue to perform them at all is now in doubt.\" So, as news-\npaper circulation dwindles and the very future of the print product is questioned, there is\nscholarly and public attention upon their plight. But how important are newspapers to their\ncommunities, and how concerned should we be as they decline?\nUsing data from the 2008 and 2009 November supplements of the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau, this article examines the civic\nengagement of citizens in the largest American metropolitan areas. The analysis compares\nthe year-over-year change in the civic engagement of citizens in cities that lost a newspaper\nin the intervening year--namely, Denver and Seattle--and cities that did not lose a news-\npaper over the same time period.

This decline is\nnot consistently replicated in the other cities examined, even after controlling for several\nother alternative explanations. Though the causality of the decline in civic engagement can-\nnot be definitively established with the CPS data, the findings of this article lend additional\nempirical support to what many already believed: Newspapers are vital institutions in our\ndemocracy, and their decline warrants our concern.\nThe Rocky Mountain News and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer\nThe closures of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer (PI) and the Rocky Mountain News (Rocky)\nwere prompted by a simple factor: insufficient revenue.1 From 2006 to 2009, annual nation-\nwide newspaper advertising revenue dropped from about $49 billion to $27 billion (Project\nfor Excellence in Journalism [PEJ], 2012). The migration of audiences to new media\ngave advertisers many new placement options; meanwhile, newspapers failed to mone-\ntize their developing digital audiences as their print circulation revenue eroded. During\n2008, the PI lost about $14 million, and the Rocky lost about $16 million (DeBruin &\nRyckman, 2009; Richman & James, 2009). Both newspapers were alternately competing\nand collaborating--via a joint operating agreement (JOA)--with a second daily newspaper\nin their home market: the Denver Post and the Seattle Times. Though the PI and Rocky had\nboth been community fixtures for 150 years, their large, national corporate owners--E. W.\nScripps (Rocky) and Hearst (PI)--no longer saw a future in publishing the second paper in\na two-paper market.\nThe sudden collapse of advertising revenue immediately precipitated the newspapers'\nclosures, but a long-term decline in circulation was the underlying culprit. By the end of\n2009, daily newspaper circulation was down about 31% from its peak levels nationwide\n(PEJ, 2010). In Denver, circulation decreases at the two newspapers were similar to nation-\n2010). As Table 1 shows, the circulation of the Rocky Mountain News declined nearly\nin lockstep with the Post's in the years preceding its closure. By the spring of 2009, both\npapers had about 203,000 subscribers--but the Post had more active local ownership, favor-\nable union contracts, and lower overhead (Diddlebock, 2009). Ultimately, the Post was the\nstronger of the two newspapers, and its owner was more determined to stay the course.\nIn Seattle, the figures depart some from the national narrative. Though overall circula-\ntion was in decline, the decrease was not as pronounced as it was in Denver or nationally.\nThe key event in the two papers' recent relationship was the Times' switch in 2000 to morn-\ning publication (Bishop & Richman, 2003). This put the two papers in direct competition\nNote. All figures are from annual spring reports from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.\nDead Newspapers and Civic Engagement 133\nfor the first time--and started a migration of PI subscribers to the Times. This competitive\nshift also soured the JOA that the two papers had, and the Times moved to end the rela-\ncitizens known as the Committee for a Two Newspaper Town fought the dissolution of the\nJOA in court in the hopes of keeping the PI alive. But, in the end, the JOA issue was moot\nbecause Hearst chose to close the PI in the face of mounting losses.\nTheorizing Local Newspapers' Importance\nSeveral theoretical strands from the past 200 years suggest different ways that newspa-\npers contribute to their communities. In Democracy in America, de Tocqueville argues that\nnewspapers were catalysts for the formation of associations that were vital to America's\nearly participatory democracy. Similarly, Bryce (1995) and Tarde (1903) propose that\nnewspapers set common agendas for their readers that, in a way, define the readers' commu-\nnities. Janowitz (1968) describes the reciprocal relationship between community newspaper\nreadership and community attachment, suggesting that, one way or another, newspaper\nreadership is an important part of being a community member. And, as urban populations\nsuburbanized in the latter half of the 20th century, Kaniss (1997) asserted that large daily\nnewspapers knit patchwork municipalities together into cohesive metropolitan areas by\nactively cultivating one overarching civic identity. But what underpins these related, yet\ndivergent, functions of the local news media?\nHabermas, in Theory of Communicative Action (1985), posits a two-level concept of\nsociety that offers a starting point for understanding the relationship between local news\nmedia and their communities. He argues that society is structured by both lifeworld--private\nand public communicative interactions that characterize the daily lives of individuals--and\nsystem--Weberian economic and state bureaucracies that increasingly delimit these lives\n(Baxter, 1987). In early societies, these two levels were closely related but, in the 21st cen-\ntury, they are \"uncoupling\" and the influence of lifeworld upon system is less direct. As the\ndistance between lifeworld and system grows, \"media replace linguistic `communication'\nin certain functional contexts, thereby replacing the `mechanism' of linguistic understand-\ning and consensus\" (Baxter, 1987, p. 56). Or, in other words, media become an important\nlink between lifeworld and system.\nCommunities come into the equation because they are \"the complex social structure[s]\nin which system and lifeworld meet\" (Friedland & McLeod, 1999, p. 198). Though com-\nmunities may not all be defined by geography and proximity today, local communities are\nstill central to our governance and society (Macedo & Karpowitz, 2006). But what delin-\neates these communities? Gerrymandered political borders? Mutable incorporation lines?\nNatural boundaries like rivers or ridges? To these obvious factors, both Tarde (cited in\nKatz, 1999) and Kaniss (1997) would add local newspapers. They argue that community\nsprings forth from a common agenda that is cultivated by readership of the same newspa-\nper. Friedland and McLeod (1999) move beyond readership and argue that \"local media\nare themselves central institutions connected to other community institutions and operate\nto link the networks and bonds, in general the set of relations, that tie differing associations,\nsubcommunities, and cultures together\" (p. 208).\nWhether through information dissemination or the work of producing the newspaper,\nthe relations and ties that newspapers contribute to are the basis for public action--which,\nin modern \"uncoupling\" societies, is the mechanism through which citizens may influ-\nence their system. So, if local media institutions are strong and are binding individuals\nand groups together, then citizens should be participating in more community groups,\ncontacting their government more frequently, and circulating more petitions because they\nare more aware of shared problems, interests, and opportunities.2 Readership of the same\nmetropolitan newspaper--or other interactions with it--may spur many forms of engage-\nment across districts and boundaries as groups of citizens respond to the same local (or\nregional) news in different manners. In short, civic engagement and other indicators of an\nactive citizenry should be higher when local news media institutions are numerous and\nvibrant and members of the public are consuming the content that they produce.\nEmpirical Evidence of Local Newspapers' Importance\nResearchers who try to isolate the discrete contributions that newspapers make to their com-\nmunities typically situate their work somewhere within this broad theoretical foundation.\nIn the process, they have depicted correlations between newspaper readership and civic\n& Hesse, 1997; Stamm & Weis, 1986), and relevant political outcomes such as voters'\nlocal electoral choices (Becker & Dunwoody, 1982; McLeod et al., 1999). But most prior\nresearch in this vein is limited by a reliance upon cross-sectional, single-city data sets that\npreclude causal tests and limit generalizability (Hoffman & Eveland, 2010; Kim & Ball-\nRokeach, 2006). Inconsistent, unreliable, and often self-reported media exposure variables,\nwhich plague media research in general (Prior, 2009), are an additional obstacle that under-\nmines researchers working to show a causal relationship between newspaper readership and\ncommunity-related outcomes.\nHoffman and Eveland (2010) address some of these shortfalls by using a national panel\nstudy to assess the importance of local news media use. Their findings replicate the well-\nestablished correlational relationship between local newspaper readership and community\nattachment, but they do not locate evidence of a significant relationship over time. This\nprevents any conclusions regarding the causal ordering of the relationship between local\nnews media use and community attachment. In explaining their null findings, Hoffman and\nEveland assert that levels of both local news media use and community attachment are\nentrenched and unlikely to vary much over the course of a year (the time period between\nthe waves of their survey) unless a dramatic event disrupts the status quo. As they write,\n\"Only panel studies that track individuals over time, beginning when they enter commu-\nnities or when communities are significantly disrupted by outside events, are likely to\nbe capable of sorting out the causal ambiguities inherent in this area of great theoretical\nIt is a pair of such disruptions--the deaths of the PI and Rocky--that prompts the\ncurrent article. And there is a small tradition of similar research that informs this work.\nBerelson (1948) conducted an interview-based examination of the effects of a newspaper\ndelivery strike in New York City that took place in 1945 and lasted for 17 days. In this\npre-television era, most of the respondents said they missed the hard news that their news-\npaper provided--but in Berelson's estimation, only about a third were able to engage in\nenough discussion of the news to indicate that they ever actually read it. More recently,\na pair of studies replicated Berelson's work in small towns where the local newspaper\nwas not delivered on a given day (Bentley, 2001) or was permanently shuttered (Smethers,\nBressers, Willard, Harvey, & Freeland, 2007). Like Berelson, both projects found that\nmany of the interviewees primarily missed their newspaper for reasons related to habit\nor entertainment--but not because of a lack of access to hard news.\nDead Newspapers and Civic Engagement 135\nIf individual-level media exposure variables derived from surveys are unreliable, per-\nhaps a better approach to assessing the importance of newspapers is to use environmental\ndifferences to, in effect, establish a natural experiment at the community level. For exam-\nple, Mondak (1995) compared residents of Pittsburgh during an 8-month-long newspaper\nstrike in 1992 and 1993 with residents of Cleveland who did not experience a disruption in\ntheir newspapers. He found that there was evidence that the lack of newspapers had a dele-\nterious effect upon Pittsburghers' local political knowledge and talk, but not their national\nor international political knowledge and talk. So, even without individual-level media expo-\nsure variables, it may be possible to measure the effects of access to different media within\nand across communities.\nA recent study of Cincinnati and its suburbs (Schulhofer-Wohl & Garrido, 2011) that\nevaluated the effects of the 2007 closure of the Cincinnati Post also used this kind of\ncommunity-level approach. The authors suggested that a number of negative political out-\ncomes could be observed from 2007\u00ad2010 in the northern Kentucky communities that the\nPost traditionally served. These same outcomes, however, were not visible in the communi-\nties served by the Cincinnati Enquirer, which did not close. In the Kentucky communities,\n\"Fewer people voted in elections for city council, city commission, and school board;\nfewer candidates sought those seats; the remaining candidates spent less money on their\ncampaigns; and, for councils and commissions, incumbents' chances of retaining office\nimproved\" (Schulhofer-Wohl & Garrido, 2011, p. 2). Even though the Enquirer increased\ncoverage of northern Kentucky to compensate for the Post's closure, the communities\nsuffered significant, negative local political effects.\nThree conclusions emerge from the body of previous empirical scholarship concern-\ning the importance of local newspapers. First, there is an array of evidence that depicts\na correlation between local newspaper readership and a variety of important civic, politi-\ncal, and community outcomes. These correlations offer general support for the theoretical\narguments that claim newspapers are important to citizens and their communities. Second,\nbecause of data and methodological limitations, the causality and generalizability of these\nrelationships is unclear: Does newspaper readership spur civic engagement, political action,\nor community attachment--or vice versa? Third, prior research suggests that it may be\npossible to gain some leverage on both the causality and generalizability of newspapers'\nimportance by strategically using community-level data.\nHypotheses\nIn response to the methodological limitations of much of the prior research regarding the\nimportance of local news media--and following the innovative structure of several other\nprojects--this analysis focuses on a community-level comparison of the change in civic\nengagement in two dozen cities across the United States over a 12-month period. Given\nhypothesis that this article tests is as follows.\nH1: A positive association between newspaper readership and acts of civic engagement\nexists at the national level and within individual communities.\nIf this is true, then there is reason to investigate the change in year-over-year civic\nengagement in various American metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on Denver\nand Seattle. Though cross-sectional data cannot alone establish the causal direction of\nthe relationship between newspaper readership and civic engagement, the tradition of\ncorrelational findings suggests that the loss of a newspaper will negatively impact civic\nengagement.\nMeanwhile, in cities that did not experience a significant disruption in their local media\nenvironments, at first blush there is no reason to expect a significant year-over-year change\nin civic engagement.\nH3: Civic engagement in cities other than Seattle and Denver will be unchanged from\nAt the national level, the demise of the Post-Intelligencer and Rocky Mountain News is\nrelatively insignificant. But, because of the timing of the CPS--the 2008 iteration immedi-\nately followed the surge of political activity tied to the 2008 presidential campaign and\nthe 2009 iteration was not preceded by a similar catalyst--it is conceivable that civic\nengagement would be broadly depressed in any year-over-year comparison. Accordingly,\nHypothesis 4 is as follows.\nFinally, even if there is evidence of a national decrease in civic engagement in 2009,\nan off-election year during an economic downturn, the common factors that contribute to\nthis general decline will be present in Denver and Seattle--and compounded by the loss of\nnewspapers in these cities.\nH5: Declines in civic engagement in Seattle and Denver will be larger than declines\nobserved at the national level or in other major American cities due to the closure\nof a newspaper.\nMethod\nThe primary data set in this article merges measures drawn from the 2008 and\n2009 November supplements to the CPS. Starting in 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau added\na battery on civic engagement to the CPS that initially included 25 items and was asked of\ntery was repeated, but 12 questions were dropped (including a set of news media usage\nquestions) and the number of respondents was reduced to about 21,000 (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2009). In addition to the civic engagement battery, the CPS data sets both pro-\nvide access to basic demographic information describing the respondents and a group of\nitems focused on social capital.3\nThe specific respondents to the CPS vary from year to year, but because the survey pop-\nulation is derived from a probability sample designed to be representative of all households,\ncomparisons of aggregate year-over-year data should be valid. Conducting demographic\ncomparisons of the 2008 and 2009 samples does reveal some significant differences in\nthe metropolitan area populations year over year. The differences that exist are generally\nmuted and may feasibly be attributed to the natural evolution of communities or the nation's\nDead Newspapers and Civic Engagement 137\nSeattle Denver\nRace (%)\nGender (%)\nNote. Significance was derived from year-over-year, two-tailed t tests.\nmacroeconomic environment rather than systematic sampling bias. Table 2. contains a com-\nparison of the 2008 and 2009 sample demographics in Denver and Seattle. There are no\nsignificant differences in the sample composition year over year in Seattle, but in Denver\nthere is a significant change in the racial composition of the sample.\nFive core civic engagement items are available in both the 2008 and 2009 CPS data\nsets. These five questions are analyzed individually, recoded into yes (1) and no (0) dummy\nvariables, and also as a cumulative index of civic engagement that averages all five together\n(0\u00ad1, M = .12, SD = .20). Together, they are the key dependent variables in the analyses\nbelow. They are as follows:\nPlease tell whether or not you have done any of the following in the last\n(1) Contacted or visited a public official--at any level of government--to\nexpress your opinion? (Yes/No/DK/Refused)\n(2) Bought or boycotted a certain product or service because of\nthe social or political values of the company that provides it?\n(Yes/No/DK/Refused)\nHave you participated in any of these groups during the last 12 months, that is\nbetween November 200X and now:\n(3) A school group, neighborhood, or community association such as PTA\nor neighborhood watch groups? (Yes/No/DK/Refused)\n(4) A service or civic organization such as American Legion or Lions Club?\n(Yes/No/DK/Refused)\n(5) In the last 12 months, between November 200X and now, have you\nbeen an officer or served on a committee of any group or organization?\n(Yes/No/DK/Refused)\nAdditionally, of the 13 substantive items that are repeated from year to year in the CPS\ncivic engagement supplement, several target indicators of social capital that have, at most,\nan indirect conceptual connection to newspaper readership. Three of these 5-point ordinal\nitems tracked the frequency of social activities--having a household dinner, talking with\nneighbors, and doing favors for neighbors--from 1 (not at all) to 5 (basically every day).\nThese questions are averaged into a social capital index (1\u00ad5, M = 3.22, SD = .94), used\nbelow as a point of comparison for the civic engagement analyses.\nThe initial regression analyses below establish the basic relationship between newspa-\nper readership and civic engagement at the individual level. For these, the 2008 CPS data set\nis used alone because the news media use questions were eliminated from the 2009 survey.4\nThe newspaper readership question on the 2008 survey is:\nPlease tell me how often you did each of the following during a TYPICAL\nMONTH in the past year:\nRead a newspaper in print or on the Internet--basically every day, a few\ntimes a week, a few times a month, once a month, or not at all?5\nNext, the 2008 and 2009 data sets are merged to allow for community-level analyses\nthat seek to isolate the effect of the newspaper closures in Denver and Seattle.6 Since the\n2009 data do not offer news media use variables, the critical independent variable in the\nyear-over-year analyses is implied: the change (or lack thereof) in the media environment\nwithin each community. Simple t tests are initially used to assess the significance of the\nobserved changes.\nIn the combined data set, the populations of various metropolitan areas are identified\naccording to the Census CBSA FIPS code. The Census Bureau's definitions of metropolitan\nareas are often relatively broad, encompassing multiple contiguous cities and sometimes\neven spanning across state lines in the process (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). As scholars\nhave argued (Kaniss, 1997), newspapers also transcend municipal borders, so defining the\ncommunity of study according to these metropolitan areas is intuitive. In addition, this\nbroad definition of communities yields sample sizes that allow for localized year-over-year\ncomparisons to be made with reasonable statistical power. Accordingly, eight comparison\ncities were chosen with both a purposive and practical reason in mind. First, in terms of\nculture and demographics, some cities are more comparable in nature (Seattle and Portland,\nfor example) than others (Seattle and Houston). Second, the CPS data, though abundant,\nlimit local-level comparisons to only the largest metropolitan areas because of the reduced\nThe final analyses are conducted on a novel data set built from several sources that\nallows for a more systematic analysis of the importance of newspaper closures. The primary\ndependent variable in these models comes from the merged 2008/2009 CPS data set and\nis the year-over-year change in civic engagement for each of the top 20 U.S. metropolitan\nareas--including Denver (number 12) and Seattle (number 20)--by population according\nto the 2008 CPS. For each city, the index of civic engagement (described above) in 2009 is\nsubtracted from the index of civic engagement in 2008. The same process is completed for\nthe social capital index outlined above, and the difference in social capital is used as an\nalternate dependent variable.\nand three key control variables are included in this data set to address alternate causal\nexplanations for observed changes in civic engagement. A measure of total 2008 politi-\ncal campaign spending on TV advertising for all campaigns combined, by media market,\nDead Newspapers and Civic Engagement 139\nis drawn from data provided by the Wisconsin Advertising Project (Goldstein, Niebler,\nNeiheisel, & Holleque, 2011). Newspaper circulation reports from the Audit Bureau of\nCirculations are used to create a variable that tracks the percentage change in the total cir-\nculation of all major dailies present in each of the top 20 cities from the final quarter of\n2008 to the final quarter of 2009. Finally, the percentage change in unemployment levels\nfrom November 2008 to November 2009 by metropolitan area is gleaned from reports made\navailable by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nResults\nTable 3. contains the results of three OLS regressions that predict cumulative civic engage-\nment in three populations: the United States, Seattle, and Denver. At the national level, the\nsample is over 50,000 and every independent variable has a significant relationship with\ncivic engagement, including newspaper readership ( = .014, p  .001). In both Denver\nand Seattle, the positive relationship between newspaper readership and civic engagement\nThere is a positive relationship between newspaper readership and civic engagement.\nTable 4. contains the results of year-over-year comparisons of the five civic engagement\nindicators described earlier. Data for 10 cities, including Denver and Seattle, as well as the\nnation as a whole are reported. Each cell contains the difference from 2008 to 2009, in\nterms of percentage, in the proportion of the survey sample within each metropolitan area\nthat responded in the affirmative to the particular engagement question at hand. Negative\nnumbers indicate that the percentage of respondents who reported taking a specific action\ndeclined year over year; positive figures indicate the opposite. The significance of each\ndifference was assessed with simple two-tailed t tests.\nThe results show that, in Denver, four of the five civic engagement indicators declined\nsignificantly from 2008 to 2009. In Seattle, two of the five indicators decreased significantly\nover the same period. The other indicators in both cities were not significantly different year\nover year. Together, these results offer support for H2: Many measures of civic engagement\nin Seattle and Denver declined from 2008 to 2009. Overall, aggregate civic engagement\ndeclined significantly in Denver (-4.6%, p  .05) but not in Seattle (-1.4%). As the scal-\ning in Figure 1. shows, the declines in both cities outstripped declines (or increases) in\ntheir closest peer cities.7 So, although civic engagement declined 4.6% in absolute terms in\nMeanwhile, in the other eight cities, 35 of the 40 year-over-year comparisons are non-\nsignificant. Only one indicator across all of the cities--boycotts of products or services\namong Cincinnatians--significantly declined year over year. Four indicators--contacting\na public official in Cleveland and Minneapolis, boycotting a product or service in Dallas,\nnot uniformly supported: There are some differences in the data across the nation. But, as\nH3 predicts, the vast majority of the city-level indicators were not significantly different\nacross the 2 years.\nThe national data in Table 4 provide a wider view. Here each indicator is signifi-\ncantly different (due in part to the large sample size) in the year-over-year comparisons:\nFour decreased and one increased. The general trend reflects a decline in civic engage-\nment, nationwide, which supports H4. The magnitude of these differences, however, ranges\nbetween just 1% and 2% across the board. The observed declines in Seattle and Denver,\nmeanwhile, are roughly 5% to 8%, which supports H5.\nOLS regressions predicting civic engagement in 2008 CPS data\nNational coefficient\nSeattle\ncoefficient\nDenver\ncoefficient\nRace\nWhite -- -- --\nGender\nFemale -- -- --\nHousehold income\nEducation\n1: Less than high school -- -- --\nNote.

In the three models presented, the dependent variable is the\naggregate year-over-year change in either social capital or civic engagement.8 Though the\nsample size in these models is only 20, the first regression that predicts change in civic\nengagement is significant (F = 3.209, p  .05), and there is a strong, negative relationship\n( = -3.704, p  .01) between the closure of a newspaper and civic engagement--even\nafter controlling for the amount of 2008 campaign TV advertising spending in each mar-\nket and the change in unemployment from 2008 to 2009. Meanwhile, a similar model\nthat predicts change in social capital is not significant; none of the independent vari-\nables are significant. Controlling for the year-over-year change in newspaper circulation\nmuddies the picture of civic engagement some. In this model, only the newspaper clo-\nsure variable is significant ( = -3.571, p  .05), but the regression itself retreats from\nsignificance (F = 2.402, p  .10).

But the magnitude of the\ndecline in Seattle and Denver outstripped the national trend. And in other, similar cities,\nmeasurement of the same indicators, collected in the same surveys and at the same times,\nshowed little evidence of decline. Contrasting the Denver and Seattle results with those\nfrom like cities offers a pair of important benefits. First, concern that a measurement issue\nthat systematically skewed the data toward a year-over-year decline is assuaged. Second,\nnational-level third variables (economic turmoil, different political conditions, etc.) that\ncould plausibly explain variation in any one city should also cause the same variation\nin other cities as well. The absence of uniformity across the cities suggests that differ-\nences within a city from year to year can be attributed to factors at the metropolitan\nlevel.\nIs it possible that the declines in civic engagement in Seattle and Denver could be the\nresult of factors other than the newspaper closures? Yes. In the 12-month period between\nsurveys, many important and unique events surely transpired in each city in the nation.\nbecause newspaper readership is significantly related to civic engagement, it seems very\nlikely that the newspaper closures would bear negatively upon civic engagement in Denver\nand Seattle. And, even after controlling for the possibility of a spillover effect on civic\nengagement caused by greater political advertising in some cities compared to others, the\nlikelihood that the economic downturn that began in 2008 had a depressing effect upon civic\nengagement, and the ongoing decline of newspaper circulations, the data suggest that the\nclosure of a newspaper still had a measurable effect on citizen engagement. Finally, models\nthat control for differences in the racial composition of the year-over-year CPS samples\nsuggest that this factor is not related to the change in civic engagement.10\nPerhaps the observed decline in Denver and Seattle was a chimera: It is conceivable\nthat the estimate of civic engagement in the 2008 CPS data was spuriously high. If this is the\ncase, then the 2009 results would merely reflect regression to the mean, and the change from\n2008 to 2009 would not be meaningful. Because the CPS civic engagement module began\nin 2008, it is difficult to address this concern. But, in perhaps the most comparable prior\nresearch, the Saguaro Seminar's multi-city social capital benchmark surveys in 2000, civic\nengagement in Denver and Seattle significantly outstrips civic engagement in the nation as\na whole.11 This implies that the high reading in 2008 was not aberrant, and the decline from\nIf the year-over-year decline is real, perhaps it is only temporary. Data from the\nDenver: It increased significantly (by 3.4%, p < .05), though it did not reach its 2008 level.\nIn Seattle, there was a small nonsignificant decline from 2009 to 2010, continuing the\ntrend from the year before. Additional years of CPS data will offer two advantages: more\ncase cities (in which newspapers have closed) and more data points to track trends over\ntime. A long-term study building on the current research is a worthy future direction. For\nnow, this preliminary result offers some context: The negative impact of newspaper clo-\nsures reported here may be only a short-term effect as communities develop new ways of\nproducing and accessing information.\nThough Denver and Seattle both experienced a similar shock to their local media envi-\nronments, neither the disruption nor its effects were identical. Clearly, the data show that\nthe magnitude of the negative effect was greater in Denver than in Seattle. Two clear\nexplanations for this divergence come to mind. First, the relative importance of the two\nnewspapers to their communities was different in at least one key respect: In Seattle about\n8% of households received the PI, while in Denver about 20% of households received the\nRocky. Accordingly, we should expect to see larger effects in Denver. Second, the PI halted\nits print edition but continued to produce and distribute news on the Web; meanwhile,\nthe Rocky went completely out of business. If we think of local news as a public good--\nsomething that is broadly beneficial even if it is not specifically consumed--then this is\nan important distinction (Baker, 2001). In Seattle, at least some of the news produced for\na print edition of the PI is now created for the Web. Even if the audience for the online\nedition is smaller, the positive externalities of the news it creates may still exist. In Denver,\nthe amount of local news was simply reduced.\nThis raises another compelling theoretical question: Is the decline of civic engagement\ndriven by a decrease in the production of news or a decrease in the consumption of it?\nPerhaps Denver and Seattle, as they lost their second newspaper, simply retreated to the\nlevel of other one-newspaper towns. If this is the case, then it would imply that decreased\nproduction of news was the critical shift. Simple analyses show that civic engagement in\nthe one- and two-newspaper top 20 metropolitan areas is statistically indistinguishable.13\nLooking at the top 50 metropolitan areas, it appears that civic engagement is significantly\nhigher in one-paper markets--but this comparison is conflated by the fact that the one-\nnewspaper communities tend to be smaller. At least as far back as T\u00f6nnies and Loomis\n(1957), researchers have theorized that social ties are stronger in smaller communities.\nIn the regressions reported above, however, overall circulation is included as a term to\ntest the importance of readership. It is nonsignificant, which undermines the notion that\nreadership matters. Again, this question warrants further research as the current study does\nnot yield a satisfying answer.\nIn sum, the evidence reported here implies that Seattle and Denver suffered significant\nnegative declines in civic engagement when they lost one of their daily newspapers. But\nperhaps the causal ordering of this relationship is reversed: It is possible that the newspapers\nwere no longer viable because of apathy or weak civic engagement in these communities.\nThe available contextual evidence undermines this perspective. The decline in newspaper\ncirculation in Denver and Seattle was no worse than the nationwide trends. Levels of civic\nengagement in the communities were high, relative to the top 20 cities, in 2008, but this\nwas consistent with prior measurements. And in Seattle, a community organization formed\nexplicitly to fight the demise of the PI in court years before its eventual closure. In the end,\nthe PI and Rocky were victims of economics in a changing media environment: Very few\ncities can support two local newspapers, no matter what their civic value may be.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations, both in terms of its macro-level conceptualization and\nmicro-level operationalization. Taking a wide view, perhaps the most significant limitation\nis the fact that no two cities are entirely alike. To a certain extent, this limits the utility of\ncross-city comparisons. Additionally, the data utilized in these analyses are parsed at the\nmetropolitan level--perhaps an overly inclusive approach for measuring the influence of\nan urban newspaper. Metropolitan areas are richly varied, and working with city units that\ncorrespond more closely to the newspapers' distribution areas might capture their influence\nDead Newspapers and Civic Engagement 145\nmore precisely. But, as Kaniss (1997) suggests, major metropolitan papers make waves\nbeyond urban borders.\nIn addition, the actual analyses in this study are undermined by a pair of specific\ndrawbacks in the available data. First, the 2009 survey does not contain a newspaper read-\nership item, which means that readership cannot be used as a control in the comparisons.\nSecond, there are some minor variations in the demographic profiles of the city-level sam-\nples from year to year. These variations could be the source of any observed differences\nin the year-over-year comparisons. Analyses conducted at the community and group lev-\nels overcome these limitations, but without individual-level data, some questions cannot\nbe answered. Additionally, though the study has two time points and two key cities, any\nyear-over-year change could be aberrant and not indicative of a trend or effect. Given data\nover a longer period, other cities that lost a newspaper could be added to the treatment\ngroup and civic engagement could be studied over a greater number of years. Preliminary\nanalysis of the 2010 CPS data suggests that a follow-up study will yield additional\ninsights.\nStill, the study presented here has many advantages when compared to similar studies\nof localized civic engagement. Rather than a single-city, cross-sectional design, the CPS\ndata allow for year-over-year within- and across-city comparisons. Because of this, the\nstudy provides a unique illumination of civic engagement as well as the importance of\nnewspapers to their communities. The quasi-experimental design employed here has its\ndrawbacks, but as Mondak puts it, with this approach \"internal and external validity are\nmaximized within a single research design, linking the two threads that have threatened to\nunravel so many previous studies of the electoral significance of news media\" (1995, p. 2).\nThe results here are not causally definitive, but they are a significant contribution to the\nexisting body of literature regarding the importance of local media.\nConclusion\nFor generations, newspapers have been many things to many people: tool, companion,\nprotector, amusement, and so on. That newspapers are important to their readers and com-\nmunities should be self-evident--but scholars have struggled to prove this empirically. This\nstudy suggests that the value of newspapers, even in their current reduced economic and\nphysical state, can be observed--though perhaps only after their demise. A common refrain\nfrom new media pundits is that newspapers are not important per se. Rather, news is impor-\ntant, and it can be delivered more efficiently electronically. In terms of distribution, this is\nclearly true. But the story may be different when the nuances of the transition from analog to\ndigital media are considered. In a newspaper, news is literally on top; on the Internet, news\nmay be easily overwhelmed by the preponderance of other content. In addition, metropoli-\ntan newspapers are inherently local, and their presence is a tie between lifeworld and system\nin their communities. This triangulation between lifeworld, system, and physical place is\nnot necessarily replicated by digital media. And, as dead newspapers are replaced over time\nby new media, it is possible that citizens' relationships with each other and their society will\nfundamentally change as well.\nSo how important are newspapers? The results in this article suggest that eliminat-\ning a local newspaper from a community leads to less civic engagement in the immediate\naftermath among the citizens of that community. How citizens replace that newspaper and\nwhat the contours of civic engagement look like going forward are questions for future\nresearchers. The advent of new communication opportunities suggests that new forms of\nengagement will also develop. Thus far, there are many questions about the importance of\nplace online: For example, why should any one place matter when we may all be virtual\nand interconnected? And yet our society is still geographically organized and governed.\nUltimately, if we desire healthy and productive democratic communities, then the provi-\nsioning of local news--which helps tie citizens to each other and their communities--must\ncontinue. Newspapers such as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Rocky Mountain News\nmay be gone, but a commitment to local news and information cannot be abandoned.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed on the publisher's website at http://dx.\nNotes\n1. Technically, the PI lives on as an ad-supported Web site with a vastly reduced staff.\n2. Another way to say this is that local media provide the communication infrastructure (Kim &\nBall-Rokeach, 2006) for civic engagement to develop.\n3. See Appendix 1 for a full version of the civic engagement supplement questionnaire.\n4. Basic demographic control variables are also included in the 2008-only regression analyses.\nThese items allow for the discrete importance of newspaper readership to be better assessed. Wording\nand recodes of these variables can be found in Appendix 1.\n5. The newspaper readership variable is included in the regression models below as a 0\u00ad4 scale\nthat runs from not at all (0) to basically every day (4).\n6. The Rocky Mountain News closed on February 27, 2009; the Post-Intelligencer ended its print\nrun on March 17, 2009. Consequently, the timing of the CPS works very well to capture a before and\nafter snapshot of civic engagement in Denver and Seattle.\n7. See Appendix Table 1 for aggregate civic engagement and social capital change for the top\n8. Levels of civic engagement and social capital for the top 20 CPS metropolitan areas are\nreported in Appendix Table 1. Among these cities, aggregate civic engagement in Seattle was second\nonly to Washington, DC; Denver was fifth overall in civic engagement. The aggregate change in civic\nengagement in Denver--but not Seattle--is significant. The change in social capital is not significant\nin either city.\n9. Models that include a variable that reflects the change in the non-White population in each city\nfrom 2008 to 2009 were also run (see Appendix Table 2). Table 3 shows that, at the national level, non-\nWhite respondents report significantly lower civic engagement than White respondents. Since there\nwere significantly more non-White residents of Denver in the 2009 CPS civic engagement sample\n(Table 2), it is possible that a decline in the level of civic engagement could be explained by this pop-\nulation shift--though there was no significant relationship between race and civic engagement in the\n2008 Denver regression in Table 3. When the variable tracking the change in non-White populations\nwas included in regressions predicting change in civic engagement, it was consistently nonsignificant\nand the significant, negative effect for newspaper closure held.10. See Appendix Table 2.\n11. In 2000, the Saguaro Seminar coordinated surveys of social capital and civic engagement\nin 40 communities across the country using the same instrument. This survey includes items very\nsimilar to four of the five civic engagement indicators used as dependent variables in this study; the\nomitted item is the question about contacting a local official.
