Child overweight status was de-\nfined as a body mass index greater than or equal to the 95th\npercentile for age and sex from measured anthropomet-\nrics at the age of 7 years. The base model included rela-\ntionship of the safety reporter to the child, sex, and base-\nline body mass index z score at the age of 4.5 years.\nCovariates tested included maternal marital status, educa-\ntion, and depressive symptoms; child race/ethnicity; par-\nticipation in structured after-school activities; Home Ob-\nservation for Measurement of the Environment total score;\nand neighborhood social cohesiveness.\nResults: The sample was 85% white, and 10% of the chil-\ndren were overweight.

Public health efforts may\nbenefit from policies directed toward improving both ac-\ntual and perceived neighborhood safety.\ntional data confirm the\ngrowing obesity epidemic:\nchildren are overweight\n(defined as a body mass index [BMI]\n95th percentile for age and sex)1 and the\nracial disparities continue to increase.2\nWell-described risk factors for childhood\noverweight in the United States include\nAfrican American or Hispanic race/\nethnicity,2 elevated parental BMI,3,4 and a\nlarge amount of television viewing.5 The\nmost recent data suggest that lower socio-\neconomic status is associated with over-\nweight in children,4,6 but the relationship\nis complicated and appears to vary based\non a combination of sex, age, race/\nethnicity, and the degree of poverty.7 The\nhome environment and parenting have re-\nceived significant attention in the litera-\nture,4,8-11 but the neighborhood and built\nenvironment as independent contribu-\ntors to child overweight risk have not been\nexamined as thoroughly. The built envi-\nronment, which has been associated with\nother health outcomes,12-15 has been rec-\nognized by the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention as a potentially im-\nportant area for public policy to address\nthe childhood obesity epidemic16 and an\narea that requires additional research.17\nOur clinical experience in an urban pe-\ndiatricclinicthatservesalow-incomepopu-\nlation has been that unsafe neighborhoods\nsignificantly affect children's daily activi-\nties. Anecdotally, parents in an urban set-\nting frequently express their reluctance to\nallow their children to play outside for fear\nof exposure to violence, crime, and illicit\ndrug use. Prior assessments of perception\nof neighborhood safety have focused on\nphysical activity levels as an outcome18,19 or\nused children's (not parents') assessments\nof neighborhood safety.19 However, paren-\ntal perception of neighborhood safety may\nbe more salient than the child's perception\nbecause parents of young children typi-\nAuthor Affiliations: Center for\nHuman Growth and\nDevelopment and Department\nof Pediatrics and\nCommunicable Diseases,\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann\nArbor (Dr Lumeng); Data\nCoordinating Center\n(Ms Appugliese) and\nDepartment of Biostatistics\n(Dr Cabral), Boston University\nSchool of Public Health, Boston,\nMass; Center for Applied\nStudies in Education, University\nof Arkansas at Little Rock\n(Dr Bradley); and Department\nof Pediatrics, Boston University\nSchool of Medicine, Boston\n(Dr Zuckerman).\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

We focused on overweight at the age of 7\nyears because overweight prevalence increases most rap-\nidly in childhood around this age,1 and the racial/ethnic\ndisparities in overweight prevalence also widen signifi-\ncantly during this same period of childhood.1 We hy-\npothesized that parents who perceive their neighbor-\nhood as unsafe would be more likely to have overweight\nchildren because they restrict their children's access to\noutdoor activities. We also hypothesized that this rela-\ntionship would be attenuated by the availability of an after-\nschool program, a stimulating home environment, or in-\ncreased social cohesiveness in the neighborhood. In\nexamining these hypotheses, it is critical to control for\npotentially confounding factors known to be associated\nwith obesity.\nMETHODS\nThe sample was composed of children and their parents en-\nrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human De-\nvelopment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development\n(NICHD-SECCYD). The NICHD-SECCYD20 is a longitudinal\nstudy of relationships between child behavior and develop-\nment and key developmental contexts, especially child care ex-\nperience. Families who participated in this study were re-\ncruited through hospital visits to mothers shortly after the birth\nof a child in 1991. Families lived in the areas of Little Rock,\nArk; Irvine, Calif; Lawrence, Kan; Boston, Mass; Morganton,\nNC; Philadelphia, Pa; Pittsburgh, Pa; Charlottesville, Va; Se-\nattle, Wash; and Madison, Wis.\nOf the 8986 mothers who gave birth during the sampling\nperiod, 5416 (60%) met the eligibility criteria. Mothers were\nrequired to be healthy, to be older than 18 years, to not be plan-\nning to move within the next year, to live within an hour of\nthe study site, and to be conversant in English with a single-\nton child whose birth was normal and uncomplicated. An ad-\nditional inclusion criterion at the Philadelphia site was that fami-\nlies live in a neighborhood that was not extremely unsafe as\ndocumented by local police, given the planned home visits. One\nhundred thirty-one families (1.4% of the original pool of 8986\npotential families) were excluded for this reason. Notably, the\nstudy protocol for the duration of the study dictated that if the\nneighborhood was deemed too unsafe for a home visit, the home\nvisit would still be completed but with a security guard or po-\nlice officer present.\na conditional random sampling plan that ensured that the re-\ncruited families reflected economic, educational, and ethnic di-\nagreed to participate. Of the 1526 families who agreed to partici-\ntial sample was representative of the demographics of the catch-\nment areas from which the sample was recruited: 24% of the\nchildren were of an ethnic/racial minority, 10% of the mothers\nhad less than a high school education, and 14% of the mothers\nwere single at the time of the child's birth. The study involved\nextensive data collection at frequent intervals. Data used in this\nanalysis were collected during assessments scheduled for chil-\ndren at the age of 4.5 years and in the spring and fall of the child's\nfirst grade year in school. This study was approved by the insti-\ntutional review boards of all pertinent institutions.\nThe Neighborhood Questionnaire is a 16-item measure of neigh-\nborhood characteristics that was completed during the child's\nfirst-grade year in school by the mother and another adult liv-\ning in the home who acted as a caregiver (hereafter referred to\nas the father). More than 85% of these caregivers were fathers,\n9% were the mother's partner, and the remainder were grand-\nparents or relatives.22 Two scales of the Neighborhood Ques-\ntionnaire are the Neighborhood Safety Subscale (NSS) and the\nNeighborhood Social Involvement Subscale.23\nThe NSS score consists of the mean of 5 items. On the over-\nall Neighborhood Questionnaire, the number of possible re-\nsponse categories (eg, items on the Likert scale) varied from 2\nto 10, and on the NSS, response categories varied from 4 to 5.\nResponses were therefore rescaled to a 0 to 10 range and av-\neraged to provide the overall score via the methods used in the\noriginal scale. Parents responded to the following questions:\n(1) \"How do you feel about your neighborhood?\" (2) \"How\nsatisfied are you with police protection around here?\" (3) \"How\noften are there problems with muggings, burglaries, assaults,\nor anything else like that around here?\" (4) \"How much of a\nproblem is the selling and using of drugs around here?\" and\n(5) \"How well do the police and people in this neighborhood\nget along?\" Higher scores represent greater perceived neigh-\nborhood safety.\nAll 768 children had an NSS score from at least 1 reporter;\n739 had an NSS score from 2 reporters, one of whom was al-\nways the mother. The NSS scores differed significantly based\non the identity of the reporter, with mothers perceiving the\nneighborhood as slightly safer than fathers (=0.16; P=.004).\nWhen both parents completed the NSS questionnaire, we used\nthe score that reflected a perception of the neighborhood as less\nsafe based on the assumption that the parent who had the great-\nest concern about safety would do more to control the child's\naccess to people and places outside the home. We therefore con-\ntrolled for the identity of the neighborhood safety reporter a\npriori in the base model.\nHeight and weight were measured during the laboratory visit\nat the age of 4.5 years and in the spring of the child's first grade\nyear in school (when children in the United States are on av-\nerage 7 years old). Trained research assistants certified for ac-\ncuracy in measurement weighed the children, who were lightly\nclothed and without shoes, on a physician's scale (Detecto phy-\nsician's scale model 437, Cardinal/Detecto, Webb City, Mo) to\nthe nearest 100 g. Children's height was measured without shoes,\nusing a T square, to the nearest 0.3 cm. Details of the measure-\nment procedures are documented elsewhere.24 The BMI was cal-\nculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height\nin meters, and child overweight was defined dichotomously as\na BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and\nsex based on National Center for Health Statistics norms.25\nDemographic data consisted of the child's sex, race/ethnicity\n(white, black, or other), maternal marital status (single vs not),\nand maternal education (years of education completed). Ma-\nternal education was included as a continuous variable. We\nelected to use maternal education as our measure of socioeco-\nnomic status because this variable had the most complete data\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Maternal education was correlated\nwith income-to-needs ratio (Spearman rank correlation=0.59;\nAdditional characteristics assumed to modify an association\nbetween perception of neighborhood safety and overweight were\ntested as potential covariates.

The HOME\nwas administered by trained observers during home visits at the\nchild's age of 4.5 years. The HOME is an observational measure\nofthestimulationandsupportavailabletothechildinthehome.27\nThe NICHD-SECCYD did not include maternal anthropometric\ndata or child television-viewing patterns in the time frame of this\nanalysis.\nAll data analysis was performed using SAS statistical software,\nversion 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). In our analyses, we\nexcluded children without data for NSS scores (n=337) or BMI\nat first grade (n=371). Children who had moved residences in\nthe past 12 months were also excluded (n=162), since we were\ninterested in assessing the role of the neighborhood in over-\nweight risk. We examined the sample included in our model\nand found statistically significant differences. Although the NSS\nscores did not differ significantly (P=.76), children included\nin the sample were more likely to be overweight (10% vs 6%;\nditional information regarding differences in the samples is avail-\nable from the authors on request.\nUnivariate statistics were first computed to provide a de-\nscription of the sample of 768 children. We dichotomized the\nchild's BMI at the age of 7 years as overweight (BMI 95th per-\ncentile) vs not overweight to create a dependent variable that\ncould be used in a multiple logistic regression model.\nThen, bivariate analyses were performed to inform the de-\nvelopment of the multivariate model. We analyzed all covari-\nates by overweight status using t tests for continuous variables\nand cross-tabulations with 2 tests. We analyzed associations\nbetween NSS scores and these covariates with t tests, analysis\nof variance, and correlation coefficients. To characterize the re-\nlationship among neighborhood safety, race/ethnicity, and so-\ncioeconomic status, we regressed the NSS score on race/\nethnicity and socioeconomic status. We also performed a cross-\ntabulation of overweight status and NSS score in quartiles (with\ntial nonlinearity in their relationship. We next fit logistic re-\ngression models with overweight status as the outcome.\nWe accounted for clustering by site with bias-corrected gen-\neralized estimating equations based on the methods of Mancl\nand DeRouen.28,29 We computed both unadjusted and ad-\njusted odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence in-\ntervals from these logistic regression models. We used an  level\nof.05(2-tailed)todeterminestatisticalsignificance.Abasemodel\nfor estimating overweight status on the parent's perception of\nneighborhood safety was created including child sex and iden-\ntity of the safety reporter a priori.\nEach of the candidate covariates was then tested by entering\nthem one by one into the base model. Covariates that altered the\nrelationship of NSS scores to child overweight in these models\nby more than 10% were retained in the final model.30 Although\nthis method of modeling is not able to test for potential joint con-\nfounding, limiting the number of covariates included simulta-\nneously in the model allowed us to maintain the stability of the\nmodel. In addition, variables found to be differentially distrib-\nuted between those in the analysis sample and those not in the\nsample were evaluated for potential confounding effects.\nRESULTS\nThe sample included 768 children. The mean\u00b1SD age\nof the children at the time of the anthropometric mea-\nsures in the spring of first grade was 7.0\u00b10.3 years (range,\n6.3-8.1 years). Approximately half of the sample were male\nand 10% were overweight, consistent with national data\nfor children of this age.31 The mean\u00b1SD NSS score was\nNSS scores were normally distributed with a slight posi-\ntive skew. Of the mothers, 42% had at least a bachelor's\ndegree; 20% had a high school education or less\n(Table 1). Overweight children had mothers who were\nless educated and came from homes with lower HOME\nscores. However, overweight children did not differ\nfrom children who were not overweight by sex, race/\nethnicity, relationship of the safety reporter to the child,\nmaternal marital status, maternal depressive symptoms,\namount of structured after-school activities, or Neigh-\nborhood Social Involvement Subscale scores (Table 1).\nIn bivariate analyses, lower parental neighborhood\nsafety ratings were associated with African American race,\nlower maternal education, more maternal depressive\nsymptoms, fewer structured after-school activities for the\nchild, and a lower HOME total score. Child sex, child\nage (restricted to first grade), and maternal marital sta-\ntus were not related to parental neighborhood safety rat-\nings (Table 2).\nIn an attempt to better characterize perception of neigh-\nborhood safety in relation to race/ethnicity and socio-\neconomic status, we performed regression analysis of race/\nethnicity on parental neighborhood safety ratings,\nadjusting for maternal education as a proxy for socio-\neconomic status. Given the limited sample size, we cat-\negorized race/ethnicity as white and nonwhite. Race/\nethnicity was significantly independently associated with\nparental perception of neighborhood safety. White par-\nents were significantly more likely to perceive the neigh-\nindependent of socioeconomic status (P.001).\nResults from the bivariate analyses showed that parents\nof children who were overweight in first grade per-\nceived their neighborhoods as significantly less safe than\nparents of children who were not overweight (P.001)\n(Table 1).

We found that\n17% of those in the first quartile (least perceived neigh-\nborhood safety) were overweight compared with 10% in\nthe second quartile, 13% in the third quartile, and only\n4% in the fourth quartile (highest perceived safety). We\nalso estimated this relationship in logistic regression mod-\nels that accounted for clustering by site (Table 3). The\nrelationship between parental perception of neighbor-\nhood safety and a higher risk of overweight in first grade\npersisted in the base model, which controlled for child\nsex and identity of the neighborhood safety reporter\n(Table 3). Neither child sex nor identity of the safety re-\nporter, variables included as confounders a priori, was\nsignificant in the model. None of the candidate covari-\nates altered the relationship between perception of neigh-\nborhood safety and overweight in first grade by more than\n10%. We tested for the presence of interactions between\nthe covariates by adding terms to the multiple logistic\nregression model. We examined interactions of percep-\ntion of neighborhood safety and sex, perception of neigh-\nborhood safety and identity of safety reporter, and iden-\ntity of safety reporter and sex. None of these interactions\nwere statistically significant.\nBy adding BMI z score at the age of 4.5 years as a con-\ntinuous variable into the base model (which included child\nsex and identity of the safety reporter) as a covariate, we\nwere able to statistically control for variability in BMI al-\nready present at the age of 4.5 years. Statistical removal\nof this variability enabled us to focus on overweight that\ndeveloped between the ages of 4.5 and 7 years. If adjust-\ning for BMI z score at the age of 4.5 years had signifi-\ncantly reduced or eliminated the association between NSS\nscores and overweight status at the age of 7 years, it would\nsuggest that children were overweight before parental NSS\nscores were obtained and therefore weaken the explana-\ntory model. Adjusting for BMI z score at the age of 4.5\nTable 1.

Per our stated methods, we re-entered the same\ncandidate covariates into the base model one by one and\nretained those that altered the relationship between per-\nception of neighborhood safety and overweight in first\ngrade by more than 10%. Again, none of the covariates\naltered the relationship between parental perception of\nneighborhood safety and overweight in first grade, and\nnone of the interactions examined were statistically sig-\nnificant. The change in the odds ratio for overweight risk\nwhen controlling for BMI z score at 4.5 years indicates\nthat parental perception of neighborhood safety inde-\npendently increases overweight risk in the age range of\n4.5 to 7 years, although the effect also operates to some\ndegree at younger ages (Table 3).\nCOMMENT\nResults from a diverse sample representing 10 different\nsites across the United States indicate that parental per-\nception of the neighborhood as unsafe was indepen-\ndently associated with an increased risk of overweight\nat the age of 7 years. To our knowledge, this study is the\nfirst to systematically investigate the relationship of pa-\nrental perception of neighborhood safety and child-\nhood overweight in a sample with geographic, ethnic, and\nsocioeconomic diversity while analytically controlling for\na large number of potentially confounding factors.\nPrevious studies in children that focused on the rela-\ntionship among neighborhood safety, physical activity,\nand BMI have shown conflicting results. In a study19 of\nHispanic, white, and Vietnamese fourth graders of di-\nverse socioeconomic status, children's (not parents') per-\nceptions of a more dangerous neighborhood were asso-\nciated with increased self-reported physical activity and\nyear-old children linked decreased activity patterns to\nchild and parent perception of less neighborhood safety,\nbut the generalizability of this study to healthy children\nis unclear. The differences in our findings and these prior\nstudies may be partially explained by the low correla-\ntion between child and parental report of neighborhood\nviolence32 or the younger age of children in our study.\nParental perception of neighborhood safety likely oper-\nates more strongly than that of the child in altering life-\nstyle because parents exert significant control over young\nWe were concerned that region of residence might me-\ndiate the relationship between neighborhood safety and\noverweight, but accounting for clustering based on study\nsite did not alter the relationship. Measures of socioeco-\nnomic status also did not eliminate the observed asso-\nciation between perception of neighborhood safety and\noverweight, which would be the case if parental percep-\ntion of neighborhood safety were only a proxy for socio-\neconomic status. In addition, potential protective fac-\ntors, such as structured after-school activities, increased\nsocial cohesion in the neighborhood, or a high-quality\nhome environment did not alter the relationship be-\ntween parental perception of neighborhood safety and\noverweight. In effect, there may well be a relatively simple\nand straightforward relationship between living in a dan-\ngerous neighborhood and overweight; namely, in at-\ntempting to protect their children from harm, parents not\nonly decrease the kind of physical activity that comes from\nplaying outdoors in the neighborhood but inadvert-\nently increase the likelihood of sedentary activity and\nsnacking that comes from staying indoors.\nWe found significant differences in perception of neigh-\nborhood safety based on race/ethnicity. Most US neigh-\nborhoods continue to be racially segregated.35 It is pos-\nsible that one of the many contributors to the racial\ndisparities in overweight prevalence2 may be higher crime\nrates and lower perception of neighborhood safety among\nAfrican Americans.34,36 However, our study included a\nrelatively small sample of children of minority race/\nethnicity. Our inability to detect the well-documented\ndifferences in overweight prevalence by race/ethnicity,\npresumably because of low statistical power, suggests that\nthese findings may not be generalizable to populations\nof minority race/ethnicity. The role of perceived neigh-\nborhood safety as a possible mediator between minority\nTable 3.

All rights reserved.\nrace/ethnicity and childhood overweight requires fur-\nther investigation with a larger sample size of children\nof minority race/ethnicity.\nAlthough violent crime rates are lower today than they\nhave been in 10 years, less than 10% of people report that\ntheir fear of crime has decreased.36 It is therefore impor-\ntant not only to understand contributors to increased vio-\nlence and crime but also to understand and address the\nfactors that contribute to the perception that a neigh-\nborhood is unsafe. A potential area for intervention is the\nredesign of neighborhoods. Individuals who perceive their\nneighborhoods as unsafe cite open drinking and drug use\nas significant contributors to feeling unsafe.36 As re-\nviewed by Ashe et al,37 land use planning and zoning has\nlong been used to address endemic public health prob-\nlems and could be used creatively to address the child-\nhood obesity epidemic by improving some of the fea-\ntures that contribute to increased neighborhood violence\nand the perception of the community as unsafe. In con-\nsidering neighborhood redesign, the National Institute\nof Health recently outlined a research agenda.38 Of the\nissues that require further study, identifying factors that\nmediate or moderate built environment effects was of pri-\nmary importance. No matter how neighborhoods are re-\ndesigned to allow children to walk to school or the neigh-\nborhood store, parents must feel safe allowing their\nchildren to do so.\nOur study has several limitations. The findings may not\nbe generalizable to certain populations, such as recent\nimmigrants or the children of adolescent mothers. Our\nsample size of overweight children was relatively small.\nTherefore, the power to detect some of the differences\nmay have been limited. We also did not have measures\nof actual neighborhood violence. However, prior data have\nindicated that poor, urban, African American mothers'\nratings of their neighborhood quality correlate with ac-\ntual crime rates.39 Parents likely base their decisions on\nwhether to send their children outside on their percep-\ntion of neighborhood safety and not on statistics, which\nmay account for a prior study40 not showing an associa-\ntion of neighborhood crime statistics with overweight in\npreschoolers. We did not have data regarding physical\nactivity measures or diet, which limits our ability to evalu-\nate potential mechanisms of the association. Finally, as\nwith many studies of this nature, the sample with com-\nplete data included in our analysis differs from the sample\nwithout complete data; therefore, our findings may not\nbe generalizable to the reference population of the\nNICHD-SECCYD. Although we tested covariates that are\npredictors of missingness as potential covariates in the\nmodel and they did not alter the results, it remains pos-\nsible that our results would have differed had complete\ndata for the entire sample been available.\nThe independent effect of the neighborhood is chal-\nlenging to study owing to difficulties in controlling for\nindividual-level characteristics that may act as confound-\ners.41 Our data set does not include maternal weight; there-\nfore, we were unable to control for this. However, we be-\nlieve it is unlikely that maternal weight status is\nindependently related to perception of neighborhood\nsafety and therefore do not believe this would have acted\nas a significant confounder. We also did not have a mea-\nsure of television viewing in our data set. An unsafe neigh-\nborhood may reduce outside activity, increase televi-\nsion viewing, and thereby increase the risk of overweight.\nHowever, amount of television viewing and overweight\nin young children has not been as strongly associated as\nit has been in older children.5,42 Therefore, it seems un-\nlikely that inclusion of television viewing would have\neliminated the relationship. In addition, studies of ma-\nternal obesity or child television viewing as risk factors\ndid not include neighborhood safety as a covariate. Un-\nderstanding the independent role of each of these vari-\nables will depend on a study that is able to include all of\nthem in predicting child overweight.\nSUMMARY\nThese data show a significant relationship between pa-\nrental perception of an unsafe neighborhood and over-\nweight at the age of 7 years even when many potentially\nconfounding variables are controlled, including base-\nline BMI 3 years before the measures of interest. Many\nareas of policy development related to the built environ-\nment and neighborhood safety have not traditionally been\nconsidered relevant to child health. However, such poli-\ncies may have important implications for childhood over-\nweight. For the individual physician, these results sug-\ngest the need to understand the character of a child's\nneighborhood when making recommendations for life-\nstyle and activity changes aimed at obesity prevention and\ntreatment.\nCorrespondence: Julie C.
