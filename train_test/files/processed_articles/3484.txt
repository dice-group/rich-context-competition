When a dura\npuncture occurs, the distance from the\ndura mater to the spinal cord (DTC) is a\ncritical factor in neurological injury caused\nby needle trauma.5,6 The longer the DTC is,\nthe larger the safety margin will be.5,6\nThe anatomical dimensions related to\nTEA, including the DTC, are not uniform\nat different vertebral levels;7,8 thus, it is\nnecessary to investigate the difference in\ndistance according to the vertebral level\nto determine the target level and choose\na safe method of approach. Several\nstudies have investigated the DTC in\nthe thoracic region and have reported\nthat the vertical distance was significantly\ngreater in the middle thoracic region than at\nthe upper and lower thoracic levels.7,8\nHowever, these studies examined a relatively\nsmall number of patients and did not\nconsider the angle at which the needle\napproached.7,8 Safety margins can change\nat the same vertical DTC using different\napproach angles. Previous studies have\ninvestigated the DTC at just three regions,\nrather than at all thoracic intervertebral\nThe present study retrospectively investi-\ngated the DTC at all thoracic segments by\nanalysing the magnetic resonance (MR)\nimages of patients. The length from the\nskin to the dura mater (STD) and the DTC\nat various approach lines from three differ-\nent thoracic vertebral levels were also\nexamined to understand the shape of the\ninterspinous space and develop safe\napproach strategies.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study identified consecu-\ntive patients at the Seoul National\nUniversity Boramae Hospital, Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea who underwent MR\nimaging of the thoracic vertebral segments\nThe MR images were evaluated by\nradiologists. Exclusion criteria were as fol-\nlows: (i) patients who were diagnosed with\nthoracic spinal or medullary disease that\ncould affect the contour of the spinal cord\nand epidural space (e.g. severe compression\nfracture, spinal cord tumour or cerebro-\nspinal fluid seeding); (ii) patients whose\nanatomical dimensions were unclear due to\npoor-quality MR images; (iii) patients < 15\nyears of age.\nEthical approval was provided by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Seoul\nNational University Boramae Hospital,\nSeoul, Republic of Korea (reference\nalso granted a waiver of informed consent\nfor this retrospective study. This study was\nregistered with the Clinical Research\nInformation Service (http://cris.nih.go.kr/\ncris/en/use_guide/cris_introduce.jsp; refer-\nMagnetic resonance image analyses\nMagnetic resonance imaging was under-\ntaken on a MAGNETOM\u00d5 Verio 3.0 T\nscanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).\nT2-weighted spine MR images were\nacquired in the sagittal plane closest to the\nmidline of the vertebral column using a\nPicture Archiving and Communication\nSystem (INFINITT Healthcare, Seoul,\nRepublic of Korea). Three independent\nmedical observers trained in identifying\nspinal canal anatomy reviewed the images.\nThe most appropriate plane was evaluated\nat each level and all dimensions are mea-\nsured using a Preview program (Maroview\n5.4; INFINITT Healthcare).\nThe vertical DTC was measured at each\nthoracic intervertebral level. The line on the\nvertical DTC was estimated to be perpen-\ndicular to the spinal cord and dura mater at\neach level and started from the midpoint\nbetween two adjacent vertebral bodies\n(Figure 1). The STD and DTC were mea-\nsured on three different approach pathways\nlevels. The first approach pathway was the\n`U' line. The `U' line was defined as the line\ncontacting the lower border of the spinous\nprocess of the adjacent upper vertebra at the\nthoracic intervertebral level. The second was\nthe `L' line, which contacted the upper\nborder of the spinous process of the lower\nvertebra at the thoracic intervertebral space.\nTherefore, the `U' and `L' lines were the\nupper and lower borders of the interspinous\nspace, respectively, and were selected to\nevaluate the distinct outlines of the inter-\nspinous space at different thoracic regions\nand to demonstrate differences in the safety\nmargin according to various approach\nangles. The third was the `M' line, which\npassed the midpoint of two spinous process\ntips and the point that bisected the ligament\nflavum between the two spinous processes.\nThe `M' line was supposed to represent\na blind approach using the LOR technique.\nWhen performing TEA, a physician\ntouches two tips of adjacent spinous pro-\ncesses over the skin and searches for the\ninterspinous space. The midpoint of two\nadjacent tips was selected as a point on\nthe `M' line. Using the blind technique,\na needle can pass several courses in the\ninterspinous space. It was assumed that the\npoint bisecting the ligamentum flavum\nbetween the two processes suggested the\naverage of many possible courses and\nchose that point as another mark on the\n`M' line.\nThe angles between the `U' and `L' lines\nlevels were examined to analyse the trend in\nthe borders of the interspinous spaces and to\nevaluate variability in the approach angle at\neach intervertebral level (Figure 1).\nStatistical analyses\nFor each variable (DTC and STD), an\nintraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was\ncalculated to quantify agreement between\nFigure 1. Representative T2-weighted spine\nmagnetic resonance image showing the dimensions\nof the three approaching lines and the angle\nbetween the `U' and the `L' lines. The line on the\nvertical distance from the dura mater to the spinal\ncord (DTC) was estimated to be perpendicular to\nthe spinal cord (SC) and dura mater at each level and\nstarted from the midpoint between the two adja-\ncent vertebral bodies. The `U' line is the line\ncontacting the upper border of the interspinous\nspace and the `L' line contacts the lower border of\nthe interspinous space. The `M' line passes the\nmidpoint of two spinous process tips and the point\nthat bisects the ligamentum flavum between the two\nspinous processes.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.

However, accidental dura\npuncture during epidural analgesia occurs\nThis present study identified the anatom-\nical dimensions of the thoracic spinal canal\nin relation to TEA by MR imaging.\nReproducibility of measurements was ver-\nified by calculation of the ICCs between\nmeasurements. These current results\nrevealed that the vertical DTC was longer\nin the middle thoracic region than at the\nupper or lower thoracic levels and the\nshortest at the T11/12 levels. These current\nresults were in good agreement with prior\nstudies of the thoracic spinal canal.8,10 The\nspinal cord in the middle thoracic area is\nsituated more ventrally, but the spinal cord\noccupies more space at the upper and lower\nthoracic levels because of cervical and\nlumbar enlargement. Several previous stu-\ndies indicated that ligamentum flavum mid-\nline gaps at the thoracic vertebral levels were\nmore frequent than at the lumbar levels but\nintervertebral levels in patients (n \u00bc 346) who had undergone magnetic resonance\nimaging of the thoracic vertebral segments and who were included in this analysis\nof the anatomical safety margins in relation to thoracic epidural block.\nIntervertebral\nlevel Line STD, mm DTC, mm\nData presented as mean \u00c6 SD (ICC).\naA significant difference compared with corresponding values on `U' and `M' lines at the same\nintervertebral level (Bonferroni correction; P < 0.01).\nbA significant difference compared with corresponding values on `M' and `L' lines at the T10/\n11 intervertebral level (Bonferroni correction; P < 0.05).\nICC, intraclass correlation coefficient.\nTable 4.

Because a comparable effect of\nTEA can be expected from different thoracic\nlevels by adjusting the drug dose or extent of\ncatheter insertion, there are several possible\ntarget levels for needle insertion for an\nintended level of segmental block.\nTherefore, a significant difference in the\nvertical DTC between adjacent thoracic\nintervertebral levels is valuable to select an\ninsertion point with a larger safety margin.\nEnsuring a larger distance is one strategy\nto increase the safety margin during TEA\nand, of course, during spinal anaesthesia.\nA recent report presented a case of segmen-\ntal spinal anaesthesia for cholecystectomy in\na patient with severe lung disease.14\nThe present study demonstrated that the\nangle between the `U' and `L' lines was the\nlargest at the T1/2 level. The larger the angle\nis between the `U' and `L' lines, the higher\nthe flexibility will be regarding the angle of\nneedle insertion at the interspinous space.\nHowever, the objective difference in DTC\nbetween the `U' and `L' lines was greatest at\nthe T5/6 level, where the vertical DTC was\nlongest, indicating that variability in the\nsafety margin according to the needle inser-\ntion angle was the largest at T5/6 and that\nthe increase in the safety margin was most\nsignificant at the mid-thoracic region. Thus,\nthe STD and DTC on the `L' line were\nlonger than those on the `U' line or `M' line\nat the T1/2 and T5/6 levels. By contrast, the\nSTD and DTC were the longest on the `U'\nline at the lower thoracic region of T10/11.\nTherefore, we speculate that TEA can be\nmanaged more safely by inserting a needle\nthrough a pathway near the lower border of\nthe interspinous space at the upper or\nmiddle thoracic region and near the upper\nborder at lower levels than by approaching\nfrom a random direction, as represented by\nthe `M' line.\nThe `U' line at the upper or middle\nthoracic region and the `L' line at lower\nlevels might not be the longest pathway\npossible in the intervertebral space. For\nexample, a line that starts from the posterior\npart of the lower border to the upper end of\nthe ligamentum flavum suggests a greater\nsafety margin than the `L' line. Therefore,\nthe `U' and `L' lines are not absolute clinical\nguides for safety but references that can be\nused to understand the anatomy of the\nthoracic vertebral spine.\nThis present study had a number of limita-\ntions. First, approximately 9% of all patients\nintervertebral level that did not pass through\nthe interspinous space on the MR images. This\nwas because the lower thoracic spinous pro-\ncesses have more variable shapes, and the\nmidpoint of two adjacent tips can be far\napart from the centre of the posterior inter-\nspinous space. In those patients, the `M' line\ndoes not represent a blind approach and is just\nan imaginary line. Secondly, all of the data in\nthis study were measured using supine MR\nimages. However, most neuraxial blockades\nare performed with patients in the lateral\ndecubitus position with or without leg flexion.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the\nspinal cord and cauda equina move with\ngravity and also ventrally with leg flexion.7,15,16\nConsequently, it is expected that the safety\nmargin would be greater in a lateral than a\nsupine position. However, whether the\ncorrelation between spinal structure and verte-\nbral level would be maintained using a lateral\nposture is uncertain. Supplementary studies are\nneeded to elucidate the effect of various pos-\ntures on the thoracic vertebral canal.\nIn conclusion, there were differences in\nthe DTC among thoracic intervertebral\nlevels, the longest being at the T5/6 level\nand the shortest at the T11/12 level. By\ncomparing different approach angles, the\nsafety margin was found to be the longest on\nthe `L' line at the T1/2 and T5/6 levels and\nthe longest on the `U' line at lower thoracic\nregions. The variability of the safety margin\naccording to the angle of needle insertion\nwas the largest at T5/6. These differences\nmerit consideration to prevent serious cord\ndamage in association with TEA.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a Kangwon\nNational University research grant.\nReferences\n1.
