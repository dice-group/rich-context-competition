Rates of substance use in\nthis population have historically been high; in the late\nwomen used illicit substances [3,4]. Substance use during\npregnancy in HIV-infected women has negative implica-\ntions for transmission [5\u00ad8], infant outcomes [9\u00ad19], and\nthe health of the mother [20].\nOver time, the route of HIV acquisition among women\nhas changed in the United States. Whereas approximately\n50% of female AIDS cases were linked to injection drug\ninfection in only 14% of HIV diagnoses among women\n[22]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have\nexamined substance use patterns in HIV-infected\npregnant women over the last two decades.\nUsing data from two large US-based cohorts, we describe\nthe dramatic decrease in maternal substance use during\nwomen,and explore possible explanations for the decrease.\nMethods\nStudy participants and design\nThis study included women enrolled in the Women and\nInfants Transmission Study (WITS) or the Surveillance\nMonitoring for Antiretroviral Therapy Toxicities\n(SMARTT) protocol of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort\nStudy (PHACS). WITS enrolled women who gave birth\nSMARTT, written informed consent was obtained from\neach participating woman, and the institutional review\nboard at each study center approved study protocols.\nIn WITS, women had multiple study visits during\npregnancy. In SMARTT, two groups of women and\nchildren (dynamic and static) were enrolled. In the\ndynamic cohort, women were enrolled during pregnancy\nthrough 72 h postdelivery. The static cohort enrolled\nwomen with children aged 0\u00ad12 years. For both WITS\nand SMARTT, trained study personnel conducted\nstructured interviews at enrollment to assess demographic\ncharacteristics.\nWomen were eligible for this study if they were enrolled\nmation on substance use during pregnancy.\nSubstance use\nIn WITS, a questionnaire was administered at each\npredelivery visit to ascertain use of alcohol, tobacco,\nmarijuana, heroin, cocaine, and injected drugs during\npregnancy. One urine sample for drug testing was\ncollected at the intake visit and one was collected during\nlabor or immediately postpartum. Urine was screened\nfor cocaine, heroin/opiates, marijuana, alcohol, or their\nmetabolites using a radioimmunoassay followed by\nconfirmatory gas chromatography and mass spectrometry\nWomen in dynamic SMARTT completed a substance use\ninterview within 7 days of delivery, and women in static\nSMARTT completed this interview at time of enrollment\n[median \u00bc 3.7 years after pregnancy, interquartile range\n(IQR) \u00bc 1.8\u00ad6.2 years]. In a subsample of the dynamic\ncohort, meconium \u00ad an infant's first stool \u00ad was collected\nand screened for cocaine, heroin/opiates, marijuana,\nalcohol, tobacco, or their metabolites using an immu-\nnoassay technique followed by confirmatory gas chroma-\ntography and mass spectrometry [25].\nWomen were classified as using a substance if they self-\nreported or had a positive biological sample for alcohol,\ntobacco, marijuana, cocaine, or heroin during pregnancy.\nPolysubstance use was defined as using two or more\nsubstances during pregnancy.\nStatistical methods\nThe proportion of women in each substance use category\nwas calculated, stratified by year of delivery. To test\nwhether the proportion of women using substances\nduring pregnancy changed over time while accounting\nfor correlation between repeated pregnancies, we used\nlog binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE)\nmodels. As meconium samples were not available for all\nSMARTT participants, we conducted two sensitivity\nanalyses; the first included only WITS pregnancies,\nwhereas the second also included the SMARTT\npregnancies with meconium data.\nMultivariable logistic GEE models were constructed to\nevaluate predictors of substance use in the pre-highly\nethnicity, age, education, household income, marital\nstatus, HIV diagnosis prior to pregnancy, and antire-\ntroviral therapy regimen.\nTo evaluate trends within individuals, log binomial GEE\nmodels were used in the subset of women with multiple\npregnancies under observation in WITS/SMARTT.\nWe compared substance use prevalence in WITS/\nSMARTT with use among pregnant women in a\nnationally representative household survey, the National\nSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). In NSDUH,\nsubstance use during pregnancy is defined as self-report of\npast 30-day substance use and being pregnant. We\ncompared WITS/SMARTT and NSDUH beginning in\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Therefore, a total of 5451 pregnancies from\n4408 individual women were included in this analysis.\nMaternal characteristics for each pregnancy are described\nin Table 1.\nNearly 82% of respondents used at least one substance in\n1990; this proportion decreased linearly over time until\nA similar pattern was observed for each individual\nsubstance over the 23-year period.

Although the prevalence of\nsubstance use was initially considerably higher in WITS/\nSMARTT, it has become similar to that of pregnant\nwomen in the general US population.\nWomen who used substances in previous pregnancies had\nover a five-fold increased risk of using a substance in\nfuture pregnancies. Therefore, we posit that the observed\ndecrease in substance use is not due to the cessation of\nsubstance use in women who previously used substances,\nbut rather, HIV is affecting a different population of\nwomen. It is possible that an epidemiological transition\nhas occurred, in which the types of women becoming\ninfected with HIV in the Unites States has changed. This\nis supported by data from the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, which show that the primary route of\ninfection among women has gradually transitioned from\ninjection drug use to heterosexual contact [21,22].\nWe observed that substance use is inversely associated\nwith receiving antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women,\nconsistent with a past study of HIV-infected adults [45].\nOthers have reported current injection drug users were\nless likely than past users to receive antiretroviral therapy\n[46], and substance users not enrolled in treatment\nprogrammes were less likely to receive antiretroviral\ntherapy than those receiving treatment [47]. Because\nsubstance use is inversely associated with antiretroviral\ntherapy and a number of potential outcomes, it may be an\nimportant confounder in antiretroviral safety studies,\nespecially those using historical comparison data.\nOur study has several limitations. First, our sample may\nnot represent the larger population of HIV-infected\ndifferent biological specimens were used to confirm\nsubstance use in each cohort. Urine-based and meco-\nnium-based tests have varying sensitivity, specificity, and\nwomen in SMARTT had meconium samples analyzed\nfor substances, and some women in the static SMARTT\ncohort had long recall periods. However, restricting our\nanalysis to women with available biological assays suggest\nTobacco Alcohol\nCocaine Heroin\nMarijuana Any substance use\nFig. 1.

Furthermore, past analyses of the\ndynamic SMARTT cohort have shown reliable sensitivity\nand specificity of self-reported substance use compared\nwith biological measures [25]. Fourth, NSDUH's\nclassification of substance use during pregnancy (being\npregnant and using a substance in the past month) differs\nfrom that of WITS and SMARTT, and was not\nconfirmed by biological assays, meaning data from\nNSDUH in the Supplemental Digital Content may be\nunderestimated (http://links.lww.com/QAD/A595).\nFinally, this analysis could not investigate temporal trends\nin prescription opioids because WITS did not collect the\nnecessary information. However, few women in\nSMARTT (4.4%) reported medical or nonmedical use\nof prescription opioids during pregnancy.\nThis study provides important information about temporal\ntrends in substance use among HIV-infected pregnant\nwomen in the United States. We documented a dramatic\ndecrease in prevalence of substance use during pregnancy\nsince 1990, which may be due to a shift in the HIV\nepidemic among women in the United States. The finding\nthat substance use during pregnancy has historically been\nassociated with lack of antiretroviral use is concerning and\nmay warrant further investigation. Our observation that\nHIV-infected women who used substances in past\npregnancies are at increased risk of use during future\npregnancies suggests they may be important to target in\nefforts to further reduce substance use in this population.\n"
