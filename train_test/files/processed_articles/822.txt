Still, fundamental questions remain about what it is that communi-\nties \"supply\" (or fail to supply) that may explain the link between these\nstructural features of neighborhood environments and the rates of violent\ncrime. The traditional or perhaps idyllic notion of local communities as\n\"urban villages\" characterized by dense networks of personal social ties\ncontinues to pervade many theoretical perspectives on neighborhood\ncrime. Yet such ideal typical neighborhoods appear to bear little resem-\nblance to contemporary cities where weak ties prevail over strong ties and\nsocial interaction among residents is characterized by increasing instru-\nmentality. The urban village model is also premised on the notion that\nnetworks of personal ties and associations map neatly onto the geographic\nboundaries of spatially defined neighborhoods, such that neighborhoods\ncan be analyzed as independent social entities. By contrast, modern\nneighborhoods are often less distinctly defined with permeable borders.\nSocial networks in this setting are more likely to traverse traditional eco-\nlogical boundaries, implying that social processes are not neatly contained\nin geographic enclaves.\nIn short, despite marshalling impressive evidence that neighborhoods\nmatter even in the modern city, criminologists by and large continue to\nrely on the classic urban-village metaphor to explain why. This paper\nbuilds on recent criminological research to integrate key dimensions of\nneighborhood-level structure, process, and spatial embeddedness that may\nhelp to explain the puzzle of crime's ecological concentration. In particu-\nlar, we incorporate local institutional processes related to voluntary\nassociations and local organizations, along with extra-local processes\nrelated to the spatial dynamics of violent crime. We integrate these\ndimensions of the urban landscape with a theoretical framework highlight-\ning the role of social control and cohesion-even if not rooted in strong\npersonal ties-and neighborhood structural inequality. Our focus on ine-\nquality centers on the extreme concentration of socioeconomic resources\nat both the upper and lower tails of the distribution.\nOur approach draws its motivation from an intellectual tradition that\nseeks to explain variation in rates of crime and violence. In their classic\nwork, Shaw and McKay (1942) argued that low economic status, ethnic\n1. Space limitations preclude a literature review of structuralcovariates and vio-\nlence.

This theoretical definition of social disorganization has\nbeen formulated in systemicterms-that is, the local community is viewed\nas a complex system of friendship, kinship, acquaintanceship networks,\nand associational ties rooted in family life and ongoing socialization\nMore recently, the intellectual tradition of community-level research\nhas been revitalized by the increasingly popular idea of \"social capital.\"\nAlthough there are conflicting definitions, social capital is typically con-\nceptualized as embodied in the social ties among persons and positions\n(Coleman, 1990:304). Putnam defines social capital as \"features of social\norganization, such as networks, norms, and trust, that facilitate coordina-\ntion and cooperation for mutual benefit\" (1993:36). Whatever the specific\nformulation, the sources of social capital stem not from the attributes of\nindividuals but from the structure of social organization. The connection\nof systemic social disorganization and social capital theory has been articu-\nlated by Bursik (1999): Neighborhoods bereft of social capital (e.g., inter-\nlocking social networks) are less able to realize common values and\nmaintain the informal social controls that foster safety.\nThe intuitive appeal of social capital notwithstanding, there are reasons\nto problematize the process by which strong social ties translate into low\ncrime rates. First, in some neighborhood contexts, strong ties may impede\nefforts to establish social control. Wilson (1996), for example, has argued\nthat many poor neighborhoods where residents are tightly interconnected\nthrough network ties do not produce collective resources such as the social\ncontrol of disorderly behavior. His research suggests that disadvantaged\nurban neighborhoods are places where dense webs of social ties among\nneighbors may impede social organization: \"[Ilt appears that what many\nimpoverished and dangerous neighborhoods have in common is a rela-\ntively high degree of social integration (high levels of local neighboring\nwhile being relatively isolated from contacts in broader mainstream soci-\nety) and low levels of informal social control (feelings that they have little\ncontrol over their immediate environment, including the environment's\nnegative influences on their children)\" (pp. 63-64). In her study of a black\nmiddle-class community in Chicago (\"Groveland\"), Pattillo-McCoy (1999)\nalso acknowledges the limits of tight-knit social bonds in facilitating social\ncontrol. She argues that although dense local ties promote social integra-\ntion, they also foster the growth of networks that impede efforts to rid the\nneighborhood of drug- and gang-related crime: \"Because Groveland is\nvery stable, thick kin, neighborly, and friendship ties are the norm. These\nnetworks positively affect both the informal and formal supervision of\nyouth. ...But at the same time that dense social ties are good, they also\nhave negative repercussions. . .for organized criminal enterprises\" (p. 70).\nA second reason that it is problematic to assume a simple connection\nbetween strong social ties and low crime rates is that in many urban com-\nmunities, shared expectations for social control are maintained in the\nabsence of thick ties among neighbors (Sampson et al., 1999). Strong ties\namong neighbors are no longer the norm in many urban communities\nbecause friends and social support networks are decreasingly organized in\nGranovetter (1973) argued in his seminal essay, \"weak ties\"-i.e., less inti-\nmate connections between people based on more infrequent social inter-\naction-may be critical for establishing social resources, such as job\nreferrals, because they integrate the community by bringing together oth-\nerwise disconnected subgroups. Bellair (1997) extended this logic to the\nstudy of community crime by demonstrating that weak ties among neigh-\nbors, as manifested by less frequent patterns of social interaction, are pre-\ndictive of lower crime rates. Research on dense social ties thus reveals\nsomewhat of a paradox for crime theory. Many urbanites interact with\ntheir neighbors on a limited basis and thus appear to generate very little\nsocial capital. Moreover, urbanites whose strong ties are tightly restricted\ngeographically may actually produce an environment that discourages col-\nlective responses to local problems.\nproposed a focus on mechanisms that facilitate social control without\nrequiring strong ties or associations. As Warren (1975) noted, the com-\nmon belief that neighborhoods have declined in importance as social units\n\"is predicated on the assumption that neighborhood is exclusively a pri-\nmary group and therefore should possess the `face-to-face,' intimate, affec-\ntive relations which characterize all primary groups\" (p. 50). Rejecting\nthis outmoded assumption about the function of local communities, Samp-\nson et al. (1997) highlighted the combination of a working trust and shared\nwillingness of residents to intervene in social control. This linkage of trust\nand cohesion with shared expectations for control was defined as neigh-\nborhood \"collective efficacy.\" Just as self-efficacy is situated rather than\nglobal (one has self-efficacy relative to a particular task), a neighborhood's\nefficacy exists relative to specific tasks such as maintaining public order.\nViewed through this theoretical lens, collective efficacy is a task-specific\nconstruct that highlights shared expectations and mutual engagement by\nresidents in local social control (Sampson et al., 1999). Moving from a\nfocus on private ties to social efficacy signifies an emphasis on shared\nbeliefs in neighbors' conjoint capability for action to achieve an intended\neffect and, hence, an active sense of engagement on the part of residents.\nAs Bandura (1997) argues, the meaning of efficacy is captured in expecta-\ntions about the exercise of control, elevating the \"agentic\" aspect of social\nlife over a perspective centered on the accumulation of stocks of\nresources. This conception is consistent with the redefinition of social cap-\nital by Portes and Sensenbrenner as \"expectations for action within a col-\nDistinguishing between the resource potential represented by personal\nties, on the one hand, and the shared expectations among neighbors for\nengagement in social control represented by collective efficacy, on the\nother, may help clarify the systemic model. In particular, social networks\nfoster the conditions under which collective efficacy may flourish, but they\nare not sufficient for the exercise of control (see also Bursik, 1999). Thus,\ncollective efficacy may be seen as a logical extension of systemically based\nsocial disorganization and social capital theory. The difference is mainly\none of emphasis: Although we recognize and incorporate below the rele-\nvance of systemic networks for neighborhood social organization, we\nargue that collective capacity for social action, even if rooted in weak per-\nsonal ties, may constitute the more proximate social mechanism for under-\nstanding between-neighborhood variation in crime rates.\nIn this paper, we strive to make both substantive and methodological\ncontributions to neighborhood-level research on violence. Our integrated\nframework builds on the insights derived from social disorganization,\nsocial capital, and collective efficacy theory, coupled with a \"routine activi-\nties\" emphasis on the explanation of crime events. Criminal events\nrequire the intersection in time and space of three elements-motivated\noffenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians (Cohen\nand Felson, 1979). As such, crime can be ecologically concentrated\nbecause of the presence of targets or the absence of guardianship (e.g.,\ncollective efficacy), even if the pool of motivated offenders is more evenly\ndistributed across the city. We are thus interested in how neighborhoods\nfare as units of guardianship and collective efficacy; the outcome is the\nevent rate of homicide victimization. Applying this framework, we high-\nlight two neglected dimensions of neighborhood context: (1) spatial\ndynamics arising from neighborhood interdependence, and (2) social-insti-\ntutional processes.\nContrary to the common assumption in ecological criminology of ana-\nlytic independence, we argue that neighborhoods are interdependent and\ncharacterized by a functional relationship between what happens at one\npoint in space and what happens elsewhere. Spatial interdependence is\ntheoretically motivated on three grounds. First, we expect it to arise as a\nresult of the inexact correspondence between the neighborhood bounda-\nries imposed by census geography and the ecological properties that shape\nsocial interaction. One of the biggest criticisms of neighborhood-level\nresearch to date concerns the artificiality of boundaries; for example, two\nfamilies living across the street from one another may be arbitrarily\nassigned to live in different \"neighborhoods\" even though they share\nsocial ties. From the standpoint of systemic theory, it is important to\naccount for the social and institutional ties that link residents of urban\ncommunities to other neighborhoods, particularly those that are more spa-\ntially proximate to their neighborhood. Spatial models address this prob-\nlem by recognizing the interwoven dependence among (artificial)\nneighborhood units. The idea of spatial dependence thus challenges the\nurban village model, which implicitly assumes that geographically defined\nneighborhoods represent intact social systems that function as islands unto\nthemselves, isolated from the wider sociodeomographic dynamics of the\ncity.\nSecond, spatial dependence is implicated by the fact that homicide\noffenders are disproportionately involved in acts of violence near their\nactivities perspective, it follows that a neighborhood's \"exposure\" to homi-\ncide risk is heightened by geographical proximity to places where known\noffenders live (see also Cohen et al., 1981). Moreover, to the extent that\nthe risk of becoming a homicide offender is influenced by contextual fac-\ntors such as concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, and collective\nefficacy, spatial proximity to such conditions is also likely to influence the\nrisk of homicide victimization in a focal neighborhood.\nA third motivation for studying spatial dependence relates to the notion\nthat interpersonal crimes such as homicide are based on social interaction\nand thus subject to diffusion processes (Cohen and Tita, 1999; Messner et\n2000). Acts of violence may instigate a sequence of events that leads to\nfurther violence in a spatially channeled way. For example, many homi-\ncides, not just gang-related, are retaliatory in nature (Black, 1983; Block,\n1977). Thus, a homicide in one neighborhood may provide the spark that\neventually leads to a retaliatory killing in a nearby neighborhood. In addi-\ntion, most homicides occur among persons known to one another (Reiss\nand Roth, 1993),usually involving networks of association that follow geo-\ngraphical vectors.\nThere is, then, reason to believe that spatial dependence arises from\nprocesses related to both diffusion and exposure, such that the characteris-\ntics of surrounding neighborhoods are, at least in theory, crucial to under-\nstanding violence in any given neighborhood. The diffusion perspective\nfocuses on the consequences of crime as they are played out over time and\nspace-crime in one neighborhood may be the cause of future crime in\nanother neighborhood. The concept of exposure focuses on the antece-\ndent conditions that foster crime, which are also spatially and temporally\nordered. Although both concepts provide strong justification for analyz-\ning spatial dependence, criminological research has been surprisingly slow\nto adapt tools of spatial analysis, especially in a regression framework that\naccounts for a competing explanation of clustering-selection effects\nbased on population composition (see also Rosenfeld et a]., 1999;Smith et\nal., 2000). In this paper, we therefore focus on the independent effect of\nspatial proximity on the likelihood of homicide, accounting for key struc-\ntural and social characteristics of life within the boundaries of focal\nneighborhoods.\nOur second major goal is to integrate the study of neighborhood mecha-\nnisms identified by Mayer and Jencks (1989) with regard to informal and\ninstitutional social processes. Neighborhood-level social processes are not\neasy to study, of course, because the sociodemographic characteristics\ndrawn from census data and other government statistics typically do not\nprovide information on the collective properties of administrative units.\nBuilding on some of the pioneering efforts at direct measurement of social\nstudies have thus turned to original survey-based approaches to assess\nneighborhood-level social ties and associations. For example, Taylor et al.\n(1984:316) constructed block-level measures of the proportion of respon-\ndents in 63 Baltimore neighborhoods who belonged to an organization to\nwhich coresidents also belonged, and the proportion of respondents who\nfelt responsible for what happened in the area surrounding their home.\nBoth measures were significantly and negatively related to rates of vio-\nlence, exclusive of other ecological factors (p. 320). A similar pattern\nemerged in Simcha-Fagan and Schwartz's (1986) study of 553 residents of\n12 neighborhoods in New York City during the mid-1980s. They found a\nsignificant negative relationship between the rate of self-reported delin-\nquency and the rates of organizational participation by local residents (p.\nDrawing on data collected from more than 300 communities in Great\nsity of local friendship networks was associated with lower robbery rates,\nwhereas the level of organizational participation by residents was linked to\nlower rates of robbery and stranger violence (p. 789). The prevalence of\nunsupervised teenage peer-groups in a community had the largest associa-\ntions with rates of robbery and violence by strangers. Variations in these\ndimensions of community social organization were shown to mediate, in\npart, the effects of community socioeconomic status, residential mobility,\nethnic heterogeneity, and family disruption. In a similar study from the\nUnited States, Elliott et al. (1996) examined survey data from Chicago and\nDenver. A measure of \"informal control\" was negatively related to ado-\nlescent problem behavior in both sites, and like the British results, infor-\nmal control mediated the prior effects of neighborhood structural\ndisadvantage. Residentially unstable and poor neighborhoods displayed\nless social control, and they in turn suffered higher delinquency rates.\nA number of studies have used survey data from 5,302 Seattle residents\nnested within 100census tracts (Miethe and Meier, 1994) to investigate the\nconnection between social processes and crime. Warner and Rountree\n(1997) found a significant negative association between assault rates and\nthe proportion of respondents in white neighborhoods who engaged in\nneighboring activities with one another-including borrowing tools or\nfood, having lunch or dinner, or helping each other with problems. In a\nsubsequent study, Rountree and Warner (1999) examined the gendered\nnature of neighboring and found that the proportion of females engaging\nin neighboring activities was behind the association with lower rates of\nviolent crime. Bellair (2000) approached the same data with a somewhat\ndifferent perspective on social processes. He assumed that neighboring\nactivities affect crime rates only indirectly, by increasing the likelihood\nthat neighbors will engage in informal surveillance of one another's prop-\nerty. These causal paths were consistent with the results he obtained from\na structural equation model.\ntrust/cohesion and shared expectations for social control, they found that a\nsummary measure of \"collective efficacy\" was associated with lower rates\nof violence, controlling for concentrated disadvantage, residential stability,\nimmigrant concentration, and a set of individual-level characteristics (e.g.,\nage, sex, SES, race/ethnicity, home ownership). Concentrated disadvan-\ntage and residential instability were also linked to lower collective efficacy,\nand the association of disadvantage and stability with violence was signifi-\ncantly reduced when collective efficacy was controlled. These patterns are\nconsistent with the inference that neighborhood structural characteristics\ninfluence violence in part through the construct of neighborhood collec-\ntive efficacy.*\nIn short, most neighborhood studies to date have focused on social ties\nand interaction to the exclusion of organizations (see Peterson et al.,\nlighted cohesion and mutual expectations among residents for control.\nBut as noted earlier, communities can exhibit intense private ties (e.g.,\namong friends, kin), and perhaps even shared expectations for control, yet\nstill lack the institutional capacity to achieve social control (Hunter, 1985).\nThe institutional component of social capital is the resource stock of\nneighborhood organizations and their linkages with other organizations.\nSimilar to the idea of \"bridging\" social capital, Bursik and Grasmick\n(1993a) also highlight the importance of public control, defined as the\ncapacity of community organizations to obtain extralocal resources (e.g.,\npolice protection; block grants; health services) that help sustain neighbor-\nhood stability and control. It may be that high levels of collective efficacy\ncome about because of such controls, such as a strong institutional pres-\nence and intensity of voluntary associations. Or it may be that the pres-\nence of institutions directly accounts for lower rates of crime. Only a few\nstudies have examined voluntary associations (e.g., Simcha-Fagan and\nnity's organizational base (for an exception, see Peterson et al., 2000). In\naddition to incorporating the spatial dynamics of interpersonal violence,\nstructural characteristics, and the systemic dimensions of collective effi-\ncacy and social ties, we therefore address this gap by simultaneously exam-\nining institutional density and the intensity of local voluntary associations\nas reported by residents.\nThe data on neighborhood social processes stem from the Community\nSurvey of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\n(PHDCN). The extensive social-class, racial, and ethnic diversity of the\npopulation was a major reason Chicago was selected for the study. Chi-\ncago's 865 census tracts were combined to create 343 \"Neighborhood\n2. Homicides that result from domestic disputes or spousal abuse may seem to be\nunrelated to the social processes related to collective efficacy. However, as Browning\n(2001) demonstrates, women in collectively efficacious neighborhoods are more likely\nto disclose incidents of abuse and assaultto their neighbors, protecting themselves from\nbeing victimized by further violence. Collective efficacy is also related to lower homi-\ncide rates among intimate partners. Thus, the span of collective efficacy appears to\nextend beyond street-level or public encounters (Sampson et al., 1997:918) to the case\nof partner violence \"inside the home.\"\nClusters'' (NCs) composed of geographically contiguous and socially simi-\nlar census tracts. NCs are smaller than Chicago's 77 community areas\n(average size = 40,000) but large enough to approximate local neighbor-\nhoods, averaging around 8,000 people. Major geographic boundaries (e.g.,\nrailroad tracks, parks, freeways), knowledge of Chicago's local neighbor-\nhoods, and cluster analyses of census data were used to guide the construc-\ntion of relatively homogeneous NCs with respect to distributions of racial-\nethnic mix, SES, housing density, and family structure. The Community\nresidents representing all 343 NCs were personally interviewed in their\nhomes.3 The basic design for the CS had three stages: At stage 1, city\nblocks were sampled within each NC; at stage 2, dwelling units were sam-\npled within blocks; and at stage 3, one adult resident (18 or older) was\nsampled within each selected dwelling unit. Abt Associates carried out the\nscreening and data collection in cooperation with PHDCN, achieving an\noverall response rate of 75%.\nTo assess collective efficacy, we replicated Sampson et al. (1997) and\ncombined two related scales. The first is a five-item Likert-type scale of\nshared expectations for social control. Residents were asked about the\nlikelihood that their neighbors could be counted on to take action if chil-\ndren were skipping school and hanging out on a street corner, children\nwere spray-painting graffiti on a local building, children were showing dis-\nrespect to an adult, a fight broke out in front of their house, and the fire\nstation closest to home was threatened with budget cuts. Social cohesion/\ntrust was measured by asking respondents how strongly they agreed that\n\"People around here are willing to help their neighbors\"; \"This is a close-\nknit neighborhood\"; \"People in this neighborhood can be trusted\"; \"Peo-\nple in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other\"\n(reverse coded); and \"People in this neighborhood do not share the same\nvalues\" (reverse coded). Social cohesion and informal social control were\nstrongly related across neighborhood clusters (r = 30) and, following\nSampson et al. (1997), were combined into a summary measure of the\nhigher order construct, \"collective efficacy.\" The aggregate-level or\n\"ecometric\" reliability (see Raudenbush and Sampson, 1999) of collective\n3.

It may include places you shop, religious or public\ninstitutions, or a local business district. It is the general area around your house where\nyou might perform routine tasks, such as shopping, going to the park, or visiting with\nneighbors.\"\n4.

Organizations is an index of the number of survey-\nreported organizations and programs in the neighborhood-the presence\nof a community newspaper, block group or tenant association, crime pre-\nvention program, alcohol/drug treatment program, mental health center,\nor family health service. Voluntary associations taps the \"social capital\"\ninvolvement of residents in (1) local religious organizations; (2) neighbor-\nhood watch programs; (3) block group, tenant associations, or community\ncouncil;(4) business or civicgroups; (5) ethnic or nationality clubs; and (6)\nlocal political organizations. The measure of social tiednetworks is based\non the combined average of two measures capturing the number of friends\nreported living in the neighborhood.\nUnlike the full-count census measures described below, our community\nsurvey measures of social process are based on only about 25 respondents\nper neighborhood cluster. Moreover, there are differential missing data\nby items in the scales. To account for measurement error and missing\ndata, we employ the empirical Bayes (EB) residuals of the key survey-\nbased predictors-collective efficacy, social ties, organizations, and volun-\ntary associations. EB residuals are defined as the least-squares residuals\nregressed toward zero by a factor proportional to their unreliability (Bryk\nand Raudenbush, 1992:42). Using EB residuals as explanatory variables\ncorrects for bias in regression coefficients resulting from measurement\nBased on the 1990 census and our theoretical framework, we examine\nfive neighborhood structural characteristics. All scales are based on the\nsummation of equally weighted z-scores divided by the number of items;\nfactor-weighted scales yielded the same results. Concentrated disadvan-\ntage represents economic disadvantage in racially segregated urban neigh-\nborhoods. It is defined by the percentage of families below the poverty\nline, percentage of families receiving public assistance, percentage of\nunemployed individuals in the civilian labor force, percentage of female-\nheaded families with children, and percentage of residents who are black.\nThese variables are highly interrelated and load on a single factor using\nsize (n) in each of the j neighborhoods and (2) the proportion of the total variance that\nis between-groups ( T ~ )\nrelative to the amount that is within-groups (\nd\n)\n.\nA magnitude\nof greater than .SO suggests that we are able to reliably tap parametervariance in collec-\ntive efficacy at the neighborhood level.

Even though traditional in criminology, regression models\nthat enter both percent black and disadvantage thus assume a reality\ncounter to fact. We address this race issue in two ways. First, we assess\nwhether the structural, social, and spatial processes specified in our models\nvary across regimes defined by racial composition. In other words,\nalthough we cannot reliably disentangle the direct effects of race and dis-\nadvantage, we address the possibility that racial composition interacts with\nother variables. Second, we test the robustness of main results, other than\ndisadvantage, to traditional controls for percent black.\nFocusing on the pernicious effects of concentrated disadvantage, while\nobviously important, may obscure the potential protective effects of afflu-\nent neighborhoods. After all, concentrated affluence may be more than\njust the absence of disadvantage. Recent years have seen the increasing\nseparation of affluent residents from middle-class areas (Massey, 1996), a\nphenomenon not captured by traditional measures of poverty. Moreover,\nBrooks-Gunn et al. (1993) argue that concentrated affluence generates a\nseparate set of protective mechanisms based on access to social and insti-\ntutional resources. The resources that affluent neighborhoods can mobil-\nize are theoretically relevant to understanding the activation of social\ncontrol, regardless of dense social ties and other elements of social capital\nthat may be present. In support of this notion, recent work has demon-\nstrated the importance of measuring the upper tail of the SES distribution\nwhen analyzing structural characteristics and youth outcomes (Brooks-\nintroducing a measure that captures the concentration of both poverty and\naffluence. The index of concentration at the extremes (\"ICE\") (Massey,\n2001) is defined for a given neighborhood by the following formula:\n[(number of affluent families - number of poor families) / total number of\nfamilies], where \"affluent\" is defined as families with income above\n$50,000and \"poor\" is defined as families below the poverty line. The ICE\nindex ranges from a theoretical value of -1 (which represents extreme\npoverty, namely, that all families are poor) to +1(which signals extreme\naffluence, namely, that all families are affluent). A value of zero indicates\nthat an equal share of poor and affluent families live in the neighborhood.\nICE is therefore an inequality measure that taps both ends of the income\ndistribution, or as Massey (2001:44) argues, the proportional imbalance\nbetween affluence and poverty within a neighborhood.\nOther structural covariates include the relative presence of adults per\nchild (ratio of adults 18+ to children under 18) and population density\n(number of persons per square kilometer). We also build on Sampson et\nal. (1997) by examining two additional structural characteristics long noted\nin the ecological literature. Residential stability is defined as the percent-\nage of residents five years old and older who lived in the same house five\nyears earlier, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. The\nsecond scale captures areas of concentrated Latino immigration, defined by\nthe percentage of Latino residents (in Chicago, approximately 70% of\nLatinos are Mexican-American) and percentage of persons foreign born.\nTo eliminate method-induced associations between outcomes and\npredictors, we examine two independent measures of homicide relative to\nour survey-based approach to measuring social process and our census-\nbased approach to measuring structural covariates. We analyze homicide\nas an indicator of neighborhood violence both because of its indisputable\ncentrality to debates about crime and because it is widely considered to be\nthe most accurately recorded of all crimes. Our principle data source\ncomes from reports of homicide incidents to the Chicago Police Depart-\nment. These data consist of aggregate homicide counts that have been\ngeocoded to match the neighborhood cluster in which the events occurred.\nWe use the homicide count data from two time periods, the years 1991to\nconstruct rates based on three-year counts for both periods to reduce mea-\nsurement error and stabilize rates. We replicate the main analysis on a\nat the ICPSR data archive (http:llwww.icpsr.umich.edu).Homicide data from both\ntime periods come from police counts, also compiled by Richard Block, that were\ngeocoded based on the address where the incident occurred. The homicide counts for\neach neighborhood cluster includes cases of non-negligent manslaughter but excludes\ndeaths that result from injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcing agents.\nThere is one difference between the homicide data from the two time periods. In the\nlatter period (199&1998), the homicide count for each neighborhood cluster is based\non the number of \"incidents\" that occurred there, where each incident may contain one\nperson-based measure of homicide victimization in 1996derived from vital\nstatistics rather than from police records.6 The original source here was\ndeath-record information found in the coroner's report and recorded in\nvital statistics data for Chicago, which were geocoded based on the home\naddress of the victim.' To the extent that basic patterns are similar across\nrecording systems with obviously different error structures, we can place\nincreased confidence in the results of independently measured predictors.\nNevertheless, we privilege the incident-based homicide measure from\npolice statistics as our primary outcome because our theoretical perspec-\ntive, grounded in the social control of routine activities, places its analytic\nfocus on the neighborhood factors that may suppress the occurrence of\nhomicide events within its boundaries.\nSampson et al.

By contrast, we assess the\nability of our model to predict future variations in violence. Specifically,\nMoreover, we address the potential endogeneity of collective efficacywith\nrespect to past violence by explicitly controlling for the rate of violent\nresidents' sense of control are undermined by experiences with crime,\nmost notably, interpersonal crimes of violence and those committed in\nOurs is a strict test because the strong temporal dependence in violence\ndence rates) may yield unduly conservative estimates of any of the\nor more victims. This contrasts with the 1991-1993 homicide data, in which the ncigh-\nborhood count is based on the number of victims that were murdered in each neighbor-\nhood in a given year. The two sets of measures are very highly correlated. however, and\nmultiple-victim incidents are rare.\nmeasures of homicide do not cover exactly the same time period. Homicides in the vital\nstatistics are coded as causes of death due to injuries inflicted by another person with\nintent to injure or kill, by any means. As was the case with the police statistics. these\nhomicide data include non-negligent manslaughter but exclude injuries inflicted by the\npolice or other law-enforcing agents (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000).\nA long history of research on homicide has shown that victims tend to be killed\nin or very near to their neighborhoods of residence. For homicide, then, the victimiza-\ntion rate also serves as a proxy for homicide incidence. This assumption is validated by\nthe high correlation between vital statistics and the police-recorded incidence of homi-\ncide events. The correlation between the homicide rate calculated from vital statistics\ncorrelation between homicide rates calculated on the two data sets for 1991-1993\n(which we use in the analysis as independent variables) is .86.\npredictors. This procedure also gives us some purchase on controlling for\nprior sources of crime not captured in our measured variables.8\nThere are three major features of our approach and data that must be\nrepresented in our statistical model: the conception of the outcome as a\ncount of rare events (homicides); the likely unexplained variation between\nneighborhoods in the underlying latent event rates; and the spatial embed-\ndedness of neighborhood processes. Our model views the homicide count\nY,for a given neighborhood as sampled from an overdispersed Poisson\ndistribution with mean nili,where ni is the population size in 100,000sof\nneighborhood i and l, is the latent or \"true\" homicide rate for neighbor-\nhood i per 100,000people. We view the log-event rates as normally distrib-\nuted across neighborhoods. However, we conceive of these log-event rates\nas spatially autocorrelated. More specifically,using a hierarchical genera-\nlized linear model approach (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989;Raudenbush et\nal., 2000), we set the natural log link qj = log(l,) equal to a mixed linear\nmodel that includes relevant neighborhood covariates, a random effect for\neach neighborhood, plus a spatial autocorrelation term. Thus, our model\nfor the neighborhood log homicide rate conforms to an overdispersed\nPoisson distribution.\nThe advantage of this approach is threefold. First, it sensibly incorpo-\nrates the skewed nature of the homicide outcome, which has many values\nof zero, while creating a metric that defines meaningful effect size.\nNamely, exponentiating the regression coefficient in such a model and\nmultiplying the result times 100 produces the useful interpretation of \"the\npercent increase in the homicide rate associated with a one unit increase in\nthe predictor.\" Second, the approach represents unique, unobserved dif-\nferences between neighborhoods via random effects. To the extent that\nAn alternative approach to addressing the endogeneity of collective efficacy\nwould be to examine simultaneousequation models, but in this procedure, the choice of\ninstrumental variables is often very difficult to justify (see discussion in Bellair, 2000)\nand the existing literature has been harshly criticized as untenable (Fisher and Nagin,\n1978). The problem is that the exclusionary restrictions cannot be validated with the\ndata at hand. We prefer to address endogeneity through a control for prior homicide on\ntwo grounds-no identifying restrictions are necessary, and it is a conservative test.\nThe latter is true because the very high stability in homicide rates over time results in\nlittle residual variation left in the homicide rate to explain with other covariates. Also,\nprior levels of social process, for which we have no measures, may have influenced prior\nlevels of crime and thus be mediated in their effect. However, if a significant associa-\ntion between social process and homicide maintains after partialling the effect of prior\nhomicide, endogeneity is an implausible inference in our panel model because the\nhomicide outcome is measured at a later time than the predictors; crime cannot influ-\nence the past.\nneighborhoods have unique features that affect homicide rates, these ran-\ndom effects are important in accounting for variation not explainable by\nthe structural model. Third, the approach incorporates the spatial depen-\ndence of neighborhood homicide rates.\nUnfortunately, software that can simultaneously handle overdispersed\nPoisson variates, random effects of neighborhoods, and spatial depen-\ndence is not currently available. We therefore employed a two-step\napproximation. First, we used a hierarchical generalized linear model\nwithout spatial dependence to compute posterior modes q,* of neighbor-\nhood-specific log-homicide rates given the data, the grand mean estimate\nfor Chicago, and the estimated between-neighborhood variance in the true\nlog-rates.9 Next, we imported these posterior modes into software dedi-\ncated to estimating regression models with spatial dependence (Space-\nStat). Using this integrated approach, regression coefficients and\ncoefficients of spatial dependence have the desirable interpretation of the\nideal model described above.\nWe estimate spatial dependence by constructing \"spatially lagged\" ver-\nsions of our measures of violence. We define y, as the homicide rate of NC\ni, and w,,\nas element ij of a spatial weights matrix that expresses the geo-\ngraphical proximity of NC, to NC, (Anselin, 1988:ll). For a given observa-\ntion i, a spatial lag Z,w,,y, is the weighted average of homicide in\nneighboring locations.10 The weights matrix is expressed as first-order\ncontiguity, which defines neighbors as those NCs that share a common\n9. The approximate posterior mode q,' for neighborhood i is a weighted average\nof that neighborhood's log homicide rate, estimated using only the data from that\nneighborhood; and the overall mode of the homicide rates estimated from the data\ngenerated by all of the neighborhoods. The weights accorded each component are pro-\nportional to their precisions. The more data collected in neighborhood i, the more pre-\ncise will be the estimate based on the data from that neighborhood and the more weight\nit will be accorded in composing q,'. The more concentrated the neighborhood rates\naround the overall mode, the more that overall mode will be weighted. Such approxi-\nmate posterior modes are routinely produced as output from widely used statistical\nsoftware for multilevel analysis (cf. Raudenbush et al., 2000). The shrinkage of neigh-\nborhood-specific estimates toward an overall mode is not ideal because it ignores prior\ninformation about how neighborhoods differ in their homicide rates. In principle, this\nleads to somewhat conservative estimates of the effects of neighborhood-level\ncovariates. To assess the extent of bias, we replicated our results using standard regres-\nsion analyses with the neighborhood-based rates as outcomes. Results were very simi-\nlar. We chose the approach using posterior modes because it extends better to spatial\nmodeling. The standard approach using the neighborhood-based rates as outcomes does\nnot extend well to the incorporation of spatial effects because the extreme skewness of\nthe neighborhood-specific rates contradicts the assumptions of the spatial regression\nprocedures. Using the posterior modes solves this problem and produces stable and\ninterpretable spatial results.\nSpatial dependence may also be treated as a \"nuisance,\" in the form of a spa-\ntial error model (Anselin, 1988). The spatial lag model was chosen because it conforms\nborder (referred to as the rook criterion).ll Thus, wij= 1 if i and j are\ncontiguous, 0 if not. We then test formally for the independent role of\nspatial dependence in a multivariate model by introducing the spatial lag\nas an explanatory variable. The spatial lag regression model is defined as\nwhere y is an N x 1vector of observations on the dependent variable; W\ny\nis an N x 1 vector composed of elements Iiwi,yi,the spatial lags for the\ndependent variable; p is the spatial autoregressive coefficient; X is an N x\nK matrix of exogenous explanatory variables with an associated K x 1vec-\ntor of regression coefficients/3; and E is an N x 1vector of normally distrib-\nuted random error terms, with means 0 and constant (homoscedastic)\nThe most straightforward interpretation of p is that for a given neigh-\nborhood, i, it represents the effect of a one-unit change in the average\nhomicide rate of i's first-order neighbors on the homicide rate of i. This\ninterpretation would seem to suggest a diffusion process, whereby a high\nhomicide rate in one neighborhood diffuses outward and affects homicide\nrates in surrounding neighborhoods. However, the notion of diffusion\nimplies a process that occurs over time, whereas the spatial autocorrela-\ntion process modeled in Equation (1)is entirely cross-sectional-homicide\nrates are spatially interrelated across neighborhoods but simultaneously\ndetermined. Moreover, the interpretation of p as a pure diffusion (or\nfeedback) mechanism-the effect of a one-unit change in W\ny on y-does\nnot capture the complexity of the spatial process specified in Equation (1).\nBy extending the logic of Equation (l),we can demonstrate that the spa-\ntial lag model also incorporates the idea of \"exposure\" to the values of the\nmeasured X variables and the E term (i.e., unmeasured characteristics) in\nspatially proximate neighborhoods. According to Equation (l),the value\nof y at location i depends on the values of X and E at location i and on\ny = pwy + xg + E, (1)\nto our theoretical approach that specifies spatial dependence as a substantive phenome-\nnon rather than as a nuisance (see also Tolnay et al., 1996). Moreover, the spatial lag\nmodels generally outperformed the corresponding spatial error models in a variety of\ndiagnostic tests.\n11. Before computing the spatial lag term, we standardized the weights matrix by\ndividing each element in a given row by the corresponding row sum (see Anselin,\n1995a). Defined formally as w@, wij,row standardization constrains the range of the\nparameter space in such a way that the resulting coefficient is no longer dependent on\nthe scale of the distance employed in the weights matrix. The spatial lag parameter can\nbe interpreted as the estimated effect of a one-unit change in the scale of the original\nvariable from which it was created.\n12. This model is often referred to as the simultaneous spatial autoregressive\nmodel because the presence of the spatial lag is similar to the inclusion of endogenous\nexplanatory variables in systems of simultaneous equations. All estimates of the spatial\nproximity models were derived using the program \"Spacestat\" (Anselin, 1995a).\nvalues of y in i's first-order neighbors. In turn, the first-order neighbors'\nvalues of y are functions of X and E in i's first-order neighbors and y in i's\nsecond-order neighbors, and so on. This process continues in a step-like\nfashion, incorporating the neighborhood characteristics of successively\nhigher order neighbors of i (see also Tolnay et al., 1996). This process can\nbe expressed mathematically by rewriting Equation (1) as follows:\ny = xp + pwxp + p W x p +...+pnlWmxp+ E\n+ PWE + p2w&+...+\nP\"W\"E, (\n)\nwhere m +DJ.\nEquation (2) is also known as the \"spatial multiplier\" pro-\ncess, because it shows that the spatial regression model treats spatial\ndependence as a ripple effect, through which a change in X or E at location\ni influences not only the value of y at location i, but also (indirectly) at all\nother locations in Chicago.\nEquation (2) also shows that the spatial effect can be decomposed into\ntwo parts: the effect of proximity to the measured X variables and the\neffect of proximity to unmeasured characteristics, E. The first component\n(the spatial process in the X variables) directly addresses the \"proximity\nhypothesis\" discussed above-it estimates the extent to which homicide\nrates are related to values of the measured X variables in spatially proxi-\nmate neighborhoods.13 The second component of Equation (2) (the spa-\ntial process in E ) is more ambiguous and depends on the model\nspecification. In part, this component taps the effect of spatial proximity\nto unmeasured features in nearby neighborhoods that are associated with\nhomicide. For example, the homicide rate of the focal neighborhood may\nbe related to rates in surrounding areas because of overlapping social net-\nworks across arbitrary neighborhood boundaries. Another possibility is a\nspillover effect such that the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood is\naffected by the homicide rate in nearby neighborhoods directly. Therefore,\nthe p coefficient from the spatial lag model captures spatial exposure to\nthe observed X variables, spatial exposure to unobserved predictors, and\nendogenous feedback effects in y.\nWe begin our analysis by examining the geographic distributions of\nhomicide and collective efficacy across Chicago neighborhoods in an\nexploratory spatial data analysis (Anselin, 1988). Consistent with much\n13. Because p is multiplied by the B coefficient for each X variable in Equation (2),\nand 0 5 p 5 1. it is possible to think of p as the rate at which the effects of each X\nvariable are \"discounted\" in contiguous neighbors. Thus, if p = .50, the effects of the\naverage level of X in the first-order neighbors (Wx)will be half as strong as they are in\nthe focal neighborhood. In the second-order neighbors, the effect will be reduced by\none-quarter the size of p (SO2 = .25), and so on for each successive order of contiguity.\npast research, homicide events are not randomly distributed with respect\nto geography. In fact, supplementary tabulations reveal that 70% of all\nneighborhood clusters, according to the Police data. We thus examined\nthe geographic correspondence between the distribution of neighborhood\nhomicide rates and that of collective efficacy,a key social process from our\ntheoretical perspective. To facilitate such a comparison, we employ a\ntypology of spatial association, referred to as a Moran scatterplot, which\nclassifieseach neighborhood based on its value for a given variable, y , and\nthe weighted average of y in contiguous neighborhoods, as captured by the\nspatial lag term, Wy. For simplicity, neighborhoods that are above the\nmean on y are considered to have \"high\" values of y , whereas neighbor-\nhoods below the mean are classified as \"low.\" The same distinction is\nmade with respect to values of Wy for each neighborhood, resulting in a\nfourfold classification with the followingcategories: (1) low-low,for neigh-\nborhoods that have low levels of efficacy and are also proximate to neigh-\nborhoods with low levels of efficacy; (2) low-high, for neighborhoods that\nhave low levels of efficacy but are proximate to high levels; (3) high-low,\nfor neighborhoods that have high levels of efficacy but are proximate to\nlow levels; and (4) high-high, for areas with high levels of efficacy that are\nalso proximate to high levels of efficacy.\nFigure 1 displays the results of the spatial typology for two variables:\nthe incident-based Police data. This map conveys two pieces of informa-\ntion for each neighborhood. First, each neighborhood's value for the spa-\ntial typology of collective efficacy is denoted by a different fill pattern:\nlight gray for low-low;dots for low-high;diagonal stripes for high-low; and\ndark gray for high-high.14 Second, the symbols on the map represent val-\nues of the spatial typology of EB homicide rates, constructed from the\nIt is possible to apply a test of statistical significance for the values of this\ntypology, developed by Anselin (1995b). This test of local spatial association at each\nlocation i is referred to as the local Moran statistic, defined as I,= (z,I rn2)Z,w,,z,with mz\n= Z,z?, where the observations z, and z, are standardized values of y ,and y, expressed as\ndeviations from the mean (Anselin, 1995a, 1995b). Under a conditional randomization\napproach, the value of z, at location i is held fixed, and the remaining values of z, over\nall other neighborhoods in the city are randomly permuted in an iterative fashion. With\neach permutation, a new value of the quantity E,w,,z, is computed, and the statistic is\nrecalculated. This permutation operationalizes the null hypothesis of complete spatial\nrandomness. A test for pseudo-significance is then constructed by comparing the origi-\nnal value of I, to the empirical distribution that results from the permutation process\n(Anselin, 1995b). We could not convey the information about statistical significance of\nthe Moran typology for collective efficacy with the limited shading scheme of a black-\nand-white map-such a map entails an eightfold categorization, which is better dis-\nplayed in color. However, the symbols on the map representing homicide hot spots\n(stars) and cold spots (crosses) are based on only the statistically significant \"high-high''\nh\nbD\na\n.\nh\nd\n(i.e., homicide \"hot spots\"), and gray crosses indicate significant low-low\nvalues (i.e., homicide \"cold spots\").\nWe draw two general conclusions from Figure 1. First, the map shows\nthat there is a high degree of overlap between the spatial distributions of\ncollective efficacy and homicide. For example, 67 of the 93 neighborhoods\nthat have spatial clustering of high levels of collective efficacy (72%) also\nexperience statistically significant clustering of low homicide. Most of the\nclustering of low homicide coupled with high collective efficacy occurs in\nneighborhoods located on the western boundaries of Chicago, particularly\non the far northwest and southwest sides. Similarly, there is a strong cor-\nrespondence between the spatial clustering of high homicide rates and the\nlow levels of collective efficacy. Of the 103 homicide hot spots, 77 (or\n75%) also have spatial clustering of low levels of collective efficacy. Sec-\nond, despite the strong association between the geographic distribution of\ncollective efficacy and homicide, there are many observations in which the\ntwo typologies are at variance with one another. For example, 14 of the 93\nhomicide cold spots (15%) appear in neighborhoods with low levels of\ncollective efficacy that are surrounded by high levels. Moreover, 15of 103\nhomicide hot spots (15%) are in neighborhoods that have high levels of\ncollective efficacy but are surrounded by neighborhoods with low levels.\nNeighborhoods where the level of collective efficacy is at variance with\nsurrounding neighborhoods are important theoretically because they\nreveal concrete but often neglected forms of spatial advantage and disad-\nThe role of spatial proximity to collective efficacy is further explored in\nFigure 2, which graphs the mean homicide rate for the four categories of\nthe collective efficacy spatial typology.15 Figure 2 reveals that regardless\nof the level of collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood, mean homi-\ncide rates are lower among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to\nhigh levels of collective efficacy (as indicated by the dark gray bars) than\nthey are among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to low levels\nof collective efficacy (as indicated by the dotted bars). It is therefore clear\nthat a neighborhood's spatial proximity to collective efficacy conditions its\nhomicide rate, independent of its level of collective efficacy.

Moreover, we have\nposted a color map on our website, http://phdcn.harvard.edu/res-pubs/maproom/index.\nhtml, which displays information regarding statistical significance for the clustering of\ncollective efficacy using the local Moran statistic.\nThis graph does not take into account statistical significance of Moran's I,\nbecause very few neighborhoods are in either the low-high or high low categories and\nhave statistically significantvalues of Moran's I (only 6 in low-high and 11 in high-low).\nThese cell sizes are too small to generate reliable estimates of mean homicide rates.\nFigure 2 Mean Homicide Rate by Level and Spatial\nProximity to Collective Efficacy\nwords, knowing the local level of social organization is not enough, a pro-\nposition we now test further in a multivariate spatial analysis of homicide\nrates with additional covariates.\nWe turn to a regression framework to investigate three substantive\nissues in the analysis of neighborhood homicide rates-the role of multiple\nsocial processes as neighborhood mechanisms, the spatial dynamics of\nhomicide, and the endogeneity of collective efficacy. The Appendix\nincludes a correlation matrix for all of the independent variables included\nin subsequent regression models along with a table displaying their means\nand standard deviations. Table 1presents the results of regression models\nfor EB homicide rates using the Chicago Police Data. The first model\nincludes only the structural covariates. The natural log of the concen-\ntrated disadvantage index is used because scatterplots revealed a non-\nlinear relationship between disadvantage and homicide. The log-\ntransformation effectively linearizes this association.16 The results show\nthat all of the coefficients in this model are significant, with the exception\n16. Before taking its natural log, we added a constant (1.5) to the disadvantage\nscale to eliminate negative values.\nTable 1.

When social and institutional processes\nare added to the regression, in model 2, only the effects of disadvantage\n(positive), residential stability (positive), and density (negative) remain\nsignificant.17 More importantly, model 2 also reveals that collective effi-\ncacy is negatively related to homicide rates, as anticipated by the theoreti-\ncal discussion. Somewhat unexpectedly, none of the other social or\n17. The negative association between population density and homicide may go\nagainst conventional wisdom that it should be positive. The expectation of a positive\nassociation is probably more applicable to the city level (i.e., more densely populated\ninstitutional process variables in model 2 are significantly related to\nhomicide.\nModels 3 and 4 represent spatial lag regressions estimated via maximum\nlikelihood. Model 3 introduces the spatial lag term, which is positively\nrelated to homicide rates and strongly significant. The introduction of the\nspatial lag term in model 3 eliminates the significance of residential stabil-\nity and diminishes the effects of concentrated disadvantage (by 30%), pop-\nulation density (by 20%), and collective efficacy (by 16.5%). Model 4\norder to address the possibility that the association between collective effi-\ndownward spiral of neighborhoods caused by prior violence.18 The con-\ntrol for prior homicide reduces the magnitude of the collective efficacy\ncoefficient (by 13%), but it still maintains significance. The control for\nprior homicide reduces the disadvantage coefficient more substantially (by\nindex are so highly correlated (r = .90), it is difficult to disentangle their\nthe standpoint of our theoretical discussion above is that collective efficacy\nand the spatial term maintain significant and strong associations with vari-\nations in future homicide unaccounted for by the stable patterns of vio-\nlence as reflected in prior homicide.\nThe remaining models in Table 1, models 5 and 6, offer an alternative\nspecification of the spatial autocorrelation model with and without the\ncontrol for prior homicide. What is unique about models 5 and 6 is the\ncities may indeed have higher homicide rates), but it is less applicable to the neighbor-\nhood level because many of the most devastated and poor areas within cities of the\nNorth and Midwest are those that became \"depopulated\" during the social dislocations\nexample, resemble virtual ghost towns yet continue to have high rates of violent crime.\nWe examined this relationship more closely by mapping the concentrationsof both den-\nsity and homicide. The maps revealed that the association between high neighborhood\ndensity and low homicide rates appears to be strongest in affluent neighborhoods on\nthe city's North Side, where there are many high-rise apartment buildings. To be sure,\nthere are also neighborhoods with high density and high homicide rates-such as those\nwith high-rise public housing-but it is more generally the case that the neighborhoods\nwith the highest homicide rates (e.g., on the West and South Sides) have relatively low\nlevels of population density. This finding dovetails with results from prior longitudinal\nresearch in Chicago on the association between neighborhood population loss-which\ntends to result in lower levels of population density-and higher homicide rates (More-\nnoff and Sampson, 1997). Our results also suggest that the density effect does not\nappear to operate through collective efficacy, because density is strongly negatively\nrelated to collective efficacy, as shown below in Table 4 .\n18. These prior homicide rates are also based on the overdispersed Poisson distri-\nbution, using the same methodology described above.\nsubstitution of the ICE index for the disadvantage index. The ICE index\ncaptures the degree of concentrated affluence relative to the concentration\nof poverty in a neighborhood (Massey, 2001). The coefficients for collec-\ntive efficacy remain statistically significant in models 5 and 6 after control-\nling for prior homicide. Significant spatial dependence also remains in\neach of the models. Thus, even though they are conceptually distinct, sub-\nstituting ICE for the disadvantage index does not alter the main findings.19\nThe larger message appears to be that concentrated inequality in socioeco-\nnomic resources is directly related to homicide.\nTo assess robustness, Table 2 replicates the same set of models using\nvictim-based homicide rates for 1996 from the Chicago Vital Statistics\ndata. The results are similar to those from Table 1for the variables of\nmain theoretical interest: concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy,\nspatial proximity, and the ICE index. In model 1,concentrated disadvan-\ntage is the only structural variable that has a statistical association with\nhomicide. Unlike the results for the incident-based homicide measure,\ndensity does not have a direct relationship with victim-based homicide.\nThis makes sense from a routine activities perspective, because it is a fac-\ntor that is theoretically related to the point of the event's occurrence, not\nto the residence of the victim.\nWhen the social process variables are added in model 2, we again find a\nsignificant association between homicide rates and collective efficacy, but\nnot for social ties or any of the institutional measures. The spatial lag\nterm, introduced in model 3, is significant and positively related to homi-\ncide rates. The control for prior homicide is not significant in model 4,*0\nbut the coefficients for disadvantage, collective efficacy,and spatial depen-\ndence maintain their significance. The effects associated with collective\nefficacy and spatial dependence also remain significant after the substitu-\ntion of the ICE index for the disadvantage index in models 5 and 6.\nIn sum, we find a fairly robust set of results across two independently\ncollected sources of homicide data: the Chicago Police Statistics and Chi-\ncago Vital Statistics. Concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy, and\nthe ICE index are consistently related to homicide across all models in\nboth Tables 1 and 2. These results obtain even after controlling for prior\n19. The effect of concentrated immigration becomes significant with the substitu-\ntion of the ICE measure for the logged disadvantage scale. This change across model\nspecifications is due in part to the fact that concentrated immigration is more highly\ncorrelated with the logged disadvantagescale (-.33) than it is with ICE (-.03), as shown\nin the Appendix.\nAgain, prior homicide is strongly correlated with the logged disadvantage\nindex (.YO), as shown in the Appendix. Consequently, as was the case in Table 1,we\ncannot easily disentangle the independent effects of prior homicide and disadvantage\nTable 2.

Strong spatial effects are also evident in both data sets,\nwhich again remain after controlling for the strong stability in homicide\nrisk over time. We believe this finding is important, for one of the biggest\nproblems in spatially based social research is ensuring that p is not spuri-\nous due to a failure to fully specify the causal processes in a focal commu-\nnity. The strength of our model is that the temporally lagged homicide\nrate essentially serves as a proxy for all such unmeasured variables. Thus,\nto the extent that prior homicide adjusts for the unobserved heterogeneity\nof causal processes, the continued strength of the p coefficient increases\nour confidence in the robustness of the effect of spatial proximity on\nhomicide.\nTo interpret the results of the spatial lag models in Tables 2 and 3, it is\nimportant to recall that in Equation (2), homicide is related to the value of\neach X variable in successively higher order neighbors by a function of p,\nthe coefficient for the spatial lag term. In Figure 3,we use the results from\nmodel 4 in Tables 1 and 2 to demonstrate how this \"spatial multiplier\"\nprocess works with respect to two key covariates: concentrated disadvan-\ntage (which is logged) and collective efficacy.21 The bars on the left side of\nthe graph illustrate how the spatial multiplier process operates for concen-\ntrated disadvantage. The first set of bars in this series show that control-\nling for all other covariates in model 4, a one standard deviation increase\nin the log of the disadvantage index in the focal neighborhood is associated\nwith a 40% increase in the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood\naccording to the Police data and a 24% increase according to the Vital\nStatistics.22 The next set of bars reveals that all else being equal, a one\nstandard deviation increase in the average level of concentrated disadvan-\ntage in the first-order neighbors of the focal neighborhood is associated\nwith a 9% increase in the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood accord-\ning to the Police data and a 4% increase according to Vital Statistics. The\nremaining bars show that the effects of disadvantage decrease exponen-\ntially with each succeeding level of contiguity. To gauge the cumulative\neffect, it is possible to add all of the bars in this series for each data set.\nThis shows that a simultaneous one standard increase in the log of the\ndisadvantage index in the focal neighborhood, and in the first-, second-,\nand third-order neighbors, is associated with a 52% increase in homicide\naccording to Police data and a 28% increase according to the Vital\nStatistics.\nThe right side of Figure 3 displays results for the same exercise con-\nducted on collective efficacy. The coefficients for collective efficacy are\nmore stable across the two data sets. A one-standard deviation increase in\n21. In order to obtain the percentage change in the homicide rate per standard\ndeviation change in the corresponding independent variable, we exponentiate the prod-\nuct of each regression coefficient and the standarddeviation of the respective covariate.\n22. Because the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and the homicide\nrate is nonlinear, the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in disadvantage\ndepends on where in the distributionof disadvantage that change is evaluated. Figure 3\ndisplays the difference in the homicide rate associated with moving from one-half of a\nstandard deviation below the mean of disadvantage to one-half of a standarddeviation\nabove the mean of disadvantage.\nFigure 3 Percent Change in Homicide Rate per Standard\nDeviation Change in Concentrated Disadvantage and\nCollective Efficacy by Spatial Proximity to\nFocal Neighborhood\nCanccnlrded Vanccnlrated Concentrated Concentrated Collecllre Collecrlvc Collrcllvc Cullrcllvr\nD#.advamage\nin Dis.dvanruge 8n Di\\advantagem D!udvanlrgr rn Efflcacy m EWcacy tn Efficacy ~n Efficacy in\nFocal I.r-Order 2nd-Order 3rd-Order F a a l l+Urdcr 2nd-Order 3rd-Order\nVeiphborhod Neighbors Neighbors Nrighbon Neighborhod Yeiyhbon heiyhborr Noghbon\nIEvaluzIed dt IEvrlutedi\nt (Evaluatedat IEvaluated a!\nGrand M a n ) (;rand Mean) Grand Meanl Grand Meanl\nthe level of collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood is associated with\na 12% reduction in the homicide rate according to both the Police data\nand the Vital Statistics data.

Thus, the effects displayed in\nFigure 3 are only a fraction of the full spatial effect. What these results\nshow, however, is that the cumulative effects associated with both disad-\nvantage and collective efficacy are substantively large, particularly when\ntheir spatial dynamics are taken into account.\nTo this point, our analysis has relied on an index of concentrated disad-\nvantage that includes racial composition as one of its components. As we\nargued above, the high degree of racial segregation overlaid with poverty\nhinders our ability to disentangle the direct effects of neighborhood racial\ncomposition and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage in Chicago.23\nHowever, it is possible, and we would argue more meaningful, to examine\nwhether the social and structural processes under study operate similarly\nacross neighborhoods of differing racial composition. We address this\nissue by estimating spatial regime models (Anselin, 1995a), which allow\ncoefficients to vary across regimes defined by neighborhood racial compo-\nsition while controlling for spatial dependence.24 To define these regimes,\nwe divide Chicago's neighborhoods into two categories based on their\n1990racial composition: (1)less than 75% non-Hispanic black (henceforth\nreferred to as \"non-black\" neighborhoods) and (2) 75% or more non-His-\npanic black (henceforth, referred to as \"black\" neighborhoods). There are\n125 black neighborhoods, as defined by this typology, and they are, on\nblack neighborhoods, which on average are 54.3% white, 30.5% Hispanic,\nThe results of the regime model are reported in Table 3. We use ICE as\nour inequality measure in these models because the disadvantage index\ncontains the percent black measure, which cannot be used both on the\nright-hand side of the regressions and in the definition of the regimes.\nTheoretically, we are interested in the proportional distribution of afflu-\nence and poverty within racial regimes. The first two columns display\nresults using the incident-based homicide outcome-column 1 contains\n23. We did attempt to reestimate the models in Tables 1and 2 by recalculating the\ndisadvantage index without percent black and instead entering percent black as a sepa-\nrate covariate. Our major substantive results remained intact with this alternative spec-\nification. However, the Variance Inflation Figures increased dramatically-to over 5 in\nsome cases for the percent black variable-indicating severe problems with mul-\nticolinearity. Nevertheless, the pattern of results for the other factors in the model was\nsimilar (results available upon request), especially for spatial proximity and collective\nefficacy.\n24. The spatial regime model is a switching regression model in which the coeffi-\ncients and constant term take on different values depending on the regime, and the\ncoefficients of each regime are jointly estimated. The model also includes a spatial lag\nterm that does not vary across regimes, meaning that the spatial process is assumed to\nbe uniform across the entire city.\n25. Although we specify only two regimes, we recognize that the \"non-black\"cate-\ngory encompasses a heterogeneous grouping of neighborhoods that may be predomi-\nnantly white, predominantly Hispanic, or mixed. It is possible to expand the regime\nspecification to more than two regimes, but further disaggregation of the non-black\nregime would result in very small sample sizes-there are only 69 neighborhood clus-\nthus present the more parsimonious two-regime specification and leave for future\nresearch the question of what explains differences across these two regimes. Our main\ninterest here is the replicability of results in all black areas.\nTable 3. Coefficients from the Regression of Empirical\nBayes Poisson Homicide Rates on Neighborhood Predictors\nand 1990 Census (Standard Errors in Parentheses)\nIncident-Based Victim-Based\n'Adults per child multiplied by 100.\nthe coefficients for the non-black neighborhoods, and column 2 contains\ncoefficients for the black neighborhoods. In general, the results do not\ndiffer very much across regimes in the incident-based homicide model.26\nThe ICE index and collective efficacy have significant negative associa-\ntions with the homicide incident rate in both non-black and black neigh-\nborhoods. The spatial effect, which is estimated jointly across non-black\n26. Both the overall Chow test for the structural stability of the regression model\nacross the two regimes and the coefficient-specific Chow tests for stability across\nregimes reveal that there are no significant differences across regimes. This suggests\nthat for incident-based homicide, the regression models for black and non-black neigh-\nborhoods are not significantly different.\nand black neighborhoods, is also significant and large. The main differ-\nence is that population density has a significant negative effect only in\nnon-black neighborhoods.\nTurning to the victim-based homicide measure (columns 3 and 4), the\nresults yield more differences across the two regimes.27 In the victim-\nbased homicide model, the ICE index is significantly associated with homi-\ncide only in non-black neighborhoods, whereas the association between\ncollective efficacy and homicide is significantonly in black neighborhoods.\nMoreover, in black neighborhoods, the measures of voluntary associations\nand organizations are positively associated with homicide, whereas in non-\nblack neighborhoods, these associations are nonsignificant.28 Again, the\nspatial effect is significant. Although there is evidence of differing magni-\ntudes of effect across black and non-black neighborhoods, the overall\nresults for collective efficacy and spatial proximity are fairly robust, taking\nboth homicide outcomes into account.\nAlthough the regression results affirm that collective efficacy in achiev-\ning social control is an important factor for understanding variation in\nneighborhood homicide rates, they are less sanguine about the role of\nsocial ties. Both Tables 1and 2 show that there is no independent associa-\ntion between social ties and neighborhood homicide rates after controlling\nfor collective efficacy. These findings offer insight on the social disorgani-\nzation tradition of recent neighborhood research, much of which focuses\non the role of social ties. To bring these findings into sharper relief, and\npossible reconciliation, we constructed a social-process typology that clas-\nsifies neighborhoods based on whether they fall above or below the\nmedian score on the indices of social ties and collective efficacy, yielding\n27. In this model, the Chow test for the structural stability of the regression model\nacross regimes indicates that there are significant differences in the patterns of associa-\ntion across black and non-black neighborhoods. Coefficient-specific Chow tests indi-\ncate that the collective efficacy effect is the only one that significantly varies across\nregimes (p = .Ol), although the Chow tests for ICE (p = .08),concentrated immigration\n(p = .09), and organizations (p = .08) are all marginally significant.\n28. These findings are somewhat counterintuitive because they suggest that black\nneighborhoods with more organizational infrastructure have higher homicide rates.\nOne interpretation is that the presence of organizations and voluntary associations in\nblack neighborhoods could be in part a response to high levels of crime, or perhaps the\ngreater salience of crime. However, these associations remain when controlling for\nprior levels of homicide. We believe that these findings should be further investigated\nin future research that includes better measures of neighborhood organizations (see\nbelow).\nthe following four categories: low ties-low efficacy; low ties-high effi-\ncacy; high ties-low efficacy; high ties-high efficacy.\nWe map this typology in Figure 4 and overlay on it symbols indicating\nthe spatial clustering of low and high homicide rates (as was done in Fig-\nure 1). From the standpoint of the systemic perspective, we expect homi-\ncide rates to be lowest in neighborhoods that possess high levels of both\nsocial ties and collective efficacy. Indeed, 41 of the 93 homicide \"cold\"\nspots (44%) displayed on this map are located in areas that are high in\nboth ties and efficacy (filled in dark gray). However, 31 of the cold spots\n(36%) are located in neighborhoods that are low in ties but high in collec-\ntive efficacy (filled in diagonal stripes). Most of the neighborhoods where\nlow homicide rates are clustered despite the absence of strong social ties\nare on the north side of the city. The traditional perspective on social\ndisorganization predicts that homicide \"hot\" spots should be found\npredominantly in neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy.\nInstead, the map shows that hot spots are divided almost evenly between\nneighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy (40 out of 103) and\nthose that are high in ties and low in efficacy (38 out of 103). Dense net-\nworks do not appear to be necessary or sufficient in explaining homicide.\nThese findings do not necessarily contradict the systemic perspective, how-\never. Integrating the collective efficacy and systemic model, we would\nsuggest that social ties create the capacity for informal social control, but it\nis the act of exercising control that is related to crime rather than the exis-\ntence of social networks per se (Bursik, 1999).\nTo investigate this idea further, we examine the role of social ties as a\npredictor of collective efficacy by estimating the spatial regression models\npresented in Table 4. The results show that the social ties index is signifi-\ncantly positively associated with collective efficacy when it is introduced in\nmodels 2-5. Moreover, the institutional variables are also important cor-\nrelates of collective efficacy in Table 4,even though they did not have\nindependent associations with homicide in Tables 1 and 2. These results\nhold up after controlling for structural covariates, spatial autocorrelation,\nprior homicide rates, and after substituting the ICE index for the disad-\nvantage index (compare columns 1-3 with 4-5).29 Overall, these findings\n29. The spatial autocorrelation term for collective efficacy becomes nonsignificant\nafter the social interactional and institutional process variables are added in models 2\nand 3. One interpretation of this finding is that the spatial dependence term is signifi-\ncant in model 1 because it captures the effects of social ties and interactions that cut\nacross neighborhood boundaries, along with similarities across neighborhoods on unob-\nserved social and institutional process variables. When these processes are directly\nmeasured in model 2, they reduce the spatial dependence term to nonsignificance.\nHowever, spatial proximity remains significant for collective efficacy in the ICE models\n(columns 4 and 5),so this interpretation is contingent on the specification of inequality.\nTable 4.

Although\nusing somewhat different measures and terminology, Bellair (2000) also\nreaches a similar conclusion, suggesting a general process.\nOur results suggest that spatial embeddedness, internal structural char-\nacteristics, and social organizational processes are each important for\nFurther understanding of the spatial dynamics of collective efficacy is beyond the scope\nof this paper, but it is an issue that we believe bears emphasis.\nunderstanding neighborhood-level variations in rates of violence. In par-\nticular, spatial proximity to violence, collective efficacy, and alternative\nmeasures of neighborhood inequality-indices of concentrated disadvan-\ntage and concentrated extremes-emerged as the most consistent\npredictors of variations in homicide across a wide range of tests and empir-\nical specifications. The final and major test of these four predictors, where\ntwo independently measured indicators of homicide (police records and\ncoroner's report) are analyzed in conjunction with a three-year average\nrate of prior homicide controlled (model 4 in Tables 1 and 2), bears out\nthis conclusion. Interestingly, extreme inequality in resources-whether\nmeasured by \"underclass\" disadvantage or the concentration of income at\nboth the upper and lower tails of the distribution (ICE)-exhibits\nunmediated effects on violence despite the control for prior homicide.\nThe estimated direct effects of inequality and collective efficacy suggests\nthat structure and process at the neighborhood level may work more inde-\npendently than prior neighborhood theory has allowed (e.g., Sampson et\nMoreover, our analysis of racial \"spatial regimes\" suggested that struc-\ntural characteristics and social processes have many similar effects on\nhomicide rates in predominantly black compared with non-black neigh-\nborhoods. Although we did find some evidence of differences in coeffi-\ncients across regimes-and it is noteworthy that the effect of collective\nefficacy is strongest in black neighborhoods-overall the results suggest\nthat a fairly stable causal process is operating in all parts of the city. Put\ndifferently, the evidence is more favorable than not to the idea that the\nfundamental causes of neighborhood violence are similar across race (see\nAgainst the backdrop of these patterns, we believe four points should\nbe emphasized, each of which carries implications for future research.\nFirst, a great deal remains to be learned about the relationship between\nsocial ties and crime. Future research may better understand the indirect\nrelationship between social ties and crime by investigating the conditions\nunder which strong social ties foster trust and social control.30 In his\nsuggests that the communitarian approach, which relies on dense networks\namong residents to build communal solidarity, is not the only strategy for\nachieving social control. An alternative approach that is more common in\nthe suburbs, which Hope calls \"moral minimalism,\" achieves social control\nthrough weak ties among neighbors by emphasizing privacy over commu-\nnalism and denying strangers access to the community and its resources.\nThe achievement of social control in neighborhoods that lack a social\n30. We thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point.\ninfrastructure of strong ties among neighbors presents a challenge to sys-\ntemic theory that should be taken up in future research, both quantitative\nand ethnographic.\nThe second major theme of our analysis is that homicide is a spatially\ndependent process, and that our estimates of spatial effects are relatively\nlarge in magnitude. Indeed, the spatial effects were larger than the stan-\ndard structural covariates and an array of neighborhood social processes.\nThe tendency of past research has been to focus on internal neighborhood\nfactors, but they are clearly not enough to understand homicide. Local\nactions and population composition make a difference, to be sure, but they\nare severely constrained by the spatial context of adjacent neighborhoods.\nOur results suggest that political economy theorists are right in insisting on\nmodels that incorporate city-wide dynamics (Logan and Molotch, 1987).\nHope (199524) makes a similar point from the criminological perspective,\nsuggesting that many intervention efforts have failed because they did not\nadequately address the pressures toward crime in the community that\nderive from forces external to the community in the wider social structure.\nAlthough very different in research style and method, the recent ethno-\ngraphic work of Pattillo-McCoy (1999) also parallels our findings and dis-\ncovery of the salience of spatial vulnerability, especially for black middle-\nclass neighborhoods (Figure 1). The puzzle that remains is to further dis-\nentangle spatial processes into constituent parts. At this juncture, we are\nunable to pinpoint the relative contributions of exposure and diffusion, an\nagenda we are hopeful that criminological researchers and methodologists\nwill have an interest in tackling. In the meantime, spatial proximity cannot\nbe ignored in theories of violence.\nA third theme that emerges is the potential importance of further refin-\ning our understanding of \"structural covariates\" that have traditionally\nbeen linked to the poverty paradigm. Concentrated poverty is without any\ndoubt a risk factor for the concentration of homicide. But at the other end\nseparation of educated and affluent residents from the middle class. This\n\"upper\" inequality or stratification of place has resulted in an increasing\nimportant consequences for the distribution of homicide. Our analysis\nintroduced a new measure tapping such inequality of affluence relative to\npoverty, with results suggesting that it does matter for the explanation of\nviolence. We controlled for organizations, voluntary associations, social\ncontrol, and local ties, none of which accounted for the strong and consis-\ntent effect of the index of concentrated extremes. It may well be that the\nprotective factor of relative affluence is linked to socialization or guardian-\nship processes that are untapped in current data. Also, perhaps because of\nthe investment potential in affluent areas, homicide does not lead to the\nsame cycle of decline that seems to be obtained in disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods. We hope that future investigators probe the phenomenon of\nconcentrated affluence in more depth, especially its interaction with racial\nsegregation.\nFourth, one of our goals was to integrate the institutional and informal\naspects of social process, following recent developments in systemic social\ndisorganization,social capital, and collective efficacy theory. Somewhat to\nour surprise, however, the set of institutional processes was not that strong\nin predicting homicide. Organizations and voluntary associations turned\nout to be relatively unimportant, suggesting that perhaps criminological\ntheory has overstated the benefits to be derived from local forms of insti-\ntutional organization. Another finding is that cohesion coupled with social\ncontrol seems to be the more proximate correlate of lower homicide rela-\ntive to dense social ties. Further specifying the systemic model of disor-\ncollective efficacy suggests that social ties are important for crime control\ninsofar as they lead to the activation of social control and mutual engage-\nment among residents (Sampson et al., 1997). Our analysis, along with\nother recent research (Bellair, 2000), supports this mediated view.\nIn conclusion, we should emphasize that perhaps the biggest limitation\nof the present analysis concerns our measures of organizations and institu-\ntions. Drawn from survey (self) reports, we are limited to residents' per-\nceptions of the organizations in the areas. Residents may be mistaken, of\ncourse, suggesting that independent data are needed on the number and\ntype of organizations,along with their geographical jurisdictions (cf. Peter-\nson et al., 2000). But probably more germane, it is not clear that the num-\nber of organizations is the key factor in social organization. Applying the\nlogic we used for ties and efficacy, it may be that the density of organiza-\ntions is important only insofar as it generates effective action on the part\nof the organizations that do exist. One can imagine a community with a\nlarge number of dispirited and isolated institutions, perhaps even in con-\nflict with one another. This is hardly a recipe for social organization, sug-\ngesting that dense institutional ties are not sufficient. We therefore hope\nthat future research is able to make advances in two ways-better objec-\ntive measures of institutional density (e.g., Peterson et al., 2000) and direct\nmeasures of the organizational networks and processes of decision making\nthat are at the heart of making institutions collectively efficacious.\nREFERENCES\nAnselin, Luc\nSpatial Econometrics:Methods and Models.
