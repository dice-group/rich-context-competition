Good concordance (area under the receiver oper-\nating characteristic curve 0.80) was found between\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview and Sched-\nule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-\nAge Children diagnoses.\nResults: The prevalence estimates of any DSM-IV disor-\norders are the most common class of disorders, followed\nbybehavior,mood,andsubstancedisorders.Althoughrela-\ntive disorder prevalence is quite stable over time, 30-day\nto 12-month prevalence ratios are higher for anxiety and\nbehavior disorders than mood or substance disorders, sug-\ngesting that the former are more chronic than the latter.\nThe 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios are generally\nlower than the 12-month to lifetime ratios, suggesting that\ndisorderpersistenceisduemoretoepisoderecurrencethan\nto chronicity.

Previous reports described the NCS-A\nsample design,8,9 measurements,10 validity of diagnostic\nassessments,11 and reported lifetime prevalence and se-\nlected sociodemographic correlates.12 This study pre-\nsents new data on 12-month and 30-day prevalence and\non persistence of disorders.

A companion article presents data on\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nAdolescents (aged 13-17 years) were interviewed between Feb-\nand school samples described elsewhere.8,9 The NCS-A house-\nhold sample included 904 adolescents (879 students in school,\n25 dropouts) from households in the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey Replication.14 The conditional adolescent response rate was\nfrom a representative sample of schools in the adult sample areas.\nThe conditional adolescent response rate was 82.6%. The house-\nhold sample, despite comparatively small size, is important be-\ncause it includes school dropouts and adolescents residing in\nareas where schools refused to participate. The nonparticipat-\ning initially selected schools (72.0%) were replaced with matched\nreplacement schools. Comparison of household sample re-\nspondents from nonparticipating schools with school sample\nrespondents from replacement schools found no evidence of\nbias in estimates of either disorder prevalence or correlates.8\nOne parent or surrogate (henceforth described as parents) of\nparticipating adolescents was asked to complete a self-\nadministered questionnaire about the adolescent's develop-\nmental history and mental health. The conditional response rates\nThis article focuses on the 10 123 adolescents in school at\nthe time of survey, the subset of 6483 adolescent-parent pairs\nwith both adolescent interviews and parent questionnaires, and\nthe additional subset of 1987 pairs with adolescent interviews\nand short-form questionnaires administered to hard-to-\nrecruit parents. Data for parent-adolescent pairs were weighted\nto adjust for differences in measured variables compared with\nincomplete pairs using methods discussed elsewhere.8,9 Writ-\nten parent informed consent and written adolescent assent were\nobtained before surveying either adolescents or parents. Each\nrespondent was given $50 for participation. The recruitment\nand consent procedures were approved by the human sub-\njects committees of both Harvard Medical School and the Uni-\nversity of Michigan. Once the survey was completed, cases were\nweighted for within-household probability of selection (house-\nhold sample) and deviation from census population sociode-\nmographic distributions, making each sample nationally rep-\nresentative on the sociodemographic variables. The samples were\nthenmergedwithsumsofweightsproportionaltorelativesample\nsizes adjusted for design effects in estimating disorder preva-\nlence. These procedures are detailed elsewhere.8,9 As docu-\nmented in previous NCS-A reports,8,9 the weighted composite\nsample sociodemographic and geographic distributions closely\napproximate census population distributions.\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nAdolescents in the NCS-A were administered the fully struc-\ntured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)\nmodified to simplify language and use examples relevant to ado-\nlescents.10 The DSM-IV and CIDI disorders assessed include\nmood disorders (major depressive disorder or dysthymia, bi-\npolar I or II disorder), anxiety disorders (panic disorder with\nor without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without panic disorder,\nsocial phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder), behav-\nior disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, opposi-\ntional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder), eating disorders\n(anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating behavior), and\nsubstance disorders (alcohol and drug abuse, alcohol and drug\ndependence with abuse). There were no other exclusionary di-\nagnoses. These disorders include all those assessed in most pre-\nvious adolescent epidemiological studies.\nAll diagnoses were made using DSM-IV distress or impair-\nment criteria and organic exclusion rules. All but 2 were made\nusing diagnostic hierarchy rules, the exceptions being oppo-\nsitional-defiant disorder with or without conduct disorder and\nsubstance abuse with or without dependence. Adolescent in-\nterviews assessed all disorders, while briefer parent question-\nnaires assessed only disorders for which parent reports have\npreviously been shown to play a large part in diagnosis: behav-\nior disorders15 and depression or dysthymia.16 Parent and ado-\nlescent reports were combined at the symptom level using an\n\"or\" rule (except in the case of attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder where only parent reports were used based on evi-\ndence of low validity of adolescent reports). Exploratory analy-\nses showed that the use of this \"or\" rule optimized concor-\ndance with diagnoses in the NCS-A clinical reappraisal study.11\nPrevalence was assessed for 3 times: lifetime, past 12 months,\nand past 30 days. Lifetime disorders were defined as present\nwhether they were or were not also present in the past 12 months\nor 30 days. Twelve-month disorders were defined as present\nwhether they were or were not also present in the past 30 days.\nDisorders with longer than a 30-day duration requirement were\ndefined as present in the past 30 days only if they had dura-\ntions meeting the minimum DSM-IV requirement. Special prob-\ning procedures shown experimentally to increase recall of life-\ntime adult disorders17 were used to address the problem of\nunderestimation of lifetime prevalence in retrospective cross-\nAn NCS-A clinical reappraisal study used licensed clini-\ncians to interview adolescent-parent pairs by telephone with\nthe Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for\nSchool-Age Children Lifetime Version.19 Diagnoses were made\nfrom combined parent-adolescent reports and, as needed, rec-\nonciliation interviews.

Most of these differences represent large proportions\nof the clinical prevalence estimates. The CIDI overdiagnosed\n4 of these 5 disorders and underdiagnosed major depression\nor dysthymia. That prevalence differences were smaller for the\nother diagnoses shows that diagnostic thresholds are gener-\nally comparable for survey and clinical diagnoses. Parent and\nadolescent reports both contributed to area under the curve when\nboth were assessed, with respective values based on adoles-\ndisorder.\nSpecial caution is needed in interpreting 2 controversial di-\nagnoses: bipolar disorder and agoraphobia without panic disor-\nder. Consistent with concerns about diagnostic reliability20 and\nclinical significance21 of bipolar II disorder, clinical reappraisal\ndata show that the CIDI has difficulty distinguishing bipolar II\ndisorder from subthreshold bipolar disorder among both adoles-\ncents11 and adults.22 Second, controversy also exists about the va-\nlidity23 andabilityoffullystructuredinterviewstodistinguishago-\nraphobia without panic disorder from specific phobia.24\nSociodemographic Variables\nThe sociodemographic variables considered here include 6 of\nthe 7 used in the earlier NCS-A report on lifetime prevalence12--\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, parents' education, family income, and\nurbanicity--in addition to region of the country, number of sib-\nlings, and birth order. Rather than consider the seventh so-\nciodemographic variable, marital status of parents, from the ear-\nlier NCS-A article on lifetime prevalence, we consider the closely\nrelated measure of number of biological parents living with the\nrespondent because we found this to be a stronger predictor of\ndisorder prevalence and persistence than marital status of par-\nents (detailed results are available on request). Taken to-\ngether, these 10 sociodemographic variables include all those\nexamined in most previous epidemiological studies of child-\nadolescent mental disorders.\nPrevalence was estimated with cross-tabulations, and persis-\ntence was estimated with 2 prevalence ratios (12-month preva-\nlence among lifetime cases; 30-day prevalence among 12-\nmonth cases). Sociodemographic correlates were examined with\nlogistic regression either in the total sample (to predict preva-\nlence) or in subsamples of respondents with lifetime disorders\n(to predict 12-month prevalence among lifetime cases) or 12-\nmonth disorders (to predict 30-day prevalence among 12-\nmonth cases). Logistic regression coefficients and their stan-\ndard errors were exponentiated to create odds ratios (ORs) with\n95% CIs. Standard errors were estimated using the Taylor se-\nries linearization method to account for sample weights and\nclustering. Significance of predictor sets was evaluated using\nWald 2 tests based on the 44 NCS-A sample strata using Tay-\nlor series coefficient variance-covariance matrices. These pro-\ncedures were implemented using the SUDAAN software sys-\ntem version 8.01 (Research Triangle Institute). Statistical\nsignificance was consistently evaluated using 2-sided tests at\nRESULTS\nAs shown in more detail elsewhere,8,9 the NCS-A sample\nis highly representative of the US population of adoles-\ncents aged 13 to 17 years on a wide range of sociodemo-\ngraphic and geographic variables.

Rank-order correlations of\nprevalence estimates across time frames are 0.91 (life-\norder has the most dramatic variation in ranking (sev-\nenth most common lifetime disorder and 14th most com-\nmon 12-month and 30-day disorder), reflecting the fact\nthat separation anxiety disorder is the only disorder con-\nsidered here that often resolves before adolescence. Anxi-\nety disorders are the most common class of disorders in\nall time frames, followed by behavior, mood, and sub-\nstance disorders.\nVariation in prevalence rankings across time frames\nmeans that disorders differ in persistence, a fact shown\nmore directly in the disorder-specific 12-month to life-\ntime and 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios, al-\nthough it needs to be noted that even these ratios assess\npersistence only indirectly given that duration of persis-\ntence varies as a function of time since onset. In the ex-\ntreme case of respondents with first onsets in the 12\nmonths before interview, 100% are considered persis-\ntent in these ratios by definition. As a result, the ratios\nhave to be interpreted as suggestive rather than defini-\nTable 2.

Oppositional-defiant\ndisorder is diagnosed with or without conduct disorder. Alcohol and drug abuse are diagnosed with or without dependence. While diagnoses of most disorders are\nbased exclusively on adolescent reports, parent reports are used to make diagnoses of major depressive disorder or dysthymia, oppositional-defiant disorder,\nconduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The first 3 of these 4 disorders were assessed in the sample that completed the full parent\nself-administered questionnaire (n = 6483), whereas attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was assessed in both the full self-administered questionnaire sample\nand in the subsample of parents who completed the short-form self-administered questionnaire (n = 8470). As a result, prevalence estimates of any mood\ndisorder, any behavior disorder, any disorder, and number of disorders are based on 6483 cases.\nbAgoraphobia is diagnosed without a history of panic disorder.\ncPanic disorder is assessed with or without agoraphobia.\ndThe percentage of respondents with the number of lifetime disorders indicated in the row who have 1 or more 12-month disorders.

Nonetheless, the 12-month to lifetime ratios have a\nwide range across disorders (from 20.9% for separation\nanxiety disorder to 90.9% for social phobia) but a nar-\nbound of this range represents nearly two-thirds of cases\nsuggests that most disorders are highly persistent dur-\ning adolescence. High persistence could be due to either\ndisorder chronicity or recurrence. To the extent that the\nformer is more important, we would expect the 30-day\nto 12-month prevalence ratios to be higher than the 12-\nmonth to lifetime prevalence ratios.

As we noted, meth-\nodological analysis of the first limitation found no evi-\ndence for bias due to school replacement.8 However, the\nfinding in previous methodological studies that nonre-\nspondents have higher rates of mental illness than re-\nspondents implies that the second limitation led preva-\nlence estimates to be conservative26 and might also have\ninfluenced estimates of persistence and correlates. The\nexclusion of non-English speakers, who compose about\n4% of the US adult population (http://factfinder2.census\n.gov/), could also be at least partially responsible for the\nfailure to find strong associations of race/ethnicity with\nprevalence of persistence.\nTwo other limitations concern measurement: (1) di-\nagnoses were based on fully structured interviews and\nparent questionnaires for a subset of diagnoses; and (2)\nlifetime diagnoses were based on retrospective recall. Con-\ncern about the first limitation is reduced by evidence of\ngood concordance with diagnoses based on blinded clini-\ncal interviews,11 although prevalence estimates of simple\nphobia and oppositional-defiant disorder are substan-\ntially higher than those in the blinded clinical reap-\npraisal interviews. The second limitation presumably led\nto underestimation of prevalence, overreporting of per-\nsistence, and possible distortion in estimates of corre-\nlates, possibly in a differential way across disorders as a\nfunction of differences in age at onset and severity.18\nDespite the largely conservative limitations of the bi-\nases with respect to estimating prevalence, NCS-A preva-\nlence estimates are at the upper end of the range of es-\ntimates in previous epidemiological studies. This likely\nreflects the survey including more disorders than other\nstudies and using special recall probes.17 It is notewor-\nthy that 2 disorders with among the highest prevalence,\nspecific phobia and oppositional-defiant disorder, were\noverestimated in the CIDI.11 Prevalence estimates are most\nsimilar to estimates in previous adolescent studies that\ndid not require special criteria for severe functional im-\npairment beyond DSM-IV distress or impairment require-\nments.27 Of note, our companion article13 reports that most\n12-month disorders in the survey do not meet criteria\nfor a diagnosis of serious emotional disturbance (ie, a\nDSM-IV disorder with a Children's Global Assessment\nScale score 50).28 Whether less severe disorders should\nbe included in future DSM editions is the subject of con-\ntroversy.29 As noted in the previous National Comorbid-\nity Survey Replication report on lifetime prevalence,12 the\nfact that most disorder-specific lifetime prevalence esti-\nmates closely approximate those of adults is consistent\nwith evidence that most adult mental disorders have first\nonsets in childhood or adolescence.25\nThe 12-month to lifetime prevalence ratios of indi-\nvidual disorders are considerably higher in adolescents\nthan among adults,25 presumably reflecting recent first\nonset. The finding that 30-day to 12-month prevalence\nratios are generally lower than 12-month to lifetime ra-\ntios is consistent with the possibility that high disorder\npersistence may be due more to episode recurrence than\nto chronicity, although differential recall could also be\ninvolved. This pattern is also consistent with the longi-\ntudinal pattern in the National Comorbidity Survey 2\npanel sample. The higher 30-day to 12-month ratios for\nanxiety and behavior disorders than mood and sub-\nstance disorders suggest that the former disorders are more\noften chronic than the latter, although differential recall\nacross disorders could also be involved. If we accept the\nratios as accurate, the finding that 30-day to 12-month\nratios exceed 50% for only 3 disorders (attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, specific phobia, and social pho-\nbia) means that most active adolescent disorders are\nasymptomatic for at least half the year. It is noteworthy\nthat the only 2 disorders with high values on both 12-\nmonth to lifetime and 30-day to 12-month prevalence ra-\ntios (specific phobia and social phobia) are both early-\nonset chronic disorders (R.C.K., S.A., E.J.C., J.G.G.,\nK.A.M., N.A.S., A.M.Z., K.R.M., and Matthew D. La-\nkoma, MPH, unpublished data, February 5, 2001, and\nextent to which methodological factors account for this\npattern.\nThe results regarding sociodemographic variables are\nlargely consistent with previous research.4,30 Several find-\nings diverge from previous research, though, and point to\npotentially valuable areas for further inquiry. For one, we\ndid not replicate the regional finding that Hispanic indi-\nviduals have higher rates of depression than non-\nHispanicwhiteindividuals,31 raisingthepossibilityofurban-\nrural, regional, or socioeconomic differences that need to\nbeexploredinmoredetailedanalyses.Inaddition,thefind-\ning that girls have a more persistent course of mood and\nanxiety disorders than boys is consistent with some32 but\nnot other33 previous studies, raising the possibility of in-\nformative specifications to explore in further analyses.\nAnother interesting deviation from previous findings\ninvolves family socioeconomic status. Our finding that\nparental socioeconomic status is inversely related to preva-\nlence, although broadly consistent with previous stud-\nies,34,35 differs in 2 important ways from earlier findings.\nFirst, previous studies largely focused on parental in-\ncome, whereas we found the strongest association with\neducation and no consistent income effect after control-\nling for education. Second, earlier studies documented\nespecially high rates of disorder in the lowest socioeco-\nnomic strata (ie, living in poverty), whereas we found\nespecially low rates at the highest socioeconomic strata\n(ie, parents graduated from college). Further analysis of\njoint education-income effects are needed to reconcile\nthese differences.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

This is\nconsistent with previous research,36 but the causal dynam-\nics are unclear. Although a genetically informative design\nwould be needed to investigate relative influences of genes\nand environment,37 further analyses of our data might be\nuseful in refining understanding of component associa-\ntions involving the presence and timing of parental mari-\ntal disruption, single parenthood, and family stressors.\nIn summary, the results reported here suggest that\nDSM-IV disorders are highly prevalent and persistent\namong US adolescents. The results also support retro-\nspective findings in adult studies that most adult disor-\nders begin in childhood or adolescence. A number of well-\nknown adult sociodemographic correlates of disorders\nare found here to exist among adolescents. A compan-\nion article documents differentiation among adolescent\ndisorders in patterns and predictors of severity (R.C.K.,\nS.A., E.J.C., J.G.G., K.A.M., N.A.S., A.M.Z., K.R.M., and\nMatthew D. Lakoma, MPH, unpublished data, February\nfindings provide a strong rationale for continuing to pri-\noritize research to understand the development of ma-\njor mental disorders during the first 2 decades of life.\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Health Care Policy\n(Drs Kessler, Petukhova, and Zaslavsky, Mr Gruber, and\nMs Sampson) and Division of General Pediatrics, Chil-\ndren's Hospital Boston (Dr McLaughlin), Harvard Medi-\ncal School, School of Education, Boston University\n(Dr Green), and Office of the Provost, Harvard Univer-\nsity (Dr Koretz), Boston, Massachusetts; Divisions of De-\nvelopmental Translational Research (Dr Avenevoli) and\nIntramural Research Programs (Ms He and Dr Merikan-\ngas), National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Mary-\nland; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci-\nences, Center for Developmental Epidemiology, Duke\nUniversity School of Medicine, Durham, North Caro-\nlina (Dr Costello); and Department of Psychiatry and Be-\nhavioral Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamil-\nton, Ontario, Canada (Dr Georgiades).\nCorrespondence: Ronald C.
