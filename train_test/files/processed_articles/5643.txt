Advocates for either a threshold or linear model perspective have engaged in\na long-term debate over the biological plausibility of their respective models, espe-\ncially in the contentious area of carcinogen risk assessment/regulation. While the\nthreshold vs linearity at low-close debate has cast a dominant shadow over the field\nof risk assessment for nearly three decades, in this paper we propose that the most\nfundamental shape of the dose-response relationship is neither threshold nor linear\nbut U-shaped. This challenge for the primacy of dose-response model dominance\nin toxicology and, in fact, the vast array of biological disciplines by the U-shaped\nperspective cuts to the core beliefs of the field with extremely significant evolution-\nary, ecological, biomedical, clinical, economic and social implications (Calabrese\nand Baldwin, 2001a). The present paper will establish that the hormetic dose re-\nsponse is the most dominant dose-response model in toxicology based on objective,\nhead-to-head comparison with the threshold model; it will demonstrate how the\ntoxicological community missed this basic feature of the dose response, a mistake\nof historical proportions and implications; it will also provide a mechanistic frame-\nwork that can account for quantitative features of the hormetic dose response. This\nevaluation will be placed within an historical context to enhance a balanced under-\nstanding of the unfolding of toxicological thought concerning the dose-response\nthroughout the past century. The paper argues that the hormetic dose response is\nthe central dose-response model in toxicology and needs to be included in all lead-\ning texts and taught as a routine feature of toxicological instruction dealing with the\ndose response and principles of risk assessment.\nDEFINITION\nThe U-shaped dose response model is commonly referred to as hormesis, a dose\nresponse phenomenon characterized by a low-dose stimulation and a high dose\ninhibition. This dose response may take the shape of either the inverted U or a\nj-shaped dose response depending on the endpoint that is measured (Figure 1).\nIn the case of the inverted U-shaped dose response, this may be observed when\nendpoints such as growth, fecundity and longevity are measured. In the case of\nj-shaped dose response relationships, this may be observed when endpoints such as\ndisease incidence are measured.\nWhile the hormetic dose response is often described as either an inverted U- or\nj-shaped dose response, it is best described as a dose-time-response, in which there\nis an initial disruption of homeostasis (i.e., toxicity) followed by a modest overcom-\npensation response which eventually leads to a re-establishment of homeostasis. It\nis this modest overcompensation response which is seen as the hormetic low-dose\nThe phenomenon of hormesis has had a long, but spotty history.

Once toxicology became a reasonably well organized and\nprofessional discipline this dose-response theory found itself excluded from the\nprincipal textbooks, developments of professional societies and the activities of an\never dominant governmental toxicological/risk assessment influence. Despite this\nshunned perspective by the dominant influences in the field of toxicology over the\npast 70 to 80 years, there has been a continuous flow of articles published that\nprovides support to this hypothesis across the broad spectrum of biological sub-\ndisciplines.\nThe term hormesis entered the scientific literature in 1943 when Southam and\nEhrlich reported that extracts from the red cedar tree enhanced the metabolism of\nfungi at low concentrations but inhibited it at higher concentrations. These inves-\ntigators were apparently unaware of a substantial body of literature that described\nsimilar dose responses in plants, microorganisms, insects, and mammalian models\nfrom a variety of chemical agents, including most of the well-studied inorganic con-\ntaminants as well as various forms ofradioactivity (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2000a-e).\nThe primacy of the concept of hormesis is generally credited to Hugo Schulz, a\npharmacologist at the University of Greifswald in northern Germany who based ex-\nperiments dealing with the effects of disinfectants on the metabolism of yeasts in\nthe mid 1880s (Schulz, 1887). The terminology that grew up around the concept of\nhormesis reflected the culture of the time, which had a tendency to name phenom-\nena after their discoverers and to quickly conclude that they reflected some type of\nE.]. Calabrese\nControl\nResponse\nDose ------.\nFigure 2. (A) The general form ofhonnetic dose-responserelationships; (B) the temporal\nsequence of honnetic dose-response relationships.\nbiological \"Law.\" Thus, the initial observations of Schulz along' with his attempts to\ngeneralize the concept resulted in this phenomenon being called the Arndt-Schulz\nLaw or Hueppe's Rule, after the bacteriologist who extended the findings to bac-\nteria (Hueppe, 1896). However, these terms are rarely used today, giving way to\nhormesis or other terms such as U- orj-shaped, biphasic dose response, dual effects,\nbidirectional responses and several others.\nThe early history of what are now called hormetic effects was surprisingly im-\npressive. This phenomenon attracted a number ofwell-known researchers who pub-\nlished their findings in the leading journals of the day. A detailed assessment of\nthe historical foundations of chemical and radiation hormesis has been published\nby Calabrese and Baldwin (2000a-e). Even more impressive was the fact that sev-\neral of the early leading hormetic researchers were direct descendants from Nobel\nPrize winners' laboratories such as Ferdinand Hueppe (see Hueppe, 1896) from\nRobert Koch's lab, Louis Kahlenberg (University ofWisconsin) (see Kahlenberg and\nNobel Prize winner for the discovery ofanaphylaxsis. Other early leaders in hormetic\nresearch with outstanding scientific reputations were Charles Edward Winslow (see\nsity, Benjamin Duggar (1901, 1936) of Cornell University/University of Wisconsin,\nandJensen (1907) at Stanford University. Due to the fact that X-rays and radionu-\nelides were discovered about a decade after the initial research of Schulz, the\nHormesis as Dose-Response Model\nassociation of radioactivity and hormesis was delayed relative to chemical findings.\nNonetheless, substantial evidence emerged by the early 1920s that radiation-induced\nbiphasic dose-response relationships were considered common, reproducible and\nindependent of biological model (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2000c-d). In fact, the\nhormetic dose response wascommonly reported and diagrammed in leading texts on\nbotany and microbiology into the middle decades of the twentieth century (Marshall\nDespite the initial decades of successful hormetic research it became the object\nof opponents who successfully linked it with the medical practice of homeopathy\n(Clark, 1937). This was an easy thing to do since the creator of the concept of\nhormesis, Hugo Schulz, was a very strong proponent of homeopathy and in fact\ninterpreted his findings as providing the scientific foundations of the medical prac-\ntice ofhomeopathy. In fact, the Arndt-Schulz Law was named, in part, after Rudolph\nArndt, a homeopathic physician. As a result ofthe very close association between the\nArndt-Schulz Law and homeopathy it became targeted by enemies ofhomeopathy in\nthe long-running confrontation with what is today called traditional medicine. Even\ntoday, the proponents of homeopathy still point to the work of Schulz as providing\nimportant historical foundations of the biological basis of homeopathy (Bellevite\net al., 1997). However, in the early decades of the twentieth century the homeopa-\nthy movement had major setbacks with numerous homeopathic medical schools in\nthe U.S. being forced to close due to poor academic standards. How these actions\naffected the Arndt-Schulz Lawhas never been studied but it is likely that it negatively\nimpacted its general recognition and acceptance. In fact, as early as 1896 Hueppe\nargued that the findings of Schulz were reproducible and needed to be judged on\ntheir own merits, not coupled with homeopathy, even though this was how Schulz\nhimself framed the question.\nThe downfall of the Arndt-Schulz Law,however, cannot be solely laid at the feet of\nits close association with homeopathy. It had a number ofotherlimitations ofnotable\nimportance that combined to make this theory play scientific catch-up throughout\nthe remainder of the century. For example, the proponents of the Arndt-Schultz\nLaw attempted to transform this dose-response theory into a range of profitable\nbusinesses, claiming, for example, that low doses of radium could be used not only\nas a human elixir but also as a fertilizer for plants at low doses. In both cases it\nhad major public relations failures. In the case of the elixir, its greatest proponent,\nEben Evers, died a very public and painful death from radium-induced bone cancer.\nIn the case of radium as a fertilizer, the findings were consistently equivocal; most\nnotably was the 1948 13-site USDA study although it had important study design\nweaknesses (Alexander, 1950). In addition, the emphasis on the nature of the dose\nresponse during the 1920s and 1930s was not on low-dose effects; in fact, just the\nopposite. Issues that received greatest attention were the effects of disinfectants on\nmicrobes, the effects ofpesticides on a wide range oforganisms, as well as protection\nofworkers from toxic substances. These cases involved instances ofhigh-dose effects.\nFurthermore, it was evident that the investigations of that era did not address the\nE.]. Calabrese\nquantitative features of the hormetic dose response, which in fact are rather modest,\nat least as far as the low-dose stimulation is concerned.\nBy the 1930s, the collective criticisms of the Arndt-Schulz Law had significantly\neroded many of the earlier gains it had made in both the chemical and radiation do-\nmains. Despite the legitimacy of many of these criticisms, this was unfortunate since\nthe data underlying the hormetic hypothesis were generally sound and substantial.\nHowever, as is common in such debates, commercial claims were often proven wrong\nwhile scientific limitations were often exaggerated. This fall from centrality within\nthe scientific community during the early 1930s and subsequent decades occurred\nas major consolidations were taking place in the U.S. and elsewhere with respect to\nhealth and safety issues, statistical foundations of dose-response relationships and\ngovernmental decisions of how to estimate risks from radiological and chemical\nhazards. At this point, tlle Arndt-Schulz Law became generally ignored and has con-\ntinued to be so.\nThis brief assessment of the historical foundations ofhormesis reveals that it was\na theory without either a financial sponsor or a core of leading scientific propo-\nnents, In addition, U.S. science in the twentieth century became one that was nearly\nentirely dependent upon government agency funding and responsive to its intellec-\ntual agenda, often supported by influential bodies such as the National Academy of\nSciences. Lacking tllese crucial elements, hormesis was an hypothesis that failed to\nthrive.\nMajor developments in environmental regulation over the past 40 years have\nprovided the necessary incentive for the reexamination of the hormesis hypothesis.\nWhile this may not seem obvious, it is directly linked to the extraordinary conservative\nprotectionist philosophy of governmental agencies such as the U.S. EPA in their\nrisk-assessment procedures for carcinogens, which assume linearity at low doses.\nSuch governmental actions have led to very high costs being imposed on affected\nindustries and organizations such as the U.S. DOD and DOE. This led to interest\nnot only in exploring the biological foundations of low-dose extrapolation but also\nalternative models of low-dose responses. It became very evident to those leading\nthe affected organizations that if hormesis was right then linearity at low doses was\nwrong. At that point, the 1981 book by Luckey dealing with hormesis and ionizing\nradiation became potentiallysignificant. Ironically, Luckey did not even mention any\nrelationship between hormesis and carcinogenicity. Nonetheless, it sparked interest\nin the concept of radiation hormesis, especially in light of reports in the 1950s and\n1960s suggesting that low doses of radiation may reduce the risks of certain cancers\nin natural high background radiation settings (Luckey, 1991), as well as reports\nsuggesting enhanced longevity in survivors of the atomic bomb blast (Kondo, 1993)\n(see Calabrese and Baldwin, 2002b for review).\nHormesis as Dose-Response Model\nThis combination of factors and the leadership of the Electric Power Research\nInstitute (EPRI) led to the first-ever conference on Radiation Hormesis in1985 in\nOakland, California. Of particular note was that the proceedings were published\ntwo years later in the prestigious journal Health Physics, adding not only enhanced\nvisibility to the topic but that elusive credibility that hormesis lacked. Several years\nWolff (1989) of the University of California at San Francisco debated the viability\nofhormesis as a credible biological hypothesis in the journal Science. Following the\npublication of the Science articles a meeting was held in May 1990 at the University of\nMassachusetts, Amherst to devise a plan to provide balanced leadership for assessing\nhow biological systems respond to low levels ofchemical and physical stressors. Based\non this meeting, the BELLE (Biological Effects ofLow Level Exposures) organization\nwas created that has played a significant role in assessing the hormesis concept (see\nBy the mid-1990s the assessment ofhormesis seemed to fall into groups that either\nthought it was a concept based on reproducible data or were unconvinced, generally\nconcluding that the low-dose stimulation was most likely that of normal variation.\nThese critics contended that the evidence in support ofthe hormesis hypothesis had\nsimply been overinterpreted.\nIn order to move beyond this impasse concerning hormesis, we developed a priori\nevaluative criteria to assess whether a dose-response displayed features consistent\nwith the hormetic/biphasic dose-response. These criteriawere based on study design\ncharacteristics, such as whether the experiment displayed a NOAEL (No Observed\nAdverse Effect Level) and the number ofdoses less than the NOAEL, the magnitude\nofthe low-dose stimulation, the presence or absence ofstatistical significance for the\nstimulatory effects, and the reproducibility of the findings. Each factor considered\nreceived a numerical ranking, which provided a basis for a mathematical algorithm\nto estimate the likelihood that each dose-response yielded evidence consistent with\nthe hormetic hypothesis. We also developed a relational retrieval database into which\ninformation from numerous different content fields from each study could be en-\ntered. With these two tools, evidence from about 5000 experiments was accumulated\nthat provided positive evidence of hormesis. An assessment of the findings indicates\nthat hormetic dose-response relationships are very generalizable, being indepen-\ndent of biological model, endpoint measured and chemical class/physical stressor\nset of examples of dose-response relationships that are consistent with the hormetic\nhypothesis. They were selected to demonstrate the range of biological models and\nendpoints in which hormetic responses may occur.\nThe creation of this hormesis database using objective criteria was an impor-\ntant first step in the assessment of hormesis as a credible biological hypothesis.

Vol. 1, No, 3, 2003\nHormesis as Dose-Response Model\nimportance was that the evaluative criteria were sufficiently specific and objective\nthat they led to negligible variation among those evaluating dose responses for the\npresence or absence of evidence concerning hormesis. It was this type of consis-\ntency that was sought in order to overcome the disparity of the conclusions that\nproponents and opponents had expressed on the topic.\nAn assessment of this database revealed important characteristics of hormetic\ndose-response relationships. Most notably, the magnitude ofthe low-dose stimulation\nwas generally quite modest. In most cases the maximum stimulation did not exceed\ntwo-fold greater than the concurrent control group. The maximum response was\ngenerally about 30-60% greater than the control group response. The width of the\nstimulatory response was more variable than that of the magnitude of the low-dose\nstimulation. Typically the range of the stimulatory responses was within a factor of\n10-20 of the NOAEL dosage. In a small proportion of the cases the dosage range of\nthe stimulation would exceed a factor of 100-fold. In addition, there were occasions\nwhen the stimulatory dosage range would reproducibly exceed 1000-fold.\nOfimportance was that the hormetic stimulation was graphically contiguous with\nand ended at the traditional toxicological NOAEL (Figure 4). This allowed risk\nassessors the opportunity to place hormetic responses within a risk assessment dose-\nresponse context. This would prove to be the case not only for testing purposes\nwithin a hazard assessment framework but also for modeling oflow-dose responses.\nThe second reason is that the hormetic response was closely linked to the occur-\nrence of the initiation of toxicity. In fact, since 1896 (Townsend, 1896) the low-dose\nstimulation had been reported to occur as a result of an overcompensation to a\ndisruption in homeostasis. In fact, this observation, which has been repeatedly re-\nported (Calabrese, 2001), provides the foundation for why the hormetic response is\ninvariably adjacent to the toxicological NOAEL.\nMaximumresponse\nDistance to NOAEL\n,/ (averages 5-fold)\nI------\"'o~-,/ NOAEL\n----~---\nControl\nHormetic Zone\nIncreasing Dose ~\nFigure 4. Dose-response curve depicting the quantitative features of hormesis.\nE.]. Calabrese\nThat hormesis may occur as a result of an overcompensation to low-level toxic\ninsult accounts for why the stimulation is modest, based on the assumption that\nthe disrupted biological process/system will re-establish homeostasis. Under such\ncircumstances it would be expected that the biological processes would use suffi-\ncient resources to ensure that homeostasis is achieved within an appropriate time\nperiod but not to be wasteful of resources. This would result in a predicted modest\n\"overshoot\" phenomenon, which is what is typically observed with many hormetic\ndose-time responses.\nThe quantitative characteristics of the hormetic dose response are therefore con-\nsistent with expected features of a dose time response relationship in which there\nis an initial toxic response. The principal difference in responses between the low\nand high doses is that the low-dose toxicity becomes fully compensated and, in\nfact, modestly overcompensated, resulting in the apparent \"stimulation.\" However,\nthe high-dose toxicity remains unable to fully recover from the extensive damage\nand displays the so-called high-dose \"inhibition.\" Thus, when viewed at the appro-\npriate time in the dose-time response, the hormetic-like biphasic dose response is\nobserved. However, if the dose-time response is seen at an earlier stage of respon-\nsiveness, then the dose response could appear as a traditional dose-dependent toxic\nresponse (Figure 2).\nThis initial assessment ofhormetic responses not onlyyielded evidence to support\nthe existence of hormesis but it also provided valuable toxicological insights. These\nfindings permitted an evaluation of the generalizability of hormesis as well as pro-\nviding a quantitative description of its dose-response features that were consistent\nwith a plausible toxicological model of dose-time responsiveness. In fact, now it be-\ncame clear why hormesis was hard to prove, challenging to replicate and a source of\ncontention among those who had long debated its existence. The key for studying\nhormesis was to be found in the quality of the study design, such as the number\nand spacing of doses below the NOAEL, a definitively characterized NOAEL, and\nthe inclusion of a temporal component that could capture the initial disruption in\nhomeostasis followed by the modest overcompensation response. Likewise, it was\ncritical to select an appropriate biological endpoint in which the control group had\nan adequate background response. For example, selection of a tumor type with an\nanimal strain in which the control group had a negligible background incidence\nwould preclude the assessment of hormesis.\nDespite the advances offered by the database-facilitated assessment of hormesis,\nit did not permit an evaluation of the frequency of hormesis in the toxicological\nliterature. That is, while numerous, in fact thousands, ofexamples ofdose-responses\nconsistent with the hormetic hypothesis existed, this information offered no quan-\ntitative insight concerning the frequency of hormetic responses in the toxicolog-\nical literature. That is, did hormetic effects occur in 1% or 50% of toxicological\nstudies, or someplace in between? This was an important issue to resolve for reg-\nulatory agencies. If a response was real, but a relatively rare phenomenon, then it\ncould be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If, on the other hand, it was commonly\nHormesis as Dose-ResponseModel\nseen, then it would have to be considered as part of the \"rule\" and dealt with\naccordingly.\nTo address the question offrequency, an entirely new database was created which\nhad apriorientry as well as apriorievaluative criteria (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2001a).\nThese new criteria were applied to essentially every article (i.e., 21,000) published in\nthree toxicologically orientedjournals (i.e., EnvironmentalPollution, Bulletin ofEnvi-\nronmental Contamination and Toxicology andLife Sciences) from their creation (i.e., mid\n1960s)to the present. Thesejournalswere selected because they included the spec-\ntrum of ecologically to pharmacologically oriented toxicology. This was important\nin order to address issues related to generalizability by model, endpoint and agent.\nThe data revealed that a priorientry criteria [i.e., a dose-response was required to\nhave a LOAEL (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level), NOAEL, at least two doses\nless than the NOAEL dose and a concurrent control] were satisfied in only about\n2% of the articles assessed. However, of dose responses satisfying the entry criteria\napproximately 40% satisfied a priorievaluative criteria, that is, the functional defini-\ntion of hormesis (e.g., evidence of statistically significant responses for dosages less\nthan the NOAEL dosage).\nThe findings were important in several ways. For the first time there was an es-\ntimate of the frequency of hormesis in the broad toxicological literature. This fre-\nquency revealed that hormetic responses were not rare occurrences and exceptions\nbut were commonly reported. Second, the very low proportion of studies that satis-\nfied the a priorientry criteria indicated that the vast majority of toxicological studies\nhas been incapable of assessing whether hormesis existed or not. These studies, for\nthe most part, lack an adequate number of doses in the low-dose area and could not\ntherefore discern whether there was a reliable low-dose stimulation or not.\nThis insight was important because it provided a cogent explanation for how tox-\nicologists could readily dismiss hormesis. The data indicate that 98% of toxicology\nstudies cannot address the hormesis hypothesis in an adequate evaluative fashion.\nOnly about 50% of the 2% of dose-responses that could assess the hormetic hy-\npothesis actually observed it. Consequently, only one out of every 100 published\ndose-response relationships assessed displayed hormesis. In effect, this type of nu-\nmerical framework further emphasized the marginalized perspective within which\nthe hormetic hypothesis has been held.f\nWhile this assessment addressed the issue ofhormetic effect frequency in the tox-\nicologicalliterature, the second hormesis database (i.e., frequency database) also\nprovided a vehicle to determine which toxicological dose-response model may be\nmore frequent in the toxicological literature: the hormetic or the threshold model.\nThe threshold model assumes that there is no treatment-related effect for doses\nNote that the criteria could have been even more stringent if temporal study design\ncriteria were also included. In fact, the lack of measurement at multiple time points in\nmost experiments satisfying the a priori criteria is a likely contributor to the reason why\nonly 40% of the experiments satisfied the definition of hormesis.\nE.]. Calabrese\nbelow the NOAEL, a type ofquasi-toxicological threshold dose. This further implied\nthat responses of doses below the NOAEL dose would be expected to vary randomly\non either side of the control value. For example, in our frequency database of about\n650 dose responses that satisfied a priorientry criteria, there were nearly 1,800 col-\nlective doses below the NOAEL. The threshold model predicts that there should\nbe a similar number of responses above and below the control value. \"When this\nwas evaluated, the ratio was not 1:1 as predicted by the threshold model but 2.5:1,\na value highly consistent with the hormetic model. Further, the mean response of\nthe nearly 1,800 responses of doses below the NOAEL was 115%, a value consistent\nwith past observations ofhormetic responses (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a). These\nfindings indicated that the responses of doses below the toxicological NOAEL were\nnot randomly distributed butwere non-randomly distributed in a manner suggestive\nofhormesis.\nNot only did these findings refute the perspective ofhormesis being a \"paradox-\nical\" phenomenon, it also suggested that the long-held beliefin the primacy of the\nthreshold model may have been misplaced. This conclusion is of obvious general\nsignificance since acceptance of the hormetic model would irifer profound changes\nin how studies are designed, biological models and endpoints selected, and risk\nassessments performed.\nThe data also provided a framework to account for how the toxicological com-\nmunity, especially mammalian toxicologists, could have missed the hormetic dose-\nresponse model and incorrectlyconcluded that the mostfundamental dose-response\nmodel was the threshold model. This conclusion is supported by several consistent\nobservations. First, the NOAEL responses for about 70% of mammalian studies in\nthe frequency hormesis database were less than the control values. Even though\nthese NOAEL responses were not, by definition, statistically significantly lower than\nthe NOAEL, it is likely that a substantial proportion may have had a low level of\ntoxicity, even ifnot discernable at the P < 0.05 level. Second, in dose responses that\ndid not satisfy the functional definition of hormesis, where the NOAEL was S95%\nof the control, the next lower dose adjacent to the NOAEL had a response that was\ntypically less than the control. At progressively lower doses from the NOAEL dose\nthe responses resembled more hormetic responses (i.e., responses greater than the\ncontrol) (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a). This finding suggests that the majority of\nmammalian toxicological studies have NOAEL values less than the control, many\nprobably have some degree of toxicity, and that toxicity may also be likely in the\nfirst dose below the NOAEL; this makes the phenomenon of hormesis difficult, if\nnot impossible, to observe in such circumstances. Since most mammalian toxicology\nstudies rarely have more tllan one dose below the NOAEL it follows that the logical,\nbut incorrect, conclusion is that the most likely dose-response model would be the\nthreshold model. As a result of this rather limited/incomplete study design-based\nperspective, the \"collective\" field of toxicology drew the wrong conclusion about the\nnature of the dose response in the low dose zone. In fact, it is our contention that\nsimple limitation in the study design, which was focused on high-dose effects, led\nHormesis as Dose-Response Model\nto the apparently \"logical\" conclusion that hormesis was wrong and threshold was\nright, when in fact the full range ofdata are consistent with the opposite conclusion.\nDespite these arguments in favor of the hormetic perspective, there has been\none overriding criticism that toxicologists skeptical of hormesis consistently raise.\nThat is, it is necessary to determine the mechanism(s) by which hormesis occurs.\nUnless the issue of mechanism can be resolved acceptance of hormesis would be\nseen as incomplete. A key limitation in the quest for the hormetic mechanism is\nthat the overwhelming majority of papers published on toxicological mechanisms\ndo not address the underlying explanations of transformations or switches in the\ndose-response relationships from stimulation to inhibition. However, this question is\ntypically addressed in the sub-discipline ofmolecular pharmacology. Our assessment\nof this literature has revealed that hormetic-like biphasic dose-response relationships\noccurred with seemingly comparable frequency in the pharmacology and toxicology\ndomains. However, pharmacologists have both interest in switching mechanisms\nand the molecular tools to assess such changes. We have determined that hormetic-\nlike biphasic dose response relationships have been reported in at least 30 receptor\nsystems (Table 1) for which a highly credible molecular explanation has been offered\nat least to the level of receptor and often at levels of greater complexity (Calabrese\nThese findings reveal that hormetic responses may occur as a result of numerous\nmechanisms, depending on the cell type. There was clearly no single toxicological\nmechanism. However, there appears to be a common biological regulatory strategy\nthat results in the achievement oflimited biological goals (e.g., smooth muscle con-\ntraction/relaxation, regulation of neutrophil migration, cell proliferation enhance-\nment or not) within the context of resource conservation while re-establishing and\nmaintaining homeostasis.\nTable 1.

Calabrese\nOver the past seven years, therefore, we have been able to demonstrate that:\n1) hormesis is widespread in the toxicological literature; 2) that it has consistent\nquantitative features of the dose response; 3) it is highly generalizable according\nto model, endpoint and chemical class; 4) it has a frequency in the toxicological\nliterature that is approximately 40% using very rigorous objective criteria; 5) in\nhead-to-head competition with the threshold model the hormetic model clearly\noutperforms it; 6) it has numerous underlying specific mechanisms. These findings\nchallenge the most basic pillar of the toxicological community concerning what\nmodel best describes how biological systems responded to low levels of chemical\nand physical stressor agents. The data also challenge how toxicological studies are\ndesigned. That is, experiments with inadequate numbers of doses and dose spacing,\nwhich also lack a temporal component, are not going to be able to address the issue\nof hormesis. This is where the vast majority of toxicological studies reside.\nThe concept of hormesis changes how we think about toxicology and risk assess-\nment. In the domain ofhazard assessment; hormesis argues that there are meaning-\nful biological effects below the toxicological NOAEL. Over the past several decades\ntoxicologists and regulatory agencies have been content to derive NOAELs based\non the assumption that there were no treatment-related effects below the NOAEL.\nIf this can no longer be assumed, then it challenges researchers and regulat.ory\nagencies to rethink their study designs and perhaps the biological models used and\nendpoints measured.\nThe acceptance of hormesis as a default assumption in the risk assessment pro-\ncess is one that should be taken seriously. This is because of the overwhelming\namount of data supporting it, especially those findings relating to its frequency in\nthe toxicological literature, its dominance over the threshold model, its widespread\ngeneralizability and the fact that it is difficult to study unless adequate resources and\ntime are allocated. To require that hormesis be proven for every case would place a\nsubstantial burden of both resources and time and for all practical considerations\nwould limit the application of hormetic phenomenon when, in fact, the evidence\nargues that it is a general phenomenon.\nThe area of carcinogen risk assessment is likely to yield the biggest impact of\nhormesis. The most obvious implication of the hormetic model is not that low doses\nof carcinogens may actually reduce cancer risk, but that thresholds for carcinogens\nexist. Even though hormesis was shown above to outperform the threshold model,\nit may be ironically used to support the conclusion that thresholds exist for carcino-\ngens. Unless hormesis can be demonstrated it is quite evident that thresholds for\ncarcinogens will be nearly impossible to prove, as has been the case over the past\ntwo decades.\nWhile the focus of this paper is environmentally oriented, it is important not\nto ignore that the hormetic dose-response is quite common in pharmacology and\nother biological fields concernedwith dose-response relationships. Numerous drugs,\nHormesis as Dose-Response Model\nincluding antibiotics, anti-viral agents, anti-tumor agents and other chemotherapeu-\ntic, as well as most peptides (see Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a,b for their review),\noften display hermetic-like biphasic dose responses. Similar dose responses are seen\nfor plant root exudates (Reigosa et al., 1999) and how they affect germination of\nfungal spores and the growth of plant systems in soil. Biphasic responses are quite\ncommon in the field ofexercise science especially with respect to immune responses\n(Nieman, 2000). The hormetic dose response is therefore one that is most likely ba-\nsic to all biological disciplines, the implications of which have only recently begun\nto be specifically explored (Calabrese, 2000).\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, L.T.
