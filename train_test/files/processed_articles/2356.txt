Bada2\n1 Statistics Research Division, Research Triangle Institute, Rockville, MD.\n2 University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, Lexington, KY.\nMultiple binary outcomes are encountered frequently in epidemiologic research. This work was motivated by\nthe Maternal Lifestyle Study, 1993\u00ad1995, where newborns exposed prenatally to cocaine and a comparison\ncohort were examined for the presence of central and autonomic nervous system (CNS/ANS) signs. Thus, each\ninfant contributed to multiple, possibly interrelated, binary outcomes that may collectively constitute one\nsyndrome (even though specific outcomes that are affected by cocaine are of scientific interest). Because it is\nneither scientifically appropriate nor statistically efficient to fit separate models for each outcome, here we adopt\na multivariate repeated measures approach to simultaneously model all the CNS/ANS outcomes as a function of\ncocaine exposure and other covariates. This formulation has a number of advantages. First, it implicitly\nrecognizes that all the CNS/ANS outcomes may together constitute one syndrome. Second, simultaneous\nmodeling boosts statistical efficiency by allowing for correlations among the outcomes, and it avoids multiple\ncomparisons. Third, it allows for outcome-specific exposure effects, so that the specific signs that are affected by\ncocaine exposure can be identified.\nbinary data; generalized estimating equation; generalized linear mixed model; multiple comparisons; repeated\nmeasures; simultaneous inference; syndrome\nAbbreviations: CNS/ANS, central and autonomic nervous system; GEE, generalized estimating equation; GLMM, generalized\nlinear mixed model.\nBinary outcome measures that indicate the presence or\nabsence of certain medical conditions are a widely used tool\nin epidemiologic investigations. Moreover, public health\nstudies frequently measure an array of such indicators for\ndifferent medical conditions to make an overall assessment\nabout an individual's health status. For instance, overall\nhealth status in newborns is widely assessed through the\nApgar score, which is a scale that is derived by eliciting\nanswers to a series of categorical questions regarding five\noutcomes (color, reflex irritability, muscle tone, respiratory\neffort, and heart rate). Each of these scales generates a score\nof 0\u00ad2, which may be dichotomized according to a hypothe-\nsized threshold for poor outcomes.\nThe traditional approach for statistical analyses of such\nbinary outcomes is logistic regression, where the probability\nof observing an \"event\" (i.e., the prevalence of some medical\ncondition) is modeled as a function of the principal risk\nfactor/treatment of interest and other covariates (1).\nHowever, the situation where multiple binary outcomes are\nsimultaneously assessed on the same individual presents\nsome basic methodological problems in that proper statis-\ntical modeling here should account for the following features\nof the data.\nA. Each individual contributes to multiple outcomes.\nThus, the different outcomes for each individual are\nlikely to be correlated.\nB. These multiple outcomes broadly purport to measure\nthe same underlying condition or construct.\nC. While the multiple outcomes may be measuring the\nsame underlying phenomenon, outcome-specific\neffects (i.e., which specific outcomes are associated\nwith the effect of interest) may still be of scientific\ninterest in many situations.\nadas@rti.org).\nMany researchers have attempted to address issues A and\nB by constructing scores that add up the various outcome\nindicators (which can sometimes also be interpreted as the\ntotal number of adverse medical conditions) and then\nregressing the total score on covariates using linear or\nPoisson regression (2). Others have used latent variable\nmodels to infer about the underlying, yet unobserved,\nprocess that these multiple outcomes purport to measure (3).\nHowever, the principal limitation in both these approaches is\nthat, by focusing on the aggregate, they lose the ability to\ndiscern outcome-specific effects (i.e., which specific\noutcomes are associated with the effect of interest) that may\nbe of substantive interest, thus failing to address issue C.\nThis is critical, since aggregation of multiple outcomes risks\ncombining indicators of distinct processes, which could\nmask subtle relations between specific outcomes and risk\nfactors. Moreover, latent variable models generally entail\nstrong (often untestable) modeling assumptions that may\nsignificantly impact analytical findings in ways that may not\nbe obviously discernible.\nIndividual analyses of each outcome, with separate\nlogistic regression models being fitted for each indicator,\nwould satisfy issue C but at the expense of issues A and B.\nSpecifically, outcomes assessed on the same individual are\nlikely to exhibit intracluster correlation, since they are\nsubject to shared influences that are particular to that indi-\nvidual (or cluster). If data on these underlying shared influ-\nences (detailed individual-level information such as genetic\nmakeup, environmental exposures, and so on) are available,\nidentifying and including these factors as covariates in the\nregression model may account for this clustering to some\nextent. However, in practice, it is highly unlikely that all\nsuch factors can be identified and measured to the extent that\nintracluster correlation gets reduced to a negligible level.\nIgnoring correlations among the multiple outcomes essen-\ntially wastes valuable information by not exploiting this\ndistinctive covariance structure in the data, whereby the\noverall variability in the outcomes can be broken down into\nthat between individuals and that within individuals. This\napproach will generally produce inefficient estimates, and\nthe loss in precision resulting from not utilizing information\nacross the multiple outcomes may be substantial (4).\nA related problem with individual analyses for each\noutcome is that of multiple comparisons. Specifically, fitting\nseparate logistic regression models for each individual\noutcome would leave the analysis vulnerable to a multiple\ncomparisons problem, whereby performing several tests on\nthe same kinds of variables in the same data inflates the type\nI error to magnitudes that are unacceptably higher than the\nnominal significance level.\nIn this paper, we adopt a multivariate modeling approach\nto analyze multiple binary outcomes in a statistical frame-\nwork that addresses all three issues (A, B, and C) presented\nearlier. Note that a solution already exists for paired binary\ndata through the use of bivariate logistic regression models\n(5). However, that methodology is limited to two binary\noutcomes assessed for each individual. Our approach builds\nupon this work and extends to the multiple (i.e., >2)\noutcomes setting, where we borrow from statistical methods\nfor longitudinal and repeated measures data to simulta-\nneously model all the outcomes assessed on an individual.\nThus, we assume that each individual contributes a vector of\ncorrelated binary outcomes, all of which may be jointly\ninfluenced by his/her treatment/risk factor status and other\npersonal traits.\nThere are several advantages to such a repeated measures\napproach. First, it explicitly recognizes that all the outcomes\nfor an individual may be correlated. Second, the fact that a\nsingle model captures all the outcomes underlines that they\nmay collectively constitute one overarching condition or\nconstruct. Third, by simultaneously modeling all the\noutcomes, this approach avoids the multiple comparisons\nproblem. Fourth, in spite of the simultaneous modeling\nformulation, by appropriately nesting the effect of interest\n(treatment or principal risk factor) within the multiple\noutcomes, we can test for the outcome-specific effects in\nwhich we are interested. At the same time, by constructing\nproper linear contrasts, we can test whether such separate\neffects for each outcome are, in fact, supported by the data.\nIf not, we may choose to examine a simpler global effect.\nFinally, this technique is statistically more efficient (in terms\nof conserving degrees of freedom and enhancing the power\nto observe significant effects) than fitting separate models\nfor each outcome.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The next section\nprovides a brief background on the public health study that\nmotivated this research. Details on the statistical methods\nused to put our multivariate modeling approach into opera-\ntion are presented next, followed by the results of applying\nthese methods to actual data from our motivational study.\nFinally, we conclude with some general observations on the\nsubstantive and methodological implications of this exercise.\nThis paper is motivated by data from the Maternal Life-\nstyle Study, which is a multisite prospective cohort study\nthat aims to evaluate the relation between maternal cocaine\nand/or opiate use during pregnancy and the presence of acute\nneonatal complications and long-term adverse neurodevel-\nopmental outcomes in infants (6). The Maternal Lifestyle\nStudy is the largest prospective study of its kind to date, with\n11,811 mother-infant dyads enrolled at baseline. Maternal\ncocaine and/or opiate use during the index pregnancy was\ndetermined for all the enrolled subjects using a combination\nof self-report and subsequent laboratory verification (infant\nmeconium toxicology). The 8,351 subjects, for whom\ncocaine/opiate exposure status could be conclusively\nconfirmed, are the focus of this paper.\nNewborns in the Maternal Lifestyle Study were examined\nwithin the first few days after birth for the presence of a\nconstellation of abnormal neurobehavioral manifestations,\nknown collectively as central and autonomic nervous system\n(CNS/ANS) signs, to determine whether the prevalence of\nsuch signs was disproportionately higher in children exposed\nprenatally to cocaine (7). The recording of these signs was\nconsidered clinically meaningful because they comprise the\nmanifestations reported with neonatal \"abstinence\nsyndrome\" or neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome (8, 9),\nand previous studies have reported that cocaine-exposed\nRepeated Measures for Modeling Multiple Outcomes 893\ninfants exhibited more stress behavior and central nervous\nsystem signs, as well as increased tone, motor activity, jerky\nmovements, and tremors, than did nonexposed controls (10,\nThe significant feature of CNS/ANS signs that is impor-\ntant for this study is that, essentially, they are a collection of\nseveral presence/absence type (i.e., binary) outcomes that\nare assessed on the same individual simultaneously. More-\nover, even though there is speculation in the medical litera-\nture that these signs collectively constitute one syndrome\n(12), researchers are at the same time interested in knowing\nspecifically which CNS/ANS signs are associated with\nprenatal cocaine exposure, and whether cocaine and opiates\ndifferentially affect different sets of signs. This necessitates\nthe examination of outcome-specific effects in our study\nwhile bearing in mind that the various signs from each infant\nare highly interrelated.\nTable 1 presents an association matrix for the different\nCNS/ANS signs, where the pairwise associations between\nthese binary outcomes are measured in terms of odds ratios\nthat characterize their interrelatedness. The high degree of\nassociation between these signs demonstrated here (for\ninstance, an infant with jitteriness/tremors was 16.6 times\nmore likely to manifest with hypertonia, 11.3 times more\nlikely to be difficult to console, 9.3 times more likely to be\nirritable, and so on) seems to support the contention that\nthese signs may collectively constitute one syndrome. The\ntable also shows that data analyses for this study may be\nfurther complicated by the low prevalence rates for most of\nthese signs. (Note that, of the 12 CNS/ANS signs originally\nmeasured in the study, three (difficult to arouse, hyperalert,\nand hyperactive) had to be dropped because of extremely\nlow prevalence, which made meaningful statistical analyses\nimpossible.)\nIn summary, table 1 demonstrates that the odds ratios,\nwhich capture the statistical dependence between signs from\nthe same child, are in general both substantial in magnitude\nand highly significant. Ignoring this clearly apparent disper-\nsion structure in the data would lead to inefficient estimates\nand inaccurate inferences. These factors underscore the\nnecessity of adopting the multivariate modeling/repeated\nmeasures approach outlined in the previous section for the\nanalysis of these data.\nMETHODS\nThere are several different approaches available for imple-\nmenting a multivariate repeated measures approach that\nmodels clustered binary data, that is, methods that simulta-\nneously model all the binary outcomes elicited from an indi-\nvidual (13). Most of these approaches can be grouped into\ntwo classes: population-averaged marginal modeling using\ngeneralized estimating equations (GEEs) (5, 14, 15) and\ncluster-specific hierarchical modeling using generalized\nlinear mixed models (GLMMs) (16, 17). In the following\nsubsections, we discuss the application of these two methods\nin the context of our study and then seek to justify the\napproach that we finally adopted.\nPopulation-averaged approach\nHere we would model average CNS/ANS prevalence over\ncocaine-exposed and -unexposed children who share\ncommon explanatory features, while accounting for correla-\ntion among multiple CNS/ANS outcomes from the same\nchild. Note that, if there is heterogeneity in these prevalence\nrates across the different signs, the overall cocaine effect\nwould be the average of individual cocaine effects for each\nsign.\nThe population-averaged marginal GEE model may be\nexpressed as follows. If Yij\nindicates the presence of the jth\nTABLE 1.

Note that, in this formulation, we\ncan easily construct a test for the null hypothesis H0\n= 2), j = 1, ..., m, that examines whether it is indeed\nreasonable to assume separate cocaine (opiate) effects for\neach sign. Failure to reject this test would indicate that the\ncocaine (opiate) effect is the same for all the CNS/ANS\nsigns, and a simpler model reflecting the same may better\ndescribe the data at hand.\nInterpretation of regression coefficients from this model is\nstraightforward. Thus, 1j\n) is the average log odds ratio\nfor the jth CNS/ANS sign in children exposed to cocaine\n(opiates) relative to children who were not exposed to\ncocaine (opiates). Further, since preliminary exploratory\nanalyses indicated a wide range of prevalence rates for the\ndifferent CNS/ANS signs, we incorporated sign-specific\nintercepts in the regression model displayed in equation 1 to\naccount for this feature in the data.\nThere are several advantages to adopting the above GEE\nmodeling approach for our data. First, the population-aver-\naged marginal modeling formulation in equation 1 provides\npopulation average estimates of overall trends that are\nimportant from a public health perspective. Second,\ncompared with cluster-specific approaches that generally\ninvolve multidimensional integration (numerical or other-\nwise) of random effects, the GEE estimation algorithm is\ncomputationally efficient for relatively large data sets such\nas ours (where n = 8,351 and m = 9). It is also widely imple-\nmented in standard-use statistical packages for correlated\ndata analysis, such as SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North\nCarolina), SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois), STATA\n(Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas), and SUDAAN\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina) software (18, 19). Third, note that the model\ndepicted in equation 1 uses odds ratios rather than correla-\ntion coefficients to model dependence between signs from\nthe same child. This is preferable, since odds ratios provide a\nmore natural framework for modeling the within-subject\ndependencies that are induced by the binary responses we\nhave in this study (20).\nCluster-specific approach\nHere, we adjust for multiple outcomes by allowing for\nchild-specific regression coefficients, that is, coefficients\nthat vary from one child to another. This technique acknowl-\nedges the distinctive characteristics of each child that could\nmake his/her responses differ. The cluster-specific approach\nthus uses a flexible modeling formulation that allows each\nchild to have his/her own unique CNS/ANS profile, which\nmay depend on the child's cocaine exposure status (and\nother covariates).\nA cluster-specific GLMM consists of a two-step hierar-\nchical regression framework, where the first step models the\nprevalence of CNS/ANS signs for a child as a function of\nhis/her cocaine and opiate exposure, as well as an overall\nchild-specific effect \ni\n. In the next step, this unobserved\nchild-specific effect is related to observed child-level covari-\nates through a linear regression equation. Given the notation\ndeveloped earlier, this model can thus be written as follows:\nStep I: (Yij\n\ni\n)  Bernoulli(pij\n),\nwhere\nlogit(pij\n) = \ni\n+ \nj\ncoci\nopii\n.\nStep II: \ni\n= xi\n + ei\n,\nwhere\nei\nHere, the \ni\ndenote cluster (i.e., child)-specific effects that\nare unique for the ith child. The variance for the residual\nerror terms ei\n(i.e., 2) reflects natural heterogeneity among\nchildren in terms of unmeasured characteristics such as indi-\nvidual temperament, genetic makeup, environmental expo-\nsure, and so on. Note that, similar to the GEE model, this\nformulation also allows us to easily test whether separate\nexposure effects are merited for each CNS/ANS sign or\nwhether a global effect may suffice.\nCompared with the population-averaged model, there are\nsome subtle differences in interpretation for the regression\ncoefficients in equation 2. Here, 1j\n) may be interpreted\nas the log odds ratio for the jth CNS/ANS sign when a child\nis exposed to cocaine (opiates), relative to when that same\nchild is not exposed to cocaine (opiates).\nThe principal motivation in adopting this cluster-specific\napproach for our study is that it is more appropriate than\npopulation-averaged GEE methods for estimating the effects\nof within-cluster covariates, that is, covariates that change\nwithin the subject (12). This is especially relevant for our\nstudy, since the sign-specific exposure effects captured by\n1 and 2 (in equation 2) that are our primary focus are\ncovariates of this type. Moreover, software that enables the\nfitting of such models is also gradually becoming available\nThere are other advantages of the cluster-specific\napproach as well. First, it allows for CNS/ANS signs from\nthe same child to be interrelated by allowing each child to\nhave a different mean prevalence for such signs. Second, the\nincorporation of an additional subject-specific level of vari-\nability (2) ensures that we allow for regression heteroge-\nneity by accommodating varying regression models across\nchildren. Third, the multilevel model presented in equation 2\nguards against aggregation bias by breaking down any struc-\nRepeated Measures for Modeling Multiple Outcomes 895\nture in the data into within-child and between-children\ncomponents. Finally, the GLMM formulation provides esti-\nmates that are clinically more meaningful, since they purport\nto make inferences about the individual rather than a popula-\ntion average as in the GEE (23).\nOur approach\nThe literature on modeling of longitudinal and repeated\nmeasures does not present any clear consensus on the rela-\ntive statistical merits of either of the approaches discussed\nabove. Given the subtle differences in interpretation between\nestimates derived from the two, either approach may be valid\ndepending on the question one is interested in answering.\nAlthough the cluster-specific approach is considered more\nappropriate for assessing the effects of within-cluster covari-\nates, at the same time it makes untestable assumptions about\nthe effects of cluster-level covariates (12). On the other\nhand, although a marginal modeling approach may not be\nsuitable for estimating the within-cluster effects that are of\ninterest in this study, it does provide estimates that are more\nrobust to model misspecification (especially in terms of the\ncorrelation structure in the data). However, this comes at a\nprice--unlike the GLMM, the GEE model is not strictly\nparametric and hence does not produce a likelihood func-\ntion--which makes it impossible to use traditional likeli-\nhood-based procedures for model selection or to determine\ngoodness-of-model fit.\nThe competing considerations discussed above present a\nsubstantial dilemma for us, since within-cluster sign-specific\nexposure effects that are best estimated by cluster-specific\napproaches are the focus of our study, while the population-\naveraged approach provides robust estimates that are more\nintuitively appealing from a public health perspective. In\nlight of these concerns and the consequent ambiguities that\nare involved, we decided to apply both approaches to our\ndata to enable the answering of different kinds of research\nquestions and, simultaneously, to investigate whether these\ntwo approaches produce different conclusions in this respect.\nRESULTS\nFigures 1\u00ad4 present the results from fitting the models\npresented in equations 1 and 2 to our data. Aside from sign-\nspecific intercepts and cocaine and opiate effects, potential\nconfounders (such as study site, maternal race, socioeco-\nFIGURE 1.

Parameter estimates for\nsign-specific intercepts (presented in an exponentiated form as the odds for each sign) were derived using both the population-averaged gener-\nalized estimating equation (GEE) and the cluster-specific generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approaches.

This model estimated the odds ratio for\nwithin-subject dependence (i.e., e) to be 4.2 (95 percent\nconfidence interval: 3.8, 4.7), indicating substantial within-\nchild (or intracluster) dependence in the data. Further, it\nstrongly rejected the possibility of a common global expo-\nsure effect for either cocaine (p < 0.0001) or opiates (p =\n0.009), thus supporting our formulation of separate sign-\nspecific effects for each.\nThe GLMM presented in equation 2 was fitted using the\n\"xtlogit\" command in STATA version 7.0 (Stata Corpora-\ntion) software, which estimates the parameters in a GLMM\nusing Gaussian quadrature. This approach yielded an esti-\nmated subject-level variability (2) of 2.25 (95 percent confi-\ndence interval: 2.0, 2.6), which again attests to the presence\nof substantial within-child dependence in the data. As in the\nGEE model, the possibility of a common global exposure\neffect was strongly rejected here for both cocaine (p =\nlation of separate sign-specific effects for each.\nThe results presented in figures 1\u00ad4 show that the GEE\nand GLMM approaches produced similar results in most\ncases. However, there are some subtle differences that are\nworth mentioning. The cocaine effects for two central\nnervous system signs (difficult to console and high-pitched\ncry) are statistically significant (i.e., the 95 percent confi-\ndence intervals for the odds ratios exclude the value of 1.0)\nfor the GLMM but not for the GEE model (figure 4). More-\nover, compared with the GEE model, the within-cluster (i.e.,\nsign-specific) cocaine/opiate effects estimated by the\nGLMM appear to have consistently higher magnitudes and\nwider confidence limits (figures 3 and 4). Interestingly, this\npattern seems to be reversed for the other factors included in\nthe model (intercepts and cluster/individual-level sociode-\nmographic covariates), where the GEE estimates have\nconsistently higher magnitudes and wider confidence limits\nfor statistically significant factors (figures 1 and 2).\nThese results are largely along expected lines. They bear\nout the assertions made in the literature that, while popula-\ntion-averaged GEE approaches are most appropriate for\nassessing the effects of cluster-level covariates (for these\nFIGURE 2.

In\nthe latter situation, it is the GEE approach that yields attenu-\nated estimates and confidence intervals that are too narrow.\nThis is expected because, by definition, the population-aver-\naged approach averages individual cocaine/opiate effects\nacross subjects, and this generally attenuates the estimated\neffect size (25). Score tests for the GEE model and likeli-\nhood ratio tests for the GLMM indicated substantial cocaine\nand opiate effects overall (p < 0.0001 in all cases), although\nnot all signs were significantly, or similarly, affected (figures\n3 and 4). Other significant covariates included study site and\nprenatal exposure to tobacco (figure 2).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the largest multisite study of its kind to date, we found\nthat prenatal exposures to both cocaine and opiates were\nstrongly associated with elevated risk of CNS/ANS manifes-\ntations. These effects were present even after controlling for\ninterdependence among multiple signs observed on the same\nchild, as well as potential confounders such as race, gesta-\ntional age, socioeconomic status, and prenatal exposures to\ntobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Moreover, even though\ndifferent signs were found to be differentially associated\nwith cocaine and opiate exposure in terms of both magnitude\nand statistical significance, opiate effects, in general, were of\na larger magnitude than those for cocaine. Further substan-\ntive details on these findings and their clinical and public\nhealth implications have been discussed at length by Bada et\nIn terms of statistical methodology, we have presented\nhere an approach that adapts repeated measures techniques\nused primarily for analyzing longitudinal binary data to\nmodel multiple clinical outcomes (of the presence/absence\nvariety) manifest by the same subject at the same time simul-\ntaneously. This formulation recognizes implicitly that all the\noutcomes may be interrelated and could together constitute\none syndrome. Simultaneous modeling of all the outcomes\nalso boosts statistical efficiency and avoids the multiple\ncomparisons problem, while allowing for the testing of\noutcome-specific effects, if necessary. There are subtle\ndifferences in conceptualization and interpretation between\nthe population-averaged GEE and the cluster-specific\nGLMM methods that may be used for implementing this\nFIGURE 3.

Though\nsmall in most cases, these differences are borne out by the\nresults presented for this study. In sum, outcome-specific\neffects may be reliably estimated from a GLMM, while\nsubject-level effects may be best estimated using a GEE\nmodel.\nThe methods described in this paper are applicable in more\ngeneral settings involving multiple outcomes measured\nsimultaneously on the same subject. In fact, they are suitable\nfor any set of outcomes that can be modeled using the expo-\nnential family of distributions. For example, suppose we had\ncontinuous, categorical, or count responses instead of the\nbinary outcomes that we have dealt with here. Such a situa-\ntion can be modeled in both the population-averaged and\ncluster-specific approaches by suitably altering the logit link\nfunction for the expected value of the response that is speci-\nfied in equations 1 and 2. For continuous outcomes this\nwould be the identity link, for count data it would be the log\nlink, and so on. Even for binary outcomes, other links such\nas the probit link may be explored. We do, however, caution\nthat the STATA \"xtlogit\" command we have used to esti-\nmate our GLMM parameters cannot accommodate other link\nfunctions (such as log or probit) or more complicated corre-\nlation structures (e.g., a three-level hierarchical model with\nmultiple binary outcomes nested in individuals nested in\nclinical sites). Other software options would need to be\nexplored in such situations. In sum, since investigators in\npublic health research frequently measure multiple clinical\noutcomes on the same subject at the same time, we believe\nthat the principles underlying the methods described in this\npaper are of significant importance to public health research\nin general.\n"
