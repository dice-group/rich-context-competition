Ogbu and Banks are used to inform the discussion\nregarding the formation of group identity. Data were collected and triangulated by interviews, surveys, observations, and\ndocuments. The findings revealed that socio-cultural values and strategies from their Caribbean community provided the\nsupport needed to build a positive self-identity. In addition, middle-class values that included educational attainment and hard\nwork further supported their persistence through STEM education and their participation in STEM careers. A new model,\nthe Self-Actualization Model (SAM), emerged as graphic representation for presenting the findings.\n",

In the\nUnited States, there still remains the belief that women do\nnot possess the intelligence to be successful in science and\nmath subjects (Good, Aronson, & Harder, 2008; Gornick,\n1990). Furthermore, the belief that Blacks are less intelligent\ncreates barriers to access (McGrady & Reynolds, 2013;\nunderrepresentation of Blacks in STEM education and\ncareers (Hill, Corbett, & Rose, 2010; National Academy of\nThe study addresses the following question:\nResearch Question 1: How have Panamanian, Afro\nCaribbean immigrant women navigated the barriers of\nrace and gender to persist in STEM training and partici-\npate in STEM careers?\nUnderstanding how these women successfully maneu-\nvered through these hegemonic and misogynistic systems\nmay lead to supportive strategies for all women of African\ndescent who are presently underrepresented in STEM. These\nwomen not only participated in STEM but also rose to lead-\nership and management positions in their respective fields.\nFries-Britt, Mwangi, and Peralta (2014) assert that racial\nand ethnic identities are formulated from one's home\ncountry, and their unique construction regarding race/ethnic\nidentification affects individual and group identity. This\nstudy argues that socio-cultural factors and beliefs form the\nself-identity of the women, and this influenced their tenacity\ntoward their STEM vocation. It does not rely on a science\nidentity model for women of color because (even within\nthose models) the authors conclude that further research is\nneeded to understand why students engage in those specific\nidentity behaviors (Carlone & Johnson, 2007). Borrowing\n(2004), a theoretical framework on identity is proposed to\nunderstand the construction of group or collective identity\nbut not to assert that group identity formation are the same\nfor Afro Caribbean and African Americans; they are not.\nThis study relies on ethnic and cultural markers to define\nthe term Black rather than relying on racial constructs. It\ntherefore uses the terms Black women and women of African\ndescent interchangeably. Race constructs attempt to create\nsocial structures that provide privilege for those who possess\ncomparatively lighter skin (Burton, Bonilla-Silva, Ray,\n1University of Johannesburg, Auckland Park, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nBeverly A.

The text considers\nCollins's (2000) critical social theory to interrogate the ways\nin which identity that is prescribed by others serve to define\nthose of African descent. From the experiences of these Afro\nCaribbean women, insights are gleaned into the specific\nchallenges that exist for women of African descent.\nSTEM careers are lucrative and tend to include high sala-\nries and economic opportunities (Ong, 2011; Saxenian,\n1999). Using the STEM Occupation Classification, STEM\ncareers include all those employed in computer, mathemat-\nics, engineering, life science, physical science, and social\nscience. STEM-related occupations include health care pro-\nfessionals, architects, and technicians to name a few\n(Landivar, 2013). Furthermore, Sadler, Sonnert, Hazari, and\nTai (2012) use a survey to assess the responses of those in\nSTEM and their direct support to students to interrogate the\ngender inequities in STEM. They classify STEM workers as\nthose with research and expertise in science (i.e., biologist,\nengineers); they include scientists and science teachers\nbecause of their STEM knowledge and direct influence in\nsupporting students through STEM pipelines.\nIn this study, I will use STEM with this broad definition to\ninclude all those in science, technology/computer science,\nengineering, mathematics, health professions, and those\nteachers who specifically teach science and influence those\nwho aspire a STEM career.\nReview of the Literature\nThere has been a steady increase in the representation of\nwomen in STEM since the 1970s, nonetheless women only\noccupy 26% of STEM jobs, and men hold 74% (Landivar,\nues to be an issue for STEM membership, disparity contin-\nues in racial classification as well. The findings revealed that\nengineering jobs, and White women represented 18%. This\nindicates that Whites represent 69% of all STEM jobs and\nrepresent 63.6% of the U.S. population. Asians had a com-\nbined gender membership of 18% in STEM, although they\nare 5% of the population (for this reason, they are not classi-\nfied as underrepresented in STEM). Blacks are 12% of the\npopulation but only 5% of STEM members.\nThe pattern of underrepresentation is especially disheart-\nening when focused on Black women, or women of African\ndescent. Although these women are 6% of the total Black\npopulation in the United States, they held only 2% of science\nand engineering jobs. This is a significant underrepresenta-\ntion in gender as well as race (NSF, 2013).\nIn 2005, 40% of all full-time faculty in colleges and univer-\nsities in the United States were women (McNeely & Vlaicu,\ners in engineering were African American women. African\nAmerican women appeared to fare only slightly better in the\n(Hill et al., 2010). There remains a gap between women of\nAfrican descent and the remaining tenured faculty.\nHowever, the data cited does not differentiate African\nAmericans from foreign-born Blacks. Therefore, it may be\nthe case that the numbers cited do not solely represent the\npercentage of African Americans present in STEM in com-\nparison with foreign-born members of African descent.\nInstead, these statistics may be representative of all Black\nwomen inclusive of immigrants employed in STEM careers\nwithin the United States (i.e., Afro Caribbeans and Africans).\nHarvard University admissions data reported that of the\nwere not foreign-born. This reflected an increase in the popu-\nlation of African and West Indians on their campus (Roach,\n2005). This challenges Affirmative Action assumptions\nregarding access and diversity among African Americans or\nNative Born Blacks. Diversity on such campuses may have\nincreased for those of African descent, but there is not a sig-\nnificant increase among the African American community.\nWhat seems to be emerging is a pattern of inclusion in STEM\neducational pathways and careers among foreign-born Blacks\nfrom theAfro Caribbean immigrant population (Glenn, 2007).\nAlthough literature continues to highlight the underrepre-\nsentation of African American and Hispanic females in\nSTEM, there remains a gap. Literature has not considered the\ninclusion of immigrant women in STEM who are of African\ndescent and Hispanic. This population is racialized as Black\nand experience similar struggles for inclusion as African\nAmerican women (Burton et al., 2010; Fries-Britt et al.,\nThe term Hispanic is not a racial term but an ethnic one,\nand therefore, a female may be of African descent and of\nHispanic heritage; it means they speak fluent Spanish and are\nacculturated in the Hispanic culture (Quiros & Dawson,\nsociety and the emphasis on race is often unfamiliar to Black\nimmigrants because their racial identity is shaped from a\ncountry other than the United States (Fries-Britt et al., 2014).\nIn many of the countries that Black immigrants arrive, iden-\ntity is shaped by ethnicity rather than race.\nAfro Caribbean Immigrants\nAfro Caribbeans are the largest Black immigrant population\nin the United States, comprising 9% of the overall immigrant\nKing Miller 3\npopulation (McCabe, 2011). Of this number, about 8% are\nfrom Spanish-speaking countries, including the Dominican\nRepublic, Mexico, Panama, and Cuba. With regard to\nPanama, one third of those who immigrated to the United\nFurthermore, Panamanians have the highest reported edu-\ncated adults or those with at least a bachelor's degree at the\ntime of emigration (Stoney & Batalova, 2013).\nTseng (2006) found that first-, second-, and third-genera-\ntion immigrants who were European, African, Afro\nCaribbean, Asian, and Latin American entered math and sci-\nence fields at similar rates. However, in the second and third\ngeneration, students from each ethnic group showed a sig-\nnificant decrease in selecting math and science fields of\nstudy. Thus, the more assimilated the immigrant population\nbecomes in the American educational system, the greater the\nlikelihood that they will abandon the pursuit of STEM-\nrelated subjects and careers (Tseng, 2006).\nOne concern is the ways in which the educational system\nbegins to marginalize students based on skin color once they\nbecome assimilated into American culture. This may result\nin a disparity between new immigrants and those who may\nlook and sound like African Americans. For the second gen-\neration and those who arrived in the United States very\nyoung, there is pressure from their African American peers to\nconform in speech and behavior (Woldemikael, 1989). In\naddition, becauseAfro Caribbeans share the same racial clas-\nsification as African Americans, they are vulnerable to the\nsame forms of racial discrimination (Rogers, 2006).\nAfro Caribbean women in particular have a long history\nof STEM participation as nurses in the United States (Clarke\n& Riviere, 1989). In contrast to the findings in the underrep-\nresentation of Blacks in STEM careers, Afro Caribbean\nwomen from Panama have navigated STEM education suc-\ncessfully and advanced into STEM career pathways. Afro\nCaribbean women were the highest earners when compared\nwith African Americans and African, French, and Spanish\nimmigrants of African descent (Corra & Kimuna, 2009).\nThis earning advantage could be due to their career choice in\nSTEM-related fields. However, the careers were not disag-\ngregated. Nevertheless, Afro Caribbean women seem to be\nrealizing greater success in some areas of STEM (i.e., nurses\nand other health professions). Furthermore, when compared\nwith African Americans, Afro Caribbean immigrants had\nhigher household incomes and were more likely to own their\nown homes and to have completed at least a college degree\nTheoretical Framework\nCollective Identity\nTo explain the racialized structure in the United States that\nmany Black immigrants encounter, I draw on the work of\nJohn Ogbu, a researcher and Black immigrant to the United\nare designed to privilege one group (high caste), while others\nare assigned to service-level castes (low caste). He explains\nthat in the United States, those who are characterized as the\ndominant class, or high caste, are of European decent or\nCaucasians. Those who are characterized as minorities or are\nnon-White are often relegated to low-caste status. Ogbu\nstatus: involuntary and voluntary minorities. Involuntary\nminorities are those who were subjugated against their will.\nAccording to Ogbu, U.S. involuntary minorities include\nAfrican Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics of the\nSouthwest. They are tasked with learning the language and\nculture of the dominant group to assimilate. Furthermore,\nthis assimilation into the dominant culture system is often\nnecessary to participate in the socio-cultural structure; how-\never, the dominant group is not compelled to learn the cul-\nture or language of the involuntary minority group (Ogbu,\nConversely, voluntary minorities moved from their home\ncountry to the host country by choice. They are able to leave\nof their own volition and select another host country at will\ntypes imposed by the dominant culture do not necessarily\nVoluntary minorities to the United States who are of\nAfrican descent often do not share a history that includes a\nhegemonic structure that perpetuates a low-caste involuntary\nminority identity. Collective identity (Ogbu, 2008) is shaped\nby the socio-cultural structures that constrain agency (Hays,\n1994). Collective identity is ultimately expressed in the form\nof the beliefs, feelings, and cultural symbols that inform a\nshared sense of belonging. Afro Caribbeans began as slaves\nor involuntary minorities in their island homes. However,\nduring and after slavery, they took advantage of economic\nopportunities to create better educational and economic out-\nThese opportunities provided for their movement in class\nstatus through economic and educational attainment within\nSocial Structure and Identity Construction\nWeber (1994) describes class as any group of persons who\noccupy the same situation. He describes two class structures:\nthe property class and the acquisition class. The property\nclass owns property, and has political control and access to\nresources. These resources include the ability to take advan-\ntage of educational opportunities for themselves and their\nchildren. In contrast, the acquisition class does not possess\nthe advantages of the property class. Instead, they use oppor-\ntunities to acquire the services and goods that are available to\nthe property class.\nAcquiring an education is valued by the property class.\nBy extension, due to their persistence for education, it\n4 SAGE Open\nappears that Afro Caribbean immigrants are striving for\nmembership in the property class. Although some Afro\nCaribbean immigrants may not have the economic wealth to\nbe proper members of the property class, it appears they\nadopt the behaviors and values of the property class to move\nout of the acquisition class.\nClass and caste membership structures are a reflection of\n1987). The U.S. social structure appears to support Whites as\nthe primary members of the property class, or dominant\ngroup. It also distinguishes African Americans from Afro\nCaribbeans and other immigrants of African descent who are\nBlack because of the ways in which the hegemonic structure\nserved to constrain the African American population.\nAfter slavery, Jim Crow laws determined where Black\nAmericans could eat, shop, walk, and live. These laws\nimposed a structure that confined Black Americans to a\nlow-caste, second-class citizenship. This hegemonic\nstructure defined the boundaries and social movement.\nThus, \"Blacks did not become over-represented in the\nlower class in America because their genetic make-up\nwas inferior, but because they were enslaved, then segre-\ngated and barred from equal opportunity for more than\ntion, this structure was designed to ensure that those of\nAfrican descent, who were brought to the country as\ninvoluntary minorities, were assigned to the low caste. In\ncontrast, Afro Caribbeans who entered the United States\nas voluntary minorities personified a collective identity\nexempt of the confines of the class membership that\nAfrican Americans fought to resist (Rothstein, 2004;\nTo further articulate the conundrum for African\nAmericans, James Banks (2004) identifies typologies that\nhave affected African American collective identity. The goal\nof Banks' typologies is ultimately to support the individual\nso that the result will be an increase in self-esteem that pro-\nduces positive academic performance. He identifies five\nstages of cultural identity typologies.\nThe first stage is cultural psychological captivity. The\nindividuals possess internalized negative stereotypes and\nbeliefs about their cultural group. As a result, they express\nself-rejection and self-hatred. The second stage is cultural\nencapsulation. Individuals participate in limited interactions\nwith their cultural group. They may choose to isolate them-\nselves from their culture and community group. The third\nstage is cultural identity clarification. Individuals develop\npositive attitudes toward their cultural group. The fourth\nstage is biculturalism. Individuals develop a healthy sense of\ncultural identity and psychological characteristics that sup-\nport successful participation in their own cultural commu-\nnity, as well as in others. The final stage is multiculturalism.\nIndividuals who have developed a healthy sense of their own\ncultural identity are now empowered to participate in the\nBanks (2004) asserts that the five stages may not be lin-\near. There may be times when an individual may return to a\nstage that he or she had previously mastered. He ultimately\npromotes a multicultural curriculum in which African\nAmericans can see themselves positively portrayed and\nachieve academic success.\nSeveral important implications emerge from the asser-\n2004), as well as the empirical evidence from the literature.\nBoth agree that history and hegemony affect individual iden-\ntity development that may lead to a collective identity. Ogbu\nexplains that as involuntary minorities, African Americans\nhave made social resolutions that affect their identity to resist\nthe low-caste membership (i.e., changes in speech and lan-\nguage). The resistance to the hegemonic structure has\nresulted in identity fragmentation that is exhibited in Banks'\ntypologies.\nIn contrast, identity for Afro Caribbeans as voluntary\nminorities to the United States is reflected in their choice to\nenter and submit to the hegemonic system and structure.\nTheir decision to enter such systems is rooted in the belief\nthat inclusion will produce greater access to occupational\nand educational opportunities that will serve to benefit future\ngenerations (Mortimer & Bryce-Laporte, 1981). From\nBanks' typologies, Afro Caribbeans may be considered in\nStage 4, biculturalism. They participate in the culture of the\nUnited States while still maintaining their Caribbean culture\n(Waters, 1999). It is from this socio-cultural system and col-\nlective identity that their persistence in STEM education and\ncareers gains its potency.\nSignificance of the Study\nAs a result of slavery and colonization, there are differences\nin culture and identity formation for Afro Caribbeans and\nAfrican Americans with regard to work that affects their\naccess and inclusion to STEM careers (Waters, 1999).\nResearch has not unpacked the strategies of persistence of\nAfro Caribbean females in STEM. It is essential to be cogni-\nzant of their strategies to encourage all females of African\ndescent in their pursuance of STEM careers. The goal of this\nstudy is to expound on the cultural identity characteristics\nand strategies that will support STEM education training and\nsubsequent careers for underrepresented populations.\nMethod\nThis study is drawn from a larger qualitative case study. In\ncase study research, the issue is explored through one or\nmore cases within a bounded system (Creswell, 2007). The\ndata sources for a case study may include observations, inter-\nviews, or reports and documents (Creswell, 2007).\nThe selected qualitative approach is the most beneficial\nway to address my research question and exploration of the\nexperiences of how this group of Afro Caribbean women\nKing Miller 5\nfrom the country of Panama navigated the barriers of race\nand gender that often limit access to STEM careers. Using a\ncase study approach allowed for the exploration of the lived\nexperiences of this particular group of Afro Caribbean\nwomen. My goal was to better understand the strategies that\nenabled these women to persist in their STEM training and\nparticipate in their STEM career. The selected case study\napproach affords the opportunity to focus on this small\ngroup, to thickly describe their reported strategies, and to see\nwhat concepts and theories emerge from the data.\nParticipants\nFive Afro Caribbean women from Panama were selected\nfor the study. Panamanian women were selected because of\nthe historical relationship their families had with White\nAmericans in the building of the Panama Canal. New York\nCity was selected because it is a major city of entry for all\nimmigrants in general and Afro Caribbeans in particular\n(Advincula, 2007). It is one of the cities with the largest\nAfro Caribbean populations (McCabe, 2011). Participants\nwere recruited from members in the Afro Caribbean com-\nmunity through churches, schools, and neighborhood hos-\npitals. A purposive sample (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007;\nbest meet the needs of this research. All participants were\nfrom a specific immigrant population representing a spe-\ncific community in the United States with information and\nstrategies to amass an understanding of the research ques-\ntion that would lead to a grounded theory design analysis\n(Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Three selection criteria for the\npurposive sample were used.\nThe first criterion was that the women had to be currently\nor previously employed in a STEM career. STEM careers\nwere defined by the STEM Occupation Classification list of\nthe NSF to include science teachers, nurses, and psycholo-\ngists (Landivar, 2013). The second criterion for selection\nwas the participants had to verify that their parents or grand-\nparents had voluntarily immigrated to Panama from varying\nCaribbean islands to work on the Panama Canal building\nproject with the American government.\nEach of the study participants had voluntarily migrated to\nparticipants were bilingual speaking both English and\nSpanish, and were born in the Central American country of\nPanama. They lived either in Colon, the port city of entry for\nCaribbeans, or in Panama City. Participants selected their\nown pseudonyms for the study as shown in Table 1.\nData Sources\nInterviews.In qualitative research, knowledge is produced\nthrough social interactions (Kvale & Brinkmann, 2009). In\nthis process, an interview is \"an interchange of views\nbetween two persons conversing about a common theme\"\n(Kvale, 1996, p. 44). Interviews were conducted individually\nin a location agreed on by the researcher and participant. The\ninterviews were at their homes, restaurants, or work places.\nThere were over 50 open-ended interview and probing ques-\ntions used throughout the individual interviews. The inter-\nviews lasted 5 to 8 hr over 3 days. The questions focused on\n(a) the socio-cultural elements of Afro Caribbean identity,\n(b) strategies and skills from their culture that enabled them\nto negotiate the barriers in STEM education and careers, (c)\nstrategies and skills from their experiences that can be used\nto inform work with other females of African descent.\nDemographic survey. The survey was emailed to those partici-\npants who were presently employed; it was given in person\nto those who were retired and were traveling between the\nUnited States and Panama at the time of the inquiry. The pro-\ntocol for writing this survey was taken from several sources.\nI drew on LeCompte and Preissle's (1993) description of a\nconfirmation survey, which uses structured questions to\ngather key information. The questions were closed and quan-\ntifiable (Marshall & Rossman, 1989). The survey also\nincluded nominal questions about age, school attendance,\nand college major and degree (LeCompte & Preissle, 1993).\nTable 1 presents this information.\nField notes and observations. I used an ethnographic approach\nto data collection through fieldnotes, which included jottings,\nheadnotes, and memos (Emerson, Fretz, & Shaw, 1995;\nTable 1.

For participants who were\npresently employed, I visited their work sites and observed\nthem in situ. I recorded over 8 hr of observations per partici-\npant. I typed memo journals after each interaction with each\nparticipant, which included the date, the participant pseud-\nonym as per the Institutional Review Board, and a brief over-\nview of the interaction from my perspective as the researcher\nData Analysis\nData were triangulated using open-ended interview ques-\ntions, fieldnotes and observations, the qualitative survey, and\ndocuments (Emerson et al., 1995; Kvale & Brinkmann,\n& Strauss, 1973). The documents were derived from public\nsources. It consisted of recognitions and awards attesting to\nthe participants'level of work-related success. All interviews\nwere personally transcribed and coded by the researcher\n& Corbin, 1990). The preferred language of the participants\nwas respected, and translations are provided where necessary\nThe study employed a grounded theory approach, and the\nprocedures and protocol for such a design (Strauss & Corbin,\n1990). Data analysis began from the time of initial collection\nor interviews, and categories were developed from constant\ncomparisons derived from the theoretical memos written by\nthe researcher. Categories were formulated based on emerging\nthemes resulting from open coding, axial and selective coding\n(Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Constant comparisons included\ncomparing incidences, stories, and descriptions that were\ngrouped and then structured into the model for clarity (Lincoln\n& Guba, 1985). Furthermore, I contacted all participants for\nmember checking to ensure that they were in agreement with\nResearch Findings\nThe analysis of the emergent themes contributed to the\nSTEM Attainment Model (SAM; see Figure 1) as a graphic\nrepresentation of the data. The SAM model emerged from\nevidence of the strategies that helped them navigate race and\ngender barriers to enter their STEM career. The model con-\nsists of five levels. The discussion, which follows, begins\nwith the base of the model and progresses upward. There is a\nhierarchical structure, with the base having the foundational\nelements that are needed for the upper levels to build on.\nStrong Family-of-Origin and Male Presence\nUnderstading the influence each family had in the partici-\npats' career choices was a concern of the study. This proved\ntobe a major factor for the women and forms the base of the\nSM model. What emerged from their narratives were con-\ntinuous references to family members who supported and\nmade intentional investments in their lives. Family members\nwere concerned about their positive development and sup-\nported their hopes and dreams. However, this circumstance\ndid not mean that the parents or caretakers were educated\n(Afia's grandmother was illiterate), or had all the social and\nfinancial means needed to support the women. Nevertheless,\nthey used what cultural and social assets (i.e., capital) they\nhad to invest in the lives of these women.\nThere was great interaction with family members in the\nhome and with extended family. Andrea reported that \"Colon\nonly had 16 streets . . . everybody knew each other.\" This\nsmall community provided parameters for the women. They\nknew that others were watching and would report to their\nfamilies. The influence of family will be reflected in subse-\nquent narratives.\nFour of the five participants described their families' as\n\"poor.\" However, in discussing this notion of poverty, the\nwomen agreed that it was relative to the situation.\nWe were poor, but we never saw ourselves as poor, we ate every\nday, nobody ever came and cut off our lights, nobody ever came\nand removed a piece of our furniture because it wasn't paid for.\n(Andrea)\n\"Poor\" implied the families lacked economic resources, and\neducational attainment was made through financial sacrifices\nby the families.\nIn concert with these findings, the women all identified\nand valued the presence of a male authority figure in their\nhome. For example, Andrea in speaking about her self-confi-\ndence credits her father saying, \"My father was a very strong\nbeliever in himself.\" The males in the household also appar-\nently interacted with their daughters and transferred values\nand principles to them. Dorcas offered in this regard, \"We\nFigure 1. STEM attainment model.\nNote. STEM = science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\nKing Miller 7\nalways had a book shelf . . . my father always brought books\nhome.\" Andrea also shared that her father did not allow his\ndaughters to read romance novels or comics but only litera-\nture from reputable writers. By guiding the printed reading\nmaterial their daughters were exposed to, these fathers influ-\nenced their learning outcomes.\nThese fathers also helped with the process of education.\nNubia shared that at noon when her father arrived home for\nhis lunch, each child would have to share their lessons from\nschool (the children also came home for lunch). She remem-\nbered, \"If we were having a problem we told him . . . he said,\nOK, if I don't have an answer by tonight, I will bring some-\nbody that has the answer.\" Again, all participants lived with\na male in the home whether he was their father or grandfather\nor both. In cases where they were from single-parent moth-\ners, these mothers lived in their parents' home with their\nchild, thus exposing the child to the grandfather/father.\nStrong Cultural Identity\nStrength in their cultural identity was a second factor and is\nthe second level in SAM. This emerged as the second tier\nbecause it stems from the values transmitted from the family\nof origin. All the women affirmed that they identified them-\nselves primarily by phenotype or ethnic markers (i.e., Black,\nBlack Panamanian, Black Hispanic, Jamaican Panamanian,\nand African American [as in from the Americas]).\nThe term Black referred only to their skin color. Fusia\nstates that as a Hispanic Panamanian, \"Black has to do with\nthe color of my skin . . . but my culture will be one influenced\nby the Spanish culture, heritage and beliefs.\" Afia self-iden-\ntified as Black because, \"it's the first thing people see is this\"\n(she points to her arm indicating the skin color).\nThe women described instances when the term Black was\nseen as exclusively for African American to the exclusion of\nthemselves. Dorcas's explained that she corrected her\nHispanic students when they tried to tell her that she was not\nBlack, meaning she was not African American because she\nspoke Spanish and was from Central America. Sometimes\nthey too were of African descent but did not consider them-\nselves Black. The term Black, in their minds, was reserved\nfor African Americans. She remembered, \"They would say,\n`pero maestra [but teacher], you are not Black.' I tell them,\n`No, you are Black too.'\"\nThis problem was exacerbated when she found that even\nthe White teachers at the school where she taught biology\nidentified her as other than Black. They reserved the term\nBlack for African Americans only.\nThey would tell me, \"You are different\" . . . I would say, \"What\nare you talking about?\" . . . \"Different from American Blacks\" .\n. . I said, \"No, Black is Black no matter what\" . . . They would\nsay, \"You have an accent\" . . . I said, \"You do too . . . why do you\ncriticize the ones that came from the South with their accent?\nTheir accent is like the children's [African American students']\naccent.\" (Dorcas)\nDorcas found that not only Black immigrants but also White\nAmericans reserved the term Black for African Americans,\nwhile categorizing Black immigrants by their ethnicity (i.e.,\nJamaican, West Indian, and African). Afia explained that this\nstrategytoseparateBlackimmigrantsfromAfricanAmericans\nis used as a tactic to divide those of African descent.\nI see \"African American\" in the broader sense . . . when the cop\nstops you he's not identifying your accent, but your race. I think\nthe business of saying, \"Those people from America\" is a divide\nand conquer strategy because ultimately you are Black. (Afia)\nThe women in the study were taught about the founding\nBlack leaders such as Marcus Garvey (Jamaican) and the\nPan-African movement (Crawford, 2004), as well as Stokely\nCarmichael's (Trinidadian) Black Power Movement\n(Carmichael, 1971). Afia describes her family by saying,\n\"Those people were all Garveyites . . . those people who\nwere conscious.\" Garvey made a tremendous impact on the\nCaribbean community. Similarly, Dorcas in response to the\nJewish teachers attempting to create a wedge between her\nand her African American colleagues responded with a quote\nfrom Carmichael: \"Black is Black no matter what.\"\nThe collective identity of these Afro Caribbean women\nseemed to be grounded in cultural roots that was shaped in a\nBlack identity constructed by other Blacks and not by mem-\nbers of the dominant group.\nBanks (2004) explains the importance of this by stating\nthat interaction with Whites in American society has pro-\nduced levels of dysfunction in the African American com-\nmunity resulting in some individuals being in a state of\npsychological captivity. Conversely, for Afro Caribbeans,\ntheir apparent inoculation against some of the psychological\ndysfunction may be attributed to the fact that they are histori-\ncally from islands or communities in which they were the\nmajority. Nubia, for example, recognized that there was a\npsychological difference between herself and her African\nAmerican counterpart. African American women had sur-\nvived a social system that used fear to keep Blacks in their\ncaste through \"images of lynchings\" and \"`Whites only'\nsigns,\" thus maintaining the hegemonic structures of caste\nand class.\nI wasn't raised in the U.S.; I wasn't raised under a Jim Crow\nexperience. I don't have those images in my head . . . That's not\npart of my psyche. I think I was telling him [referring to her\nhusband], I was recounting an issue that I had with a policeman\nin Brooklyn, New York. I refused to move. And he told me that\nI had to move, and I told him no, I was not moving . . . and there\nwere quite a lot of people around me . . . and I told him that he\nneeded to move because he was on the wrong side of the steps .\n. . He said, \"I'm a police officer.\" And I said, \"I'm not moving\"\n. . . My husband said, \"No other Black person in America would\nhave done that\" . . . He said, \"You just don't do that, you don't\nbuck the system\" . . . I did not see him [the police officer] as\n8 SAGE Open\nWhite versus Black, I saw him as violating a basic rule, courtesy.\n(Nubia)\nThe absence of the negative mental images and fears instilled\nby White authorities allowed Nubia to question the officer\nwho happened to be violating the rules of the subway. She\nwas confident enough to challenge his discourteous behavior\nin spite of his skin color and position.\nAndrea also challenged the belief of her sister who was\ncomplaining that \"people made her feel less than.\" She\noffered, \"`They make' . . . and I come away with what I\nKNOW and I BELIEVE and if I believe what `they' say. It's\nnot, `they made me.' It's because I believed it.\" This is a\npowerful statement about her self-identity and self-affirma-\ntion. Her response further reflects the choice she made in\nnegating the hegemonic structures that attempt to define and\nlimit her racial membership.\nTransferable Values, Strategies, and Skills\nTransferable values and strategies was the next level of\nSTEM Attainment that emerged from the data. This was\nderived during the analysis by constantly comparing the sto-\nries and the words used to describe the values and the skills\ndeemed important to the women. By the term transferable\nvalues, I mean values or skills that were conveyed verbally\nand nonverbally by the family and Caribbean community.\nFour examples were identified:\nThe first value was commitment to education. All of the\nwomen shared that education was valued and its importance\ninstilled by their families. Andrea and Nubia mentioned that\nthey routinely discussed their daily lessons with their parents\nwho were actively involved in the learning process. Dorcas\nalso recounted that as a child, she would attempt to listen to\nher father and the eruditos [educated men]. She recalled,\n\"They were talking about the war, Dubois, and different\nBlack Americans who were struggling.\" Her father and the\nmen gathered around the newspaper to discuss world affairs\nand specifically those that affected people ofAfrican descent.\nSecond, each of the participants had parents or grandpar-\nents who were determinants in their academic success.\nThat is, they worked to establish continuity between home\nand school values, linguistically and socioeconomically.\nFor example, Fusia's grandparents sent her to a school that\nhad the reputation for training females whose goal was to\nattend college. Nubia's mother and father both attended\nparent meetings regarding her academic progress. Because\nthere was no program available in Panama, Afia would be\nallowed to travel to the United States to earn a degree in\npsychology. All the women learned English for communi-\ncation in their home and community, and learned Spanish\nfor academic instruction and interactions outside of the\nCaribbean community.\nLiteracy was a third value. Being readers and supporting\nreading and literacy skills was inductively derived from the\nstories of the women. All of the participants' male caretakers\ndemonstrated the importance of literacy by either reading to\nthese women or procuring books for them to read.Apparently,\nthese books included substantive literature, as Andrea\nreported. All of the women shared that they saw the men and\nsome of the women in their homes reading. Literacy was\novertly communicated as a value. Nubia's grandparents were\ninstrumental in her reading in the home. She explained, \"I\nlearned English from my grandparents . . . they taught us to\nread and write English at home . . . you had to read the Bible.\"\nThe fourth notable value was using free time for informal\neducation and skill building. All of the women engaged in\nextra curricula activities including crocheting, sewing, play-\ning an instrument, and swimming. Afia indicated that her\nmother took her to the ballet although she did not have the\nextra income for such luxuries. She recalled, \"Some of the\nfamily members used to laugh when she took me to the bal-\nlet.\" These educational enrichment opportunities extended\nbeyond sports to skills that could be used to support them-\nselves. Andrea used her cosmetology skills to earn extra\nmoney to pay for college.\nThese middle-class values and awareness of interactions\nin a world that is influenced by the dominant White society\nmeant that these women learned the rules and behavior for\nCaribbean culture, but they also learned dominant culture\nrules, values, and behavior. These appeared to influence how\nthey behaved and dressed to affect their public image. For\nexample, for our interview at her home, Dorcas was dressed\nin business casual attire with dress shoes. She said it was\ninappropriate to wear \"pumps\" (gym shoes) for our meeting\nat her home. These standards regarding dress and appearance\nseemed to help build the overall self-confidence that seemed\nto exude from each participant.\nSelf-Confidence\nSelf-confidence is the next level of SAM. All of the partici-\npants noted the importance of believing in self as key to their\nreaching STEM membership. Fusia agreed stating that the\nnurturing received from her family served to \"build my self-\nesteem . . . .\" Nubia also added, \"I think that my mother and\nfather never discouraged me from accomplishing what I\nwanted to accomplish.\"\nPerhaps self-confidence was cultivated for these women\nin part because they were not constantly compared with\nWhites or any other dominant group. Their parents or grand-\nparents were from nations where they were the majority.\nThese women were able to enact significant self-determina-\ntion. Their personal success was measured by their percep-\ntions about how they were doing in the United States as\ncompared with the opportunities for advancement they\nwould have experienced in their country-of-origin (Bryce-\nHaving self-confidence and support of family was dem-\nonstrated by Fusia in her response to her school counselor.\nKing Miller 9\nThe counselor tried to encourage her to become a nurse\ninstead of a doctor. Although she followed his advice and\ntook the entry exam for nursing school, she also took the\nexam for the school of podiatry where she was accepted. She\ndid not want to be limited to the gender stereotype for women\nin STEM careers.\nHard Work and Perseverance Leads to\nOpportunity\nThe next two levels of SAM are valuations of hard work and\nopportunity. Three of the five women interviewed stated that\nhard work and perseverance were the reasons for their suc-\ncess in STEM. Dorcas echoed the American work ethic by\nstating that hard work is a path to becoming \"Whatever you\nwant to be.\" Andrea seemed to agree with this but added that\npersistence is also important. She declared, \"Believe in your-\nself, set your goal and make sure everything that you do is\nsomething that is going to accomplish that goal.\"\nThese women came from households where all of the\nmales except one were entrepreneurs and had their own busi-\nnesses in Panama. They had observed their parents or grand-\nparents work. All the women caregivers in their households\nworked and contributed to the income of the family. Afia\naffirmed that this was an African value where women are\nexpected to contribute to the economic wellness of the fam-\nily. She recalled that this was also evidenced in Caribbean\nsocieties where men worked in the fields, but Caribbean\nwomen went to the marketplaces to sell the produce.\nIn this social structure, women's work is important and\ndistinct from the work of men. Even those who were retired\ncontinued to be involved through entrepreneurial endeavors\nor serving on committees both in the United State and in\nPanama. Andrea, in her work as wife, mother, and Senior\nVice President of New York City Health and Hospital\nCorporation explained, \". . . it almost killed me physically.\"\nAndrea became the first Quality Control Specialist for the\nhospital systems in New York City because she chose to pur-\nsue a certification program beyond her master's degree. By\nchallenging herself academically, Andrea had the credentials\nneeded when opportunities presented.\nSTEM Attainment\nSTEM attainment is the highest level of the SAM. The five\nparticipants clearly exemplified all the requisites necessary\nto reach this final stage. They were employed in or retired\nfrom STEM careers. Each participant reported that she had\nreceived encouragement from parents, grandparents, and the\ncommunity that instilled the self-confidence needed to pur-\nsue their STEM career.\nAll of the participants had the distinction of being the first\nperson of African descent to hold their respective positions.\nThis means that, daily, they were challenged with dispelling\nthe myths regarding intelligence and STEM inclusion for\nwomen of African descent. Nubia recounted a struggle with\nher White supervisor when she was the only Black nurse on\nthe day shift at her hospital. This verbal exchange reflected\nthe difficulties of fighting for inclusion:\nSo I am the invisible nurse . . . I was not raised to think that you\ndefine me, you don't define me . . . My father and mother raised\nme to know who I am and what I am capable of and it doesn't\nstart with you. (Nubia)\nEarlier in this altercation with her supervisor she had asserted,\n\"You do not define me, my parents define me.\" From Nubia's\nresponse, we glean that her identity was not determined by\nthe opinions of her White co-workers. It was grounded in an\ninternal belief created by the many conversations and inter-\nactions with her family. Often being the first to break the\n\"color barrier\" means dispelling myths regarding Blacks. It\nalso can mean absorbing negative interactions while doing\nthe work with an excellence that is not required of others.\nSecond, for STEM attainment, the women noted the\nimportance of teachers and an educational system that\nbelieves in children of African descent. Afia exhorted,\n\"teachers need to know every pupil doesn't learn the same\nway.\" She further questions the over-inclusion of Black stu-\ndents in special education classes. Rather than embracing a\nbelief based on intellectual differences, Fusia adds that\n\"teachers should be a cheerleader who will mentor Black stu-\ndents and be a good source to . . . take them to the level to\nachieve that STEM profession.\" All of the women believed\nthat the educational system is responsible for the attrition\nrate of females of African descent in STEM education and\ncareers.\nDiscussion\nThe question for this study focused on how Afro Caribbean\nimmigrant women from Panama successfully navigated the\nbarriers through STEM education into their STEM career.\nFrom the analysis, what emerged from the narratives of the\nwomen was a graphic model reflecting the sources that led\nto their ability to obviate the barriers due to race and gen-\nder. The model began simply as an analytical tool to discuss\nthe data. However, after reflection, what surfaced were\nstrategies and skills that did not develop in isolation. Thus,\nthe need for a closer analysis of the SAM model was\nimperative.\nSTEM Access: First Things First\nAt the foundation of the SAM model is the importance of\nfamily and a male presence in the home or life of females.\nThe male presence is important for academic encouragement\nand support for daughters (Goossen, 2009). When compar-\ning low-income boys and girls living in a home with their\nfathers or father figure to low-income boys and girls living\nwith mothers only, the group that lived with their father or\nfatherfiguresscoredhigheronstandardizedtests(Vandamme,\nMexican American families, education included the trans-\nmission of family values, morals, and the skills to live in\nsociety. There is much research stating that access to STEM\nrequires strong support from parents, teachers, and access to\nSTEM educational programs (Carlone & Johnson, 2007;\nHowever, this study finds that in addition to these factors,\nthere seems to be further elements at work for Afro\nCaribbeans. These include a cultural identity that is defined\nby the members of its own community and not constructed\nby the dominant group. This cultural identity is reflected in\ntheir collective identity (Ogbu, 2008). When there is constant\ncomparison to the dominant group, the Black\u00adWhite binary\nis strengthened, and Whites are used as the measuring rod for\nsuccess (Wiggan, 2007). This limits the formation of a col-\nlective identity derived from the members of ones' own\ngroup.\nThe next distinguishing element is the presence of cul-\ntural values that include education and its supplemental\nstructures (i.e., literacy, positioning for success skill build-\ning). It became evident through these narratives that the par-\nents and guardians' intentional preparation (i.e., taking them\nto extra classes and lessons, strategically selecting the\nschools that will help in the accomplishment of their goals)\nis an integral component in their success. These values and\ncomponent structures served to build self-confidence so that\nthe women would work hard and take advantage of opportu-\nnities as they presented themselves.\nThe values and strategies from these families were similar\nto middle-class families. Middle-class parents were more\nlikely to be concerned with giving their children opportuni-\nties and exposures that would provide them with socio-eco-\nnomic advantages (Lareau, 2011). Their children are more\nlikely to engage in dance, music lessons, or sports (Lareau,\nmy participants demonstrated that although they did not have\nthe discretionary income to fully participate and provide all\nthat middle-class children may receive, they nevertheless\nattempted to provide their daughters with middle-class\nopportunities when they could. They taught them middle-\nclass cultural habits through their exposure to ballet pro-\ngrams, formal cultural events, and dances. They taught them\nthe dress and behaviors expected for these events. Through\nthis informal education, they taught them how to be comfort-\nable in these divergent settings as well as showing support\nfor the academic institutional formal training.\nDeveloping Self-Confidence for STEM Access\nParental support and encouragement are understood to be\nimportant aspects of fostering self-confidence, which is key\nto the success of females in STEM (Rayman & Brett, 1995;\nScott & Mallinckrodt, 2005). They managed to avoid a major\nhindrance for Blacks and females in the United States--spe-\ncifically accepting the belief that they were less intelligent\nand less able to succeed in math and science (Wortham,\n2006). In the United States, females of African descent, in\naddition to stereotype threats regarding race, also encounter\nboundaries based on gender. These threats rooted in gender\nbias send messages that females are less intelligent in math\nand science subjects than males (Johnson, 2007). This is\napparent when Fusia was being persuaded to be a nurse\nrather than a doctor. These threats to gender and race affect\nself-confidence and lead to cultural psychological captivity\nThe Afro Caribbean collective identity seemed to insulate\nthe women from the systemic preconception of stereotype\nthreats regarding intelligence. Instead, it fostered and sup-\nported their desires to excel in arenas that are often desig-\nnated for Whites only. When challenges arose academically,\nthey did not question their ability, but reported that they used\ntutors and sought help. This seems to reflect a growth rather\nthan gift-oriented notion of intelligence (Dweck, 2007).\nBeilock (2010) found that African American college students\nchose to study alone rather than be perceived as less intelli-\ngent by teachers and tutors. This belief system serves to\nerode self-confidence and increase STEM attrition among\nBlack students. Until cultural identity clarification is\nreached, individuals are stuck in a structure that accepts self-\nhatred and self-rejection (Banks, 2004).\nSTEM Open Doors\nManski's (1993) theory of endogenous effects states that\nindividuals in a community tend to reproduce what they wit-\nness from other members in the system. So as the women\nsaw hard work modeled, and women's work valued, they\nimitated this behavior. Waters (1999) found that Afro\nCaribbeans held differing views regarding work than their\nAfrican American co-workers. They felt that African\nAmericans often did not take advantage of available work\nand designated some jobs as beneath them. In contrast, Afro\nCaribbeans often will take menial positions. They do not per-\nceive these jobs as defining their sense of self. Rather, they\nare stepping stones to a better position. Afro Caribbeans are\nstereotyped as working several jobs and taking the ethic of\nhard work to an extreme. When African Americans were\ninterviewed about the work ethic of Afro Caribbeans, some\nagreed that they were more hard-working and ambitious\nof West Indians hard work certainly does play a role, as does\na reluctance to take public assistance\" (p. 97).\nThese studies support the supposition that there is a differ-\nence in work ethic and beliefs about work for Afro\nCaribbeans. One reason is minorities immigrate to a country\nto improve their economic position and gain access to better\neducation for their children (Mortimer & Bryce-Laporte,\n1981). A second reason is that Afro Caribbeans have been\nable to realize tangible benefits from their hard work (i.e.,\neconomic wealth, improved social status). This creates ideo-\nlogical differences; Afro Caribbeans have experienced a pay-\noff for their hard work and perseverance. In contrast, African\nAmericans have not always experienced the compensation\nfor their work or educational attainment (Rothstein, 2004).\nOgbu's (1978) theory of a collective identity is a relevant\nlens to consciously take note of Afro Caribbean immigrant\nbehavior in STEM. First, as a voluntary minority group, their\nchoice reflects a level of freedom and power. Second, their\nidentity is shaped based on their ability to garner power from\ntheir former colonizers. Their ability to effect changes in\ntheir social position reflects their sense of agency. However,\ntheir identity is rooted in family, community, and country of\norigin.\nCollins (2000) supports the assertions the women make\nfor self-identity. They are proud to be defined by ethnicity\nand that of those from their own community. Collins (2000)\nstates that, \"Self-definition speaks to the power dynamics\ninvolved in rejecting externally defined, controlling images\nof Black womanhood\" (p. 114). For collective identity to be\none that is reflective of the group, it must be formulated by\nthe members of the group and not by outsiders. This reso-\nnates Nubia's strong cry to her supervisor: \"You don't define\nme.\" She recognized that her self-definition came from her\nfamily, community, and country. Collins (2000) adds, \"Self\nis not defined as the increased autonomy gained by separat-\ning oneself from others. Instead, self is found in the context\nof family and community\" (p. 113). For those of African\ndescent, self-definition is couched in the context of the fam-\nily of origin and the ethnic heritage; members recognize and\naccept their connectivity to the group is the strength that is\nneeded to persist.\nBanks (2004) provides another lens to scrutinize the chal-\nlenges for African American females who aspire to STEM\nattainment. The hegemonic structure has adversely affected\ntheir level of self-confidence. Teachers and institutions must\nnot use comparisons nor explanations that reduce the success\nof varying social groups to hard work and persistence only.\nBanks (2004) demonstrates that socio-cultural factors have\naffected the self-efficacy of members of theAfricanAmerican\ncommunity.\nFrom a CRT lens, the psychological and emotional persis-\ntence that is needed by women of African descent is made\nclear. Their struggle is not in acquiring the academic skills\nalone but also in convincing others that they are worthy of an\nopportunity to acquire such skills. Students of African\ndescent need to feel that those who are guiding their aca-\ndemic progress believe in them and have high expectations\nof them (Cholewa, Amatea, West-Olatunji & Wright, 2012;\ndecision to defy her school counselor and pursue becoming a\ndoctor is evidence of this.\nYosso (2005) articulates six forms of cultural capital that\nis used by people of color that is often not recognized.\nEmbedded in each step of the STEM Model, we find these.\nFive of the six are highlighted. The first is Aspirational capi-\ntal, which is the hopes and dreams for the future instilled by\nthe family. Each family communicated that they believed\nand expected the women to succeed.\nThe second, Linguistic capital, is evident in that all the\nwomen were bilingual and saw it as a benefit to have this\nadditional skill. Next was Familial capital, which was\nobserved as the importance of family inclusive of extended\nfamily. Many of the women mentioned their grandparents\nand other relatives being a support to them. Social capital is\nthe emotional support needed to navigate through the hege-\nmonic structures that exist. Finally, Resistant capital was\nevidence by their ability to fight injustice. We see this through\nNubia and the police officer. Black immigrants are exposed\nto similar incidences of injustice as Native Born Blacks and\nmust fight to challenge the systemic structure.\nConclusion\nToo often, females in the United States are sent the message\nthat math and science are male fields of study. Females of\nAfrican descent are sent messages that math and science are\nnot attainable because of limited intelligence due to racial\nconstructs. Thus, there is an underrepresentation of women\nof African descent in STEM.\nHowever, the women in this study showed persistence\nthrough STEM education to participate in a STEM career.\nThey drew on a collective identity that was not prescribed by\nthe dominant culture. Their identity formulation gave them\nthe needed ability to invalidate the racialized restrictions\nimposed on their gender and race. The data supports the\nimportance of self-identification, values and strategies from\nfamily, as well as community to build self-confidence. From\ntheir narratives, all females ofAfrican descent can be encour-\naged in STEM education and careers.\nThe SAM Model served as a graphic organizational tool\nthat illustrated the resources needed by these women to navi-\ngate the barriers of race and gender. Further research is\nneeded to verify if the SAM Model can support the access of\nall females of African descent in their STEM attainment.\nThis study is limited in that it drew on a small purposive\nsample of Afro Caribbean Hispanic women. However, it\ndoes reveal evidence that identity formation developed from\nthe individuals' cultural group promotes self-confidence that\nis needed to persist in STEM.\nThere is a shortage of STEM workers for U.S. companies\nin general and a dire need to hire science and math teachers in\nthe 48 of 50 states (Westerlund, Radcliffe, Smith, Lemke, &\nWest, 2011). There is, therefore, an imperative to look at those\nfrom underrepresented groups who have gained access to\nSTEM and draw from their toolbox to open access to others.\nParents, teachers, and community members are encouraged to\nacknowledge their important roles and responsibilities in sup-\nporting females ofAfrican descent into STEM. These females,\nmuch like my participants, represent a multitude of untapped\npotential. In the voice of one of these women, ultimately, \"we\nare scientists, we are artists, we are creators\" (Nubia).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdvincula, A.
