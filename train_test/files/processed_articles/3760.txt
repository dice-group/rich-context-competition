In addition, qualitative research\ncan involve a variety of data collection methods such as\nstructured or semistructured interviews, focus groups, par-\nticipant observation, nonparticipant observation, and content\nanalysis. Paradigmatic differences influence researchers'\napproaches to qualitative research and also may be reflected\nin how researchers choose to present their findings.\nInterpretive frameworks and philosophy in qualitative\nresearch recognize human experience as contextual within a\nsocial time and place, and inseparable from the historical-\npersonal lens of the researcher(s) (Creswell, 2007). As such,\nthe positionality and subjectivity of the researcher(s) and the\nparticipants simultaneously shape the epistemological pro-\ncess, sometimes obfuscating the notion of voice in the pre-\nsentation of the data and results. This article describes our\ncreative process as we grappled with the representation of\nvoice in presenting our qualitative research results.\nThe applicability and impact of qualitative research\nwithin the scientific community and in a greater social con-\ntext is dependent on effective dissemination of the findings.\nKnowledge sharing is an integral component of the research\nprocess; without it, the potentiality of the research findings\nto effect change or benefit others is less probable.\nFurthermore, the scientific community generally purports\nthat researchers have an ethical obligation to disseminate\ntheir research to appropriate audiences (Corbin & Strauss,\n2008). As such, researchers must envisage the optimal pro-\ncesses and techniques for translating data into understand-\nable, consumable modes of representation for audiences to\ndigest. The ability to effectively communicate complex ideas\nis critical to facilitate comprehension and eventual utility of\nthe research findings or translation into practice. Researchers\nshould strive to demonstrate how the data are meaningful,\nappeal to various audiences, and engage stakeholders in the\nrelevance of the research.\nQualitative researchers face distinct challenges in synthe-\nsizing and publishing their work. Unlike quantitative\nresearch, qualitative research often relies on dense tran-\nscribed text; these \"mountains of words\" do not lend them-\nselves to the space limitations of academic journals or\ncondensed visual elements such as summary charts, tables,\n1University of South Florida, Tampa, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRasheeta Chandler, College of Nursing, University of South Florida, 12901\nEmail: rchandle@health.usf.edu\nListening to Voices and Visualizing Data\nin Qualitative Research: Hypermodal\nDissemination Possibilities\nRasheeta Chandler1, Erica Anstey1, and Henry Ross1\n Keywords\nhypermodal dissemination, qualitative research methodology, infographics, EARR model, audio mapping, scientific qualitative\nposter presentations\n2 SAGE Open\nor graphs (Johnson, Dunlap, & Benoit, 2010). To maintain\nthe depth and richness of the findings and to demonstrate the\nquality of the data, the presentation of qualitative results\noften requires detailed contextual and methodological\ndescription. The use of quotations, presented as text, serve to\nexemplify the researchers' interpretation of the data as find-\nings. In today's fast-paced world, presenting qualitative\nresearch succinctly and clearly is becoming more important\nand necessary than ever and requires new approaches and\nmodalities beyond text. In this article, we emphasize the\nimportance of voice in qualitative research and consider new\npossibilities of audio-enhanced dissemination. We also\nimagine a hypermodal space where sound is integrated with\ninnovative data visualization elements.\nVoice: Two Sides of the Same Coin\nMost modern qualitative researchers subscribe to postposi-\ntivist philosophies such as constructivist or postmodern phil-\nosophical approaches to research (Creswell, 2007; Gilgun,\n2005). Qualitative researchers consider how to best represent\nthe voices of their participants while acknowledging their\nown position in the epistemological process. The importance\nof narrative voice in qualitative research dissemination is\nevident in the author's decision to write in first person or\nthird person. First person case acknowledges the researcher's\npositionality and role in the process, and ideally minimizes\nthe privileging of a single \"objective\" voice that silences the\nvoice of others. Third person case is a more traditional\napproach in the hard sciences and is intended to express a\nsense of epistemological objectivity and distance the\nresearcher from the participants. Feminist and postmodern\nHooks, 1990) have long advocated for scientists and\nresearchers to identify and reveal their particular locations,\nor \"standpoints\" in knowledge formation. These \"situated\nknowledges\" challenge the traditional scientific relativism\nthat often drives quantitative biomedical research by offering\nthe possibility of generating new approaches from the merg-\ning of multiple perspectives. Gilgun (2005) wrote, \"many\ncontemporary researchers believe that the materials research-\ners generate are co-constructions, representations of interac-\ntive processes between researchers and researched\" (p. 258).\nFurthermore, she wrote, \"The use of the first person and of\ndirect quotes is a way of acknowledging that the voices of\nresearchers and those whom we research are not the same yet\nare interconnected\" (p. 259). This interpretive qualitative\napproach also offers a sense of transparency to the reader.\nThe emphasis and honoring of the participants' own\nwords as generative of meaning and knowledge is also criti-\ncally important to include in writing and presenting qualita-\ntive research (the other side of the coin), yet it is rare to hear\nthe actual voices of the research participants in dissemina-\ntion efforts. Decisions about the representation of voice raise\nquestions about the subjectivity of the \"knower\" and the pro-\ncess of sharing research findings. Negotiating the voice of\nthe researcher with the voice of the participant in the dis-\nsemination process is an important part of qualitative\nresearch. Lincoln, Lynham, and Guba (2011) explained,\n\"Today . . . voice can mean not only having a real researcher--\nand a researcher's voice--in the text, but also letting research\nparticipants speak for themselves\" (p. 123). Although the\nintention is to simultaneously blend the voice of the partici-\npants with that of the researcher, inevitably, the representa-\ntions of voice in dissemination efforts are reflective of the\npositionality of the researcher, who ultimately has the power\nto make choices about what to include or not. Participatory\naction research offers perhaps a more egalitarian possibility\nbut is not without its challenges as well.\nToday, qualitative researchers are able to capture the\nvoices of participants during data collection through record-\ning technology such as tape recorders and, more recently,\nwith digital voice recorders and mobile phones. Researchers\noften use audio and/or visual recording devices with com-\nmon qualitative methods such as interviews, direct observa-\ntion and participant observation, focus groups, and case\nstudies. This type of audio recording technology facilitates\nthe analytic process by enabling verbatim transcription of the\nverbal content and nonverbal elements into text and main-\ntains the integrity of the data so that the researcher may\nrepeatedly listen to the nuances of the vocal expression.\nAlthough the use of audio, video, and other visual meth-\nods have become common in data collection procedures,\ninnovation continues to broaden the availability of new\napproaches to qualitative research. For example, PhotoVoice\nintegrates technology in an effort to create a space in which\nparticipants' perspectives, particularly marginalized groups,\ncan be expressed (Catalani & Minkler, 2010). Computer\nassisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) can\naccommodate audio and video files, which has transformed\ndata analysis. However, the inclusion of visual and audio ele-\nments in dissemination efforts remains relatively untapped.\nThe journal, Sociological Research Online, does support mul-\ntimodal elements and has published articles that include pho-\ntos and video that can be viewed by the \"reader\"; however,\nthe editors note that despite the possibility of presenting\nresearch in innovative ways, authors do not take advantage of\nthese possibilities frequently (Coomber & Letherby, 2012).\nWe are interested in the potential for technological advance-\nments and innovations in data representation and presentation\nto enhance qualitative research dissemination and the learn-\ning experience. We imagine that hypermodal dissemination\nefforts will integrate multiple and various modalities of com-\nmunication and rely on thoughtful design and execution.\nThe Enhancing Audio Recorded\nResearch (EARR) Model\nWe developed the EARR model (Figure 1; Chandler, Anstey,\n& Munro, et al., 2013) while working to integrate audio into\na poster presentation of research findings from a study\ndesigned to identify the HIV prevention needs of Black\nChandler et al. 3\ncollege women. During poster design, we struggled with\nhow to retain the emphasis and meaning of the words spoken\nby our participants during the focus groups but which seemed\nto dissipate on paper. For example, complex emotions about\nrelationships with their parents, feelings of stigma, and gen-\nerational attitudes about sex and communicating with part-\nners were evidenced through the cadence of speech and\nexpression shared. Feeling compelled to restore the richness\nof these women's words, we explored possibilities for\nenabling our audience to experience the voices of our partici-\npants as we did during the focus group sessions.\nThe impetus for the development of the EARR model was\nto more fully honor the voices of our research participants by\nenabling our audiences to experience the power of the data\nthrough listening to it with their own ears. Coupled with our\ninterpretations of the data, analysis, and conclusions as\nresearchers, the ability to experience the raw data in the form\nof audio has the potentiality to engage the audience with\nanother dimension of the research. Although we typically\ninclude quotes from participants on posters or in oral presen-\ntations, we felt as though our findings would be better\nexpressed by the exact words, inflection, and intonations of\nour participants. We applied the contextual model of learning\nas a framework to contextualize the process of disseminating\nresearch within the learning environment intended by the\nprofessional scientific conference setting (Chandler, Anstey,\nof the EARR model emerged as we delved into the history of\nmuseum informatics, which has evolved from basic identify-\ning labels to modern-day interactive audiovisual technolo-\ngies that are intended to engage the visitor more wholly in\nthe museum experience (Chandler, Anstey, & Munro, et al.,\nTallon & Walker, 2008). The EARR model illustrates the\npossibilities of integrating multisensory modalities into qual-\nitative research dissemination as generative of new semiotic\npossibilities. King (2008) proposed that the human brain has\nevolved to develop, learn, and operate optimally in multisen-\nsory environments. More specifically, King suggests that the\nvisual and auditory systems frequently work together to\nstimulate cognition. The EARR model facilitates a multisen-\nsory learning approach that pushes the boundaries of tradi-\ntional research dissemination and invites new opportunities\nfor critical analysis. A more detailed explanation of the his-\ntory of museum informatics, ethical issues, and a theoretical\napproach specific to the proposed hypermodal medium as it\nFigure 1. Experiencing audio recorded research model (EARR model).\n4 SAGE Open\nrelates to qualitative dissemination, and the development of\nthe EARR model, is published elsewhere (Chandler, Anstey,\nThe qualitative HIV prevention study that informed the\nEARR model was approved by the study site's institutional\nreview board. We obtained consent/authorization from each\nparticipant, which permitted audio recording of focus group\nsessions, transcription of the digital media into text format,\nand clipping (90 s or less) of available audio files for use in\ndissemination of the findings.\nNot all research is well suited to the inclusion of audio\ndata in the dissemination of research findings, particularly\nwhen the potential for voice recognition to remove anonym-\nity could be harmful to the participants. However, several\nresearchers have demonstrated the potentiality of removing\nanonymity to empower or enfranchise participants who may\nbe marginalized, especially if there is an iterative, active role\nfor the participant in the dissemination decisions and process\nexample, Fahmy and Pemberton (2012) described their use\nof video throughout the research process to empower mar-\nginalized groups and give them \"voice\" \"within wider public\ndebates and policy development.\" They suggested that\nVisual methods offer also one important means of overcoming\nthe objectification of research subjects as disembodied textual\nand numeric data within the interpretation and subsequent\ndissemination of findings. The visual representation of subjects'\nperspectives within their natural setting can provide for more\nholistic interpretations thereby enhancing the ecological validity\nof findings.\nWe contend that the inclusion of audio in dissemination of\nthe findings has the potential to similarly enhance the valid-\nity of findings by respecting the identity of the participants\nand offering the audience additional insight into the interpre-\ntive, analytic process.\nIncorporating an audio component to qualitative research\ndissemination has the potential to offer audiences a unique\nway to more fully engage with the data and reflect on the\ninterpretations and analytic process of the researcher. In\napplying the EARR model in a poster presentation (see\nFigure 2), we were able to allow conference-goers the oppor-\ntunity to listen to the voices of our participants. The steps of\nthe EARR model in our pilot test were as follows:\n1. We selected audio clips from our digitally recorded\ndata files that best represented the thematic findings\nin a focus group study about the information, motiva-\ntion, and behavioral skills (IMB) HIV prevention\nneeds of Black college women attending two differ-\nent universities in Florida.\n2. We uploaded the audio clips into the Guide-by-Cell\nweb-based software program. The audio files were\nthen accessible via dial-by-number or quick response\n(QR) code. We printed the phone number and the QR\ncode on the poster.\n3. As conference attendees viewed our poster, we\nencouraged them to use their mobile devices to call\nthe number or scan the QR code to listen to audio\nclips of our participants that represented particular\nthemes. We also provided over-the-ear headphones to\nassist with hearing these clips in a loud conference\nenvironment.\n4. We also encouraged our audience to respond to a poll\nabout this audio-enhanced experience, which was\nalso possible through the audio guide program (by\ncalling or by QR code). Finally, we encouraged our\naudience to respond to the research and the audio-\nenhanced aspect of the presentation through record-\ning their own perspectives.\nOur initial experience suggests that implementation of the\nEARR model enabled a deeper expression of the findings by\nrevealing voice inflection, tone, and emotion that are often dif-\nficult to communicate through traditional dissemination chan-\nnels. Furthermore, when audiences receive information in this\nway, they enter into the hermeneutic circle of interpretation\nalongside the researchers and the research participants.\nQualitative Data Visualization\nIn considering the integration of additional modalities to fur-\nther push the boundaries of qualitative research dissemina-\ntion, we also began to explore various methods of data\nvisualization techniques. We typically think about data visu-\nalization in the context of quantitative (numerical) data that\nmay be represented through a variety of visual options such\nas bar charts, graphs, scatterplots, tables, and pie charts,\namong others. These visual options serve to synthesize the\nfindings in an easily interpretable manner. Data visualization\nof qualitative research has received minimal attention thus\nthe first to describe the importance of some visual data dis-\nplay methods (such as matrices and network displays) in\nqualitative research dissemination. More recently, represent-\ning qualitative data visually has received more attention as\nCAQDAS and other tools have facilitated this possibility.\nFor example, tables and matrices, network mapping, word\nclouds, and word trees have become more common in quali-\ntative dissemination efforts (Henderson & Segal, 2013;\nof a device called \"the Spectrum\" to visually display qualita-\ntive information. This method is useful for displaying patterns\nin the data visually, but relies on the use of symbols or codes\nto represent the data and does not incorporate the words of\nparticipants. Verdinelli and Scagnoli (2013) studied the types\nof visual displays of qualitative data in published articles\nfrom three esteemed qualitative research journals across 3\nyears. Most common were matrices, networks, flowcharts,\nChandler et al. 5\nFigure 2. Poster presentation demonstrating EARR model concepts.\nNote. EARR = Enhancing Audio Recorded Research.\n6 SAGE Open\nboxed displays, and modified Venn diagrams, followed by\ntaxonomies, ladders, metaphorical visual displays, and deci-\nsion tree modeling. These analytic display methods are use-\nful for summarizing emerging theories from the data and\nprimary thematic results.\nAlthough these traditional methods of visualization are\nimportant for systematically displaying research findings,\nthey typically exclude the voices of participants and may\nlack visual dynamism of the data. Our project then is to bal-\nance the need for structural methods designed to explain the\nresearch with the integral subtleties and emotive elements\nthat are characteristic of some qualitative studies. Interactive\ndata visualization techniques could be combined with other\nmodalities to present a complex story in a dynamic and trans-\nparent way. According to Henderson, data visualization can\nbe defined broadly as\n\"communicating ideas or data using diagrams, images, graphs,\nmaps, or some other kind of visual model with the goal/intention\nof increasing understanding.\" And that last piece is important--\nthe visualization has to be something that increases\nunderstanding, insight, or something else besides just being\nQualitative researchers should begin to explore the ways\nthat we can present data such that the information is pre-\nsented visually, yet the point is synthesized clearly and suc-\ncinctly, but also honoring of the participants' own voices.\nInfographics, for example, have become a popular 21st-\ncentury trend used to display quantitative data. An info-\ngraphic is a visual display of information that is presented in\na way that communicates a compelling story about data.\nAccording to Lankow (2012), \"Infographics provide a for-\nmat that utilizes engaging visuals that not only appeal to an\naudience hungry for information, but also aid in the compre-\nhension and retention of that material\" (p. 12). In his book,\nLankow defined \"data\" to be \"quantifiable information\" that\nis typically numerical. He outlined three elements of effec-\ntive verbal/visual methods of communication:\n1. Appeal: Communication should engage a voluntary\naudience.\n2. Comprehension: Communication should effectively\nprovide knowledge that enables a clear understand-\ning of the information.\n3. Retention: Communication should impart memora-\nble knowledge.\nHowever, because infographics are also about storytelling,\nthey may lend themselves to qualitative data presentation.\nInfographics also have varying levels of complexity that can\nserve different needs. Krum (2014) outlined six different lev-\nels of infographics in order of increasing complexity: static,\nzooming, clicking, animated, video, and interactive, inspiring\nus to imagine endless exciting possibilities for disseminating\nqualitative research.\nIf a picture is worth a thousand words, what may emerge\nwhen we display a picture, juxtaposed with audio? Data visu-\nalization (such as infographics) plus audio could appeal to\nmultiple types of learning modalities (linguistic and nonlin-\nguistic) and ultimately enhance learning and understanding.\nWe have been playing with different possibilities of blending\nvisual and audio elements together in disseminating qualita-\ntive research. In the spirit of hypermodal exploration, we share\nour fledgling example (Figure 3) of our research findings.\nOur intention in designing this \"qualitative infographic\"\nwas to explore how we might present a succinct synthesis of\nthematic findings while honoring the voices of our partici-\npants in an integrated way. The visual elements with captions\ndisplay the main themes that were important in this study and\nthe corresponding audio map enables the audience to listen\nto a summary of the findings and the words of the partici-\npants. The opportunity for active engagement with the data\nmay motivate the audience to reflect on the nuances of mean-\ning expressed by the participants and synthesized by the\nresearchers, enhancing their learning experience. Pink and\nMackley (2012) described the inclusion of video in present-\ning their research as a way \"to offer an opportunity for view-\ners to develop a sensory embodied engagement with the\nmaterials and, as such, to use such familiarities and discrep-\nancies as routes to emplaced knowing, imagining and forms\nof understanding.\"(p. 12) Similarly, as this project develops,\nwe aim to encourage \"readers\" to enter a multimodal context\nwhere you may engage with the research more wholly,\ninvoking iterative, situated processes and leading to the\ncoconstruction of meaning.\nThroughout this project, we have been interested in\nexploring the possibilities of integrating audio technology\nand data visualization into qualitative research dissemination\nprojects. The use of audio clips and data visualization in\nposter and oral presentations, as well as embedded within\nwritten manuscripts plays with the interstices between the\nresearch participants and the observer. What new knowledge\nis gained when we access and privilege the voices of research\nparticipants juxtaposed with text and visual elements? What\nnew possibilities will emerge when the voices of our partici-\npants become liminal? Specifically, as \"readers\" of this arti-\ncle, how can you enter into the hypermodal space with us and\nbecome yet another modality in the epistemological process,\nthus adding a layer of complexity to the semiotics of this\nproject through coconstruction.\nIn this \"article,\" we encourage you (the reader/listener) to\nactively engage with the audio map we have developed in the\nexample above to experience the application of audio tech-\nnology and listen to the voices that constitute data. We hope\nyou will also take the opportunity to join the conversation\nabout the use of this technology, thus entering into our her-\nmeneutic circle and actively contributing to the exploration\nChandler et al. 7\nand evolution of hypermodal spaces in qualitative research.\nFuture conversations might explore whether the (re)presenta-\ntion of qualitative research through these new modalities\ndestabilizes the construction of authoritative knowledge.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nCatalani, C., & Minkler, M.
