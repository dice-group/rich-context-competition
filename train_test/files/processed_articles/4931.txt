    "abstract": "Abstract: Cross-culturally, participants in public goods games reward participants and\npunish defectors to a degree beyond that warranted by rational, profit-maximizing\nconsiderations. Costly punishment, where individuals impose costs on defectors at a cost to\nthemselves, is thought to promote the maintenance of cooperation. However, despite\nsubstantial variation in the extent to which people punish, little is known about why some\nindividuals, and not others, choose to pay these costs. Here, we test whether personality\ntraits might contribute to variation in helping and punishment behavior. We first replicate a\nprevious study using public goods scenarios to investigate effects of sex, relatedness and\nlikelihood of future interaction on willingness to help a group member or to punish a\ntransgressor. As in the previous study, we find that individuals are more willing to help\nrelated than unrelated needy others and that women are more likely to express desire to\nhelp than men. Desire to help was higher if the probability of future interaction is high, at\nleast among women. In contrast, among these variables, only participant sex predicted\nsome measures of punitive sentiment. Extending the replication, we found that punitive\nsentiment, but not willingness to help, was predicted by personality traits. Most notably,\nparticipants scoring lower on Agreeableness expressed more anger towards and greater\ndesire to punish a transgressor, and were more willing to engage in costly punishment, at\nleast in our scenario. Our results suggest that some personality traits may contribute to\nunderpinning individual variation in social enforcement of cooperation.\n",

Established partial solutions to this problem include kin altruism\nreputation building (Alexander, 1987) and costly signaling (Zahavi, 1995). However, there\nremain several puzzling aspects in human cooperative behavior that seem to defy\nexplanation by any of these mechanisms (e.g., Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Fehr, Firschbacher\nexperimental games which are intentionally structured so as to ensure that participants'\nbehavior cannot be logically attributed to any of the standard explanations of cooperation.\nPlayers are total strangers to each other (excludes kin altruism), they make their decisions\nanonymously (excludes reputation building and costly signaling) and they only interact\nwith each other once (excludes reciprocal altruism) although the latter condition may not\nperfectly capture real-world conditions, especially those in the ancestral past, where\nprobability of future interaction would very rarely have been zero (see Burnham and\nchoose to reward participants and punish defectors in ways that are irrational from the\nviewpoint of calculating, self-interested agents who organize their behavior around income\nmaximization (Fehr et al., 2002; Price, Cosmides, and Tooby, 2002). These puzzling results\nhave been replicated with participants drawn from a wide range of cultures around the\nFor example, the public goods paradigm (Egas and Riedl, 2008; Fehr and G\u00e4chter,\n2000, 2002) typically involves participants who are given a number of monetary units\n(MU) at the start of the experiment, of which they can contribute any portion they want to a\ncollective group project. Every MU invested by a player yields a payoff of less than 1 MU\nfor every group member, while every MU withheld by a player yields a payoff of exactly 1\nMU for that particular player and 0 MU for the other players. This payoff structure ensures\nthat while all players would come out with a positive return to their investment if they\ninvested their entire endowment to the common project, any single player can do even\nbetter by withholding funds from the project while reaping the benefits of the other players'\ncontributions. All contributions are made simultaneously, they are anonymous, and the\ngroups are broken up at the end of every round, such that no two participants ever play with\neach other more than once. At the end of every round participants are informed about the\nother members' contributions to the project (though not their identities) and can choose, at\ntheir own personal expense, to punish other members for not contributing to the project.\nFor example participants might be allowed to give up 1 MU in order to deprive another\nplayer of 3 MU (Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2002). Given the rules of the game a rational, self-\ninterested player should never punish, yet players do routinely punish fellow players who\nmake below-average contributions. Since all interactions are one-off and the punisher can\nnever directly benefit from any subsequent change in the punished player's cooperative\nbehavior, this type of behavior is often described as `altruistic punishment' (Bowles and\nWho punishes?\nbeneficial effects in sustaining high investment levels, as punished members raise their\ncontributions in subsequent rounds, even though they interact with new players in each\nround. This surprising outcome stands in stark contrast to the no-punishment condition of\nthe game, where players are not allowed to punish free-riders. In this condition cooperation\ngradually dwindles, with most participants eventually contributing nothing to the project\nResults like this have led to the emergence of `strong reciprocity' as a general term\nto describe humans' tendency to punish defectors and reward co-operators beyond what is\nwarranted by rational choice theory (Fehr et al., 2002; Gintis, 2000; Gintis, Henrich,\nBowles, Boyd, and Fehr, 2008) and where other standard evolutionary explanations do not\napply. There is yet no consensus as to the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon\n2007), but one suggestion is that it may have evolved by enforcing cooperation between\ngroup members, with selection acting at the level of human groups (Boyd, Gintis, Bowles,\nPrevious studies indicate remarkable variation in individual engagement in both\ncostly punishment and helping (Barclay, 2006; O'Gorman, Wilson, and Miller, 2005), and\nthere is growing interest in the sources of this individual variation (Bergm\u00fcller, Sch\u00fcrch,\nand Hamilton, 2010). Indeed, this is true of behavior in experimental games in general. For\nexample, there is widespread heterogeneity in rejection of offers in the ultimatum game\n(Fehr and Schmidt, 1999) and this appears to be under significant genetic influence\n(Wallace, Cesarini, Lichtenstein, and Johannesson, 2007). Wallace et al. (2007) argue that\nthis variation may contribute to the mixed success that has met attempts to find satisfactory\ncorrelates of behavior in experimental games, and that further efforts should explore links\nbetween behavior in economic games and the significant source of variation in behavior\nthat derives from personality traits. Likewise, Bergm\u00fcller et al. (2010) highlight the\npotential role of personality (or `behavioral syndromes') in determining individual\ndifferences in cooperative behavior in animals.\nThe aim of this study was to explicitly investigate these possible links between\npersonality traits and variation in helping and punishment behaviors. We framed our study\nwithin evolutionarily informed theories of personality that suggest that variance in human\npersonality traits can be attributed to selective advantages of different responses to\nrecurrent social problems faced by our ancestors (Buss, 1984, 1991; Michalski and\nShackelford, 2010). Consequently, each trait can be considered to be a result of various\ntrade-offs; for instance, individuals scoring high in extraversion report more sexual partners\nbut also more injuries (Nettle, 2005). In this light, it is reasonable to question how\npersonality traits help to shape individual behavior in the face of social dilemmas\n(Michalski and Shackelford, 2010). Here, motivated by growing recognition of the\npossibility that personality traits underpin at least some variation in cooperation in humans\nand animals (Wallace et al., 2007; Bergm\u00fcller et al., 2010), we investigate the role of\npersonality in shaping behavior in social scenarios calling for cooperative responses or\nresponses to a social transgression in a cooperative setting.\nTo do this, we set out to replicate and extend the design of O'Gorman et al. (2005)\nthat tested individuals' desire to help or punish in various hypothetical scenarios. These\nWho punishes?\nscenarios elicited marked individual variation in willingness to help and punish. In their\nstudy, desire to help an unfortunate other was influenced by both relatedness and\nprobability of future interaction, as predicted by evolutionary considerations. Individuals\nwere more willing to help relatives than strangers, and more willing to help if there was\nhigh probability of future interactions. In contrast, desire to punish free-riders was\nmoderated by neither of these variables, leading O'Gorman et al. to conclude that altruistic\nhelping and punishing behavior were underpinned by different proximate psychological\nfactors. Willingness to engage in punishment might therefore be influenced either by\ncontextual variables not captured in O'Gorman et al.'s study, or by other causes of\nindividual variation such as personality traits. Here, we specifically focused on this second\npotential source of variation \u00ad personality traits. Following general predictions about\npossible costs and benefits of each of the Big Five Model domains proposed by Nettle\n(2006), we considered how these domains might relate to tendency to engage in\npunishment. In particular, we predicted that willingness to punish might be specifically\ndriven by variation along the Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and\nNeuroticism domains. It is well established that variation in these domains affects social\ninteractions across various contexts. For example, Extraversion is intrinsically linked to\nengagement in social interactions. With regard to Agreeableness, the lower end of the\ndimension is characterized by descriptors such as hostility and spitefulness. Those scoring\nlow on this dimension are less likely to compromise during inter-personal conflicts, while\nthose scoring high receive higher levels of peer acceptance, have more mutual friends and\nbetter outcomes in cooperative tasks (Jensen-Campbell, Adams, Perry, Workman, Furdella,\nand Egan, 2002; Jensen-Campbell and Graziano, 2001; Koole, van den Berg, Vlek, and\nHofstee, 2001). Nettle (2006) highlights that larger and looser social groupings will select\nfor lower Agreeableness than smaller, closer ones. People scoring high on\nConscientiousness tend to favor social norms (McCrae and John, 1992), exhibit strong\nmoral principle (Nettle, 2006) and have higher peer acceptance (Jensen-Campbell and\nMalcolm, 2007). Finally, individuals who score highly on Neuroticism may experience\nanger more readily, which may lead to increased engagement in costly punishment (Seip,\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nvisitors to a local science museum. Participants were aged between 16 and 78 years (M \u00b1\nallowing us to generalize beyond a narrow undergraduate sample.\nProcedure\nEach participant answered questions relating to two separate fictional scenarios (a\nhelping and a punishment scenario) adapted from O'Gorman et al. (2005) (for a full\ndescription, see Appendix). The scenarios were presented in randomized order. Briefly, in\nthe helping scenario, participants were asked to imagine that, together with nine others\nWho punishes?\n(either cousins or strangers), they had pooled their money to invest in the stock market, but\nthe investment only broke even and one member had anticipated a profit to pay for\nemergency medical bills. This unfortunate person was either moving to another town or\nliving in the same town, depending on the condition. This scenario therefore shared the\npunishment scenario's 2 (Relatedness) x 2 (Probability of future interaction) factorial\ndesign, with four dependent variables: sympathy for the person, desire to help the person,\nlevel of anger towards other group members that were unwilling to help the person (each\non a 1 to 9 scale), and the maximum amount the participant would be willing to give to\nhelp the person.\nThe punishment scenario also involved the participant pooling investment funds\nwith nine other people (cousins or strangers), but in this scenario one participant had\ncheated by contributing considerably less than the agreed-upon amount. While everyone\nhad contributed \u00a31000, the transgressor had contributed only \u00a3200, and, since the profits\nhad been split equally, the transgressor ended up receiving \u00a32160 more than he deserved.\nThe transgressor was either moving to another town, or living in the same town, depending\non the condition. This again yielded a 2 x 2 factorial design with four conditions in total.\nThe dependent variables were responses to four items. Two of them recorded participants'\nanger towards, and desire to punish, the transgressor (on a nine point scale). There were\nalso two items that asked participants to indicate the amount of money they thought the\ntransgressor should pay and the amount they would personally be willing to spend in order\nto punish him/her.\nParticipants also provided their age and sex, and completed a brief measure of the\nBig Five personality factors, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), which includes two\nitems per factor and is thus quick to administer (which suited the setting of this study) but\nnonetheless correlates well with both the longer Big-Five Inventory and the NEO\nPersonality Inventory (Gosling, Rentflow, and Swann, 2003). In our data, internal\nconsistency between items was as follows: extraversion (Cronbach's  = .67),\nagreeableness ( = .11), conscientiousness ( = .37), neuroticism (emotional stability in\nGosling et al.;  = .45), openness ( = .26).\nIn analysis of the data, we again followed the approach of O'Gorman et al. (2005),\nusing factorial ANOVA with relatedness and probability of future interaction as between-\nsubject factors. We included participants' scores on the personality dimensions as\ncovariates. Although the dependent variables were not always normally distributed,\nANOVA is robust to this violation (Field, 2005). Data were analyzed in SPSS, version 18.\nWhere appropriate, we include estimates of effect size, usually Cohen's d, for which d of\n.20, .50 and .80 are indicative of a small, medium and large effect, respectively (Cohen,\nResults\nValidity checking\nWe first carried out a validity check of our scenario-setting, by analyzing the data as\na simple replication of O'Gorman et al.'s study, without accounting for personality traits.\nAnalysis of the helping scenario revealed a number of significant effects (in all cases, the\nWho punishes?\noverall ANOVA models were significant at  = .05). There were main effects of\nrelatedness (see Figure 1a) with regard to sympathy for the person [F(1,192) = 5.36, p =\nparticipant sex (see Figure 1b), with women expressing greater sympathy for the person\nContrary to O'Gorman et al. (2003), there was no main effect of probability of future\ninteractions on helping, but there were several significant interaction effects with\nparticipant sex: analysis showed that while men's responses were relatively insensitive to\nthe likelihood of future interaction, women tended to express more sympathy when future\n.011, d = .38] and were willing to give more money to the unfortunate group member\nIn contrast, in the punishment scenario, there were no significant main effects of\nrelatedness, future interaction or sex across any of the four dependent variables, nor any\nsignificant interaction effects. The only factor that approached significance was a main\nthe cheater (M \u00b1 SE; males: 5.4 \u00b1 2.5, females: 4.7 \u00b1 2.6). We further investigated the\namount that participants would be willing to pay to punish because this variable was highly\nskewed, with 60% of participants indicating they would pay nothing at all. On this basis,\nwe further tested this variable using binary logistic regression, comparing those who would\npay nothing and those who were willing to pay something. This analysis revealed a main\nsex effect (Wald's 2 = 5.48, df = 1, p = .019) with men being more willing to pay to punish\nthan women, and an interaction between sex and likelihood of future interaction\n(Wald's 2 = 3.99, df = 1, p = .046), such that women were especially reticent to pay when\nmeeting again was more likely.\nEffect of personality\nTo investigate the contributions of personality traits on responses to the scenarios,\nwe re-ran the analyses as before, including participant sex, relatedness and likelihood of\nfuture interaction as factors, now also including as covariates the participants' scores on the\nBig Five personality dimensions.\nWho punishes?\nFigure 1. Effects of (a) relatedness and (b) participant sex in the helping scenario. Data\nshow mean (\u00b1 SE) sympathy to an unfortunate group member, desire to help, anger at non-\nhelpers, and the amount participants would be willing to give to help.\nNote: In a), individuals are more sympathetic and willing to help cousins\n(open bars) than strangers (shaded bars), more angry at non-helpers if the\nunfortunate person is a cousin, and willing to pay more to help cousins\nthan strangers. In b), male participants (open bars) are significantly less\nsympathetic and willing to help than female participants (shaded bars).\nIn the helping scenario, the only dependent variable that was significantly predicted\nfrom any of the Big Five dimensions was sympathy for the unfortunate person. High scores\non Agreeableness predicted increased sympathy towards the unfortunate group member (\n= .31 \u00b1 .16, p = .047), with no other significant effects of personality dimension.\nIn the punishment scenario, in contrast, analyses revealed several significant\nrelationships between participants' responses and scores on personality dimensions (see\nTable 1). In particular, participants who scored lower on the Agreeableness dimension\nexpressed more anger towards (p = .008) and greater desire to punish (p < .0001) the\nWho punishes?\ntransgressor, and thought the transgressor should pay more in reparation (p = .037). In\naddition, participants who scored higher on Conscientiousness expressed greater anger\ntowards the transgressor (p = .033) and those scoring lower on Extraversion expressed\ngreater desire to punish (p = .016). Finally, as before, we further tested effects of\npersonality traits on those who were willing to pay at least something to punish the\ntransgressor (a binarized version of the final dependent variable), using logistic regression.\nIn this analysis, lower scores on the Agreeableness dimension also predicted willingness to\npay to punish the transgressor (p = .045).\nTable 1.

(2005), who also\nfound that participants were sensitive to context cues in the helping scenario but that these\nvariables did not tend to predict behavior in the punishment scenario. Like O'Gorman et\nal., we found that relatedness cues predicted willingness to help, but not to punish. Effects\nof participant sex in our study were also in the same direction as those in O'Gorman et al.'s\nstudy: they found a near-significant tendency for women to express more sympathy for the\ngroup member in the helping scenario (this was significant in our study, as was desire to\nhelp), but in neither study did participant sex have effects on anger towards the transgressor\nor contributions to help. In the punishment scenario, O'Gorman et al. found that men\nexpressed greater desire than women to punish the transgressor, while we found a near-\nWho punishes?\nsignificant difference in the same direction. In neither study were there significant sex\ndifferences in levels of anger, the amount that participants thought the transgressor should\npay, nor in the amount they were willing to pay to punish (except where we binarized the\ndata, which O'Gorman et al. did not do). As with O'Gorman et al., then, where sex\ndifferences did exist, men appeared more likely to engage in punishment than women. This\ncould be because men tend to (and presumably did, in our evolutionary past) engage with\nlarger groups on average than women, (e.g., Baumeister 2010), where the need for social\nenforcement of cooperation are greater.\nThe main difference between our results and those of O'Gorman et al. was that we\ndid not find a main effect of probability of future interaction in the helping scenario,\nalthough we did find significant interactions with sex, such that this effect was more\nimportant in women than men. We do not know the reason for this difference, but it could\nbe due to the combination of stronger effects in women and O'Gorman et al. having a\nhigher proportion of women in their sample than we did. However, with this exception, our\nresults replicated the main findings of the earlier study and confirm the validity of the\nscenario-setting in our study, thus enabling us to proceed to examine effects of personality\ntraits.\nAs predicted, we found that engagement in punishment was correlated with\npersonality, in particular with individuals' score on the Agreeableness dimension.\nParticipants who scored low on Agreeableness expressed greater anger towards, and desire\nto punish, the transgressor. They also felt the transgressor should pay more in reparation,\nand they expressed greater willingness to pay at least something to punish the transgressor.\nHigher scores on Conscientiousness also predicted anger towards the transgressor, although\nit did not correlate with other measures. Furthermore, individuals scoring low on\nExtraversion also indicated a higher desire to punish the transgressor. Conscientiousness\nand Extraversion predicted single aspects of behavior only (respectively, anger towards and\ndesire to punish the transgressor) and not measures of actual reparation or monetary will to\npunish. O'Gorman et al. also reported that while most of their participants expressed high\nlevels of anger and willingness to punish a transgressor, only some were willing to actually\nengage in altruistic punishment. Thus, the effects of Conscientiousness and Extraversion\nextend to emotional reaction towards, but not action against, the transgressor, in contrast to\nindividuals scoring low on Agreeableness.\nThe finding that people scoring lower on Agreeableness express greater anger\ntowards defectors in a collaborative enterprise, and are more willing to punish them, is in\nline with their description as relatively suspicious, irritable and vengeful (e.g., McCraw and\nJohn, 1992; Costa and McCrae, 1992). Similarly, the finding that more conscientious\npeople expressed greater anger towards defectors is not difficult to interpret. Goldberg\n(1993) describes them, among other things, as orderly, organized, systematic, punctual,\neconomical and thrifty. Apart from the ethical dimension of the matter, defection by\nanother group member would represent a considerable upset and disturbance to the\nconscientious person's organization and planning. We also found a negative relationship\nbetween extraversion and desire to punish. Introverts have been conceptualized, among\nother things, as timid and unassertive (Goldberg, 1992), traits that are difficult to reconcile\nwith the results of this study, but a possible explanation might be found in their lower\nWho punishes?\nreliance on social interactions, and consequently increased tolerance of dissatisfaction or\neven hostility on the part of others. Introverts might therefore be more willing to assume\nthe social costs of retaliation (Janssen and Bushman, 2008). This line of reasoning suggests\nthat the costs of punishment are considerable, and can potentially disrupt extraverts' fabric\nof social relations.\nIt was perhaps surprising that individual variation in desire to punish, and anger at\ntransgressors in the collaborative venture, were not predicted by participants' scores on the\nNeuroticism dimension. Individuals who score highly on this dimension tend to experience\nemotions such as anger more readily, and anger has been implicated in the tendency to\nengage in costly punishment (Seip, van Dijk, and Rotteveel, 2009), as well as competitive\nattack responses in a wartime prisoner's dilemma game (Kassinove, Roth, Owens, and\nFuller, 2002). In one of Seip, van Dijk, and Rotteveel's (2009) studies, more punishment\nwas elicited in participants who had been primed with feelings of anger (by recalling and\ndescribing an autobiographical episode involving anger) compared to a control group. It\nthus appears likely that the emotion of anger is important in driving punishment behavior,\nand in our study, level of anger at the transgressor was highly correlated with desire to\npunish (r = .545, p < .001). However, while anger as an emotion is not restricted to\nindividuals scoring highly on neuroticism, one would expect such people to display higher\nthan average levels of anger. Thus, the lack of relationship between punishment and\nNeuroticism indicates that the links between personality traits and punishment behavior\nextend beyond proneness to anger.\nBefore we leave this discussion, however, one should note that the tool we used to\nassess personality dimensions might in fact underestimate the effects under investigation.\nDue to time constraints on our participants (members of the public passing through a\nscience museum), we employed a ten-item personality (TIPI) questionnaire, assessing\nindividual scores on each of the five personality dimensions on the basis of responses to\nonly two items. Although scores on the TIPI correlate well with scores generated by more\ndetailed instruments (Gosling et al. 2003), its internal consistency is lower than typically\nfound in such instruments (in both our sample and that originally reported by Gosling et\nal.). Thus, although the fact that we found significant relationships between personality and\npunishment variables when using this tool implies a robust effect, future studies should\nconsider use of a more detailed personality questionnaire.\nA potential criticism of our study is that it relies on responses to hypothetical\nscenarios and involves no actual monetary (or other) cost to participants. In light of the\nfindings we describe here, it would certainly be interesting to examine whether and how the\nlinks between personality and punishment hold in an experimental setting. However, as\nO'Gorman et al. (2005) discussed at some length, the scenarios presented in their study and\nalso used here were designed to resemble real-world interactions, produced comparable\nresults to experiments on altruistic punishment, and strongly engaged the participants. Like\nthem, we found marked variation between participants in levels of anger, desire to punish\nand willingness to punish at their own expense. Even though they were fictional scenarios\nand did not involve actual cost to participants, a very high proportion (60%) indicated they\nwould not pay anything to punish, indicating they were treating the scenario seriously and\nbehaving as one would expect in the real world. Furthermore, the overall pattern of our\nWho punishes?\nresults map very closely onto O'Gorman et al.'s, indicating reliability of the scenarios, and\nboth sets of results produce results that are directly predicted by evolutionary principles\nsuch as kin selection and game theory. For these reasons, we concur with O'Gorman et al.\nthat the effects elicited by these scenarios are unlikely to be an artefact of the procedure; on\nthe contrary, we believe it is more likely than not that they reflect how people will respond\nto actual social injustices encountered in the real world.\nAlthough here we have concentrated solely on psychological traits, studies have also\nbegun to address the possible utility of biological markers in predicting punishing behavior.\nIt has been found, for example, that men with higher levels of testosterone are more likely\nto punish selfish offers in the ultimatum game (Burnham, 2007). Along with such\nmeasures, our results suggest that personality may play a critical role in determining\nindividual variation in willingness to engage in punishment. This provides at least a partial\nexplanation for apparently irrational behavior in experimental games: because personality\ntypes are relatively stable, patterns of behavior associated with certain personality\ndimensions could render individuals susceptible to engaging in enigmatic costly\npunishment, even in one-shot interactions.\n"
