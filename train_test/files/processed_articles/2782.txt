However, the\ncontribution of androgen in women is unknown.\nObjective: Our objective was to assess the longitudinal relations of circulating androgens and\nestradiol (E2\n) and their joint effects to the risk of developing fibroids.\nDesign: This is a 13-year longitudinal study in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.\nSetting: This study was conducted in seven sites across the United States (1997\u00ad2013).\nParticipants: At baseline, 3240 pre- or early peri-menopausal women with an intact uterus, ages\nrecurrent fibroid cases.\nExposures: We measured near-annual time-varying serum levels of bioavailable E2\nand bioavail-\nable T, dichotomized at the median (high vs low).\nMain Outcomes and Measures: We estimated the conditional odds ratio (OR) of fibroids in the\nensuing year using discrete-time proportional odds models adjusted for race/ethnicity/site, age,\nbody mass index, menopausal stage, reproductive factors, smoking, timing of blood draw, and FSH.\nResults: Women with high T had a statistically significant increased risk of incident fibroids (OR,\nfurther elevated in those with high T and E2\nand T\nConclusions: High T with high E2\nwas associated with an elevated risk of incident fibroids in midlife\nwomen who never reported fibroids before baseline.

Myomectomy\ncan be performed to remove individual detected fibroids;\nhowever, recurrence from underlying risk factors is still\npossible (4).\nThe strongest established risk factors for fibroids in-\nclude being African-American, adiposity, and exogenous\nestrogen exposure (5\u00ad8). Estrogen-containing contracep-\ntives or menopausal hormone therapy have also been as-\nsociated with an increased risk of fibroids (9, 10). Further,\nmenstruating women were found to have a higher risk of\nfibroids compared to postmenopausal women, most likely\nbecause of higher estrogen levels (11, 12) The bioactive\nform of estrogen (17-estradiol [E2\n]) promotes the pro-\nliferation of fibroids via up-regulation of progesterone re-\nceptor expression (13). In vitro studies have also impli-\ncated androgen in the development of uterine fibroids (2,\n14). Aromatase, which catalyzes androgen to estrogen, is\noverexpressed in fibroid tissue compared to normal myo-\nmetrium, thus underscoring the potential relationship be-\ntween androgen and estrogen in fibroid development (2,\n15, 16). However, the role of circulating androgen and E2,\nand their interplay, in relation to the risk of fibroids is un-\nknown. Characterizing these roles could better elucidate the\npathogenesis of fibroids and aid in developing preventive\nstrategies and nonsurgical treatment alternatives.\nToaddressthegapsinknowledge,weleverageddatafrom\nthe prospective Study of Women's Health Across the Nation\n(SWAN). The primary hypothesis was that higher bioavail-\nable levels of E2\nand androgens (T, and dehydroepiandros-\nterone-sulfate[DHEAS])wouldbeassociatedwithincreased\nriskofdevelopinguterinefibroids.Thestudyobjectiveswere\nto determine: 1) the individual relationships and joint effects\noftime-varyingcirculatinglevelsofbioavailableE2\n,bioavail-\nable T, and DHEAS, to the risks of developing incident fi-\nbroids and first recurrence of fibroids across a 13-year fol-\nlow-upperiodinmidlifewomenundergoingthemenopausal\ntransition (MT); and 2) if these relationships differed among\nwomen in different racial/ethnic groups.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy population\nSWAN is a seven-site, longitudinal, community-based, mul-\ntiethnic cohort study of midlife women undergoing the MT.\nSWAN enrolled 3302 eligible women at baseline and is currently\nconducting its 15th follow-up visit (17). Eligible women at base-\nline had to be 42\u00ad52 years old, pre- or early peri-menopausal,\nhad a menstrual period and no exogenous hormone use in the\nprior 3 months, had an intact uterus and at least one ovary, and\nnot be pregnant or lactating. Since 1996, SWAN participants\nwere evaluated at near-annual, in-person visits using self-admin-\nistered questionnaires and interviews to obtain information on\ndemographics, medical history, reproductive characteristics, an-\nthropometric measures, and medication use. Additionally,\nwhole blood samples were collected and assays for serum bio-\nmarkers were performed. The institutional review boards of all\nparticipating institutions approved the SWAN core study. All\nparticipating women provided written informed consent.\nThe current study used a longitudinal design and excluded\nwomenwhoreportedhavinghysterectomyorcancerdiagnosisat\nbaseline. Approximately 70\u00ad80% of women in the general pop-\nulation develop fibroids before age 50 years. Because the age range\nat baseline was 45\u00ad52 years, women who self-reported medical\ndiagnosis of fibroids before baseline, but had an intact uterus, were\nalso analyzed to enhance generalizability. Therefore, development\nof incident and first recurrent fibroids were of interest separately\nand together. The study sample consisted of 3240 women at base-\nline.Throughoutthe13-yearfollow-up,womenwhoreportedhav-\ning incident or recurrent fibroids, hysterectomy, died, or were per-\nmanently lost to follow-up since the last visit were censored at the\ntime of initial report from future risk sets.\nOutcome assessment: uterine fibroids\nUterine fibroids were self-reported on near-annual question-\nnaires throughout the follow-up. Fibroid occurrence was ascer-\ntained by asking the question, \"Since your last study visit, has a\ndoctor, nurse practitioner or other health care provider told you\nthat you had fibroids, benign growths of the uterus or womb, or\ntreated you for them,\" from baseline to visit 3. From visits 4\nthrough 13, fibroid occurrence was ascertained by asking \"Since\nyour last study visit, have you had fibroids?\"\nExposure assessment: serum levels of sex\nhormones\nSWAN measured serum total E2\n, total T, DHEAS, FSH, and\nSHBG levels in near-annual intervals throughout the follow-up\n(18). For pre- and early peri-menopausal women, timing of\nblood draw was defined as \"in window\" if between days 2 and\n5 of menstrual cycle and \"out of window\" otherwise. Endocrine\nassays were performed with an Automated Chemiluminescence\nSystem (ACS)-180 analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corporation) us-\ning a double-antibody chemiluminescent immunoassay with a\nsolid phase anti-IgG immunoglobulin conjugated to paramag-\nnetic particles, anti-ligand antibody, and competitive ligand la-\nbeled with dimethyl acridinium ester, as previously described\nwas assessed with a modified the rabbit anti-E2\nACS-180 immunoassay to increase sensitivity and had a lower\nlimit of detection of 1.0 pg/ml. Total T was measured using a\nmodified rabbit polyclonal anti-T ACS-180 immunoassay. The\nDHEAS and SHBG assays were developed on-site using rabbit\nanti-DHEAS and anti-SHBG antibodies. Duplicate E2\nassays\nwere performed and arithmetic means were reported for each\nparticipant, with a coefficient of variation of 3\u00ad12%. All other\nassays were single measurements. Bioavailable E2\nand T levels\nwere unitless indices representing the bioactive forms unbound\nto SHBG. Bioavailable E2\nwas calculated as the ratio of total E2\n])/SHBG nM). Bioavailable T was calculated as the ratio of\nCovariates\nThe following covariates were chosen based on previous lit-\nerature: age at baseline, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Af-\nrican-American, Japanese, Chinese, and Hispanic), study site,\ntime-varying MT stage (post- and late peri-menopause vs pre-\nand early peri-menopause), time-varying body mass index (BMI)\n(continuous; log kg/m2), time-varying sex hormone use for any\nreason including oral contraception, time-varying progestin use,\ntime-varying current and former smoking status (binary) (20),\ntime-varying passive smoke exposure (0, 1\u00ad4, 5 person-hours/\nweek) (21), time-varying FSH (mIU/ml), parity at baseline, age at\nfirst birth, and timing of blood draw (in vs out of window) to\naccount for short-term fluctuations in hormone levels during the\nmenstrual cycle, while recognizing the irregularity of menstrual\ncycles during the MT.\nData analyses\nAt baseline, the distribution and normality of continuous\nvariables were assessed using histograms, QQ plots, and Sha-\npiro-Wilks tests. Differences in normally distributed continuous\nvariables between racial/ethnic groups were assessed using\nANOVA. Differences in non-normally distributed variables be-\ntween racial/ethnic groups were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis\ntests. Continuous variables with right-skewed distributions were\nnatural-log transformed to approximate normal distributions.\nDifferences in categorical variables between racial/ethnic groups\nwere assessed using 2 tests. Spearman correlation coefficient\nmatrices were used to assess the monotonic associations among\nindependent variables.\nThemainexposuresofinterestweretime-varyingserumlevelsof\nbioavailable E2\n, bioavailable T, and DHEAS at each visit. Sex hor-\nmonelevelsweredichotomized:\"high\"levelsweredefinedasbeing\nabovethebaselinemedianand\"low\"levelswerebelowthemedian.\nMedian values were from women who did not reported fibroids\nprior to baseline. A \"combination\" variable for bioavailable T and\nwas created with four categories: high T and high E2\n, high T and\n, low T and high E2\n, and low T and low E2\n(the reference\ncategory). The combination variable was used to evaluate the joint\neffectofbioavailableE2\nandT.Similarly,acombinationvariablefor\nDHEAS and bioavailable E2\nwas assessed.\nUnadjusted and multivariable-adjusted discrete-time propor-\ntional odds models were used to estimate the conditional odds\nratio (OR) of developing uterine fibroids in the ensuing year, in\nrelation to time-varying levels of circulating sex hormones. The\ntime scale was follow-up time in near-annual intervals (study\nvisits). The follow-up time was from baseline to the 13th fol-\nlow-up visit. Discrete-time survival models were used because\nthe data were only observed in equally spaced discrete intervals\n(22).Discrete-timewasspecifiedinthemodelstoaccountfortied\nevent outcomes within intervals. The multivariable-adjusted\nmodels controlled for race/ethnicity, study site, and menopausal\nstage by stratification of the timescale, assuming different inter-\ncepts. The other previously mentioned covariates were paramet-\nrically adjusted. Three separate analyses were performed to es-\ntimate the risk of: 1) developing either incident or first recurrence\nof fibroids, in women with or without reported fibroids prior to\nbaseline; 2) incident fibroids in women without reported fibroids\nat baseline; and 3) first recurrence of fibroids in women who\nreported fibroids prior to baseline.\nSeparate modeling was performed for: 1) \"high\" vs \"low\"\nlevels of bioavailable E2\n, bioavailable T, and DHEAS, as dichot-\nomized independent variables in the same model; and 2) each of\nthe combination variables. Time-varying serum sex hormones\nwere lagged by one follow-up visit in both the unadjusted and\nmultivariable-adjusted analyses. Time-varying covariates were\nlagged by one visit in the multivariable-adjusted analyses. Each\ncovariate was evaluated for its association with incident fibroids\nin separate unadjusted models. Interaction terms between bio-\navailableE2\nandeachandrogen(bioavailableTandDHEAS)and\nbetween each sex hormone and race/ethnicity were included in\nsome of the multivariable-adjusted models to assess effect measure\nmodification. Interaction terms involving the combination sex hor-\nmone variables were not fitted in the analyses due to implied re-\ndundancy. Proportionality assumptions were assessed using inter-\naction terms between the independent variables and time.\nNo blood draws occurred at the 11th follow-up visit. Women\nfrom the Newark, NJ, study site were censored after the sixth\nfollow-up visit due to administrative issues resulting in discon-\ntinuation of data collection. Missing time-varying data through-\nout the follow-up period were imputed using last observation\ncarried forward from the previous visit. All analyses were per-\nformed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). P values .05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the SWAN study population\nthe 13-year follow-up.

Further,\nwomen with both high E2\nand T levels had an even\ngreater protective effect against risk of fibroid recur-\nrence. However, a significant relationship was not\nfound between E2\nlevels and risk of incident fibroids.\nWhen examining all eligible participants who had an\nintact uterus at baseline, T, DHEAS, and E2\nwere not\nfound to be associated with developing incident or re-\ncurrent fibroids. This finding was probably because\ntheir diametrically opposing effects on incident and re-\ncurrent fibroids drowned each other out when including\nprevalent cases at baseline.\nFindings from this study raise the question as to why T\nhave opposing relationships with risk of incident\nand recurrent fibroids. It should be noted that 70\u00ad80% of\nwomen in the general population develop fibroids by age\nyears. Therefore, restricting the study sample to those who\nwere free of fibroids at baseline would create a form of\nselection bias that limits generalizability to older women,\nand would only be relevant to late-onset fibroids. How-\never, women who had previously reported fibroids before\nbaseline may have a greater susceptibility of recurrence.\nTherefore, there may be heterogeneity in fibroid risk in the\nstudy sample when including both women free of fibroids\nand prevalent cases at baseline. As such, we performed\nthree separate analyses restricting to women at baseline\nwith an intact uterus who: 1) did not have fibroids, 2)\nreported prior fibroids, and 3) did and did not report prior\nfibroids as a means to isolate the risk of incident and re-\ncurrentfibroidsseparatelyandtogether.Fromabiological\nperspective, differences in the effects of T and E2\non inci-\ndent and recurrent fibroids may be due to differences the\nexpression of estrogen and androgen receptors in the myo-\nmetrium of women with and without prior fibroids (1).\nHigher expression of estrogen and androgen receptors\nhave been found in fibroids compared to normal myome-\ntrium (23\u00ad25). Previously having fibroids, which were re-\nmoved by myomectomy, may alter receptor expression\npatterns in the vicinity. Furthermore, T and E2\nmaybe\nacting upon receptors on undetected fibroids, whose dis-\ntributionsaredifferentbetweenthosewithandwithoutprior\nfibroids at baseline. However, previous studies found that\nestrogen promotes, rather than inhibits, growth of fibroids\n(1). Caution is recommended when interpreting the results.\nThese findings warrant further investigation of the effect of\nandrogens and E2\non fibroid risk.\nTable 3.

SWAN is a unique community-based cohort with\nextensiveparticipantcharacterizationandnear-annualre-\npeated measurements of serum sex hormone measure-\nments. The repeated measurements allowed the long-term\nlongitudinal trajectories of sex hormone levels and perti-\nnent factors over time to be evaluated in relation to fibroid\nrisk. Additionally, the multiethnic composition of SWAN\nimproves generalizability of the findings to the US\npopulation.\nHowever, this investigation had limitations. First, the as-\nsessment of fibroids relied on self-report of previous medical\ndiagnosis.SWANdidnotassessfibroidsize,number,orclas-\nsification. Many uterine fibroids are asymptomatic; there-\nfore, most of the reported cases of fibroids were likely to be\nsymptomatic. Differential misclassification of the outcome\nmay occur if higher sex hormone levels affects fibroid size,\nnumber, or classification, thus altering detection rates (26).\nHowever,undersamplingasymptomaticwomenwithhigher\nwould likely bias the estimates toward the null and\nlead to conservative estimates of risk. Second, random\nmismeasurement of sex hormone levels would likely conser-\nvatively underestimate the effects. Third, near-annual sex\nhormone measurements, especially of E2\n, may not fully cap-\nturetheshort-termdynamicchangesduringtheMT, andthe\ntiming of blood sampling may be challenging because of ir-\nregular menstrual cycling that is common to women with\nfibroidsandwomenundergoingtheMT.However,timingof\nbloodcollectionrelatedtothemenstrualcyclewascontrolled\nin theanalyses.Fourth,unmeasuredconfoundersmayhavein-\ntroducedbiaseventhoughmajorknownconfoundersfrompre-\nvious literature were controlled. In particular, LH and serum\nprogesterone may be important factors related to fibroids and\n, but were not measured in SWAN (27, 28). However, time-\nvarying progestin use was controlled in the analysis.\nAndrogens and androgen receptors are expressed in\nfibroid tissue (14). Androgens are direct precursors of es-\ntrogens via conversion by aromatase; the mechanism by\nwhich T may increase the risk and growth of uterine fi-\nbroids could be via its conversion to E2\nthe overexpression of aromatase in fibroid tissue suggests\nthat androgen might play an important role in fibroid de-\nvelopment (15, 16). The lack of association between\nDHEAS and risk of fibroids may be due to its weak an-\ndrogenic effects and lack of aromatization compared to T\n(30). Exogenous and endogenous estrogen are established\nfactors in the development of uterine fibroids (5, 10, 12).\nEndogenous E2\nlevels dramatically decrease in menopause\n(31). Consistent with previous studies, we found that late\nperi- and post-menopausal women had lower risk of fi-\nbroids compared to pre-menopausal women (1).\nAfrican-American women had a substantially higher\nrisk for uterine fibroids compared to non-Hispanic white\nwomen in our study. This finding was consistent with\nprior studies, which found that African-Americans were\nmore likely to have a clinical diagnosis of uterine fibroids,\nwith more severe related symptoms than white women (7,\n8, 32\u00ad34). Higher passive smoke exposure was associated\nwith an increased risk of fibroids. Further investigation\ninto the relationship between passive smoke exposure and\nfibroid risk may be warranted.\nIn summary, findings from this longitudinal study of\nmidlife women suggest that higher levels of both bioavail-\nable T and E2\nis related to an increased risk of incident\nfibroids in the ensuing year in women who never previ-\nously reported them, but is related to a decreased risk of\nrecurrent fibroids in women who previously reported\nthem. Considering the individual and joint effects of cir-\nculating T and E2\nlevels on fibroid risk could help in iden-\ntifying high-risk midlife women and developing person-\nalizednonsurgicaltherapeuticoptions.Futurestudiesmay\nbenefit from focusing on both the short-term and long-\ntermdynamicsofsexhormonebalanceinthedevelopment\nof fibroids. Furthermore, a longer follow-up time begin-\nning earlier in adulthood could improve the understand-\ningoftherelationshipbetweensexhormonedynamicsand\nfibroid risk across the life-course of women.\n"
