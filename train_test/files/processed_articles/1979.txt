These observations indicate that the development of\nNAFLD is indeed multi-factorial and other factors, such\nas dietary habits may play an important role in the\ndevelopment of NAFLD.\nAlthough a number of nutritional studies have been\nperformed to assess the interaction between diet and\nliver disease, caffeine intake has garnered a lot of atten-\ntion. Studies done in the United States have shown that\nincreased coffee intake is associated with a lower inci-\ndence of abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activ-\nity.17 In addition, studies from Europe and Japan have\nindicated an inverse relationship between coffee and lev-\nels of g-glutamyltransferase and aminotransferases in\nAssessing end stage liver-specific outcomes, a large\npopulation based study in Norway found an inverse\nassociation between coffee consumption and liver cirrho-\nsis.25 Furthermore, a study using the first National\nfound that coffee and tea drinking decreases the risk of\nclinically significant chronic liver disease as defined by\ndeath or hospitalisation due to CLD.17 Caffeine has also\nbeen implicated in hepatic fibrosis, as recently demon-\nstrated by a study showing that regular coffee consump-\ntion, above a threshold of approximately two coffee-cup\nequivalents per day, was associated with less severe hepa-\ntic fibrosis.26 Recent studies have also suggested that cof-\nfee consumption may reduce the risk of developing\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk popula-\ntions.27 In addition, research in the field of hepatitis C\nand treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin found\nthat high-level consumption of coffee (more than three\ncups per day) to be an independent predictor of\nimproved virological response.28 Despite the increasing\nfocus on the effects of coffee in the aetiology of severe\nliver disease, there is little data assessing the relationship\nbetween coffee consumption and NAFLD specifically.\nUsing recent U.S. population data, the aim of this\nstudy is to investigate the effects of dietary behaviour,\nspecifically the nutrition components measured for\nNHANES participants, on the prevalence of NAFLD.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nThe data for the study were obtained from four continu-\nous cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Surveys (NHANES) conducted between 2001 and\n2008. The survey data were collected by the U.S.\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via\nhousehold interviews, physical examination and labora-\ntory tests. The survey cycles included into the study con-\nsisted of similar questionnaires and data collection\nmethods. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parame-\nters were transformed according to the provided guide-\nlines to make the data comparable between the cycles.29\nInclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study\nwere similar to previously published reports.4, 5 Further-\nmore definitions for obesity (BMI 30), Hypertension,\nhypercholesterolaemia and diabetes mellitus were similar\nto previously reported.4, 5 Finally, insulin resistance was\ndefined as a homeostasis of model assessment score30 or\nHOMA) >3.0, elevated serum aminotransferases were\ndefined as ALT >40 U/L or AST >37 U/L in men and\nALT or AST >31 U/L in women and elevated transferrin\nsaturation was determined as 50% or higher.4, 5\nWe also divided participants to four major race or\nethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic\nblacks, Hispanics, and `other,' which included Aleut,\nEskimo, American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander.\nIn terms of tobacco and alcohol consumption, a posi-\ntive smoking history was defined as on-going smoking or\nC\nCa\naf\nff\nfe\nei\nin\nne\ne i\nis\ns p\npr\nro\not\nte\nec\nct\nti\niv\nve\ne i\nin\nn p\npa\nat\nti\nie\nen\nnt\nts\ns w\nwi\nit\nth\nh N\nNA\nAF\nFL\nLD\nD\nintake was calculated according to self-reported data on\nthe amount and frequency of alcohol consumption col-\nlected as a part of the Alcohol Use questionnaires.4, 5\nExcessive alcohol consumption was defined as >20 g/day\nfor men and >10 g/day for women.\nWe used previously described definition for\nwas defined as elevated serum aminotransferases without\nany indication of other causes of chronic liver disease\nsuch as viral hepatitis infection (defined as positive HCV\nRNA or HBsAg test), iron overload (transferrin satura-\ntion of 50% or higher) or excessive alcohol consumption\nas defined above. Similarly, controls were defined as par-\nticipants without any evidence of chronic liver disease\nand normal liver enzymes.\nNutrition data\nThe dietary intake data collected as a part of the Dietary\nRecall Interview are used to estimate the types and\namounts of foods and beverages (including all types of\nwater) consumed during the 24-h period prior to the\ninterview. Participants' responses were used to estimate\nintakes of energy, nutrients and other food components\nfrom those foods and beverages.\nThe dietary interview component named What We\nEat in America (WWEIA) had been conducted as a part-\nnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS). Daily aggregates of food energy and 62\nnutrients /food components from all foods were calcu-\nlated for NHANES data collection using USDA's Food\nand Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS).\nThe FNDDS includes comprehensive information that\ncan be used to code individual foods and portion sizes\nreported by participants, and also includes nutrient val-\nues for calculating nutrient intakes.33 For this study, only\nFirst Day Interview data were used.\nStatistical analyses\nSample weights were used to account for nonresponse\nand unequal selection probabilities for certain categories\nof the population. In addition to weighting on the basis\nof age, gender and ethnicity which is introduced to make\nthe NHANES sample representative of the U.S. popula-\ntion, sampling weights calculated specifically for analysis\nof dietary recall interview components also accounted for\ndisproportionately represented intakes on weekends. In\naddition, stratum and sampling units accounted for the\nsurvey design effects using Taylor series linearisation.\nContinuous variables such as nutrients measured in\ngrams or milligrams were compared using a t-test for a\ncontrasted mean. When merging NHANES study cycles,\nappropriate selection of sampling weights and adjustment\ncoefficients were applied according to the NHANES Ana-\nlytic and Reporting Guidelines.29 The prevalence of vari-\nous parameters, including demographic parameters and\nmetabolic syndrome components, was compared between\nsubjects with NAFLD and controls by the stratum-\nspecific chi-squared test for independence. P-values of 0.05\nor less were considered potentially statistically significant.\nFinally, logistic regression was used to identify indepen-\ndent predictors of NAFLD among nutrition components\nafter adjustment for potential clinical confounders. All\nanalyses were run using SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 10.0 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The study was approved\nby the Inova Institutional Review Board.\nRESULTS\nStudy population\nOf the initial study population (41 658 participants from\nfulfilled the definition of NAFLD and 16 768 were used\nas controls. The most relevant clinico-demographic dif-\nferences between individuals with NAFLD and controls\nare noted in Table 1. As expected, individuals with\nNAFLD were less likely African American and more\nlikely of Hispanic ethnicity, had higher rates of insulin\nresistance, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity.\nNutrition and NAFLD\nOf the 62 nutrient components used for the study, 24\n(38%) were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the\nNAFLD and control groups (Table 2).

NAFLD is thought to be the hepatic\nmanifestation of metabolic syndrome and an early pre-\ndictor of metabolic disorders amongst obese and normal-\nweight populations.4, 34, 35 The spectrum of NAFLD\nranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepa-\ntitis (NASH). Although most cases of simple steatosis do\nnot progress, 10\u00ad15% of steatohepatitis cases can pro-\ngress to cirrhosis 36, 37 and subsequently into more seri-\nous conditions, such as HCC.38 The rising incidence of\nNAFLD observed in recent years necessitates a multi-dis-\nciplinary approach to understanding the causative factors\nof this disease.\nIn this study, using the NHANES data collected\nestimating daily nutrition intake, we assessed the nutri-\ntional contribution on the prevalence of NAFLD. As\nexpected, individuals with NAFLD were less likely Afri-\ncan American and more likely of Hispanic ethnicity, had\nhigher rates of insulin resistance, hypercholesterolaemia\nand obesity. In addition, when metabolic syndrome com-\nponents were included to the list of potential confound-\ners for NAFLD, obesity was also found to be\nindependently predictive of NAFLD.\nOf the 62 nutrients assessed in the univariate analysis\nbetween the NAFLD and control groups, 24 (38%) were\nwith caffeine consumption being significantly higher in\nthe control group without liver disease\nvalue = 0.0006). In addition to ranking in the top two in\nterms of statistical significance, caffeine was one of the\nonly two compounds consumed independent from com-\npounds one might encounter in regular food intake\n(Table 2). The inverse correlation between caffeine con-\nsumption and NAFLD gained further significance in our\nmultivariate analysis as caffeine consumption was found\nto be one of the five independent predictors of NAFLD,\nremaining highly significant after adjustment for race,\ngender and metabolic syndrome components (Table 3).\nSpecifically, if we converted daily caffeine intake to cups,\nassuming 100 mg of caffeine in a cup, then, in the same\nmultivariate analysis, each extra cup could be associated\nwith lower odds of NAFLD (given everything else is\ncate a strong association between coffee consumption and\nTable 1 | Demographic and\nclinical summary of the NA-\nFLD cohort\nNAFLD Controls P\nNAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nC\nCa\naf\nff\nfe\nei\nin\nne\ne i\nis\ns p\npr\nro\not\nte\nec\nct\nti\niv\nve\ne i\nin\nn p\npa\nat\nti\nie\nen\nnt\nts\ns w\nwi\nit\nth\nh N\nNA\nAF\nFL\nLD\nD\nthe prevalence of NAFLD and increase the plausibility that\ncoffee may indeed offer some protection against the devel-\nopment of this condition. It is important to presume that\ncaffeine intake may have hepatoprotective effects up-to to\na certain threshold, after which no additional benefit can\nbe gained. However, our data analysis was not able to\nestablish a `safe' threshold for caffeine intake.\nDespite the scarcity of data on the exact mechanism\nby which coffee and its components impact the aetiology\nof liver disease, there are some promising hypotheses\nthat may account for their metabolic actions. A recent\ncell culture study, using HepG2 and CaCo2 cells indi-\ncates that the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family of\ngenes, thought to be proteins with indirect antioxidant,\ncytoprotective and genoprotective capabilities, are\ninduced by coffee, independent of caffeine content, sug-\ngesting glucuronidation as a mechanisms for the protec-\ntive and antioxidant effects of coffee.39 Previous studies\nfocusing on fibrosis have shown that the methylxanthine\ncaffeine, a large component of coffee, may inhibit the\nsynthesis of connective tissue growth factor\n(CTGF/CCN2) in liver parenchymal and nonparenchy-\nTable 2 | Statistically signifi-\nnents of Nutritional\nQuestionnaire and NAFLD\nNAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nTable 3 | Independent predictors of NAFLD after adjust-\nment for demographic confounders such as age, gender,\nethnicity and metabolic syndrome components\nPredictor OR (95% CI) P\nAfrican American\nRace\nCaffeine (mg)\nintake\nTotal plain water\nconsumed (g)\nBMI, body mass index; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease.\nA\nA.\n.

Furthermore, it is evi-\ndent from the available data that the effects of coffee on\nthe aetiology of liver disease are indeed multi-factorial,\nnecessitating detailed mechanistic studies to understand\nits exact impact.\nIn conclusion, using recent U.S. population data, we\nhave identified caffeine as being one of the most sig-\nnificantly different nutrient components between the\nNAFLD and control cohorts. Our data indicate that\ncaffeine may play a protective role in the development\nof NAFLD. Furthermore, our multivariate analysis\nhighlighted caffeine consumption as one of five inde-\npendent predictors of NAFLD after adjustment for\nimportant confounders. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first study showing a substantial inverse cor-\nrelation between caffeine consumption and NAFLD\nspecifically, in humans using population-based data.\nDespite the scarcity of mechanistic data on the protec-\ntive effects of coffee in the aetiology of NAFLD, there\nare some very plausible hypotheses suggesting that cof-\nfee may have a suppressive effect on hyperglycaemia\nby improving insulin sensitivity, partly due to a reduc-\ntion of inflammatory cytokine expression. The impact\nof coffee and its components on NAFLD in particular\nand liver disease in general, need to be studied in\ngreater detail.\n"
