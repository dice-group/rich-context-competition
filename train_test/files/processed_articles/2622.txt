Meng (1998) [15], Meng and Zhang (2001) [1],\nMa and Li (2016) [7] analyzed occupational segregation and the wage gap between migrants and local urban resi-\ndents and found that occupational discrimination is the main factor underlying the wage gap. However, these stu-\ndies did not consider the sector selection bias problem in wage functions and the analysis periods reach only the\nearly 2000s. Thus, recent factors contributing to wage gaps between migrants and local urban residents are not\nclear.\nThis study presents an empirical approach to answer the following questions: First, do wage gaps exist be-\ntween migrants and local urban residents? Second, what factors determine the wage levels of migrants and urban\nlocal residents? Third, what factors determine the wage gaps between migrants and urban local residents? Final-\nly, has the influence of these factors on the wage levels and wage gaps changed from 2002 to 2013?\nThis study contributes in the following ways. First, it investigates how unexplained differentials (i.e., dis-\ncrimination) and explained differentials (e.g., those based on individual characteristics, including human capital\nSecond, it considers sector segmentations by industry sectors, public and private sectors, and regions in the\nChinese urban labor market. Finally, it discusses the changes in the influences that these factors have on the\nwage gap from 2001 to 2013. The study's results are new discoveries for the wage-gap issue.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Part 2 describes the analysis methods, including introduction to models\nand data. Part 3 is the description analysis results, and Part 4 states the quantitative analysis results. Part 5\npresents the main conclusions.\n2. Methodology and Data\nFirst, to explore the wage gaps between migrants and local urban residents, estimation based on OLS and quan-\ntile regression models (Koenker and Baset, 1978) are utilized [16]. The OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) analysis\nis express by Equation (1.1)\nln\ni m i X i i\nWage a Mig X u\n \n=\nIn Equation (1.1), i represents the individual (a migrant or a local urban resident), lnWage is the logarithm\nof the average wage, Mig is the migrant dummy, X represents the other factors (e.g. education, experience\nyears, industries, occupations) which affect wage, u is a random error item. When the coefficient of the migrant\ndummy (\nm\n ) is negatively significant, it is shown that if the other factors are consistent, the average wage level\nis higher for the migrants than for the local urban residents.\nConsidering the selection bias problem in Equation (1.1), the selection bias corrected wage function model is\nproposed (Maddala, 1983) [17]. Equation (1.2) expresses the probability of entry to industry sectors using mul-\ntinomial logit model. For example, the probability to become a worker in an industry sector is expressed as\n( )\ni\nY = , and the other probability is expressed as ( )\ni\nY  . H represents factors identical to those ex-\npressed in Equation (1.1)including Mig and X, Z is used as an identification variable1. Using the estimated\nresults of the distribution function and the density function by probit regression model, selectivity items\n( ( ) ( )\n, ,\n     \n=  are calculated. The corrected wage functions expressed by Equation (1.3)\ncan be estimated using these selectivity items.\n( )\ngi g H gi gi\nY a H i N\n \n=+ + =\n\n*\ni\nY n\n= if ( ) ( )\nn ni g gi g n gi ni\nH H a a\n   \n- > - + - ( )\ng n\n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n*\nexp\nexp\nn Zn ni Hn ni\ni r\ng Zn gi g gi\ng\na Z H\nY n g g n r\na H\n \n  \n=\n+ +\n= = =\n+ +\n \nln\nr\ni X i g ig i\ng\nWage a H v\n\n  \n=\n=\n+ + +\nSecond, to estimate what factors determine the average wage levels of migrants and local urban residents, the\n1Age, age-squared are used as identification variables in the study.\nX. Ma\nsample bias corrected wage functions by migrants and local urban residents are estimated.\nFinally, to estimate which factor determinates he wage gap between migrants and local urban residents, the\nOaxaca-Blinder decomposition model is utilized. Based on wage functions, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition\nmodel can be derived as Equation ((3.1), (3.2)).\n( ) ( )\nln ln\nu rm u rm u rm u rm\n  \n( ) ( )\nln ln\nu rm rm u rm u rm u\n  \nIn Equations ((3.1), (3.2)), u represents local urban residents, rm represents rural migrants, lnW is the loga-\nrithm of the average wage, X is the average values of variables, and u\nand rm\nrepresent the estimated coeffi-\ncients resulting from the wage function of males and females, respectively.\n( )\nu rm u\nX X \n- and ( )\nrm u rm\nX X \n- represent the wage gap resulting from a difference between migrants\nand local urban residents groups in the individual characteristics factors, including human capital (e.g. education,\nexperience years) and the industry in which the individual is working, ( )\nrm u rm\nX  \n- and ( )\nu rm u\nX  \n-\nrepresent the wage gap caused by the unexplained differentials, including discriminations.\nThe survey data of CHIPs 2002 and CHIPs 2013 are used for the analysis. These data are gained from the two\nsurveys of Chinese Household Income Project conducted by NBS, Economic Institute of Chinese Academy So-\ncial Science (CASS) and Beijing Normal University (BNU) in 2003 and 2014, including respective information\nabout the individual characteristic factors, industries, workplace ownership types and wages of migrants and lo-\ncal urban residents. Because there are design similarities of the data in the questionnaire, we can use the same\ninformation for analysis for two periods.\nCHIP surveys cover the representative regions in China, including Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui,\nGuangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Gansu in CHIPs2002, and Beijing, Shanxi,\nLiaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Chongqi, Yunnan, Gansu, Shanghai, Zherjiang,\nFujian, Hunan in CHIPs 2013. To make comparisons in two periods and address the sample distribution bias\nproblem, we selected the regions (provinces or cities) covered in all two surveys, including Beijing, Shanxi,\nLiaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Gansu.\n2.3. Variables Setting\nThe wage is defined as the total earnings from work (called \"the total wage\"). Here, it comprises the basic wage,\nbonus, cash subsidy, and no cash subsidy. The CPI in 2002 is utilized as the standard to adjust the nominal wage\nThe analytic objects of this study are workers, excluding the unemployed. In considering the retirement sys-\ntem implemented in the public sector--the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the government organizations, to\nreduce the effect of that system on the analysis result, analytic objects are limited in the groups to between the\nages of 16 and 60. No answer samples, abnormal value samples2, and the missing value samples are deleted.\nTo see the depended variables setting. First, to correct the sample selection bias by the probability of entry to\nthe monopoly or the competitive industry sectors, the probability function of entry to industries is estimated. In\nthe probability function of entry to industries, the depended variable is a category variable. To maintain the\nanalysis samples by each industry category and consider the feature of the industry distributions of migrants, the\nindustrial categories in the CHIPs3 are reclassified. Five kinds of industries--construction, manufacturing, retail\nand wholesale industries, service, and other industries are utilized to construct the category variable.\nSecond, in the wage function, the depended variable is the logarithm of the wage rate. The wage rates are\ncalculated based on total wage and work hours. The CHIP survey data for local urban residents are included\nthose who were re-employed as non-regular workers after the employment adjustment of state-owned enterpris-\nes. The total wage in those samples are the total value of base salary, bonuses and goods calculated by monetary,\nexcluding layoff living assistance, minimum income assistance, and living assistance by firms, income by asset\n2That variable values are not in the range of \"mean value \u00b1 three times S.D.\" is defined as abnormal value here.\n3The numbers of industry categories are sixteen in the survey for local urban residents, and they are twenty-five in the survey for migrants in\nX. Ma\nand financials, security transfer income. For work hours, work hours yearly for local urban residents are calcu-\nlated by \"work hours daily \u00d7 work days monthly \u00d7 work month yearly\", and work hours monthly for migrants\nare calculated by \"work hours daily \u00d7 work days weekly \u00d7 4\". Wage rate are calculated by total wage divided by\nwork hours.\nThe independent variables are the variables likely to affect the wage, they are conducted as the follows.\nFirst, education (primary school or below, junior high school, senior high school/vocational school, college\nand above), experience years4, age, health status (very good, good, fair, bad) are conducted as the index of hu-\nman capital. It is though that these might factors affect the wage level.\nSecond, because labor market is segmented by the public- and private-sectors in China, and it is pointed out\nthat there exists wage gaps between public- and private-sectors (Chen, Demurger, and Fournier, 2005 [18];\nare conducted to control the influence of ownerships on the wage gaps. Concretely, the public sector include\nstate-owned enterprises (SOE) and government organizations, the private sector composes of collectively owned\nenterprises (COE) and foreign/private enterprises, self-employed workers, and other ownerships.\nThird, it is thought that the special political membership may affect the wage levels. Party membership dum-\nmy is used in the analysis.\nFourth, considering gender, the married, and the race might affect the wage levels, these dummy variables are\nutilized.\nFinally, because there exists regional disparity for economic development levels, and the labor markets are\ndifferent by the regions, East, Central, West regions dummy variables are used to control these influences.\n3. Descriptive Statistics of the Data\n3.1. Individual Characteristics Differentials by Migrants and Local Urban Residents in\nThe data's descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. The individual characteristics of the differentials by mi-\ngrants and local urban residents are observed as follows:\nFirst, the logarithms of the average wage rates are higher for local urban residents than for migrants for both\nSecond, the individual characteristic differentials between migrants and local urban residents show that years\nof experience are greater, and ages are higher for local urban residents than for migrants, in both 2002 and 2013.\nThese results are consistent with the phenomenon that most of the younger labor force with rural registrations is\nmoving to and working in urban areas. However, the differentials of experience years between these two groups\nThird, although in both 2002 and 2013 the proportion of workers with higher education (such as senior high\nschool and college/university) is smaller for the migrants group, the proportion of migrant workers that has\neducation differentials between local urban residents and migrants have changed greatly from 2002 to 2013.\nFourth, in both 2002 and 2013, the proportion of communist party member is greater for local urban residents\nFifth, in both 2002 and 2013, the proportions who answered that their health status is \"very good\" is greater\nfor migrants than for local urban residents. However, the health differentials between these two groups de-\nSixth, in both 2002 and 2013, there are differences in proportions in terms of gender and ethnicity between\nmigrants and local urban residents, though these are smaller than for other factors.\nSeventh, in both 2002 and 2013, although most of migrants work in the retail/catering, and service industry\nsectors, the industry distribution differentials between migrants and local urban residents become smaller from\n4Experience years = age - schooling years.\nX.

Moreover, the proportion of workers in the private sectors rises greatly for both migrants and local urban\nworker share in the public sector, private sector absorbed more workers (both migrants and local urban residents)\nThe estimated kernel density of the logarithm of the wage rate is shown in Figure 1, the main finding are as fol-\nlows:\nX. Ma\nThe density of high-wage groups is greater for local urban residents than for migrants in both 2002 and 2013.\nIt is indicated that the proportion of workers with a high wage is greater for local urban residents than for mi-\ngrants. It can be concluded that the majority of workers with high wages in 2013 were local urban residents dur-\ning the 2000s. Additionally, the proportion of individuals with low wages is also greater for the local urban res-\nidents than for the migrants. The dispersion of wage rate in the intra-group is shown to be greater for the local\nurban residents than for the migrants.\nMoreover, when comparing the change of the estimated kernel density curve, the differentials between mi-\ngrants and local urban residents reduced from 2002 to 2013. This indicates that along with the marketization\neconomy system transition from 2002 to 2013, the wage gaps between these two groups decreased.\nTable 2 shows the statistical value of the logarithm of wage rate. The mean values and the 25th, 50th, and\n75th percentiles of wages are all higher for local urban residents than those for migrants in both 2002 and 2013.\nMoreover, the maximum values of the logarithm of the wage rate are all higher for local urban residents than\nthose for migrants. Similarly, the minimum values of the logarithm of the wage rate are all lower for local urban\nresidents than those for migrants in both 2002 and 2013. For example, the maximum values of the logarithm of\nKernel Density estimated results.\nFigure 1.

Ma\nAlthough these tabulation calculation results indicate that the individual characteristics, the wage density dis-\ntributions are different for migrants and local urban residents, and that there exist wage gaps between the two\ngroups, the factors that might affect the probabilities of entry to industry sectors and the wage level differentials\nhave not been controlled in these results. An econometric analysis is thus conducted as follows.\n4. Econometric Analysis Results\n4.1. Do Wage Gaps Exist between Migrants and Local Urban Residents?\nTable 3 demonstrates the results for wage gaps between migrants and local urban residents. First, the wage gap\ncontrolled, the average wage level for migrants is 65.4%, which is 16.6% lower than that for local urban resi-\ndents. When the main human capital factors (work experience and education) are consistent (model 2 and model\nmain factor that causes the wage gap.\nSecond, when the workplace ownership is consistent, wage gaps decrease to -0.192 (model 9) in 2002. This\nresult suggests that workplace ownership is also a main determinant of the wage gap.\nFinally, compared to 2002, the wage gap reduces in 2013. Particularly, when education is consistent, the av-\nerage wage level for migrants is higher than that for local urban residents. These results can be explained as fol-\nlows: Along with economic development, the surplus labor decreased and labor productivity increased in the\nrural region; thus, the wage level of migrants--which is mainly determined by the subsistence level in the rural\nregion--increased. Consequently, the wage gaps between migrants and local urban residents decreased from\n4.2. What Factors Determine the Wage Levels of Migrants and Urban Local Residents?\nWhich factor determinates the wage levels of migrants and urban local residents? To answer this question, wage\nfunctions are estimated, the results being shown in Table 3.\nFirst, the Maddala model is utilized to adjust the sample selection bias caused by the choice of entry to an in-\ndustry. In both 2002 and 2013, the correct items are statistically significant for the local urban residents group\nand the coefficients of these correct items are all negative values. The results for the local urban residents group\nwill thus be overestimated when these selection biases are not adjusted.\nSecond, U-shaped curves can be constructed from the estimated results for years of experience and their\nsquared values, with points of inflection at 20 years for migrants and 46 years for local urban residents in 2002,\nTable 3.

Thus, while work experience af-\nfected wage levels for migrants and local urban residents, the effect was greater for local urban residents than for\nThird, in 2002, wages for the low-level education group (primary school) were less than those of the\nmid-level education group (junior high school) and higher for the high-level education groups (senior high\nschool, college/university) for both migrants and local urban residents. However, in 2013, wages for the\nlow-level education group were higher compared to the mid-level education group for migrants. In addition, if\nother factors are constant, the wage differentials between the different education groups are statistically insigni-\nficant. These results show that the returns on education have recently risen for low-skill migrants.\nFourth, in 2002, there are gender wage gaps for both migrants and local urban residents, and this was higher\nsisted for local urban residents (-0.178), it was not statistically significant for migrants. These results indicate\nthat if other factors remain constant, gender wage gaps increased for local urban residents (female dummy coef-\nFifth, considering segmentation by workplace ownership types in 2002, public-sector wages were lower than\nprivate-sector wages or for the self-employed sector for migrants, whereas wages were lower for private-sector\nworkers or the self-employed for local urban residents. In addition, while wages for private-sector or self-em-\nwage gap differentials between each sector were not statistically significant for migrants in 2013. These results\nindicate that wage gaps by workplace ownership type decreased recently, all other factors remaining the same.\nSixth, we next consider the industry-level segmentation. Both migrant and local urban resident workers\nearned more in the construction industry than in the manufacturing industry in 2002 and 2013. Moreover, wages\nfor both types of workers were lower for those in the retail/catering and service industries in 2002. However,\nwhile the results for the retail/catering and service industries remained consistent with the results in 2002 for lo-\ncal urban residents, the coefficients increased and were not statistically significant for migrants in 2013. Thus,\nall other factors constant, the industrial wage gaps declined for migrants and increased for local urban residents5.\nFinally, In terms of regional location, both migrant and local urban resident workers in the central region\nearned less than those in the eastern and western regions in 2002 and 2013. These results show that regional\n4.3. What Factors Determine the Wage Gaps between Migrants and\nLocal Urban Residents?\nWhich factors determine the wage gap between migrants and local urban residents? The Oaxaca-Blinder model\nis utilized to decompose the factors that contribute to the wage gap based on the estimated results shown in Ta-\nble 4 and Table 5. Table 6 and Table 7 report the decomposition results using the human capital factors and by\nlabor market segmentation (industry, workplace ownership, and region), respectively. The main findings are as\nfollows:\nFirst, in both 2002 and 2013, the main factor causing the wage gap is the contribution of the explained diffe-\nMautrer-Fazio and Dinh (2004) [27], the results of Estimation 2 are consistent with Xing (2008). In addition, if\nlabor market segmentation factors are considered, the contribution of explained differentials becomes greater in\nboth 2002 and 2013. These results indicate that the individual characteristic differentials and the different dis-\ntributions among industry sectors and regions as well as between the public- and private-sector are the main\nfactors affecting the wage gap between migrants and local urban residents. It is thought that the different distri-\nbutions among sectors might be caused by the discrimination when the migrants entrance to the monopoly in-\ndustry sectors or the public sector. So it can be said the labor market segmentation by systems are one of the\nmain factors affecting the wage gap.\nSecond, to consider in detail the factors underlying the explained differentials, based on Table 4 (Estimation\n5For the latest empirical study on the industrial segregation and wage gaps between migrants and local urban residents, please see Ma and Li\nX.

These results indicate that the individual characteristic\ndifferentials and the different distributions among industry sectors and regions, as well as between the public-\nand private-sector, are the main factors affecting the wage gap between migrants and local urban residents.\nSecond, considering the components of the explained differentials, the influences of workplace ownership\ntypes, education levels, and industry sectors are the greatest in both 2002 and 2013.

Policies that aim to reduce human\ncapital differentials between these two groups, such as education and years of experience, should also be im-\nplemented in the long term. Moreover, in order to address the labor market segmentation problems fundamen-\ntally, the enforcement of economy systems transition from the planned economy to the marketization economy\nis an important issue for Chinese government in the long term.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 16K03611) of JSPS (Japan Socie-\nty for the Promotion Science), and Joint Usage and Research Center Project, Institute of Economic Research,\nHitotsubashi University.\nReferences\n[1] Meng, X. and Zhang, J.
