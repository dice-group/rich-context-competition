This study examines the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and selected measures of functional\nillness and whether the relationship between BMI and these outcomes is stronger in advanced ages.\nMethods. Four measures of functional illness were examined in a national, longitudinal survey of noninstitutionalized\nadults. Tobit and Poisson models were used to estimate cross-sectional and longitudinal specifications.\nResults. BMI was related to functional illness but not in a linear form: Both obese and underweight persons manifested\nhigher levels of functional illness on most outcomes during the baseline survey. Results from the change analyses, however,\nrevealed that obesity was associated with more days hospitalized or ill in bed and an increase in functional limitations.\nDiscussion. Obesity is associated with functional illness, but there is no evidence from these data that this relationship is\nstronger for older adults. Rather, the effect of obesity on some measures of functional illness is greater in the younger and\nmiddle ages.\nA LARGE and growing body of research links excess body\n1~\\ weight with morbidity and mortality over the life course.\nNumerous studies have shown that obesity is associated with\ngreater risk of disease including hypertension (Willett &\ncardiovascular disease (Rich-Edwards, Manson, Hennekens, &\nDozens of studies also point to obesity leading to higher mor-\ntality risk (e.g., Andres, Muller, & Sorkin, 1993; National\nInstitutes of Health, 1985; Tayback, Kumanyika, & Chee,\n1990). The most recent studies have helped to clarify the condi-\ntions under which the risks of morbidity and mortality are high-\nest for obesity as well as the mechanisms for the deleterious\nalso been vigorous debates as to whether the relationship be-\ntween body mass index (BMI) and either illness or mortality is\nlinear, j-shaped, or u-shaped (Sorkin, Muller, & Andres, 1994;\nTroiano, Frongillo, Sobal, & Levitsky, 1996; Willett & Manson,\nWhile scores of studies have examined the link between obe-\nsity and both morbidity and mortality, relatively little research\nhas examined the relationship between obesity and functional\nillness. This is surprising, given that physical disability and\nfunctional illness are often key variables influencing health-\nrelated quality of life and mortality risk (Wilson & Cleary,\n1995). The present research is designed to address this gap in\nthe literature by examining whether excess body weight affects\nfunctional illness and if the effect is greater in later life. Build-\ning on Parsons (1972), we define functional illness as a general-\nized reduction in the capacity of an individual to perform his or\nher roles.\nObesity and Functional Illness\nDecades of research in several disciplines have helped to\nidentify the origins of functional illness (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz,\nResearch has proliferated in recent years examining the predic-\ntors of disability (Palmore & Burchett, 1997), functional de-\n(Guralnik et al., 1993), and active life expectancy (Crimmins,\nHayward, & Saito, 1996). While many of these studies have\nyielded important contributions for understanding trajectories\nof functional illness, most studies--even the more recent ones\n--have not examined the influence of body weight (Foley et al.,\nJette, 1994). At the same time, there is a modest but growing set\nof studies that examine the relationship between obesity and\nvarious indicators of function. Unfortunately, findings across\nthese studies are not consistent. Some of these studies show\nthat obesity is related to impaired function (Ferraro, Farmer, &\nWybraniec, 1997; Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley, Bales,\n& Madans, 1994), whereas others find no such link (G. A.\nKaplan, Strawbridge, Camacho, & Cohen, 1993; Lawrence &\nThere are at least three biological mechanisms for expecting\na link between excessive body weight and functional illness.\nFirst, excessive weight may add physical stress to the skeleton\nand weight-bearing joints, thereby increasing the likelihood of\nosteoarthritis and impairing function (Hart & Spector, 1993).\nSecond, excessive weight may promote insulin resistance and\nhyperglycemia, which, in turn, will promote glycation of pro-\nteins and DNA in soft connective tissue (Modan et al., 1988;\nSupiano et al., 1993). These changes are often associated with\ninflammatory responses in the connective tissue of the joints\nand arteries leading to functional illness (Cerami, 1985;\nWalford, Harris, & Weindruch, 1987). Third, excessive weight\nmay lead to a pattern of blood lipids that will promote athero-\ngenesis and thereby decrease ability to function normally (N.\nMost of the studies that find a link between BMI and func-\ntional illness are longitudinal analyses, and some are derived\nfrom the same data set. For instance, Crimmins and Saito\n(1993) used the Longitudinal Study on Aging and found that\noverweight people were more likely to show deterioration on\nsome measures of functional illness but not on others. Lawrence\nand Jette (1996) used the same data set and did not detect any\ndirect effects of BMI on several indicators of functional limita-\ntion and disability. Among those that do find an association be-\ntween body mass and functional illness, most focus on the\nGalanos and colleagues (1994), however, found that both high\nand low BMI values were associated with higher functional im-\npairment. This suggests that the relationship between BMI and\nfunctional illness is more complex than a simple linear relation-\nship. Age differences are also important to consider.\nBMI and Functional Illness in Life Course Perspective\nMany of the studies cited above were conducted on samples\net al., 1993). Although this cannot explain all the inconsistency\nin the literature, it may provide insight when considered with\nsamples that are not so constrained by age. Galanos and col-\nleagues (1994) studied an older sample and found both low and\nhigh BMI associated with functional illness measures including\nactivities of daily living (ADLs), the Fries disability scale, and\nthe Rosow-Breslau scale. Studies of older participants that treat\nBMI in a linear form find either no effect on functional illness\nrelationships on selected indicators of functional ability\n(Crimmins & Saito, 1993). On the other hand, the few studies\nthat find an effect of obesity on function consider a wider age\nrange and use either BMI in a linear form or a variable to dis-\nThese findings suggest two reasons why a life course perspec-\ntive may be useful for studying BMI and functional illness.\nFirst, body weight typically changes over the life course:\nBMI increases with age through the adult years, but levels or\ndeclines in older adulthood (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1991).\nWillett and colleagues (1995) found that very few women be-\nexperienced weight loss; most gained weight. By contrast,\nweight loss in adulthood is more likely in later life as energy in-\ntake decreases because of loss of appetite, illness, or depression\nweight loss and low weight in older ages are more likely to be\nconsequences of disease or its treatment (Losonczy et al.,\n1995). It appears that if only a linear relationship between BMI\nand functional illness is considered on an older sample, the ef-\nfects associated with low BMI and high BMI may cancel one\nanother.\nSecond, a life course perspective may be helpful because\nthere is debate about whether the effects of body weight on\nhealth are constant over the life course. Obesity is a risk factor\nfor health problems, but is obesity more likely to be consequen-\ntial to health at certain stages of the life course? According to\ncumulative disadvantage theory, the effects of risk factors accu-\ntive, it is important to recognize that the consequences of many\nhealth practices are long term rather than immediate. It may\ntake years before excessive weight actually influences disabil-\nity, and the later years may be the point at which the lifelong\nconsequences of excessive weight will have their greatest ef-\nfect. On the other hand, studies of mortality have shown that\nobesity is significant in younger adults, but not older--suggest-\ning that the risk of excess weight on health and mortality in the\nlater years has been exaggerated (Andres et al., 1993; Lindsted\neither maintain their weight or, better, gain small amounts of\nweight, show the lowest mortality\" (p. 69).\nFor the present study, two main hypotheses are formulated.\nFirst, we hypothesized that obese persons will manifest higher\nlevels of functional illness than will those of normal weight.\nSecond, we hypothesized that the effect of obesity on func-\ntional illness will be stronger among older respondents than\namong younger respondents. This hypothesis anticipates that\nage and obesity interact in shaping functional illness.\nMETHOD\nSample\nThis study makes use of data from Americans' Changing\nLives (ACL), a longitudinal survey of 3,617 adults from the\nnoninstitutionalized population of the continental United States.\nRespondents were 25 years of age or older and were initially\ninterviewed in 1986. The study sample was selected with a mul-\ntistage area probability sample design and oversampled Black\nand older (60+) respondents at twice the rate of non-Black and\nyounger persons (1,162 persons oversampled). The survey had\na response rate of \"70% among sampled households and 68%\namong sampled individuals (multiple individuals being in-\n(Poststratification weights are available to approximate the U.S.\npopulation of the time.)\nAn attempt was made in 1989 to contact all respondents\nfrom the first survey, hereafter referred to as Wave 1 (Wl).

There were 165 deaths\nthe respondents dropped from the survey as a result of death,\nrefusal to participate, or inability to trace for follow-up, selec-\ntion bias modeling is used for the multivariate analysis of\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--Functional illness is defined as a\ngeneralized reduction in the capacity of an individual to per-\nform his or her roles (Parsons, 1972). Four variables are used as\nindicators: functional impairment, functional limitation, days ill\nin bed, and days spent in the hospital. The first measure is a\nfour-category Guttman scale of self-reported impairment, rang-\ning from 1 (no major functional impairments) to 4 (currently in\nbed or chair and/or high difficulty bathing). A total of 3,060\n(76.7%) Wl respondents reported no major functional impair-\nfunctional impairment.\nThe second measure is self-reported overall functional limi-\ntation: \"How much are your daily activities limited in any way\nby your health or health-related problems?\" Responses ranged\nfrom 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal; House, 1990). A total of\nlimitation.\nDays ill in bed was assessed by asking, \"On about how many\ndays during the past 3 months did you stay in bed all or most of\nthe day?\" Hospitalization was assessed by asking, \"Have you\nbeen a patient in a hospital, overnight or longer, at any time\nduring the past 6 months?\" (House, 1990). These two variables\nwere coded identically, ranging from 0 to 8 (reported values for\nwhen using these variables in cross-sectional analyses because\nof the retrospective nature of the question. Because noninstitu-\ntionalized Americans were sampled, those people who were\nhospitalized at the time of the survey are not represented.\nAs expected, the distributions for days in bed or nights hos-\nW2 respondents (64.9%) reported no days ill in bed within the\nwithin the past 6 months.\nIndependent variables.--Body mass index (BMI) is used to\nmeasure obesity. Height and weight were self-reported in\ninches and pounds and were converted to meters and kilograms.\nBMI was calculated with the Quetelet Index (kilograms/\nmeters2). Self-reported weight and height measures are closely\nrelated to physical measurements but may underestimate the\noccurrence of obesity because of a tendency of short persons to\noverreport height and for heavy persons to underreport weight\nKuskowska-Wolk, Bergstrom, & Bostrom, 1992). Women who\ngave birth 1 year before Wl or between waves were omitted\nfrom the analysis.\nBMI is measured continuously for each respondent and is\nanalyzed both continuously and categorically. The categorical\nform of BMI relies on obesity defined as having a BMI of 30\nor greater, regardless of age or sex (Andres et al., 1993;\nTayback et al., 1990). Whereas the focus of the present re-\nsearch is investigating the link between obesity and functional\nillness, previous research shows the importance of considering\nunderweight as well (Galanos et al., 1994). This is not to as-\nsume that underweight increases functional illness, unless the\nunderweight is severe and includes malnutrition. Slight under-\nweight may be associated with good health outcomes\n(Edwards et al., 1998; Lass, Sohal, Weindruch, Forster, &\nSohal, 1998). Rather, there are two reasons for including un-\nderweight in multivariate models. First, a growing body of re-\nsearch shows that the relationship between BMI and the risk of\nillness and mortality is nonlinear (Troiano et al., 1996; Willett\n& Manson, 1995). Second, weight loss in later life may be cor-\nrelated with functional illness--both caused by disease or its\ntreatment (e.g., Losonczy et al., 1995). Including underweight\ncontrols for those respondents who experienced a weight loss\ndue to disease. Underweight is defined as <19 BMI for women\nand <20 BMI for men (American Public Health Association,\nTable 1 presents Ms and SDs for all variables across three\ncategories of BMI. It is clear from Table 1 that the extremes of\nBMI (i.e., underweight and obesity) were associated with\nhigher disability, thus manifesting a nonlinear relationship with\nthe dependent variables. Therefore, binary variables for both\nunderweight and obesity are used in most multivariate analyses\n(reference group of normal weight). Alternative cut points for\nBMI were used to define underweight and obese persons in\npenultimate cross-sectional and longitudinal models (e.g., 1 SD\nTable 1.

The results of those\nanalyses are similar to those presented below.\nRespondents were asked whether they had experienced 1 or\nmore of 10 diseases in the past year. These conditions were cat-\negorized into chronic, but nonserious, conditions (i.e., arthritis,\nfoot problems, lung problems, broken bones, and urine control)\nand serious conditions (i.e., high blood pressure, heart attack,\ncancer, diabetes, and stroke). Following the procedures of\nFerraro and Farmer (1996), the chronic (nonserious) and seri-\nous conditions were summed separately. (Penultimate models\nsubstituting the sum of all diseases as well as separate dummy\nvariables for each disease were estimated with similar results.\nThe serious/chronic distinction was maintained as the most par-\nsimonious and explanatory approach to examine the link be-\ntween morbidity and functional illness.)\n(>$80,000). Education reflects years of schooling and ranges\nmeasured with the Duncan Socioeconomic Index.\nFunctional illness involves not only an inability to perform\nphysical activities but a limitation in social functioning as well\ncial support may help a person cope with functional illness, it is\nappropriate to control for social support. A social support index\nwas created by combining four questions (e.g., how much\nfriends and relatives care and love you, a = .59; House, 1990).\nRespondents were asked about three recreational activities\ninvolving physical activity (gardening, active sports, and walk-\ning). Given that gardening and active sports are less common\nforms of activity in the ACL, especially among older people,\nrecreational walking was selected as a measure of physical ac-\ntivity. Responses ranged from 1 (never) to 4 (often). The mea-\nsurement of the remaining variables is fairly straightforward\nand described in Table 1.\nDescriptive information for the variables is presented in\nTable 1 based on the sample weighted to U.S. proportions.\nUnweighted data are used in the multivariate analysis because\nthe focus of this research is hypothesis testing rather than de-\nscriptive analysis (Winship & Radbill, 1994). Additional vari-\nables were considered in preliminary analyses but deleted from\nfurther consideration because they were not significant predic-\ntors (i.e., living alone, BMI in continuous form, and living in\nthe south). Small amounts of missing data on various items\n(<2%) were imputed to Ms defined by sex, race, and age (Little\nAnalytic Plan\nTests of hypotheses involve cross-sectional and longitudinal\nspecifications. For the longitudinal analyses of functional im-\npairment and functional limitation, residualized change analyses\nwere performed (W2 variable regressed on the parallel Wl vari-\nable and the covariates). Days in bed and nights hospitalized are\ncount variables referring to what transpired in the 3- and 6-\nmonth time periods prior to the survey; thus, residualized change\nmodels are not appropriate. Rather, the longitudinal analyses for\nthese outcomes are based on lagged-effects models of body\nweight on functional illness (i.e., corresponding Wl dependent\nvariable not included when predicting the W2 outcome).\nGiven the skewed distributions of the four measures of func-\ntional illness, we used tobit models to estimate models for func-\ntional impairment and limitation and used Poisson models to\nestimate models for the count variables of days ill in bed and\nnights hospitalized (Long, 1997). The prevalence of functional\nillness among younger persons (25-64) in the ACL ranges from\n7% (hospitalization) to 26% (functional limitation).\nSelection bias models were used to account for attrition in the\nanalysis of the W2 data. In a longitudinal study such as ACL,\nadverse selection processes could influence sample estimates of\npredictor variables leading to bias in the estimates of the true re-\nlationship between independent variables and functional illness.\nThis concern may be even more important for the present analy-\nin the follow-up (death, refusal, or inability to trace). Thus, se-\nlection bias models, originally developed by Heckman (1979),\nwere used to correct parameter estimates for differential selec-\ntivity by W2 (Winship & Mare, 1992). The procedure involves\nfirst estimating a probit model of the retention/attrition process\nand creating a hazard rate instrument (X) based on the inverse\nMills ratio to express the likelihood of remaining in the study.\nThe second step is to estimate the model of interest including\nthe hazard rate instrument as an independent variable (Berk &\nhas been extended to incorporate two hazard rate instruments for\ndifferent forms of attrition (Maddala, 1983) and is conveniently\nhandled in LIMDEP (Greene, 1995). The results presented\nbelow were derived with LIMDEP.\nThe test of the second hypothesis is predicated on a multi-\nplicative model; we created an interaction term to determine if\nthe relationship between obesity and functional illness is\nstronger among older people. Finally, age was broken down\ninto three categories and similar regression equations were then\nestimated. This strategy was used in order to examine if the in-\nfluence of BMI on functional illness varied by age and to aid\ninterpretation of the tests of interaction effects.\nRESULTS\nThe analysis began with BMI in its continuous form for\ncross-sectional and longitudinal models of functional illness,\nbut BMI was not significantly related to most of the functional\nillness measures. If there is a relationship between BMI and\nfunctional illness, it appears that it will not be easily detected\nunder the assumption of a linear relationship. Thus, we under-\ntook two sets of analyses. First, dummy variables for obesity\nand underweight were examined in cross-sectional and longitu-\ndinal models. Second, parallel regression models were exam-\nined using BMI-squared and BMI-cubed variables. The results\nfrom both procedures were consistent with the results of\nGalanos et al. (1994) showing that relationship between BMI\nand functional illness is not linear: Both obese and underweight\npersons manifest higher levels of functional illness on most in-\ndicators (see also Table 1). The results reported below are based\non the categorical form of BMI because of ease of interpreta-\ntion, especially the interpretation of interaction terms between\nage and body weight.\nCross-SectionalAnalysis\nThe results from Model I (additive model) shown in Table 2\nindicate that being either obese or underweight is associated\nwith higher levels of functional impairment. Further, the older\nthe person, the more extensive the functional impairment.\nModel II adds the interaction term for age and obesity. While\nthe product term is significant at/? < .05, the main effect for\nobese is nonsignificant, and the difference in the log likelihood\nfunction between Models I and II is nonsignificant (2.78;\nJaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990). Thus, the interaction model\ndoes not provide a better fit than the additive model (see also\nfootnote c of Table 2). In Models I and II, chronic conditions\nand serious or life-threatening conditions are both significantly\nrelated to functional impairment. Functional impairment is also\nhigher for unemployed and low-income persons.\nResults for self-reported functional limitation show that both\nobese and underweight participants have greater functional limi-\ntations. After controlling for morbidity and the other variables,\nTable 2.

The correspond-\nthere are no age differences on this functional illness measure,\nand the interaction of age and obese is nonsignificant. African\nAmerican and male respondents reported lower levels of func-\ntional limitation. Most other relationships are similar to what\nwas observed with impairment except that income has a\nstronger association with functional Limitation.\nWhen examining days that have been spent ill in bed, the\nPoisson models reveal some intriguing differences from the\nfirst two outcomes. Those people who reported more days ill in\nbed at Wl tended to be younger and either obese or under-\nweight. Although age and obesity do not interact in shaping\ndays ill in bed, there is a significant interaction of age and un-\nderweight: Older, underweight people have disproportionately\nfewer days ill in bed. Both types of morbidity are related to\ndays ill in bed during the past 3 months, and more days are\nlikely among women, those lacking social support, and unem-\nployed respondents. More days ill in bed are also more likely\namong more educated respondents, presumably because of a\nstronger inclination to rest and protect one's health (consistent\nwith other ACL studies; House et al., 1994).\nAlthough many similarities exist, models for hospital nights\nwere different in a few ways from the estimates for days spent\nill in bed. Obesity was associated with fewer nights hospital-\nized, but underweight was associated with more nights. Age\nwas negatively related, albeit weakly, to nights hospitalized.\nThe Age X Obesity variable was nonsignificant, but an interac-\ntion of Age X Underweight was significant and positive: Older\nunderweight persons have more nights in the hospital. We inter-\npret this in light of the sequelae of morbidity, especially serious\nillness, involving medications, loss of appetite, and physical\n1995). Persons with higher incomes, women, and nonsmokers\nhave lower rates of hospitalization, and married persons are less\nlikely to be hospitalized. Hospitalization was more likely for re-\nspondents reporting higher occupational prestige and more fre-\nquent recreational walking, perhaps reflecting more active\nhealth-protective profiles.\nLongitudinalAnalysis\nThe first step in the longitudinal analysis was estimating at-\ntrition between Wl and W2. Models were first estimated for all\nsources of attrition and then separately for mortality (n = 166)\nand all other reasons (including refusals and inability to trace,\nn = 582, not distinguished in ACL). Probit models for mortality\nreveal that deaths were more likely among respondents who\nwere older, were men, and reported less income. (Self-rated\nhealth was also included in the equation but was nonsignificant;\np > .05.) The equation for all other forms of nonresponse attri-\ntion showed that refusals and inability to trace were more likely\namong respondents who were younger, were men, were urban\nresidents, reported less income, and were missing on income at\nthen used to create selection variables for mortality and attrition\ndue to nonresponse and adjust estimates of change (Maddala,\nTable 3 presents the results of the longitudinal analyses in\nthe measures of functional illness (all independent variables are\nmeasured at baseline). Obesity does not predict change in func-\ntional impairment, but underweight respondents were more\nlikely to become impaired by W2. There are no age differences\nin functional impairment by W2, but those with more morbid-\nity also manifested increased impairment. Only the death selec-\ntion variable (X) was significant; those who died would have\nmanifested increased functional illness by W2 if they had re-\nmained in the analysis. There was no evidence of age interact-\ning with either obesity or underweight in shaping functional\nimpairment.\nThe predictors of change in functional limitation were differ-\nent from functional impairment in several respects. Obese re-\nspondents became more disabled over time on this measure, but\nthere was no significant increase in functional limitations for\nunderweight respondents. The effects due to morbidity and em-\nployment status were parallel to those for functional impair-\nment. The effects due to selection were nonsignificant. Age did\nnot interact with either obesity or underweight in models of\nchange in functional limitation.\nObesity is nonsignificant in Model I for days ill in bed, and\nthe relationship with underweight is modest. As in the cross-\nsectional analysis, age is negatively related to days ill in bed at\nW2. Note, however, when adding the interaction term for age\nand obesity in Model II that age is significant along with the in-\nteraction term (difference in the log likelihood between the\nmodels is significant). Obese and younger persons had more\ndays ill in bed at W2, but obese young people are prone to par-\nticularly high rates of days ill in bed. More days ill in bed at\nW2 were also more likely among respondents who had higher\nmorbidity and education and less occupational prestige and so-\ncial support. Women reported more days ill in bed as did urban\nresidents, those not married or employed, and past smokers.\nSelection processes did not significantly influence the results.\nModel I for overnight hospitalization shows that BMI does\nnot predict hospitalization, but age does. Model II, however,\nshows that age and overweight interact. Both obese and older\npeople are more likely to be hospitalized, but obese older people\nactually have a lower risk of hospitalization--the higherriskof\nhospitalization for obese people shrinks in later life. For both\nmeasures of functional illness days (in bed or the hospital), it ap-\npears that younger obese people are the ones who suffer the\nhighest risk. Most of the remaining significant relationships in\nthis model are consistent with the literature: Hospitalization was\nmore likely for persons with more morbidity, men, persons in a\nlower social class, urban residents, those with limited social sup-\nport, and nonworking persons.\nTo assess the robustness of the results, we performed supple-\nmentary cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses substituting\n10 separate dummy variables of the illnesses for the separate\ncounts of chronic and serious illness. The coefficients for obe-\nsity and underweight were very similar across the analyses, and\nthe pattern of significance was identical in the 16 equations. As\nanticipated, each time an illness was significant, it was posi-\ntively associated with functional illness. Of the 10 illnesses con-\nsidered, high blood pressure and arthritis were nonsignificant in\nselected cross-sectional analyses; high blood pressure, arthritis,\ncancer, and bone problems were nonsignificant in selected lon-\ngitudinal analyses. Stated differently, heart attack, diabetes,\nstroke, foot problems, lung problems, and urine control were\nsignificantly associated with the functional illness measures in\nall of the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.\nThe final phase of the analysis was to examine the relation-\nships between the independent and dependent variables across\nTable 3.

These analyses (not\npresented) generally confirmed the full sample analyses and\nmay be summarized as follows. First, obesity manifested\nstronger relationships than did underweight on most measures\nof functional illness among young and middle-aged respondents.\nSecond, body weight was not associated with W2 functional ill-\nness outcomes for older adults, but obesity was associated with\nincreased functional illness at W2 among younger adults on\nthree of the four functional illness measures. Third, most of the\nsignificant relationships between underweight and functional\nillness in the age-group analyses were observed among older\nrespondents. There is limited evidence from the age-group anal-\nyses that obesity is a major risk factor for functional illness\namong elders, but there is ample evidence to implicate obesity\nas a serious risk factor for functional illness among younger\nand middle-aged adults.\nDISCUSSION\nThis research focused on two basic research questions. The\nfirst is whether obesity is related to functional illness. Results\nfrom the ACL survey show that it is but that both underweight\nand obese persons manifest higher levels of functional illness.\nThese results support the research conducted by Galanos and\ncolleagues (1994) showing that the two extremes of BMI are at\ngreater risk of functional impairment (see also Black, Sciacca,\n& Coster, 1994). The relationships were substantial in the cross-\nsectional analyses, but also manifest in the change analysis on\nselected measures. If only a linear relationship between BMI\nand functional illness is tested, then it is quite likely that the re-\nlationship will be weak or nonexistent. Indeed, when treated\nlinearly for this analysis, BMI is not significantly related to\nmost measures of functional illness. This can explain some of\nthe inconsistency in the previous literature because several of\nthe studies reported using BMI in its linear form only. On the\nother hand, when categorical forms of BMI representing the\ntails of the distribution or polynomials are used, BMI is associ-\nated with functional illness. The implication is clear for future\nresearch: The relationship between BMI and many health out-\ncomes is probably not linear. Additional research is needed to\nspecify the form of the relationship across various health status\nindicators.\nThe second research question asks if the relationship be-\ntween obesity and functional illness is stronger with age. An in-\nteraction term for obesity and age was tested in cross-sectional\nand longitudinal analyses to answer this question. The interac-\ntion term was significant in only two of the eight equations. For\nthe most part, the relationship between obesity and functional\nillness was not conditional on age. Obesity was associated with\nmore functional illness, and this relationship held for younger\nand older persons alike. The two instances where the Age X\nObesity interaction was significant were days ill in bed and\nnights hospitalized at W2. In both instances, the relationship was\nsuch that obese older respondents had lower rates of functional\nillness. Obesity was associated with greater functional illness\nrisk, but the effect of obesity was greatest for younger respon-\ndents, not older ones (Andres, 1995). Thus, there was no sup-\nport for the hypothesis that the functional illness risk from obe-\nsity is greater in later life.\nThere arefindingsin the literature that may help explain why\nfunctional illness risks are higher for younger obese persons but\nnot for older obese persons. First, some have argued that body\nweight, either overweight or underweight, is not as consequen-\ntial to health among older people because morbidity is more\nconsequential at this life stage (Andres, 1995; Clark & Mungai,\nis a major risk factor for a host of diseases, there are a few ex-\nceptions to this rule. Fractures of the hip are less common\namong obese older people--especially older women--appar-\nently because of higher bone mass associated with more weight\nbearing, the role of adipose tissue in softening falls, or higher\nendogenous estrogen levels (Grisso et al., 1997; Willett &\nManson, 1995). Third, older people tend to lose weight when\nthey experience health problems (Launer et al, 1994); thus, hav-\ning a higher BMI may act as a protective \"buffer\" during the\nweight loss period (Diehr et al., 1998). Although these mecha-\nnisms may help to explain the findings from ACL, future re-\nsearch is needed to determine which, if any, can explain why\nfunctional illness risk is higher for young obese than older\nobese persons. Key to explicating these relationships may be\nknowledge of how long obesity and morbidity are present over\nthe life course. Unfortunately, the ACL survey does not permit\nsuch analyses.\nFindings from the ACL are helpful in showing that middle\nadulthood is when obesity seems most related to functional ill-\nness. It should be recalled that the middle adult years are also\nwhen most people gain weight (Anderson & Kannel, 1992;\nshow that excess body weight in these ages is associated with\nmore functional illness: There is a consequence for weight\ngained during these ages.\nThere are three limitations to this research that merit consid-\neration. First, the functional illness measures in the ACL are\nfairly basic; ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living\n(IADLs) are more thorough and concrete measures of physical\nfunction. Second, whereas only self-reported height and weight\nare available, the results may be a conservative estimate of as-\nsociation between obesity and functional illness (Bowman &\nDeLucia, 1992). Third, as noted above, the only BMI measures\nwere of current weight and height self-reported at the time of\ninterview. Both previous research and cumulative disadvantage\ntheory lead to expectations that lifelong obesity would have the\nstrongest effects on health (Johnston, 1985). Future research\nmeasuring when the weight gain occurred during the life course\nmay help further explain how obesity may lead to greater func-\ntional illness.\nGiven the limited follow-up period in the ACL (less than 3\nyears), future research that either follows respondents for longer\nperiods of time or collects retrospective data on weight should\nbe most beneficial for enhancing our understanding about the\nrelationship between body weight and health. Although there is\nno evidence from this investigation to support cumulative dis-\nadvantage theory, it remains a promising framework for the\ntopic if coupled with weight history data.\nIn sum, there is clear support for the first hypothesis associ-\nating obesity with greater functional illness but no evidence to\nsupport the second hypothesis that obese older adults are at\nhigher risk of functional illness. The ACL data show that the\nrelationship between obesity and functional illness is, for the\nmost part, constant over the live course. In the few instances\nwhere the relationship between obesity and functional illness\nwas conditional on age, the relationship was stronger among\nyounger and middle-aged respondents--parallel to the find-\nings on mortality (Andres, 1995). These results underscore the\nimportance of weight loss among obese young persons and\npreventing weight gain in middle age in order to minimize\nfunctional illness.\n"
