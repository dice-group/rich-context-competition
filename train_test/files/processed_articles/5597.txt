Recent research found this effect to be\nmost pronounced in congressional districts with high disease threat--a result attributed to\nan adaptive disease avoidance mechanism, whereby the association of low attractiveness\nwith poor health is particularly worrisome to voters who feel vulnerable to disease. We\nprovided a more direct test of this explanation by examining the effects of individuals' own\nhealth and age. Supporting a disease avoidance mechanism, less healthy participants\nshowed a stronger preference for more attractive contenders in U.S. Senate races than their\nhealthier peers, and this effect was stronger for older participants, who were generally less\nhealthy than younger participants. Stronger effects of health for older participants partly\nreflected the absence of positive bias toward attractive candidates among the healthiest,\nsuggesting that healthy older adults may be unconcerned about disease threat or sufficiently\nwise to ignore attractiveness.\n",

This benefit of good looks, a gift\nof birth earned through no merit, would not be of great concern if attractiveness were\ncorrelated with other attributes that are desirable in a leader. Indeed, more attractive people\nare judged as more competent, healthy, and trustworthy--important attributes in elected\nAiling voters\nofficials (Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991; Langlois et al., 2000; Zebrowitz\nand Franklin, 2014). However, attractiveness is only weakly, albeit significantly, related to\ncompetence and health, and there is no evidence for a relationship to trustworthiness\nZebrowitz et al., 2014; Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004). The unreliability of attractiveness as\na cue to these positive qualities raises the questions of why perceivers use it and which\nperceivers are most likely to do so. The present study addressed these questions by\nexamining the moderating effects of voter age and health on preferences for more attractive\ncongressional candidates.\nThe fact that people from diverse cultures as well as infants and young children--\nand even individuals with congenital prosopagnosia--show similar reactions to facial\nattractiveness suggests some universal mechanism that does not require face expertise\n(Carbon Gr\u00fcter, Gr\u00fcter, Weber, and Lueschow, 2010; Dion, 2002; Hoss and Langlois,\nhypothesis provides such a mechanism (Zebrowitz and Collins, 1997; Zebrowitz and\nRhodes, 2004). This hypothesis holds that the adaptive value of recognizing individuals\nwith diseases or bad genes has prepared us to respond to facial qualities that can mark low\nfitness. Our responses are then overgeneralized to normal individuals whose faces resemble\nthose who are unfit. Thus, on this account, we perceive unattractive people more negatively\nand eschew them as leaders because unattractive faces show more similarity to the faces of\nunfit or unhealthy individuals that are adaptive for us to recognize. Consistent with this\nexplanation, the facial metrics of congenitally anomalous faces are more similar to those of\nnormal unattractive than attractive faces (Zebrowitz, Fellous, Mignault, and Andreoletti,\n2003), attractiveness is a more accurate predictor of actual health and competence for faces\nbelow rather than above average in attractiveness (Zebrowitz et al., 2014; Zebrowitz and\nRhodes, 2004), and reactions to people who vary in attractiveness are driven more by the\nperception that \"ugly is bad\" than by the perception that \"beautiful is good\" (Griffin and\nRelated to the anomalous face overgeneralization explanation for an influence of\nfacial attractiveness on social judgments is the hypothesis that disease avoidance\nmechanisms can affect social behavior (Neuberg, Kenrick, and Schaller, 2011; Schaller and\nPark, 2011). These authors argue that a behavioral immune system has evolved to detect\nthe presence of pathogens and to facilitate the avoidance of people who may carry them,\nwith stronger avoidance in those who feel more vulnerable to infection. They also propose\novergeneralization of these disease avoidance responses, noting that a too tightly calibrated\nbehavioral immune system could miss significant pathogen risks (Neuberg et al., 2011).\nConsistent with such overgeneralization, research has linked activation of the behavioral\nimmune system to avoidance of people with physical disabilities (Park, Faulker, and\nApplying the disease avoidance mechanism to the selection of political leaders,\nWhite et al. (2013) reasoned that disease threat should increase avoidance of unhealthy-\nlooking leaders, because healthy leaders are important for societal functioning and,\nconsequently, an individual's well-being. Supporting this hypothesis, they found that\nphysical attractiveness predicted election outcomes for candidates from congressional\ndistricts with high disease threat (higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy) but not\nthose with low disease threat. Other research has shown that adaptive implications of other\nAiling voters\nenvironmental variations also can influence voter preferences for a more attractive\ncandidate. Specifically, whereas people preferred a more attractive, likeable-looking\ncandidate when asked for whom they would vote in a time of peace, they preferred a\ncandidate with a more masculine, dominant-looking appearance during a time of war\n(Little, Burriss, Jones, and Roberts, 2007). These results were attributed to the fact that\ndominant leaders may be perceived as better able to advance societal functioning and\nindividuals' well-being in wartime, whereas leaders with pro-social qualities may be\nperceived as more able to do so during peacetime.\nOne notable limitation of the White et al. (2013) study investigating effects of\ndisease threat on candidate preferences is that it did not directly investigate how an\nindividual person's level of health affects preferences for attractiveness in politicians.\nRather, it examined the relationship between macro-level health indices and electoral\nresults. In contrast, we directly examined the relationship between participants' own health\nand the degree to which attractiveness affected their voting intentions. We also investigated\nthe influence of health and candidate attractiveness on the voting intentions of both\nyounger adults as well as older adults, who have not been previously studied. Since older\nadults generally have more health concerns, their preferences provide an additional test of\nthe hypothesis that health affects the influence of attractiveness on voters' choices.\nMoreover, documenting effects in older adults has significant social implications, as they\nare more likely to vote than the younger adults who are typically studied in psychological\nexperiments. For example, the turnout rate in the 2012 presidential election was 71.9% of\n(Taylor and Lopez, 2013). Finally, our study controlled education, a variable that may have\nco-varied with the macro-level indicators of disease threat in the White et al. (2013) study\n(Lleras-Muney, 2005), and that could itself contribute to variations in the preference for\nattractive politicians. We predicted that political candidates' attractiveness would have\nmore influence on voting intentions of people who reported more health problems. We also\npredicted that the voting intentions of older adults would show a stronger response to\nattractiveness than those of younger adults.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nrecruited from a Boston area university and completed the study for course credit. Eighteen\nBoston area and were paid $25 in U.S. currency for completing the study. One additional\nolder adult (male) was dropped because he recognized politicians from more than half of\nthe elections, whereas all the other participants recognized at most three politicians. The\nnumber of participants was based on previous studies in our lab demonstrating that this\nsample size provided sufficient power to detect significant participant age differences in\nimpressions of faces, with Cohen's d effect sizes averaging .53 across ratings of healthy,\nuntrustworthy, and hostile. We stopped running participants before we ran any data\nanalyses. The research was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles for research\ninvolving human subjects expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The research protocol\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brandeis University. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants.\nAiling voters\nStimuli\ndegree to which participants recognized any candidates, we removed races for\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire (since southern New Hampshire is part of the Boston\nmedia market) as well as elections containing candidates who were previously part of\nnational-level elections or were nationally recognizable (e.g., John McCain and Rick\nPerry). In addition, we removed elections where candidates were not opposed by a major\nparty candidate. This yielded 54 elections, representing 41 states.\nFaces were selected from internet sources, and we used official campaign portraits\nwhere available. If unavailable, we used images as close to campaign portraits as possible.\nImages were cropped to 300 x 300 pixel size (6.7 cm), and backgrounds were removed and\nreplaced with a standard taupe color. Pairs of candidates were shown side by side, with the\nposition of the two candidates counterbalanced across participants and conditions.\nDependent measures\nAttractiveness ratings. Participants rated each pair of candidates on attractiveness\nby first selecting which candidate was more attractive. They then indicated how much more\nattractive they thought that candidate was on a 7-point scale, with 1 indicating a little more\nattractive, 4 indicating somewhat more attractive, and 7 indicating much more attractive.\nVote choices. After making attractiveness ratings for all candidate pairs, participants\nwere again presented with pairs of candidates and asked to choose the one for whom they\nwould vote.\nHealth measure. A measure of functional limitations (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992)\nwas taken from a self-report survey completed after all other measures. We summed\nparticipants' responses to a 10-part question that presented several activities and asked\n\"Does your health now limit you in these activities?\" The tasks were: (1) vigorous\nactivities, such as running, lifting heavy objects; (2) moderate activities, such as moving a\ntable, pushing a vacuum cleaner; (3) lifting or carrying groceries; (4) climbing several\nflights of stairs; (5) climbing one flight of stairs; (6) bending, kneeling or stooping; (7)\nwalking more than a mile; (8) walking several blocks; (9) walking one block; (10) bathing\nor dressing yourself. Responses were coded as 1 (Not at all), 2 (A little), and 3 (A lot) so\nthat higher scores signified greater functional limitations. This measure has been validated\nin previous research that demonstrated a relationship to objective indicators of disability\n(Syddall, Martin, Harwood, Cooper, and Aihie Sayer, 2009), as well as a sensitivity to\nvarious health protective factors (Lachman and Agrigoroaei, 2010).\nOther measures. Older adults were screened using the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh, 1975), all scoring between 26 and 30 (M =\n28.7, SD = 1.53). Level of education was coded for highest level attained, from 1 (no high\nschool diploma) to 7 (Doctorate degree). Additional measures included tests of visual\nacuity, contrast sensitivity, facial recognition, a pattern comparison task to assess\nprocessing speed, and the Wisconsin card sorting task to assess executive function (see\nProcedure\nAfter obtaining informed consent, participants were shown photographs of pairs of\npoliticians and were asked to rate them on various attributes. Participants were told that\nAiling voters\nthese were real politicians running for office and that if at any point in the study they\nrecognized anyone, they were to write down who that politician was. Since none of the\nparticipants retained in the study recognized more than two politicians, we included all the\nraces in the analysis.\nParticipants rated the attractiveness of the candidates as well as three other traits\n(trustworthy, competent, and babyfaced) that are not reported because they are not relevant\nto our hypotheses. Ratings were made in one of the following two orders: trustworthy,\ncompetent, attractive, and babyfaced or competent, trustworthy, babyfaced, and attractive.\nThe attractiveness rating used the following format: Participants were shown faces of two\npoliticians on the computer screen, labeled Politician X and Politician Y, with the\nplacement of each face on the right or left side of the screen counterbalanced across\nparticipants. Participants were asked to choose which politician was more attractive, with\nno time constraints, and they indicated their choice by pressing a button labeled \"Candidate\nX\" or \"Candidate Y.\" Next, participants were presented with a rating scale and instructions\nstating that \"you chose Candidate (X or Y) as more attractive. Please indicate the degree to\nwhich you feel Candidate (X or Y) is more attractive than the other candidate.\" Participants\nmade this rating on a 7-point scale, with anchors of 1 (only a little more) and 7 (much\nmore). Participants rated all of the pairs of politicians using this format on one rating scale\nbefore moving to the next. After all the trait ratings were completed, participants indicated\ntheir voting preference. Using the same format as the attractiveness ratings, they first made\na dichotomous choice, and then rated how much more they preferred to vote for the\ncandidate they chose. We analyzed only the dichotomous voting choice, since this has more\necological validity as a proxy for actual voting behavior.\nResults\nOverview of analysis\nWe used a logistic multilevel model to predict voting choices from participants' age\n(scored as 1 for younger adults and 2 for older adults), self-reported health, education level,\nand their ratings of candidates' attractiveness in each senate race. Logistic multilevel\nmodels were performed within R using the \"lme4\" package for generalized multilevel\nmodeling. Participant and Senate race were both random factors in the model, with race\nnested within participant. We included all interactions between variables except for\neducation level, which was included only as a control variable. Variables were not centered\nbecause the model had no collinearity issues and all variables of interest had a meaningful\nzero value. For each race, one candidate was arbitrarily assigned to be the \"positive\"\ncandidate and the other was assigned to be the \"negative\" candidate. The dependent\nvariable was the candidate for whom participants chose to vote, with responses coded as 0\nif it was the negative candidate and 1 if it was the positive one. Since the attractiveness of\neach candidate was rated relative to the opponent, we calculated the attractiveness predictor\nas follows: If the participant rated the positive candidate as the more attractive one, then\nratings ranged from 1 to 7, with a 7 indicating that this candidate was much more attractive\nthan the opponent and 1 indicating that this candidate was only a little bit more attractive\nthan the opponent. If the participant rated the negative candidate as the more attractive one,\nthen ratings ranged from -1 to -7, with a -7 indicating that this candidate was much less\nattractive than the opponent and -1 indicating that this candidate was only a little bit less\nAiling voters\nattractive than the opponent. Scoring attractiveness in this manner yielded a value for each\ncandidate that reflected his or her attractiveness relative to the opponent.\nHealth and control variables\nAs shown in Table 1, older adults reported having significantly more functional\nlimitations than younger adults, as predicted. Older adults also reported significantly higher\nlevels of education, which is consistent with previous research comparing community-\ndwelling older adult research volunteers with college undergraduates (e.g., Boshyan,\nZebrowitz, Franklin, McCormick, and Carr\u00e9, 2014; Zebrowitz, Franklin, Hillman, and Boc,\n2013). Age differences for the measures of vision and cognitive function are also consistent\nwith previous studies comparing college students with community-dwelling older adults,\ndemonstrating the representativeness of our sample. Specifically, older raters performed\nworse than younger raters on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity as well as on a speeded\npattern comparison task, consistent with decreases in processing speed in older adulthood\n(Salthouse, 1996), and on the Wisconsin card sorting task, consistent with age-related\ndecreases in executive function (Daniels, Toth, and Jacoby, 2006). In contrast to poorer\nperformance by older adults on the preceding measures, they performed better than\nyounger adults on a vocabulary task, consistent with their higher education level and the\nmaintenance of crystallized intelligence in older adulthood (Horn and Cattell, 1967). We\nalso found that, for older adults, more functional limitations (poorer health) were associated\nwith slower processing speed on the pattern comparison test, r(16) = -.69, p < .01, and with\nlower scores on the Shipley vocabulary test, r(16) = -.66, p < .01, but not with any of the\nother control measures, ps > .14. None of the correlations between health and cognitive\nmeasures were significant for younger adults, ps > .18.\nVote choices\nThe multi-level model coefficients are reported in Table 2. The results revealed a\nsignificant effect of attractiveness, with candidates who were judged more attractive than\ntheir opponents more likely to receive votes. However, this effect was moderated by\ninteractions between attractiveness and participant age and between attractiveness and\nfunctional limitations.\nAs predicted, the voting choices of less healthy participants, with more functional\nlimitations, showed a marginally stronger response to candidates' attractiveness. However,\ncontrary to prediction, the voting choices of older adults showed a significantly weaker\nresponse to candidates' attractiveness than did the choices of younger adults. These two-\nway interactions were qualified by a significant three-way interaction between\nattractiveness, participant age, and functional limitations. As shown in Figure 1, the weaker\noverall response to attractiveness shown by older than younger adults was largely due to\nthe healthier older adults who had few functional limitations. The voting choices of both\nyounger and older adults with many functional limitations showed a strong preference for\ncandidates who were more attractive than their opponents. Compared with relatively\nhealthy older adults, those with many functional limitations were more likely to choose\ncandidates who were more attractive than their opponents. The results for younger adults\nshowed the same pattern, but the differences between those who were relatively unhealthy\nand healthy were much smaller.\nAiling voters\nTable 1.

The y-axis reflects likelihood to vote for a particular candidate. The plot was\nderived using the regression equation in Table 2. Values for many and few FL are\nplotted by using values at +1 and -1 standard deviation from the mean, respectively.\nValues used in the plot for \"Much less attractive\" and \"Much more attractive\" ranged\nfrom -7 to +7 because these were the numbers which reflected the entire range of the\nrating scale used.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with previous research, participants preferred voting for the more\nattractive of two candidates in senatorial races (Verhulst et al., 2010; White et al., 2013).\nThis preference for attractive candidates was significant not only for younger \"voters,\" but\nalso older ones, not previously studied. It also was stronger for participants who reported\nmore health problems, as predicted. Contrary to the prediction that older adults would\nrespond more to attractiveness, older adults showed a weaker response overall. However, a\nsignificant three-way interaction did support the predicted age difference. The tendency for\nattractiveness to have more influence on candidate preferences among participants with\npoorer health was stronger for older than younger adults. Thus the preference for more\nattractive candidates was moderated both by participant age and health, consistent with the\nsuggestion that these two variables influence the engagement of a disease avoidance\nmechanism that can influence preferences for more fit leaders. This operation of a disease\navoidance mechanism complements evidence that increasing mortality salience can\nstrengthen particular political preferences (Landau et al., 2004), with individual differences\nmoderating whether conservative or liberal preferences are augmented (Weise et al., 2008).\nOur results provide stronger support than previous research for a disease avoidance\nexplanation for the preference for more attractive leaders. First, our finding that\nattractiveness had a greater influence on voting preferences of individuals who are\nAiling voters\nthemselves less healthy rules out many alternative explanations for the effect demonstrated\nat a macro level among people who live in areas with higher vs. lower disease threat (White\net al., 2013), and we have specifically ruled out education level as a confounding variable\n(Lleras-Muney, 2005). Second, our finding that poorer health magnified responses to\nattractiveness more for older than younger adults supports a disease avoidance mechanism,\ninasmuch older adults had poorer health than did younger adults. Finally, the tendency for\ndisease avoidance processes to be activated by health-related functional limitations is\nconsistent with previous evidence that disease avoidance processes are activated by\nphysical disabilities in others (Park et al., 2003).\nAlthough one might suggest that the effect of poor health to magnify the preference\nfor attractive candidates could reflect associated cognitive limitations that increase heuristic\nprocessing rather than a disease avoidance mechanism, there are three arguments against\nthis interpretation. First, correlations between health and cognitive function were\nsignificant for older, but not for younger adults, which means one would have to argue that\nheuristic processing might explain the results for older adults, whereas disease avoidance\nexplains the results for younger adults. Second, as discussed below, the greater impact of\nhealth on older than younger adult preferences for more attractive candidates was\nattributable at least as much to the fact that older people with relatively few health\nproblems showed no positive bias toward more attractive political candidates as to the fact\nthat those with many health problems showed a stronger attractiveness bias. Finally,\nvariations in the use of heuristic processing cannot account for the results reported by\nWhite et al. (2013) unless one argues that heuristic processing is greater in areas with\nhigher disease threat. As that seems unlikely, a disease avoidance mechanism has the\nadvantage of parsimony in its ability to explain the results of both studies as well as the\nresults for both older and younger adults in the present study. Finally, it also should be\nnoted that our finding that preferences for attractive leaders are modulated by individual\ndifferences in health status is consistent with evidence that individual differences also\nmodulate preferences for attractiveness in other contexts, such as mate choices (Little, Burt,\nPenton-Voak, and Perrett, 2001; Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2002; Little,\nAs noted above, the greater impact of health on older than younger adult\npreferences for more attractive candidates was partly due to the fact that older people with\nrelatively few health problems showed no positive bias toward more attractive political\ncandidates. This contrasts with abundant evidence for an attractiveness halo effect in all\nwalks of life and suggests that the healthiest older adults may be unconcerned about disease\nthreat or are sufficiently wise to ignore attractiveness when choosing among political\ncandidates. The finding that individuals with more health problems, especially older\npeople, are particularly vulnerable to an attractiveness halo effect in their vote choices\nsuggests the value of \"inoculating\" these individuals against unwise decisions, as\nattractiveness is only weakly related to many qualities that are desirable in a politician.\n"
