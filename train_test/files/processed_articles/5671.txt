    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paradigm of the rubber hand illusion was applied to a shadow to determine whether the body-\nshadow is a good candidate for the alternative belonging to our body. Three kinds of shadows, a\nphysical hand, a hand-shaped cloth, and a rectangle cloth, were tested for this purpose. The\nquestionnaire results showed that both anatomical similarity and visuo-proprioception correlation\nwere effective in enhancing illusory ownership of the shadow. According to the proprioceptive drift\nmeasurement, whether the shadow purely originated from the physical body was a critical factor in\nyielding the significantly positive drift. Thus, results demonstrated that the shadow can distort\nillusory ownership with the rubber hand illusion paradigm, but the proprioception was clearly\ndistorted only when the body-shadow was purely applied. This implies the presence of special\ncognitive processing to discriminate the self-body shadow from the others.\n",

In this imaginary world, touching the body-shadow is identical to touching the\nphysical body. Similar beliefs, such that an attack to the body-shadow is equivalent to\nphysical body, have been found in various parts of the world, suggesting a special\ninvolvement with the body-shadows in cognitive processing.\nAlthough seeing a shadow of an object is found to have a positive effect on recognizing the\nobject accurately in many studies (e.g., Castiello, 2001; Elder, Trithart, Pintilie, & MacLean,\n2004; Rensink & Cavanagh, 2004) or even to lead to a misunderstanding of the object's\ntrajectory (e.g., Kersten, Mamassian, & Knil, 1997), fewer studies have examined the effect\nof seeing the body-shadow. Exceptionally, Pavani and colleagues have been continuously\nexploring the characteristics of the body-shadow in a visuo-tactile interference situation for\nmore than a decade (Pavani & Castiello, 2004; Pavani & Galfano, 2007; Pavani, Rigo, &\nGalfano, 2014). In their research, merely seeing a single hand-shadow was found to cue tactile\nCorresponding author:\nEmail: kenrikodaka@gmail.com\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nattention to the physical hand casting the shadow, compared with the other hand;\nimportantly, this cueing effect significantly declined when the shadow was transformed\ninto a polygonal shape or when it was replaced with a static hand-shaped hand picture.\nIn addition, the polygonal shadow was also found to develop a cueing effect over time,\nprobably due to the spatio-temporal correlation between the hand and the shadow. These\nresults, as has been clearly discussed in their respective studies, remind us of the relation\nbetween a tool and physical hand when using the tool in an active way; the tool use extends\nthe visual receptive field to represent the peri-personal space so that the tool is encoded as an\nextension of the body (Iriki, Tanaka, & Iwamura, 1996; Witt, Proffitt, & Epstein, 2005;\nYamamoto & Kitazawa, 2001). A recent report by Kuylen, Balas, and Thomas (2014),\nshowing that subjects underestimate the distance to a target when the body-shadow is cast\nin the direction of the target on the ground, is a further direct demonstration of the validity of\nthis analogy. In this way, recent limited studies on the body-shadow implied that the\ncognitive processing of the body-shadow is overlapped with that of the physical body\nin the brain.\nTherefore, it is probable that the body-shadow is processed as a substitution or extension\nof the physical body casting that shadow, but it is so difficult to assume that the participants\nin the related experiments felt their shadow just as a part of the body amid the relevant\nperceptual distortion. In other words, the related studies have demonstrated that the body-\nshadow can affect the cognitive processing in a level of body-schema but not in a level of\nbody image (Gallagher, 2005). This seems obvious, considering that we do not misunderstand\nthe body-shadow as a part of the body in general situations. The question then is whether\nthere is a way to somehow translate the body-shadow into an alternative belonging to our\nphysical body?\nAn obvious feeling we naturally have for each part of the self-body is called body\nownership. Rubber hand illusion (RHI) can provide body ownership to a fake hand based\non spatio-temporal correlation between visual and tactile stimulation (Botvinick & Cohen,\n1998). Another type of RHI that has attracted increasing interest over the last few years is\nwhere we see a rubber hand on the top of a desk moving in sync with the movement of a hand\nunder a desk, called moving RHI. Researchers have somehow controlled an artificial hand\n(hand model, computer graphics, and a robot hand) coordinated with the hand movement,\nthus completing the visuo-proprioception correlation (e.g., Braun, Thorne, Hildebrandt &\nPerez-Marcos, Ehrsson, & Sanchez-Vives, 2009). Naively speaking, the body-shadow seems a\nquick way to realize such a correlation in a more natural manner considering that the motion\nof the body-shadow is originally associated with the physical body; we do not need to add\nanything for the visuo-proprioception correlation. In addition, RHI is found to be applicable\neven to two-dimensional hand appearance (e.g., captured video in Pavani & Zampini, 2007;\nhand drawing in Pasqualotto & Proulx, 2015). Despite the body-shadow satisfying the\nrequirements for the ownership distortion, no research has been directly focused on the\nbody-shadow in the RHI paradigm.\nIn this research, four shadow environments were designed for illusion induction to\nexamine the effect of body-shadow in RHI (Figure 1). Specifically, Hand\u00fe and\nHandshape\u00c0 showed the hand's or hand-shaped cloth's shadow, whereas Rectangle\u00fe and\nRectangle\u00c0 showed the shadow of rectangle cloth. In addition, the shadow of Hand\u00fe\nand Rectangle\u00fe (active shadows) moved in sync with the hand movement, whereas\nHandshape\u00c0 and Rectangle\u00c0 (static shadows) remained stable regardless of the hand\nmovement. The participant was asked either to move the physical hand back and forth\n(active trial) or to not move (static trial) in the illusion induction. The strength of the\n2 i-Perception\nbody ownership toward the shadow was analyzed on the basis of the questionnaire rating and\nthe proprioceptive drift measurement.\nResults\nFirst, ownership statements for both static and active trials were analyzed using a three-way\nANOVA with within-subject factors: shadow type (Hand\u00fe, Handshape\u00c0, Rectangle\u00fe,\nRectangle\u00c0), hand movements (static trial vs. active trial), and statement type (illusion vs.\ncontrol). The results (see top of Figure 3) revealed a significant main effect of shadow type,\ndid not yield any significant effect, F(1,15) \u00bc 0.00, p \u00bc .98, n.s. A follow-up test with simple\neffects analysis revealed that the static trial was accompanied by a significant predominance\nof the average rating for the ownership illusion statements over that of the ownership control\n2.83, p \u00bc .10, n.s., whereas such a significant trend was only shown in the active shadows\nIn addition, multiple comparisons using Ryan's method (Horn, 1981) revealed that the\nhand shadow had significantly greater scores for the illusion ownership rating than\nthe rectangle shadow in the static trial (p < .001 for Hand\u00fe vs. Rectangle\u00fe and\nHandshape\u00c0 vs. Rectangle\u00c0). Finally, the active trial provided significantly higher\nratings for the illusion ownership statements as compared with the static trial for the\nRectangle\u00fe), whereas a significant trend toward the opposite direction was found for\nfor Rectangle\u00c0.\nFigure 1. Four kinds of shadows were tested in the experiment where only the active (\u00fe) shadow on the\ntop screen moved in sync with the hand movement on the middle plate. In the static (\u00c0) shadow, the hand-\nshaped or rectangle cloth, which was large enough to cover the physical hand movement on the middle plate,\nwas placed on the bottom plate.\nKodaka and Kanazawa 3\nFigure 3. The top graphs represent the results of the questionnaire agreement, where all statistical\nsignificances were calculated based on ANOVA. The bottom graphs represent the results of the\nproprioceptive drift where only the Hand\u00fe with gaze measurement yielded a significant positive drift\ncompared with zero, using the paired two-tailed t-test (*p <.05, **p <.01, ***p <.001).\nFigure 2. This diagram shows the experimental procedure for one session. The static and active trials\nwere held one after the other following the common pre-illusion proprioception measurement. Each static or\nactive illusion induction follows the post-illusion proprioception measurement and the questionnaire.\nThe order of the trials in a session was counterbalanced among participants.\n4 i-Perception\nNext, agency statements for the active trial were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with\nwithin-subject factors shadow type and statement type and revealed a significant main effect\nthat the active trial was accompanied by a significant predominance of the average rating for\nthe agency statements over that of the agency control statements only for active shadows,\nFinally, we analyzed proprioception change. Prior to the analysis, the proprioceptive drift of\neach participant was calculated for each sight condition (eyes-open and eyes-closed) using a\ncommon pre-illusion proprioception of the right hand (baseline), which was pooled and\naveraged per sight condition to restrain dispersion. The obtained proprioceptive drifts\n(post-illusion proprioceptive height minus pre-illusion proprioceptive height) were analyzed\nusing a three-way ANOVA with within-subject factors shadow type, hand movement, and sight\ntype (eyes-open vs. eyes-closed). The results (see lower left of Figure 3) revealed a significant\nwhereas hand movement did not yield a significant effect, F(1,15) \u00bc 0.57, p \u00bc .46, n.s. In\naddition, the multiple comparisons (Ryan's method) under the eyes-open measurement\ndemonstrated that the drift for Hand\u00fe was significantly higher than that of the three other\nshadows (p < .004 vs. Handshape \u00c0 , p < .001 vs. Rectangle\u00fe, and p < .001 vs. Rectangle\u00c0).\nFinally, one-tailed Welch's t-test comparison with zeroes showed that Hand\u00fe had a significant\npositive drift in both the static and active trials with the eyes-open measurement but not with the\ntrial, whereas the other shadows did not have any significant effect.\nDiscussion\nThe questionnaire analysis revealed that both the anatomic similarity to the body-part and\nthe visuo-proprioception correlation were effective in enhancing illusory ownership.\nThis demonstrates that the shadow could distort illusory ownership with the RHI\nparadigm. In contrast, these effects on the proprioceptive drift were uncertain. In fact,\nthere was no significant difference in the drift between the static and active trials,\nregardless of the type of the shadow shape. In addition, the hand-shaped cloth's shadow\n(Handshape\u00c0) did not yield a significantly greater drift than the rectangle cloth's shadows in\nany situations. Thus, the proprioceptive drift was less sensitive to both the anatomic\nsimilarity and the visuo-proprioception correlation as compared with the illusory\nownership. These points support the recent view that the proprioceptive distortion does\nnot have a causal link with a feeling of limb ownership (Abdulkarim & Ehrsson, 2016).\nAs is unusual for the study of RHI, we tested the proprioceptive drift measurement not\nonly in the eyes-closed situation but also with eyes open toward the shadow (eyes-open\nmeasurement) to probe the effect of seeing the shadow in detail. Contrary to the former\nreports with the other artificial hands, all the shadows, including the body-shadow, did not\nyield the significant positive drift in the eyes-closed measurement, even for the active trial.\nAlthough we do not have a convincing explanation for this disagreement, it is invalid to\nsuppose that this is consistently reproducible considering that we found the opposite trend\nfor the body-shadow in some preliminary experiments. With the eyes-open measurement, the\nphysical hand's shadow (Hand\u00fe) was the only shadow that provided with the significant\npositive drift; notably, its drift was also significantly greater than for the hand-shaped\nshadow. Thus, the proprioceptive drift did not occur merely because the subjects see the\nhand-shaped shadow; the shadow should be the innocent body-shadow. Here, it is also\nKodaka and Kanazawa 5\nremarkable that even the static trial yielded the significant positive drift toward the body-\nshadow. As the static trial did not involve the physical hand movement, the results indicate\nthat just seeing the body-shadow results in visuo-proprioceptive recalibration. In the study of\nRHI, a few studies have reported that changes in hand proprioception can occur even\nwithout visuo-tactile correlation (e.g., Durgin, Evans, Dunphy, Klostermann & Simmons,\n2007; Rohde, Di Luca, & Ernst, 2011). Considering that merely hand-shaped shadow did not\nyield such a distortion, it is valid to suppose that there is a special screening to join the group\nof artificial hand capable of inducing the drift just by seeing; the body-shadow seemingly has\nthis membership. In summary, the critical factor to yield the significant distortion of the\nproprioception was determined by whether or not the shadow had purely originated from\nthe physical body, implying the presence of special cognitive processing to discriminate the\nself-body shadow from the others.\nMethods\nIn total, 16 students (four females and 12 males, 18\u00ad27 years) participated in the experiment.\nAll participants were recruited from the Faculty of Design and Architecture, Nagoya City\nUniversity, and signed informed consent prior to their participation. All participants received\na book of tokens as compensation (1000 Yen). All experiments were conducted in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocols were approved by the ethics committee\nof the Nagoya City University.\nWe set up three acrylic transparent plates vertically at a suitable interval, where the\nparticipant could see a shadow from any of the three kinds of objects (a right hand, a\nhand-shaped cloth, or a rectangle cloth). They could be viewed on the screen of the top\nplate via a light source installed on the floor, with the palm of the right hand on the middle\nplate, 12 cm below the top plate. The shadow on the top screen approximately magnified\nthe objects below by 5% to 10%. Four shadow environments were designed for illusion\ninduction: first, an active hand shadow (Hand\u00fe) where the top plate shows the right hand's\nshadow in a straightforward manner; second, a static, hand-shaped shadow (Handshape\u00c0)\nshowing the shadow of the hand-shaped cloth (on the bottom panel) that remained stable\nregardless of the hand movement; third, an active rectangle shadow (Rectangle\u00fe) showing the\nshadow of a rectangle cloth (clinging to the right hand) that moved in sync with the hand\nmovement; and fourth, a static rectangle shadow (Rectangle\u00c0) showing the shadow of the\nrectangle cloth (on the bottom panel) that remained stable regardless of the hand movement\n(Figure 1).\nFigure 2 depicts the experimental procedure for one session. At the beginning of each\nsession, the experimenter positioned the right hand of the blindfolded participant in place on\nthe middle plate. Next, the participants were asked to indicate at what height they felt their\nright hand was by touching a board attached to the left side of the acrylic plates. To identify\nthe position of each participant's left index finger, the board was covered with a sheet of\npaper with a millimeter grid and the experimenter used a pen to mark the position\ncorresponding to the central part of the participant's fingernail on this paper. The\nmeasurements were classified into two--eyes-closed and eyes-open, which were\ncounterbalanced within each participant. Specifically, this proprioception report was done\nwith the participants' eyes closed (eyes-closed measurement) or with the eyes gazing toward\nthe black cloth covering the top screen (eyes-open measurement). Next, they were asked to\nlook at the shadow on the top screen for 1 min while not moving their hand (static trial) or\nmoving their hand back and forth (active trial). Note that this factor--hand movement (static\nor active trial)--is independent from the classification of static or active shadows. Thus, the\n6 i-Perception\nillusion induction was accompanied by the shadow's movement only when the active trial was\napplied for the active shadows (Hand\u00fe and Rectangle\u00fe); the static trial did not involve the\nshadow's movement for not only the static shadows but also the active shadows. Subsequent\nto this illusion induction, they were asked again to localize the right hand with the sight\ncondition that was applied at the pre-illusion stage. Notably, the eyes-open measurement was\ndone without the participants taking their eyes off the shadow to measure proprioceptive\nheight during the prior illusion induction as accurately as possible. Quickly after they\nanswered four- or six-item questions (see lower right of Figure 3), including statements\nrelating to ownership (for both trials) and agency (only for the active trial), the trial was\nswitched to another one. Half of the participants first took the static trial and second the\nactive trial during a single session, whereas the remaining participants took the opposite.\nAll participants experienced eight sessions (two sight conditions \u00c2 four shadow conditions),\nwhich were allocated randomly to the participants but with a constraint that the same sight\nor shadow condition was not applied twice in a row. At least a 30-s break was taken at the\nend of each session to restrain the effect of the preceding condition.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15K21281.\nReferences\nAbdulkarim, Z., & Ehrsson, H.
