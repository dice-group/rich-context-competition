Patients were categorized into three groups based on the\ntiming of WF administration in relation to S-1 oral chemotherapy: group A patients received WF\nbefore S-1 chemotherapy; group B patients started WF during S-1 chemotherapy; and group C\npatients started WF after completing S-1 chemotherapy.\nResults: A total of 21 patients with gastric cancer were included in the study; group A\n(n \u00bc 8), group B (n \u00bc 10) and group C (n \u00bc 3). Seven patients (88%) in group A, seven (70%) in\ngroup B and all of the patients (100%) in group C had >2.5 PT-INR. There was no significant\ndifference in the time-to-exceed 2.5 PT-INR between groups A and B.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that the timing of WF use in relation to S-1 chemotherapy\nmight not be an important factor for PT-INR, although the low patient numbers included in the\nstudy should be taken into consideration.\n",

This study was designed to\nevaluate the effects of the timing of WF\nadministration in relation to S-1 oral chemo-\ntherapy in patients with gastric cancer.\nPatients and methods\nParticipants and study design\nThis study was conducted as a retrospective\nchart review of patients with gastric cancer\nwho received WF and S-1. Patients were\nidentified from a computer-generated list\nproduced by the pharmacy database, which\nis managed by the Division of Pharmacy,\nNational Cancer Center Hospital East,\nKashiwa, Japan, of patients treated for\npatients had gastric cancer, the specific\nreason for WF use and the S-1 chemother-\napy regimen used varied between patients.\nAccording to clinical guidelines for deep\nvein thrombosis,2 the baseline of INR is\ndefined as 2.5. The majority of patients used\nWF for deep vein thrombosis, but there is\nno standard baseline for WF PT-INR in\ncancer patients, therefore, >2.5 PT-INR\nwas defined as a drug interaction event\nbetween S-1 and WF in this study. This\npresent study defined 2.5 PT-INR as the\nupper limit of the laboratory data for an\nadequate anticoagulant effect. Subject-\nspecific information, such as age, sex,\nchemotherapy regimen, initial PT-INR, pur-\npose of WF use and initial WF dose was\ncollected from electronic medical databases.\nThe adverse events due to WF were evaluated\nby oncologists according to the Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events\nThe study endpoints were: (i) the incidence\nof excess 2.5 PT-INR; (ii) the time-to-exceed\n2.5 PT-INR; (iii) the time-to-maximum\nPT-INR; and (iv) adverse drug reactions to\nWF. To analyse the differences due to the\ntiming of WF administration for S-1 oral\nchemotherapy, the patients were categorized\ninto three groups based on the WF adminis-\ntration timing in relation to S-1 oral chemo-\ntherapy; group A comprised of patients who\nhad already received WF before S-1 chemo-\ntherapy; group B comprised of patients who\nstarted WF during S-1 chemotherapy; and\ngroup C comprised of patients who started\nWF after finishing S-1 chemotherapy.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the National\nCancer Center Hospital East (approval\nive chart review study, the need to obtain\ninformed patient consent was waived.\nChemotherapy regimens\nAll patients received a chemotherapy regi-\nmen that was registered with the Division of\nPharmacy, National Cancer Center Hospital\nEast and generated by a computerized pro-\nvider order entry (CPOE) system. The val-\nidity of the chemotherapy regimen that was\nselected by the CPOE system was evaluated\nby the Division of Pharmacy. After the\nreview process, the Division of Pharmacy\nbuilt the protocol into the order template in\nthe CPOE system. After the template was\napproved, the oncologist only needed to\nchoose the name of the regimen to order\nthe chemotherapy on each patient's elec-\ntronic medical record. The CPOE utilized\nweight and height to calculate the dose of the\ncomponents of the chemotherapy regimen\nand the template provided the administra-\ntion sequence for the anticancer agents,\nalong with any supportive medicines and\nhydration that the oncologist had authorized\nfor the specific protocol. Therefore, all\npatients who had a given chemotherapy\nregimen had essentially the same treatment.\nThis study evaluated patients who received\nany one of the following three chemotherapy\nregimens: S-1 monotherapy,21 S-1\u00fecisplatin\n(CDDP) chemotherapy22 and docetaxel\n(DOC)\u00feCDDP \u00fe S-1 chemotherapy.23\nPT-INR measurements\nDue to the retrospective nature of this\nanalysis, it was not possible to control the\nfrequency and timing of the blood sampling.\nThe PT-INR testing frequency was based on\nthe chemotherapy cycle that was used. S-1\nmonotherapy was normally performed in\nan outpatient setting, so the PT-INR test\nwas performed at each outpatient clinic visit.\nThe outpatient examination was performed\nonce weekly at first, and after the estab-\nlishment of a stable PT-INR, the exam-\nination changed to either biweekly or\nmonthly. The S-1 \u00fe CDDP chemotherapy\nand DOC \u00fe CDDP \u00fe S-1 chemotherapy\nregimens were performed in an inpatient\nsetting, but after discharge from hospital,\noncologists closely monitored the patients\nand examined the PT-INR on a weekly or\nbiweekly basis. To evaluate and compare\nany potential drug\u00addrug interactions\nbetween S-1 and WF, the mean PT-INR\nfor the time-to-exceed 2.5 PT-INR for the\nfirst time and the mean PT-INR for the time-\nto-maximum PT-INR were determined.\nRoutine venous blood samples were\ntaken in order to determine haematological\nparameters such as white and red blood cell\ncounts. PT-INR was measured using a\nThromborel\u00d5 S Kit (Siemens Healthcare\nDiagnostics, Marburg, Germany) and a\nHealthcare Diagnostics) following the\nmanufacturer's instructions. PT-INR was\nmeasured within 24 h of blood collection.\nIn brief, venous blood (9 parts) was carefully\nmixed with 1 part sodium citrate solution\n(0.11 mol/l), avoiding the formation of a\nfoam. The blood specimen was centrifuged\nand then stored at room temperature to\nprevent cold activation of Factor VII. The\ncitrated plasma (100 ml) was incubated for\n1 min at 37C in a test tube prewarmed\nReagent prewarmed to 37C was added to\nSystem was used to determine the coagula-\ntion time.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 22.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Bivariate analysis, Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test or log-rank test were used\nto examine the time-to-events due to a drug\u00ad\ndrug interaction between S-1 and WF.\nFisher's exact probability test was used for\ncategorical variables. A P-value < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThis retrospective chart review identified 21\npatients with gastric cancer who were\nadministered WF and S-1. There were\neight patients in group A, 10 in group B\nand three in group C. Table 1 presents the\ndemographic and clinical characteristics of\nthe study participants. There were no sig-\nnificant differences in the median age, sex\ndistribution or initial PT-INR between the\nthree groups (Mann\u00adWhitney U-test and\nFisher's exact probability test). The most\ncommon chemotherapy regimen was S-1\nmonotherapy, while group B had five\npatients who had the S-1 \u00fe CDDP regimen.\nPatients used WF for a variety of indica-\ntions, but the most frequent reasons were to\nprevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary\nembolism due to cancer and chemotherapy\ntreatment.

In group B,\nfive patients underwent heparinization\nbefore switching to oral WF. No patients\nexperienced bleeding in groups B or C.\nDiscussion\nFrom the PT-INR results obtained in this\npresent study, the timing of WF administra-\ntion appeared not to be a significant factor\nin the drug\u00addrug interactions between WF\nand S-1, a fluoropyrimidine-based com-\nbination of oral chemotherapy agents.\nHowever, it should be noted that the patient\nnumbers in this present study were low and\nshould be taken into consideration when\ndrawing any conclusions. There have been\nseveral reports that have examined the inci-\ndence of drug interactions between S-1 and\nWF and the time-to-exceed the therapeutic\nrange of PT-INR due to an S-1 drug inter-\naction.16\u00ad18 The mean time-to-exceed the\nupper limit of PT-INR was approximately\nstudy, as well as those of other studies,16\u00ad18\nshow that neither the initial PT-INR nor the\ninitial dose of WF were important factors in\nthe drug\u00addrug interaction between S-1 and\nWF. A metabolite of S-1, 5-FU, diminishes\nCYP2C9, so the concurrent use of S-1 and\nWF results in a delay of WF metabolism.7\nThe adverse drug reaction of bleeding due\nto WF use was observed in two patients in\ngroup A. It was difficult to manage this\ndrug\u00addrug interaction. None of the patients\nTable 1.

First, it was limited\nto a specific chemotherapeutic regimen and\nonly included Japanese patients with gastric\ncancer. Secondly, even though most of the\npatients had the PT-INR test weekly or\nbiweekly after the concurrent use of WF\nand S-1, the PT-INR test was not measured\nwithin the same period due to the retrospect-\nive nature of the study. Thirdly, the study\nonly evaluated 21 patients with gastric\ncancer who concomitantly used WF and\nS-1 for the period of the study. The patient\nnumbers were limited because, in an attempt\nto eliminate bias, the study focused on\npatients with gastric cancer and their treat-\nment with S-1-based chemotherapy regi-\nmens. Gastric cancer was selected because\nit is the most prevalent cancer in Japan. Even\nthough the number of patients was limited, it\nwas worthwhile evaluating this study popu-\nlation because of its rarity. However, the\nnumber of patients might have been insuffi-\ncient to evaluate the differences due to the\ntiming of WF administration in relation to\nS-1 chemotherapy use. Further studies to\nevaluate the effects of the timing of WF\nand S-1 use in patients with cancer are\nneeded.\nIn conclusion, to the best of our know-\nledge, this retrospective chart review study is\nthe first report to show that the timing of\nWF administration does not appear to be a\nsignificant factor in the drug\u00addrug inter-\naction that takes place between S-1, a\nfluoropyrimidine-based oral combination,\nand WF, although the low patient numbers\nincluded in the study should be taken into\nconsideration. There were two cases of\nbleeding in group A, but these did not\noccur in the initial phase of WF administra-\ntion. Therefore, the potential for an adverse\ndrug reaction remains a concern during the\nwhole period of the concomitant use of WF\nTable 2.
