All\nsubjects completed the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire\npreoperatively and at least 1 year postoperatively.\nResults: Postoperative DASH scores were significantly higher (more severe disability) in patients\nundergoing RFF flap reconstruction (6.93 \u00c6 5.54; n \u00bc 52) compared with those undergoing non-\nRFF flap surgeries (2.95 \u00c6 4.42; n \u00bc 52). Preoperative DASH score, flap size, patient age and\ntumour stage were significantly correlated with postoperative DASH score.\nConclusion: Excluding the effect of neck dissection, RFF flap reconstruction has a significant\ndeleterious effect on upper extremity function.\n",

They were also recruited\nControl subjects were matched to patients\nby age (\u00c65 years), sex, primary cancer site\nand neck treatment (selective neck dissec-\ntion; modified radical neck dissection). All\ntumours were graded according to the\nUnion for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) classification system.12\nAll study subjects were asked to complete\nthe Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and\nHand (DASH) questionnaire13 preopera-\ntively and !1 year postoperatively. The\nDASH questionnaire measures upper\nextremity disabilities from the patient's per-\nspective, and evaluates disability regardless\nof which arm, shoulder or hand the patient\nuses to perform the activity. The question-\nnaire comprises 30 items, with a higher score\nindicating more severe disability.\nThe institutional research committee of\nChina Medical University approved the\nstudy and all participants provided written\ninformed consent.\nRFF flap reconstruction\nIn RFF flap reconstruction, flap elevation in\nthe left arm and recipient site surgery were\nperformed simultaneously to shorten the\ntotal duration of surgery. The radial artery\nand cephalic vein were used as donor vessels\nand closure of the donor site was performed\nvia full-thickness skin graft from the abdo-\nmen. The lower arm was immobilized in a\nsplint, and the first bandage change was\nperformed on the fifth day postoperatively.\nPostoperative flap control was performed\nhourly during the first 24 h and then every\n4 h for the next 2 days.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or\nmedian (range). Between-group compari-\nsons were made with paired t-test.\nPearsons's and Spearman's correlation ana-\nlyses were used to determine the predictive\nfactors for postoperative DASH score.\nStatistical analyses were conducted using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values < 0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study recruited 69 patients with RFF\nflap reconstruction, 17 of whom died during\nfollow-up and so were excluded from the\nfinal analysis. The study therefore included a\nAll patients received unilateral or bilateral\nneck dissections: 47 cases were selective neck\ndissection (SND) and five cases were mod-\nified radical neck dissection (MRND).\nAccording to the UICC classification\nprimary cancer sites were: tongue, 24 cases;\nfloor of mouth, 12 cases; gingiva, 7 cases;\ncheek, 8 cases; and lip, one case.

The effects of SND and\nMRND on shoulder function are insuffi-\nciently investigated, with studies reporting\nvarying levels of impairment.14\u00ad16 It has\nbeen shown that non-SND reconstruction\nis a risk factor for a restricted range of\nshoulder motion, but the follow-up time of\nthis study was extremely short and only\n16.7% of patients underwent RFF flap\nreconstruction.17 Other studies have found\nthat the use of a pectoralis major flap\ninduced shoulder dysfunction.18 Control\npatients undergoing non-RFF flap recon-\nstruction in the present study had slightly\nhigher postoperative DASH scores than\npreoperative scores, but this was not statis-\ntically significant. In order to exclude the\neffect of neck dissection and directly evalu-\nate the role of RFF flap surgery in upper\nextremity morbidity, patients in the pre-\nsent study were matched with a control\npatient undergoing non-RFF flap\nreconstruction.\nThe effects of SND and MRND on\nshoulder function are insufficiently investi-\ngated. Studies have variously reported 25%\nof patients with forearm disabilities,4 none\nor minimal disability in the majority of\npatients (58.3%),8 and moderate or extreme\ndysfunction in most cases (exact data not\navailable).5 This between-study variation\nmay be due to differences in sample size. A\nfurther study demonstrated disability of the\nupper extremity by analysing donor forearm\nsupination and pronation and reported a\nsignificant reduction in the range of motion,\nbut the follow-up time was only 5\u00ad8 days.9\nAll of these studies were retrospective, and\nthe scales used to evaluate disability were\nsimplistic or designed by the authors them-\nselves, limiting the validity of the data. The\npresent study used the DASH question-\nnaire,13 which is multifactorial and has\nsufficient detail to identify subtle changes.\nIn addition, the questionnaire is brief and\nself-administered, and reflects the disability\nperceived by the patient. This scale has been\nThere are few prospective studies regard-\ning the effect of RFF flap reconstruction on\nfunction. When preoperative and postopera-\ntive forearms were compared with nonoper-\nated forearms, there were statistically\nsignificant differences in wrist flexion,\npinch strength and sensation, but no sub-\njective complaints of loss of function by any\npatient.10 Others found small reductions in\nforearm circumference and wrist mobility,\nand restricted function of the donor arm in\n16% of patients after fasciocutaneous RFF\nflap harvest.19 In a series of 50 patients\nundergoing RFF flap harvest, grip power\nand wrist flexion were significantly\ndecreased after surgery compared with pre-\noperative values.20 In contrast to the present\nreport, none of these studies took the pos-\nsible effect of neck dissection into account.\nThe current data show that RFF flap recon-\nstruction significantly increased upper\nextremity disability compared with pre-\noperative function. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the current patients were\nevaluated at least 1 year after surgery, and\nhad been prescribed post-discharge physical\ntherapy. Others have shown that disability\nimproved with time, and rehabilitation\nplayed an important role in promoting\nSome studies have focused on wrist\nmobility, but the effect of RFF flap harvest\non this parameter is unclear.7\u00ad10 In addition,\nit has been shown that objective measure-\nments do not accurately reflect the patient's\nexperience.4,6 This may be because the\nmajority of RFF flaps are harvested from\nthe non-dominant arm, and the reduction in\nwrist motion was not severe enough to\nimpact significantly on daily life. The pre-\nsent study therefore did not analyse wrist\nmobility because of its limited clinical\nsignificance.\nOlder age was predictive of high post-\noperative DASH score in the present study,\nconversely to the findings of others.5 The\ncurrent study is the first to report the\ncorrelations between postoperative function\nand preoperative DASH score, flap size and\ntumour stage. Further studies are required\nto clarify these findings, in particular the\nrelationship between postoperative function\nand tumour stage.\nIn conclusion, excluding the effect of neck\ndissection, RFF flap reconstruction has a\nsignificant deleterious effect on upper\nextremity function.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
