    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Hypnotherapy has been reported as being beneficial in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nWe aimed to test the hypothesis that patients with IBS treated `holistically' by hypnosis (i.e. by combined psychological\nand physiological symptom imagery) would have greater improvement in their IBS symptoms than patients treated\nby hypnosis using standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy, and both would be superior to simple relaxation therapy.\nMethods: Patients (n=51) with Rome II criteria were randomised to `individualised' (holistic) hypnotherapy, standard\n`gut-directed' hypnotherapy or relaxation therapy for a period of 11weeks with two follow-up assessments at 2weeks\nmonths after the completion of the trial. The primary outcome was bowel symptom severity scale (BSSS).\nResults: All the participants in this study improved their IBS symptoms (pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhoea) and\nphysical functioning at the end of the treatment from baseline, but this was not significantly different across the treatment\narms. Conclusion: Neither `individualised' nor `gut-directed' hypnotherapy is superior to relaxation therapy in IBS.\n",

Emotions can also affect\nthe function of our respiratory, immune, cardiovascular,\nreproductive, endocrine and gastrointestinal (GI) systems\n(Davidson, 2013). Research in epigenetics further supports\nthe idea that our beliefs and emotions translate into physi-\nand this mind\u00adbody connection is apparent in sufferers of\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nIBS affects approximately 15\nper cent of the general\npopulation at any one time and is one of the most common\ndisorders encountered by both gastroenterologists and phy-\nsicians in primary care (Camilleri and Choi, 1997; Farthing,\n1995). The disorder typically affects those of working age\nand imposes an economic burden on the patient through\nincreased health-care costs and loss of income because of\nillness (Dean et al., 2005). These patients also often experi-\nence a decrease in quality of life (Creed et al., 2000).\nThe aetiology of IBS is as yet unknown, but most\nresearchers agree that a subset of IBS sufferers have vis-\nceral hypersensitivity of the gut (Bouchoucha et al., 1999;\nCamilleri et al., 2001). Other possible mechanisms in pre-\ndisposed persons that have been proposed include previ-\nous infectious gastroenteritis, mast cell infiltration, an\nimbalance of neurotransmitters including serotonin dys-\nregulation, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and psy-\nchological precipitants including acute life stress and\nHence, IBS is probably a multi-faceted brain\u00adgut disorder\nThe mind\u00adbody connection in irritable\nbowel syndrome: A randomised controlled\ntrial of hypnotherapy as a treatment\nJulie S Phillips-Moore1, Nicholas J Talley2 and Michael P Jones3\n Keywords\nhypnotherapy, irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, psychological, randomised trial\n1Sydney Essential Health, Sydney, NSW, Australia\nFaculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle,\nNSW, Australia\nFaculty of Human Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW,\nAustralia\nCorresponding author:\nJulie S Phillips-Moore, Sydney Essential Health, 130 Edgecliff Rd,\nWoollahra, Sydney, Australia.\nEmail: j.phillipsmoore@gmail.com\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nresulting in alteration in the regulation of gastrointestinal\n(GI) motility and/or sensory function (Smith and Morton,\nthat emotions such as anger, fear, pain and anxiety affect\ncolonic motility more in IBS patients than in healthy con-\nIBS, the most frequent co-morbid psychiatric disorders\nare anxiety, depression and somatoform disorders (Creed,\nThis evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of IBS\ninvolves the brain\u00adgut axis (Salt and Neimark, 2002), and\n`gut-directed' hypnotherapy has been shown to be a suc-\ncessful intervention in breaking abnormal cycles occurring\nStudies have especially shown the efficacy of hypnosis in\n2006), but these studies only addressed physiological\nsymptoms (`gut-directed' hypnotherapy) and did not take\ninto account psychological symptoms such as anxiety and\ndepression which are part of the IBS symptom picture.\nThe mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic suc-\ncess of hypnotherapy are largely unknown, but research\nhas shown that it may act by modulating visceral sensitiv-\nity, motor function and psychological distress (Gruzelier\n2000). Imagery is a major component of hypnosis, and\nresearch has provided numerous examples of the physio-\nlogical effects imagery has on the body (Graham, 1995).\nUnlike many other treatment options which separate the\nmind\u00adbody by focusing on either the psychological or the\nphysiological aspects of IBS, hypnotherapy potentially\naddresses both via the brain\u00adgut axis. However, the appli-\ncation of `gut-directed' hypnosis has not been compared\nwith combined gut and mind\u00adbody hypnosis: the latter\ntheoretically might increase the benefit of hypnotherapy\nas an intervention because psychological distress is so\nprevalent in patients with IBS (Labus et al., 2007; Park\nWe aimed to evaluate the efficacy of hypnosis and\nimagery in the treatment of IBS. More specifically, we aimed\nto compare the use of standard `gut-related' imagery used in\nprevious trials which addressed the patients' physiological\n2006), with mind\u00adbody imagery that reflects the patients'\ncomplete symptom picture (i.e. imagery which addresses\nboth the psychological and physiological aspects of IBS) in a\nrandomised controlled trial.\nMethod\nStudy participants\nA total of 51 symptomatic volunteers with IBS aged\nbetween 17 and 75years were recruited from medical and\nnaturopathic clinics and were invited to undergo a 1-hour\nscreening session. They were then randomly assigned to\none of three groups. Concealed allocation was assured by\nan assistant placing the names of participants into opaque\nenvelopes and placing them in a locked filing cabinet. A\nfortnight after the screening session, all three groups began\nthe treatment programme which consisted of five fort-\nnightly treatment sessions (half an hour each) over a period\nweeks, with a subsequent follow-up of 2\nweeks and\nmonths. The flow of patients through the study is sum-\nmarised in Figure 1.\nThe Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney\napproved the trial, and guidelines on patient consent were met.\nInclusion criteria\nThe participants were deemed suitable for the study after\nhaving been diagnosed with IBS by a primary care physi-\ncian or gastroenterologist. All had to meet the Rome II cri-\n(specifically, pain or abdominal discomfort relieved by def-\necation, and/or onset associated with a change in stool fre-\nquency, and/or onset associated with a change in stool\nform), had failed to respond adequately to conventional\nmedicines, and who had experienced at least 4days with at\nleast moderate pain over a 2-week period after screening.\nExclusion criteria\nParticipants who were not free of organic disease (e.g.\nthose who were diagnosed with coeliac disease, inflamma-\ntory bowel disease or diverticulitis as well as IBS) and who\ndid not fit the inclusion criteria were excluded. Current\nmedications were not discontinued.\nGastrointestinal screening of study population\nDuring the initial screening session, participants completed\nthevalidatedTalleyIrritableBowelSymptomQuestionnaire\n(IBSQ) (Talley et al., 1995) to establish diagnosis and\nexclude other differential diagnoses. They also completed\nthe validated Bowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)\n(Boyce et al., 2000) to establish the severity of their IBS\nsymptoms.\nInterventions\nThe participants were randomly allocated to one of three\ngroups \u00ad two experimental groups (either `individualised'\nor standard `gut-directed' hypnosis) and one control group\n(relaxation therapy) \u00ad by means of random number tables\n(Boyer, 1968) and were unaware of which treatment group\nthey were assigned to and of other participants in the trial.\nAlso, consultations for other patients were always inter-\nspersed between those for any IBS trial participants to min-\nimise contact between subjects.\nPhillips-Moore et al. 3\nFigure 1. Flow diagram of subjects' progress through the phases of the trial.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nAt the end of the trial, participants in the control group\nwere offered two complementary sessions in hypnosis. The\nfive treatment sessions were spaced approximately a fortnight\napart over a period of 9weeks. In the first of the five half-hour\nsessions, the patient's full history was taken and the function-\ning of the GI tract was explained. The following procedure\nwas then strictly adhered to for all five sessions of the trial.\n`Individualised'hypnosis. Hypnosis was induced using a rapid\neye catalepsy technique (Elman, 1964) after which the ther-\napist read two prepared scripts \u00ad one containing `gut-\ndirected' imagery (physiological symptoms of IBS), plus a\nfurther script containing the patient's individual psycho-\nlogical symptoms as evidenced by the Symptom Checklist\nAt the end of the second session, a CD of the scripts used in\nthis session was given to the patient to be taken home and\npractised daily.\nStandard `gut-directed' hypnosis.\nHypnosis was induced\n(using a rapid eye catalepsy technique), after which the\ntherapist read the same prepared script containing `gut-\ndirected' imagery (physiological symptoms of IBS) as for\ngroup one. No script containing the patient's psychological\nsymptoms was read. At the end of the second session, a CD\nof the `gut-directed' imagery script was given to the patient\nto be taken home and practised daily.\nRelaxation therapy.No hypnosis was induced. The therapist\nread a prepared script of a progressive relaxation exercise that\ncontained neither the aforementioned `gut-directed' imagery\nnor the patient's individual psychological symptoms. At the\nend of the second session, a CD of the relaxation exercise was\ngiven to the patient to be taken home and practised daily.\nCompliance for home practice was checked by the ther-\napist at each treatment session and was also evidenced by\nthe participants' responses to Question 6 of the Bowel\nSymptom Scale 3 (BSS3) and Question 7 of the Bowel\nSymptom Scale 4 (BSS4).\nFollow-up.The Bowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)\net al., 1988) were completed by each participant, at 2weeks\nand again at 3months after completion of the 9-week treat-\nment period, to assess whether IBS symptoms had signifi-\ncantly changed compared with baseline. No further treatment\nwas given during the follow-up period, nor were participants\ninvited to return for further treatment if symptoms returned.\nInstruments\nIrritable Bowel Symptom Questionnaire (IBSQ)\nA modified validated version of the previously validated\nTalley BSQ (Talley et al., 1995) was utilised in order to\nverify the diagnosis of IBS and to acquire general data on\npatients participating in the trial. The BSQ addressed\naspects such as pain/discomfort, bloating, frequency and\ntype of bowel movement, urgency, and frequency of visits\nto a doctor or alternative therapist.\nBowel Symptom Scales (BSS1-5)\nThe BSS (Boyce et al., 2003) were used to assess change in\nIBS symptoms during the course of the five treatment ses-\nsions. The first item of all five BSSs consists of five visual\nanalogue scales which refer to each of the principal symp-\ntoms of IBS (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation and\ndiarrhoea), plus an overall symptom severity rating. All\nfive of the BSS also assess stool form and the degree to\nwhich IBS symptoms interfered with the patient's life and\nactivities (see Tables 2a to 2d and Figure 2).\nBowel Symptom Severity Scale (BSSS)\nThe BSSS (Boyce et al., 2000) consists of eight questions\nrelating to possible symptoms the patient may have\nendured in the 2\nweeks between treatment sessions. The\nsymptoms specific in this questionnaire enquire about\nstool formation, abdominal pain, frequency of bowel\nmotions, bloating, urgency, inability to have a bowel\nmotion and a general feeling of discomfort in the abdo-\nmen. Each question also has two sub-questions which\nasked how distressed the patient had been during this\nperiod and how much the specific symptoms had inter-\nfered with his or her daily life. Each of the symptoms is\ngiven a severity rating between 0 and 4, a higher rating\nbeing indicative of greater severity.\nto evaluate a broad range of psychological problems and\nsymptoms of psychopathology and is also useful in measur-\ning the patients' progress or treatment outcomes. It provides\nan overview of the patients'symptoms and their intensity.\nThe questionnaire consists of 90 items which measure\nnine primary symptom dimensions: somatisation, obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depres-\nsion, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation\nand psychoticism. For the purpose of this trial, four of the\nnine primary symptom dimensions (anxiety, depression,\ninterpersonal sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive disor-\nder) which reflected the psychological symptoms of\nthe majority of the participants were measured a priori.\nThose participants in the `individualised' hypnosis group\nwho scored 10 or higher on any of the four scales were\nread specific scripts pertaining to their disorder during the\ntreatment sessions.\nPhillips-Moore et al. 5\nShort Form General Health Survey (SF-36)\nhas been applied widely to clinical trials and is capable of\ndiscriminating between healthy participants and those with\nmoderate levels of psychiatric illness (Russo et al., 1998).\nThe SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire consisting of eight\nhealth concepts or sub-scales broadly related to quality of\nlife, mental health and social activities.\nThe sensitivity of the SF-36 to change in health status\nof IBS patients was tested by examining changes in SF-36\nsub-scale scores throughout the treatment period and as\nfollow-up 2\nweeks and 3\nmonths after the completion of\nthe trial.\nDuke-UNC Functional Social Support\nQuestionnaire\nThe eight-item Duke-UNC Questionnaire (Broadhead\net al., 1988) was completed by the participants at the screen-\ning session to assess the amount of support patients had and\nto what extent it influenced their health and well-being. The\nquestionnaire contains questions in two content areas: con-\nfident social support, which reflects a confidant relation-\nship where important matters in life such as social contact\nand personal/work/financial problems are discussed and\nshared; and affective support, which reflects a more emo-\ntional form of support and caring.\nSurvey of Recent Life Experiences (SRLE)\nEmotional responses to life stress can influence GI func-\ntion via the brain\u00adgut axis and produce symptoms such as\npain and altered bowel function (Lundberg, 2005; Mayer,\nconsists of 51 items covering six concepts (social and\ncultural difficulties, work, time pressure, finances, social\nacceptability and social victimisation) was completed by\nthe participants at the screening session to determine\nwhether these stresses had had an influence on their IBS\nsymptoms.\nCredibility Scale\nThe Credibility Scale (Borkovec and Nau, 1972) was issued\nto participants on two occasions throughout the trial (session\n2 and session 4) to assess the credibility of treatment as per-\nceived by the participants and to test the success of blinding.\nThe four-item assessment contains questions on how\nconfident the patients are in the treatment they are receiv-\ning, how confident they are in recommending the treat-\nment to a friend suffering a similar complaint, how logical\nthe treatment seems to them and how successful they think\nthis form of treatment would be in alleviating other\ncomplaints.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the primary endpoint (BSS), an intention to treat analy-\nsis of variance was used to determine the differences among\ngroups at baseline, end of treatment, and follow-up and\nrepeated measures for trend over time were also deter-\nmined. All p values were two-tailed, unless otherwise indi-\ncated, and the alpha level of significance was set at 0.05.\nMissing scale and item scores were not replaced. Data for\nall other outcome measures (psychological stress (SRLE)),\nquality of life (SF-36) and social support (Duke-UNC) are\npresented as per protocol analysis.\nIt was hypothesised a priori that, with respect to the\nabdominal pain sub-scale of the SCL-90-R, the control\ngroup would not change on average, the standard therapy\ngroup would improve by one point and the individualised\ntherapy group by two points. Under these conditions and\nwith an assumed standard deviation (SD)=2.0, n=25 par-\nticipants per study group would have yielded statistical\nsignificance. Due to difficulty with recruitment, n=17\nparticipants were actually recruited per group, and this\nyields statistical power of approximately 0.72 under the\nsame conditions. While this power is less than the desired\n0.8, it is unlikely to have materially affected the statistical\nanalysis.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nAt baseline, the 51 participants in this study were similar\nacross treatment areas (Table 1). All participants pre-\nsented with psychological problems. Of these, 30 partici-\npants presented with depression, 4 with anxiety, 2 with\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and 1 with interpersonal\nsensitivity. Of the remainder, 5 had both depression and\nanxiety, 5 had depression and obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder, and 4 presented with depression and interpersonal\nsensitivity.\nAt the commencement of the trial period, the majority of\nparticipants (81.6%) suffered abdominal pain most of the\nhad severe to very severe pain) with 61.2% of participants\nexperiencing pain several times a week or daily. In the\nmonths prior to treatment, 98.0% of participants experi-\nenced bloating and 78.4% of participants had visible\nabdominal swelling. Of the 51 participants, 51% were\ndiarrhoea predominant, 44.9% constipation predominant,\nand 4.1% had mixed diarrhoea and constipation. The major-\nity of participants in this study were women (86.3%), and\nthe majority of sufferers were aged between 20 and 40years\nThree participants withdrew from the trial (one each in\nsessions 1, 2 and 4), and six subjects were excluded from\n6 Health Psychology Open \nthe analysis at the end of the trial due to incomplete or miss-\ning records.\nResponse to intervention\nAll participants demonstrated improvement in the overall\nseverity of their individual symptoms and functioning at\nthe end of the treatment period (Session 5), with the `indi-\nvidualised' group (group one) having a numerically better\noutcome than the other two groups (Tables 2a to 2d). The\noverall symptom score was not significantly different at\nSession 5, and improvement in IBS symptoms (Figure 3)\nand general health outcomes (Figure 4) did not continue\nduring the 3-month follow-up period.\nTable 1.

The correlation between the\nconfident support score and depression was significant\nQuality of life\nParticipants in all three groups demonstrated an improve-\nment in overall severity in their IBS symptoms and a subse-\nquent improvement in their quality of life. There was a\nhighly significant decrease in the level of pain, and also a\nhighly significant improvement in the patients' vitality,\nsocial functioning and mental health. There was also sig-\nnificant improvement in physical functioning, general\nhealth and the extent to which emotional problems inter-\nfered with their work or daily activities from baseline\n(Figure 4). However, there was no significant treatment\neffect (Table 4).\nCredibility Scale\nThe participants in all three groups showed that their expec-\ntancy for improvement increased from the commencement\nof their treatment to the end of treatment, although the\nresults did not show statistically significant differences\namong the three treatment groups (Figure 5).\nDiscussion\nThe study follows on previous research which has shown\n`gut-directed'hypnotherapy to be of benefit to patients with\nThe study tested both physiological and specific psycho-\nlogical imagery in the hypnotherapy scripts and compared\nthis technique to standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy.\nPsychological distress, which can trigger or exacerbate\nbeen shown to be an important component of IBS symp-\ntoms and probably should be considered when treatment\nstrategies are designed. To our knowledge, studies on hyp-\nnotherapy as a treatment for IBS have not taken this into\n1987). By using scripts that specifically target each indi-\nvidual patient's emotional/psychological symptoms (in\nconjunction with scripts for the physiological aspects of the\ndisease), the therapist in this trial attempted to address the\nwhole patient profile.\nBased on previous research and consistent with the aims\nof this study, the present research sought to empirically\ninvestigate three main hypotheses.\nThe first hypothesis was that participants who had been\ndiagnosed with IBS would present with not only physiolog-\nical symptoms but psychological ones as well and, that at\nthe end of the study, participants who underwent `individu-\nalised' hypnotherapy (using imagery which addressed both\nthe psychological/emotional aspects and the physiological\nsymptoms of the syndrome) would have a better outcome\nin the improvement in their IBS symptoms than partici-\npants who underwent standard `gut-directed' hypnotherapy\nin which physiological symptoms alone were treated. In\nthis study, participants presented with high baseline scores\non psychological ratings. However, while all groups\nimproved from baseline on multiple measures, there was no\noverall benefit detected for hypnotherapy over relaxation\ntherapy.\nThe second hypothesis we tested was that participants'\nIBS symptoms would improve during the trial period, and,\nas a result, their quality of life would subsequently improve.\nQuality of life did improve in all treatment arms but, again,\nwe detected no differential effect of hypnotherapy.\nThe third hypothesis was that participants who had a\nsupport system in place would improve more quickly than\nthose who had not. We found that there was no significant\ncorrelation between support and improvement in the over-\nall severity of IBS symptoms. The only significant correla-\ntion found was between the confident support score and the\ndepression score.\nThis study had several strengths. The study was ran-\ndomised and concealed allocation was assured by an assis-\ntant placing the names of participants into opaque envelopes\nand placing them in a locked filing cabinet. IBS and the\nfunctioning of the GI tract were explained. Careful atten-\ntion was given to blinding throughout the trial, and the\ntherapist (the principle author) who administered the ther-\napy was an experienced and qualified hypnotherapist.\nOther strengths of this study lie in the fact that participants\nwere recruited prospectively; participants with other pre-\nexisting functional GI diseases were carefully excluded;\nand both validated, standardised questionnaires to define\nthe outcome measure of IBS and strict criteria for diagnos-\ning IBS were utilised. Also, the drop-out rate during the\ntrial was small.\nThere were also limitations in this study. It may not have\nbeen sufficiently powered. Due to time limits and the fact\nthat the therapist was the only person recruiting, the sample\nsize was modest. A much larger sample size would have\nbeen required to detect such a small effect size difference\namong the groups, but such a difference would possibly\nstill not have been clinically significant.\nAnother potential limitation was an absence of contact\nwith participants by the therapist during the follow-up\nperiod. In previous trials in hypnotherapy (Gonsalkorale\nto receive hypnotherapy sessions on a monthly basis during\nthe follow-up period and were asked to telephone if they\nPhillips-Moore et al. 11\nexperienced a relapse so that a further session of hypno-\ntherapy could be arranged. In this study, there was no fur-\nther contact with the therapist by the participants, adherence\nto protocols during the follow-up period was not checked\nand participants were not given further hypnotherapy ses-\nsions (either on a regular basis or in case of relapse) to\nmaintain remission. This could be a possible explanation\nfor the lack of improvement in IBS symptoms during the\nfollow-up period. With continued checking of adherence to\nautohypnosis practice and ongoing hypnotherapy sessions\nwith the therapist, improvement in scores may have\nincreased but, in the authors' view, to do so would not have\naddressed if any benefit persisted.\nResearch has indicated that EEG wave changes associ-\nated with hypnosis can also be triggered by other methods\nof deep concentration, such as the relaxation response\n(Jacobs and Friedman, 2004; Williams and Gruzelier,\n2001). Previous trials on relaxation training as a treatment\nfor IBS, however, have shown mixed results (Blanchard\nNevertheless, the control group in the trial underwent\nsessions in relaxation as a treatment for their IBS symp-\ntoms, whereas treatment for the other two experimental\ngroups involved sessions in hypnotherapy. Considering that\nthe relaxation response can trigger brain wave changes\nassociated with hypnosis and that hypnotherapy sessions,\nthemselves, involve deep relaxation, participants in the\ncontrol group could have easily lapsed into hypnosis. This\ncould account for the similarities in treatment outcome and\nthe small effect difference between the groups.\nNotwithstanding the limitations of this clinical trial and\nthat the findings need further confirmation, this study\nappears to support a psycho-physiological hypothesis that\nTable 4.

Future research\nneeds to continue the investigation of the brain\u00adgut axis in\nIBS and the role of hypnotherapy which addresses both the\npsychological and physiological aspects of this disorder, as\nan effective and viable treatment option.\nIn conclusion, in a randomised, controlled trial of hyp-\nnotherapy in IBS, symptoms (pain, bloating, constipation\nand diarrhoea) and physical functions improved from base-\nline in each arm. Hypnotherapy, however, was not shown to\nbe superior to relaxation therapy for symptom reduction in\nthis disorder. A possible explanation for this could be that\nthe relaxation response is also associated with hypnosis and\nparticipants in the control group could have lapsed into a\ntrance state. This also suggests that reducing anxiety\nthrough relaxation may be the key to reducing IBS symp-\ntoms in patients, whatever the mechanism may be.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial or not for profit sectors.\nReferences\nAnbar RD (2001) Self-hypnosis for the treatment of functional\nabdominal pain in childhood.
