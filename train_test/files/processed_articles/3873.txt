    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe automated parsing of 130,213 news articles about the 2012 US presidential elections produces a network formed by\nthe key political actors and issues, which were linked by relations of support and opposition. The nodes are formed\nby noun phrases and links by verbs, directly expressing the action of one node upon the other. This network is studied by\napplying insights from several theories and techniques, and by combining existing tools in an innovative way, including:\ngraph partitioning, centrality, assortativity, hierarchy and structural balance. The analysis yields various patterns. First, we\nobserve that the fundamental split between the Republican and Democrat camps can be easily detected by network\npartitioning, which provides a strong validation check of the approach adopted, as well as a sound way to assign actors\nand topics to one of the two camps. Second, we identify the most central nodes of the political camps. We also learnt\nthat Clinton played a more central role than Biden in the Democrat camp; the overall campaign was much focused on\neconomy and rights; the Republican Party (Grand Old Party or GOP) is the most divisive subject in the campaign, and is\nportrayed more negatively than the Democrats; and, overall, the media reported positive statements more frequently for\nthe Democrats than the Republicans. This is the first study in which political positions are automatically extracted and\nderived from a very large corpus of online news, generating a network that goes well beyond traditional word-association\nnetworks by means of richer linguistic analysis of texts.\n",

The American presidential elections\nare among the most interesting campaigns because of\nthe sheer amount of resources deployed and the influ-\nence of the United States on global governance.\nThis study presents a large-scale analysis of mass\nmedia coverage of the 2012 US presidential elections,\ncombining automatic corpus linguistics methods and\nnetwork analysis to obtain a network representation\nof the entire campaign coverage by the news media.\nMapping the full extent to which an electoral campaign\nis represented by media offline and online constitutes a\nvery difficult challenge for researchers, given the large\namount of data and the multitude of sources available\nin advanced democracies.

We propose a Big Data\napproach, based on automated information extraction.\nOur study is based on the automated analysis of\ntions from 719 news outlets, based on state-of-the-art\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) techniques, to extract information\nabout the key actors and their relations in the media\nnarrative of the US elections. These relations are in the\nform of subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets extracted by\na parser, and are organised as a network, or semantic\ngraph, which can then be analysed with mathematical\ntools. This approach goes well beyond traditional\nword-association networks, producing not only dir-\nected links, but links whose semantic nature is retained\nand understood. Much of the following analysis would\nnot be possible without these features, which ultimately\nresulted from the use of a parser to identify noun\nphrases and verbs to form SVO triplets. An example\nof one such triplet is `Obama criticised Romney'.\nThis article is divided into different sections: first, we\ndiscuss the theoretical framework that informed our\nstudy, stating the importance of applying a semantic\ngraph approach to texts; second, we outline the novel\nmethodology employed to automate the analysis of\nnews media content. Third, we present our findings;\nlast, we conclude by reflecting on both theoretical and\nmethodological aspects of studying the network of\nactors and actions.\nBig Data analysis of news coverage\nIn this study, we analyse texts by an automatic identi-\nfication of `semantic triplets', formed by key actors,\nobjects and their relationships. In particular, we con-\nsider SVO triplets, following the approach developed\nby Quantitative Narrative Analysis or QNA (Earl\nthat SVO triplets form the fundamental units of narra-\ntion. Our methodological contribution to that literature\nhas been to automate the extraction of triplets, by iden-\ntifying subjects and objects with noun phrases and\nusing a parser. The set of triplets obtained is naturally\norganised into a network, which we call a `semantic\ngraph'. The semantic graph encodes the relations\namong all actors in the corpus. Note that sometimes\nthe expression `semantic graph' is used to indicate net-\nworks formed by linking co-occurring words, which is a\npurely statistical approach that makes no use of more\ndetailed linguistic information. Instead, our process of\nautomatically extracting the SVO triplets from the\ncorpus is based on the use of a syntactical parser,\nand is described in detail in the Appendix.\nIn the context of a news corpus about a political\nelection, we introduce a slightly different interpretation\nof SVO triplets based on the observation that candi-\ndates define their political positioning through a set of\nclaims or actions through which they either endorse or\noppose issues and actors. This interpretation will be\ndiscussed in the next section. In this sense, SVO triplets\ncan be used as a source of political positioning infor-\nmation. Extracting triplets and adding them in two\ncoherent semantic graphs provides a map of the candi-\ndates' strategic positioning across a wide range of\nissues. Manually generated semantic graphs have been\napplied in several different collections of texts. For\nexample, Moretti (2013) decomposed novels into net-\nwork structures in which actors are linked by verbs. In\nthis approach, the properties of a text can be revealed\nby the structural and topological features of the novel\nnetwork. Similarly, Mac Carron and Kenna (2012) ana-\nlysed three classical mythological narratives comparing\nthe topological properties of their corresponding\nnarrative networks.\nAll these studies were necessarily limited in size\nfor being reliant on manual coding. However, some\nprogress has recently been made in the automatic cre-\nation of networks, the closest approach to ours being\nDiesner et al. (2012) where statistical co-occurrence of\nnamed entities is used to form networks. Also in this\ncase, however, the semantics of the link in the network\nis only provided by statistical co-occurrence between\nwords and not by linguistic analysis.\nCompared to these previous studies, we introduce\nseveral methodological innovations that are character-\nistic of a beneficial Big Data approach. This is a crucial\npoint: we not only `went big' by increasing the `reso-\nlution' of the data collected but this is also the first time\nsuch methodology has been applied on a Big Data\nscale, by making use of syntactical parsers and a fully\nautomated text analysis pipeline. We have increased the\nquality and resolution of the data obtained by auto-\nmatic extraction because this method goes well\nbeyond the traditional creation of networks based\non word co-occurrences. We have retained semantic\ninformation by extracting SVO triplets and classifying\nrelationships in a signed network. It is the first time\nthat noun phrases are used rather than words. Our\nautomated infrastructure produced the network of\nactors and their relations without human intervention,\nhave collected.\nThe mass media representation of the campaign\nis decomposed into a signed network structure that\nreveals relationships between the main actors \u00ad e.g.\n2 Big Data & Society\nObama and Romney and the other objects (e.g. the\neconomy, Iraq, etc.). Besides analysing the overall cam-\npaign network, we also extract the networks of each of\nthe candidates. The relationships between Obama and\nRomney and other objects constitute their networks of\nclaims; the sign (positive or negative) of the edge indi-\ncates the nature of the relationship.\nIdeographs, rhetorical space and issues ownership\nIn the public sphere (Habermas et al., 1974), there are\ncompeting definitions of public issues, within what is a\ncomplex game played for semantic control (Gaskell\net al., 1998). This is particularly evident during the con-\ntext of political elections. Candidates define their polit-\nical positioning through a complex set of claims\nthrough which they either endorse or oppose issues\nand actors (both individuals and/or institutions). To\nidentify and map this multifaceted ideological and pol-\nitical representative space, we start from the notion of\n`ideographs' introduced by rhetorical theorists (McGee,\n1980). Ideographs are ideological stances, expressed in\na few words, which define an actor's political identity.\nThey are the basic structural elements, or building\nblocks, of ideology. Thus, they may be thought of as\n`ideographs' for, like Chinese symbols, they signify and\ncontain a unique ideological commitment.\nInterestingly, this observation complements the\napproach commonly taken in QNA, where the emphasis\nis on detecting `who did what to whom': here, by viewing\nactions (and claims) as position statements, we can iden-\ntify SVO triplets with political positioning claims (where\nwe only consider triplets linked by a verb that expresses\nsupport or opposition for the object), and provide a\nrigorous and effective representation of the rhetorical\nand political space in which the candidates' positioning\ntakes place \u00ad this is achieved by embedding the resulting\nnetwork of triplets into a space as shown in the\n`Network partitioning and embedding' section.\nAs part of our approach, we can also create graph-\nical descriptions of the overall positioning of an actor,\nby operationalising and expanding McGee's notion of\nideograph into a network perspective to include any\ngraphs encoding all positive and negative statements\nmade by actors towards objects (i.e. other actors or\npolitical issues). In this context, it is an important\nobservation that the decomposition of the network of\ntriplets leads to a meaningful distinction of two sub-\nnetworks roughly corresponding to the `Democratic\nParty' and `Republican Party' (Grand Old Party\n(GOP)) semantic fields (see Figure 4). The embedding\nof the network into a space can also be used to visualise\nthe political space in which positioning takes place (see\nFigure 5). Subsets of the triplets centered on a specific\ncandidate can also be used to create candidate-specific\n`ideographs', summarising the political position of an\nactor (as further demonstrated in the Appendix).\nThe second important point is that our network is\nconstructed out of media reporting rather than from\ndirect quotations from candidates. In that respect, we\npresent how the online news `mediascape' has repre-\nsented the positioning of Obama and Romney regard-\ning all issues that were deemed newsworthy.\nThe ideographs constructed on endorsement and\nopposition claims can reveal if `issue ownership'\noccurs. The theory of issue ownership rests on the prop-\nosition that due to long-standing party reputations,\ncandidates are more likely to be perceived as having\ncredibility over certain issues `owned' by their party\ninstance, voters see Republicans as being better able\nto handle foreign policy and government management\nissues, while the Democrats are perceived as more adept\non civil rights and social welfare issues. Prior research\nsuggests that these partisan issue associations are con-\nsistent and well defined (e.g. Hayes, 2008; Petrocik,\n1996). However, candidates do occasionally venture\ninto `enemy territory'. Specifically, Downs (1957)\nargues that to appeal to the largest segment of voters,\ncandidates in a two-party system should cast some poli-\ncies into the other's territory in order to convince voters\nthat their net position is closer to them. Thus, instances\nof issue trespassing should be expected as a function of\nnormal campaign strategy (Hayes, 2008). The construc-\ntion of a semantic graph, as previously described, which\nrepresents the campaign and the two candidates' issue\nnetworks, has the additional benefit of allowing the\nidentification of issue trespassing.\nIn this study, we formulate a number of typical\nresearch questions from a social scientific perspective\nwithin the context of our network approach to text and\nmedia data. The questions that inform this study are:\n1. How did the media `as a whole' report and represent\nthe campaign and the political positions of Obama\nand Romney? How are the candidates positioned in\na political space by their actions of support and\nopposition?\n2. What do the semantic signed graphs of the two can-\ndidates reveal to us about their communication stra-\ntegies and positioning?\n3. What can the structure of an election's semantic\ngraph reveal to us, both in general and in this par-\nticular instance?\nTopological properties of a semantic graph\nThe set of SVO triplets that we have extracted from the\nnews corpus can best be analysed when linked together\nSudhahar et al. 3\nto form a network, which we call a `semantic graph'.\nGraph partitioning methods can be deployed to embed\nactors in a political space based on their relations with\nother actors. The methodology is described in\nAppendix A8. It is a remarkable observation that the\nkey political fault-lines are readily detected by this\napproach.\nWe analyse other global properties, such as struc-\ntural balance, assortativity and hierarchy, as well as\nthe centrality of nodes. The former provide insights\nabout the structural features of semantic graphs. The\nlatter reveal the roles played in the election by specific\nactors or issues in the political `fields'.\nThere are a number of well-known measures of\ncentrality of nodes in a network including: betweenness\ncentrality, closeness centrality, out-degree, in-degree,\npagerank, hubs and authorities. We select some of\nthese in order to capture certain aspects of narrative\ncentrality. Different measures of centralities help us in\nidentifying nodes and their roles in the candidates'\nsemantic graphs. For example, degree centrality reveals\nthe most salient issues or actors; betweenness centrality\nidentifies issues or actors that have a bridging function\nbetween clusters of issues/actors; and in-closeness\ncentrality helps us identify the nodes that act as `con-\ntextualisers'. We will discuss the interpretation of cen-\ntralities in further detail in the section entitled\n`Detecting the central actors in the semantic graphs'.\nMethodology and data\nOur software pipeline (Sudhahar et al., 2013) detects\nelection-related articles in large corpora, parses them,\nextracts SVO triplets, and identifies key actors, objects\nand actions. The triplets are then used to form a net-\nwork and the network is analysed. A detailed descrip-\ntion of the pipeline architecture is available in\nAppendix A5. The two guiding principles were for us\nto be able to re-use existing tools where possible, and to\nbuild a system that can be scaled up to large corpora.\nThe overall methodology represents an innovative com-\nbination of existing techniques and tools applied to a\nnovel research aim that extracts meaningful networks\nout of large textual datasets.\nDataset\nThe dataset used for this study is obtained using our\ninfrastructure, which is a media monitoring system\n(Flaounas et al., 2011) that gathers and analyses news\nitems from the web from a large number of news out-\nlets. English-language news articles related to the 2012\nUS elections were identified using an automatic text\nclassifier. The classifier was a support vector machine\n(Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) trained and vali-\ndated using the election news feed from Yahoo!, where\nit achieved 83.46% precision (correct classification) and\nnational media outlets in English for a total of 81,023\nlets in English for a total of 49,190 articles during the\nNovember 2012 using the SVO triplets method.\nFigure 1(a) shows the types of outlets and the\nnumber of outlets in each type that were captured in\nour analysis. The types of news outlets captured were\nnewspapers, broadcast media, blogs and online media\nand magazines. Figure 1(b) shows the number of art-\nicles collected from January to November by the 2012\nElections tagger.\nThe plot shows peaks of media attention for the\nelections in January (during the Republican victory\nin the primary contests in Iowa), September (during\nthe Democrat conventions), October (during the presi-\ndential debates) and November (during the election day\nand Obama's victory).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. Plot (a) shows the number of outlets covered in each type during the 2012 election primaries and main elections. Plot (b)\nshows the number of articles collected from January to November.\n4 Big Data & Society\nFiltering of relevant and reliable entities,\nactions and triplets\nAs each step of our pipeline may be subject to error, we\nrely on the large amount of data we collect in order to\nmaintain a clean dataset and correct classification/\nextraction. This is done by filtering away uncertain\nresults at various stages of processing and introducing\nthe need to quantify the reliability and relevance of\na triplet, as well as that of the entities and their actions.\nAppendix A4 discusses in detail how this step is\nperformed.\nPositive and negative relations between entities\nAn important part of our study is that the verbs linking\nentities are classified into those that show a positive or a\nnegative attitude (the remaining triplets are removed as\nthey are not relevant for our goal of detecting political\npositions). So once we have identified a set of reliable\ntriplets, we can also assign a weight that quantifies the\nrelation of support or opposition between these two\nentities. These claims or actions can then be interpreted\nas `positioning statements' and be used to define the\npolitical position of the actors involved.\nWe do this by assembling two lists of verbs, one sig-\nnalling actions compatible with a positive attitude and\nthe other signalling a negative attitude. Verb lists denot-\ning political support/opposition are manually created by\ngoing through actions in triplets that were extracted\nfrom the elections corpus. Synonyms of these verbs\nwere then added to the lists using an online thesaurus\ndictionary. Using the verb lists we could count a triplet\nas a vote in favour of a positive or negative attitude, and\ncalculate a weight for each of the two possible relations.\nThe verb lists are available in Appendix A9.\nIn order to define the extent to which one actor a\nsupports/opposes an object or another actor b, we need\nto combine the number of positive and negative state-\nments observed in the data connecting node a to node\nb. We model this as the probability of observing a posi-\ntive or a negative verb, when a is seen as acting on b,\ntherefore reducing this to the estimation of a Bernoulli\nrandom variable. Bearing in mind the uncertainty\nintroduced by using finite (and possibly small) samples\nof observations, we consider also the confidence of our\nestimation of the parameter of the Bernoulli distribu-\ntion associated to each oriented pair of actors (a,b).\nThis is done by using the Wilson score coefficient, a\nstandard approach in statistics, as described in\nAppendix A2.\nOnce the entities and their relations are quantified\nwith the above methods we assemble them in a network\nin which nodes represent entities/objects and edges rep-\nresent positive/negative weights.\nResults and discussion: Analysis\nof networks\nAt the end of the software pipeline described above, we\ntering the actors and the triplets to identify the most\nrelevant and reliable ones, we are left with only 2275\ndistinct triplets (of course, observed multiple times) and\n(positive and negative) links.\nThe most reliable actors or links are obtained by\ncomparing their relative frequency in a topic-specific\ncorpus with that of a separate, static background\ncorpus or by their absolute number of mentions in\nthe text (explained in Appendix A4). However, this\nmeasure of relevance is not appropriate in all domains.\nWhen key entities in the topic-specific corpus are also\nvery widely used in the background corpus, the relevance\nweighting will fail to give greater weighting to the most\nimportant entities. In this case, key entities can be identi-\nfied by their absolute number of mentions in the text as we\ndo for this study. Therefore, we use the top 100 most\nfrequent entities in the 2012 elections corpus as key enti-\nties. Triplets containing these key entities are considered\nreliable if they have been seen in more than k independent\ndocuments. The decision on k is explained in Appendix\nA6. Finally, triplets containing these key entities are used\nto create the network and this network contained the\nmost significant actors and links.\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate the complete signed and\ndirected networks obtained from our pipeline during\nthe primaries phase (January to August) and the main\nelections phase (August to November) in 2012. The\nnodes in the network represent key entities and edges\nrepresent positive/negative weights. The green/red\ncolour on the edges indicates positive/negative relations\nand the size of the node represents the degree of\nthe node.\nDuring the primaries we can see many hubs showing\ndifferent campaigns taking place within the Republican\ncamp (`Romney', `Santorum', `Gingrich', `Perry', `Cain')\nbesides the Obama campaign, while after the conventions\nwe see only the two huge campaigns by `Obama' and\n`Romney', who were the dominant players.\nNetwork partitioning and embedding\nAs discussed above, candidates define their political\npositioning through a complex set of claims through\nwhich they either endorse or oppose issues and actors,\nwhich are captured in the network. Their positioning\ntakes place in the public sphere and is reported by the\nmedia. We use this reported `political space' to map\nsuch positioning, and the main challenge is whether\nSudhahar et al. 5\nwe can gain insights about this `space' from the net-\nwork of triplets.\nA first analysis that can be performed on the net-\nwork is its partitioning by means of spectral decompos-\nition (see Appendix A8), which also has the effect of\nassigning each node a `degree of membership' to one of\nthe two partitions. The results show that the two can-\ndidates and the two parties are naturally separated by\nthis method, a finding that provides a powerful sanity\ncheck for the entire pipeline, as well as providing an\nembedding of actors into a `political space' where prox-\nimity is correlated to the amount of support (directly\nand indirectly) linking them (Figures 4 and 5). This also\nallows us to assign topics to one of the two camps: for\nexample, `Israel' was portrayed as being closer to the\nRepublican camp in 2012, while `Abortion' was closer\nto the Democratic camp. The sub-networks resulting\nfrom the partition are shown in Figures 6 and 7.\nAssortativity, hierarchy and structural balance\nThe next step is to analyse the overall topological prop-\nerties of the entire network. Assortativity refers to a\npreference for a network's nodes to attach to others\nFigure 2. Network with positive and negative edges between entities (US presidential election data: Primaries 2012).\n6 Big Data & Society\nthat are in some way similar. Though the specific meas-\nure of similarity may vary, network theorists often\nexamine assortativity in terms of a node's degree.\nCorrelations between nodes of similar degree are\noften found in the mixing patterns of many observable\nnetworks. For instance, in social networks, highly con-\nnected nodes tend to be connected with other high\ndegree nodes. On the other hand, technological and\nbiological networks typically show disassortative\nmixing, or dissortativity, as high-degree nodes tend to\nattach to low-degree nodes. We measured assortativity\nand hierarchy, finding that the network is not assorta-\ntive but hierarchical. The interpretation of such\nstructural features is open because there are no clear\npre-existing studies about semantic networks and their\nassortative mixing. We further develop this point in the\ndiscussion, while the technical steps carried out in our\ntesting are reported in the Appendix.\nWe also analysed the structural balance of the net-\nnotion (defined in more detail in the Appendix)\nattempts to capture the natural property of networks\nFigure 3. Network with positive and negative edges between entities (US presidential election data: After conventions 2012).\nSudhahar et al. 7\nFigure 4.

One of the main reasons for this is the pres-\nence of many triads where the two candidates profess to\nsupport the same issue, while still remaining critical of\neach other (the technical Appendix reports on the\ndetailed definitions, findings and statistical tests asso-\nciated with structural balance).\nDetecting the central actors in the\nsemantic graphs\nThe next step is to analyse each of the two candidates'\nnetworks. One of the most important questions is the\nidentification of the `central' issues or actors in each\npolitical camp during the campaign as reported by the\nmedia data that we have collected. Given the complete\nnetwork of all actors and their relations, we explored\nvarious measures to quantify the centrality of actors.\nThe transposing and interpreting of centrality meas-\nures into semantic graphs is still a work in progress and\nthere is no completely validated way of doing this. This\nis particularly true in our case, in which we go beyond\nthe use of simple co-occurrences to generate the links\nbetween nodes. We selected a number of centralities\nthat have been used before in the context of semantic\nWe used the degree of a node as the basic measure of\nprominence, as it indicates the number of other actors\nor issues a given actor directly interacts with (Freeman,\n1979). This often \u00ad but not necessarily \u00ad correlates with\nthe frequency with which the actor is mentioned in the\ncorpus.\nFigure 6. Obama's network after the conventions. Dark colours on nodes indicate high degree and light colours indicate low degree.\nSudhahar et al. 9\nBecause we have a directed network, we can com-\npute the in-closeness centrality of nodes (Carrington\net al., 2005), which measures the degree to which a\nnode can be easily reached `from' other nodes (i.e.\nusing edges coming in towards the node) where\n`easily' means the shortest distance. In a semantic\ngraph, a node with a high in-closeness positions itself\nclosest to the centre of reference playing a `connotative'\nrole or, in other words, a `qualifier' or `contextualiser'.\nBetweenness has been measured to identify those nodes\nthat are crucial in holding together the network and\nconnecting different clusters of issues or actors (the\nnodes with high betweenness centrality are translated\nas active mediators in the communication).\nLast, we used the notion of hubs and authorities: a\nhigh authority actor receives links from many good\nhubs (highly connected actors). In the context of our\nnetwork, we interpret authority as a proxy for an\nagenda-setting item in both active and passive terms1\n(further technical details are available in the Appendix).\nWe can also apply the tools described above to ana-\nlyse the two sub-networks obtained by partitioning the\noverall election network (see Appendix for the parti-\ntioning method). The detailed results of that analysis\nare presented in the Appendix A10, but the main find-\nings are as follows.\nDemocratic camp. The highest degree objects in the\nDemocratic campaign are: Obama, President, Clinton,\nAmericans, Economy and Campaign. This indicates\nthat the economy was the most salient issue upon\nwhich the campaign focused, with the discussion of a\n`Plan' to recover the US economy. The objects with the\nhighest betweenness centralities in the Democratic net-\nwork were: Obama, President, Campaign, Clinton,\nAmericans, Biden and Speech, showing how these enti-\nties were the bridges linking the otherwise separate\naspects of the electoral narrative. The objects with the\nhighest in-closeness centrality in Obama's network\ninclude: `Campaign', `Law', `Redistribution', `Pledge',\n`Ads', `Overhaul', `Biden', `Investments', etc. These\nobjects are a mixture of policy and economic tools\n(law, redistribution, overhaul of a policy, investments)\nand contexts (Campaign, Ads, Pledge). Objects with\nhigh authority can help us to define the agenda-setting\nefforts of each of the two parties. In the Democratic\nnetwork, we can find: Obama/President, Economy,\nPlan, Rights, Proposals, Efforts, Biden/Vice-President,\nSpeech, Remarks, Election, Policies and Campaign.\nBesides the expected presence of Obama and Biden,\nthe other objects are indicative of a campaign strongly\nfocused on the economy and on actions and tools (plan,\nproposals, efforts, policies) combined with an emphasis\nFigure 7. Romney's network after the conventions. Dark colours on nodes indicate high degree and light colours indicate low\ndegree.\n10 Big Data & Society\non rights. In the above discussion about issue owner-\nship during US presidential campaigns, the latter topic\nhas traditionally been a Democrat theme. It appears\nthat the 2012 campaign was very much focused on\nthe `Economy' and `Rights' for the Democrats \u00ad the\nagenda-setting effort was directed towards these two\nissues.\nRepublican camp. The top two objects in terms of degree\ncentrality in the Republican network are Mitt Romney\nand Paul Ryan, followed by two nouns: People\nand Plans, which refer to the Republican initiative of\nprescriptions for the US economy. In the case of the\nRepublican network, the objects with high betweenness\ncentralities are all actors: `Romney', `Ryan', `People'\nand `Republicans'. It was also the case for the\nDemocratic network that actors were the most bridging\nobjects. However, it appears that for the Republican\nnetwork there are the two candidates \u00ad Romney and\nRyan \u00ad and then the `People' or the Republican Party.\nIn the Republican network, we find high in-closeness\ncentrality for objects such as: `Amendment', `Work',\n`Proposal' and `Breaks'. Some of them come from the\nRepublican campaigns but others are forced upon\nthem. The highest object in terms of authority is\n`Romney'. This is followed by `Plans', `People',\n`Decision' and `Proposal', all of which are keywords\nof Romney's campaign and language. However, there\nare two objects suggestive of a reaction rather than an\ninitiative in terms of agenda setting: `Mourdock', `Bill'\nand `Public Broadcasting'. All three objects are related\nto attacks from Obama's campaign (see Appendix).\n`Israel' is also present among the objects with high\nauthority and refers to Romney's speech in Israel\nabout US foreign policy in the Middle East. The\nremaining objects with high authority are what now\nwith hindsight appear to be important issues in the\n2012 Republican campaign: tax breaks (Breaks), the\namendment to the federal marriage law (Amendment)\nand the work requirements for welfare benefits (Work).\nPositive and negative statements, and\ndivisive issues\nActors can choose to signal their position in the polit-\nical space by either making negative statements about\nwhat they do not stand for, or positive statements\nabout what they do stand for. We have considered\nhow often an actor is reported as making positive\nor negative statements about another actor or issue.\nSimilarly, we have considered how often an actor is\nthe target of positive or negative statements or actions.\nIn other words, we have measured how often actors\nposition themselves by their opposition to or support\nfor something or someone. We also measured the extent\nto which an object is `divisive' \u00ad in that it attracts\nvery different sets of statements \u00ad and therefore how\nimportant it is for political positioning by both parties.\nThe most divisive subjects and objects in the network. Since\nwe have positively and negatively signed networks, it is\npossible to assess the divisiveness of subjects or objects\nin the network. This will examine the target or source\nnodes of diverse sign links (positive and negative) or\nsame sign links (positive or negative) in the network.\nTo identify the most divisive objects, for each node we\ntake into account all the incoming edges and count how\nmany were positive (p) and negative (n). Treating this\nas a Bernoulli random variable, we use its variance to\nmeasure how divisive the object is. More details on this\nare given in the Appendix A3.\nTable 1 shows the most divisive subjects and objects\nin our network. Among the subjects we find the main\nactors of American politics and of the 2012 campaign.\nThe presence of the GOP (the Republican Party) at the\ntop of the list confirms what was discussed previously\nabout how much more divisive the Republicans had to\nbe by comparison to the Democrats. We detect that the\nmost divisive objects in the campaign concern either the\nTable 1.

We\nexperiment with positive object ratios (PORs) for\nObama and Romney, which could reveal their cam-\npaign representations in the media dataset. We also\nanalyse this for the overall network. The POR for a\ncandidate is computed using equation (1). Po\nrefers to\nthe number of positive statements/expressions made by\nthe candidate about an object and No\nrefers to the\nnumber of negative statements/expressions made by\nthe candidate towards the same object. The overall\nPOR is computed by taking into account the total\nnumber of positive/negative statements towards an\nobject.\nPo \u00c0 No\nPo \u00fe No\nFrom Figure 8, a number of interesting questions\ncan be answered. For example, was the media reportage\nof the 2012 electoral campaign biased towards one of\nthe two parties? The overall positive objects ratio plot\nin Figure 8 provides the answer, albeit within the limi-\ntations of the methodology applied in this study. This\nquantity reflects the number of times an actor has been\nthe object in a SVO triplet with a positive verb. The two\nobjects `Democrats' and `Republicans' are present in\ndifferent quadrants: the `Democrats' are reported as\nbeing (slightly) more often the object of positive state-\nments or actions, while the Republicans are more often\nthe object of negative statements or actions.\nFrom Figure 8, we also learn that both vice-presi-\ndent candidates, Biden and Ryan, had mildly negative\nreporting. Above all, the chart confirms the extreme\nimportance played by the status of the US economy\nas the main issue towards which the campaign gravi-\ntated. `Economy', `Money', `Jobs' and `Taxes' are the\nmain focus of the reporting and also of both\ncandidates.\nComparing the two campaigns\nDemocratic camp. Barack Obama's ideograph provides\nus with Figure 9: on the Y axis we have the POR of\nobjects linked to Obama (the weight vector for outgo-\ning links only) and on the X axis their frequency. The\ntwo top items that were most positively referred to by\nObama are `Nomination' and `Supporters' and this is\nnot particularly surprising. The other objects present in\nFigure 9 reveal a more interesting picture.\nFigure 10. Candidate Romney: overall positive objects ratio vs. frequency.\nAs discussed previously, issue ownership in US\npresidential elections traditionally assigns an advantage\nto the Republican Party in using the economy as a\ncampaign issue (Campbell et al., 1966; Hamill et al.,\npassing' strategy with President Obama taking the ini-\ntiative on the `economy'. This is evident from the fact\nthat objects such as `financing', `redistribution' and\n`investments' have a high POR.\nThe other defining issue related to the economy\nwas jobs creation: the object `jobs' has a mildly negative\nratio indicating that the media reported Obama out-\ncomes in jobs creation less effectively. Further, two\nimportant and defining issues of the campaign, repre-\nsented in Figure 9, are `Rights' and `Law'. `Rights' refer\nto the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. `Law'\nalso refers to the amendment to the federal marriage\nlaw. These issues were important for President Obama\nbut they were also an important focus of Mitt\nRomney's representation in the media.\nOn the negative part of the chart, we found a rather\nfrequent disapproval of `plans'. This is due to the topic\nof the Republican `economic plans'. The US economy\nand economic policy is also highly relevant in the nega-\ntive part of the chart, with a perhaps obvious negative\nlink to the recession and with the Republican recipe for\nfederal government budget cuts.\nRepublican camp. The two top positive objects in\nRomney's signed network according to Figure 10 are\n`Nomination' and `Supporters', as is the case for\nObama's signed network. The other very frequent and\npositive objects are: `Work', `Rights', `Legislation',\n`Ownership' and `Proposal'. `Work' refers to the debate\nover the work requirements necessary to access welfare\nbenefits: Romney, who strongly supported this measure,\naccused Obama of wanting to remove such requirements.\n`Changes' is also a highly positive object linked to\nRomney in the mass media data. It refers to one of the\nmottos of Romney's campaign about changing the cur-\nrent status of the US and trying to re-appropriate the\nconcept of change from Obama that was used as a\nslogan in his first presidential campaign (`Change').\nAt the opposite end of the chart we find the item\nmost negatively linked to Romney: Taxes. This rela-\ntionship reflects the great emphasis given by Romney\nand the Republican Party to tax cuts and breaks as the\neconomic solution to recession, something confirmed\nby the presence of other relevant objects in Figure 10\n(`Benefits', `Cuts', etc.).\nRomney is negatively linked to the object `Unions',\nperhaps unsurprisingly, because of his critical com-\nments about US labour unions and in particular of\nhis opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act. The\nobject `Bailout' refers to Romney's statements against\nthe car industry federal bailout in Michigan (his home\nstate), which was a major moment during the campaign\nas his opposition created problems for his own\ncampaign.\nThe object `Amnesty' refers to the amnesty given to\nillegal immigrants by the Obama administration. This\nissue is negative and linked to Romney because his pos-\nition on this issue was confused during the campaign;\nfrom an initial critique he later declared that he would\nnot revoke the amnesty. Media data widely reported his\nambivalence on the topic.\nAmong the non-economic issues, three topics have\nbeen identified in the negative quadrant: abortion, the\namendment to the marriage law and women. The first\ntwo are issues about civil rights and are negatively\nlinked to Romney. The difference between Obama\nand Romney here is evident: Obama continued the\n`issue ownership' of the Democrats on rights in add-\nition to his personal history while Romney re-affirmed\ntraditional Republican positions on abortion and\nmarriage.\nConclusions\nAnalysing the media coverage of the US election using\nour Big Data approach revealed the strategic position-\ning of actors around issues in the `mediascape' of online\nEnglish language news. We used a semantic graph\nobtained by parsing the text, identifying the noun\nphrases and the verbs and linking them and used\nSVO triplets as building blocks for a network. This\napproach is innovative and has never been applied to\na real-world dataset of this scale. Using media data and\ntransposing signed relationships in a graph, we uncov-\nered the unique mixture of endorsements and disap-\nproval that constitute the Republican and Democratic\ncamps. It is a remarkable finding that the spectrum of\npolitical positions can be reliably recovered from the set\nof claims attributed to each actor by the media report-\ning. The split of the network into the two main camps\nprovides strong evidence that the main political rela-\ntions can be extracted by this approach.\nResults suggest that the 2012 campaign was charac-\nterised by Obama's strategy of defending his record on\nthe economic policy and `owning the issue', by his being\n`on the attack' about a number of issues and forcing\nRomney and the Republicans to be defensive about\nsalient issues. The set of triplets show that the 2012\ncampaign was very much focused on the issues of the\nUS economy and civil rights for the Democrats. The\nagenda-setting effort was directed towards these two\nareas. Obama challenged the traditional Republican\nissue ownership about the economy. Other major\nactors who played an important role for Obama\nand Romney were Bill Clinton and Paul Ryan.\n14 Big Data & Society\nOverall, media reporting contained more frequently\npositive statements about the Democrats than the\nRepublicans. Overall, the Republicans were more fre-\nquently the object of negative statements either by\nDemocrats or other actors. The Republican Party\n(GOP) is the most divisive subject in the campaign,\nand is portrayed in a more negative fashion than the\nDemocrats.\nThe topological features of these semantic graphs are\nless straightforward \u00ad and perhaps more interesting to\ninterpret. The network's structurally unbalanced nature\nmarks a difference with social networks. The presence\nof unclosed triplets indicates that latent and unrealised\nties might be common in semantic graphs in which\nthere is less obligation to be `coherent'. Most likely,\nthis is because of the specific event under investigation:\na political campaign. Another structural characteristic\nwas the disassortative nature of the network, with high-\ndegree nodes connecting with low-degree nodes and\nvice versa. In disassortative networks, well-connected\nnodes join a much larger number of less well-connected\nnodes. This is typical for biological and technological\nnetworks. Real-world social networks are usually\nassortative because in real life2 everyone in a society\nwould like to connect with elites, while the elites\nwould rather communicate with those who share the\nsame social status. In our case, we studied a political\ncampaign and proposed that a disassortative network\nmight represent the network translation of a mobilisa-\ntion campaign operated by the candidates.\nThis study was made possible by the use of a com-\nputational infrastructure for the collection and analysis\nof `Big Data' representing an example of the applica-\ntion of techniques to gain insight about societal phe-\nnomena. AI and text mining techniques were used to\ndetect election-related articles, parse their content,\nextract the key actors in a narration and their relations,\nforming a network whose topology has then been ana-\nlysed. We believe that our methodology represents a\nsubstantial step forward in the linguistic analysis of\ntexts by means of extracting relational data. The\nfuture will include making better use of the information\ncoming from the parser, which can go well beyond the\nsimple SVO structure of sentences and focus also on\nautomating the creation of positive/negative verb lists\nusing the tool OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005).\nA network approach to text based on semantic\ngraphs is a promising approach to analysing large cor-\npora of texts and, with a clear application in mapping\n`mediascapes', in cases of specific events and potentially\nalso longitudinally.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by EU-funded research projects\nNotes\n1. The rationale behind this is that highly connected nodes \u00ad\nin our case mostly the two candidates \u00ad make constant\nreference to these nodes (objects). In the context of a cam-\npaign, this may be interpreted as the outcome of an\nagenda-setting effort. However, some objects might\nappear as having high authority because of the need for\na candidate to respond to a direct attack. In other words,\nauthority could be considered a proxy of both active and\npassive (forced upon) agenda setting.\n2. Online social networks can be disassortative (Hu and\n3.

This will relate to the estimation of the\nparameter of a Bernoulli distribution, so that we can\nthen calculate the confidence interval around this\n16 Big Data & Society\nestimate by using standard methods. We use the Wilson\nscore confidence interval (Wilson, 1927) for a Bernoulli\nparameter given by,\nw \u00bc ^\np \u00fe\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n^\np\u00de\nn\n\u00fe\nr\n!\n=\nn\n!\nHere ^\np is the fraction of positive observations, z=2\nis\nthe (1 \u00c0 /2) quantile of the standard normal distribu-\ntion and n is the total number of observations. The final\nscore of our links should be associated to a function of\nthe proportion of positive triplets, which is possible in\nthis case since: (P \u00c0 N)/(P \u00fe N) \u00bc 2P/(P \u00fe N) \u00c0 1; then\nobserving that P/(P \u00fe N) is the rate of positive men-\ntions, we can treat the estimation of this quantity like\nthe estimation of parameters of a Bernoulli distribu-\ntion. This score is computed using the lower bound of\nthe Wilson interval. For a confidence level of 95% the\nvalue for z=2\nand a simplified version of the Wilson score interval can\nbe obtained by considering the number of positive (P)\nand negative (N) triplets found between any two entities\na and b. The final weight on the links becomes,\n\u00c0\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq\n@\nAs we can see, this range consists of two parts: the\nmean m \u00bc P\u00fe2\nand the interval i \u00bc 2\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\np\non either\nFigure 11.

When a positive/negative relation is\nsupported by many independently generated triplets\n(from k different documents), i becomes smaller and\nthe resulting network would contain the most reliable\ninformation. Hence we can introduce a threshold to the\npercentage of i and accept relations only if i lies below\nthis threshold. We provide details on how we select this\nthreshold in the validation section.\nA3 \u00ad Variance of Bernoulli as measure of\ndivisiveness in objects\nWe compute the variance score Sv\nfor each node as\nshown in equation (2). Sorting the nodes according to\nthe score would give us a ranking of objects from the\nmost divisive to the less divisive. The same could be\ndone to find out the most divisive subjects by looking\nat the outgoing links of nodes.\nSv \u00bc\np\np \u00fe n\n \n:\nn\np \u00fe n\n \nA4 \u00ad Relevance and reliability of entities, actions\nand triplets\nThere is a need to quantify the reliability and the rele-\nvance of a triplet, as well as entities and actions to\nreduce the amount of errors in our output. To tackle\nthis problem, we first define both the weight of an entity\nand action. These weights may differ for different appli-\ncations and tasks, but allow for the ranking and selec-\ntion of the most relevant or reliable information to\ninclude in the network. Relevance of entities or actions\nto a specific topic can be gauged by comparing their\nrelative frequency in a topic-specific corpus with that of\na separate, static background corpus. Equation (5)\nshows the weighting method,\nwi \u00bc\nWhere wi\nrefers to the weight of the entity/action i;\nf \u00f0i, D1\u00de and f \u00f0i, D2\u00de refer to the frequency of the entity/\naction in a given corpus D1\nand a background corpus\n, respectively. The highest weighted entities/actions\ncan be considered as key entities/actions in the given\ncorpus.\nHowever, this measure of relevance is not appropri-\nate in all domains when key entities in the topic-specific\ncorpus are also very widely used in the background\ncorpus, the relevance weighting will fail to give greater\nweighting to the most important entities. In this case,\nkey entities can be identified by their absolute number\nof mentions in the text as we do for the elections study.\nTherefore we use the top 100 most frequent entities\nin the 2012 elections corpus as key entities. In this\nstudy we are interested in analysing networks of posi-\ntive/negative relationships between entities and hence\nwe use all actions denoting political support or\nopposition identified in the corpus for the analysis.\nTriplets containing key entities are considered reliable\nif they have been seen in more than k independent\ndocuments.\nA5 System pipeline\nWe describe here the software pipeline that we have\nused in our experiments. The two guiding principles\nwere for us to re-use existing tools where possible,\nand to make a system that can scale to large corpora.\nFigure 12 shows the system pipeline. Each component\nof the pipeline is explained in detail.\nCo-reference\nResolution\nAnaphora\nResolution\nParser\nExtract\nData\nTagged\nInformation\nExtract\nTriplets\nFilter Triplets\nwith\nKey Entities and\nActions\nStore in\nTriplet DB\nCreate\nNetworks\nWeight\nEntities,\nActions\nParser Output\nCorpus\nFigure 12. System pipeline.\n18 Big Data & Society\n. News corpus \u00ad The system uses articles contained in\nan available news corpus to perform the task.\n. Extract data \u00ad We could first extract the content\nfrom articles that are specific to a domain which is\nof interest to the analysis, e.g. crime, elections,\nsports, etc.\n. Co-reference resolution \u00ad The text in every indivi-\ndual article is processed for named entity co-refer-\nence resolution. The Orthomatcher module in\nANNIE Information extraction system in General\nArchitecture for Text Engineering (GATE)\n(Cunningham, 2002) distribution is used to perform\nthis task.\n. Anaphora resolution \u00ad Once the co-references have\nbeen resolved the Pronominal resolution module in\nANNIE is used to perform anaphora resolution. The\nsystem solves pronouns in all forms that are identi-\nfied by GATE.\n. Minipar parser \u00ad We use the parser Minipar (Lin,\n2003) to parse the above processed text. The parser\ntags each word of the sentence with its grammatical\nrelation to it. Minipar has its own limitations since it\ncannot parse sentences more than 1024 characters\nlong. On the other hand, we found that this length\nexceeds the size of a typical sentence in the news\nwhich is made of approximately 500 characters.\n. Extract triplets \u00ad From the Minipar parser output\nwe extract words tagged with s (subject), i (verb) and\nobj (object of the verb) relations. A SVO triplet is\nformed out of these words if the s, i, obj relations are\nfound in the sentence in this chronological order.\n. Store in triplet DB \u00ad All extracted triplets are stored in\nthe Triplets database along with the article informa-\ntion from which they were extracted. This includes,\narticle date, title, content and article feed URL. We\nalso store the Minipar parser output for each article.\n. Weight entities and actions \u00ad Entities (subject/object\nof triplet) and actions are weighted according to\nequation (2) and this weight is used to rank and\nselect the highest ranking candidates as key entities\nand key actions.\n. Filter triplets with key entities and actions \u00ad We then\nfilter the triplets that have key entities as subjects/\nobjects and key actions as verbs.\n. Create networks \u00ad Directed networks are created\nwith the triplets where the nodes are entities and\nthe edges are actions linking them. To create net-\nworks we use Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003)\nwhich is a general platform for complex network\nanalysis and visualization. We also used JUNG3\nfor automatically generating networks and analysing\nnetwork properties.\n. Weight positive and negative relations between enti-\nties \u00ad Positive and negative relations indicate friend-\nship or hostility between actors like mentioned\nbefore. In order to identify the strength of these rela-\ntions we introduce a weighting method which is\nshown in equation (3). This would result in entities\nlinked by a positive/negative link with weights.\n. Create signed networks \u00ad We create signed networks\nwhere nodes are entities and edges are the positive/\nnegative links with weights.\n. Spectral graph partitioning \u00ad Signed networks are\npartitioned using spectral graph partitioning methods\nto assess the degree to which actors/objects belong to\nor are in favor of one of two parties, in the assump-\ntion that the networks are naturally organised into\ntwo main communities. We used the JAMA4 matrix\npackage for java to perform this task.\n. List of entities showing partitions \u00ad Once the net-\nwork is partitioned we obtain a list of entities\nwhich shows the association of them to one of the\ntwo communities in the network.\nA6 Validation\nEstimating the performance of our methodology is a\ndifficult but important task since there are no accessible\ncorpora that have been annotated in terms of SVO\ntriplets that we can use in order to measure the preci-\nsion and recall of our method, and there are no other\nnetworks of actors/objects that have been generated by\nhand, based on a corpus. Nonetheless, we can measure\nvarious aspects, in order to increase our confidence in\nthe method, and obtain a rigorous statistical estimate of\nperformance.\nValidation of triplets\nWe used a corpus covering the Civil Rights movement\nin Northern Ireland for which 72 manually extracted\ntriplets were available (De Fazio, 2013). We applied our\nmethodology, without filtering `reliable' triplets due to\nthe limitations of the data. Our method extracted 66\ntriplets, of which 41 were correct and 31 were missed.\nThis gives us 62% precision and 57% recall in the very\nunfavourable case when we cannot use any filtering for\nreliable triplets. This means that there is a 38% prob-\nability of a triplet being incorrect, if it has been seen just\nonce. If we use this figure as the error rate for triplets\nseen once, we can use it in a model for the probability\nof error in triplets seen more than k times, which would\nbe 0.38k. This is true under the assumption that the\ntriplets seen more than k times are independently gen-\nerated. By only selecting triplets that are seen at least\nthree times we achieve a 5% error rate. But we use\nhigher values for k according to the Wilson score\nmodel.\nWe also analysed by hand 75 triplets coming from\nthe 2012 US election campaign, and checked how many\nwere actually present in the articles that were indicated\nby our pipeline as supporting them. Of 75, 72 were\nactually present in the article achieving 96% precision.\nThis gives us a clear estimate of precision after our\nfiltering step, but no estimation of recall, which we\nexpect to be low.\nValidation of the networks\nOur next validation method was intended to measure\nthe extent to which our analysis captures the division\ninto two camps of the US political actors/objects. We\nWelch, 1990), a central part of non-parametric test-\ning. It directly obtains the distribution of the test\nstatistic under the null hypothesis by calculating all\npossible values of the test statistic under rearrange-\nments of the treatments (labels) on the observed data\npoints. The one-sided p value of the test is calculated\nas the proportion of sampled permutations where the\ntest statistic is greater than or equal to that in the\noriginal dataset.\nWe obtain the eigenvalue distance d between the\n`Republicans' and the `Democrats' in the entity list\nand use it as the test statistic. We compare it with dis-\nobtained by taking the distance between the\nsame actors from 100 randomised networks. Here we\nuse two random network models, Erdo\n\u00a8 s\u00adRe\n\u00b4 nyi (Erdo\n\u00a8 s\nand Re\n\u00b4 nyi, 1960) and Random re-wiring to generate the\nrandom networks.\nFinally we check for the number of times r that\n! d in the 100 random networks to calculate the p\nvalue which is r/100. Table 2 shows the resulting p\nvalues obtained for experiments performed on the\n2012 and the previous election cycles. It shows that\nthe p value is very low for the same signal appearing\nby chance. Therefore we could say that the network\ntopology contains meaningful information.\nWe also checked the effect on p values when different\nthresholds are introduced to the confidence interval i in\nour weighting equation (3) which is, i \u00bc 2\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\np\n. This\nhelped us to select an optimal threshold for i. We expect\nthat p value of the resulting network should be 0.01\nand the network should contain more information as\npossible. Table 3 shows the p values obtained for dif-\nferent thresholds of i according to the two randomisa-\ntion models. According to our selection criteria 35% is\nconsidered optimal since in both cases the p value\nis 0.01 and also the network is large enough and con-\ntains more information.\nWe also note that the p values are not significant for\nvalues of i in two different cases. For example in\nthat the p values are insignificant and this could be\nbecause the network contains less information. On the\nother hand, when values for i are very high (43%) the\nnetwork contains more noise, which in turn causes the\nsignal to disappear and therefore leads to insignificant p\nvalues. Networks for i \u00bc 32% and 35% are the most\nsignificant according to Table 3 and 35% fits our\ncriterion.\nThe statistical significance study on the elections net-\nwork and the precision estimates performed on the tri-\nplets we have extracted point in the same direction: that\nour system extracts very precise information that repre-\nsents the true relations among the entities in the corpus.\nEstimating the recall would be harder, but since we\nwork in the setting of very large datasets, we choose\nto focus on obtaining high precision rather than high\nrecall.\nTable 3. p values for distance d1\nnetworks for different values of i.\nThreshold (i)\nNo of\nnodes (n)\np value\n(random rewiring)\np value\n(Erdo\n\u00a8s-Re\n\u00b4nyi)\nTable 2. p values for distance d1\nnetworks.\nYear\np value\n(random rewiring)\np value\n(Erdo\n\u00a8s-Re\n\u00b4nyi)\n20 Big Data & Society\nA7 \u00ad Properties of networks\nA number of statistical properties have been developed\nto capture features of social networks (Mac Carron and\nKenna, 2012). Some structural properties are quantified\nusing the characteristic path length l, the longest geo-\ndesic lmax and the clustering coefficient C. In this sec-\ntion we will discuss various properties of networks\nwhich are prevalent in real world networks and com-\npare it with the results obtained for election networks.\nHierarchical networks. Complex networks have a modu-\nlar structure implying that groups of nodes organise in\na hierarchical manner into increasingly larger groups.\nHierarchical networks are characterised by a power law\ndependency of the clustering coefficient C(k) on the\nnode degree according to equation (6). This implies\nthat while nodes with a small degree are part of\nhighly cohesive, densely interlinked clusters, the hubs\nin the network are not, as their neighbors have a small\nchance of linking to each other. Therefore the hubs play\nthe important role of bridging the many small commu-\nnities of clusters into a single, integrated network.\nC\u00f0k\u00de $\nk\nWe tested for hierarchical structure in the networks\nby plotting the average clustering coefficient C(k) vs.\ndegree k. Figure 13a shows the plot in a log\u00adlog\nscale. The nodes with a smaller degree present higher\nclustering than those with a larger degree and the decay\napproximately follows equation (6). This indicates that\nthe nodes with a low degree are part of densely inter-\nlinked clusters, while the nodes with a high degree,\nwhich are the hubs, bring together the many small com-\nmunities of clusters into a single, integrated network.\nCandidates' ideograms are attempts at creating\nan organic network of issues (objects) and actors\n(subjects). Moreover, the hierarchical structure of the\nsemantic graph represents the hierarchical nature of\nconcepts indicating the presence of overarching hubs\nthat represent semantic domains (for example, the\n`economy', `civil rights', etc.).\nAssortativity. Assortativity is the measure of the prefer-\nence of nodes to attach to other similar or dissimilar\nnodes. Assortativity is high when high-degree nodes\ntend to connect to other high-degree nodes; it is low\nwhen high-degree nodes are linked to low-degree\nnodes. Assortativity can also be tested by plotting the\ndegree of the neighbours knn\nof a vertex as a function of\nits degree k. A positive slope indicates assortativity and\na negative slope indicates disassortativity.\nFigure 13b plots the average hknn\ni of the degrees of the\nneighbours of vertices of degree k. It shows\nthe disassortative nature of the network where high-\ndegree nodes tend to connect with low-degree nodes\nand vice versa. This could represent a network expression\nof a `mobilisation' of symbolic resources. Real-world\n(a) (b)\nHierarchy Assortativity\nFigure 13 Plot (a) shows the average clustering coefficient c\u00f0k\u00de vs. degree k and plot (b) shows the average hknni of the degrees of\nthe neighbors of vertices of degree k. (a) Hierarchy and (b) assortativity.\nsocial networks are usually assortative because in real life\neveryone would like to connect with the elites in a society;\nwhereas the elites would rather communicate with those\nwho share their own social status. The only times when\nelites appeal to the masses are special occasions such as\npolitical elections. In a semantic graph, the disassortative\nnature of the network can be interpreted as the mobilisa-\ntion of candidates on many different issues, even marginal\nones, to attract the largest amount of voters possible. In\nother words, it represents the semantic equivalent of poli-\ntical rallies in small towns that, nevertheless might have\nsome significance for the overall electoral result.\nStructural balance of networks. In addition to the contri-\nbution to communication theory and political science\nliterature, we aim to contribute to the current debate on\nstructural balance theory in social networks. Structural\nbalance theory originated in social psychology during\nthe mid-twentieth century. As formulated by Heider\ntheoretic language by Cartwright and Harary (1956),\nstructural balance considers the possible ways in\nwhich triangles on three individuals can be signed\nand posits that triangles with three positive signs\n(three mutual friends) and those with one positive\nsign (two friends with a common enemy) are more plau-\nsible and hence should be more prevalent in real net-\nworks than triangles with two positive signs\n(two enemies with a common friend) or none (three\nmutual enemies). Balanced triangles with three positive\nedges exemplify the principle that `the friend of my\nfriend is my friend', whereas those with one positive\nand two negative edges capture the notions that `the\nfriend of my enemy is my enemy', `the enemy of my\nfriend is my enemy' and `the enemy of my enemy is my\nfriend'.\nEven though balance theory has been intended for\nundirected networks, it has also been applied to direc-\nted networks by ignoring direction. The work by\nLeskovec et al. (2010) analysed theories of balance\nand status in the context of social media sites using\nthe triad configurations of their networks, investigating\nthe extent to which each theory helped explain the link-\ning behavior of users on these sites. Hassan et al. (2012)\ncompare the predictions of network edge signs made by\ntheir system to the structural balance theory by count-\ning the frequencies of different types of triads in the\npredicted network.\nWe study structural balance in our election networks\nbased on closed triads, which are acyclic or cyclic and\nmutual dyads. The acyclic triad depicts transitivity. The\ntriad involving actors i, j and k is transitive if whenever\ni ! j and j ! k then i ! k (Wasserman, 1994). A\nmutual dyad occurs when i ! j and j ! i. According\nto Heider, we know the rules for balance in transitive\ntriads and mutual dyads, but in the case of cyclic triads\nwe introduce rules for balance.\nThere are six possible closed triads for transitivity in\na network and four possible closed triads for the cyclic\ncase. Figure 14 shows the six different configurations of\ntransitive triads and four configurations of cyclic triads\nwith the number of transitive and cyclic triples in each\nFigure 14. Configurations of transitive and cyclic triads in a network.\n22 Big Data & Society\ncase. We analyse structural balance in transitive and\ncyclic triads for all these configurations separately.\nWhen considering positive and negative signs on\ntriads there could be eight types for a single transitive\ntriad as shown in Figure 15. According to the balance\ntheory cases 1, 2, 7 and 8 are balanced. For the cyclic\ncase there could be four types as Figure 16 shows. We\nconsider a cyclic triad balanced when the product of the\nsigns is positive. Since (\u00c01)n is = \u00fe1 for n = even and\nequal to \u00c01 for n = odd, any network path containing\nan even number of opposition statements indicates a\nsupport from the root to the leaf of the path. Since\nwe assume that any agent should not be critical of\nitself, we expect that all closed cycles will contain\nonly an even number of negative edges, in order to be\nself consistent. Hence cases 1 and 2 are balanced. In a\nmutual dyad there could be two positives (1), two nega-\ntives (2) or one positive and one negative (3). In this\ncase (1) and (2) are balanced.\nWe present our results on structural balance for each\ntype of triad shown in Figure 14. This includes the\nanalysis of structural balance in transitive, cyclic\ntriads and mutual dyads in networks of different sizes\nfrom the US elections.\nIn all the configurations in Figure 14 we analyse the\ntransitive, cyclic triads and the mutual dyads separately\nfor structural balance. Our experiments are based on 11\nelection networks of different sizes N. We generate\nthese networks by using different confidence thresholds\nfor Wilson score shown in equation (3). For each net-\nwork we calculate the fraction of balanced triads Tb\nand then recalculate the same value Tr\nrandom networks. We generate 100 random networks\nby removing signs from triads and producing them\nrandomly but keeping the fraction of positive links fp\nin the network the same. We count the number of times\nm that Tr\n, hence our p value pT\nis estimated as\nfollows:\npT \u00bc\nm\nTable 4 shows the scores for Tb\nand pT\nfor the total\nnumber of transitive triads found in all types of triads\nin Figure 14. In Table 5 we report the scores for each\ntriad type separately. Tn\nrefers to the number of tran-\nsitive triads in each case. According to Table 4 we see\nthat pT\nis very high and 14% < Tb\ncates very poor structural balance overall. In Table 5\nwe see that type 1 and type 3 triads contribute signifi-\ncantly to the overall imbalance since the majority of\nimbalanced transitive triads lie in these configurations.\nWhen carefully looking at the signs in triad type 1\nand 3 we find that the most dominating transitive triad\nis the one with three negative links (\u00c0,\u00c0,\u00c0). For triad\ntype 3 in the majority of the cases the signs on the\nmutual edge were negative. Therefore according to\nthis triad type 2 entities A and B have some sort of\ndisagreement between each other, while they both\nalso disagree about another entity C.\nIt shows that when candidates both disapproved on\none issue usually they still disapproved of each other,\ntherefore not creating any common ground. Hence,\nFigure 15. Eight types of positive and negatively signed transitive triads.\nFigure 16. Four types of positive and negatively signed cyclic\ntriads.\nTable 4. Structural balance in all transitive triads in total.\nN fp Tn Tb pT\nthere might be a substantial latent `convergence space'\non issues that is not expressed because of the competi-\ntive nature of the campaign.\nTable 6 shows the scores for Tb\nand pT\nfor the total\nnumber of cyclic triads found. Here we see that\nremain low in\nmost cases other than the largest network. We see\nthat structural balance fails in cases where there is\nless information in the networks (N 70) or there is\nmore noise (N \u00bc 1047). Also we found that many\nbalanced cyclic triads were found in triad type 5 accord-\ning to Figure 14 with negative signs on mutual edges\nand a positive sign on the remaining edge. An increased\nnumber of this type had caused the improvement in\nbalance in the cyclic triads.\nTable 7 shows Db\n(fraction of balanced dyads) and\npD\nscores for mutual dyads found in the network. pD\nrefers to the p value of the number of times that\nDr > Db\nis the fraction of\nbalanced dyads in a random network.\nIt is interesting to see that 81% < Db < 100% while\npD\nis 0 for all cases, indicating that they are significantly\nbalanced. We found that the dyad type most likely to\ncontribute to the balance was the dyad with two nega-\ntive (\u00c0,\u00c0) links. Hence the network shows very high\nbalance in the dyad level.\nFrom the experiments we can say that election net-\nworks do not show balance at the triad level while they\ndo at the cyclic level and dyad level. Triadic closure and\ntransitivity appears not to be characteristics of our\nTable 5. Structural balance of transitive triads in the six different triad type configurations.\nN Tn Tb pT N Tn Tb pT\n24 Big Data & Society\nsemantic graphs and this can be intuitively interpreted\nas a less `coherent' set of signed ties. This intriguing\nfinding suggests that semantic graphs might be charac-\nterised by a low level of `coherence' and the unbalanced\nnature can be explained in the context of what the\nsemantic graphs represent. In the case of the represen-\ntation of the US election, in the context of competition\namong political actors, coherent positioning on issues\ndoes not translate into a similar endorsement of other\nactors that might share the same views. However, at the\ndyad level, balance is present and especially in the nega-\ntive form (\u00c0 \u00c0), suggesting tested here is a great deal of\ncommon ground regarding what is disapproved of that\nbinds the two parties and candidates.\nA8 \u00ad Network partition method\nThe network should be partitioned into two classes\nsuch that nodes in the same class are linked by positive\nedges and nodes in different classes are linked by nega-\ntive edges. The division of a network into two parts can\nbe a computationally expensive step, but the\noptimisation problem can be relaxed, reducing to a\nsimple algebraic task by introducing the approximation\nthat the adjacency matrix of the network is symmetric\nand positive definite, an assumption that can be readily\nsatisfied. We lose information at this stage by ignoring\nthe direction, but it is done only for the partitioning of\nthe network. For the rest of the analysis we use the\nactual directed network.\nGiven a network with its adjacency matrix A, we\nmake it symmetric by adding it to its transpose result-\ning in matrix M \u00bc A \u00fe AT.\nIn matrix M where Mij 2 f\u00c01, \u00fe 1g we want to assign\neach node to one of the two classes f\u00c01, \u00fe 1g as men-\ntioned. This leads to the following optimisation problem.\nargmax\nX\nij\nMij\nyi\nyj\nWe relax this problem (which is NP hard) by allow-\ning the membership function of each node to assume\nvalues in <\u00f0 y 2 <\u00de while keeping the norm of y fixed to\navoid trivial solutions.\nargmax\ny2<,jj yjj\u00bcm\nX\nij\nMij\nyi\nyj\nThe problem now reduces to the following optimisa-\ntion problem.\nargmax\ny\nyTMy\nyTy\nThis is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem,\nMy \u00bc y by Rayleigh quotient (Horn and Johnson,\n2012) since M is symmetric and positive definite by\nconstruction, and therefore is efficiently solvable.\nThe real value assigned to each node in the eigen-\nvector can be interpreted as the degree to which it\nbelongs to one of the two classes. Each eigenvector\ncorresponds to a possible bi-partitioning of the\ngraph, with the quality of the partition being repre-\nsented by the corresponding eigenvalue. Therefore it\nis natural to make use of the first eigenvector, possibly\nlooking at the second one when the eigenvalues are\nvery similar.\nA9 \u00ad List of verbs\nSee Table 8.\nA10 \u00ad Narrative centrality by candidate\nOnce we have partitioned the network into two compo-\nnents, by analysing the first eigenvector of the\nTable 6. Structural balance in all cyclic triads in total.\nN fp Tn Tb pT\nTable 7. Structural balance in all dyads.\nN Dn Db pD\nadjacency matrix, we can then analyse separately the\ntwo resulting sub-networks, one relative to the\nObama camp and the other relative to the Romney\ncamp. In this section we will report the network cen-\ntrality and their interpretation in Obama's and\nRomney's ideographs separately. The networks are\nshown in the main text.\nObama's network. Table 9 presents the most prominent\nobject defined by a set of network metrics in the\nDemocratic part of the network. Let us consider four\nmain network metrics: degree, betweenness, closeness\ncentralities and authority.\nDegree. Degree centrality indicates how prominent\nan object is in the network by `brute force' of number of\nincoming and outgoing links. As shown in Table 9, in\nthe case of the Democratic network, the highest degree\nobjects are: Obama, President (in this case acting as a\nsynonym for Obama), Clinton, Americans, Economy,\nCampaign, etc. Several items are of particular interest\nhere: Economy, Plan, Rights, Proposals and GOP. The\neconomy was the most salient issue upon which the\ncampaign focused, with an indication of a clear plan\nto recover the US economy. Hence, it is not surprising\nthat `economy' has a high degree centrality in the\nDemocrats' network. The presence of both `Plan' and\n`Proposals' suggests the Obama campaign was focused\non presenting defined courses of action rather than\nprinciples. This is in line with Conway et al. (2012)\nwho analysed Obama's strategy during the 2012 cam-\npaign in terms of the complexity of its rhetoric.\nInterestingly enough, the object `GOP' (Grand Old\nParty) or the Republican Party is among those with\nhighest degree centrality.\nBetweenness. The objects with the highest between-\nness centralities in the Democratic network were:\nObama, President, Campaign, Clinton, Americans,\nTable 9. Network centrality measures for the Democrats' sub-network.\nBetweeness centrality In-closeness centrality Degree Hub Authority\nObama Campaign Obama Obama Obama\nPresident Law President President President\nCampaign Redistribution Clinton Speech Economy\nClinton Pledge Americans Campaign Plan\nAmericans Ads Economy Biden Rights\nBiden Overhaul Campaign Candidate Proposals\nSpeech Biden Biden Clinton Efforts\n. . .

This is unsurprising because\nObama's policies and standpoints on a wide range of\ndifferent issues were the main link bringing about these\nnodes. The same can be said about Campaign, Clinton\nand Biden. The other bridging node is `speech', because\nthe links between issues were made in Obama's (and\nClinton's or Biden's) speeches. Thus the speech is the\n`bridge' between the different issues in the sense\nthat they bring the issues together. The other interesting\nitem is `Americans'. This is the object that Obama's\ncampaign used as the noun for American citizens. It\nmarks the difference with Romney's high betweenness\nitem `People' (as we will see in the next Section), which\nhas a Republican connotation.\nIn-closeness. Table 9 reports `in-closeness' centrality.\nConsidering the objects with the highest in-closeness cen-\ntrality in Obama's network, we find objects such as:\n`Campaign', `Law', `Redistribution', `Pledge', `Ads',\n`Overhaul', `Biden', `Investments', etc. These objects are\na mixture of policy and economic tools (law, redistribu-\ntion, overhaul of a policy, investments) and contexts\n(Campaign, Ads, Pledge). The vice-president Biden can\nalso be considered as a context in the sense of being the\ncontext of a given Obama statement. This centrality mea-\nsure gives an idea of the Democrats' domains of state-\nments that can be compared to the Republicans'.\nAuthority. As discussed previously, identifying\nobjects with high authority can help us to define the\nagenda-setting efforts of each of the two parties.\nUsing Table 9 to navigate the objects with the highest\nauthority in the Democratic network, we can find:\nObama/President, Economy, Plan, Rights, Proposals,\nEfforts, Biden/Vice-President, Speech, Remarks,\nElection, Policies, Campaign and Debbie Stabenow.\nThe latter refers to the Democratic Senate candidate\nin Michigan and the related Republican `Asian Ad',\nan unfortunate television advert for the Republican\ncandidate Peter Hoekstra. Beside the expected presence\nof Obama and Biden, the other objects are indicative\nof a campaign strongly focused on the economy and on\nactions and tools (plan, proposals, efforts, policies)\ncombined with an emphasis on rights. In the above\ndiscussion about issue ownership during US presiden-\ntial campaigns, the latter topic has traditionally been a\nDemocrat theme. It appears that the 2012 campaign\nwas very much focused on the `Economy' and\n`Rights' for the Democrats, and the agenda-setting\neffort was directed towards these two issues.\nMitt Romney's network. Table 10 presents the most pro-\nminent objects defined by a set of network metrics in\nthe GOP of the network. Let us consider four main\nnetwork metrics: degree, betweenness, closeness cen-\ntralities and authority.\nDegree centrality. The top two objects in terms of\ndegree centrality in the Republican network are\nobviously related to the presidential `ticket': Mitt\nRomney and Paul Ryan. The two main actors of the\nRepublican campaign are followed by two nouns:\npeople and plans. We have mentioned earlier the his-\ntorical and symbolic importance of this term of the\nGOP. It is, therefore, unsurprising that it is among\nthe objects with a very high degree in the network of\nTable 10. Network centrality measures for the Republicans' sub-network.\nBetweeness centrality In-closeness centrality Degree Hub Authority\nRomney Amendment Romney Romney Romney\nRyan Work Ryan People Plans\nPeople Proposal Plans Supporters People\nRepublicans Breaks People Ryan Mourdock\n. . .

Voices Stance . . . Legislation\nBill Amendment . . . Cuts\nclaims. Another object with high degree centrality is\n`Plans', which refers to the Republican initiative of pre-\nscriptions for the US economy.\n`Voters' and `Supporters' also have a high degree\ncentrality as they constitute the main targets of the\ncampaign. The other target of many Republican state-\nments was the object `People' (we have previously dis-\ncussed the symbolic value of this term in the\nRepublican political vocabulary).\nThere are, however, two objects that are related to\ncontroversies and attacks from the Democrats. The first\nis `Mourdock'. This refers to the controversial public\nstatement on abortion and rape made by the\nRepublican senator Richard Mourdock.5\nThe second issue related to an `attack' from\nObama's campaign is the object `Bill'. It refers to the\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan\n`blocking' a farm bill that Obama claimed would `pro-\nvide relief and certainty to US farmers and ranchers'\nduring the worst drought in more than 50 years.\nAnother interesting object with high degree centrality\nis `Israel'. Candidate Romney travelled to Israel during\nthe campaign and expressed his strong support for the\nIsraeli state and his policy in the Middle East. This\ntopic generated a substantial amount of discussion in\nthe media.\nBetweenness. In the case of the Republican network,\nthe objects with high betweenness centralities are all\nactors: `Romney', `Ryan', `People' and `Republicans'.\nAlso in the case of the Democratic network, actors were\nthe most bridging objects, but it appears that for\nRepublicans there are the two candidates \u00ad Romney\nand Ryan \u00ad and then the `People' or the GOP. By\ncomparison, in Obama's network there is the presence\nof Bill Clinton in addition to Joe Biden, there are the\n`Americans' rather than `People', and there is no party\nbut rather Obama's `speeches'.\nIn-closeness. As discussed in the case of the\nDemocrats' network, these are objects that in virtue\nof their high in-closeness centrality are related to con-\ntext as `qualifiers'. In the Republican network, we find\nobjects such as: `Amendment', `Work', `Proposal' and\n`Breaks'. Some of these objects have been explained\nbefore, but to summarise: `Amendment' refers to the\namendment to the federal marriage law to allow\nsame-sex marriage; `Work' refers to the work require-\nments necessary to receive welfare benefits; `Breaks' is\nrelated to tax breaks and `proposal' to the Republican\nanti-recession economic policies; `Bill' to Obama's\nattack on Paul Ryan about the Farms Bill. Another\nrelevant object is `PBS', which refers to Romney's com-\nments on public broadcasting framed by the `Sesame\nStreet' comment.6 What is evident is that some of the\nobjects with high in-closeness centrality come from the\nRepublican campaigns but others are forced upon\nthem.\nAuthority. As mentioned before, authority centrality\nrepresents a proxy of agenda-setting efforts. In this\nrespect, the objects with the highest authority centrality\nin the Republican network have been already encoun-\ntered in the above description. Not surprisingly, the\nhighest object in terms of authority is `Romney'. This\nis followed by `Plans', `People', `Decision' and\n`Proposal', all of which are keywords of Romney's cam-\npaign and language. However, there are three objects\nindicating a reaction rather than an initiative in terms\nof agenda setting: `Mourdock', `Bill' and `Public\nBroadcasting'. As discussed above, all three objects\nare related to attacks from Obama's campaign.\n`Israel' is also present among the objects with high\nauthority and it refers to Romney's speech in Israel,\nabout US Middle East foreign policy.\nThe remaining objects with high authority are what\nnow appear to be important issues in the 2012\nRepublican campaign: tax breaks (Breaks), the amend-\nment to the federal marriage law (Amendment), the\nwork requirements for welfare benefits (Work).\n28 Big Data & Society"
