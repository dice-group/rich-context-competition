The proportion of adults with diabetes meeting ADA recommendations for\n(A1C), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, renal function,\nnutrient intake, smoking, pneumococcal vaccination, and physical activity was estimated.\n36.0, and 65.0% were classified as low risk for HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyc-\nerides, respectively. Nearly 40% met blood pressure recommendations, 66% had normal renal\nfunction, and daily nutrient recommendations for protein, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, and\nreported not smoking at the time of the exam, only 38.2% reported ever having had a pneumo-\ncoccal immunization, and 28.2% reported getting the recommended level of physical activity.\nRace, age, duration of diabetes, and education affected achievement of ADA recommendations.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Achievement of ADA clinical practice recommendations is far from ad-\nequate in U.S. adults with diabetes.\nControl of blood glucose, obesity, and\nhypertension has beneficial health\neffects for diabetic individuals and\nthose at high risk for diabetes (1\u00ad4). Be-\nhavioral factors such as healthy eating,\navoidance of smoking, physical activity,\nand weight control also have beneficial\nhealth effects for people with diabetes and\nthose at high risk (4\u00ad8). However, some\nof these risk factors are poorly controlled\nin diabetic individuals (9).\nEach year, the American Diabetes As-\nsociation (ADA) publishes updated clini-\ncal practice recommendations. These are\navailable in the public domain (10). For\npublic health planning purposes and to\nmore effectively allocate health care re-\nsources, it is of interest to understand to\nwhat degree diabetic individuals meet\nspecific clinical practice recommenda-\ntions (1) and what clinical and demo-\ngraphic characteristics are associated with\nreduced achievement of these recommen-\ndations (2). The purpose of this report is\nto define the proportion of U.S. adults\nwith diabetes who meet selected ADA\nclinical practice recommendations. A sec-\nondary goal is to examine the association\nbetween demographic and clinical char-\nacteristics and achievement of ADA rec-\nommendations.\nMETHODS -- Data on ADA clinical\npractice recommendations are available\nin the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nTable 1 summarizes selected ADA\nclinical practice recommendations that\nof NHANES participants for whom rele-\nvant data were collected.

The online appendix\n(available at http://care.diabetesjournals.\norg) contains detailed information on\ndata available for each of these subgroups.\nFor race, the 2 test was used with whites\nas the reference group. For duration of\ndiabetes, household income, and educa-\ntion, tests for trend were conducted using\nlogistic regression. The 2 test was used to\nexamine insurance status in relation to\nADA recommendations.\nData are weighted to the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population of the U.S.\nAnalyses include sample weights to adjust\nfor unequal probabilities of selection,\noversampling, and nonresponse. Analy-\nses were performed using SAS and\nSUDAAN software. The complex sam-\npling design of NHANES produces means\nand proportions that are potentially more\nsensitive to sample size than conventional\nrandom sampling designs. Design effects,\nwhich measure the extent to which an es-\ntimate is influenced by the complex sam-\nple design, were calculated for all means\nand proportions reported here (26). The\nstatistical reliability of reported estimates\nwas evaluated based on the design effects\nand sample size according to NHANES\nguidelines (13\u00ad15). Estimates that may be\nstatistically unstable are noted with an as-\nterisk in the figure.

Findings were\nmore favorable for triglycerides: 65.0% of\nthe sample was in the low-risk category.\nClinical albuminuria was present in 10%\nof the sample, and 24% had microalbu-\nminuria. Forty percent of diabetic adults\nmet recommendations for blood pres-\nsure.\nFindings for dietary recommenda-\ntions were mixed: while nearly 65% re-\nported recommended levels of protein,\nonly 18.3% reported getting the recom-\nmended amount of fiber. Eighty-one per-\ncent of the sample reported being\nnonsmokers at the time of the interview.\nAlthough 40% of the sample reported\never having a pneumococcal immuniza-\ntion, coverage differed substantially by\nand 75 age groups, respectively, re-\nported pneumococcal vaccination. Only\n28% of nondisabled diabetic adults re-\nported getting recommended physical\nactivity.\nHDL targets appeared to be met more\nfrequently among blacks than whites and\nHispanics, but renal function and A1C\ntargets were met less frequently among\nboth blacks and Hispanics (Fig. 1).\nLonger duration of diabetes was associ-\nated with poorer renal function, and peo-\nple who were newly diagnosed with\ndiabetes were much more likely to meet\nthe A1C recommendation than those with\nlonger duration. An unexpected pattern\nof more frequent achievement of HDL\nrecommendations was observed with in-\ncreasing duration of diabetes. For blood\npressure and albumin-to-creatinine ratio,\nhigher income and higher educational\nachievement tended to be associated with\nmore frequent achievement of recom-\nmendations. There was a suggestion that\nhaving insurance improved achievement\nof practice recommendations for several\nfactors, but none of these relationships\nwas statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS -- These nationally\nrepresentative data demonstrate hetero-\ngeneity in achievement of selected ADA\nclinical practice recommendations among\nU.S. adults with diabetes and raise impor-\ntant questions about how to most effec-\ntively allocate public health resources\ntoward improved achievement of these\nrecommendations.\nOnly 49.8% of diabetic adults aged\n18 years met the recommendation of\nA1C 7%, a finding similar to a report\nfrom NHANES III showing that the ADA\nrecommendation of 7% was met by\nmade the important observation that gly-\ncemic control has not materially im-\nproved in U.S. adults with diabetes over\nAn NHANES III study highlighted\nethnic differences in glycemic control,\nwith black women and Mexican-\nAmerican men having worse control rela-\ntive to other groups (27). Our data show\nthat black and Mexican-American dia-\nbetic individuals met A1C recommenda-\ntions less frequently than whites.\nSupplemental analyses of A1C data re-\nvealed that white women met recommen-\ndations for glycemic control most\nfrequently (59.5%), and Mexican-\nAmerican women met them least fre-\nquently (39.6%). Other race-sex groups\nwere intermediate in their achievement of\nglycemic control. Thus, with the excep-\ntion of white women, glycemic control\nrecommendations are currently met by\nless than half of all major U.S. race-sex\ngroups with diabetes.\nOnly 27.4% of diabetic adults met\nrecommendations for HDL cholesterol.\nWe observed a curious trend in HDL cho-\nlesterol, with an apparent trend toward\ngreater achievement of target with in-\ncreasing duration of diabetes.

Among diabetic adults\nage 20 years who did not report difficulty walking quarter mile or walking up 10 steps without resting.\nSome categories do not add to 100.0 due to rounding.\nADA recommendations in U.S. adults with diabetes\npreting this observation, it is useful to\npoint out that fibrates (gemfibrizil and fe-\nnofibrate) and niacin are the primary\ndrugs for treating triglycerides and raising\nHDL cholesterol. However, niacin is rela-\ntively contraindicated in diabetes and the\nfibrates are underused because of the lack\nof consensus on treatment of triglycer-\nides. This lack of consensus is due in part\nto the discrepancy between ADA and Na-\ntional Cholesterol Education Program\nrecommendations for treatment of tri-\nAlthough 65% of the sample met rec-\nommendations for triglyceride levels, the\nmg/dl. A potential explanation for this ob-\nservation is that the only studies investi-\ngating triglyceride intervention at this\ntime were the Helsinki Heart Study and\nthe Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention\nTrial (29,30). Neither was specific to dia-\nbetes, and the impact of triglyceride con-\ntrol on reduction of cardiovascular\nFigure 1--Prevalence and 95% CIs for achievement of selected ADA clinical practice recommendations (HDL cholesterol of 45 mg/dl for men and\n55 mg/dl for women, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] 30 g/g, A1C 7%) among U.S. adults with diabetes\nby race, duration of diabetes, income, education, and insurance status. The numbers on the figures represent P values. For race, P values are\ncomparisons between black or Mexican-American participants and whites. All other P values are derived from tests for trend. *Statistically unreliable\nestimate due to small sample size.\nResnick and Associates\ndisease was modest. No public effort to\nlower triglycerides was ever undertaken\nand might explain the relatively poor con-\ntrol of this risk factor in diabetic adults.\nNotably, our data showed that more U.S.\nblacks with diabetes met recommenda-\ntions for triglycerides, with whites and\nMexican Americans meeting it less often.\nThis observation may represent differen-\ntial representation of individual compo-\nnents of the metabolic syndrome by\nethnic group, a notion confirmed by a\nseminal report that showed less frequent\nhypertriglyeceridemia and more hyper-\ntension among blacks compared with\nwhites and Mexican Americans (31).\nTen percent of the sample had clinical\nalbuminuria. The relatively well-\npreserved renal function is likely due to\nthe short mean duration of diabetes (11.5\nyears). The striking inverse relationship\nbetween prevalence of normal renal func-\ntion and duration of diabetes supports\nthis concept. Our data show that favor-\nable renal function was present more fre-\nquently in whites compared with blacks\nand Hispanics among persons with at\nleast a high school education compared\nwith those who did not finish high school\nand among those with higher incomes.\nThese findings are consistent with previ-\nous reports suggesting that diabetes com-\nplications occur more frequently among\nminorities and that socioeconomic indi-\ncators are inversely associated with rates\nOnly 19% of diabetic adults reported\nbeing current smokers, a finding consis-\ntent with an earlier report using data from\nthat 17% of diabetic individuals were cur-\nrent smokers (35). We postulated that the\nrelatively low prevalence of current\nsmoking among diabetic persons might\nbe due in part to a larger proportion of\ndiabetic individuals having quit smoking,\npossibly due to recommendations for\nsmoking cessation among persons with\ndiabetes. Accordingly, we examined the\nproportion of former smokers among\nboth diabetic and nondiabetic adults aged\nsample. Indeed, among diabetic non-\nsmokers, 32.3% reported being former\nsmokers, compared with 24.5% former\nsmoking in nondiabetic adults. Our find-\nings are generally consistent with data\nsuggesting dramatic decreases in the pro-\nportion of diabetic individuals who\nAlthough the low prevalence of cur-\nrent smoking and the higher prevalence\nof quitting among ever-smokers is en-\ncouraging, there is much room for im-\nprovement given that nearly one-fifth of\npeople with diabetes are still current\nsmokers. Perhaps more serious was our\npost hoc observation that among U.S.\nadults aged 18\u00ad39 years, there is actually\nmore smoking among diabetic (37.0%)\nthan nondiabetic (30.4%) individuals.\nThus, programs to enhance smoking ces-\nsation among diabetic individuals are\nneeded, especially among younger adults\nwith diabetes.\nLess than 40% of diabetic adults re-\nported ever having a pneumococcal vacci-\nnation, a finding consistent with a Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention report\n(36) showing that pneumococcal coverage\namong U.S. adults with diabetes was\n37.1%. The latter study demonstrated that\ncoverage was higher for older diabetic\nadults compared with younger ones, an ob-\nservation we confirmed in age-stratified\nanalyses with our data. This pattern likely\nreflects successful public health education\naimed at the elderly, which also captures\nsome older diabetic individuals. It appears\nthatadditionaleffortsareneededtoincrease\nvaccination coverage among younger per-\nsons with diabetes.\nFinally, only 28.2% of nondisabled\nadults with diabetes reported getting rec-\nommended levels of physical activity.\nIdentifying ways to increase physical ac-\ntivity levels in diabetic adults is an obvi-\nous target for further study.\nAchievement of ADA clinical practice\nrecommendations is far from optimal in\nthe U.S. Achievement of recommenda-\ntions differs by age, race, duration of dia-\nbetes, and education. Public health\nresources should be focused on enhanc-\ning empowerment of people with diabetes\nto improve their diabetes self-manage-\nment skills and on identifying ways to im-\nprove the efficacy of patient-physician\npartnerships aimed at achieving practice\nrecommendations.\nReferences\n1.
