We also examined the fall\nof the organizations. Three groups declined because of organizational instability and/or\nresponses by law enforcement and nonstate actors, such as watch groups. PEN1--despite\nperiodic internal debates about its mission--has avoided organizational instability and\ncontinues to grow.\nPolicy Implications\nLaw-enforcement analysts must consider how critical incidents affect a group and account\nfor organizational level variables that denote the group's strength. Understanding these\norganizations is like hitting a moving target. Analysts must engage in dynamic analyses\nbecause changes in the factors outlined above may cause a group to increase or decrease in\nstrength and potential to commit violent acts. Although law-enforcement (and watch-group)\nresponses can eliminate violent groups, authorities must be conscious of possible backlash\neffects. Law enforcement should use harsh responses only as a last resort. Simultaneous\nwith police and watch-group actions, the government should reassure noncriminal move-\nment members that their rights will be protected and encourage them to join the political\nprocess. Anti-extremist strategies should challenge the groups' ideologies and stress that\nviolence will not be tolerated. Strategies that prevent the crimes these groups commit (e.g.,\nsituational crime prevention) could disrupt the groups, preempt harsh police responses, and\nthus avoid possible backlash effects. Finally, the authorities should focus on all criminal\nactivities--including terrorist strikes and nonviolent and nonideological crimes--these\norganizations commit. This strategy could expand our theoretical explanations for group\ndifferences and help law enforcement establish priorities for responding to and preventing\nfuture terrorist activities.\nKeywords\ndomestic terrorism, far-right extremism, political violence, racist organizations\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nThis study examines the evolution of four racist far-right domestic organizations: 1\nAryan Nations, National Alliance, Public Enemy Number 1 (PEN1), and Oklahoma\nConstitutional Militia (OCM). Although all the groups are racist and antigovernment,\nthey differ in their beliefs, religions, and criminal activities. We focus primarily on the rise of\nthe groups. Three organizations grew significantly, whereas OCM did not and was viewed as\na fringe group by most movement members. OCM serves as an ideal comparison group for\ndocumenting factors critical to the rise of racist extremist organizations. We also examine the\nfall of the organizations. Three groups declined, but PEN1 has not and continues to grow.\nPEN1 serves as a comparison group for documenting factors critical to the fall of far-right racist\ngroups.These differences matter because they reveal different threat levels necessary for terrorism\nor violent crime, as well as suggest different law-enforcement policies when confronting these\nIt is important to investigate such groups because, although international terrorist groups\nlike Al Qaeda threaten public safety, the far right also poses a serious threat. Freilich, Chermak,\nand Simone's (in press; see also Riley, Treverton, Wilson, and Davis, 2005) survey of state po-\nlice agencies (in which 37 states, or 74%, returned surveys) found that more responding states\nreported the presence of far-right militia (92%), neo-Nazi (89%), and racist skinheads (89%)\nin their jurisdictions than Islamic Jihadi extremists (65%). Other studies indicate that domestic\nattacks outnumber international attacks in the United States by 7 to 1 (LaFree, Dugan, Fogg,\nand Scott, 2006), and that the far right represents a danger to domestic security (Chermak,\nFreilich and Chermak's (2008; see also Chermak, Freilich, and Shemtob, in press; Gru-\nenewald et al., in press) ongoing U.S. Extremist Crime Database (ECDB) study has identified\nmore than 4,300 criminal events, which include more than 275 homicide incidents committed\nby far rightists since 1990.This study is unique because, unlike most research that focuses on a\nnarrow range of \"terrorist\" incidents, the ECDB examines any crime committed by at least one\nfar rightist.The ECDB tracks violent and nonviolent, as well as ideological and nonideological,\n1.Defining the domestic far right is not easy because no universally accepted definition exists and prior\nresearch has not sufficiently addressed this issue. Drawing from our systematic review of studies (Gru-\nenewald, Freilich, and Chermak, in press) published on far-right extremism in general and its association\nwith political crimes in particular--including important works that offer typologies, definitions, and de-\n1997; Weinberg, 1993)--we rely on the following description. The domestic far right is composed of\nindividuals or groups that subscribe to aspects of these ideals: They are fiercely nationalistic (as opposed to\nuniversal and international in orientation), antiglobal, suspicious of centralized federal authority, reverent\nof individual liberty (especially their right to own guns and be free of taxes), believe in conspiracy theories\nthat involve a grave threat to national sovereignty and/or personal liberty, believe that one's personal and/\nor national\"way of life\"is under attack and is either already lost or that the threat is imminent (sometimes\nsuch beliefs are amorphous and vague, but for some the threat is from a specific ethnic, racial, or religious\ngroup), and believe in the need to be prepared for an attack by participating in paramilitary preparations\nand training and survivalism. It is important to note that mainstream conservative movements and the\nmainstream Christian right are not included.\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\ncrimes. For example, both an antigovernment bombing committed by a militia group and a\nprofit-motivated drug sale committed by neo-Nazi skinheads would be included in the database.\nThe homicide incidents in the ECDB (ideologically motivated and nonideologically motivated)\nclaimed more than 530 fatalities (and more than 360 fatalities when excluding the Oklahoma\nCity bombing). More than 250 additional individuals (excluding the OklahomaCity bombing)\nwere injured during these events. Far rightists killed more than 47 law-enforcement and private\nsecurity personnel in the line of duty in more than 35 incidents. At least 22 far rightists were\nWe first discuss our selection of groups for analysis and comparison, the data we used to\nexamine the groups, and our comparative case study method. Next, we examine the origins\nof the four organizations as well as the critical events that influenced their evolutions. Our\ndiscussion section uses the organizational, social movement, and terrorism literatures to place\nour findings in theoretical and empirical context. We conclude with a discussion of the policy\nimplications of our findings.\nSelection of Groups, Data, and Method\nWe used Berlet and Vysotsky's (2006) typology that divides far-right organizations into three\ncategories: religious, political, and youth cultural. One group was selected to represent each\ncategory (Aryan Nations, National Alliance, and PEN1) to assess different perspectives on the\nevents of interest (Creswell, 2007; Snow and Trom, 2002). These groups are not a representa-\ntive sample, but we were interested in uncovering factors related to groups becoming long\nlasting and successful. We therefore selected groups that lasted more than 20 years and at one\npoint were either the leading racist group in the country or had one of the largest memberships\nin its category. We selected a fourth group (OCM) that was unsuccessful, small in number,\nand lasted only 1 year to serve as a \"comparison\" group. Ideally, we would have selected three\nunsuccessful groups (one in each category), but we limited ourselves due to space constraints.\nWe also examined the decline of the groups. Three of the organizations declined, but because\nPEN1 has continued to grow, it serves as the comparison group for determining factors criti-\ncal to the fall of far-right groups. We focused on only far-right racist groups. Future research\nshould consider whether our findings apply to other ideological groups, such as far leftists or\nsingle-issue extremists (e.g., anti-abortion or animal- or environmental-rights extremists). We\ndescribe the four groups we selected below.\nGroups Selected\nReligious white supremacist groups endorse a spiritual belief system and require their members\nand supporters to practice the religion (Berlet and Vysotsky, 2006). These groups use religion\nto justify their racist ideology and are led by leaders with religious titles (Barkun, 1990, 1997).\nSuch organizations construct the world into good (whites) versus evil (nonwhites and Jews) and\nbelieve that an apocalyptic war is inevitable. We selected the Aryan Nations to represent the\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nreligious category because it has existed for more than 20 years and it was the preeminent racist\nNations ran for political office, the group emphasized religion (Berlet and Vysotsky, 2006) and\nits leader, Butler, was a Christian Identity pastor.The group's religious interpretations promote\nviolence against Jews, minorities, and the government (Hoffman, 1995).\nPolitical white supremacist groups endorse neo-Nazi ideology and favor an authoritarian\ngovernment. These groups espouse \"traditional values\"; categorize individuals into \"in groups\"\nand \"out groups\" based on race, religion, or citizenship; and delegitimize the out group. Political\ngroups seek to overthrow the government (Berlet and Vysotsky, 2006) and they spread their\nmessage by distributing literature and organizing rallies (Berbrier, 2000; Blazak, 2001; Futrell,\nSimi, and Gottschalk, 2006). We chose the National Alliance to represent the political category\nbecause it was the leading neo-Nazi organization in the 1990s and it has existed for more than\nthree decades (Gardell, 2003; Michael, 2003b). The group seeks to replace the government\nwith a national socialist regime. Although William Pierce, the group's founder, emphasized\nspirituality through his creation of Cosmotheism, belief in it was not required (Gardell, 2003).\nThe National Alliance stresses Aryan superiority from an evolutionary standpoint. The group\nclaims that Jews prevent Aryans from achieving their evolutionary destiny by promoting non-\nwhite immigration and multicultural policies (Whitsel, 1995).\nYouth-cultural white supremacist groups stress subcultural affiliations that include listening\nto hate rock and black metal music, wearing a certain style of clothes, and displaying Nazi and\nwhite supremacist symbols. It also entails adopting a racist ideology and some members possess\na willingness to use violence (Berlet and Vysotsky, 2006). Youth are exposed to this subculture\nthrough friends, hate rock concerts, and Internet sites (Blazak, 2001; Futrell et al., 2006; Hamm,\n1993; Moore, 1993).The ideals and social norms are reinforced by older members. We selected\nPEN1 to represent the youth subculture category because it has existed for more than 20 years\nand is one of the largest skinhead groups currently operating in the United States (Simi, Smith,\nand Reeser, 2008). We therefore also use this group as a \"control\" group to compare with the\nthree organizations that declined.\nWe selected a fourth group that never experienced growth to serve as a \"control\" group to\ncompare with the groups that grew. We needed to find a group that--although unsuccessful--\nattracted the attention of open sources.We selected OCM because it lasted only 1 year, consisted\nof four members, and was unsuccessful in its criminal plans. However, the threat posed by the\norganization was large. The arrest and trial of the group's members attracted attention and we\nuncovered significant open-source materials on it. This group is also categorized as a religious\norganization because its members practiced Christian Identity.The organization was apocalyptic\nand believed that a Jewish cabal was conspiring to take over the United States and establish\na new world order. The group's religious objectives guided their decision to commit violence\nthrough bombing certain government, Jewish, homosexual, and abortion targets.\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nData and Method\nWe researched the four groups using 22 search engines (Lexis-Nexis; Proquest; Yahoo; Google;\nCopernic; News Library; Infotrac; Google Scholar; Amazon; Google U.S. Government; Fed-\neration of American Scientists; Google Video; Center for the Study of Intelligence; Surf Wax;\nDogpile; Mamma; Librarians' Internet Index; Scirus; All the Web; Google News; Google\nBlog; and Homeland Security Digital Library) and we reviewed terrorism databases (e.g., the\nAmerican Terrorism Study, the U.S. Extremist Crime Database Study, and the Global Terror-\nism Database), official sources (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation reports and congressional\ntestimonies), and watch-group reports (e.g., Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty\nLaw Center) to uncover detailed information on them. The information came from a variety\nof sources and increased the likelihood that there was no systematic bias operating either for or\nagainst the groups (Freilich and Pridemore, 2006, 2007).The resulting information comprised\nmedia accounts, government documents, court records, videos, blogs, books, watch-group\nreports, movement-produced materials, and scholarly accounts.\nWe used this information to complete case studies on each group, highlighting their ideol-\nogy, structure, leadership, and membership.We were interested in how the groups changed over\ntime, especially the critical incidents that affected their size and strength. We drafted a timeline\nof these factors and expanded the comparative historical research method to make comparisons\nacross the organizations (Steinmo, Thelen, and Longstreth, 1992; see also Capoccia and Kele-\nmen, 2007). We explain our method in more detail in the Discussion section. We first examine\nthe evolution of the four groups.\nGroup Case Studies\nReligious Group: The Rise and Fall of the Aryan Nations\nThe Aryan Nations was founded by Richard Girnt Butler in 1978 (Balch, 2006; Dobratz\nand Shanks-Meile, 1997). Butler was an aeronautical engineer from California and a U.S. Air\nForce veteran (Dobratz and Shanks-Meile, 1997). He became racially conscious as a result of\nhis parents (Ezekiel, 1995) and he embraced white superiority after observing the caste system\nIn the 1960s, Butler met Wesley Swift, a Christian Identity pastor (Balch, 2006). Butler com-\nmented that meeting Swift \"was the total turning point in my life.... He had the answers I\nButler purchased 20 acres near Hayden Lake, Idaho, and created his own Identity church. In\n1978, after a few failed endeavors, Butler created the Aryan Nations to serve as his church's\nThe Aryan Nations grew quickly and, by the early-to-mid-1980s, was the preeminent white\nsupremacist organization. The organization grew because its unchallenged leader set forth a\nclear ideological message, committed actions to further the ideology, took advantage of politi-\ncal openings, and kept the group unified. It was a religious group that espoused the theology\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nof Christian Identity: Aryans are the true chosen people, Jews are imposters--the offspring of\nthe devil's union with Eve--and nonwhites are subhuman (Barkun, 1997).The Aryan Nations\njustified violence against the government and nonwhites. Importantly, it offered an action plan,\nthe \"10% solution,\" which refers to their goal of establishing a white-only homeland in the five\nstates of the Northwest. Butler claimed that the 10% solution could be achieved by recruiting\nsupporters in Idaho (and then Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Wyoming) to gain power\nThe Aryan Nations undertook concrete actions to spread its message and achieve its goals.\nIn July 1980, the group established the annual AryanWorld Congresses (AWC) at its compound\nwith the goal of attracting white separatists to move to the Northwest. The congresses focused\non perceived injustices by affirmative action and multiculturalism to the white working class\n(Balch, 2006). AWC catapulted the Aryan Nations into a highly respected organization in the\nmovement and helped recruit members (Moore, 1993). The group actively recruited from\nvarious segments of the racist far right (Aho, 1990; Balch, 2006; Dobratz and Shanks-Miele,\nThe Aryan Nations took advantage of political opportunities such as the June 1983 kill-\ning of Gordon Kahl, a noted Christian Identity tax protestor. Kahl killed two law-enforcement\nagents who tried to arrest him. After months as a fugitive, he was surrounded by the authorities\nand became engaged in a shootout that killed a third officer and resulted in Kahl's own death.\nMany far rightists saw Kahl as a martyr and his death angered white racialists and radicalized\nelements of the Aryan Nations (Corcoran, 1990). The Aryan Nations capitalized on this and\nthe largest AWC (i.e., 500 attendees) took place 1 month after Kahl's death in 1983. During\nthis AWC, Robert Jay Mathews formed a group called \"The Order\" (also known as Br\u00fcders\nSchweigen--Silent Brotherhood) that consisted of members of theAryan Nations and National\nformed the group to foment a revolution and obtain funds for various racist organizations (Balch,\nencouraged to form The Order by Butler, as well as by the leading racists Louis Beam, Robert\nMiles, and Jim Ellison (Smith, personal communication, July 2008). The Order launched a\ncrime spree consisting of a counterfeiting operation at the Aryan Nations compound, murder,\nand armored car robberies. These crimes garnered millions of dollars but the group was short\nlived: Mathews was killed in 1984 in a shootout with federal authorities and his followers were\nand Gunthier, 1999; Schlatter, 2006). Law enforcement viewed The Order as an Aryan Na-\ntions spin off, which led to increased attention from government agents and resulted in Butler's\nprosecution for conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government (Balch, 2006).\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nAlthough the Aryan Nations rose to the top of the white supremacist movement in the\ntaken against it by law enforcement and watch groups. First, although the AWC played a part in\nthe group's rise, it eventually undermined the organization.The cohesion of the Aryan Nations\nunraveled when skinheads and neo-Nazis began to attend congresses in the late 1980s. The\nskinheads and neo-Nazis were young, male, and partial to alcohol, drugs, and violence. They\nbrought an unpredictability that made many residents of the compound uncomfortable and\ntheir presence also increased law-enforcement interest in the group (Balch, 2006). The initial\ncore of families that lived on Butler's compound moved away, causing disorganization within\nthe group.The emphasis on Nazism drove away nonresident Christian Identity adherents. Less\nthan half of the Identity faithful who attended the 1987 AWC also attended the 1988 congress\n(Seymour, 1991).The instability was exacerbated by the Aryan Nations being a poor organiza-\ntion that received income from membership dues and some merchandising, never collected\nmore than $100,000 in a year, and could not provide compensation for most staff positions\n(Balch, 2006). Consequently, Butler's inner circle changed frequently, which undermined the\ngroup's stability.\nAnother critical factor was the attention the Aryan Nations received from law enforcement\nbecause of the group's crimes and conflicts with the police (Balch, 2006), which caused suspicion\nand mistrust among members (Seymour, 1991). Subsequent terrorist and criminal activities by\nthose associated with the Aryan Nations (i.e., The Order II and The Aryan Republican Army)\nonly increased law enforcement's interest in the group and consequently the paranoia among\nits members. Indeed, the Aryan Nations experienced difficulty drawing people to their annual\ncongresses because Butler's compound was thought to be infiltrated by government agents as\nwell as by hidden microphones and cameras (Balch, 2006; Gardell, 2003). The Aryan Nations\nlimped through the 1990s with even fewer members and smaller annual congresses (Balch,\n2006). The final blow came in 1998 when Victoria Keenan and her son were assaulted and\nshot at by Aryan Nation guards when their car backfired while they drove on a road near the\ngroup's compound.This incident led to a lawsuit brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center\non behalf of the Keenans that resulted in a $6.3 million judgment against Butler and the Aryan\nNations that bankrupted the group. Butler was forced to sell the 20-acre compound to help\nsatisfy the judgment (Michael, 2003b). The civil suit also introduced greater dissension within\nthe organization.\nThough Butler continued to organize the AWC (on available camp grounds) and to run\nthe Aryan Nations from a small home in Idaho purchased for him by wealthy sympathizers,\nattendance continued to fall (Balch, 2006). In August 2001, Butler appointed Harold Ray\nRedfeairn as the new leader of the Aryan Nations. Redfeairn, along with August Kreis III (for-\nmer propaganda minister), attempted to lead the group away from Butler and Butler expelled\nthem. Redfeairn subsequently returned to Butler's Aryan Nations. Kreis, however, led the Aryan\nNations chapter in Lexington, South Carolina (Cable News Network, 2005). After Redfeairn\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\ndied in 2003 and Butler died in 2004, two competing Aryan Nations emerged. One is led by\nAugust Kreis (now located in Florida), and a second is led by Jonathan Williams in Alabama.\nBoth organizations remain small, and each claims to be the true continuation of the Aryan\nPolitical Group: The Rise and Fall of the National Alliance\nWilliam Luther Pierce III founded the National Alliance in 1974 in Washington, DC. Pierce\nwhen he became alarmed by increasing immigration and civil rights advances that he saw as\nJewish-created problems (Gardell, 2003; Michael, 2003a). He read books about Aryan ge-\nnetic superiority (Griffin 2001; Whitsel, 1995) and joined the John Birch Society, though he\nleft because of its unwillingness to embrace anti-Semitism (Whitsel, 1995). Pierce moved to\nWashington, DC, in 1966 and became the editor of George Rockwell's American Nazi Party's\nYouth Alliance but soon left because of personality conflicts (Whitsel, 1995). Pierce created the\nThe National Alliance did not grow until the 1990s.The group rose because Pierce--who\nwas a strong leader--set forth a coherent ideology, committed acts to extend that ideology, took\nadvantage of political opportunities, and kept the group unified. Pierce was a prolific writer and\nwas known as an ideologue within the movement (Griffin, 2001; Michael, 2003a; Whitsel,\n1995). He set forth his group's neo-Nazi political views in many venues, but his most meaningful\nstatement was a widely circulated novel. In 1978,Pierce self-published TheTurner diaries, which\nwas a novel authored under the pseudonym Andrew McDonald (Michael, 2003b). TheTurner\ndiaries involves a protagonist, Earl Turner, who launched a violent white revolution against the\nU.S. government. This revolution resulted in a race war in North America and the extermina-\ntion of nonwhites. Pierce chose fiction to present his views because he thought it would reach\na wider audience and have a bigger impact than a dry political pamphlet (Griffin, 2001).\nImportantly, the influence of the novel grew over time. Each time the perpetrators of serious\nacts of violence were linked to the novel, Pierce's ideological message and action plan received\nextensive media coverage (Smith, 1994). This increased the National Alliance's popularity and\ninfluence. The British newspaper, the Guardian, reported that approximately 500,000 copies\nof The Turner diaries had been sold and that sales were strongly boosted as a result of the 1995\nOklahoma bombing (Sutherland, 2000). Indeed,Timothy McVeigh was a big fan ofTheTurner\ndiaries and was carrying passages in his car when driving away from the scene of that bombing\n2. However, these two Aryan Nations differ. Williams's Aryan Nations is more attached to the Christian\nIdentity faith. Kreiss's organization is less religious and openly praises Islamic terrorists and Osama bin\nLaden. Williams disagrees with this viewpoint and commented that whereas,\"I sympathize with Arabs, yes,\nsympathize because their lands have been stolen by Jews...we have nothing for them [Arabs]. The simple\nfact is that they aren't white\"(Southern Poverty Law Center, 2006).\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\n(Cable News Network, 1997). Mathews used Pierce's novel as a blueprint for the actions of The\nOrder during the 1980s (Whitsel, 1995). Similarly, Pierce's novel influenced David Copeland's\nThe popularity of The Turner diaries increased awareness of Pierce's other ideological\nwritings. In the essay \"Who rules America,\" Pierce asserted that the Jews use their control of\nthe mass media to promote individualism and prevent whites from pursuing their interests\n(Michael, 2003b; Natvan, 2004). According to Pierce, the first step in the revolution was to\nreeducate white U.S. citizens (Michael, 2003a). He therefore took concrete action and created\nhis own publishing company, National Vanguard Books, in 1987. This company expanded\nfrom selling books and tabloids to selling cassettes and videos and was vital to the rise of the\nNational Alliance because it promulgated the group's message and raised its exposure within\nthe white supremacist movement. Significantly, the company generated income that allowed\nthe group to undertake additional activities (Anti-Defamation League, 2005b).3 It influenced\nPierce's decision to purchase record production companies, such as Resistance Records in the\n1990s.The National Alliance used these companies to disseminate its message to, and increase\nits membership from, skinhead and neo-Nazi youth (Anti-Defamation League, 2005a; Notable\nNames Database, 2008; Prejudice Institute, 2005). The record companies helped the group\ngenerate a yearly income of $1 million or more (Anti-Defamation League, 2000).\nThe National Alliance also took advantage of political opportunities. The decline of the\nAryan Nations--then the leading racist group--in the late 1980s provided an opening forPierce\nin the 1990s. Like other far-right groups, the National Alliance also profited from the Waco\nand Ruby Ridge incidents, fears over government heavy handedness, and concerns about gun\nrights throughout the 1990s (Wright, 2007). Finally, the last critical factor in the group's rise\nwas its strong internal cohesion. According to the indictment against Miles, Butler, and Beam\nfor seditious conspiracy, before he was killed, Mathews met with Pierce and gave him $50,000\nPierce used the land to create a communal home for members (Whitsel, 1995). Although the\nNational Alliance did not recruit many whites to move to Hillsboro, it provided a place for the\ngroup's staff to live and work. The compound enabled the National Alliance to remain stable\nand to develop its businesses while keeping costs low, which created a profitable organization.\nPierce's leadership kept the group unified. Pierce surrounded himself with intelligent people and,\nbased on his experience with Rockwell's American Nazi Party, he avoided hiring uneducated\nskinheads. Instead Pierce hired educated professionals (Griffin, 2001). He strictly enforced the\nrules of the organization and made sure there were no factions within the group. Under Pierce's\nleadership, the National Alliance was a well-funded, stable organization that grew from a few\n3. Initially, the group had little money and Pierce relied on his wife's income (Griffin, 2001).\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nPierce's death and subsequent internal strife caused the fall of the National Alliance.\nAfter Pierce's death, Erich \"The Aryan Barbarian\" Gliebe became chairman of the national\norganization (Baysinger 2006; Michael, 2003b) and chief executive officer of Resistance Re-\ncords (Prejudice Institute, 2005). Soon after, conflict developed among Gliebe and others over\nfinancial and other matters (Baysinger, 2006; Jabpage, 2003). Gliebe fired Billy Roper, deputy\nmembership coordinator (Michael, 2003b; Southern Poverty Law Center, 2003), who went\non to create a new group: White Revolution. In 2005, Kevin Alfred Strom, another leading\nmember, resigned in order to found a group called National Vanguard (Newsgroups, 2006).\nStrom was soon arrested and pled guilty to a non-movement-related child pornography crime\n(Freilich and Chermak, 2008). In June 2006, Gliebe resigned and appointed Shaun Walker to\nsucceed him (Anti-Defamation League, 2005c). But Walker's reign was short lived because he\nwas convicted of civil rights violations and was sentenced to 87 months in prison (Freilich and\nChermak, 2008). Gliebe returned to lead the National Alliance.\nActions by the Southern Poverty Law Center (a watch group) and law enforcement added\nto the National Alliance's troubles. Shortly after Pierce's death, the watch group published tapes\nof a secret meeting in which Pierce referred to other white supremacist groups as \"freaks,\"\n\"weaklings,\" and \"human morons\" (Rab, 2006). As word spread throughout the movement,\nskinheads and neo-Nazis--which compose the largest segment of Resistance Records' customer\nbase--began to boycott the National Alliance and its record production company. During this\ntime, the National Alliance became a poor organization with only a handful of staffers and less\nYouth Culture Group: The Rise of PEN1\nPEN1 grew out of the punk rock scene in Long Beach and Huntington Beach in Southern\nCalifornia during the 1980s. Youth were attracted by the music, drugs, alcohol, fashion, and\nthe beliefs and symbols of neo-Nazism (e.g., swastikas). By the mid 1980s, one group of young\nwhites evolved into a gang, \"Rudimentary PEN1,\" which was named after a punk band. Other\nthan the name, the band had no link to the gang. PEN1 was also formed to protect white\nyouths from minority gangs in neighborhoods that were changing demographically (Simi et al.,\n2008). Many of PEN1's initial members had time, money, and a desire to emulate the skinheads\nTwo influential leaders emerged: Brody Davis, who wanted PEN1 to be a white supremacist\norganization that rejected drug use and nonideological crimes; and Donald Reed \"Popeye\"\nMazza, who although he was an ideological racist, favored committing profit-motivated crimes\nsuch as drug trafficking. Mazza won control of PEN1 and charted its course (Anti-Defamation\nPEN1 has grown into one of the largest skinhead groups in the country (Anti-Defamation\nattributed to its clear goals, able leadership, ongoing criminal activities, internal cohesion, and\npolitical opportunism. First, PEN1's consistent white supremacist belief system and focus on\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nnonideological profit-motivated crimes distinguishes it from other white gangs. (Other gangs\nare either nonracist and are profit motivated or they only focus on extending white supremacist\nideology.) PEN1 has not wavered from its path despite periodic debates during the last 20 years\nabout whether it should focus only on profit-seeking crimes or solely advance white suprema-\ncist ideology (Simi et al., 2008). In short, PEN1 has remained a racist gang and, although\nit commits ideological hate crimes (Freilich and Chermak, 2008), it is primarily engaged in\nhas remained a centralized organization and, as discussed below, this is one reason the Aryan\nBrotherhood prison gang chose to work with it.\nPEN1 also took advantage of political opportunities. During PEN1's early years, the Aryan\nBrotherhood--the leading white neo-Nazi prison gang--was identified as a prison gang by\nprison authorities and was isolated in special housing units throughout the system.This isolation\nforced the Aryan Brotherhood to cooperate with the Nazi Low Riders, which is another white\nracist gang. Because the Nazi Low Riders were not yet labeled a prison gang, they were placed\nin the general prison population and were able to conduct criminal business both inside and\noutside the prison system. However, during the 1990s, the Nazi Low Riders also were identified\nas a prison gang and were thus isolated in special housing units. During this time, an increasing\nnumber of PEN1 members entered the prison system after being convicted of various crimes\n(e.g., drug trafficking, identity theft, and murder). Because PEN1 was not labeled a prison\ngang by prison authorities, they filled the void left by the Nazi Low Riders. The Aryan Broth-\nerhood also selected PEN1 to assist with its criminal operations because PEN1 \"traditionally\nmaintained a small and relatively cohesive leadership\" (Simi et al., 2008: 762).The relationship\nbetween PEN1 and the Aryan Brotherhood strengthened when PEN1's leader, Donald Mazza,\nand second-in-command, Dominic Rizzo, were made Aryan Brotherhood \"associates\" (Anti-\nThese developments enhanced PEN1's clout within the prison system.The group increased\nits criminal operations, which meant more PEN1 members entering the prison system (Anti-\nAs PEN1's criminal enterprises expanded beyond drug trafficking to auto theft, burglary, prop-\nerty crime, and identity theft, so did its membership base and geographic range, which in turn\nprovided more potential recruits. Recruiting within the prison system became easier and the\ngroup has expanded its criminal enterprises by collaborating with other groups, including those\nwith Latino members. Because of PEN1's reputation and growing size, many white inmates\njoined PEN1 to acquire protection from other ethnic and criminal gangs within the prison\nthe estimate had grown to 400 and some law-enforcement and prison officials believed that\nthe true number might be double that. In 2004, the California Department of Justice reported\nthat PEN1 is \"one of the most powerful and fastest-growing gangs inside and outside prison\"\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nControl Group: The Fall of the OCM (Universal Church of God)\nWillie Ray Lampley formed the OCM in 1994. Unlike the groups discussed above--which at\ntimes had hundreds or thousands of members--the OCM consisted of only four people:Willie\nLampley, his wife Cecilia, Larry Wayne Crow, and John Dare (J.D.) Baird (Ferguson, 1995;\nwho created a church in 1975 called the Universal Church of God and referred to himself as\nhe published a magazine and wrote letters to politicians, such as the governors of California\nand Idaho, warning them that their state was noncompliant with God's law and threatening\nviolence if they did not change course (Anti-Defamation League, 1995).\nA significant amount of open-source information is available about the arrest and convic-\ntion of the members of the OCM. The organization's four members were racist and strongly\nopposed to the federal government.The two key figures--Lampley (the group's primary actor)\nand Crow--met and became partners because of their shared religious viewpoints. They at-\ntended militia gatherings together, shared racist literature, discussed ideology, and publicized\ntheir views through newsletters and the Internet.The OCM lasted for approximately 1 year and\nhad a birth and a death, but no significant rise.The group was negatively affected by Lampley's\nlack of leadership ability and criminal sophistication, a convoluted ideological message, and\nlaw-enforcement tactics taken in response to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\nLampley had poor organizational leadership skills: He was not a shrewd manager and he\nwas unable to attract a wide following or engage leaders of other groups. Most extremists who\ncame in contact with Lampley shunned him. John Parsons, who was the leader of a national\nmilitia umbrella organization called the Tri-States Militia (as well as an FBI informant) said,\n\"I thought Lampley was a complete nut case, and everyone else looked at him the same way.\"\nOther militia members stated that he \"spooked even the militia\" (Foster, 1996: 2). Lampley\nalso lacked criminal sophistication. In the months after the Oklahoma City bombing, Lampley\nvisited various militia and white supremacist organizations to discuss his bombing plans and\nto seek support, but instead he was rebuffed (Swindell, 1996). Lampley ignored the fact that\nlaw-enforcement officials were interested in militias (especially those that used the Internet to\ndisseminate hateful ideology and recruit new members) after the Oklahoma City bombing\n(see Sageman, 2008, on the importance of the Internet to the recruitment and radicalization\nprocesses). He attempted to harness the Internet's power by posting messages designed to spread\nhis racist rhetoric and recruit individuals to his plot.\nRelatedly, the ideological messages set forth by Lampley were unclear and did not attract\nsupporters. For example, in one Internet message illustrative of his worldview, he emphasized\nthat war was necessary to purge the government out of \"his America.\"4 He claimed that he was\none of God's prophets sent to warn others of the impending war and to take the necessary steps\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nto ensure victory. In convoluted reference to Christian Identity teachings, Lampley argued that\nAmerica is the \"land of Ephraim\"--essentially, white America--and that Yahweh, the Elohim\nGod of Israel, do not want to go to war but existing sources of evil ensure that war is inevitable.\nLampley's lack of discretion and chosen means of disseminating his unclear message made him\nvisible to law enforcement.\nConcurrent with Lampley's unwise actions, law enforcement increased the amount of atten-\ntion and resources devoted to right-wing extremist organizations, especially militias (Chermak,\n2002). As a result of this increased attention, Lampley, his wife Cecilia, Baird, and Crow were\narrested in November 1995 for conspiracy to manufacture and possess a destructive device.\nRichard Schrum, an undercover informant who volunteered to work for the FBI after the\nOklahoma City bombing, had infiltrated Lampley's militia and secretly recorded conversations\n(Fink, 1995; Swindell, 1996). Lampley and the others planned on using ammonium nitrate\nfertilizer bombs to blow up offices of the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law\nCenter, abortion clinics, civil rights offices, welfare offices, and gay bars. Law-enforcement of-\nficers seized numerous guns and three semiautomatic weapons when making the arrests. It is\npossible that prior to the Oklahoma City bombing, Lampley and the OCM might have gone\nunnoticed but, in the months after McVeigh's actions, law enforcement was paying closer at-\ntention and Lampley's behavior made the group visible to investigators.\nComparison and Discussion\nOrganizational theorists argue that it is difficult to identify the causes of group growth after it\nhas occurred (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978;Whetten, 1987).To address this issue, we extended the\ncomparative historical research method (Steinmo et al., 1992; see also Capoccia and Kelemen,\n2007). We isolated factors that seem to account for each group's rise, growth, and decline. We\nensured that factors found to be responsible for a group's rise occurred before the group rose\nor before the rise accelerated. Similarly, factors responsible for the decline occurred before the\ndecline began or before the decline increased. We listed the factors for each group and then\ncompared the four organizations. We first focus on the rise of the groups.\nGrowth of Groups\nThe Aryan Nations, National Alliance, and PEN1 were unique because they achieved consider-\nable growth. Most terrorist and extremist groups do not grow, cannot sustain growth, and exist\nfor less than 1 year (Jones and Libicki, 2008; LaFree and Dugan, in press; Rapoport, 1992). We\nrecently examined all white supremacist organizations that the Southern Poverty Law Center's\nannual hate report listed as existing in the United States since 1990. Less than 5% of the 6,000\nlisted groups existed for at least 3 years (Freilich and Chermak, 2008). It is important to uncover\nthe factors that fuel organizational growth.\nOur analysis documented four factors that were critical to the rise of the Aryan Nations,\nNational Alliance, and PEN1 but were not found in our examination of the OCM (the com-\nparison group).The organization (1) was led by a strong leader with a clear ideological agenda,\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\n(2) pursued activities to expand its goals and had the necessary finances, (3) strategically took\nadvantage of political opportunities, and (4) was cohesive. Although we discuss these critical\nfactors separately, they interact. We outline them sequentially, however, as a heuristic device.\nLeadership and ideology. A strong leader is determined, committed, provides an ideology\nthat justifies certain beliefs or actions, and provides direction on how to achieve the group's\ngoals (Richardson, 2006; Stern, 2003). All three successful organizations were led by strong\nleaders who set forth clear ideologies or goals, whereas the unsuccessful OCM leader's ideological\nwritings were \"convoluted.\" Table 1 illustrates this.\nT a b le 1\nLeadership and ideology\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorresponsiblefor\ngroup'sgrowthorcontinued\ngrowthandwhenitoc-\ncurred\nButlersetforthclear\nideologicalmessage:\nChristianIdentity\ntheologyaswellasthe\nPiercesetforthaclear\nideologicalmessage:\nPierce'sneo-Nazi\nmessagereceived\nincreasedattention\n(becauseofhighprofile\ncrimesitinspired)\nPEN1hasasmallcohesive\nleadershipandclear\ngoals:\nEndorseswhite\nsupremacistbeliefsand\nfocusesonprofitcrimes\n(whilealsoengagingin\nhatecrimes)throughout\nmillennium\nLampleywasperceived\nasa\"nut\"\nIdeologywas\n\"convoluted,\"and\nLampley'swriting(inthe\nconsistedofrantsand\nthreats\nWhengroupbegantorise\norcontinuedtorise\nRoseintheearlyandmid\nRosethroughoutthe\nNeverrose\nNotes.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.OCM=OklahomaConstitutionalMilitia.\nThe Aryan Nations was Butler's brainchild and Pierce was the sole founder of the National\nAlliance. PEN1 did not find its focus until Mazza took control and currently its leadership\nis small and cohesive. Butler formed the Aryan Nations in 1978 and promulgated Christian\nIdentity claims that whites are locked in an apocalyptical cosmic battle with the devil (Jews)\nand subhuman nonwhites. More practically, Butler offered the 10% solution that called for the\nestablishment of a white-only homeland in the Pacific Northwest.The Aryan Nations began to\ngrow and attendance at its AWC increased in the early and mid 1980s (Goodrick-Clark, 2002;\nSouthern Poverty Law Center, 2004). Pierce was a strong leader who consistently provided\nexplanations, justifications, and direction. He advocated revolution, a white-only homeland,\nand he sought to institute a national socialist government. Pierce's message received increased\nattention throughout the 1980s owing to crimes it inspired. The National Alliance began to\nPEN1 embraced white supremacy and parroted the famous statement, \"We must secure\nthe existence of our people and a future for white children,\" which was coined by David Lane\n(member ofThe Order). Although PEN1 did not primarily pursue ideological goals, its members\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\ncommitted violent hate crimes (Freilich and Chermak, 2008). Importantly, the group's mission\nhas consistently focused on profit-motivated crimes since its inception.The group's growth ac-\ncelerated after 2000. Conversely, although Lampley embraced Christian Identity, his ideological\nutterances were usually incomprehensible. Most of Lampley's writings were rants and threats\nagainst politicians. The OCM never grew but instead remained a four-person group.\nT a b le 2\nConcrete actions and financial stability\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorresponsible\nforgroup'sgrowthorcon-\ntinuedgrowthandwhenit\noccurred\nAlthoughthegroupwas\nneverwealthy,ithad\nresourcestohostAWCto\nspreadgroup'sideology\nandrecruitmembers\nCommunityoffamilies\nlivedoncompound\nplan\nOrder--associatedwith\ngroup--committed\nIdeologypublicizedin\nmultiplevenues(Turner\ndiaries,pamphlets,talks,\nradioshows)--received\nincreasingattentiondur-\ncrimesitinspired\nGroup'sbookandrecord\ncompaniesgenerated\nmorethan$1millionin\nincome.Thesecompanies\nalsoallowedgrouptoby-\npass\"Jewishdominated\nmedia\"\nFoundedtoprotectwhite\nyouthinchangingareas\nHatecrimesand\nespeciallyprofitcrimes\nAlliedwithABinprison\ntoprotectwhiteinmates\nandpursuecrimesinside\nthenewmillennium)\nLampleywasshunned\nbyothersandhisgroup's\nterroristplotswerefoiled\nOtherthanLampley's\nfailedrecruitmentefforts\ninpersonandviathe\nInternet,thegroupdid\nnotundertakeconcrete\nactions\nWhengroupbegantorise\norcontinuedtorise\nRoseintheearlyandmid\nRosethroughoutthe\nNeverrose\nNotes.AWC=AryanWorldCongress.AB=AryanBrotherhood.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.OCM=OklahomaConstitutional\nMilitia.\nThese findings are consistent with the social movement and terrorism literatures. Resource\nmobilization theory places a heavy premium on leadership skills in determining which movements\nor groups succeed (Zald and McCarthy, 1987). Stern (2003) concluded that terrorist leaders are\nfundamental to group success because they decide and justify the message and tactics, provide a\nsense of identity and purpose, and empower marginal followers (see also Hamm, 1993, 2002;\nmovement scholarship criticizes earlier approaches that refused to take the ideology of far-right\ngroups seriously and dismissed their beliefs as irrational or unreasoned. Our finding that a clear\nideological message is important for an organization's growth indicates that dismissing such\nHixson, 1992). We expand on this point in the policy implications section.\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nConcrete actions and financial stability. All three successful groups conducted concrete\nactivities to expand their goals and ideologies and had the finances necessary to undertake these\nsteps. This approach is illustrated in Table 2.\nSome white supremacists--like Robert Mathews and members of The Order--believed\nmost movement members were long on rhetoric but short on action (Gardell, 2003; Schlatter,\n2006). An active group reflects seriousness and commitment.The Aryan Nations organized its\nfirst annual congress in 1980 to unite the fractious white supremacist movement. Some Aryan\nNations members moved to the compound to live (thereby extending the group's 10% plan). A\ncohesive community was living at the compound in the mid 1980s.The Aryan Nations seemed\nto be committed to the cause, as individuals associated with it perpetrated serious crimes to\nspread their ideology (e.g., The Order in the early 1980s). The Aryan Nations took steps to\nattract young members (Moore, 1993) and recruited members in prison. Again, the group rose\nThe National Alliance demonstrated activity largely through organizational achievements.\nPierce published his message in books, tabloids, newsletters; created a publishing company;\npurchased record companies; hosted a weekly radio program; and spoke at white supremacist\ngatherings both in the United States and abroad.The National Alliance organized protests and\nrallies. Although Pierce had little respect for young skinheads, he recruited youth by purchas-\ning Resistance Records and other companies. Pierce increased these activities in the 1980s and\nthroughout the 1990s. Again, the group's ideology and activities received increased attention\nas a result of the publicized crimes it inspired. These activities were fundamental to its growth\nand made it the premier white supremacist organization of the 1990s.\nSince its creation in the late 1980s, PEN1 has pursued illicit profits and committed murder\nand other crimes to advance its objectives. Initially, it protected white youth in demographically\nchanging areas and focused on profit crimes throughout the 1990s. As more of its members were\narrested, greater numbers of PEN1 members entered California prisons in the 1990s. Thus.\nPEN1 has been active behind bars, especially since 2000. Prisons offer an ideal environment for\nrecruitment because protection can be offered in exchange for support. In contrast, Lampley\nand the OCM were unable to undertake any successful activities: Both their recruitment efforts\nand terrorist plots failed because of poor leadership, messaging, and recruiting skills.\nThe three successful groups' activities and growths were made possible because they had\nsufficient funds to conduct these activities. The more money the organization possesses, the\nmore capable it is. Before Pierce's death, the National Alliance was earning more than $1 million\nper year. Although the Aryan Nations was not as financially successful, it earned enough in the\n1980s to organize annual congresses.PEN1 may be more profitable than the other organizations,\nbut the money has typically been used for criminal schemes and personal income.\nThese findings are congruent with prior research. Ruggiero (2005) stated that members of the\nRed Brigades engaged in activities to distinguish themselves and to thereby achieve greater status\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nNations and PEN1's recruitment efforts inside prisons mirror the activities of other extremist\ngroups.The Black Liberation Army recruited inside prisons in the 1960s (Smith, 1994) and Al\nQaeda might currently be recruiting members inside U.S. prisons (Hamm, 2007b). Finally, our\nfinding that financially strong organizations were more active (which then aided their growth)\nis consistent with earlier studies. Stern (2003) found that finances are a necessary ingredient\nfor a terrorist group's success: \"Where there is money for Islamist causes but not communist\nones, Islamist terrorist organizations will rise and communist ones will fail\" (2003: 142; see\nT a b le 3\nPolitical opportunities\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorresponsiblefor\ngroup'sgrowthorcontinued\ngrowthandwhenit\noccurred\nCapitalizedonanger\naboutgovernment\nheavyhandedness,\nsuchasthedeathof\nCapitalizedonthe\ndeclineoftheAryan\nandconcernsabout\ngovernmentabuses\nFormedtoprotect\nwhitesinchanging\nareas.Enteredprisonin\ngrowingnumbersinlate\nCapitalizedontheAB\nandNLRbeinglabeled\nprisongangsand\nisolated.ThisledtoAB\nandPEN1cooperation\nUnabletotake\nadvantageofpossible\npoliticalopenings\nLampleywasshunned\nbyothersinthemove-\nmentbecausehewas\nviewedascrazy\nWhengroupbegantorise\norcontinuedtorise\nRoseinearlyandmid\nNeverrose\nNotes.AB=AryanBrotherhood.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.NLR=NaziLowRiders.OCM=OklahomaConstitutionalMilitia.\nPolitical openings and opportunities. A third factor common to the successful groups was\nthat they took advantage of political opportunities. Table 3 documents savvy decisions the\norganizations made to take advantage of these openings.\nButler exploited the \"martyrdom\" of Gordon Kahl and Robert Mathews to benefit the\ngrowth of the Aryan Nations. Pierce--like many far-right groups--exploited Ruby Ridge and\nWaco in the 1990s (Wright, 2007) and took advantage of the decline of the Aryan Nations. The\nTurner diaries and his other writings brought high-profile publicity to the National Alliance.\nPEN1 also took advantage of political opportunities. It formed in the late 1980s to protect\nwhite youth in neighborhoods that were changing demographically. PEN1 has recently grown\nbecause of its alliance with the Aryan Brotherhood inside prisons. This collaboration occurred\nbecause PEN1 took advantage of the opening provided by prison authorities who classified\nthe Brotherhood and the Nazi Low Riders as prison gangs and isolated them from the general\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\npopulation. However, because of Lampley's poor leadership qualities, the OCM could not take\nadvantage of any political openings. Rather, Lampley made efforts to recruit others and tap into\nthe national patriot network, but he was shunned because he was viewed as \"nuts.\" Lampley\ncould not take advantage of the Internet to recruit either, because he posted convoluted writings\nthat were unlikely to appeal to potential followers.\nThese findings are consistent with prior research. Whetten's (1987) review of literature on\norganizations' life cycles found that growth is critical for survival and is typically a by-product\nof other strategies. Some strategies are initiated by the organization, but often the group takes\nadvantage of external events or chance happenings. McAdam's (1982) political process model in\nthe social movement literature similarly found that changed power relations (such as that which\noccurred with PEN1 inside of California's prisons) create opportunities that groups can take\nadvantage of. McAdam also noted that opportunities are related to \"cognitive liberation,\" which\nis the creation of beliefs that \"the current situation is unjust\" (p. 19). Both the Aryan Nations\nand the National Alliance took advantage of alleged government heavy handedness to expand\ntheir groups. Furthermore, the recent decline of the National Alliance created opportunities\nfor the growth of similar groups, such as the National Socialist Movement.\nT a b le 4\nInternal cohesion\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorresponsible\nforgroup'sgrowthorcon-\ntinuedgrowthandwhen\nitoccurred\nButlerwasunrivaled\nleader,andthegroup\nhadnofactionsor\ninternaldisputes\nAunitedcommu-\nnitylivedatthegroup\ncompound(earlyto\nPiercewasunrivaled\nleaderwhoavoided\ninternalstrifeby\nshunning\"unruly\"\ntypesandhiring\nprofessionaltypesfor\nseniorpositions\nSeniormanagement\nlivedinthegroup's\nDespiteperi-\nodicdebatesabout\nthegroup'smission\n(i.e.,racistideology\nv.routinecrimes),\nMazzaandthegroup's\ncentralizedleadership\nhassofarsuccessfully\nbridgedthesedivides\nLampleymadeunwise\ndecisions\nGroupwassmall--\nfourpeople--butwas\nundonebytrusting\napoliceinformer--\ncohesionundermined\nWhengroupbegantorise\norcontinuedtorise\nRoseinearlyandmid\nNeverrose\nNotes.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.OCM=OklahomaConstitutionalMilitia.\nInternal cohesion. The final factor common to the rise of the successful groups is that they\ngrew when they were cohesive and factions were kept to a minimum. This was again partially\nattributed to strong leadership exercised by Butler, Pierce, and Mazza, as observed in Table 4.\nButler initially surrounded himself with a stable inner core that followed his rules. Although\nthis support ultimately changed, for many years, Butler was an unchallenged leader and the\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\ngroup was unified. Pierce created a stable group and he surrounded himself with intelligent\nand capable people. He purposefully did not recruit unruly skinheads or other hotheads to key\npositions. Pierce enforced the rules and the National Alliance had no factions while he ruled.\nAlthough Mazza is imprisoned, he has managed to maintain a stable gang that is respected\namong white supremacist gangs--both within and outside of the California prison system.\nAlthough the group has periodic internal debates about its mission, its leadership remains small\nand cohesive (Simi et al., 2008). Furthermore, the group has been consistent in its activities\nand goals throughout the past two decades, which is precisely why the Aryan Brotherhood\nreached out to them.\nPrevious research found that cohesion is fundamental to group survival. Jamieson (1990)\nconcluded that the Italian Red Brigades terrorist group survived as long as it did because it\navoided infiltration and internal discord because most members followed the organization's\n(2008: 40) recent RAND study that investigated 268 terrorist groups worldwide to determine\nwhy they ended found that \"a terrorist group often has to become large to win. The inability\nto grow, conversely, is a harbinger of defeat. Splintering (or absorption into other groups) is a\nbane of small groups.\" Indeed, both the Aryan Nations and the National Alliance were created\nout of factional splits: Before Butler formed the Aryan Nations, he took over Swift's church;\nPierce created the National Alliance after a conflict with Willis Carto (Hamm, 2007a; Hewitt,\nFall (Decline)\nAlthough our main focus was on the factors responsible for group growth, we also investigated\ntheir decline. In this analysis, we treated PEN1 as our comparison group because it is the only\norganization examined that is still growing. The demise of a group seems to be a culmination\nof two broad factors that likely interact and encompass many circumstances: organizational in-\nstability and responses by government and nongovernment agencies. We discuss both points.\nOrganizational instability. All the groups except PEN1 experienced internal instability\nbefore their decline began.Table 5 illustrates this point. Instability is related to loss of leadership,\nloss of cohesive inner core, and loss of funds. Initially, Butler was surrounded by a close-knit\ngroup that shared common values. However, when he organized the AWC, this introduced a\nmore militant element to the compound that did not share the same values as the inner core.\nMany members of the stable initial group then left. The skinhead presence also brought ad-\nditional law-enforcement attention to the Aryan Nations, which increased dissension within\nthe group. Eventually, Butler (who was older and in poor health) could not enforce the rules.\nFurthermore, the Aryan Nations could not afford to pay its staff and key personnel came and\nwent, which destabilized the group even more. Butler was recognized as a failed leader and\ninfighting began. Members left, created splinter organizations, or tried to take control of the\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nAryan Nations. Currently, the Aryan Nations is split between two groups that claim to be the\ntrue descendent of Butler's organization and both have few members.\nThe National Alliance also suffered from organizational instability, but it happened in\na different sequence. Pierce maintained a cohesive inner core until his death. Gliebe (Pierce's\nreplacement) was not as capable as Pierce, and he could not earn the group's respect. Within a\nshort period, infighting occurred and members left, created splinter groups, or tried to remove\nGliebe. Business suffered and resulted in more staff leaving the organization.Today, the National\nAlliance is a shadow of its former self with just a few hundred members.\nT a b le 5\nOrganizational instability\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorsrespon-\nsibleforgroup'sdecline\norcontinueddeclineand\nyeareachoccurred\nNeo-Nazisbeganshowing\nupatAWC--ledtoChris-\ntianIdentityadherents\nAWCattractedunrulyskin-\nheadsandcorefamilies\nHeavyturnoverofkey\npersonnel\nPiercedeath--ledto\nsplinteringofthegroup\nandpowerstruggles\nSmallcohesiveleader-\nship\nDespiteperiodicdebates\noverthelasttwode-\ncades,ithasconsistently\nembracedprofitcrimes\nandwhitesupremacy\nTrustedaninformant--\nledtothegroup'sdemise\nWhengroupbeganto\ndeclineorcontinuedto\ndecline\nshellofagroupbylate\nButler'sdeath\nGroupsplitin\nGrouphasnotdeclined\nandisstillrising\nMembersarrestedin\nNotes.AWC=AryanWorldCongress.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.OCM=OklahomaConstitutionalMilitia.\nThe OCM never had a strong leader or funds. It was able to maintain some stability be-\ncause it consisted of only four people who shared the same values. Lampley did not need much\nmoney to achieve his goals, but he was not a sophisticated leader. He embarked on his plan\nsoon after the Oklahoma City bombing, at which time militias were being heavily scrutinized\nby law enforcement. Lampley was indiscreet in discussing his plans. The group's cohesion was\neffectively undermined by their trusting of a law-enforcement informant, which led to a quick\nend to the OCM. Conversely, PEN1 has remained unified with a small cohesive leadership.\nIndeed, as mentioned previously, this is one reason it is attractive to the Aryan Brotherhood.\nFurthermore, PEN1 has consistently embraced both white supremacy and profit crimes for\nmore than 20 years and thus far has managed to avoid crippling internal disputes.\nThe results from previous organizational and terrorism studies are consistent with our find-\nings. Scholars explaining the decline of organizations have concluded: \"Declining organizations\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nare characterized by a wide range of dysfunctional organizational processes. These outcomes of\ndecline erode organizational effectiveness and undermine member satisfaction and commitment\"\n(Whetten, 1987: 345). Similarly, losing the support of one's base is associated with a terrorist\nResponses to group (by government and nongovernment agencies). A group's descent also\nmay be encouraged by outside forces, which include the government and nonstate actors. All\nthe groups engaged in (or attempted to engage in) serious acts of violence and each of them\nprovoked a response. Table 6 makes this point. The Aryan Nations benefited from the violent\ncrimes committed by groups like The Order. These crimes raised the Aryan Nations' status\nand helped recruit new members. But it drew the attention of law enforcement, which arrested\nmost members of the criminal groups that supported the Aryan Nations. Law enforcement\nalso focused on the Aryan Nations.This attention affected attendance at the AWC and created\nparanoia within the group as to who was a true member and who was an undercover agent--\nwhich contributed to the instability of the group. In addition, the $6.3 million civil lawsuit\nwon by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of the Keenans bankrupted Butler and the\nAryan Nations. The Aryan Nations was already struggling financially and organizationally, yet\nmajor splits occurred after the lawsuit. Although the National Alliance's undoing is primar-\nily attributable to itself, recall that the Southern Poverty Law Center published tapes from a\nsecret meeting in which Pierce insulted other white supremacists. The tapes angered many in\nthe movement and resulted in a boycott of Resistance Records, which reduced the sales and\nprofitability of the organization. Law enforcement also kept the National Alliance destabilized.\nIn 2006 after Gliebe appointed Shaun Walker as the group's new chairman, law enforcement\narrested Walker for previous civil rights violations and he was convicted. Kevin Strom, who was\nanother key leader, was arrested for nonmovement crimes. The constant change of leadership\nadded to the instability of the organization. Similarly, successful law-enforcement tactics led to\nthe complete end of the OCM: All four members of the organization were identified by law\nenforcement.\nHowever, PEN1's frequent interactions with the law have not hampered their growth;\ninstead, it seems that prison actually has helped the group grow. As already discussed, PEN1\nshrewdly took advantage of the opportunities inside prison--protecting white inmates, col-\nlaborating with the Brotherhood to commit profit crimes, and expanding.\nPrevious studies have found that responses by both state and nonstate actors contribute\nto the decline of terrorist or extremist groups. Jones and Libicki's (2008) study that examined\n268 terrorist groups worldwide found that 40% of organizations ended because local law-\nenforcement and intelligence agencies arrested or eliminated key members. Smith (1994: 91;\nsee also Hamm, 1993) concluded that skinhead groups declined in the United States in the\n1980s because of a \"double barreled blast of aggressive federal criminal prosecutions and private\ncivil rights attorneys,\" and Hamm (2007a) reached similar conclusions about the demise of\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nMcAdam, 1999; Ruggiero, 2005). Such responses, although contributing to declines in these\ngroups, also may have had unintended consequences and created backlash effects.These concerns\nare addressed in the next section.\nT a b le 6\nResponses to groups\nAryanNations NationalAlliance PEN1 OCM\nCriticalfactorsresponsible\nforgroup'sdeclineorcon-\ntinueddeclineandyear\neachoccurred\nLaw-enforcement\ninfiltrationincreased\nsuspicionandparanoia\namonggroup'smembers\nArrestedmembersofThe\nOrderandother\"below\nground\"groupsinspired\nbyAryanNations\nSouthernPovertyLaw\nCentercivilsuitcrippled\nSouthernPovertyLaw\nCenterpublicizedtapesof\nPiercemockingothersin\nthemovement--ledto\nboycottofNAcompanies\nArrestsofkeyfigures\n(e.g.,Walker,Strom)\nDespiteimprisonment\nofitsleadership,ithas\nthrivedbothinsideand\noutsideprison\nPoliticalopportunities\ninsideprisonseemto\ntranscendenforcement\nefforts\nSuccessfullaw-en-\nforcementtacticsledto\narrestofgroupwithhelp\nfromapoliceinformant\nWhengroupbeganto\ndeclineorcontinuedto\ndecline\nshellofagroupbylate\nButler'sdeath\nandisstillrising\nMembersarrestedin\nNotes.PEN1=PublicEnemyNumber1.OCM=OklahomaConstitutionalMilitia.\nPolicy Implications and Conclusion\nOur findings have many policy implications.The rise and fall of white supremacist organizations\nare linked to critical events and organizational variables that enhance or disrupt groups. These\nfindings suggest the importance of law-enforcement intelligence and analysis. Understanding\nthese organizations is like hitting a moving target and analysts must engage in dynamic analyses\n(Freilich et al., in press; Sageman, 2008; Smith, 1994). Changes in the factors outlined above\nmay cause a group to increase or decrease in strength and potential to commit violent acts. For\nexample, the militia movement was affected dramatically by the Oklahoma City bombing,\nwhich forced many individuals to leave the movement, others to join, and some to go under-\nground or to seek other extremist organizations for fear of government infiltration (Chermak,\n2002). Paying attention to such changes will allow law enforcement to (1) assess a group's threat\nlevel more accurately as it changes; (2) differentiate between truly dangerous groups and less\ndangerous groups, as well as immediate versus potential future threats; and (3) develop policies\nthat best address these threats (Chermak et al., in press; Duffy and Brantley, 1998; McGarrell,\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nIt seems obvious that successful law-enforcement operations can eliminate a group or\nindividuals that have engaged in crimes (e.g., Kahl, who murdered three police agents, and\nMathews, who was the leader of The Order, were killed during separate firefights with law\nenforcement; remaining members ofThe Order and the OCM were tracked down and arrested\nby the authorities). This thought seems to bolster deterrence and incapacitation views that call\nfor harsh responses to extremist groups. Many watch groups call for firm government actions\nagainst extremist organizations (Chermak, 2002; Freilich, 2003). However, our findings also\ndemonstrate that some responses may have unintended consequences. Perceived harsh govern-\nment and police actions may lead to consciousness raising (Dobratz and Shanks-Meile, 1997;\nMcAdam, 1982) that outrages the wider movement and causes a backlash. Other extremist\ngroups and the movement at large may grow and individuals and groups may become even more\nradicalized and turn to violence. For example, the Aryan Nations capitalized on the killings of\nKahl and Matthews by law enforcement and the organization's popularity increased. In addi-\ntion, Matthews partially created The Order because of anger over Kahl's death. The National\nAlliance, the militia movement, and other far-right groups grew in response to government\nexcesses at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Importantly, recent research also suggests that harsh govern-\nment responses to terrorism often have no deterrent effect and sometimes lead to a backlash\nAuthorities must strike a balance between a carefully calibrated campaign that eliminates\ndangerous groups and which stresses that violence will not be tolerated on the one hand, and\nresponses that avoid outraging and possibly increasing crime from the larger movement on the\nother hand. Several options must be considered. First, law enforcement should use deadly or\nharsh responses only as a last resort. Again, severe government actions at Waco and Ruby Ridge\nhad a backlash effect. Conversely, the Anti-Defamation League (2003; see also Wright, 2007)\nexplained that nuanced and patient responses by law enforcement that allow militia extremists\nto save face can yield peaceful resolutions, such as the Republic of Texas standoff in 1997.\nSecond, the government should consider supplementing harsh law-enforcement actions\nagainst violent groups with \"outreach\" programs to nonviolent wings of the movement. These\nstrategies should encourage members of the movement to forsake illegal behaviors in favor of\nparticipation in the political system or other legal activities. Jones and Libicki's (2008) study\nfound that 43% of 268 terrorist groups worldwide ended because of a transition to the politi-\ncal process. Significantly, FBI agents charged with monitoring domestic extremists have made\nsimilar arguments. Agents Duffy and Brantley (1998) created a typology of four categories of\nfar-right militia groups that range from noncriminal entities to organizations, that conduct\nserious crimes (e.g., homicide, bombings). These authors urged local police to open a dialogue\nwith leaders from the two nonviolent categories \"so that the two sides can voice their concerns\nand discuss relevant issues in a non-confrontational way\" (p. 2).\nFreilich \u00b7 Chermak \u00b7 Caspi\nThese strategies should be used today, especially when law enforcement is involved in a\ncrackdown. What makes this initiative difficult is that the ideology of far-right racist groups is\nexplicitly antigovernment and calls for violence against nonwhites, Jews, and the government.\nHowever, outreach policies could extend law-enforcement efforts to build bridges in immigrant\ncommunities that are suspicious of the government (Freilich and Chermak, in press). Newman\nand Clarke (2008) recently identified steps that police agencies can take to reduce tension with\nmigrant communities that have come under suspicion because a few terrorists--such as the\n9/11 hijackers--used them to fit in. These steps include assigning community police agents\nto work solely with migrant communities, taking advantage of ethnic media outlets to com-\nmunicate with the larger community, and clearly publicizing the police agency's mission and\npolicies. Similar strategies could be taken with \"moderate\" members of racist groups and other\nfar rightists. In addition to following Duffy and Brantley's (1998) suggestion of initiating dia-\nlogue with nonviolent groups, agencies can assign officers to appear on far-right media outlets\n(many racist groups make use of short-wave radio shows and the Internet). Such campaigns\ncould explain the government response and note that it is directed only at those who commit\ncrimes. Authorities could reassure noncriminal members of the movement that their rights\nwill be protected and encourage them to focus on lawful activities while stressing that violence\nwill not be tolerated.\nAlthough we recognize that some hard-core terrorists have no interest in pursuing change\nthrough legitimate processes, it is also true that most extremist individuals and groups do not\nengage in violence or terrorism themselves. Furthermore, some \"terrorists\" are reluctant partici-\npants and are not strongly committed to an extremist ideology. McGarrell et al. (2007) discussed\nhow most of the individuals linked to a series of bombings and detained terrorists (nearly 70%)\nwere not ideologically committed. We also recognize that the goals of racist, far-right groups\nare beyond the pale to most. But our study shows that the ideology of these groups plays a role\nin their growth. Effective antiextremist strategies should challenge the ideology of racist groups\nand refute their points (Berlet and Lyons, 2000; Freilich, 2003). Part of the reason that civil\nlawsuits against these organizations brought by watch groups have been successful is that they\nfocus on violent actions by committed movement members. Successful judgments handicap\nthe organizations financially and send a message that violent tactics will not be tolerated. Con-\nsistent with our earlier discussion, it is important that watch groups avoid taking actions that\nharshly target the nonviolent wing of the movement. Like crime-control authorities, watch\ngroups need to balance necessary responses to illegal acts against severe actions that outrage\nthe larger movement and create backlash effects. It is important that future research on deter-\nrent and backlash effects also examines the role of nonstate actors, such as watch groups, the\nmedia, and others (Pridemore and Freilich, 2007). Finally, backlash effects are usually found\nwhen a government takes action after a crime or terrorist act has been committed. Strategies\nthat prevent the crimes these groups commit to raise funds and advance their objectives (e.g.,\nby using situational crime prevention; Clarke and Newman, 2006; Freilich and Newman, in\nLife Trajectories of Domestic Extremist Groups\nCriminology & Public Policy\nharsh police responses to these crimes and thus avoid possible backlash effects.\nOur analysis of PEN1 raises challenges for both terrorism scholarship and government\nresponses to such groups. PEN1 adheres to an extremist ideology, but its primary concern is its\ncontinued existence as a gang that focuses on profit crimes. Law enforcement should be wary\nof PEN1 transitioning from nonideological routine crimes to a full-fledged ideological criminal\norganization (Simi et al., 2008). It is important for authorities to remember that many terrorist\ngroups commit a wide range of criminal activities to fund and prepare for significant terrorist\nactivities (Hamm, 2007a; Smith, Damphousse, and Roberts, 2006). Finally, terrorism scholar-\nship has struggled with defining terrorism (Freilich et al., in press; Schmid and Jongman, 1988).\nHowever, it may be valuable to focus on all criminal and terrorist activities of such groups and\nto compare the characteristics of organizations that commit terrorists acts with groups that do\nnot, as well as with groups that commit only nonideological crimes or ideological crimes that are\nnot terrorism (e.g., tax refusal; Freilich and Chermak, 2008).This could expand our theoretical\nexplanations for group differences and help law enforcement establish priorities for responding\nto and preventing future terrorist activities.\nReferences\nAho, James A. 1990.
