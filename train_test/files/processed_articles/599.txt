Second,\nfamily time adequacy was expected to play an amplifying role in the first path of the two mediations.\nUsing a sample of 563 employees and adopting hierarchical linear modelling, the three-wave study first\nrevealed that the emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between schedule control and WIF\nwhile WIF also mediates the schedule control-emotional exhaustion relationship, which demonstrated a\nreciprocal mediation. Furthermore, the relationship between schedule control and emotional exhaustion,\nas well as the indirect effects of schedule control on WIF via emotional exhaustion, were stronger for\nemployees with higher family time adequacy.

Moreover,\nit is also proposed that schedule control has an indirect\neffect on their WIF via emotional exhaustion. In addition,\nwhen employees have a high level of family time adequacy,\nwhich refers to the time available for family (Van Horn,\nBellis, & Snyder, 2001), it is expected that a high level of\nschedule control would be more genuine for employees,\nand the negative effect of schedule control on emotional\nexhaustion and WIF would both be strengthened. The\nproposed model can be seen in Figure 1.\nThe investigation of the relationship between schedule\ncontrol and WIF will contribute to the demands-resources\nmodel(Bakker&Demerouti,2007),theliteratureofwork-\nfamily conflict and emotional exhaustion, and the prac-\ntice of flexible work schedule policy in three ways. First,\nthrough the hypothesised reciprocal mediation model, the\npresent study will not only explain the possible reciprocal\nrelationship between WIF and emotional exhaustion but\nalso give a clearer picture of the reciprocal mediation re-\nlationship between schedule control, WIF, and emotional\nexhaustion. Second, the incorporation of family time ade-\nquacy will not only enrich the above picture by uncovering\na necessary condition outside of the workplace but also ex-\npand the scope of the demands-resources model (Bakker\n& Demerouti, 2007) out of the work domain. Third, find-\nings of the current research will give organisations a clear\nmessage about the importance of work time control for\nemployees, and a possible hint that employees' control of\nfamily time also matters at work.\nTheory Background and Hypothesis\n   \nExhaustion\nCompared to actual work schedule, schedule control de-\npicts employees' perceived control over their work sched-\nules (Fenwick & Tausig, 2001). Drawing upon a resource\nperspective(Grzywacz&Marks,2000;tenBrummelhuis&\nBakker, 2012) and job demands-resources model (Bakker\n& Demerouti, 2007), I argue that there is a reciprocal\nmediation between schedule control, WIF, and emotional\nexhaustion. Specifically, schedule control not only has a\nnegative impact on employees' WIF through their emo-\ntional exhaustion, but also negatively influences employ-\nees' emotional exhaustion via their WIF.\nThe core idea of the job demands-resources model\nis that individuals experience psychological and physical\nstrain if job demands are high or resources are insufficient\n(Bakker&Demerouti,2007).Workschedulecanbeseenas\na job demand that is imposed by the organisation (Beutell,\n2010).Onthecontrary,schedulecontrol,whichfocuseson\nwhen and where to do the job (Fenwick & Tausig, 2001),\ncan be seen as providing autonomy and a job resource\nthat allows employees to allocate their time and energy\nmore freely and efficiently. Thus, it is reasonable to argue\nthat if employees have a high level of schedule control,\nthey may experience fewer job demands and more job\nresources, and, thus, have a lower level of job strain. As\na result, employees' emotional exhaustion, as a type of\npsychological strain (Maslach & Jackson, 1981), would be\nreduced. Therefore, it is predicted that:\nHypothesis 1. Schedule control is negatively associated\nwith emotional exhaustion.\nMoreover, based on the work-home resources model\n(ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), on the one hand, a\nlack of resources in one domain may lead to depletion\nof resources in another domain (i.e., loss spiral). On the\nother hand, sufficient resources in one domain could pro-\nduce resources foranotherdomain(i.e., gainspiral). Thus,\nabundant resources in the workplace would not only re-\nduce depletion of family resources but also spill over to\nfamily domain and help individuals to deal better with\ntheir family life (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000; ten Brum-\nmelhuis & Bakker, 2012). Thus, a high level of schedule\ncontrol on work would help to reduce work interference\nwith family. Therefore, it is predicted that:\nHypothesis 2. Schedule control is negatively associated\nwith work interference with family.\nThe resource perspective posits that individuals have a\nfinite amount of resources to use in all aspects of work and\nlife, and ineffective allocation of resources will lead to psy-\nchological strain (Grzywacz & Marks, 2000). Based on the\ndemands-resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007),\nemotionalexhaustioncanbeseenasaconsequenceofhigh\ndemands and few resources. Since work interference with\nfamily is an indicator of personal resources (e.g., time)\ninsufficiency (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), it is reasonable\nto expect that under a high level of work interference with\nfamily, individuals' emotional exhaustion would also be\nhigh. Moreover, emotional exhaustion could also be the\nantecedent of resource depletion. This is because, in or-\nder to cope with emotional exhaustion, employees have\nto consume their limited resources (Schaufeli & Bakker,\n2004). This can lead to a vicious cycle and leave insuf-\nficient resources available for family, which can trigger\nWIF. Combining the above reasoning, it is likely that WIF\nand emotional exhaustion have a reciprocal relationship.\nThus, it is predicted that:\nHypothesis 3. WIF and emotional exhaustion have a pos-\nitive and reciprocal relationship over time.\nTo sum up, schedule control can act as a form of job\nresources that helps employees to better manage their per-\nsonal resources for family and leads to a low level of\nWIF. The low level of WIF should cause less strain and\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Simulta-\nneously, schedule control can also help individuals to gain\ncontrol and have less job strain, which should lead to a\nlower level of emotional exhaustion. With a lower level\nof emotional exhaustion, individuals would use fewer re-\nsources to deal with their exhaustion, which would benefit\nthe family and reduce WIF. Thus, it is predicted that:\nHypothesis 4. WIF mediates the relationship between\nschedule control and emotional exhaustion, while emo-\ntional exhaustion mediates the relationship between\nschedule control and work interference with family.\nThe Moderating Role of Family Time Adequacy\nBased on the resources allocation theory (Grzywacz &\nMarks, 2000) and conservation of resource theory (Hob-\na resource perspective on the work-family relationship,\nnamely the work-home resources model, and explained\nhow personal resources flow between work and family do-\nmains. Combining the work-home resources model and\njob demands-resources model, it is reasonable to argue\nthat family demands or resources, such as family time ad-\nequacy, may also play a role in the relationship between\nschedule control, emotional exhaustion, and WIF.\nFamily time adequacy refers to individuals' percep-\ntion of time resources available for family (Van Horn\net al., 2001). Acting as a form of family resources, family\ntime adequacy and schedule control represent two parts\nof personal resources in the work and family domains re-\nspectively. Based on the work-home resources model (ten\nBrummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), sufficient resources in one\ndomain may not only reduce depletion of resources in\nanother domain but also produce resources for another\ndomain. Thus, employees with high family time adequacy\nnot only have enough family time resources but may pro-\nvide additional resources for work on the basis of the\nexisting resources from schedule control.\nGiven that a high level of schedule control would re-\nduce the depletion of family resources and decrease WIF,\na high level of family time adequacy would strengthen\nthe negative effect of schedule control on WIF from both\nwork and family aspects. On the one hand, a high level\nof family time adequacy, as an abundant family resource,\nwould help to enrich the whole family resources and make\nit less easy to be depleted. On the other hand, this fam-\nily resource could also spill over to the work domain and\nenrich the whole work resources, which would reduce the\ndepletion of resources in anther domain, such as family,\nand finally reduce work interference with family. In other\nwords, I expect that a higher level of family time adequacy\nwould amplify the negative association between schedule\ncontrol and emotional exhaustion.\nIn contrast, employees who have a low level of family\ntime adequacy do not have enough family time resources.\nHence, based on the work-home resources model (ten\nBrummelhuis & Bakker, 2012), they are more likely to\ndeplete the limited resource, especially time resources at\nwork, and cause the conflict between work and family.\nThus, employees with a low level of family time adequacy\nwould be less likely to have a low level of WIF when they\nhaveahigherlevelofschedulecontrolthantheircolleagues\nwith high family time adequacy. As proposed above, that\nWIF mediates the relationship between schedule control\nand emotional exhaustion, it is anticipated that family\ntime adequacy, as a family resource, will moderate the\nindirect relationship between schedule control and WIF\nthrough emotional exhaustion. Therefore, it is predicted\nthat:\nHypothesis 5a. Family time adequacy moderates the first\nstage of the indirect relationship between schedule control\nand emotional exhaustion via work interference with fam-\nily. Specifically, the negative relationship between schedule\ncontrolandworkinterferencewithfamilyisstrongerwhen\nfamily time adequacy is high.\nMoreover, given that job resources are expected to be\nassociated with a low level of job strain, such as emo-\ntional exhaustion, it is reasonable to argue that employees\nwith high family time adequacy, which act as an abundant\nfamily resource, would be less likely to deplete their job\nresources. Thus, they would be more likely to have a low\nlevel of emotional exhaustion when they have a higher\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

In other words, it was expected that\na higher level of family time adequacy would amplify the\nnegative association between schedule control and emo-\ntional exhaustion.\nIn contrast, employees with low family time adequacy\ndo not have enough time resources for the family. There-\nfore, they are more likely to deplete resources at work and\nthus perceive that fewer job resources are available than\nemployees with high family time adequacy. Given the as-\nsociation between resources and strain, employees with\nlow family time adequacy would be more likely to have a\nhigh level of emotional exhaustion regardless of the level\nof schedule control. As proposed above, that emotional\nexhaustion mediates the relationship between schedule\ncontrol and WIF, it is anticipated that family time ad-\nequacy, as a family resource, will moderate the indirect\nrelationship between schedule control and WIF through\nemotional exhaustion. Therefore, it is predicted that:\nHypothesis 5b. Family time adequacy moderates the first\nstage of the indirect relationship between schedule con-\ntrol and work interference with family via emotional ex-\nhaustion. Specifically, the negative relationship between\nschedule control and emotional exhaustion is stronger\nwhen family time adequacy is high.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nFor this study, the data were collected as part of a large,\npublicly available dataset called the Work, Family, and\nHealth Study (WFHS; Bray et al., 2013). The participants\nwere employed in the 14 centres of an extended health\ncare company. Employees who worked 22 or more hours\nper week in direct patient care on the day or evening shifts\nwere eligible to participate in the present study. At baseline\n(Time 1), 799 employees reported their schedule control\nand family time adequacy. After 6 months, at Time 2, em-\nployees' emotional exhaustion and WIF were measured.\nFinally, 12 months after Time 1, employees' emotional\nexhaustion and WIF were measured at Time 3.

Eight items regarding control over work hours\nwere used. Participants were asked to think about what\nthey feel or believe is realistic for them and answered\nquestions about their control over work hours using a 5-\npoint Likert scale (from 1= strongly disagree to 5 = strongly\nagree). A sample item is `How much choice do you have\nover when you take vacations or days off?' The Cronbach's\nalpha for the scale was .66.\nFamily time adequacy. Family time adequacy was mea-\nsured with a seven-item scale adopted from the Family\nResource Scale -- Revised (FRS; Van Horn et al., 2001).\nThe original FRS consists of 30 items that assesses a family\nmember's perception of resources available for the fam-\nily. Participants were asked to rate their agreement on a\n5-point Likert scale (from 1 = not at all adequate to 6 =\nalmost always adequate). A sample item is `To what extent\nis there enough time to care for the needs of other fam-\nily members (spouse, parents, in-laws)?' The Cronbach's\nalpha for the scale was .67.\nEmotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was mea-\nsured by the three-item emotional exhaustion dimension\nof the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslach & Jack-\nson, 1986). Participants were asked to rate how their work\nmakes them feel on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1= never\nto 7 = every day). A sample item is `You feel emotionally\ndrained from your work. How often do you feel this way?'\nThe Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .89.\nWork interference with family. Work interference with\nfamily was measured by Netemeyer and Boles' (1996) five-\nitem, work-family conflict scale. Participants were asked\nto think about the past 6 months and rate their agreement\non a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to\n5 = strongly agree). A sample item is `The demands of\nyour work interfere with your family or personal time'.\nThe Cronbach's alpha for time-based, strain-based and\nbehaviour-based WIF was .90.\nControl variables. Participants' gender and age were con-\ntrolled in the current study, as they are found to affect\nwork-family conflict (Michel, Kotrba, Mitchelson, Clark,\n& Baltes, 2011). Participants' sleep time was also con-\ntrolled, as enough and high-quality sleep were considered\nto be an individual's important resource to deal with work\ntasks (Diestel, Rivkin, & Schmidt, 2015). Sleep time was\nmeasured at Time 1 by participants' self-reports on how\nmany hours they were sleeping per day on average.\nResults\nPreliminary Analysis\nAs all participants in the current study were working in\n14 teams, it is possible that the nested data were non-\nindependent. Thus, intra-class coefficients (ICCs; Shrout\n& Fleiss, 1979) of the study variables were computed. The\nICC1s, which indicate the variance explained by group\nmembership, were .05 for schedule control, .00 for family\ntime adequacy, .03 for Time 2 emotional exhaustion, .03\nfor Time 2 WIF, .01 for Time 3 emotional exhaustion,\nand .01 for Time 3 WIF. The ICC2s, which indicate the\nreliability of group means, were .68 for Time 1 schedule\ncontrol, .13 for Time 1 family time adequacy, .54 for\nTime 3 emotional exhaustion, and .24 for WIF Time 3.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Since the ICC1s of\nstudy variables in the current research ranged from .00\nto .05 when treating the team as group variable, there was\nconsiderable groupness regarding the current research\nmodel. To eliminate the group effect, hierarchical linear\nmodelling (HLM) using Mplus 7 (Muth\u00b4\nen & Muth\u00b4\nen,\nof all study variables were controlled in the further\nanalysis.\nTests of Discriminant Validity\nTo examine whether key constructs and covariates in the\ncurrent study (i.e., schedule control, family time adequacy\nat Time 1, emotional exhaustion and WIF at Time 2, and\nemotional exhaustion and WIF at Time 3) were distin-\nguishable from each other, a confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA) using Mplus 7 (Muth\u00b4\nen & Muth\u00b4\nwas conducted. CFA results indicated that the six-factor\nmeasurement model (i.e., all variables are independent\np < .01, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .92, Tucker-Lewis\nIndex (TLI) = .91, Root Mean Square Error of Approxima-\ntion (RMSEA) = .05.

Family time adequacy was also\nnegatively associated with both emotional exhaustion and\nWIF at Time 2 (for emotional exhaustion, r = -.16, p <\n.01). Moreover, schedule control was positively associated\nwith family time adequacy (r = .22, p < .01). Furthermore,\nemotional exhaustion at Time 2 was positively associated\nwith WIF at Time 3 (r = .36, p < .01), while WIF at Time\n2 was also positively associated with emotional exhaus-\ntion at Time 3 (r = .37, p < .01). With respect to control\nvariables, gender was negatively correlated with emotional\nexhaustion at both Time 2 (r = -.13, p < .01) and Time\npositive related with schedule control at Time 1 (r = .08, p\n< .05) and negatively correlated with emotional exhaus-\ntion at Time 2 (r = -.09, p < .05). Thus, gender, age, and\nsleep time were controlled in the further analysis.\nHypothesis Tests\nTo examine the role of family time adequacy in the re-\nlationship between schedule control and WIF via emo-\ntional exhaustion and in the relationship between sched-\nule control and emotional exhaustion via WIF, the `first\nstage moderation model' approach (Edwards & Lambert,\n2007), in which the moderating effect takes place on the\nfirst stage of the indirect effect of an independent vari-\nable on a dependent variable through a mediator, was\nused in the current study. In the present research model,\nemotional exhaustion plays a mediating role in the rela-\ntionship between schedule control and WIF, while WIF\nalso plays a mediating role in the relationship between\nschedule control and emotional exhaustion. Family time\nadequacy moderated the path from both schedule con-\ntrol to emotional exhaustion and the path from schedule\ncontrol to WIF. Thus, there were two conditional indirect\neffects of schedule control on both WIF and emotional\nexhaustion at different levels of family time adequacy.

These\nresults suggest that employees with a high level of con-\ntrol over their work schedule, as a job resource, would\nsimultaneously have a low level of work-family conflict\nthrough the decrease of job strains such as emotional ex-\nhaustion, and have a low level of emotional exhaustion via\nthe decrease of WIF.\nFurthermore, the findings of the current research also\nprovide support for the moderating role of family time ad-\nequacy in the relationship between schedule control, WIF\nand emotional exhaustion. First, family time adequacy\nhad a significant moderating effect on the relationship be-\ntween schedule control and WIF. Then a moderated medi-\nation analysis revealed that the indirect effect of schedule\ncontrol on emotional exhaustion via WIF was stronger\nfor employees with a high level of family time adequacy.\nSecond, family time adequacy had a significant moder-\nating effect on the relationship between schedule control\nand emotional exhaustion. Then a moderated mediation\nanalysis revealed that the indirect effect of schedule con-\ntrol on WIF via emotional exhaustion was stronger for\nemployees with a high level of family time adequacy.\nTheoretical and Practical Implications\nThe current research contributes to the existing litera-\nture on both the work-family relationship and the job\ndemands-resources model in two ways. First, the present\nstudy found a reciprocal relationship between WIF and\nemotional exhaustion over time; and, based on this, re-\nvealed a reciprocal mediation between schedule control,\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The reciprocal\npath between emotional exhaustion and WIF uncovered\na vicious circle of resource depletion between work and\nfamily, and the incorporation of schedule control could\nturn the vicious circle to a positive cycle.\nSecond, the current research extends the scope of\ndemands-resources model domain (Bakker & Demerouti,\n2007), since the traditional demands-resources model is\nonly within organisations. The current study incorporated\nfamily time adequacy as a boundary condition and found\nthat the impact of schedule control on emotional exhaus-\ntion depends on the level of family time adequacy. This\nresults suggest that the traditional demands-resources\nmodel needs to be more comprehensively constructed.\nSpecifically, looking at the antecedents of organisational\noutcomes, the demands-resources model should simul-\ntaneously and naturally contain both demands and re-\nsources from work and family.\nThe current study also provides empirical support for\nthe work-home resources model. While ten Brummelhuis\nand Bakker (2012) released eight propositions regarding\nthe resources-based, work-family balance, they called for\na validity test of the proposed model. As found in the\ncurrent study, family time adequacy, a form of family re-\nsources, would strengthen the negative relationship be-\ntween schedule control (i.e., a form of job resources) and\nemotional exhaustion. This result supports a unified view\nof personal resources across domains of work and family.\nSufficient resources in one domain would trigger a gain\nspiral and produce more resources for another domain,\nwhile insufficient resources in one domain would bring a\nloss spiral and deplete resources of another domain.\nThe hypothesis of the moderating effect of family time\nadequacyintherelationshipbetweenschedulecontroland\nWIF was not supported. A possible explanation could be\nthat compared to spilling over to the work domain and\nstrengthening the effect of schedule control on emotional\nexhaustion, the effect of family time adequacy on WIF\nmay be parallel with the effect of schedule control. As can\nbe seen in Table 2, while the effect of family time adequacy\non emotional exhaustion was significant (estimate = -.37,\np < .01), the effect of schedule control was not significant\n(estimate = -.19, ns). Given the significant interaction\n(estimate = -.37, p < .01), these results indicated that the\neffect of schedule control was highly influenced by fam-\nily time adequacy. However, although the effect of family\ntime adequacy on WIF was significant (estimate = -.36,\np < .01), the effect of schedule control on WIF was signif-\nicant too (estimate = -.13, p < .01), indicating a parallel\neffect.\nThe findings of the current study offer several prac-\ntical implications. First, considering the positive effect of\nwork schedule control on reducing emotional exhaustion\nand work-family conflict, organisations should promote\na flexible work schedule policy. Second, since recipro-\ncal mediation exists between schedule control, emotional\nexhaustion and WIF, if organisations have difficulties\nmaking work schedules more flexible, in order to reduce\nemployees' work-family conflict, they could try other pos-\nsible ways, such as relaxation classes, to help employees\nto relieve their emotional exhaustion. Similarly, in or-\nder to reduce employees' emotional exhaustion, organisa-\ntions could try to help employees to reduce their conflicts\nwith time, strain, and behaviour between work and family\n(Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). Third, organisations should\nnot only pay attention to employees' work schedules, but\nalso to their perceived adequacy of family time. Since in-\nsufficient family time would weaken the effect of schedule\ncontrol on emotional exhaustion, target treatment such as\ntime management training is needed for employees with\nlow family time adequacy.\nLimitations And Future Directions\nThere were also some limitations in the current research.\nFirst, drawing upon a resources perspective (Grzywacz &\ngued that emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship\nbetween schedule control and WIF, and WIF mediates the\nrelationship between schedule control and emotional ex-\nhaustion. Although time is one of the most important re-\nsources that an individual can possess (Nielsen, Bachrach,\nSundstrom, & Halfhill, 2012), there are also other forms\nof resources, such as feedback and social support (Bakker\nsearch could address this point and examine other forms\nof job resources and its relationship with emotional ex-\nhaustion and work-family conflict. A similar suggestion\nis that future studies could examine other forms of re-\nsources at home such as family support (Adams, King, &\nKing, 1996) and its interactive effect with job resources on\nworkplace or, more generally, life outcomes.\nSecond, since work-family conflict was theoretically\ngrouped into three subdimensions, namely time-based,\nstrain-based, and behavioural-based work-family con-\nflicts (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985), future research could\ninvestigate the impact of both schedule control and fam-\nily time adequacy on all three dimensions of work-family\nconflict to see if there would be a difference. For example,\nthe impact of schedule control on time-based and strain-\nbased work-family conflict may be stronger than that of\nbehaviour-based work-family conflict because schedule\ncontrol is closer to the time and strain sources of con-\nflict. Finally, the sample used in the current study was\nfrom a large health care centre and the majority of partici-\npants were female. Future studies could use more gender-\nbalanced samples in other industries to test the generalis-\nability of the current research model.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The findings first revealed that\nemotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between\nschedule control and WIF, while WIF also mediates the\nschedule control-emotional exhaustion relationship. In\naddition, the mediation path of schedule control to work-\nfamily conflict via emotional exhaustion was stronger for\nemployees with a high level of family time adequacy. With\nthese findings on the resource-based process of the rela-\ntionship between schedule control and work-family con-\nflict, and suggested future directions, the current study\ncontributes to a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe mechanism of the impact of personal resources on\nindividual and organisational outcomes.\nReferences\nAdams, G.A., King, L.A., & King, D.W.
