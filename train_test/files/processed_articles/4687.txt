With regard to the importance of\nreplicating research findings, we conducted a replication study and re-investigated the CL effect on risk-taking. Furthermore,\nwe extended previous research by comparing experimental groups with a control group as well as by exploring effects of\nsex. The CL effect on risk-taking was as expected. However, risk-taking by the control group did not differ from that by\nthe experimental groups. Both women and men took less risk after receiving concrete priming rather than abstract priming.\nHowever, men were generally more risk-seeking compared with women. Both effects (men being more risk-seeking than\nwomen and the CL effect) were successfully replicated.\n",

This could be done by exact or conceptual\nreplications, which comprise some variance (for instance,\nwithin the used measures or sample in comparison with the\noriginal study; Stroebe & Strack, 2014). Recently, Lermer,\nStreicher, Sachs, Raue, and Frey (2014) have shown that\npeople's thinking style influences their risk-taking behavior.\nIn particular, participant's mind-set/construal level (CL)\ninfluences their risk propensity; those that think abstractly\nshowed an increased risk propensity compared with those\nwith a concrete mind-set.\nIn their studies, Lermer and colleagues (2014) referred to\nconstrual level theory (CLT; Trope & Liberman, 2010),\nwhich states that the way people think about events or objects\nis subject to the perceived psychological distance (\"the sub-\njective experience that something is close or far away from\nmore distant (e.g., in time) a target is perceived, the more\nabstract the target representation becomes. Moreover,\nabstractly represented targets are perceived as more distant\nthan concretely represented targets. One explanation why\nabstract thinking leads to more risk affinity compared with\nconcrete thinking stems from a further CLT prediction:\n Keywords\nconstrual level, thinking style, risk-taking, Balloon Analogue Risk Task, men and women, replication study\n2 SAGE Open\nHypothesis 2: Risk-taking behavior of participants without\nmind-set manipulation differs significantly from the behav-\nior of participants who receive mind-set manipulation.\nSecond, there was a surplus of women to men in the stud-\nies by Lermer et al. (2014). This raises the question whether\nCL effect could be sex-independent and, as such, potentially\nintroduce a bias to the results. Previous research has shown\nthat men take more risks than women (for an overview, see\nByrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999). However, in the absence of\nother published studies that show differences in CL effects\nbetween the sexes, we propose that the differences in risk-\ntaking between the sexes is constant across different mind-\nsets. To explore this notion, the following hypotheses were\nformulated:\nHypothesis 3: Male participants show more risk-taking\nbehavior than female participants irrespective of the\nmind-set.\nHypothesis 4: There is no relationship between CL and\nsex in risk-taking behavior.\nTo investigate our hypotheses, we experimentally tested\nthe impact of CL on risk-taking behavior via CL priming and\na risk-taking task used by Lermer et al. (2014).\nThe present study is a replication of the CL effect and\nextends previous research by addressing two short comings:\nadding a control group and a gender-balanced sample.\nStudy\nMethod\nage\nage\nwere recruited on university campus to take part in the study\nin exchange for course credit. Participants were assigned to a\n3 (CL condition: concrete vs. control vs. abstract; randomly\nassigned) \u00d7 2 (sex: female vs. male; equally assigned) design.\nThe experimental groups received either abstract or concrete\nmind-set/CL priming whereas the control group received no\npriming. A why-versus-how task (identically to the priming\nfrom Freitas, Gollwitzer, & Trope, 2004; Wakslak & Trope,\n2009; for an overview, see Burgoon, Henderson, & Markman,\n2013) was used as CL manipulation. In the abstract condi-\ntion, participants answered six why-questions (e.g., \"Why do\npeople take part in competitions?\") by considering the under-\nlying reasons for, and purposes of, an action. In the concrete\ncondition, participants answered six how-questions (e.g.,\n\"How to prepare for an exam?\") by considering the way an\naction is carried out.\nParticipants' risk-taking behavior was measured using the\nBalloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; adapted from Lejuez\net al., 2002). Previous studies have shown that the BART is a\nreliable measurement of risk-taking propensity (Lejuez,\nAklin, Zvolensky, & Pedulla, 2003). In this task, participants\nreceive 30 computer-simulated balloons, which they can\ninflate by clicking a \"pump\" button (with each click the bal-\nloon inflates and the participants receive a virtual 5\u00a2). The\nmoney accumulates until either the participant decides to fin-\nish the round and save the accumulated money by pressing\nthe collect button, or until the balloon bursts (due to too\nmany pumps), which leads to a total loss of the accumulated\nmoney for that balloon. The aim of the BART is to collect as\nmuch money as possible.\nParticipants were not informed as to how many pumps\nwould burst a balloon. The number of pumps required to\nburst the balloons was random but constant across\nparticipants.\nResults\nTwo risk-taking indicators of the BART-data were calculated\nfollowing the recommendation of Lejuez et al. (2002): mean\nnumber of pumps per balloon that did not burst (mean clicks)\nand total number of burst balloons (bursts). In addition, and\nin line with Lermer et al. (2014), a risk index of the z-stan-\ndardized means of both measures was calculated (cf. Hiemer\n& Abele, 2012) as these indicators were sufficiently highly\nResults of 3 (CL condition: concrete vs. control vs.\nabstract) \u00d7 2 (sex: female vs. male)ANOVAs revealed no sig-\nthat concrete thinkers have a lower, and abstract thinkers a\nhigher, risk propensity (Table 1). Post hoc tests (Fisher's least\nsignificant difference; LSD) revealed that abstract and con-\ncrete thinkers differed significantly in their risk-taking behav-\nior across all indicators (mean clicks, p = .038; bursts, p =\n.019; risk index, p = .015). Thus, the findings of Lermer et al.\n(2014) were replicated and Hypothesis 1 confirmed.\nThere were no significant differences in risk-taking\nbetween the control group and the experimental groups,\nalthough, descriptively, the differences in risky behavior\nwere as expected.1 Therefore, based on the results to this\nstudy, we cannot conclude that the experimental group of\nabstract/concrete thinkers took more or less risks than the\ncontrol group of nonprimed participants. Thus, Hypothesis 2\ncould not be confirmed.\nIn the ANOVA tests, the influence of the participant's sex\non risk-taking behavior showed significant main effects in\nthat men took more risk in the BART than women on mean\nsmaller in the experimental groups than in the control group\nacross the three different CL conditions. In the control condi-\ntion, males took significantly more risks than females on\nLermer et al. 3\nresults were marginally significant on bursts, F(1, 64) = 3.56,\nparticipants in the concrete condition indicated that male par-\nticipants took more risks than female participants, the main\neffect of sex was not significant for mean clicks, F(1, 59) =\nA similar relationship was found in the abstract condition;\nmeans indicated that men took more risks than women, but\nANOVAs' results showed only a marginally significant main\nThus, Hypothesis 3, that is, male participants show more risk-\ntaking behavior than female participants irrespective of the\nmind-set, could not be confirmed for an abstract mind-set.\nMeans indicated that male participants showed higher risk pro-\npensity across all conditions. However, the difference between\nsexes was strongest in the control condition, as effect sizes\nshowed, but not significant in both experimental conditions.\nThere were no interaction effects of sex and CL across all\nindicators, ps > .859. Thus, abstract mind-set manipulation\nseemed to increase, and concrete mind-set manipulation\nseemed to decrease risk-taking behavior in both women and\nmen. Furthermore, results indicate that both abstract and\nconcrete thinking reduces the sex difference in risk-taking\nbehavior in comparison with the control condition. These\nresults confirm Hypothesis 4, in that there is no relationship\nbetween CL and sex on risk-taking behavior (see Table 1).\nDiscussion\nThe present research is a successful replication study of the\nCL effect. Although replications are of enormous importance,\nthey are not very popular with researchers. One reason might\nbe that replications often are perceived as not very interesting\nand less informative than new findings, especially when the\ninvestigated effect is not a prominent one. This leads to the\nquestion of what is high in replication value and who decides\non that? Given the under-representation of replication studies,\nliterature proves that despite the so-called \"replication crisis\"\nin psychology, these studies have difficulties to find their way\nto relevant scientific journals.\nResults of the present study showed that adapting con-\ncrete thinking leads to lower risk-taking than abstract think-\ning (cf. Lermer et al., 2014). Furthermore, the present\nresearch extends previous findings: First, it cannot be con-\ncluded that abstract or concrete thinking either increases or\ndecreases risk-taking behavior per se. The degree of risk-\ntaking behavior was descriptively as expected for the experi-\nmental groups' risk propensity (lower risk-taking by abstract\nthinkers and higher risk-taking by concrete thinkers), but the\ndifferences between the control condition and the experi-\nmental conditions were not significant. In other words, the\nCL effect was only found in the comparison of abstract and\nconcrete thinkers, and not to the comparison of participants\nwho did not receive a mind-set manipulation (i.e., control),\nwith those who received an abstract or concrete mind-set\nmanipulation.\nSecond, results support the empirically well-replicated\nfindings that men take more risks than women. However, the\npresent research also shows that this difference between the\nsexes is reduced when participants adopt an abstract or con-\ncrete mind-set. Differences in risk-taking between the sexes\nwere not significant when participants received an abstract or\nconcrete mind-set manipulation (however, the descriptive dif-\nference remained in the expected direction). Effect sizes\nrevealed that differences in the behavior of the sexes were\nstrongest for participants with no mind-set manipulation.

Moreover, the general influence of CL\npriming on risk behavior seems to be similar in men and\nwomen. However, results indicate that typical differences in\nrisk behavior between the sexes are reduced when partici-\npants have adopted an abstract or concrete mind-set.\n"
