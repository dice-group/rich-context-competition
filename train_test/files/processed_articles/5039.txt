Research shows that\nby ninth grade, 30% to 50% of students have repeated at least\none grade during their school career (Goldberg, 2004;\nrequired to show their competence on a test to prove they\nhave met the standards for their grade. In some instances,\nwhen students are not passing the exit test for their grade,\nretention in that grade is often the next step (Brown, 2007).\nHistorically, studies have shown that grade retention has a\nnegative effect on students, as opposed to promotion to the\nnext grade (Jimerson & Kaufman, 2003). Retention can\nincrease the student's chance of dropping out of high school\nand decrease his or her self-esteem (Jimerson, Anderson, &\nWhipple, 2002). Therefore, teachers are left in a quandary. If\nstudents are not meeting the standards to pass to the next\ngrade, what options are in place to meet the needs of these\nstudents? Many teachers are still choosing to retain students,\nbecause it is their only alternative (Witmer, Hoffman, &\nStudents with disabilities are required to participate in the\nstate and district tests. Accommodations can be provided if\nthey are included in the Individualized Education Program\n(IEP) or the 504 Accommodation Plan, and some students\nwho are unable to take the test are provided with an alternate\nassessment. These tests are sometimes considered high\nstakes for students with disabilities, because the results may\nbe used to make decisions about grade-level retention or pro-\nmotion and graduation from high school (Thurlow &\nProblem Statement\n\"Increased political pressure on schools to demonstrate stu-\ndent achievement has pushed more and more educators to\nretain failing students in order to implement stricter promo-\ntion standards\" (Ownings & Kaplan, 2001, p. 9).

From a budgetary standpoint, retention might be\nshort sighted. Retaining a student increases the educational\ncost for that student by 8% (Bali, Anagnostopoulos, &\nStudents with disabilities are often being retained as a\nresult of their performance on state testing (Katsiyannis,\nZhang, Ryan, & Jones, 2007). The school department's\nexpectation is that with an extra year of education, the stu-\ndents with disabilities will improve their performance on the\nhigh stakes tests. This is a concern for educators because stu-\ndents with disabilities who perform poorly on the state tests\nmay make the school look less effective when the test scores\nare published. Therefore, this can have a negative effect on\nteacher attitudes toward students with disabilities (Katsiyannis\net al., 2007). It has been found that dropping out of school has\nincreased for students who are retained, and it also has been\nproven that students with disabilities in special education pro-\ngrams are dropping out of high school at a higher rate than\ntheir peers who do not have IEPs (Thurlow & Johnson, 2000).\nNationally, 41% of students with disabilities are dropping out\nof high school (Reschly & Christenson, 2006).\nTeacher attitudes about retention do not necessarily reflect\nthe research. In a study of teacher attitudes about retention, it\nwas concluded that most teachers believe that grade retention\nbetween kindergarten and fourth grade is beneficial for the\nchild (Witmer et al., 2004). Both students with disabilities as\nwell as students without disabilities are sometimes held back\na grade to improve their scores on a high stakes test (Thurlow\n& Johnson, 2000). Teachers are either not informed of the\nresearch regarding grade retention or choosing to go by their\nown professional opinions. The hypothesis for this study is\nthat teachers are retaining students with disabilities due to\nthe pressures associated with passing the high stakes testing\nin the upcoming years.\nBackground of the Study\nHistory of Grade Retention\nIn 1983, A Nation at Risk was published, and it presented a\ndismal picture of American education. It was a call to action\nthat education reform was needed in the United States. A\nNation at Risk called for expanding graduation requirements,\nminimum competency tests, and establishing higher aca-\nA Nation at Risk recommended that our schools needed\nmore rigorous and measurable standards. This implied schools\nneeded to become more accountable in the areas of student\nachievement. The preferred method of determining the level\nof accountability has become \"high stakes testing.\" High\nstakes testing has been introduced to ensure that curriculum\nstandards are being effectively and efficiently taught. High\nstakes tests can determine whether a student passes to the next\ngrade or receives a high school diploma. The introduction of\nnew examinations at every level is one of the most controver-\nsial and lasting reforms from this report (Hayes, 2004).\nHigh Stakes Testing\nAccountability for schools was an essential part of this\nreform movement and therefore, high stakes testing was\ndeveloped. Reform leaders wanted to make schools account-\nable for implementing curriculum standards. The most effi-\ncient and obvious measure of student learning was to develop\ntests. Every state needed to ensure that the curriculum aligned\nwith its state achievement standards was being taught effec-\ntively and efficiently. In order for these tests to be taken seri-\nously, leaders felt they needed the results to be meaningful to\nboth students and school personnel (Hayes, 2004).\nConsequently, to ensure that the tests would be taken ear-\nnestly, the results of tests were not only available to the\nschool district; they were going to be disseminated to the\npublic. Therefore, these tests needed to affect issues that\nwere important to both students and school personnel such as\ngrades, being promoted to the next level, and high school\ngraduation. With the onset of these tests, many states\nincreased their high school graduation requirement. Students\nwould not be able to graduate from high school without pass-\nNCLB 2001 requires accountability of schools and school\ndistricts for student performance. Students in Grades 3\nthrough 8 and once in high school must be tested annually in\nreading and math. Schools are expected to demonstrate that\nthey are making \"adequate yearly progress\" (Hayes, 2004).\nSome feel that NCLB requires that students who are not\nreading by third grade be retained. This retention would be\nfor students who are not meeting end-of-the-year grade-level\nexpectations (Lazarus & Ortega, 2007). Although no such\nrequirement is in the law, since the passage of NCLB, the\nnumber of students being retained has increased due to the\nemphasis on accountability (Jimerson et al., 2006). Schnurr,\nKundert, and Nickerson (2009) suggested,\nWith the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Legislation\n(2001), grade retention is again at the forefront of education and\npolitical debate. It continues to be a widely accepted intervention\nfor struggling students, retention has been revealed to be not\nonly an ineffective and costly intervention with detrimental\nlong-term consequences, but it has limited the discussion of\neffective alternatives for students at risk. (p. 417)\nWith the enactment of these mandates that hold educators\naccountable for student performance, there has been an\nincrease in high stakes testing. Although the accountability\nrequirement was intended for schools and educators, these\nhigh stakes tests impact the students more than the educa-\ntors. High stakes testing can affect a student's course and\ngrade assignment, and whether or not the student is pro-\nmoted to the next grade. Testing results may also determine\nwhether or not the student receives a high school diploma\nGrade Retention and Social Promotion\nGrade retention is the practice of keeping students in their\npresent grade because they have not mastered the skills nec-\nessary to progress to the next grade. Social promotion is the\npractice of keeping students who fail with their age group,\nbecause of the social-emotional impact of retention. President\nWilliam Jefferson Clinton called for an end to social promo-\ntion in his last three State of the Union addresses. President\nClinton stated that a child should not move onto the next\ngrade \"until they are ready\" (Ownings & Kaplan, 2001).\n\"Because there are often short-term gains, many educational\nprofessionals view retention as a success because they do not\nsee the later difficulties that the large majority of retainees\nAs our nation has pushed for higher academic standards\nin our schools, school districts have established minimum\npromotion and graduation standards. Therefore, grade reten-\ntion has emerged as a vehicle for enforcing the standard\ndriven academic system (Randolph, Fraser, & Orthner,\n2004). High stakes testing has decreased the frequency of\nsocial promotion and increased the frequency of grade reten-\ntion (Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005). The idea of grade reten-\ntion is that it will offer students more time for learning.\nHowever, typically the instructional methods do not change\nand the year of retention is just a repeat of what occurred in\nthe previous year (Bonvin, Bless, & Schuepbach, 2008).\nJimerson (1999) found low-achieving students who were\npromoted displayed higher academic achievement in 11th\ngrade. These promoted students were also less likely to drop\nout and more likely to receive a diploma or General Education\nDevelopment (GED). This study suggests that grade reten-\ntion and social promotion are not beneficial in either situa-\ntion. Educators need to seek alternative intervention\nstrategies that will enhance educational outcomes and pro-\nvide effective research-based interventions addressing both\nacademic and emotional needs (Jimerson, 1999).\nWho Is Being Retained?\nDemographics often are predictors of retention. It has been\nshown that African American children, poor children, and\nboys are more likely to be retained (Frey, 2005). Research\nhas also revealed that minority students who have teachers of\nthe same race are less likely to be retained (Bali et al., 2005).\nPredictors for early grade retention were looked at by Byrd\nand Weitzman (1994). This study concluded that several fac-\ntors can influence early school failure such as being raised in\npoverty, low maternal education, or where one or more bio-\nlogical parents were absent. Finances, of course, come into\nplay because retention is costly. School districts with sub-\nstantial revenue and larger districts are more likely to retain\nstudents, because costs may not be as evident. Larger dis-\ntricts have a smaller per student expenditure; therefore, the\ncost of retention is less (Bali et al., 2005). Consequently, a\nchild's race, socioeconomic status, and family, and where the\nchild lives can affect whether or not a child is retained.\nRetention and Teacher Attitudes\nTeacher attitudes toward retention were examined in a study\nconducted by Witmer et al. (2004), and it was found that\nteachers were not necessarily familiar with the research on\nretention. Most teachers felt that, if a child were retained in\nthe years between kindergarten and fourth grade, it would be\nbeneficial. Teachers' felt that retention would improve a\nchild's school success and self-esteem. This study concluded\nthat there is a need to educate the people who are making\ndecisions about retention, about the research, and implica-\ntions for students. \"Overall, teachers described their knowl-\nedge of retention research as limited. The majority attributed\ntheir knowledge to personal experiences with retained stu-\nRetention and Drop-Out Rates\nThe research studying grade retention and dropping out of\nhigh school is not quite clear. A review of the literature has\nshown that grade retention is the strongest predictor of high\nschool drop-out status. Jimerson et al. (2002) indicated that\nthe research also shows students who have been retained in\ntwo grades are 90% more likely to drop out of high school.\nJimerson et al. suggested,\nAn emphasis on accountability and standards has let to political\npressures upon schools nationwide in evaluating their\neffectiveness and overall success by test scores. Of grave\nconcern is that this unprecedented pressure has led to increased\nretention rates in order for schools to demonstrate a commitment\nto standards, rather than consideration of the long-term beneficial\noutcomes for students, particularly given that retention is\nstrongly associated with high school dropout. (p. 454)\nHowever, when Chicago instituted an eighth-grade pro-\nmotional standard requirement, drop-out rates did not\nincrease. Therefore, this study concluded that retention as a\nresult of poor performance on high stakes testing does not\nhave the same effects on retention as teacher initiated reten-\n4 SAGE Open\nIn a study of students with mild disabilities, grade retention was\nfound to be a \"powerful predictor\" of dropping out of high\nschool. For students with disabilities, not being retained was\nassociated with a 73% reduction in the odds of dropping out of\nschool. Students with a disability who dropout are less likely to\nearn a General Education Development (GED) diploma or go to\na post secondary school than their peers without a disability.\nTherefore, it is imperative that students with disabilities continue\nin school and be supported so they can graduate. (Reschly &\nRetention and Test Scores\nIn 1996, Chicago Public schools called for an end to social\npromotion and had promotion testing requirements for third,\nsixth, and eighth grade. This study examined whether reten-\ntion leads to higher achievement for retained students, than if\nthey had been promoted to the next grade. The results showed\nthat retained students had a very limited improvement in\ntheir academic performance the year after the grade retention\nand no substantial effects were noted 2 years later. It con-\ncluded that students did not succeed in their 2nd year, because\nthey were taught with the same approach. This study also\nfound that retaining students increased the likelihood of\nplacement in special education. Another implication of this\nstudy is that teaching techniques need to be examined before\na child is retained. Sometimes a student is struggling due to\nthe teaching approach not due to his or her ability to learn\nJimerson conducted a meta-analysis of grade retention\nresearch in 2001. As a result of this review, it was concluded\nthat neither grade retention nor social promotion in itself will\nprovide the support a child needs for success. Educators need\nto implement research-proven remedial strategies. Jimerson\nsuggests that school psychologists are in a role to help school\nsystems explore new programs to help these at-risk students\nbe successful in school (Jimerson, 2001).\nNCLB\nWith the implementation of NCLB, many educators feared it\nwould increase grade retention. However, the only grades\nthat saw an increase in grade retention were kindergarten and\nfirst grade. It was actually discovered that students' retention\nwas more equitable. The link between low socioeconomic\nlevel and the likelihood of being retained decreased. One\npossible reason for this decline is that educators are basing\nretention decisions on more objective measures such as test\nscores rather than teacher judgment (Viadero, 2007). Due to\nthe requirements of the NCLB and the Individuals With\nDisabilities Education Act 2004 (IDEA), an increasing num-\nber of students with disabilities are being included in high\nstakes tests. All students are being held accountable to profi-\nciency standards and all assessment scores are being reported\n(Albrecht & Joles, 2003). Students with disabilities are given\naccommodations according to their IEP, and a small percent-\nage of students are given an alternate assessment. However,\nthese accommodations are often inadequate because the tests\nare not always appropriate for students with disabilities\n(Meek, 2006). Quite often if students do not pass the test,\nthey are not permitted to go to the next grade (Meek, 2006;\nSchulte, Villwock, Whichard, & Stallings, 2001). Therefore,\nstudents with disabilities might be retained due to an inap-\npropriate test.\n\"As schools face increased pressure to raise test scores,\nstudents who are on the verge of passing the test may receive\nthe greatest attention and support, whereas other students\nwith greater needs want for help\" (Larsen & Akmal, 2007, p.\n47). Therefore, some students are being retained because\nschool districts are putting their time and money into stu-\ndents who can pass the high stakes test. In 2003, retention\nrates for low-income students increased. Frederick and\nHauser (2008) attributed this rise to NCLB which was passed\nin 2002. Some policy makers believe that by having stricter\npromotion requirements, the number of students meeting\nthese higher grade-level standards will increase. Their belief\nis that these higher standards and fear of retention will moti-\nvate students to work harder (David, 2008).\nMany educators are concerned that the pressure from the\nhigh stakes tests are increasing grade retention and changing\nthe curriculum. Students are being forced to learn the content\nof the tests and the curriculum is being narrowed to what is\ngoing to be on the test. Paper-and-pencil tests are not the only\nmeasure of a student's knowledge. Many students are able to\nexpress themselves creatively and these high stakes test do\nnot allow it. It seems that standardized tests should only be\none measure in a portfolio to decide if a child is able to be\npromoted to the next grade (Neill, 2006).\nAccountability and high stakes testing has raised the stan-\ndards for all students, including those with disabilities. IDEA\nand NCLB have led to increased provision of accommoda-\ntions so that students can demonstrate their knowledge on\nthese large-scale assessments. Parents of students with dis-\nabilities are more aware of their rights and are asking for\ntheir students to be included in this more rigorous curricu-\nlum. Students are given greater access to the general educa-\ntion curriculum through enhanced awareness of appropriate\naccommodations to access the curriculum. Therefore, with\nhigher expectations for all, more students are reaching higher\nacademic goals (Ysseldyke et al., 2004).\nEnd of Year Testing\nIn 1996, Chicago Public schools called for an end to social\npromotion and had promotion testing requirements for third,\nsixth and eighth grade. Students were retained if they did not\npass the end-of-the-year test. The results shows that retained\nstudents had a very limited boost in their academic perfor-\nmance the year after the grade retention, and no substantial\neffects were noted 2 years later. It concluded that students\ndid not succeed in their 2nd year, because they were taught\nwith the same approach. Teachers need support to diagnose\nthe problem that the student is having and then design effec-\ntive strategies to support these struggling learners.\nThis study also found that retaining students increased the\nlikelihood of placement in special education. During the\nretention year, students were often diagnosed with a learning\ndisability. The researchers suggest that some students may be\nmislabeled as learning disabled because the special educa-\ntion status will help them to progress to the next grade with-\nout meeting all of the requirements. Therefore, special\neducation is being used as a vehicle to circumvent the end-\nof-year testing policy (Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005).\nSimilarly, the reading scores of retained students were\ncompared with a group of randomly selected students who\nhad not retained. The retained students' scores were com-\npared for growth rates between the initial year and the\nrepeated year. Then their scores were compared with a match\ngroup of promoted students. This analysis showed that the\nretained students did not show a significant increase or\ndecrease in reading scores in the 2nd year of that grade. The\npromoted students showed significantly more growth overall\nthan the retained students. This study concludes that as reten-\ntion is a costly venture and the benefits do not outweigh the\npositive intent, other types of interventions should be exam-\nined (Silberglitt, Jimerson, Appleton, & Burns, 2006).\nIn 2003, Texas required third graders to receive a mini-\nmum score on its state-mandated reading test to be promoted\nto fourth grade. In addition, in 2005, fifth graders had to meet\na minimum score on both a reading and math test to be pro-\nmoted to sixth grade. Lorence and Dworkin (2006) followed\nstudents who failed third grade in May 1994 in Texas and\nrepeated third grade until these students were in tenth grade.\nThis study concluded that after repeating third grade, the\nreading scores of the students who had been retained\nremained consistent with the scores of socially promoted stu-\ndents. However, as the years progressed, the students who\nwere retained in third grade surpassed their peers who had\nbeen socially promoted. Many of the students who were\nsocially promoted took an extra year to pass the state reading\ntest whereas the students who were retained passed on time.\nIn a study of how standards-based reform affected teacher\nquality, it was found that administrators were reducing class\nsize and putting more experienced teachers in the grades that\nwere being tested (Viadero, 2007). In Florida, third-grade\nstudents were being retained because they failed the state\nhigh stakes assessment (Florida Comprehensive Assessment\nTest [FCAT]). In some schools, second graders were being\nretained because school personnel believed that these stu-\ndents would not be able to pass the test in third grade (Lazarus\nrepeat third grade after failing to meet the state's end-of-\ngrade standard. Therefore, it was decided that school person-\nnel could override the test scores after reviewing student\nwork and other factors (Goldberg, 2004). The decision of\ngrade retention is an important one and should be made by\nexamining multiple assessments and several sources of evi-\nDue to the requirements of NCLB and IDEA, an increas-\ning number of students with disabilities are being included in\nhigh stakes tests. Students are provided testing accommoda-\ntions and a small percentage of students participate in an\nalternate assessment. However, these accommodations are\noften inadequate because the tests are not always appropriate\nfor students with disabilities (Meek, 2006). Therefore, if stu-\ndents do not pass the test, they are not permitted to go to the\nnext grade although the test was not a proper measure of their\nAlternatives to Retention\nThe review of the literature consistently agrees that there\nshould be an end to social promotion and grade retention.\nEducators need to focus on implementing teaching practices\nthat will prevent academic failure. However, the literature\noffers suggestions of alternatives and concedes that deciding\nwhich is right for a school system will be a difficult endeavor.\nIncluded among the suggestions for alternatives to grade\nretention are several studies suggesting that one way to pre-\nvent early school failure is to develop preschool intervention\nprograms. These programs would target at-risk children and\nassist them in developing the social and cognitive skills neces-\nsary for early success in school. Head Start programs have\nbeen doing this successfully for several decades (Barnett &\nHustedt, 2005). It has been proven that targeting these skills at\nan early age can prevent retention (Lincove & Painter, 2006).\nEffective early reading programs are also indicated in the\nliterature as an effective way to prevent retention. Reading is\nan essential skill for success in school; therefore, all children\nneed to learn to read in the early grades. Reading instruction\nneeds to be structured and teachers need to be trained in the\nmost effective programs for their population (Lincove &\nSummer school and afterschool programs will provide\nmany students with additional opportunities for instructional\nsupport. The literature is clear that programs that focus on\neffective teaching and offer remedial intervention programs\nimprove student achievement. Hence, students with this\nadditional support either after school or during the summer\nare less likely to drop out of school due to repeating a grade\nProfessional development for teachers is critical if grade\nretention is going to be eliminated. Teachers need to be\ntrained in teaching strategies which will improve learning for\nall students. Training in assessment techniques that drive\ninstruction, as well as monitoring student's progress while\nthey are being taught, will help teachers to teach effectively.\nDistricts need to set clear policies on retention and promo-\ntion as well giving teachers the training that is necessary to\nprovide effective instruction (Bowman, 2005).\n6 SAGE Open\nConclusion\nResearch has shown that retention and social promotion are\nnot viable solutions for struggling students. Research has\nidentified students who are more likely to be retained and\nthose who need more support in their academic career.\nNonetheless, with increased political pressure to establish\nachievement standards for students and school accountabil-\nity for students' performance, school systems are under\nscrutiny. Schools are expected to improve student achieve-\nment and test scores and provide appropriate supports and\nservices for struggling learners. Teachers and administra-\ntors are often making these retention decisions without\nknowledge of the research and quite often there are not\nmany supports available for their struggling students due to\nbudget constraints.\nThe literature provides many suggestions for alternatives\nto retention. However, these alternatives can be costly, which\nmay limit the options considered by districts. Several factors\nmay influence the decision: the population to be served, the\nresources available to support such programs, state and local\ntesting requirements, and the training for teachers. The chal-\nlenge is that student populations vary in each and every\nclassroom; yet the teacher needs to be effective for all the\nchildren in the class. Districts need to determine how train-\ning and support can be provided effectively and efficiently\nthrough this difficult process.\nAlthough the research is clear on the ineffectiveness of\nretention and the need for alternatives, teachers continue to\nretain both students with and without disabilities. Therefore,\nthere is a need to examine why teachers are making these\nretention decisions and what factors need to change in order\nfor the struggling students to receive support without adding\nanother year of education.\nResearch Questions\nThe research questions guiding this study were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Are there differences in elementary\nteachers' decision-making process regarding retention\nfor students with and without disabilities?\nResearch Question 2: What factors influence elementary\nteachers' decision-making process about retaining stu-\ndents with and without disabilities?\nResearch Question 3: How does student performance on\nstate testing affect elementary teachers' decision-mak-\ning process about retaining students with and without\ndisabilities?\nResearch Design\nThis study used a concurrent triangulation, mixed method in\nwhich elementary teachers responded to a questionnaire and\nthen selected teachers were interviewed. This two-phase\nstudy began with collecting quantitative data from the ques-\ntionnaire at three different elementary schools in an urban\nschool district (Creswell & Clark, 2007). The survey of N =\n74 teachers was cross-sectional because all the data were col-\nlected at one time (Creswell, 2003). Following the gathering\nof data from the questionnaire, n = 9 teacher interviews were\nscheduled and conducted.\nSample\nThe sample for this study consists of N = 74 teachers from n\n= 3 elementary schools in an urban school district in\nSoutheastern Massachusetts. This district has n = 9 elemen-\ntary schools. The researcher attended faculty meetings for\nthese n = 3 schools to distribute and collect the question-\nnaires at the meetings. Teachers who completed the ques-\ntionnaire were asked to volunteer to be interviewed at a\nfuture date and time. The researcher selected teachers from\ndifferent grade levels at each school as well as two special\neducation teachers. The researcher interviewed n = 9 teach-\ners from the three elementary schools during the teacher's\npreparation period.\nInstrumentation\nThe paper-and-pencil instrument designed by the researcher\ncontained 24 items requiring responses using a Likert-type\nscale (Appendix A). The response scale ranged from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and it included two\nopen-ended questions and a checklist. For each question,\nteachers were asked to respond how they perceived each\nquestion for both regular education students as well as stu-\ndents with disabilities. For the purpose of this study, stu-\ndents with disabilities were defined as any student with an\nIEP or a 504 Accommodation Plan. The principals allowed\ntime at the meeting for the researcher to explain the survey\nand for the teachers to complete it. The instrument was con-\nstructed from a review of the literature and the judgmental\nreview by n = 3 elementary teachers to increase content\nvalidity (Beck & Gable, 2001). A consent form was attached\nto the questionnaire and with its completion, the teachers\nconsented to participate.\nThe instrument was piloted with a group of n=3 elemen-\ntary teachers who were not involved in the study. The qual-\nitative data were compiled by the researcher from the\ninterviews with the elementary school teachers. The inter-\nview questions were determined from the review of the\nliterature and the open-ended questions in the question-\nnaire (Appendix B). The interviewer asked questions that\nwere designed to evoke vivid descriptions and anecdotes.\nFollow-up questions were designed to provide nuanced\nanswers that provided more precise descriptions and refine\nthe understandings. Richness of ideas and themes was\nencouraged by asking the interviewee to elaborate on their\nanswers.\nThe researcher utilized Rubin and Rubin's (2005)\nresponsive interviewing technique to obtain a deeper under-\nstanding of the perceptions of the teachers being inter-\nviewed. The interviewer used a predetermined set of\nquestions but allowed the interviewee to digress into topics\nrelevant to the study. The interviews were structured, so\nthat the data were detailed, vivid, and rich with thematic\nmaterial (Rubin & Rubin, 2005). Throughout the interview\nprocess, the researcher made an audit trail to ensure a chain\nof evidence linking the research questions and the data\n(Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2007). The interviews were audiotaped\nwith the participants' permission. Participants also con-\nsented to the interviews being transcribed as well for any\nfuture use for presentations.\nData Collection\nThe researcher was able to attend faculty meetings at the\nthree schools. This gave the researcher time to explain the\nsurvey instrument and interview process. The teachers were\ngiven time to complete the surveys at the meeting and the\nresearcher was able to collect the survey and interview vol-\nunteer information. When the survey instrument was\nadministered, there was a separate sheet for teachers to use\nif they were interested in being interviewed at a later date.\nTeachers who volunteered to be interviewed placed the\nsheet in a separate collection box; therefore, there was not\na process to connect the individual teacher with his or her\nsurvey instrument.\nAfter the survey data had been collected, the responses\nto the open-ended questions were reviewed to see if supple-\nmentary questions needed to be added to the interview pro-\ntocol. The interviews were conducted in a face-to-face\nmanner and enabled the participants to give historical infor-\nmation about children whom they had retained and how\ntheir decisions had been made as to whether or not to retain\na child as well as what factors they consider when retaining\na child.\nAn interview protocol was used to guide the interviewer.\nThe interviewer took notes and also audiotaped the inter-\nview with the permission of the participants (Creswell,\n2003). The interview questions for teachers included ques-\ntions about the benefits of retention and what factors influ-\nenced their decisions to retain a student. Teachers were first\nasked to sign a consent form giving the researcher permis-\nsion to use the information provided in the interview. The\ninterviewer asked open-ended questions and audiotaped the\ninterviews with the participant's permission. Finally, the\nresearcher gathered the data and analyzed them for themes.\nSubsequently, the researcher transcribed the interviews and\nsent the transcript to the participants. Member checking was\nutilized by the researcher sending the transcript to the inter-\nviewees by email for their review to determine the accuracy\nData Analysis\nFor the first research question, quantitative data were\nextracted from the questionnaire by using descriptive statis-\ntics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard devia-\ntions) where appropriate. A paired t test was used to compare\nthe differences between the means of responses of teachers\nwhen considering retention for students with and without\ndisabilities. Qualitative data from the open-ended questions\non the survey as well as an interview question were also uti-\nlized in this analysis. The second research question data were\ngathered from survey questions, a checklist on the survey,\nand some of the interview questions. The last research ques-\ntion used qualitative data from an open-ended question on\nthe survey and interview questions. However, there were\nfour quantitative questions on the survey regarding this topic.\nThe purpose of the concurrent triangulation strategy was\nto confirm or corroborate the finding with this mixed-meth-\nods study (Creswell, 2003). Therefore, once the quantitative\nand qualitative data were analyzed, the researcher merged\nthe two sets of data. Both data sets were looked at equally\nand the findings were compared and synthesized (Creswell\n& Clark, 2007). The reports of the findings were sent to all of\nthe principals involved in this study as well as the superin-\ntendent of the district.\nFindings\nResearch Question 1: Are there differences in elementary\nteachers' decision-making process regarding retention\nfor students with and without disabilities?\nAcademic Performance\nThere were two items on the survey with the largest effect\nsizes for the t statistic (Appendix C). The first item was \"I am\nmore likely to retain a student than send him or her to the\nnext grade without the necessary skills.\" This item was more\nsignificant for special education students. Lorence and\nDworkin (2006) indicated in their study that special educa-\ntion students were more likely to be socially promoted\nbecause they were not required to meet the grade-level\nbenchmarks. The teachers in this study expressed just the\nopposite view. Based on their survey responses, the teachers\nwere more likely to retain a student with a disability than a\nregular education student who does not have the necessary\nskills to go to the next grade. The literature also cites aca-\ndemic performance as the most important factor teachers\nconsider when making decisions regarding grade retention\nand this study found similar findings (Witmer et al., 2004).\nTwo other items that showed a statistical trend were \"I\nretain students because I am worried they will fail the next\ngrade\" and \"I retain students who are failing two major sub-\njects\" (Appendix C). These items were found to be more\n8 SAGE Open\nsignificant for regular education students. These two items\nreflect concerns about academic performance which has\nbeen reported in the literature as the most important factor\nwhen teachers are making a decision regarding grade reten-\nteachers in this study considered academic performance a\nconcern for both students with and without disabilities.\nRetention More Effective in Grades K-2\nThe second item was \"I believe retention is more effective in\nthe earlier grades (K-2),\" which had an effect size of .41\n(Appendix C). This item was more significant for regular\neducation students. The belief that grade retention is better\nfor students in earlier grades is evident in the literature on\ngrade retention (Witmer et al., 2004). This belief is also evi-\ndent in the results of this survey in particular for regular edu-\ncation students.\nPositive Retention in the Past\nOne item that showed a statistical trend was \"I have retained\nstudents who have been very successful in future years of\nschool\" and was found to be more significant for regular\neducation students (Appendix C). Larsen and Akmal (2007)\nfound that although teachers knew the research on grade\nretention stated it was generally not effective, most teachers\ncould remember a specific case where it seemed to be benefi-\ncial. Therefore, they continue to hold on the feeling that for\nsome children, the retention might work. Jimerson (1999)\nindicated that teachers feel grade retention is successful\nbecause they see success in 1 or 2 years following the reten-\ntion. However, teachers typically do not follow the student\nthrough high school. A similar finding in this study emerged\nduring an interview, when a fourth-grade teacher commented\non a former student whom she had retained, and had a posi-\ntive experience:\nA couple of years ago I retained a student in fourth grade. The\nchild was immature. Teachers had been passing him on because\nhe was nice. I fought to hold him back because I thought it\nwould be beneficial. It was successful. The second year he\nreceived B's and C's. In fifth grade, he was a B student. His\nmom said it was the best thing that ever happened. She thanked\nme and said she was asking for him to be retained since\nkindergarten.\nRemedial Support\nThe last item that showed a trend in the teachers' ratings was\n\"I am more likely to retain a student who does not receive\nany remedial support\" (Appendix C). This item was also\nfound to be more noteworthy for regular education students.\nIt seems obvious that this would be more significant for reg-\nular education students because students with disabilities are\nalready receiving remedial support. A third-grade teacher\ncommented during her interview, \"I am more apt to send a\nchild on if I know they are going to get support in the follow-\ning grade.\" A first-grade teacher commented, \"We need more\nservices and support as opposed to grade retention.\" Lincove\nand Painter (2006) indicated the need for appropriate instruc-\ntion to meet individual student's need as an alternative to\ngrade retention. Jimerson (2001) indicated in his meta-anal-\nysis that the need for additional remediation strategies and\nsupport to facilitate educational success for all students was\na common theme in the literature on grade retention.\nResearch Question 2: What factors influence elementary\nteachers' decision-making process about retaining stu-\ndents with and without disabilities?\nAcademic Performance\nAccording to the totals, 77% of respondents indicated on the\nchecklist that academic performance influenced their deci-\nsion-making process regarding grade retention, making this\nfactor the most frequently cited (Appendix D). This concurs\nwith Witmer et al. (2004) in their study of teacher's beliefs\nand knowledge about grade retention, which found that aca-\ndemic performance was considered twice as important as the\nsecond most important factor (ability). Witmer et al. also\nfound effort and maturity to be significant factors. The least\ncited factors in this study were summer birthdays and self-\nesteem with only 10% of respondents indicating that they\nconsidered these factors in their decision making. During the\ninterviews, 89% of the teachers cited academic performance\nas a factor they consider when retaining a student.\nMaturity\nThe participant's choices by the number of years they have\nbeen teaching indicate that respondents who have been\nteaching for fewer years (0-20 years) considered a child's\nmaturity more than teachers those who have been teaching\nfor a longer period of time (21-40 years;Appendix E). During\nthe interview, a teacher who had been teaching for 12 years\ncommented, \"The biggest factor is maturity. Can the child\nmaintain focus? Can the child do work that is well thought\nout and well done?\" A teacher who has been teaching for 27\nyears commented, \"Maturity plays a part in my decision but\nnot a big one.\" When responses were organized by grade-\nlevel taught, teachers who taught kindergarten through sec-\nond grade (72%) indicated that they considered maturity\nwhen making a decision regarding grade retention more than\nMaturity is cited in the research as an area that teachers look\nat in kindergarten and first grade to determine whether a\nchild should repeat a grade, be placed in a transition room, or\nHigh Stakes Testing\nHigh stakes testing was indicated most by Grades 3 to 5\nteachers (23%) while only 9% of K-2 teachers indicated it\nwas a factor and none of the coaches (Appendix F). As the\nMassachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)\nbegins in Grade 3, it would be logical that Grades 3 to 5\nteachers would be feeling the most pressure in elementary\nschools. Vinovskis (2009) discussed the pressure that educa-\ntors feel as a result from high stakes testing and how it affects\ntheir decision making in regard to grade retention.\nParental Support\nMost of the teachers interviewed felt parental support was\nvery important. Several teachers responded that they were\nless apt to retain if parents were willing to get involved and\nsupport academics at home or get tutoring. A second-grade\nteacher commented, \"If parents support retention, then it is\neasier to retain. Some parent's will help you and write a\nletter in support of retention. If parents fight you then I\ndon't push for retention.\" Parental support is cited in the\nresearch as an important component to student success\nSocial and Emotional Concerns\nSocial and emotional concerns were also noted. The majority\nof teachers felt retention was better if it was done in the ear-\nlier grades where it did not have a big social stigma. A first-\ngrade teacher expressed concern that, \"When a child is\nretained, he or she sees it as a punishment.\" This concurs\nwith Byrnes and Yamamoto's (2001) finding that nonpromo-\ntion is considered a punishment for one's inability to suc-\nceed. The teachers expressed concern that as students get\nolder, the other students in the class can be mean. A special\nneeds teacher who expressed concern that repeating in an\nupper grade can be negative commented, \"It is also negative\nto sit in a class that is too difficult. Then the child might\nbecome a behavior problem.\"\nSpecial Education Teachers\nConsider a Multitude of Factors\nWhen examining the responses by the role that teacher has in\nthe school, the results illustrate that special education teach-\ners were likely to indicate more factors for retention as compared\nwith regular education teachers and coaches (Appendix D). The\nn = 5 teachers who were interviewed and had a special edu-\ncation background considered a multitude of factors when\nretaining a student. These data suggest that special educators\nare examining more factors than regular education teachers\nand coaches when making a decision about retention. During\nan interview, a fifth-grade special education teacher com-\nmented, \"You need to look at the whole child, both academic\nand social. There may be a student who struggles with aca-\ndemics but should not repeat because it is socially detrimen-\ntal.\" The opinions of these teachers are consistent with the\nresearch that decisions about students placements should be\nfrom a variety of indicators of which high stakes testing is\nResearch Question 3: How does student performance on\nstate testing affect elementary teachers' decision-mak-\ning process about retaining students with and without\ndisabilities?\nHigh Stakes Testing--One Factor\nof Many That Are Considered\nTeachers clearly expressed concern about the pressure and\naccountability they felt from the MCAS as well as the con-\ncern that students need to pass the high school test to gradu-\nate. Some teachers indicated that the MCAS data are released\ntoo late to make retention decisions and that MCAS has\nchanged their teaching, not their grade retention decisions.\nWhen asked about MCAS, one regular education teacher\nresponded, \"I worry more about the student not having the\nskills. They will need to pass MCAS--so I now consider\nretention, when before I did not worry much.\" The literature\non grade retention indicates that the focus on accountability\nand test scores has put more of a focus on grade retention\nThe first interview question was \"What do you perceive\nthe relationship between grade retention and high stakes test-\ning to be\"? The teachers interviewed felt that grade retention\nshould be looked at on a case by case manner and it should\nbe a team decision. It was felt that high stakes testing should\nbe one item among many that are considered when making\nthis decision which is consistent with the literature (Neill,\n2006). Some of the kindergarten, first-, and second-grade\nteachers expressed concern regarding pressure from the\nupper grade teachers to retain some struggling students. The\nteachers said the upper grade teachers complain to the lower\ngrade teachers that certain students are not ready to take the\ntest. A first-grade teacher responded, \"Some people feel if a\nstudent is kept back a year then they will be more mature for\nthe MCAS in third, fourth, or fifth grade. They think they\nwill be able to sit longer for the test.\" This teacher went on to\nsay that she did not feel retention will always improve test\nscores and that we need to look at the underlying reason why\nthe child is struggling. Jimerson (2001) reiterated that reme-\ndial strategies are more effective than grade retention and\nsocial promotion.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe practices of grade retention and social promotion have\nbeen debated for decades. The research indicates that the\nbenefits of grade retention are limited and most students\nprofit from being promoted to the next grade with academic\nsupport (Jimerson, 2001). However, with the onset of high\nstakes testing and greater accountability for schools, grade\nretention has become an issue again. Teachers are feeling\nthe pressure to meet the end-of-the year requirements for\nboth students with and without disabilities (Larsen &Akmal,\nWhen comparing their perceptions regarding regular edu-\ncation students and special education students, teachers con-\nsidered academic performance as a factor for both students\nwith and without disabilities. For regular education students,\nteachers felt it was better to retain them in the earlier grades\nand remembered retaining a student in the past that had been\na positive experience.\nWhen considering what factors teacher's use in regard to\ngrade retention, academic performance was the most promi-\nnent. This is consistent with the literature (Witmer et al.,\n2004). Maturity continues to be an important factor espe-\ncially among teachers of the lower grades and special educa-\ntors. Special education teachers as a whole tended to consider\nmore factors when considering retention decisions. Teachers\nwere also concerned about the amount of remedial support\ntheir students would be receiving in the next grade.\nThe hypothesis for this study was that teachers are retain-\ning students with disabilities due to the pressures associated\nwith passing the high stakes testing in the upcoming years.\nTeachers were clear that they felt pressure to raise the test\nscores. They indicated that they were being held accountable\nfor the student's progress and MCAS had changed the way\nthey were teaching. However, they did not feel high stakes\ntesting alone was increasing the prevalence of grade reten-\ntion in their district. The teachers felt test scores should be\none piece of a larger picture that is examined by a team when\nmaking a decision regarding grade retention. Teachers\nreported that when they would like to retain a child they\nneeded to gather all test scores as well as work samples and\nsend it to central administration before retaining a student. It\nwas noted that this was a new policy that was developed in\nthe past 2 years.\nRecommendations\nAfter a review of the findings in this study and the literature,\nrecommendations can be made for both district administra-\ntors and teachers.\nFor District Administrators\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Continue to provide professional development for\nteachers regarding how to support struggling learners.\nTeachers indicated on the survey that they were inter-\nested in more training.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Continue to make grade retention a team decision.\nTest scores should be one factor of many when con-\nsidering this decision.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Evaluate more ways to support struggling students.\nLook at school personnel to consider who can help\nprovide interventions for at-risk students.\nFor Teachers\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Continue to provide students with research-based\nteaching that supports all students.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Consider a multitude of factors when making a deci-\nsion regarding grade retention. Familiarize and edu-\ncate yourself on the research regarding grade\nretention.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Work with building administrators to develop a plan\nto provide interventions for struggling students to pre-\nvent grade retention.\nFor Further Study\nThis study explored teacher perceptions regarding grade\nretention for students with and without disabilities. After\nreviewing the findings, area of future research are\nrecommended:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What specific interventions can be provided to strug-\ngling students to prevent grade retention for students\nwith and without disabilities?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How can students be supported when they are strug-\ngling but do not qualify for special education\nservices?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How can students with disabilities be supported to\npass the high stakes test?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the effects of high stakes testing on grade\nretention for students with disabilities?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What is the relationship of teacher perceptions of\ngrade retention in regard to the setting in which they\nare teaching--urban versus suburban?\nSummary\nThis mixed-methods study examined teacher perceptions\nregarding grade retention for students with and without dis-\nabilities. The results of this study indicate that teachers con-\nsider a multitude of factors when considering grade retention\nfor their struggling students. Academic performance and\nmaturity were the factors that were indicated the most.\nTeachers reported they felt pressure and accountability in\nregard to high stakes testing but did not believe it was or\nshould be the sole reason a child is retained. Teachers felt\ngrade retention needed to be a team decision and a variety of\nfactors need to be considered.\nSpecial education teachers considered more factors than\nregular education teachers when making a decision about\ngrade retention. Teachers felt retention was more effective\nfor regular education students if it was done in an earlier\ngrade and teachers could recall a past experience where they\nhad retained a student and it was a positive experience.\nOverall, the results of this study were consistent with the\nresearch on teacher perceptions about grade retention.\nAppendix A\nRetention Survey\nPlease read the following statements and respond using the\nrating scale for both regular education students (Reg.
