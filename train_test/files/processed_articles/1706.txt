Popkin3*\n3Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 and 4San Diego State University, Graduate School\n Introduction\nThe United States Latino population, of whom ,60% are of\nMexican origin, is the largest growing segment of the population\nwith a growth rate almost 4 times that of the total population\n(1). This increase is partly a function of high fertility levels\namong this subpopulation but is also due to migration (2); an\nestimated 37% of the total foreign-born (FB)5 population living\nin the US was born in Mexico or Central America (3). This has\nled to extensive research on the role of acculturation and\nimmigrant status on health.\nResearchers have often concluded that living in the US\nadversely affects the health of Hispanics (4\u00ad8). Under the\nconcept of the Hispanic paradox, which refers to the tendency\nfor Hispanics to enjoy relatively good health despite socioeco-\nnomic disadvantages (9), it is frequently noted that Hispanics\ntend to have healthier diets prior to arriving in the US.\nFurthermore, it has been observed that the longer Hispanics\nare in the US, the worse their diets become (8). Such shifts in\nhealth-related behaviors are associated with the higher rates of\nobesity and diabetes among US Hispanics (10) and among those\nwho have lived here for $15 y (11). The hypothesis is that\nthrough exposure to the US environment and lifestyle, there is\nadoption of the dominant culture's behaviors and norms,\nincluding greater consumption of away-from-home foods (par-\nticularly fast food) for both lunch and dinner.\nIn the absence of more rigorous studies of the acculturation\nprocess (e.g. national longitudinal studies), researchers have\nattempted to develop a consensus on the most meaningful\noperationalization of this process. Language spoken at home\nand length of time residing in the US are 2 such operationali-\nexamining the influence of country of origin, which may be\nparticularly important given the diversity of countries repre-\nsented by Hispanics in the US. Although Mexicans are the\nlargest Hispanic group in the US, estimated at 28.4 million in\n2006, there is considerable heterogeneity among Hispanic\nsubgroups (15), including differences in histories of immigra-\ntion to the US, age, socioeconomic status, and location of\nresidence in the US. For example, Mexican-Americans tend\nto be younger, less educated, and have lower incomes than\nCuban-Americans (16).\n1 Author disclosures: K. Duffey, P. Gordon-Larsen, G. Ayala, and B.

Additionally, little is known about\nwhether potential differences are modified by birthplace or\ndegree of acculturation. Separating Mexican from other His-\npanic subgroups is particularly important because adult resi-\ndents of Mexico now have obesity levels similar to US residents\n(71% of Mexican women and 66% of Mexican men were\noverweight or obese in 2006), whereas rates of overweight and\nobesity are lower in Cuba, Dominican Republic, and all other\nCentral and South American populations (17\u00ad19).\nThis study seeks to understand this gap by using nationally\nrepresentative data to: 1) examine differences in the percent of\nenergy from specific food and beverage groups by ethnicity; 2)\ndetermine whether birthplace modifies the relationship between\nethnicity and dietary intake; and 3) examine the relationship\nbetween degree of acculturation (defined as language spoken in\nthe home) and percent of energy from selected food groups.\nMethods\nParticipants and data source. This study uses secondary data collected\nsamples contained stratified area probability samples of noninstitution-\nalized US households. Each survey year was designed to be nationally\nrepresentative. Detailed information about each survey and its sampling\ndesign have been published previously (20\u00ad23). From the full NHANES\nsample, we selected a subgroup of individuals identifying themselves as\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nDietary intake and food groups. Dietary intake information was\ncollected by 24-h dietary recall, which was administered in person by\ntrained interviewers. Respondents reported all foods and beverages\nconsumed in the previous 24-h time period, including names of foods,\ntimes consumed, type of meal or snack, and location of food consump-\ntion. Instructions and interviews were completed in either English or\nSpanish. Collection of dietary information was aided by a 4-step\nautomated coding and collection system (Computer Assisted Dietary\nused for data collection (21). Although the 4- and 5-step automated\nsystems are very similar, they do introduce a source of methodological\nvariation. However, it is unlikely that differences in the dietary recall\nmethodology would result in differential dietary recalls by ethnicity [i.e.\nthat foreign born (FB) other Hispanics would respond differently than\nFB Mexicans] and are therefore not expected to differentially affect\nour results. Because only a single 24-h recall was available for years\ndataset.\nWe used a modified University of North Carolina food-grouping\nsystem (24) to group all reported foods and beverages into 57 food\ngroups based on nutrient (i.e. fat and fiber content) and behavioral\nconsumption (i.e. snacking) characteristics. Beverage groups are in\naccordance with the recently suggested Beverage Guidance System (25).\nBased on this and previous work (26,27), it was determined that many of\nthese food groupings did not facilitate differentiation of dietary intake\nbetween ethnic subgroups and thus it was most convenient to create\ngroups comprised of combinations of foods. For example, it was more\nappropriate to use a combined vegetable group instead of individual\ngreen and orange vegetables, low-fiber vegetables, medium-fiber vege-\ntables, and high-fiber vegetables groups. Similarly, given space limita-\ntions, it was not possible to present differences for all 57 food groups.\nResults are presented for foods/food groups that represented at least 2%\nof total energy intake for at least 1 subgroup [FB or US-born (USB)\nMexican or other Hispanic] or for which there was at least a 1%\ndifference between 2 groups (i.e. Mexican FB consumed 2.4% more\nenergy from legumes and soybeans than USB Mexicans).\nOur final analyses were conducted on 57 variables, 24 of which are\npresented here, representing the proportion of energy from each food/\nbeverage group. Examples of the food groups used include: legumes and\nsoybeans (e.g. lentils, pinto, black, soy, and garbanzo beans), low-fat/\nhigh-fiber breads (e.g. tortillas, whole-wheat breads, and bread prod-\nucts), fruits (citrus and noncitrus, fresh and dried), vegetables (e.g. lima\nbeans, corn, squash, and tomatoes) snacks and desserts (e.g. cookies,\npastries, ice cream sandwiches, crackers, chips, and popcorn), and non-\nMexican fast food (e.g. pizza, French fries, hamburgers, and Chinese\nfrom fast food restaurants). Additionally, we examined several beverage\nvariables, including low- (1.5% or skim) and high-fat milk (2% or higher\nand buttermilk), soda and fruit drinks (fruit drinks that are not 100%\njuice), and fruit and vegetable juice (only 100% juice). Potatoes were\ngrouped separately from all other vegetables and French fries were also\ngrouped independently but later combined with other fast food items\n(due to negligible differences in consumption) into the non-Mexican fast\nfood group. More detailed descriptions and sample foods for each of the\n24 food groups presented in the article can be found in the Online\nSupplemental Material.\nAcculturation variables and additional covariates. All demographic\nand socioeconomic variables were collected using a combination of in-\nperson and in-home interviews. For the 2 ethnic subgroups, Mexican and\nother Hispanic, we examined degree of acculturation, which was defined\nusing 2 unique variables: birthplace (USB vs. FB) and language spoken in\nthe home (primarily Spanish speaker, yes/no).

All analyses were completed in Stata 10.0 (Stata\nCorp) using weighted survey commands to account for study design and\nsampling methods. Sampling methods have been described in detail\nelsewhere (23,28,29). Briefly, data are collected using a complex,\nmultistage probability sampling designed to select participants that are\nrepresentative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Indi-\nviduals are selected from households, which are selected from segments,\nwhich are selected from counties across the US. Oversampling of certain\nsubgroups is done to increase the reliability and precision of estimates\nof health status indicators for those groups. Relevant to this article,\nDemographic characteristics were summarized for all ethnic groups\nand are presented as means and or percentages 6 SEM. Comparisons\nbetween ethnicity and/or birthplace were conducted using Student's\nt tests for means or chi-square tests for proportions. All P-values were\n2-tailed and significance was defined as P , 0.05.\nTo examine the relationship between acculturation and diet, we\ngenerated a weighted mean [using 2-stage marginal effect models\n(MEM)] of percent energy from each food group on ethnicity and\nbirthplace or being a Spanish speaker. MEM are appropriate where the\nordinary least-squares (OLS) assumption of normality is violated. For\nexample, nearly 43% of our sample did not consume high-fat milk, so an\nOLS estimate of ethnicity/birthplace for percent of energy from high-fat\nmilk would be misestimated.\nUsing a 2-stage modeling process, MEM first estimate the probability\nof consuming a given food and then, among consumers, estimate the\neffect of the exposure on the amount consumed. These values are then\nmultiplied and the resulting estimate is a weighted mean of the effect of\nthe exposure on consumption amount in the full sample. There was a\nsignificant interaction between the exposures ethnicity and birthplace\n(Wald chunk test; P , 0.05), so indicator variables [Mexican FB\n(referent); Mexican USB; other Hispanic FB; other Hispanic USB] were\nused to model the relationship between this indicator of acculturation\nand percent of energy from selected foods.\nTo examine the Spanish language exposure variable, a dichotomous\nvariable was used. A control variable ``no language information\navailable'' was also included to account for those who did not provide\nBirthplace and dietary intake among Hispanics 2429\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ninformation on their primary language used at home. We tested and did\nnot find a significant 3-way interaction between ethnicity, birthplace, and\nbeing a Spanish speaker or between birthplace, income, and being a\nSpanish speaker. Bootstrap estimation, using random sampling from the\ndataset with replacement, was used to generate standard errors around\nmarginal effect estimates. All models controlled for gender, age, family\nincome, and education.\nLogistic regression models were used to estimate the percent of each\nethnic group [Mexican USB, other Hispanic USB, and other Hispanic FB\nvs. Mexican FB (referent)] that consumed food and beverage groups.\nFinally, we estimated the amount eaten among consumers (persons who\nactually reported consuming a food or food group) by ethnicity and\nbirthplace (USB vs. FB) using OLS regression. To ease interpretation,\nwe transformed the estimated percent of energy from each food group\ninto absolute predicted mean kilocalories. For example, if 9% of an\ndrink, we present 198 predicted mean kcal/d (829 kJ/d) from soda.\nLikewise, if consumers of the legumes and soybeans food group obtained\npredicted kcal/(consumer\u00c1d) [921 kJ/(consumer\u00c1d)]. Similar to other\nstudies, all models controlled for gender, age, family income, and\neducation (5,11). Differences in percent of energy from food groups were\ntested using t tests and are considered significant at the P , 0.05 level.\nResults\nFB other Hispanics were slightly older, whereas FB Mexicans\nwere slightly younger than their USB counterparts (P , 0.05)\n(Table 1).

Specifically, we\nsought to compare percent of daily energy intake between\nMexicans and other Hispanics who were either USB or FB to\ndetermine whether birthplace was differentially related to diet\nwithin ethnic groups. We found that acculturation, having been\nborn in the US, was associated with a lower percentage of energy\nfrom arguably ``healthier'' food groups, specifically legumes,\nfruits, and vegetables. At the same time, more acculturated\nHispanics seem to consume a greater percent of energy from less\nhealthy foods such as snacks and fast foods. These foods are also\nthose that tend to be associated with increased risk of non-\nGenerally, the greatest differences were observed between FB\nand USB Mexicans, supporting the hypothesis that accultura-\ntion, and not just modernization, might account for differences\nin diet. Similar results to ours have been reported previously\namong adults (35), but discrepant findings have been reported\namong adolescents (5) and may reflect underlying differences in\ndietary patterns of older compared with younger Mexicans. The\nlack of significant differences between USB and FB other\nHispanics might be due more to the relative heterogeneity of\nethnicities represented by this group rather than an actual lack of\ndifferences between those born in the US or elsewhere. We were\nnot able to more specifically characterize other Hispanics due to\nsampling design and the small sample sizes.\nDietarypatternshighinfruits,vegetables,andfiberaretypically\nconsidered ``healthier'' (36,37) and these consumption patterns\ntend to be associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist\ncircumference (38) and a reduced risk of other chronic diseases\n(39,40) compared with other dietary patterns. Our findings,\ncombined with the results from other studies in the same\npopulation (41), suggest that USB Hispanics, and Mexicans in\nparticular, might be at increased risk for nutrition-related chronic\ndisease.\nSpecific health-related consequences of the shifts toward a\nmore nontraditional dietary pattern have been observed in both\nchildren and adults. A study of Latino families in San Diego\nCounty, CA, found that BMI was positively correlated with\nfrequency of fast food consumption in children and consump-\ntion at an ``American'' restaurant in their parents (42). The\ndegree of acculturation also has been shown to be highly\nassociated with increased risk for obesity. The adjusted odds\n[1.19, 1.67] in women. The effect was even stronger for those\nwho were more highly acculturated (defined using 4 measures of\nlinguistic preference) and persons who had lived in the US for the\nlongest time had the highest BMI (11). Physical activity also is\nlikely to play an important role in weight gain and the develop-\nment of obesity among children and adults (43,44) who are more\nacculturated, due primarily to changes in occupational- and\ntransportation-related physical activity (7).\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, our charac-\nterization of ethnicity did not permit us to examine subgroups of\nother Hispanics (i.e. Dominican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.)\naccurately and the sample size was too small to examine them\nseparately. It is possible that there is considerable heterogeneity\namong these groups that we could not account for in these\nanalyses. Related to this point, due to missing data, we were\nunable to accurately classify generational status (beyond 2nd\ngeneration, due to missing data on parents' place of birth) or\nto assess the level of acculturation using the currently recom-\nmended multidimensional, bidirectional approach (14). Again,\nimportant differences in these groups might exist and warrant\nfurther study.\nDespite these limitations, the present study has several\nstrengths that allow us to fill important gaps in the literature on\nthe topic of acculturation and diet. Specifically related to the use\nFIGURE 1 Mean difference in percent energy intake from various\nn \u00bc 3997) who do and do not speak primarily Spanish in the home.\nValues are predicted mean 6 SEM, n \u00bc 3785.

A notable methodological advantage of this study\nwas our use of modeling strategies that allowed us to account for\nnonconsumers when estimating the effect of ethnicity and\nbirthplace on diet. This is a standard method used in economics,\nbut rarely do nutrition scholars consider this issue, which can bias\nresults (45,46). The marginal effect approach employed in this\nstudy has 2 distinct advantages. First, it accounts for the\nsimultaneity of the probability of consuming a food and the effect\nof consuming in the function that is being estimated. Second, it\ndoes not impose a restriction on the distribution of individual\ncharacteristics or the distribution of food intake. This is essential\nto obtaining unbiased, accurate estimates. Finally, the use of\nbootstrapping allows for the computation of more precise\nmeasures of standard error around these estimates.\nConsidering the well-established link between diet and disease,\nand the increased risk of adverse health outcomes observed in\nmore acculturated Hispanics, this work has important implica-\ntions for the development of culturally and generationally targeted\nnutrition interventions. For example, improving access through\nneighborhood interventions might prove a useful strategy for\nsupporting maintenance or increased consumption of foods that\nhave consistently been found to decrease with the acculturation\nprocess (8).\nIn a recent study of primarily first-generation Latino women,\nmost reported shopping at supermarkets and grocery stores that\ncatered to Mexican clientele with respect to store design and\nitems offered (47). Additionally, women in this study who\nindicated a preference for fast food vs. other restaurants\nidentified distance to the restaurant as one of the most influential\nfactors in determining restaurant choice (47). In a separate\nimmigrant community, low-fat milk represented just a fraction\nof available milk options in smaller grocery stores and super-\nmarkets (48), but consumption increased significantly in this\ncommunity when access to low-fat milk increased in school\ncafeterias (49). Altering access could have potentially positive\nimpacts on healthfulness of the diet.\nWe report that FB and USB Mexicans and other Hispanics\nconsume foods differently both with respect to percent consum-\ning certain food groups and the amounts consumed among\nconsumers. These findings suggest that Hispanic subgroups have\nimportant differences in dietary behaviors that might be\nobscured if they are studied as a single ethnic group. There are\nlikely important interactions between the process of accultura-\ntion and the environment in which this process occurs. Future\nstudies should examine Hispanic subgroups individually and\nseek to identify additional characteristics, beyond birthplace,\nwhich might provide further insight into the differences in health\nbehaviors and health outcomes.\nLiterature Cited\n1.
