These theories predict a gender selectivity effect, such that women should\nbe more selective than men in their mating choices because they bear a greater cost associated\nwith pregnancy and child-rearing. The theories also posit an age differential effect, such that men\nBlind dates and mate preferences\nwill seek mates younger than themselves because younger women are more likely to be fertile;\nwhereas women will seek mates older than themselves because older men typically have greater\neconomic resources and higher social standing, both of which provide greater security for\noffspring.\nThe gender selectivity hypothesis has substantial empirical support. Several studies using\nspeed-dating procedures have demonstrated that women are less likely than men to agree to\nadditional contact after a speed-dating event (Fisman, Iyengar, Kamenica, and Simonson, 2006;\nKurzban and Weeden, 2005; Todd, Penke, Fasolo, and Lenton, 2007). In addition, Townsend and\nWasserman (1998) found that after viewing an attractive opposite-sex photograph, men were\nsignificantly more likely than women to report willingness to go on a date or have sex with the\nperson shown in the photograph. Similarly, Clark and Hatfield (1989) showed that when\nparticipants were approached by research confederates of the opposite sex and asked to go over\nto the confederate's apartment, 69% of men agreed, but only 6% of women agreed; and if asked\nto have sex that evening, 75% of the men agreed, whereas none of the women agreed. These\nfindings have been replicated several times (e.g., Clark, 1990; Gu\u00e9guen, 2011; Voracek,\nHofhansl, and Fisher, 2005). In a study of on-line dating behavior involving nearly 6,000\nparticipants, when individuals viewed an opposite-sex profile, men were one and a half times\nmore likely than women to send an introductory email (Hitsch, Hortacsu, and Ariely, 2010).\nThere is also substantial empirical support for the age differential hypothesis. Buss\n(1989) surveyed 37 cultures across 6 continents and found that in every culture studied, men\nprefer to marry younger women (mean difference = -2.66 years) and women prefer to marry\nolder men (mean difference = 3.42 years). In addition, Buss collected actual age differences at\nmarriage for 27 of the 37 cultures, and in every case, men, on average, married women who were\nyounger than themselves. Buunk and colleagues (2001) queried Dutch men and women between\nthe ages of 20 and 60 about their age preferences for various types of intimate relationship,\nranging from sexual fantasies to marriage. They found that men consistently preferred younger\npartners than did women. Using a nationally representative sample of single Americans younger\nthan 35, Sprecher, Sullivan, and Hatfield (1994) found that women were significantly more\nwilling than men to marry someone who was older by five years; and men were significantly\nmore willing than women to marry someone who was younger by five years. In an analysis of\nover 1,000 personal ads, Wiederman (1993) found that women generally sought men older than\nthemselves; and men generally sought women younger than themselves.\nThe goal of the present study is to test the gender selectivity and age differential\nhypotheses using a new source of data \u00ad blind dates arranged and paid for by newspaper\nmatchmaking columns. Given the fact that blind dates are relatively common in modern life, this\nsource of data has good external validity. In addition, since these are found data, experimenter\nbias is minimized. Although, as noted above, there are many empirical studies supporting these\ntwo hypotheses, this new source of data has the potential to add incrementally to our confidence\nin the robustness of the effects.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe collected all available ratings of blind dates that were published in two American\nnewspaper columns from the inception of each column until November 20, 2011. The two\nnewspaper columns were: \"Dinner with Cupid\" from The Boston Globe and \"Date Lab\" from\nThe Washington Post. Given our hypotheses, we only collected ratings from heterosexual\nBlind dates and mate preferences\ncouples. We also collected the ages of the participants. Both newspaper columns advertise for\nsingles who are willing to provide a narrative report of a blind date along with a quantitative\nrating in exchange for a free dinner at a local restaurant. For the quantitative rating, The Boston\nGlobe used letter grades, which we converted to a numerical scale (F=0 to A+=12); and The\nWashington Post used a 1-5 scale, with higher scores indicating more favorable ratings. The\nnewspapers attempt to match up compatible individuals based on information that the applicants\nprovide in response to an on-line questionnaire (54 items for The Washington Post and 36 items\nfor The Boston Globe). The questionnaires gather information on applicants' age, height,\noccupation, marital status, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity. In addition, applicants respond\nto open-ended items such as dating history, interests, hobbies, activities, and partner preferences.\nOther items ask participants such questions as when they are the happiest, what makes them a\ngood catch, and what is the first thing others notice when they walk into the applicants' homes.\nApplicants must also upload three recent photos. The newspaper columns do not specify the\nmethod by which they combine this information in order to determine which individuals might\nbe compatible.\nResults\nNovember 20, 2011.

We compared the ratings when\nthe man was older than the woman with the ratings when the woman was older than the man.\nCouples who were the same age were excluded from this analysis.

Although not statistically significant, the observed values were in the predicted\ndirection. Male ratings were higher when the man was older than the woman (9.53 vs. 8.98, t(97)\n= 1.38, p = .17, d = .32). Female ratings were also higher when the man was older than the\nWe obtained similar results when we analyzed the age difference as a continuous\nvariable. For each couple, we subtracted the woman' age from the man's age, yielding a variable\nthat was positive if the man was older, negative if the woman was older, and zero if there was no\nage difference. Descriptive statistics for the new variable were as follows: for The Washington\nto 10. The continuous age difference variable was not significantly correlated with ratings of the\ndates. The observed correlations for The Washington Post were negative: r(219) = -.03, p = .68\nfor men and r(219) = -.04, p = .57 for women; whereas the observed correlations for The Boston\nDiscussion\nWe used two independent sources of data from blind dates arranged and paid for by\nnewspaper matchmaking columns to investigate two hypotheses about human mating behavior\nderived from parental investment theory and sexual strategies theory. The first hypothesis is the\ngender selectivity effect, which posits that women should be more selective than men in their\nmating choices. The second hypothesis is the age differential effect; which posits that men\nshould prefer younger women, and women should prefer older men. Our findings strongly\nsupport the first hypothesis. Women were more selective than men in both blind-dating samples\n(i.e., women gave lower ratings of the dates). Our findings were more equivocal regarding the\nsecond hypothesis. The match-makers at both newspapers clearly used the age differential as an\nimportant factor, tending to pair older men with younger women. However, the participants'\nratings of the dates did not conform to the hypothesis, and there were no statistically significant\neffects of the age differential on either male or female ratings of their blind dates.\nThe current study has good ecological validity. Aside from the requirement that\nparticipants provide a narrative report and quantitative rating (an important caveat, as we note\nbelow), the dates proceeded as they would in ordinary life. We would argue that the ecological\nvalidity of the current study is better than laboratory-based research, such as the use of\nconfederates, or asking participants to rate how likely they would be to seek a date based on a\nphotograph or a hypothetical situation. Our study has similar ecological validity to speed-dating\nstudies in that both use relatively common, real-world dating options that involve face-to-face\nBlind dates and mate preferences\nencounters with potential partners. As contrasted with speed-dating studies, the duration of blind\ndates is up to the couple, and daters are free to spend as much (or little) time as they would like\nwith one another. In addition, blind dates involve only the two participants, as opposed to the\npressure of being surrounded by other daters and the personnel running speed-dating events.\nAlthough speed-dating studies can be considered similar to what a person might encounter at a\nbar or party, the many artificial constraints (e.g., every woman must speak with every man and\nvice versa; each encounter is short and of the same duration) reduce their ecological validity.\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, given that the ratings were to be published\nin a newspaper, participants might have been motivated to provide favorable ratings to avoid\nhurting the feelings of their dating partners or to avoid appearing overly harsh in their public\njudgment of others. This limitation could be mitigated in future studies of blind dates by\ncollecting confidential ratings of the date.\nSecond, members of a couple might have discussed their ratings, perhaps even colluding\nto provide similar ratings. These first two limitations, however, are unlikely to explain our\nfindings. For these factors to explain our findings, men would have to have been differentially\ninfluenced by social pressures to provide more favorable ratings. We are unaware of any theory\nthat would predict such an effect; whereas a gender selectivity effect is predicted by parental\ninvestment theory and sexual strategies theory.\nThird, the pool of participants in our samples was self-selecting, and it is possible that the\nwomen and men who volunteered differed systematically in their attractiveness. If the women in\nboth our samples were more attractive than the men, then our findings could be attributable to\nsampling bias.\nFourth, the ecological validity of our samples could be questioned (i.e., to what degree is\nblind dating representative of typical human mating behavior?) However, we would argue that\nblind dates are a common occurrence in modern dating (\"Oh, I know someone who would be just\nperfect for you!\"). Moreover, other sources of data on these questions (e.g., speed-dating,\nanalysis of personal ads, laboratory studies) have their own limitations regarding ecological\nvalidity. Our study can be thought of as adding to the previous literature by way of triangulation.\nThat is, no method has perfect ecological validity, but to the degree that findings converge across\ndifferent methods, one can be more confident of the results.\nFifth, one could argue that blind dates have limited ancestral relevance. Although blind\ndates are relatively common in modern human life, in the small-scale societies that existed\nduring most of human evolution, it is probable that potential mates would have already known\none another. We note, however, that many modern dating contexts, including speed-dating,\ninternet matchmaking services, newspaper personal ads, singles bars, and college mixers are no\nmore ancestrally relevant than blind dates. Moreover, a fundamental assumption of evolutionary\npsychology is that the psychological characteristics that arise in response to evolutionary\npressures continue to influence human behavior in the current day despite substantial differences\nbetween modern life and the conditions faced by humans during most of human evolution.\nSixth, the ratings provided by participants indicated their satisfaction with the blind date\nitself and do not necessarily reflect whether they would agree to a second date. We do think it\nreasonable to expect that these two variables should be positively correlated (i.e., higher\nsatisfaction with the blind date indicates a greater likelihood of agreeing to a second date).\nNevertheless, our study would be improved if participants were asked specifically if they wanted\nto go on a second date. We note that the newspaper matchmaking columns used for this study did\nreport on participants' interest in a second date, but the manner in which this information was\nBlind dates and mate preferences\ncollected was subjective and inconsistent, which prevented us from systematically analyzing the\ndata.\nIn summary, using two independent samples, we found that women tend to provide lower\nratings than men after a blind date. In addition, we found that matchmakers tend to pair younger\nwomen with older men. These findings are consistent with two predictions derived from parental\ninvestment theory and sexual strategies theory: (1) women should be more selective than men in\ntheir mating decisions; and (2) women should prefer older men, and men should prefer younger\nwomen.\nHowever, contrary to the second prediction, we found no evidence of an association\nbetween age differential and ratings of blind dates. This finding suggests that age differential\npreferences may loom large in the abstract (all things being equal, men would prefer younger\nwomen, and women would prefer older men), but in practice, when a couple actually goes on a\ndate, the age differential might not carry as much weight as other factors such as physical\nattractiveness and personality traits.\nOn the other hand, the lack of an age differential effect in our two samples could be due\nto other factors. First, unless the daters revealed their ages to one another during the course of the\ndate, they may not have been aware of the age differential. Second, even if the age differential\nwas perceived by the daters, it is possible that the effect of age differences only becomes salient\nlater in the relationship, after the couple has been on several dates. Third, it is possible that the\nvariance in age differentials in this study was too small to generate a significant effect.\nPresuming that our findings can be replicated, they suggest that the actual age differential\nthat exists in dating and married couples could be a function of a general bias on the part of\nmatchmakers and potential daters that results in many more dating opportunities in which the\nman is older than the woman. Thus, even though couples might be equally happy in relationships\nin which the woman is older than the man (as our data suggest), the matchmaker preference for\nage disparity documented in this study may result in fewer opportunities for such relationships to\nblossom, thus reducing their frequency in the population.\nFuture research on blind dates should seek to replicate these effects and explore this\nhypothesis further. If possible, these studies should collect confidential ratings of the date, as\nwell as willingness to go on a second date. In addition, the matchmakers should be provided only\nwith age ranges (e.g., 30-40) and be required to match up individuals who are in the same age\nbracket. In this way, the dates would include roughly equal numbers of pairs in which either the\nman is older or the woman is older. Prior to going on the dates, participants should be provided\nwith a brief description of their date that includes their partner's age to ensure that the age\ndifferential is known to the participants. The initial questionnaire that is filled out by the\npotential daters should include a question assessing participants' preferences regarding a date's\nage. It would be fascinating if participants' preferences in the abstract are in line with previous\nresearch on the age differential effect, but their ratings of the specific date and their willingness\nto go on a second date show no such age differential effect.\nBlind dates and mate preferences\nReferences\nBuss, D.
