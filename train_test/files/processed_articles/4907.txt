The adaptation paradigm has been used in numerous studies of depth perception for\nmanipulated the viewing distances of adaptation and test stimuli to investigate whether depth\nadaptation to curved surfaces is a second-order disparity-specified or percept-specified shape-\nlevel process. Based on the principle that perceived curvature from certain disparity stimuli is\ndistance dependent, these researchers examined depth aftereffects using four combinations of\n20- and 80-cm viewing distances as adaptor-probe pairs. If the process is disparity specified, a\nchange in the viewing distance between the adaptor and test stimuli will not cause a significant\ndifference in the aftereffects; if the process is a shape-level process, there will be a significant\ndifference. Their experimental results showed that there were significant differences in\naftereffects between pairs that had different adaptor or probe viewing distances, suggesting\nthe distance-dependent process and indicating that shape-level adaptation was involved.\nSimilarly, Berends, Liu, and Schor (2005) examined the mechanism of stereo-slant\nperception based on the principle that percept-specified slant adaptation is viewing distance\ndependent. These researchers fixed the adaptation stimulus at a distance of 57cm and changed\nthe position of the test stimulus to various distances. Results showed that different aftereffects\nwere induced with different viewing distances, suggesting that percept-specified adaptation\noccurred. Both studies therefore demonstrated the shape-level depth adaptation process.\nIn regard to disparity-specified adaptation, Berends and Erkelens (2001) manipulated the\nadapting stimuli to be perceived as a fronto-parallel plane by changing the vertical disparity\nwhile fixing the horizontal disparities and used test stimuli with only horizontal disparity.\nAlthough the perceived adaptation stimuli were fronto-parallel, the test stimuli to be\nperceived as fronto-parallel were significantly different from zero horizontal disparity. These\nresearchers concluded that the disparity per se, not the perceived depth, was adapted by the\nvisual system. Yan and Shigemasu (2015) dynamically changed the location, size, and depth of\nspherical adaptation stimuli and found that both disparity- and percept-specified processes\nwere involved in stereo-curvature adaptation.\nAlthough these studies investigated the disparity or shape-level depth adaption with simple\nstimuli, the relationship of depth adaptation between objects and their components has not\nbeen investigated. In the luminance domain, Georgeson and Shackleton (1994) investigated\nthe thresholds of perceived contrast of luminance-defined gratings and luminance-defined\nplaids and found the perceived contrast of plaids was a nonlinear summation of their\ndifferent-oriented components. In the disparity domain, Hibbard and Langley (1998) used\ndisparity-defined plaids, and their component sinusoidal gratings to detect the slant and\ninclination thresholds, and found that the thresholds of plaids could be predicted by the\nthresholds of their components. Moreover, Bowd, Donnelly, Shorter, and Patterson (2000)\nused two moving square-wave gratings to produce plaid test stimuli and compared the\nadaptation coherence ratio by adapting to plaids and gratings within or across luminance\nand disparity domains. Results showed that there was a cross-domain coherence adaptation,\nwhich meant using moving disparity-defined plaids or their components as adaptor and\nluminance-defined plaids as test stimuli, could cause a certain amount of coherence\naftereffects. This provided evidence for a common underlying mechanism of perceived\nmotion in luminance and disparity domains.\nTyler (1975) demonstrated hierarchical processes of neural adaptation, which involved the\nretinal level luminance adaptation, contrast adaptation, cyclopean depth adaptation, and\nhypercyclopean adaptation. In his study, he used sinusoidal corrugations as stimuli to\ninvestigate the adaptation, but he mainly focused on the disparity-defined hypercyclopean\nadaptation such as tilt or size-related adaptation or the cyclopean depth adaptation of\nsinusoidal corrugation per se. The relationship of depth adaptation between plaids and\ntheir components has not been investigated.\nIn this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between plaids and their component\ngratings within the amounts of depth adaptation. Three experiments were conducted:\nFor Experiments 1 and 2, we used combination of disparity-defined horizontal corrugation\n(marked as horizontal) and disparity-defined plaids as adaptor-probe pairs, and compared the\naftereffects between the horizontal-horizontal pair and the plaid-horizontal pair and the\naftereffects between the horizontal-plaid pair and plaid-plaid pair. The disparity-defined\nplaids are a combination of two orthogonal gratings (horizontally and vertically oriented);\nthus, the peak-to-trough amplitude was doubled after combination. In Experiment 1, we\ncontrolled the plaids that had the same peak-to-trough amplitude as the horizontally\noriented gratings; thus, each component had only half the peak-to-trough amplitude.\nIn Experiment 2, the plaids had double the peak-to-trough amplitude as the horizontally\noriented grating. This meant that each component of plaids had the same peak-to-trough\namplitude as the horizontally oriented gratings. We quantitatively changed the peak-\nto-trough amplitude of the plaids and investigated how the amount of depth aftereffects\nchanged. In Experiment 3, we verified whether differences in depth aftereffects were\ninduced by the adaptors with or without certain surfaces. To do so, we used horizontally\noriented corrugation and noise-shape as adaptors and manipulated the two adaptors that had\nthe same peak-to-trough amplitudes and the same crossed and uncrossed disparities, but the\nnoise-adaptor had randomly distributed disparity dots without a certain surface. In all\nexperiments, we dynamically changed the phase of the stimuli to prevent local slant and\ncurvature adaptation.\nWe hypothesize that either the amount of depth adaptation is linked to cyclopean-oriented\ndepth-from-disparity bandpass filters or it is linked to the peak-to-trough amplitude of the\npooled stimuli. For the former hypothesis, since the plaids consist of two orthogonal gratings\n(the horizontally and vertically oriented gratings), the oriented disparity-defined bandpass\nfilters determine that, in the horizontally oriented test stimulus condition, the horizontally\noriented adaptor or the horizontally oriented component of the plaid adaptor will be\nadapted. In the plaid test stimulus condition, the plaid adaptor will be adapted in the\nplaid-plaid condition, while the horizontally oriented component will be adapted in\nthe horizontal-plaid condition. As a result, in Experiment 1, the half plaid-horizontal\npair and half plaid-half plaid pair will cause smaller amounts of aftereffects than the\nhorizontal-horizontal pair and horizontal-half plaid pair, respectively. In Experiment 2,\nthe plaid-horizontal pair and plaid-plaid pair will cause similar amounts of aftereffects as\nthe horizontal-horizontal pair and horizontal-plaid pairs, respectively. In Experiment 3,\nsince the noise-adaptor was random white noise, which contained multiple spatial\nfrequencies and limited amplitude for each spatial frequency channel, during adaptation,\nonly the channels with similar spatial frequency to the horizontally oriented test stimuli\nwill be adapted. Thus, the noise-horizontal pair will cause less adaptation than the\nhorizontal-horizontal pair. However, if the latter hypothesis is true, in Experiment 1, the\nhalf plaid-horizontal pair and half plaid-half plaid pair will cause similar amounts of\naftereffects as the horizontal-horizontal pair and horizontal-half plaid pair, respectively,\nbecause of the same peak-to-trough amplitude in each comparison pair. In Experiment 2,\nthe plaid-horizontal pair and plaid-plaid pair will cause larger amounts of aftereffects than\nthe horizontal-horizontal pair and horizontal-plaid pair, respectively, because of the larger\namounts of peak-to-trough amplitude in the plaid adaptor.\nHe and Shigemasu 3\nExperiment 1\nMethods\nParticipants. Ten students aged 20 to 35 years (5 men, mean age: 21.7) from Kochi University\nof Technology were recruited as participants. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nNine of them passed the stereo perception and stereo acuity test (less than 1 arcmin) with\nour own program; one male participant had a relatively low score on the stereo acuity test\n(< 50% correct rate) and was excluded from the data analysis. All participants were nai\u00a8ve to\nthe purpose of the experiment. All experiments and procedures were approved by\nthe Research Ethics Committee of Kochi University of Technology and conformed to the\ntenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants prior to experiments.\nApparatus. Visual stimuli were presented on a 22-in. CRT color display (RDF223H;\nThe luminance of the display was measured using a CS-100 A colorimeter (Minolta,\nJapan) and linearized using look-up table method. We created a program using Matlab\n(Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) with PsychToolbox Version 3 to present the experimental\nstimuli (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). During the experiments, participants sat in a dark room\nfronto-parallel to the surface of the display and observed the stimuli via a pair of stereoscopic\nwireless LCD glasses (NuVision 60GX; MacNaughton, Inc., OR, USA). The refresh rate of\nthe LCD glasses was 120 Hz, so the frame rate was 60 Hz for each eye. No flicker was\nreported. A chin rest was used to prevent head movement.\nStimuli. Random dot stereograms with horizontal disparity were used for the stimuli.\nAnti-aliased pseudo-random white dots (29.7 cd/m2) were presented on a gray background\n(9.9 cd/m2). Because of the low contrast and gray background of the stimuli, the cross-talk\neffect was negligible. The dot patterns of the adaptation stimuli were randomly changed every\nAt the center of the display, a nonius fixation with lower part T- and upper part reversed\nT-shape was shown to the left and right eyes separately. To ensure eye vergence, participants\nwere asked to maintain the vertical lines of the two T parts collinearly, and the horizontal\nlines overlapped during the entire experimental procedure. With the correct vergence, the\nnonius was perceived as a cross. The lengths of both the horizontal and vertical lines were\nProcedure. In Experiment 1, we aimed to investigate the relationship of depth adaptation\nbetween disparity-defined plaid pattern and their components. Combinations of horizontally\noriented corrugation and plaids were used as adaptor-probe pairs and the changes in depth\nbetween horizontal-horizontal and plaid-horizontal pairs were compared as the horizontally\noriented test stimulus condition (Figure 1(a)), and the changes in depth between plaid-plaid and\nhorizontal-plaid pairs as the plaid test stimulus condition (Figure 1(b)). The plaids are the\ncombination of two orthogonal gratings; thus, the amplitude (of the disparity between\npeak and trough) will be doubled when the two orthogonal components are linearly added\nup. To control for plaids with the same peak-to-trough amplitude as the horizontal\ncorrugation, we defined the amplitudes of the horizontally and vertically oriented\ncomponents as half the amplitude of the horizontal corrugation. To differentiate the plaids\nused here with those used in Experiment 2, we used the term half plaid in Experiment 1 to\nrepresent the plaid stimuli.\nFigure 1. A schematic representation of the test procedure in Experiment 1. (a) The horizontally oriented\ntest stimulus condition and (b) half plaid test stimulus condition. In all conditions, both adaptors were\npresented for 6 s. After a 0.5-s time interval during which a blank gray background was displayed, the test\nstimulus was presented on one side, and a comparison stimulus was presented on the other side for 0.5 s\nsimultaneously. The comparison stimulus had a fixed amplitude (12.1 arcmin), whereas the test stimulus had\nnine levels of amplitudes (9.1\u00ad15.2 arcmin with constant intervals) and were presented in a random order.

In each condition, both adaptors were presented for 6 s. After a\n0.5-s time interval that included exposure to a blank gray background, the test stimulus\nwas presented on one side, and the comparison stimulus was presented on the other side\nfor 0.5 s simultaneously. The comparison stimulus had a fixed amplitude (12.1 arcmin),\nwhereas the test stimulus had nine levels of amplitudes (9.1\u00ad15.2 arcmin with constant\nintervals) and were presented in a random order.

After participants made their choice, the next trial was triggered automatically.\nIn the large-small adaptor condition, after adaptation, the side with the large-amplitude\nadaptor should cause the amplitude of the probe to appear smaller than the actual value,\nwhereas the side with a small-amplitude adaptor should cause the amplitude of the probe to\nTable 1.

Thus, there will be a perceptual shift. In contrast, in the medium-sized\namplitude adaptor condition, the two adaptors have the same amplitudes, which cause the\nsame adaptation effects of the test stimuli and therefore will not induce a perceptual shift.\nBefore the experiment, participants were trained by using our own practice program.\nIn practice trials, the adaptation step was eliminated to avoid any potential influence on\nthe experimental results, and only the test stimuli were shown. Feedback on correctness was\ngiven to participants to give them insight on their own perception. There were 36 practice\ntrials for each stimulus type.\nDuring the experiment, stimuli were presented with two combinations of adaptor-probe\npairs in each test stimulus condition (i.e., horizontal-horizontal and half plaid-horizontal\npairs as the horizontal test stimulus condition, and half plaid-half plaid and horizontal-\nhalf plaid pairs as the half plaid test stimulus condition) and three adaptation-amplitude\ntypes (large-, medium-sized, and small-amplitude adaptation conditions). For each condition,\nthere were 216 trials to produce 8 repeats at each test point. Different conditions were block\ndesigned and divided into six sessions that were implemented on different days. In each\nsession, blocks were presented subsequently with a 2-min break between each block.\nAll the blocks were counterbalanced within and between subjects.\nResults\nStimuli were presented with four combinations of adaptor-probe pairs and three adapting-\namplitude types. Figure 2 shows the sigmoidal curves as a psychometric function fitted with\nthe average data of nine participants by using the generalized linear fitting method (Kingdom\n& Prins, 2010) and the Matlab program (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).\nIn the horizontally oriented test stimulus condition as shown in Figure 2(a), the left and\nright panels show the horizontal-horizontal and half plaid-horizontal adaptor-probe\nconditions, respectively, and in the half plaid test stimulus condition as shown in\nFigure 2(b), the left and right panels show the half plaid-half plaid and horizontal-half\nplaid adaptor-probe conditions, respectively. In all figures, the horizontal axis represents\nthe normalized amplitude of test stimulus, which is calculated by Depth of test stimulus\nDepth of comparison stimulus\nwith the depth parameters shown in Table 1. The vertical axis represents the ratio\nperceived to be the larger depth amplitude. Since the test and comparison stimuli were\npresented randomly after the large or small adaptors in each trial, we separated those\ntrials with test stimuli after the large adaptor from those after the small adaptor; then for\neach amplitude level of test stimuli (nine levels in total), we calculated the ratio perceived to\nbe a larger depth amplitude than the comparison stimulus. After this calculation, we obtained\nthe results for the three adapting conditions separately. Each test stimulus point was repeated\neight times for each participant. The average values of the ratio perceived to be larger depth\namplitude after adapting to large-, medium-sized, and small-amplitude adaptors are shown\nby circle, triangle, and cross symbols, respectively.

The fitted curves showed that there were shifts among the large-,\nmedium-sized, and small-amplitude adapting conditions in each adaptor-probe pair.\nThe 50% point on the fitted psychometric function, namely, point of subjective equality\n(PSE), was obtained for each participant by calculating the horizontal-axis value (as amplitude\nratio of test stimulus to comparison stimulus) which corresponded to 0.5 of the vertical-axis value\n(this was also the ratio perceived to be the larger depth amplitude) in each condition as shown in\nFigure 2 and then subtracting 1 to get the PSE shift accordingly.

In Experiments 1 and 2, we manipulated different peak-\nto-trough amplitudes of adaptors and test stimuli to investigate whether the peak-to-trough\namplitude or the component of the plaid was relevant to the adaptation effect. In Experiment 1,\nFigure 9. The PSE shift in Experiment 3. Significant differences in adaptation amplitude (large, medium-\nsized, and small-amplitude adapting conditions) were found in both adaptation conditions. Significant\ndifferences of depth adaptation were also noted between the two adaptation conditions in both large- and\nsmall-amplitude adapting conditions but not in medium-sized amplitude adapting condition.\nPSE \u00bc point of subjective equality.\nwe examined the depth aftereffects between horizontal-horizontal and half plaid-horizontal\npairs and also between half plaid-half plaid and horizontal-half plaid pairs. Results showed\nsignificant differences in the depth aftereffects of each comparison. In Experiment 2, we\ninvestigated the depth aftereffects between horizontal-horizontal and plaid-horizontal pairs\nand also between plaid-plaid and horizontal-plaid pairs. Results showed no significant\ndifferences in the depth aftereffects of each comparison.\nIn regard to the disparity and shape-level depth adaptation, previous studies (Berends\net al., 2005; Domini et al., 2001) used viewing distance dependency to distinguish whether\nthe adaptation was a shape-level process. In our study, we did not manipulate the different\nviewing distances of the adaptation and test stimuli but changed the peak-to-trough\namplitudes of the plaid stimuli. This might cause a change in perception in both disparity\nand shape levels, since the average crossed or uncrossed disparities, and also the perceived\nshapes (curvatures) of the plaids, were changed at different plaid amplitudes, thus causing\ndifferent changes in depth aftereffects. In addition, as the gratings were components of plaids,\nit was difficult to differentiate the gratings (or components of the plaids) based on shape or to\ndemonstrate the disparity or shape-level depth adaptation; we could not identify what\npercent was caused by disparity versus the percent caused by the shape-level process.\nHowever, from a cyclopean depth adaptation view, these results might indicate that depth\nadaptation was linked to cyclopean-oriented depth-from-disparity bandpass filters, as our\nfirst hypothesis predicts, and the amount of depth adaptation is determined by the relevance\nof amplitudes between the adaptation and test stimuli in each channel. In the horizontally\noriented test stimulus condition, the horizontal adaptor or the horizontally oriented\ncomponents of the plaid adaptor were adapted to the horizontal test stimuli.\nIn Experiment 1, the horizontally oriented components of half plaids had half the peak-\nto-trough amplitude (20.2/2 \u00bc 10.1 arcmin in the large-amplitude adaptor and\n4.1/2 \u00bc 2.05 arcmin in the small-amplitude adaptor conditions) of the horizontally\ncorrugated adaptor. The 10.1 to 2.05 arcmin in the large-small adaptation pair (half plaid-\nhorizontal adaptor-probe condition) caused less aftereffects than the 20.2 to 4.1 arcmin in the\nlarge-small adaptation pair (horizontal-horizontal adaptor-probe condition) when using\n12.1 arcmin as the amplitude of the test stimuli. However, in Experiment 2, the\nhorizontally oriented components of plaids had the same peak-to-trough amplitude\n(20.2 arcmin with the large-amplitude adaptor and 4.1 arcmin with the small-amplitude\nadaptor) as that of the horizontally oriented adaptor and thus caused a similar amount of\ndepth adaptation. Similarly, in the half plaid-half plaid test stimulus condition in Experiment\n1, the adaptor and probe had the same shape and same components (20.2 arcmin with the\nlarge-amplitude adaptor and 4.1 arcmin with the small-amplitude adaptor), and thus the\namount of depth adaptation was similar to the horizontal-horizontal pair. However, for\nthe horizontal-half plaid pair in Experiment 1, the horizontally oriented components in\nhalf plaids had half the peak-to-trough amplitude (10.1 arcmin with the large-amplitude\nadaptor and 2.05 arcmin with the small-amplitude adaptor). This may have caused a\nsmaller change in depth aftereffect when comparing using the horizontally oriented\nadaptor. However, in the horizontal-plaid pair in Experiment 2, the horizontally oriented\ncomponent of the plaid adaptor had the same peak-to-trough amplitude as the horizontally\noriented adaptor and thus caused a similar amount of depth aftereffects. Meanwhile, based\non earlier results, we also disproved the second hypothesis, namely, that the amount of depth\nadaptation was linked to the peak-to-trough amplitude of the pooled stimuli.\nIn Experiment 3, we compared the aftereffects between noise-horizontal and horizontal-\nhorizontal pairs, and the results showed a significant difference in depth adaptation between\nthese two pairs. The noise-adaptor was random white noise, which contained multiple spatial\nfrequencies and limited amplitude for each spatial frequency channel. During adaptation,\nonly the channels with similar spatial frequency to the horizontally oriented test stimuli were\nadapted and thus caused a much smaller depth adaptation when compared with the\nhorizontally oriented adaptor.\nPrevious studies (Tyler, 1975; Tyler & Kontsevich, 1995) demonstrated the hierarchical\nprocesses of neural adaptation and used sinusoidal corrugations to examine the cyclopean\ndepth aftereffect. However, these studies did not investigate the relationship of depth\nadaptation between plaids and gratings. In this study, we compared the cyclopean depth\naftereffects between different peak-to-trough amplitudes of plaids and gratings and found\nthat depth adaptation was linked to cyclopean-oriented depth-from-disparity bandpass\nfilters. Furthermore, the amount of depth adaptation was determined by the relevance of\namplitudes between the adaptation and test stimuli in each channel.\n"
