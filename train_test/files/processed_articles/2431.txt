    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe examine the moderating role of friendship and school network characteristics in\nrelationships between 1) youths' friends smoking behavior and youths' own\ngeneralized expectancies regarding risk and future orientation and 2) generalized\nexpectancies of youths' friends and youths' own generalized expectancies. We\nthen relate these constructs to smoking. Using a longitudinal sample from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N515,142), the relationship\nbetween friends' generalized expectancies and youths' expectancies is stronger for\nthose more central in the network, with more reachability, or stronger network ties,\nand weaker for those with denser friendship networks. Risk expectancies exhibited\nan inverted U shaped relationship with smoking at the next time point, whereas\nfuture orientation expectancies displayed a nonlinear accelerating negative\nrelationship. There was also a feedback effect in which smoking behavior led to\nhigher risk expectancies and lower future orientation expectancies in instrumental\nvariable analyses.\n",
