The\nconflation of these terms has contributed to the problem and resulted in stereotypes\nthat blend religion, culture, and geography to create a monolithic image of women\nZahedi 2011). This image has been consequential. It has fueled apprehension that\nArabs and Muslims are antithetical to American ideals of egalitarianism and\ndemocracy, unable to integrate into American society, and beholden to religious\nand cultural beliefs that are at odds with American ones (Bail 2012; Read 2008).\nFor example, a nationally representative study conducted in 2003 found that\nAmericans ranked Muslims second only to atheists as a group that did not share\ntheir vision for American society (Edgell et al. 2006). Fast forward 10 years, and\nnationwide polls continue to find that many Americans fear that Muslims are inca-\npable of assimilating (Pew Research Center 2011).\nHowever, the extent to which concerns over Arab and Muslim integration\nand stereotypes of Arab and Muslim women resonate with reality remains less\nwell known. This study aims to address this question by examining gender differ-\nences in Arab Muslim voluntary and civic engagement,1 key indicators of inte-\ncontribution of the study is the use of a large, nationally representative data set\non Arab Muslims that contains rich information on the key outcomes in question\nand on religion and religiosity--factors believed to hinder their integration, par-\nticularly that of women. The analysis draws on survey data from the Georgetown\nUniversity's Muslim Americans in Public Spaces (MAPS) project to address\nthree related questions: (1) to what extent are Arab Muslims involved in various\ncommunity organizations?; (2) to what degree does this differ for men and\nwomen?; and (3) to what extent do different dimensions of religious identity in-\nfluence their participation?\nBelow, I situate these questions in the larger literature on immigrant assimi-\nlation, discuss the significance of civic engagement as a measure of integration,\nand provide data on U.S. civic engagement to serve as a basis of comparison for\nArab Muslims. I then review the theoretical importance of religion for civic en-\ngagement and highlight its substantive importance for understanding the Arab\nMuslim case. Drawing on past studies, I offer competing hypotheses for Arab\nMuslim civic engagement and test them with nationally representative data. The\narticle concludes by discussing implications for scholarship on gender, religion,\nand immigrant integration, in general, and for Arab Muslims, in particular.\n1The data contain eight categories of organizations within and outside of the Muslim\ncommunity: school/youth programs; arts/cultural organizations; neighborhood/community\ngroups; organizations for poor/elderly/needy; professional organizations; trade/labor unions;\nveteran's/military organizations; and ethnic organizations.\nHow does one go about determining the degree of an ethnic or religious\ngroup's integration in a society as increasingly heterogeneous as the United\nStates? Some scholars focus on economic success, others look at intermarriage\npatterns, while others still emphasize the importance of political mobilization\n(for a review, see Portes and Rumbaut 2006). This study focuses on civic engage-\nment because community involvement is arguably one of the oldest forms of\nparticipation in American society and often viewed as a critical measure of immi-\n2007).

Although there has been a slight decline in participation rates over the\npast few decades, recent data suggest a rebound, with the number of volunteers in\nthe   (64.3 million) reaching its highest level in five years and\nnearly half (44.1 percent) of all Americans participating in civic, religious, and/\nor school organizations (Corporation for National and Community Service\nSome contend these activities are far more significant to American citizen-\nship than other measures of integration because they require conscious, concert-\ned effort that goes beyond merely taking part in American popular culture\namong immigrants, many of whom originate from countries where support for\ncivic engagement is either lower than in the   or discouraged alto-\nits relationship to democracy-building; it is seen as a critical means to develop in-\ndividuals' abilities to participate in the social, economic, and political realms. As\nGam and Putnam (2001:173) state, \". . . no aspect of American democracy has\nbeen more celebrated than the long-standing proclivity of Americans to join vol-\nuntary associations.\"\nNowhere is this proclivity more pronounced than in the arena of religion. In\none of the most comprehensive analyses of religion and public life, Putnam and\nCampbell (2010) find that religious Americans are more generous with their\ntime and money than secular ones. Studies of church-going Protestants and\nother Christian groups similarly find that religion has a stronger influence on vol-\nunteering behavior than any other factor, including education, income, and age\ntionship between religion and civic engagement in terms of capital accumula-\ntion, pointing out that religious activities are a form of cultural capital that\nencourages the acquisition of additional capital--capital that can be acquired\nthrough civic engagement (Putnam and Campbell 2010). Others see participa-\ntion in religious organizations as offering individuals access to social networks\nimmigrant groups, civic engagement can be a useful tool for securing and ad-\nvancing the rights of their communities, and immigrant congregations are an im-\nportant location where these skills are crafted (Kniss and Numrich 2007). Two\nlarge studies of religion and immigrant integration found that congregations pro-\nmoted the civic involvement of their members as a mechanism to combat cultur-\nal dissonance and manage the demands of competing citizenship identities\nposite, with immigrant congregations dampening civic engagement by reinforc-\ning prior socialization experiences in the home country that discouraged public\nAlthough there have been numerous studies on the civic engagement of\nvarious U.S. immigrant and religious groups, very few have concentrated on\nArab Muslim case is an interesting one for several reasons. Substantively, the\nquestion of integration permeates the majority of public and political discourse\non Arab and Muslim communities but remains understudied empirically. This is\npartly due to population size and dispersion; estimates of Arabs in America range\nfrom 1 to 3 million, with roughly half being of Muslim heritage and half of\nEastern Christian descent. Estimates of Muslims in America range anywhere\nfrom 2 to 8 million, with a large portion being of South Asian (not Arab)\ndescent (Read 2008). This puts the Arab Muslim population somewhere\nbetween 1.5 and 2 million--a mere 0.008 percent of the total U.S. population.\nArab Muslims are also residentially dispersed throughout major U.S. metropoli-\ntan areas, making them hard to identify, less accessible to researchers, and diffi-\ncult to capture in national-level data.\nThese factors also contribute to the fact that public sentiment toward\nMuslims has remained fairly negative and surprisingly stable in the decade fol-\nlowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks--a decade that has seen the emergence of a\nwell-organized and vocal Islamophobia movement (Bail 2012; Bakalian and\nBozorgmehr 2009). Intergroup contact is one of the most effective methods for\ncountering stereotypes, and many Americans have either not interacted with a\nMuslim or not known an individual was Muslim during the interaction.2 The\nresult has been a general lack of understanding about Islam and Muslims and a\nsense of unease with their presence in the  . Nationwide polls find\nthat 59 percent of Americans believe that Islam is very different from their own\nreligion, even though 66 percent admit that they know very little or nothing\nabout Islam (Pew Research Center 2006). Because some Arab Muslim women\n2Personal communication with Muslim professionals over the past decade (e.g., doctors,\ndentists, lawyers), many of whom say their clients rarely know they are Muslim.\nchoose to wear the hijab (for cultural and religious reasons), anti-Muslim senti-\nment often seems to focus on them, depicting them as oppressed, uneducated,\nsentiments have not gone unnoticed by Muslim Americans: a majority (53\npercent) report that it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United\nStates since 9/11, and most (55 percent) believe that the government singles out\nMuslims for increased surveillance and monitoring (Pew Research Center 2011).\nArab Muslims have felt especially vulnerable, in part because the 9/11 acts were\ncarried out by Arab Muslims and the subsequent U.S. war on terror focused on\nIraq as much as Afghanistan. Arab Muslims have also had a long history dealing\nwith anti-Arab stereotypes in the west, many of which continue to be used by\nanti-Muslim organizations to amplify their Islamophobic messages (Bail 2012;\nTogether, these figures signal an environment that may create obstacles to\ncommunity engagement for Arab Muslims, yet little is known about their actual\nlevels of engagement. In addition, very little is known about women's civic en-\ngagement relative to men's. We know that women in the   generally\nprovide more help to others and are more charitable with their time and money\nwhen compared with men (Mesch et al. 2006). Existing studies on Arab Muslims\nsuggest potentially different patterns and offer competing hypotheses for women's\npublic sphere engagement. On the one hand, gender traditionalism and sex-role\ndifferentiation is much more pronounced in Arab and Muslim countries, and\nwomen's participation in the public realm is relatively low throughout the\nMiddle East, which may translate to the U.S. context (Read 2004). Women's\nprimary responsibility is to the family and the home, and they are held account-\nable for upholding family honor through chastity and modesty. As such, Arab\nMuslim women in the  , especially immigrant women, may lack the\nknowledge, experience, resources, and/or desire to participate in the public\nrealm. In this scenario, we might expect Arab Muslim women to have low levels\nof civic involvement, or at minimum, lower levels than Arab Muslim men.\nIn contrast, there are numerous reasons to expect Arab Muslim women to\nhave high levels of civic engagement, or at least levels that equal their male\ncounterparts. First, research in the   and other western democracies\nconsistently finds that women tend to be more charitable and donate more time\nand money than do their male counterparts, regardless of the charitable activity\nor organization in question and net of other background factors that might influ-\nence their behaviors, such as education, income, and age (Mesch et al. 2006;\nPiper and Schnepf 2008). Explanations for these patterns point to childhood\nsocialization, where girls are rewarded for being nurturing while boys are admon-\nished for the same behaviors. For Arab Muslims, this may translate into greater\nfemale participation in community activities to build the family's social and cul-\ntural capital (Read and Oselin 2008). Studies also find a stronger association\nbetween religion and civic engagement for U.S. women than U.S. men, in part\nbecause women on average are more religiously active than men (Bekkers and\nWiepking 2011). In the Middle East context, Muslim men are far more active and\ninvolved in the mosque than are women; women either do not attend the mosque\nat all or they stay in a separate area away from the men and Imam. In the United\nStates, however, women are much more involved in the mosque because it plays a\ncentral role in the economic, social, and cultural adaptation of the immigrant com-\nSecond, research on U.S. immigrant communities finds high rates of civic\nengagement among women, which may also be the case for Arab Muslims. For\nexample, Terriquez (2012) finds that immigrant Latina mothers are just as civi-\ncally engaged as U.S.-born white mothers and their U.S.-born Latina counter-\nparts once differences in socioeconomic status are considered. Socioeconomic\nstatus is critical because immigrants who are more highly educated and affluent\nare better able to navigate in the unfamiliar surroundings of the host country and\novercome obstacles to civic engagement (Brettell and Reed-Danahay 2012;\nPortes and Rumbaut 2006). This may be especially important for understanding\nthe Arab Muslim case, since a large majority migrated to the   as\nskilled professionals or as university students sent abroad by their affluent families\nOn the other hand, past research on Arab-American women has found that\nhigh levels of educational attainment do not necessarily translate into outcomes\nthat are typically found among other groups of women with high attainment\nlevels (Read 2004). For example, the well-established positive relationship\nbetween education and employment among U.S. women is much less evident for\nArab Americans, in part because they view education as a resource to be used in\nthe home instead of the labor market (Read and Cohen 2007; Read and Oselin\n2008). This may also be the case for civic engagement if Arab Muslim women\n(and men) feel that civic engagement detracts from their familial responsibilities.\nOne study suggests mixed evidence on this point, with some Muslim women re-\ntreating from civic life in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and others embracing\nit as a way to challenge negative perceptions of their communities (Zahedi\n2011). Whether or how different aspects of religious identity factored into these\npatterns is unclear, which brings us to a final critical component in analyzing\nArab Muslim civic engagement.\nSpecifically, there are distinct dimensions of Muslim religious identity that\nmay either encourage or suppress Muslim participation in western civil societies.\nRead (2007) provides a useful typology in her work on religion and political par-\nticipation by identifying subjective, organizational, and political dimensions of\nMuslim identity. The subjective dimension refers to the more internalized, person-\nal aspects of religious beliefs; the organizational dimension captures more external\ninvolvement in the mosque and mosque-related activities; and the political di-\nmension refers to attitudes regarding whether or not the Imam and mosque should\nvocalize views on politics. Each of these dimensions may be positively or nega-\ntively associated with civic engagement depending on the specific interpretation\nof Islamic teachings. Islam literally means \"a strong commitment to God,\" and\nlike many faith traditions, is a lived religion that requires daily practice and com-\ndefined by the sharia, requires that Muslims engage in consistent religious prac-\ntice and adherence to behavioral expectations that are collectively referred to as\nthe five pillars of Islam (Denny 2010). The pillars include: (1) shahada, declaring\nthere is no god except God (Allah) and Muhammad is God's messenger; (2) salat,\nritual prayer five times a day; (3) sawm, fasting and self-control during the holy\nmonth of Ramadan; (4) zakat, giving 2.5 percent of one's savings to the poor and\nneedy; and (5) hajj, pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if at all possi-\nble. However, similar to other religious traditions, there is a great deal of varia-\ntion in the degree to which Muslims enact this idealized version of Islam, ranging\nfrom the most devout to those who are Muslim in name only.\nSuch diversity suggests opposing possibilities for the relationship between re-\nligiosity and Muslim American civic engagement. On the one hand, individuals\nwith strong personal connections to Islamic values may be more civically\nengaged, as may those who are involved in organized mosque activities where\nthey are surrounded by like-minded individuals reinforcing these values and en-\ncouraging engagement. Muslims who favor the engagement of their mosques and\nmosque leaders in politics may also be more civically active, as past research on\nother ethno-religious communities finds that the more politicized the leadership,\nthe more civically engaged its members (Foley and Hoge 2007). On the other\nhand, there are divergent interpretations of the sharia by Muslim clergy and\nongoing debates regarding the extent to which Muslims should engage in\nfrom participating in non-Muslim organizations because they argue that doing so\nwould result in the adoption of immoral beliefs and practices (e.g., drinking, pre-\nmarital/nonmarital sex, excessive mixing of genders) and loss of religious purity.\nOthers contend that civic engagement is an essential part of a Muslim's duty to\nthe umma, or global community (Denny 2010). Religious views on appropriate\ngender relations in the west are also contested. Strict interpretations of Islamic\nscripture allot men control over the public sphere and ordain women to the\nhome and family, while more progressive ones promote a more equal gender divi-\nsion of labor to meet the social and economic realities of daily life (Read 2004).\nAs such, religious orthodoxy could either discourage or encourage civic engage-\nment. If individuals follow strict interpretations that prohibit active involvement\nin non-Muslim institutions, then they will be less likely to participate in civic\nlife. In contrast, Islamic principles can also be interpreted in ways that promote,\neven require, community involvement. For example, in his book on environmen-\ntal activism, Abdul-Matin (2010) argues that protecting the planet is deeply em-\nbedded in the Muslim tradition and a duty of Muslims to do so.\nIn sum, there are competing theories regarding the extent to which Arab\nMuslims are engaged in American civic life. The literature on women's participa-\ntion is even less clear, and the degree to which religion factors into the equation\nis relatively unknown. As described above, there is a great deal of heterogeneity\nin how Muslims live out Islam, which may differentially shape their civic partici-\npation. Accordingly, the analysis sets out to examine these issues systematically,\nfocusing on the following three questions: (1) to what extent are Arab Muslims\nengaged in civic life?; (2) to what degree does this vary for men and women?; and\n(3) to what extent do different dimensions of Islam influence their participation?\nMETHODS\nData\nThe analysis draws on data from two national telephone surveys of Muslim\nAmericans conducted in the aftermath of 9/11. The surveys were administered by\nUniversity's Project MAPS: Muslim Americans in Public Spaces. Phone interviews\nwere conducted with persons nationwide who were 18 years or older and who iden-\ntified themselves as Muslim. The telephone list was created by matching the zip\ncodes of 300 randomly selected Islamic centers against their respective local tele-\nphone exchanges. Listings of common Muslim surnames were then identified from\nthe local telephone exchanges to create the sampling frame. The margin of sam-\npling error for each survey is +2.3 percent. This study focuses specifically on Arab\na combined sample size of 1,156. The data sets are combined due to the small\nsample sizes of Arabs in each of the separate files. Ancillary analysis finds similar\nresults when the regression models are run on each of the data sets separately, and\nmerging them makes the findings more robust.\nThere are several advantages to using the survey data. First, they are immensely\nvaluable given the lack of national information on Muslim Americans; most na-\ntional data sets contain too few Muslims for meaningful analysis (e.g., General\nSocial Survey) or do not contain questions on religion (e.g., U.S. Census). The\nlack of such data has limited our knowledge to case studies of Muslim American\ncommunities, which, while useful, have obscured the diversity that characterizes\nthis group because concentrated communities tend to be more homogeneous than\nthe population at large with respect to nativity, religiosity, socioeconomic status,\nand other characteristics known to influence civic engagement. Second, although\nthe survey data have been used to produce informative reports, few studies have\nused them to systematically analyze the experiences of Arab Muslims on several\nimportant outcomes. Third, although the data are becoming a bit dated, they\nremain one of the only sources for systematic analysis of Muslim American experi-\nence. There have been more recent polls conducted by the Pew Research Center,\nbut these do not contain the depth and breadth of information included in the\nMAPS surveys, nor are they publicly available for analysis.\nMeasures\nThe primary dependent variable is civic engagement. Similar to past re-\nsearch, I use a scaled item that combines responses (1, yes; 0, no) to eight secular\ncommunity activities (Howard et al. 2005). Specifically, respondents were asked\nif they had ever donated time, money, or been an officer at any of the following:\n(1) school or youth programs (such as day-care centers, PTA, scouts, or little\nleague); (2) arts or cultural organization (such as public TV stations, museums);\n(3) neighborhood, civic, or community group (such as a block club, neighbor-\nhood watch); (4) organization to help the poor, sick, elderly, or homeless; (5)\nprofessional organization; (6) trade or labor unions; (7) veteran's or military\nservice organization; and (8) ethnic organization. The scale ranges from 0 to 8\nwith a mean score of 3.2 and Cronbach's a of 0.714, demonstrating a high level\nof internal consistency and inter-item validity. In addition to the scale, the anal-\nysis also includes an examination of gender differences in specific community\nactivities. In ancillary analyses not shown here, I also parse out differences by\ntype of involvement (e.g., donating time versus donating money) and found sub-\nstantively similar results and/or too few cases for meaningful analyses.\nThe primary independent variables are gender (1, female; 0, male) and religi-\nosity. Following past research, I separate religiosity into three components that\ntap distinct aspects of religious identity (Read 2007). The first component is sub-\njective religious identity, which is measured with three variables that are combined\ninto a scale (importance of religion in daily life, frequency of prayer, and impor-\ntance of Islam). The scale that has a high internal validity (Cronbach's a \u00bc\n0.709) and is coded to represent high religiosity. The second component is politi-\ncal religious identity, which is gauged with two dummy variables that measure fa-\nvorability toward mosques expressing views on politics and toward religious\nleaders discussing politics and political candidates in the mosque (1, strongly\nfavor/favor; 0, all else). The final component is organizational religious identity,\nwhich is measured with two dummy variables that tap the degree of mosque par-\nticipation (1, attend mosque once a week or more; 0, all else; 1, very involved in\nmosque activities; 0, all else).\nPast research indicates that community involvement is also related to indi-\nvidual characteristics such as age, education, and socioeconomic status. Age and\neducation enhance one's civic skills, social connections, and civic values,\nthereby increasing the likelihood of civic participation (Mesch et al. 2006).\nLikewise, income increases one's ability to donate money and time due to wealth\nand greater flexibility in leisure time. Therefore, the models control for age (in\nyears), education (Bachelor's degree and higher, 1; less than Bachelor's degree, 0),\nNativity is also known to influence civic engagement, with newer immigrants\ntypically having less time to invest in the accumulation of social capital than\nnative-born Americans or immigrants with longer duration of residency (Gerstle\nand Mollenkopf 2001). Thus, I include three variables to compare immigrants\nwith different durations of U.S. residency with native-born Arab Muslims (less\nthan 10 years, 10\u00ad19 years, and 20 years and greater). Finally, the analysis includes\na measure of political consciousness to account for the possibility that political\nmobilization among Arab Muslims in the post-9/11 era may be contributing to\ninvolvement in other community activities as well (Jamal and Naber 2008).\nPolitical consciousness is measured with four items: (1) importance of participat-\ning in politics; (2) importance of children participating in politics; (3) frequency\nof discussing politics with family and friends; and (4) degree to which govern-\nment and public affairs are followed. These items are combined into a political\nconsciousness scale ranging from 2 to 10, with high internal validity (Cronbach's\nRESULTS\nGender Differences in Arab Muslim Civic Engagement\nThe analysis first determines the degree to which Arab Muslim men and\nwomen differ in their civic engagement and then examines possible factors that\nmight explain observed differences. Table 1 shows that Arab Muslims are highly\nengaged in their communities, particularly in programs to help the young, the\nelderly, or the homeless--groups who are most often in need. Over one-half are\ninvolved in school and youth programs and nearly three-fourths are involved in\norganizations for the needy--figures that mirror those found in the broader U.S.\npopulation (Corporation for National and Community Service 2012). These\nnumbers are not driven by men's participation alone: women have similar overall\nlevels of participation and do not differ significantly from men in three of the\neight categories of organizations (those that help the needy; ethnic organizations;\nand veteran's/military organization). However, they do differ in arenas where we\nmight expect to find gender to matter, namely in professional, trade, and civic/\nneighborhood organizations where women participate less, and in school/youth\norganizations where they participate more.\nTable 1 next examines factors that might account for similarities and dif-\nferences in men's and women's civic engagement, namely religiosity, socioeco-\nnomic status, and demographic characteristics, all of which are known to\ncontribute to the civic engagement of Americans more generally. Looking first at\nreligion, we see that women appear more religious than men in terms of the sub-\njective or personal dimensions of religiosity: they are more likely to pray five\ntimes daily, to believe that religion is very important, and to say that Islam is a\nsalient force in their daily lives. In terms of the more organized dimensions of re-\nligious identity, we see that men and women are more similar except in terms of\nmosque attendance. Men are twice as likely as women to attend the mosque\nmore than once per week (23.2 compared with 11.2 percent), which in part re-\nflects the fact that men are technically incumbent to attend Friday prayers and\nare much more likely to do so than women in their home countries (Margoliouth\n2003). However, men and women engage in other mosque activities at roughly\nthe same rate, with 9.4 and 9.6 percent saying they are \"very involved\" on a\nweekly basis. With respect to political dimensions of religiosity, men and women\nare similar in their opinions on mosques expressing views on politics (57.1 and\n60.3 percent think they should, respectively) but differ in their beliefs on the role\nof Imams. Here, men are significantly more likely (45.3 percent) than women\n(38.4 percent) to say that Imams should be allowed to discuss politics at the\nmosque. This may translate into higher rates of engagement for men, given the\nWomen\nMen\nCivic engagement\nOrganization to help the poor, sick, elderly, or\nhomeless\nReligiosity\nSubjective religiosity\nRole of Islam very important in guiding daily life 82.2 71.2 **\nOrganizational religiosity\nVery involved in mosque activities 9.4 9.6 NS\nPolitical religiosity\nImams should be allowed to discuss politics at\nmosque\nBackground factors\nPolitical consciousness scale (mean scores, ranges\nx2 indicates significant differences at p  .1; *p  .05; **p  .01; NS, not significant.\nwell-established relationship between support for politicized leadership and civic\nengagement among other groups (Foley and Hoge 2007).\nIn terms of background factors, men are older, slightly more likely to be im-\nmigrants to the   and more likely to have a longer duration of U.S.\nresidency, in part due to social and economic factors that send men ahead of\nwomen in the migration process.

Table 2 (column A) examines this relationship in the multivariate\ncontext using the scaled measure of civic engagement as the primary outcome.\nModel 1 shows that women (20.109) are slightly less engaged in civic activities\nthan men, net of differences in age and immigrant status, which should be ex-\npected, given the descriptive statistics in table 1.

Here, we see varying degrees\nof association depending on the dimension of religious identity in question.\nSpecifically, subjective religiosity is not significantly associated with civic en-\ngagement, while organizational religiosity increases the likelihood of being civi-\ncally active. Although political religiosity appears to be insignificant for civic\nengagement, ancillary analyses finds that it operates by increasing political con-\nsciousness, which, in turn, encourages civic engagement. The fact that the more\npersonal or internalized aspects of Muslim religious identity are unrelated to\ncivic engagement is important because it indicates that Islam is not inherently\nrestrictive of participation in American life (Khan 2003). The fact that the more\norganizational dimensions are positively related to civic engagement mirrors\nfindings for other U.S. groups. Moreover, the addition of religious identity partly\nexplains differences in civic engagement between men and women seen in\nmodel 1, suggesting that different processes may be at play for each of these\ngroups.\nAccordingly, tables 2 and 3 provide more in-depth examinations of gender\ndifferences in civic engagement with the use of separate (fully interactive)\nmodels for men and women, first looking at the scaled item for civic engagement\n(Column B, table 2) and then looking individually at the five organizations in\nwhich men and women differ in their participation (table 3). Several interesting\nfindings emerge from these analyses. First, Column B shows that subjective\nreligiosity remains unimportant for men's overall level of civic engagement\nreflect the fact that strict interpretations of all mono-theistic religions endorse a\ngendered division of labor, thus women may feel that it is more important to\nengage in the private, familial realm rather than the public one. While these\nTABLE 2 OLS Regression Coefficients for Arab Muslim Civic Engagement, MAPS\nColumn A Column B\nModel 1 Model 2 Women Men\n-- --\nHigh subjective religiosity (low\nreligiosity)b\nOrganizational religiosity\nAttend mosque once a week or\nmore\nVery involved in mosque\nactivities\nPolitical religiosity\nMosques should express views on\npolitics\nOkay for Imams to discuss politics\nin mosque\nNativity (U.S.-born)b\naAll models control for age and region of residence.\nbReference categories.\ndata are not well suited to test this possibility explicitly, prior qualitative research\non Arab Muslims indicates that this may very well be the case (e.g., Read and\nOselin 2008). The idea is further supported by the fact that the organizational di-\nmensions of religiosity have a significant impact on men's civic engagement but\nnot on women's. Specifically, attending the mosque more than once a week in-\ncreases men's civic involvement (0.326), as does being very involved in other\nmosque activities (0.471*). Again, this may be picking up on the different\nTABLE 3 Gender Differences in Religion and Civic Engagement, MAPS (N \u00bc 1,156)a\nWomen Men\nSchool or youth programs\nHigh subjective religiosity NS \u00fe\nAttend mosque more than 1/week NS NS\nVery involved in mosque activities NS \u00fe\nMosques should express political views NS NS\nOkay for imams to discuss politics in mosque NS NS\nTrade organizations\nHigh subjective religiosity NS NS\nAttend mosque more than 1/week \u00fe NS\nVery involved in mosque activities NS NS\nMosques should express political views \u00fe NS\nOkay for imams to discuss politics in mosque NS NS\nProfessional organizations\nHigh subjective religiosity NS NS\nAttend mosque more than 1/week \u00fe \u00fe\nVery involved in mosque activities NS \u00fe\nMosques should express political views NS NS\nOkay for imams to discuss politics in mosque \u00fe NS\nArts or cultural organization\nHigh subjective religiosity 2 2\nAttend mosque more than 1/week NS NS\nVery involved in mosque activities NS \u00fe\nMosques should express political views NS NS\nOkay for imams to discuss politics in mosque NS NS\nNeighborhood, civic, or community group\nHigh subjective religiosity NS NS\nAttend mosque more than 1/week NS \u00fe\nVery involved in mosque activities \u00fe NS\nMosques should express political views NS NS\nOkay for imams to discuss politics in mosque \u00fe NS\n\"NS,\" not significant. \"\u00fe,\" positive association (*p , .05). \"2,\" negative association\naSignificance levels from logistic regression models that control for age, education, nativ-\nity, and region.\nmessages that men and women receive at the mosque regarding appropriate roles\nin the public and private realms. Moreover, these findings hold net of other\nfactors known to shape civic engagement such as socioeconomic status. Here, we\nsee that having a bachelor's degree or more is positively associated with civic par-\nonly important for men's participation (0.536**). This may reflect the fact that\nmen are more likely than women to be employed, and thus the income effect is\nmore directly tied to their experiences in the labor market.\nFinally, table 3 assesses gender differences in the relationship between reli-\ngion and civic engagement separately for each of the five organizations in which\nmen and women differed in table 1. As seen in table 1, women are more active\nthan men in school and youth programs but less active in trade/labor unions, pro-\nfessional organizations, neighborhood/civic groups, and arts/cultural organiza-\ntions. For simplicity, the table uses the following symbols to indicate whether or\nnot the relationship is significant, and if so, in what direction: \"NS\" is not signifi-\ncant, \"\u00fe\" means a positive association (p , .05), and \"2\" means a negative as-\nsociation (p , .05). Three findings are particularly striking. First, many of the\ndimensions of religious identity are not significantly related to civic engagement\nfor either men or women. This may partly reflect small sample sizes since there is\nless variation in the outcome to predict than when using the scaled measure of\ncivic engagement and all of the models include age, socioeconomic status, and\nnativity because each is known to be associated with both religiosity and civic ac-\ntivity. Second, to the extent that religion matters, the association is generally\npositive, but the actual dimension that matters varies by gender and specific form\nof engagement. For example, subjective religiosity and involvement in mosque\nactivities is linked with greater levels of men's involvement in school and youth\nprograms but has no significant impact on women's. Women's involvement is\nalready high (67.2 percent) and may be driven by other factors, such as family\nstructure and employment. Third, the negative association between subjective\nreligiosity and civic engagement seen in table 2 emerges for women once more,\nbut only for arts and cultural programs. It is also negative for men on this\noutcome. This likely links back to the fact that the depiction of all humans and\nanimals is discouraged in the hadith and figurative art (humans and animals) is\nforbidden by the sharia.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the increasing heterogeneity of America's ethnic and religious land-\nscape, some populations remain relatively lesser known and often misunderstood.\nSuch has been the case with Arab Muslims, a group at the intersection of ethnic-\nity, religion, immigration, and public discourse. The goal of this article was to\ncontribute to ongoing scholarly efforts to contextualize the experiences of this\ngroup within a broader historical framework. To that end, the analysis examined\nthe civic participation of Arab Muslims as a way to assess their level of integra-\ntion and participation in American society. The empirical focus was three-fold,\nfocusing on overall rates of civic engagement, gender differences in engagement,\nand religion's association with participation.\nIn terms of overall rates, the results indicate that Arab Muslims are actively\ninvolved in civic organizations and have participation rates that equal those of\nthe general U.S. population (Corporation for National and Community Service\n2012). Although men's and women's overall rates of engagement are quite\nsimilar, some notable distinctions emerge when the type of organization is con-\nsidered. Specifically, men appear more involved in organizations tied to the eco-\nnomic realm (e.g., trade and labor unions), and women more active in those\nconnected to family life (e.g., school and youth programs). One might be\ntempted to interpret these findings as supporting stereotypes of Arab Muslim\nfamilies as inegalitarian; however, these patterns are not unique to Arab Muslims\nand can be found among other U.S. groups as well (for a review, see Cicognani\nOne of the more interesting findings of this study concerns the relationship\nbetween religious identity and civic engagement. A common presumption is that\nIslam, itself, is oppositional to democracy and western ideals of equality, and thus\nrepresents a major obstacle to Muslim integration. The results indicate that the\nrelationship is not so straightforward and depends on the specific aspect of reli-\ngious identity in question, the specific type of community organization, and on\ngender. Organizational dimensions of religious identity have an overall positive\neffect on civic engagement, which is similar to findings for other U.S. groups.\nThe political dimensions of religious identity also increase civic engagement, but\nthey do so by enhancing political consciousness which in turn promotes commu-\nnity involvement. Again, important gender distinctions emerged between reli-\ngious identity and civic engagement, with a weaker and sometimes negative link\nbetween the two for women in terms of subjective religiosity. These findings indi-\ncate that religion generally operates to increase civic engagement for Arab\nMuslims but does so in different ways for men and women.\nThis study is not without limitations. As with most survey data, the responses\nare based on self-reports, which introduces the possibility of desirability bias in\nrespondents' accounts of their civic engagement. However, a central goal of this\nstudy was to examine gender differences in engagement, and there is no evidence\nto suggest that any potential bias would vary by gender. Second, because the\nMAPS project focused exclusively on Muslims, a comparison of religious differ-\nences in civic engagement between Arab Muslims and Arab Christians is not\npossible. Studies on Arab Christians indicate a largely assimilated population\nwith a longer history of settlement in the   than Arab Muslims,\nmaking them less of a target for concerns over integration (e.g., Baker et al.\n2009). Finally, while the data represent one of the only sources of national-level\ndata on Arab Muslims, they are becoming somewhat dated. The experiences of\nArab Muslims in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks may look different today. To\nthe extent that they may differ, community-based studies suggest that their levels\nof involvement may be on the rise, as more and more Muslims mobilize to\naddress their lack of representation in civil society (e.g., Zahedi 2011).\nOverall, findings from this study validate past research that identifies similari-\nties between Arab Muslim communities and other U.S. populations on a host of\nissues, including political participation (Jamal 2005), identity formation (Haddad\nRead 2003). At the same time, discrimination and prejudice toward Muslims\noverstating the positive integration of these groups. Indeed, recent studies docu-\nment emerging signs of discontent among second-generation Arab and Muslim\nyouth, all of whom are U.S. citizens and most of whom have grown up in a context\n2008). It is unclear whether this younger generation will follow in the footsteps of\ntheir post-1965 predecessors, many of whom channeled their grievances into advo-\ncacy groups that promoted civic integration. Continued animosity toward Arab\nand Muslim populations may very well alter their integration trajectories and\nrequire new frameworks to depict accurately their place in American society.\nREFERENCES\nAbdul-Matin, Ibrahim. 2010.
