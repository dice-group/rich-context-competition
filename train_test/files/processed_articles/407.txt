The guidelines recommend that\nchildren and adolescents limit screen time to no more than\n2 h/day.7,8 Although the influence of screen time on poor\nhealth was well established when the guidelines were devel-\noped, it is not clear how or why the 2-h threshold was\nselected. Dose\u00adresponse studies of screen time and health\nare required to verify the appropriateness of this threshold.\nFurthermore, from a physical health perspective, obesity was\nthe primary outcome considered in the development of the\nscreen time guidelines. There is a need to ascertain the con-\nnection between screen time and other pertinent outcomes\nsuch as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS represents a\nclustering of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes risk\nfactors that predisposes one to several chronic diseases and\npremature mortality.9 Clinical criteria for MetS often include\nfeatures such as abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low\nHDL cholesterol, high fasting glucose and high blood\nAmy E.

Clarification of the independent effect of\nscreen time on health has important implications for the\ndevelopment of interventions aimed at decreasing sedentary\nbehaviours and increasing physical activity (e.g. should the\nintervention focus be placed on one or both behaviours?).\nIn a large sample of adolescents from the European Youth\nHeart Study, television viewing time was correlated to MetS\ncomponents, but not the clustered cardiometabolic risk\nfactor score, after adjustment for physical activity.12 These\nresults suggest that screen time itself may not be an inde-\npendent predictor of obesity and other cardiometabolic risk\nfactors. However, the European Youth Heart Study only\nconsidered television time and did not measure other\nimportant components of screen time such as computer\nand video game use.\nThe objectives of this study were to determine if screen\ntime is related to MetS in adolescents, to examine the dose\u00ad\nresponse pattern of that relationship, and to determine if the\nrelationship between MetS and screen time is independent\nof physical activity.\nMethods\nThe study sample consisted of a subgroup of subjects from\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES is a\ncross-sectional survey completed in the US population and\nidentified subjects using a complex, stratified, multistage,\nprobability sampling design. Participation in the survey was\nvoluntary. Written informed parental consent and child\nassent were obtained from participants under 18 years of\nage; written consent was obtained from participants 18 years\nand older. The protocol was approved by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics. The secondary analysis pre-\nsented here was approved by the Queen's University Health\nSciences Research Ethics Board.\nThe eligible NHANES sample for the present study\nincluded those aged 12\u00ad19 years who completed both the\nhome interview and mobile exam centre (MEC) com-\nponents of the survey. Only subjects with complete screen\ntime, physical activity, demographic, dietary, anthropometric,\nblood pressure and fasting blood measures were examined\nin the present study (n \u00bc 1803). Compared with the total eli-\ngible NHANES sample in the same age range (n \u00bc 6980),\nthe study sample comprised a greater proportion of males\nScreen time\nScreen time included television, video and computer game\nuse, and was ascertained as part of the physical activity\nquestionnaire, which was completed in the home interview\nor MEC depending on the survey round and age of the par-\nticipant. Subjects reported the number of hours per typical\nday in the past 30 days that they watched television (includ-\ning videos) and/or used a computer (including video games\nconsole) during their free time. Response categories included\nhours'. Screen time categories of `none', ` ,1 h' and `1 h',\nrepresenting 24.2% of the study sample, were combined. All\nsion, video and computer use, whereas participants aged\nevision/video use and computer use. Television/video and\ncomputer time were combined, when necessary, to create an\noverall screen time score. Only subjects 16\u00ad19 years were\nof the questions used to obtain screen time behaviours in\n12\u00ad15 year olds, who reported on the previous day rather\nthan the previous month.\nMetabolic syndrome\nMetabolic syndrome criteria\nAge- and gender-specific adolescent MetS criteria linked to\nthe National Cholesterol Education Program Adult\nTreatment Panel III criteria were used to define MetS in this\nstudy.10 MetS was defined as having 3 of the following:\nhigh triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumfer-\nence, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol. The\nage- and gender-specific thresholds for each MetS com-\nponent were developed using growth curve modelling\nwhereby the threshold for 12\u00ad19 year olds corresponds to\nthe adult value at 20 years of age on the respective growth\ncurve.10 Specifically, for each MetS component the gender-\nspecific percentile score corresponding to the adult cut-point\nat exactly 20 years of age was determined. The percentile\nvalues for MetS component were used within each 0.5 year\nage grouping to determine which subjects had each specific\nMetS component.10 For example, in adults a triglyceride\nvalue of 1.70 mmol/l is used to denote high-risk values.\nThis corresponded to the 89th percentile at age 20 in males.\nThus, the 89th percentile at each 0.5 year age grouping for\n12\u00ad19 year old males was used to denote high triglyceride\nvalues. For a more detailed description of the method used\nto define MetS the reader is referred to the paper by Jolliffe\nMeasurement of metabolic syndrome components\nSubjects were seated and rested quietly for 5 min before\nthree blood pressure measures were obtained on the right\narm using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Systolic blood\npressure was recorded at the first Korotkoff sound and dias-\ntolic blood pressure was the point of the last audible\nKorotkoff sound. Mean blood pressure values were used for\nall analyses. Waist circumference was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 cm at the level of the iliac crest at the end of a\nnormal exhalation.13 Fasting blood samples were taken at\nthe MEC examination. Only subjects who reported fasting\nfor eight or more hours were included in the analysis. Blood\nsamples for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed\nat the Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein Analytical\nLaboratory. HDL cholesterol was analysed using the\nheparin\u00admanganese precipitation method. Triglycerides\nwere measured enzymatically in a series of coupled reactions\nhydrolysing triglycerides to produce glycerol.14 Samples for\nblood glucose were sent to the University of Missouri for\nanalysis and were assayed using a hexokinase enzyme\nmethod.14 A more detailed description of laboratory pro-\ncedures are provided in the NHANES Laboratory\nCovariates\nSocio-demographic information\nGender and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Hispanic and others) were considered.\nThe poverty-to-income ratio was used as a measure of\nsocioeconomic status and represents the ratio between\nfamily income to the family poverty threshold, which is\nbased on family size and composition.\nPhysical activity\nSelf-reported participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity\nphysical activity was obtained during the home interview or\nMEC depending on the survey round and age of the partici-\npant. Subjects reported the frequency (number of times in\npast 30 days) and average duration (in minutes) per session\nfor each moderate and vigorous intensity activity they\nparticipated in during the previous 30 days. Activities were\nselected from a list with the option to add additional\nactivities. For each activity, a daily average was calculated by\nmultiplying the frequency and duration of the activity, and\ndividing by 30. Total daily physical activity represents the\nsum of all activities. Physical activity categories were created\nselected to provide meaningful groups for the interpretation\nof results. Because a limited number of subjects (10.6%)\nmet physical activity guidelines15 of more than 60 min of\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, a separate\ncategory was not created for this physical activity level. In\nyouth, questionnaire measures of physical activity are reliable\nand modestly correlated (r \u00bc 0.40) with objective physical\nactivity measures obtained by accelerometer,16 although the\nquestionnaire measures tend to over-estimate physical\nDietary measures\nSubjects were queried and reported on type and amount of\nfood and beverages consumed during the 24 h prior to the\nMEC examination. Results of the dietary recall were used to\nestimate the percent of total calories from carbohydrates\nand fat. Subjects were separated into three groups for carbo-\nas high) consumption in accordance with dietary\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were completed using Intercooled Stata 7 (Strata\nCorporation, College Station, TX, USA) to take into account\nthe sampling strategy and weighting of the NHANES\nsurvey. An alpha level of P , 0.05 represented statistical\nsignificance.\nA `yes' or `no' binary variable for MetS was used as the\ndependent variable for the statistical analyses. A x2 test was\nused to compare the prevalence of MetS across screen time\ncategories. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine\nthe odd ratios for MetS. Initially, bivariate logistic regression\nanalyses were performed to determine whether the potential\ncovariates of age, sex, race, socioeconomic status (poverty\u00ad\nincome ratio) and dietary measures were related to MetS. We\nthen performed logistic regression models to determine\nwhether categories of screen time, with the 1 h/day\nscreen time category serving as the reference group (odds\nratio \u00bc 1.00), and physical activity, with 45 min/day\nserving as the reference group, predicted MetS. Three\nmodels (basic, intermediate and fully adjusted) were con-\nsidered in the screen time and physical activity logistic\nregression analyses. The basic models considered the bivari-\nate relation between the screen time or physical activity\nmeasure with MetS. The intermediate models considered\nthe relation between the screen time or physical activity\nmeasure with MetS after controlling for the covariates that\nwere significant (P  0.05) predictors of MetS. The fully\nadjusted model included both screen time and physical\nactivity measures and controlling for the covariates that were\nsignificant predictors of MetS. The trend of association\nacross categories of screen time and physical activity were\nalso tested by repeating the analyses and including the\nscreen time and physical activity categories as continuous\nvariables (presented as Ptrend\n).\nResults\nNHANES surveys were included in the analyses. Subject\ncharacteristics are presented in Table 1. Only 24.2% of sub-\njects reported screen time values of 2 h or less per day and\nmet the public health screen time recommendation. The\nprevalence of MetS was 5.9% and did not differ between\nmales and females. Mean values for the individual MetS\ncomponent risk factors are also presented in Table 1.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the prevalence of MetS increased\n(P \u00bc 0.03) as screen time increased from a low of 3.7% in\nthe 1 h/day screen time group to a high of 8.4% in the\n5 h/day screen time group. These results were consistent\nwithin both genders (Fig. 1).\nAge and smoking statuses were the only potential covari-\nates that were significantly related to MetS (Table 2).\nTherefore, additional analyses that considered the relation\nbetween screen time and/or physical activity with MetS only\nincluded age and smoking as covariates.\nTable 1 Subject characteristics\nRace/ethnicity\nModerate-to-vigorous physical\nactivity, min/day\nMetabolic syndrome component\nData presented as prevalences (%) or mean +standard deviation.\nFig. 1 Prevalence (%) of the metabolic syndrome according to screen time\ncategory.\nTable 2 Odds ratios for the metabolic syndrome for the potential\ncovariates\nCovariate Odds ratio for MetS P-value\nSmoking status\nDietary carbohydrates (% of total calories)\nDietary fat (% of total calories)\nRace/ethnicity\nData presented as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals).\nThe results of the logistic regression analyses examining\nthe relation between screen time and MetS are presented in\nTable 3. After controlling for the relevant covariates (inter-\nmediate model), there was a linear trend for an increased\nodds ratio for the MetS across screen time groups (Ptrend\n\u00bc\n0.005). In comparison with youth in the 1 h/day screen\ntime group, youth in the 5 h/day screen time group were\n3.07 times more likely to have MetS. The inclusion of phys-\nical activity as a covariate in the regression analysis (fully\nadjusted model) had little influence on the relationship\nbetween MetS and screen time (Table 3).\nAlthough the pattern of results shown in Table 4 suggests\nthat physical activity was negatively related to MetS, such\nthat physically inactive youth were more likely to have MetS\nthan the most active youth, the relation between physical\nactivity and MetS did not reach statistical significance in\neither the basic or intermediate models. The inclusion of\nscreen time as a covariate in the regression model had little\ninfluence on the relation between physical activity and MetS\n(Table 4, fully adjusted model).\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nThe primary finding was that the likelihood of having the\nMetS increased in a gradient dose\u00adresponse manner as daily\nscreen time hours increased, irrespective of physical activity\nlevel. Adolescents reporting screen times of 3 h/day were\napproximately two- to threefold more likely to have MetS\nthan were adolescents with daily screen time levels of 1 h\nor less.\nWhat is known already\nScreen time has previously been linked to a number of pae-\ndiatric health determinants and outcomes including obesity\nand body-image issues, violent and aggressive behaviours,\nearly sexual behaviours and substance use and abuse.6 The\nresults presented here for MetS are consistent with the con-\nsensus that excessive screen time negatively impacts the\nhealth and well-being of youth. The strong relation between\nexcessive screen time and MetS is particularly troubling\nTable 3 Odds ratios for the metabolic syndrome based on daily screen time\nDaily screen time Unadjusted model Intermediate model Fully adjusted model\nPtrend\nData presented as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals).

The fully adjusted model was\nadjusted for age, smoking and screen time.\ngiven that: (i) 75% of the adolescent participants in this\nstudy had screen time levels of at least 2 h per day; (ii) MetS\nand its component risk factors tend to persist from adoles-\ncence into adulthood,19,20 (iii) most chronic diseases, such\nas cardiovascular disease, are progressive conditions that\nstart to develop in childhood21,22 and (iv) in adult popu-\nlations MetS is a proven risk factor for Type 2 diabetes,23,24\nthe basis of these observations, the overall impact of exces-\nsive screen time in youth on MetS and resultant health out-\ncomes is likely to be quite substantive at the population\nlevel.\nWhat this study adds\nTo our knowledge the present study was the first to examine\nthe dose\u00adresponse nature of the relation between screen\ntime and health. We observed a positive relation between\nscreen time and MetS, which emphasizes the negative\nimpact of increasing screen time across the continuum.\nHowever, our results suggest that the public health rec-\nommendation of no more than 2 h of screen time per day7,8\nmay be somewhat restrictive, at least as the MetS is con-\ncerned. The likelihood of having MetS was only increased\nby 21% in the 2 h/day screen time group, an amount that\nwas far from reaching statistical relevance. However, once a\nscreen time level of 3 h/day was achieved, the likelihood of\nthe MetS was increased by about twofold, and was clinically\nmeaningful and of borderline significance (P \u00bc 0.06).\nThe study also sought to determine if the relation\nbetween screen time and MetS was independent of any\npotentially confounding influence of physical activity. Our\nobservation that physical activity had little or no impact on\nthe relation between screen time and MetS is consistent with\nprevious findings that physical activity and screen time\nbehaviours are poorly or unrelated in youth.4,12,26 The fact\nthat screen time was related to MetS independent of\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity raises\nquestions about the mechanism by which screen time\ninfluences MetS. One possible explanation is that only\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was\nmeasured, and the lower intensity activities that were not\ncaptured in the NHANES survey were having some unmea-\nsured effects. Another possible explanation is that screen\ntime is more `sedentary' than other sedentary behaviours\n(e.g. reading, talking on the phone). One study reported that\nenergy expenditure in children and youth is lower while they\nare watching television than it is while they are at rest.27\nAnother study found an inverse relation between resting\nenergy expenditure and weekly hours of television; however,\nthe same study reported no differences in energy expendi-\nture while resting, watching television and story listening.28\nA final explanation is that the time spent watching television\nis associated with poor dietary habits such as increased con-\nsumption of soft drinks and sweets, and decreased con-\nsumption of fruits and vegetables.29 We controlled for the\nmacronutrient intake of fat and carbohydrates in our ana-\nlyses, which suggests that the influence of television on\ndietary habits may not account for the influence of screen\ntime on MetS.\nThe finding that screen time was an independent predic-\ntor of MetS in adolescents differs from a report based on\nthe European Youth Heart Study in which no relationship\nexisted between television time and cardiometabolic risk\nfactors after adjusting for physical activity level.12 Several\nmethodological differences are likely to account for the dis-\ncrepancy in results. The European Youth Heart Study only\nmeasured television time, whereas the combined index of\ntelevision and computer use employed in our study pro-\nvided a more comprehensive measure of screen time beha-\nviours. Conversely, our study relied on a self-report measure\nof physical activity, which is subject to considerable recall\nbias in adolescents,30 whereas the European Youth Heart\nStudy used accelerometers to obtain an objective measure of\nphysical activity. Thus, the measures used in our study were\nbetter suited to detect effects of screen time, although the\nmeasures used in the European Youth Heart Study were\nbetter suited to detect effects of physical activity, which is\nexactly what these two studies found. Finally, the European\nYouth Heart Study examined a cardiometabolic risk score\ncreated by summing age-adjusted z-scores for blood\npressure, skinfolds, glucose, insulin, HDL-C and triglycer-\nides. In comparison, we used adolescent National\nCholesterol Education Program criteria for MetS that relied\non measures of waist circumference, blood pressure,\nHDL-C, triglycerides and glucose.10\nStrengths and limitations\nKey strengths of this study include the use of a representa-\ntive study sample and an age-appropriate measure of MetS\nfor adolescents. The primary study limitation was the cross-\nsectional and observational nature, which prevents us from\nmaking causal inferences about the relation between screen\ntime and MetS. The other main limitation was the self-\nreported measures of screen time and physical activity.\nSelf-reported measures tend to underestimate socially unde-\nsirable behaviours (e.g. screen time) and over-estimate\nsocially desirable behaviours (e.g. physical activity).17\nAlthough socially undesirable activities such as screen time\nare typically under-reported,17 a previous study in youth\nfound that television time was only underestimated by\n0.09 h/week.31 Furthermore, simple questionnaire measures\nof television use, such as those obtained in NHANES, are\ncorrelated (r \u00bc 0.47) with television time measured by a\ndetailed log.31 However, because the NHANES screen time\nquestion did not distinguish between days, the validity of the\nscreen time measure may have been affected since screen\ntime has been shown to differ between weekdays and\nConclusions\nHigh screen time was associated with an increased likelihood\nof MetS independent of physical activity, diet and other\nimportant covariates. The results suggested that the screen\ntime guidelines of no more than 2 h/day may be somewhat\nrestrictive with respect to MetS risk, as the odds ratio for\nMetS did not increase notably until 3 h of screen time per\nday. The findings of this study also suggest that public\nhealth interventions that target health behaviours in adoles-\ncents should include a specific component(s) aimed at redu-\ncing screen time. This observation has important public\nhealth and clinical implications and emphasizes the import-\nance of targeting both screen time and physical activity\nbehaviours for improving the health of youngsters.\nSpecifically, interventions that are successful at increasing the\nphysical activity level of young people will not necessarily be\nsuccessful at simultaneously decreasing their screen\ntime.32,33 And because the relation between screen time and\nMetS appear to be independent of physical activity, improv-\ning physical activity while maintaining screen time levels is\nlikely to be far from optimal. Additional studies, particularly\nintervention studies, are needed to verify this contention.\n"
