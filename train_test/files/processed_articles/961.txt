With a focus on the use of longitudinal data, this study reviews trends in the quantitative analysis of social\nscience data on aging during the past half century.\nMethods. A content analysis was performed on 227 articles from 12 volumes that were systematically sampled from\nthe Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences to examine change in the type of data and quantitative methods used (1946\u00ad\nResults. Cross-sectional analysis remains the single most frequent type of study, but the publication of analyses based\non longitudinal panel data increased appreciably over the five decades studied. There was little increase in the use of\nrepeated cross-sectional analysis.\nDiscussion. Despite the widespread use of cross-sectional analysis, interest in data with more than one occasion of\nmeasurement has grown among social scientists who are reviewing for and publishing in the Journal. Given the\nlongitudinal data now available, social science research on aging should give more explicit attention to three issues:\nattrition, change in repeated measures of independent variables, and models to account for many waves of data.\nMOST scientific fields of inquiry make use of some form\nof data that capture processes over time. Chemists\nmeasure the lifetimes of compounds. Physicians take repeated\nmeasurements of physiologic data. Economists track financial\ntrends over time. Whether on the scale of nanoseconds or\ncenturies, repeated measurements over a span of time enable\nresearchers to describe and, it is hoped, understand the pro-\ncesses and mechanisms of change. Within social gerontology,\nit is considered axiomatic to prefer repeated measurements of\noutcome variables. Indeed, it has been argued that the analysis\nof longitudinal data is ``one of the most productive approaches\nto the study of aging and human development'' (Alwin &\nThe purpose of this paper is to systematically examine the\nuse of longitudinal data in social gerontology during the past\nfive decades. A brief review of the key factors likely to increase\nthe use of longitudinal analysis is presented, and a content\nanalysis of the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences is used\nto document change in methods used.\nIncrease in Longitudinal Analyses in Social\nGerontology?\nResearch using cross-sectional data has made--and will\ncontinue to make--a number of contributions to the field of\nsocial gerontology. For example, cross-sectional studies have\ngenerated important findings by examining unique or rare\npopulations ranging from older mothers of chronically disabled\nchildren (Pruchno, Patrick, & Burant, 1996) to elders in rural\nall-Black towns (McAuley, 1998). Moreover, cross-sectional\ndata that allow for comparisons across cultures or nations\nprovide social scientists an opportunity to understand the\nuniversality of a relationship or phenomenon (Su & Ferraro,\nanalysis of cross-sectional data has provided invaluable\ncontributions to the literature.\nThe challenge emerges, however, when research questions\nfocus on the process of aging or changes over the life course\n(e.g., adaptation to life events). It has long been recognized\nthat a common fallacy in gerontological research is that age\ndifferences are synonymous with age changes. Researchers\nusing data collected at only one point in time are faced with the\nburden of separating the unique effects of age, period, and\ncohort (Glenn, 1977). Aging is a process; thus, research on\naging or age-related changes must confront temporal issues\nrelated to biography, history, and cohort flow (Riley, 1987). As\nsimple (and, we would argue, flawed) cross-sectional com-\nparison of age groups implies a developmental, or aging,\nperspective.'' As a result of the skepticism about interpretations\nof ``age effects'' in cross-sectional analyses, longitudinal data\nare often regarded as more useful for aging research.\nThe value of longitudinal data has been advanced repeatedly in\nthe discussion section of articles using cross-sectional data and in\nchapters on research design in gerontology handbooks (e.g.,\nAlwin & Campbell, 2001) and textbooks (e.g., Morgan &\nKunkel, 2001). Longitudinal data are not the panacea for\ngerontology, but most scholars conclude that they offer greater\npotential for advancing the science of aging. Unlike with cross-\nsectional data, there is the potential to distinguish age differences\nfrom age changes with data from multiple points in time.\nBeyond exhortations to use data collected at multiple points\nin time, the convergence of several forces in recent decades\nhas made longitudinal data analysis more feasible. First, the\nparadigm for social science research on aging has shifted\nsomewhat in recent decades from one focused on the study\nof older people to the process of aging. Interest in age\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\nstratification (Riley, Johnson, & Foner, 1972), dialectical\noperations in adulthood (Riegel, 1973), the life course (Elder,\n1974), and life-span development (Baltes, Reese, & Lipsitt,\n1980) spurred greater interest in aging as a lifelong process.\nMoreover, empirical studies that tracked people over decades\noffered unique insight into the life course (Giele & Elder,\n1998). For example, the Terman Study of Gifted Children,\nthe Berkeley Guidance Study, and the Oakland and Berkeley\nGrowth Studies followed children born in the 1920s for\ndecades. These and other long-term studies helped shift social\ngerontology away from cohort-centric studies of older people\nto more life course analysis and comparisons of age groups.\nEvidence of this paradigmatic shift may also be noted in the\nname change for the American Sociological Association's\nsection dedicated to the study of aging. It was long known as\nSociology of Aging, but in 1997 it was changed to Sociology of\nAging and the Life Course (the second time it was proposed).\nSecond, federal funding of prospective longitudinal studies,\nespecially by the U.S. Department of Labor and National\nInstitute on Aging, resulted in a greater supply of data for\nstudying the aging process. The National Longitudinal Surveys\nand the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were launched in the\n1960s to monitor work and economic behavior over the life\ncourse (Giele & Elder, 1998). Although the National Institute\non Aging supported several major longitudinal studies in\nthe 1980s, most were focused on tracking older adults over\ntime (e.g., Longitudinal Study on Aging, National Long-Term\nCare Survey, and Established Populations for the Epidemio-\nlogic Study of the Elderly); exceptions included Americans'\nChanging Lives and the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey I: Epidemiologic Followup Study. In the 1990s,\nthe Health and Retirement Study reflected this interest in the\nlong-term study of the aging process, albeit with the transition\nto retirement serving as the fulcrum of sample selection.\nDespite differences in the ages of adults studied, the message\nis clear: longitudinal data and analyses are key to advancing\nthe field.\nThird, public data archives made the supply of longitudinal\ndata more available to potential investigators. The development\nof the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social\nResearch (ICPSR), established in 1962, meant that both\nlongitudinal panel data and repeated cross-sectional data were\navailable to a wide array of scientists (Rockwell & Abeles,\n1998). The National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging,\na division of ICPSR, enhanced scores of data sets by providing\nsyntax to conveniently define files and made the data available\nto researchers at institutions that were not members of ICPSR.\nFourth, the revolution in statistical computing in recent\ndecades helped spawn a new generation of analytic resources\nfor longitudinal data. The 1960s witnessed the publication of\nSchaie's (1965) sequential design methodology, spurring dis-\ncussions of ways to handle the age\u00adperiod\u00adcohort confound\nThe discussion engaged methodologists interested in change,\nas evidenced in key publications in the 1970s regarding lon-\ngitudinal methods. Besides cohort analytic methods (Glenn,\n1977), this decade included the publication of seminal works\non event history methods (Cox, 1972) and the use of structural\nequation modeling for longitudinal data (Jo\n\u00a8reskog & So\n\u00a8rbom,\n1977). The application of these methods proliferated in the\n1980s, aided by less technical works that helped clarify their\npower and utility (e.g., Allison, 1984; Campbell & Mutran,\n1982). Seminal works on multiple imputation for missing data\n(Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) and selection bias model-\napplication of these methods to adjust for attrition in panel\nstudies is much more recent. Both growth curve modeling and\nhierarchical linear models were introduced in the social\nEpstein, 1987). Recent applications of these methods in social\ngerontology are encouraging, but it may be too early to gauge\ntheir long-term impact.\nWith powerful techniques of analysis, readily available\nlongitudinal data, and a growing interest in aging across the life\ncourse, one may anticipate a major shift in social gerontology\ntoward longitudinal analyses. The purpose of the present re-\nsearch is to systematically examine such an assertion. To begin,\nwe ask, how common has longitudinal analysis become? Are\na majority of published studies now longitudinal? It seems\nreasonable to anticipate the growing use of longitudinal data in\nattrition until very recently. In addition, whether an increase\noccurs for the analysis of both panel and repeated cross-\nsectional data is more difficult to predict. The analysis of\nrepeated cross-sections avoids the attrition problem, but have\nsocial scientists increased their use of this type of data?\nMETHODS\nContent analysis was performed on articles from a systematic\nsample of volumes from the Journal of Gerontology: Social\nSciences to examine change in the use of longitudinal data from\nhereafter referred to as the Journal, was selected because it is\nwidely regarded as the premiere publication for original re-\nsearch in social gerontology. The Journal of Gerontology, from\nwhich the Journal was spawned, is the oldest journal dedicated\nto the scientific study of aging. The Journal has played a\npivotal role in shaping the field, both from the submissions it\nattracts and the expectations of its reviewers. Thus, one may\nanticipate that methodological advances, especially innovations\nin longitudinal analysis, would be more likely to appear in the\nJournal and then diffuse to other journals. In addition, there\nhave been many calls for longitudinal analyses over the years\nin articles, editorials, and selected essays in the Journal.\nIn a series of essays marking the 50th anniversary of the\nJournal, key gerontologists remarked on the progress of the\nfirst half-century of research on aging and the future directions\nfor the field. Related to the present investigation, Schulz (1995)\nheralded the growth in the number of longitudinal data sets as\na positive step in the study of aging. Cutler (1995, p. S64)\nfurther argued that ``many of the fundamental issues with which\nwe are most concerned involve social, social-psychological,\nand other dimensions of change associated with aging. For\nthese topics, there is no substitute for studies that follow the\nsame individuals over time or for data sets that can be arrayed\nso as to follow cohorts.'' In addition, Kasl (1995) noted that the\nvast improvements in technology and statistical analysis have\nfacilitated the sophisticated use of longitudinal data in social\ngerontology. Although these authors agreed that research using\nlongitudinal data can be beneficial to advancing the field of\naging and that it is reasonable to expect greater use of data from\nmultiple points in time, we are unaware of any systematic study\nof this Journal (or any other) to document change in the use of\nsuch data. Our aim is to use the flagship journal of social\ngerontology to examine how quantitative methods of analyses\nhave changed since 1946, thereby tracking the use of longi-\ntudinal methods over the past 55 years.\nThere were 55 volumes of the Journal of Gerontology\none, volumes from every fifth year were systematically sampled\nsulting in nearly 22% of all volumes published. Content analysis\nwas performed on articles from the 12 volumes to examine\ntotal of 227 social science articles were selected for this analysis\n(all social science articles in each volume were examined).\nSystematic sampling of journal articles is common when\na content analysis of documents collected over a long period of\ntime is conducted. For example, Jones, LaVeist, and Lillie-\nperiod. A 5-year interval was selected for the present research\nto better detect change over the 55-year period. An analysis of\nthe population of articles would, of course, have merit, but the\n5-year interval is a reasonable approach to capture change.\nMoreover, methodological innovations take time to permeate\nthe research community, so sampling every fifth year should\nbe sufficient to capture the ``standard setting'' function of the\nJournal with regard to longitudinal methods.\nNumerous changes in the organization of the Journal\nhave transpired--including a name change in 1988--but this\nresearch examines only those articles classified as social\nscience. Although the Journal has had some type of sectional\norganization since 1972, this also has changed repeatedly. The\nsocial sciences section title emerged in 1985; thus, all articles in\nthis section since 1985 were considered for the given years.\nPrior to that time, all social science articles were selected after\nthey were read by K. Ferraro. Articles classified as psycholog-\nical sciences were excluded from the analysis because the focus\nhere is on nonexperimental approaches to longitudinal analysis.\nMany psychological experiments involve longitudinal data\n(pretests and posttests), but the diffusion of longitudinal\nmethods is likely quite different for experimental and non-\nexperimental approaches. Assuredly, there are nonexperimental\npsychological approaches in the Journal of Gerontology:\nPsychological Sciences, but the scope of the project is clearer\nby focusing on social science research (i.e., articles prior to\n1985 on psychological topics such cognition, perception, and\ndementia were excluded, but works examining social psy-\nchological topics such as social support or exchange were\nincluded). The classification of social science articles was based\non topic, method, and, if necessary, author affiliation.\nsubsequent analysis because they were classified as theoretical\nor qualitative. For each of the remaining 212 quantitative\narticles, the type of analysis was coded into one of three\ncategories: first, cross-sectional (includes studies that pool\ndata across time and ignore year-to-year variation); second,\nlongitudinal panel; and third, repeated cross-sectional (RC-S)\nor cohort analysis (Glenn, 1977). A few articles used both\ncross-sectional and cohort analyses on more than one data set,\nand these were classified as RC-S. The analytic procedures used\nwere coded regardless of the data structure. It is important to\nrecognize that there are longitudinal data and longitudinal\nmethods. This distinction can be clearly discerned by a few\nstudies that reported cross-sectional analysis on longitudinal\npanel data. In an attempt to keep the distinction clear, we use\nthe term analysis rather than design to differentiate between\nthose that used multiple waves and those that used a single\nwave of longitudinal data.\nEach article was read by at least two raters. Each rater\nwas trained on the coding procedures and given one volume\nto analyze. Before proceeding to additional volumes, raters\ndiscussed responses to the first volume with the senior author in\norder to clarify coding procedures. Even after the training\nperiod, raters were encouraged to bring difficult cases to the\nsenior author for resolution. Kappa values for interrater reli-\nability, calculated after case resolution, exceeded .83 for each\nvolume (Landis & Koch, 1977). Some additional charac-\nteristics of the articles were coded and are described later in\nmore detail.\nRESULTS\nAs noted earlier, the Journal experienced many changes over\nthe 55 years, including the number of articles published per\nvolume. To launch our analysis of change in methods, it should\nbe noted first that the number of social science articles in-\ncreased appreciably over time. For each volume through 1965,\nfewer than 10 social science articles were published. Beginning\nin 1990, more than 30 social science articles were published\nin each volume examined.\nNot surprisingly, there was a clear increase in the proportion\nof articles using data collected at multiple points in time, but\nsome caution is necessary when differences in the earliest\nvolumes are examined because of the infrequency of social\nscience articles during the first 20 years. Figure 1 shows the\ndistribution of studies by type of analysis over the 55 years of\npublication. There were some sharp fluctuations over time in\nthe use of longitudinal panel data, but the overall trend was for\nan increase of such articles; the proportion increased as well.\nIn contrast, repeated cross-sectional analysis did not increase\nappreciably over time. The number of data sets available for\nrepeated cross-sectional analysis grew substantially, but there is\nno increase in this type of analysis during the past four decades.\nApproximately 62% of all articles examined were cross-\nsectional analyses only. Whereas at least 60% of all articles in\neach volume of the Journal before 1975 were cross-sectional,\nthis was not the case in most of the volumes examined since\nthen (beginning in 1975, four volumes had less than 60% cross-\nsectional analyses). Indeed, in 1990, the percentage declined\nto less than 50. Articles using some type of longitudinal data\nhave held steady at approximately 40\u00ad45% in the past decade.\nAlthough articles using data collected at multiple time points\nbecame more common, cross-sectional analyses remained the\nsingle most common type of article published.\nSeveral additional variables were coded for each study,\nincluding the number of waves of data collection and type of\nsample. Not only did longitudinal data become more widely\nused over time, but the number of waves of data collection also\nincreased over time (the correlation between number of waves\nbut it was another 25 years before another study was published\nwith 6 or more waves. The number of waves increased sharply\nin the longitudinal articles appearing in the Journal by the\nIn addition to more observation points, the geographic\nvariability increased in studies over time. With their growing\naccessibility through data archives, national samples surpassed\nall other types of samples in 1995. When national samples are\ncombined with multiple-state samples, single-location samples\nhave been the minority since 1980. Social scientists prize\nexternal validity, and the availability of nationally represen-\ntative samples has attracted considerable use. As might be\nexpected, the type of analysis varied by type of sample.\nNational samples were reported for approximately 83% of the\ncohort analyses, 35% of the cross-sectional analyses, and\n24% of the longitudinal panel analyses. Nearly half of the\nlongitudinal panel studies were based on local samples. (A\nlogistic regression analysis for the use of national data revealed\nsignificant independent effects for three variables: National data\nwere more likely to be used in more recent studies and in cohort\nand cross-sectional studies than for longitudinal panel studies.)\nOne of the basic issues facing scientists analyzing longitudinal\npanel data, especially over longer time periods, is attrition (i.e.,\nnonresponse, loss to follow-up, and mortality). Although many\nof the longitudinal panel studies examined attrition patterns and\ntempered their conclusions in light of them, only 9 of the 63\nlongitudinal panel studies made some type of formal adjustment\nfor attrition. This may seem less than exemplary, but all 9 of\nevidence of a substantial shift toward the use of such procedures\nby scholars using longitudinal panel data.\nTo examine the validity of this premise more closely, we\nfirst occurrence of an adjustment for attrition was in 1995,\na finer grained analysis may help to identify if this truly signals\na change since the methods first appeared in the sampled\nyears. Thus, beyond the 227 articles systematically sampled\nThe review of those articles reveals that adjusting parameter\nestimates to account for attrition has, indeed, become more\nof the articles using repeated measures undertook some type of\nadjustment for attrition. Interestingly, a wide variety of methods\nwere used to adjust parameter estimates for attrition, ranging\nfrom weighting to multiple imputation. Of the remaining\narticles, about half mentioned attrition or performed supple-\nmentary analyses to show how selection bias may have\ninfluenced the findings. In short, the majority of articles pub-\nlished in recent years address attrition in one way or another--\na sign that longitudinal analysis alone is not sufficient. The\nemerging standard in social gerontology expects authors and\nreviewers to be aware of the potential problems caused by\nnonrandom attrition and to temper conclusions in light of\nselection bias.\nDISCUSSION\nLongitudinal data are often heralded for improving the\nscience of aging, and there has been a growing use of longi-\ntudinal data in recent decades as uncovered in a content analysis\nof the Journal. Cross-sectional analysis was the most frequently\nused approach in 15 out of the 16 volumes of the Journal\nexamined, but the trend toward an increase in the use of\nlongitudinal data is manifest in recent years. Although one\nvolume--1996--had more longitudinal than cross-sectional\nanalyses, the pattern of at least 40\u00ad45% of the articles reporting\nsome type of longitudinal analysis has been fairly steady for\nthe past decade. Accompanying the growth in the use of\nlongitudinal data, both the number of measurement points and\nthe length of observation increased. We have witnessed reports\nof findings from more long-term panel studies of aging, and we\nbelieve that these studies provide unique scientific contributions.\nA closer look at the growing prevalence of longitudinal\nanalysis reveals that it was primarily due to the analysis of\npanel data. By contrast, repeated cross-sectional analyses did\nnot increase appreciably over time. There has been a steady\nstream of cohort analyses published in the Journal, but given\nthe supply and availability of repeated cross sections, cohort\nanalyses hold untapped potential for advancing our under-\nstanding of aging, social change, and cohort flow (Campbell,\n1994). Examples of studies published in the Journal that have\nclarified the role of these forces include findings on growth in\nnoncitizen Supplemental Security Income caseloads (Van Hook\nretirement preparation (Ferraro, 1990), disability (Schoeni,\nFreedman, & Wallace, 2001), and verbal ability (Alwin &\nMcCammon, 2001). Most social scientists are familiar with\ncensus data and the General Social Survey being used as re-\npeated cross sections, but many other surveys merit attention.\nExamples include the Health Interview Survey, the National\nHome and Hospice Surveys, the National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey, the National Medical Expenditure Survey, and the\nSurvey of Consumer Finances.\nIt needs to be recognized that an analysis of repeated cross\nsections permits assessment of change. It is not change within\nan individual's life, as is customarily seen in panel studies, but\nchange within a set of people defined by date of birth or some\nother event. It should also be recalled that aging represents\na link between history and biography (Riley, 1987). Much can\nbe gleaned from the analysis of repeated cross sections to\nidentify how the changes observed in cohorts may be dependent\nFigure 1. Type of analysis in the Journal of Gerontology: Social\non social or historical circumstances. Another advantage of\nrepeated cross-sectional analysis is that sample attrition is not\na concern.\nAlthough the use of cohort analysis remained relatively\nconstant over the five decades, longitudinal panel analysis\nbecame more popular among social scientists during this time.\nOne reason for its attraction is that, unlike a cohort analysis,\na longitudinal panel analysis permits assessment of intra-\nindividual change. As a result, it is widely viewed as helpful for\nexamining mediating effects and the causal processes associ-\nated with aging.\nUnlike the analysis of repeated cross sections, longitudinal\npanel designs face the possibility of attrition and nonrandom\nselection effects (Diggle & Kenward, 1994; Elias & Robbins,\nof older adults are particularly sensitive to the effects of\nselective mortality, institutionalization, and cognitive decline.\nFailing to account for nonrandom attrition and other mecha-\nnisms of selection may produce estimates on a relatively\nprivileged sample in terms of health, socioeconomic status, or\ncognitive ability.\nA content analysis of the Journal revealed that the first\nexplicit application of methods to adjust for attrition occurred in\nthe past decade. Concerns about the role of attrition on findings\nfrom panel studies were articulated decades ago (e.g., Riegel,\nRiegel, & Meyer, 1967), but the development of methods\nfor systematically handling attrition has been fairly recent.\nHowever, there is evidence on the pages of the Journal that\nsocial gerontologists are aware of the problem of nonrandom\nselection bias and are taking steps to account for it in panel\nstudies. Because of the high likelihood of nonrandom attrition\nin samples with older adults, social gerontologists are not only\nbeginning to apply these methods but are also helping to\ndevelop them.\nAwareness of the problem has grown with demonstrations of\ndifferences in parameter estimates with and without adjusting\nfor nonrandom attrition (Lillard & Panis, 1998). A variety\nof techniques are available to account for attrition such as\nHeckman two-stage estimators (Heckman, 1979; Stolzenberg &\nSchafer, 2001), full-information maximum likelihood methods\n(Arbuckle, 1996), and multigroup estimation with structural\nMcArdle, Hamagami, Elias, & Robbins, 1991). The greater use\nof longitudinal panel data is one sign of the maturation of social\ngerontology as a field of inquiry, but increased attention to pos-\nsible bias introduced by attrition in panel studies is another one\nthat should logically follow. Nonrandom attrition may not be\nconsequential to parameter estimates, but scientists studying\nthe aging process should study attrition in panel studies and test\nwhether nonrandom attrition matters.\nThe content analysis of the Journal suggests other important\nfeatures of change in the conduct of longitudinal analyses.\nPerhaps what is most important is that, as longitudinal analyses\nincreased, so did the number of waves of data collection. There\nare two major implications of this trend. First, three or more\nwaves of data permit the use of a whole other set of analytic\nprocedures than are commonly used with two-wave panel\nstudies. Time series methods such as autoregression (Dufour &\npowerful estimation procedures for assessing serial change over\ntime. Latent growth curves are another class of models to assess\nchange over multiple waves, but they measure both intra-\nindividual and the interindividual trajectories over time (Willett\n& Sayer, 1994). There are two major approaches for estimating\ngrowth curves: hierarchical linear models (Bryk & Rauden-\nbush, 1987) and structural equation models (Curran & Bollen,\n2001). Each approach, and the software for using it, has its\nadvantages and disadvantages. (For example, unequal interval\nlengths across three or more waves of data are conveniently\nhandled in hierarchical linear models, but structural equa-\ntion models are better for dealing with measurement error.)\nNevertheless, both make efficient use of information and can\naccount for attrition. Studies using growth curve or Markov\nmodels have provided fresh insights into the dynamics of health\nor social relationships in adulthood and helped to crystallize the\nvalue of the life course perspective.\nWith an increasing number of waves of data, there are also\nnew opportunities to incorporate information from repeated\nmeasures of the independent variable(s). If possible, it is useful\nto update the information on the respondent to that which\nis most proximate to the outcome of interest as well as take\nadvantage of the observed change in the independent variables.\nWith three or more waves of data, it is possible to lag the\nchange in presumed independent variables so as to be sensitive\nto temporal ordering and causal mechanisms.\nA growing number of studies permit incorporation of con-\ntinuous time variables such as a daily indication of whether a\nheart transplant occurred, date of institutionalization, or hourly\nmeasurements of blood pressure. Statistical models have been\ndeveloped that conveniently incorporate covariates that can\nchange over time, deepening our understanding of the in-\nfluence of these factors as we age. Other studies have repeated\nmeasures at discrete time points such as depression, self-rated\nhealth, and employment status updated at each wave of data\ncollection. For example, models that use only baseline data to\npredict subsequent outcomes implicitly assume that individuals\ndo not change over time. Not all samples have repeated mea-\nsures, either continuous or discrete, for such modeling. How-\never, for those that do, inclusion of these types of variables\nallows researchers to calculate how risk varies over time based\nThe application of these types of models is growing in social\ngerontology (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001; Hayward,\nFinally, as longitudinal analyses become both more common\nand complex, it is important to remember that longitudinal data\nhave to be thought of in terms of the research question. Cross-\nsectional data may be not only sufficient but also more ap-\npropriate for some research questions. Even if longitudinal\ndata are preferred, the length of time between waves is a critical\ncriterion when the utility of the data is judged. Subtle changes\ncan be captured when observations are repeated every week,\nmonth, or even year. Studies with longer intervals--5 or 10\nyears--provide a different lens for assessing change. The effect\nsize of relationships may vary over time, so it is important that\nobservation windows are appropriate for the research question\nSome samples, such as the Established Populations for\nthe Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), have seven\nannual observation points taken in consecutive years (Cornoni-\nHuntley et al., 1993). This provides an in-depth examination of\na relatively short time period for older adults. In contrast, the\nStanford\u00adTerman study was initiated in 1922 and subjects were\nfollowed to 1986--a total of 12 waves of data, with interval\nGerontology has gained much from studies of varying interval\nlength; we need both lenses to advance the field.\nThe present study systematically examined change in\nlongitudinal analyses in the Journal. The findings show growth\nin longitudinal panel analysis, stable but meager use of repeated\ncross sections for studying cohort change, and recent imple-\nmentation of methods to account for attrition. Although these\nfindings help us to understand change in the Journal, one\nlimitation of the present study is that conclusions about this one\njournal may not accurately portray changes in social gerontol-\nogy more generally. The Journal is regarded as the flagship for\nsocial gerontology, but other journals dedicated to the study of\naging have proliferated in the past three decades, and important\ninnovations in longitudinal methods may have appeared in\nthose journals. Moreover, the flagship journals of the home\ndisciplines (e.g., economics and sociology) may be where many\nof the innovations are introduced prior to application here.\nAlthough limited to one serial, this review of quantitative\nresearch in the Journal shows important changes in social\ngerontology. Social scientists should continue to value cross-\nsectional research that contributes to our understanding of age\ndifferences. At the same time, the growing use of longitudinal\ndata has the potential to reshape our understanding of the\naging process. Findings from longitudinal data published in\nthe Journal have challenged and helped redefine what we\nknow about many topics in gerontology. Given recent trends in\nthe supply and availability of longitudinal data and statistical\nresources to analyze them, we anticipate more longitudinal\nanalyses in the field. At the same time, there are important\nchallenges in analyzing longitudinal data, especially as the\nnumber of waves and periods of observation increase. These\nchallenges are to be welcomed as a sign of success for the field\nand a call to make the best use of available data. With the\nchallenges for analyzing longitudinal data comes the potential\nto better understand the mechanisms and processes of aging.\n"
