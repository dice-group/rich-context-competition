    "abstract": "Abstracts of the U.S. (U.S. Bu-\nreau of the Census, 1991). Based on these data, we\nassigned $767 as the cost of a night spent in the hos-\npital, $100 as the cost for a day spent in a nursing\nhome, $130 as the cost for a visit to a physician, and\n$97 for the cost of a visit to a psychiatrist. Total costs\nwere the summation of the costs for each self-\nreported psychiatrist visit, other medical doctor visit,\nnursing home day, and hospital night up to a maxi-\nmum of 8 nights. The costs associated with hospital\nstays were limited to 8 nights in order to eliminate\nthe influence of extreme outlying values on estimates\nthe group who became widowed had hospital stays\nof 8 or more nights at follow-up (2  0.1, df  1, NS).\nControl Variables.--Age, sex, socioeconomic sta-\ntus, life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of\nchronic conditions, functional health status, health\nservice use and costs at baseline, and follow-up\nhealth insurance coverage were included as control\nvariables because they were significantly associated\nwith widowhood, marital harmony, and/or follow-up\nhealth service use/costs. We describe briefly the con-\ntrol variables that require definition.\nUsing information obtained on levels of income\nand education, the ACL provided a 4-category mea-\nsure of socioeconomic status (SES): low, lower-mid-\ndle, upper-middle, and high SES. When used as a\ncontrol variable, the SES measure was dichotomized\nto reflect whether or not the respondent was of low\nSES. The dichotomous measure was deemed more\ndesirable because nearly one half of those who be-\ncame widowed (30 of 61) fell into the low SES group,\nand only a few (3 of 61) fell into the high SES group.\nThus, the modified low versus not low SES measure\nyielded a more even distribution across SES catego-\nries. Life-satisfaction was assessed using an index\ncomprising 4 Likert-scaled items that asked respon-\ndents the extent to which they agreed with statements\nabout their happiness, satisfaction, and lack of re-\ngrets. Higher scores on this standardized index corre-\nspond to lower levels of life-satisfaction. An 11-item\nshort form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies\nDepression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to\nassess severity of depressive symptoms. The short\nform, developed by Kohut, Berkman, Evans, and Cor-\nnoni-Huntley (1993), had sound psychometric prop-\nerties (e.g., Cronbach's  = .81). Standardized scores\nwere provided. The number of major chronic condi-\ntions experienced in the last year included the num-\nber of the following 10 chronic conditions endorsed\nby the respondent: arthritis/rheumatism, lung disease,\nhypertension, heart attack or heart trouble, diabetes,\ncancer/malignant tumor, foot problems, stroke, frac-\ntures or broken bones, and urinary incontinence. An\nindex of functional health status was used to rate re-\nspondents on a scale ranging from a score of 1, indi-\ncating confinement to a bed or chair, to a score of 4,\nindicating ability to do heavy housework without dif-\nficulty. Health insurance coverage at the 1989 as-\nsessment was determined by an affirmative response\nto a question asking whether or not the respondent\nhad health insurance at that time.\nAnalyses\nFirst, between-group t tests for continuous mea-\nsures and 2 statistics for categorical measures were\nused to test for significant differences in baseline\ncharacteristics between married respondents and\nthose who would become widowed. We then con-\nducted a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)\nto estimate the main effect of widowhood on health\nstatus and health service use at follow-up. The AN-\nCOVAs that estimated the effects of widowhood on\n1989 health status adjusted for age, sex, SES, life-sat-\nisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of chronic\nconditions, functional health status at baseline, fol-\nlow-up health insurance coverage, and a term that\ncorrected for sample selection biases using a tech-\nnique proposed by Heckman (1979). The ANCOVAs\nestimating the effect of widowhood on health service\nuse in 1989 adjusted for age, sex, SES, life-satisfac-\ntion, depressive symptoms, number of chronic condi-\ntions, functional health status, and health service use\nat baseline, follow-up health insurance coverage,\nand sample selection biases.\nNext, we conducted a one-way ANCOVA to esti-\nmate the main effects of becoming widowed versus\nremaining married, and the main effects of marital\nharmony versus marital discord, on 1989 health\ncosts. These ANCOVAs adjusted for age, sex, SES,\nlife-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of\nchronic conditions, functional health status, and\nhealth care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-\nance coverage, and sample selection biases.\nWe then entered the interaction between marital\nharmony and widowhood status into the ANCOVA\nfor 1989 health costs, adjusting for the main effects\nof widowhood and marital harmony, age, sex, SES,\nlife-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of\nchronic conditions, functional health status, and\nhealth care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-\nance coverage, and sample selection biases.\nResults\nBaseline Group Differences\nIn Table 1, baseline characteristics of the subse-\nquently widowed group were compared with those\nof the group that were to remain married. Despite the\nrestriction of the sample to only respondents who\nwere age 50 years or above, the widowed group still\nemerged as significantly older than the married\ngroup. Respondents who became widowed were also\nmore likely to be women, of lower SES at baseline,\nand less likely to have health insurance coverage at\nfollow-up than respondents who remained married\nthrough both baseline and follow-up assessments.\nThe Effects of Widowhood and Marital Harmony at\nFollow-up\nWith respect to health status, the mean level of de-\npressive symptoms, number of chronic conditions,\nand functional disability at follow-up all reflected\ngreater impairment for the widowed group compared\nto the married group, controlling for age, sex, SES,\nlife-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of\nchronic conditions, functional health status at base-\nline, follow-up health insurance coverage, and a term\nthat corrected for sample selection biases (Table 2).\nWith respect to health service use, the average\nnumber of physician visits and days spent in a nurs-\ning home at follow-up were significantly higher for\nthe widowed group compared to the married group,\nadjusting for all of the control variables just men-\ntioned and health service use at baseline (see Table\n2). However, the widowed group did not have signif-\nicantly more visits to a psychiatrist or nights spent in\na hospital than did the married group at follow-up.\nWith respect to the effects of widowhood status on\nhealth costs at follow-up (Table 3), the means for to-\ntal health costs in 1989 were significantly higher for\nrespondents who became widowed between the\nmained married during that interval (estimated annu-\nvariables mentioned above, but substituting baseline\nhealth care costs for baseline health service use. The\nwidowed group had significantly higher adjusted\nmean outpatient (i.e., psychiatric and other medical\nvisit) costs than those who remained married (esti-\njusted mean inpatient costs at follow-up were 1.6\ntimes higher for the widowed respondents than they\nwere for the married respondents, the difference in\ninpatient costs between these two groups did not\nreach a level of statistical significance (estimated an-\nAs for the direct effects of marital harmony on fol-\nlow-up health costs (Table 3), the adjusted mean total\ncosts were significantly lower for respondents with\nhigh marital harmony, controlling for age, sex, SES,\nlife-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of\nchronic conditions, functional health status, and\nhealth care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-\nance coverage, and sample selection biases (esti-\ntient costs were significantly lower for respondents\nwho scored high on marital harmony than they were\nfor those who scored low. In models that replaced\nthe marital harmony dummy variable with the con-\ntinuous measure of marital harmony, a significant\npositive effect of marital harmony on outpatient costs\ntient costs, however, were not significantly lower for\nrespondents who had harmonious marriages.

In contrast with the signif-\nicantly lower total health care costs in 1989 associ-\nated with having a harmonious marriage versus a dis-\ncordant marriage (Table 3), respondents who became\nwidowed in the context of a harmonious marriage\nhad the highest average total costs in 1989 (annual\nestimate: $2,766). Their total adjusted mean health\nowed respondents who had discordant marriages\nRespondents with harmonious marriages who be-\ncame widowed had the highest average adjusted out-\ncosts were 42% higher than the outpatient costs among\nthose widowed in the context of a discordant mar-\nriage (annual estimate: $978). Although the average\nhealth costs for inpatient care were highest among re-\nspondents widowed following a harmonious marriage,\nthe differences in inpatient costs between the marital\nstatus\u00admarital harmony groups did not reach a level\nof statistical significance.\nDiscussion\nThe aging of the U.S. population has made wid-\nowhood an increasingly common part of American\nlife. Given a heightened interest in containing health\ncosts in recent years, there is a need to evaluate the\nextent to which the growing numbers of widows and\nwidowers will experience health impairments, in-\ncreased health service use, and health care costs.\nLikewise, there is a need to determine the factors that\nmay moderate the influence of widowhood on health\nand expenditures for health care. The results of this\nstudy indicate that widowhood is associated with a\nsubstantial increase in health care costs. Further-\nmore, while marital harmony appears to be protec-\ntive of health and to be associated with lower health\nTable 3.

First, a relatively small number of respon-\ndents were widowed between the baseline and fol-\nlow-up assessments (n  61), indicating a need to\nreplicate the results found in this study in datasets\nthat contain a larger sample of widows and widow-\ners. The limited number of widowers, in particular,\nmade it difficult to stratify by sex, although sex was\nentered as a control variable in each of the multivari-\nate models. The size of the widowed sample also in-\nhibited our ability to divide the sample into more\nnarrowly defined age groups (e.g., the oldest-old,\nmiddle-old, youngest-old). In an attempt to adjust for\nthe age bias in the effects of widowhood on health,\nwe included only respondents age 50 years and\nabove, and controlled for age by including it as a\nmodel covariate. The limited number of widowed re-\nspondents also made it difficult to compare the\nhealth costs of widowed persons in lower socioeco-\nnomic strata with those in upper socioeconomic\nstrata, although baseline (the only time SES was as-\nsessed) low SES, follow-up health insurance cover-\nage, and the sample selection correction allowed us\nto adjust our estimates for financial disincentives that\nmight influence health costs for widowed versus mar-\nried respondents.\nIn addition, the available data did not allow for an\nexamination or comparison of health outcomes be-\ntween recently widowed respondents and respon-\ndents who had been widowed for longer periods of\ntime. Because only 4 of the 61 widowed subjects\nwere widowed within 3 months of the follow-up as-\nsessment, we could not reliably estimate or compare\nmore immediate with longer term effects of widow-\nhood on health. We did examine the 15 subjects\nwho reported being widowed in the 3 months prior\nto the baseline assessment with 607 others who were\nwidowed longer than that duration at baseline. The\n6-month mean total health costs, adjusted for age,\nsex, and SES, were $1,652 among the recently wid-\nowed group compared with $946 among those wid-\nowed longer than 3 months at baseline (this differ-\nence was not statistically significant, probably due to\na lack of statistical power). These results suggest that,\ncompared to those widowed longer than 3 months,\nhealth costs were higher at baseline for the more re-\ncently widowed.\nDespite the fact that over 90% of the widowed re-\nspondents in this study were widowed beyond the\ntime of greatest health risk (i.e., the first few months\npost-loss), we still find large effects of widowhood on\nhealth and health costs among persons widowed any\ntime within a 3-year period. Furthermore, these ef-\nfects of widowhood remain even after adjusting for a\ncomprehensive set of confounding influences. Sev-\nZisook, Shuchter, & Lyons, 1987) suggest that the\nnegative impact of widowhood on health is greatest\nin the first 6 months post-loss. Consequently, if we\nhad compared a group of married respondents with a\ngroup of widowed respondents who had all been\nwidowed 6 months or less, we might expect to find\neven greater discrepancies between these groups\nwith respect to health impairments, health service\nuse, and health care costs. Additionally, while the in-\nclusion of the Heckman sample selection correction\nadjusted for the loss of many of the sickest subjects to\nfollow-up, the actual health costs accrued by sub-\njects who died between waves were not included in\nthe cost estimates. Given that the last year of life is\nthe most expensive, with 25%\u00ad35% of Medicare ex-\npenditures going to enrollees who will die in that\nyear (Lubitz & Prihoda, 1984), omitting these costs\nimplies that costs probably would have been consid-\nerably higher had we been able to account for the\nservices used by widowed subjects who themselves\ndied between baseline and follow-up.\nAnother limitation was that the health costs were a\ndirect function of the units of services used (i.e., costs \nquantity of services used  the average unit cost of\nthat service). Although it would have been preferable\nto use the actual costs of health services each respon-\ndent had used, information on individual costs was\nnot available. Nevertheless, we believe the value of\nmonetizing service use is that it provides a more intu-\nitive understanding of the magnitude of the group dif-\nferences and the public health consequences associ-\nated with widowhood. Because it is not reasonable to\ncombine inpatient and outpatient units of service,\ndollar figures also provide a uniform metric for pre-\nsenting costs of total service use.\nAnother limitation is that the assessments of health\nservice utilization were based on self-report data\nrather than administrative data that document actual\nservice use. Studies suggest, however, that self-report\nutilization data are reasonably accurate; if anything,\nthe tendency is for respondents to underreport ser-\nvice use (Brown & Adams, 1992; National Center for\nHealth Statistics, 1965). For example, the National\nHealth Interview Survey (National Center for Health\nStatistics, 1965) found the underreporting of informa-\ntion about hospitalizations to be less than 10%. The\nhealth cost estimates are also conservative because\nthey do not include the expense of medications, fees\nfor laboratory and other diagnostic services, disability\ndays, transportation, and the like.\nIn spite of the overall conservative nature of the\ncost estimates, the costs found to be associated with\nwidowhood were sizable. If we multiply the differ-\nence in annual adjusted mean total health costs\nfound between the widowed group and the married\ngroup (adjusted annual estimated difference: $886)\nUnited States each year, the annual difference be-\nWith the rising number of widowed persons, a more\ncomplete accounting of health costs, growing rates of\nhealth insurance coverage [particularly in light of the\nSurgeon General's recommendation for expanded\ncoverage for mental health care (Pear, 1999)], and\nrapidly rising health costs, the health expenses asso-\nciated with widowhood are likely to be markedly\nhigher in years to come.\nEffects of Widowhood on Health Service Use and Costs\nThe results of this study demonstrate that widowed\nrespondents have a greater number of physician visits\nand days spent in a nursing home than do married re-\nspondents. Despite the higher levels of depressive\nsymptoms among the widowed group, widowed sub-\njects were not significantly more likely to visit a psy-\nchiatrist or other mental health professional compared\nto nonwidowed subjects at follow-up. Widowhood\nappeared to have no significant influence on the\nnumber of days spent in a hospital.\nWith respect to health costs, the widowed group\nhad significantly higher mean total costs than did the\nmarried group. This result appears to be a function of\nincreases in physician visits rather than an increase in\nhospital lengths of stay. Although no comparative fig-\nures exist for health care costs associated with wid-\nowhood, prior studies have examined the influence\nof widowhood on health service use. Our results are\nconsistent with studies that have found widowhood\nto be associated with increased use of physician visits\n\"widowhood\" effect on hospital use (Clayton, 1974;\nsults of this study, together with prior research, indi-\ncate that widowed individuals, at least within 3 years\nfollowing the spouse's death, are likely to have\nhigher health costs relative to married individuals,\nprimarily because of their greater number of physi-\ncian visits.\nEffects of Marital Quality on the Impact of Widowhood\nAlthough a number of studies document the health\nbenefits of a satisfying, nonconflictive marriage (Bur-\nrama et al., 1995), little is known about the effects of\nmarital quality on health service utilization and\nhealth costs. The results of this study appear to con-\nfirm these prior reports by extending them to demon-\nstrate the lower costs for physician visits associated\nwith marital harmony in contrast to marital discord.\nFurthermore, because we controlled for potentially\nconfounding influences such as severity of depressive\nsymptoms and life-satisfaction (social support was\nnot found to have a significant confounding effect),\nthe influence of marital discord on higher physician\ncosts cannot be attributed to these other factors. Sim-\nilar to the effects of widowhood, marital harmony did\nnot significantly influence inpatient costs.\nWhen the effects of marital harmony are examined\nin interaction with the effects of widowhood, we find\nthat the quality of the relationship to the deceased\nsignificantly influences the health costs of the surviv-\ning partner. Counter to those who have claimed that\nwidowed individuals who had conflictive marriages\nare more adversely affected by the loss (Freud,\nresults suggest that widowed individuals who had\nharmonious marriages are the group with the poorest\nhealth, and that this translates into increased health\nservice utilization and health costs. These findings\nconcur with studies by Futterman and colleagues\ngest that individuals with good marital quality exhibit\ngreater dysfunction when they become widowed.\nThey are also in agreement with our studies of trau-\nmatic grief in which we have found marriages high in\nmarital quality to be associated with more severe\ntraumatic grief symptomatology (Prigerson et al.,\nbeen proven to be predictive of subsequent decline\nin health as well as adverse health behaviors (Priger-\nprior work demonstrating the connection between\npositive marital quality and greater severity of trau-\nmatic grief symptoms suggests that the influence of\nmarital harmony on health, health service utilization,\nand health care costs may be mediated through\nsymptoms of pathological, or complicated, grief. Be-\ncause the ACL survey did not contain specific assess-\nments of traumatic grief symptomatology, we were\nunable to test this hypothesis explicitly. Future re-\nsearch is needed to test whether traumatic grief\nsymptomatology mediates the relationship between\nbeing widowed after a harmonious marriage and\npoor health. To the extent we are able to identify\nand, ultimately, modify the effects that loss of a con-\ngenial marriage has on health (e.g., by ameliorating\ntraumatic grief symptoms), we may be able to reduce\nthe health costs associated with widowhood. Effica-\ncious interventions would assist in reducing the bur-\nden of spousal loss both for the individual survivor\nand for society as a whole through the reduction of\ndemand on an already strained health care system.\nReferences\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research, Center for Costs and Finan-\ncing Studies.

Rosenheck, MD3,4,6\nyear (Osterweis, Solomon, & Green, 1984), little is\nknown about the impact of widowhood on health\nservice use or health care costs. According to the\nover (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1997). Given the\naging of the U.S. population, there will be a continu-\ning growth in the number and proportion of the pop-\nulation that is widowed.\nNot only are the numbers of late-life widows and\nwidowers rising, but elderly Americans are consum-\ning an increasing amount of health care resources. In\n1995, per capita health care expenditures for Ameri-\ntimes that for people age 65 and under (Agency for\nHealth Care Policy and Research, 1997). As the eld-\nerly population consumes a growing proportion of\nnational health care expenditures, there will be\nmounting interest in determining the factors that con-\ntribute to their use of health services. This study ex-\namined the extent to which widowhood, an event\nmost common in later life, contributes to an increase\nin the use of health services, and the costs with\nwhich they are associated.\nBecause bereavement poses a substantial risk for\nmental and physical health impairments, it seems\nreasonable to expect that widowhood might result in\nincreased health service use and health care costs.\nThe loss of a loved one has been found to heighten\nthe survivor's vulnerability to depressive symptoms\nand episodes of major depression (Bruce, Kim, Leaf,\nserta,1985). Bereavement also has been shown to be\na risk factor for impaired immune function (Bartrop,\nLuckhurst, Lazarus, Kiloh, & Penny, 1977; Irwin,\nDaniels, & Weiner, 1987; Schleifer, Keller, Cam-\nerino, Thornton, & Stein, 1983), neuroendocrine\nsleep disruptions (McDermott et al., 1997), increased\nuse of substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and tran-\nquilizers (Glass, Prigerson, Kasl, & Mendes de Leon,\nity (Helsing & Szklo, 1981; Schaefer, Quesenberry, &\ning number of widows and widowers with compro-\nmised health have the potential to place considerable\ndemands on the health care system, it is important to\nfrom the National Institute on Mental Health and a Claude D.

Parkes (1964) found widows to\nconsult their general practitioner more than three\ntimes as frequently during the 6 months after be-\nreavement than they had prior to bereavement. Clay-\never, concluded that becoming widowed did not\nsignificantly influence patterns of physician or hospi-\ntal utilization. Contrasting rates of health service use\namong those bereaved 4 months with national aver-\nages, Mor, McHorney and Sherwood (1986) found\nthat physician visit rates were somewhat higher but\nthat hospitalization rates were lower among the be-\nreaved in their study than age- and sex-adjusted na-\ntional norms. We were unable to locate a single\nstudy that estimated the health costs associated with\nwidowhood, much less one that prospectively exam-\nined the effects of widowhood on changes in health\ncare utilization and costs, while adjusting for impor-\ntant confounding influences such as age, sex, health\ninsurance coverage, pre-loss mental and physical\nhealth status, socioeconomic status, and health ser-\nvice use.\nWhile marital harmony has consistently demon-\nstrated positive effects on health and well-being (Bur-\nman & Margolin, 1992; Ewart, Burnett, & Taylor,\nrama, Conger, & Lorenz, 1995), results of studies that\nhave examined the influence of marital harmony on\nadjustment to widowhood have been inconsistent.\nThere appear to be two schools of thought concern-\ning the type of relationship to the deceased that\nportends the greatest problems with adjustment to\n(1958), proposed that ambivalent feelings toward the\ndeceased would result in a pathological form of grief\nthat Freud referred to as \"obsessive reproaches\"--a\nform of self-denigration predicated on conflicting\nfeelings about the deceased. Similarly, Parkes and\nWeiss (1983) found that widowed subjects who ret-\nrospectively reported a high degree of conflict with\ntheir spouses had considerably higher levels of anxi-\nety, depression, guilt, and yearning than those who\nreported less conflict in their marriages.\nBy contrast, several studies suggest that marriages\nwith low degrees of conflict and high degrees of close-\nness, consensus, and support are predisposed to\nmore problematic bereavement reactions. Research\nsuggests that complicated, or what we now call\n\"traumatic,\" grief reactions are most strongly associ-\nated with marriages rated as close, supportive, and\nsecurity-increasing (Prigerson et al., 1997b; Priger-\nson, Shear, Frank, Silberman, & Reynolds, 1997c;\nvan Doorn, Kasl, Beery, Jacobs, & Prigerson, 1998).\nBecause traumatic grief has been shown to predict\nmental and physical health impairments as well as\nadverse health behaviors (Prigerson et al., 1995a,\nhypothesize that death in a marriage that was harmo-\nnious might result in greater emotional and physical\ndistress for the surviving spouse, and that this would\ntranslate into an increase in the widowed person's\nuse of health services. McHorney and Mor (1988)\ndemonstrated increased health care utilization among\nthe depressed bereaved (though no differences were\nobserved in service utilization between depressed\nand nondepressed subjects who were not bereaved),\nsuggesting that the emotional distress associated with\nwidowhood may play a mediating role in increased\nservice use. Based on prior studies of traumatic grief,\nwe would expect that widowed individuals who had\nharmonious marriages would be more emotionally\ndistressed than either people who were not widowed\nor those widowed after discordant marriages, and\nthat this would result in poorer health, and increased\nhealth service use and health costs.\nThe present study tests this hypothesis using data\nfrom a two-wave, national probability sampling of\ncommunity-dwelling respondents--the Americans\nChanging Lives (ACL) dataset (House et al., 1990).\nThe ACL survey provided a dataset that minimized\nmany of the methodological limitations common to\nbereavement research (e.g., inadequate sampling,\nlow response rates, failure to include a representative\ncontrol group, retrospective assessments of pre-loss\ninformation such as quality of the marriage, health\nand health service use; Futterman, Gallagher, Thomp-\nson, Lovett, & Gilewski, 1990; Gentry & Shulman,\nPrigerson, & Reynolds, 1998; Stroebe & Stroebe,\n1989). The longitudinal design allowed for a pro-\nspective study of respondents who lost a spouse\nbetween waves, provided a control group of married\nrespondents, as well as pre-loss assessments of func-\ntioning and the quality of the marriage. Details of the\nsample are in the following sections.\nMethods\nStudy Group\nRespondents participated in Americans Changing\nLives (ACL), a longitudinal study of productivity and\nsuccessful aging in the middle and later years of life.\nThe ACL surveyed a nationally representative sample\nof people over the age of 25 living in the continental\nUnited States. The Survey Research Center of the\nUniversity of Michigan conducted a baseline survey\nline response rate yielded a sample of 3,617 respon-\ndents who were interviewed in their homes. Three\nyears later, 2,867 respondents were reinterviewed,\nrepresenting 83% of the respondents at baseline who\nwere still living at the time of the follow-up inter-\nview. Blacks and individuals aged 60 or over were\nsampled at twice the rate of non-Blacks and persons\nunder age 60, respectively. Nonresponse did not vary\nsignificantly by age, race, or other known respondent\ncharacteristics (House et al., 1990). Further informa-\ntion about the ACL study is provided elsewhere\nThe present report focuses only on those who\nwere married and living with their spouse, who had\nnot been widowed previously, and who were age 50\nyears or above at baseline (N  968). Of this group,\n(18.9%) did not participate in the follow-up interview\nstatus other than widowhood between waves, and 25\n(2.6%) had missing data. Those meeting baseline in-\nclusion criteria who did not participate in the follow-\nup assessment (n  183) were significantly older,\nmore likely to be male, and of lower socioeconomic\nstatus than those who were retained in the analyses\n(n  755). They also had significantly higher levels of\ndepressive symptoms, worse functional health, more\nchronic conditions, and lower life-satisfaction than\nthose retained in the analyses. In order to adjust for\nthese differences between analyzed subjects and\nthose lost to follow-up, a term that corrected for sam-\nple selection biases was included in each multivari-\nate model, using the procedure that has been de-\nscribed by Heckman (1979). (See Analyses section.)\nMeasures\nMarital Harmony.--The ACL contained a \"marital\nsatisfaction and harmony\" index composed of items\nfrom scales constructed by Parkes and Weiss (1983)\nand Pearlin and Schooler (1978). We modified this\nscale to include baseline assessments of the degree of\nmarital satisfaction, love, and affection; frequency of\nthoughts of separation/divorce, disagreements, feel-\ning upset by the marriage; extent of agreement with\nstatements that they would \"feel lost without . . .\" and\nthat \"no one could replace\" their spouse; frequency\nwith which the spouse pushed, slapped, or hit the re-\nspondent. The refined measure, compared to the\nACL-provided marital quality index, fit better with\ncontemporary recommendations for such measures\n(e.g., Sabatelli, 1988) because it contained \"objective\ncharacteristics of adjustment such as . . . absence of\nconflict . . . combined with the . . . degree of satisfac-\nInternal consistency (Cronbach's ) for the refined\nmarital harmony measure was 0.67. A median-split\nof the baseline score for marital harmony was used to\ndivide respondents into a marital harmony group (n \nstatistical power afforded by a median-split was ad-\nvantageous for analyses that examined the effects of a\nMarital Harmony  Widowhood status interaction\nterm. It is worth noting that analyses employing a\ncontinuous measure of marital harmony produced\nsimilar effects on health costs to analyses employing\nthe marital harmony\u00admarital discord dichotomy, as\nwill be reported below. We chose to present the re-\nsults for the dichotomous measure of marital quality\nrather than the continuous measure because they ap-\npear easier to interpret.\nHealth Service Utilization.--The ACL contained\nself-reported assessments of the number of nights\nspent in a hospital in the past 6 months, the number\nof days spent in a nursing home over the past 6\nmonths, the number of visits to a medical doctor, and\nthe number of visits to a psychiatrist over the past 3\nmonths. Visits to a physician were doubled to reflect\nuse for a period consistent with that specified for the\nnumber of nights spent in a hospital (i.e., 6 months).\n\"Outpatient\" services refer to psychiatrist and other\nmedical visits; \"inpatient\" services refer to the num-\nber of days spent in a hospital and nursing home.\nHealth Costs.--Health care costs were estimated\nby multiplying the number of units of each service\nused by the estimated unit costs for each type of ser-\nvice. Unit costs for 1989 were derived from national\ndata in the Statistical"
