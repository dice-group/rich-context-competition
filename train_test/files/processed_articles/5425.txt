    "abstract": "Abstract\nDuring the 2016 presidential election campaign in the United States, scholars argued that authoritarian visions of the\nfamily are associated with support for Donald Trump, a candidate also noted to exhibit authoritarian or illiberal tendencies.\nThough it is plausible that \"authoritarian\" citizens (defined by parenting attitudes) vote for \"authoritarian\" candidates\n(defined by disrespect for democratic institutions), past research provides relatively little guide regarding this relationship.\nOne reason is that few US candidates announce overtly authoritarian views. Latin America, by contrast, has had many such\ncandidates. We take advantage of this variation using the 2012 AmericasBarometer, which applied a battery of authoritarian\nparenting attitudes. We first describe mass authoritarianism across Latin America, showing it is associated with many social\nattitudes. We then examine authoritarians' voting behavior, distinguishing between support for \"mano dura\" (\"strong arm\")\ncandidates, who are usually rightists, and for candidates threatening violations of general civil liberties, who are often leftists\nin Latin America. We find that authoritarians tend to vote for right-wing authoritarian candidates, while authoritarianism\nboosts support for candidates threatening civil liberty violations only among citizens identifying on the ideological right.\nEducation is the most consistent determinant reducing support for both leftist and rightist authoritarian candidates.\n",

An apparent implication is that these phe-\nnomena are linked: that \"authoritarian\" citizens--those\nbelieving the home should be structured in a top-down\nfashion with the father as the ultimate authority--support\ncandidates promising to take charge of the national hier-\narchy, at the expense of liberal democratic norms. Yet,\nbecause few presidential candidates have displayed sig-\nnificant illiberal tendencies in recent US elections, there is\nlittle historical evidence regarding whether authoritarian\nparenting attitudes lead US citizens to support candidates\nwith strongman leadership styles.\nLatin America, in contrast, is a region rich with examples\nof strongmen engaging in democratic politics. In some\ncountries (e.g. Honduras, Mexico, Peru), rightist candidates\nhave promoted \"mano dura\" or hardline crime policies calling\nfor an explicit tradeoff between citizens'liberties and national\nsecurity. Leftist leaders in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela\nhave limited press freedoms and civil liberties, and sought to\nreduce institutional checks on executive power. This wide\nrange of authoritarian leaders presents an ideal environment\nfor assessing the effects of authoritarian parenting attitudes.\nWe conceptualize \"authoritarianism\" differently for citi-\nzens and candidates.

Because RWA conflates moral\nconservatism with aggression to outsiders and preference\nHetherington and Weiler, 2009), recent studies use a battery\non child-rearing preferences to capture \"adherence to\nauthority\" independent of conservatism (Stenner 2005). We\nassess mass-level authoritarianism using a measure of\nauthoritarian parenting attitudes.\nAt the elite level, we define authoritarianism not as a\npreference for familial hierarchy, but rather as an attitude of\ndisregard toward liberal democratic protections of citizens'\nrights. We gauge candidates' levels of authoritarianism\nthrough public statements and behavior. Linking both con-\nceptualizations is the core idea that the relevant social\nentity--the family or the state--should have a single, unre-\nstrained leader who is owed obedience.\nAre mass- and elite-level authoritarianism connected?\nRWA is correlated with opposition to civil rights and liber-\nties and support for governmental abuses of power (Duckitt\nian parenting attitudes and RWA are associated with sup-\nport for populists and rightists (Billiet and de Witte, 1995;\nnot linked authoritarian parenting attitudes to support for\ncandidates promoting authoritarian policies. In light of\nscholarly explanations of the 2016 US presidential election,\nthis question has become increasingly salient. Evidence\nfrom Latin America can illuminate whether or not authori-\ntarian voters actually support authoritarian candidates.\nIn Latin America, support for authoritarian leaders has\nbeen explained using standard determinants of presidential\nsupport such as economic performance (Kutiyski and\nKrouwel, 2014) and access to political information (Geddes\nand Zaller, 1989). In contrast to scholars of US political\nbehavior, Latin Americanists have generally conceptual-\nized mass-level authoritarianism not based on parenting\nattitudes, but rather as what we call \"institutional authori-\ntarianism\": disrespect for democracy in the abstract, or for\nparticular institutions such as the judiciary. Individuals who\nare ambivalent toward democratic institutions are more\nreceptive to illegal electoral tactics such as vote buying\n(Carlin and Moseley, 2015) and more supportive of authori-\ntarian leaders (Canache, 2002; Kutiyski and Krouwel,\n2014). However, mass-level institutional authoritarianism\nis different from authoritarian parenting; these dispositions\nmight even be negatively correlated. Because democratic\ninstitutions--or at least, free elections--constitute the sta-\ntus quo in Latin America, citizens who respect authority\nmight feel compelled to voice respect for democracy and\nfor particular institutions. At the elite level, however, there\nis evidence of a positive association--Latin American leg-\nislators expressing hostility to those outside the social order\nare more amenable toward non-democratic government\nSince authoritarian parenting measures have not been\nwidely used in Latin America, we first validate our scale. In\nour main analysis, we ask whether authoritarianism predicts\nsupport for authoritarian presidential candidates in past or\nhypothetical elections, while accounting for ideology. We\nfind that authoritarian citizens tend to vote for right-wing\nauthoritarian candidates.Authoritarianism does boost support\nfor leftist authoritarian candidates, who typically threaten\ncivil liberty violations, but only among citizens on the politi-\ncal right; among centrist and leftist voters, authoritarianism\nis not correlated with support for leftist authoritarian leaders.\nThe most consistent determinant of voting for authoritarian\nleaders is not attitudinal; education reduces support for\nauthoritarian candidates on both the right and left.\nAuthoritarianism in Latin America:\nLevels and convergent validity\nWe begin by examining authoritarian parenting attitudes\nacross Latin America utilizing a three-question battery\nadministered to half of AmericasBarometer 2012 respond-\nents.2 Respondents were asked: \"[T]alking about the qual-\nities that children ought to have, I am going to mention\nvarious characteristics and I would like you to tell me\nwhich one is the most important for a child.\" Paired\nresponse options included, \"Independence\" or \"Respect\nfor adults\"; \"Obedience\" or \"Autonomy (self-sufficiency,\ntaking care of oneself)\"; and \"Creativity\" or \"Discipline.\"\nResponses of \"Independence,\" \"Autonomy,\" and \"Crea-\ntivity\" each received values of 0, while \"Respect for\nadults,\" \"Obedience,\" and \"Discipline\" received values of\n1. Volunteered responses that \"both\" were important were\nscored 0.5. Authoritarian parenting attitudes (abbreviated\nto authoritarianism) is the mean of the three scores, and\nFigure 1 presents mean levels of authoritarianism in the\n18 Latin American countries, plus the United States and\nCanada for reference. Scores were rescaled for just this\nanalysis from 0 to 100. Authoritarianism is lowest in the\ntwo Anglo-North American countries, where means are\nclose to the midpoint. Chile and Argentina have the lowest\nmeans in Latin America, around 66. At the top end, mean\nSalvador and the Dominican Republic.\nAs a first step in investigating the battery's validity, we\nassess non-response and scale reliability (see the\nSupplementary Information). High non-response would\nsuggest that respondents had difficulty understanding the\nquestions or that their responses had failed to match the pre-\ncoded categories. However, on average across the region,\nnon-response on each of the three items is about 1%.\nEcuador has the highest non-response rates, at 2.7, 4.0, and\n4.1%, respectively. Cronbach's alpha calculations are more\nCohen and Smith 3\nconcerning. Reliability coefficients are low in all countries,\nand extremely low in some. This will reduce the magnitude\nof measured effects, biasing against finding statistically sig-\nnificant results.\nDo Latin Americans' responses validly represent a con-\nstruct developed initially in the United States? P\u00e9rez and\nHetherington (2014) show the battery does not predict the\npolitical views of US African Americans. They argue that\nwhile members of the racially dominant group implicitly\nview the polity through a family metaphor, racially subor-\ndinate citizens do not. It is worth investigating, then,\nwhether authoritarian parenting and political attitudes are\nassociated among Latin Americans.\nFigure 2 presents partial correlation coefficients between\nthe authoritarian parenting battery and other behavioral and\nattitudinal measures across the Latin American countries in\nour sample, controlling for country fixed effects (see the\nSupplementary Information for question text). If this bat-\ntery lacks convergent validity, we cannot expect responses\nto predict voting behavior. Two general findings stand out.\nFirst, the battery is indeed associated with theoretically rel-\nevant personal attributes, including political tolerance and\nsupport for media censorship. Second, the correlations are\nlow, despite their statistical significance. We also note a\nmore specific finding: in Latin America, support for social\nwelfare is positively associated with authoritarianism.\nWhile this runs opposite to common wisdom in US politics,\nnew research indicates that personality's effect on eco-\nnomic attitudes is variable and contingent on political con-\ntext (e.g., Johnston et al., forthcoming; Malka et al., 2014).\nFigure 2 also reports the battery's association with two\nmeasures of institutional authoritarianism: support for\ndemocracy in the abstract, and support for the political sys-\ntem. Low support for democracy and low support for exist-\ning democratic institutions would correspond to high\ninstitutional authoritarianism--that is, rejection of demo-\ncratic institutions. Confirming the discussion above,\nauthoritarian parenting is not positively associated with\ninstitutional authoritarianism. It is uncorrelated with sup-\nport for democracy, while it has a small positive correlation\nwith support for the political system.\nDo authoritarians support\nauthoritarians?\nWe turn to the question of whether Latin Americans with\nauthoritarian parenting attitudes tend to favor candidates\nexhibiting authoritarian tendencies. The analysis is limited\nto presidential systems, where authoritarian executives are\nmost common and powerful. We examine both self-\nreported retrospective vote in the most recent election and\nprospective vote \"if the election were this week.\"3 We\ncoded candidate authoritarianism using English- and\nFigure 1. Authoritarian parenting attitudes in Latin America,\nCanada, and the United States.\nFigure 2. Convergent validation: association of authoritarian\nparenting attitudes with other opinion and behavior measures.\n4 Research and Politics \nSpanish-language journalistic accounts of the elections\nprior to and following 2012 AmericasBarometer data col-\nlection, located via Google News and Lexis Nexis searches\n(see Supplementary Materials). We searched for evidence\nof prospective or prior infringement on civil liberties such\nas the freedom of the press. We tracked ties to non-demo-\ncratic regimes or coups--for example, Peruvian candidate\nKeiko Fujimori's link to her father's electoral authoritarian\nregime in the 1990s, or her opponent Ollanta Humala's\ncoup attempt. We also coded support for hardline (mano\ndura) crime enforcement policies threatening civil liber-\nties violations; for instance, militarization of the civilian\npolice, or incarceration of suspects on the basis of physical\ncharacteristics such as tattoos.\nWe coded leaders' left-wing or right-wing orientation\nbased on the self-reported ideological position of support-\ners with high levels of political knowledge, adjusting for\ncountry-level skew in the ideological spectrum. Politicians\nwhose most knowledgeable supporters placed themselves\nto the right of the average citizen were coded as \"right-\nwing\"; those to the left as \"left-wing.\" Most candidates pro-\nmoting hardline policies were rightists, but candidates\npotentially infringing civil liberties tended to be leftists. At\nthe time the poll was conducted, most left-wing authoritar-\nian candidates were incumbents, while the rightists tended\nto be in the opposition.\nTable 1 assesses the association between authoritarian\nparenting attitudes and prior vote for authoritarians.4 The\nfirst, third, and fifth columns present simple logistic regres-\nsion models controlling only for demographics and country\nfixed effects. The second, fourth, and sixth columns add\nother public opinion variables measuring ideology and\n(low) institutional authoritarianism: an indicator for self-\nidentification as rightist (i.e. as 8\u00ad10 on the 1\u00ad10 ideology\nscale); support for democracy in the abstract; and support\nfor the current political system. To aid comparison of coef-\nficients, all variables are standardized on a 0\u00ad1 scale. The\nfirst major finding is that authoritarian parenting attitudes\nare associated with support for authoritarian leaders--but\nonly right-wing leaders. Education decreases voting for\nboth left-wing and right-wing authoritarians. This finding\nis consistent across model specifications. Indeed, the pre-\ndicted probability of having voted for any authoritarian in\nthe previous election drops from .45 for those without\nschooling to .35 for those with higher education, suggesting\nthis variable is key to understanding support for authoritar-\nian candidacies. Supporters of left-wing authoritarians are\nalso less wealthy and of darker skin tone, on average.\nThe second analysis for each dependent variable includes\nattitudinal controls. Coefficients for authoritarian parenting\nattitudes remain essentially unchanged. Not surprisingly,\nself-identified rightists are more likely to vote for right-\nwing authoritarians, and less likely to vote for left-wing\nones. More interestingly, support for democracy in the\nabstract is positively associated with voting for authoritari-\nans. The variable is statistically significant in models\nTable 1. Determinants of voting for left-wing and right-wing authoritarian candidates.\nAll authoritarian leaders Left-wing authoritarian\nleaders\nRight-wing authoritarian\nleaders\nEstimates represent logistic regression coefficients. Country fixed effects not shown. Standard errors in parentheses. Coefficients are significant at\nCohen and Smith 5\nexcluding system support, but becomes statistically\ninsignificant in the full model (see the Supplementary\nInformation). Most strikingly, support for the existing politi-\ncal order is strongly correlated with a left-wing authoritarian\nvote.5 This may be due to reverse-causality: all six left-wing\nauthoritarians analyzed won their respective elections and\nbecame forceful presidents evincing little tolerance for the\nopposition. In majoritarian systems, there are large gaps\nbetween winners and losers in the perceived legitimacy of\nthe political system (Anderson and Guillory, 1997;Anderson\nian nature of these presidential terms, one might expect\npolarization in system support. Nonetheless, it is striking\nthat even among supporters of right-wing authoritarian can-\ndidates, all but one of whom lost, support for democracy and\nthe political system are positively, though not significantly,\nassociated with voting for authoritarians.\nDoes the impact of authoritarianism vary by respondent\nideology? Authoritarians tend to self-identify with the\npolitical right, yet the translation from underlying disposi-\ntions to ideology is far from perfect. Rightists can be non-\nauthoritarian, and authoritarians can identify as centrists\nor leftists. We suspect, however, that non-authoritarian and\nauthoritarian rightists behave differently, with non-authori-\ntarian rightists more strongly opposing left-wing authori-\ntarian leaders. Figure 3 shows the predicted probability\nof supporting left-wing and right-wing authoritarian can-\ndidates, by personal authoritarianism and ideological\nidentification (see the Supplementary Information for full\nmodels, and results incorporating an indicator for leftists).\nWe find a statistically significant interaction between\nauthoritarianism and rightism in predicting support for left-\nwing authoritarians. While rightism consistently reduces\nvoting for left-wing authoritarians, the size of the gap var-\nies across the range of authoritarianism. In other words,\nauthoritarian rightists are willing to put aside their ideologi-\ncal convictions and to support a leader with an authoritarian\nstyle, even though the leader is of the left.\nFinally, we examine prospective support for authoritar-\nian candidates, utilizing a question asking what respond-\nents would do \"if the next election were held this week\":\nvote for the incumbent party or candidate, vote for the\nopposition, abstain, or vote blank/null. We focus on voting\nfor/against incumbents. Opposition support is hard to inter-\npret, since in many countries it was unclear which opposi-\ntion candidates would run, and most elections had multiple\nopposition candidates. We expect authoritarian voters to\nsupport authoritarian incumbents, reflecting their prefer-\nences for order and the status quo.7 Contrary to expecta-\ntions, however, in the Supplementary Information, we\nshow that authoritarianism is not significantly associated\nwith supporting incumbent authoritarians over their oppo-\nnents. This might be due to the fact that the authoritarian\nincumbents in this study were all leftists; recall that author-\nitarianism is not significantly associated with voting for\nleftist authoritarians in the previous analysis.\nFigure 3. Authoritarianism and rightism as determinants of support for authoritarian candidates.\n6 Research and Politics \nIn countries without authoritarian candidates, authori-\ntarians may support rightists. In the United States, for\ninstance, authoritarian parenting attitudes are correlated\nwith Republicanism (Duckitt et al., 2010) though few\nRepublican candidates take overtly anti-democratic\nstances. Figure 4 presents coefficients for the authoritar-\nian parenting battery from multinomial logistic regression\nmodels run in every country.8 The baseline category\nwithin each country is support for the incumbent.\nAuthoritarian parenting attitudes are not significantly\nassociated with prospective vote in most countries. In the\nfew cases where the coefficient of the parenting battery is\nstatistically significant, there are no obvious authoritarian\ncandidates in the previous or following elections. In\nUruguay, for instance, neither then-incumbent President\nJos\u00e9 Mujica nor any conservative opposition party could\nreasonably be termed authoritarian. The same goes for\nthen-incumbent Laura Chinchilla and the center-left\nopposition in Costa Rica. In these cases, authoritarianism\nis associated with rightism, suggesting the political right's\nappeal to those with authoritarian parenting attitudes is\nindependent of candidate stances vis-\u00e0-vis the institu-\ntional democratic order.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nTo answer the question posed in the title, based on observing\n18 Latin American countries: Yes, authoritarians--defined\nby parenting attitudes--do tend to vote for authoritarian\ncandidates--defined by disregard for civil liberties and\ndemocratic checks and balances. The link is strongest when\nright-wing authoritarians run for office, but parenting atti-\ntudes also predict rightist voters' support for left-wing\nauthoritarian candidates. We believe this is because authori-\ntarians gravitate to rightist ideology, which is more consist-\nent with hierarchical values, while only non-authoritarian\nrightists--oftentimes economic liberals--strongly oppose\nleft-wing authoritarians. Authoritarian rightists may be will-\ning to sacrifice their ideological positions in exchange for\nauthoritarian leadership, even if those leaders are on the left.\nIn the prospective vote choice analysis, however, we obtain\nan unexpected result: parenting attitudes are associated with\nsupport for rightist incumbents and opposition to leftists, but\nnot with support for authoritarians, in particular. We cannot\ndetermine why authoritarianism is unassociated with voting\nfor leftist authoritarian incumbents in the present paper,\nthough a few explanations might be possible. Perhaps citi-\nzens with authoritarian dispositions are attracted to the lead-\nership style of leftist authoritarians, yet oppose them on\nideological grounds, leading to an apparent null effect.\nAlternatively, perhaps the result is simply due to problems\nin measuring prospective vote choice.\nTogether, the analyses indicate that--at least in Latin\nAmerica--those with authoritarian parenting attitudes are\nmore strongly attracted to rightists in general than to\npotentially authoritarian candidates. If these results extend\nto the US case, they suggest that the parenting battery's\nassociation with Republicanism--and with support for\nFigure 4. Association of authoritarian parenting attitudes with prospective vote choice within each country.\nCohen and Smith 7\nDonald Trump--might result more from conservative ide-\nology than from any particular authoritarian stances on\ncivil rights or checks on the executive. Still, when leftist\nauthoritarian leaders hold power for extended periods of\ntime (e.g. contemporary Venezuela, or the former Soviet\nBloc), authoritarian citizens might eventually identify as\nFor students of Latin America, the results imply that\ndemocratic legitimacy does not form a bulwark against\nelectoral authoritarianism. Support for authoritarian candi-\ndates is not a product of negative attitudes toward democ-\nracy or existing political institutions. Instead, citizens who\nsupport democracy and the current system may be more\nlikely to choose authoritarians, though the direction of cau-\nsality remains for future study.\nWhat, then, leads citizens to elect authoritarians?\nProponents of liberal democracy should note the consistent\nrole of education. Why does education buffer citizens\nagainst authoritarian claims on the left and right? Perhaps\nthe effect relates to norms conveyed in public classrooms,\nor perhaps to some incidental social advantage. In either\ncase, it appears the \"schools of democracy\" may, in fact, be\nschools.\n"
