Endemic measles transmission was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. To ensure that\nelimination can be maintained, high population immunity must be sustained and monitored.

The highest seroprevalence of measles antibody was in non-Hispanic blacks\n(92.4% [95% CI, 90.8%\u00ad93.9%]) than did the other birth cohorts. Independent predictors of measles seropositivity in\nthe 1967\u00ad1976 birth cohort were non-Hispanic/black race/ethnicity, more than a high school education, having\nhealth insurance, and birth outside the United States.\nConclusions. Measles seropositivity was uniformly high in the US population during 1999\u00ad2004. Nearly all\npopulation subgroups had evidence of measles seropositivity levels greater than the estimated threshold necessary to\nsustain measles elimination. Non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans born during 1967\u00ad1976 had the lowest\nmeasles seropositivity levels and represent populations that might be at increased risk for measles disease if the virus\nwere reintroduced into the United States.\nMeasles is a highly infectious disease that can cause rash,\nfever, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Al-\nthough measles is endemic in most of the world, in\nMarch 2000 the ongoing transmission of measles virus\nwas declared to be eliminated in the United States, an\nachievement attributed to the success of the vaccination\nprogram [1]. Measles vaccine was introduced in the\nUnited States during 1963. The vaccination program\nconsisted of routine vaccination of infants and immuni-\nzation of all susceptible children either when they en-\ntered school or at other places of congregation; however,\nschool immunization laws started in all states during\n1981. Although school immunization requirements\nwere extremely effective in reducing measles in school-\nchildren, a single dose of measles vaccine was not suffi-\ncient to prevent transmission in all settings. Therefore, a\nsecond dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) for\nschool-age children was recommended during 1989 [2].\nThe increase of vaccination coverage of children 19\u00ad35\ncreased second-dose coverage of children in all grades, as\nrecommended by the Advisory Committee on Immuni-\nzation Practices during 1998 [3], led to a dramatic de-\ncrease in the incidence of measles, which has been 1\nhave been associated with importations of the disease\n[4\u00ad6].

Mathematical models have estimated that the\nherd immunity threshold necessary to interrupt measles trans-\nmission in the United States is 93%\u00ad95% [8]. Data from\nNHANES III demonstrated that many population subgroups\nhad prevalence estimates below this level and could therefore\nsustain a measles outbreak if the virus was reintroduced. To con-\ntinue to monitor measles serostatus in the US population, testing\npresent study considers the seroprevalence of measles antibody\nin participants who were 6\u00ad49 years of age during these survey\nyears, to assess national immunization efforts and to reassess\nwhether any deficiencies in the levels of measles antibody still\nexist in parts of the US population.\nMETHODS\nSurvey design and participants. The NHANES is conducted\nby the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), to provide national statistics on\nthe health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized ci-\nvilian population through household interviews, standardized\nphysical examinations, and the collection of biologic samples in\nspecial mobile examination centers [9]. In 1999, NHANES be-\ncame a continuous survey, with data release every 2 years. The\nsampling plan for the survey was a stratified, multistage,\nprobability-cluster design, to provide a sample that is represen-\ntative of the US population [9]. Black Americans, Mexican\nAmericans, adolescents, and low-income persons were sampled\nat higher frequencies than were other participants, to provide\nstable estimates for these groups.\nSerum samples from participants 6\u00ad49 years of age were\navailable for testing for the presence of measles antibody. Race/\nethnic group was categorized on the basis of a subject's self-\nidentification as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or\nMexican American. Subjects who did not fit into one of these\ncategories were classified as \"other\" and were analyzed with the\ntotal population but not in terms of a separate racial/ethnic sub-\ntest results include (1) family income based on a poverty-index\nratio, calculated by dividing total family income by the poverty-\nthreshold index adjusted for family size at year of the interview\nand categorized as either below the poverty level (1) or at or\nabove the poverty level (1) [10]; (2) birthplace, categorized as\nwithin or outside the United States; (3) health insurance, cate-\ngorized as any or none; and (4) regular health-care provider,\ndefined as at least 1 regular source of health care. For those\n20\u00ad49 years of age, education was measured as last year of\nschool completed and was categorized into 3 levels (less than\nhigh school graduate, high school graduate, and more than a\nhigh school education); marital status was grouped as ever or\nnever married.\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants, and the\nEthical Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics\nof the CDC approved the protocol.\nLaboratory testing. Levels of measles IgG antibody were\nmeasured by an in-house enzyme immunoassay that used a ly-\nsate of measles virus\u00adinfected human fetal diploid lung cells\n(HFDL) as the viral antigen and a lysate of uninfected HFDL\nfrom the same passage as the control antigen (California State\nDepartment of Public Health) [11]. All sera were tested at a sin-\ngle dilution of 1:200. Measles serostatus was determined by using\nan index that was calculated by subtracting the absorbance of\ncontrol-antigen wells from the mean optical-density value of the\nduplicate viral-antigen wells and dividing the result by the pre-\ndetermined cutoff value, which was defined as the mean  3 SD\nabsorbance obtained for a large number of sera that tested neg-\native for measles by immunofluorescent-antibody and plaque re-\nduction\u00adneutralization assays. An index value 1.0 was consid-\nered to be an indication of the presence of measles antibody.\nStatistical analysis. To assess the seroprevalence of measles\nantibody in the study population overall, participants were\ngrouped into cohorts based on birth years, to capture difference\nover time, in measles-antibody response to change in vaccina-\ntion policies. To ensure that there was a sufficient sample size for\neach group, participants were grouped into the following birth\nEstimates of seroprevalence were weighted to represent the total\ncivilian noninstitutionalized US household population and to\naccount for oversampling and nonresponse to the household\ninterview and physical examination [12].

Estimates were considered to\nbe unstable if the relative SE around the proportion of partici-\npants who were not seropositive for measles IgG antibody was\n30%; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated by an\nexact binominal method for calculation of CIs [14]. Differences\nbetween seroprevalences were evaluated by examination of P\nvalues calculated by a univariate t statistic obtained from a gen-\neral linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN; P  .05 was consid-\nered to be significant.\nTo identify independent predictors of measles seropositivity\nin the birth cohort that had the lowest seroprevalence of measles\nat greater risk for infection--a backward stepwise logistic mod-\neling procedure in SUDAAN was used, where a P  .05 from\nthe Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic was considered to be signif-\nicant.

Although any population\nthat has measles-seronegative individuals regardless of history of\nimmunization can experience an outbreak [19] and lower im-\nmunity levels may be sufficient in less dense populations [20],\nthis birth cohort represents a population with an increased num-\nber of measles-seronegative individuals who might be at in-\nTable 1.

Higher education, which is an indicator\nof socioeconomic status, and health insurance were predictors of\nseropositivity for measles antibody in this birth cohort, even af-\nter adjustment for race/ethnicity, and other studies [21, 22] have\nfound these variables to be associated with higher vaccination\ncoverage.\nIn all birth cohorts, the seroprevalence of measles antibody\nwas significantly higher in non-Hispanic blacks than that in\nnon-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, difference that\nremained regardless of the vaccination era and that probably\nrepresents natural infection during the era before the federal\nmeasles-elimination program and the early implementation of\nthe measles-vaccination program. The measles epidemic during\ncidence in nonwhite children [24]. Because participants were\nnot asked whether they had ever had measles, the present study's\ndata cannot be used to assess the reason for this significantly\nhigher seropositivity for measles in non-Hispanic blacks.\nRoutine vaccination for measles began in Mexico in 1973\n[23]. In the present study, foreign-born Mexican Americans\nwho were born after that year (i.e., 1977 or later) had lower\nseropositivity for measles antibody than did US-born Mexican\nAmericans. This difference may be due to lower vaccination\nrates in the foreign-born population and reduced circulation of\nmeasles in Mexico, as a result of the initiation of the vaccination\nprogram.\nIn 1994, the Vaccines for Children Program, a national initia-\ntive that entitled uninsured or underinsured children to free vac-\ncine, was launched [25]. This initiative, along with the change to\nthe 2-dose measles-vaccination schedule [26] and the increas-\ningly successful school immunization laws [27], coincides with\nthe consistently high levels of seroprevalence of measles anti-\nbody, in all race/ethnic groups, that were achieved during the\nThe present study has several limitations.

Partici-\npants in the present study were not asked whether they had ever\nhad measles, and MCV vaccination status was not recorded;\ntherefore, the relationship between changes in the seropreva-\nlence of measles antibody and vaccinations programs is specula-\ntive.
