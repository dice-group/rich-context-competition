    "abstract": "Abstract\nAttitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) are known predictors of IPV victimization and perpetration with more\nwomen generally believed to justify IPV than men. An understanding of the determinants of justification of IPV may provide\ninformation necessary for holistic interventions. This study sought to examine the magnitude, extent, and predictors of\njustification of physical IPV against women among men and women in Nigeria. Data from 33,385 women and 15,486 men\nfrom the 2008 Nigerian demographic and health surveys were analyzed using chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions.\nResults show that although larger proportions of women justified physical IPV, certain categories of men such as poor,\nilliterate men, and men with secondary education justified abuse more than women. Contrary to expectations, access\nto radio/TV increased the odds of justifying abuse among women thus casting doubts on program content. The gender\ndifferences observed for predictors of attitudes to physical IPV suggest a need for gender-tailored interventions to change\nattitudes toward partner violence in Nigeria.\n",

Recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates\nshow that while the prevalence of physical IPV (such as wife\nbeating) and sexual IPV in high-income countries is up to\n23.2%, prevalence from low- and middle-income countries\namong ever-partnered women lie from 24.6% in the Western\npacific region to as much as 36.6% in the African region\nThere are many individual-level risk factors associated\nwith IPV victimization, for example, being of a young age,\nlow or no education, financial dependence on a partner,\nunemployment, and alcohol use (Jewkes, 2002; Uthman,\nLawoko, & Moradi, 2009). One risk factor that is currently\ngaining more focus in research is attitude toward IPV.\nSubstantial evidence suggesting associations between IPV\njustification and exposure (Abramsky et al., 2011) imply a\nneed for understanding attitudes in especially middle and\nlow-income countries. Again, research coming from Africa\nshows that men and women may vary in their attitude to IPV\nA number of theories have been put forward to explain\nthe existence of tolerant attitudes. One of them is the nor-\nmalization theory which is a feministic theory that describes\nthe continuous shifting of boundaries until acts of violence\ngradually take on a new meaning (Lundgren, 1993;\nLundgren, Heimer, Westerstrand, & Kalliokoski, 2001).\nThe woman primarily sees the man's violence as an inter-\npretation of her own failure. Normalization includes all\nkinds of assumptions that portray male violence within inti-\nmate relationships as normal. Examples of assumption are\nthose arising from the practice of patriarchy and the\n1University of G\u00e4vle, Sweden\n2Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden\n3Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nLeah Okenwa-Emegwa, Department of Occupational and Public Health\nSciences, University of G\u00e4vle, Kungsb\u00e4cksv\u00e4gen 47, 801 76 G\u00e4vle, Sweden.\nEmail: lehema@hig.se\nAttitudes Toward Physical Intimate\nPartner Violence Against Women in\nNigeria\nLeah Okenwa-Emegwa1, Stephen Lawoko2 and Bjarne Jansson3\n Keywords\nviolence, justification, women, men, attitudes\n2 SAGE Open\nmisconception that violence is a normal part of a romantic\nrelationship. Normalization theory provides a framework\nfor understanding the misconceptions that violence is a\nmarginal problem practiced under special circumstances\n(such as alcohol influence), directed at certain types of\nwoman and practiced by certain categories of men\nUnlike the normalization theory, the social learning the-\nory suggests that individuals learn and adopt behaviors\nwhich they have observed among their role models\ntheory, learning is a cognitive process occurring within a\nsocial context through observation or direct instruction.\nThe extent and magnitude of what is learned is reinforced\nby rewards (of socially acceptable behaviors) or punish-\nment (of socially unacceptable behaviors) during the learn-\ning process. Social norms and gender roles in a patriarchal\nsociety, for instance, are learned within social groups and\ntransmitted from generation to generation. The social con-\nstruction of gender which gives rise to specific defined\nideas about what women and men are and what roles they\nplay in a society is in many ways reinforced by the social\nlearning theory. Gender is thus an achieved status, con-\nstructed through psychological, cultural, and social means\nAlthough some studies in Sub-Saharan Africa have\nattempted to understand factors associated with justification\nof wife beating among women (Husnu & Mertan, 2015;\nUthman et al., 2009), factors associated with such justifica-\ntion among men have not received equivocal attention in\nresearch. There are two main rationales for this study, first is\nthat comparing the risk factors for IPV justification between\nmen and women may prove vital in designing intervention\nthat focus on attitudinal change for both the perpetrators and\nvictims of wife abuse. Second is that although IPV is justi-\nfied by both men and women, there appears to be a general\nclaim that more women than men justify IPV and other\nharmful gender-based harmful practices against women\nis known about differences n attitudes between men and\nwomen in Nigeria.\nThe main aim of this study, therefore, is to examine the\nmagnitude and extent of justification of physical IPV against\nwomen and its predictors among women and men in Nigeria.\nA second objective is to study the relationship between expo-\nsure to IPV and attitudes to wife beating among women.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nThis study is based on the Nigerian Demographic and Health\nSurvey (NDHS) of 2008. The DHS is a U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID)-funded survey carried\nout in many developing countries. These surveys are done on\na 5-yearly basis with the purpose of monitoring demographic\nand health situation of the countries. The sampling method is\ndone such that data collected is nationally representative.\nEthical approval for the instruments and survey procedure is\ngranted by the Institutional review board of the opinion\nresearch corporation Macro International. The 2008 Nigerian\nDHS was conducted in conjunction with the Nigerian National\nPopulation Commission (NPC [Nigeria] & ICF Macro, 2009).\nSampling Design\nThe NDHS covers a nationally representative sample of\nPopulation and Housing Census of the Federal Republic of\nNigeria. Administratively, Nigeria is divided into states.\nEach state is subdivided into local government areas (LGAs),\nand each LGA is divided into localities. In addition to these\nadministrative units, each locality was subdivided into con-\nvenient areas called census enumeration areas (EAs) during\nthe 2006 Population Census. The primary sampling unit\n(PSU), referred to as a cluster for the 2008 NDHS, is defined\non the basis of EAs from the 2006 EA census frame. The\n2008 NDHS sample was selected using a stratified two-stage\nand 602 in the rural areas. Of the representative sample of\nobtained, that is, 30,070 household were successfully inter-\nviewed. There was no difference in response rate between\nrural and urban participants.\nUsing equal probability sampling, an average of 41 house-\nholds were selected in each cluster during Stage 2. All\nwomen aged between 15 and 49 years, resident or visiting\nthe selected households on the night before the survey, were\neligible to be interviewed. All men aged 15 to 59 years, resi-\ndents visiting a subset of half of the selected households on\nthe night before the survey, were eligible to be interviewed.\nFor questions on domestic violence, a subsample of one eli-\ngible woman in each household was randomly selected to\nrespond to questions on exposure to IPV. The questionnaire\nwas administered in strict compliance of the WHO ethical\nand safety recommendation for research on domestic vio-\nParticipants\nresponded (response rate 96.5%). The domestic violence\nmodule was administered on a subsample made up of one\nrandomly selected eligible woman in each household. This\nway, a subsample of 21,468 women responded to the domes-\ntic violence module (used here to explore the second part of\nthe study objective). In a subsample of half of the house-\ninterviewed giving rise to a response rate of 92.6%.\nOkenwa-Emegwa and Lawoko 3\nQuestionnaire\nA comprehensive questionnaire covering demographic and\nhealth issues was administered to eligible men and women.\nThe aspects covered include women's background, repro-\nductive health, access to reproductive health facilities, fertil-\nity preferences, child care and nutrition, child mortality,\nawareness of and precaution against sexually transmitted\ndiseases, marriage and sexual behavior, gender roles,\nempowerment factors (e.g., autonomy in the household and\naccess to information), and IPV. For this study, the questions\non attitudes to wife beating, domestic violence empower-\nment factors, and sociodemographic factors were of primary\ninterest. However, questions on exposure to partner violence\nwere administered to only women.\nMeasures\nDependent variable\nAttitudes to physical IPV.\nThis was assessed using\nresponses to five hypothetical situations. These questions are\ncommonly used in Africa in this field of research (Kenyan\nprobe whether physical IPV (defined in this study as wife\nbeating) is okay in the following scenarios: if the wife goes\nout without informing husband, neglects the children, argues\nwith her partner, refuses to have sex with partner, or cooks\nbad food/or food is served late. Answer options were yes, no,\nor don't know). An affirmative response to one or several\nof these questions was considered having a tolerant attitude\ntoward wife beating, while a \"no\" response on all five situ-\nations denoted a non-tolerant attitude. This categorization is\nin line with recent discussion of achieving \"zero-tolerance\"\nof violence against women.\nIndependent variables\nSociodemographic variables. These included the following:\nage 15 to 49, for both women and men; literacy (1 = can read\nlittle or nothing, 2 = can read whole sentences); religion\n(1 = Catholic, 2 = other Christian, 3 = Muslim, 4 = Tradi-\ntional, 5 = Other); ethnicity (1 = Hausa/Fulani, 2 = Yoruba,\n3 = Ibo, 4 = Others); wealth index (1 = poorest, 2 = poor\nclass, 3 = least poor); region (1 = north central, 2 = north-\neast, 3 = northwest, 4 = southeast, 5 = southwest, 6 = south),\nand place of residence (1 = urban, 2 = rural).\nWealth index.Constructed from the household's owner-\nship of goods and facilities (coded as 1 = poorest, 2 = poor,\n3 = least poor), is used as a proxy for economic status. Asset\ninformation was collected in the 2008 NDHS on household\nownership of a number of consumer items, such as televi-\nsion, bicycle, or car. Information about dwelling character-\nistics such as source of drinking water, type of sanitation\nfacilities, and type of material used in flooring were col-\nlected. Each household was assigned a score from each asset,\nand the scores were summed for each household; individuals\nwere ranked according to the total score of the household\nin which they resided. The sample was then divided into\nquintiles, from one to five. The level of wealth index ranges\nfrom the first to the fifth quintile, corresponding to the least\nand most well-off, respectively. For this study, the first two\nquartiles were merged to form one group, poorest, the middle\nquartile formed the group \"poor\" while the last 2 quartiles\nwere merged to form one group, least poor.\nEmpowerment indicators.These included the following:\naccess to information, assessed by a woman's frequency\nof reading newspapers, listening to radio, or watching TV;\nresponse (coded as 1 = not at all, 2 = less than once a week,\n3 = at least once a week, 4 = almost every day). Decision\nautonomy, assessed by asking respondents who in the house-\nhold had the final say on household expenditures, health\ncare, and household purchase with the following response\noptions (coded as 1 = woman only/woman and her husband,\n2 = husband or husband and someone else).\nExposure to IPV. One of the independent variables used in the\nwomen's analysis, was assessed using a modified version of\nthe Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS; Straus & Gelles, 1990),\nwhich assesses whether participants have, since the age of 15\nyears and during the past 12 months, experienced abuse per-\npetrated by the current husband/partner. Experience of IPV\nin the past 12 months was of primary interest for this study.\nExposure to Physical IPV in the past year was operational-\nized as being slapped, kicked, bitten, pushed, punched,\nchoked, burnt on purpose, or assaulted using a knife or other\nweapons during the past year (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes).\nExposure to Sexual IPV in the past year was operationalized\nas having been physically forced to have sexual intercourse\nwhen she did not want to; degrading or humiliating sexual\nacts, or engaging in sexual intercourse out of fear in the past\nyear (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes). Exposure to Psychological\nIPV in the past year was operationalized as having been\nexposed to verbal abuse, insults, made to feel bad about one-\nself, belittled in front of other people, scared or intimidated,\nthreatened with violence or threats to harm loved ones, and\nso on in the past year (coded as 1 = no, 2 = yes).\nStatistical Analyses\nData impute and analysis was done using the SPSS program\nVersion 15.0. Missing data were relatively low and were thus\nanalyzed simply as missing. The foregoing implies that no\nmeasures such as substituting missing data with the national or\nsample average were taken in the analysis. No measures were\ntaken to, for example, substitute with the national/sample aver-\nage, common practices when data sets are relatively small. Chi-\nsquare test was used to assess for crude associations between\ndependent and independent variables. The independent contri-\nbution of the explanatory variable in explaining attitudes\n4 SAGE Open\ntoward wife beating was assessed using multiple logistic\nregression as a measure to control for potential confounders.\nDirection and magnitude of associations were expressed as\nadjusted odds ratio (OR), and the contribution of each set of\nvariables (i.e., sociodemographic, empowerment indicators\nand IPV exposure) was expressed in terms of R2. The signifi-\ncance level was set at p < .05 for all statistical analysis.\nResults\nAs shown in Table 1, significantly more women than men\nwould justify physical IPV in all the scenarios indicated.\nSimilarly, more women than men justified abuse for at least\none of the stated reason. For both men and women, two sce-\nnarios most likely to lead to justification of physical IPV\nwere if the wife went out without telling her husband and if\nshe neglected the children.\nProportions of Women Justifying Physical IPV by\nSociodemographic Factors, Access to Information,\nAutonomy and Exposure to IPV\nAs indicated in Table 2, proportions of women and men\nendorsing physical IPV varied according to demographic\nfactors, access to information and autonomy indicators.\nEndorsement of physical IPV increased with increasing age\namong men and women. For both women and men, higher\nnumbers endorsed physical IPV among the illiterate, low-\neducated, rural residents and those of traditional religions.\nAmong women, the endorsement physical IPV was most\nprevalent in the Hausa/Fulani ethnic group and women liv-\ning in the North Western region. Physical IPV justification\namong men was most prevalent in the Ibo/other ethnic groups\nand men residing in the North eastern region. Men and\nwomen living in households where women lacked autonomy\nin domestic decisions were more likely to endorse wife beat-\ning and physical IPV. Among both men and women, the pro-\nportion endorsing IPV reduced with increasing wealth and\naccess to information. Finally, women exposed to IPV more\noften than un-exposed peers endorsed physical IPV.\nFactors Associated With Attitudes Toward Wife\nBeating: Adjusted Estimates\nBlock 1: Social demographic indicators. From Table 3, it can\nbe seen that after controlling for other variables within the\nmodel, an inverse relationship was observed for the age\nvariable, that is, increasing levels of justification with\ndecreasing age for both males and females. The likelihood\nof endorsing wife abuse tended to decrease with increasing\nage quite opposite to what was observed in Table 1. Justifi-\ncation of wife beating also reduced with increasing levels\nof education for both men and women. Urban settlement\nand belonging to the rich quintile reduced the likelihood of\nendorsing wife abuse among both men and women. Belong-\ning to ethnic Yoruba or Igbo groups reduced the likelihood\nof justifying wife abuse when compared with other ethnic\ngroups. Contrasting with peers from the south western\nregion, men and women from the north eastern, south east-\nern, and south regions exhibited a higher likelihood of jus-\ntifying abuse. Religion did not affect significantly the\nlikelihood of justifying abuse among both women and men.\nSociodemographic indicators accounted for 9% and10% of\nthe variation in justification of IPV among women and\nmen, respectively.\nBlock 2: Access to information and autonomy in decision\nmaking.Although increasing access to information via news-\npapers/magazines increased the likelihood of justifying\nphysical IPV among men, justification of abuse tended to\nincrease with frequent access to such media among women.\nListening to radio, however, was associated with an increased\nlikelihood of justifying abuse among women but with a\nreduced likelihood among men. Men and women living in\nhouseholds where husband had full autonomy in household\ndecisions reported a higher likelihood of justifying abuse\nthan peers living in household with shared autonomy or\nhousehold with women having full autonomy. Access to\ninformation and autonomy indicators accounted for about\n10% and 12% of the variation in justification of IPV among\nwomen and men, respectively.\nTable 1.

Exposure to physical and sexual IPV\namong women was associated with an increased likelihood\nof justifying wife abuse. Exposure to IPV accounted for\nabout 11% of the variation in justification of IPV among\nwomen.\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined the magnitude, extent, and\ndeterminants of justification of physical IPV against women\namong males and females in Nigeria. After controlling for\nother sociodemographic and economic characteristics,\nresults show overall justification of abuse higher among\nwomen than among men. This observation is consistent with\ndata from other Sub-Saharan and other context (Rani et al.,\nfrom this study also show that whereas more women than\nmen will justify abuse for at least one hypothetical scenario,\nthere are strong indications that more men than women jus-\ntify abuse in certain circumstances. Although the reasons for\nthe above observations are not exactly clear, the social learn-\ning theory provides a framework within which the observa-\ntions can be explained. For example, justification of abuse\nobserved in this study was significantly higher in younger\nage groups among men and women but higher among men in\nrespectively) than women of same age groups (OR = 1.370\nand 1.278, respectively). The explanation may lie in the\nsocial learning theory, i.e. young people learn and accept the\nphysical abuse of women as punishment for bad behavior.\nSimilar findings among younger have been found in other\nConsidering that there is contradictory trend of less justifi-\ncation with increasing age seen in this study, the high rates of\njustification of abuse among younger people may indeed be a\nclear indication of an effective system of transfer of traditional\nvalues to younger generation simply to keep in line with tradi-\ntion and not because the older custodians truly believe in what\nthey are handing down. Low levels of justification of abuse\nwere also observed among men and women in urban settings\ncompared with rural settings. This is in line with findings by\nothers (Faramarzi, Esmailzadeh, & Mosavi 2005; WHO,\nlevels of justification of abuse in urban and rural settings\nobserved by Rani et al. (2004). Studies have, however, shown\nthat having a rural upbringing is as much an important deter-\nminant as living in rural settings.\nHaj-Yahia (2000) argues that many victims of IPV are\nconditioned to justify abuse to secure sustenance for them-\nselves and their children. Findings from the present study\nregarding economy is in line may be explained in part by this\nargument. The reward and punishment system is again seen\nhere because there is evidence that women without strong\nmeans of livelihood fare poorly when they challenge norms\nof male dominancy by leaving the violent partner (Haj-\nYahia, 2000). This is also explainable by the normalization\ntheory with the women interpreting partner's violence as an\nindication of her failure and learns to consider it as normal.\nAlthough the social learning theory explains learning by\nobservation, Rani et al. (2004) explain that as women gain\neducation, employment, and thereby financial freedom, the\nmyth of male superiority becomes directly or indirectly chal-\nlenged resulting in a conflict between reality and myth.\nFemale participants in this study with secondary or higher\neducation, with better wealth index, and who had certain\nautonomy in decision making were least likely to justify\nphysical IPV.Among the men, however, justification of abuse\namong men increased with increasing education up to sec-\nondary level. The odds for justification of abuse were com-\nparatively higher among men than women in categories such\nas men with secondary education, illiterate, and those with\npoorer wealth index. This corroborates previous findings\nshowing a social gradient in attitudes toward wife beating\n(Lawoko, 2008). Because the aforementioned factors are\nwell-known indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), a lot\ncan be deduced from this finding. For example, Men are more\nlikely to resort to intimate partner violence when their tradi-\ntional status of economic and social superiority is threatened\nOkenwa-Emegwa and Lawoko 7\nTable 3.

The justification of\nphysical IPV seen in these groups of men must be addressed\nrather than resting on the general assumption that women jus-\ntify abuse more than men. Ethnic Yoruba and Igbo partici-\npants had a lower likelihood of endorsing wife abuse\nsupporting the notion that some ethnic groups may be less\ngender restrictive than others.\nThe association between indicators of access to informa-\ntion and endorsement of wife abuse were in some cases con-\ntradictory. In the case of newspaper reading, the finding is in\nthe expected direction, that is, women who do not read news-\npapers are more likely to justify abuse. On the contrary, with\nincreasing frequency of listening to radio and watching tele-\nvision, there was an increased tendency to justify wife beat-\ning among women, but a reduced tendency among men.\nGiven the above findings, the role of mass media as a means\nof information and empowerment against violence against\nwomen becomes questionable. The Nigeria film is acclaimed\nas the largest in Africa, it was reported by the UN news cen-\nter as having surpassed Hollywood and Bollywood in terms\nsome researchers and activists in the field of violence against\nwomen have raised concerns regarding the content of Nigeria\nfilms and television dramas (Adewoye, Odesanya,Abubakar,\nemphasize traditional beliefs and gender stereotyping,\nthereby reinforcing existing gender inequalities. These pro-\ngrams are often packaged in a manner intended for women to\nlearn lessons about the consequences of non-conformity\nwith women themselves championing these opinions. For\nexample, Adewoye et al., in a 2014 analysis of Nigerian\nmovie content, found that educated, successful career women\nwere often depicted as insubordinate to their husbands and\nuncaring of their children.\nThe lower likelihood of men who watch TV less than\nonce a week to justify physical IPV against women com-\npared with those who watch almost every day further cast\nquestions on program content. On the contrary, the tendency\nfor men who listen to radio more frequently to be less sup-\nportive of wife beating may be suggestive of other factors.\nFor example, considering that this is contrary to the findings\namong women, it may be that men and women differ in their\nchoice of radio programs. This may have implications for\nresearch and practice. In research, for example, it may no\nlonger be enough to ask only about access to information,\nasking about program preference may provide useful infor-\nmation. For practice, it can no longer be assumed that\nimproved access to information will contribute in changing\nattitudes to IPV. The need for improving program content\nthrough collaborating with stakeholders (e.g., film makers\nand sponsors) may prove important for evidence base\ninterventions.\nThe current study also assessed the association between\nexposure to IPV and attitudes toward physical IPV defined\nhere as wife beating. Women experiencing physical and sex-\nual abuse exhibited a higher likelihood of endorsing abuse,\nsupporting the social learning theory discussed previously.\nAnother plausible explanation could stem from the fact that\nrepeated abuse may diminish a woman's self-esteem and\nthereby increase her propensity to blame herself for whatever\nIndependent variable Women: OR (CI) p value Men: OR (CI) p value\nWatches TV\nAutonomy in decision making\n Husband only \nPhysical IPV\nSexual IPV\nEmotional IPV\nNote.

At that\npoint, the foundation has been set to justify any action to\n\"punish\" transgression from her normative roles. The psy-\nchosocial impact of conditioned abuse and how this may\nimpact on attitudes toward abuse deserves attention in the\nresearch.\nIn conclusion, findings from this study show that Nigeria\ndoes not differ from most other low country setting where\nmore proportions of women than men have been found to\njustify abuse. However, more men than women justify physi-\ncal IPV when specific factors, for example, wealth index and\neducational level are examined. Attitudes toward physical\nIPV varied across different sociodemographic factors, access\nto information and autonomy in decision making as well as\nexposure to IPV. These findings may prove useful in design-\ning interventions to confront IPV with focus on groups at\nrisk. Another potential contribution of the findings from this\nstudy is the likelihood to start discussions regarding the con-\ntribution of Nigerian media programs in propagating female\nsubmission and male dominance.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe strength of this study lies in its large, nationally repre-\nsentative data sets based on good sampling procedures.\nThese have been gathered in strict adherence to ethical\nstandards for domestic violence research ensuring women's\nsafety (WHO, 2001). One limitation is that the analysis of\nsecondary data generally places a limitation to the extent to\nwhich factors can be explored. For example, measure of\nattitudes to IPV captures only women's normative roles in\nthe domestic arena. Other plausible motivating factors for\nIPV such as women's participation in income generating\nactivity, education, husband's drunkenness, to mention but\na few, are not incorporated in the measurement of attitudes\nto IPV. Broader measures including the above-mentioned\nvariables are necessary as they have been previously proven\nto play roles in explaining IPV (Hoffman, Demo, &\nMontgomery, 2004). Another limitation comes from face-\nto-face interviews. Participants may tend to underreport atti-\ntudes when contrasted with responses from self-administered\nquestionnaires. This, however, may have been improved by\nthe use of trained personal and the guarantee of anonymity\nwhich are part of ethical issues surrounding research in this\nfield.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbramsky, T., Watts, C.
