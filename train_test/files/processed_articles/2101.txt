The\nmajor psychoactive CB is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) whose effect is mediated through the CB1 and\nthe CB2 subtypes of CB receptors found in the brain and\nlymphoid tissues.4 The endocannabinoids, a group of\nneuromodulatory lipids also bind to these receptors.5\nCannabis, THC and other CBs have been shown to have\nboth beneficial6 and detrimental effects.7 Marijuana\nusers have higher caloric intake while eating less\nnutrient-rich foods,8 yet have similar8 or slightly lower9\nbody mass index (BMI) than non users.\nWe hypothesised that the prevalence of DM would be\nreduced in marijuana users due to the presence of one\nor more CBs because of their immunomodulatory and\nanti-inflammatory properties.4 We assessed the associa-\ntion between DM and marijuana use among adults\naged 20e59 years in a national sample of the general\npopulation.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nThe study included participants of the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III),10\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNHANES III used a highly stratified multistage proba-\nbility sampling (total N\u00bc39 695) and employed over-\nsampling of the older people (N\u00bc2273), non-Hispanic\nDescriptions of the survey, sampling procedures\nand details of the laboratory tests evaluated can\nbe found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prev-\nention website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/\nnh3rrm.htm#refman).\nWe limited the analysis to adults aged 20e59 years, as\nthose <20 years did not have plasma glucose testing and\nonly participants up to 60 years old were asked about\nmarijuana use. In addition, we excluded those with\nmissing laboratory data. The total analytic sample was\n10 896 adults (complete data for marijuana use and\nDM). Subjects with missing data for the laboratory vari-\nables (n\u00bc2769) were excluded, and the number for the\nfinal model was 8127 adults. A flow diagram showing the\nnumber of subjects selected and reasons for exclusion is\nlisted in supplement figure 1.\nStudy variables\nData on marijuana use were collected by self-report.\nNon-marijuana users included never users (n\u00bc6667) and\nthose who reported ever having used marijuana, but who\nhad not used marijuana in the past month (ie, past\nusers) (n\u00bc3346). We classified participants who reported\nusing marijuana in the past month by frequency of use as\neither light current users (#4 days per month (n\u00bc557))\nor heavy current users ($5 days per month (n\u00bc326)) as\npreviously described.9 The definition of marijuana for\npurposes of this survey includes `hash,' `pot' or `grass' or\nany other references to the Cannabis plant. The phrase\n`used marijuana' refers to either smoking or ingesting\nmarijuana.\nSubjects were defined as having DM if they answer `yes'\nto the question `Have you ever been told you have\nsugar/diabetes?' (n\u00bc525) or had a fasting blood glucose\nDM, 418 answered the question about whether they take\ninsulin and 116 reported that they do take insulin. Of\nthose, nine reported that they began using insulin at age\n#20 years, the majority being likely to have type 1 DM,\nalthough a few may have had type 2 DM. Thus, we esti-\nmate that 1.5% of patients with DM (unadjusted) had\ntype 1 DM, and because of this low number, we analysed\nall subjects with DM together. There was no difference in\nany of our analyses if the nine patients of age #20 years\nwere excluded.\nthem, eight women had diabetes. There was no differ-\nence in the use of marijuana by DM. Because of the low\nnumber in the diabetes category, we included them in\nthe analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses excluding the\npregnant women showed no difference.\nPlasma glucose and whole blood haemoglobin A1c\n(HbA1c) were measured at the University of Missouri-\nColumbia School of Medicine Department of Child\nHealth, Diabetes Reference Laboratory, Columbia,\nMissouri, by David Goldstein, MD, director.11\nSubjects were classified as obese/non-obese according\nto the BMI level using a cut-off of 30 kg/m2.\nWe analysed data related to DM, age, gender, race/\nethnicity, education level, family history of DM, physical\nactivity, BMI, cigarette smoking, cocaine use, alcohol use,\ntotal serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\ncholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (vitamin D),\nHbA1c, fasting plasma glucose level, C reactive protein\n(CRP) level and the serum levels of less robust inflam-\nmatory markers (ferritin, fibrinogen, white blood cell\n(WBC) count and uric acid) that have been previously\nused in NHANES III analysis.12 Physical activity was\nassessed using self-report to several questions (http://\nwww.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nh3rrm.htm#refman). For\nthe physical activity variable, subjects were classified as\ninactive if they did not report engaging in any of the\nfollowing activities during the previous month: walking,\njogging, bike riding, swimming, aerobics, dancing,\ncalisthenics, gardening, lifting weights or other physical\nactivity outside their occupation. Physical activity was\nclassified as moderate or vigorous intensity based on\nmetabolic equivalent intensity levels. Individuals were\nconsidered to fulfil national recommendations for\nphysical activity if they reported five or more episodes\nDecreased prevalence of diabetes in marijuana users\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nper week of moderate-intensity physical activity or three\nor more episodes per week of vigorous-intensity physical\nactivity.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterise the\nsubjects (mean and SD for continuous variables, and\npercentages for categorical variables). To test the statis-\ntical difference between the groups, we used c2 test for\ncategorical variables and two-sided t tests for continuous\nvariables. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses\n(for categorical outcomedDM/no DM) were used to\ndetermine the relationship between DM and marijuana\nuse. We used multivariate logistic regression to adjust for\nconfounding variables and reported the OR and the\n95% CI. Variables considered as possible confounders in\nthe multivariate analysis were age, gender, race/\nethnicity, BMI, education level, cigarette smoking,\nalcohol use, physical activity, serum total cholesterol,\nHDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin\nD, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, WBC count and uric acid. In\norder to confirm that marijuana use was associated with\nDM and not due to confounders, we analysed how each\npotential confounder changed the OR of having DM.\nVariables that changed the OR by $10% were consid-\nered as confounders and included in the multivariate\nmodel.\nWe performed stratified analysis to test for effect\nmodification. For effect modifier variable, multivariate\nlogistic regression model was constructed for each\nsubgroup.\nIn addition, to help adjust for selection bias, we\nanalysed the data using the propensity score matching\nand estimated the average treatment effect for the\ntreated, bootstrap SE and t statistics. We added the\npropensity score to the logistic regression model as\ninverse weight, blocks (N\u00bc8) that satisfy the balancing\nproperty and quartiles.\nSAS, Inc.) and the survey module of STATA (Release\nSample weights, provided by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, were used to correct for differential\nselection probabilities and to adjust for non-coverage\nRESULTS\nAmong NHANES III participants aged 20e59 years,\nusers and 326 (3.3%) heavy current users. As shown in\ntable 1, current and past marijuana users tended to be\nsmoked cigarettes and used alcohol and cocaine more\nfrequently compared to non-marijuana users. Compared\nto non-marijuana users, past users tended to be white\nand to have a college education, while current users\nincluded more white and black subjects and were more\nlikely to have a high school education or less. Non-\nmarijuana users, past and current marijuana users had\na similar percentage of family history of DM (p>0.05)\nbut significantly different percentage of physical activity\nlevels (p<0.001), with past and current marijuana users\nbeing more active than non-marijuana users.\nAs shown in supplement table 1, marijuana users (past\nand current) had a lower adjusted prevalence of DM, but\nnot hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction or heart\nfailure compared to non-marijuana users.\nThe unadjusted prevalence of DM for non-marijuana\nusers, past marijuana users, current light marijuana users\nand 3.0%, respectively, and there was a statistically\nsignificant difference between the groups (p<0.0001)\nwere marijuana users and 53.6% were non-marijuana\nwere non-marijuana users (p<0.0001).

Serum CRP\nand fibrinogen were significantly (p<0.001) lower in\npast marijuana users compared to current and non-\nmarijuana users suggesting lower inflammation in past\nmarijuana users. In contrast, serum ferritin levels were\nhigher in past and current heavy users, and lower in light\nusers, compared to non-users. Serum uric acid levels\nwere higher in past and lower in current users compared\nto non-users.

As\nshown in the supplement table 2, there was no differ-\nence in marijuana use among those with DM by self-\nreport and those with DM who were included based on\nan elevated fasting glucose (p\u00bc0.43). Patients with DM\nby self-report who were hyperglycaemic (fasting glucose\n$126 mg/dl) at the time of sampling had a statistically\nsimilar rate of marijuana use as those whose DM was well\ncontrolled (fasting glucose <126 mg/dl) at the time of\nsampling (p\u00bc0.06), although there was a trend for\npatients with a history of DM by self-report who were\neuglycaemia at the time of sampling to be associated\nwith a lower rate of non-marijuana use. Those with DM\nby self-report and those with DM who were included\nbased on an elevated fasting glucose had similar rates of\nthe type of marijuana use (heavy current users, light\ncurrent users and past users). Additionally, for subjects\nwho did not have DM by self-report and did not have an\nelevated fasting glucose level but had an elevated HbA1c\n(>7.0%) (n\u00bc22), their prevalence of non-marijuana use\n(72.2%) was similar to the prevalence of non-marijuana\nuse among subjects with DM (73.1%).\nWe then examined the prevalence of all marijuana\nusers among subjects with different fasting glucose\nlevels. As shown in figure 1, the highest prevalence of\nmarijuana users was found in those with the lowest\nglucose levels. As the glucose levels increased, the prev-\nalence of marijuana users decreased. For subjects with\nDM (fasting glucose >125 mg/dl), the prevalence of\nmarijuana users was 23.6%. Similarly, the highest preva-\nlence of marijuana users was found in those subjects with\nthe lowest plasma HbA1c values (figure 2). As the HbA1c\nlevels increased, the prevalence of marijuana users\ndecreased.\nFurthermore, we analysed the data using logistic\nregression to assess the odds of having DM, an elevated\nglucose value or an elevated HbA1c for the categories of\nmarijuana use.

We did not find an\nassociation between the use of marijuana and other\nchronic diseases, such as hypertension, stroke, myocar-\ndial infarction and heart failure. This could be due to\nthe smaller prevalence of stroke, myocardial infarction\nand heart failure in the examined age group.\nWe noted the lowest prevalence of DM in current light\nmarijuana users, with current heavy marijuana users and\npast users also having a lower prevalence of DM than\nnon-marijuana users. The finding that past marijuana\nusers had lower odds of prevalent DM than non-users\nsuggests that early exposure to marijuana may affect the\ndevelopment of DM and a window of time of marijuana\nexposure earlier in life could be a factor to study. Simi-\nlarly, our findings of a significant association between\nmarijuana use and DM was only found in those aged\n$40 years suggest that the possibility of some protection\nfrom marijuana use may require many years before they\nbecome manifested. By contrast, it could reflect the\nincreased prevalence of DM with age and the ability to\ndetect an association with a lesser sample size when there\nis a greater cohort at risk for DM. The possible associa-\ntion of light marijuana use with decreased DM is similar\nto that of alcohol on DM and the metabolic syndrome, in\nwhich mild alcohol use was associated with lower preva-\nlence of DM and the metabolic syndrome,14 15 and\nhigher alcohol use associated with higher prevalence of\nSmit and Crespo9 used the NHANES III population to\nexamine dietary factors of non-marijuana users and\nmarijuana users among adults aged 20e59 years. Similar\nto our data, they found that 45% reported used mari-\njuana in their lifetime and 8.7% used marijuana in the\npast month. Current marijuana users had higher intakes\nof energy and nutrients and consumed more soft drinks\nbut had slightly lower BMI than non-current marijuana\nusers. Thus, it is unlikely that a healthier diet contrib-\nuted to the decreased prevalence of DM among mari-\njuana users found in our study. In our study, all\nmarijuana users had lower BMI than non-users, with\nheavy marijuana users having the lowest BMI. The lower\nBMI may be protective for DM, although when we\ncontrolled for BMI, the prevalence of DM was not\nsignificantly changed suggesting additional BMI-inde-\npendent pathways. Smit and Crespo9 did not record\nglycaemic parameters or prevalence of DM.\nUsing NHANES III data, marijuana users had lower\nrates of obesity (BMI $30) and lower mean BMI, with\ncurrent heavy marijuana users having the lowest BMI, in\nagreement with a recent report using National Epide-\ndatabases.17 Correcting for the effect of BMI, the asso-\nciation between marijuana use and DM was reduced by\n17% but remained highly significant.\nWe postulate that the decreased prevalence of DM and\nmarijuana use may be due to the anti-inflammatory\nproperties of marijuana. CBs found in marijuana\nfavourably modify inflammation probably through the\ninhibitory actions on prostaglandins and COX-2.18 Hu\nand colleagues2 reported that CRP, but not interleukin-6\nand tumour necrosis factor-a receptor-2, was associated\nwith the risk of developing DM. In our study, serum level\nof CRP, fibrinogen ferritin, uric acid and WBC counts\nrevealed varied associations with marijuana use. Of note,\nthe CRP assay used in NHANES III was not a highly\nsensitive assay11 and is unlikely to pick up small changes\nin an inflammatory state in a single individual; however,\nit is still a robust measure of inflammation and is useful\nin population studies.12 However, we did find a U-shaped\nassociation between the CRP levels and marijuana use\ngroups.\nRodent studies using CBs have shown significant\nbenefits against diabetic complications and atheroscle-\nrosis.19 20 Additionally, lower doses of CBs appear to be\nanti-inflammatory in rodents.19 CBs, including the\nnon-psychoactive cannabidiol, have also been shown\nto attenuate progression of type 1 DM in animal\nmodels.21 22 We have not identified any study in human\nsubjects or animals examining marijuana or its active\ningredients and the incidence of type 2 DM, although\none study found similar glucose levels in marijuana users\nas non-users.8 In a prospective study using a cannabis-\nbased medicinal extract compared to placebo to treat\ndiabetic neuropathy, glycaemic indices were not\nmentioned.23 We examined physical activity in patients\nusing marijuana and found that it did not confound the\nassociation between marijuana and DM.\nAlthough the CB1 antagonist, rimonabant has been\nused successfully to treat DM,24 we are not surprised\nFigure 3 OR and 95% CI of having diabetes mellitus (DM)\namong past and current marijuana users relative to non-\nmarijuana users.\nDecreased prevalence of diabetes in marijuana users\ngroup.bmj.com\nbmjopen.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nat the association between marijuana use and decreased\nprevalence of DM. Marijuana contains a variety of\nCBs, of which some, such as cannabidiol and delta9-\ntetrahydrocannabivarin, have antagonist properties\nthat may mediate the anti-inflammatory properties of\nA limitation of our study was its cross-sectional nature.\nDespite the efforts of NHANES to enrol a random\nrepresentative sample of the US population, persons\nattending the study visits may differ from those not\nattending in subtle ways that may affect the results of this\nstudy. We are unable to conclude that marijuana use\ndoes not lead to DM nor do we suggest that marijuana\nshould be a treatment for DM. Although we controlled\nfor major confounders, it is possible that non-marijuana\nusers and subjects with DM share some, as yet unknown,\ncharacteristic accounting for the relationship between\nDM and non-marijuana use.\nAn additional limitation is that the marijuana use was\nbased on self-report and self-report of illicit substances is\noften underestimated on self-reports.26 27 Self-report is\nsubjected to recall bias. However, we expect that recall\nbias would be similar in those with DM as those without\nDM and would be unlikely to bias our results. Although\ncurrent marijuana users were divided into heavy and\nlight users based on the number of times they reported\nusing marijuana per month, the amount of marijuana\nconsumed, route of consumption (inhaled vs oral),\nduration of use and time when they quit were not\nreported.\nA potential limitation was that most patients with DM\nwere identified by self-report, with a smaller number of\npatients identified by having an elevated fasting blood\nglucose levels. Because some patients with DM receiving\ntreatment are euglycaemic, blood glucose levels alone\ncannot be used to identify those patients with DM.\nHowever, the percentage of marijuana user was similar in\nthose patients with DM identified by self-report as that of\nthose with DM identified by fasting glucose testing.\nWhile we analysed all patients with DM together, we\nestimated that over 98% of the patients had type 2 DM,\nand therefore, our results are likely to apply only to\npatients with type 2 DM. Another limitation is the\npossibility of a cohort effect since those who use mari-\njuana may have other factors that may predispose\ndecreased prevalence of diabetes compared to non-users\nbesides lower BMI.\nIn conclusion, marijuana use was associated with\na decreased prevalence of DM. Prospective studies in\nrodents and humans are needed to determine a poten-\ntial causal relationship between cannabinoid receptor\nactivation and DM. Until those studies are performed,\nwe do not advocate the use of marijuana in patients at\nrisk for DM.\n"
