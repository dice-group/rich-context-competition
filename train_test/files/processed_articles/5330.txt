In April\n2013, the IEEN's third workshop was held at the\nCentre for Public Policy Research, King's College\nLondon, to consider issues associated with profession-\nalism in interdisciplinary and empirical bioethics. The\nworkshop focused on bioethicists' occupation of pro-\nfessional roles, either at institutions or in association\nwith bodies authorised by professional groups, and\nsought to explore how these roles are socially con-\nstructed, the ethical dimensions attached to the per-\nformance of these professional roles, and how\nperformance of these roles may be judged and evalu-\nated. Speakers and attendees were asked to consider the\nfollowing core questions: (1) What does it mean to be a\ngood bioethicist, and what expertise is required?\n(2) According to what standards should a professional\nbioethicist be judged? (3) What authority and influence\ndo bioethicists have, and how might any potential\nauthority and influence be recognised, regulated and\nevaluated? With these questions in mind, the morning\nsession considered perspectives on professionalism in\nand from bioethics, while the afternoon session was\nloosely directed towards the question of whether\nprofessional standards in bioethics could be institution-\nally underpinned.\nS\u00f8ren Holm (University of Manchester) gave the\nfirst presentation of the day with a talk that began by\nasking whether there could in fact be a `profession' of\nbioethics. He noted that, whilst standards and expertise\nare important, when we think about professional stand-\nards we often also think about norms of behaviour. He\nasked the question `why might we, as bioethicists, need\na profession', and suggested that one reason may be\nthat it offers some kind of security and validation of\nour work and our views: being a `professional' is better\nthan being an `amateur'. Considering the various activ-\nities in which bioethicists tend to be engaged, including\ntheir roles as researchers, teachers, experts on commit-\ntees and/or public intellectuals and campaigners, S\u00f8ren\nsuggested that the extent to which professionalism may\nbe applied to each of these roles or activities, as well as\nthe nature of professionalism in each case, depends on\nthe precise nature of the role or activity in question.\nGiven the diversity of activities undertaken by bioethi-\ncists, S\u00f8ren was not confident that the notion of profes-\nsionalism could successfully and/or straightforwardly\n1Centre for Public Policy Research, King's College London, London, UK\n2MESH, The University of Birmingham, UK\nCorresponding author:\nJonathan Ives, The University of Birmingham, 90 Vincent Drive,\nEmail: j.c.ives@bham.ac.uk\nClinical Ethics\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\ncet.sagepub.com\nbe applied to bioethics in general. He pointed out that\neach of these varied roles demand a diverse range of\nskills and knowledge, including conceptual, regulatory\nand legal knowledge, as well as analytic, problem sol-\nving, interpersonal and communicative skills. Any\nnotion of a professional expertise in bioethics would\nneed to be broad enough to encompass this spread of\nskills and knowledge.\nIn an attempt to move beyond the complexities asso-\nciated with such diversity, S\u00f8ren turned his attention\nspecifically to professionalism in the case of the empir-\nical bioethics researcher, suggesting that they ought to\nbe: (1) capable of understanding and executing the\nappropriate empirical and analytic methods of empir-\nical bioethics in order to produce rigorous, high-quality\nwork; (2) aware of the relevant standards and require-\nments for bioethics research as well as potentially\nrelated subject areas and/or disciplines; (3) aware of\nthe context in which their research will be published\nand/or applied and be able to contextulize their findings\nin relation to further important ethical questions. S\u00f8ren\nwent on to express scepticism about the prospect of\nthere ever being a profession of `empirical bioethicist'.\nRather, empirical bioethics is something that a bioethi-\ncist might do. He concluded that whilst it may be pos-\nsible to use broad categories to judge professional\npractice in bioethics on a specific case by case basis,\nsuch evaluations seem vague, making it unlikely that\na general standard for understanding and evaluating\nthe role of the professional bioethicists could be suc-\ncessfully drawn up.\nS\u00f8ren's presentation was followed by Richard\nAshcroft (Queen Mary's University of London), who\nbegan by declaring that he is not a bioethicist, despite\nholding a professional role as a bioethicist and being\nwidely recognised as such. He pointed out that profes-\nsional roles are socially attributed, making the occupa-\ntion of such a role at least partially an issue of meeting\nthe expectations of others. Given the inherent interdis-\nciplinarity within the field of bioethics, Richard high-\nlighted how occupying a professional bioethics role\ncould be particularly challenging, especially if this\nrequires one to conform to a variety of paradigms, per-\nspectives, traditions and standards. He thus described\nprofessionalism within bioethics as a kind of `brico-\nlage', in the sense that one may need to draw upon a\ndiverse array of resources and techniques in order to\nperform as expected. However, despite the need to\nwork across disciplinary boundaries, Richard suggested\nthat working as a bioethicist within the academy\nrequires a clear set of professional qualities, associated\nwith being a professional academic more generally\nrather than a bioethicist in particular: producing work\non time; reviewing work fairly; not speaking of the\nunknown; teaching to a certain standard; conducting\noneself as a scholar. Beyond the professional role that\naccompanies an academic position, Richard suggested\nthat bioethicists ought not to seek to become a profes-\nsion in the formal sense, and that formal professional\nstatus is neither required nor desirable.\nThe discussion that followed centred on what it\nmight mean to perform the role of a bioethicist `well',\nas a proxy for `professionally'. John Owens began by\nasking whether interdisciplinarity would be a prerequis-\nite for professionalism in bioethics, and this was\nanswered in the negative by S\u00f8ren, who argued that\nthis would be too limiting. Richard supported this, sug-\ngesting that being interdisciplinary cannot be necessary\nto participate in professional bioethics. Rather, people\nneed to be good at one particular thing, and be able to\nwork with people from other disciplines where neces-\nsary. Discussion then turned to the question of how we\ncan tell if bioethics is done well, and Jon Ives, playing\nDevil's advocate, suggested that, at least to some\ndegree, the peer-review process acts as a mechanism\nfor ensuring that professional standards have been\nmet in the context of bioethics research, and that this\nmight be considered as a form of informal self-regula-\ntion. In response, a number of problems with the peer-\nreview process as a model for self-regulation were con-\nsidered by the group: reviewers' attitudes can vary\nbetween being overly critical and overly sympathetic;\nthere are a number of journal publications within the\nfield of bioethics spanning a variety of genres, styles,\ndisciplinary orientations and readerships, making it dif-\nficult to find standard criteria for good research in bio-\nethics; there is not yet an established canon of\nliterature in empirical and interdisciplinary bioethics\nagainst which standards could be judged.\nThe discussion then moved on to consider the power\nof bioethics professionals, with the suggestion from\nSuzanne Shale that it may be possible to identify an\noutline of the bioethics profession through the specific\ninterests that they assert. S\u00f8ren Holm suggested that\nthe development of a profession in bioethics might be\nseen to emerge through the development of sociological\nand philosophical critiques of powerful medical and\nlegal discourses and practices; and whilst this picture\nmay account for the emergence of bioethics as a com-\nmunity, it does not support calls for recognising bio-\nethics as a profession. In response to aired concerns\nthat bioethics lacks a common aim, methodology and\nforms of evaluation and regulation, and may therefore\nbe too broad and nebulous to be called a profession,\nAlan Cribb suggested that bioethics may plausibly be\nthought of as a label which describes a collective group\nof diverse sub-professions. On this reading, bioethics\nwould not be considered a profession in the formal\nsense, but the question about the power attached to\nthe role of bioethicist remains important. Picking up\non the idea of sub-professions, Jon Ives then noted that\na perennial problem for professionalism, in the context\nof bioethics, may be that there is a sense in which there\nis no need to have specialists in bioethics, given that the\nroles bioethicists play (that of commenting on ethical\nissues and critiquing practice) can arguably be taken on\nby anyone with an interest in those issues. The need for\na profession, and for a recognition of disciplinary\nexpertise for the bioethicist, is one unique to the acad-\nemy, and not a concern for wider society. Richard\nAshcroft agreed that all medical professionals are sup-\nposed to routinely engage with bioethics, and suggested\nthat their willing and respectful attitudes towards bio-\nethics may be more important than specialist bioethical\nknowledge.\nThe afternoon session began with a presentation by\nSuzanne Shale, an ethics consultant and research asso-\nciate at The University of Oxford's ETHOX Centre.\nSuzanne presented her ethics consultancy work as an\nexample of how professional bioethics can be per-\nformed beyond academic and clinical contexts.\nSuzanne began by exploring how moral life is different\nfrom moral research. In real life we negotiate moral\ndemands through narratives of value, relationships\nand identity, where normative expectations regulate\nour behaviour and we have strong reactive attitudes\nwhen these expectations are breached. Given the\ndynamic nature of our moral experience, Suzanne ques-\ntioned what it is that the professional bioethicist claims\nto know and to do, and the domain in which this tends\nto occur. She suggested that the domain of professional\nbioethics tends to be one of expert reasoning about the\nmoral literature and social fields of law, education,\npolicy and research, and that their core function tends\nto involve providing criticism, guidance and support.\nSuzanne's approach to bioethics is less typical, and\ndoes not conform to this professional orthodoxy. She\ndescribes herself as working in the domain of moral\ndialogue, with a focus on the emotional intensity asso-\nciated with moral norm expectations and a function of\nproviding space for conversations about the moral\nexperience for those who require this sort of support.\nShe explained that her work often focuses on processes\nof moral repair for people who have been harmed by\nmedical institutions by providing a means of exploring\nexperiences of harm through moral dialogue. Drawing\non Walker's1 work on moral repair and Berlinger's2\nstudies on the ethics of forgiveness, Suzanne uses litera-\nture from bioethics to create spaces for moral conver-\nsations about grief, healing and repair to take place\nwhich have a positive impact on those with which she\nworks. Suzanne's account testifies to the diverse and\nvaried nature of professional roles within bioethics.\nSuzanne was followed by Hugh Whittall, director of\nthe Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCB). In his\npresentation, Hugh identified interdisciplinary ethics\nas important to the NCB's work, which he described\nas typically identifying ethical issues to which value\nbased, empirical and analytical reasoning processes\ncould be applied to reach conclusions for policy appli-\ncation. He suggested that professionalism in the insti-\ntutional context of the NCB might comprise having\nsufficient knowledge and expertise, as well as having\nthe ability to engage in appropriate behaviour to meet\nexpectations. Hugh identified a variety of potential pro-\nfessional roles for bioethicists: (1) decision-making\nroles which might take place in a group or an institu-\ntional context, but may also be undertaken as an indi-\nvidual (whether as a patient, professional, academic,\netc.) embedded within a social context; (2) expert\nroles which might involve providing support, critique,\nadvice or guidance; (3) practical policy roles which\nmight involve implementing a decision that has been\nmade, and could mean taking into account guidance\nfrom experts. Hugh's central point was that establish-\ning the nature, purpose and conditions of a role is key\nfor understanding what professionalism may mean in\nany given context. Hugh suggested that the NCB's\ninstitutional role is also context dependent, but nor-\nmally involves identifying and interpreting questions,\nlocating a decision-maker and producing reports\nwhich would support decision-making. He identified\ntransparent justification as key to good performance,\nand explained that this meant making the values and\nempirical data on which the Council's reports are based\nopen and available for public scrutiny. In this way,\nHugh suggested that the NCB could potentially be\nseen as a bioethics institution fulfilling a professional\nrole, but this doesn't involve decision-making, under-\nwriting what is correct or underpinning standards\nwithin bioethics. Whilst an institution might one day\nbe created to codify standards of practise within bio-\nethics, and thus lend bioethicists a professional status,\nHugh concluded by suggesting that the professional\nstatus of bioethics is less important than ensuring that\nbioethics is practised to a high standard. As such, insti-\ntutions like the NCB can be a useful mechanism for\nsupporting high-quality bioethics activity through\nforms of education (for example, by presenting syllabus\ncontents for bioethics courses) or practice (for example,\nby engaging in and/or promoting certain forms of\nbehaviour). However, Hugh acknowledged that these\nmeasures may not be sufficient for ensuring high-qual-\nity outcomes in bioethics; indeed we may be worried\nthat they might promote certain forms, discourses and\npractices of bioethics at the expense of other valu-\nable elements. For this reason, the potential limitations\nof institutions contributing to bioethics ought to be\nrecognised alongside their potential strengths and\nresources.\nIn the discussion that followed, Suzanne was asked\nto clarify the difference between her work in moral\nrepair and therapy. She replied that whilst there are\nsimilarities, particularly insofar as there is a one-to-\none focus, the difference is in the subject matter. Her\nwork very much centres on having a moral conversa-\ntion. Hugh Whitall then noted that we all make moral\ndecisions every day and, by and large, we do this well,\noften without really thinking and without making our\nreasoning explicit. When the problems get complex we\ntend to struggle, and this is when some expertise or\n`professional' input might be useful. The implication\nhere is that the `professional bioethicist', whether\ndoing the work that Suzanne described, or the work\nthat the NCB undertakes, can bring something unique\nand valuable to the table, in terms of skills and experi-\nence. Whether this `professional' is a single individual,\nor a group of people, will depend on the context of the\nproblem. Picking up on an earlier point from S\u00f8ren's\ntalk, John Owens then suggested that given the diver-\ngent nature of these bioethics `tasks', it might be insuf-\nficient to use any kind of institutional guidance to\ndetermine what it is to be a bioethics `professional',\nas those kinds of rules could never capture the complex-\nity of the roles. Rather, professionalism might be\ncarved out in contested spaces, and defined in practice\nrather than outside of it. Angus Dawson then took the\ndiscussion back to the afternoon talks, and asked (1)\nwhat work is the word `moral' doing in Suzanne's con-\ncept of `moral harm'? and, (2) how does the impact\nagenda get into the NCB's work and it's professional\nidentity? Hugh replied, stating that the NCB does not\nwant to idealise its role. There are various kinds of\nimpact, ranging from getting people do what the\nCouncil suggests to simply contributing to a discussion.\nThe NCB attempts to do all of this, and does not con-\nsider itself the final authority on matters bioethical.\nComing back the point he made in his talk about a\nmarker of professionalism, he noted that the NCB\ntries to make all of its reasoning very explicit, and\nthat makes impact, of different kinds, possible (rather\nthan guaranteed). Suzanne then replied to Angus' ques-\ntion by saying that she was not entirely sure what made\nsomething a `moral' issue specifically, but suggested\nthat wider interpretation is needed than what seems\nto be used currently in the academy: we tend to think\nabout ethics exclusively in terms of the question `what\ndo we do next?', rather than asking `what do we do\nwhen we have stuffed things up'? The concept of\n`moral repair' is tied to the latter, and is not just con-\ncerned with relations between individuals, but also with\nhow an individual can reconcile and accept moral harm\ndone to them themselves.\nSummary\nThe meeting was successful in its aim of bringing\ntogether members of the bioethics community to\nexplore questions of professionalism within bioethics.\nWhilst no firm conclusions were reached, the presenta-\ntions and subsequent discussion highlighted the import-\nance of: (a) unpacking the variety of activities which\nbioethicists undertake and the diverse contexts in\nwhich this work takes place; (b) analysing roles, expert-\nise and standards in bioethics in relation to this variety\nof activities and diversity of contexts; (c) debating the\nbenefits that professionalisation within bioethics may\nbring against the challenges and potentially negative\nconsequences of such efforts.\nA report on the fourth IEEN workshop, which\nwas held in Birmingham in late 2013 on the theme of\nDissemination, Publication & Impact in\nInterdisciplinary and Empirical Ethics, is forthcoming.\nDetails of future events will be posted on the website\nand circulated to network members.
