    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nFor studies of remyelination in demyelinating diseases, the\ncuprizone model of CC (corpus callosum) demyelination has\nexperimental advantages that include overall size, prox-\nimity to neural stem cells of the subventricular zone, and\ncorrelation with a lesion predilection site in multiple\nsclerosis. In addition, cuprizone treatment can be ended to\nallow more direct analysis of remyelination than with viral\nor autoimmune models. However, CC demyelination lacks a\nuseful functional correlate in rodents for longitudinal\nanalysis throughout the course of demyelination and\nremyelination. In the present study, we tested two distinct\nbehavioural measurements in mice fed 0.2% cuprizone.\nRunning on a `complex' wheel with varied rung intervals\nrequires integration between cerebral hemispheres for\nrapid bilateral sensorimotor coordination. Maximum run-\nning velocity on the `complex' wheel decreased during\nacute (6 week) and chronic (12 week) cuprizone demye-\nlination. Running velocity on the complex wheel distin-\nguished treated (for 6 weeks) from non-treated mice, even\nafter a 6-week recovery period for spontaneous remyelina-\ntion. A second behavioural assessment was a resident\u00ad\nintruder test of social interaction. The frequency of\ninteractive behaviours increased among resident mice after\nacute or chronic demyelination. Differences in both\nsensorimotor coordination and social interaction correlated\nwith demonstrated CC demyelination. The wheel assay is\napplicable for longitudinal studies. The resident\u00adintruder\nassay provides a complementary assessment of a distinct\nmodality at a specific time point. These behavioural\nmeasurements are sufficiently robust for small cohorts as\na non-invasive assessment of demyelination to facilitate\nanalysis of subsequent remyelination. These measurements\nmay also identify CC involvement in other mouse models of\ncentral nervous system injuries and disorders.\n",

MS (multiple\nsclerosis) is the most prevalent cause of demyelination in the\nCNS (central nervous system). Although MS results in focal\nlesions throughout the CNS, lesions are found in the CC\n(corpus callosum) in over 90% of MS cases (Gean-Marton et\nal., 1991). Additionally, at all stages of MS there is significant\nCC atrophy, which is not attributable to normal aging\n(Martola et al., 2007). In rodent experimental models, the CC\nis often used to examine cellular and molecular mechanisms\ninvolved in demyelination and remyelination (Armstrong\nthe CC can be induced in mice by ingestion of the\nneurotoxicant cuprizone (Matsushima and Morell, 2001),\nand this model is widely used for studies of remyelination\nsince, in contrast with viral and autoimmune demyelination\nmodels, cuprizone can be removed from the chow to examine\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email rarmstrong@usuhs.edu).\nAbbreviations: CC, corpus callosum; CNS, central nervous system; LFB, Luxol Fast Blue; MBP, myelin basic protein; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; MS, multiple\nsclerosis; PLP, proteolipid protein; Vmax\n, maximum running velocity.\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nremyelination without continued active demyelination.\nHowever, a limitation of the CC as a model in these studies\nis the lack of accepted functional measures to non-invasively\nmonitor the effect of demyelination, especially for longit-\nudinal studies. The present study tested behavioural measure-\nments targeted for likely involvement of the CC to determine:\n(i) applicability in longitudinal studies, especially as relevant\nto recovery of function and remyelination; (ii) sensitivity for\nuse among small cohorts, as is feasible for remyelination\nstudies; (iii) ability to detect continued effects during chronic\ndemyelination; and (iv) assessment of motor and non-motor\nmodalities, preferably without interference between mea-\nsurements to allow evaluation using both assays in a given\nmouse.\nThe CC is important for transfer and integration of\ninformation between the two hemispheres of the brain.\nHumans with agenesis of the CC have normal intelligence,\nbut present with subtle cognitive deficits, especially in\nlanguage ability (Paul et al., 2007). Similar deficits are also\nobserved in patients that have undergone callosotomy\n(Devinsky and Laff, 2003). Such language deficits are\nassociated with problems in social interaction and are\nsymptoms of the autism spectrum disorders (Paul et al.,\n2007). In addition to language deficits, CC structural\nabnormalities have shown a correlation with impairments in\nmotor tasks involving bimanual finger co-ordination. These\nmotor impairments are observed in patients with agenesis of\nthe CC, in patients that have undergone callosotomy, in\nchildren in whom the CC is not fully myelinated, and also in\nThe CC is a widely studied CNS tract for rodent models of\nMS based on the experimental advantages of being the\nlargest myelinated tract in the brain, with demyelination\nreadily induced by injection of toxins or antibodies, or by\ningestion of cuprizone (Gensert and Goldman, 1997;\nDecker et al., 2002). Additionally, the CC is located adjacent\nto the subventricular zone, a potential source for neural stem\ncells, making the CC ideally located to monitor neuroregen-\nerative responses for repair of demyelination. A behavioural\nassessment that correlates with demyelination in the mouse\nCC would provide insights into the role of the CC in rodents\nand would facilitate non-invasive evaluation of CC demye-\nlination for longitudinal studies throughout demyelination\nand remyelination. Importantly, a behavioural assay correl-\nating with CC pathology is necessary to quantify deficits\nduring acute demyelination and to subsequently test\nstrategies to promote remyelination.\nIn the present study, we use cuprizone ingestion in mice to\ninduce a reproducible pattern of CC demyelination followed\nby remyelination. In the present study, two different\nbehavioural assays are modified and evaluated to identify\nfunctional deficits related to the cuprizone-induced demye-\nlination. Our results indicate that both a complex wheel\ntest of bilateral limb sensorimotor coordination and a\nresident\u00adintruder test of social interaction correlate with\nCC demyelination status in the cuprizone model. Importantly,\nthese two assays evaluate distinct functional modalities and\ncan be used in conjunction. Furthermore, the complex wheel\nactivity can be used in longitudinal analysis, whereas the\nresident\u00adintruder assay is useful for analysis at a specific\ntreatment time point. These assays detected differences\nwhich correlated with CC demyelination during both acute\nand chronic cuprizone treatment paradigms. Both assays were\nhighly robust in that significant differences were distin-\nguished among small cohorts of mice which will be important\nfor analyses within a cohort size that is feasible for studies of\ncellular and molecular mechanisms involved in remyelination.\nOur analysis also demonstrates that immunohistochemical\nevidence of extensive remyelination may not indicate full\nrecovery to normal action potential transmission along\npreviously demyelinated axons.\nAnimals\nYoung adult male C57Bl/6 mice were provided from Jackson\nLaboratories at 6 weeks of age and housed singly on-site in\nthe animal facility according to the guidelines of the National\nInstitutes of Health and the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of the Uniformed Services University of the\nHealth Sciences. All mice were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle\nCuprizone model\nMale C57Bl/6 mice (8\u00ad9 weeks of age; Jackson Laboratories)\nwere fed ad libitum a diet of 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone [oxalic\nbis-(cyclohexylidenehydrazide); Sigma\u00adAldrich] mixed into\nHarland Teklad), which can be administered for specific\nperiods to induce reproducible patterns of demyelination and\nremyelination of the CC (Matsushima and Morell, 2001;\nan initial phase of demyelination (designated as the `acute'\ncondition), mice were fed cuprizone continuously for 6 weeks.\nAfter 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding, some of these mice were\nfed normal chow for a subsequent 6 week period to allow\nprogression of spontaneous remyelination (designated as the\n`recovery' condition). To induce prolonged demyelination\n(designated as the `chronic' condition), mice were fed\ncuprizone continuously for 12 weeks. Controls were age-\nmatched male C57Bl/6 mice fed normal chow.

Mice were weighed at the\nbeginning of each week of analysis (0, 6 and 12 weeks of\ntreatment or matched no-treatment controls). For the\nrespective 0, 6 and 12 week cuprizone time points, the weights\n(means\u00a1S.D. in g) for non-treated mice were 24.4\u00a11.2,\nBilateral sensorimotor limb coordination:\ncomplex wheel-running assay\nA running assay using wheels with irregularly spaced rungs\nhas been shown to detect functional differences in mice with\nsurgical transection of the CC (Schalomon and Wahlsten,\n2002) and with cuprizone-induced acute demyelination\n(Liebetantz and Merkler, 2006). These methods were modified\nto test the application of this assessment for use in\nlongitudinal studies, especially with small cohorts as is\nfeasible for remyelination studies, for detection of continued\neffects during chronic demyelination, and for use in\nconjunction with an assessment of non-motor modalities\n(see the section on the `Social interaction: resident\u00adintruder\nassay' below). Cohorts of mice were housed in cages equipped\nwith an optical sensor to detect the number of wheel\nrevolutions per time interval (Lafayette Instruments). A\ntraining wheel with all 38 rungs intact was present in the\ncages for 2 weeks to normalize running behaviour. On the\nthird week, mice were introduced to the `complex' wheel with\n22 rungs missing at intervals according to the pattern shown\n(Figure 1A). After the third week, the running wheel was\nremoved from the cage. This cycle of 2 weeks on the training\nwheel and 1 week on the complex wheel has been referred to\nas a MOSS (motor skills sequence) (Liebetantz and Merkler,\n2006). This 3 week sequence was carried out prior to the start\nof cuprizone and then repeated for the acute, chronic and\nrecovery time points (Figure 1B). Age-, weight- and sex-\nmatched control mice were treated identically, but did not\nhave cuprizone in the chow pellets. Using the Activity Wheel\nMonitoring Software, wheel revolutions were recorded\nthroughout 10 min intervals during the light phase, when\nmice were relatively inactive, and throughout 1 min intervals\nduring the more active dark phase. Results from each 24 h\nperiod were exported to a Microsoft Excel file in which total\ndistance run, maximum velocity among daily runs, number of\nruns and maximum run interval (i.e. duration of run) were\ncalculated. A total of 29 mice were tested of which nine were\nage-matched controls. Of these 20 cuprizone-treated mice,\neach was tested prior to the beginning of cuprizone feeding\nin order to serve as within-subject controls. All mice showed\nspontaneous running activity so that none were excluded\non this basis, in contrast with the study by Liebetantz and\nSocial interaction: resident\u00adintruder assay\nAs a broad screen of activities, the resident\u00adintruder assay\n(Bolivar et al., 2007) was modified to use video recording to\nquantify all distinct behaviours of cuprizone-treated and\nnon-treated resident mice in the presence and absence of an\nintruder mouse in combination with analysis of movement to\nassess overall activity level and overt neurological differences.\nIndividual cuprizone treated or non-treated C57Bl/6 male\nmice (with the observer blinded to treatment category) were\nplaced in a clean plastic housing cage identical with the home\neach as the `resident' mouse. An age-matched, weight-\nmatched non-treated male mouse was introduced as the\n`intruder' for a second 15 min period. Both 15 min sessions\nwere video recorded to facilitate scoring of all identifiable\ndistinct behaviours. The number of distinct behaviours was\nscored for the resident mouse (15 min alone; 15 min with\nintruder) and for the intruder mouse (15 min with resident).\nThe independent behaviours included sniffing the envir-\nonment, rearing alongside the cage, rearing independently,\ndigging, circling clockwise, circling counter-clockwise, allo-\ngrooming, freezing and scratching. Interactive behaviours\nincluded sniffing the other mouse, following, grooming,\nrearing at the other mouse, sitting or laying next to the other\nmouse, backing or running away from the other mouse,\nbiting, boxing or wrestling, mounting, pinning and tail-\nrattling. Video files were also analysed using an ObjectTracker\nprogram on ImageJ software. This analysis yielded Microsoft\nExcel data files with object coordinates within the cage for\nevery 1 s of video recording. From these data sets the distance\ntravelled for each 15 min video recording session was\nextrapolated. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to assess\ndifferences between age-matched cohorts for both inde-\npendent and interactive behaviours. A total of 46 resident\nmice (25 cuprizone-treated and 21 non-treated matched\ncontrols) were examined using the resident\u00adintruder assay.\nAnalysis of myelination status\nFollowing behavioural analysis, mice were perfused with 4%\n(w/v) paraformaldehyde. Coronal brain sections (15 mm) were\ncut for immunohistochemistry. Analysis within the body of\nthe CC was performed using cryostat sections taken between\napprox. Bregma levels 0 to 21 mm, whereas the hippocampal\nanalysis was performed on more caudal sections, approx.\nBregma levels 21 to 22 mm. To examine the cerebellar\ncortex, sagittal sections (40 mm) were cut on a vibratome\nusing brains from a separate set of mice that were not in the\nbehavioural cohorts. MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycopro-\ntein) was detected with the monoclonal antibody 8-18C5\n[from Dr Minettia Gardinier (Department of Pharmacology,\nUniversity of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, U.S.A.)] followed by\nincubation with donkey anti-mouse IgG F(ab9)2\nconjugated\nwith Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch) (Armstrong et al., 2006).\nMOG-immunostained sections viewed on an Olympus\nIX-70 microscope were photographed with a Spot 2 CCD\nBehavioural assays of cuprizone demyelination\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nFigure 1 Mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination can be distinguished using complex wheel activity that challenges bilateral\nsensorimotor coordination\n(A) Home cages were equipped with either a training wheel (all rungs in place) or a complex wheel (one or two rungs removed in an\nalternating pattern).

Wheel sets were scheduled so that the complex wheel period ended at the\nstart of cuprizone feeding (0 week, blue), at the end of the acute demyelination phase (6 week, red), at the end of the chronic\ndemyelination phase (12 week, red), or at the end of the 6 week period for recovery following acute demyelination (recovery, green).\n(C\u00adF) The maximum velocity (Vmax\n) recorded is shown for each 24 h period.

Panels\nof images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.\nQuantification of CC myelination was estimated from MOG\nimmunofluorescence using Metamorph software (Armstrong\net al., 2006). Pixel intensity values were normalized between\nsections by thresholding to exclude values below the level in\nthe dorsal fornix, which is an adjacent white matter tract that\nis not demyelinated by cuprizone. The percentage area of the\nCC (midline unilaterally to under the cingulum apex) with\nMOG pixel intensities above the threshold level was then used\nas an estimate of the myelinated area. Similarly, quantifica-\ntion of cerebral cortex myelination was estimated from MOG\nimmunofluorescence in the same tissue sections used for CC\nanalysis. Pixel intensity values were normalized between\nsections by thresholding to distinguish myelinated cortical\nradiation fibres in the cortex. The percentage area of the\ncortex (over the CC from the midline unilaterally to over the\napex of the cingulum) with MOG immunoreactivity above the\nthreshold level was then used as an estimate of the\nmyelinated area.\nStatistical analysis\nFor each experimental approach, each category analysed\nincluded three or more mice per condition. Analysis of tissue\nsections included at least three sections per mouse. Prism 5.0\n(GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analyses.\nUnpaired Student's t tests were used to assess differences\nbetween age-matched cohorts for a single time point. One-\nway ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's multiple comparison was\nused to determine significant differences across time points.\nTwo-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's multiple comparisons\nwas used for analysis across time points and treatments.\nStatistical significance was determined as P,0.05.\nRESULTS\nComplex wheel assay of bilateral sensorimotor\ncoordination\nAlthough the CC is a common site for analysis of\ndemyelination and remyelination for many reasons, including\nthose noted above, these analyses are constrained by the lack\nof a measure of CC function that can be applied in\nlongitudinal studies to monitor the effect of demyelination,\nas well as to functionally evaluate manipulations to promote\nremyelination. Cuprizone ingestion results in widespread,\nreproducible demyelination of the CC in mice (Mason et al.,\n2006) making the cuprizone model ideal for testing\nfunctional behavioural correlates of CC myelination status.\nA complex wheel assessment which incorporates irregularly\nspaced wheel rungs was selected for longitudinal analysis of\nCC function because of the required integration of sensory\nand motor information bilaterally in a non-uniform pattern,\nwhich would reduce the influence of pattern-generating\nspinal cord locomotion expected to correspond with uniform\nor rhythmic movements (Figures 1A and 1B). Differences\ndetected with the complex wheel assay have been previously\ncorrelated with surgical transection of the CC (Schlamomon\nand Wahlsten, 2002) and with acute (6 week) cuprizone\ntreatment (Liebetantz and Merkler, 2006).\nThe parameters recorded daily from the wheel running\nbehaviour included the total number of runs, total distance\nrun, maximum run interval and the maximal running velocity\n(Vmax\n). The Vmax\nappeared to be a relevant parameter for the\ncomplex wheel differentiation of bilateral sensorimotor co-\nordination as shown for a representative cohort of mice in\nFigures 1(C) and 1(D). Baseline measures of Vmax\nwere\nrecorded on the training wheel and the complex wheel for\nall mice prior to the start of cuprizone treatment. No\ndifferences in baseline values were observed between the\ncohorts of mice tested (0 weeks; Figure 1C). Compared with\nthe matched non-treated cohort, the treated mice had slower\nVmax\nvalues on the complex running wheel after both acute (6\ncuprizone ingestion (Figures 1D and 1E). During the week\non the complex wheel, the sum of the Vmax\nvalues was\nreduced by 24.7% for mice fed cuprizone for 6 weeks and\n23.7% for mice fed cuprizone for 12 weeks, with each\ncompared with the respective matched cohort. These results\nindicate that the Vmax\nvalues exhibit significant differences\nduring both acute and chronic stages that are not abrogated\nfrom the repeated exposure to the complex wheel in these\nlongitudinal studies. Values for the other wheel-running\nparameters had greater variability than Vmax\nand during\nchronic demyelination did not distinguish treated from non-\ntreated mice on the complex wheel (number of runs,\nexception of the total distance run (P,0.01), which had\nvelocity as a contributing factor. Also, on the training wheels,\nVmax\nvalues were not significantly different between the\ncuprizone-treated and non-treated mice throughout the time\ncourse (Figures 1C\u00ad1E). Therefore the complex wheel can\ndetect motor co-ordination deficits that are not apparent\nwith the uniformly spaced rungs on the training wheel. These\nlack of differences on the training wheel also indicates that\nthe cuprizone treatment did not cause an overall decrease of\ninterest in the wheel or impair the general ability to run\nrapidly.\nMice were also tested longitudinally at time points of\nbefore cuprizone (0 week), after acute demyelination (6\nweeks of cuprizone) and again after a period of recovery (6\nweeks on normal chow) (Figure 1F). Again, Vmax\nvalues on the\ntraining wheel were not significantly different among mice\ntested at different disease time points. In contrast, the mice\nhad significantly slower Vmax\nvalues on the complex wheel at\nthe acute (reduced by 11.5%) and recovery (reduced by\nBehavioural assays of cuprizone demyelination\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n15.8%) time points than at the pre-cuprizone time point\n(Figure 1F; P,0.01 for each time point). The values did not\nchange significantly between the acute and recovery time\npoints on the complex wheel (Figure 1F). These findings\nindicate that Vmax\non the complex wheel is sensitive to\ndemyelination status both between- and within-subjects.\nFurthermore, the complex wheel Vmax\nvalues indicated\ncontinued effects on this behaviour even after a 6-week\nperiod for recovery, which is typically associated with\nextensive remyelination, indicating continued neurophysio-\nlogical abnormalities.\nResident\u00adintruder paradigm for assessment of\nsocial interaction\nA social interaction paradigm was tested as a distinct\nbehavioural assessment to complement the sensorimotor\nassessment from the complex wheel assay. The resident\u00ad\nintruder test of social interaction (Bolivar et al., 2007) was\nmodified to evaluate overt neurological function and to\nquantify overall activity, as well as all distinct behaviours\nidentified for each mouse (Figure 2A). The resident mouse\nwas either cuprizone-treated or a non-treated control,\nwhereas the intruder mouse was always a non-treated\ncontrol. No overt neurological symptoms were observed in\nany of the mice examined during acute or chronic cuprizone\ntreatment. Overall distance travelled during the recording\nperiod was calculated to determine whether a difference in\noverall movement of the mice may contribute to the\nincreased interactive behaviours observed (Figure 2B). This\nanalysis of movement showed no difference in total distance\ntravelled between cuprizone-treated animals and age-\nmatched controls. Across the battery of activities recorded,\na grouping became apparent in that interactive behaviours\nwere consistently increased in frequency among mice with\nacute demyelination (6 weeks cuprizone) compared with the\ncontrol cohort. Conversely, independent behaviours were\nconsistently less frequent among the mice with acute\ndemyelination.\nThe social interaction data were further analysed to\ndetermine whether significant differences could be demon-\nstrated for individual mice within each cohort (Figure 2C). To\ntake advantage of the distribution of behaviours observed\n(Figure 2A) the set of activities quantified was summed for\nindependent compared with interactive behaviours.\nIndividual mouse values clearly separate based on treatment\ncondition. Indeed, the interactive behaviours for each acute\ncuprizone-treated mouse are clearly distinct from the values\nfor the non-treated mice.\nThis distinction of interactive compared with independent\nbehaviours was also tested for applicability across acute\nthrough chronic demyelination stages (Figure 2D). Compared\nwith the matched controls, the resident mice with acute\ndemyelination showed a significant shift of behaviours, with\ndecrease in independent behaviours. Importantly, the mice\nwith chronic demyelination continued to show an increase in\ninteractive behaviours (49.2%). These differences in treated\ncompared with non-treated mice across both time points\nwere significant based on a two-way ANOVA (interactive\nAlso, a decrease in independent activity frequency was\nnotable between ages among the control mice, indicating an\nwithout intruder; P50.018 with intruder). Therefore the\nfrequency of interactive behaviours appears to be a better\nparameter than independent behaviours for comparisons\nacross this prolonged disease course.\nResident mice with acute demyelination followed by a\n6 week recovery period still showed a high frequency of\nintruder mouse. Although only a set of three mice was tested\nfor this recovery cohort, the values are very close to those of\nthe acute and chronic cohorts, indicating a lack of functional\nrecovery during the remyelination period that is also\nconsistent with the lack of full recovery on the complex\nwheel (Figure 1F). Ideally, direct comparison of values for the\nsame mice evaluated at both the acute and recovery time\npoints would be optimal to evaluate changes longitudinally,\nwhich was not done with this recovery cohort. In general,\nmice should be socially nai\n\u00a8ve before testing in a resident\u00ad\nintruder paradigm (Bolivar et al., 2007). Therefore this social\ninteraction paradigm is not expected to be appropriate for\nrepeated testing of the same resident mouse for longitudinal\nstudies, presumably because repetition may dampen interest\nof the resident mouse to interact with the novel intruder\nmouse. Surprisingly, we performed a preliminary test of a\nmatched cohort of treated (n53) and non-treated (n53)\nmice evaluated at both 6 and 12 weeks of cuprizone and\nfound significant differences across both acute and chronic\nfor interactive behaviours; as measured by two-way ANOVA).\nThis finding may reflect that the cuprizone effect is\nunusually robust for this behavioural assay and so\nmaintained a significant difference upon repetition.\nHowever, the major advantage of the resident\u00adintruder social\ninteraction paradigm is for analysis on a specific day during\nthe course of demyelination in that the video recording can\nbe accomplished in 1 h and requires no specific training of\nthe mice.\nMyelination status of mice used in behavioural\nstudies\nUpon completion of behavioural assessments, coronal\nsections through the body of the CC were immunostained\nfor MOG to estimate the myelination status at specific stages\nof cuprizone treatment and recovery (Figure 3). The expected\ndemyelination of the CC after 6 and 12 weeks of continuous\ncuprizone ingestion is evident when compared with normally\nN Hibbits and others\n158 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nFigure 2 Mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination can be distinguished using the resident\u00adintruder social interaction paradigm\n(A) An example of the battery of distinct behaviours quantified among mice filmed during the period with both a resident mouse\n(with or without cuprizone feeding) and an intruder mouse (always without cuprizone) in the cage.

(D) Comparison of cohorts of acute and chronic cuprizone-\ntreated mice with age-matched controls. In the absence of an intruder mouse, an age-dependent decrease of independent activities\nis observed across this prolonged disease time course (P50.0007). There is a marginally significant treatment effect among the\nresident mice while observed alone (P50.0436). In the presence of an intruder mouse, resident mice treated with cuprizone had a\nsignificantly decreased frequency of independent behaviours (P50.0045) and increased frequency of interactive behaviours\n(P50.0028) compared with the age-matched non-treated mice. In the presence of an intruder mouse, there was again an age-\ndependent effect among the independent behaviours (P50.018).

In addition, after acute demyelination,\nextensive spontaneous remyelination of the CC is evident\nfollowing the subsequent 6 weeks of recovery on normal\nchow (Figures 3A and 3F). Myelination of the adjacent\ncerebral cortex was also examined for a potential contri-\nbution to the observed behavioural effects. The cerebral\ncortex showed significantly reduced myelination after\nacute cuprizone treatment (Figures 3B\u00ad3E). To evaluate\nmyelination status in additional neuroanatomical areas for\nwhich cuprizone demyelination has been reported, we also\nperformed MOG immunohistochemistry on coronal brain\nsections at more caudal levels to include hippocampal areas\nand on sagittal sections through the cerebellum (Figure 4).\nDemyelination of hippocampal fibres was evident after\n6 weeks of cuprizone in the dorsal hippocampal commissure\nand within the hippocampus, which was especially marked in\nthe hilus area in comparison with non-treated mice\n(Figures 4A and 4B). In contrast, the cerebellar tissue did\nnot show evidence of demyelination in the arbor vitae or the\ncerebellar cortex, even when examined after 12 weeks of\ncuprizone treatment (Figure 4C). Therefore the behavioural\nchanges observed correlate with demyelination of the CC\nwith co-incident demyelination in hippocampal fibres.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we employed both bilateral sensor-\nimotor coordination and social interaction assessments for\ncomplementary tests of CC function for studies of cuprizone-\ninduced demyelination in mice. Cuprizone ingestion induces a\nreproducible pattern of extensive CC demyelination in mice\nthat both a complex wheel test of sensorimotor co-ordination\nand a resident\u00adintruder test of social interaction correlated\nwith CC demyelination status to test distinct functional\nmodalities independently or in conjunction with one another.\nThe complex wheel assay maintained sensitivity when\nperformed at repeated intervals for longitudinal analyses.\nBoth assays distinguished treated from control mice during\nboth acute and chronic demyelination. In addition, both\nassays were extremely sensitive and detected significant\ndifferences between cohorts as small as three mice.\nInterestingly, the data distinguish treated from non-treated\nmice following acute demyelination and a subsequent\nrecovery period of spontaneous remyelination that was\nimmunohistochemically confirmed in the same mice, indi-\ncating that normal action potential transmission has not yet\nfully recovered along previously demyelinated axons. These\nbehavioural measurements of CC function in mice will be\nFigure 3 Quantitative analysis of myelination following behavioural\nassessments\nCC (A) and cerebral cortical (B) myelination was estimated in coronal brain\nsections based on the percentage area immunolabelled for MOG.

Abnormal CC development has also\nshown correlations in autism spectrum disorders (Cody et al.,\ntasks for some of these skills can be difficult to assess in\nexperimental animals, consistent findings have been observed\nfor social interactions and bilateral coordination. Sociability\nmeasurements have been correlated with CC size among\nmouse strains (Fairless et al., 2008). Bilateral limb co-\nordination, as assessed by wheel running on a complex\nwheel, exhibited deficits as a result of CC agenesis or\ncallosotomy (Schalomon and Wahlsten, 2002) and acute\ncuprizone demyelination (Liebetanz and Merkler, 2006). The\ndirect effect of cuprizone acute demyelination on CC\nfunction has been demonstrated with electrophysiological\napproaches. Recordings from ex vivo slice preparations\nshowed impaired compound action potentials corresponding\nwith acute CC demyelination, and after 6 weeks of cuprizone\ningestion subsequent recovery is incomplete after 6 weeks on\nnormal chow (Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 2009). Similarly,\ncuprizone treatment increased the response latency between\nleft and right cortical neurons and partial recovery was\nobserved after removal of cuprizone from the diet (Bando et\nConsistent with predicted coordination deficits with CC\ndemyelination, several reports indicate motor activity deficits\nwith cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6 mice, but do not\ndemonstrate applicability for longitudinal studies. After 5\nweeks of cuprizone ingestion, deficits are evident as an\nincrease in the frequency of falls on the rotarod, although the\nsensitivity of the rotarod to measure CC myelination status is\nunclear since a significant difference was not found at 6\nweeks of cuprizone but was present after 6 weeks of\ncuprizone and 6 weeks of recovery (Franco-Pons et al., 2007).\nWheel running with a sequence of training and complex rung\npatterns showed significant differences in maximal velocity\non the complex wheel at 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment\n(Liebetanz and Merkler, 2006), as was confirmed in the\npresent studies (Figure 1). Both the rotarod and complex\nwheel assays indicate that significant differences continue\neven after a 6 week recovery period for remyelination\nof these previous studies tested activity only at one time\npoint prior to sacrifice so that comparison could only be\nmade between separate cohorts sacrificed at each disease\nstage. Importantly, the present study was designed to\ndetermine whether the complex wheel assessment would be\nsufficiently sensitive when repeated on a given mouse, as\nneeded for longitudinal studies, or when used to analyse\nsmall cohorts of mice, as would be practical in typical\nremyelination studies. Factors such as training and novelty\neffects can influence the use of behavioural assessments for\nrepeated measures in longitudinal studies. As our results\ndemonstrate, the complex wheel assay can be used for a\nwithin-subjects comparison of pre-treatment, demyelination\nand remyelination time points. In addition, significant\ndifferences were observed with cohorts of only three mice\nin the present study design as compared with typically larger\ncohort sizes in behavioural studies, such as the design in the\nacute cuprizone study with a complex wheel assessment that\nBehavioural assessments of anxiety, memory and social\ninteraction have also been reported with cuprizone treatment\ncontrast with our findings of increased interactive behaviours\namong the cuprizone-treated mice in the resident\u00adintruder\nassay (Figure 2), Xu et al.

However, the analysis of social\ninteraction used by Xu et al. (2009) was automated and based\non the two mice being closer than 5 cm for 0.2 s without\nbeing validated by manual observation of an interactive\nbehaviour involving both mice, as was quantified in the\npresent study. Furthermore, open-field assessments in\ncuprizone-treated mice showed a tendency towards the field\ndecreased anxiety which may be consistent with the\nincreased interactive behaviours observed in our resident\u00ad\nintruder assays. Spatial working memory deficits were similar\nat weeks 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of cuprizone treatment (Xu et al.,\n2009), indicating a poor correlation of these assessments with\nthe dramatic changes in myelination status of the CC over\nthis time course. In our assessment, using the resident\u00ad\nintruder assay, the increase in interactive behaviours was\nevident at both acute (6 week) and chronic (12 week)\ncuprizone-treatment stages, which correlates well with\nsignificant CC demyelination at each time point. We also\nnote an age-dependent effect on the frequency of inde-\npendent behaviours in the resident\u00adintruder assay over this\nprolonged disease time course. This age effect is not as\nevident among cuprizone-treated resident mice when an\nintruder is present, but may be masked in the treated mice\nsince the level of independent behaviours is already reduced\nsignificantly by the treatment effect in the younger mice. To\nminimize the potential involvement of this age effect among\nindependent behaviours, the frequency of interactive beha-\nviours is likely to give a more direct differentiation of treated\ncompared with non-treated mice.\nAt the completion of our behavioural analysis, the\nprogression of demyelination and remyelination was quantified\nusing immunohistochemistry for MOG, which correlates well\nwith ultrastructural measurements of remyelination (Lindner\net al., 2008). Our findings of deficits in the complex wheel\nrunning and of increased interactive behaviours were con-\nsistently observed during both acute and chronic demyelination\n(Figures 1 and 2). Both time points correlate with the presence\nof extensive demyelination in the CC (Figure 3). The proportion\nof CC demyelination at 12 weeks of cuprizone treatment in our\nmice exposed to the running wheels is similar to that observed\nat this time point in a previous analysis (Armstrong et al., 2006).\nFollowing acute demyelination, spontaneous remyelination of\nthe CC was observed which was also consistent with our\nprevious studies (Armstrong et al., 2006). Therefore the wheel\naccess, which is a form of behavioural enrichment, is unlikely to\nhave altered the extent of CC demyelination or remyelination\nobtained relative to our standard cuprizone protocol.\nInterestingly, evidence of remyelination during the recovery\nperiod after acute demyelination was not accompanied by a\nsimilar return of normal activity, indicating that the complex\nwheel assay is sensitive to persisting abnormalities, possibly in\nthe nodal or other axon\u00admyelin structures.\nAfter cuprizone ingestion, the cerebral cortex can also\nshow signs of demyelination with a temporal pattern that is\ndelayed relative to the CC (Skripuletz et al., 2008; Gudi et al.,\n2009). The complex wheel activity and social interaction\nchanges were observed during acute demyelination at a time\nwhen cortical demyelination was not yet evident (Figure 3).\nTherefore CC demyelination may be sufficient for the observed\ndifferences in complex wheel activity and social interaction\nafter 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment. The interpretation that\nimpaired CC function is sufficient to cause decreased velocity\nof running on the complex wheel assay is supported by studies\nshowing similar results with surgical transection of the CC\nThe extent to which changes in myelination are evident at\nspecific stages following cuprizone treatment may also vary\nwith the detection methodology. After 6 weeks of cuprizone\ntreatment, significant cortical demyelination was not\ndetected with LFB (Luxol Fast Blue) staining (Skripuletz et\nal., 2008), but was readily detected by immunoreactivity for\nPLP (proteolipid protein) and MBP (myelin basic protein)\ncerebellar cortical demyelination has also been reported in\nthe murine cuprizone model (Koutsoudaki et al., 2009;\ncerebral cortex, hippocampal demyelination was noted with\nPLP immunostaining, but was not detected with LFB staining\n6 weeks after cuprizone treatment (Koutsoudaki et al., 2009).\nHowever, it is important to note that LFB staining and MOG\nimmunoreactivity correlated more closely than immuno-\nreactivity for PLP or MBP when compared with electron\nmicroscopic quantification of myelination in the CC (Lindner\net al., 2008). Our experience with LFB myelin staining\nwith our MOG immunoreactivity (Armstrong et al., 2006; and\nthe present study) and with the findings reported by other\nlaboratories using cuprizone (e.g. Matsushima and Morell,\n2001). Indeed, at 6 weeks after cuprizone treatment, with\nboth LFB staining and with MOG immunohistochemistry, our\nstudies indicate demyelination of hippocampal fibres, includ-\ning the dorsal hippocampal commissure, but cerebral cortical\ndemyelination is not marked (Armstrong et al., 2002; Song et\nal., 2005) (Figures 3 and 4). In addition, relative to cerebellar\ncortical demyelination, Groebe et al. (2009) did not detect\ncerebellar cortical demyelination using PLP immunohisto-\nchemistry or electron microscopy, which is consistent with\nour preliminary studies with MOG immunohistochemistry\nafter 12 weeks of cuprizone (Figure 4C). Our interpretation is\nthat hippocampal demyelination is co-incident with CC\ndemyelination, whereas cerebral cortical demyelination is\nslightly delayed and cerebellar cortical demyelination was not\nobserved in the cuprizone treatment conditions used in the\npresent studies. Relative to our observed behavioural effects,\nhippocampal demyelination would be likely to have an impact\non functions associated with learning and memory, in\ncontrast with the sensorimotor co-ordination and social\nassessments used in the present study targeting CC analysis,\nor contribute to the epileptic seizures as has also been\nreported with cuprizone treatment (Hoffman et al., 2008).\nN Hibbits and others\n162 E 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nDifferences in mouse weight may indicate an underlying\nvariability in the extent of white matter pathology among\nstudies even when a 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone diet is reported.\nFor example, a 30% reduction in weight between treated\ncompared with non-treated mice was reported in the study\nthat indicated development of epileptic seizures among the\ncuprizone-treated mice (Hoffman et al., 2008). In the present\nstudy, the mice did not lose weight during cuprizone\ntreatment, but simply did not gain weight at the same rate\nas non-treated mice (see the Materials and methods section).\nCuprizone has a dose-dependent toxicity effect on mouse\nweight (Hiremath et al., 1998). Therefore variations in weight\nloss among studies may reflect variations in the cuprizone\ntoxicity experienced. These differences may carry over to\ndifferences in the extent of white matter pathology and in\nthe general health and behaviour with cuprizone treatment\nas well. For example, during acute cuprizone treatment\nLiebetantz and Merkler (2006) reported differences in\nrunning parameters on the training wheels that were\nspeculated as due to impairment of general health, whereas\ndifferences on the training wheels were not observed in the\npresent study. Importantly, the Liebetantz and Merkler (2006)\nstudy used female C57Bl/6 mice with an average starting\ncuprizone dose may have been more severe than in the\npresent study using male C57Bl/6 mice with an average\nstarting weight of 22.4\u00a11.5 g (see the Materials and\nmethods section for other time points).\nIn conclusion, the resident\u00adintruder social interaction\nparadigm and the complex wheel-running assay can\nbehaviourally phenotype mice according to CC myelination\nstatus in the context of the cuprizone model. These non-\ninvasive functional assays can identify affected mice during\nlongitudinal studies. These assays will be especially useful for\ncharacterizing acute and chronic disease severity to identify\nmanipulations to promote remyelination. These findings\nshould also facilitate studies to exploit mouse genetics to\nexamine mechanisms of pathogenesis and repair in demye-\nlinating diseases and take advantage of mouse models to\ndetermine involvement of the CC in other CNS injuries and\ndisorders.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health\n[grant number NS39293]; the National Multiple Sclerosis\nFoundation [grant number RG3515]; and the Department of\nDefense [grant number G170TP].\nREFERENCES\nAdamo AM, Paez PM, Escobar Cabrera OE, Wolfson M, Franco PG, Pasquini\nJM, Soto EF (2006) Remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination\nAlexander AL, Lee JE, Lazar M, Boudos R, DuBray MB, Oakes TR, Miller JN, Lu\nJ, Jeong EK, McMahon WM, Bigler ED, Lainhart JE (2007) Diffusion tensor\nimaging of the corpus callosum in autism.
