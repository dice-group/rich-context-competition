Considering the prognostic impact of proteinuria reduction, we\nhypothesized that titration of Ang II blockade for optimal anti-proteinuric effect would improve renoprotection. One\nday after induction of Thy 1.1 glomeruonephritis, rats were treated with increasing doses of the Ang II receptor blocker\nvalsartan in drinking water. Six days after disease induction, the therapeutic effect on proteinuria, podocyte injury and\nglomerular fibrosis was evaluated. Increasing doses of valsartan resulted in increasing reduction of proteinuria. The\nmaximally effective dose of valsartan was determined to be 1000 mg/l, which reduced proteinuria by 80% and maximally\nreduced glomerular matrix expansion, fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III staining and glomerular mRNAs for TGF\u00df1,\nPAI-1, FN and collagen I. Notably, valsartan given at this dose prevented podocyte dysfunction by preserving expression\nof podocin and nephrin and the counter-regulating molecule B7-1 that is involved in podocyte injury. These results sup-\nport the hypothesis that higher doses of valsartan are required to optimize proteinuria reduction and glomerulosclerosis\namelioration. Further, the optimal dose of valsartan also provides an additional therapeutic effect by preventing podocyte\ndysfunction.\n",

However, most studies to date show kidney disease\nprogression in many patients despite treatment with angio-\ntensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angioten-\nsin II-receptor blockers (ARBs). It has been assumed that\nthe limited renoprotection offered by ACEIs or ARBs is\ndue to uncompleted suppression of the RAS. One of the\nstrategies that could improve the efficacy of RAS blockade\nis titration of ACEI or ARB for optimal therapeutic effect.\nEmerging evidence has suggested that this approach does\nconfer a further decrement in urinary protein excretion, par-\nticularly with higher doses of ARB.2\u00ad11 Furthermore, higher\ndoses of ARB are generally well tolerated. However, large,\nlong-term trials with hard outcomes are currently lacking\nfor this potentially promising form of therapy.

To further investigate whether targeting the optimal\ndose of Ang II blockade that further reduces proteinuria\nmay yield better kidney outcomes and to investigate the\npotential protective actions, a systematic prospective study\nwith a broader range of doses of an ARB, valsartan (50 to\n1500 mg/l in drinking water), was carried out in the rat Thy\n1.1 glomerulonephritis model.\nCompared to other models of kidney disease, the model\nof mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is one in which\nadministration of an antibody to the Thy 1.1 epitope on glo-\nmerular mesangial cells leads to immune-mediated, comple-\nment-dependent mesangial cell lysis. It is characterized by a\nvery rapid and marked proteinuria accompanied by glomer-\nular accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM).13 This\nmodel has great relevance because it contains all of the ele-\nments of human fibrotic diseases, whether acute or chronic.\nIn addition, this model is reproducible and can be used to\nvery sensitively discriminate between therapeutic regi-\nmens.12,14,15 Therefore, this model was chosen for titration\nof valsartan for its optimal therapeutic effect in vivo.\nWe demonstrate that increasing doses of valsartan\nresulted in increasing reduction of proteinuria and renal\nfibrosis. Optimal anti-proteinuric doses of valsartan are\nalso required to optimize renoprotection. Further, more\ncomplete Ang II inhibition with the maximally effec-\ntive dose of valsartan prevents podocyte dysfunction\neffectively.\nMaterials and methods\nReagents\nValsartan was kindly provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals\nCorporation (Basel, Switzerland). Unless specified, all\nother reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.\n(St. Louis, MO, USA).\nAnimals\nThe studies were performed in male Sprague-Dawley (SD)\nCharles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA).\nAnimal housing and care were in accordance with the\nUnited States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for\nthe Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal stud-\nies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care\nCommittee of the University of Utah. Glomerulonephritis\nwas induced by tail-vein injection of 1.75 mg/kg of the\nmonoclonal anti-Thy 1.1 antibody, OX-7. OX-7 binds to a\nThy 1.1-like epitope on the surface of mesangial cells,\ncausing immune-mediated, complement-dependent cell\nlysis followed by exuberant matrix synthesis and deposi-\ntion.13 Normal control animals were injected with the same\nvolume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nExperiment design\nA dose-response experiment was carried out to determine\nthe effective dose range of valsartan in anti-Thy 1.1 glo-\nmerulonephritis. Eight groups of five rats (n = 5, each\ngroup) were assigned and treated as normal-control, dis-\nwater, as outlined in Table 1. Since the dose of 1000 mg of\nvalsartan per liter of drinking water (approximately equiva-\nlent to 160 mg/kg per day) has been tested in animal study\nand was not confirmed as the valsartan threshold,5 an even\nhigher dosage at 1500 mg/l was included in this study.\nTreatment was started 24 hours after antibody injection\nwhen mesangial cell lysis is complete and the fibrotic\nresponse starts. At the same time, based on an average\nwater intake of 40 ml per day, 60% of daily dose was\nadministered by gavage as described previously.12\nThereafter, the water intake was monitored daily and the\namount of drug in the drinking water was adjusted daily to\nthe amount each group of animals would receive by drink-\nUrine samples were collected from rats housed in meta-\nbolic cages for 24 hours from day 5 to day 6 after OX-7\nTable 1.

The urinary protein excretion was measured by\nthe Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules,\nCA, USA). Urine albumin and urine creatinine were meas-\nured using the DC2000+ microalbumin/creatinine reagent\nkit (Bayer Healthcare, Elkhart, IN, USA). Urine creatinine\nwas also measured for the calculation of creatinine clear-\nance ratio using the QuantiChromTM creatinine assay kit\n(BioAssay System, Hayward, CA, USA).\nOn day 6, animals were anesthetized, 5 to 10 ml blood\nwas drawn from the lower abdominal aorta for detection of\nplasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels\n(QuantiChromTM urea and creatinine assay kits) and kid-\nneys were perfused with 30 ml ice-cold PBS. The creati-\nnine clearance was calculated as the following formula,\n(Urine creatinine levels/plasma creatinine levels) \u00d7 24-h\nurine volume (ml)/(24 h \u00d7 60 min). For histological exami-\nnation, cortical tissue was snap frozen or fixed in 10% neu-\ntral-buffered formalin for periodic acid Schiff (PAS)\nstaining. Glomeruli were isolated by graded sieving as\ndescribed previously15 for RNA and protein isolation.\nThe dose results indicated that a valsartan dose of 1000\nmg/l (40 mg per day, approximately equivalent to 160 mg/\nkg per day) maximally reduced proteinuria, albuminuria\nand glomerular fibrotic markers, so the effect of valsartan\nat this dose on podocyte injury was examined in nephritic\nrats, compared with normal and disease controls.\nHistological analyses. All microscopic examinations were\nperformed in a blinded fashion. Three-micrometer sections\nof paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with PAS. The\nimages (\u00d7400 magnification) of 20 random glomeruli per\nslide were captured using a Nikon D50 digital camera\n(Inkley's-Ritz Camera, www.ritzcamera.com, Salt Lake\nCity, UT; Nikon Capture 4 Ver. 4.3, Nikon Inc., Melville,\nNY, USA), and the area of PAS-positive mesangium matrix\nindicating mesangial expansion in each glomerulus was\nquantified using a computer-assisted color image analysis\nsystem (Image J 1.38 for Windows; National Institutes of\nHealth http://rsb.info.nigh.gov). The PAS-positive material\narea in the mesangium was normalized by that of the total\nglomerular tuft where the percentage of mesangial matrix\noccupying each glomerulus was rated on a 0\u00ad4 scale (0=0,\nImmunofluorescent (IF) staining for matrix proteins\nwas performed on frozen sections and evaluated in 20 glo-\nmeruli from each rat. Monoclonal mouse anti-cellular\nfibronectin (FN) extradomain A+ (EDA)+ (Harlan Sera-\nLab Belton, England), goat anti-human type I collagen\nand goat anti-human type III collagen (Southern\nBiotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA) were\nused as the primary antibodies for detection of ECM com-\nponents.

Intraglomerular deposition of\nthese ECM components was quantified as described pre-\nviously.16 A whole kidney average positive staining for\nmatrix protein was obtained by averaging scores from all\nglomeruli.\nIF staining for antibodies against podocin and Wilms\ntumor protein 1 (WT-1) was performed on frozen sections.\nThe polyclonal goat anti-podocin IgG (G-20) and poly-\nclonal rabbit anti-WT-1 IgG (C-19) (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used as\nthe primary antibodies. The Rhodamin (tetramethylrhoda-\nmine-5-(and 6)-isothiocyanate (TRITC))-conjugated don-\nkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) and TRITC-conjugated goat\nanti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Laboratories\nInc.) were used as the secondary antibodies. Intraglomerular\npositive staining for podocin was also quantified in a\nblinded fashion by a computer-assisted method as described\nabove. The number of WT-1-positive podocytes per glo-\nmerulus was counted in 20 glomeruli selected randomly per\nsection.\nWestern blot analysis\nGlomeruli from individual rats were isolated and resus-\npended at 2\u00d7104 glomeruli/ml in lysis buffer (Cell\nSignaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) with 1%\nNP40, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and\none tablet/5 ml protease inhibitor mix (Complete, Mini;\nRoche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA).\nGlomeruli were homogenized twice on ice by sonication.\nEach 15-second sonication was followed by a 15-second\nminutes at 4\u00baC, the supernatant was stored at \u00ad70\u00baC until\nanalysis. The same amount of glomerular protein (deter-\nmined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, Pierce,\nRockford, IL, USA) from five rats of each group was\npooled. Twenty \u00b5g of protein samples were separated by\n4\u00ad12% Bis-glycine gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) and transferred to a 0.45-\u00b5m immo-\nbilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford,\nMA, USA). The glomerular protein levels of nephrin and\nB7-1 were developed using polyclonal rabbit anti-nephrin\nIgG and monoclonal rabbit anti-B7-1/CD80 IgG (OriGene\nTechnologies Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The immu-\nnostaining band was visualized and quantified using a\nBio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer as described\npreviously.16 Changes in nephrin and B7-1 protein\nexpression were determined by normalizing against the\ndensitometric intensity of its \u00df-actin (mouse monoclonal\nanti-\u00df-actin IgG) for each sample. For comparison, this\nratio was set at unity for normal-control samples and\nother lanes on the same gel were expressed as fold-change\nover this value.

Two micro-\ngrams of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using the\nsuperscript III first-stand synthesis system for RT-PCR kit\n(Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a\nSYBR Green dye I (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,\nUSA) with the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE\nApplied Biosystems) as described previously.16 Samples\nwere run as triplicates in separate tubes to permit quantifi-\ncation of the target gene normalized to glyceraldehyde-\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).

The percentage of reduction in dis-\nease severity in a treated group was calculated as before.16\nResults\nTherapeutic efficacy of valsartan\nEffects of valsartan on renal function and urinary protein excre-\ntion in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. The induction of disease by\nthe administration of OX-7 induced significant increases in\nplasma BUN and creatinine levels (Table 3) and a signifi-\ncant decrease in creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) levels, indi-\ncating damaged renal function. Treatment with valsartan\ndid not affect plasma BUN and creatinine levels. The Ccr\nlevels after valsartan treatment in the drinking water were\nnot decreased but increased, although the increases did not\nreach statistical significance. Twenty-four-hour urinary\nprotein excretions were measured from day 5 to day 6\n(Figure 1). The induction of disease produced a marked\nincrease in total proteinuria at day 6 (Figure 1A). Treatment\nwith valsartan significantly reduced disease-induced pro-\nteinuria in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of 50\nmg/l valsartan to the drinking water reduced proteinuria by\n21%. A maximal decrease of approximately 80% was seen\nequivalent to 160 mg/kg per day). However, the inhibitory\neffect was paradoxically attenuated, with a further increase\nin the valsartan dose to 1500 mg/l; the decrease in urinary\nprotein excretion was 55%, which was close to the effect of\nTable 2.

As\nshown in Figure 1B, valsartan therapy similarly reduced\ndisease-induced urinary albumin excretion in a dose-depen-\ndent manner, with the maximal reduction observed at 1000\nmg/l. Similar to its effect on proteinuria, a further increase\nin valsartan dose paradoxically attenuated the inhibitory\neffect to that of 500 mg/l valsartan on albuminuria (Figure\n1B). These results were consistent with those determined\nby the ratio of urinary albumin level and urinary creatinine\nlevel, as shown in Figure 1C.\nPAS staining. Representative glomeruli stained with PAS\nare shown in Figure 2A. The glomeruli from the disease-\ncontrol rats showed marked accumulation of ECM\nexpressed as PAS-positive material at day 6 (Figure 2A-DC)\ncompared to normal glomeruli (Figure 2A-NC). Increasing\ndecreases in glomerular matrix accumulation (Figure\ntation of the matrix score for each group. A significant (p <\n0.05) decrease of 50% in PAS staining was seen in rats\npared to disease-control animals (Figure 2A). However,\nthis inhibitory effect was attenuated by 9% when an even\nIF staining. In order to determine the contribution of spe-\ncific matrix proteins to the PAS-positive material, IF\nstaining for various specific glomerular proteins was per-\nformed. The results of the semi-quantitative analysis of\nthose stainings are shown in Figure 3. Substantial\nincreases in staining for matrix proteins were seen in dis-\nease-control animals (2.1-fold for FN EDA+, 5.3-fold for\ncollagen I and 1.87-fold for collagen III), compared to\nnormal-control animals (Figure 3A\u00adC). Treatment with\nvalsartan caused a dose-dependent reduction of these pro-\nteins. The maximally effective trend for reduction of col-\nlagen I and collagen III accumulation in glomeruli was\nseen at the valsartan dose of 1000 mg/l, while the maxi-\nmally effective trend for reduction of FN EDA+ accumu-\nlation was achieved at the dose of 500 mg/l.

As shown in Figure 4A\u00ad\nD, glomerular mRNA analysis revealed a three-fold\nincrease in TGF-\u00df1, a 17-fold increase in PAI-1, a\n12-fold increase in FN EDA+ and a 43-fold increase in\ntype I collagen mRNA expression in disease-control rats\ncompared to normal-control rats. Valsartan administra-\ntion significantly reduced the gene expression of TGF\u00df1,\nPAI-1, FN EDA+ and type I collagen in a dose-depen-\ndent manner. Consistently, the maximal effect for inhi-\nbition of TGF\u00df1, PAI-1, FN EDA+ and type I collagen\nexpression was achieved at the valsartan dose of 1000\nmg/l. Valsartan maximally reduced TGF\u00df1 mRNA\nand collagen I by 70%, respectively (Figure 4A\u00adD).\nThere was no further reduction of TGF\u00df1 mRNA\nexpression when the highest valsartan dose was given (p\nmg/l on the gene expression of PAI-1 and these matrix\nproteins appeared to be attenuated to that of the 500\nmg/l valsartan dose.\nTogether, these results indicate that increasing doses of\nvalsartan led to dose-dependent anti-fibrotic effects. The\nmaximal reduction in pathological glomerular fibrosis was\nseen at the same dose of valsartan (1000 mg/l) that caused\na maximal proteinuria reduction. Since some of the meas-\nures we employed to assess efficacy were actually less\neffectively blocked in the group receiving the highest dose\nof 1500 mg/l valsartan when compared to those in the group\nreceiving 1000 mg/l valsartan but were similar to those in\nthe group receiving 500 mg/l valsartan, it is likely that the\ntrue maximally therapeutic dose is between 500 mg/l to\nFigure 2.

Glomerular mRNA expression of\nrenin is shown in Figure 5. Induction of disease significantly\nstimulated glomerular renin mRNA expression by 3.5-fold\n(p < 0.05) at day 6. Treatment with valsartan in the drinking\nwater significantly further stimulated glomerular renin\nmRNAexpression in a dose-dependent manner by interrupt-\ning a negative feedback loop.Amaximal increase of approx-\ndose of valsartan; however, the increase of renin expression\nin the highest dose of the valsartan-treated group was not\nsignificant when compared to that in 1000 mg/l valsartan-\ntreated animals (p > 0.05). These results also confirm that\nthe dose around 1000 mg/l of valsartan in drinking water\nmay reach the maximally effective dose.\nEffect of valsartan at optimal dose on\npodocyte injury\nFrom data presented above, it is clear that valsartan reduced\nalbuminuria/proteinuria and fibrotic disease markers in a\ndose-dependent manner in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis, with\nmaximal effects observed at 1000 mg/l. It has been shown\nthat proteinuria is often the result of podocyte injury in\nhuman diseases and animal models, including anti-Thy 1.1\non podocytes in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis was also evaluated.\nAlthough the primary injury, i.e. injection of a comple-\nment-activating anti-Thy 1.1 antibody, OX-7, is highly\nselective for renal mesangial cells, intraglomerular capillar-\nies are destabilized in the course of mesangial cell destruc-\ntion, leading to capillary dilation and intraglomerular\nmicroaneurysms after disease induction.13 All of these\nchanges will contribute to secondary podocyte damage via\naltered physical forces and/or potential biochemical altera-\ntions of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM),19,22\nwhich may lead to the occurrence of proteinuria in anti-Thy\n1.1 nephritis. Indeed, diminished staining of podocin, a\ncritical component of the podocyte slit diaphragm of podo-\ncyte,23 was observed in the nephritic glomeruli on day 6\n(Figure 6A-DC) when compared to that in normal glomer-\nuli (Figure 6A-NC). However, staining intensities for\npodocin were effectively restored after valsartan treatment\n(Figure 6A-Val). The results of the quantitative analysis of\nIF staining for podocin are shown on the right of Figure 6A.\nWT-1 is a nuclear protein specific for podocyte and parietal\nglomerular epithelial cells in the adult kidney.24,25 WT-1-\npositive cells within the glomerular tuft excluding the pari-\netal epithelium were counted in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritic rats\nand the cell number per glomerular was calculated as\ndescribed in the method. As illustrated by IF staining in\nFigure 6B, consistent with the staining of podocin, nephritic\nglomeruli from disease-control rats contained much fewer\npodocytes than did glomeruli from normal-control rats\npodocytes per glomerular cross section in nephritic rats\ntreated with valsartan was 50% higher than that in disease\nBy Western blot analyses of the isolated glomeruli from\ndifferent groups of rats, we also observed that the protein\nlevels of nephrin in nephritic glomeruli, another important\npodocyte slit diaphragm-associated protein,26 were sub-\nstantially down-regulated by 47%, compared with normal\nglomeruli. Valsartan treatment significantly increased the\nco-stimulation factor of lymphocytes, is synthesized in\npodocytes in response to slit-diaphragm protein rearrange-\nment and foot process effacement.27 B7-1 protein levels\nwere also markedly increased in nephritic glomeruli (Figure\n7C), which was consistent with the changes of the two\nslit diaphragm-associated proteins nephrin and podocin.\nFigure 3.

In con-\ntrast, as a marker of podocyte injury, mRNA expression of\nB7-1 was significantly increased in nephritic glomeruli by\n240%, which was reversed by valsartan treatment (Figure 8D).\nCollectively, these data indicated that valsartan treat-\nment given at a dose that maximally inhibited proteinuria\nand ECM deposition also prevented podocyte dysfunction\nin anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis by preserving expression of slit-\ndiaphragm proteins and counter-regulating pathogenic\nmolecules involved in podocyte injury.\nDiscussion\nIn this study of the anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis model, we\nobserved that valsartan reduced albuminuria/proteinuria in\na dose-dependent manner, with the maximal reduction seen\nequivalent to 160 mg/kg per day) and no further reduction\nat a yet higher dose of valsartan (1500 mg/l of drinking\nwater). Together with the previous report that the maximal\neffect of valsartan in the type 2 diabetic rat model was also\nseen at their highest tested dose, 160 mg/kg per day,5 which\nwas the same dose required to maximize proteinuria reduc-\ntion in the present study, it is likely that the maximally\ntherapeutic dose of valsartan is close to 160 mg/kg per day\nin animal models. In the present study, we did not measure\nrat blood pressure. However, it has been repeatedly shown\nthat the model of nephritis in rats is normotensive.12,14,28\nThe anti-proteinuric effect of valsartan therefore may be\nindependent of blood pressure.

The dose-dependent anti-proteinu-\nric effect of valsartan in this model therefore may not be\ndue to any reduction in GFR.\nIn corroboration with the effects on proteinuria, valsar-\ntan in this study also resulted in a dose-dependent improve-\nment in kidney pathology. The valsartan dose that achieved\na maximal proteinuria reduction also induced maximal\nreductions in glomerular over-expression of TGF\u00df1 and\nPAI-1, two powerful fibrogenic molecules, and the accu-\nmulation of ECM protein. We and others have used other\nAng II blockers in the same animal model previously,12,29\nshowing that increasing the dose of enalapril or losartan or\ntelmisartan above the respective maximum antihyperten-\nsive dose produced additional antifibrotic effects in\nnephritic glomeruli. These findings in the anti-Thy 1.1\nmodel are also consistent with the report in the 5/6 nephrec-\ntomized rats, showing that a much higher dose of ARB\n(losartan, 500 mg/kg/d) reduced histological evidence of\nrenal fibrosis more effectively than a lower and conven-\ntional dose (50 mg/kg/d) despite a similar effect on blood\npressure.3 All these studies suggest that dosing is very\nimportant. At the lower doses of ARB, only a moderate\nantifibrotic effect was seen. It is likely that these doses are\ninsufficient to block most of the abnormally expressed\nangiotensin type 1 receptor (AT-1R) in the kidney. Maximal\nrenal protection may require adequate doses of ARB.\nWe have observed that glomerular Ang II levels are sig-\nnificantly increased in isolated nephritic glomeruli vs. normal\nglomeruli.30 The antifibrotic action of valsartan is clearlyAng\nII mediated. However, the mechanisms underlying the reno-\nprotective effect of valsartan independent of blood pressure\nlowering are complex and not fully understood. Generally,\nbecause Ang II stimulates mesangial cell proliferation,31\u00ad33\nblocking its action sufficiently with enough dosing of valsar-\ntan may maximally reduce proliferation so that the number of\nactivated mesangial cells overproducing TGF\u00df and PAI-1 is\nreduced and expression of downstream fibrogenic molecules,\nsuch as collagen I and FN, is significantly reduced maximally.\nIn addition, it is believed that proteinuria is one of the most\nimportant factors leading to the progression of kidney dis-\nease. Valsartan sharply reduced proteinuria. The exact mecha-\nnisms of this action of ARB have not been completely\nelucidated. With increasing attention being paid recently to\nthe multiple roles of the podocyte in maintaining glomerular\nfunction,17,19,21 several lines of studies have demonstrated that\nARB has a potential to protect podocytes from being dam-\naged and thereby promoting reduction of proteinuria.34\u00ad37\nFigure 8.

The immunohisto-\nlogical staining of podocin and WT-1 and the protein level of\nnephrin dramatically decreased, and those mRNA expres-\nsions for podocin, nephrin and WT-1 also decreased in dis-\neased glomeruli. Podocin and nephrin are reported to be the\ncritical molecules for maintaining the barrier function of the\npodocyte slit diaphragm.23,26 Dysfunction of podocin and\nnephrin may cause the consequent podocyte shape changes,\nsuch as the effacement of the foot processes, and may attenu-\nate the contractile function of the podocyte against the GBM\ndistention and then leads to loss of adhesion to the underlying\nnormally expressed on the surface of B cells and other anti-\ngen-presenting cells (APC) cells.38,39 More recently, it has\nbeen demonstrated as a de novo synthesized molecule that is\ninvolved in the induction of foot process effacement and dis-\nruption of the slit diaphragm protein complex in the podocyte\nin response to a variety of stress conditions.27 In agreement\nwith the changes of the two slit diaphragm-associated pro-\nteins nephrin and podocin, mRNA expression and protein\nproduction of B7-1 were significantly increased in diseased\nglomeruli in this study. Taken together with all of the observa-\ntions on podocytes, it is conceivable that the marked proteinu-\nria in anti-Thy 1.1 glomerulonephritis resulted from the\npodocyte dysfunction and even reduction of the podocyte\nnumber. These findings suggest that not only mesangial cell\nlysis and proliferation, but also the disorder of podocyte func-\ntion, are involved in the development of mesangial alterations\nand thereby further promote proteinuria and ultimately glo-\nmerular sclerosis in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. However, the\npodocytic expression of nephrin, podocin and WT-1 was well\npreserved and the elevated B7-1 in injured podocytes was\ncounter-regulated when the optimal dose of valsartan was\ngiven. Since suppression of RAS markedly lowers glomeru-\nlar pressure, lessening the mechanical stress with valsartan\nmay directly impose on podocytes. Moreover, it has been\nshown that Ang II locally causes podocyte apoptosis, podo-\ncyte actin rearrangement, increased TGF\u00df1 and PAI-1 levels,\nand reduction of nephrin levels.37,40\u00ad42 Thus, another mecha-\nnism whereby valsartan may protect podocytes is by inhibit-\ning Ang II's direct and deleterious effects on podocytes. In\naddition, there might be a pathogenic cross-talk that occurred\nbetween mesangial cell (cause) and podocyte (injury) in anti-\nThy 1.1 nephritis.20,21 Ang II may act as the messenger of the\ninjury signal from mesangial cell to podocyte in this model.\nBlockingAng II's action with valsartan may block this poten-\ntial cross-talk, thereby reducing the response of podocyte to\ninjury. Very recently, Villa et al. also observed that high-dose\ntelmisartan treatment reduced podocyte damage as shown by\ncounting cells positive for both WT-1 and desmin and deter-\nmining the expression of D1gh, a scaffold protein on podo-\ncyte in the same model.29 Importantly, the protective effect of\nhigh-dose telmisartan on podocyte injury strongly correlates\nwith the reduction of proteinuria.29 Apparently, podocyte pro-\ntection may explain the reason why therapy with valsartan at\nthe maximally effective dosage markedly decreased albumi-\nnuria/proteinuria.\nAn interesting finding in the study presented here is that\nafter a point, increasing the dose did not lead to further\nreduction in any measure of disease, which was also seen in\nour previous study.12 It therefore seems impossible to com-\npletely prevent the fibrotic process with ARB alone at any\ndose. Together with the data that no additivity was seen\nwhen enalapril and losartan were combined at maximal\nanti-fibrotic doses,12 these results strongly imply that the\ncritical therapeutic factor for maximizing the renoprotec-\ntion ofARB is dose optimization before adding other agents\nto ARB at conventionally anti-hypertensive doses.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that supramaximal doses of val-\nsartan did not cause any noticeable side effects in the pre-\nsent model, while reducing both proteinuria and renal\nfibrosis. However, attention should be paid to the potential\nside effects of high doses of ARB when a longer-term treat-\nment is employed in patients.\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates a clear\ndose-dependent therapeutic response for valsartan in the\nanti-Thy 1.1 rat model. Proteinuria was reduced more\neffectively at higher doses of valsartan. The maximal anti-\nproteinuric dose of valsartan also conferred a maximal\nreduction in renal fibrosis, associated with an additional\nprotective effect against podocyte dysfunction. Importantly,\nthese studies further illustrate the concept that ARB at any\ndose may not be sufficient to completely prevent kidney\nfibrosis. Combination therapy with other agents that act\nthrough different pathways may be crucial.\n"
