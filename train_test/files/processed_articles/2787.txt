Most recent studies have noted the generally J-shaped or U-shaped\nrelationship of women's education with their labor force participation (Reddy 1979;\nKlasen and Pieters 2015). As national participation rates have continued to decline over\nthe last few decades (Abraham 2013; Chatterjee, Murgai, and Rama 2015), cohort shifts\nout of low levels of education to intermediate and secondary education have been\nblamed for much of this decline (Afridi, Dinkelman, and Mahajan 2016).\nNevertheless, the curvilinear relationship itself has received surprisingly little\ndirect research attention. Most studies note the U-shaped relationship, but they usually\nfail to take the next step of trying to explain it empirically. This is especially surprising\nsince the downward sloping part of the curve is so counter-theoretical. Neoclassical\ntheory predicts that increases in women's education should usually lead to a rise in\nwomen's labor force participation rate. More education makes you more productive, so\nyour potential earnings rise, creating a greater incentive to join the labor force and\nsubstitute employment for leisure or home labor.\nIndia is unusual but not unique for having lower rates of labor force participation\namong adult women with secondary education. Among 71 countries with appropriate\ncensus data in the IPUMS-I data archive (Minnesota Population Center 2017), only 14\ncountries have lower rates of labor force participation for adult women with secondary\neducation than for women who complete less than primary school. India has the second\nlargest gap (19% vs. 35%), exceeded only by Rwanda (72% vs. 92%). But several other\ncountries also show lower rates of labor force participation for secondary educated\n84%). So, this counter-theoretical result deserves more research attention than it has\nbeen given.\nPast studies have suggested that both cultural factors, such as norms restricting the\nmobility of women, and structural factors, such as a lack of appropriate job\nopportunities for educated women, play important roles in determining the U-shaped\nrelationship between women's education and labor force participation in India (Das and\nDesai 2003; Das 2006). But these cultural and structural explanations are more often\nasserted than tested.\nTheory also predicts that the relationship between education and employment is\ngoverned by both an income and a substitution effect. The substitution effect implies\nthat educated women command higher wages that would encourage them to substitute\nparticipation in the labor force for leisure or home work. The income effect, on the\nother hand, posits that educated women have higher incomes for the same amount of\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 857\nwork, encouraging them to devote more time to leisure or home work. In addition, and\nmore importantly, educated women tend to marry educated men with higher incomes,\nso the higher (unearned) family incomes would further discourage women's\nparticipation in the labor market. Combined with a cultural norm that confers higher\nstatus on women at home, other family income can act as a powerful deterrent to\neducated women's labor force participation. Where patriarchal norms are less dominant,\nthe substitution effect should overshadow the income effect (Brinton, Lee, and Parish\n1995). But in India, we would expect the income effect to be especially strong.\nHowever, most past studies in India have used National Sample Survey data in\nwhich it is not possible to separate other family members' income from a woman's own\nearnings, thus making it difficult to distinguish income and substitution effects. The\npresent study uses the India Human Development Surveys (IHDS), which measure both\na woman's own earnings and other household income, thus permitting a better\nseparation of income and substitution effects for educated women. While the results\nconfirm a strong negative effect of other family income on women's labor force\nparticipation, they again find a U-shaped relationship between women's education and\nher labor force participation, even after taking into account other family income. The\nother family income controls make the negative sloping part of the curve flatter and the\npositively sloping part steeper, but the relationship remains curvilinear rather than\nuniformly positive.\nA further analysis examines the relationship between women's education and three\ndifferent categories of work: salaried positions paid monthly, casual wage work, and\nwork in family farms or businesses. For salary work, the expected positive linear\nrelationship is observed: the more education she has, the more likely she is to work in a\nsalaried position. However, for women employed in their family farms and businesses,\nor as wage labor, the relationship is also linear but negative. The observed U-curve is a\nresolution of these separate linear relationships.\nThe negative relationships are likely because more educated women do not want to\nwork in jobs that do not match their aspirations. The positive relationship with salaried\npositions is not sufficient to produce the expected overall positive relationship because\nthere are not enough salaried positions open to women with moderate levels of\neducation. The paper concludes by noting the possible importance of occupational sex\nsegregation in excluding women from clerical and sales jobs that in most countries have\nbeen a major source of employment for moderately educated women.\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n858 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2. Literature review\nWhile \"economic factors largely determine male participation in employment, the\nfactors that influence a woman's participation in work are varied and include\nreproductive, demographic, social, religious and cultural factors\" (Srivastava and\nSrivastava 2010). Of these, education and family income are especially important\nbecause of their prominent role in labor supply theory.\nTheories of human capital predict that an increase in skills would provide women a\ngreater opportunity to earn higher wages, and this in turn would increase women's labor\nforce participation (Smith and Ward 1985; Goldin 1990; England, Garcia-Beaulieu, and\nRoss 2004). In most developed countries, increases in education cause an increase in\nwomen's labor force participation (Cain 1966; Tienda, Donato, and Cordero-Guzman\n1992; England, Gornick, and Shafer 2012). Interestingly, however, the story is often\nquite different in the low and middle-income countries. In Peru, King (1990) reported\nthat while education was associated with a decline in women's labor force participation,\nit did increase the proportion of women in paid employment. On the other hand, in\nEcuador, Jakubson and Psacharopoulos (1992) find that schooling has a positive effect\non women's labor force participation, even though the effect is small. The predicted\nprobability of labor force participation of a woman with 16 years of schooling (other\ntraits unchanged) is 11 percentage points higher than for a woman with no schooling.\nReports from South Asia have often highlighted a generally negative relation\nbetween increased levels of education and decreases in women's workforce\nparticipation rate, noting that illiterate women are more likely to be employed than\nmore educational detail (e.g., Reddy 1979) find a J-shaped relationship between\nwomen's education and their labor force participation with increases only at the highest\nshaped relationship with schooling beyond the junior/middle level enhances women's\nwage work participation.\nComplex socioeconomic phenomena underlie this paradox. Explanations generally\nrely on some combination of structural and normative ideas: the disincentives from\nother family income, restrictive gender norms (especially those that attribute higher\nsocial status to nonworking women), greater emphasis on domestic duties and child-\nrearing in a newly competitive educational system, and the lack of `suitable' work for\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 859\neducated women. But it is difficult to test these explanations empirically with existing\ndata.\n2.2 Other family income\nIncreases in women's labor force participation as education increases (as predicted by\nhuman capital theory) could be depressed somewhat due to the income effect of other\nfamily income. More educated women are likely to marry more educated men with\nhigher incomes. If family income is high, women would have less incentive to work\nrising incomes of Indian households have enabled Indian women to withdraw from the\nlabor market and focus on their role in `status production.' As with the United States at\nthe turn of the century, one of the markers of the household having attained a middle-\nclass status may be to ensure that women from these burgeoning middle classes do not\nhave to work (Treas 1987). Using unit level data from the National Employment Survey\nin urban areas of India, Klasen and Pieters (2015) have confirmed that rising levels of\nhousehold income play an important role in declining rates of women's labor force\nparticipation.\nIt has always been more socially acceptable for women of lower castes (such as\nAdivasis, Dalits, and Other Backward Classes) to be in the labor market (Kingdon and\nUnni 2001). Women from the higher castes tend to face greater restrictions on their\nmobility. However, women from families of the middle and lower castes with improved\nsocial standing also prefer to stay at home as an effort at `Sanskritization' (Srinivas\n1966; Chen and Dreze 1995), an attempt to follow a more Brahminical way of life. The\ngreater the seclusion for the woman, the greater would be the prestige for the family\nCaste also has an impact on the educational opportunities women face (Dunn\n1993). Thus, part of the higher rates of labor force participation among illiterate women\nmay be a result of their lower caste status. Similarly, some of the decline in labor force\nparticipation with more education may result from the higher concentrations of higher-\nstatus Forward Castes (such as Brahmins, Kayasthas, Kshatriyas, etc.) among\nmoderately educated women.\nHistorical perspectives on women's labor force participation in India note that a\nmajority of female workers have been involved in agriculture (e.g., Nath 1968).\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n860 http://www.demographic-research.org\nConsequently, women's labor force participation has always been higher for rural then\nurban areas. Few women have been employed in the modern sector, where educational\ncredentials are more important. India is one of the exceptional countries where the\nmodern sector has experienced a fall in women's work force participation despite\nA slow shift in the industrial structure out of agriculture (Abraham 2013) has been\na leading cause of recent declines in women's labor force participation (Mehrotra and\nPerida 2017). Critics of India's Structural Adjustment Program, introduced in 1991,\nhave argued that these policies also led to a decline in women's employment because of\ndeclines in the unorganized sector (Mundle 1992). Others (e.g., Papola 1994), on the\nother hand, proposed that a newly restructured economy could favor the unorganized\nsector. where wages were low and working conditions poor, perhaps having a favorable\nimpact on women's employment. In India, the growth in the female share of\nemployment in industries and services is behind other South and Southeast Asian\ncountries (other than Nepal), although declines in female employment have long been\ntheorized to follow the early stages of development (Boserup 1970). Pampel and\nTanaka (1986) and Mammen and Paxson (2000), for instance, observe the expected U-\nshaped relationship between women's labor force participation and GDP per capita. All\nof these studies point to the importance of the type of jobs available as a central\nmoderating influence on the relationship between education and women's labor force\nparticipation.\n3. Why IHDS?\nThe IHDS enjoys several advantages over other surveys for analyzing employment. It\ngains a more complete measure of women's labor force participation by reviewing each\nhousehold economic activity (own farm work, nonfarm businesses, wage or salaried\nlabor) and asks which members participate in each activity. This gives a clearer picture\nof who is participating in the labor force than does a single question about each\nperson's principal or secondary activity. Even if a woman's principal and secondary\nactivities are household work, she could still be engaged in seasonal farm work or\nassisting other household enterprises. Another advantage of IHDS is that unlike\nprevious studies that have information only on total household consumption (which is\nendogenous to the woman's own earnings) or husband's and other family members'\nwage earnings, IHDS has more complete estimates of other family incomes. Abraham\n(2013), for instance, recognizes the theoretical importance of other family income, but\ncan only use household consumption (\"a robust proxy\") from the NSS. He finds an\nunexpected curvilinear U-shape relationship of women's labor force participation with\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 861\nhousehold consumption levels for urban households, a result that we suspect is driven\nby the additional women's income in high consumption households. In the IHDS\nmeasure, the relationship is consistently linear and negative, as theory would predict.\nKlasen and Pieters (2015) measure total other household earnings in their NSS\ndata but try to avoid problems of self-employed incomes by restricting their sample to\nurban areas and imputing self-employed earnings based on earnings of similar\nemployees (\"a fairly rough approximation\"). The IHDS has a more direct measure of\nself-employed incomes and also has several additional measures of unearned income\n(e.g., remittances, rents, pensions). According to the two waves of IHDS, about 45% of\nhouseholds are engaged in own farm work and 20% have at least one nonfarm business\n(29% in urban areas). Moreover, 46% of households report some type of unearned\nincome. Thus, it is difficult to measure the impact of other household income effects if\nthese income sources are ignored.\n4. Hypotheses\nThe present study uses the IHDS data to test the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: More women's education is associated with a decline in women's\nlabor force participation rate (LFPR) up to secondary education, with a slight\nuptick for postsecondary education.\nHypothesis 1 restates the often-observed relationship between Indian women's\nlabor force participation and education as U-shaped. The next hypotheses evaluate two\ntheories that could explain the U-shaped relationship. While Hypothesis 2 evaluates the\n`income effect,' Hypothesis 3 examines a labor market hypothesis.\nHypothesis 2a: Higher levels of other family income are associated with a decline\nin women's LFPR.\nHypothesis 2b: Women with more education live in households with higher levels\nof other family income, and those higher income levels explain the initial declines\nin their labor force participation.\nAs husband's and other family income increases, women's incentive to work\ndeclines. Holding constant other family income should straighten out the U-curve and\nreveal the more theoretically conventional positive increases with increasing education.\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n862 http://www.demographic-research.org\nHypothesis 3a: An increase in education is associated with an increase in women's\nemployment in salaried jobs.\nHypothesis 3b: An increase in education is associated with a decline in women's\nemployment in their own family farms and businesses.\nHypothesis 3c: An increase in education is associated with a decline in women's\nemployment in agricultural and nonagricultural wage work.\nIt is difficult for women with little education to get high-quality salaried jobs. With\npostsecondary school education better quality jobs become more accessible, so the\nhigher returns to a better-quality job and the increase in social status associated with it\nlead to more employment. On the other hand, educated women would not want to work\nin outside jobs perceived to be below their educational level, as it lowers their social\nstatus. Therefore, employment in manual labor or even household enterprises would\ndecline.\nHypotheses 3a to 3c explain the U-shaped relationship only when different types\nof work are aggregated together. While on one hand there will be a steady increase in\ndemand for white-collar jobs among educated women, these jobs would be available\nonly to women with the highest levels of education. Because there is a limited supply of\nsuch jobs, women with moderate levels of education are left out of the labor market.\n5. Data and variables\nThe present study uses data from the two waves of IHDS (India Human Development\n2004\u00ad2005, spread across all the states and union territories of India (except for the\nsmall territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep). The sample covers 384\nindividuals. In 2011\u00ad2012 a second wave reinterviewed the same households with an\n83% recontact rate. The IHDS2 sample was augmented slightly to adjust for higher\nattrition in urban areas. The analysis sample is restricted to married women ages 25\u00ad59.\nMany women below 25 are still enrolled in an educational institution, and women\nabove the age of 59 would be likely to retire.\nThe IHDS is a multitopic survey that encompasses different modules related to\nhealth, education, employment, marriage, gender relations, economic status, social\ncapital, and other issues. The household economic questionnaire was usually answered\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 863\nby the head of the household or by someone who had sufficient knowledge about the\nincome, expenditure, and employment status of household members.\nMeasuring women's employment can be especially challenging because often\nwomen are involved in part-time or seasonal jobs, or they could work from home, or\nthey may participate in the labor market only in times of a family crisis (Bener\u00eda 1982;\nworkforce participation is more detailed than for other surveys. Unlike the NSS, which\nasks for a woman's principal and secondary status activities, the IHDS has separate\nmodules for different types of work (e.g., on the household farm, wage labor, in\nhousehold nonfarm businesses) and asks which household members participated in each\ntype of work during the previous year. In the present study anyone who worked for at\nleast 240 hours in the previous year across all types of work is considered to be in the\nlabor force. Caring for household animals, collection of firewood or other fuels, and\nfetching water from public sources were not included as labor force participation as\nthese are usually regarded as normal household chores in India.\nIn addition to the overall measure of labor force participation, the analysis also\ndisaggregates work participation into three types: self-employment in own farm and\nnonfarm businesses, salaried work (defined as monthly remuneration), and casual\nagricultural and nonagricultural wage labor paid daily. For each category of work, if the\nwoman works for more than 0 hours per year in that type of work and for greater than\n240 hours per year in any kind of work, they are considered to be working in that work\ncategory. It should be noted that women can be considered employed in multiple work\ncategories.\nWomen's education is divided into six categories: illiterate, preprimary (0\u00ad4\nyears), primary and postprimary (5\u00ad9 years), secondary (10\u00ad11 years), higher\nsecondary (12+ years with no degree), and college graduate or higher.\nLike employment, personal earnings and household incomes are also aggregate\nmeasures built up across many survey modules. In addition to income and benefits from\neach type of work, the survey also asked about household income from remittances,\nrental and property income, pensions, and government programs (India Human\nDevelopment Survey 2016b). Other family income was calculated for each household\nmember by subtracting that person's earnings from total family income. For household\nenterprises with multiple household workers, each member's own earnings were\ncalculated as their proportion of total household hours worked multiplied by the net\nincome from that enterprise. The log of other household income was calculated except\nfor a small percentage (2.1%) of women with negative or negligible other household\nincomes below Rs.1000 (usually households with crop failures resulting in negative net\nincomes). A separate dummy variable identified these women, who were then assigned\nthe floor value of ln(1000) for other household incomes.\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n864 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThe analysis also includes controls for years of husband's education (a continuous\nvariable ranging from 0 to 15); the number of children under six and six to fifteen in the\nhousehold; the number of married women in the household; age in five-year categories;\nfour caste groups (Forward Castes, Other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes \u00ad SCs or\nDalits \u00ad and Scheduled Tribes \u00ad STs or Adivasis); three religious groups (Hindus,\nMuslims, and other minority religions); urban or rural residence; and dummy variables\nfor state fixed effects.\n6. Analysis\n6.1 Descriptive statistics\nTable 1 gives descriptive statistics of all variables for the sample of 72,620 currently\nmarried women aged 25\u00ad59. Of these, 41.6% are employed in some kind of work for at\nwork in family farms or businesses, and 20.3% in agricultural and nonagricultural wage\nwork. In the sample, 47.4% of women are illiterate, 26.7% have completed primary\nschool education, and only 5% are college graduates.\nTable 1: Summary statistics\nMean Std. dev.\nEducation\nCaste\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 865\nTable 1: (Continued)\nMean Std. dev.\nReligion\nAge\nSource: IHDS1 and IHDS2.\nThe bivariate relationship between women's LFP and their education is J-shaped,\nas has been found in most previous research. Table 2 shows that increases in education\nfrom none to completed secondary school are associated with a steady, steep decline in\nwomen's labor force participation from 53.3% to 22.4%. There is a slight increase in\nwomen's labor force participation thereafter; 28.1% of women who are college\ngraduates are employed.\nTable 2: Labor force participation and other family income by women's\neducation\nAny work\nMean of\nhusband's years\nof education\nMean (log of\nother family\nincome)\nExponential\n(Rupees)\nSalaried\nwork\nFamily farm\nor business\nCasual wage\nlabor\nSource: IHDS1 and IHDS2.\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n866 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAs expected, a married woman's education is also closely related to her husband's\neducation and, thus, the income of her family. Column 2 reports the close relationship\nbetween wives' and husbands' education \u00ad the familiar fact of marriage homogamy.\nPartly as a result of this homogamy, column 3 reports the quite linear relationship with\nthe logarithm of other family income. Each year of a woman's education is associated\nwith a similar proportional increase of her family's income. For convenience, column 4\ntranslates those annual averages to rupees at 2012 prices. The bivariate association of\nother family income with women's labor force participation is also predictably negative\nand linear (results not shown). Of women whose families have less than Rs 8000\nincome, only 21.5% are in the labor force. The research question is whether these other\nfamily income relationships are sufficient to explain the steep decline of women's labor\nforce participation in column 1. We address that question in the next section.\nFinally, columns 5 through 7 show the bivariate relationships of a woman's\neducation with the three types of employment: salaried work, family enterprises (farm\nor nonfarm), and casual wage labor. Each of these is a fairly linear relationship. With\nrising education, employment in salaried work increases steadily, falls dramatically for\ncasual wage labor, and falls more gradually for work in family farms and businesses.\nWhat is important here is that whereas each relationship is quite linear, aggregated\ntogether the relationship becomes the familiar curvilinear J-shape (column 1).\n6.2 Logistic regressions of labor force participation\nThree logistic regression models predicting the log odds of a woman being employed\nare estimated. In the first model, the log odds of a woman being employed are estimated\nusing only the education categories. The estimated coefficients reflect the J-shape curve\nseen in the bivariate relationship of Table 2. The odds decline steadily from illiteracy to\nsecondary completion and then bend upwards for higher secondary and college\ngraduates.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 867\nTable 3: Logistic regressions of women's labor force participation\nEducation (reference=illiterate)\nCaste (reference=Forward Castes)\nReligion (reference=Hindu)\nState fixed effects Yes Yes Yes\nSource: IHDS1 and IHDS2.\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n868 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThe second model adds other family income to the education categories. Not\nsurprisingly, the estimated effect is quite large: a doubling of other family income (a\nlittle more than half a standard deviation) would reduce the average woman's labor\nforce participation rate from 41.6% to 33.4%. Our interest, however, is mainly in the\nconsequences for the education estimates. The estimated decline in the log odds of\nemployment from illiteracy to completed secondary schooling is reduced from \u00ad1.403\nin Model 1 to \u00ad1.038 in Model 2. The estimate is still sharply negative, however;\ncontrolling for the income effect does not transform the education association into the\nexpected positive linear relationship (i.e., Hypothesis 2b is not supported). A more\nnoticeable change can be seen for the observed uptick among women with higher\nsecondary education and college diplomas. The log odds for college graduates being in\nthe labor force are 0.65 greater than those with secondary education after controls for\nother family income as compared to only 0.34 in Model 1.\nThe third model adds basic control variables: husband's education, wife's age,\nnumber of children under 6 and under 16, number of married women in the household,\nreligion, caste, area of residence, and dummy variables for state fixed effects. Several of\nthese relationships are quite strong. Dalits and especially Adivasis are much more likely\nto be in the labor force than Forward Castes, even at the same levels of education and\nother family income. Because Dalit and Adivasi women are clustered at lower levels of\neducation, some of the steep negative relationship at lower levels of education is a\nconsequence of these disadvantaged caste backgrounds, not educational levels.\nSimilarly, the Forward Caste concentration among college graduates masks some of the\npositive effects of higher education on labor force participation. With controls, the\neducation relationship assumes a clear U-shape so that college graduates are now the\ngroup most likely to be in the labor force, other factors being equal.\nThe effect of the income and other controls on the education relationship can be\nseen more clearly in the predicted probabilities displayed in Figure 1. In comparison to\nthe bivariate relationship (the heavy line), the graph after controls is more U-shaped.\nThough the control for other family income doesn't make the association completely\npositive, it does reduce the negatively sloped part of the curve and shows a much\ngreater increase in the probability of being employed at higher levels of education. The\npredicted probability of a woman college graduate being employed after controlling for\nother family income and background controls is 0.55 compared to 0.28 in the case\nwithout controls. This gives support to the `income effect,' whereby women belonging\nto richer families have higher education but withdraw from the labor force because they\ndo not have as great a need to work for additional income as compared to women\nbelonging to poorer families.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 869\nFigure 1: Predicted probabilities of a married woman aged 25\u00ad59 being\nemployed by education levels\nEven though the income effect does explain a part of the paradoxical relationship\nbetween a woman's LFPR and her educational level, it doesn't explain it fully.\nSecondary school matriculates are still less likely to be in the labor force than the\nuneducated despite their higher human capital that should make employment more\nattractive.\nUrban residence has a powerful negative effect on women's labor force\nparticipation, but, interestingly, a similar U-shape relationship with education is\nobserved in both urban and rural areas (results not reported). In both rural and urban\nareas, women with completed secondary school have the lowest levels of labor force\nparticipation, which rise with postsecondary education in both rural and urban areas\n(slightly stronger in urban areas) and decline from no education in both rural and urban\nareas (slightly stronger in rural areas). The strong but mostly additive effect of urban\nlocation suggests that to understand the U-shape curve, it may be necessary to observe\nthe different kinds of jobs that educated women perform compared to the jobs of\nilliterate women.\nIlliterate Preprimary Primary and\npostprimary\nSecondary Higher\nsecondary\nCollege and\nhigher\nNo controls\nControl for other family income\nAll controls\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n870 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2 above on the types of jobs held by working women shows that less educated\nwomen more often work on the family farm or as wage laborers; college graduates\nmore likely are found in the more secure (and prestigious) salaried positions. As a next\nstep, the study evaluates the role of job types by estimating three multivariate logistic\nregression equations to predict the log odds of a woman being employed in each type of\nwork. Each equation controls for the same variables as Model 3 of Table 3 for overall\nwork. Table 4 shows the results of the three logistic regressions. Again, calculating\npredicted probabilities for each educational level provides a more accessible picture of\nthe education relationships (see Figure 2).\nTable 4: Logistic regressions of three types of women's labor force\nparticipation\nSalaried Family farm or business Casual wage labor\nEducation (reference = illiterate)\nCaste (reference = Forward Castes)\nReligion (reference=Hindu)\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 871\nTable 4: (Continued)\nSalaried Family farm or business Casual wage labor\nState fixed effects Yes Yes Yes\nSource: IHDS1 and IHDS2.\nFigure 2: Predicted probabilities of a married woman aged 25\u00ad59 being\nemployed for each of the three categories of work by education levels\nIlliterate Preprimary Primary and\npostprimary\nSecondary Higher\nsecondary\nCollege and\nhigher\nWork in family farms or\nbusinesses\nWork in agricultural or non-\nagricultural wage work\nWork in salaried jobs\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n872 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFor salaried positions, more education has the expected positive relationship with a\ngreater likelihood of work. The predicted probability of a currently married woman\neducation level increases from being illiterate to being a college graduate. On the other\nhand, all other kinds of work show declining probabilities as her education level\nincreases. The predicted probability of her being employed in a family farm or business\nThese results are consistent with an explanation of women's labor force\nparticipation that educated women look mainly for better quality jobs, especially\nsalaried work. The inference might be that if all or most available jobs were salaried,\nIndian women would show the usual positive relationship of higher rates of\nemployment with more education. However, such jobs are limited and are accessible\nmainly with higher levels of education. If appropriate jobs were available for women\nwith intermediate levels of education, we might expect higher levels of their labor force\nparticipation. The answers to the remaining paradoxical U-shape relationship should\nbest be sought in the demand side of the Indian labor market.\n7. Discussion and conclusion\nThe present study examined the often-observed J-shaped relationship between\neducation and Indian women's labor force participation. This relationship, especially\nthe strong decline from illiteracy to secondary completion, is contrary to what would be\npredicted by most human capital theory. Secondary school graduates have more skills\nand human capital than those with only primary education; and those with completed\nprimary schooling have some literacy and numeracy compared to those without any\neducation. These skills should make them more productive workers with higher\nearnings and thus more likely to be in the labor force. But the opposite is the case for\nIndian women.\nThe analysis takes advantage of the IHDS as the only national survey in India that\nhas direct measures of other household income. The results show support for the other\nincome effect; the greater the income women's households have apart from their own\nearnings, the lower the chances of the woman being in the labor force. But other family\nincomes hardly explain all of the lower labor force participation of women with\nmoderate levels of education. Caste and other background factors also explain some of\nthese differences. But even after taking into account other family income, caste, and\nother background characteristics, the relationship between education and women's labor\nforce participation becomes just U-shaped but not uniformly positive. Although the\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 873\nlower participation rates of secondary school graduates are attenuated after the controls,\nthey do not disappear. However, after controls, education beyond secondary levels does\nlead to a much steeper increase in the predicted probabilities of being a part of the labor\nforce.\nFurther analysis points to the kinds of work available and the lack of demand for\nmoderately educated women's more skilled labor as the main suspect for explaining the\ndeclining segment of the U-curve. For salaried work, the probability of being employed\nsteadily increases as a woman's education increases, whereas for casual wage labor and\nfor work in family farms and businesses, women's LFPR decreases with an increase in\neducation. Once they attain moderate levels of education, women do not work in\nmanual labor. The decline in women's LFPR with more education is greatest for\nagricultural and nonagricultural wage work, even more than for work in family\nenterprises. It is especially manual work outside the household that is perceived to be\nbelow one's educational attainment. The preference for salaried jobs as women attain\nmoderate education could reverse the downward part of the U-curve, but such jobs are\nlimited for women.\nThe lack of demand in India, despite economic growth, has been noted by other\nresearchers (Klasen and Pieters 2015). But why economic growth has not generated\nthese jobs remains mostly an unanswered question. One place to look for answers that\nhas not been sufficiently appreciated would be the high levels of occupational\nsegregation. In India, as everywhere, a major employer of moderately educated workers\nis white-collar employment in clerical and sales jobs. But in India, these jobs are still\nsales jobs are held by men (Census 2001). It is not so much the lack of adequate jobs\nfor moderate levels of education but the exclusion of women from these jobs that\nexplains the low rates of labor force participation for these women.\nIn contrast, skilled work in education and health sectors is not nearly so gender\nsegregated, perhaps in part because this type of work conforms better with gender\nstereotypes of women's nurturing roles. But much of this work requires education\nbeyond secondary school, so the weaker sex segregation in these jobs results in a\ngreater demand for educated female labor and the observed rise in labor force\nparticipation among female graduates. Over three-quarters of teachers, for instance,\nhave education above secondary level, and over one-third, 36.8%, are women.\nMuch of the recent work on Indian women's labor force participation has focused\non the important issue of declining rates over recent years. The U-shaped relationship\nbetween education and women's labor participation receives notice in these studies and\nis recognized as one of the causes of the declining rates. Women's increasing levels of\neducation in recent years has put a larger share of women in the lowest portion of the\nU-curve (Andres et al. 2017). But the U-curve itself has received surprisingly little\nChatterjee, Desai & Vanneman: Indian paradox: Rising education, declining women's employment\n874 http://www.demographic-research.org\nresearch attention. The observed difference between illiterate women and women with\nsome secondary education in fact exceeds the over time decline, but has not inspired the\nsame level of research attention. This lack of interest is all the more surprising given its\ndiscrepancy with most labor supply theory. Explanations in the literature often cite\nrestrictive gender norms or the lack of `suitable' work for educated women, but a lack\nof adequate data means that these explanations usually go untested. And the role of\noccupational segregation and the possibility of discrimination and exclusion of women\nfrom white-collar work is almost absent from this literature.\nThe IHDS results do show that an adequate measure of other family income does\nexplain some of the paradoxical decline in women's labor force participation with more\neducation. But the U-curve remains, so we need a renewed focus on explaining why\nthese additional levels of human capital are not brought into the labor market. Much of\nlabor supply theory derives from high-income countries' (especially the United States')\nexperience; the Indian results offer an opportunity to expand that limited background.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 31\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 875\nReferences\nAbraham, V.
