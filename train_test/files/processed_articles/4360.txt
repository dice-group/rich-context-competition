Opponents cited his record of voting \"Present\"\n129 times--an unusual voting pattern permitted in Illinois\nthat allows a legislator to sidestep an issue without having to\nvote Yea or Nay. This type of nonvoting behavior differs\nfrom a simple abstention, in which one does not cast a vote at\nall, though both abstentions and Present votes are forms of\nlegislative nonvoting behavior more generally. Criticisms of\nObama's qualifications to be president were articulated by\nformer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the 2008\nRepublican Convention:\nAnd nearly 130 times, he couldn't make a decision. He couldn't\nfigure out whether to vote \"yes\" or \"no.\" It was too tough. He\nvoted--he voted \"present.\" I didn't know about this vote\n\"present\" when I was mayor of New York City. Sarah Palin\ndidn't have this vote \"present\" when she was mayor or governor.\nYou don't get \"present.\" It doesn't work in an executive job. For\npresident of the United States, it's not good enough to be present.\nThis article examines the use of the Present vote in the\n91st to 93rd Illinois state senate, the three GeneralAssemblies\nin which Obama served as a state senator prior to winning his\nseat in the U.S. Senate. The Illinois state senate is of interest\nnot only because of Obama's prior service in the chamber but\nalso because the mechanisms that drive Present votes in\nIllinois can be isolated in ways that are difficult to do in other\nlegislatures. This allows us to model this behavior in ways\nthat other studies of legislative nonvoting cannot. I focus on\nanswering three questions. First, why do Illinois state sena-\ntors vote Present? Second, is our answer to the first question\nconsistent with the spatial theory of voting? Finally, if\nPresent votes are indeed consistent with the spatial model of\nvoting, do estimates of the ideological positions of the legis-\nlators change when this information is incorporated into our\nmodels?\nMy analysis of roll call data from the Illinois state senate\nsuggests several conclusions. Consistent with much of the\nprior literature on nonvoting behavior in the U.S. Congress,\nI find that Present votes frequently occur in systematic ways.\nIn particular, I find evidence that the majority of Present\nvotes are cast as a strategy by the minority party to protest\nlegislation that will pass irrespective of the preferences of\nminority party members. This answer suggests that there is\ninformation contained in Present votes that is consistent with\nthe spatial model of voting. Incorporation of this information\ninto models that estimate legislative preferences can enhance\nthe efficiency of estimates considerably, but does little to\nchange the rank ordering for most legislators in Illinois,\nincluding Obama. In contrast to the implicit claim made by\nGiuliani above, I find little evidence that by voting Present\non difficult votes, Obama appears more moderate under an\n1University of Mannheim, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: lo@uni-mannheim.de\nVoting Present: Obama and the Illinois\n Keywords\nabstention, roll call voting, ideal point, Obama\n2 SAGE Open\nideal point model than he otherwise would if such votes were\ninstead ignored.1\nWhile my substantive focus is the Illinois state senate, my\nresults provide a framework for examining nonvoting mech-\nanisms more broadly in other settings. I begin by identifying\na set of reasons why legislators choose not to vote. My\nbroader theoretical claim is that by distinguishing between\ndeliberate and idiosyncratic reasons to not vote, the deliber-\nate decision (i.e., voting Present) can be spatially informative\nunder certain circumstances. While I identify one such\nexample in Illinois, the use of Present votes is prominent in\nother legislatures as well. Examples include the Czech,\nEcuadorian, and Brazilian legislatures, each of which had\n(Rosas & Shomer, 2008). Furthermore, there is strong anec-\ndotal evidence that Present votes may sometimes admit a\nspatial interpretation. For example, Voeten (2001) has noted\nthat states in the United Nations Security Council effectively\nvote Present on resolutions they do not approve of, allowing\nlegislation to pass without expressions of explicit support.2\nMy methodological approach to this problem builds pri-\nmarily on the work of Poole and Rosenthal (1997) and Rosas\nand Shomer (2008). Specifically, I aim to explicitly incorpo-\nrate data on Present votes into an ideal point estimator to\ndetermine the validity of Giuliani's claim. Explicit modeling\nof this nature is typically difficult because the prior literature\non nonvoting behavior identifies multiple reasons why legis-\nlators may choose to not vote, and each of these reasons\nadmits a different spatial interpretation (Rosas, Shomer, &\nHaptonstahl, 2010). Pooling nonvoting behavior generated\nby different nonresponse mechanisms naively can therefore\nlead to badly biased ideal point estimates, a key point\nexplored in this article. I address this problem in two ways.\nFirst, note that Present votes are positive acts whereby a leg-\nislator affirms their explicit decision not to vote. By examin-\ning only Present votes rather than pooling all forms of\nnonvoting behavior together, I am able to separate cases\nwhere legislators do not vote for idiosyncratic reasons (i.e.,\nillness) from those where legislators deliberately choose not\nto vote. The use of explicit nonvotes is similar to the strategy\nused in Noury's (2004) study of Present-Not-Voting votes in\nthe European Parliament, but I build on this strategy by\nexplicitly incorporating such votes in an ideal point model.\nSecond, I show that one particular nonresponse mechanism\naccounts for the vast majority of present votes in the Illinois\nstate senate.\nFor legislative scholars more broadly, these findings have\nseveral implications. First, this study explicitly examines\nways that one might incorporate nonvoting explicitly in esti-\nmates of spatial models of voting such as NOMINATE\n(Poole & Rosenthal, 1985) and IDEAL (Clinton, Jackman, &\nRivers, 2004a). I argue that one can do so in cases where pat-\nterns of nonvoting can be explicitly isolated to particular\nmechanisms that admit a spatial interpretation. The Illinois\nstate senate is thus of interest because it presents an unusual\ncase where this is true, and I demonstrate substantial gains in\nthe efficiency of estimates when taking Present votes into\naccount. However, I also demonstrate that this will not gen-\nerally be true, and also provide evidence of attenuation bias\nthat can occur if one naively attempts to do so in cases\nwhether the requirement to isolate particular nonvoting\nmechanisms is not met. Second, I build on a growing litera-\nture that exploits chamber-specific procedures to draw infer-\nences about legislative behavior. For example, Kellerman\n(2012) uses early day motions in the U.K. parliament to esti-\nmate ideal points, while Proksch and Slapin (2012) use leg-\nislative speech to identify intraparty preference divergence.\nMuch like these studies, I argue that chamber-specific proce-\ndures can provide useful information to help estimate com-\nponents of the spatial model--in particular, I find that\nestimates using Present votes are estimated with greater pre-\ncision than those that ignore this data.\nI begin this article with a discussion of the prior literature\nabout strategic nonvoting in legislative settings. While this\nliterature is not directly comparable with the act of voting\nPresent, it is useful in elucidating the key point that in most\ncases there is little spatial information that can be extracted\nfrom an analysis of pooled nonvotes alone, because legisla-\ntors may choose to not vote for a wide variety of reasons. I\nproceed by discussing a simple ideal point model that esti-\nmates legislator preferences while accounting for the spatial\ninformation from Present votes. However, it is important to\nemphasize that this model is specifically tailored to the non-\nresponse mechanism that drives Present voting in Illinois\nand may not be suitable in other contexts. Next, I discuss my\nanalysis of roll call data in the Illinois state senate. I find\nstrong evidence that Present votes are best characterized as\ncoordinated protests against legislation that are organized by\nthe minority party. I conclude with a discussion of the sig-\nnificance of these findings and possible directions for future\nresearch.\nCauses of Strategic Vote Avoidance\nAlthough this article specifically focuses on Present votes,\nthe theoretical literature on Present votes is limited. However,\nthis review of the literature focuses on nonvoting more\nbroadly for two reasons. First, I attempt to identify a set of\ntheoretical reasons why legislators may choose to not to\nvote, either implicitly or explicitly. This provides us with set\nof observable implications that one can apply in testing\npotential causal mechanisms underlying Present votes using\ndata from the Illinois state senate. A second reason to do so is\nto contrast the mechanisms underyling vote avoidance more\ngenerally to those underlying the specific decision to vote\nPresent. This comparison justifies my subsequent argument\nthat while it may be reasonable to treat Present votes as spa-\ntially informative legislative choices in a spatial model of\nvoting, doing so with nonvoting behavior more generally\nmay be somewhat less reasonable.\nWhy do legislators not vote? In addition to obvious idio-\nsyncratic reasons (i.e., illness, other meetings, etc.), I iden-\ntify five reasons cited in the literature as systematic reasons\nwhy legislators may deliberately choose not to vote. These\nreasons include indifference, alienation, competing princi-\npals, timing, and avoidance. In identifying these different\nnonresponse mechanisms, I have two goals. First, I wish to\nidentify the observable implications of each nonresponse\nmechanism to check the Illinois roll call data for the presence\nor absence of the mechanism in question. Second, I wish to\nshow that legislators may have very different reasons for\nabstaining, and these reasons each suggest different spatial\ninterpretations for a missing vote. Finally, I discuss protest as\na sixth potential mechanism that has previously been ignored\nin the literature.\nNonvoting by indifference implies that legislators choose\nnot to vote when the utility they receive between voting for\nthe alternative and the status quo are very close. In practice,\nthis concept has largely been operationalized in the prior lit-\nerature as vote marginality--on lopsided votes where the out-\ncome is certain, the probability of being a decisive vote is\nlow. In such cases, legislators will be indifferent to voting\nbecause their vote is unlikely to affect the final outcome.3\nThis mechanism receives empirical support in Cohen and\nNoll's (1991) analysis of a series of roll call votes on the\nClinch River nuclear reactor. Cohen and Noll found that leg-\nislators voting on Clinch River were more likely to vote when\nthe vote was close and the outcome uncertain. Their finding\nwas subsequently generalized in the work of Poole and\nRosenthal (1997), who examine nonvoting rates systemati-\ncally across all U.S. Congresses and find small vote margins\nto be systematically related to lower rates of nonvoting.4 The\nimpact of vote margin on rates of nonvoting is disputed by\nbut there is general consensus that the use of vote margin as\nan operationalization of indifference is reasonable.5\nRelated to the principle of indifference, alienation sug-\ngests that legislators choose to not vote when the alternative\nand status quo both lie far from their most preferred policy\ning vote marginality as the principal determinant of nonvot-\ning, alienation suggests that legislators at the extremes of the\nideological distribution are most likely to abstain because all\noptions presented to them are highly undesirable. While I am\nunable to find any direct tests of the alienation hypothesis in\nthe literature on ideal point estimation, a related article that\npoints to its plausibility is Carroll, Lewis, Lo, Poole, and\nRosenthal (2013), who find evidence that normal utility\nfunctions in ideal point models fit roll call data better than\nquadratic utility functions in a wide variety of legislative\ncontexts.6 This has important implications for the possibility\nof alienation because as alternatives move far away into the\ntails of the normal distribution, utility differences shrink,\nwhile the same shift under quadratic utility would lead to\ngreater utility differences. Stated differently, quadratic utility\nis inconsistent with alienation because utility differences\nincrease when alternatives are moved far from a legislator's\nideal point.\nUnder the competing principals arguments articulated by\nCarey (2007), legislators must balance concerns from multi-\nple party constituencies that exert control over their political\nfuture. In their analysis of voting behavior in Argentina's\nprovince-centric system, Jones and Hwang (2005) argue that\ncertain bills place legislators in a competing principals\ndilemma across party factions. While the national leadership\nmaintains control of the party agenda, provincial leaders\nexert tremendous influence over the careers and electoral\nprospects of their provincial delegation. This leads to situa-\ntions where legislators are forced to choose between the\nnational party position and the position of the provincial del-\negation--under these circumstances, legislators may choose\nto abstain to ensure that their vote is not counted against the\nparty's majority. Evidence for the competing principals\nhypothesis can be seen in the work of Rosas and Shomer\n(2008), who estimate an ideal point model in which nonvotes\nare recoded as minority votes in Argentina's Federal\nCongress. Using the deviance information criteria (DIC) as\ntheir fit statistic, they find that a model treating nonvotes as\nminority votes achieves a DIC of 0.25 compared with a DIC\nof 0.12 for a model treating nonvoting as ignorable.\nSimilar to the competing principals hypothesis, Jones\n(2003) argues that legislators seek to avoid difficult votes.7\nIn contrast to the competing principals hypothesis where\nissues divide party members internally, Jones focuses on the\nimpact of difficult votes on future electoral success. More\nspecifically, Jones finds that senators in districts with greater\nideological diversity in their constituency are more likely to\navoid taking positions--the implication is that position tak-\ning leads to electoral vulnerability. However, two additional\nfindings cast some doubt on the idea that position taking\nmakes legislators more vulnerable. First, Jones also finds\nthat the senators with the largest margin of victory are in fact\nmuch more likely to avoid taking a position--in fact, those\nwith the largest margin of victory are 83.7% more likely to\navoid votes than those with the lowest margin.8 Second,\nRothenberg and Sanders (1999) find that legislators standing\nfor reelection vote more frequently than those who are retir-\ning. The implication of these contrary findings is that casting\nroll call votes may actually help, rather than hinder those\nseeking reelection.\nPrevious work on nonvoting has also identified the sched-\nuling of votes as a potential factor influencing the propensity\nof legislators to vote. In particular, Rothenberg and Sanders\n(2000) argue that because legislators need to campaign in\ntheir home constituency, the time and date that a vote is\nscheduled can have an effect on the associated cost of voting.\nRothenberg and Sanders found that nonvoting was more fre-\nquent on votes scheduled at the end of a session rather than at\nthe beginning, reflecting the fact that many legislators need to\ncampaign for reelection at the end of the legislative session.\n4 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, votes scheduled in the middle of the week\nhave higher attendance than those scheduled on Monday or\nFriday, reflecting the desire of legislators to spend weekends\nin their home districts. While this pattern is highly robust,\nthere is no obvious spatial interpretation for this behavior as\nmoderates and extremists alike will both abstain together for\nthis reason.\nIn a preview of my results, I discuss a sixth mechanism\nthat does not appear in my review of the literature on nonvot-\ning. The decision not to vote may in fact represent an alterna-\ntive means of protesting legislation. This is similar to the\navoidance mechanism of Jones (2003), in the sense that leg-\nislators torn by competing constituency interests are pro-\ntected from casting controversial votes. It differs from Jones\nin that those who unambiguously oppose a piece of legisla-\ntion may choose to pool with those who are less certain. I\nargue that this mechanism best characterizes the majority of\nPresent votes in the Illinois state senate.9 Furthermore, this\nmechanism appears to occur at least occasionally in other\nlegislatures as well, particularly in legislatures that stipulate\nquorum requirements. One notable example was an attempt\nby Republicans to stall consideration of campaign finance\nlegislation in 1988 by exiting the Senate floor together so\nthat a quorum could not be achieved. In effect, Republican\nsenators abstained from consideration of the legislation in a\ncoordinated effort. The issue came to the national spotlight\nwhen then-Senate majority leader Robert Byrd (D-WV)\noffered and passed a motion ordering the Sergeant-at-Arms\nto arrest and escort absent senators to the floor so that a quo-\nrum could be reached.\nEstimation\nIn this section, I propose a model that allows us to examine\nthe impact of Present votes on legislator ideal points. Ideal\npoint models in political science have contributed much to\nour understanding of legislative voting patterns. Building on\nthe spatial theory of voting (Downs, 1957; Enelow & Hinich,\n1984), these models posit that legislator ideal points can\neach be represented on a unidimensional or multidimen-\nsional space. Each vote is associated with a Yea and Nay\nlocation in the same space. Utilities from a Yea or Nay vote\non each roll call for each legislator can then be calculated\nthrough the use of some utility function and a measure of\ndistance between the legislator's bliss point and the bill\nlocations. Legislators are then assumed to maximize utility\ngiven a random utility model with some random shock\n(McFadden, 1973). Scaling software is concerned with the\nestimation of these legislator and bill locations from roll call\ndata, and popular static implementations of these procedures\ninclude NOMINATE (Poole & Rosenthal, 1985), Heckman-\nSnyder scores (Heckman & Snyder, 1997), and IDEAL\nIt is well known in ideal point literature that the spatial\nmodel of voting with two alternatives and quadratic utility is\nsimply a reparameterization of the traditional two-parameter\nitem-response model that is prominent in the educational\npsychology literature (Clinton et al., 2004a). In this section,\nI extend this finding to show that the same relationship also\nholds true for the spatial model of voting with multiple alter-\nnatives and the polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT)\nto analyze Likert scales.10 This model allows us to model\nPresent votes under limited conditions that are discussed\nlater.\nLet p denote the number of legislators (i = 1, . . . , p) and\nq denote the number of roll call votes (j = 1,. . . , q). Each roll\ncall allows a set of at least r=2 choices, and k denotes the\nchoice (k = 1,. . . , r). In traditional ideal point models, the\nr = 2 choices that are permitted are Yea and Nay votes--this\nmodel, however, allows r to exceed two choices. Drawing on\nthe spatial model of voting, there are three parameters of\ntheoretical interest. The key parameter is each legislator i's\nideal point, denoted as xi . In the same space, each choice k\nfor each roll call j is located at  jk . Furthermore, each choice\ncarries a valence parameter,  jk , which measures the utility\na legislator receives from selecting that choice independent\nof ideological concerns (Londregan, 1999).11 I assume a qua-\ndratic utility function for legislators. Following the random\nutility framework of McFadden (1973), legislator i's utility\non roll call j from outcome k is:\nU u\nijy ijk ijk\n= +  , (1)\nwhere uijk represents the deterministic component of legis-\nlator utility, and ijk represents the stochastic component.\nijk is assumed to follow a Type 1 extreme value distribu-\ntion. The deterministic component of utility is composed of a\nroll call valence utility  jk and a spatial component that\ndeclines as a quadratic function of the distance between the\nlegislator i's ideal point and the location of outcome location\n jk . One can further express the deterministic component of\nutility as follows:\nu x x x\nijk jk i jk i jk jk i\n= - - = - + +\n   \n( ) ,\nwhere   \njk jk jk\nand  \njk jk\nDecomposition of utility into these components simplifies\nthe estimation of the desired parameters. Following Dhrymes\n(1978), this allows us to express the probability that legisla-\ntor i votes for outcome m = k on roll call j as:\nu\nu\nx\nm k ijk\nijk\nijm\nm\nr\nijk jk i\njm\n=\n=\n= = =\n+\n+\n\nexp( )\nexp( )\nexp( )\nexp(\n \n  j\njm i\nm\nr\nx )\n.\n=\n\nThis is identical to the probability of choice under a poly-\ntomous model with different discrimination parameters for\neach choice. The likelihood across all p votes and q legisla-\ntors in roll call matrix V can then be expressed as:\np V X Pijm\nC\nm\nr\nj\nq\ni\np\nijm\n( | , , ) .\n  =\n=\n=\n=\n\n\n\nIn the form written above, the choice equation is unidenti-\nfied. To facilitate model identification, I constrain  jk and\n jk to equal 0 for the first outcome of all bills and orient the\npolarity of the recovered estimates by placing Democrats to\nthe left and Republicans to the right of the scale. Following\nPoole and Rosenthal (1997), I also discard any bills in which\nthe losing side has less than 2.5% of the vote from analysis\nbecause these bills are typically driven by noise rather than\nspatial considerations. Finally, estimation is conducted using\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo by simulating the posterior:\np X V p V X p X\n( , , | ) ( | , , ) ( , , ),\n     \nwhere priors are normally distributed and diffuse for all\nparameters. The derivation presented here therefore shows\nthat the polytomous IRT model can be interpreted as a spatial\nmodel of voting with more than one choice and valence\nconsiderations.\nAt this point, it is helpful to compare this model with one\nthat is similar in spirit to the one presented here. Rosas and\nShomer (2008) also model nonvoting explicitly in an item-\nresponse model, albeit under very different modeling assump-\ntions. Specifically, Rosas and Shomer treat the propensity to\nnot vote as a second dimension, whereas this model treats\npresent votes as informative on the primary left-right dimen-\nsion.12 Both approaches have merit depending on the nonre-\nsponse process that is prevalent, but I provide justification for\nthe reasonableness of the model assumptions in the Illinois\nsenate when examining the data. However, the Rosas and\nShomer assumptions will be reasonable in many legislative\nsettings where these assumptions are not justified.\nI test this model via Monte Carlo simulation. Using the\ndata generating mechanism shown here, I generated a set\nof ideal point and bill parameters for p = 100 legislators,\nq = 500 roll call votes, and r = 4 choices for each roll call. I\nthen use these parameters to generate a roll call matrix and\nattempt to recover the true ideal points using the estimator.\nThe estimated ideal points x\ni\ncorrelate with the true ideal\npoints at r = .998, suggesting that the estimator successfully\nrecovers ideal points generated under this model.\nWhile this test shows correct recovery of the latent trait of\ninterest under simulated conditions, it does not mean that the\nassumptions underlying this model will always be reasonable\nfor modeling nonvoting. In fact, in most cases, this estimator\nwill yield highly biased estimates. Consider the effect of non-\nvoting by indifference on my estimates.13 This theory sug-\ngests that the propensity of legislators to not vote is low when\noutcomes are highly certain, since their chance of being the\npivotal legislator is high. However, when outcomes are cer-\ntain, legislators who are both liberal and conservative are less\nlikely to vote--in other words, there is no spatial interpreta-\ntion for nonvoting by indifference. By imposing a spatial\ninterpretation to nonvoting in a situation where no such inter-\npretation exists, the model will place the location of the non-\nvoting alternative near the middle of the ideological space,\nsince this location will minimize utility differences if legisla-\ntors on both sides of the aisle are choosing it.14 The estimated\npositions of legislators who abstain frequently with others\nwill attenuate to the middle of this distribution. This problem\nbecomes even more severe when nonvoting behavior occur-\nring through other nonresponse mechanisms are pooled\ntogether with those caused by voting indifference.\nIn fact, this is exactly what occurs if one applies this\nmodel to estimate ideal points using roll calls from the 109th\nU.S. House. Figure 1 plots ideal points estimated under two\nassumptions, the standard model where nonvotes are ignored\nand the polytomous IRT model treating nonvotes as a third\nchoice. Not surprisingly, the estimates match up very closely\nfor the vast majority of legislators shown in gray. However,\nestimates recovered for legislators who abstained more than\n100 times are highlighted and are consistent with the\nFigure 1. Ideal point estimates, 109th House: x-axis plots ideal\npoints recovered when treating non-votes as missing, while y-axis\nplots the same ideal points under the assumption that nonvoting\nis spatially informative. Dotted line is a 45\u00b0 line, and dark points\nrepresent estimates for legislators that abstained more than\n100 times. In all cases, the estimated ideal point under the\nassumption that nonvoting is spatially informative is more moderate\nfor frequent abstainers. This suggests that nonvotes occur for\nmultiple reasons, invalidating a simple spatial interpretation for\nthem in this particular application. The circled outlier on the right\nis president George W. Bush, and the circled outlier on the right is\nJohn Lewis (D-GA).\n6 SAGE Open\nexpectations outlined earlier. In all 13 cases, the ideal point\nestimated under the assumption that abstentions can be mod-\neled as separate locations is more moderate than the one\nrecovered under the assumption that nonvotes are ignorable.\nTwo cases in the 109th House that are circled in Figure 1\nhighlight the dangers of pooling multiple causes of nonvot-\ning together. On the right of Figure 1, one can see an outlier\nthat represents the estimate of president George W. Bush's\nideal point, estimated using his administration's expressed\npreferences on legislation from the House.15 Bush's ideal\npoint under the assumption of ignorable nonvoting lies\nslightly to the right of the Republican median, an estimate\nthat is largely in line with other accounts.16 However, because\nBush does not express opinions on most pieces of House leg-\nislation, his nonvoting count is extremely high. This causes\nhis estimated ideal point to attenuate all the way to zero when\nnonvotes are modeled as separate locations. At this location,\nBush lies far to the left of even the most liberal Republican\nCongressman, an estimate that is substantively implausible.\nDistorted estimates of presidential ideal points are not\nsurprising because presidents do not actually vote in the\nHouse. Nevertheless, similar results also appear for regular\nHouse members as well. One such case is John Lewis\n(D-GA), who is the frequent abstainer shown on the far left\nof Figure 1. Under the standard model where nonvoting is\nignored, Lewis's ideal point is estimated to be -1.65, ranking\nhim as the 7th most liberal member of the House. In contrast,\nhis ideal point under the model where nonvoting is informa-\ntive places him at -1.12, ranking him as the 108th most lib-\neral member of the House and slightly to the right of the\nmedian Democrat.17 However, there is substantial evidence\nthat the first estimate is more accurate--Lewis is an outspo-\nken civil rights leader, and cites outspoken Florida liberal\nand New Deal supporter Claude Pepper as the political col-\nleague that he admires most. Furthermore, there appears to\nbe little evidence of electoral pressure to moderate, as Lewis\nhas run unopposed since 2002. Finally, other ideal point esti-\nmates are consistent with the more liberal estimate as well--\nPoole's Optimal Classification technique (2000), which\nestimates legislator locations nonparametrically, places\nLewis as the 11th most liberal member of the U.S. House of\nSummarizing the discussion to this point, my review of\nthe literature identified six mechanisms under which strate-\ngic vote avoidance might occur. In this section, I propose\nusing the polytomous IRT model to study strategic vote\navoidance further, and justify its use by demonstrating that it\ncan be reparameterized as an ideal point model with qua-\ndratic utility and more than two choices. However, I also\nargue that because different mechanisms under which legis-\nlators might strategically abstain imply very different spatial\ninterpretations, treating them as informative in a polytomous\nIRT model is generally not appropriate. In most cases, doing\nso will significantly moderate the ideal point estimates of\nlegislators who abstain frequently--in one instance,\nchanging the rank ordering of a legislator from the 7th to\nState Senate\nIn this section, I examine the uses of Present votes in the\n91st-93rd Illinois State Senate, which covers most of the\nperiod that Obama served as a State Senator. Although\nObama also served in the 90th senate, voting records for this\nperiod were difficult to access and are omitted from this\nstudy.19 All voting data were obtained from the Illinois state\nlegislature website at http://www.ilga.gov. The Illinois State\nSenate is comprised of 59 members, and was controlled by\nRepublicans during the 91st and 92nd Senate before chang-\ning control to the Democrats in the 93rd. There is no superma-\njority required for legislation to pass, and the filibuster does\nnot exist. In addition to standard Yea/Nay votes, the Illinois\nSenate allows members to vote \"Present\" on any legislation.\nPresent votes are distinguished in the record from missing\nvotes, where the senator is not available to vote, so they are\nunusual in that they indicate a deliberate decision not to vote\nYea or Nay. However, Present Votes are not inconsequential\nbecause the Illinois Senate stipulates that all bills require the\nassent of an absolute majority of the chamber (i.e., 30 votes),\nrather than a simple plurality (i.e., more Yea than Nay votes).\nPresent votes therefore have the same legislative effect as a\nNo vote.\nThe decision to study Present votes rather than nonvoting\nmore generally thus immediately addresses two issues raised\nearlier in my review of the literature. As deliberate acts of\nnonvoting, Present votes largely eliminate the set of cases\nwhere nonvoting occurs due to idiosyncratic reasons such as\nillness from consideration.20 Present voting also eliminates\nthe impact of vote scheduling--while Rothenberg and\nSanders (2000) argue that legislators frequently abstain dur-\ning periods when they spend time in their home constituency\ncampaigning, these occasions would not be recorded as\nPresent votes because such votes require the legislator to be\non the Senate floor when the vote is cast.\nTable 1 presents some descriptive statistics about general\nvoting patterns in the Illinois Senate. These descriptive sta-\ntistics illustrate two important characteristics of the data.\nFirst, many more roll calls were introduced in the 93rd\nSenate after the Democratic takeover, a point that is impor-\ntant to emphasize here because it affects the comparability of\nthe graphics that are presented later. The 93rd Senate not\nonly saw more roll calls, but the vast majority of those roll\ncalls were also nonlopsided roll calls in which the losing side\nhad more than 2.5% of the vote. Lopsided roll calls are typi-\ncally uninteresting in the sense that they convey no spatial\ninformation, so the remainder of this analysis focuses solely\non nonlopsided roll calls. Second, Present votes appear with\nsome frequency in the data. Approximately 40% of all non-\nlopsided roll calls have at least one person voting Present,\nand 3.2% to 6.3% of all votes were Present votes. The key\npoint here is that Present votes occur in sufficient frequency\nthat they could, under certain situations, affect ideal point\npoint estimates in a substantively significant manner.\nSince Present votes have the same legislative effect as a\nNo vote, the competing principals hypothesis suggests that\nsenators might vote Present to kill legislation without having\nto cast a No vote directly (Forgette & Sala, 1999). Table 2\nexamines the evidence for competing principals by tabulat-\ning failed and successful roll call votes, and four key points\nemerge from this analysis. First, the vast majority of roll calls\npass, consistent with expectations of strong party discipline\n(Cox & McCubbins, 2005). Second, I find little evidence in\nsupport of the hypothesis that Present votes are used to kill\nlegislation. In examining the legislative impact of voting\nPresent, I define a \"Pivotal Present Vote\" as a bill that fails to\npass, but which would have passed if all senators voting\nPresent had switched their vote to Yea. Pivotal Present votes\nthus define the set of roll calls where Present votes poten-\ntially \"matter\" in defeating a piece of legislation. Only 18\nroll calls were Pivotal Present votes, which suggest that vot-\ning Present was generally an ineffective tactic at killing leg-\nislation. Third, I tabulate the total number of Present votes by\nObama on nonlopsided legislation, which total 55 Present\nvotes across all three Senates. Note that this figure is differ-\nent from the 129 total Present votes attributed to Obama, as\n74 of those Present votes occurred either in the 90th Senate\nor on legislation passing by lopsided margins.21 Finally,\nTable 2 also shows how Obama's frequency of voting Present\nranked in the legislature. During the two Republican-\ncontrolled senates, Obama's frequency of voting Present\nranked him in the upper tertile, while his frequency dropped\nto the median during the Democrat-controlled 93rd senate.\nTable 3 continues this analysis by examining the 18\nPivotal Present votes in greater detail. With the potential\n(Consumer Protection Agency Act), none of the pivotal votes\ncould be described as major pieces of legislation.22 Present\nvotes therefore rarely appear to be decisive on major legisla-\ntion. Of the 18 pivotal outcomes, Obama voted Present on\nfive of those occasions, yet even on these five occasions the\nlegislative impact of his Present votes appears to be minimal.\nObama's Present votes in the 92nd state senate occurred\non two pieces of legislation where large numbers of senators\nstate senate, Obama voted Present on Election Code and\nPension Code reform bills that narrowly failed, but the mean-\ning of his votes here are unclear because they were votes\nagainst concurring with a House Amendment to a bill (typi-\ncally a conference report), rather than a vote against the bill\nat third reading. The change to the Riverboat Gambling Act\nappears to be the sole example of a piece of legislation where\nObama's Present vote clearly mattered, yet this appears to\nhave been a fairly minor piece of legislation.\nA second version of the competing principals hypothesis\nsuggests that senators might vote Present as an indirect way\nto oppose their party. If this is true, senators are likely to vote\nPresent on party line roll calls that are supported by their\nparty. I define a party line roll call as one where a majority of\nDemocrats vote differently from a majority of Republicans,\nwith Present votes excluded from the counts. Table 4 sum-\nmarizes Obama's voting patterns on party line votes, show-\ning large differences in voting behavior between senates.\nParty line voting surged in Obama's final term, jumping from\n34 party line votes in the Republican-controlled 91st and\n92nd Senate to 535 party line votes in the Democrat-\ncontrolled 93rd Senate. This increase was partly driven by\nthe increase in total legislation in the 93rd, but even account-\ning for the volume of legislation the 93rd Senate was much\nmore divided along partisan lines--38% of all roll calls in\nthe 93rd Senate were party line votes, compared with only\n8% before that. Across all three legislatures, Obama largely\nvoted along party lines, siding with Democrats 92% of the\ntime. Notably, although there were no instances where\nObama voted Present on party line roll calls supported by\nDemocrats in either the 91st or 92nd Senate, this occurred 16\nTable 1.

Lopsided roll calls include all roll calls where the losing side has\nless than 2.5% of the vote. Yea/Nay/Present votes only calculated from\nnonlopsided roll calls.

Party line votes are defined as roll calls where a majority of\ndemocrats vote differently from a majority of republicans, with Present\nvotes excluded in the counts.\ntimes in the 93rd Senate. There is therefore some evidence\nthat Obama used Present votes to indirectly oppose his party\nwhile the Democrats controlled the Senate.\nNonvoting by indifference suggests that voting is most\nlikely to occur when the probability of affecting the final out-\ncome is high. If this is true, then Present votes likely to occur\nwhen the Yea and Nay sides are closely matched on a vote.\nFigure 2 examines the evidence for this claim by plotting the\nYea\u00adNay margin on each roll call against the number of\nPresent votes on each roll call, with Obama's Present votes\nhighlighted as darker points. While there are few votes that\nare close (i.e., have a Yea\u00adNay margin near 0), there is no\nevidence in any Congress that close votes are more likely to\nhave large numbers of senators voting Present. Instead,\nPresent votes occur most frequently when the Yea\u00adNay mar-\ngin is around 35 votes. This trend is consistent with Obama's\npattern of voting Present in the 91st and 92nd Senate--\nObama largely votes Present only when a large number of\nother senators are voting likewise. However, Obama's pro-\npensity to vote Present in the 93rd Senate seems largely\nrandom.\nAlthough the previous graphic suggests that senators who\nvote Present frequently do so together, it provides little infor-\nmation about who votes Present together. To examine this\nissue, I first estimate ideal points for each Senate under the\ntraditional assumption that Present votes are missing data.\nTable 3.

Pivotal Present votes are roll calls that failed to pass, but would have passed if members voting present had instead voted Yea. 29 Yea votes are\nrequired to pass legislation.\nFigure 3 plots histograms of Present vote frequency by ideal\npoint estimate. The histograms suggest that Present votes\nwere largely used by the minority party--Democrats were\nparticularly likely to use them in the 91st and 92nd Senate,\nwhile Republicans were likely to use them in the 93rd. Figure 3\nalso examines the evidence for the nonvoting by alienation\nmechanism. If alienation accounts for a significant portion of\nPresent votes, one would expect to see large numbers of\nPresent votes at the two extremes of the ideal point distribu-\ntion. However, this does not appear to be the case. Finally,\nFigure 3 provides justification for the modeling assumption\nthat Present votes are partially informative on the left-right\ndimension, since the majority of Present votes occurs along\npartisan lines.\nI also examine the evidence for Jones' (2003) hypothesis\nthat legislators seek to avoid position taking because votes\nare regularly cited against them in campaigns. This finding\nwas disputed by Rothenberg and Sanders (1999), who instead\nargue that voting aids electoral success. I find little evidence\nthat position avoidance helps reelection, as the 11 Republican\nsenators who lost their seat between the 92nd and 93rd\nPresent votes for the entire Republican caucus. Electoral vul-\nnerability therefore does not appear to explain the frequency\nAfter rejecting alienation, indifference, electoral vulnera-\nbility, vote timing, and competing principals as explanations\nof Present votes, one is left with the conclusion that such\nvotes are best interpreted as minority votes against legisla-\ntion. Under such a mechanism, Present votes are spatially\ninformative and can therefore be incorporated into models of\nideal point estimation. Ideal point models traditionally treat\nPresent votes as missing data. However, Present votes occur\nwith moderate frequency and in a nonrandom manner. I\ntherefore estimate ideal point models that incorporate Present\nvotes in two ways. First, I estimate a model that treats Present\nvotes as a third choice on each vote. I also estimate another\nmodel where Present votes are treated as No votes, a model\nmotivated by the fact that Present and No votes have the\nsame legislative effect. Ideal points estimated under these\nassumptions are then plotted against ideal points estimated\nunder the traditional assumption of Present votes as missing\nFigure 2. Frequency of Present votes by vote margin, 91-93 Illinois Senate: Vote margin on x-axis is defined as Yea minus Nay votes.\nNote. Darker points indicate the votes on which Obama voted Present.\nFigure 3. Frequency of Present votes by ideal point, 91st-93rd Illinois Senate.\nNote. Y-axes are not on the same scale because many more votes occurred in the 93rd Senate.\nFigure 4. Ideal point estimates under different assumptions, 91st-93rd Illinois Senate.\nNote. From left to right, top panels show ideal point estimates comparing standard ideal point estimates to those derived from treating Present votes as\nNo votes, while lower panels compare standard ideal point estimates to those derived from treating Present votes as a separate choice. Standard ideal\npoint estimates are derived by discarding all Present votes. Bands represent 80% confidence intervals.\nTable 5.

Standard errors in parentheses.\ndata in Figure 4. Obama's specific ideal point estimates\nunder different assumptions are presented in Table 5. The\nrelationships are strongly linear, showing little variability in\nthe recovered ideal point estimates regardless of the model\nestimated.\nNotably, Obama was criticized during the campaign for\nvoting Present to appear moderate, yet there is little evidence\nof moderation in his ideal point estimates under either model\nof informative nonvoting presented in Table 5. The largest\nshift that is observed occurs in the 92nd state senate, where\nObama is ranked as the 7th most liberal Illinois senator under\nthe traditional model and the 10th most liberal when Present\nvotes are considered as a separate choice. Note that a large\nshift in rank order is entirely possible--under the nonvoting-\nas-location model, John Lewis's (D-GA) estimated ideal\npoint changed his ranking from the 7th most liberal member\nof the House of Representatives to the 108th. No shift of any\ncomparable magnitude occurs here. However, there is some\nevidence that suggests Obama may have become more mod-\nerate in the 93rd state senate, as his ideal point and ranking\nboth moderate considerably. However, the evidence is still\ninconclusive because estimates across legislatures are not\ncomparably--inparticular,becausethe93rdhasaDemocratic\nmajority there are significantly more Democratic senator.24\nFurthermore, there is some possibility of vote selection\neffects that may arise as candidates campaign for higher\noffice (Clinton, Jackman, & Rivers, 2004b).\nWhile rank orderings largely remain unchanged when\nPresent votes are incorporated into the model, the model\nobtains significant improvements in the efficiency of the\nestimates. Taking the 91st Senate as an example, Democrats\nhad a mean standard error of 0.19 in the traditional model\nwhere Present votes are omitted. However, this drops to 0.13\nin the model where Presents are counted as No votes, and\n0.12 in the case where Presents are counted as a third loca-\ntion. However, the increase in efficiency is marginal for\nRepublicans, who have a mean standard error of 0.16 under\nthe traditional model, but mean standard errors of 0.14 and\n0.15, respectively, under the models where Present votes are\ntreated as no or separate votes, respectively. An obvious\nhypothesis explaining this discrepancy is the large number of\nPresent votes cast by the minority party--this hypothesis\nreceives strong support from the fact that the pattern is\nreversed in the 93rd Senate under a Democratic majority\nwhen Republican legislators vote Present much more\nfrequently.\nSummarizing the results presented here, the practice of\nvoting Present largely appears to be a tactic employed by the\nminority party. When Present voting occurs, it is rarely deci-\nsive in the sense that the outcome of the vote would have\nchanged regardless of how those who voted Present would\notherwise have voted. In the few cases where Present votes\nare potentially decisive, the affected legislation is generally\nminor. Present votes also do not appear to occur for particu-\nlarly controversial legislation where the Yea minus Nay mar-\ngin is small--in fact, they are most likely to occur when the\nmargin is about 30 votes.\nObama's usage of Present votes was largely consistent\nwith these patterns--his use of Present votes was in the\nupper tertile of legislators, but was not particularly unusual.\nThe majority of Obama's Present votes occurred on roll calls\nwhere large numbers of Democrats voted Present with him,\nparticularly in the 91st and 92nd state senate. There is little\nevidence that Obama was more likely to vote Present when\nPresent votes were potentially decisive, and little evidence\nthat Obama was more likely to vote Present when votes were\ncontroversial. Some evidence suggests that Obama used\nPresent votes to oppose his party on party line votes during\nthe 93rd senate, but these votes were rarely decisive and had\nlittle impact on estimates of his ideal point. Notably, the\nincorporation of information from Present votes does not\nmake Obama's estimated ideal point more moderate. Obama\nconsistently appears as the 5th or 6th most liberal member of\nthe Illinois state senate in the 91st General Assembly, but he\nbecomes the 23rd or 24th most liberal senator by the 93rd as\nhe begins his campaign for the U.S. Senate.\nConclusion\nIn this article, I examine the use of Present votes in the\nIllinois state senate. I find that Present votes are best charac-\nterized as coordinated protest votes by minority party mem-\nbers against the majority. Since these votes produce cutlines\nthat are consistent with the spatial model of voting, their\ninclusion into ideal point models is justifiable. These condi-\ntions are not true of nonvoting in legislatures such as the\n109th House, which occurs for a wide variety of reasons with\ndifferent spatial interpretations. Under these circumstances,\nthe ideal point estimates of legislators who do not vote will\nfrequently be greatly attenuated. These results thus suggest\nthat because nonvoting more generally may occur for a vari-\nety of reasons, naive inclusion of nonvoting into vote choice\nmodels may lead to biased results. However, in contrast to\nthe 109th House I find no significant attenuation of ideal\npoint estimates when accounting for Present votes, and the\nefficiency of estimates improves by approximately 35% after\ninformation from Present votes is incorporated into the\nmodel. Furthermore, I find little evidence of significant mod-\neration by Obama when Present votes are accounted for,\nthough there is some evidence that Obama's voting record\nmoderated significantly before his subsequent election to the\nU.S. Senate.\nIn examining directions for future research, it is important\nto first compare and contrast this contribution to that of ear-\nlier work on this subject. Early work on nonvoting (Cohen &\n1999) examined rates of nonvoting, identifying multiple rea-\nsons why legislators might strategically avoid votes.\nHowever, these studies are limited by the fact that different\nnonresponse mechanisms each imply different spatial inter-\npretations. In the context of this article, a central contribution\nof this earlier literature is to emphasize what should not be\ndone--namely, pooling multiple sources of nonvoting into\nan ideal point model naively in models similar to what was\nthat one solution to this problem is to examine only cases\nwhere legislators avoid taking positions, thereby eliminating\nidiosyncratic reasons for nonvoting from consideration. This\napproach facilitates a richer analysis of vote avoidance than\nis otherwise possible, but still does not completely address\nthe pooling problem identified earlier in situations where one\nwishes to incorporate such information into an ideal point\nmodel.\nMy approach to the study of Present votes instead is simi-\nlar to the working paper by Rosas et al. (2010), who attempt\nto determine the conditions under which nonvoting is ignor-\nable in roll call data analysis. Rosas et al. propose three vari-\nants of the IRT model designed to incorporate information\nfrom nonvotes under the mechanisms of indifference, alien-\nation, and competing principals, and they demonstrate that\nlegislator ideal points can be recovered with greater accuracy\nunder two of the three models via Monte Carlo simulation. A\ncentral theme of their paper is that vote avoidance can often\nusefully be incorporated into ideal point models if the nonre-\nsponse mechanism can be isolated and modeled.\nSimilar to Rosas et al. (2010), I begin by identifying a\nnonresponse mechanism and developing an ideal point\nmodel to capture the dynamics of nonresponse. However, I\nbuild upon this model in significant ways, first by showing\nthe relationship between the polytomous IRT model and a\nmultiple choice spatial model of voting, and also in showing\nthe attenuation bias that can occur when nonresponses result-\ning from different processes pool together. I then identify the\nIllinois legislature as a case where a single nonresponse\nmechanism appears to be particularly dominant in explaining\ndeliberate acts of nonvoting. This situation is especially\nintriguing in light of its relevance to the 2008 U.S. presiden-\ntial campaign. In contrast to claims that suggest otherwise, I\nfind little evidence that Present votes moderate estimates of\nObama's estimated ideal point in any way, but incorporation\nof such votes improves the efficiency of estimates\nconsiderably.\nMoving forward, substantive applications of nonvoting\nmodels to real legislatures is clearly an important and worth-\nwhile endeavor, especially in light of Rosas et al.'s (2010)\nclaim that such mechanisms are not ignorable. Such applica-\ntions are difficult to address in light of the pooling problems\ndiscussed earlier. This research suggests that one way to\napproach this problem is through cleaner identification,\nwhereby nonvoting behavior driven largely by a single non-\nresponse mechanism can be isolated. This can be done not\nonly through careful selection of the legislature to be ana-\nlyzed but can also potentially be accomplished by subsetting\nparticular votes or legislators. Careful selection of cases can\ntherefore permit theoretical expectations of nonresponse to\nbecome more closely aligned with what is observed.\n"
