Background\nEach state of the United States has unique characteristics relevant to the determination of a drinking\nculture and corresponding alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol-related problems. Factors that\nmay underlie or influence drinking culture include a state's demographic make-up in terms of age,\ngender and race/ethnicity groups, the distribution of socio-economic characteristics such as\neducational attainment, income and wealth, a state's mix of religions with differing perspectives on\nalcohol use, degree of urbanicity, state alcohol policies and regulatory regimes, the structure of the\nalcoholic beverage market in terms of wholesale and retail distribution networks, historical and\ncultural practices related to drinking (or not drinking) various alcoholic beverages, the size and\nimportance of alcoholic beverage production industries both historically and currently, exposure to\nadvertising for alcohol products and potentially other factors. Yet, clearly some of these aspects of\ndrinking culture are shared across states, particularly those in geographic proximity to one another, and\nother aspects may be shared across states with similar populations throughout the country. Therefore,\none would expect that drinking cultures and markets would not be defined by state borders in most\ncases. Media markets too may help create cultural sub-groups that cover multiple states or even\nmarket-related areas potentially spread across many parts of the country. Relative proportions of the\nvarious demographic and market-demarcated sub-groups, along with geographic proximity, should\ndefine the degree of shared drinking cultures between states. Thus, states may share similarities in\nterms of certain beverage types or drinking patterns but may be divergent on other beverages or trends.\nIt is also relevant regarding drinking culture, to consider commonalities reflected in trends over time.\nPast research has generally focused on characterizing Wet and Dry regions of the US. In these\nstudies and the current analysis \"wetness\" is determined by consumption patterns with Wet areas\nhaving a relatively high per capita consumption and percentage of heavy drinkers and a relatively low\nabstention rate. Alternative definitions of \"wetness\" in terms of alcohol policy and alcohol availability\ncould also be applied and future studies should address how these are related to the drinking outcome-\nbased definition of wetness. Early work utilizing data from the first National Alcohol Survey (NAS)\nconducted in 1964 using nine Census-defined regions found the Northeast, North Central and Pacific\nregions to be Wet and the South, Mountain and West North Central states to be Dry [1]. Further\nanalyses looking at the same nine census-defined regions in NAS surveys from 1979 and 1984 showed\nthe drier regions had become wetter since the 1960s but that Dry/Wet differences in both drinking\npatterns and attitudes remained [1,2]. In these analyses the West North Central region was reclassified\nfrom Dry to Wet and the West South Central and Mountain regions remained Dry in terms of\nabstention rates but looked more like Wet regions in terms of heavy drinking and per capita\nconsumption.\nSurvey measures of consumption volume have been found to be highly correlated with per capita\napparent consumption [3] and survey estimates of drinking by college students have been found to be\nlinked to drinking patterns in the general population [4]. Some have suggested that the Southern states\nappear to be dry by having higher abstention rates but actually have heavier drinking among those who\ndrink; however, an analysis of survey data across states did not find differences between the South and\nother states in terms of heavy drinking among drinkers [5]. This may be because the marginal drinkers\nwho choose to abstain in a Dry environment would have been very light drinkers in a Wet\nenvironment, making per drinker average consumption a poor measure for comparison due to the\ntypically skewed consumption distribution [6]. Religion has been found to be an important predictor of\ncurrent drinking and heavy drinking across US states with high religious adherence for Catholics being\nassociated with higher rates of drinking and heavy drinking, and higher adherence among Evangelical\nProtestants associated with lower rates [7].\nSurvey-based models of the determinants and consequences of alcohol use typically utilize regional\ncontrol variables to capture unmeasured aspects of drinking culture [8]. Most US regional control\nvariables in multivariate models utilize either the nine or four census regions. Such analyses are\nmotivated by the notion that some variance is explained by characteristics associated with simple\ngeography. Having a set of such geographic variables based on empirical measures characterizing\nstates' drinking cultures should improve their usefulness. Analyses retaining indicators for all 50 states\nare often not informative or feasible. Aggregate-level cross-section time-series models must pool\nstates' series in many cases, for example when estimating the effects of government policies on\nalcohol use or the effects of alcohol consumption on mortality rates or in modeling other outcomes.\nKnowing which states are similar to each other in terms of drinking culture, broadly defined, could\nimprove the selection of control states in models of interrupted time series aimed at detecting results of\na policy change, for instance. In either survey or aggregate analyses it would be preferable to utilize\ngroups of states that have been shown to have similar and linked drinking markets and/or cultures than\nto employ arbitrarily composed contiguous geographic regions. An improved grouping scheme should\nresult in better precision of regional indicator variables for survey analyses and ideally yield more\nhomogeneous pooled state groupings for time-series analyses.\nNo studies have specifically tried to group states empirically based on drinking pattern and alcohol\nsales data. Much more state-specific data is now available to fine tune these characterizations and to\nbegin to empirically define state groupings in terms of shared drinking culture. Measures\ncharacterizing drinking culture in this study focus on the percentage of the population drinking five or\nmore (5+) drinks in a day in the past month, drinking at all in the past month and per capita apparent\nalcohol consumption. This paper aims to categorize the US states into regional groups based on the\nwetness of recent drinking patterns and to evaluate whether these groupings represent linked drinking\ncultures over time through pair-wise analyses of trends in per capita apparent consumption of beer and\nspirits within and outside of these regional groupings.\n2. Methods\nSurvey estimates for each state are taken from synthetic state-level estimates for the 2005-2006\ncombined samples from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) of past month 5+\ndrinks in a day and past month drinking among those aged 12 and older and other age sub-groups.\nThese published estimates were used because to prevent identification, the public use files for this\nsurvey do not include geographic identifiers [9]. The NSDUH survey is a face-to-face multi-stage\nclustered probability sample of the US population with special attention to drug use related issues.\nAlternative estimates of 5+ for men and 4+ for women drinks in a day in the past month from the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2007 are shown in Table 1 below for\ncomparison. The BRFSS survey utilizes state representative sampling; each state oversees the conduct\nof an identical, large telephone survey on health risk behaviors [10].\nare estimates from the Alcohol Research Group (ARG) state alcohol per capita ethanol database. Tax\nand sales based estimates of per capita apparent consumption of beer, wine, spirits and total ethanol for\n1950 to 2005 are calculated using %ABV conversions developed by ARG and population estimates are\nState groupings were created based on geographic proximity and primarily on the estimate, from the\nday on any day in the past month, as well as from the 2005 per capita apparent consumption of\nalcohol. Also considered were the past month 5+/4+ binge measure taken form the 2007 BRFSS\nsurvey and the past year abstention rate in the 2005-2006 NSDUH surveys. The NSDUH estimates are\nseen as more reliable than the BRFSS estimates due to higher response rates and especially higher\nreported volumes of drinking, implying better coverage of alcohol sales [14]. Per capita apparent\nconsumption figures are generally seen as the most reliable estimates of overall drinking, not being\nsubject to non-response and self-report biases. However, an exception to this rule is states with large\ncross-border and/or tourist sales relative to their populations, particularly, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii,\nDistrict of Columbia, New Hampshire and Delaware. Correlations between reporting 5+ drinks in a\nconsumption and 5+/4+ drinks in a day monthly based on the 2007 BRFSS were also calculated to\ndetermine the degree to which these measures indicated similar rankings of states. The percentage of\npast month drinkers reporting having 5+ drinks in any day in the past month in the 2005-6 NSDUH\nwas also calculated to illustrate the prevalence of heavy drinking among drinkers. Based primarily on\ninspecting the proportion of heavy drinkers and per capita apparent consumption of alcohol, but also\nconsidering the other measures, states were generally characterized as Wet, Moderate or Dry. States\nwithin these categories were then grouped according to geographic proximity with some exceptions\nmade in order keep the number of groups relatively small and to include nearly all states in some\ngroup. For example, Utah was grouped with the other Dry states that form a geographically contiguous\ngroup in the South and the Moderate states in the South were grouped together although they do not all\nshare borders.\nFollowing the grouping, based on cross-sectional results, data on trends in per capita apparent\nconsumption by beverage type were examined to give an indication of whether alcohol consumption\ntrends within the state groupings appear to move together and to have similar levels and general trends.\nTo establish whether relationships between states within a resultant regional grouping where stronger\nand more common than those with states outside of the groupings, Granger Causality tests [15] were\nestimated using Stata [16] between each pair of states for beer and spirits series. Wine was not\nanalyzed because summarizing test results was very labor intensive and wine is a relatively less\nimportant beverage in the US. Granger Causality tests use lagged values of one series (e.g., per capita\nbeer consumption in Ohio) to predict the current value of another series (e.g., per capita beer\nconsumption in Iowa). These tests incorporated two lagged values and a 0.05 significance level was\nused for rejecting the null hypothesis of no relationship. The proportion of significant relationships (in\neither or both directions) between states within a group was then compared to the proportion with\nstates outside of the group to determine the relative degree to which beverage series trends were more\nclosely related within regional groups.\n3. Results\nSix state groups were identified by consideration of the variables mentioned in Methods, as shown\nin Figure 1. With group titles that approximate the bulk of the included states, these groups are:\nWet\nNorth Central- Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,\nMissouri, Ohio, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming\nNew England- Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont\nModerate\nMiddle Atlantic- Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania\nPacific- California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington\nSouth Coast- Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas\nDry\nDry South- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,\nOklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia\nThe District of Columbia was not grouped due to unique characteristics but if a complete grouping\nis necessary for analytic purposes it would be included in the Middle Atlantic group. The District of\nColumbia is situated between Maryland in the Middle Atlantic and Virginia in the Dry South but has\nmuch higher alcohol consumption than both and differs in many ways, reflecting its unique features.\nOther states were also difficult to clearly classify. Nevada has increased in the number residents\nrelative to visitors recently and now fits better into the Pacific region while Utah's drinking pattern fits\nthe Dry South although its drinking culture may not be closely linked to the other member states due to\ngeographic and cultural separation. New Hampshire is another special case where out-of-state buyers\ninflate per capita apparent consumption estimates but residents' drinking in surveys clearly fits with\nthe New England group. Alaska also has a relatively high tourist/visitor impact and being\ngeographically separated from the contiguous mainland states it is difficult to place its drinking culture\nin this environment. Figure 1 provides a visual presentation of these groups. Following this, Table 1\nlists the percentage of the population drinking 5+ drinks in a day in the 2005-6 NSDUH for the age 12\nand older group (used in the state grouping decision) and for sub-groups by age of 18 to 25 and 26 and\nolder. Also included are the past month percentage of drinkers and the percentage reporting 5+ days\namong past month drinkers in the 2005-6 NSDUH, per capita apparent consumption for 2005 and the\npercentage of the population 18 and older reporting past month 5+/4+ days in the 2007 BRFSS survey.\nThe states are listed in descending order by the past month 5+ percentages for those 12 and older in the\n2005-6 NSDUH. Considering the regional groupings using the group name variable in terms of the\nordering by 5+ percentages shows the groups to make sense in terms of this ordering. The US average\nis included for reference and all but one (Alaska) of the North Central states and all but one (Maine) of\nthe New England states are seen to be above this average. These are the two groups of states\nrepresented as Wet. The Dry South states, seen as the Dry group, are all found below the US average.\nThe three middle groups, Pacific, Middle Atlantic and South Coast are more distributed both above\nand below and are generally categorized as Moderate in terms of wetness.\nFigure 1. Map of US Regional Drinking Groups. North Central, blue; New England,\nyellow; Middle Atlantic, orange; Pacific, red; South Coast, dark grey; Dry South, light\ngray. Groups are also identified as Wet, Moderate or Dry based on the % reporting 5+\ndrinking day in the past month and per capita apparent consumption of alcohol.\nTable 1.

Cont.\nDrinking Groups: PA- Pacific, NC- North Central, SC- South Coast, NE- New England, MA- Middle Atlantic,\nDS- Dry South.\nComparing the NSDUH estimates to those from the BRFSS and to per capita apparent consumption\nillustrates a general but far from complete agreement (see Table 1). It is clear that the BRFSS estimates\nare much lower than the NSDUH despite using a four drink threshold for heavy drinking among\nwomen and having an age 18 and older, rather than 12 and older, sampling frame. At face, both of\nthese differences would be expected to lead to higher numbers in the BRFSS rather than lower.\nClearly, some combination of differences in the sampling strategy, response rate, mode of interview,\nincentive payment and survey content led to less under-reporting in the NSDUH and may also imply\nmore stable estimates across states due to lower measurement error. Several of these potential sources\nof bias were examined in a comparison of the 1999 and 2001 versions of each of these surveys but\nnone of the factors examined appeared to explain these differences [17]. The per capita apparent\nconsumption estimates are assessments of a state's average consumption volume rather than the\nnumber of heavy drinkers and present an alternative metric for state comparisons. Because this was an\nimportant variable considered in group assignment decisions, making allowance for the states where\nthis measure is biased by out-of-state drinkers, per capita consumption generally fits the state\ngroupings. However, some states like Ohio, Kansas and Iowa in the North Central group appear lower\non this measure indicating perhaps less moderate drinking along with a culture of heavy drinking.\nSimilarly, some of the states ranking lower in 5+ percentage appear higher in per capita consumption,\nparticularly those not in the Dry South group such as South Carolina, Oregon and New Mexico.\nCorrelations between the survey measures considered in the state group classifications were high\nand a 0.82 correlation between the monthly 5+ and monthly drinking measures in the 2005-6 NSDUH.\nA lower 0.44 correlation between the NSDUH 5+ measure and per capita apparent consumption in\n2005 indicates some disparity between these two key measures. However, when states with cross\nborder and tourism issues are removed the correlation increases to 0.62, indicating somewhat better\nagreement between these measures. Table 1 also illustrates that while there is a general\ncorrespondence between the 18-25 age group and the older group in terms of 5+ drinkers, some states\nstand out particularly in the 18-25 group. The New England states are especially high in this group\nand are known for having relatively large numbers of college students and the associated heavy\nepisodic college drinking cultures. Some Middle Atlantic states, such as New Jersey, Delaware and\nPennsylvania, similarly have relatively high percentages of past month 5+ drinkers in the 18-25 group.\nThe percentage of past month drinkers who report having had 5+ drinks in a day gives an indication of\nthe distribution of heavy and moderate drinking among drinkers for each state. These percentages\nrange from a low of 38% in Maryland to a high of 54% in Utah, both states with relatively low levels\nof 5+ drinkers. While there is no consistent pattern for this variable, higher percentages appear more\ncommon among states with the highest and lowest percentages of 5+ drinkers in their populations\nwhile lower percentages more commonly occur in the Moderate states.\nFigures 2, 3 and 4 illustrate trends in per capita beer, spirits and wine sales for each of the six state\ngroupings. Although national trends lead to similarities between the groups and some persistent outlier\nstates are seen, the six groupings are generally confirmed in terms of similarity in levels and trends.\nThe Dry South states appear to be especially linked and different from the rest of the US.\nFigure 2. Apparent consumption of beer in liters of ethanol per capita aged 15+ by state in\nNorth Central WET New England\nSouth Coast MODERATE Pacific\nMiddle Atlantic (MODERATE) Dry South (DRY)\nFigure 3. Apparent consumption of spirits in liters of ethanol per capita aged 15+ by state\nNorth Central WET New England\nSouth Coast MODERATE Pacific\nMiddle Atlantic (MODERATE) Dry South (DRY)\nFigure 4. Apparent consumption of wine in liters of ethanol per capita aged 15+ by state\nNorth Central WET New England\nSouth Coast MODERATE Pacific\nMiddle Atlantic (MODERATE) Dry South (DRY)\nIn some cases, contrasting trends are evident such as the increasing beer consumption in the South\nCoast and Dry South states compared to the decreasing consumption in the Middle Atlantic states. For\nspirits, the shapes of most states trends are similar but the levels of consumption and the degree of the\nrising and falling pattern differ.\nFigures summarizing the results of Granger Causality test comparisons of relationships between\nspirits and beer series within and outside of regional state groupings are presented in Table 2. The\npercentage of states within a grouping that have significant predictive relationships with each other is\ncompared to the percentage of these relationships with states outside the grouping. These results do not\nconsistently support the hypothesis that regional groupings will have more closely related\nbeverage-specific trends in per capita apparent consumption. Some state groups were found to have a\nhigher proportion of related state trends than outside relationships; spirits for Pacific and South Coast\nand beer for Dry South, North Central and New England. However, in all other cases the opposite was\nfound or the proportion of relationships was the same. High percentages of relationships were found\noverall indicating that national trends are generally more important for US states than regional trends.\nTable 2.

Discussion\nSix groups of states were created by a qualitative inspection of several considerations: geographic\nproximity, recent (2005-7) survey measures of drinking patterns and per capita apparent consumption\nof alcohol in each jurisdiction. The degree to which these state drinking groups appear to be linked\nwas assessed through time trends in per capita apparent consumption of beer, wine, spirits over the\n1950 to 2002 period. Shared drinking measure trajectories are seen both within and across the defined\ngroups suggesting some cohesiveness in regional drinking cultures as well as shared national trends.\nHowever, the results of Granger Causality tests designed to indicate predictive relationships between\nstates did not find consistent evidence that state trends within these groups were more closely linked\nthan trends between states in different groups for the beer and spirits beverage types. National trends in\nUS alcohol consumption including rising consumption in the 1960's and early 1970's and declining\nin many of the states [13]. These changes, while not entirely understood, have been attributed to birth\ncohort differences in beverage preference and life-course drinking patterns [8,18] and to changes in\nalcohol policy such as the lowering and later raising of the minimum drinking age [19] and changes in\npolicies and attitudes toward drunk driving in the 1980's [20,21]. The national trends appear to\ndominate the state-grouping-specific trends. Despite the lack of clear validation for the grouping in\nterms of linked drinking patterns over time within the six groups, the groups are differentiated\ncross-sectionally and represent an empirically-based identification of US state regions varying in\nwetness versus dryness, suitable for use in the analyses of alcohol-consumption and related behaviors\nand outcomes. The simplified three group distinction between Wet, Moderate and Dry states represents\na nested alternative grouping focused on drinking patterns and mean consumption levels.\nFuture studies at the individual-level should utilize and compare the efficacy of these two nested\ngroupings to evaluate differences in drinking patterns, attitudes towards alcohol, and alcohol-related\nproblems and outcomes in US surveys offering detailed measures of these constructs such as the\nNational Alcohol Survey (NAS) and the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol Related\nConditions (NESARC). These groups should also be valuable for defining pooled models and matched\ncontrol groups for cross-section time-series analyses of alcohol policy effectiveness and in estimating\nrelationships between alcohol use measures and mortality or other outcomes in aggregate analyses at\nthe US state level. Tests of the homogeneity of state time-series relationships between alcohol sales\nand specific mortality causes within and across these groups should also be undertaken to further\nevaluate group cohesiveness.\nThis paper updates the analyses of US drinking regions last considered over 20 years ago by\nAlcohol Research Group scientists [1,2]. The availability of state-specific alcohol pattern measures\nand long-term trend data on alcohol sales has greatly improved the information on which these\nregional groups are based. A large group of states in the North Central region and the New England\nstates are found to clearly stand out in terms of having high proportions of heavy occasion drinkers and\nhigh per capita apparent consumption of alcohol, while a large group of mostly Southern states are\nfound to stand out as relatively low on these measures. The groups incorporate a variety of differing\nalcohol availability policies and tax levels suggesting the importance of exploring cultural factors such\nas religion and religious involvement [7,22], race and ethnicity [23-25] and more detailed framings of\nethnic origin [26]. These findings also suggest the importance of taking account of surrounding\nenvironments in alcohol abuse prevention efforts [27] and the implementation of effective alcohol\npolicies [28], as appears to be particularly needed in the North Central and New England states.\n"
