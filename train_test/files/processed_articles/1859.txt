Most of the metabolic\nabnormalities defining metabolic syndrome are observed in HIV.\nObjective: To determine the incidence and risk factors for\nmetabolic syndrome in HIV-infected adults in the Nutrition for\nthe findings of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nMethods: Metabolic syndrome is $3 of the following: hyper-\ntriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,\nhypertension, abdominal obesity, and high serum glucose. The\nbaseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the NFHL study (n =\nage, race, gender, poverty, exercise, and diet.\nResults: Almost one quarter of NFHL subjects had metabolic\nsyndrome. Most with metabolic syndrome (77%) had low HDL and\nhypertriglyceridemia plus $1 additional abnormality. The prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome was significantly lower in HAART and non-\nHAART users compared with NHANES participants unadjusted for\nbody mass index (BMI). After adjustment for BMI, it was no longer\nsignificant but the trend remained. The incidence of metabolic\nsyndrome in the NFHL study was higher with increasing viral load,\nhigher BMI, higher trunk-to-limb fat ratio, and Kaletra (lopinavir/\nritonavir) or didanosine (ddI) use and lower among college-educated\npersons.\nConclusions: Metabolic syndrome is mostly diagnosed through\nlow HDL and high triglycerides in HIV. The risk of developing the\nsyndrome is related to HIV, specific medications, and body fat.\nKey Words: HIV, metabolic syndrome, prevalence, incidence,\nlongitudinal study, risk factors, NHANES\nMetabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing\ncardiovascular outcomes and type II diabetes.

Furthermore, African-\nAmerican and Mexican-American women have higher rates\nthan men in each of these ethnic groups.1\nThe components of metabolic syndrome have been\nrecognized in patients infected with HIV. Low HDL and low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and elevations in\ntriglycerides were observed in untreated HIV-infected patients\nearly in the HIV epidemic, before the advent of highly active\nantiretroviral therapy (HAART).2\u00ad4 Although these abnormal-\nities were seen most often in those with more advanced\ndisease, they also occurred in patients with asymptomatic HIV\ndisease.4 Since the mid 1980s, several additional abnormalities\nhave been noted in HIV, including hypertension,5 visceral\nadiposity6,7 and insulin resistance.8,9 Although the relative\nfrequency of these abnormalities compared with the general\npopulation is debated,8 and the etiology is unclear, specific\nantiretroviral treatments9 have been implicated as causative\nagents in some studies.

Certainly, risk factors for cardiovascular disease\nand diabetes, such as poor dietary habits,11 low level of\nphysical activity,8 and smoking,12 are common in HIV-infected\nadults.\nThe prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome in\nHIV-infected adults in the United States is unknown. Two\nItalian studies found a higher prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome among Italian HIV-infected patients treated with\nthe general United States population.13\nThe purpose of this analysis was (1) to compare the\nprevalence of metabolic syndrome and each of its 5 com-\nponents in HIV-infected adults with that in the US population\n(National Health and Nutrition Survey [NHANES] 1999\u00ad\ndeveloping metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected adults.\nMETHODS\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study\nStudy Participants\nThe Nutrition for Healthy Living (NFHL) study is\na cohort of HIV-infected adult volunteers who were followed\nsemiannually to evaluate the relation between HIV infection\nand nutrition. Eligible participants included HIV-positive\nadults (aged 18 years or older) living in the greater Boston area\nor Rhode Island. Participants were recruited through advertise-\nments on the radio as well as in local newspapers, health\nclinics, and physician networks as described previously.16\u00ad18\nIndividuals were excluded if they had any of the following\nconditions at enrollment: pregnancy, thyroid disease, or any\nmalignancies other than Kaposi sarcoma. Participants were\nalso excluded if they were not fluent in English. Further details\nof this study have been reported elsewhere.19\u00ad21 Beginning in\nJuly 2000, metabolic measurements were collected, including\nfasting serum glucose and lipids, waist circumference, and\nblood pressure. The Institutional Review Boards at Tufts\nUniversity School of Medicine and Miriam Hospital, Rhode\nIsland, approved this study, and written informed consent was\nobtained from each participant. NFHL data for these analyses\nbegan at the first visit for which participants had all the\nparameters necessary to diagnose the metabolic syndrome (n =\n477). In this study, we included participants who were between\nsectional analysis was performed on the first visit in this data\nset. The longitudinal analysis was performed on those without\nmetabolic syndrome at the first visit and included all\nsubsequent visits or until a participant met the definition of\nmetabolic syndrome or died.\nInterview Data\nTrained interviewers collected information from patients\non demographics, dietary intake by 3-day food records, HIV-\nrelated clinical events, and therapy.7 HAART use was defined\nas current use at the first study visit in this data set. From\nreported household income, we determined which participants\nwere living below the US federal poverty level (yes/no).22\nDaily caloric intake was determined from the 3-day food\nrecords using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System version\n4.06_34. Physical activity was assessed by the physical\nactivity recall instrument developed by Sallis et al,23 which\nassesses usual activity over the past 7 days. We defined\n``regular exercise'' as any moderate, hard, or very hard phy-\nsical activity in the past week and ``strength training'' as any\nstrength training in the past week.\nLaboratory Data\nPlasma triglycerides, serum HDL, and plasma glucose\nBeckman LX-20 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA), plasma\nglucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method, plasma\ntriglycerides by the 2-step enzymatic method, and HDL by an\nmolecular weight). HIV RNA was measured by the Roche\nAmplicor Monitor reverse transcriptase polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Somerville,\nNJ), with a lower detection limit of 400 copies/mL.\nPhysical Examination\nBlood pressure was measured with the Omron Auto-\nmatic Inflation Blood Pressure Monitor (HEM-722CR,\nOmron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) after the partici-\npant had been seated for 5 minutes with his or her feet on the\nfloor and his or her arms supported at heart level. Subjects\nwere weighed (kilograms) on a digital scale fully dressed but\nwithout shoes, heavy clothing, or objects before eating or\ndrinking (minimum 5-hour fast). Height (centimeters) was\nmeasured without shoes by a stadiometer. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared\n(kg/m2) and then categorized into ,25 (normal or less), 25 to\nWaist circumference was taken without outer clothing,\nusing a tape measure in light contact with but not compressing,\nthe skin.25 It was measured at the natural waist indentation at\nthe end of a normal expiration while subjects were standing.\nResearch personnel were trained and recertified semiannually\nin anthropometry. The reliability of these measures has been\nshown to be high.7\nDual X-Ray Absorptiometry\nYearly dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were\nperformed on the Hologic QDR-2000 machine (Hologic,\nWaltham, MA). A series of cutoff lines positioned at\nanatomic markers was used to define trunk fat and limb fat\n(arms and legs). The ratio of trunk fat to limb fat was cal-\nculated, and the distribution was then divided into quar-\ntiles for analysis. The quartiles were determined separately\nfor men and women.\nJ Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 43, Number 4, December 1, 2006 Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in HIV\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

To be consistent with the NFHL study,\nwe included all Hispanic/Latinos except Mexican Americans,\nbecause only (0%) of NFHL participants were Mexican. In\nthe study by Ford et al, 1 Mexican Americans had the highest\nrisk of metabolic syndrome, and therefore differ from other\nHispanics.\nInterview\nData were collected by means of personal interviews.\nPoverty (yes/no) was determined by US Census Bureau\ncalculations (available at: http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/\npoverty/povdef.html). Participants were asked if they had\nengaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity and muscle-\nstrengthening activities over the past 30 days. We defined\nregular exercise as any moderate or vigorous activity over the\npast month and strength training as any strength training over\nthe past month. Average daily caloric intake was determined\nfrom 24-hour dietary recall. Daily caloric intake per body\nweight was calculated (kilocalories per kilogram per day) for\nthe NFHL study and NHANES.\nDefinition of Metabolic Syndrome\nThe definition of metabolic syndrome is based on the\n``Report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/A-\nmerican Heart Association Conference on Scientific Issues\nRelated to Definition.''26 It is defined as the presence of 3 or\nmore of the following 5 abnormalities: (1) abdominal obesity\n(waist circumference .102 cm for men and .88 cm for\nwomen, (2) hypertriglyceridemia (.150 mg/dL), (3) low HDL\ncholesterol (,40 mg/dL for men and ,50 mg/dL for women),\nmm Hg), (5) high fasting glucose ($100 mg/dL). In the NFHL\nstudy and NHANES, persons with a diagnosis of diabetes or\nbeing treated for diabetes were classified as having ``high\nfasting glucose'' (n = 9 in the NFHL study, n = 108 in the\nNHANES) and persons taking medication for high blood\npressure were defined as having high blood pressure (n = 27 in\nthe NFHL study, n = 412 in the NHANES).\nAnalytic Methods\nOutcomes\nWe evaluated metabolic syndrome and each of its\n5 components (metabolic abnormalities) as separate outcomes.\nThus, the outcomes include metabolic syndrome, low HDL,\nhypertriglyceridemia, high blood pressure, abdominal obesity,\nand high blood glucose.\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study: Prevalence\nUnadjusted Prevalence of Each Outcome in\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study\nThe unadjusted prevalence of each outcome within the\nNFHL cohort was the number of cases of the outcome divided\nby the total number of participants in the NFHL study (n =\n477). To obtain the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around\neach estimate of prevalence, we used generalized estimating\nequations (GEEs) for the binomial with the Poisson\ndistribution, and we used the log link to obtain the robust\nvariance in PROC GENMOD.27 All analyses were conducted\nin SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study Versus\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey: Characteristics and Prevalence\nCharacteristics\nTo determine if there were significant differences in\ncharacteristics of HAART users and non-HAART users in the\nNFHL study relative to characteristics of NHANES partic-\nipants, we used PROC SURVEYREG for continuous variables\nand PROC SURVEYFREQ for categoric variables. Because\nparticipants in the NHANES are selected by a complex\nmultistage design, analytic models using NHANES data must\ninclude sample weights to produce correct national estimates\nfor the NHANES and the corresponding variances. We\nspecified the strata, cluster, and weight of the sampling scheme\nfor the NHANES using the NHANES variables ``sdmvstra,''\n``sdmvpsu,'' and ``wtmec4yr,'' respectively. For the NFHL\ncohort, we set weight equal to 1 and ``sdmvpsu'' to the\nparticipant's identification number.\nUnadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Each\nOutcome: Nutrition for Healthy Living Study Versus\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nFor each outcome, we determined the odds ratio (OR)\ncomparing HAART users in the NHFL study with\nparticipants in the NHANES and non-HAART users in\nNFHL study with participants in the NHANES (PROC\nSURVEYLOGISTIC, SAS 9.1; SAS Institute)28 using the\nsame weighting scheme as explained previously. We first\nobtained an unadjusted OR and then an OR adjusted for age\nin years, race, gender, poverty, regular exercise, strength\ntraining, and caloric intake. These variables are associated\nwith metabolic syndrome, and most differ between the\nNFHL study and NHANES. We performed separate models\nadjusted for BMI in addition to the other variables\nmentioned previously. When there was significant evidence\nfor nonlinearity between age in years and each outcome, we\nincluded the significant restricted cubic spline terms in the\nmodel29 in addition to age in years. When the prevalence of\na metabolic abnormality is common, the OR may over-\nestimate the true prevalence ratio.30 In this study, all the\nmetabolic abnormalities are common, with the exception of\nhigh glucose.\nJacobson et al J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 43, Number 4, December 1, 2006\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The fre-\nquency of each combination was determined separately in the\nNFHL study and NHANES.\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study: Incidence\nof Metabolic Syndrome\nThe incidence rate of metabolic syndrome was\ndetermined among those without the syndrome at baseline\nwho were followed over time. The incidence rate was the\nnumber of new cases over the total person-months of follow-\nup. There were 7026 person-months of follow-up. The\nsectional study, there are no incidence data available for\ncomparison on HIV-negative individuals.\nWe evaluated the relative risk of developing metabolic\nsyndrome across levels of demographic, clinical, and\nnutritional predictors using Cox proportional hazards re-\ngression with time-varying covariates (PROC PHREG, SAS\n9.1; SAS Institute). Clinical and nutritional predictors were\nassessed at the beginning of the interval before an event (BMI\nand trunk-to-limb fat ratio) or over the interval before an event\n(change in viral load, weight, exercise, diet, or medication\nuse). We categorized a change in viral load .0.5 log10\ncopies/mL as reflecting clinical treatment failure. We also\ntested for duration of continuous medication use up until the\nend of the interval. We tested for types of HAART use (eg,\nprotease inhibitor [PI] based, nonnucleoside reverse transcrip-\ntase inhibitor [NNRTI] based, mixed) and specific medica-\ntions. Predictors that were associated with developing\nmetabolic syndrome at P , 0.2 on univariate analysis were\ntested in the multivariate model. Gender, age, and race were\nincluded in the final multivariate model even though they were\nnot significant independent predictors so as to adjust for\nconfounding.\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of NFHL study participants, by\nHAART use, and those of NHANES participants are shown in\nTable 1. Significant differences between the cohorts are\ndescribed in the footnote for Table 1.\nUnadjusted Prevalence of Each Outcome in\nNutrition for Healthy Living Study\nThe unadjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the\ncommon metabolic abnormalities in the NFHL study were low\nthe least common was high blood glucose (prevalence = 4%,\n95% CI: 3% to 7%).

The risk was significantly lower among those with\na college education. The risk was 80% higher among those\nwith at least a 0.5-log increase in viral load in the previous\n6 months. The risk was 2 times higher in those using\nlopinavir/ritonavir or ddI. Even after adjusting for BMI, the\nrisk was 2-fold higher among those who gained more than\n2 kg over the previous 6 months, and the risk increased from\n2.3-fold to 4.9-fold with increasing quartile of trunk fat\nrelative to limb fat.\nDuration of individual medications or types of HAART\nwas not an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the first large studies of\nthe incidence and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in HIV.\nOur results suggest that HIV itself, treatment, and host factors\naffect the risk of metabolic syndrome in HIV disease. Among\nour cohort of HIV-infected adults, the risk of developing\nmetabolic syndrome was higher in those with a clinically\nrelevant increase in viral load ($0.5 log) in the previous 6\nmonths. This association is most likely related to the effect of\nTABLE 1.

In contrast, the\nrelation between increasing viral load and metabolic syndrome\ndoes not seem to be mediated by general inflammation caused\nby chronic infection for 2 reasons. First, high viral load did not\npredict development of metabolic syndrome. Second, in\na separate analysis in our cohort, neither absolute viral load\nnor change in viral load was associated with C-reactive protein\n(CRP), a marker of generalized inflammation that is associated\nwith cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.\nSpecific antiretroviral therapies are known to affect\nindividual components of the metabolic syndrome adversely,\nsuch as increasing triglycerides (lopinavir/ritonavir,32 nevir-\napine,33 and nelfinavir33) and increasing fasting glucose\n(indinavir34 and lopinavir/ritonavir35). Other therapies have\nbeen associated with improvements in metabolic profiles, such\nas increases in HDL cholesterol (nevirapine and nelfinavir).33\nIn our cohort, lopinavir/ritonavir users had a higher risk of\ndeveloping metabolic syndrome. This is supported by results\nfrom a cross-sectional study by Jerico et al.10 In contrast to that\nstudy, we found no association between d4T and metabolic\nsyndrome.

HIV\npatients are generally prescribed ddI after they have failed\nother antiretroviral medications because of metabolic side\neffects, other toxicities, or uncontrolled viral load.\nObesity is a leading cause of metabolic syndrome in the\ngeneral population, and we found that it is an important risk\nfactor for metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected persons as well.\nMany HIV-infected patients maintain or gain weight as they\nsurvive longer with improved treatments. In our cohort, more\n(BMI $ 30). Less than 2% had a BMI , 18. Body shape was\nan equally important risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A\ngreater amount of trunk fat relative to limb fat increased the\nrisk of metabolic syndrome, even after adjusting for BMI and\nweight gain. Peripheral fat atrophy, as measured by low triceps\nskinfold, was not a predictor of metabolic syndrome, however.\nThis suggests that greater trunk fat is an important risk factor\nfor metabolic syndrome whether or not there is a significant\nloss of peripheral fat. Body shape abnormalities have been\nwidely noted in HIV since the mid-1990s, including peripheral\nfat atrophy and central fat deposition. Our previous data7 and\nthose of others36,37 suggest that these 2 abnormalities are the\nresult of separate processes that do not commonly occur\ntogether. The cardiovascular outcomes of lipodystrophy need\nfurther study.\nDespite the adverse effects of HIV and antiretroviral\ntreatments on some components of metabolic syndrome, the\nprevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower in our HIV-\ninfected cohort compared with the US population, even after\nadjusting for differences in demographics, physical activity,\nand diet between the 2 populations. There are several reasons\nwhy the rate might be lower in HIV. One possible explanation\nis that only 2 of the 5 components of metabolic syndrome were\nmore likely in HIV-infected adults compared with NHANES\nparticipants: metabolic syndrome was mostly (77%) driven by\nhypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in HIV. Both abnormalities\nhave been associated with HIV disease before and after the\nintroduction of HAART.2\u00ad4,38 The present analysis suggests\na strong effect of HIVon low HDL, because HAART and non-\nHAART had a higher prevalence of low HDL compared with\nthat in the NHANES. It also suggests a strong effect of therapy\n(but not HIV) on triglyceride levels, because only HAART\nusers differed from NHANES participants on hypertriglycer-\nidemia. Another possible explanation for differences in\nmetabolic syndrome between the NFHL study and the\nNHANES is the higher rate of obesity in the NHANES.\nAfter adjusting for BMI, the difference in metabolic syndrome\nbetween NFHL and NHANES participants was no longer\nstatistically significant, but a trend still exists. Adjustment for\nBMI when evaluating the differences in each component of the\nmetabolic syndrome between NFHL and NHANES partic-\nipants did not change the results.\nOur findings differ from those of 2 small Italian studies\non metabolic syndrome in HIV. These studies compared\nHAART patients with HIV-negative blood donors14 and\nNHANES participants13 and found an increased prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome associated with HIV infection. In\ncontrast to these studies, our population was not limited to\nHAART users and it included a more diverse demographic\ngroup of men and women. These studies may also differ\nfrom ours because HIV-negative blood donors are generally\nhealthier than the general population, and this could amplify\ndifferences in prevalence. In addition, in contrast to our\nanalyses, in comparing HAART users with NHANES\nparticipants, the authors of these small Italian studies did\nnot account for the NHANES sampling scheme in their\nanalysis, which would affect the standard errors and\ndiminish differences, nor did they adjust for confounding\nfactors.\nWhen comparing the prevalence of the other compo-\nnents of metabolic syndrome with that of the NHANES, we\nfound a similar rate of hypertension. Bergersen et al39 found\nthat patients on HAART had a similar rate of hypertension as\nHAART-naive patients and HIV-negative controls. In contrast,\nGazzaruso et al5 found a higher rate of hypertension in\nHAART patients compared with age- and sex-matched HIV-\nnegative blood donors. In another study of HIV-infected\npatients on HAART, patients with HIV-associated lipodys-\ntrophy were more likely to have hypertension than those\nwithout lipodystrophy.40 Abdominal obesity is a commonly\nreported component of HIV-associated lipodystrophy,7 and\nspecific HAART therapies may be implicated in the etiology of\nthis abnormality.41 Yet, in our cohort, the rates of abdominal\nobesity were lower than in the NHANES, even after adjusting\nfor demographics, physical activity, and dietary factors.\nAlthough lower BMI in the NFHL study may partially explain\nthe lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the NFHL\nstudy compared with the NHANES, the mechanism is unclear\nbecause the prevalence of abdominal obesity remained lower\nin the NFHL study even after adjustment for BMI. This is\nsupported by the findings of Bachetti et al36 and Gripsolver\net al,37 who found a similar prevalence of abdominal obesity in\nHIV compared with population controls in the Cardia Study.\nHigh blood glucose was rarely observed in our cohort (4%)\nand was significantly less frequent than in the NHANES.\nIndinavir has been associated with insulin resistance,34 but this\nagent was only used by 11.5% of persons in our cohort. Indin-\navir users did not have a higher prevalence of high glucose\ncompared with NHANES participants. Thus, loss of control of\nglucose seems to be infrequent and rarely contributes to the\ndiagnosis of metabolic syndrome in our HIV cohort.\nThere are several limitations to our analyses. We were\nnot able to compare our population with NHANES\nparticipants living in the northeastern United States directly,\nbecause this level of detail is not publically available. Our\nresults may not be generalizable to the entire population of\nHIV-infected adults in the United States. Our study protocol\ncalled for a minimum fast of 5 hours before collecting fasting\nlipids and glucose, whereas an 8-hour fast was required of\nparticipants in the NHANES. Neither used the 12-hour\nstandard fast. Chylomicrons may have still been present in the\nsera, exaggerating triglyceride levels. In that case, the true rate\nof metabolic syndrome might actually be lower in our study,\nshowing a greater difference between the NFHL study and\nNHANES, because participants in the NHANES had a longer\nfast. Finally, some of our participants may have had\nJ Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 43, Number 4, December 1, 2006 Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in HIV\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The exact dates of HIV infection\nand development of diabetes or hypertension cannot be known\nfor sure. Nevertheless, at the time of enrollment in the NFHL\nstudy, all 4 people who reported a past history of diabetes said\nthey were diagnosed with diabetes before they knew they were\nHIV-positive. Among those with a previous diagnosis of hy-\npertension at study entry (n = 37), 17 said they were diagnosed\nwith hypertension before they knew they were HIV-positive. If\nwe exclude those people with a diagnosis of diabetes or\nhypertension before they knew they were infected with HIV,\nwe again observe a lower rate of metabolic syndrome in HIV-\ninfected individuals compared with NHANES participants.\nWe have no data on past waist circumference or lipid levels.\nIn summary, HIV-infected patients are at risk of\nmetabolic syndrome, even though the rate is lower than that\nin the general population. HIV providers should monitor\npatients for factors that indicate a risk of cardiovascular disease\noutcomes.\nREFERENCES\n1. Ford ES, Giles WH, Dietz WH.
