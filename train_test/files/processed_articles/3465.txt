Interventions like executive orders within clinical settings and\neducational approach with vertical approaches rather than an integrated strategy to curb the use of\nantimicrobials remain limited. An underlying problem is the system of incentives that has resulted in\nthe intensification of inappropriate use by health professionals and patients. There is an urgent need to\nexplore the relationship between financial and non-financial incentives for providers and patients, to\neliminate inappropriate incentives. China's national health reforms have created an opportunity to\ncontain inappropriate use of antibiotics through more comprehensive and integrated strategies.\nContainment of microbial resistance may be achieved by strengthening surveillance at national,\nregional and hospital levels; eliminating detrimental incentives within the health system; and changing\nprescribing behaviors to a wider health systems approach, to achieve long-term, equitable and\nsustainable results and coordinate stakeholders' actions through transparent sharing of information.\n",

This is of particular concern in\nthe developing world, where bacterial infec-\ntion remains one of the major precursors of\ndisease. There, antimicrobial agents play a\ncritical role in healthcare; thus, the increas-\ning rates of AMR pose a serious threat to\ninfection control. Overprescription of anti-\nmicrobials not only wastes limited health\nresources but also creates substantial finan-\ncial burdens and poor health outcomes for\nboth individuals and countries. Because\nChina's population accounts for one-fifth\nof the world's population, its efforts and\ncontributions to controlling AMR are crit-\nical to overall global health.\nAntimicrobial resistance in China\nmicrobial resistance among hospital-acquired\ninfections in China reached 41% (range,\ncoupled with China's high prevalence of\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA), has created a major healthcare\nisolation rate of MRSA in clinical settings\nwas between 55% and 63%, with resistance\nrates at tertiary hospitals in large cities higher\nthan those in lower-level hospitals. The\nCHINET AMR surveillance network\nreported that in these tertiary hospitals, the\naverage MRSA isolation rate ranged from\n44.6%. There are also significant geograph-\nical differences reported across China. For\nexample, eastern China has the highest preva-\nlence of MRSA at 76.9%, and the prevalence\nin large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and\nGuangzhou are higher than those of smaller\naureus isolated from pediatric patients is\nMRSA, which is about half that seen in\nadult patients.5\nMoreover, MRSA's antimicrobial resist-\nance spectrum is broad, with resistance rates\nof up to 50% for macrolides, clindamycin,\naminoglycosides and quinolones.6,7 Among\ngram-negative bacteria, resistance rates of\nnon-fermentative bacteria were the lowest.\nThe resistance rates of Pseudomonas,\nAcinetobacter and Stenotrophornonas to cefo-\nand 20.85%, respectively. Resistance rates of\nPseudomonas and Acinetobacter to imipenem\nreports of the 1990s, and particularly since\n(ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have\nspread rapidly across China. The prevalence\nof ESBL-producing Escherichia coli strains\nvaries across regions. Even carbapenems,\nonce regarded the treatment of last resort\nagainst serious gram-negative bacterial infec-\ntions, have begun to lose efficacy as carbape-\nnem-resistant bacteria emerge and quickly\nspread.\nThe resistance rates of nosocomial infec-\ntions are on the rise, and most are multidrug\nresistant. Antimicrobial agents with enzyme\ninhibitors are more sensitive than non-\nenzyme inhibitors. Resistance has a tendency\nto increase, especially in Acinetobacter bau-\nmannii and to third-generation cephalo-\nsporins (Table 1).\nOverall resistance rates have remained\nstable since 2011 when the Chinese govern-\nment initiated nationwide interventions\nto reduce the overuse of antimicrobials.\nHowever, resistance to carbapenems con-\ntinues to increase rapidly.\nAntimicrobial use in China\nThe increasing prevalence of AMR is closely\nrelated to the overuse of antimicrobial\nagents.

These costs would tax the\nhealthcare budgets of even the wealthiest\ncountries,\nCurrent policies to improve\nantibiotics prescription\nand reduce antimicrobial\nresistance\nIn China, two main government agencies\nregulate the use of antibiotics: the China\nFood and Drug Administration (CFDA) is\nresponsible for registering, producing and\ndistributing medicines; and the National\nHealth and Family Planning Commission\n(NHFPC) oversees their clinical use, in\naddition to pharmacies and infection con-\ntrol in health facilities. To encourage the\nappropriate use of medicines, these agencies\nhave implemented a series of regulations and\nstrategies, which include requesting retail\npharmacies to sell antimicrobials with\nical pathways, standard treatment guidelines\nand clinical use guidelines for antibiotics\nantimicrobial clinical use and resistance\nsurveillance networks were created in 2005\nto collect, analyze and report routine data\nfrom hospitals.23 Prescriptions were for-\nadministration in health facilities was\nmedicines use surveillance network (for\ngeneral medicines, not specifically for\nantimicrobials) was set up in 2009 to collect\nmedicines use data from health facilities\nand to recommend interventions for\nantimicrobials stocked and used in different\ntypes of health facilities were clearly deli-\nneated, and national targets for the clinical\nuse of antimicrobials were set.27 The\nNational Action Plan to Contain\nDespite the implementation of numerous\npolicies, nationwide use of surveillance net-\nworks and a national oversight committee, the\ninappropriate use of medicines continues in\nChina. According to the National Surveillance\nReport of Adverse Drug Reactions in 2015,\nallopathic (Western) medicines accounted for\n81.2% of the total adverse drug reaction\nreports, among which 44.9% were anti-infec-\ntives and 61.3% were antimicrobial infu-\nsions.29 These reports indicate that a serious\nproblem persists. In 2012, the proportion of\ntotal pharmaceutical expenditure remained\nthe average proportion of costs for outpatient\nand inpatient medicines remained at respect-\nexpenditures per patient.30 It is clear that\nmore must be done to ameliorate this\nsituation.\nThe main reason for the lack of success in\nthis regard is that intervention strategies\nhave remained limited to executive orders\nand one-time inspections, within the scope\nof clinical educational interventions. The\npharmaceutical sector is complex and\ninvolves many stakeholders and divergent\ninterests. Policy interventions to improve\nmedicines use by any one actor will impact\nthe behavior of the rest. Because of the\nspecial nature of this sector, case-by-case\nsolutions that only target an individual\nproblem often fail to achieve the expected\nresults because the goals of individual\npolicies may be inconsistent with or even\ndiametrically opposed to other policies.\nMoreover, the interests of different entities\noften interfere with those of other bodies.\nAn example is the national health system's\nincentive structure, which adversely influ-\nences health professionals and intensifies the\nproblem. Adding to these obstacles are the\nlack of suitable, integrated strategies, lack of\ninteraction between clinical and social sci-\nence professionals and lack of acknowledg-\nment of prescriber and patient behaviors.\nUntil all these obstacles are overcome, the\ninappropriate use of medicines can never\nbe effectively and sustainably controlled.\nA wider, systemic approach is needed to\nachieve long-term, equitable and sustainable\nresults. Further research that explores the\nrelationship between appropriate incentives\n(including financial and non-financial\napproaches) and the behaviors of providers\nand patients are needed to effect lasting\nchange.\nChallenges to reducing\nantimicrobial resistance\nAccording to one study of global antibiotic\nunits. BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia,\nIndia, China and South Africa), with 41%\nresponsible for more than three-quarters of\nthat surge. China was the second largest\nconsumer of antibiotics in the world in\nin the hospital sector of BRICS countries.\nOne reason for this is the rapid economic\ngrowth that has enabled China to achieve\nthis situation has secured much greater\naccess to medicines (including antibiotics),\nit has also meant that many broad-spectrum\nantibiotics have been sold over-the-counter\nwithout a documented clinical need. Official\nregulations addressing this have in fact\nbeen issued; however, they have not been\nrigorously implemented in some areas of the\ncountry. Moreover, official guidelines for\nthe clinical use of antimicrobials in China\nhave only recently been developed, and\nevidence-based use has not yet been widely\naccepted by health professionals, who gen-\nerally adopt the opinions of their senior\nCompared with hospital care in urban\nareas, primary care in rural areas faces even\ngreater challenges because of the lack of\nqualified health professionals and poor\naccess to information, as well as lower\neconomic development. Problems of irra-\ntional use of antibiotics at primary care\nfacilities in rural areas may lead to an\nincreasing number of resistance problems\nat higher levels of care. In addition, the\nincrease in travel and migration that has\naccompanied China's rapid economic devel-\nopment has also contributed to the growth\nof the nation's AMR problem.\nMost importantly, the Chinese health\nsystem has been burdened by detrimental\nfinancial incentives, which have intensified\nthe overuse of antimicrobial drugs. These\nincentives include 1) inappropriate govern-\nment subsidies whereby limited resources are\nfocused on tertiary hospitals and infrastruc-\nture construction, and most other public\nhealth facilities depend on the sale of medi-\ncines to generate funding,35 and 2) distorted\npricing policies whereby the government sets\nthe prices for medical services far below the\nreal cost whereas prices for large-scale med-\nical equipment, diagnostic tests, medical\nsupplies and brand name medicines are set\nmuch higher than the actual cost, which\ninduces health providers to overprescribe\nexpensive medicines and diagnostic tests\nrather than provide quality care that is cost-\neffective.36 Other major problems include the\nconflict between insufficient public resources\nand the resource-exhausted fee-for-service\nprovider payment mechanism,37 unsound\nmedicine procurement mechanisms with no\nappropriate incentives for facilities to\nprocure low-priced medicines, and ``reverse-\nproof'' responsibility for medical disputes\nthat encourages a defensive, prescription-\noriented attitude among physicians.38\nA fourfold path to future reduc-\ntion of AMR in China\nStrengthening surveillance at all levels\nNational level. In response to World Health\nAssembly resolutions urging member states\nto formulate measures to promote the\nproper and cost-effective use of antibiotics,39\nChina's NHFPC--formerly known as the\nMinistry of Health (MoH)--committed\nto increasing its scrutiny of antimicrobial\nuse and resistance. Two national surveil-\nlance networks were established in 2005 by\nthe MoH for the above purpose. Initially,\n35 tertiary hospitals joined the networks,\nand this had expanded to 1,427 hospitals\n(including both tertiary and secondary hos-\npitals) by the end of 2014. These networks\nregularly collect, consolidate, summarize\nand analyze data on clinical antimicrobial\nuse and resistance. They have also estab-\nlished national databases for routine sur-\nveillance and evaluation, provided feedback\nto member hospitals and have periodically\nreported to the MoH. The networks also\ndeveloped a set of standardized indicators\nand methods for data collection as well as an\nelectronic data reporting system that enables\nhospitals to report online. These networks\nalso disseminate standardized data collec-\ntion and reporting methods at the local level\nand act as a clearinghouse to share infor-\nmation across all levels of surveillance and\nevaluation.\nRegional level. Until the end of 2014, each\nprovince had its own surveillance network.\nSome regions had also set up intercity\nnetworks, which greatly strengthened sur-\nveillance and evaluation and informed\npolicy at the local level.\nHospital level. According to the national\ncampaign,23 all tertiary and secondary hos-\npitals are required to monitor and evaluate\nantimicrobial clinical use and resistance at\ntheir facility. The NHFPC also created a set\nof national targets for all participating hos-\npitals, intended to decrease the number\nof prescriptions that included antibiotics to\ninpatients, respectively. Prophylactic anti-\nbiotics are to be given before surgical inci-\nsion (except cesarean), and the general\nduration of prophylaxis is to be < 24 hours\n(except under specific conditions). Hospitals\nare required to maintain total inpatient\nconsumption of antibiotics for systemic use\ntient days. At each of the hospitals involved,\ntraining is provided to help staff clearly\nunderstand the new program's requirements\nand goals, as well as to learn strategies for\nachieving the targets.\nElimination of inappropriate financial\nincentives\nOngoing health system reforms in China\nhave created an opportunity to address the\nissue of incentives within the healthcare\nsystem. The problem stems from an illogical\nfinancing model in which hospital revenue\nis generated by mark-up of medicines.\nAs top decision makers work to improve\nthe system, this model is giving way to a\nfinancing model in which revenue is instead\ngenerated by providing quality services\nthrough allowing market competition.\nThe distorted pricing system of medical\nservices and medicinal products has been\nchanging towards a value-based pricing and\nprice negotiation mechanism, to replace the\nformer cost plus price setting methods.\nHealth insurance programs are required\nto develop innovative strategies to create\nincentives for the appropriate use of medi-\ncines. These measures include expanding\ncoverage for both inpatient and outpatient\nservices; increasing diagnostic, treatment and\ndispensing fees to make up for lost revenues\nfrom medicines sales; changing payment\nmethods from retrospective fee-for-service\nto prospective capitation-based and case-\nbased mixed payments; and supporting\npolices to secure the quality of care, including\nthe appropriate use of medicines.\nPrescription behavior changes\nPrescription behavior is determined by a\nvariety of internal, external, social, eco-\nnomic and cultural factors. The effectiveness\nof interventions to improve prescribing\nbehavior depends to a large degree on the\ncontent, delivery mechanism, intensity, con-\ntext and implementation environment.\nMedicine interventions can be categorized\nby type of measure, including clinical, edu-\ncational, managerial, financial and regula-\ntory.40,41 Effective interventions are always\nbroad-based, multidimensional programs\nthat are adapted to the particular situation\nand address local barriers to change. No\nsingle intervention can modify all behaviors\nrestricting the use of antibiotics does not\nlead to a desirable, scientifically sound and\ncost-effective outcome. One reason is that\nmedical professionals have a seemingly deep-\nrooted dislike of inexpensive, basic anti-\nbiotics such as penicillins and other narrow\nspectrum antibiotics.20 Therefore, clinical\neducational interventions, even those linked\nto managerial measures, have failed to coun-\nteract these negative perceptions. Rather\nthan simply restricting use, more sophisti-\ncated and comprehensive policies are needed,\nespecially when hospital financing is heavily\ndependent on the sale of medicines and\nprescribers themselves can earn additional\nincome from dispensing or selling medicines.\nThe ways in which healthcare is financed\nand how healthcare providers are paid\ngreatly affect treatment decisions because\nfinancing mechanisms create different incen-\ntives for providers.46 In many resource-\npoor low- and middle-income countries,\nfor instance, health systems are not appro-\npriately funded and regulated.47\nConsequently, economic factors can be\nimportant barriers to guideline compliance.48\nNew and more sophisticated financing mech-\nanisms are needed, with units of payment\nbecoming broader and prices for bundled\nservices set on a prospective basis.49,50\nCoordination of stakeholders and infor-\nmation sharing\nCoordination and information sharing could\nprovide an up-to-date overview of the present\nsituation of AMR. Increased collaboration\nbetween networks will make it increasingly\nimportant to share experiences and form a\nbasis of coordinated collaboration to change\nbehaviors. In addition, surveillance systems\nmust be flexible and able to adapt to emer-\nging microbial resistance and not focus on\nwhat is already known. Surveillance systems\nshould also be able to promptly deliver\ninformation to avoid delays in public health\nactions at both local and national levels.\nConclusion\nThe use of antibiotics and antimicrobial\nresistance is a great challenge for China.\nFortunately, ongoing health system reforms\nhave created opportunities to address this\nchallenge using more comprehensive and\nintegrated strategies so as to fundamentally\nchange the incentives for use of antibiotics\nand to contain resistance.\n"
