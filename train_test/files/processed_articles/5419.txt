Compared to patients with\nsimilar levels of hypertension, patients with primary aldo-\nsteronism have greater left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\nand increased rate of cardiovascular complications.4,5 The\npresence of LVH should be detected as early as possible to\nprevent cardiovascular complications associated with the\ncondition. The 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is rec-\nommended as the routine test for detection of LVH in\npatients with arterial hypertension because of its estab-\nlished clinical value, broad availability, and low cost.\nSokolow-Lyon index,6 Cornell voltage index,7 Cornell\nproduct index,8 and Gubner index9 have been most com-\nmonly used to rule out LVH in patients with arterial hyper-\ntension. In this study, we evaluated their comparative\ndiagnostic value for LVH in patients with primary\naldosteronism.\nMethods\nStudy population\nwith primary aldosteronism were referred to our hospital.\nPrimary aldosteronism was confirmed with captopril chal-\nlenge test, furosemide plus upright test and/or salt loading\nImpact of electrocardiographic findings\nfor diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy\nin patients with primary aldosteronism\nSatoshi Kurisu, Toshitaka Iwasaki, Naoya Mitsuba, Ken Ishibashi,\nYoshihiro Dohi and Yasuki Kihara\n Keywords\nAldosteronism, electrocardiogram, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, diagnosis\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine, Hiroshima University Graduate\nSchool of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nSatoshi Kurisu, MD, 1-2-3, Kasumi-cho, Minami-ku, Hiroshima,\nEmail: skurisu@nifty.com\nOriginal Article\n132 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\ntest. One patient with ventricular pacing and four patients\nwith bundle branch block were excluded from analysis\nbecause electrocardiographic LVH could not be assessed in\nthese patients. Thus, this study consisted of 88 patients with\nprimary aldosteronism. Informed consent was obtained\nfrom each patient.\nLaboratory examinations\nPRA and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were\nmeasured by radioimmunoassay. Blood was collected from\nan antecubital vein, and serum potassium concentrations\nwere measured using a standard ion electrode method.\nHypokalemia was defined as serum potassium less than 3.6\nElectrocardiogram\nA 12-lead ECG was recorded on admission at a paper speed\nof 25 mm/sec and an amplification of 10 mm/mV. We ana-\nlyzed in detail the four most commonly used ECG indexes,\nincluding Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage index,\nCornell product index, and Gubner index. These indexes\nwere measured in each ECG as follows:\nSokolow-Lyon index - SV1\nCornell voltage index - RaVL\nCornell product index - men: (RaVL\n)\u00d7QRS duration;\nwomen (RaVL\n+ 8 )\u00d7QRS duration\nGubner index - RI + SIII\nElectrocardiographic LVH was defined as Sokolow-Lyon\nindex > 3.5 mV, Cornell voltage index > 2.8 mV in men and\nin men and > 2440 mm\u00b7ms in women, and Gubner index >\nEchocardiography\nTransthoracic echocardiographic data were obtained on\nadmission using a commercial ultrasound machine. Two-\ndimensional guided M-mode measurements of left ventricu-\nlar end-diastolic diameter (LVDD), interventricular septum\nthickness (IVS), and posterior wall thickness (PW) were\nmeasured. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated using\nthe formula of Deverreux and Reichek11,12: left ventricular\nindex was calculated by dividing LVM by body surface area.\nEchocardiographic LVH was defined as LVM index > 131 g/\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with chi-square\nand Student's t-tests. Relations between variables were\ndetermined by linear regression analysis. All data are\nexpressed as mean\u00b1SD.

On the other hand, no significant\ncorrelation was found between Gubner index and LVM\nindex.\nEffect of hypokalemia on QRS voltage of\nECG indexes\nThere were 28 patients with hypokalemia and 60 patients\nwith normokalemia (Table 3). Serum potassium levels were\nSokolow-Lyon index and Cornell voltage index as well as\nLVM index were significantly higher in hypokalemic\npatients than normokalemic patients. However, these ECG\nindexes divided by LVM index were similar between the\ntwo groups. There was no significant difference in Gubner\nindex between the two groups.\nDiscussion\nThe current study demonstrated the following: 1) com-\nmonly used ECG indexes had a reasonably high specificity,\nbut the power to rule in LVH was unsatisfactory because of\nlow sensitivity in patients with primary aldosteronism; and\n2) Cornell voltage index and Cornell product index had a\nbetter diagnostic value for LVH, and had a better correla-\ntion with LVM index.\nArterial hypertension is a major cause of coronary artery\ndisease, stroke, LVH, and heart failure. Several studies\nhave shown that LVH is an important risk factor in patients\nwith hypertension, leading to a 5- to 10-fold increase in\ncardiovascular risk.14\u00ad16 ECG is a routine test to rule out\nLVH in patients with hypertension. Although more than 30\nindexes for detection of LVH have been described, only\nseveral ECG indexes such as Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell\nvoltage index, Cornell product index, and Gubner index\nremain to be used in the clinical setting.\nPrevious clinical studies showed that patients with pri-\nmary aldosteronism had greater LVH and worse diastolic\nfunction compared to patients with similar levels of hyper-\ntension.4 The renin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system is\nthought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of LVH\nindependent of increased blood pressure.17 Experimental\nstudies have shown that aldosterone induces cardiomyocyte\nhypertrophy, profound changes in the extracellular matrix,\nleading to collagen deposition and subsequently to myocar-\ndial fibrosis.18\u00ad20 Although primary aldosteronism is often\naccompanied by LVH, there has been no report evaluating\ncomparative diagnostic value of ECG indexes for LVH in\nthese patients. In the current study, we demonstrated that\ncommonly used ECG indexes had a reasonably high speci-\nficity, but a low sensitivity for LVH in patients with primary\naldosteronism. Our results in primary aldosteronism were\nsimilar to those previously shown in arterial hypertension.21\nAmong the four indexes, Cornell voltage index and Cornell\nproduct index had a better diagnostic value for LVH, and had\na better correlation with LVM index in patients with primary\naldosteronism. Both adrenalectomy and aldosterone antago-\nnists are known to be effective in reducing LVM index in\npatients with primary aldosteronism.22,23 Our results sug-\ngested that Cornell voltage or Cornell product index might\nbe suitable for evaluating the degree of LVH or monitoring\nreduced LVH after these interventions.\nThe ECG was insensitive for detection of LVH in the\ncurrent study. However, previous studies have shown that\nelectrocardiographic LVH and echocardiographic LVH\npredict mortality independently of each other,24 and that\ncombined these findings improve risk stratification.25 These\nimply that electrocardiographic LVH and echocardio-\ngraphic LVH in part carry different prognostic information.\nTable 3. Comparison of QRS voltage between hypokalemic and normokalemic patients.\nHypokalemic patients (n=28) Normokalemic patients (n=60) p value\nLVM: left ventricular mass.\nTherefore, both ECG and echocardiography should be per-\nformed to assess the considerable risk associated with these\nconditions in patients with primary aldosteronism.\nPrevious studies reported that a significant reduction of\nQRS voltage was observed after short-term potassium sup-\nplementation, suggesting hypokalemia might be at least\npartly relevant to the high QRS voltage in patients with pri-\nmary aldosteronism.26 In the current study, Sokolow-Lyon\nindex and Cornell voltage index as well as LVM index were\nsignificantly higher in hypokalemic patients than normoka-\nlemic patients. However, these ECG indexes divided by\nLVM index were similar between the two groups, suggest-\ning that QRS voltage reflected LVM index well in spite of\nserum potassium level. It appeared that hypokalemia did\nnot affect QRS voltage as much as LVM index. In the cur-\nrent study, PAC was significantly higher in hypokalemic\npatients than normokalemic patients. Therefore, we specu-\nlated that hypokalemia reflected more severe hyperaldo-\nsteronism that could cause greater LVH.\nThere are several limitations in the current study. First,\nwe did not assess other ECG indexes. Romhilt-Estes score\nhas been also used to rule out LVH in patients with arterial\nhypertension. However, this scoring system is not easy in\nthe clinical setting, and includes ST-T segment pattern with\nhigh points that is often associated with hypokalemia.27,28\nBecause there was a possibility that Romhilt-Estes score\nmight overestimate LVH especially in hypokalemic patients,\nwe did not include Romhilt-Estes score in the current study.\nSecond, we obtained ECG and echocardiographic data rou-\ntinely only before potassium supplement in hypokalemic\npatients. Therefore, we could not assess the change in these\ndata before and after potassium supplement. There was a\npossibility that, in hypokalemic patients, ECG indexes after\npotassium supplementation might have a better diagnostic\nvalue for LVH, and had a better correlation with LVM index\nin patients with primary aldosteronism.\nIn conclusion, ECG indexes had a reasonably high spec-\nificity, but a low sensitivity for LVH in patients with pri-\nmary aldosteronism. Cornell voltage index and Cornell\nproduct index had a better diagnostic value of LVH, and\nhad a better correlation with LVM index in these patients.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
