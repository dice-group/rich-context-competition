Results\nfor other BP parameters were not consistent; simultaneous\nconsideration of two parameters did not improve predic-\ntion of fatal stroke over systolic BP alone.\nConclusions: Our results agree with previous studies\nthat indicate systolic BP is an important predictor of stroke\nrisk for all groups within the population and provide\nfurther evidence of the need to control systolic BP in the\nAmerican Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nKey Words: Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood\npressure, stroke.\nHypertension, an important risk factor for stroke,\naffects nearly 65 million Americans.1 Efforts to\ntreat and control elevated blood pressure (BP)\ninitially relied heavily on diastolic BP.2 Results from the\nSystolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP)\never, shifted the focus to systolic BP.3 Recently, increased\nattention has been given to pulse pressure (PP) (defined as\nsystolic BP  diastolic BP) and mean arterial pressure\n(MAP) (defined as 2/3 diastolic BP  1/3 systolic BP) as a\npredictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.4\u00ad7\nBowman and colleagues recently reported that of the four\nBP parameters (systolic BP, diastolic BP, PP, MAP),\nsystolic BP was a consistent and more significant predictor\nof CVD6 and stroke7 death among a sample of healthy,\npredominantly white men from the Physician's Health\nStudy. Whether these results are similar for men and\nwomen, and for African Americans and whites, remains\nunknown.\nWe used data from the Second National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality\nStudy, a nationally representative cohort of US adults, to\nexamine the risk of fatal stroke associated with systolic\nBP, diastolic BP, PP, and MAP stratified by gender and\nethnicity. Similar to Bowman and colleagues,6,7 we con-\nsidered the BP parameters individually and systolic BP in\ncombination with the other three parameters to examine\nwhether two BP parameters improved the prediction of\nstroke events.\nMethods\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted\nnationwide probability sample of approximately 28,000\nchildren and adults, was designed to be representative of\nthe civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. A de-\ntailed description of the NHANES II survey and sampling\nprocedures is available elsewhere.8\nAs part of NHANES II, persons underwent a physical\nexamination by a physician. At the beginning of the ex-\namination the physician measured the sample person's BP\n(in mm Hg) while the individual was in a sitting position.\nBlood pressure was taken twice more at the end of the\nexamination, once while the person was recumbent and\nagain while sitting. Thus, three BP readings were mea-\nsured according to American Heart Association guide-\nlines9 at baseline. The BP measurement used in this\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. David W.

Serum cholesterol concentrations (in milligrams\nper deciliter), height (in centimeters), and weight (kilo-\ngrams) were measured. Participants also completed a med-\nical history that included questions about CVD, physical\nactivity, and cigarette smoking, including a lifetime smok-\ning history and current smoking status (yes/no). Former\nsmokers were those who had smoked 100 cigarettes\nduring their lifetime but who were not currently smoking.\nWe merged baseline data from NHANES II with fol-\nlow-up data from the NHANES II Mortality Study, a\nyears at the time of their NHANES II examination.10 As\npart of the Mortality Study, data from the National Death\nIndex, which has been shown to capture 93% to 98% of all\nUS deaths,11\u00ad13 and from the Social Security Administra-\ntion Death Master File were used to ascertain the vital\n(approximately 17 years of follow-up). Information ob-\ntained from the Mortality Study data included the month\nand year in which a person was last known alive and the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 9th revision\n(ICD-9) code for the cause of death. We used the 15th day\nof the month in our analysis as the day of the date last known\nconsidered the last known date alive. Survival time was\ncalculated as the difference between the NHANES II baseline\nexamination date for each person and the last known date\nalive obtained from the Mortality Study. Multiple causes\nof death were available for 98% of decedents.\nFrom the Mortality Study cohort (n  9252), we ex-\ncluded those lost to follow-up, with missing data for study\nvariables, as well as those who were not either white or\nAfrican Americans, who reported a history of stroke or\ncoronary heart disease, or who were currently using anti-\n3462 women) participants with complete information were\nincluded in the analysis.\nThe outcome for the study was fatal stroke defined by\nischemic attack). We used Cox proportional hazards re-\ngression to estimate, by means of the hazard ratio, the\nrelative risk (RR) of fatal stroke associated with a 10 mm\nHg increase in each of the four BP parameters in regres-\nsion models adjusted for age (continuous), gender, ethnic-\nity (white, African American), education (12 years, 12\nyears, 12 years), physical activity (moderate or inactive,\nmoderate, more than moderate), body mass index (defined\nas weight in kg/height in meters squared; continuous),\nsmoking status (current, former, never), aspirin use, total\nserum cholesterol (continuous), and diabetes (yes, no).\nEach BP parameter was first modeled individually. We\nthen examined models with two BP parameters. We used\nlikelihood ratio tests (LR  2 ln L1\n]) to\ncompare regression models. We also assessed collinearity\nbetween BP parameters using Pearson correlation coeffi-\ncients and multicollinearity diagnostic statistics (tolerance\nand variance inflation factors [VIF]). Although there is no\nformal cutoff value to use with the VIF for determining the\npresence of multicollinearity, values of VIF exceeding 10\nare often regarded as indicative of multicollinearity. The\nVIF values 2.5 may be cause for concern. To remain\nconsistent with the work of Bowman and colleagues in a\nnationally representative cohort, we followed their manner\nof analyses while reporting VIF values.\nTo make the NHANES representative of the US pop-\nulation, sample weights were used in all analyses. Statis-\ntical analyses were completed using SAS v8.0 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Models were fit to\nthe data using SUDAAN to account for the complex sam-\npling design and to achieve accurate variance estimates.\nCategorical variables were compared between groups with a\n2 test; continuous variables were compared between groups\nwith ANOVA. We assessed the appropriateness of the pro-\nportional hazard assumption for the variables in our final\nmodel with log\u00adlog survival plots and Schoenfeld residual\nplots. Without exception, all covariates in the final model\nsatisfied the proportional hazard assumption. Model pa-\nrameter estimates were computed by maximum likelihood\ntechniques. Relative hazards were obtained by exponenti-\nating estimated regression model coefficients, and 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) were based on the standard error\nof the model coefficients. All statistical inferences were\nbased on a significance level of .05.\nResults\nincluded in the analysis. The mean age (standard error of\nmean) of the sample was 47 (0.25) years.

Pearson correlation\ncoefficients were 0.717 for systolic BP versus diastolic BP,\ndiastolic BP versus MAP, and 0.509 for PP versus MAP\n(all, P  .001) (data not shown). The VIF for systolic BP\nwas 2.5 and diastolic BP VIF was 2.3 within the systolic\nBP\u00addiastolic BP parameter pair. Systolic BP VIF was 3.9\nand PP VIF 3.7 within the systolic BP\u00adPP parameter pair,\nand systolic BP VIF was 7.2 and MAP VIF was 6.9 within\nthe systolic BP\u00adMAP parameter pair.\nDuring follow-up (median  14.6 years), there were\n.001) values were greater for those who died from stroke\ncompared to those who did not, although these patterns\ndiffered somewhat by age. For example, BP parameters\nwere similar or slightly lower for fatal stroke cases than\nfor those who did not die among adults 65 to 74 years.\nAfter multivariable adjustment, each of the individual\nBP parameters was associated with an increased risk of\nfatal stroke for the total sample (systolic BP: 1.18 [95%\ntistical significance in stratified analyses for men or\nwomen (Fig. 1). In addition, MAP estimates were not\nstatistically significant for men, women, or whites. The\naddition of a second BP parameter to a model containing\nsystolic BP did not improve model fit (P value for LR test\n .05, all). Addition of a diastolic BP, PP, or MAP\nparameter to the systolic BP model resulted in a positive\nassociation between systolic BP and the risk of fatal\nstroke, whereas the associations for the second parameter\nwere attenuated and no longer predictive; statistically sig-\nnificant RRs (P  .05) were observed for systolic BP RR,\nstolic BP. Similar results were observed after stratifying\non ethnicity (white versus African Americans) (Fig. 1).\nDiscussion\nThe prevalence of hypertension, which affects nearly one\n2000.1 The lifetime risk of developing hypertension\namong middle-aged and older adults is 90%.14 In this\nstudy of a nationally representative cohort of men and\nwomen, systolic BP was independently associated with an\nincreased risk of fatal stroke among men and women and\namong whites and African Americans. Other BP parame-\nters did not consistently predict fatal stroke. Inclusion of\ntwo BP parameters did not improve model fit versus\nmodels with systolic BP alone.\nOur findings complement those from similar studies of\nBP parameters and risk of stroke.

Only systolic BP was consistently associ-\nated with stroke death and models with two BP parameters\ndid not fit the data better than models with systolic BP\nalone. Similar findings were observed for CVD deaths\namong 53,163 apparently healthy men from the Physi-\ncian's Health Study after a median of nearly 6 years of\nHeart Disease study that followed 9611 male civil servants\nand Goldbourt5 also observed significant associations be-\ntween all four BP parameters and fatal stroke (339 stroke\ndeaths). Results for models with two BP parameters dif-\nfered across normotensive, hypertensive, and isolated sys-\ntolic hypertensive strata. For example, systolic BP but not\ndiastolic BP was a significant predictor of stroke death\namong normotensive men, whereas both systolic and dia-\nstolic BP were significant predictors among hypertensive\nmen and men with isolated systolic hypertension. In other\ntwo BP parameter models, PP and diastolic BP were\nsignificant predictors of fatal stroke among normotensive\nand hypertensive men, whereas PP and MAP were both\nsignificant predictors of fatal stroke among normotensives\nbut not hypertensives.\nThere are several possible explanations for differences\nbetween studies. We used the average of multiple BP\nmeasurements obtained by physicians in a standardized\nenvironment, whereas BP measurements from the Physi-\ncian's Health Study were self-reported. We had limited\npower to detect a significant effect of BP on risk of fatal\nstroke due to a small number of stroke events and we were\nunable to stratify on stroke type. It is possible that rela-\ntionships between BP parameters and stroke differ by the\ntype of event (eg, ischemic versus hemorrhagic), although\nBowman and colleagues7 reported similar relationships for\nOur study included men and women, whereas the other\nstudies focused only on men. We included African-Amer-\nicans in this analysis; the Physician's Health Study cohort\nwas predominantly white.14 Finally, collinearity diagnos-\ntics indicated possible issues with certain BP parameter\ncombinations.\nIn conclusion, results from the NHANES II Mortality\nStudy agree with those from previous studies and show\nthat systolic BP is an important risk predictor for fatal\nstroke. These relationships were observed among men and\nwomen, as well as among whites and African Americans\nand provide further evidence of the need to control systolic\nBP in the population.\nReferences\n1.
