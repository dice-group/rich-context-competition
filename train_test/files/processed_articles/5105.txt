    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIF (intermediate filament) proteins can be cleaved by caspases\nto generate proapoptotic fragments as shown for desmin.\nThesefragmentscanalsocausefilamentaggregation.Thehy-\npothesis is that disease-causing mutations in IF proteins and\ntheir subsequent characteristic histopathological aggregates\ncould involve caspases. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein),\na closely related IF protein expressed mainly in astrocytes, is\nalso a putative caspase substrate. Mutations in GFAP cause\nAxD (Alexander disease). The overexpression of wild-type or\nmutant GFAP promotes cytoplasmic aggregate formation,\nwith caspase activation and GFAP proteolysis. In this study,\nwe report that GFAP is cleaved specifically by caspase 6 at\nVELD225 in its L12 linker domain in vitro. Caspase cleavage of\nGFAP at Asp225 produces two major cleavage products. While\nthe C-GFAP (C-terminal GFAP) is unable to assemble into fil-\naments, the N-GFAP (N-terminal GFAP) forms filamentous\nstructures that are variable in width and prone to aggre-\ngation. The effect of N-GFAP is dominant, thus affecting\nnormal filament assembly in a way that promotes filament\naggregation. Transient transfection of N-GFAP into a human\nastrocytoma cell line induces the formation of cytoplasmic\naggregates, which also disrupt the endogenous GFAP net-\nworks. In addition, we generated a neo-epitope antibody that\nrecognizes caspase-cleaved but not the intact GFAP. Using\nthis antibody, we demonstrate the presence of the caspase-\ngenerated GFAP fragment in transfected cells expressing a\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed (email mdperng@life.nthu.edu.tw).\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease, AxD, Alexander disease; C-GFAP, C-terminal GFAP; CNS, central nervous system; DTT, dithiothreitol; GAPDH,\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; IF, intermediate filament; N-GFAP, N-terminal GFAP OA, okadaic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered\nsaline; TBST, TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ndisease-causing mutant GFAP and in two mouse models of\nAxD.

This is well\ndemonstrated in astrocytes, in which GFAP (glial fibrillary\nacidic protein), vimentin and nestin are the major IF proteins.\nWhile vimentin and nestin are mainly expressed in imma-\nture astrocytes, GFAP is coexpressed with vimentin in mature\nAxD (Alexander disease) is a primary genetic disorder of\nastrocytes that typically affects young children (Messing\net al., 2012). It is caused by missense mutations in the coding\nregion of GFAP (Brenner et al., 2001). Although this is the\nmost common form of AxD, milder forms with intermediate\nM-H Chen and others\nages of onset also exist. A key histopathological feature of all\nforms of AxD is the widespread deposition of inclusion bodies\nwithin astrocytes known as Rosenthal fibers, consisting of\naggregated GFAP, the small stress proteins HSP27 and\net al., 1993) and likely other unidentified proteins. Whether\nRosenthal fibres per se cause astrocyte dysfunction and\nwhat the precise trigger is for their formation are not clear.\nMouse models created via both transgenic and knock-in\nTanaka et al., 2007) clearly show that simply elevating the\nlevel of wild-type GFAP or expressing mutant GFAP leads\nto the formation of Rosenthal fibres. Astrocytes cultured\nfrom these mice exhibit decreased cell proliferation and\nincreased caspase activity (Cho and Messing, 2009). Similar\nobservations were made in transfected cell lines, where\nthe expression of mutant forms of GFAP causes extensive\nfilament aggregation, with caspase activation and GFAP\ncleavage (Chen et al., 2011). These findings are of interest\nbecause they represent some of the first indications of a\ndirect link between abnormal protein aggregation and GFAP\nproteolysis through caspase activation.\nCaspases are a family of cysteine proteases that specif-\nically cleave target proteins at sites next to aspartic acid\nresidues (Pop and Salvesen, 2009). Caspase cleavage of sev-\neral IF proteins, including nuclear lamins (Orth et al., 1996;\n2001), leads to the destruction of the nuclear envelope and\nthe disassembly of the cytoplasmic IF network that character-\nize apoptosis. Each of these IF proteins is cleaved by caspase 6\nat a consensus site in the L12 linker region of the rod domain,\nalthough cleavage by other caspases at additional sites also\noccurs (Marceau et al., 2007). Caspase 6 is an executioner\ncaspase based on its role in cleavage of nuclear structural\nment for activation by upstream initiator caspases (Boatright\nand Salvesen, 2003). Apart from its executive role, caspase\n6 can also cleave and activate other caspases (Slee et al.,\ntrigger for the activation of caspase 6 is not clear, emerging\ndata suggest a role for its activation in neurodegenerative\nconditions (Graham et al., 2011). Caspase 3 activation and\nGFAP cleavage contribute to the damaged astrocytes in AD\n(Alzheimer's disease) brain (Mouser et al., 2006). In addition,\na proteomic approach identified GFAP as a potential sub-\nstrate of caspase 6 in human primary neurons (Klaiman et al.,\n2008). Although GFAP is itself a caspase substrate, caspase-\nmediated cleavage of GFAP in astrocytes has not been fully\nexplored, and the assembly properties of the caspase cleavage\nproducts have not previously been addressed.\nHere, we report that GFAP is specifically cleaved by cas-\npase 6 in vitro. Mutagenesis analysis coupled with an in vitro\ncaspase cleavage assay confirmed that VELD225 in the L12\nlinker domain of GFAP is the major caspase cleavage site.\nCaspase cleavage of GFAP produces an N-terminal cleavage\nproduct (N-GFAP) that significantly perturbs in vitro filament\nassembly and affects normal filament assembly in a way that\npromotes inter-filament interactions. In addition, transient\ntransfection studies demonstrate that the overexpression of\nN-GFAP induces the formation of GFAP aggregates that also\ndisrupt the endogenous networks of intact GFAP in trans-\nfected human astrocytoma cells. Furthermore, a neo-epitope\nantiserum specific to N-GFAP reveals the presence of the\ncaspase-cleaved GFAP fragment in cells expressing disease-\ncausing mutant GFAP and in two types of AxD models that\nhave previously been shown to have varying levels of GFAP\naccumulation in different regions of the CNS (central ner-\nThese results imply that caspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP\ncorrelates with elevated GFAP in the context of GFAP mu-\ntation and accumulation. Moreover, we provide evidence to\nsuggest that caspase cleavage of GFAP has important func-\ntional consequences, decreasing GFAP filament solubility by\nchanging filament\u00adfilament interactions in a way that pro-\nmotes aggregation.\nPlasmid construction and site-directed\nmutagenesis\nMutant GFAP constructs with specifically altered amino\nacids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with\nfull-length human GFAP (GenBank accession no. J04569) in\nthe pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) as a template (Perng et al.,\n2006). All newly generated DNA constructs were verified\nby sequencing before use. To generate the amino-terminal\ncaspase-cleavage product (amino acids 1\u00ad225, designated\nN-GFAP), a translational stop codon right after the glutamic\nacid of the VELD225 sequence was introduced by site-directed\nand reverse primers, respectively. The C-terminal frag-\n(C-terminal GFAP)) was PCR-amplified from the human\nGFAP cDNA using the following oligonucleotides: 5 -CATAT-\nTCACATCCTTGTGC-3 . The amplified PCR product containing\nC-GFAP was cloned into the pJET cloning vector (Thermo\nScientific), and the sequence was confirmed by DNA\nsequencing.

The expressed proteins were further purified by ion-\nexchange chromatography using an AKTAprime plus system\n(GE Healthcare) equipped with a DEAE Sepharose column (GE\nHealthcare). Column fractions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE\nfollowed by Coomassie Blue staining, and those containing\npurified proteins were collected and stored at - 80C. Pro-\ntein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay\nKit (Thermo Scientific) with use of BSA as standard. Recom-\nbinant mouse GFAP (Ralton et al., 1994) and human vimentin\n(Perng et al., 2004) were purified as described previously.\nCaspase cleavage of GFAP in vitro\nPurified human recombinant GFAP (1 g) was diluted in cas-\n(w/v) CHAPS, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) and\n5% (v/v) glycerol) in the absence or presence of active re-\ncombinant human caspase 3 or caspase 6 (BioVision) at a final\nthe cleavage products were separated by SDS/PAGE, followed\nby Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. To determine\nthe caspase cleavage site in GFAP, caspase-cleaved GFAP was\nseparated by SDS/PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane\n(EMD Millipore), stained with Coomassie Blue and then sub-\njected directly to N-terminal sequencing (Mission Biotech).\nTo determine whether the D225E mutant GFAP was resis-\ntant to caspase cleavage in vitro, purified mutant GFAP was\nincubated with recombinant active caspase 6 and analyzed\nas above. The proteolytic activities of caspase 3 and caspase\n6 were confirmed using a structurally related IF protein, vi-\nmentin (Byun et al., 2001), as a positive control.\nIn vitro assembly and sedimentation assay\nPurified GFAP was diluted to 0.3 mg/ml in 6 M urea in a\nbuffer of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and\n1 mM DTT. Protein samples were dialyzed stepwise against\nthe same buffer containing 3 M urea for 6 h and then\nagainst the same buffer without urea at 4C overnight. Fila-\nment assembly was completed by dialyzing against assembly\n16 h at room temperature. The filament-forming efficiency\nwas assessed by high-speed sedimentation assay as described\npreviously (Nicholl and Quinlan, 1994). In brief, the assembly\nmixture was layered onto a cushion of 0.85 M sucrose in the\ntop micro-ultracentrifuge (Hitachi Koki Co.). To investigate\nthe extent of filament\u00adfilament interactions in the whole\nfilament population, samples were subjected to low-speed\ncentrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min at room temperature in a\nbenchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf). The supernatant and pellet\ndissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) in vol-\numes proportional to the original sample size were analyzed\nby SDS/PAGE and were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain-\ning. In some instances, the proportions of GFAP distributed\nbetween pellet and supernatant fractions were measured\nusing an image analyzer (ImageQuant 350, GE Healthcare).\nCoomassie Blue signals for individual bands were quantified\nusing the image analysis software (ImageQuant TL 7.0, GE\nHealthcare).\nElectron microscopy\nGFAP was diluted in assembly buffer to 0.1 mg/ml and\nwas negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Elec-\ntron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were spread on carbon-\ncoated copper grids (Ted Pella Inc.) and examined with\nan HT7700 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-\nTechnologies) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Images\nwere acquired using a CCD (charge-coupled-device) camera\nbefore being further processed in Adobe Photoshop CS II\n(Adobe Systems).

Im-\nmunoblotting analysis with two commercially available mon-\noclonal antibodies revealed that SMI21 antibody recognized\nthe p26 fragment (Figure 1B, lane 1), whilst the GA-5 an-\ntibody recognized the p24 fragment (Figure 1B, lane 2). As\nthe epitope of the GA-5 antibody resides in the tail domain\nfragment may correspond to the C-GFAP. SMI-21 antibody\ndetected the p26 fragment of N-terminally tagged GFAP\n(Myc-GFAP; Figure 1C). Attempts to sequence the amino ter-\nminus of N-GFAP by automated Edman degradation were\nunsuccessful, likely due to a blocked N-terminus as has been\ndemonstrated on desmin (Mavroidis et al., 2008). Neverthe-\nless, C-GFAP sequencing revealed 226VAKP in the amino ter-\nminus of this fragment, suggesting that VELD225 at the car-\nboxy end of N-GFAP is the caspase 6 cleavage site. This was\nconfirmed by substituting aspartate with glutamate (D225E)\nin the predicted recognition site. D225E GFAP was not cleaved\nby caspase 6 (Figure 1D). These data unambiguously demon-\nstrate that GFAP is cleaved specifically by caspase 6 at Asp225\nin its L12 linker domain in vitro (Figure 1E).\nAssembly properties of the caspase-generated\ncleavage products\nWe were then interested to know the assembly properties of\nN-GFAP and C-GFAP. Like other type III IF proteins, in vitro\nassembly of GFAP goes through several distinct and well-\ncharacterized stages (Herrmann and Aebi, 2004). The first\nstage is the formation of the ULFs (unit length filaments),\nwhich anneal end to end longitudinally and then compact\nradially to form the mature filament that is 10 nm wide\nand many microns long. Under standard assembly condi-\ntions, wild-type GFAP formed typical 10 nm filaments that\nwere many microns in length (Figure 2A). N-GFAP formed\nlarge aggregates (Figure 2B), which at higher magnification\ncould be seen to contain irregular filamentous structures\n(Figure 2B, inset). C-GFAP failed to self-assemble into fila-\nments but instead formed discrete particles approximately\nThe impact of both fragments upon the assembly of\nintact wild-type GFAP was also assessed. N-GFAP af-\nfected the assembly in a concentration dependent man-\nner (Figure 2D), whereas C-GFAP did not apparently\nchange the assembly or filament morphology of intact\ndid not dramatically alter the morphology of the as-\nsembled filaments (Supplementary Figure S1 available at\npared with those made from 100% intact GFAP (Figure 2A).\nIncreasing the proportion of N-GFAP to 25% produced fil-\naments that had a strong tendency to associate laterally\n(Figure 2D and inset). These data suggest that N-GFAP may\nintegrate into GFAP filaments, but at the expense of pro-\nmoting filament\u00adfilament interactions. Therefore, we per-\nformed a low-speed sedimentation assay to assess the ex-\ntent of filament\u00adfilament interactions in the whole filament\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nM-H Chen and others\nFigure 1 GFAP is specifically cleaved at Asp225 by caspase 6 in vitro\n(A) Purified recombinant human GFAP was either untreated (lane 1) or treated with 2.5 U of active caspase 6 (lane 2) for 1 h at 37C.

Indeed coassembly of C-GFAP\nwith intact GFAP, even at a 50%:50% ratio (Figure 2F, lane\n10) did not change the sedimentation characteristics of the\nassembled material.

The assembly products were negatively stained\nand visualized by electron microscopy. Intact GFAP assembled into typical 10-nm filaments (A), whereas N-GFAP formed irregular\nfilamentous structures (B, inset) that had a strong tendency to aggregate (B). C-GFAP failed to assemble into extended filaments but\ninstead formed discrete particles (C). When C-GFAP was coassembled with intact GFAP, the filaments formed were not dramatically\naltered in morphology (E) compared with those made from intact GFAP alone (A). In contrast, mixing N-GFAP in a 25%:75% ratio with\nintact GFAP resulted in the formation of filaments (D, inset) that had a strong tendency to aggregate (D).

Intact, N- and C-GFAP were assembled either alone or in combinations of intact GFAP with either N-GFAP or C-GFAP at a\n75%:25% ratio. Assembly products were subjected to low-speed centrifugation, and the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were\nanalyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the assembled intact GFAP remained in the supernatant fraction\n(lane 1), whereas N-GFAP was found mainly in the pellet fraction (lane 4).

We also examined the activation status of\ncaspase 6 and found active caspase 6 localized at sites of GFAP\naggregation (Figure 6, D\u00adF). Immunoblotting of cell extracts\nfrom R239H-transfected cells detected a cleavage product\nsimilar in size to N-GFAP in the pellet fraction (Figure 6G,\nlane 4). The D225 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate\nN-GFAP from a solubilized pellet fraction (Figure 6H). Ad-\ndition of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk to\ncells transiently transfected with R239H GFAP reduced the\nabundance of the N-GFAP fragment (Figure 6I). These data\nsuggest that R239H GFAP is susceptible to caspase cleavage\nin transiently transfected U343MG cells.\nAnalysis of GFAP expression and degradation in\nmouse models of AxD\nTotal protein lysates were prepared from different regions of\nthe CNS, including olfactory bulb, hippocampus and spinal\ncord from both wild-type (GFAP+ / + ) and GFAP+ /R236H mice\n(Hagemann et al., 2006) with mutation corresponding to the\nR239H mutation found in human AxD. Immunoblotting anal-\nyses using GA-5 and D225 antibodies showed that the N-\nGFAP was detected only in olfactory bulb (Figure 7A, lane 2)\nand hippocampus (Figure 7B, lane 2) of GFAP+ /R236H mice but\nnot wild-type controls (Figure 7A and B, lane 1,). In the spinal\ncord, however, the N-GFAP was detected in both wild-type\ntissue samples were fractionated into pellet and supernatant\nfractions, then N-GFAP was detected exclusively in the in-\nsoluble fractions of both the wild-type (Figure 7C, lane 5)\nantibody. These data confirm that the expression of GFAP\nvaries considerably between different regions of the CNS\n(Jany et al., 2013). Importantly, they also suggest that the\nexpression of R236H GFAP increases the caspase-mediated\ncleavage of GFAP.\nSimilar analyses of transgenic mice (GFAPTg) that consti-\ntutively overexpress human wild-type GFAP (Messing et al.,\n1998) revealed that caspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP was\na feature of this model too. The presence of the caspase-\nproduced N-GFAP was confirmed by immunoblotting anal-\nyses (Figure 8A). GFAP levels in GFAPTg mice were increased\nmarkedly with both the full length and GFAP degradation\nproducts being detected (Figure 8A, lane 2). Using GA-5 an-\ntibody, this marked increase in GFAP in both soluble and\ninsoluble fractions of GFAPTg mice (Figure 8A, lanes 4 and\n6) compared with wild-type controls (Figure 8A, lanes 3 and\n5) was confirmed. The D225 antibody detected N-GFAP in\nsamples from GFAPTg mice (Figure 8A, lane 2), but not from\nwild-type controls (Figure 8A, lane 1). As with the cell-based\nstudies, N-GFAP was detected mainly in the insoluble fraction\n(Figure 8A, lane 6) consistent with its segregation into cyto-\nplasmic aggregates.

Scale bars, 10 m.

Double-label\nimmunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocaliza-\ntion of the N-GFAP (Figure 9B) with the OA-collapsed GFAP\naggregates (Figure 9A, arrowhead) and filament bundles (Fig-\nure 9A, arrows), indicating that the presence of N-GFAP could\npotentially influence GFAP filament properties. To test this\nhypothesis, we assessed biochemically the solubility proper-\nties of wild-type and D225E GFAP in transfected MCF7 cells.\nUsing an extraction buffer containing deoxycholate (Perng\ntype and D225E GFAP could be extracted from transfected\ncells (Figure 9D, lanes 1 and 3). After OA treatment, the\nsolubility of D225E GFAP was not dramatically altered (Fig-\nure 9D, lanes 7 and 8) compared with untreated cells (Fig-\nure 9D, lanes 3 and 4), whereas wild-type GFAP, alone with\nits degradation products, was more resistant to extraction\n(Figure 9D, lane 6). Taken together, these data suggest that\ncaspase cleavage of GFAP is a functionally relevant prote-\nolytic event that can potentially alter the solubility of GFAP\nfilament.\nDISCUSSION\nCaspases play an essential role during apoptotic cell death.\nThese enzymes define a class of cysteine-aspartic acid\nproteases that posttranslationally modify their substrates\nthrough cleavage at a specific aspartic acid residue. Although\ncaspase cleavage of several IF proteins, including the nu-\nclear lamins, keratins, vimentin and desmin (Marceau et al.,\n2007), has been well documented, relatively few studies on\ncaspase-mediated proteolysis of GFAP have been reported.\nEvidence for the proteolytic cleavage of GFAP by caspase\n6 was provided by a recent study in human primary neu-\nrons (Klaiman et al., 2008), where a simple proteomic ap-\nproach identified three potential caspase 6 cleavage sites in\ncleavage of GFAP at these sites has not been confirmed. In\nthis study, we performed an in-depth characterization of\ncaspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP via the use of a caspase\ncleavage site-specific antibody, which we characterized and\nvalidated. We show here that GFAP is cleaved selectively by\ncaspase 6 at a conserved Asp225 residue in its L12 linker do-\nmain in vitro. Caspase cleavage of GFAP at this site generated\nan N-terminal fragment that dramatically alters filament as-\nsembly both in vitro and in transfected cells, and does so in\na dominant manner. The truncated protein can also disturb\nendogenous network of intact GFAP. In addition, we demon-\nstrate the presence of N-GFAP in transfected cells expressing\nAxD-causing mutants and in two types of AxD models carry-\ning either mutant GFAP or overexpressing human wild-type\nGFAP, suggesting that GFAP mutation and elevated expres-\nsion correlate with caspase-mediated GFAP proteolysis. Fi-\nnally, we provide evidence to show that caspase cleavage of\nGFAP has a functional impact on GFAP filament properties.\nOur data differ from those reported by Mouser et al.,\n2006, who used a site-directed antibody to caspase-cleaved\nGFAP to demonstrate that GFAP is cleaved at DLTD266, a\nunique caspase cleavage site that is found only in GFAP\nand not in other IF proteins. A caspase cleavage product-\nspecific antibody strongly stained degenerating astrocytes\nin AD brain and colocalized with an antibody specific to\nactive caspase 3, providing evidence that the caspase-\nmediated cleavage of GFAP; activation of apoptotic path-\nways, and degeneration of astrocytes might be linked. In\nour in vitro cleavage assay, however, GFAP was resistant\nto caspase 3 cleavage (Supplementary Figure S6 available\nspite efficient cleavage by caspase 6. The inefficient cleavage\nof GFAP by caspase 3 may be explained by the fact that\nDLTD266 is part of a heptad repeat in the -helical 2B sub-\ndomain, which is buried within the coiled-coil dimer making\nit inaccessible for cleavage. Another possible explanation is\nthat our use of active caspase 3 utilized a concentration\nthat was insufficient for in vitro activity. This is supported\nby the previous findings that caspase 6 can cleave its sub-\nstrates at low doses, whereas caspase 3 is able to generate the\n302 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGFAP proteolysis in Alexander disease models\nFigure 6 Caspase sensitivity of AxD-causing GFAP mutant\nU343MG cells transiently transfected with R239H GFAP were fixed at 48 h after transfection.

In addition to caspase and calpain, ubiquitin protea-\nsome system is also involved in the proteolysis of GFAP, which\nregulates the turnover of the glial filaments (Tang et al., 2006;\nTang et al., 2010). The signals, if any, that target GFAP for\ndifferent degradation pathways and the significance of these\nproteolytic events have yet to be determined. Understand-\ning the significance and regulation of GFAP proteolysis is\nimportant from a cell-biological standpoint and may also\nhave pathophysiological relevance to degenerative disorders\nin which cytoskeletal defects result from GFAP proteolysis.\nStructural consequences of caspase-mediated\nGFAP proteolysis\nLike other IF family members, GFAP has a characteristic tri-\npartite domain structure consisting of a central -helical rod\ndomain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. While\nthe head domain of GFAP is essential for normal filament\nassembly (Quinlan et al., 1989), the tail domain plays an\nimportant role in controlling filament width in vitro (Quin-\nproper IF networks in vivo (Chen and Liem, 1994). Our in vitro\nstudies demonstrate that C-GFAP lacking the head and coil\n1 domains completely abolished its filament-forming abil-\nity, producing soluble complexes that remained in a discrete\noligomeric state under all conditions tested. In contrast, N-\nGFAP missing the coil 2 and tail domains formed structures\nthat were irregular in diameter and aggregation prone. These\ndata suggest that while the N-terminal half of GFAP is essen-\ntial for filament elongation, the C-terminal half is involved\nin controlling filament width and inter-filament interactions.\nPrevious studies on type III IF proteins proposed that the C-\nterminal tail domain associates intramolecularly with the C-\nterminal end of the rod domain (Kouklis et al., 1991), which\nform a surface-exposed loop structure that prevents inap-\npropriate subunit interactions in the assembly process and\nregulates filament thickness. This offers an explanation of the\naltered width of filaments assembled from truncated forms\nand the changed in vitro assembly characteristics of N-GFAP\nwe report here.\nThis study parallels recent studies on a similarly truncated\ndesmin, which contains the first 264 amino acids of desmin\n(N-desmin). Both N-GFAP and N-desmin have a strong ten-\ndency to aggregate in vitro (Bar et al., 2009) and in trans-\nfected cells (Chen et al., 2003), and both appear to func-\ntion as potent disruptors of IF assembly. These findings are\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nM-H Chen and others\nconsistent with the observations that a similar N-terminal\nvimentin fragment comprising the head and conserved 1A\ndomains interferes with normal filament assembly in a\ndominant-negative fashion (Kural et al., 2007; Chang et al.,\nFunctional consequences of caspase-mediated\nGFAP proteolysis\nIFs fulfill dual roles in apoptosis by modulating events\nupstream of caspase activation, providing resistance\nto apoptosis initiation and by enhancing downstream\ncaspase-mediated proteolysis to facilitate the execution of\ncell death (Marceau et al., 2007). Although several IF proteins,\nincluding keratin (Yoneda et al., 2004) and nestin (Sahlgren\net al., 2006), exhibit anti-apoptotic properties, caspase cleav-\nage of IF proteins could also generate pro-apoptotic frag-\nments that amplify cell death signals (Byun et al., 2001).\nOur data show that caspase cleavage of GFAP generated two\nmajor proteolytic fragments, but neither of these fragments\nsignificantly induced apoptotic cell death when transiently\noverexpressed in either MCF7 or U343MG cells. These findings\nare in agreement with those of Chen et al., 2003, who demon-\nstrated that cultured myoblasts transiently transfected with\na similarly truncated desmin encoding amino acids 1\u00ad263\nwere still viable at 72 h, despite the presence of extensive\naggregates. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that\nthe presence of caspase cleavage products sensitizes cells to\nthe induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress (Cho and Mess-\nresults argue against a direct pro-apoptotic function for ei-\nther GFAP cleavage product. The general question that then\nconfronts us is how caspase cleavage could influence the\nfunctional properties of GFAP filaments.\nOur cellular models show that wild-type GFAP is more\nresistant to extraction compared with non-cleavable D225E\nmutant in OA-stressed MCF7 cells. The resistance of wild-\ntype GFAP to extraction is likely due to the altered filament\nproperties induced by the presence of caspase-cleaved GFAP\nfragment. In vitro studies provide additional evidence to sup-\nport the role of caspase-produced GFAP fragment in promot-\ning aggregate formation. These combined data suggest that\ncaspase cleavage of GFAP has important functional conse-\nquences, decreasing GFAP solubility by changing filament-\nfilament interactions in a manner that encourages aggrega-\ntion. There are several other ways to modulate GFAP filament\nfunctional properties in astrocytes. They include phosphory-\nlation (Sihag et al., 2007), the association of IF-associated\nproteins such as B-crystallin (Koyama and Goldman, 1999;\nPerng et al., 1999), and the incorporation of other IF proteins,\nsuch as vimentin and nestin (Herrmann and Aebi, 2000). The\nproteolytic GFAP fragment produced on caspase cleavage\nprovides a complementary mechanism that could potentially\nalter GFAP filament organization and filament properties in\nastrocytes.\nAlbee Messing, Roy Quinlan and Ming-Der Perng designed\nthe study; Mei-Hsuan Chen, Tracy Hagemann and Ming-Der\nPerng performed the experiments; Mei-Hsuan Chen, Tracy\nHagemann and Ming-Der Perng analyzed the data; Ming-\nDer Perng wrote the paper.\n"
