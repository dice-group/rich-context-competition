    "reduced_content": "The decision to develop rotavirus vaccines was predicated on the extensive burden of rotavirus\ndisease among children worldwide. US reports on nationwide hospitalizations (1979-1992) and\nwere reviewed to estimate the burden of rotavirus disease, identify epidemiologic trends, and consider\nmethods for evaluating an immunization program when a vaccine becomes available. From 1968\nThis decline was associated with the disappearance of winter peaks for diarrhea-related deaths\nhowever, hospitalizations for diarrhea averaged 186,000/year and retained their winter peaks, which\nhospitalized for diarrhea, but < 40 die with rotavirus. A rotavirus vaccine program will require\nimproved surveillance, including the timely collection of data from sentinel hospitals, in which a\ndiagnosis of rotavirus can be established or ruled out for all children hospitalized for diarrhea.\nThe need for a rotavirus vaccine for children in developing\ncountries has long been evidenced by the tremendous burden\nof rotavirus diarrhea [1, 2]. Many epidemiologic studies have\ndocumented the high prevalence of severe rotavirus diarrhea\namong children in developing countries, accounting for, on\naverage, one-third ofall hospitalizations for diarrhea worldwide\nto 25% of all diarrheal deaths and 6% of all deaths in children\n<5 years old. In 1985, similar information about diarrheal\ndisease was not available for developed countries, so the Insti-\ntute of Medicine, in reviewing new vaccine priorities for devel-\noped countries, concluded that a rotavirus vaccine was not a\npriority for the United States [4]. The decision was based on\nthe results ofa prospective study ofthe incidence ofhospitaliza-\ntions for rotavirus diarrhea in a birth cohort of 126 children\nfollowed for 2 years [5] and not on hospital-based studies that\nhad already documented that one-third of children admitted\nfor diarrhea have rotavirus infection [6]. While most rotavirus\ndiarrhea in American children is mild, nearly every child is\ninfected in the first 2- 3 years of life, and a percentage of these\nepisodes are severe enough to warrant a visit to a doctor or\nhospitalization. By 1985, death, the most severe outcome of\nrotavirus infection, had not been documented in a child in the\nUnited States; better data were needed to quantify the more\nsevere and costly outcomes of rotavirus.\nReprints or correspondence: Dr. Roger Glass, Viral Gastroenteritis Section\n\u00a9 1996 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.\nIn 1987 in response to this challenge, we began a systematic\nstudy of the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in the United\nStates. The study was based largely upon mortality and hospi-\ntalization data that were freely available and in the public do-\nmain [7, 8]. Data also included some from the Rotavirus Sur-\nveillance Network, an initial group of 88 North American\nlaboratories that were recruited to voluntarily report rotavirus\ndetections on a weekly basis to the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) [9]. Our original goals were to under-\nstand the epidemiology of rotavirus in the prevaccine era, to\nexamine the disease burden of rotavirus diarrhea, and to iden-\ntify an indicator(s) of the disease in the epidemiologic data\nthat were available. For hospitalizations and deaths, the task\nwas a challenge, because no code from the ninth revision of\nthe International Classification of Diseases (lCD-9) existed for\nrotavirus; we had to work with a collection of nonspecific\ncodes for diarrhea (e.g., diarrhea, presumed noninfectious) and\nidentify epidemiologic patterns that would specifically define\nrotavirus disease. Besides providing retrospective information\non diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths in the United States,\nwe felt that this survey would help define methods to assess\nthe disease burden of rotavirus in other countries and to gain\nexperience with the feasibility ofdifferent surveillance methods\nto monitor the impact of a rotavirus vaccine program when\nsuch a program was implemented.\nThis paper reviews studies done primarily by the CDC that\nlaid the groundwork for our appreciation that rotavirus diarrhea\nis an important cause of disease leading to hospitalization of\nchildren in the United States. As a result of these studies and\nothers, we now have national measures of both morbidity and\nmortality to estimate the disease burden of rotavirus diarrhea.\nThese data have been used to calculate the cost-effectiveness\nof a rotavirus vaccine program, identify unusual epidemiologic\nfeatures of rotavirus, such as the west-to-east dissemination\npattern of the disease, and document that the peak of winter\ndeaths in the United States attributed to rotavirus has declined\nin recent years. From these activities, we have further identified\nareas where improved surveillance could provide timely data\nto assess the impact of an intervention program with vaccines.\nMethods and Findings\nBackground. To estimate the disease burden of rotavirus\ndiarrhea, we quantified all clinically severe diarrheal events\n(i.e., deaths, hospitalizations, and doctor visits) and tried to\nidentify, on the basis of our understanding of the epidemiology\nof the disease, those events that might be due to rotavirus. We\nturned to two national sources of data available from the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, CDC), the multiple\ncause-of-death data [10] and the National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey (NHDS) data [11], and to data on the laboratory surveil-\nlance of rotavirus that is linked with the National Enteric and\nRespiratory Surveillance System [12]. Since no codes in the\nICD-9 or ICD-9-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were\navailable for rotavirus diarrhea before 1993, we had to use a\ncollection of codes for diarrhea, even though we knew that\n>90% ofdiarrheal events, even those leading to hospitalization\nor death, are coded without an etiologic diagnosis [13, 14].\nFor analysis of diarrhea mortality, we included reports of\ndeaths that had diarrhea coded anywhere on the NCHS death\nrecord. For analysis of hospitalizations, we included records in\nwhich codes for diarrhea were listed in the first three positions\non the discharge record. Previous experience had shown us\nthat diarrhea would be listed as the first code on the record for\n73% of the hospitalizations and as the third code for 95% [15].\nUse of records with diarrhea recorded only as the first cause of\nhospitalization seemed restrictive, since dehydration, a related\ndiagnosis, was often reported as the first cause of hospitaliza-\ntion, and limiting diarrheal diagnosis to the top three positions\nwould exclude only 5% of key events that might be secondary\nto the true cause of hospitalization.\nNHDS data. Information on hospital discharges has proven\nto be the most robust, sensitive, and important data available\nto monitor rotavirus activity in the United States. Events re-\nported in these discharge reports are costly (>$1000/day) and\nnumerous, and our experience indicates that they not only re-\nflect the level of rotavirus activity but reveal epidemiologic\ntrends that were previously unrecognized [7]. Earlier etiologic\nstudies ofchildren hospitalized for diarrhea in the United States\nsuggested that hospital discharge would be a strong predictor\nof rotavirus activity: rotavirus-related diarrhea was the most\ncommon cause of hospitalization for diarrhea among children\n<5 years (~30%), rotavirus activity was highly seasonal (win-\nter months), and rotavirus diarrhea was limited to children\nThe first rotavirus studies by Ho et al. [7, 8] used NHDS\ndiarrhea, most of which were nonspecific, to look for national\ntrends in diarrheal hospitalizations by age, time, and geographic\nregion that might reflect rotavirus activity. The NHDS data\nrepresent a systematic sample of patient discharges obtained\nfrom hospitalized short-stay non-federal general and specialty\nhospitals in the United States [18a]. To look more carefully at\nage, geographic, and seasonal trends that required a larger data\nset, Ho and colleagues [8] examined hospital discharge data\nfrom the McDonnell-Douglas Automated Data Information\nSystems, which represented a 16% nonsystematic sample of\nall hospitalizations in the United States [7]. Results from the\ntwo surveys were comparable, and the larger data set only\nhelped to decrease the confidence limits of the smaller data\neach year for diarrhea, representing ~9.5% of all hospitaliza-\ntions among children of this age group. These hospitalizations\npeaked from November through April, and these peaks ofactiv-\nity were primarily among children 3-35 months of age. More-\nover, the peak ofthis activity began in the Southwest in Novem-\nber and moved across the United States, ending in the Northeast\nin March and April. A 5-year national survey of the detection\nof rotavirus by 88 US laboratories was done by LeBaron et al.\n[9]. This study confirmed that the peak of rotavirus detections\nfollowed the same geographic and temporal patterns as hospi-\ntalizations and deaths for diarrhea and suggested that the winter\nseasonal peaks of hospitalizations for diarrhea were due to\nrotavirus.\nSince the original rotavirus study (Ho et al. [7]) ended with\ndischarge data were available, to see if hospitalizationfor diarrhea,\nparticularly in the winter, remains a problem (figure lA). After\nreviewing information on 16,049 hospitalizations, representing a\nweighted total of 2.6 million discharges (i.e., annual average of\n186,000 hospitalizations for diarrhea/year), their findings were\ncomparable to those of Ho et al. [7] and others. While the annual\nnumber of diarrheal hospitalizations decreased by 13% over time,\nthe winter seasonal peaks remained constant, and the geographic\nand temporal appearance of these peaks-first in the Southwest\nand later in the Northeast-was unchanged. Jin et a1. [19] found\nthat the winter peak for diarrheal diseases coded as \"viral\" (19%\nofthe total and many ofwhich are presumed to be due to rotavirus)\nwas mimicked by the larger number of diarrheal diseases that\nwere presumed to be noninfections (71% of the total) and by the\ntotal group of diarrheal episodes, suggesting that these groups\nshared a common etiology. Only the small number (5%) of diar-\nrheal episodes caused by bacteria had a different seasonal pattern.\nIn the absence of hard data on laboratory-confirmed cases of\nrotavirus diarrhea, we developed two distinct and independent\nmethods to estimate the proportion of hospitalizations that\nmight be attributable to rotavirus [19, 21].

Summer was defined as the 6-month period without\nrotavirus activity (May-October); winter included the months\nNovember-April. Since the summer baseline would include\nbacterial diarrheas not present in the winter, we felt this esti-\nmate would be conservative, possibly underestimating the per-\ncentage of the excess peak due to rotavirus. The excess was\ngreatest during the month ofJanuary and was least in November\nand April, representing the geographic hospitalization peaks in\nthe Southwest and the Northeast, respectively.\nThe second method, rate standardization estimate, was\nderived by multiplying the month-specific rate of rotavirus\ndetection among children hospitalized for diarrhea over an\n8-year period in Washington, DC, by the monthly rates of\ndiarrheal hospitalization in the United States over the 14-\nyear period taken from the discharge survey [6, 19]. While\nother hospital-based surveillance studies have been done,\nthis study is the largest, and the data are reported by month,\nallowing proper standardization of rates. Furthermore,\nthese rates do not differ greatly from those of other smaller\nhospital-based studies. When these two estimates were\ncompared, they yielded time curves that were synchronous\nand numeric predictions of the same magnitude-about\nNational mortality data. Since no child in the United States\nhad ever been reported to have died with a diagnosis of rotavi-\nrus diarrhea, many pediatricians have felt that it is never severe\nor fatal. A review ofnational mortality data, initially for 1972-\nbut indirect evidence that rotavirus has been a cause of death\nin American children (figure 1B) [8,20]. The NCHS's multiple\ncause-of-death data were examined to extract diarrheal deaths\nwith a variety of ICD codes from the adapted ICD-8 (1968-\n(>90%) had no etiologic diagnosis, and since no ICD code\nwas available for rotavirus during this study period, none of\nthe deaths could be attributed directly to rotavirus.\nNonetheless, the analysis of data for 14,137 deaths due to\ninsight into the role that rotavirus diarrhea may playas a cause\nof death in American children [20]. In the United States, the\nnumber of deaths due to diarrhea has declined continuously\npeak that was most marked among children 3- 24 months old,\nepidemiologic characteristics similar to those observed for chil-\ndren hospitalized for diarrhea. An unexpected finding of this\nstudy was that this peak showed the same geographic and\ntemporal trend as hospitalizations and laboratory detections of\nrotavirus beginning in the Southwest in November and ending\nin the Northeast in March-April. Most (78%) of these deaths\nwere in children < 1 year old. Diarrhea appeared to be the\nlikely cause of death, since other diagnoses were most often\nproblems ofelectrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and other com-\nplications of diarrhea.\nwith a marked dampening of the winter peaks for diarrheal\ndisease. Since 1985, an excess of winter deaths associated with\ndiarrhea is still evident in children 3- 23 months old, but it is\nmuch less prominent than before. Ho et al. [8] originally attrib-\nuted the excess of winter versus summer deaths due to diarrhea\nto rotavirus and determined they represented 75- 125 deaths/\nyear [8]. According to data for the most recent years for which\nWe hypothesized that this decline in winter deaths attribut-\nable to rotavirus could be due either to a decrease in the overall\nincidence ofsevere diarrhea in winter or to improvements in the\ncase management of diarrhea or access to care. The unchanged\nnumber of winter hospitalizations indicates that the decline in\ndeaths must be due to other factors, such as improved case\nmanagement or access to care.\nNational laboratory surveillance. All data described so far\nhave been independent of a specific diagnosis of rotavirus. The\nobservation that the peak of winter hospitalizations and deaths\nmoved from the Southwest in November toward the Northeast in\nMarch-April led us to establish the Rotavirus SurveillanceActiv-\nprospectively to the present [9, 12, 23]. The 5-year retrospective\nsurvey confirmed for the first time the unusual geographic and\ntemporal trends of rotavirus detections, which represent unique\nepidemiologic indicators for the disease. The fact that this pattern\noccurs in a repeated fashion undermines simple explanations that\ntemperature or humidity caused the seasonal peaks of rotavirus.\nThe alternativehypothesis, that individual strains were migrating,\nwas also dismissed when Gouvea et al. [24] found multiple strains\nemerging in different parts ofthe United Statesin the same season\nand when strains from the same city in different seasons were\noften similar,suggesting a common local reservoir. Similar obser-\nvations were made by Matson et al. [25].\nNational reporting of rotavirus detections from 74 labora-\ntories in the United States has been ongoing since the original\nsurvey by LeBaron et al. [9]. The national surveillance has\nidentified summer peaks ofrotavirus activity that, when investi-\ngated, were found to be due to poor laboratory practices (i.e.,\n>6 different technicians doing the test) and to the use of a\ncommercial test that was sold without proper controls [23].\nWhile reporting is weekly and on a voluntary basis, much\ninformation that would be important for evaluating an interven-\ntion program is not now collected. For instance, the laboratories\ndo not record the patient's age or underlying illness or whether\npatients were hospitalized or seen as outpatients or whether\nthe infection was acquired in the community or in the hospital.\nIn addition, specimens are not submitted, so there can be no\nassessment of rotavirus strains currently in circulation.\nTable 1.

Most direct medical costs were for hospitalizations. Amounts are millions of dollars.\nEstimates ofdisease burden. A major goal of these epide-\nmiologic studies has been to quantify the role played by rotavi-\nrus as a cause of diarrhea among children in the United States.\nEarly longitudinal studies and recent placebo-controlled field\ntrials have indicated that if surveillance is conducted actively\nwith two or more home visits per week, the incidence ofrotavi-\nrus diarrhea may reach 0.30 episodes/childlyear during the first\n2 years of life, with a cumulative incidence approaching 0.80\nepisodes in a child reaching age 5 [5, 26-28]. Doctor visits\nare less frequent (,...., 1/8 children) by age 5, but the national\nrobust and has the greatest margin of error [29]. On the basis\nof NCHS hospitalization data for all diagnoses of diarrhea, we\nestimate that 1 in 25 children will be hospitalized for diarrhea\nduring the first 5 years of life (as determined by the estimate\nmonths old in a birth cohort of 4 million children followed for\n5 years). About 1 in 73 infants will be hospitalized for rotavirus\ndiarrhea, as determined using our estimate of 55,000 hospital-\nprobably represent a subgroup of children with underlying ill-\nnesses or conditions, such as prematurity [20].\nThese data on the national disease burden of rotavirus diar-\nrhea must be placed in context of the other estimates that have\nbeen made (table 1). First, the Institute of Medicine in 1985\nestimated the number ofhospitalizations for rotavirus at 23,000\nper year by extrapolating data from a longitudinal study of 126\nchildren to the total population of children in the United States\ntions/year by using the approach described in this paper with\n[17] used data for rotavirus hospitalizations at Texas Children's\nHospital to prepare broader estimates of 110,000 hospitaliza-\ntions/year, one-third of which were associated with nosocomial\nrelated hospitalizations/year by updating the figures of Ho et\nal. with newer information on the growth of the birth cohort\nover the intervening decade. The current figure is most similar\nto that of Ho et aI., and the decrease in the total number of\nhospitalizations reflects a 13% decline in the incidence of all\nhospitalizations for diarrhea over the past decade.\nSurveillance of laboratory strains. A number of surveys\nhave been done to examine rotavirus strains collected in the\nized by the outer capsid proteins that are important for virus\nneutralization: glycoprotein (G protein) encoded by gene seg-\nment 7, 8, or 9 and the protease-cleaved protein (P protein)\nencoded by gene segment 4. The surveys indicate that only 4\nstrains are commonly circulating-P[8], Gl, P[4], G2, P[8],\nG3, and P[R], <T4-although some unusual strains have been\ndocumented on rare occasions and confirmed when both G and\nP typing have been done [31, 33, 34]. Strains appear to have\na local reservoir, since the same strains are found from year\nto year in the same location. Rotavirus infects older children\nand adults routinely, and one might expect periodic outbreaks\nwith illness in older children or adults if strains with major\nantigenic differences were to emerge. Clearly, surveillance of\nlaboratory strains will have to continue, with specific emphasis\non the identification of new circulating strains and examination\nof their prevalence in the population.\nDiscussion\nIn the prevaccine era, the purpose of surveillance has been\nlimited to describing trends in rotavirus activity and obtaining\nbetter estimates of the burden of rotavirus disease. Using na-\ntional data for hospitalizations and deaths and additional infor-\nmation from laboratory surveillance, we have been able to infer\nthat the winter peaks ofhospitalizations for diarrhea and deaths\nin children 3- 23 months of age that appear first in the South-\nwest in November and move to the Northeast by March- April\nare attributable to rotavirus. This finding has permitted us to\nestimate the magnitude ofthe disease burden ofrotavirus hospi-\nStates and assess the annual cost of this burden (> 1 billion\ndollars) while identifying unusual seasonal and geographic pat-\nterns that represent a unique epidemiologic indicator of this\ndisease. When we first examined diarrhea mortality in Ameri-\ncan children through the year 1983, we were surprised to find\nhundreds of deaths were occurring each year and that they had\na seasonal and geographic pattern consistent with rotavirus\ndisease. Since 1985, the total number of deaths due to diarrhea\nhas leveled off at --300/year, and the annual winter peak of\nexcess deaths in children 3- 23 months of age attributable to\nrotavirus has nearly disappeared. The observation that these\nwinter deaths have decreased while hospitalizations have con-\ntinued (i.e., an improved death-to-hospitalization ratio) is con-\nsistent with the hypothesis that these improvements are due\neither to better access to care or improved treatment ofchildren\nwith severe rotavirus diarrhea. Ofnote, this suspected improve-\nment in rotavirus mortality does not markedly alter the cost-\neffectiveness results since most of the medical costs in the\nanalysis are due to hospitalizations [30]. The number of hospi-\ntalizations has declined only slightly over the past 14 years,\nand the winter seasonal peak in children 3-35 months of age\nremains a distinguishing feature.\nA key epidemiologic feature ofrotavirus disease, which was\nidentified in our initial analyses of deaths and hospitalizations\nand later confirmed in the surveillance of laboratory detection\nof rotavirus, is the movement of the rotavirus season in time\nand place, starting in the Southwest in November and moving\nto the Northeast in March- April. This movement indicates that\nneither temperature nor humidity alone can explain the trend.\nLaboratory studies suggest that each community may have its\nown local reservoir of strains, since there is not a single epi-\ndemic strain, and we have no credible hypothesis to explain\nthis unique trend.\nSurveillance of laboratory detections of rotavirus infections\nhas provided information on rotavirus activity in the United\nStates that is inexpensive (voluntary reporting) and timely\n(weekly reporting); however, it has not provided additional\ninformation that could be of considerable epidemiologic use-\nfulness (e.g., a breakdown of infections by patient age or status\n[inpatient vs. outpatient] or whether the infection was commu-\nnity- or nosocomially acquired). As we move closer to consid-\nering implementation of a rotavirus vaccine program, sentinel\nsurveillance will have to be established using indicator hospi-\ntals, laboratory-confirmed illness, and patients who are specifi-\ncally hospitalized for diarrhea, preferably at centers with a\ndefined population base. While laboratories are willing to vol-\nuntarily report detections ofrotavirus infections, the large-scale\ncollection and handling of rotavirus specimens for study of\nstrain variation or the emergence of unusual serotypes will\nrequire a larger infusion of resources. In the interim, smaller\nsurveys have confirmed that the 4 main serotypes found in\nrepeated studies globally are also predominant in the United\nStates.\nThe determination ofdisease burden is fraught with potential\nbias due to assumptions in estimating prevalence rates for ro-\ntavirus disease. Weare confident that our estimates of the\nnumber of hospitalizations due to rotavirus infections are rea-\nsonable: They were determined by two completely different\nand independent approaches, yet the estimates are nearly identi-\ncal. They are midway between the initial low estimates of the\nInstitute of Medicine [4] and the highest estimates of Matson\net al. [17] and within 15% of similar estimates we derived 8\nyears ago [21], and they are based on true hospitalization fig-\nures rather than estimates using hospitalization rates adjusted\nfor the increasing population of children <5 years old [30].\nThey represent our best estimate made with an absence of data\non hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed rotavirus diarrhea\nrather than a precise determination. Better data from longitudi-\nnal studies would require that large cohorts of children\n(> 10,000) be followed because the frequency of hospitaliza-\ntions is relatively low (estimated at 1/73 children). Since a new\nICD code for rotavirus diarrhea was designated in 1993 and\nwill be included in the 10th revision of the lCD, it is likely\nthat in the near future we may begin having direct reports of\nboth hospitalizations and deaths due to rotavirus diarrhea.\nThe approach to surveillance that uses national or sentinel\ndata on hospital discharges and deaths and has identified sea-\nsonal and age trends for diarrheal illnesses, provided estimates\nof rotavirus prevalence, and proved to be a simple and eco-\nnomic method to address the epidemiology and assess the dis-\nease burden of rotavirus diarrhea in the prevaccine era. The\nmethod should be applicable in other countries that might con-\nsider the use of a rotavirus vaccine and could provide informa-\ntion critical to making national decisions and establishing na-\ntional priorities [35]. At the same time, NHDSs provide data\nwith a 3-year delay and without information on 1aboratory-\nconfirmed cases. In view of the impending licensure of vac-\ncines, a different approach to surveillance will be required that\nwill permit evaluation of the effectiveness of an immunization\nprogram. This will require more intense surveillance in which\nsentinel hospitals provide in-depth information on patients hos-\npitalized for rotavirus diarrhea confirmed by laboratory detec-\ntion. Such sentinel hospital surveillance in larger-scale catch-\nment trials and on a regional or national basis will be critical\nto monitor a decline in winter hospitalizations for diarrhea,\nwhich would be anticipated after the introduction ofa rotavirus\nvaccine program. At the same time, increased surveillance of\nstrains will be essential to determine if some new serotypes\nescape vaccination and become predominant.\n"
