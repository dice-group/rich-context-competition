Electrophilic compounds have been shown to be activators of these transcription-mediated\nresponses through S-alkylation of specific regulatory proteins. Previously, we reported that a prototype compound (D1, a\nsmall molecule representing a proelectrophilic, para-hydroquinone species) exhibited neuroprotective action by activating\nboth of these pathways. We hypothesized that the para-hydroquinone moiety was critical for this activation because it\nenhanced transcription of these neuroprotective pathways to a greater degree than that of the corresponding ortho-hydro-\nquinone isomer. This notion was based on the differential oxidation potentials of the isomers for the transformation of the\nhydroquinone to the active, electrophilic quinone species. Here, to further test this hypothesis, we synthesized a pair of para-\nand ortho-hydroquinone-based proelectrophilic compounds and measured their redox potentials using analytical cyclic\nvoltammetry. The redox potential was then compared with functional biological activity, and the para-hydroquinones demon-\nstrated a superior neuroprotective profile.\n",

Perturbation of this homeostatic redox balance is\nthought to significantly contribute to various disorders,\nincluding Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Hara\nRecently, considerable attention has focused on electro-\nphilic and proelectrophilic drugs (PEDs) as well as their\nrelated analogues because of their ability to activate cel-\nlular defense systems (Satoh et al., 2006; Calabrese et al.,\nPEDs such as carnosic acid (CA; Figure 1) are natural\nproducts found in herbs such as rosemary and sage\nIn addition, related natural product-inspired hydroqui-\nnone-based synthetic compounds (i.e., D1 and D3;\nFigure 2) have recently been reported by our team and\nwere shown to be bioactive (Satoh et al., 2011).\n1Sanford-Burnham Neuroscience and Aging Research Center, La Jolla, CA,\nUSA\n2Department of Anti-Aging Food Research, School of Bioscience and\nBiotechnology, Tokyo University of Technology, Hachiouji, Japan\n3Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute at Lake Nona, Orlando, FL,\nUSA\nCorresponding Author:\nTakumi Satoh, Sanford-Burnham Neuroscience and Aging Research Center,\nEmail: satotkm@stf.teu.ac.jp\nASN Neuro\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nasn.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission\nprovided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nImportantly, CA and D1 (Figure 1), examples of PEDs,\nthemselves are not electrophilic until they are activated at\na site of tissue injury undergoing oxidative stress (Satoh\nPED activation under conditions of oxidative stress\noccurs because quinone formation is influenced by the\ncellular redox state, and in particular the Cu2\u00fe/Cu\u00fe\nFigure 1.

The present study highlights compounds D1 (a) and D3 (b).\nCA (d) was evaluated as a neuroprotective compound in prior studies and is used here as a reference compound (Satoh et al., 2008a,\n2008b). The compound notated as D2 (c) served as an inactive negative control for D1 in previous studies (Satoh et al., 2011). Note that\nD1 and D2 are para-hydroquinone isomers, while D3 and the natural product CA are ortho-hydroquinone isomers. CA \u00bc carnosic acid.\nFigure 2.

Upon oxidation, the compounds adopt the oxidized quinone forms\nin a two-electron process. Both para- and ortho-hydroquinones are converted to electrophilic quinones, but the meta-hydroquinone isomer\nis not converted. Para- and ortho-hydroquinones, but not meta-hydroquinone, can activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway (Satoh and Lipton,\n2 ASN Neuro\nThe redox-active transition metal copper can catalyze\noxidative activation of a number of phenolic compounds\nvia Cu2\u00fe/Cu\u00fe cycling (Bensasson et al., 2008; Satoh et al.,\nconditions, PED hydroquinones are very slowly oxidized\nto the quinone form, whereas this rate is greatly increased\nin the presence of Cu2\u00fe/Cu\u00fe recycling (Wang et al., 2010;\nSatoh et al., 2013). In addition, after conversion to the\nactive form, PEDs display superiority to classical antioxi-\ndant molecules because of their sustained action and\namplification via the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived\n2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heat-shock factor-1 (HSF-1) tran-\nscription-mediated signaling pathways (Satoh et al.,\n2013). These dynamic processes afford the potential for\ngenerating a pathologically activated therapeutic (or\nhave also shown that several PEDs display an excellent\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity,\nand pharmacokinetic profile in the central nervous\nsystem, making them strong drug candidates (Satoh\nFirst, we focused on the Kelch-like ECH-associated\nprotein 1 (Keap1)/Nrf2 pathway as one of the targets\n2013). After conversion to electrophilic quinones, PEDs\nactivate the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway (Satoh and Lipton,\nis possible to take advantage of this intracellular mech-\nanism of electrophilic activation to develop a novel strat-\negy for drug development against neurodegenerative\ndiseases. As an illustration, CA activates the Nrf2 tran-\nscriptional pathway and protects various cells and organs\nagainst redox stress (Takahashi et al., 2009; Kosaka et al.,\nYanagitai et al., 2012). We have developed a potential\nstrategy for clinical translation of this work based on\nthe following chemical principles (Satoh and Lipton,\n1. Novel PEDs and related analogues are better tolerated\nthan electrophiles, in part because electrophilic com-\npounds can deplete glutathione in healthy, unstressed\n2. PEDs combat the oxidative stress that converts them to\nelectrophiles through activation of the Nrf2 pathway\nSecond, we focused on the heat-shock protein\n(HSP)90/HSF-1 pathway as one of the targets of PEDs\nZhang et al., 2011), provides cell protection through acti-\nvation of endogenous gene networks involved in antioxi-\ndant response element (ARE) defense (Satoh and Lipton,\nreaction with Keap1 also covalently bind to cysteine resi-\ndues of HSP90 to activate HSF-1 and other HSPs (Satoh\nand heat-shock factor response elements (HSE), respect-\nively, to provide neuroprotection against oxidative and\nnitrosative insults (Satoh et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,\n2011). Thus, S-alkylation of critical cysteine residues by\nelectrophilic compounds can activate both of these tran-\nscriptional pathways, representing what has been called\nan electrophilic counterattack response (Satoh et al.,\nto protect themselves from redox insults can be easily\noverwhelmed, such backup systems are important\nhomeostatic regulation processes that insure the continu-\nation of normal neuronal signaling (Satoh et al., 2006;\nSatoh et al., 2013). D1 is a novel proelectrophilic com-\npound that activates both the Nrf2 and HSF-1 pathways\nand can thus protect against both oxidative and endo-\nplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Satoh et al., 2011; Zhang\nImportantly, potential clinical relevance for the use of\nPEDs in vivo has been obtained in models of age-related\nmacular degeneration (AMD; Rezaie et al., 2012; Satoh\net al., 2013) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke; Satoh\net al., 2008b). While antioxidants were generally believed\nto have some effect in preventing AMD, their actions are\nRamkumar et al., 2010). The use of antioxidants is not\nvery effective because tissue penetrance is not reliable and\noften the action is not sustained. Similarly, while tissue\nplasminogen activator can dissolve clots, no effective neu-\nroprotective treatment has been proven for stroke\nimportantly, the novel PEDs, such as D1 described in this\narticle, increase the chances of producing clinically toler-\nated therapeutics because they are only changed to the\nactive state by oxidative insult at the site of impending\nBased on these inherent attributes and the potential\nclinical relevance of PEDs, we investigated their effects\non various types of cell lines. For example, because of the\npotential involvement of oxidative stress in AMD, we\nused the human apical retinal pigment epithelial cell\nMandel et al., 2009). Because of the potential involve-\nment of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease, vascular\ndementia, and stroke, we used the mouse hippocampal\nSatoh et al. 3\nNakamura and Lipton, 2009). Glutamate may be directly\ntoxic to cultured neuronal cells via two different processes\nmediated by glutamate receptors. The second pathway is\nactivated by a reduction in intracellular glutathione\nlevels, leading to an imbalance in the homeostasis of\nthe cell's redox state (Tan et al., 1998; Sagara et al.,\n2002). This second pathway can be blocked by the add-\nition of antioxidants. In particular, glutamate toxicity of\nHT22 cells has been used to model oxidative stress-\ninduced cell death in hippocampal neurons (Tan et al.,\nThe objective of this study was to determine which\nisomer (para- vs. ortho-hydroquinone) could provide max-\nimal activation of the Nrf2/ARE and HSF-1/HSE path-\nways. We sought to combine chemical and biological\nperspectives on this issue to define the best chemical struc-\nture of an electrophilic core for use as a PED. To test the\npara-hydroquinone electrophilic core of D1 versus an iso-\nmeric ortho-analogue, we synthesized compound D3 (the\northo-hydroquinone variant of D1) having the same chem-\nical scaffold (Figure 1). We then compared the para- and\northo-forms in terms of chemical and biological actions by\nmonitoring oxidation potential, transcriptional activa-\ntion, induction of phase 2 enzymes and HSPs, as well as\nprotection against oxidative and ER stress.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals and Antibodies\nAntibodies and reagents were obtained as follows: anti-\nheme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) polyclonal rabbit IgG\n(OSA-150, Assay Design, Ann Arbor, MI), anti-\nNADPH quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) polyclonal\nrabbit IgG (2618-1, Epitomics, Cambridge, MA), anti-\nRockland, Pottstown, PA), IRDye 800CW goat anti-\nrabbit (green fluorescent; LI-COR, Lincolon, NE,\nanti-mouse (red fluorescent; LI-COR, Lincolon, NE,\ndimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium glutamate, fluores-\ncein diacetate (FDA), hydrogen peroxide (HP), tunica-\nmycin (TM), and Hoechst 33 258 stain were obtained\nfrom Sigma (St Louis, MO). The chemical synthesis of\nD1 has been described previously (Satoh et al., 2011).\nSynthesis of analogues D1 and D3 are described later.\nGeneral Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds,\nTo a 20-ml microwave vial was added methyl 10-bromo-\ndecanoate (1.0 equiv.) and triphenylphosphine (2.0\nequiv.). The mixture was placed under an argon\natmosphere and subjected to heating via microwave\nirradiation at 100C for 45 min. The resulting mixture\nwas then cooled to room temperature, followed by add-\nition of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF; 10 ml) and\nmild heating and vortexing until a solution was formed.\nTo the resulting phosphonium salt solution was then\nadded 1.0 M sodium bis-trimethylsilylamide (1.0 equiv.)\ndropwise over a 1-min period. This mixture was stirred at\n0C in an ice/brine bath for 45 min followed by addition\nof the corresponding ortho- or para-dimethoxybenzalde-\nhydes (1.48 M in THF). The reaction was allowed to pro-\nceed, with stirring, at room temperature over 16 hr. The\nreaction product was then concentrated and reconstituted\nwhich the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was\nextracted with EtOAc (3 \u00c2 8 ml) and combined with the\norganic layer, and the mixture was then dried over\n. The product was subsequently filtered, concen-\ntrated, and subjected to SiO2\nflash column chromatog-\nraphy (Biotage SP4 system, Uppsala, Sweden) using 5%\nto 18% EtOAc to afford the olefinic esters as a colorless\noils (46%\u00ad68%). These intermediates were used directly\nin the next step.\nTo a 5-ml round-bottom flask containing the mixed\nolefinic ester intermediates was added anhydrous metha-\nequiv.). The reaction was placed under a hydrogen\natmosphere and stirred vigorously for 16 hr. After such\ntime, the mixture was filtered through a plug of celite/\nand concentrated to yield the crude aliphatic ester\nin quantitative yield. To the crude ester were added equal\namounts of THF and 2 M LiOH(aq)\nsolution (4 equiv.),\nand this mixture was then stirred at 40C overnight. The\nreaction product was concentrated, dissolved in EtOAc,\nand then acidified (to pH 1\u00ad2) via addition of 1 N HCl.\nThe layers were separated, and the acidic aqueous layer\nwas extracted three times with EtOAc. The combined\nextracts were dried over Na2\n, filtered through a\nsolid phase extraction cartridge, and concentrated\nto yield the crude acids affording colorless oils. The oils\nwere diluted through addition of anhydrous CH2\nand\ncooled to \u00c078C in a dry ice/acetone bath. To this solu-\ntion was added 1 M BBr3\n, and this\nmixture was allowed to gradually return to room tem-\nperature over a period of 4 hr. Thereafter, the tempera-\nture was reduced to 0C. The reaction was quenched with\ndeionized water and extracted three times with EtOAc.\nThe combined extracts were dried over Na2\n, filtered\nover celite, and concentrated. The crude product was dis-\nsolved in methanol and subjected to purification via pre-\nparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using\nmass-directed fractionation. Combined fractions were\nconcentrated using a Biotage V-10 evaporation system\nto afford compounds D1 or D3 as white/off-white solids\n(20%\u00ad35% isolated yield over three steps).\n4 ASN Neuro\nCompound D1. 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR;\nmass spectrometry calculated m/z for C17\n[M-H]\u00c0\u00bc\nCompound D3. 1H NMR (500 MHz, deuterated methanol,\n26.4.

All substrates were pre-\npared as 1 mM solutions in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium\nperchlorate in anhydrous acetonitrile and degassed under\nargon for 10 min prior to and between CV scans. Anodic\nand cathodic potentials were recorded after at least 10\ncycles to insure reproducibility, except for resorcinol,\nwhich was recorded for the first cycle due to rapid current\ndecrease upon subsequent cycles (Nasr et al., 2005;\nAstudillo et al., 2007; Nematollahi and Mohammadi-\nCell Culture (ARPE-19 Cells)\nTo study the biochemistry and molecular biology of oxi-\ndative stress in retina, several investigators have used\nin vitro culture of ARPE-19 cells. For example, exposure\nof ARPE-19 cells to HP is known to induce apoptosis and\nhas thus been used as an in vitro model of retinal degen-\neration triggered by oxidative stress (Satoh et al., 2011).\nThe cells were maintained in 10-cm dishes containing\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supple-\nmented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were intro-\ncells/cm2 and incubated for 24 hr. The medium was then\nchanged to serum-free medium containing the designated\nconcentrations of the test compounds, and the cultures\nwere incubated for 24 hr. Then, HP or TM was added,\nand the cells were incubated for 4 hr or 24 hr, respectively.\nFinally, the cells were stained with FDA (1 mM) and\nmicroscopy.\nReverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\nFor reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-\nPCR) analysis, total RNA was obtained by use of\nTRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) from\nARPE-19 cells that had been incubated with vehicle\n(DMSO), D1 (5 mM), or D3 (5 mM) in serum-free\nexposed to Superscript III (Invitrogen) in the presence\nof RNasin (20 U), random hexamers (2.5 mM), dNTPs,\nand the supplied reverse transcription buffer. The reac-\nvolume of 1/100th of this mixture from each source was\nthen subjected to PCR conducted with the appropriate\nprimer sets. At completion of the PCR, 10 ml of the PCR\nproducts were mixed with 2 ml of loading buffer, and this\nmixture was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel in the\npresence of 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The amplified\nDNA fragments were visualized with UV detection.\nRT-PCR analysis was performed as described previ-\nwith the following primers (number of PCR cycles and\nsize of PCR product in parentheses):\n50-TTG CCA ATG GTG ATG ACC TG-30 (R) for b-actin\nWestern Blot Analysis\nARPE-19 cells were incubated for 24 hr with vehicle\n(M-PER mammalian protein extract reagent, catalog\nSatoh et al. 5\n#78503, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented\nwith a protease inhibition cocktail (Complete Protease\nRoche, Waltham, MA). Total cell lysates (10 mg each)\nwere separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinyli-\ndene fluoride membranes. HO-1, NQO1, HSP70, and gly-\nceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were\ndetected with specific antibodies, and the signals were\ndetected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibo-\ndies. The protein signals were enhanced by use of a\nchemiluminescence assay (ECL Western blotting;\nAmersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).\nLuciferase Assay\nWe used pGL-GSTYa ARE core-luciferase (Satoh et al.,\nassessment of transcriptional activation via ARE and\nHSE, respectively. ARPE-19 cells were seeded at a dens-\ntaining 1 mg of plasmid DNA plus Lipofectamine 2000\n(Invitrogen), and then incubated for 5 hr in PBS contain-\n(Invitrogen). The cells were then washed in PBS and incu-\nD3 (5 or 10 mM). Firefly luciferase activity in cell lysates\nwas measured with a luminometer for reporter gene\nassays (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency\nwas normalized to b-galactosidase activity assessed by co-\ntransfection with pSV-b-gal (Promega). For reporter gene\nassays, cells were transfected with 1 mg of the reporter\nconstruct (pGL-GSTYa ARE core-luciferase or ptK-\nhHSP70-luc) and 0.2 mg pSV-b-gal for 1 hr. Cells were\nthen washed in PBS and incubated in serum-free culture\nor D3 (5 or 10 mM). Firefly luciferase activity and b-galac-\ntosidase activity in cell lysates were measured by using a\nluciferase system and b-galactosidase enzyme assay\nsystem, respectively (Promega).\nCulture of HT22 Cells\nMouse hippocampal HT22 cells were maintained in\n10-cm dishes containing DMEM supplemented with\nserum-containing DMEM. One hour after seeding, the\ncultures were incubated for 1 hr with vehicle (DMSO)\nor various concentrations of D1 or D3. One hour later,\nthe cells were exposed to 5 mM glutamate for 24 hr to\ninduce oxidative damage. Subsequently, viability of the\nHT22 cells was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-\n2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction,\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity detection kit\n(TAKARA, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), which quantitatively\nmeasures the release of LDH into the medium following\ncell lysis or cell death. This assay was used as described by\nthe manufacturer.\nStatistical Analysis\nResults are presented as the mean \u00c6 SD. Analysis of vari-\nance with an appropriate post hoc test was performed for\nmultiple comparisons and a Student's t test for compari-\nson of two samples. A p value .05 was considered\nsignificant.\nResults\nRedox State of Compounds\nThe redox behavior of D1 and D3 was analyzed using CV\nin solution. Their voltammograms were compared with\nthat of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol), 1,3-dihydroxy-\nbenzene (resorcinol) and 1,4-dihydroxybenzene (hydro-\nquinone), which were measured as control compounds\nAstudillo et al., 2007; Nematollahi and Mohammadi-\nBehzad, 2009). The CVs of catechol and hydroquinone\nwere recorded in the\u00c00.5 V to 1.5 V potential range\nversus Ag/AgCl, where one anodic peak (oxidation to\nquinone form) and one cathodic peak (reduction back\nto the hydrogenated form) are observed. Table 1 sum-\nmarizes the potential values for all compounds. Redox\nprocesses in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in\nacetonitrile electrolyte are not reversible because the\nanodic and cathodic peaks are separated by over\n600 mV. This was expected and consistent with values\nreported in the literature for these substrates/electrolyte\ncombinations, and in particular hydroquinone is\nTable 1.

To con-\nfirm this notion, we performed luciferase assays in\nARPE-19 cells transfected with plasmid DNAs under\nthe transcriptional control of the ARE or HSE\n(Figure 3). D1 (5 mM) significantly activated both tran-\nscriptional elements, indicating that D1 can stimulate\nboth the ARE and HSE systems. In contrast, the ortho-\nisomer D3 (5 mM) activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway to a\nlesser extent than that of the para-isomer. At 10 mM,\nD1 was still more potent than D3. D3 at 10 mM but not\n5 mM activated the HSE transcriptional element. These\nobservations are consistent with the notion that\nthe para-isomer (D1) activates the Keap1/Nrf2 and\nFigure 3. Transcriptional activation of ARE and HSE. Retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells were plated at 1 \u00c2 105 cells/cm2, incubated\nfor 24 hr, and then transfected with DNAs (ARE- or HSE-luciferase construct). After a 5-hr incubation in serum-containing medium, the\nmedium was changed to serum-free medium containing vehicle (DMSO) versus D1 or D3 (5 mM or 10 mM). Cell lysates were obtained after\n24 hr incubation and subjected to the luciferase assay. Values are the mean \u00c6 SD; *p <.05.

The previous\nDNA microarray study showed that compound D1\ninduced expression of HSPs in addition to phase 2\nenzymes. Incubation with D1 resulted in activation of\nNrf2 and HSF-1 transcriptional elements, thus inducing\nphase 2 enzymes and HSPs, respectively (Satoh et al.,\n2011). In this manner, D1 protected neuronal cells from\nboth oxidative and ER-related stress. First, in this article,\nto compare the induction of the genes encoding phase 2\nenzymes and HSPs by 5 mM D1 and D3, we performed an\nRT-PCR analysis using primers for the ho-1 and nqo1\nD1 significantly induced each of these genes, although\nthe magnitude of induction varied from gene to gene.\nInduction by D3 was significantly weaker than that by\nD1. Next, we confirmed the induction of HO-1, NQO1,\nand HSP70 at the protein level by performing immuno-\nblot analysis (Figure 4(b)). D1 induced HO-1 in a dose-\ndependent manner, whereas D3 did so only weakly, as\nconfirmed by quantitative analysis (Figure 4(c)). While\nD1 and D3 induced the expression of NQO1 and\nHSP70 proteins, the basal levels of expression were\nalready high in this cell line. Taken together, these data\nsuggest that D1 induced both phase 2 enzymes and HSPs\nboth more potently and efficaciously than D3.\nProtective Effects in ARPE-19 Cells\nAn important biological attribute of PEDs is that they\noffer protection from oxidative stress (Satoh and Lipton,\nFigure 4.

Hence, we tested if the addition of D1 could pro-\ntect ARPE cells from ER stress elicited by 3 mM TM. As\nshown in Figure 5(c) and (d), exposure to TM (3 mM)\ninduced cell death, but D1 (2-5 mM) provided significant\nprotection.

We performed both the MTT assay for cell sur-\nvival and LDH release assay for cell death. D1 signifi-\ncantly protected cells against oxidative glutamate\ntoxicity, whereas D3 was less potent, as assessed by\nMTT assay (Figure 6(a)). Again, ortho-D3 was about\ntwofold less potent than para-D1. These protective effects\nwere confirmed by the LDH release assay (Figure 6(b)).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we compared the chemical and bio-\nlogical effects of ortho- and para-PEDs in providing neu-\nroprotective activity. We performed a series of\nbiochemical experiments, measuring oxidation potential,\ntranscriptional activation, induction of phase 2 enzymes\nand HSPs, and neuroprotection, to compare the com-\npounds D1 and D3, which share similar chemical struc-\ntures except that they are para- and ortho-hydroquinones,\nrespectively. The para-electrophilic compound D1 acti-\nvated neuroprotective signaling pathways to a greater\ndegree than the ortho-compound D3. These results are\nconsistent with our CV experiments showing that the\nsequence of oxidation potential modulation for theses\nisomers is para (hydroquinone) > ortho (catechol) > >\nmeta (resorcinol) as shown in Table 1. We\nconsistently found that the oxidation potential for\nthe para-hydroquinone D1 was lower than that of the\northo-hydroquinone D3 (Figure 2). Overall, the para-\ncompound exhibited at least a twofold increase in the\npotency of neuroprotection over the ortho-compound.\nWhether this improvement will be reflected when para-\nversus ortho- compounds are compared in in vivo disease\nmodels remains to be determined in future studies.\nIn terms of developing clinically tolerated drugs, we\nsought to learn principles from other recent ventures in\nsuccessful central nervous system drug development.\nAlong these lines, our development of the FDA-approved\ndrug memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor\nantagonist, was in part based on the principle that\ndrugs should interact with their target only during\nstates of pathological hyperactivation and not during\n2007). Drugs that have been developed using this strategy\nare designated PAT drugs. PEDs are candidate PAT\ndrugs because conversion to the active quinone form is\nredox-controlled and thus enhanced by the very oxidative\nstress that these drugs then counteract (Satoh and Lipton,\ntheir druggability, published work has shown that these\nPEDs can translocate into the retina and brain of mice\nand rats at levels sufficient to protect against significant\nFigure 6.

Moreover, the\nmeasured electrochemical oxidation potentials of these\nPEDs can be used to predict their activation of protective\npathways. The differential ability of PEDs to activate the\ntranscription factors in these pathways is inversely corre-\nlated to their potential for oxidation from the hydroquin-\none to the quinone form (Figure 7). Importantly, the\nredox state of the cells also affects the ability to transform\nPEDs to their active quinone form. The Cu2\u00fe/Cu\u00fe redox\nsystem regulates oxidative reaction from hydroquinone to\nsystem is highly influenced by the availability of electron\nacceptors in the cell; under pathological conditions, such\nelectron acceptors are represented by reactive oxygen spe-\ndependent regulation of quinone formation dictates that\nPEDs, such as CA and D1, are PATs in the sense that\nthey are converted from the hydroquinone to the quinone\nby the very reactive oxygen species that they then combat\nAccordingly, activated PEDs S-alkylate critical cysteine\nresidues on KEAP1 and HSP90, leading to activation of\nthe transcription factors Nrf2 and HSF-1, respectively\nthus represents a novel strategy against neurodegenera-\ntive disorders, providing disease-modifying electrophilic\ndrugs in the context of pathological insult.\nFor many years, the herb rosemary has been reported\nto manifest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.\nWe have previously shown that CA, present in rosemary\nextract, crosses the blood\u00adbrain barrier to exert neuro-\nprotective effects by upregulating endogenous antioxi-\ndant enzymes via the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway\nand neuroprotective activities in retinal cell lines exposed\nto oxidative stress and in a rat in vivo model of light-\ninduced retinal degeneration suggest that PEDs, such as\nD1 and CA, may potentially have clinical application to\nretinal diseases, including AMD and retinitis pigmentosa,\nin which oxidative stress is thought to contribute to dis-\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that para-hydro-\nquinones are both more potent and efficacious than their\northo-hydroquinone homologues in terms of transcrip-\ntional activation, induction of phase 2 enzymes and\nHSPs, and neuroprotective effects against oxidative and\nER stress. Nonetheless, other factors that determine\ndruggability, such as pharmacokinetics, bioavailability,\nstability, metabolism, and translocation into the brain,\nwill also be important in determining which structures\nare most effective in vivo. Critically, however, this is the\nfirst report to our knowledge to demonstrate that pos-\nitional isomers of proelectrophilic hydroquinones are an\nimportant determinant in the activation of Nrf2- and HSF-\n1-mediated stress responses, and the disparate effect of\nthese isomers is closely tied to their oxidation potentials.\n"
