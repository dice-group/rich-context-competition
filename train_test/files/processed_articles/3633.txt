CSE is the exchange of the sexual services of a\nchild for commodities, where in England and Wales a child is someone aged 17 years or\nunder (DCSF, 2009). Commodities may be tangible, such as cigarettes or money, or\nintangible, such as affection, and are given either directly to the victim or to a third-party\nfacilitator. CSE involves asymmetrical power relationships, whereby the victim's emo-\ntional, mental or physical immaturity or socioeconomic disadvantage is exploited (Chase\nand Statham, 2005). Alongside the immediate trauma of abuse, CSE has been linked to\nmental, emotional and behavioural difficulties, including truancy, substance abuse,\napathy, aggressive outbursts and self-harm (CEOP, 2011). In 2011, the issue of CSE\nCorresponding author:\nElla Cockbain, Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London, London,\nEmail: eleanor.cockbain.09@ucl.ac.uk\nResearch note\nreceived attention in the British press and began to feature on public and policy agendas\nin the guise of `on-street grooming' or `localised grooming'. Internationally, there has\nbeen increased impetus to tackle CSE (Chase and Statham, 2005), including proposals\nfor new European directives and joint initiatives aimed at improving knowledge and\nresponses (Skidmore, 2004).1 Despite anecdotal evidence linking CSE to youth offend-\ning, there has been little attempt at empirical research into the interaction between the\ntwo phenomena. The limited international body of literature into the overlap between\nCSE and youth offending has focused narrowly on links with juvenile sex offending\nYouth offending is the commission of crimes by individuals between the legal age of\ncriminal responsibility and the age of maturity: in England, this means 10\u00ad17 year olds.\nAlthough youth crime has attracted considerable interest, research efforts have been\nimpeded by data-collection and recording issues (Halsey and White, 2008). The most recent\nannual statistics for England and Wales present a total of 198,449 offences committed by\nhave been estimated at \u00a34 billion (YCC, 2010). To help combat youth offending, a `com-\nprehensive review' of associated risk factors was published in 2005 by the Youth Justice\nBoard (YJB, 2005).Among a list of 20 broad-based risk factors, including local availability\nof drugs, school disorganisation and insufficient parental supervision, mentions of child\nabuse, CSE included, were notably absent. Nonetheless, increased recognition of the links\nbetween child abuse in general and youth offending has resulted in a series of studies that\ntogether demonstrate a `strong correlation' between the two issues (Day et al., 2008: 6).\nThis Research Note presents findings from a preliminary empirical study, one of the first\nto explore the relationship between CSE and youth offending. CSE victims are, in research\nterms, a hard-to-reach group and this study capitalised on rare access to detailed data. From\nthe outset, three limitations are acknowledged. First, recorded offences and CSE referrals\nwere used as proxies for actual offending and exploitation respectively, because data on the\ntrue rates are not available. Both proxies will underestimate the true incidence and preva-\nlence of the phenomena they represent. Second, the findings are based on data from one UK\ncity only. Further replication is necessary to establish their external validity. We see little\nreason, however, why the relationship between the two variables of interest should be very\ndifferent here than elsewhere in the UK. Finally, the data sets for the study do not align per-\nfectly. Victimisation data span the eight-year period between the CSE service's inception in\n2003 up to and including 2010. In order to capture more of the offences committed by vic-\ntims referred in the service's early years, youth offending data were also collected for the\npreceding two-year period: in total the years 2001\u00ad10 inclusive were covered. The Youth\nOffending Service deals with children between the ages of 10 and 17 years of age; therefore\ntheir records typically cover a maximum period of eight years for any child.2 The mean\nperiod covered for these subjects was high at 6.9 years (SD = 1.5). Nonetheless, for some\nsubjects offences may be missing if committed before or after the study period or in a differ-\nent area. The latter may be particularly likely for CSE victims, whose abuse can increase\ntheir transiency and who appear to be overrepresented in the care system (Barnardo's, 2012).\nNotwithstanding these concerns, our findings are valuable in stimulating research\nand debate in this little-explored area. A better understanding of how CSE and youth\noffending interact could have important implications for policy and practice at national\nand international levels.\nMethod\nThe study drew upon two major data sources from Derby, a city in the East Midlands\nSafe and Sound Derby, the UK's largest specialist CSE service provider. This local\nservice handles all CSE referrals in Derby. The other was provided by Derby City Youth\nOffending Team (YOT), the authority responsible for all offences committed by under-\n18 year olds resident in Derby.\nThe children referred to Safe and Sound Derby between its inception in 2003 until\n2010 inclusive constituted the `exploited sample', SE\ndatabase contained details of all youth offenders active in the period 2001\u00ad10: the\n`offending sample', SO\n(N = 7404). We cross-referenced these two databases to establish\nthose children who had both exploitation and offending histories. They constituted the\ncore study sample, SS\n(N = 211). Full offending histories were retrieved from Derby City\nYOT for all members of SS\n. A limited number of detailed case files for SS\nmade available by Safe and Sound Derby to provide qualitative depth. These will be\nmentioned in the discussion section but were not subject to empirical analysis owing to\nconcerns around representativeness.\nThe data were analysed to establish offending rates among the exploited children, the\ngender of offenders, the extent and type of their recorded offending, their age at first\nrecorded offence and their age at referral to Safe and Sound Derby. When relevant, this\nwas done relative to the characteristics of SE\nor SO\nas a whole. A typology of offences\nwas established by coding individual crimes and grouping them according to similar\ncharacteristics. When available, the closest comparable national data were used to aid the\ninterpretation of the results.\nResults\nOffending rates\nOnly half of all crimes against property and the person are reported and only 3 percent\nresult in a caution or conviction (Home Office, 1995). In light of these figures, the new-\nest available, it is worrying that 38.2 percent of the CSE victim sample, SE\n, had offend-\ning records. Ideally this figure would be compared with the proportion of the Derby\nyouth population who have offending records, to test our prediction that 38.2 percent is\na far higher prevalence rate than would be found in the general population. Unfortunately,\nsuch baseline data are not available either for Derby or for the UK as a whole. Although\nnot directly comparable, it is perhaps worth noting that only 25 percent of those between\n10 and 25 years of age in England and Wales admitted to committing an offence(s) the\nGender\nSS\nimbalance is largely a function of the composition of SE\nfemale. In fact, male CSE victims were significantly more likely to offend than their female\ncounterparts: 55 percent of male victims had offending histories, compared with 35 per-\ncent of females.Achi-square test showed males to be significantly overrepresented among\nthe SS\ngroup relative to the gender composition of SE\n) were recorded on Derby City\nrepresent 2.8 percent of the overall Derby\nyouth offending population in 2001\u00ad10. Almost 8 percent of all female youth offenders\nrecorded in Derby belonged to SE\n, as did 1 percent of males.\nExtent of offending\nwere recorded as having committed a total of 1586 offences.\nDespite constituting just 2.8 percent of youth offenders in Derby in 2001\u00ad10, they were\nresponsible for 5.1 percent of all 31,349 youth offences recorded over this period. Figure 1\nshows the distribution of offences among the group. The mean number of recorded\noffences per male was 12.8 (SD = 13.3), just over double the mean per female of 5.8 (SD\n= 7.6). High standard deviations belie the variation between the extent of individual\noffending records. An unpaired t-test found gender to have a highly significant effect on\nWhereas the modal number of offences recorded for both males and females was one,\nover two-thirds (69.2 percent, N = 166) had two or more offences on record. Of these\nchildren, 21.1 percent (N = 35) were recorded as committing multiple offences on a\nsingle occasion but were not caught on any subsequent occasion. The government's\ndefinition of a juvenile re-offence is the commission of a further crime within one year\nhad re-offending histories: this was a fifth higher than the average rates for England and\nWe split the study sample, SS\n, into three groups, based on their level of recorded offend-\ning activity. Table 1 shows the definition of each category and its size in absolute terms\nand relative to the whole sample. It also includes the gender composition of each group\nand the proportion of all recorded offences for which its members were responsible.\nThese results indicate that a quarter of the children, the `prolific offenders', were\nresponsible for almost three-quarters of the offences recorded. The most prolific male\nand female offenders of all had 53 and 37 offences on record, respectively. Boys were\nmore likely to belong to the frequent and prolific offending groups than girls, and over\nhalf of the males in SS\nwere prolific offenders. Although not statistically significant for\nfrequent offending, this gender effect was highly significant for prolific offending (2\nAge at first offence\nThe age at first recorded offence ranged from 9 to 17;4 the distribution is shown in\nFigure 2. The mean age for male offenders was over a year younger than for females:\nTests showed this gender effect to be highly significant (t = 4.2, df = 209, p < .001).\nFigure 1. Distribution of number of recorded offences for SS\n.\nFigure 2 demonstrates a clear peak in first recorded offences for males between 12 and\n14 years of age and for females between 13 and 14 years of age. By their fourteenth\nbirthday, almost half of SS\n(N = 104) had one or more offences on record. By their fif-\nteenth birthday this figure stood at almost three-quarters (N = 167). When the variation\nin gender composition of the occasional, frequent and prolific offending groups was\ncontrolled for, group differences between mean age at first recorded offence disappeared.\nSelf-report survey data indicate that English and Welsh children typically commit their\nfirst offence at 11 or 12 years of age (YJB, 2010). These figures relate, however, to actual\noffending rather than recorded offences, the proxy used here. Only a small proportion of\noffenders are caught and, for those who are, the time lag between real first offence and\nfirst recorded offence remains unknown. Consequently, it is impossible to establish how\nthe age at first offence for SS\ncompares with national figures for all young offenders.\nAge at referral\nThe mean age at referral to Safe and Sound Derby was 14 years 9 months (SD = 18\nmonths).5 Figure 3 shows the distribution of referrals. When compared with the distribu-\ntion of age at first recorded offence in Figure 2, a clear lag is evident between recorded\noffending and referral at group level.\n(N = 58) had already been referred to Safe and Sound Derby\nby the time of their first arrest. Referrals pre-dating arrest occurred an average of 4\nmonths before the first arrest (SD = 11 months). In contrast, the time lag was greater for\nreferrals post-dating arrest; these happened an average of 1 year and 5 months later\n(SD = 15 months). Proportionately, females were more likely to be referred prior to arrest\nreflect the fact that disclosure and detection rates are believed to be particularly low for\nmale victims of CSE (Lilywhite and Skidmore, 2006).\nTable 1.

Distribution of age at referral for SE\n.\nTypology of offences\nOver 50 distinct criminal offences were recorded against members of SS\n, ranging from\nhoax 999 calls to arson to false imprisonment. An analysis based on individual crimes\nwould have presented a fragmented, hard-to-interpret picture of the offending behaviour.\nInstead, offences were analysed and grouped by shared characteristics; this enabled a\ntypology of five mutually exclusive categories to be developed. Categories were labelled\naccording to their defining characteristic and presumed primary function: aggression;\nacquisition; non-compliance; escapism; and sexual deviance. Table 2 presents an over-\nview of each category and its contribution to the overall crime picture.\nAggression was the most common category, accounting for more than one-third of all\nrecorded offences. Despite prior research's focus on links between child sexual abuse\nand juvenile sex offending, sexual offences were the least common category. They con-\ntributed just 1 percent of all recorded crimes, in line with rates of sexual offences among\nrecorded youth crime in England and Wales in general (MoJ, 2011a).\nDiscussion\nThese findings emphasise that greater attention should be paid to links between CSE and\nyouth offending, although the exact nature of the relationship remains unclear. With 40\npercent of identified CSE victims implicated in offending behaviour, an appreciation of\nthe impact of youth offending on exploitation and vice versa should inform responses to\nboth issues. Much CSE is believed to go unreported and undetected (Jago et al., 2011),\nso the relatively low identification rate of CSE among known offenders may under-rep-\nresent the true scale of the issue. The early age of onset for recorded offending and the\nhigh recidivism rates among CSE victims were particularly concerning. Prior research\nhas identified persistent offenders who begin offending from an early age to be an\nTable 2.

Consequently, this\nstudy's findings indicate that investment in prevention and early intervention may be not\nonly more ethical but more cost-effective.\nGender proved an important determinant of offending: compared with their female\ncounterparts, male CSE victims were more likely to be apprehended, were apprehended\nfor more offences and were first apprehended at an earlier age. Yet CSE victims consti-\ntuted a much lower proportion of Derby's total male youth offending population than\nthey did the female. Together, these results suggest that the relationship between CSE\nand youth offending should not be reduced to a single-gender issue, but that gender dif-\nferences should be considered when planning research and interventions.\nCrimes of aggression, escapism and acquisition may all be linked to common behav-\nioural and psychosocial disturbances associated with CSE, such as angry outbursts,\nerratic behaviour and substance abuse (CEOP, 2011). Nonetheless, there may be other\nexplanations for the offending patterns observed and at this stage care should be taken\nnot to extrapolate far beyond the results. It can more reliably be asserted that the low sex\noffending rate and the diversity of the offending behaviour emphasise that the associa-\ntions of CSE go far beyond a narrow focus on sex offences. Crimes of non-compliance\nsuch as breaches of order, although ostensibly mundane, may be an important indicator\nof poor relationships with the criminal justice system, which may in turn affect victims'\npropensity to formally disclose CSE. A history of mistrust and antagonism towards the\npolice may act as strong deterrents against reporting abuse, something upon which more\ncalculating CSE perpetrators might be able to capitalise.\nReplication is needed to understand consistency and variation between patterns in CSE\nand youth offending at the national level and the extent to which these findings are com-\nmon to other European countries. When doing so, it is important to recognise how the\nquality of local CSE interventions can affect results. Early attempts to map CSE across the\nUK suggest that high local prevalence rates may simply reflect a better-established\nresponse to the issue (CEOP, 2011; Jago et al., 2011). Derby, although a small city, has\nbeen recognised as an example of best practice nationwide (CEOP, 2011). The study high-\nlighted some further frustrations in investigating the overlap between two independently\ncomplex issues such as CSE and youth offending. The study was a localised one focusing\non a limited area, and without clear and consistent baselines it was difficult to interpret\nresults. Yet, even with a data set of hundreds of exploited offenders, rather than thousands,\ndata deficiencies precluded attempts to establish chains of temporal precedence.\nThe results show that CSE victims are typically recognised as offenders before they are\nrecognised as victims. Yet, without data on typical time lags both from first actual offence to\nfirst apprehension and from first instance of CSE to first referral, it is difficult to judge\nwhether offending really pre-dates exploitation. CSE can go undetected for months or years;\nage at referral should not be conflated with the start of CSE (CEOP, 2011). In order to better\nunderstand the relationship between exploitation and offending and start to interrogate ques-\ntions of causality, time-stamped data on abuse and offending instances per exploited offender\nare needed. This would allow chronologies of exploitation and offending behaviour to be\nmapped. Yet such data are not currently known to be routinely recorded by any agency.\nOn an individual level, some of these questions were explored through the in-depth\nanalysis of full case files from Safe and Sound Derby for a small subset of SS\nWithin the constraints of the current study it was not viable to extend this exercise to the\nwhole of SS\n. This approach gave some clues as to the complexity of interactions between\nCSE and youth offending, however, and yielded considerable qualitative richness. Some\nchildren's offending clearly began or peaked around periods of exploitation, suggesting\nCSE was a clear trigger. In some instances, offending was directly linked to abuse, such\nas one girl's deliberate breach of a curfew order to meet her exploiter. The consequences\nof disobeying his demands would, she reasoned, be far graver than those a court would\nimpose. For other children, offending and CSE appeared to be linked to shared environ-\nmental risk factors: both issues formed part of a generally chaotic lifestyle, which could\ninclude further forms of abuse and neglect.\nThese contradictory findings imply that the relationship between CSE and youth\noffending is unlikely to be a simple, universal and linear chain of cause and effect.\nWhatever the initial cause, for many children CSE and youth offending seem to coexist in\na state of twisted symbiosis, whereby the one exacerbates the other and vice versa. Thus,\nalthough CSE may trigger or exacerbate offending, offending may simultaneously trigger\nor exacerbate exploitation. In 2011, a CSE victim had a previous conviction overturned\nafter it was identified as directly related to her own exploitation (The Times, 2011). There\nis a clear need to explore ways in which prior offending records influence CSE disclosures\nand a child's status as a CSE victim affects their treatment in the criminal justice system.\nConclusion\nThis preliminary study revealed a clear correlation between CSE and youth offending. It\nalso highlighted some of the issues that can arise when attempting to study the intersection\nbetween two complex and hidden problems such as these. It identified data deficiencies,\nincluding the lack of baseline data, that complicate research efforts. It is hoped that this\nstudy will increase awareness of the overlap between CSE and youth offending. In doing\nso, it could stimulate research and debate and inform responses to both issues, in the youth\njustice system and beyond. As interest in tackling CSE continues to grow globally, there\nis an increasing need for a better understanding of its connections with other social issues.\n"
