This differential was not\nexplained by conventional risk factors including age,\nsmoking, social position and body mass index (BMI).\nMethods This study used large and representative\nsamples of non-minority adults aged 52e85 years taken\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 2004\nEnglish Longitudinal Study of Aging. The surveys contain\nself-reported and objective biological disease markers of\ndiabetes as well as indicators of major risk factors for\ndiabetes including anthropometric measures of BMI,\nheight and waist circumference.\nResults The older American population has much higher\nrates of diabetes than the English populationda\ndifferential not yet explained, but this population also has\nhigher waist circumference at each level of BMI than\ndoes the equivalent group in England. By controlling for\nsuch waist circumference differences and allowing\nfor different effects of waist on diabetes in each\ncountry, approximately three-quarters of the country\ndifferences for women and 38% among men can be\nexplained.\nConclusions Higher rates of diabetes in the US old-age\npopulation than in England were largely accounted for by\nraised waist circumference and not BMI differences,\nespecially among women. In addition, elevated diabetes\nrisk associated with higher waist circumference in the\nUSA as opposed to England could arise as a result of\na number of different mechanisms. Investigation of the\nrelative importance of such mechanisms is an important\ntopic for further study.\nDiabetes prevalence is approximately twice as high\nin the USA compared with England for both sexes.1\nThis difference was not due to differential disease\nself-reporting by country because the differential\nexists using either self-reports of doctor diagnosis or\nobjective markers of diabetes. Conventional models\nof diabetes prevalence that included standard risk\nfactors (smoking, age, social position) indicated\nthat little of this international difference was\nexplained by country differences in these risks.1\nThese differences remained substantial when body\nmass index (BMI) indicators of overweight or obese\nwere included in the analyses, indicating that other\nfactors were responsible.1\nRecent data suggested that other aspects of body\nshape including waist circumference were different\nacross countries.2 Increasing waist circumference\nwas associated with the increasing risk of subse-\nquent diabetes and was more predictive than BMI.3 4\nThe association of increased diabetes or its risk\nfactors with shorter height has been described in\nmany populations.5 6\nEarlier analyses examining international differ-\nences in diabetes did not examine the role of waist\ncircumference.1 We study its importance in the\nEnglish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and\nthe American National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), which are\nnationally representative cohorts with both BMI\nand waist circumference measurements. Our aim\nwas to expand these models to consider the\nsimultaneous risks of both BMI and waist circum-\nference, and to assess how much of the difference in\ndiabetes prevalence between England and America\nwas explained by these body shape risks.\nMETHODS\nData\nWe used data from eight waves of NHANES, fielded\nof ELSA. We combined NHANES waves from\nbefore and after ELSA 2004 to have comparable\nsample sizes. There was no statistically significant\ntrend in diabetes prevalence over NHANES years\nELSA. NHANES included data obtained through\npersonal interviews, physical and laboratory\nexaminations for people 2 months and older. For\nage comparability, we restricted our NHANES\nsample to respondents between 52 and 85 years\nolddage 52 years was the minimum age in ELSA\nand age 85 years was the maximum age in\nNHANES. To ensure that country differences were\nnot due to high rates of diabetes among African-\nAmericans or Hispanic individuals in America or\nAsian and black immigrants in England, our anal-\nysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white individ-\nuals. There were 4570 non-Hispanic white\nNHANES respondents in this age range.\nELSA contained respondents recruited from three\nseparate years of the Health Survey for England\nproviding representative English samples aged\nsupplemented by the collection of social and\neconomic data.8 ELSA protocols included interview\nvisits followed by nurse visits when saliva and\nblood samples were drawn. Blood samples were\nanalysed for glycosylated haemoglobin, also avail-\nable in NHANES. There were 6888 respondents in\nour ELSA analytical sample.\nNHANES is a nationally representative survey\nof Americans less than 85 years of age with a high\nresponse rate. The baseline response rate in\nmedical examinations. Its sample characteristics\nclosely match the current population surveys.\n< An additional appendix table\nA is published online only.

Respondents were classified as\nhaving diabetes if either they answered affirmatively to the self-\nreported diabetes question or their HbA1c levels were 6.5% or\ngreater. Our measures were thus unaffected by country differ-\nences in undiagnosed diabetes.\nMeasures of BMI and waist risk\nHeight and weight measurements were taken during nurse-\nconducted physical examinations so objective BMI measures\nwere computed free of errors in self-reports.12 We experimented\nwith two BMI measuresdcategorical indicators of whether\nrespondents were obese (BMI $30) or overweight (BMI $25 and\n<30) and continuous BMI measures (kg/m2) entered as\nquadratics. As height may have an independent effect,13 height\nin metres was entered as a quadratic.\nBMI provides a crude index of adiposity by not considering\ncentral fat mass, which is more strongly associated with disease\nrisk. Our data contained both BMI and central fat\nmassdobjectively measured waist circumference in centi-\nmetres.14 Similar to BMI, we experimented with two measures\nof waist risk. The first categorised respondents into three waist\nrisk groups (low, medium and high) in which centimetre cut-off\npoints differed by gender.15 16 The male groups were low\nwhereas for women cut-off points were low (<80 cm), moderate\nwaist in centimetres, entered as a quadratic.\nOther risk factors\nAmerican education was separated into high school or less\n(0e12 years), more than high school but not a college graduate\n(13e15 years) and college or more (16 years or greater). The\nEnglish three-way education division was qualified to a level\nlower than `O' level or equivalent (typically 0e11 years), quali-\nfied to a level lower than `A' level or equivalent (typically\n12e13 years of schooling), and a higher qualification (more than\n13 years). Our surveys collected several health-related behav-\niours including smoking status (ever smoked) and marital status\n(single or married).\nStatistical methods\nWe estimated six models of diabetes prevalence separately for\nmen and women. We began with a baseline model pooled across\ncountries with no covariates except an indicator of coun-\ntrydour `unadjusted' model or country differences in diabetes\nprevalence we tried to explain. The subsequent five models\nlabelled 1 to 5 all included quadratics in age and in height, and\nindicator variables described above for education, marital status\nand smoking.\nWe were particularly interested in the role of BMI and waist\ncircumference combined with how they were measured. Models\n1 to 5 differed in how we specified them. Model 1 used\nconventional BMI categorical indicators of obesity and over-\nweight; model 2 had the same BMI categorical indicators and\nadded waist categorical indicators of moderate and high waist\nrisk; model 3 had continuous BMI entered as a quadratic; model\n4 had continuous BMI and continuous waist both as quadratics;\nmodel 5 had the same model as model 4 but in addition allowed\nthe effects of continuous BMI and continuous waist to differ\nbetween America and England.\nWe relied on ordinary least squares regression models of\nprevalence, estimated using Stata statistical software. As our\nmodels contained interaction terms, logistic regressions do not\nprovide a straightforward interpretation.17 Nevertheless our\nconclusions from the non-interactive models were unchanged if\nmultiple logistic or multivariate probit models were used.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 lists means and standard deviations of variables and\ndisplays results of statistical tests for country differences.\nAmerican male prevalence was 16% compared with 11% for\nEnglish men and 14% for American women compared with 7%\nfor English women. Both country differences in diabetes preva-\nlence were statistically significant at the 1% level.\nConventional diabetes risk factors were similar in the Amer-\nican and English populations examined. On average Americans\nare only a little taller, have slightly higher BMI and are\napproximately 3 years older. The English were less educated and\nmore likely to have smoked, risk factors that normally increase\ndiabetes.3 18 19 The only attribute offering some explanatory\npromise was waist circumference. American men have almost\n3 cm larger waists than English men, and the waists of American\nwomen are 5 cm bigger than English women (p<0.01).\nFigures 1e3 present age standardised distribution of waist risk\n(low, moderate and high) among those whose BMI is below 25,\nbetween 25 and 30 and 30 and over separately by gender in both\ncountries. Age standardisation eliminated impacts of country\n70e79, 80 years and over, age-weighted BMI and waist risks were\ncalculated. To capture risk variation, individuals were placed into\nthree BMI groups and three waist risk groups defined above.\nSupplementary appendix table A, available online only, includes\nstatistical tests of differences in waist and BMI between countries.\nAmerican men were more obese than English men (31.6%\nwith 48.3%) with no difference in normal weight. Female\nobesity differences were even smaller (32.9% of Americans\ncompared with 30.6% among English women), a disparity not\nstatistically significant and not large enough to explain a two-to-\none diabetes prevalence differential between countries.\nCompared with English women, American women were less\nbutions, it is unsurprising that BMI alone cannot explain higher\ndiabetes rates among Americans.\nMarginal distributions of waist risk within each BMI group\nwere more to the disadvantage of American men than BMI\nResearch report\ndifferences and female disparities are strikingd56.0% of English\nwomen have high waist risk, whereas the comparable fraction\namong Americans was 69.4%da statistically significant differ-\nence. These differences are in accord with recent evidence from\nsmaller more specialist studies in which body shape was\nmeasured using three-dimensional body scanning equipment in\nboth countries.\nIf there was a one-to-one correspondence between BMI and\nwaist risk categories, there would be little reason to prefer one.\nBut this is not true. Among the overweight in figure 2, 56% of\nAmerican men have high waist risk compared with 41% of\nEnglish men, while 87% of American women have high waist\nrisk compared with 61% of English women. Even among those\nwith normal weight, the fraction with raised waist risk was not\ntrivial for US womend40.6% of Americans who were neither\noverweight nor obese were categorised as high waist risk\ncompared with 8.9% among equivalent English women. The\nonly BMI category with little additional information obtained\nfrom waist were the obese (figure 3). At least 95% of respondents\nlabelled obese were simultaneously labelled high waist risk.\nFigure 4 summarises the ability of factors to explain country\ndifferences in diabetes prevalence using our six models. For each\nmodel, the solid bar indicates our estimate of `unexplained'\nprevalence rate differences between America and England, while\nthe lines represent 95% CI around that estimate. The unadjusted\nspecification reported a baseline model pooled across countries\nwith just the country dummy (\u00bc1 indicates US). This model\nhighlighted unadjusted country differences in diabetesd4.8%\nfor men and 7.3% for women.\nSubsequent models in the next five rows in figure 4 sequen-\ntially expand the set of covariates while maintaining the\nassumption that the effects of covariates are the same in both\ncountries. All models below unadjusted included quadratic\ncontrols for age and height, indicator variables for education\ngroups, single and smoking. Models 1e4 varied the way in\nwhich BMI and waist circumference were included in models.\nModel 1 estimates in figure 4 represented the traditional\napproach to measuring BMIdtwo indicators for whether one\nwas overweight or obese. This model did not explain any\nbetween-country prevalence differencedsome factors (age,\nBMI) predict higher US diabetes prevalence, other factors\n(education, height) predict the opposite with combined effects\nlargely offsetting. Model 2 highlights the impacts of adding\ncategorical variables to capture waist riskdthese effects are\nTable 1 Means and standard deviations\nEnglish men English women American men American women\nMean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD) Mean (SD)\n*Statistically significant at 0.05; ** statistically significant at 0.01 difference between American and English.\nNotes:\nrespectively\n2.

The height of each bar in these figures tells us the fraction of each demographic group\nwho are of normal, over-weight, and obese BMI respectively. The relative size of the\nshaded areas within each bar informs us about those who are of low, moderate, and high\nwaist risk within that BMI category.\nFigure 1 Distribution of waist risk for those with BMI below 25.\nFigure 2 Distribution of waist risk for those with BMI between 25\nResearch report\nquite modest in reducing unexplained country prevalence\ndifferences.\nModel 3 was similar to model 1 except continuous quadratic\nBMI replaced standard obese and overweight categories controls.\nEstimated country prevalence differences were unchanged.\nModel 4 shows effects of including continuous quadratic\nmeasures of BMI and waist risk. With both shape variables\nmeasured continuously instead of as categories, we explained\none quarter of the original male difference in prevalence and\napproximately 60% of the female difference. Continuous BMI by\nitself does not help explain country differences (another illus-\ntration of BMI deficiency), but a combination of continuous\nmeasures of BMI and waist significantly reduced country\ndifferences in `unexplained' diabetes prevalence.\nModels 1e4 did not allow effects of BMI or waist on\npredicting diabetes to vary by country. Our preferred model 5\nallowed estimated impacts of both body shape measures to vary\nbetween countries. The remaining unexplained male country\ndifference was 3 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points for\nwomen. As indicated by 95% CI in figure 4, female country\ndifference in diabetes was no longer statistically significant.\nControl variables in this model explained 38% of country\ndifference in male prevalence and 74% of female differences.\nThe regression models underlying model 5 in figure 4 are\npresented in table 2. Estimates for non-anthropometric variables\nwere as expected.20 The probability of diabetes rose with age at\na decreasing rate, increased height is associated with lower\ndiabetes risk, and smoking and marital status did not matter.21 22\nAfter controlling for waist, we found no statistically significant\neffect of BMI for American or English men or women. In contrast\nto weak BMI effects, waist risk was strongly associated with\ndiabetes, with risk increasing in waist circumference. Based on\na likelihood ratio test, quadratic waist terms were statistically\nsignificant for American men and women implying that the\nconsequences of raised waist are higher for them compared with\nthe English.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found significant roles for height and waist on diabetes\nprevalence. The mechanisms by which height reduces diabetes\nrisk are unclear. Adult stature reflects childhood growth patterns\nand an association of short stature with type 2 diabetes indicates\nthat impaired childhood growth leads to adult insulin resistance\nand diabetes.23 Mechanisms include poor nutrition in child-\nhood.24 There may be reverse causation at older ages, in which\nco-morbidity with diabetes is associated with height reduction,\nbut we found no significant age interactions indicating that\nthese influences are unlikely to vary by country. While height\nwas related to diabetes risk, height cannot explain country\ndifferences because average height was approximately the same\nin both countries.\nIn contrast, waist circumference explained a substantial\nproportion of higher diabetes in America for men and virtually\nall differences for women, but continuous measures were\nrequired to capture differences in diabetes risks between the two\npopulations.\nNotes:\n1. Solid bars indicate estimated prevalence differences; lines indicate 95% confidence\ninterval around the estimates.\n2. Positive values of prevalence indicate greater prevalence in the US.\n3. Models 2-5 all include the following risk factors: age and age2, height and height2 and\nindicators of education, marital status and past smoking behaviour.\n4. BMI and waist adjustments in models 1-4 are as follows. Model 1: categorical BMI\nindicators; Model 2: categorical BMI indicators and categorical waist risk\nindicators (medium, high); Model 3: BMI (kg/m2) and BMI2; Model 4: BMI and BMI2,\nwaist (cm) and waist2.\n5. Model 5 contains the same adjustments as model 4, but with the effects of BMI and\nwaist being allowed to differ in the two countries.\nFigure 4 Estimated diabetes prevalence difference between US and\nEngland.\nTable 2 Models of diabetes prevalence\nB (SE) B (SE)\nMen Women\n*Statistically significant at 0.05; **statistically significant at 0.01.\nFigure 3 Distribution of waist risk for those with BMI 30 or over.\nResearch report\nEvidence cites increasing prevalence of obesity with increased\nburden of disease,22 but little was explained here by obesity\ncategorised by BMI index.1 BMI provides a crude index of\nadiposity by not considering central fat mass, which is more\nstrongly associated with disease risk. Acknowledging this is\nimportant when making health comparisons across different\npopulations. Our data suggested that in each BMI category\na greater proportion of Americans were at increased disease risk\nand that waist circumference played the key role.\nThere are several potential mechanisms, including different\nrates of physical activity through exercise or activities of daily\nlife, diet differences, or a more adverse psychosocial environment\nin America, all associated with central adiposity and type 2\ndiabetes.18 25 26 Adverse stressful environments may be associ-\nated with the development of central obesity.27\nEvidence between central fat accumulation and diabetes risk is\nstriking.3 4 Compared with waist hip ratio, waist circumference\nis a better marker of visceral fat.28 Fat cells located in the viscera\ndisplay distinct cellular features compared with fat cells else-\nwhere, and a specific dysfunction of these cells may be the\npathophysiological basis for negative consequences of abdominal\nobesity. Central fat cells have a higher turnover rate of triglyc-\nerides, produce more pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers\nthan fat cells from other depots. They are involved in the\nmobilisation of free fatty acids into portal circulation, impaired\nliver function leading to insulin resistance and diabetes.\nOur results were the same if we limited analyses to those\nwhose diabetes onset occurred after age 34 years so our conclu-\nsions are not driven by country differences in type 1 diabetes.\nOur results thus apply most directly to type 2 diabetes.\nELSA and NHANES allowed international comparisons in\nlarge representative cohorts, a key strength of this paper, but\nsome limitations exist. Several covariates that might influence\ndiabetes risk were unavailabledequivalent collection of physical\nactivity or dietary information and medication intakes. Evidence\nsuggests that while more recently developed antihypertensive\nmedications are not diabetogenic, older treatments increase\ndiabetes risk.29 We cannot examine antihypertensive medication\nin detail, but speculate that, while physical activity and dietary\nintake may play a role, antihypertensive medication prescribing\npractices are similar in America and England and are unlikely to\naffect these international differences.\nTwo powerful conclusions follow from this research. Higher\nAmerican rates of diabetes compared with England were largely\ndue to a combination of high waist among Americans and\na higher impact of waist risk among Americans. The reasons\nmay be related to measures that were not available such as\nobjective measures of physical activity and dietary intake.\nThis combination of higher waist and higher risk of high\nwaist in America explained virtually all excess diabetes of\nAmerican women and almost half for American men. BMI alone\nfailed to explain any of these differences. Besides this key\nsubstantive conclusion, our results showed that modelling\ndiabetes successfully requires good measures of waist risk,\nparticularly in populations that might differ in distributions of\nbody fat like the US and English. Similar issues should be\ninvestigated for other cardiovascular disease and countries.\nFunding Support was received from a grant from the NIA to RAND and from the NIA\nand the Economic and Social Research Council to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nCompeting interests None declared.\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\nREFERENCES\n1.
