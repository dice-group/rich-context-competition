Hughes, PhD, MSW,* Amanda Toler Woodward, PhD, and\nDaniel Velez-Ortiz, PhD, MSW\nSchool of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan.\n*Address correspondence to Anne K. Hughes, PhD, MSW, School of Social Work, Michigan State University, 655 Auditorium Rd, Baker Hall,\nDecision Editor: Rachel Pruchno, PhD\nPurpose of the study: Little is known about the\neffects of chronic illness on social role participation\namong racially and ethnically diverse older adults.\nThis study was undertaken to better understand dis-\nruptions in role among African American, black\nCaribbean, white, Latino, and Asian older adults\nwith arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes. Design\nand methods: This study consisted of a cross-\nsectional secondary data analysis of the Collaborative\nPsychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. Role disruption\nwas operationalized using time out of role and role\nimpairment in the past 30 days. Data from participants\naged 65 and older were used in negative binomial\nregression analyses. Results: Overall, prevalence\nof role impairment occurred more often than time out\nof role. Race and ethnicity were not associated with\ntime out of role, but they were for role impairment.\nWhites experienced more role impairment than any\nother racial or ethnic group. Within-group analyses\nidentified that chronic illness, role participation, and\nsocioeconomic factors are related in different ways\ndepending on race or ethnicity. It appears that for\nsome racially and ethnically diverse older adults,\nhigher income and education are protective against\nrole disruption. Implications: Race and ethnicity\nare factors in how the social roles of older adults are\naffected by chronic illness, and it appears that role dis-\nruption varies with type of illness. Interventions to sup-\nport older adults with chronic illness should take into\naccount the cultural factors related to role disruption.\nKey Words:Chronic illness, Diversity and ethnicity,\nSocial roles and social factors\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control,\nthe prevalence of chronic illness across Americans\nof all ages is one in two (CDC, 2009). The risk of\nchronic illness increases with age, and the public\nhealth implications of chronic illness in the aged\nadults are substantial. Eighty percent of older\nadults have one chronic illness, whereas 50%\nhave two or more (National Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2011).\nCardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes are\namong the most common chronic illnesses in older\nRace and ethnicity factor into the prevalence\nof chronic illness among the aging U.S. popula-\ntion. For example, older African Americans have\nhigher rates of chronic illness than other ethnic\ngroups, whereas older Asian Americans tend to\nhave lower rates. Older Latinos have higher rates\nof diabetes than whites and Asian Americans\nand comparable rates of other chronic illnesses\n(Banerjee, Perry, Tran, & Arafat, 2010; Gallant,\nChronic illness is often accompanied by\nfunctional limitations and disability, constricting\nan older adult's physical being, productive activity,\nand social interaction (Druss et al., 2009; Hummel,\nThe Gerontologist\nPrior research has found that among minorities,\nparticularly African Americans, chronic conditions\nmore negatively affect functioning compared to\nhowever, focus mainly on physical functioning;\nin order to understand the full impact of chronic\nillness, it is necessary to look beyond changes in\nphysical functioning. Chronic illness intrudes on\nmultiple levels, such as the social, psychological,\ndiminish quality of life in aging. However, there\nis little known about how racially and ethnically\ndiverse older adults are affected on these other\nlevels.Oneoftheselevels,socialroles,isofparticular\ninterest as we learn more about how important\nsocial roles, such as volunteering or caregiving, can\nbe for positive aging (Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell,\n& Rozario, 2007; Jung, Gruenewald, Seeman, &\nSarkisian, 2010; Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong,\nRozario, Morrow-Howell, & Hinterlong, 2004).\nSocial Roles in Aging\nIn the aging literature, social roles that are typi-\ncal include worker (paid and unpaid), spouse/part-\nner, volunteer, student, parent, grandparent, and\ncaregiver (Adelmann, 1994; Evandrou & Glaser,\na basis for \"identifying and placing persons in a\ngroup, organization, or society\" (Turner, 1990,\np. 87) and as such encompass duties, rights, and\nexpected behavior. Role theory discusses concepts\nrelated to \"patterned and characteristic social\nbehaviors, parts or identities that are assumed by\nsocial participants, and scripts or expectations for\nbehavior that are understood by all and adhered\nin role are often destabilizing, especially if they are\naccompanied by a loss of autonomy, loss of sup-\nport, or are associated with a culturally devalued\nstatus (Turner, 1990), such as in chronic illness.\nA devalued role can affect rehabilitation, recov-\nery, and adherence, contributing to further disabil-\nity (Vanhook, 2009). With role functioning a key\naspect of social well-being (Anatchkova, Ware, &\nBjorner, 2011), it is instructive to understand how\nroles interact with chronic illness.\nGignac and coworkers (2008) examined the\nimpact of osteoarthritis on social role function-\ning and found that as age and illness intrusiveness\nincreased, people felt their role was diminished\nand their satisfaction with their role decreased.\nFurthermore, a study of adult arthritis sufferers\nwho had roles such as worker, parent, spouse, or\nhomemaker found that as their illness increasingly\nintruded on their social roles, psychological well-\nbeing decreased (Abra\u00eddo-Lanza & Revenson,\n2006). Some research suggests that a decline in\nrole participation and functioning contributes\nto depressive symptomatology for women and\ncomplicates the healing process (Stenius, Veysey,\nHamilton, & Andersen, 2005). Others have\nfound that well-being in older adults with multi-\nple chronic conditions was related positively with\nsatisfaction with role participation (Anaby et al.,\none factor that is often overlooked or unexamined\nin previous studies was the race and ethnicity of\nthe research participants. As the population ages\nand becomes increasingly diverse, it is essential to\nunderstand how social roles and participation in\nsocial roles vary for racially and ethnically diverse\nolder adults.\nDouble Jeopardy\nVariability in outcomes for older ethnic\nminorities may be explained by the double\njeopardy hypothesis, which states that older ethnic\nminority adults are negatively affected by racism\nand ethnic discrimination as well as ageism (Dowd\n& Bengtson, 1978). The additive effects of these\ntwo social processes have been conceptualized\nas a double burden borne by non-White older\nadults (Markides, 1983). Although unexplored\nempirically, this burden could differentially affect\nhow older ethnic minorities are affected by their\nchronic illnesses and their abilities to participate\nin important social roles. Double jeopardy is one\nof a group of potential explanatory models such\nas cumulative disadvantage, persistent inequality,\nand leveling that aim to help us understand\ndifferences in aging among racially and ethnically\ndiverse older adults; each has had mixed empirical\nFerraro & Farmer, 1996). Comparisons of the\ndifferent theoretical orientations across studies\nof race, age, and health are challenging due to\nmethodological differences (Brown et al., 2012).\nFurthermore, comparisons other than black/\nwhite have only recently been conducted (Bellizzi\nIt is increasingly clear that social roles and social\nprocesses such as those discussed in the double\njeopardy hypothesis need to be examined across\na broader spectrum of racial and ethnic groups.\nFactors that may be associated with the extent to\nwhich chronic illness influences role participation\nmay also vary across groups in a variety of ways\nnot previously captured through black/white com-\nparisons. For example, black Americans are often\ntreated as one homogenous group although blacks\nof Caribbean descent and African Americans differ\nin terms of ethnicity, national heritage, socioeco-\nnomics, and immigration status (Logan & Deane,\n2003). The racial and ethnic heterogeneity in the\nolder adult population may be associated with\nsocial role functioning in a variety of ways not yet\nexamined. This study was undertaken to better\nunderstand disruptions in role among racially and\nethnically diverse older adults with chronic illness.\nWe expect, based on the double jeopardy hypoth-\nesis, that non-White older adults will experience\nmore role disruption associated with chronic ill-\nness. In addition, we expect variability in this rela-\ntionship across the five racial and ethnic groups\nincluded here. Understanding how the interference\ncaused by chronic illness affects different racial\nand ethnic groups has important implications for\nfuture care planning and needs for formal and\ninformal services. This project was guided by the\nfollowing hypotheses: (a) There will be differences\nin time out of role and role functioning by racial\nand ethnic groups, (b) compared with white older\nadults, time out of role and role impairment will\nbe higher for non-White older adults, and (c) dif-\nferences in time out of role and role functioning\nby race and ethnicity will be maintained when we\ncontrol for age, income, and education.\nDesign and Methods\nSample\nThis cross-sectional study utilized secondary\ndata analysis to examine our three hypotheses.\nData came from the Collaborative Psychiatric\nEpidemiology Surveys (CPES). The CPES was\nfunded primarily by the National Institute of\nMental Health and consists of three interre-\nlated surveys--the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication (NCS-R), the National Survey of\nAmerican Life (NSAL), and the National Latino\nand Asian American Survey (NLAAS). Data for\neach survey were collected by the Survey Research\nCenter at the University of Michigan, were in\nand share the multistage area probability sam-\nple designs common to the national surveys con-\nducted by the Survey Research Center (Heeringa\nCPES studies were designed to allow integration\nof design-based analysis weights to combine data\nsets as though they were a single, nationally repre-\nsentative study (Heeringa & Berglund, 2007).\nEach survey has unique features in its national\narea probability samples that complement one\nanother and allow for racial/ethnic group compari-\nsons, which are the focus of this study. The NCS-R,\nfor example, was designed to be representative of\nthe U.S. population in general and includes face-\nto-face interviews with 9,282 residents of English-\nspeaking households who were 18 years or older.\nThe response rate for the NCS-R is 70.9%. The\nNSAL was designed to be representative of blacks\nin the United States and was based on a national\nhousehold probability sample of 6,082 African\nAmericans, whites, and blacks of Caribbean\ndescent. The overall response rate for the NSAL\nis 72.3%. The NLAAS is a nationally representa-\ntive sample of Latino and Asian populations in the\nAsian Americans with an overall response rate of\n73.2% (for more details on the NCS-R, NSAL,\nand NLAAS sample designs, see Heeringa, Torres,\nSweetman, & Baser [2006]). This study uses data\nfrom CPES respondents aged 65 and older. As this\nstudy involved secondary data only, IRB approval\nwas not sought.\nMeasures\nThe dependent variables are time out of role\nand role impairment due to problems with physical\nhealth, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs.\nTime out of role is the number of days in the past\n30 in which the respondent was totally unable to\nwork or carry out his/her normal activities. Role\nimpairment is the number of days in the past 30\nin which the respondent was able to work and\ncarry out normal activities but had to cut down\non what he/she did or did not get as much done as\nusual, cut back on the quality of his/or her work\nor how carefully he/she worked, or had to make\nan extreme effort to perform his/her work or other\nnormal daily activities at the usual level.\nThe main predictors of interest are the presence\nof heart disease, arthritis, or diabetes measured by\ndichotomous variables labeled 1 if the respondent\nreported that a professional had ever told them they\nhad the illness, the number of illnesses they report\n(none, one, two, or more), and race/ethnicity (non-\nLatino white, African American, black Caribbean,\nLatino, Asian). Control variables include age (65\u00ad\nmore).\nAnalysis\nNegative binomial regression analyses were\nused to examine variables associated with time\nout of role and role impairment both between and\nwithin racial/ethnic groups. Negative binomial\nregression is an alternative to OLS regression for\nskewed count data. In this case, the number of\ndays of role disruption is positively skewed with\nthe majority of respondents reporting no days out\nof role or with role impairment. For each variable\nwith more than two categories, a design-corrected\nWald chi-square test was conducted to minimize\nthe likelihood of Type I error due to multiple com-\nparisons. An alpha of .05 was used as the cutoff\nfor significance. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using the survey commands in Stata 12.0,\naccounting for the complex multistage-clustered\ndesign of the CPES samples, unequal probabilities\nof selection, nonresponse, and poststratification to\ncalculate weighted, nationally representative pop-\nulation estimates and standard errors.\nResults\nSample Description\nTable 1 offers a description of the study\nsample. The majority of respondents reported\nno chronic illness, whereas 27.9% had one of\nthe three illnesses and 13.8% had two or more.\nOf those with a chronic illness, most reported\ndisease, and 18.8% had diabetes. The majority\n7.1% aged between 85 and older. Over half of\nrespondents (57.6%) were women and non-Latino\nwhite (54.4%). Twenty-two percent were African\nwere Latino, and 6.6% were Asian. About a third\nremainder of respondents had incomes less than\nApproximately one third of respondents (30.4%)\nor more. Overall, respondents reported more days\nof role impairment, (M = 4.19) than time out of\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nTables 2 and 3 display regression results for\nracial/ethnic comparisons and the predicted mean\nnumber of days of role disruption (time out of\nrole or role impairment) based on the multivari-\nate model and controlling for type and number of\nchronic illnesses, age, sex, household income, and\nTable 1.

Race/ethnicity is related to role impair-\nment but not time out of role. Specifically, African\nAmericans, black Caribbeans, Latinos, and Asians\nreport significantly fewer days of impaired role\ncompared with Whites. Black Caribbeans report\nsignificantly fewer days impaired compared with\nAfrican Americans, Asians, and Latinos. There\nwere no significant differences in role impair-\nment between African Americans, Asians, and\nLatinos. As shown in Table 3, whites have the\nhighest predicted number of days with role impair-\nment on average (M = 5.20), followed by Latinos\nWithin-Group Differences\nTables 4 and 5 present the association of\nphysical disorders and sociodemographic variables\nwith time out of role and role impairment within\neach racial/ethnic group. For whites, having\narthritis was associated with significantly fewer\ndays out of role, whereas having one or more\nchronic illness was associated with more days\nout of role compared with those with no illness.\nWhites in the highest income category reported\nless time out of role than those in the lowest\nincome group. Among older African Americans,\nincome and education were significant such that\nhigher were less likely to report time out of role\nthan those in the lowest income quartile, whereas\nhigher education was associated with increased\ntime out of role. Both diabetes and heart disease\nwere associated with less time out of role for black\nCaribbeans, whereas having one or more chronic\nillness increased time out of role. Black Caribbeans\naged 85 and older reported less time out of role as\ndid those with 12\u00ad15 years of education. Among\nAsians, those in the highest income and education\ncategories reported less time out of role. No\ncovariates were significantly associated with time\nout of role for Latinos.\nLooking at role impairment,older white,African\nAmerican, and Latino women reported more role\nimpairment than men. Arthritis was associated\nwith more role impairment for African Americans,\nwhereas African Americans and black Caribbeans\nin the oldest age category reported less impair-\nment. African Americans in the middle income cat-\negories reported less role impairment than those\nin the lowest income group. Black Caribbeans and\nAsians aged 75\u00ad84 reported more role impairment\nDiscussion\nOne strength of this data set is that it allows\nus to look at racial and ethnic differences in role\nfunctioning, something that has been overlooked\nin previous literature. It has been stated that the\nrole literature is limited by a focus on young adult-\nhood or early midlife and has not addressed issues\nof people from less advantaged backgrounds\nof the current study shed light on both between-\nand within-group differences of ethnically diverse\nolder adults with chronic illness.\nWhen we looked at differences between racial/\nethnic groups and within the different ethnic\ngroups, we found there is some interesting descrip-\ntive data about how chronic illnesses interact with\nroles. Main findings indicate racial/ethnic differ-\nences in role impairment but not time out of role.\nTable 2.

Predicted Mean Number of Days Out of Role or\nImpaired by Race/Ethnicitya\nTime out of role Role impairment\nNote: aControlling for type and number of chronic illness,\nage, sex, household income, and education.\nThe differences on time out of role were not sig-\nnificant, indicating that across ethnicities the\nimpact of the different chronic illnesses is similar.\nAlthough not significant, the predicted number\nof days for whites was on average lower than for\nother racial/ethnic groups. In light of the double\njeopardy hypothesis, the results do not seem to\nsupport a significantly higher burden of illness on\nthe part of minorities as reflected in their time out\nof role. These results may provide evidence for the\nconcept of leveling, where differences based on\nrace and ethnicity level out as people age (Kim &\nTime out of role was measured in this study\nas the number of days in the past 30 that the\nparticipant was totally unable to complete their\nnormal activities. Of the two measures, this one\nis clearly the more extreme. The older adults with\nchronic illness in this sample are not experiencing\nthis complete inability to participate in their roles as\noften as they experience some impairment. Perhaps\nthose who are aged 65 and over are reluctant to\nsay they are completely unable to participate in\ntheir social roles, as this could be disempowering\n(Turner, 1990), or may not be acceptable within\ntheir family or cultural context. Prior research on\nchronic illness and family dynamics has found that,\nfor minorities,roles within their social networks are\ndefined in cultural ways (Gallant et al., 2010). This\ncultural understanding of role may be incongruent\nwith the notion of being completely unable to\nparticipate, despite physical health problems.\nWhen considering the within-group results, we\nsee that there are some racial/ethnic differences\nin how the different disorders are associated with\ntime out of role and role impairment. Interestingly,\nwe only found associations in some of the groups:\nfor whites, arthritis was associated with fewer days\nout of role, for black Caribbeans both arthritis and\ndiabetes were associated with less time out of role,\nand for African Americans arthritis was associated\nwith more role impairment. Having one or more\nillness was associated with more time out of role\nfor both whites and black Caribbeans and that\nassociation increased with the number of illnesses\nreported. The lack of an association between time\nout of role and increasing numbers of chronic ill-\nnesses among African Americans, Latinos, and\nTable 4.

Perhaps there\nare culturally bound factors that are functioning\nto buffer illness intrusiveness in these groups.\nIncome was somewhat protective for whites,\nAfrican Americans, and Asians, as we saw associa-\ntions between higher income and less time out of\nroleandlessroleimpairmentforAfricanAmericans.\nEducation was negatively related to time out of\nrole for Asians and black Caribbeans. This indi-\ncates that socioeconomic status is an important\nfactor in time out of role for several of the racial\nand ethnic groups in this study. Increasing age was\nactually found to be associated with decreases in\nboth days out of role and role impairment. Asian\nolder adults were the only subgroup that reported\nmore time out of role and role impairment as age\nincreased, which may indicate that this is the period\nwhen Asian American older adults are more likely\nto exit work-related roles or to diminish role par-\nticipation overall. Gallant and coworkers (2010)\nfound that older Asian American immigrants have\ndifficulty adjusting to cultural family structures in\nthe U.S. context because their children tend to be\nmore acculturated and perform fewer customs of\nfilial piety. The NLAAS sample used in the analysis\ncontains a high number of immigrant older Asians.\nThe Asian American older adults in this sample\nmay be more vulnerable to feeling disconnected,\nwhich can result in less support to continue roles.\nAt the same time, older black Caribbeans and\nAfrican Americans may report decreases in role\ndisruption, in part, because the expectation of their\nsocial role changes with age.\nWhites had the most role impairment, followed\nby Latinos, African Americans, Asians, and then\nblack Caribbeans. The finding that whites were\nmore debilitated by chronic illness, as measured by\nrole impairment, in comparison to the other ethnic\ngroups is unexpected, particularly in light of the\ndouble jeopardy hypothesis. This may be because\nwhites with chronic illness have more freedom to\nunderperform in the fulfillment of their roles than\nis available to racial and ethnic minorities. The\nburden to perform a role and not admit defeat may\nbe a cultural relic that older adults from different\ncultures share. African Americans and Latinos\noften care for multiple persons in a household\n(i.e., parent, spouse, grandchildren, etc.) (Gallant\nTable 5.

Having multiple care roles may create\na situation that does not support having any role\nimpairment. We also must consider the way that\nrole impairment was measured in this study. Study\nparticipants were asked to report the number of\ndays in the past 30 that they had cut down on what\nthey did or did not get as much done as usual, cut\nback on the quality of their work or how carefully\nthey worked, or had to make an extreme effort to\nperform their work or other normal daily activi-\nties at the usual level. These concepts may not have\nbeen as relevant to the non-White respondents. It\nis also a possibility that the severity or length of ill-\nness that the whites in this sample had was higher\ntherefore contributing to the differential impair-\nment in their roles.\nStudy results need to be examined in light\nof several limitations. First, the cross-sectional\nnature of the study does not allow us to make\nstatements regarding causation. In addition,\nchronic illness is measured as presence or absence\nof that illness at any time during the participant's\nlifetime and relied on self report of chronic\ncondition. Research has found that self report\nis generally accurate (Kriegsman, Penninx, van\nEijk, Boeke, & Deeg, 1996; National Center for\nHealth Statistics, 1994), but we have neither\noutside verification of the presence of the chronic\nillness nor information about severity of illness.\nThis study was also limited by the way that role\ndisruption was measured, using only days out\nof role and role impairment, and not having\ndata available about the participation in, nor\nimportance of, said roles of participants. Prior\nresearch has found that importance, or salience,\nof a role can have differential impact on aging\nBoth role impairment and time out of role\nasked for response about the last 30 days, and\nthis may not accurately reflect the impact that a\nchronic illness has had on an older person's life.\nIf at the time of the interview, the participant\nwas experiencing a particularly difficult month,\nthen this would bias their answers to these\nitems. Finally, although we were able to examine\ndifferences among blacks by comparing black\nCaribbeans and African Americans, Asians and\nLatinos are also heterogenous groups that need\nfurther consideration. Data on Asian and Latino\nsubgroups are available; however, when the\nanalysis is restricted to those aged 65 and older\nas in this study, the sample sizes are too small to\nexamine these subgroup differences further.\nImplications for Practice\nProfessionals who work with older adults\nwith chronic illness can use these results to bet-\nter understand how to tailor interventions. The\nresults reinforce the notion that culture should\nbe taken into account when looking at chronic\ndisease management (August & Sorkin, 2011;\nHan et al., 2010; Samuel-Hodge, Cene, Corsino,\nThomas, & Svetsky, 2012). This study adds to the\ngrowing body of literature on social roles in aging\nand adds the perspective of racial and ethnic dif-\nferences. Chronic illness intrusion on roles may\nnot follow the expected pathways, as we found\nthat complete inability to participate in roles\nwas less of a concern, and that Whites had more\nrole impairment than other racial/ethnic groups.\nOlder adults who are members of racial and\nethnic minorities should be the focus of further\nstudy to understand what aspects of their culture\nare interacting with their social roles to produce\nless impairment in comparison to whites. Future\nresearch should focus on intragroup differences,\nespecially in the context of culture. Looking at the\nstrengths available through a cultural perspective\ncould open up opportunities to intervene in cul-\nturally appropriate ways.\nReferences\nAbra\u00eddo-Lanza, A. F. (1997).
