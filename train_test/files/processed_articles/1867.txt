After the first Surgeon\nGeneral's report on smoking and health in\n1964, the prevalence of cigarette smoking in\nthe United States began a gradual decline\n[Department of Health and Human Services\n(DHHS) 2000a], although the use of tobacco\ncontinues to be an important problem and\nremains the leading preventable cause of\ndeath and disability in the United States\nsmoke that is inhaled by the smoker, burning\ncigarettes also generate secondhand smoke\n[SHS; also sometimes referred to as environ-\nmental tobacco smoke (ETS)] that is formed\nfrom smoke emitted into the environment\nfrom the smoldering tip of the cigarette,\nmixed with smoke exhaled by the smoker\nInvoluntary smoking results when nonsmok-\ners are exposed to SHS, and health risks for\nnonsmokers posed by involuntary smoking\nwere gradually realized. As early as 1972, the\ntopic of SHS and the potential risk faced by\nnonsmokers exposed to SHS were noted in a\nSurgeon General's report addressing the use\nof tobacco (DHHS 1972). An important fur-\nther impetus for investigations regarding\nadverse health effects from SHS exposure\nresulted from the 1986 Surgeon General's\ntime focused on the health risks of SHS, and\nalso from two influential reports by the\nNational Research Council (NRC 1986) and\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nthat exposure to SHS causes lung cancer in\nnonsmokers and has other adverse effects in\nboth adults and children. Several subsequent\nreports have confirmed and extended this link\nbetween SHS and adverse health effects\n(Jaakola and Samet 1999; National Cancer\nInstitute 1999), which may include cancer,\nasthma, respiratory infections, decreased pul-\nmonary function, and cardiovascular disease.\nDespite the increasing awareness that SHS\nrepresents an important public health con-\ncern, the extent of the problem was initially\ndifficult to measure because data on the expo-\nsure of nonsmokers were limited and often\ndepended solely on self-reported exposure or\non inferences, such as living with a smoker,\nrather than on direct measurements. However,\nobjective biomarkers of exposure to tobacco\nhave been identified and validated (Benowitz\npanel convened to review the prospects for\nbiomarker measurements as an index of SHS\nexposure concluded that plasma cotinine was\nthe marker of choice (Watts et al. 1990).\nCotinine, the primary proximate metabolite\nof nicotine, is specific for exposure to tobacco,\nand it is preferred as a marker over nicotine\nitself partly because the half-life of cotinine in\nJarvis et al. 1988) is much longer than that\nof nicotine. Serum cotinine can mark the\nexposure of an individual to tobacco only over\nthe previous few days, and it is subject to\ninterindividual variations in the metabolism of\nnicotine. However, these limitations are not\nsubstantial drawbacks when comparing mean\nvalues from groups of people, and in a review,\nBenowitz (1996) concluded that the evidence\nsupports cotinine measurements providing \"a\nvalid and quantitative measure of average\nhuman ETS exposure over time.\"\nThe first national survey of SHS exposure\nof the entire U.S. population based on serum\ncotinine measurements was conducted as part\nof the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) that cov-\nIII consisted of two phases, and we previously\nreported the results of cotinine measurements\nat that time indicated widespread exposure of\nthe population to tobacco smoke. Overall, 88%\nof nonsmokers in the U.S. population in that\nstudy were found to have detectable levels\n( 0.050 ng/mL) of cotinine in their blood,\nand certain groups of nonsmokers, including\nblacks, males, and children, were found to be at\nelevated risk of exposure based on their serum\nAfter phase 1, additional data were\nacquired during the continuation of NHANES\nthrough 1994.

Pirkle,1 John T. Bernert,1 Samuel P. Caudill,1 Connie S. Sosnoff,1 and Terry F. Pechacek2\n1Division of Laboratory Science, National Center for Environmental Health, and 2Office of Smoking and Health, National Center for\nChronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\nThe objective of this study was to describe the exposure of nonsmokers in the U.S. population to\nsecondhand smoke (SHS) using serum cotinine concentrations measured over a period of 14 years,\nfrom October 1988 through December 2002. This study consists of a series of National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) measuring serum cotinine as an index of SHS\nexposure of participants. Study participants were individuals representative of the U.S. civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population,  4 years of age. We analyzed serum cotinine and interview data\nfrom NHANES obtained during surveys conducted during four distinct time periods. Our results\ndocument a substantial decline of approximately 70% in serum cotinine concentrations in non-\nsmokers during this period. This decrease was reflected in all groups within the population regard-\nless of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. The large decrease that we observed in serum cotinine\nconcentrations suggests a substantial reduction in the exposure of the U.S. population to SHS\nduring the 1990s. The exposure of nonsmokers to SHS represents an important public health con-\ncern. Our findings suggest that recent public health efforts to reduce such exposures have had an\nimportant effect, although children and non-Hispanic black nonsmokers show relatively higher\nlevels of serum cotinine.

We report here the analy-\nsis of these data extending from 1988 through\n2002, which indicates a decreasing trend in\nSHS exposure of nonsmokers in the United\nStates, most likely reflecting extensive efforts\nmade by the public health community during\nthis time to reduce smoking in the home and\nthe exposure of nonsmokers in public places.\nHowever, our results also indicate that two\ngroups in the population, blacks and children,\nshow relatively higher levels of SHS exposure\nduring this time, suggesting that further work\nshould provide special focus on these at-risk\ngroups.\nMaterials and Methods\nNHANES is a survey conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nwhich is designed to examine a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of the U.S. civilian, nonin-\nstitutionalized population based on a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability cluster sam-\npling design. The protocols included a home\ninterview followed by a physical examination\nin a mobile examination center (MEC). These\nstudies were approved by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics Institutional Review\nBoard, and all subjects (or their parent or\nguardian) provided informed consent before\nparticipation. During examination in the\nMEC, blood samples were drawn for serum\ncotinine analysis from all participants  4 years\nof age during NHANES III, and from partici-\npants  3 years of age in subsequent surveys.\nHowever, to maintain comparability among\nsurveys in our present analyses, we have\nincluded only participants  4 years of age in\neach study interval.\nNHANES III consisted of two phases,\nNHANES began operation on a continual\nbasis, providing a new sampling of the U.S.\npopulation every 2 years. The data reported\nhere were acquired during NHANES III,\nfour distinct intervals within an overall time\nParticipants. Nonsmokers were defined in\nthis study as persons whose serum cotinine\nconcentration was  10 ng/mL. Previous com-\nparisons in NHANES III demonstrated little\ndifference when cutoffs of either 10 or\nRace/ethnicity of the participants based on\nself-report was categorized as non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nor other. The race/ethnicity category of \"other\"\nwas included in mean and percentile estimates\nfor the total population, but not in the regres-\nsion models when race was included as a\ncovariate. Age was the age in years at the time\nwere included in this study.\nCotinine analysis. We measured serum\ncotinine by a high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography/atmospheric-pressure ionization\ntandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)\nmethod that has been described previously\nsamples were equilibrated with a trideuterated\ncotinine internal standard and then extracted\nusing ChemElute columns (Varian, Harbor\nCity, CA), concentrated, and analyzed by\nLC/MS/MS using atmospheric pressure\nchemical ionization. The limit of detection\n(LOD) for most of these analyses was 0.050\nng/mL in serum, and we periodically evalu-\nated the results to assure that sensitivity at this\nlevel was maintained. However, as a result of\ncontinuing method improvements, including\nthe introduction of a newer, more sensitive\nmass spectrometer, the LOD was lowered to\n0.015 ng/mL during the analysis of samples\nanalyzed using the newer, more sensitive\nLOD. For comparison, we also analyzed the\nng/mL and found little difference in estimates\nfor means and percentiles.\nThis LC/MS/MS method for serum coti-\nnine has been continuously maintained in a\nsingle laboratory at the CDC and has analyzed\nNHANES samples collected since 1988. Both\nbench and blind serum pools are routinely\nincluded with each analytic run as part of the\nquality assurance program for this method,\nand additional pools spiked with known\namounts of cotinine perchlorate are analyzed\nperiodically to confirm both precision and\naccuracy of the assay. Because of ongoing\nimprovements in the methodology and\nbecause of the potential for monitoring popu-\nlation trends in exposure, we have made a par-\nticular effort to assure continuity, stability,\nand uniformity in our analyses over an\nextended time period. As part of that effort,\nresidual samples are retained from older serum\nquality control pools when new pools are pre-\npared, and aliquots of the older pools are peri-\nodically reexamined to help confirm stability\nof the method. We have previously noted that\nserum cotinine is stable when stored at \u00ad60\u00b0C\n(Bernert et al. 2000). Three pools at levels of\nhave been measured periodically from 1990\nthrough 2004 in this manner, and those data\nconfirmed that no systematic drift has\noccurred in our measurement of serum coti-\nnine during this time.\nStatistical methods. All regression models\nwere fitted using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC). All analyses incorporated sampling\nweights that adjusted for unequal probabilities\nof selection. The log of serum cotinine was\nused as the dependent variable because of the\nlog-normal distribution of serum cotinine that\nhas been previously described (Pirkle et al.\n1996). Separate models were fitted for each\ntime period. For each of the models, the follow-\ning independent variables were used: sex (males,\nfemales), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans), and\nInitial models also included all possible two-\nway interactions. Geometric means computed\nfor each age group, race/ethnicity, and sex were\nadjusted for all other variables in each model.\nChanges over time were evaluated by using a\ntwo-tailed t-test to compare model adjusted\nmeans of the log-transformed results for the\ndegrees of freedom and SEs for these tests cor-\nrespond to those associated with the model-\nadjusted means. In all cases, a null hypothesis\nprobability level of  5% was taken to indicate\nstatistical significance.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the geometric mean [and 95%\nconfidence interval (CI)] for serum cotinine\nconcentrations in the U.S. population of\nnonusers of tobacco over the time period\nthe data in Figure 1 are plotted at the approx-\nimate midpoint of each interval. These data\ndemonstrate a consistent decrease over time,\nwith a decline of approximately 70% observed\nbetween the first and last survey periods.

This pattern was\nreversed among the younger children in the\n4\u00ad11 age group, with girls having consistently\nhigher mean serum cotinine levels than did\nboys, although again, the differences were\nsmall and were not significant.\nPercentiles for serum cotinine in non-\nsmokers in three main age groups are given in\nTable 1.

This decrease in\nserum cotinine concentrations suggests a\nsubstantial reduction in the exposure of the\nU.S. population to SHS over this period. For\nexample, during NHANES III, approximately\n65% of nonsmokers had serum cotinine con-\nthat basis, a Healthy People 2010 objective\nwas established stating that, by the year 2010,\nno more than 45% of nonsmokers should\nhave cotinine levels > 0.1 ng/mL (DHHS\n2000c). Our present results suggest that this\nchildren and non-Hispanic blacks had consis-\ntently higher serum cotinine concentrations\nthan did other segments of the population and\nthus remain at relatively elevated risk from\nexposure to SHS.\nThe most likely explanations for this\ndecrease in serum cotinine concentrations are\nthe increased restrictions on smoking that\nhave been widely instituted at work and in\nother public places during this time period,\nand further efforts to reduce the exposure of\nnonsmokers in the home.

A major source of SHS exposure\nin young children is from parents or other\nadults smoking at home, and exposure of non-\nsmokers to SHS in homes with children also\ndeclined during the 1990s. Comparing data\nInterview Surveys, Soliman et al. (2004)\nfound that reported SHS exposure declined\nfrom 36% to approximately 25%, more than\nwould be expected from declines in adult\nsmoking prevalence alone. This decrease\noccurred across all groups, although home\nSHS exposures remained most prevalent\namong non-Hispanic whites in that study, and\nwe found that cotinine concentrations were\nhigher in non-Hispanic children than in\nadults during all NHANES survey periods.\nIn the present study, Mexican-American\nnonsmokers generally had lower serum cotinine\nlevels than did the other two race/ethnicity\ngroups, whereas mean serum cotinine concen-\ntrations in non-Hispanic blacks were consis-\ntently higher in each time period. The higher\ncotinine concentrations found in non-Hispanic\nblacks presumably reflect greater exposure to\nSHS within this population, although the inter-\npretation of these results is complicated by pos-\nsible metabolic influences. Among active\nsmokers, blacks have consistently higher serum\ncotinine concentrations per cigarette smoked\nWagenknecht et al. 1990), and this has been\nattributed, at least in part, to differences\nbetween blacks and whites in the metabolism of\nnicotine, cotinine, and their glucuronides\n(Benowitz et al. 1999). Thus, metabolic factors\nmight also account for at least part of the eth-\nnic/racial differences seen in serum cotinine lev-\nels among nonsmokers. In a study of children\nwith asthma, Wilson et al. (2005) reported\nfinding significantly higher serum cotinine con-\ncentrations for African-American children even\nafter adjusting for self-reported SHS exposure.\nHowever, Wagenknecht et al. (1993) found\nthat SHS exposure assessed by either self-report\nor serum cotinine measurements among 3,300\nnonsmokers in the CARDIA study was signifi-\ncantly higher for blacks than for whites, but\nPirkle et al.\nTable 1.

Sexton et al. (2004) also\nfound that questionnaires, time\u00adactivity data,\nand cotinine measurements all indicated higher\nSHS exposure among African-American chil-\ndren. Thus, the consistently higher serum coti-\nnine levels for black nonsmokers in NHANES\nappear to reflect higher SHS exposure,\nalthough the extent to which differences in\nmetabolism may confound these estimates\nremains uncertain.\nExposure of nonsmokers to SHS also\nappears to have declined in other countries\nbesides the United States during this time\nperiod, at least based on self-report. For\nexample, Borland et al. (1999) described\nannual surveys of approximately 2,500 adults\nconducted in Victoria, Australia, from 1989\nreporting that they did not smoke in the pres-\nence of children and that visitors were dis-\ncouraged from smoking in the home both\napproximately doubled during this time. In\naddition, the percentage of indoor workers in\nVictoria protected by restrictions on smoking\nin the workplace increased from 17% to 66%\nFinland passed its Tobacco Control Act in\n1995 prohibiting smoking in the workplace\nin all joint and public premises, workers\nreporting no ETS exposure in the workplace\nMost studies finding decreased exposure\nto SHS over time have relied on self-reports.\nHowever, Jarvis et al. (2000) have reported a\nsubstantial decrease during the 1990s in the\nexposure of British school children to SHS as\nassessed by salivary cotinine measurements.\nThey monitored secondary school children\nand found that their salivary cotinine levels\ndecreased by almost 50% during that time.\nThey attributed the decline to both the\ndecrease in prevalence of smoking among\nyoung adults with children and the increased\nrestrictions in Great Britain on smoking in\npublic places. However, Jarvis et al. (2000)\nfound only small declines among children\nwhose parents smoked, suggesting that cessa-\ntion rather than smokers simply avoiding\nexposure of children in the home was the pri-\nmary factor driving the decline.\nOur study has several strengths and some\nlimitations. The data were taken from several\nlarge surveys conducted over a period of 14\nyears, evaluating national samples of individuals\nwho were representative of the entire U.S. civil-\nian, noninstitutionalized population, and\nWe used a sensitive and specific method for\nserum cotinine analysis, and all assays were con-\nducted under uniform and rigorously con-\ntrolled conditions. Repetitive analyses of com-\nmon samples over time confirmed the absence\nof any unusual variations or drift in the analytic\nmethod. Thus, the substantial decreases in\nserum cotinine we observed over time most\nlikely reflect corresponding decreases in expo-\nsure of nonsmokers to SHS. Nevertheless,\nserum cotinine has limitations as an exposure\nmarker because it can monitor exposures only\nover the previous few days, and because nico-\ntine metabolic differences among groups may\ninfluence the concentrations observed.\nHowever, despite the relatively short half-life\nof cotinine, measures of central tendency\namong groups based on large numbers of indi-\nviduals should provide reasonable estimates of\ngroup steady-state levels. Although the differ-\nences we observed among ethnic/racial groups\nmost likely reflect differences in exposure,\nmetabolic influences cannot be excluded, and\nadditional work is needed to evaluate the rela-\ntive contributions of exposure and metabo-\nlism. Finally, a few occasional smokers could\npossibly have been included inadvertently\namong the more highly exposed participants\nin our study, because some infrequent smokers\nmay have serum cotinine levels < 10 ng/mL.\nThis factor is unlikely to have been significant\namong adults, and it is even less likely to have\nbeen influential among young children\nbecause few children in the 4\u00ad11 age group\nare active smokers.\nConclusion\nSerum cotinine concentrations among non-\nsmokers in the U.S. population declined sig-\nnificantly during the 1990s. This decrease was\nfound in all groups within the population and\nprobably reflects the substantial progress\nmade in reducing the exposure of nonsmokers\nto SHS during this time. Nevertheless, chil-\ndren and non-Hispanic blacks continue to\nshow relatively higher serum cotinine concen-\ntrations, suggesting that these two groups in\nparticular should be the focus of increased\nintervention efforts, and that additional work\nis needed to further encourage restrictions on\nsmoking in the home, automobiles, and other\nlocations when children are present.\nREFERENCES\nBenowitz NL. 1983.
