Chronic care\nmanagement (CCM) has been proposed as an approach to improve care and outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE To determine whether CCM for alcohol and other drug dependence improves\nsubstance use outcomes compared with usual primary care.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The AHEAD study, a randomized trial conducted among\n563 people with alcohol and other drug dependence at a Boston, Massachusetts,\nhospital-based primary care practice. Participants were recruited from September 2006 to\nSeptember 2008 from a freestanding residential detoxification unit and referrals from an\nurban teaching hospital and advertisements; 95% completed 12-month follow-up.\nINTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive CCM (n=282) or no CCM (n=281).\nChronic care management included longitudinal care coordinated with a primary care\nclinician; motivational enhancement therapy; relapse prevention counseling; and on-site\nmedical, addiction, and psychiatric treatment, social work assistance, and referrals (including\nmutual help). The no CCM (control) group received a primary care appointment and a list of\ntreatment resources including a telephone number to arrange counseling.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported abstinence from\nopioids, stimulants, or heavy drinking. Biomarkers were secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS There was no significant difference in abstinence from opioids, stimulants, or heavy\nCI, 0.65-1.10; P=.21). No significant differences were found for secondary outcomes of\naddiction severity, health-related quality of life, or drug problems. No subgroup effects were\nfound except among those with alcohol dependence, in whom CCM was associated with\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among persons with alcohol and other drug dependence,\nCCM compared with a primary care appointment but no CCM did not increase self-reported\nabstinence over 12 months. Whether more intensive or longer-duration CCM is effective\nrequires further investigation.\nAuthor Video Interview at\njama.com\nSupplemental content at\njama.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Author\naffiliations are listed at the end of this\narticle.\nCorresponding Author: Richard\nSaitz, MD, MPH, Clinical Addiction\nResearch and Education Unit, Section\nof General Internal Medicine, 801\nMassachusetts Ave, Second Floor,\n(rsaitz@bu.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\nAlcohol and other drug dependence can be chronic dis-\neases, but they are usually treated episodically.1 Few\nseek treatment,2 and most who do do not complete it.3\nBarriers to care range from impaired motivation to seek help\nto health care organizational impediments, including poor co-\nordination of care for common co-occurring conditions.4,5\nTreatments for substance dependence, particularly lon-\ngitudinal ones, have efficacy.6 Although primary care set-\ntings are designed to address most health care needs with lon-\ngitudinal, comprehensive, and coordinated care and are\ntherefore logical settings in which to manage chronic illness\nlike addiction, they have not adequately addressed sub-\nstancedependence.5 Themainapproachtocare--referraltoad-\ndictiontreatmentprograms--hasbeenunsuccessfullargelybe-\ncause patients do not go to them.4\nChronic care management (CCM) has efficacy for chronic\nmedical and mental health conditions.7-12 Current health care\nreformapproachestoimprovingcarequalityandloweringcosts\nfor patients with chronic illness have turned to CCM as a\nimplementation has been\nthe primary care patient-\ncentered medical home.15\nChronic care manage-\nment is multidisciplinary\npatient-centered proac-\ntive care, a way to orga-\nnize services that pro-\nvides coordination and\nexpertise,andhasbeenef-\nfective for depression,\nmedical illnesses, and to-\nbacco dependence (a substance use disorder).9-12 Trials of in-\ntegrated medical and addiction care have shown some suc-\ncess and suggest that CCM has potential for addiction,16-19\nparticularly since care elements long known to be effective for\naddiction overlap with CCM approaches. We have made the\ncase for why CCM should be implemented in primary care and\nbe effective,7 but no large randomized trials have been pub-\nlished testing the effectiveness of CCM in primary care for sub-\nstance dependence.18\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe Addiction Health Evaluation and Disease Management\n(AHEAD) study was a randomized trial comparing the effect\nof CCM vs usual primary care for patients with alcohol or drug\ndependence. The study was originally designed as 2 trials--a\nstudy of CCM for alcohol dependence and a study of CCM for\ndrug dependence. For efficiency in implementation and to\nmaximize power, the studies were implemented as 1 trial en-\nrolling participants with alcohol or drug dependence.\nParticipants\nStudyparticipantswererecruitedfromSeptember2006toSep-\ntember2008fromafreestandingresidentialdetoxificationunit\n(n=416; 74%), referrals from an urban teaching hospital and ad-\nvertisements (n=53 outpatient, n=4 emergency department,\nn=2 hospital inpatient, and n=88 advertisements and other re-\nInclusion criteria were (1) age 18 years or older; (2) alco-\nhol dependence (determined by the Composite Interna-\ntional Diagnostic Interview Short Form [CIDI-SF])20 and\nheavy drinking in the past 30 days (for men, 5 drinks [13.7 g\nof ethanol each] on 1 occasion at least twice or 22\ndrinks/wk in an average week; 4 drinks on 1 occasion at\nleast twice or 15 drinks/wk for women) or CIDI-SF diagno-\nsis of drug dependence and past 30-day use of psychostimu-\nlants (cocaine, methamphetamine, or prescription amphet-\namine misuse) or heroin or prescription opioid misuse (with\nmisuse defined as use without a prescription, in larger\namounts than prescribed, or for a longer period than pre-\nscribed); and (3) willingness to continue or establish pri-\nmary care at an urban hospital-based practice.

The Institutional Review Board of\nBoston University Medical Campus and Boston Medical\nCenter approved the study, including follow-up of incarcer-\nated participants, and we obtained a Certificate of Confiden-\ntiality from the National Institutes of Health. Participants\nwere compensated on completion of study procedures (not\neach time they updated their contact information.

Chronic care management included longitudinal care\nfor substance dependence and related medical and psychiat-\nric comorbidities and coordination of specialty medical, psy-\nchiatric, and addiction care with primary medical care as\nneeded, facilitated by a shared electronic health record that\nhad specifically created forms. Clinicians maintained a regis-\ntry and proactively reengaged patients who missed follow-up\nfor any reason.\nThe AHEAD clinic was staffed by a multidisciplinary team\nseparate from any primary care staff, including a nurse care\nmanager (NCM), a social worker, and internists (who did not\ndeliver primary care for these participants) and a psychiatrist\nwith addiction expertise. All clinic staff were on site 2 half-\ndays a week for new and follow-up visits. The NCM and social\nworker were on site the remaining weekdays; physicians were\navailable for consultation.\nIntervention participants were asked to attend 2 AHEAD\nclinic visits (90 minutes each), separated by 3 to 4 days, re-\nceiving substance use, psychiatric, medical, and social assess-\nments by all 4 clinicians. The main focus of these visits was to\nengage participants so they would return for ongoing care.\nTreatments for addiction and for medical and psychiatric con-\nditions were begun depending on participants' diagnoses and\nreadiness/priorities. Clinicians were provided with the CIDI-SF\nand 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire results but no other\nresearchassessmentresults.Participantswereescortedtotheir\nfirst visit as soon as possible after randomization. Partici-\npants were offered 4 sessions of motivational enhancement\ntherapy with a social worker (who used the Mini-Mental State\nExamination, SIP, and liver enzyme measurements for pa-\ntient feedback),32 relapse prevention counseling at every con-\ntact by whichever clinician they saw, usually the NCM or so-\ncial worker (which includes assessment of substance use),33 a\nprimary care appointment, and referral to specialty addic-\ntion treatment and mutual help groups, all tailored to clinical\nneeds and patient preferences. Addiction pharmacotherapy\n(naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, buprenorphine, and re-\nferral for methadone) and psychopharmacotherapy were of-\nfered as appropriate.\nContinuing care was delivered during the follow-up\nperiod, including clinic visits, NCM contacts by telephone,\nfacilitated referrals to addiction specialty care, drop-in care,\nand 24-hour pager access. Because participants had varied\ndiagnoses, severity, priorities, and readiness for treatments,\ncare was individualized and there was no set number of vis-\nits (which could be counterproductive if required against a\nparticipant's desires). In general, however, it was common\nfor participants to return in a week after the first 2 visits to\ncheck on progress, complete paperwork needed for social\nservices, transition to additional addiction treatment, begin\naddiction or psychiatric pharmacotherapy, and/or receive\naddiction or mental health counseling. If patients did not\nappear for visits for a month, the NCM contacted them to\nreengage.\nUsual Primary Care\nParticipants in the control group were given a timely appoint-\nment with a named primary care physician and a list of addic-\ntion treatment resources. They had no access to the AHEAD\nclinic. They were also given a telephone number to access 4\nmotivational enhancement therapy sessions. The rationale for\nthis access was to have all services available to both groups so\nthetrialwouldtestCCM,notspecificclinicalinterventions,and\nmotivational enhancement therapy was not routinely avail-\nable outside the study; 9 control participants (3%) had a ses-\nsion.\nParticipant Assessment at Follow-up\nAssessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after en-\nrollment, usually in person. The last participant follow-up\ndisialocarbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) and -glutam-\nyltransferase (GGT) tests were done, and saliva and hair\nsamples were tested for drugs (saliva for opioids, cocaine,\nmethamphetamines, benzodiazepines, and tetrahydrocan-\nnabinol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [Friends\nMedical Laboratory Inc] within a 1- to 3-day window34; hair for\nopioids and cocaine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nand gas chromatography\u00admass spectroscopy [Psychemedics\nCorp] within a 90-day window).\nIn the first year of the study, CDT and GGT measurements\nwere obtained only for those with baseline heavy alcohol use\nand dependence, and hair and saliva were tested for those with\ndrug use and dependence; thereafter, all were tested because\nit became financially feasible to do so and having data on all\nsubsequent participants was thought to be better than not hav-\ning it.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was self-reported 30-day abstinence\nfrom stimulants, opioids, and heavy alcohol use (four or more\n13.7-gethanoldrinksforwomenand5drinksformeninaday)\nat 3, 6, and 12 months. Stimulant (cocaine, amphetamine) and\nopioid (heroin, other opioid misuse) use were assessed by the\nASI.23 Alcohol use was assessed using the 30-day timeline fol-\nlow-back calendar method.22 Additional outcomes of particu-\nlar interest were 30-day abstinence from stimulants, opioids,\nand any alcohol use; alcohol and drug problems (measured by\nthe SIP-2R and SIP-D); any hospitalization; and any emer-\ngency department visits. Other outcomes were CDT 1.7% or\nhigher, GGT 66 IU/L or higher; detection of opioids or cocaine\nby hair testing and detection of cocaine, opioids, or metham-\nphetamine by saliva testing; alcohol and drug addiction se-\nverity (measured by the ASI); number of heavy drinking days;\nhealth-related quality of life (SF-12 Mental Component Sum-\nResearch Original Investigation Chronic Care Management for Substance Dependence\nmary [MCS] and Physical Component Summary [PCS] scores;\nment utilization (including mutual help group meeting atten-\ndance [eg, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous], in-\npatient or outpatient addiction treatment, and medication for\naddiction [eg, buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, acam-\nprosate, disulfiram]).\nStatistical Analysis\nAlthough longitudinal regression models were used in the\nanalyses, for the purposes of power calculations a simpler\nsetting using a single time point was considered (we antici-\npated that this was conservative because the power for\nthe longitudinal analysis would be higher). It was assumed\nthat 30% of control group participants would be abstinent\nat follow-up. This estimate was based on both the\nducted by the authors testing the effectiveness of a multidis-\nciplinary clinic at a detoxification unit.36 We hypothesized\nthat the proportion in the intervention group with abstinence\nwould be 50% (ie, an absolute difference of 20% between\ngroups). Allowing for 25% attrition from 320 participants in\neach of the alcohol and drug dependence subgroups, the\nstudy provided 86% power to detect a 20% between-group\ndifference in the proportions with abstinence from drug and\nheavy alcohol use for each subgroup (2-sided =.05), The\nstudy was therefore expected to have greater power to detect\nthe same effect size in the full sample. Recruitment did not\ncontinue to the originally planned 640 participants because\nsome participants had both alcohol and drug dependence.\nThe combined study exceeded the originally planned sample\nsizes (and follow-up rates) for each of the separate sub-\ndependence).\nThe primary outcome was analyzed using generalized es-\ntimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models adjusting\nfor dependence and recent use status (alcohol, drug, or both,\nthe randomization stratification variable) and time. The time-\naveragedeffectoftheinterventionwasthemaininterestinthis\nstudy,andtheresultsreportedintheprimaryanalysesaremain\neffects from models that do not include interaction terms. An\nindependence working correlation was used and empirical\nstandard errors are reported for all GEE analyses. Confirma-\ntory analyses were performed adjusting for race and depres-\nsive symptoms, 2 factors that differed significantly between\ngroups at baseline. Additional binary outcomes were ana-\nlyzed using the same approach. For the continuous outcomes\nof SF-12 Mental and Physical Component Summary scores, we\nfit linear mixed-effects regression models. Number of heavy\ndrinking days was analyzed using GEE overdispersed Poisson\nmodels.\nFor alcohol and drug problems (SIP-2R and SIP-D scores)\nandforASIdrugandalcoholscores,thedistributionswerenon-\nnormal and appropriate transformations were not found.\nTherefore,SIP-2RandSIP-Dscores,nonnegativeintegers,were\nanalyzedusingGEEoverdispersedPoissonmodelsbecausethe\nvariance exceeded the mean. Confirmatory analyses were also\nperformed using negative binomial regression models and lin-\near mixed-effects models, and the results were consistent\nacross all models for both the SIP-2R and SIP-D scores. For ASI\ndrug and alcohol scores, each outcome was categorized into\nmultiple ordered categories and analyzed using GEE propor-\ntional odds models. Biological outcomes were analyzed using\nlogistic regression models.\nAll analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat ba-\nsis,whereinstudyparticipantswereanalyzedaccordingtoran-\ndomized group regardless of whether they received their as-\nsigned intervention. Missing data were not imputed; only the\nobserved data were used. However, a sensitivity analysis was\nconducted using multiple imputation to address missing fol-\nlow-updatafortheprimaryoutcomeofabstinencefromstimu-\nlants, opioids, and heavy alcohol use. Baseline variables used\nin the imputation were dependence and recent use status (al-\ncohol, drug, or both), randomized group, age, sex, and race.\nA priori\u00addefined subgroup analyses for the above outcomes\nwere conducted among those with alcohol dependence and\nthose with drug dependence.\nIn post hoc\u00addefined subgroups, we analyzed interven-\ntion effects among baseline opioid and stimulant users in the\ndrug dependence subgroup separately. In analyses of the pri-\nmary outcome, we also tested interactions between the inter-\nvention and time, medical comorbidity, substance abuse\u00ad\nrelated medical comorbidities, intention to change alcohol or\ndrug use, homelessness, SF-12 Mental Component Summary\nscore, addiction treatment in past 3 months, and recruitment\nsite, but there were no meaningful interactions (eTables 1-4 in\nthe Supplement). In an exploratory analysis, we tested the ef-\nfect of the number of AHEAD clinic visits using the longitudi-\nnal regression models described above.

Components of CCM have been effective for\naddictions (eg, case management, co-location, and integra-\ntion of care),7 but CCM for addiction in primary care has not\nbeen tested in a randomized trial.18 Willenbring and Olson16\ndemonstrated efficacy (abstinence, mortality) of co-location\nof care for medically ill veterans with alcoholism in a special\nalcohol clinic.

She and the NCM connected patients to ad-\ndiction treatment and mutual help groups in the community\nwith the ability for \"warm handoffs\" by knowing individuals\nwho work in or go to those resources.

We\nbelieve that the small increase in use of addiction treatments\nthat are modestly efficacious for only some subsets of people\nwith addictions and limited delivery of evidence-based prac-\ntices for addiction in the community were likely the main rea-\nsons for our findings.\nSecond, although adherence to treatment is a problem for\nall people with chronic illnesses, it is particularly important\nfor those with addictions. Most people with addictions do not\nseek help.2 Even when they do, their substance use directly\naffects their motivation and ability to adhere to care. Third,\nmany people with addictions have co-occurring mental health\nconditions and substantial social problems. Although CCM is\ndesigned to address complex problems, it may simply not be\nenough to overcome the impaired motivation and myriad se-\nvere consequences experienced by patients with addictions.\nMethodologicalconsiderationsmightalsoexplainthefind-\nings. Most study participants were dependent on both alco-\nhol and other drugs, recruited from a detoxification unit, had\nsubstantial mental health symptoms, had recently been home-\nless, and were not necessarily seeking addiction treatment (de-\nspite relatively high reported readiness to change their use).\nThe findings may not apply to addiction treatment\u00adseeking or\nless severely affected populations or to populations recruited\nelsewhere. Although an effect is plausible, our analyses found\nno impact on the intervention efficacy of any of these factors.\nFurthermore, studies of CCM for other conditions have se-\nlected severely affected patients with comorbidity and social\nneeds because they are the ones who need the services and\ncould benefit, and these studies have found efficacy.11 Among\npeople with addictions seeking treatment, favorable out-\ncomes are already good without CCM (eg, 74% with no heavy\ndrinkingorproblemswithalcoholismpharmacotherapy).41 The\nneedforwhatCCMoffersisgreatestforthosewithsevere,com-\nplex problems, who are not the easiest to engage in care.\nAswithpriortrials,16,17 weassessedmainoutcomesbyself-\nreport. Biological tests are inadequate for detecting sub-\nstance use, particularly when it is not recent. Substance use\nproblems and health-related quality of life are best assessed\nby self-report. We used validated tools, assured participants\nTable 3.

Un-\ninsurance was not a barrier. Intervention participants had, on\naverage, 6 CCM visits and reported high-quality CCM, and the\nintervention increased exposure to addiction treatment and\npharmacotherapy.\nAssessment effects, the list of resources, primary care ap-\npointment, or the 3% of controls who received 1 or more mo-\ntivational enhancement counseling sessions could have bi-\nased the study to the null. However, those minimal control\ngroup exposures and relatively less intense assessments of 6\nhours over a year (compared with longer ones in positive al-\ncohol treatment trials) are unlikely to have had a major effect\non a severely affected group.41 Of note, the whole group im-\nproved over time; the change most likely was due to many par-\nticipants having been enrolled at a detoxification unit, when\nthey were at a more severe point in their addiction and sought\nsome help (a logical time to offer CCM). Assessment effects in\ntreatment trials are inconsistent and poorly understood43 and\noften absent in studies of people not seeking treatment.44 Con-\ntamination is also an unlikely explanation of our findings be-\ncause controls had no access to addiction CCM in the study or\nelsewhere.\nChronic care management for substance dependence had\na small effect on problems among those with alcohol depen-\ndence but was ineffective for improving substance use, re-\nlated clinical outcomes, or health care utilization. Providing\nmore intensive or longer-duration CCM might be effective, or\nit might be effective for less severe primary care patients or\nsmall subgroups of patients with low severity and few comor-\nbidities or social problems who are eager to enter addiction\ncare. It is also possible that the effects of CCM for addiction\nwill not be seen until the health system in which it is imple-\nmented is more supportive of integrated care.\nCurrent health care reforms in the United States include a\nfocus on CCM as a solution in patient-centered medical homes\nto reduce chronic disease burden and to reduce costs (both of\nwhich are among the highest for those with addiction), in part\nbecause numerous studies have found such benefits for medi-\ncal and mental health conditions.14 The model is being widely\ndisseminated in primary care settings by private and govern-\nment health plans, health care delivery organizations, and\nhealth policy leaders anticipating accountable care organiza-\nTable 4.

In the absence of randomized trials for substance-\ndependent patients, benefits of CCM are being anticipated and\nimplementation is proceeding. Our findings at least raise the\npossibility that not all chronic diseases are the same and that\nCCM may not have the same effect across conditions for which\ncomplexity varies, a possibility that should be part of the con-\nversation when models of care are implemented widely. Even\nthough CCM is effective for a number of chronic conditions,\nit may be premature to assume that CCM will be the solution\nto improve the quality of care for and reduce costs of patients\nwith addiction. Further research is warranted to determine\nwhether more intensive or longer-duration CCM or CCM de-\nsigned differently might do so.\nConclusion\nIn this trial of persons with alcohol and other drug depen-\ndence, CCM, compared with a primary care appointment but\nno CCM, did not decrease use or overall addiction conse-\nquences.\nAuthor Affiliations: Clinical Addiction Research\nand Education Unit, Boston Medical Center, Boston,\nMassachusetts (Saitz, Cheng, Kim, Meli, Samet);\nSection of General Internal Medicine, Department\nof Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston\nUniversity School of Medicine, Boston,\nMassachusetts (Saitz, Cheng, Kim, Meli, Samet);\nDepartment of Community Health Sciences, Boston\nUniversity School of Public Health, Boston,\nMassachusetts (Saitz, Samet); Department of\nBiostatistics, Boston University School of Public\nHealth, Boston, Massachusetts (Cheng); Data\nCoordinating Center, Boston University School of\nPublic Health, Boston, Massachusetts (Winter,\nAllensworth-Davies, Lloyd-Travaglini); Dr\nAllensworth-Davies is now with the Department of\nHealth Sciences, Cleveland State University College\nof Science and Health Professions, Cleveland, Ohio\n(Allensworth-Davies).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Saitz had full access to all\nof the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Saitz, Meli, Samet.\nAcquisition of data: Saitz, Kim, Meli, Samet.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Saitz, Meli.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Saitz, Cheng, Winter, Kim,\nAllensworth-Davies, Lloyd-Travaglini, Samet.\nStatistical analysis: Cheng, Winter, Lloyd-Travaglini.\nObtained funding: Saitz, Meli, Samet.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Saitz,\nKim, Meli, Allensworth-Davies.\nStudy supervision: Saitz, Meli.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have\ncompleted and submitted the ICMJE Form for\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.
