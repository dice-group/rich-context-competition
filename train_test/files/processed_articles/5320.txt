The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (Trivers and Willard, 1973) proposes that parents\nshould vary their offspring sex ratios toward the sex that maximizes reproductive success.\nWhereas female reproductive success in populations where males compete for access to\nmates remains relatively stable, male reproductive success depends on ability to access\nmates. Males in good condition, or those exhibiting traits that facilitate mating, therefore,\nshould produce more offspring than males in poor condition. Through the production of\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\nsons, then, parents in good condition could ensure more grand-offspring than parents in\npoor condition. Parents in poor condition, in contrast, could maximize the number of their\ngrand-offspring through the production of daughters. Although the Trivers-Willard\nhypothesis has received considerable support in the animal literature, the data are not\nalways consistent (reviewed in Brown, 2001; Clutton-Brock and Iason, 1986; Hewison and\nGaillard, 1999; Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, 1993). This is likely because researchers have\ninvestigated maternal characteristics thought to reflect physical condition (e.g., body size,\nnutrition, parity), whereas the most convincing evidence comes from studies that focused\non behavioral traits, namely, dominance prior to conception (Sheldon and West, 2004). For\nexample, in a population of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), Paul and Kuester (1990)\nfound that females with high dominance rank at conception produced more male offspring\nthan females with low dominance rank. In addition, males born to high ranking females\nproduced more offspring than those born to low ranking females (Paul and Kuester, 1990;\nPaul, Kuester, and Arnemann, 1992). Reliance of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis on\nphysiological condition as a determinant for sex ratio adjustment, therefore, might be too\nexclusive. The investigation of heritable environmental influences, such as social rank and\nresource availability, and their possible associated epigenetic mechanisms, in determining\nindividual offspring sex ratios could be more informative in enhancing our understanding\nof sex ratio adjustment.\nIn humans, both physiological and psychological characteristics of parents have\nbeen associated with offspring sex ratio. Interestingly, studies have shown a tendency for\nparents of sons to have characteristics associated with male reproductive success, and for\nparents of daughters to have characteristics associated with female reproductive success.\nFor example, taller and heavier parents have more sons than shorter and lighter parents\n(Kanazawa, 2005), and more physically attractive parents have more daughters than less\nattractive parents (Kanazawa, 2007). Lower (e.g., more masculinized) digit ratios, which\nare thought to reflect greater exposure to androgens prenatally, have also been associated\nwith higher offspring sex ratios (e.g., more sons than daughters). Manning and associates\n(2002) found that parents with lower ratios of the 2nd to the 4th digit of their hands (2D:4D)\nhad more sons than daughters. Similarly, Ventura, Gomes, Pita, Neto, and Taylor (2013)\nfound that the 2D:4D ratios of mothers of newborn male infants were significantly higher\nthan those of mothers of newborn female infants, and that testosterone in the amniotic fluid\nwas negatively associated with 2D:4D in the female infants. Lower 2D:4D may indicate\ndominance and masculinity to others (Neave, Laing, Fink, and Manning, 2003) as well as\nself-reported physical attractiveness (Manning and Quinton, 2007). Behaviorally, high\nstatus males (not females, but see Grant and Yang, 2003) such as billionaires (Cameron and\nDalerum, 2009) and past presidents (Betzig and Weber, 1995) have more sons than would\nbe expected by chance. Dominant mothers and less sexually restricted parents (e.g.,\nrequiring less commitment before engaging in sex, having more sexual partners) also have\nSpecific parental physiological and psychological characteristics could have\nadaptive value for humans. The Maternal Dominance Hypothesis (Grant, 1998) proposes\nthat the conception of one sex or the other is under the control of the mother, where the\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\nlikelihood of an ovum being fertilized by a Y-bearing chromosome is facilitated by higher\nmaternal levels of testosterone. Behaviorally, the Maternal Dominance Hypothesis suggests\nthat testosterone levels fluctuate with dominance, thus more dominant women should\nconceive sons than daughters. In fact, Grant and France (2001) found that women who\nscored higher in dominance had higher serum testosterone than those who scored lower.\nFewer studies have examined the effects of testosterone in women, but several studies have\nshown that women with a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), which is indicative of higher\ncirculating testosterone levels and lower ratings of female physical attractiveness (reviewed\nin Singh, 2002), have significantly more sons than daughters (Manning, Anderton, and\nmen, testosterone influences a variety of characteristics including facial masculinity\nmaking it plausible that it has similar effects in women. Compared to mothers of daughters,\ntherefore, mothers of sons, could exhibit more masculine or less feminine physical and\npersonality traits, which would in turn influence the manifestation of these traits in their\nsons. Fathers could exhibit similar sex-of-offspring differences. Specifically, characteristics\nthat enhance male mating success, such as dominance and masculinity, might be more\nextreme in fathers of sons, which would work to increase their reproductive success by\nincreasing their attractiveness to potential mates and increasing their success in competing\nwith other men for access to mates.\nDifferences in the expression of masculine or feminine mating characteristics in\nparents raises the interesting possibility that self-perception of these characteristics, or the\npresence of some interoceptive cue such as steroid hormone concentration, influences\nindividuals' predictions of their offspring sexes. This possibility remains unknown. In the\npresent study, we investigated the relationship between sex-of-offspring prediction and the\nhormonal and personality characteristics of men and women. Specifically, within sexes, we\nhypothesized that individuals who predict a boy for their first child would exhibit higher\ndominance scores, sociosexual orientation scores, and testosterone levels, as well as lower\ndigit ratios, and estradiol than those who predicted they would have a girl. In contrast,\nindividuals who predict a girl would exhibit lower dominance scores, sociosexual\norientation scores, and testosterone levels, as well as higher digit ratios and concentration\nof estradiol than those who predict a boy.\nMaterials and Methods\nProcedure\n20.88 years, SD = 2.74) undergraduates, na\u00efve to both the purpose and hypotheses of the\nstudy, completed a questionnaire package and provided a saliva sample and a photocopy of\ntheir hands in exchange for course credit. All study procedures were subject to review and\nprior approval by the Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Board. All participants\nprovided written informed consent.\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\nMeasures\nDominance. We assessed self-reported dominance using the Simple Adjective Test\n(SAT) (Grant, 1998), a brief, 64-item checklist containing 13 items measuring dominance\n(e.g., influential, strong, powerful) and 53 filler items (e.g., hopeful, shy, depressed).\nParticipants checked off the items that applied to them and a score out of 13, one for each\nchecked dominance item, was calculated.\nSociosexual orientation. Sexual restrictiveness, or the degree to which an individual\nis comfortable engaging in sex without commitment, was assessed using the sociosexual\norientation inventory (SOI) (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). The questionnaire involves a\nseries of questions (e.g., \"How many different partners do you foresee yourself having sex\nwith during the next five years?\"), and statements (e.g., \"Sex without love is OK\") to which\nthe participant must rate their agreement on a 9-point Likert scale. Overall scores were\ncalculated based on participant responses, with higher scores reflecting less restricted\norientations and lower scores reflecting more restricted orientations.\nReproductive ambition and preferences. We created a questionnaire based on\nquestions used by Deady, Law-Smith, Sharp, and Al-Dujaili (2006) to assess reproductive\nambition and sex-of-offspring prediction and preferences. We asked: \"How\nbroody/maternal (or paternal) do you feel compared to others of your age?\", \"How\nimportant to you is having children?\", \"How important to you is having a career?\",\n\"Ideally, how many children would you like to have?\", and \"Ideally, at what age would you\nlike to have your first child?\". The first three questions were answered using 7-point Likert\nscales, and the remaining two were open-ended. We created an overall score indicative of\nreproductive ambition by adding the responses from the first three questions (the last was\nreversed scored). Lower scores reflected a lesser tendency/importance for having family\nthan career. The remaining question was analyzed separately. For 3 females and 1 male\nwho did not want children, we replaced their ideal age response with the mean age for their\ncorresponding sex. To assess the sex-of-offspring prediction, we asked, \"What sex of child\nwould you predict that you would have first?\". To ensure that predictions were not\nreflecting simple preferences, we also asked about sex-of-offspring preferences: \"If you\ncould only have ONE child, what sex would you prefer to have?\" and \"Assuming you have\nmore than one child, if you could choose, what would you prefer for the sex of your first-\nborn child?\". Questions were answered in forced choice, male or female.\nSalivary hormones. Participants were asked not to eat, drink, smoke, or brush their\nteeth for one hour prior to the sample collection. We asked about medication use (including\nhormonal birth control), chronic health or endocrine problems, and menstrual cycle. We\ncollected 3mL of saliva from each participant into untreated polypropylene tubes via\npassive drool. Each sample was immediately frozen at -20C for later analysis. Samples\nwere assayed for testosterone and estradiol using enzyme-linked immunoassay techniques\nat Yerkes National Primate Research Centre at Emory University.

Following removal of rings and jewelry, a thin line was drawn (similar\nto Bailey and Hurd, 2005) on the proximal creases of the index and ring fingers of\nparticipants' left and right hands. A photocopy was taken of both hands together, palms\ndown. The lengths of the 2nd and 4th digits of each hand were measured twice, by two\nindependent raters, from the center of the tip of the finger to the center of the proximal\ncrease, measuring to the nearest 0.05cm using a standard ruler. Due to power outage, scans\nfor 2 males were not collected. One scan was excluded due to poor quality. Inter-rater\nreliability was r = 0.99 for both the right and left hands. An average of the two\nmeasurements were taken for each participant and analyzed.\nData Analysis\nPreferences and predictions for sex of offspring were compared using Pearson's chi\nsquare tests. Within sexes, we compared personality scores, hormone levels, and 2D:4D\nmeasurements of individuals who predicted they would have a boy first to those who\npredicted they would have a girl first using independent samples t-tests. All hypotheses\nwere directional and one-tailed tests were used. Blood contamination or error was\nsuspected for 3 female and 3 male saliva samples. As their values were greater than 3\nstandard deviations from the mean for their respective sexes, they were excluded from any\nhormone analyses.\nResults\nWe found an overall preference for a boy compared to a girl as both an only child\nsignificant overall difference in prediction between boy and girl for men or women (p =\n0.17), indicating that predictions did not reflect simple preferences for either sex. There\nwere also no significant differences between dominance and sociosexual orientation scores,\ntestosterone and estradiol concentrations, or digit ratios of males and females who preferred\na boy compared to a girl for either their only or first born child (p > 0.05), indicating that\nneither personality or hormone profile influenced general sex of offspring preferences.\nWomen\nWomen who predicted that they would have a boy first (mean \u00b1 SE = 3.60 \u00b1 0.48, n\n= 30) scored significantly higher than those who predicted a girl first (mean \u00b1 SE = 2.36 \u00b1\n= 1.56, p = 0.06, one-tailed). Since hormonal contraceptive use\naffects both SOI (Oinonen et al., 2008) and dominance (Grant and France, 2001; Stanton\nand Edelstein, 2009) in females, we explored these differences in users versus non-users.\nensure that predictions were not dependent on contraceptive use, we separately analyzed\nthe SOI scores of users and non-users who predicted sons compared to daughters. No\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\nsignificant differences were found (Users: p = 0.31; Non-users: p = 0.20). No significant\ndifferences were found between users and non-users for the SAT (p = 0.74).\nNo significant differences were observed between women who predicted they\nwould have a boy first and those who predicted they would have a girl for reproductive\nambition (p = 0.47), ideal age to have first child (p = 0.30), or testosterone (p = 0.24),\nFigure 1.

Right and left hand digit ratios for men predicting boy compared to girl as first\nborn child\nDiscussion\nThe present study examined the relationship between masculine and feminine\npsychological and physiological characteristics and an individual's prediction of sex for\ntheir first-born offspring. Taken together, our results suggest that whatever the mechanism,\nindividuals are somehow sensitive to their own relative masculinity or femininity, and that\nthis alters the predictions they make about their offspring sexes. We found that women who\npredicted they would conceive a boy were more dominant and less sexually restricted than\nwomen who predicted they would conceive a girl. Although we are unable to confirm the\naccuracy of these predictions, our results are in line with previous studies showing that\nmore dominant and less sexually restrictive women have more sons than daughters\n2009). These results also agree with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, in that mothers who\nexhibit characteristics associated with high male reproductive success (in this case,\ndominant and sexually less restrictive) should produce more sons than daughters.\nMales who predicted they would have a girl as their first born exhibited higher\nsalivary concentrations of estradiol as well as higher, or more feminine, 2D:4D ratios,\nsuggesting less exposure to androgens prenatally. To our knowledge, no studies have\ninvestigated the relationship between offspring sex ratio and parental estradiol; however,\n2D:4D and offspring sex ratio were negatively correlated in previous research (Manning et\nal., 2002). It is unclear what effect, if any, higher estradiol might have upon male\nreproductive success, but 2D:4D has been negatively associated with facial dominance and\nmasculinity as perceived by others (Neave et al., 2003) as well as physical and behavioral\naggression (Bailey and Hurd, 2005; Kuepper and Hennig, 2007) in males, suggesting that\nindividuals with a higher 2D:4D exhibit less male-typical behavior than those with a lower\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\none. With regard to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, these results support the idea that\nfathers who do not exhibit characteristics associated with high male reproductive success\n(in this case, correlates of high estradiol and 2D:4D ratios) should produce more daughters\nthan sons. In contrast, it could be that fathers of daughters possess characteristics that are\nmore likely to enhance the reproductive success of daughters than sons. Interestingly,\nwomen who reported wanting to have more children had higher urinary estrogen levels and\nmore feminine faces than women who reported wanting to have fewer children (Law Smith\net al., 2012). Kanazawa (2007) proposed that parental offspring sex ratio should reflect the\ndegree to which parental traits are associated with male or female reproductive success,\nwith parents of sons exhibiting more male-typical traits and parents of daughters exhibiting\nmore female-typical traits. The direct inclusion of femininity measures in future work\nwould enable a test of this hypothesis.\nIf individuals are able to accurately predict the sex of their offspring prior to ever\nconceiving a pregnancy, an intriguing possibility that follows is that these predictions affect\nmating behavior and preferences in line with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Specifically,\nwomen who anticipate that they will have sons might choose mates with characteristics\nimportant for male reproductive success, whereas those who anticipate they will have\ndaughters might choose mates with characteristics important for female reproductive\nsuccess. One possibility is facial preferences. Facial architecture is thought to reflect\nhormone levels, with androgens being responsible for bone growth, such as brow ridges\nand lower jaw development, and estrogens being responsible for the distribution of fats\n(Johnston Hagel, Franklin, Fink, and Grammer, 2001). In men, high testosterone was\nassociated with a more masculine face, but not necessarily a more attractive one (Penton-\nVoak and Chen, 2004), highlighting individual differences in women's preferences. No\nstudies have determined whether facial preferences are related to offspring sex ratio,\nhowever, our finding that men who predict they will have a girl rather than a boy have\nhigher estradiol and more feminine 2D:4D ratios suggest that they might also have more\nfeminine or less masculine faces. Whereas some studies have identified an overall\npreference for masculine features (DeBruine et al., 2006; 2010), others have found that\nwomen generally preferred faces with feminine features (Perrett et al., 1998; Rhodes,\nHickford, and Jeffery, 2000). More attractive women have been found to prefer more\nmasculine faces than less attractive women (Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, and Perrett, 2001;\nPenton-Voak et al., 2003), and mothers and fathers who were rated as being \"very\nattractive\" by an objective third party rater were significantly more likely to have a\ndaughter than a son as their first child (Kanazawa, 2007). The inclusion of measures of the\npredicted or actual offspring sex ratio of both the individual making choices and the target\nindividual in future studies might help to clarify this issue.\nWomen who predict they would have a son might prefer more masculine faces.\nGangestad and Simpson (1990) proposed that less sexually restricted women would be\nmore receptive to mating with reproductively successful men (e.g., those having many\nsexual partners), as their genes would be beneficial for enhancing the reproductive success\nof sons. Interestingly, Waynforth, Delwadia, and Camm (2005) found that women with a\nless restricted sociosexual orientation preferred more masculine male faces than women\nwith a more restricted one. Similarly, Simpson and Gangestad (1992) found that less\nInfant sex prediction and sex-typical variates\nrestricted women placed more emphasis on the attractiveness of partners than those who\nwere more restricted. We did not find an association between male offspring prediction and\nwomen's salivary testosterone in our study; however, Welling et al. (2007) found that\nwomen preferred a masculine male face more often than a feminine one when their salivary\ntestosterone levels were high, which in combination with Grant and France (2001) who\nfound that women with higher dominance also had higher serum levels of testosterone,\nsuggests that mothers of sons prefer more masculine mates. It is unclear why we did not see\nan association between dominance and salivary testosterone in our study; however, Grant\n(1998) suggested that state testosterone is the best predictor of offspring sex close to time\nof conception. Given the exploratory nature of our study, and that our participants were not\nactively trying to achieve pregnancy, we did not attempt to control for this possibility.\nFuture studies, therefore, should examine the relationship between offspring sex ratio \u00ad\neither predicted or actual - and preferences for facial masculinity in male mates, with\nspecific consideration being given to menstrual cycle phase and time to conception.\nIt is also important to note the possibility that our findings are actually the result of\na general self-perception of an individual's masculinity or femininity relative to their own\nsex. While we did not directly investigate this, the psychological assessment of one's own\nexpression of masculine or feminine characteristics could be important for mating behavior.\nIndividuals who perceive themselves to be more masculine might believe they should be\nmore likely to have a son compared to a daughter whereas those individuals who perceive\nthemselves to be more feminine might believe they should be more likely to have a\ndaughter than a son. In turn, they might seek mates that fulfill these perceived roles, namely\na more masculine or more feminine mate. This possibility should be tested in future studies.\nIn sum, we found that the personality and hormone profiles of men and women are\nrelated to their prediction for sex of future offspring. Despite our relatively small sample of\nundergraduate students, these individual differences reflect characteristics that could be\nimportant for influencing both the reproductive success and mating behavior and\npreferences of men and women.\n"
