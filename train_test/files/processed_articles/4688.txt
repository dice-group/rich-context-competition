His book Eye Movements and Vision,\npublished in Russian in 1965 and translated into English by Basil Haigh in 1967, has had a\nprofound influence on recent approaches to the study of eye movements and vision. The\nimpact has been widespread across a range of disciplines, and his book now stands as\none of the single most cited publications in the area. It is therefore somewhat surprising\nthat so little is known about the man himself and his career in science. In this paper we\npresent some new details about Yarbus, consider the impact of his eye movement studies on\ncontemporary vision research, and revisit and extend Yarbus's now-classic exploration of how\nthe instructions given to an observer can influence the observer's eye movement behaviour.\nOur report differs from Yarbus's work by exploring inspection behaviour when looking at\na photographic image of a single individual (Yarbus himself) rather than a painted scene\ncontaining several individuals and a range of objects (Ilya Yefimovich Repin's The Unexpected\nVisitor(1)).\nThe name Yarbus is known to almost every student of experimental psychology. Moreover, fig-\nures from his book are reproduced in most textbooks on perception. Despite this widespread\nexposure to his name and to his research, very little is known to English readers about Yarbus\n(1) The original Russian title of this painting has also been translated as They Did Not Expect Him.\n8 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nhimself. Almost all that is available can be gleaned from the few lines printed inside the\nEnglish edition of Eye Movements and Vision:\nAl'fred Luk'yanovich Yarbus was born in Moscow in 1914. He was graduated from the Faculty of\nPhysics of Moscow University in 1941 and was a scientific assistant at the Institute of Biophysics\nof the Academy of Sciences of the USSR until 1963. He is presently a senior scientist at the\nInstitute for Problems of Information Transmission of the Academy. In 1964 he received the\ndegree of Doctor of Biological Sciences for his work on `The Role of Eye Movements in Vision'\nNo further biographical details appear in the book; nor were we able to trace any further\nsubstantive information until recently. Thanks to personal communications with a number\nof researchers, we have been able to piece together the following brief outline of Yarbus's\nprofessional and personal life.\nYarbus was born on April 3, 1914, in Moscow to Polish parents who had immigrated to\nRussia some years earlier because of parental disapproval of their marriage. His natural\nfather died when he was young, and his mother remarried Lukian Yarbus, from whom\nAl'fred Luk'yanovich took his name. Yarbus studied in the Department of Physics at the\nMoscow Lomonosov State University between 1935 and 1941. After graduating, he worked as\nan engineer in Moscow, before his military service, which spanned from 1942 to 1946 and\nincluded time in the Far East on the Japanese front (see figure 1a for an image of Yarbus during\nthis period). During this time, Yarbus was married to Shalgovsakaya Yevgnia Yohanesovna,\nwho was of German extraction. They had a daughter Francheska, born in 1942 while Yarbus\nwas at the front on war service. Francheska has subsequently followed a successful and\ndistinguished career as an artist. She married Yuri Norstein, and the two are internationally\nfamous for their animated cartoons.\nFollowing the war, Al'fred Luk'yanovich worked as a researcher at the Institute of\nCrystallography before completing a PhD on visual illusions in 1950 under the supervision\nof Professors Kravkov (sensory physiology) and Rubenstein (psychology). Following this,\nYarbus obtained a position as a researcher and then (from 1957) as a senior research fellow\nFigure 1. Al'fred Luk'yanovich Yarbus (1914\u00ad86).

(b) Yarbus photographed during the 1980s (photograph courtesy of Galina Rozhkova).\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 9\nat the Biophysics Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which in 1963 became part\nof the newly established Institute for Problems in Information Transmission. His work on\nvisual illusions subsequently led to interest in eye movements and to the psychological\nand biophysical effects of stabilised images. At that time he became one of a group of\ntalented scientists that included mathematicians, physicists, and physicians. The leaders\nof this interdisciplinary laboratory were Michael Moiiseevich Bongard (the founder of\nRussian research in artificial intelligence and pattern recognition) and Michael Sergeevich\nSmirnov (an expert in sensory physiology and communication). The technician of the\ngroup, Vadim Ivanovich Chernishev, was the first to make suction cups to attach to the\neyes. Initially these were largely impractical due to discomfort for the wearer; it was Yarbus\nwho proposed refinements to the technique, which, after a number of trials and errors, led\nto the development of a range of suction devices for eye tracking (see below and figure 2b).\nThese devices were used successfully throughout his research and were adopted by other\nlaboratories for similar research studies. For his work using suction devices to measure eye\nmovements, Yarbus was awarded his second academic degree, a PhD in Biological Science in\nYarbus's eye movement work progressed in the 1950s and 1960s, with regular journal\npublications. In 1965 he wrote the book which, in its 1967 English translation (Eye Movements\nand Vision), has become a well-known classic. Basil Haigh was a noted translator, and reviews\nof Yarbus's book often commended the quality and the clarity of the translation. Haigh was\ntrained in medicine and learned Russian when he served in the British embassy in Moscow\ntranslated many texts by Russian neuroscientists, particularly the books of A R Luria.\nYarbus's work was already known to Western scientists, in part because many of the\narticles were published in Biofizika, a Russian journal whose first issue appeared in 1955,\nand which maintained an English version, Biophysics. Pick (1964) wrote a review of Russian\nresearch on perception in which Yarbus was mentioned briefly, but wider recognition was to\nfollow. Sporadic citations appear in articles from most of the leading laboratories working\nwould be the case after the book was published: see, for example, the extensive attention\nMost of Yarbus's early work appears as single-author publications, although his name\ncan be found on multi-author works, including some in the Western European literature\ncoauthored with the distinguished Soviet psychologist and neuroscientist Alexander Ro-\nmanovich Luria (Karpov, Luria, and Yarbus 1968; Luria, Karpov, and Yarbus 1966; Luria,\nPravdina-Vinskaya, and Yarbus 1963). These few publications are the first in the literature\nconsidering highly diagnostic features of oculomotor behaviour after differently localised\ninstances of brain damage. Despite the wide international and interdisciplinary recognition\nof Yarbus's work (or perhaps due to it), this was evidently not an easy period in his life,\nboth professionally and personally. Some of his co-workers appear to have resented their\nexclusion from the credit, and relations in the laboratory became difficult. Also, other work\nin the laboratory gave rise to debate about the generalisability of some of his findings (see\nRozhkova, Nikolaev, and Shchadrin 1982).\nYarbus divorced and remarried at the age of 53, and a son, Anton (currently a prose writer\nliving in Moscow), was born to this marriage. He subsequently pursued a more lone individual\ncourse of research and a series of ten papers entitled \"Work of the human visual system\"\nappeared in Biofizika between 1975 and 1980. He was interested in a kind of analogue\nelectrical modelling of human vision during the last two decades of his life, conducting\n10 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nnumerous experiments on subthreshold summation of brightness and colour stimuli. In\n1986 Yarbus developed cancer and died. Figure 1b shows Yarbus in a photograph thought\nto have been taken during the 1980s. Yarbus's career spanned a sensitive period for Soviet\nscience and its support; we refer the reader to Krementsov (1997) for a survey of Soviet science\nduring this period.\n2.1 Eye movements and vision\nThe original Russian version of Yarbus's book was entitled     \n, the direct translation being The Role of Eye Motion in Vision Processes (DeAngelus\nand Pelz 2009). This monograph was the culmination of several years of research by Yarbus,\nduring which he developed a novel set of devices for recording and compensating for eye\nmovements. An English translation of the monograph was published in 1967 (figure 2a) and\nThe cornerstone of Yarbus's research summarised in his monograph was the development\nof a method for accurately recording eye movements, using suction caps on the eyes (figure 2b\nshows two of the eight discussed in the book). The caps developed by Yarbus allowed stable\nrecordings of eye position over extended periods of recording. Importantly, he developed\ndevices that allowed images to be presented that moved with the eyes such that a stabilised\nretinal image could be presented. That this was his principal concern is evident from the\nopening sentences of his preface: \"This book deals with the perception of images which are\nstrictly stationary relative to the retina, the principles governing human eye movements, and\nthe study of their role in the process of vision\" (page ix).\nFigure 2. (a) dust cover of the first English edition of Eye Movements and Vision (1967); (b) two of\nYarbus's suction caps, together with the recording device. (With kind permission from Springer Science\nand Business Media.)\nThe first two chapters, constituting half the book, are devoted to describing the methods\ndeveloped by Yarbus and his colleagues and the use of these to study the perception of\nstabilised retinal images, respectively. Yarbus himself makes clear that these are the two key\nchapters of the book. In his preface to the English version he dwells primarily on the suction\ncap methods and his hopes that these techniques might be adopted by other laboratories: \"In\nthe author's opinion, this technique is suitable for use in studying a wide range of phenomena.\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 11\nIt would be a source of great satisfaction if this technique were to be adopted in the research\nlaboratory and new and interesting results obtained by its use\" (page vii). In the introductory\nchapter Yarbus states that chapter two is \"the most important in the book\" (page 2). Similar\nemphasis on this first half of the book is placed by the publishers in the inside dust cover of\nthe book, and in Gerald Westheimer's (1968) review of the book in Science:\nYarbus's significant contribution is the development of tightly fitting contact lenses that do\nnot move at all with respect to the eye. As a result he achieves stabilization good enough\nand lasting long enough that there is no reappearance of even very bright lights for several\nminutes... In what must surely be the most important segment of this book, Yarbus describes\nthe appearance of stabilized visual fields of various colors to which are added fields of different\ncolors, stabilized and unstabilized (page 657).\nIn the early 1950s, the issue of image stabilisation attracted several groups of researchers,\nmost notably Ditchburn and Ginsborg at Reading University, Riggs and Ratliff at Brown\nUniversity, and Barlow at Cambridge University. Ratliff and Riggs (1950) employed an optical\nlever system and photography to record the involuntary motions of the eye during fixation.\nBarlow (1952) placed a droplet of mercury on the cornea and photographed the eye during\nmotion and fixation; the instabilities during fixation were small but measurable. Ditchburn\nand Ginsborg (1952) used an optical system with a disc subtending 1\u00b0 separated into halves\nvertically. Luminance differences between the two parts were visible initially but disappeared\nafter 2 or 3 s; the diffuse disc remained visible with occasional reappearances of the bipartite\ndisc (see Ditchburn 1973). Yarbus developed a fuller-fitting contact lens which retained its\nposition by suction. With his optical system, he found that \"in any test field, unchanging and\nstationary with respect to the retina, all visible differences disappear after 1\u00ad3 sec, and do\nnot reappear in these conditions\" (Yarbus 1967, page 59). The research was concerned with\ndetermining the visual consequences of compensating for involuntary eye movements, but\nthere were some differences between the various studies. The source of these was examined\nby Barlow (1963), who used a full-fitting contact and a suction cap after the manner of Yarbus\nin order to compare their possible slippage; an afterimage was used as a perfectly stabilised\ntarget. The suction cap was more stable than the full-fitting contact lens, but neither was free\nfrom some slippage. He concluded, \"Good-quality images stabilized as well as possible ...\n`blur' and lose contrast rapidly: detail and texture cease to be visible, and do not reappear\"\nThe suction caps developed by Yarbus were not only for the purpose of presenting\nstabilised retinal images but also for recording eye position while inspecting external stimuli.\nA series of suction caps were developed for this purpose, two of which are shown in figure 2b.\nThe variety of designs was employed in order to meet different experimental requirements\nand to offer a set of devices that would be able to meet a wide range of experimental\nparadigms.\nThe second half of Eye Movements and Vision is much broader in scope and contains a\nlarge number of eye movement recordings exploring a variety of topics. As Westheimer (1968)\nexplains, in this second half of the book \"[t]he approach, an indigenous mix of psychology\nand cybernetics, is interesting and obviously productive, but it is not by any means superior to\nthe research strategies with which we are more conversant\" (page 657). Here Yarbus considers\nminiature movements during fixation (chapter 3), detailed kinematics of individual saccades\n(chapter 4), vergence (chapter 5), and pursuit (chapter 6). However, it is the final chapter of\nthe book, entitled \"Eye movements during perception of complex objects\", that has become\nYarbus's key contribution to the recent history of eye movement research. This chapter is\ndense with plots of eye movement records and considers an impressively wide range of\nquestions about how people inspect complex objects and scenes. Of particular note in this\n12 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nchapter is a series of records of observers viewing Ilya Repin's The Unexpected Visitor (figure 3).\nHere Yarbus showed that when different people viewed the same painting, the patterns of\neye movements were similar but not identical. When a single individual was shown the\nsame painting a number of times, with between one and two days separating the recording\nsessions, the eye movement records from successive viewings were again very similar but not\nidentical. It was evident, however, that similarity between the inspection patterns for a single\nobserver was greater than it was between observers. Yarbus also considered how viewing\nbehaviour changes over extended periods of time, looking at eye movement behaviour in\nselected sections of a long (3 min) recording session, and then exploring in great detail the\nfirst 35 s of a viewing period. Early in the viewing period, fixations were particularly directed\nto the faces of the individuals in the painted scene. The general trend for fixations when\nviewing scenes to fall preferentially on persons within the scene had been known previously\n(Buswell 1935)--although, rather surprisingly, it has only recently been demonstrated that\nthis trend is present on the very first fixation (Fletcher-Watson et al 2008).\nFigure 3. The Unexpected Visitor. Oil on canvas painting by Ilya Repin, 1884\u00ad88. (Source: Courtesy of\nwww.ilyarepin.org.)\nDissecting a long viewing period into a series of sections suggested to Yarbus that when we\nview a complex scene for an extended period of time, we show repeated cycles of inspection\nbehaviour, where repeated 25 s samples from 3 min recording sessions revealed the following:\n\"analysis of these separate records shows that each of them, roughly speaking, corresponds\nto a cycle during which the eye stops and examines the most important elements of the\npicture\" (1967, page 194). This cyclic behaviour was also found when an observer viewed a\nphotographic portrait showing only a face. In two such recordings, the observer was found to\ncycle periodically through the triangle describing the eyes, nose, and mouth of the pictured\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 13\nsubject (figure 4). While it was a relatively minor contribution to the chapter, this report of\nface scanning has assumed a prominent place in the history of face research. This study of\nface viewing provided two key insights into how we look at faces. First, it shows there is a\nstrong preference to look at the eyes more than any other feature of the face. Second, for\nextended viewing there is a clear tendency to make repeated cycles of fixations between the\nkey features of a face. Yarbus's work has become widely cited in the face research community\nfor both of these key early insights into face viewing (see Kingstone 2009).\nThe observation of cyclic scanning behaviour, and indeed of cognitive influences on\nviewing (see below), has had far-reaching consequences. Notably, this work underpinned the\nScanpath Theory developed by Noton and Stark (1971). This theory proposes that the paths\ntaken by the eye during extended viewing are an integral part of our perception of complex\nimages. Furthermore, Noton and Stark suggest that the replicability of eye movement patterns\nfor repeated viewings of a stimulus or during extended viewing reflects this sensorimotor\naspect of perception. While the theory has subsequently been criticised, it is clear that\nYarbus's work profoundly influenced the development of these ideas.\nFigure 4. Cyclic fixation behaviour while viewing faces.

(With kind permission from Springer Science and Business Media.)\nHowever, despite the richness of this chapter, the vast majority of citations of Yarbus's\nbook draw upon the data presented in just one of the figures in the series of recordings of\nobservers viewing The Unexpected Visitor and the surrounding discussion of these data.\nYarbus's invaluable contribution in this chapter was to ask the same individual to view\nthe painting seven times, each time with a different instruction before starting to view the\nimage. These instructions asked the viewer to make a series of judgements about the scene\ndepicted, to remember aspects of the scene, or simply to look at it freely. The data illustrated\ncompellingly that simply altering the instructions given to the observer, and thus their task\n14 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nwhile viewing, had a profound effect on the inspection behaviour of the observer (figure 5).\nAs Yarbus observed: \"Depending on the task in which a person is engaged, ie, depending\non the character of the information which he must obtain, the distribution of the points of\nfixation on an object will vary correspondingly, because different items of information are\nusually localized in different parts of an object\" (page 192).\nFigure 5.

First, the chapter was concerned\nwith scanning behaviour while viewing faces. Second, the chapter was concerned with\nhow the instructions given to an observer influenced inspection behaviour when viewing\na complex social scene (The Unexpected Visitor). In the present paper we return to these\ntwo central themes of Yarbus's work. The portrait of the young Yarbus (figure 1a) provides\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 15\na convenient (and fitting) stimulus to allow us to extend and combine the themes of the\nfinal chapter of Eye Movements and Vision. First, we can use this portrait to consider face\nviewing when more of the person than just the face is present, an issue that has received little\nattention in the face viewing literature. Second, we can consider the influence of instructions\non viewing a less contrived image than The Unexpected Visitor. Moreover, this second issue\nallows us to consider how instructions influence the manner in which we view faces. Both of\nthese questions were addressed by conducting a single experiment as detailed below. In the\nsections that follow we take the same approach as Yarbus of combining qualitative pictorial\nrepresentations of the data and quantitative analyses to explore our two questions.\nTwenty participants from the University of Dundee took part on a voluntary basis. All had\nnormal or corrected-to-normal vision, had no prior knowledge of Yarbus or his work, and\nwere naive to the purposes of the study.\nParticipants each viewed the portrait of Yarbus, which was embedded in a 1600 by 1200 pixel\nwhite background screen such that the portion of the portrait shown in figure 1a measured\ncm from the observer, the portrait subtended approximately 26 by 18.4 deg in the observer's\nfield of view.\nThe same stimulus was shown seven times in random order for each participant. Prior to\neach presentation of the portrait, a set of written instructions was displayed on the screen\nfor 10 s. Table 1 shows the seven different instructions given to participants. After 10 s, the\ninstructions disappeared and were replaced by the portrait of Yarbus, which was presented\nfor 50 s. After 50 s, the portrait was replaced with a blank, white screen and the observers were\nasked to provide a verbal answer to the question asked in the instructions, where appropriate.\nThese verbal responses were not analysed.\nTable 1. The seven sets of written instructions shown during the experiment.\nCondition Instructions\nWhen the picture appears...\n1 Simply look at it in whatever way you want.\n2 Estimate how wealthy this person was and what his social position was.\n3 Estimate how old the person in the picture was when it was taken.\n4 Estimate what the person had been doing just before this picture was taken.\n5 Remember as much as you can about the clothes the person is wearing.\n6 Try to remember the positions and details of everything in the picture.\n7 Try to estimate how long this person had been away from home when this\npicture was taken and why he had been away.\n3.3 Eye movement recording\nEye movements were recorded as participants viewed the portrait, using an SR Research\nEyeLink 2 eye tracker set to record gaze position at 500 Hz using only the pupil detection\nmethod. Calibration and validation of the eye tracker involved a randomly permuted display\nof nine circular targets on the monitor. If the validation indicated an average error in excess\nof 0.5\u00b0 or a maximum error in excess of 1\u00b0, the calibration and validation procedures were\nrepeated.\nFixations and saccades were classified using the software supplied by SR Research. This\ndetects saccades when eye position changes by more than 0.1\u00b0, with a minimum velocity of\n30\u00b0 s-1 and a minimum acceleration of 8000\u00b0 s-2, over a period of at least 4 ms. No minimum\n16 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nfixation duration or saccade amplitude thresholds were applied. Note that data from two\nparticipants were lost, one due to a technical error as the data were being saved, the other\ndue to clear vertical slippage of the eye tracker during the recording session.\n4 Face viewing in presence of a body\nStudies of face viewing, including Yarbus's own work, typically involve the presentation of\nisolated faces, devoid of the context of the subject's body (eg Bindemann et al 2009; Butler et\nal 2005; Guo et al 2010). Yarbus's report of cyclic looking around the eyes and mouth of the\nface to produce the triangular eye movement records seen in figure 4 has become a widely\naccepted tenet in face research. However, it is less certain whether such cyclic viewing of the\nfacial features is seen when the face is viewed in the context of the subject's body.\nIn Yarbus's consideration of face scanning there was no instruction to the viewer before\nthey were presented with the face. We therefore use only data from the free viewing condition\nin the present analysis. By combining the data from all participants while they viewed the\nportrait of Yarbus with no explicit instructions (the `free viewing' condition), we can consider\nwhether there were general tendencies to fixate on particular parts of the face.\nIn order to consider whether there was an overall tendency to look more at the eyes\nand mouth of the face than other parts of the face, we constructed an overall distribution\nof the allocation of gaze to the portrait. This distribution was constructed by iteratively\nadding a Gaussian centred around each sample from the eye tracker (each sample being\nseparated by 2 ms). Each Gaussian had full width at half maximum of 0.5\u00b0 to reflect estimates\nof foveal extent. The resulting 3-dimensional landscape contains peaks, the heights of which\nreflect the cumulative viewing time across all participants. For ease of interpretation, this\ndistribution is presented as a `heat map' overlaid upon the portrait of Yarbus (figure 6). Only\nthe region around the face is shown in this figure to make comparisons to Yarbus's studies\nof isolated face viewing (figure 4) easier. There is a strong tendency to look at one of the\neyes and the mouth of the face in the portrait. The other eye (Yarbus's right eye), which is in\nrelative shadow on the face, received only a small fraction of the overall allocation of gaze\ntime.\nFigure 6. Overall fixation distribution of people free viewing the portrait of Yarbus. The intensity of the\ncoloured overlay indicates the amount of fixation time received across all observers.\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 17\nWhile the plot in figure 6 shows an overall tendency to look at the mouth and one of\nthe eyes, it does not allow us to consider whether participants employed the cyclic viewing\nbehaviour reported by Yarbus. For this we must look at the sequences of eye movements\nmade by individual observers. In our dataset we found that the scan patterns over the face\nin the portrait varied considerably. Four representative plots are shown in figure 7. In some\ncases, scan patterns resembling those found by Yarbus can be seen (the right hand panels\nof figure 7). Here we see portions of the scan patterns that involved looks between the\nkey features of the face. Thus, there was some cyclic looking behaviour evident in these\ntrials. However, in many cases (for example, the plots in the left-hand panels of figure 7) no\nsuch cyclic patterns of looking around the features were present. In these cases the typical\nscanning behaviour described by Yarbus was absent. It should be noted that all of the plots\nin figure 7 include a large number of scans to locations outside the sections of the portrait\nshown in the plots--these are looks to other parts of the portrait such as the body. We will\nreturn to the issue of looks at non-face regions of the portrait in the next section of this paper.\nFigure 7. Scan patterns for four of the observers in the present study as they freely viewed the portrait\nof Yarbus. As in figure 6, for comparisons to Yarbus's work on face viewing (figure 4), only the facial\nregion of the portrait is shown here.\nThe individual differences in scan patterns over the facial region of the portrait are\nconsistent with Yarbus's study of individual differences in viewing a complex scene (The\nUnexpected Visitor). In figure 108 of the final chapter of Eye Movements and Vision, Yarbus\nplotted the eye movement behaviour for seven different observers, each viewing The\nUnexpected Visitor for 3 min under free-viewing instructions. We further consider individual\ndifferences suggested in figure 7 of the present study by looking at differences across the\nentire spatial extent of the portrait. Figure 8 shows eye movement data for seven randomly\nselected participants viewing the portrait of Yarbus. Yarbus's corresponding figure of seven\nparticipants looking at the Unexpected Visitor is shown alongside these data for comparison.\nIn both sets of data participants viewed the picture with no instructions other than to simply\nlook at the image. In Yarbus's data, participants viewed the painting for 3 min. In our data\n18 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\neach participant viewed the image for 50 s. Yarbus noted that there were global similarities in\nthe patterns of eye movements made by the different subjects when viewing the painting but\nthat there were also clear differences between these observers. In our data the same general\nobservations can be made. However, in some cases (compare panels 1 and 2 in figure 8b) the\ndifferences between participants appear quite considerable.\nFigure 8. Seven participants freely viewing pictures. (a) Yarbus's data originally published in figure 107\nof Eye Movements and Vision (with kind permission from Springer Science and Business Media). (b)\nData from seven randomly selected participants in the present study.\n5 Instructions and face viewing\nThe issue of how a high-level task, such as the instruction given prior to viewing a scene,\ninfluences eye movement behaviour has become a question of central interest in eye\nmovement research. The debate about the extent to which fixations are allocated on the\nbasis of internally generated priorities has generated a large volume of research. For an\noverview of the current state of the continuing debate about the relative contributions of\nlow- and high-level factors in targeting eye movements during scene viewing, we refer the\nreader to the recent special issue of Visual Cognition on this topic (Tatler 2009) and to Land\nand Tatler (2009). However, the literature concerned with the relative roles of low- and high-\nlevel factors in scene viewing rarely engages with that on face viewing. Indeed, the stimuli\nemployed in scene perception studies are often devoid of faces, comprising natural but\nunpopulated scenes. Conversely the stimuli employed in face research are often devoid of\nscenes (or indeed anything other than the face). Yarbus's study of The Unexpected Visitor is a\nrare example of a scene stimulus that contains human faces, but like other scene perception\nstudies that have included faces (eg Birmingham et al 2009; Torralba et al 2006), these faces\nare too small to discern the detailed manner in which the facial features are scanned and\nwhether this scanning is sensitive to viewing instructions. Our study allows us to consider\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 19\nwhether face scanning is sensitive to viewing instruction, but for a stimulus in which the face\nis not the only component of the image.\nFigure 9 shows the distributions of fixations on the face region of the portrait for all seven\ninstruction conditions. The plots are constructed in the same way as was done for figure 6\nabove. Note that there are clear global differences between the seven instructions. Most\nnotably, tasks 4 (what had the person been doing?) and 5 (remember the clothes) resulted in\na lower proportion of looks to the face region being directed to the eyes.\nFigure 9. Fixation distributions on the face of the portrait for each of the seven instruction conditions.\nNote that the scaling for the colours varies between plots, with the bars to the right-hand side of each\nplot showing the viewing times denoted by the intensities of the colours. Viewing times shown in the\nbars to the right of each plot are in milliseconds and are cumulative across all participants.\nFrom figure 9 it is also clear (as shown in the bars to the right-hand side of each plot) that\nthe amount of time spent looking at the faces varies considerably between tasks. The data\nsuggest that less time was spent looking at the face for tasks 5 (remember the clothes) and 6\n(remember everything) than the other tasks. To consider this in more detail, we now turn to\nthe question of the manner in which the entire portrait was viewed. To address this--and for\ncomparison with Yarbus's original data--we first show eye movement records for a single\nrandomly selected participant from the present study, viewing the portrait of Yarbus with\nseven different instructions (figure 10). As can be seen in both the original data collected by\nYarbus and in our own data, the instructions given to the participant had a clear influence\non the overall inspection behaviour of this observer during repeated viewings of Yarbus's\nportrait. It is interesting to note the similarities between the patterns of eye movements made\nunder the seven instruction conditions between our data and those collected by Yarbus. For\nexample, when asked to estimate age(s) of people (instruction 3), observers restricted their\neye movements almost exclusively to facial and nearby regions. When asked to remember as\n20 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nmuch as possible about everything in the image (instruction 6), eye movements explored the\nfull extent of the picture.\nFigure 10. One participant viewing the same image seven times, each with a different set of instruc-\ntions. (a) Yarbus's original data (from figure 109 in Eye Movements and Vision). (b) Data from the\npresent study. Eye movements from the full 50 s viewing period are shown for each condition. (1) Free\nexamination of the picture.

(5) Remember the clothes worn by the person. (6) Remember the positions and\ndetails of everything in the picture. (7) Estimate how long the person had been away from home.\nThe data in figures 9 and 10 both point to differences in the allocation of gaze across\nthe seven instruction conditions. However, it is important to consider whether these results\ngeneralise across participants or are parochial to the selected observer. For The Unexpected\nVisitor, the question of generalisability of Yarbus's results has been addressed by DeAngelus\nand Pelz (2009); these authors showed that the same inter-instruction differences can be\nfound in a group of observers. For our data, we address this question by considering gaze\nallocation across all participants in the present study. Figure 11 shows the distribution of\nviewing time combined for all participants across the entire portrait for each instruction\ncondition. These distributions highlight clear differences in gaze allocation among instruc-\ntion conditions and confirm that the differences found in the single participant plotted in\nfigure 10 generalise across a group of participants.\nFigure 11 clearly shows that there were differences in the spatial allocation of attention\nto the portrait when viewing it under the seven different instructions. In order to explore\nthese spatial differences quantitatively, we divided the image into nine regions of interest\n(figure 12) and considered how long was spent fixating on each of these regions of interest.\nWhen considering the allocation of fixations across the nine regions of interest, we can\nconsider the proportion of fixation time in each of the regions (figure 13a). However, the\nregions of interest vary considerably in their relative sizes (figure 12). We therefore normalised\nthe proportion of viewing time by the area of each region of interest in the following analysis.\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 21\nFigure 11. Gaze distributions for each of the seven instruction conditions. Data are accumulated over\nall participants. The bars to the right of each plot show the gaze time (in ms) that is indicated by each\ncolour.\ni\nFigure 12. Regions of interest.\nA two-way ANOVA [instruction condition (7 levels) x region of interest (9 levels)] revealed a\nfixation times are reported as a (normalised) proportion of the viewing period, there was no\nmain effect of instruction condition. However, there was an interaction between instruction\n22 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nIn general, across all conditions, apart perhaps from when asked to remember the clothes\nworn, people looked more to Yarbus's facial regions than to other regions of the portrait.\nWhether normalised or not, viewing time was very low on the arms, buttons, and background\nof the portrait (figure 13). The torso was looked at quite a lot (figure 13a); however, the torso\noccupied a large proportion of the image and so would be expected to receive a reasonable\namount of viewing time whether or not it was of particular interest to the viewer. Normalising\nviewing time on the torso by the area of this region showed that it received a small relative\nfraction of the fixation time (figure 13b).\nFigure 13. (a) Proportion of viewing time in each ROI for each of the seven instruction conditions.\n(b) Normalised viewing time in each ROI for each of the seven instruction conditions. Regions of\ninterest: 1 = hat, 2 = eyes, 3 = nose, 4 = mouth, 5 = rest of face, 6 = arms, 7 = buttons, 8 = rest of torso, 9 =\nbackground.\nThese data extend Yarbus's original findings concerning the influence of instructions on\nsubsequent viewing behaviour. Here we show that, for a much simpler scene in which only\none individual is present, the allocation of gaze changes depending on the instructions given\nprior to viewing. Moreover, we have shown that the manner in which a face is inspected\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 23\ndepends on the instructions given. That is, the typical tendency to view the eyes and mouth,\nand to cycle between features, is not universal and can be diminished or absent depending\non the viewer's task. Since faces are rarely seen in isolation under normal viewing conditions,\nsome caution may be necessary in extending the interpretations from photographed faces to\nnatural behaviour.\n6 The legacy of Yarbus\nThe rather brief final chapter of Yarbus's Eye Movements and Vision has made a profound\ncontribution to the subsequent literature on eye movement control during complex-scene\nperception. The legacy has been twofold: concerning how people look at faces and how\ncognitive factors such as instructions given prior to viewing can influence inspection\nbehaviour.\nIn many respects it is the latter of these two contributions that Yarbus's book has become\nmost well known for. Interestingly, Buswell (1935) had already shown that instructions\ninfluenced fixation behaviour. But Yarbus's visualisations of such clear differences in each of\nhis seven records of a single observer viewing a single scene have remained an emblematic\nillustration of this point. The question of to what extent cognitive factors influence where\nobservers look in complex scenes rose to the forefront of eye movement research in the early\n1990s. Yarbus's prominence in this era coincided with a number of distinguished researchers\nbeginning to emphasise the importance of cognitive factors on eye movement control. Two\ninfluential publications at the start of the 1990s placed cognitive factors firmly at the forefront\nof eye movement research: Eileen Kowler's (1990) chapter on cognitive influences on gaze and\nKeith Rayner's (1992) edited volume on Eye Movements and Visual Cognition. Three papers\nin the latter discuss the importance of Yarbus's work on cognitive control of fixation selection\nof the Active Vision approach to eye movements (Ballard 1991; Ballard et al 1992; Findlay\nand Gilchrist 2003), and it is at this time that Dana Ballard, Mary Hayhoe, and Mike Land all\nbegan to study eye movements in the context of natural behaviour. All of these authors have\nemphasised the importance of Yarbus's work as a demonstration that where we look depends\ncritically on our cognitive task. Yarbus's work has since become established as a popular,\nelegant demonstration of high-level influences on gaze control. The question of whether and\nto what extent low- and high-level factors have a role in selecting where humans direct their\ngaze when viewing complex scenes continues to be a prominent and controversial topic in\nThe prominence of Yarbus's work in the modern debate about eye guidance is evidenced\nby the total number and yearly frequency of citations that Eye Movements and Vision has\nreceived (figure 14). A noticeable change in the popularity of this work is evident in the\nmid-1990s. Indeed, studies of eye movements in natural behaviour have been inspired\nheavily by his work. The notion of task-dependent patterns of fixations has driven and\nunderpinned many of the studies of eye movements in the context of natural behaviour\nWhile the prominence of Yarbus's work within the contemporary study of eye movement\ncontrol during scene perception is clear, it should be noted that the impact of the work is by\nno means restricted to this field of research. The widespread recognition of the importance of\nthis elegant demonstration of cognitive control of inspection behaviour has had an influence\nin areas as diverse as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, computer science, and engineering.\nIndeed, the book has been cited in 501 different journals, covering a wide range of subject\nareas. Figure 15 summarises the frequency of citations of Eye Movements and Vision across\nthe nine main disciplines in which the book is cited.\n24 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky\nFigure 14.

Citations of Eye Movements and Vision across main disciplines.\n7 Concluding remarks\nIt is unusual for so little to be known about a visual scientist whose research is so well known.\nThis applies to Yarbus, particularly amongst the English-speaking scientific community. We\nhope that we have attached a little more personal flesh to his sturdy scientific skeleton. His\nbook on Eye Movements and Vision is cited with increasing frequency, and its attraction has\nshifted from the early chapters (relating to image stabilisation) to the later ones (concerning\nobservation of complex scenes).\nOne area of study that has expanded enormously since 1967 is face perception. The\ncharacteristic pattern of eye movements when viewing pictures of faces was established by\nYarbus. It has since been replicated many times and has become an accepted canon in face\nresearch. We extend this influential finding by considering face scanning when more than\nthe face alone is presented to the viewer. Here we found that while facial features, particularly\nYarbus, eye movements, and vision 25\nthe eyes and mouth, still receive the greatest fraction of gaze allocation, the cyclic scanning\nbetween eyes and mouth reported by Yarbus was less evident when the face is viewed in the\ncontext of a body and cannot be seen in all observers.\nThe effect of instructions on inspecting complex scenes, demonstrated in Yarbus's\nrecordings of a single observer viewing the painting The Unexpected Visitor seven times, each\ntime with different instructions prior to viewing, has inspired and underpinned a wealth\nof eye-tracking studies since the 1990s. DeAngelus and Pelz (2009) recently returned to\nYarbus's study and were able to confirm that the findings described by Yarbus for a single\nviewer generalised to multiple viewers of The Unexpected Visitor. We extend Yarbus's work\nby considering the influence of instructions on viewing a portrait. This allows us not only\nto consider whether Yarbus's findings generalise to a more simple visual stimulus but also\nthe influence of instructions on face viewing. We find similar sensitivity to task instructions\nfor viewing a portrait as was originally reported in Eye movements and Vision. Moreover, the\nextent to which particular features (and indeed the whole face) are looked at depends on the\ninstructions given prior to viewing.\nYarbus was far seeing in his analysis of vision. In addition to the then contemporary issues\nhe addressed on image stabilisation, his more exploratory experiments on viewing complex\nscenes strike a chord with those extending the study of eye movements beyond the confines\nof the laboratory.\n"
