One\nconcern is that democratic accountability could be threat-\nened, if bad economic conditions trigger disenchantment\nand abstention. Although the current situation is not so\nbleak, the three European countries most damaged by the\nlatest economic crisis have recently experienced significant\ndecreases in voter turnout rates. In the last two general elec-\ntions, Spain's turnout dropped from 74% to 69%, Italy's\nelections recorded their lowest turnout since 1979.\nThis recent evidence seems to align with earlier findings\nregarding the economy's effect on turnout. Rosenstone\n(1982) argues that economic crises harm turnout, since vot-\ners facing economic difficulties are too preoccupied with\ntheir personal financial situations to visit the polls. Yet the\nliterature devoted to examining how economic turmoil\naffects turnout also points to null or even positive impacts\nresults we focus on an attitude that constitutes a necessary\ncondition for electoral participation: the civic duty to vote.\nThe missing link in the rational choice equation for turn-\nout, civic duty is an attitudinal element that helps us under-\nstand why people show up at the polls, even if the costs of\nvoting exceed the benefits (Blais, 2000; Riker and\nOrdeshook, 1968). Besides being a highly relevant predictor\nof turnout, civic duty is also an attitude related to citizenship\nnorms, the legitimacy of the political system, and the citi-\nzenry's general political support and engagement, all of\nwhich are attitudinal dimensions presumably sensitive to the\neconomy (Armingeon and Guthmann, 2012; C\u00f3rdova and\nSeligson, 2009). It therefore makes sense to wonder whether\npeople are less inclined to consider voting in terms of civic\nduty when the economic situation takes a sharp downturn.\nTo explore the effects of the economic crisis on civic\nduty, we analyze data from Spain, a country significantly\nhit by the debt crisis in Europe, especially in terms of its\nyouth. We use a four-wave panel survey that allows us to\ntrack changes in Spaniards' attitudes toward voting over a\nperiod of a year and a half (i.e., November 2010 to May\n2012), during which the economy severely worsened. We\nexamine the effects of the economic crisis through two dif-\nferent sets of indicators: perceptions of the economy and\ncitizens' personal economic and working circumstances.\nA call of duty in hard times: Duty to vote\nand the Spanish Economic Crisis\nCarol Galais and Andr\u00e9 Blais\n Keywords\nVoter turnout, civic duty, economic crisis, economy, panel surveys\nUniversit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nCarol Glais, Postdoctoral Fellow, Canadian Research Chair in Electoral\nStudies, D\u00e9partement de science politique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al,\nEmail: carolgalais@gmail.com\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nUltimately, we ascertain how changes in such indicators are\nrelated to changes in individuals' conception of voting as a\ncivic duty.\nThis research contributes to the existing debate on the\neffects of the economy on turnout and system support in\nseveral manners. Firstly, the study focuses on an attitude\nthat precedes and shapes the decision to vote, leaving aside\nother explanatory factors, such as costs, benefits, and the\nperceived probability of affecting the result of the elections.\nThis means that if we find an effect of the economic crisis\non the belief that voting is a duty, such effect on turnout\nmight be even larger, via other determinants. Secondly, it\nuses longitudinal data, which allow us to estimate a fixed-\neffects model. Therefore, our results are free from omitted\nvariable bias and make us pretty confident about the find-\nings. Thirdly, we examine a recent and timely example of a\ndeep crisis (Spain) for which we explore the role of a wide\narray of objective and subjective economic variables. Thus,\nwe go beyond analyzing the effects of unemployment, the\nmost studied economic variable. Fourthly, we take into\naccount the specific effect of the electoral context. This\nallows us to show that the negative effect of the crisis is\noffset by the positive effect of the electoral context, espe-\ncially among youth.\nThe economic crisis and attitudes toward voting\nThe link between the economy and turnout--more particu-\nlarly, between economic downturns and attitudes related to\nturnout--is far from clear. While the effects of the economy\non how people vote have attracted a great deal of attention,\nthe impact on turnout itself remains much less explored\n(Pacek and Radcliff, 1995). Moreover, studies addressing\nthis issue have reported inconclusive and contradictory\nresults. Deteriorating economic conditions have been found\nto hamper turnout in the US (Rosenstone, 1982), but also to\nboost it, as long as citizens can identify whom to blame\n(Arcenaux, 2003). We find the same contradictions for\ndeveloping countries: economic downturns have been\nfound to boost turnout (Aguilar and Pacek, 2000; Radcliff,\n1992) but also to have no impact whatsoever (Lavezzolo,\nFindings on the matter also differ depending on the\ncountries under study, whether scholars approach the issue\nfrom a macroeconomic or individual perspective, and\nwhether they look at specific subgroups in the population.\nIn fact, Rosenstone's (1982) results that support the so-\ncalled `withdrawal hypothesis'fail for disadvantaged social\ngroups, which are more motivated to vote during economic\nIn light of the Great Recession that began in 2007, the\nlink between the economy and electoral outcomes has\nbeen reexamined, although voter choice has received far\nmore attention than turnout. Such continued neglect of the\nlatter further justifies our attention to civic duty, which\nstands out as a chief predictor of turnout. If the latest sus-\ntained economic crisis has eroded the moral basis for vot-\ning, then turnout is bound to decrease in the future. Civic\nduty is the least `rational' determinant of turnout, hence\npresumably the least sensitive to the economy. If we show\nthat the economy is able to hamper it, the negative effects\nof the economy on turnout may be even larger, as eco-\nnomic downturns will probably also affect individuals'\nresources and incentives.\nIn this respect, some recent studies suggest an erosion of\nattitudes related to system support. For instance, Stevenson\nand Wolfers (2011) find that the crisis has had detrimental\neffects on trust in public institutions, while Armingeon and\nGuthmann (2012) show a relationship between negative\nperceptions of the economic crisis and a decrease of trust in\nlegislatures. These detrimental effects could be larger in\nyounger democracies, and damage trust in elections and\neven support for representative democracy (C\u00f3rdova and\nSeligson, 2009). The question therefore becomes whether\nthe recent economic crisis has similar negative effects on\ncitizens' duty to vote.\nIn this regard, two theories offer different causal mecha-\nnisms to explain the link between the crisis and changes in\nvoter attitudes (Newton and Norris, 2000). On the one\nhand, the socio-cultural perspective emphasizes the role of\nindividual life situations and experiences in shaping civic\nmindedness and other attitudes consistent with democracy.\nIn this model, worsened economic conditions may compel\ncitizens to focus on personal interests instead of those of the\ncommunity, thereby weakening the social value of voting\nas a duty. This strand of research is in line with the so-called\n`withdrawal hypothesis' (Rosenstone, 1982). From this\npoint of view, the economic crisis may alter the normal tra-\njectory of life events by delaying the transition to adult-\nhood. Thus, the emergence of new adult interests, such as\npolitics, may be belated. In this sense, a voter's member-\nship in a disadvantaged group may undermine the develop-\nment of a sense of civic duty.\nUnemployment is by far the most analyzed aspect of\neconomic adversity, although the evidence about its effects\nis mixed. More precisely, becoming unemployed has been\nfound to be consistently, albeit weakly, related to support\nfor social policies aimed at helping the poor (Margalit,\ncifically on political involvement, most studies conclude\nthat unemployment (particularly among the youth) relates\nto lower levels of participation, especially electoral partici-\npation, and reduces political interest and trust (Anderson,\nliterature is far from consensual. Some studies, especially\nthe most recent, do not seem to reach such pessimistic con-\nclusions (Giuni and Lorenzini, 2013; Lorenzini and Giuni,\nOn the other hand, the institutional performance model\nsuggests that perceptions of economic and political\nGalais and Blais 3\nconditions connect a government's performance to political\nFor instance, Stulhofer and Rimac (2002) propose that\nsocial changes stemming from the economic crisis affect\nevaluations of economic, political, and social conditions,\nwhich in turn affect dominant social values and foster cyni-\ncism as well as opportunism. From this perspective, a wors-\nening of the economy adversely affects the civic duty to\nvote out of disappointment with the system's performance.\nHowever, it has also been found that individuals facing eco-\nnomic adversity who blame the government for their situa-\ntion are actually more likely to vote (Arceneaux, 2003).\nAltogether, the impact of economic situations on citizens'\nperceptions of voting is quite unclear.\nThe Spanish economic crisis\nTo understand how the economy can affect attitudinal\nchange regarding turnout, it is necessary to control for two\nelements: the political context and a voter's belonging to\na disadvantaged group. As regards contextual effects,\nsome citizens may revise their sense of duty as an election\napproaches, as they do with respect to trust in democracy\nor political institutions (Bowler and Donovan, 2002;\nFranklin, 2004). Indeed, general political attitudes have\nbeen shown to react more to political factors (e.g., elec-\ntoral campaigns) than to economic conditions (Bratton\nWhitefield, 1995). Therefore, the proximity of an upcom-\ning election could more than offset the negative effect of\nthe economic crisis.\nIn order to take into account changing elements of the\npolitical context, it is particularly interesting to adopt a lon-\ngitudinal perspective to keep most elements of the political\nsystem constant. With this purpose, we examine Spain,\nwhich held a general election in November 2011 that coin-\ncided with the implementation of several austerity meas-\nures and resulted in a change in government. Spain is a\nrelatively young democracy that still experiences changes\nin aspects of its political culture and is thus likely influ-\nenced by major economic changes, such as those it has\nendured since 2008. If economic downturns affect the atti-\ntudinal basis of turnout, then we should be able to see such\ninfluence in Spain. In this particular context, it is also\nimportant to consider the effects of age, since the Great\nRecession in Spain has been especially difficult for the\nyoungest citizens.\nA quick outline of the Spanish economic crisis takes us\nback to 2008, when the explosion of the real estate bubble\nprompted a collapse of housing prices. This collapse\nstopped housing construction and left thousands of people\nin the construction industry unemployed. When banks dis-\ncovered that (subprime) mortgages could no longer be paid,\nthey drastically reduced loans to businesses and individu-\nals, which only worsened the economic situation.\nMortgages and evictions constitute significant dimen-\nhome yet remained in debt for their mortgages.2 Spanish\ncourts evict individuals unable to fulfill their mortgages,\nbut they must still pay off their remaining debt to the\nbank--interest and late fees included--since their property\nhas suffered a substantial devaluation. This critical situa-\ntion in turn triggered many protests against the Mortgage\nLaw. In fact, a Popular Legislative Initiative requesting a\npayment-in-kind formula has gathered more than 1.4 mil-\nlion supporters. All in all, we can assume that surrendering\nhome ownership yet maintaining a huge debt triggers a\nfeeling of abandonment by the authorities that may jeop-\nardize a citizen's beliefs about her civic duties.\nAlthough the European Central Bank approved a bailout\nfor Spanish banks in 2012, credit has not yet flowed into\nindividuals or enterprises. The bailout arrived in exchange\nfor a commitment to trimming the budget deficit to 3.6% of\nthe gross domestic product (GDP), which entailed addi-\ntional welfare cutbacks. Consequently, unemployment\nunder 25 years of age, these figures are far worse: unem-\nthe steepest increase of youth unemployment among\nEuropean Union (EU) members since the onset of the Great\nRecession (O'Higgins, 2012). As a social group, Spanish\nyouth has suffered most from the crisis, particularly due to\nthe so-called `labor-market duality,' which consisted of the\ngap between temporary and permanent contracts that\nimpedes newcomers from accessing steady employment\n(Scarpetta et al., 2010). This is important, since previous\nresearch has shown that temporary work hampers turnout\nDespite this dire scenario, our data show a slight increase\nin the sense that voting is a civic duty during the year and a\nhalf under analysis. Figure 1 shows that the percentage of\nrespondents who felt that voting is a duty increased during\nthe period analyzed here, particularly among the youngest.\nHowever, what role did the economic crisis play in this\nevolution?\nResearch design and data collection\nTo test the effects of the economic crisis on perceptions of\nvoting as a civic duty, we used the study Centro de\nInvestigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) 2855, an online panel\nsurvey conducted in four waves during a period of 18\nand May 2012.3 Respondents were selected from an online\nsurvey pool set up by the active recruitment of potential\nrespondents active in mainstream commercial websites in\nSpain.4 The sample consists of Spanish citizens between\n4 Research and Politics \nthe ages of 16 and 45 years with Internet access, since the\nsurvey was designed to examine attitudinal change among\nyoung people who are theoretically open to social change.\nWe ran two fixed-effects linear estimations.5 Fixed-\neffects estimations aim to neutralize the impact of all time-\ninvariant individual characteristics by producing unbiased\ncoefficients due to omitted time-invariant characteristics\n(e.g., gender, previous socialization, education).Among the\nadvantages of the estimation method, the large quantity of\nobservations increased the degrees of freedom, reduced\ncollinearity among the explanatory variables, and improved\nthe efficiency of the estimates. Note that this constitutes a\nmajor contribution to the existing literature on the effects of\nthe economic crisis. The use of longitudinal data and fixed-\neffects models allows us to be more confident about our\ncausal claims.\nWe use Blais and Achen's (2012) operationalization to\nassess perception of voting as a civic duty, which yields a\nfour-category variable ranging from 0 (i.e., not dutiful at\nall) to 3 (i.e., very dutiful).6 All independent variables in\nour models are recoded to range from 0 to 1. Thus, their\ncoefficients can be interpreted in terms of the effect on duty\nacross time as individuals move from its minimum to maxi-\nmum value.7 Hence, a coefficient for a dichotomous item\nappears as the effect of acquiring that condition during the\ntime span covered by our data on the evolution of civic\nduty.\nIn our first estimation, we consider the objective and\nsubjective effects of the crisis. As objective indicators of\neconomic conditions we consider variations in the\nemployed/unemployed status, in income, type of work\n(e.g., temporary, permanent), and mortgage (e.g., with or\nwithout). The subjective economic variables gather several\nperceptions of the economic situation, for which we create\na scale that combines three questions about perceptions of\nthe economy. The first asks for a general evaluation of the\nSpanish economic situation, the answers to which range\nfrom `very bad' to `very good'; the second asks for an eval-\nuation compared to a year ago, for which possible answers\nare `worse,' `the same,' and `better.' For the third question,\nthe respondents are asked to evaluate the likely evolution of\nthe economic situation by the same time next year. All\nquestions are recoded to range between 0 and 1, then added\n(Cronbach's alpha of 0.63) and rescaled again to range\nfrom 0 to 1. A fourth subjective indicator refers to the eval-\nuation of one's personal economic condition compared to a\nyear ago. The answers (worse, same, better) have also been\nrecoded to range from 0 to 1; the lowest value indicating a\nnegative evaluation. For more details on the descriptive sta-\ntistics of these variables, see the appendix.\nThe second estimation adds period effects operational-\nized by means of dummy variables, leaving Wave 1 as the\nreference category. Wave dummies should then be inter-\npreted as the average increase in the level of the depend-\nent variable compared to Wave 1, everything else being\nequal. This is aimed to take the political context into\naccount, and more specifically the electoral campaign\nheld during Wave 3 fieldwork. This is consistent with\ntwo-way fixed-effect panel model specifications, which\nseek to account for unobserved heterogeneity across both\ntime and individuals.\nFinally, both the first and the last estimation account for\nyouth vulnerability by interacting the independent varia-\nbles with the age of the respondent. For this purpose, age is\nrescaled so that its minimum value (i.e., 16 years old) takes\nthe value of 0 and its maximum (i.e., 45 years old) the value\nof 29. This way, the interpretation of interaction effects\nbecomes simpler, since any main effect will point to the\nimpact of an independent variable when age is at its mini-\nmum value (i.e., 16 years old).\nResults\nTable 1 presents the results of the two fixed-effects linear\nestimations of changes in perceiving voting as a civic duty.\nThe first specification analyzes the impact of the variables\nconditional on age. The main effects of unemployment,\npermanent worker, and mortgage indicate the impact of\nbecoming unemployed, permanently employed, or obtain-\ning a mortgage during this period on the evolution of the\nbelief that voting is a civic duty, among respondents 16\nyears of age. The coefficient for income identifies the effect\nof moving from the lowest monthly income category (i.e.,\nyounger respondents; as one gets richer (poorer) one's\nsense of duty becomes stronger (weaker). Becoming unem-\nployed does not significantly weaken sense of civic duty,\nneither among the youngest respondents nor among the eld-\nest (see the non-significant interaction coefficient).\nSimilarly, losing or gaining permanent employment does\nnot have any effect. Contrarily, obtaining a mortgage is a\nFigure 1.

Hence, a salary reduction or changes regard-\ning mortgages strike harder among the youngest. By con-\ntrast, both the scale aimed to assess the evolution of\nindividuals' perceptions of the economy and the indicator\nthat gauges the evaluation of the personal economic situa-\ntion revealed that these factors play no role among any\nrespondents, regardless of their age.\nModel 2 adds period effects to the previous estimation in\norder to tap the influence of context. The estimation finds\nsimilar effects for the objective variables and their interac-\ntions with age. The main effect of age is now not signifi-\ncant, as its variation within individuals is almost completely\ncaptured by the time trend.9 Also, the effect of mortgage\nand its interaction with age is only significant at 90%,\nwhich indicates that time dummies also partly capture the\neffect of economic downturn. The main effects for the wave\ndummies indicate a positive impact, which is significant,\nand follow an increasing trend over time. The interaction\nterms show that the positive effects of an election (Wave 3)\nand its aftermath (Wave 4) are less strong as age increases.\nThere is, therefore, a period effect caused by the election\nheld in November 2011, which occurred one week after\nWave 3 was conducted. Interestingly, this effect has not\ndecayed 6 months after the election. The magnitude of the\nperiod effects is so important that it offsets the negative\neffects of a worsened economic situation or working status\namong the youngest respondents.\nRegarding the relevance of these independent variables,\nthe F-test rejects the possibility that all coefficients are\nequal to zero in both models. Additional joint significant\ntests (not shown) tested the significance of the indicators of\nTable 1.

The results of these successive Wald tests reject the\npossibility that the effects of objective indicators and all\ninteractions are jointly zero. They also point to the signifi-\ncance of time effects, thus justifying the inclusion of year\ndummies, although they also confirm that the coefficients\nfor the subjective perceptions of the economy and their\ninteractions with age are together not different from zero.\nFigures 2 and 3 depict the predicted effect of changes\nin income or mortgage on sense of civic duty, on the basis\nof Model 1. An improvement or deterioration of income\nsignificantly affects the perception of voting as a civic\nduty only for those under 27 years of age. After that age,\nthe effect is indistinguishable from zero. As for mort-\ngages, their effect disappears after 21 years of age.10\nThese age markers are generally in line with socialization\ntheories, which hold that most political attitudes develop\nand crystallize before a person reaches 25 years of age\n(Newcomb et al., 1967). Hence, poor economic condi-\ntions can jeopardize attitudes toward democracy, includ-\ning the feeling that voting is a duty, but only among those\nwhose attitudes are still under formation: the youngest.\nReversely, the positive effects of getting socially inte-\ngrated by means of gaining purchasing power or the sta-\ntus of homeowner play a role exclusively among the\nyoungest.\nConclusion\nPast research on the effects of the economy on elections\nfocused mainly on the US, on votes (i.e., not turnout), and\non the aggregate instead of the individual level. They also\nfailed to take into account the effects of the political con-\ntext. The few studies that have incorporated some of these\nelements have challenged Rosenstone's (1982) pessimistic\nfindings about the negative effects of economic downturns\non turnout.\nIn addressing the effects of the latest economic crisis on\nturnout, our research brings about several novel aspects of\nthe topic. Firstly, we focus on a moral attitude that precedes\nand anchors electoral behavior, taking a step back in the\ncausal chain that explains the vote. In this sense, our results\nare worrisome as they suggest that the negative influence of\nthe crisis on turnout may perpetuate the future through its\nimpact on duty, even when the crisis is over. Furthermore,\nas the vote is also affected by other `rational' variables pre-\nsumably more sensitive to economic conditions--such as\nresources and incentives--the final effect of the crisis on\nturnout may be even greater.\nSecondly, we go beyond testing the effects of unemploy-\nment, addressing two mechanisms by which an economic\ncrisis may demean the civic duty to vote: worsened per-\nsonal economic circumstances and perceptions of the econ-\nomy. Thirdly, by focusing on a country within the series of\nespecially hit by the economic crisis, we are able to take a\nlongitudinal perspective, and to estimate the effects of the\nelectoral context.\nFinally, we contribute to the existing literature about the\neffects of the economy on attitudes related to political\nengagement and support with an innovative research\ndesign. In our study, based on panel data, we used linear\nfixed-effects models to measure the effects of the crisis on\nthe perception of voting as a civic duty. We found no effects\nof subjective perceptions of the economy, of becoming\nunemployed or a temporary worker. Nevertheless, we\ndetect a significant relationship between changes in income\nand mortgages and the belief that voting is a civic duty.\nThese relationships, however, only emerge among the\nyoungest citizens.\nTo sum up, the effect of economic crisis in the evolution\nof the civic duty to vote is quite modest and confined to the\nyoungest segment of the population. Moreover, this small\nEffects on Linear Prediction\nAge\nFigure 2.

Such a\nfinding bodes well in the sense that adhesion to civic\nresponsibilities survives even in a country experiencing\nvery hard times. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen\nwhether, in the long term, a severe economic crisis could\namplify and crystallize the adverse results found among\nthe youngest and thereby bring Rosenstone's (1982) find-\nings back to life.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research has benefited from a grant of the Spanish Ministry\nNotes\n 1.

Given the ordinality inherent in our dependent variable, the\nmost logical option would be an ordinal logistic estimation.\nAs far as we can tell, however, it is impossible to estimate\nan ordinal logit model with panel data and fixed effects.\nWe therefore decided to estimate linear regression models,\nwhich yield more straightforward results. Nevertheless, we\nhave conducted an additional test for robustness that con-\nsists of dichotomizing the dependent variable (i.e., `no duty'\nand `not very strong duty' versus `somewhat of a duty' and\n`very strong duty') and running a logit estimation with fixed\neffects. The results are practically identical to those shown\nhere.\n 6. The exact wording is as follows:\nA.\nFor some people voting is mostly a duty.
