    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe ability to detect deception, in everyday social interactions and psychological evaluations, can literally mean the difference\nbetween life and death. Beyond physiological and nonverbal techniques for detecting deception, research has focused on\ncriteria designed to evaluate the content of verbal statements to distinguish between true or actually experienced events\nversus internally manufactured or fabricated events. Criteria from two techniques that have received empirical support,\ncriteria-based content analysis and reality monitoring, were used to create an 11-item Deception Detection Checklist\n(DDCL). In this study, 130 college undergraduates used the DDCL to rate the exculpatory statements of two accused\nchild molesters: one truthful, the other untruthful. The 11 items composing the DDCL, as well as a measure of perceived\ntruthfulness, were all scored on 7-point Likert-type scales. Nine of the 11 items on the DDCL significantly differentiated\nbetween the true and untrue statements in the predicted direction. Overall scores on the DDCL indicated that the false\nstatement was rated as significantly more deceptive than the true statement. The DDCL possessed good reliability, and a\nseries of factor analyses provided strong support for the construct validity of the measure. The 7 psychometrically strongest\nitems from the DDCL included variables assessing the extent to which statements included clarity of detail, spatial details,\ntemporal details, and contextual details, as well as the relevance, reconstructability, and realism of the statement. These\nresults indicate that subjects were able to use this measure to reliably differentiate between true and false statements made\nby accused child molesters.\n",

Distressingly,\nresearch also indicates that police officers and trial court\njudges, those society has entrusted with the job of dispensing\njustice, may be no better at detecting deception than the aver-\nage person. For example, research relates that police officers\nare actually trained to focus on signs of nervousness, statisti-\ncally one of the weakest predictors of deception. In their pub-\nlished work, ten Brinke and Porter cite research indicating\nthat judges and jurors, as well as people in general, are actu-\nally less likely to attribute deceit to attractive rather than\nunattractive persons. In all, this research leads us to believe\nthat people are just lousy at catching liars and at least part of\nthe reason is that most of us focus on the wrong overt\nbehaviors.\nWhile some lies can be innocuous, even benign, depend-\ning on the vulnerability of the person and the seriousness of\nthe situation, some lies can have devastating even deadly\nresults. This is obviously true in police investigations as well\nas criminal trials. It is also true, however, that a forensic eval-\nuation, on which the court relies to make its decisions, can be\ncompletely wrong in the assessment of client dangerousness\nand thereby have terrible consequences for the community\ninto which the client/defendant is returned. It is no wonder\nthat the perceived sincerity or honesty of other people is\noften indicated as the single most desirable personality trait.\nThe ability to correctly identify truthful versus deceitful per-\nsons represents an important social-cognitive skill with\nseemingly obvious adaptive implications. Within the context\nof judicial proceedings or court-ordered forensic psychologi-\ncal evaluations, this is doubly true.\n1Portland State University, OR, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nShawn Adair Johnston, Portland State University, 1825 SW Broadway,\nEmail: shawnjohnstonphd@comcast.net\nAttributes of Truthful Versus Deceitful\nStatements in the Evaluation of Accused\nChild Molesters\nShawn Johnston1, Alexis Candelier1, Dana Powers-Green1, and\nSyeda Rahmani1\n Keywords\ndetecting deception, clinical interviewing, forensic psychology\n2 SAGE Open\nLiterature Review\nMost research on deception detection has focused on the\nassessment of physiological or nonverbal responses, com-\nmonly referred to as body language. For example, the fact\nthat many people exhibit autonomic nervous system\nresponses when they lie is the basis of the polygraph exami-\nnation and the guilty knowledge test. Even more common\nthan that, probably every one of us has had the experience of\nobserving another person begin to sweat and breathe more\nrapidly when he or she has begun to spin a lie. Sweating,\nbreathing heavily, excessive blinking, avoiding eye contact,\nand general physical agitation all at least have some empiri-\ncal support indicating that such behaviors, with some people,\nin some situations, can indicate the attempt to deceive. While\nphysiological responses to telling lies is a well-documented\nphenomenon, such responses have also been shown to occur\nin reaction to embarrassment and other powerful emotions,\nhaving nothing at all to do with deception.\nAnother approach to detecting deception derives from the\nidea that true statements can be differentiated from false\nstatements as a function of the cognitive task or challenge\nrepresented by attempting to deceive another person, a gen-\neral theory known as content complexity (ten Brinke &\nFisher, 2006). From this theoretical perspective, the liar has\ntaken on a complicated and weighty cognitive chore by\nattempting to deceive others. Not only must the liar make\ncertain to suppress his own knowledge of the truth, he also\nneeds to be relatively certain that the target of his deception\nis unaware of that truth. Beyond this, the liar is also required\nto be on constant guard against making inconsistent or con-\ntradictory statements that could reveal his deception. This\noverextension of cognitive ability appears to be the reason\nwhy liars tend to make shorter statements than truth tellers,\nas well as, why they are more likely to pause excessively\nwhile verbalizing their statements. We believe that the cogni-\ntive load experienced by a deceitful accused child molester\nwould be especially challenging and they would exhibit mul-\ntiple signs of this attempt to deceive. While there is some\nempirical support for techniques using physiological and\nnonverbal cues to differentiate between truthful and deceitful\nstatements, our review of the deception detection literature\nsuggests that systems based on verbal cues or information\nmay be more reliable.\nWith regard to the assessment of deception using verbal\ncues, two techniques have been independently developed\nand tested for differentiating between truthful and deceitful\nstatements. The first of these, criteria-based content analysis\n(CBCA), was originally developed in Germany for assessing\nthe veracity of children claiming to have been sexually\nabused (Roma, San Martini, Sabatello, Tatarelli, & Ferracuti,\n(RM), was developed to help differentiate between the actual\nand hallucinated experiences of schizophrenic individuals\nand foci of these two techniques could hardly have been\nmore different, rather interestingly, both of them fundamen-\ntally revolve around the idea that descriptions of actual ver-\nsus imagined or fabricated experiences will differ in\npredictable ways. Events that we literally experience in the\nreal world will have significant external inputs, while events\ngenerated or created in the imagination or mind's eye will\nhave primarily, if not exclusively, internal inputs. Both tech-\nniques predict then that actual or real experiences versus\nimagined or fabricated ones, when described verbally will\ncontain more and richer details, appear more plausible and\nrealistic, be imbedded in time, space and some social or\ninterpersonal context, and include perceptual and/or sensory\ninformation, such as the speaker's experience of tempera-\nture, sound, smell, and taste. Johnston et al. (2013) reviewed\nin detail the published research regarding specific criteria\nfrom both techniques, which had been subjected to empirical\nstudy with regard to their ability to differentiate between\ntruthful and untruthful statements, and found that both sys-\ntems demonstrated the ability to differentiate between truth-\nful and untruthful statements to a significant degree (Vrij,\nFrom the 19 criteria used in the CBCA and the 8 criteria\nused in RM to distinguish truthful from untruthful state-\nments, 11 items were derived, which are believed to capture\nthe most important features, in particular, those concepts that\nappear in both systems (see Figure 1). Item 1 assesses the\nclarity of detail provided in a statement. Item 2 assesses the\npresence of perceptual information (e.g., the experience of\ntemperature or taste). Item 3 assesses the presence of spatial\ninformation, such as physical proximity of people and\nobjects. Item 4 assesses the presence of temporal informa-\ntion, such as how events are connected in time. Item 5\nassesses the expression of affect or emotion on the part of the\nperson making the statement. Item 6 assesses the reconstruc-\ntability of the statement, particularly whether the information\nprovided is consistent, noncontradictory, and logically plau-\nsible. Item 7 assesses how realistic the statement is. Item 8\nassesses how self-serving the statement is. Item 9, which is\nour manipulation check variable, not a part of the checklist\nper se, assesses the overall perceived truthfulness of the\nstatement. Item 10 assesses the extent to which information\nin the statement is embedded in an interpersonal or social\ncontext. Item 11 assesses whether statements made by other\nindividuals are reproduced versus being paraphrased or\ninferred by the person making the statement. And finally,\nItem 12 assesses how relevant are the details provided in the\nstatement. Unlike the dichotomous rating systems used in\nCBCA and RM, the 11 new items were designed to be rated\non a 7-point Likert-type scale, going from strongly disagree\nto strongly agree, that the attribute, such as clarity of detail,\nwas present in the statement. The individual response scales\nwere expanded from 2 to 7 options to provide research sub-\njects with more finely differentiated alternatives and to\nJohnston et al. 3\nincrease the reliability of the measure. It should also be noted\nthat all items are scored in the direction of their name, that is,\na higher score on the spatial information item means that\nmore spatial information was present in the statement.\nMethod\nIndependent Variable\nThe independent variable in this study consisted of two con-\nditions: an exculpatory statement made by an accused \"truth-\nful\" child molester and an exculpatory statement made by an\naccused \"untruthful\" child molester. Both statements were\ntaken from the files of the senior author who has specialized\nin the evaluation and treatment of accused and convicted\nsexual offenders since 1980. The two alleged child molesters\nwere both referred for confidential psychological assessment\nby their attorneys regarding issues such as sexual dangerous-\nness and probation suitability. The client statements focused\nexclusively on the client's explanations of the charges against\nhim and why he believes that he had been falsely accused of\nnumerous sexual offenses against multiple children. Both\nclients'statements were taken directly from the relevant clin-\nical interview notes for that client and were comparable in\nlength, clear, and relatively articulate. Beyond this, the single\nmost important reason for selecting these particular client\nstatements was the actual judicial outcomes in each of their\nrespective criminal cases. Here, it should be noted that\nbecause it is impossible to absolutely know when a statement\nis true or false, it is often the case in the deception detection\nliterature that a client statement is viewed as truthful when a\njudge or jury has exonerated the client. Correspondingly, a\nclient statement is viewed as false when a judge or jury finds\nthe client guilty. Thus, the statement identified as truthful in\nthis research was made by an individual who was acquitted\non all counts by a jury in less than 2 hr, with numerous jurors\nreported as saying that the defendant was obviously innocent\nrather than simply not guilty. In contrast, the untruthful state-\nment was made by an individual who was convicted on all\ncounts by a jury within a comparable period of time. While\nthis is obviously an imperfect method for selecting truthful\nversus untruthful statements, it is widely accepted in the\nresearch literature concerning deception detection and does\ncontain the virtue of involving real people, accused of very\nserious crimes, which were carefully evaluated by juries of\ntheir peers.\nIn addition, three practicing forensic psychologists, with\napproximately 90 years of experience between them, were\nasked to review the statement of the untruthful accused child\nmolester. They were then asked whether they found the state-\nment truthful or untruthful and, if they believed that the state-\nment was untruthful, to rate how typical it was of untrue\nFigure 1.

All\nthree psychologists indicated they believed that the state-\nment was untrue and that the statement was, in their experi-\nence, typical of statements made by untruthful child\nmolesters.\nDependent Variable\nAs indicated above, 11 items were designed, inspired by the\nresearch literature from CBCA and RM, to assess different\nattributes or dimensions indicative of truthful versus untruth-\nful statements. The content of these items and their origins is\ndiscussed in the literature review. We hypothesized that the\nresearch subjects would rate the truthful statement signifi-\ncantly higher on the items believed to be correlated with\ntruthfulness, that is, clarity of detail, presence of perceptual/\nsensory information, realism of the statement, and so on.\nHowever, for the item assessing the self-serving nature of the\nstatement, higher scores were hypothesized to be indicative\nof greater deceitfulness.\nThe 11 items were then combined into a Deception\nDetection Checklist (DDCL). The scores on the 10 DDCL\nitems indicating truthfulness had to be reversed, so overall\nDDCL score would indicate greater deceptiveness. Overall\nscores on the DDCL can vary from a low of 11, the number\nof items, to a high of 77, seven times 11, which would indi-\ncate the maximum possible deceptiveness on the scale. It\nshould be noted that a 12th item was included on the check-\nlist though it does not contribute to the overall checklist\nscores. This item, also on a 7-point response scale, asks the\nsubject to rate the truthfulness of the two different state-\nments. Scores on this item, in part, represent an important\ncheck on how successful we were in manipulating the inde-\npendent variable. We defined successful manipulation of the\nindependent variable, as subjects correctly rating the truthful\nstatement as truthful and the untruthful statement as\nuntruthful.\nParticipants\nSubjects were 130 students from a large university in Oregon\nenrolled in an undergraduate class in forensic psychology.\nProcedures\nDuring the last week of class, the student subjects in this\nresearch were briefly described the 11 items from the DDCL\nand the research from which they originate. As noted above,\nthese were students in an upper division forensic psychology\nclass and much of the school term had been given over to\ndiscussion of sociopaths, sex offenders, and the reliable psy-\nchological assessment of such client populations. While the\ntopic of deception had been touched on many times before in\nthis class, with regard, for example, to its threat to psycho-\nlogical testing and interviewing, this was the first discussion\nof the specific 11 variables previous research suggested are\ncapable of differentiating between truthful and untruthful\nstatements. Approximately 10 min were necessary to explain\nthe DDCL items and the rating task with which the subjects\nwere about to be presented.\nAt this point, the questionnaire packets were handed out\nto the subjects. The questionnaire first informed the subject\nthat their involvement in this research was entirely voluntary,\nwould have no effect on their grade in the class, and was, in\nfact, completely confidential and anonymous; that is, no sub-\nject was asked for personal identifying information other\nthan age, gender, and major.\nSubjects were then asked to read both statements and then\nrate the two statements relative to the items on the checklist,\nalso provided to the subjects. Thus, all subjects who partici-\npated in the research, which appeared to be about 100% of\nthe members of the classes, rated both statements per the\nquestionnaire items. Subjects required approximately 15 min\nto read the statements and complete the questionnaire. Upon\ncompletion of the task, approximately half an hour was given\nover to explaining the background and hypotheses of the\nresearch while also soliciting subject reaction to the ques-\ntionnaire, the rating task, and the goals of the research.\nOverwhelmingly, the subject's responses to the task were\npositive, indicating that the task was interesting and useful.\nResults\nThe internal consistency reliability coefficient (Cronbach's\nalpha) for the DDCL was computed at .80. The means and\nstandard deviations for the truthful and untruthful conditions\nalong with the t-test statistics for the DDCL, the 11 items that\ncompose it, and the one manipulation check variable are pre-\nsented in Table 1. We would first bring the reader's attention\nto the results regarding the manipulation check variable, as\nthese results pertain to what extent we were successful in\nhaving the subjects perceive the truthful statement as true\nand the untruthful statement as untrue. If the subjects failed\nto perceive any difference in truthfulness between the true\nand untrue statements, it would be difficult to argue that\nscores on the DDCL differed as a function of the statements\nbeing true or untrue. To the extent that the subjects perceived\na significant difference between the two statements in terms\nof truthfulness, differences observed between scores on the\nother 11 items can reasonably be assumed to be directly con-\nnected to the overall perception of the statement's\ntruthfulness.\nThe results of the manipulation check variable indicate a\nvery significant difference in the perceived truthfulness of\nthe truthful versus untruthful statements. Indeed of all the t\ntests performed, the largest t-test statistic and greatest degree\nof significant difference was found between subject's overall\nratings of the truthfulness of the truthful versus untruthful\nstatements. These results indicate our success in providing\ntwo different statements to subjects, which they readily\nJohnston et al. 5\ndistinguished as truthful versus untruthful (see Table 1 for\nt-test statistics).\nNext, we would like to bring the reader's attention to the\npattern of means and standard deviations presented in Table 1.\nAs indicated above, all the 11 items composing the DDCL as\nwell as the manipulation check item were rated by subjects on\n7-point scales. Whether the individual item scales were uni-\npolar, going from none of the attributes to a maximum of it,\nor bipolar, going from the extreme of untruthfulness to its\nopposite of total truthfulness, the score of 4 represents the\nmidpoint of every item scale. Thus, mean scores below 4\nwould indicate untruthfulness, whereas mean scores above 4\nwould indicate truthfulness. The potential importance of this\npoint is that it permits us to indicate not only whether an item\nis able to differentiate between levels of truthfulness but also\nwhether that item is able to differentiate between truthfulness\nand untruthfulness per se. We believe that it is important for\nthe mean scores on individual items in the truthful and\nuntruthful conditions to fall on opposite sides of their respec-\ntive scale midpoints because we are interested in not just the\nassessment of truthfulness along a continuum but categori-\ncally as well.\nWith regard to the 11 items composing the DDCL, sub-\nject's ratings differed significantly in the predicted direction\nin all but 2 of the items (expression of affect and self-serving\nstatements). Importantly, 7 of the 11 items exhibited both\nsignificantly different ratings between conditions as well as\ncontaining mean scores for the untruthful statement on oppo-\nsite sides of the item scale midpoint than the mean scores for\nthe truthful statement. These seven variables included clarity\nof detail, spatial information, temporal information, recon-\nstructability of the statement, realism of the statement, con-\ntextual information, and relevance of the details provided in\nthe statement. In addition, 2 of the items, perceptual detail\nand reproduction of conversation, yielded significant differ-\nences between the truthful and untruthful statements, but the\nmean scores for both conditions were on the same side of the\nitem scale midpoints.\nIn addition to examining the ability of the items to differ-\nentiate between the true and untrue statements, we thought it\nwould be interesting to see how each of the 11 items corre-\nlated with both the DDCL overall score and our measure of\nperceived truthfulness. We assumed that some of the items,\nespecially those assessing the realism of the statement, would\nbe more strongly associated with perceived truthfulness than\nother items such as temporal or spatial details. The percep-\ntion of how realistic a statement is appears to go to the heart\nof whether it is perceived as truthful. In addition, we were\nalso interested in the relationship between the DDCL overall\nscore and perceived truthfulness, in that, both these variables\nrepresent different approaches to the assessment of truthful-\nness: one directly, by simply asking the subject how truthful\nthey believed the statement to be, and the other indirectly, by\ncomputing an overall score composed of items believed to be\ncharacteristic of truthfulness. Table 2 presents the correla-\ntions between the 11 items and both the DDCL score and the\nmeasure of perceived truthfulness. In addition, the direct cor-\nrelation between DDCL scores and perceived truthfulness is\nalso reported in Table 2.\nFor ease of reading Table 2, the perceived truthfulness\nvariable was scored in the negative direction, thus obviating\nthe need for plus or minus signs. With this in mind, the cor-\nrelation between perceived truthfulness and the DDCL is\nrather strong (.57). Put another way, almost one third of the\nvariance in the perceived truthfulness of the statements is\naccounted for by DDCL scores. Not surprisingly, the\nTable 1. Means, Standard Deviations, and t-Test Values for the Truthful Versus Untruthful Statement on the Measure of Perceived\nTruthfulness, DDCL Scores, and the 11 Items Composing the DDCL.\nTruthful statement Untruthful statement\nt tests p\nNote. DDCL = Deception Detection Checklist.\n6 SAGE Open\nindividual items of the DDCL are, with one exception, more\nstrongly correlated with overall DDCL scores than the per-\nceived truthfulness variable. One would expect this given\nthat the overall DDCL score contains within it each of the 11\nitems with which it is being correlated. One would also\nexpect these correlations to be high if all the items from the\nDDCL do, in fact, measure different aspects or dimensions of\ntruthfulness, an assumption to be specifically explored\nbelow. Also not surprising, given the t-test results, is the poor\nperformance of the affect and self-serving variables with\nregard to their correlations with both the DDCL and per-\nceived truthfulness. In all, for the most part, the DDCL items\nhad correlations about twice as strong with the DDCL as\nwith the measure of perceived truthfulness. All but one of\nthese correlations were statistically significant, suggesting\nthat both the direct and indirect approaches to assessing the\ntruthfulness of a statement have utility.\nWith regard to our expectations regarding the possible\ndifferential pattern of correlations, we found it very interest-\ning that the realism variable was by far more strongly corre-\nlated with perceived truthfulness relative to any other item\nfrom the DDCL. Indeed, the realism variable was the only\none to be equally strongly correlated with both DDCL scores\nand perceived truthfulness (r = .64). In all, with two con-\nspicuous exceptions, the items from the DDCL significantly\ndifferentiate different levels of truthfulness as well as reveal\na pattern of correlations between the overall DDCL scores\nand perceived truthfulness, which is generally consistent\nwith expectation as well as being consistent with our clinical\nand forensic experiences.\nNext, we performed two series of factor analyses on our\ndata. The first set of factor analyses involved the 9 variables\ncapable of significantly differentiating between the true and\nuntrue statements in the predicted direction. Thus, the expres-\nsion of affect and self-serving statements variables were\nexcluded from all further analyses. For the purpose of the\nfirst factor analyses, we entered all 9 variables from both the\ntruthful and untruthful conditions, yielding a grand total of\n18 variables on which the factor analysis was performed.\nThere were a number of reasons we felt this would be the\nmost appropriate approach for performing an exploratory\nfactor analysis. Specifically, entering all 18 variables into the\nanalysis affords us the opportunity to compare head on the\nrelative importance of our variables with regard to their abil-\nity to differentiate between truthful and untruthful state-\nments.Forexample,doallofthevariableshaveapproximately\nthe same strength of relationship with truthfulness versus\nuntruthfulness or is it possible that some variables are more\nclosely associated with ratings of the true or the untrue state-\nment? In this regard and with reference to the concept of\nfactorial validity, we were hoping that our variables would\nyield a factor solution in which the factors clearly revolved\naround the themes of truthfulness and untruthfulness. In all,\nwe believed that this factor analysis would speak directly to\nthe construct validity of our variables as measures of both\ntruthfulness and untruthfulness while suggesting possible\ndifferential contributions to the identification of the true ver-\nsus untrue statements on the part of individual items.\nThe first factor analysis yielded three components. The\nfirst two factors clearly revolved around the themes of\nuntruthfulness versus truthfulness, while the third factor\naccounted for a trivial amount of variance and was based\nalmost entirely on the single item of reproduction of conver-\nsation. This was not especially surprising as this variable was\none of the weakest of the 11 items in our statistical tests of\nsignificant differences between the conditions. Criteria asso-\nciated with factor manipulation indicated the appropriateness\nof imposing a two-factor solution on our data (results are\npresented in Table 3).\nIt should first be noted that every variable used to assess\nthe untruthful statement loaded on Factor 1, which for obvi-\nous reason we have chosen to call the Untruthful factor.\nTable 2. Selected Correlations Between Perceived Truthfulness, DDCL Scores, and the 11 Items Composing the DDCL.\nDDCL score () probability Perceived truthfulness () probability\nReproduction of\nconversation\nNote. DDCL = Deception Detection Checklist.\nJohnston et al. 7\nSimilarly, every one of the variables used to assess the truth-\nful statement loaded on Factor 2, which we just as obviously\nwill refer to as the Truthful factor. As there are no significant\nloadings on Factor 1 of items used to rate the true statement,\nand no significant loadings on Factor 2 of items used to rate\nthe untrue statement (in fact, all of these factor loadings hov-\nered around 0), we have left these data out of the table.\nWe believe that these results are extremely interesting.\nFirst, and as already alluded to, the two-factor solution con-\nsists of Factor 1 containing only variables used to rate the\nuntruthful statement and Factor 2 containing only variables\nused to rate the truthful statement. We have inferred then that\nthe underlying theme of Factor 1 is untruthfulness and the\nunderlying theme of Factor 2 truthfulness. We also believe\nthat it is interesting to note the \"purity\" of the factors in that\nthe nine variables contributing to the analysis are very differ-\nent in content. While spatial and temporal information intui-\ntivelyseemsconnected,justlikerealismandreconstructability,\nthe first two variables do not appear to have any obvious\nconnection with the latter two. In other words, it seems clear\nfrom the factor analytic findings that the most powerful\nunderlying theme in the data is in fact the truthfulness versus\nuntruthfulness of the statements rated by our subjects.\nIt also bears noting that with one exception, the reproduc-\ntion of conversation variable in the untruthful condition,\nevery factor loading is between 0.6 and 0.8. While this is not\nsurprising as in the three-factor solution, reproduction of\nconversation essentially generated and accounted for the\nthird factor, it does suggest that otherwise all of our variables\ncontribute more or less about the same to the respective fac-\ntors on which they load. Indeed with the one exception of the\nreproduction of conversation variable, not one of the other\neight variables differed more than 0.1 from the truthful to\nuntruthful conditions. In other words, no obvious difference\nwas observed in any of these eight variables whether they\nwere being used to assess the true or untrue statement. With\nthe exception of the reproduction of conversation variable,\nnot one other variable appears to have been differentially\nconnected to the factor on which it loaded. Thus, clarity of\ninformation was approximately as important in assessing an\nuntruthful statement as it was in assessing a truthful state-\nment, and none of these eight variables was conspicuously\nmore important in its association with truthfulness versus\nuntruthfulness. While the eight variables differ with regard to\ntheir factor loadings, going from 0.6 to 0.8, a difference\nwhich itself represents a comparatively small range, the con-\nnection between the individual variables and the factors on\nwhich they load is roughly equivalent. In terms of the con-\ncept of factorial validity, these data appear particularly\nencouraging.\nOur final series of analyses involved performing two fac-\ntor analyses: one on the items used to rate the truthful state-\nment and the other on the items used to rate the untruthful\nstatement. For these two analyses, we used only those items\nthat were found to be significantly different in the predicted\ndirection and whose item means fell on opposite sides of the\nscale midpoints in their ratings of the truthful versus untruth-\nful statements. Thus, each of these seven items were capable\nTable 3. Factor Loadings for the 11 Items Composing the DDCL in the Combined Truthful and Untruthful Statement Conditions.\nUntruthful statement\nTruthful statement\nNote. DDCL = Deception Detection Checklist.\n8 SAGE Open\nof significantly distinguishing the true from untrue statement\nand did so in such a way as to indicate that the untruthful\nstatement was false and the truthful statement was true. As\ndiscussed earlier, these seven items could be considered,\npsychometrically, our best variables as they not only distin-\nguish different levels of truthfulness but can actually be used\nto distinguish between untruthful and truthful statements, per\nse. Beyond this, we also believed that conducting a factor\nanalysis using these items in the truthful versus untruthful\nstatement conditions would provide us with a direct opportu-\nnity to explore the possibility that the different variables may\nhave differential relationships or connections with true ver-\nsus untrue statements. While the results reported in Table 3\nindicate that these seven variables are more or less equally\nassociated with the assessment of truthful versus untruthful\nstatements, it is definitely possible that the seven different\nvariables may be relatively stronger or weaker in rating the\ntruthfulness of a statement depending on whether the state-\nment is true or false. In other words, it seemed likely that our\nvariables would be differentially sensitive or important with\nregard to the dimension of truthfulness versus\nuntruthfulness.\nFor example, as described above we believed that the\nvariable of realism would be especially important in assess-\ning whether a statement is true or untrue. By performing two\nfactor analyses, one based on the variables used to rate the\ntruthful statement and the other based on variables used to\nrate the untruthful statement, this would seem to afford the\nmost direct opportunity to compare head on the importance\nof our seven best variables in assessing true versus false\nstatements (results are presented in Table 4). The left side of\nTable 4 presents the results of the factor analysis on the items\nrating the truthful statement and the right side of the table\npresents the results of the factor analysis on the items rating\nthe untruthful statement. We should note here that we\nexpected this factor analysis would reveal some different\nrelationships between the items and anticipated factors.\nSpecifically, we reasoned that the variables connected with\nsituational information, such as the spatial, temporal, contex-\ntual, and clarity of details, might generate their own factor\ngiven what seems to be the obvious conceptual connection\nbetween these items. Similarly, we reasoned that the\nreconstructability, realism and relevance of details, variables\nwould be likely to form their own factor as these items also\nappear connected by a value judgment concerning the quality\nof the information in the statement. Candidly, we also\nexpected that these latter three variables, especially realism\nand reconstructability, would prove relatively stronger than\nthe situational variables in explaining the extracted factors as\nthese three variables reflected judgments of the statement\nthat seemed to directly overlap with the concept of truthful-\nness. Thus, while the presence of situational attributes is\nimportant in determining whether someone is speaking the\ntruth, we reasoned that realism, reconstructability, and the\nrelevance of what was said would be of primary importance\nin identifying truthful versus untruthful statements. We were,\ntherefore, frankly surprised, albeit pleasantly so, to see that\nthe two factor analyses yielded solutions composed of only\none factor each. The factor analysis on the seven items used\nto rate the true statement created one factor only as did the\nfactor analysis on the seven items used to rate the untrue\nstatement.\nExamination of the data presented in Table 4 indicates\nthat our expectations regarding items differentially contrib-\nuting to the factors received only very partial support. Indeed\nfor the factor analysis on the truthful condition items, every\none of the first four variables dealt with what we just\ndescribed as situational details, while the three variables with\nthe lowest loading were our so-called judgment variables.\nHowever, we do find it interesting to note that the single\nstrongest item factor correlation for the untruthful condition\nis for the reconstructability variable even though realism and\nrelevance remain more or less at the bottom of the list. It\nshould of course be noted that the single-factor solutions for\nthese two analyses speak directly to the construct validity of\nour measurement, indicating that each and every one of these\nseven variables does very well with regard to the assessment\nof both true and untrue statements. It also bears noting that\nthe entire item factor loading in both analyses was relatively\nquite high with no loading falling below 0.6. Finally, it\nshould be noted that more than 50% of the variance of the\ndata was accounted for in both factor solutions. If we were\ngoing to be disappointed in our results, it is difficult to imag-\nine a more pleasing disappointment.\nTable 4. Separate Seven-Item Factor Analyses for the Truthful and Untruthful Statement Conditions.\nTruthful statement Factor 1 Untruthful statement Factor 1\nJohnston et al. 9\nDiscussion\nWhile the deception detection literature indicates that people\nare generally rather bad at catching liars, apparently most\npeople assume that what others tell them is generally true,\nthe subjects in our study appear to have exhibited a lie bias.\nOur results reveal that the untruthful statement was perceived\nas more deceptive than the truthful statement was perceived\nas true. In addition, the untruthful statement was rated as\nmore deceptive with regard to overall DDCL scores than the\ntruthful statement was rated as true on this same measure. A\nlie bias is hardly surprising, given that our subjects were\nupper division college students in a forensic psychology\nclass assessing the statements of two men formally accused\nof child molestation. Even though it would seem desirable to\nhave neither a truth nor lie bias, we have the sense that in\nforensic psychological evaluations where the stakes can\ninclude incarceration and/or the loss or gain of considerable\namounts of money, a cautious, even wary, attitude on the part\nof the examiner may be a good thing. We also interpret these\ndata positively in that they suggest, consistent with other\nresearch (ten Brinke & Porter, 2013), that empirically based\ntechniques designed to detect deception can be taught.\nBeyond this, we believe that the foremost implication of\nour results is in demonstrating that the truthfulness of a state-\nment, at least in some situations, can be identified with a high\nlevel of reliability and internal validity. Clearly, the most\nconspicuous limitation of the present research is the fact that\nsubjects rated only two statements, both pertaining to\nextreme and extraordinary situations. It will not be possible\nto make any serious claims regarding the external validity or\ngeneralizability of our measure until such time as it has been\napplied to the assessment of a greater variety of statements.\nNeedless to say, the focus of future research would be to find\nout whether our measure, particularly the seven best items, is\nas reliable and significant in differentiating the truthfulness\nof client statements in a variety of other settings. While these\nitems demonstrated the ability to differentiate between levels\nof truthfulness of accused sex offenders, it would be interest-\ning to know whether they could do the same with regard to\ndifferentiating between clients actually suffering from rather\nthan feigning mental illness.\nWhile our subject's ratings of the perceived truthfulness\nof the two statements were strongly associated with overall\nDDCL scores, the two measures are clearly not the same\nthing and approach the assessment of truthfulness in funda-\nmentally different ways. Asking a subject to specifically rate\nthe truthfulness of a statement represents as direct an assess-\nment of truthfulness as one can imagine. However, of our\nseven psychometrically best items from the DDCL, four of\nthem deal with aspects or attributes of a situation that have\nno a priori or necessary connection with truthfulness, per se.\nWhy, for example, should information regarding spatial or\ntemporal detail be so strongly correlated with the perceived\ntruthfulness of a statement? While a clever sociopath could\ninclude in his or her statement these kinds of details, the\nrobust nature of these variables speaks directly to the idea\nthat true rather than internally manufactured experiences will\ninclude such \"real world\" information. Thus, while a knowl-\nedgeable sociopath could include such information in a false\nstatement, it seems obvious that it would require consider-\nable intellectual even scientific sophistication as well as sub-\nstantial forethought and cognitive rehearsal.\nIn contrast, variables, such as relevance, realism, and\nreconstructability, which reflect judgments regarding a state-\nment, seem to have a different relationship to the assessment\nof truthfulness, than situational attributes, such as spatial and\ntemporal details. We believe that the relatively high correla-\ntion between realism and perceived truthfulness is illustra-\ntive of a uniquely important relationship between these\nvariables. Of the many hundreds of psychological evalua-\ntions the senior author has performed on accused and con-\nvicted child molesters, it is striking how often the defendant's\nversion of the events which led to the criminal charges\nagainst him would seem unbelievable, if not outright absurd.\nIt is entirely common for many of these men to claim that the\nprimary reason they were being falsely accused of child sex-\nual abuse was that they were, in some important way, too\nnice, too generous, too caring, and too concerned regarding\nthe victim and the victim's family. While it is painfully\napparent that innocent persons are at times falsely accused of\nserious crimes, in the real world, it is vanishingly rare for a\nchild or children and their families to conspire together\nagainst a man, to falsely accuse him of molestation, just\nbecause that man had just been too kind or generous toward\nthat family. The present results clearly suggest how critical to\nthe assessment of truthfulness we believe the realism of the\nstatement can be. It is our impression that when statements\nare conspicuously unrealistic, the probable assessment of\ndeception dramatically increases.\nHowever, while the correlational data and tests of signifi-\ncance indicate the importance of realism to the evaluation of\ntruthfulness, the factor analyses of our best seven items sug-\ngest a rather different perspective. If one accepts at face\nvalue the data presented in Table 4, realism is by no means\nthe most important variable in assessing a statement's truth-\nfulness or untruthfulness. Indeed, the factor analysis on the\nseven items in the truthful condition suggests that the four\nsituational variables, clarity, temporal, spatial, and contex-\ntual detail, are all more important in the assessment of truth-\nfulness than the three judgment variables, relevance, realism,\nand reconstructability (i.e., the four situational variables load\nmore highly on the one extracted factor). These data suggest\nthat the foremost hallmark of a true statement could be the\nmundane even trifling little situational details included in it.\nSuch factual details which have little or no meaning in and of\nthemselves, when included in a person's statement may be\nemblematic of truth.\nIn addition, we find it equally interesting that in the factor\nanalysis for the seven items in the untruthful condition, the\nreconstructability variable has the single highest correlation\nwith the untruthful factor. While realism remains relatively\nlow in this factor analysis, reconstructability and realism still\nrepresent judgments about a statement that are conceptually\nrelated. Realism is fundamentally about the believability of a\nstatement, while reconstructability refers to its plausibility and\nlogical coherence. So in contrast to the assessment of truthful\nstatements, our data suggest that the evaluation of untrue state-\nments may have less to do with the situational attributes than\nwith the judgment that the statement is just too inconsistent,\ntoo contradictory, and too implausible to be possible.\nRather than risking further over interpretation of our\nresults, the most important point, in our opinion, is the fact\nthat the 2 seven-item factor analyses both yielded single-fac-\ntor solutions. As conceptually different as spatial information\nis from the judgment of the realism, all seven items in both\nconditions yielded single-factor solutions, indicating that\nthese seven items are all measuring the same thing and are\nconnected in some underlying fashion. Obviously, it is our\nbelief that the theme underlying the factor analytic data is the\ntruthfulness versus untruthfulness of the statements being\nevaluated. While we have yet to demonstrate the generaliz-\nability of our measure, its reliability and internal validity with\nregard to the present data seem clear. Our hope is to do further\nresearch on our seven best items to assess the extent to which\nthey possess external as well as internal validity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nJohnson, M.
