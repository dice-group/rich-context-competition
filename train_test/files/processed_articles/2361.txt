Social environmental\nrisk factors may include maternal stress and maternal perceptions of difficult infant\ntemperament. Objectives To examine factors that may predict or moderate maternal ratings\nof parenting stress and difficult temperament in cocaine-exposed (CE) infants. Method\nNeonatal behavior, infant temperament, parenting stress, and maternal psychopathology were\nmeasured in a large sample of infant\u00admother dyads with prenatal CE and a nonexposed com-\nparison sample. Participants were drawn from an existing longitudinal data set (Maternal\nLifestyle Study). Result Relations between neonatal behavior and infant temperament rat-\nings were moderated by mothers' ratings of parenting stress. Relations between neonatal cry and\nparenting stress were moderated by maternal psychopathology ratings. Results were unrelated\nto drug exposure history. Conclusions For mothers of at risk infants (with or without\nprenatal CE), psychological distress affects the degree to which infant behavioral characteristics\nare experienced as stressful or difficult. Implications for treatment and outcome are discussed.\nKey words cocaine; parenting stress; temperament.\nPrenatal exposure to cocaine is a marker of developmental\nrisk. Disruptions in the infant\u00adparent dyad are an\nimportant component of this risk status (Beeghly &\nbecause prenatal exposure and maternal substance\nabuse is a marker--and not a determinant--of risk, a\nrange of social, environmental, and biological factors\nwill moderate developmental outcomes in this popula-\ntion. Therefore, an important goal for research is to\nidentify factors that may either magnify or attenuate risk\nin cocaine-exposed (CE) infants. Two dyadic factors that\nare likely to mark a heightened risk for this vulnerable\npopulation are the degree to which mothers perceive\ntheir parental role as highly stressful and the degree to\nwhich they perceive their infant as temperamentally dif-\nficult. The goal of this study was to understand pro-\ncesses that may heighten or attenuate the levels of\nparenting stress and perceptions of infant temperament\nin a sample of infants exposed prenatally to cocaine.\nHigh levels of maternal stress have been found to\nrelate to poor behavioral outcomes in young children\ntion, maternal ratings of infant temperament have been\nfound to predict maternal behaviors (Milliones, 1978)\nand child behavioral outcomes (Sanson, Oberklaid,\nPedlow, & Prior, 1991).

For infants with pre-\nnatal cocaine exposure, an understanding of relations\nbetween these dyadic factors will help to identify dyads\nat highest risk for subsequent developmental difficulties.\nIdentifying moderators of risk will help to better tar-\nget prevention and treatment efforts for those infants at\nhighest risk and for those developmental and dyadic\ndomains of functioning that operate most strongly on\ndevelopmental and mental health outcomes. For this\nresearch, we examined the role of maternal characteris-\ntics such as maternal substance abuse history and mater-\nnal psychopathology as potential moderators of\nlongitudinal relations between neonatal behavioral char-\nacteristics and parenting stress. We were interested in\nratings of parenting stress as an important outcome in\nand of itself. However, it was also recognized that the\ndegree of stress that a mother experiences may also\nimpact her perception of and reactions to her infant.\nThus, we also investigated whether parenting stress\nwould prove to moderate relations between neonatal\nbehavior and later maternal ratings of temperament.\nWe assumed that there is some consistency of infant\ncharacteristics over the course of the first 4\u00ad6 months of\nlife. Stable individual differences in infant temperament\nratings have been demonstrated when infant behavioral\ncharacteristics are measured objectively and with an\nemphasis on such phenomena as irritability and reactiv-\ndocumented the stability of behavior and temperament\nfor infants who presented with extremes of such behav-\nioral tendencies or where there are other objective indi-\nces of risk (Anderson et.al., 1989; Worobey & Lewis,\n1989). Thus, studies indicate that neonatal characteris-\ntics such as irritability and reactivity may have predictive\nvalidity when measured at their extremes, or for infants\nwho may be otherwise at risk for developmental prob-\nlems. Though there is some evidence for stability in tem-\nperament ratings in cocaine-exposed infants (Smith,\n1999), there are likely to be individual and contextual\ninfluences on the degree of stability of temperament in\ninfancy (Wachs & Kohnstamm, 2001). CE infants may\nnot show the same degree of stability in temperament\nseen in nonexposed populations. Thus, it will be impor-\ntant to understand whether relations between and within\nbehavioral domains are affected by prenatal drug expo-\nsure or other characteristics of the infant\u00adparent dyad.\nCE infants have previously been found to display\natypical patterns on measures of neonatal regulation and\nreactivity (DiPietro, Suess, Wheeler, Smouse, & Newlin,\ntions for the study reported here. Because at least a subset\nof CE neonates show a heightened pattern of reactivity,\nthere may be an increased likelihood that these infants\nwill be perceived as more difficult by caregivers and that\nthis may also relate to the degree of stress that a care-\ngiver experiences as a parent. However, it can be\nassumed that relations between infant temperament and\nmaternal attitudes and behavior are bidirectional, with\ninfant temperament and parental attitudes having recip-\nrocal effects over time (Wachs & Kohnstamm, 2001).\nAn additional assumption of this study was that par-\nent ratings of infant temperament are the product not\njust of infant behavior but also of parental perceptions of\nthese behaviors (Bates, 1980). Certain behaviors, such\nas persistent infant crying, may be experienced as partic-\nularly stressful (Papousek & von Hofacker, 1998). How-\never, parents vary in the degree to which they find infant\nbehaviors stressful. For instance, Pedersen, Huffman,\ndel Carmen, and Bryan (1996) found that pregnant\nwomen who rated recordings of unfamiliar infant cries\nas aversive were more likely to subsequently (i.e., 3\nmonths postnatal) rate their own infant's temperament\nas fussy and difficult. These mothers also varied in their\ncardiac reactivity to infant cries. In other words,\nalthough objective differences in cry may be generally\nexperienced as more or less stressful, parents differ in\ntheir reactivity and potential susceptibility to stressful\ninfant behaviors. Research also indicates that perceived\ninfant characteristics interact with caregiver psychopa-\nthology to predict later parental perceptions of infants as\nmore or less stressful (Gefland, Teti, & Fox, 1992).\nSuch effects have not been studied specifically in\ncocaine- or drug-exposed populations. However, factors\nthat affect whether infants are likely to be viewed as dif-\nficult and stressful may be particularly salient in drug-\nusing populations. Mothers who have used cocaine or\nother drugs during pregnancy appear more likely than\nnondrug-using mothers to have comorbid psychiatric\ndiagnoses and to have experienced past traumatic events\n(Hans, 1999). In addition, there is some evidence that as\na group, mothers with a history of substance abuse expe-\nrience greater levels of parenting-related stress (Kelley,\n1992). The presence of psychiatric symptoms, whether\nfor parents with or without substance abuse histories,\nmay result in or reflect diminished personal coping\nresources, thereby making it more difficult for them to\nrespond adaptively to the stressors of parenting.\nThis study examines the relations between neonatal\nbehavior and later measures of parenting stress and\nInteractions Between Maternal Characteristics and Neonatal Behavior 29\nparental perception of temperament at 4 months of age\nin a sample of children with prenatal cocaine exposure\nand their caregivers, and a comparison sample of non-\nCE infants. The sample was drawn from a longitudinal\nstudy of prenatal drug exposure, the Maternal Lifestyle\nStudy (Lester, 1998). The evidence reviewed above sug-\ngests that neonatal and parent characteristics may have\ninteractive effects on later parenting stress and percep-\ntion of temperament. However, there has been little\nresearch that has specifically addressed these issues in\nCE infants. The central question to be addressed in this\nstudy was whether parental characteristics, such as\nmaternal substance abuse history, parenting stress, and\npsychopathology, would modify relations between\nobjective measures of neonatal behaviors and later\nmaternal ratings of infant temperament. Also, we tested\nwhether maternal drug use and psychopathology inter-\nacted with neonatal behavioral characteristics to explain\nindividual differences in parenting related stress in early\ninfancy. To answer these questions, the linear relations\nbetween neonatal behavior and later measures of parenting\nstress and maternal perception of infant temperament\nwere also examined.\nMethods\nSubjects\nParticipants were drawn from the Maternal Lifestyle\nStudy (MLS), an investigation of the effects of prenatal\ncocaine or opiate exposure on child outcome in a longi-\nchildren divided into an exposed group and a compari-\nson group (Lester, 1998). Infants were entered into the\n\"exposed\" group if there was either maternal report of\ncocaine or opiate use during the pregnancy based on\nhospital interview or positive meconium assay (positive\nenzyme multiple immunoassay (EMIT) screen followed\nby positive gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy).\nInfants were entered into the comparison group if there\nwas maternal denial of cocaine or opiate use and a nega-\ntive EMIT screen for cocaine and opiate metabolites.\nGroups were matched on prematurity, race, and sex.\nInfants were excluded from the MLS if they had a chro-\nmosomal abnormality or TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other\nagents, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes) infection con-\nfirmed before the 1-month assessment or if the mother\nplanned to move outside of the study catchment area.\nAdditional information on the severity of prenatal\ncocaine exposure was determined by interview with\nmothers at 1-month corrected age using the Maternal\nInventory of Substance Use (MISU; Shankaran et.al.,\n1996). Dyads were classified into three groups: no pre-\nnatal exposure, some exposure, and heavy exposure\n(defined as reported cocaine use of 3 days per week\nduring the first trimester; see Lester et.al., 2002).\nMLS is conducted under the auspices of the\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-\nment (NICHD), Neonatal Research Network at Brown\nUniversity, University of Miami, University of Tennessee,\nMemphis, and Wayne State University. MLS was given a\n\"certificate of confidentiality\" from the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, which allowed\nthe study to maintain participant confidentiality with\nregard to drug-use information. The certificate of confiden-\ntiality applied specifically to information regarding mater-\nnal use of drugs and left in force all reporting requirements\nwith regard to suspicion of child abuse or child neglect.\nParticipants were fully informed of their rights and limits\nas study participants, including limits to confidentiality,\nand informed consent was obtained from all caregivers, as\napproved by review boards at each study site.\nFor this article, children were selected from the\nMLS if they were in the care of their biological mother\n(regardless of drug exposure grouping). This resulted in\na subsample of 984 children with data on measures of\nneonatal behavior and 4-month measures of maternal\npsychopathology, parenting stress, and temperament\nratings. We included only biologically related dyads\nbecause we were interested in the phenomenon of pre-\nnatal cocaine exposure as related to both the infant\nexposed to the drug and the mother who had used\ncocaine during pregnancy. Because of differential rates\nof foster placements, infants who were excluded (n = 404)\nwere more likely to have been in the CE group than\nthose who were retained for this study (65% vs. 40%, 2\nysis reported in this article varied slightly because of\nmissing data. Unless otherwise noted, the children\nexcluded from specific analyses did not differ from those\nincluded (e.g., in birth weight, race, sex, and exposure\nstatus). All infant ages reported are corrected for obstet-\nric estimate of gestational age at birth.\nMeasures\nNeonatal Behavior\nNeonatal measures were chosen to represent objective\nmeasures of individual differences in neonatal reactivity.\nInfants were assessed at 1-month corrected age with the\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)-Network Neuro-\nbehavioral Scales (NNNS; Lester & Tronick, 1994) and an\nacoustic analysis of infant cry. The NNNS and cry mea-\nsures were aggregated into two cumulative indices, each\nrepresenting the degree to which infants were highly\nreactive to the procedures. A summary of these measures is\nbelow, followed by a detailed description of the aggregation\nprocess and scale development.\nThe NNNS was developed by the NICHD NICU\nNetwork for use in MLS and has been used previously in\na study of CE newborn infants (Napiorkowski et al.,\n1996). The NNNS is a semistructured and comprehensive\nexamination of neurological integrity and behavioral\nfunction in the newborn. Methods and items were\nadapted from the Brazelton examination and also\ninclude an assessment of stress signs that can be\nobserved over the course of the NNNS administration.\nThe NNNS includes 45 items administered in packages\nof items. In addition, there are 21 summary items that\nare intended to reflect overall functioning during the\nexamination. A rating of the presence or absence of 50\nstress signs, grouped into 7 categories, is also made by\nthe examiner.\nFor the cry analyses, a cry-eliciting stimulus was\nadministered to the infant's foot, and cries were subse-\nquently analyzed off-line by a computer system designed\nfor this purpose (Cry Research, Inc., Brookline, MA) and\nused previously in studies of drug-exposed infants (Corwin\nlatency to cry, number and length of utterances, and a\nnumber of acoustic features.\nThe NNNS and cry measures were used in this\nstudy as objective measures of neonatal reactivity. A\ncumulative index approach was used to aggregate vari-\nables from these procedures into composite measures of\nneonatal reactivity. Each item from the NNNS and the\nCry analysis was dichotomized so as to reflect extreme\nresponding or scores. Dichotomization was on an item-\nby-item level, with dichotomized items being summed\nto create two continuous variables, one for the NNNS\nprocedure and one for cry measure. Final items included\nin the NNNS and cry aggregate measures, as well as a\ndescription of these items, are presented in Appendices\nA and B, along with estimates of internal consistency.\nFor each item on the NNNS, children whose item\nscore was in the upper or lower (depending the direc-\ntion of scoring) quintile of respondents received a code\nof \"1\" to indicate an extreme score. Nonextreme\nresponders received a code of \"0\". This upper or lower\nquintile rule was altered for some items to ensure that\nonly clinically meaningful scores were coded as\nextreme (e.g., where the original cut point would have\nresulted in the assignment of a score of \"1\" to behav-\niors that would be considered normative based on\nguidelines in the NNNS scoring manual). The final set\nof items was determined through an a priori, iterative\nprocess of selecting those items that on face value\nreflected high temperamental reactivity, and then\nexcluding the remaining variables that reduced the\ninternal consistency of the scale. The resulting scale\nincluded 38 items from the NNNS ( = .72). The\npotential range for the cumulative NNNS risk score\nwas 0\u00ad38. Items with missing data received a score of\n0. Only children with scores on 75% of NNNS items\nwere included in the analyses.\nCry variables were dichotomized in a similar manner\nto the NNNS variables so as to identify children most\nhighly reactive to the eliciting stimulus. Cry variables\nwere dropped from the final scale if they reduced inter-\nnal consistency. The resulting scale included 12 items\n( = .59). For each item a child could receive a score of\neither 1 (risk) or 0 (no risk). The resulting aggregate\nmeasure had a potential range of 0\u00ad12. Thus, cry cumu-\nlative index scores reflect extremes in the duration and\nintensity of the cry response.\n4-Month Outcome Variables\nCaregivers were administered a series of self-report\nquestionnaires when infants were 4-months corrected\nage. Because of variations in reading competency in the\nMLS sample, these questionnaires were read to all moth-\ners. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Desrogatis,\n1993) was administered as measure of maternal psycho-\npathology. The total score (Global Severity Index) was\nused in this study. The Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI;\nAbidin, 1983) was used to assess the degree of parenting\nstress experienced by caregivers. The shortened 36-item\nversion of the PSI was used. The PSI yields a total score\nand 3 factor scores (Parental Distress, Parent\u00adChild\nDysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child). A sum\nof the Parental Distress and Parent\u00adChild Dysfunctional\nInteraction scores were used for the this study to avoid\nconfounding the measure of parenting stress with rat-\nings of infant temperament. Finally, a modified version\nof the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ; Rothbart,\n1981) was administered as a measure parent-reported\nchild temperament (modifications, approved by M. K.\nRothbart, included simplification of language for the\nMLS population and reduction of response scale to five\npoints). The IBQ yields six summary scales: Activity\nLevel, Smiling and Laughter, Distress to Novelty, Distress\nto Limitations, Soothability, and Duration of Orienting.\nThe Distress to Novelty and Distress to Limitations\nscales were used for this study. These scales were chosen\nbecause of our interest in examining relations between\nreactivity at the two age points.\nInteractions Between Maternal Characteristics and Neonatal Behavior 31\nResults\nResults are presented in three sections. First, descriptive\nstatistics will be presented for the 1- and 4-month mea-\nsures, including both child and maternal variables. Sec-\nond, correlation analyses of relations amongst study\nvariables will be presented. And third, a series of hierar-\nchical regression analyses are presented as a test of the\nmain question posed by this study: whether child and\nparent variables would interact in their prediction of\nparenting stress and temperament ratings. We note here\nthat there were a small number of dyads in the CE group\nthe CE sample included in these analyses). The analyses\nreported below were run with and without these 36\ndyads, and exclusion of these children did not signifi-\ncantly affect the results. Thus, because the interest in\nthis article was to examine relations between maternal\nand infant characteristics in the first 4 months of life, we\nretained the data for these dyads and will refer to the\ntwo groups as CE and nonexposed.\nPreliminary Analyses\nChildren in the exposed group were lower in SES (socio-\neconomic status) than those in the nonexposed group\n(see Table I). The analysis with the 3-group exposure\nseverity score also revealed a significant effect of prena-\n.001. Nonexposed dyads were higher in SES than dyads\nin the \"heavy\" exposure group (p = .001), but the light\nexposure group did not differ from either the nonex-\nposed or heavy exposure groups. Exposed dyads did not\ndiffer from nonexposed on PSI scores. However, when\ntested with the three group severity variable a group\np < .001. Multiple comparisons indicated that the non-\nexposed dyads had lower PSI scores than both the light\nexposure group (p = .01) and the heavy exposure group\n(p = .001). Otherwise, there were no other significant\ndifferences between exposed and nonexposed children on\nthe study variables. The PSI total scores were distributed\nin a similar manner to the norms for this measure. Across\ncohorts, 53% scored above the median, and 24% scored\nabove the 80th percentile on this measure. However,\n28% of the overall sample scored above clinical cutoff on\nthe total score of the BSI (32% for the CE group, 26% for\nIt should be noted that this study required the\nselection of biologic mothers. Infants from excluded\ndyads (i.e., in foster care) received lower ratings on the\nIBQ Distress to Limitations scale, were slightly lower in\nally higher scores on the NNNS cumulative score. Care-\ngivers of excluded dyads had lower scores on the PSI\nand BSI.\nCorrelation Analyses\nCorrelation analyses examining the relations amongst\nstudy variables are presented in Table II. SES correlated\nsignificantly with five of the six measures (two neonatal\nmeasures and four measures at 4-months of age). Lower\nSES was related to greater neonatal reactivity, higher rat-\nings of distress to novelty and limits, and higher parent-\ning stress and psychological distress in mothers. NNNS\nscores were significantly and positively related to 4-\nmonth Distress to Limits scores, whereas Cry scores\nTable I.

This revision allows for the application of the SES\nmeasure to nonnuclear families. The scale retains the traditionally weighted educational and occupational scale scores.\nwere positively related to Distress to Novelty scores.\nNeither the NNNS nor the Cry scores were correlated\nwith maternal ratings of parenting stress or psychopa-\nthology.\nAmongst 4-month measures, consistent correlations\nwere observed between scores on the IBQ scales, PSI,\nand BSI scores. Higher parenting stress was related to\nhigher maternal ratings of infants' distress to novelty\nand limitations. Maternal ratings of infant distress to\nnovelty and distress to limitations were both positively\ncorrelated with maternal psychological distress, as mea-\nsured by the BSI. The IBQ Distress to Limitations scores\ncorrelated at above .25 for both PSI and BSI scores. In\naddition, the measure of parenting stress (PSI) and mater-\nnal psychopathology (BSI) were moderately correlated.\nRegression Analyses\nA series of hierarchical regression analyses were per-\nformed to test whether the influence of early infant\nbehavioral characteristics on later parenting stress and\ntemperament ratings would vary depending on factors in\nthe infant\u00adparent dyad. In each regression model, drug\nexposure, SES, child gender, and MLS study site were\nentered at step 1 (study site was entered because it was a\ncommon finding that infants differed on a variety of\nMLS variables across study site). Neonatal Cry and\nNNNS scores were entered at the second step to model\nthe main effect of neonatal behavior on later maternal\nand temperament measures. The main effects of the\nmaternal ratings were entered at step 3. The interaction\nterms relevant for each hypothesis were entered at the\nfourth step in each model. For the models testing the\ninteractions between maternal drug abuse (infant expo-\nsure status) and neonatal behavioral measures, variables\nwere entered in three steps, with the interaction terms\nentered at the final step in the model. For these analyses,\ntwo sets of regressions were performed, one using the\ntwo-group exposure variable and one using the three-\ngroup exposure severity measure.\nParenting Stress Ratings\nMaternal psychopathology ratings explained a signifi-\ncant amount of variance in parenting stress (PSI scores)\nafter controlling for child gender, exposure status, and\nneonatal behavior (see Table III). There was some evi-\ndence for an effect of exposure status (i.e., maternal\ncocaine or opiate use during pregnancy) on parenting\nstress, although this effect was not significant after con-\ntrolling for maternal psychopathology (BSI scores). SES\nscores explained a significant amount of variance in later\nPSI scores, with lower SES being associated with higher\nscores on the PSI. There was a significant interaction\nbetween BSI scores and the Cry index in predicting\nregression slopes within BSI quartile ranges. This analy-\nsis indicated that the relation between neonatal cry and\nTable II.

However, the relations between\nCry and PSI scores were not significant within these\nsubgroups of BSI scores, even for the upper quartile.\nAdditional analyses were performed by splitting the BSI\nsample by criteria defined in the BSI manual, which\ndefines a case in two different ways: (a) individuals with\nscores above the 90th percentile of the normative distri-\nbution on the GSI and (b) individuals with elevations on\ntwo or more BSI subscales. We split the sample in these\ntwo ways and examined regression slopes and correla-\ntions between the Cry and PSI scores. The resulting\nregression coefficients were not significantly different\nA separate analysis was performed to test the effect of\nthe cocaine exposure-by\u00adneonatal behavior interaction\non later PSI scores. The interaction between prenatal CE\nand neonatal behavior was not a significant predictor of\nmaternal self-reported parenting stress on the PSI. This\nwas true for models using the two-group exposure status\nvariable and the three-group exposure severity variable.\nTemperament Ratings\nThe second hypothesis for this study was whether neo-\nnatal reactivity (rated from the NNNS and Cry scales)\nwould predict later maternal ratings of infant tempera-\nment, and whether parenting stress and psychopathol-\nogy would moderate such relations. The Distress to\nLimitations scale from the IBQ was chosen as the depen-\ndent measure of temperament because of its conceptual\nsimilarity to the measures of neonatal reactivity\nemployed in this study. Results are presented in Table IV.\nNNNS, parenting stress, and parent psychopathology\nself-report scores each showed significant unique rela-\ntions to IBQ ratings after controlling for effects of gen-\nder, SES, and study site. Thus, children who showed\nmore reactivity on the NNNS and whose mothers\nreported more parenting related stress and psychological\ndistress were rated as being higher in distress to limita-\ntions at 4 months of age.\nIn addition to these main effects, there was a signifi-\ncant interaction between parenting-stress and neonatal\nreactivity on the NNNS in predicting maternal ratings of\ninfants' distress to limitations. We investigated this\ninteraction between PSI and NNNS scores by examining\nthe relation between NNNS scores and IBQ Distress to\nLimitations ratings within quartile ranges of the PSI dis-\ntribution. These analyses indicated that this relation was\nstronger in dyads where mothers reported higher\nparenting-related stress, specifically for dyads with PSI\nscores in the upper two quartiles of the distribution.\nSeparate regression analyses for the dyads above and\nbelow the PSI median were run. Covariates were entered\nat the first step (gender, exposure, SES, and study site),\nand the NNNS variable was entered at the second step.\nNNNS scores did not add significantly to the model for\nlow PSI dyads. In fact, the overall model for this sub-\nFor the high PSI subgroup, NNNS scores showed a\nsignificant unique relation with IBQ scores after control-\nin Figure 1 where the relations between NNNS and IBQ\nscores are plotted for dyads below and above the median\nsplit in PSI scores.\nWe also examined the relation between PSI scores\nand IBQ Distress to Limitation scores within ranges of\nTable IV.

This analysis indicated that the relation\nbetween PSI and IBQ scores were of similar magnitude\n(and in the same direction) for both children with high\nand low NNNS reactivity scale scores. Overall, these\nanalyses indicate that reactivity at 1 month as measured\nby the NNNS is predictive of IBQ Distress to Limitations\nratings at 4 months, but that this relation is moderated\nby the degree of parenting related stress experienced by\nmothers.\nA separate analysis was performed to test the effect\nof the cocaine exposure-by\u00adneonatal behavior interac-\ntion on the maternal ratings of infant temperament. As\nwith the analysis of parenting stress ratings, the interac-\ntion between prenatal CE and neonatal behavior was not\na significant predictor of mothers' rating of the IBQ Dis-\ntress to Limitation scale. Again, no exposure by neonatal\nbehavior interaction was found for either the two-group\nexposure variable or the three-group exposure severity\nvariable.\nIt is possible that the observed interaction between\nPSI and NNNS scores in predicting 4-month distress to\nlimitations reflected dyads where infants were most con-\nsistently reactive during the first 4 months of life. As\nreported above, we did observe some modest stability of\nindividual differences in reactivity from 1 to 4 months of\nage (i.e., there was a significant relation between NNNS\nscores and 4-month distress to limitations ratings).\nHowever, the interaction between NNNS and IBQ Dis-\ntress to Limitations scores in explaining variance in PSI\nscores at 4 months was nonsignificant. This was tested\nby regressing NNNS scores, IBQ scores, and the NNNS\u00ad\nIBQ interaction on 4-month PSI scores. As with the\nother regression models, gender, exposure status, SES,\nand site were entered at an initial step in the model. The\noverall model was significant, Model: R2 = 0.13, F (7,\nNeither NNNS scores nor the NNNS\u00adIBQ interaction\nadded significantly to the model.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study revealed that in two cohorts of\ninfant\u00admother dyads, one with prenatal cocaine or opiate\nexposure and a nonexposed control sample, neonatal\nbehavioral characteristics and certain maternal psycho-\nlogical characteristics interacted to predict maternal rat-\nings of temperament, and maternal self-reports of\nparenting stress. Specifically, an accumulation of behav-\nioral signs of extreme neonatal reactivity on a behavioral\nexamination (the NNNS) predicted higher maternal rat-\nings of infant reactivity (IBQ Distress to Limitations) at 4-\nmonths corrected age, though primarily for dyads where\nthe mother was experiencing more stress related to\nparenting. There was some indication that extreme char-\nacteristics of neonatal cry interacted with maternal psy-\nchopathology in predicting self-reported parenting stress\n3 months later. However, maternal psychopathology was\notherwise unrelated to earlier measures of neonatal cry\nand behavior. Thus, maternal characteristics (stress and\npsychopathology) interacted with neonatal reactivity to\nexplain variability in later maternal ratings of parenting\nstress and maternal ratings of infant temperament. These\ninteractive effects were most evident in accounting for\nvariance in mothers' temperament ratings at 4 months.\nThese results were not affected by mothers' sub-\nstance abuse history. Substance use or exposure group-\nings did not differ on study variables. In addition,\nsubstance use or exposure did not interact with neonatal\nbehavior to predict 4-month outcome measures. These\nfindings do not support the prediction that maternal\nsubstance abuse history would moderate the ways in\nwhich mothers perceived their infants. Rather, these\nfindings suggest that the degree to which neonatal reactivity\nFigure 1.

However, we did observe a small but signifi-\ncant relation between 1-month observations and 4-\nmonth ratings of infant reactivity. In so far as parent rat-\nings reflect both objective and perceived individual dif-\nferences in infant behavior, this can be interpreted as\nshowing only a modest level of stability in early infant\nbehavior, at least within the domain of reactivity. We\ndid not find evidence that levels of parenting stress\ndepended on the degree of stability in high infant reac-\ntivity, although alternate study designs would be able to\naddress this question more directly. Thus, although not\nthe only possible interpretation, the results reported\nhere are at least consistent with the view that parents\nvary in how they react to and experience the early\nbehavioral characteristics of their infants (e.g., Wachs &\nKohnstamm, 2001). The important finding here is that\nthese processes are at play in dyads with and without a\nhistory of prenatal drug exposure and use.\nThe exclusionary criteria used in selecting dyads for\nthe analyses in this article may help to explain the null\nfindings for the main effects of prenatal drug exposure.\nThis leads us to be cautious when drawing conclusions\nabout the neurobehavioral functioning of CE infants on\nthe neonatal behavioral examination (the NNNS) and\nthe cry analyses. Subjects included in this study were\nmore extreme in their neonatal cry and behavior than\nthose excluded from analyses (i.e., those included had\nhigher scores on the NNNS and Cry cumulative mea-\nsures). Furthermore, those excluded from analyses were\nmore likely to have been exposed to cocaine and opiates\nduring pregnancy. These differences suggest that the\nresults reported here should not form the basis for con-\nclusions about drug exposure effects on the early behav-\nioral presentation of drug-exposed infants. Rather, these\nresults suggest that, regardless of exposure status, the\nmanner in which caregivers react to and cope with chal-\nlenging infant behaviors can be expected to affect infant\ndevelopment.\nNeither objective neonatal cry nor neonatal behav-\nior was directly related to later parenting stress and\nmaternal psychopathology. The study design and nature\nof the measures used may have limited the possibility of\nobserving such relations. If neonatal cry and behavior\nhad been measured differently, for instance, so as to\nsample extremes in the duration of cry or other behav-\niors over time, we may indeed have found such relations\n(see Papousek & von Hofacker, 1998). In addition,\nobjective measures of child behavior and parental stress\nmay be more tightly related when these domains are\nassessed concurrently.\nIn addition, we observed only modest relations\nbetween behavioral measures in neonatal period and\ntemperament measured at 4 months of age. Aspects of\nour measurement may have attenuated relations\nbetween the 1- and 4-month measures. Past findings of\nstability of individual differences in infant tempera-\nment across time have used behavioral observations\n(vs. parent report) at both time points (e.g., Riese,\n1987), whereas this study utilized behavior observa-\ntion at time 1 and parent ratings at time 2. In addition,\nit should be noted that the internal consistency of the\ncry scale used in this study was somewhat low. This\nreflects measurement error that limits the magnitude of\nrelations that could be observed between cry and other\nvariables.\nBut beyond these measurement and methodological\nfactors, the small (though significant) relations between\n1- and 4-month reactivity scores (i.e., 1-month NNNS\nscores and 4-month IBQ Distress to Limitations ratings)\nsuggests that there was variability in the degree to which\ninfants displayed stable characteristics in the domain of\nearly reactivity. The interaction between NNNS and PSI\nscores in predicting 4-month temperament ratings is\nconsistent with differential stability in early tempera-\nment ratings (resulting in higher parenting stress for\nthose with high 1- and 4-month reactivity ratings), but\nis also consistent with differential parent perceptions of\ninfant behavioral tendencies. As argued above, our data\nare suggestive of the latter of these two possibilities, but\nthese results are not definitive in this regard.\nClearly there are several alternative, though not\nmutually exclusive, scenarios that may explain the inter-\nactions observed in this study. First, the moderating\neffect of parenting stress on the relation between objec-\ntive measures of neonatal behavior and later subjective\nmaternal ratings of infant temperament may be driven\nby a subset of children who evidence persistent irritable\nand difficult behaviors over the first 4 months of life. We\ncould not test this mechanism because objective mea-\nsures of infant behavior at 4-months of age were not\navailable. However, there is prior evidence for stability\nin temperamental reactivity in the neonatal period and\nSecond, highly reactive neonates may elicit care-\ngiver behaviors that may either potentiate or moderate\nthese initial qualities. Highly stressed mothers may be\nless able to respond to infants' difficult behaviors in a\npositive or sensitive manner. Their subsequent ratings of\ndifficult temperament may be an accurate view of their\ninfant's temperamental qualities, even if these qualities\nwere in part shaped by earlier parental behavior (see\nCrockenberg & Acredolo, 1983). Maternal psychopa-\nthology or parenting stress may also serve to alter the\nmanner in which parents respond to infants. This effect\nmay in part operate on the salience that mothers attach\nto infant behaviors, such as distress signs, although\nsome recent research suggests that this effect may differ\nin direction (i.e., increased or decreased salience)\ndepending on maternal diagnosis (e.g., Schuetze &\nZeskind, 2001). This interpretation may be highly rele-\nvant to the relation between 1-month reactivity and 4-\nmonth distress to limitations ratings. The behavioral\nindex of reactivity derived from the NNNS reflects per-\nhaps a more subtle flavor of difficult or challenging\nbehaviors than would be reflected in, for example,\nextreme and persistent cries. Thus, the behavioral ten-\ndencies reflected in the NNNS measure may not be seen\nas universally aversive, but rather may elicit different\nparental reactions depending on the degree of parenting\nstress experienced by a mother.\nThird, parents who rate their children as difficult at\n4 months of age may be partially accurate in their ratings\nof infant temperament, although their general level of\nparenting stress may result in exaggerated ratings of\ntheir infants' temperamental qualities. Past research\nshowing that parental characteristics affect the percep-\ntions of infant cries is consistent with this view (Crowe\nsis could be tested by examining discrepancies between\nsubjective (parental) and objective (laboratory) ratings\nof infant behavior.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study can be\nviewed at multiple levels. On one level, it may be that a\nconfluence of maternal and infant risk factors, in the\nwider context of socioeconomic risks, may portend later\ndevelopmental and dyadic difficulties. On another level,\nit may be that more specific patterns in the infant\u00adparent\ndyadic relationship will provide a glimpse into the\nmechanisms for these broader risks. Such mechanisms\nwould conceivably include mismatches between objec-\ntive measures and subjective ratings of infant cry and\nreactivity of mothers to infant cry and behavior (Crowe\nthe dyad to manage developmental challenges (Beeghly\n& Tronick, 1994). In this regard, evidence that there are\nconcurrent relations between parental perception of\ninfant irritability and parental responsiveness (Owens,\nShaw, & Vondra, 1998) points to one potential linkage\nbetween caregiver experiences of neonatal difficult\nbehavior, parenting stress, and infant outcomes.\nThese conclusions should not be taken as a wholly\npessimistic view of the outcome of children with prena-\ntal cocaine exposure. Recent evidence suggests that\nintervention programs, including those that target both\nchildren and caregivers, can have a positive effect on\nchild outcomes in this at-risk population (Claussen,\nScott, Mundy, & Katz, 2004). Although it is not yet clear\nwhich types of interventions can reduce parenting stress\nin dyads with prenatal cocaine exposure, the effect of\ndyadic psychotherapies on parenting stress and paren-\ntal attitudes has been documented in other popula-\ntions (Cohen, Lojkasek, Muir, Muir, & Parker, 2002;\nFeinfield & Baker, 2004). Recent evidence also suggests\nthat parenting stress and parenting attitudes may moder-\nate outcomes in at-risk drug-exposed populations\nClarifying child and parent characteristics that serve\nto protect against the risks posed by prenatal drug expo-\nsure is a critical goal for research. The degree of stress\nexperienced by mothers may impact reactions to infant\nbehaviors and the quality of the dyadic relationship. For\nsome dyads, this may serve to accentuate the risks asso-\nciated with prenatal drug exposure. However, by the\nsame token, for mothers experiencing less parenting\nrelated stress, the effect may be to ameliorate risk factors\nby altering in a positive fashion the perceptions of infant\nbehavioral characteristics and improving infant\u00adparent\ninteractions. In other words, the degree of parenting\nstress experienced by mothers of drug-exposed infants\nmay operate as both a risk and protective factor. To the\nextent that parenting stress and attitudes can be modi-\nfied, these factors are potentially important targets of\nintervention.\n"
