Key themes relate to musical\ntaste, musical indexicality, musical repetition and musical authenticity. Postings reveal how music\nconveys individual taste and is linked to personal memories and Heidegger's coincidental time\nwhere moments of authenticity may be triggered in a melee of emotions, memories and projec-\ntions. Identity protection is enabled as consumers frequently resist advertisers' attempts to use\nmusical repetition to impose normative identity. Critiques of repetition in the music produce\nHeideggerian anxiety leading to critically reflective resistance. Similarly, where advertising devalues\nthe authenticity of iconic pieces of music, consumers often resist such authenticity transgressions\nas a threat to their own identity. The Heideggerian search for meaning in life emphasizes the\nsignificance of philosophically driven ideological authenticity in consumers' responses to music in\nadvertisements.\n",

It shows how music linked to advertise-\nments can evoke Heideggerian, philosophically driven ideological authenticity as well as material\nauthenticity.\nThere is a general gap in terms of the lack of qualitative research in music and advertising,\ncompounded by a more specific gap regarding netnographic research. This is reflected in the\nliterature review of music in advertising by Oakes (2007) in which the highlighted studies are\nalmost exclusively from a positivist, managerial perspective and the influence of music in\nadvertising upon consumer identity is not addressed. While consumer identity is addressed by\nliterature from different disciplines, the current study provides an original angle in examining it\nwithin the context of music and advertising. In addition, the qualitative approach allows the\nresearchers to analyse the in-depth phenomenological experiences of music highlighted by the\nconsumers. Postings relate to comments about music in advertisements uploaded on YouTube\nfeaturing various goods and services. Such online communities have become an increasingly\nimportant marketing research resource through netnography (Kozinets, 2002a, 2006). These\ncommunities `have a \"real\" existence for their participants' (Kozinets, 1998: 366), help marketing\nresearchers to enhance their knowledge of the needs, motivations and subsequent behaviour of\nconsumers (Oakes et al., 2013) and develop understanding of the ways in which consumers may\nachieve emancipation from the market (Kozinets, 2002b). Consumer postings and subsequent\ndiscursive interaction are also valuable for organizations in terms of monitoring and improving the\neffectiveness of advertising (Kozinets et al., 2010).\nIn the context of the current study, YouTube acts as an interactive forum within which users\ndiscuss music in the advertising videos to which they are exposed (often actively seeking out the\nmusic and advertisement), thus providing an important source of advertising feedback. In the\nprocess, the relationship between music and consumer identity is brought into heightened focus.\nFrom a phenomenological perspective, the current netnographic study seeks to examine con-\nsumers' lived experiences of music and the role of music in helping to construct and manage their\nidentities and achieve authentic lives.\nMusic and consumer identity\nFrith (2003: 46) suggests that `what people listen to is more important for their sense of themselves\nthan what they watch or read'. Music may express differentiation and `function as a \"badge\" which\nconveys information about the person who expresses a particular preference' (North and Har-\ngreaves, 1999: 77) and consumers may hold normative expectations concerning characteristics of\npeople who like different musical genres. Choice of music may become an extension of an indi-\nvidual's identity. Consequently, identity may be regarded as a project that has to be worked on and\ncarefully managed since consumers are continuously in the process of `actively constructing,\nmaintaining and communicating their identity, partly by using the symbolic meaning of brands,\nPreference for specific musical genres and subgenres may express identity through signposting\nmembership of reference groups and excluding others who belong to separate groups, frequently\nenabling segregation of consumers according to a range of demographic variables such as age,\ngender, ethnicity and social class. Musical taste and knowledge have the potential to communicate\ndistinctiveness, status and class (Bourdieu, 2010: 10). Indeed `music can be part of status battles' to\nshow one's superior emotional sensitivity to music (Hesmondhalgh, 2008: 337). In such status\nbattles, identities as discursive constructs enable the operation of power relations (Foucault, 1984).\nIdentity projects are co-created and `realized through social interaction and validation' (Shankar\net al., 2009: 90). `Social constructionist theories suggest that people have many identities, each of\nwhich is created in interaction with other people, rather than having a single, core identity'\n(Hargreaves et al., 2002: 10), indicating that identities are continually evolving. In contrast to the\nsocial constructionists' perspective of multiple and shifting identities, music consumers may\ncommunicate their identities through autobiographical narratives in order to convince others (and\nthemselves) of their unshifting, core identity (Bruner, 1990). The current article finds evidence to\nsuggest both views have relevance in identity construction and may not be mutually exclusive. The\nmultifaceted role of music is therefore an important element in the development and disclosure of\nconsumer identity. Our findings suggest that for some consumers, music in conjunction with an\nadvertisement elicits powerful and deep-rooted emotions and thoughts. We draw on Heidegger's\n(1978) notion of authenticity as an overarching framework to interpret these findings.\nHeideggerian authenticity\nWang (1999) discusses existential authenticity as an alternative to objective and constructive\nauthenticity. Objective authenticity concerns the authenticity of originals, while constructive\nauthenticity is subjective, resulting in numerous, symbolic versions of authenticities involving the\nsame objects. Consumers' interpretations of constructive authenticity are valid, regardless of\nopposing, expert viewpoints from an objective perspective. Reisinger and Steiner (2006) suggest\nthat Heidegger resolves key tensions around (and between) subjectivity and objectivity arising\nfrom philosophical dualism by arguing that humans are automatically, inextricably connected to\nthe world.\nSteiner and Reisinger (2006: 303) discuss how `Heidegger uses the term \"authenticity\" to\nindicate that someone is being themselves existentially' by existing according to one's essence and\nrejecting conformity to superficial or unquestioned and dogmatic views, which Heidegger refers to\nas idle talk. Wang (1999: 352) identifies how `existential authenticity refers to a potential exis-\ntential state of Being', discussing how existential authenticity involves the search for one's\nauthentic self in activities where `people feel they themselves are much more authentic and more\nfreely self-expressed than in everyday life' (pp. 351\u00ad52) and where people `are engaging in non-\nordinary activities', free from daily constraints (p. 352). Unlike objective authenticity, `existential\nexperience involves personal or intersubjective feelings' (p. 351). Responding `to the ambivalence\nof the existential conditions of modernity' (p. 360), existential authenticity may be linked to\nnostalgia through the desire to relive an idealized past and also linked to romanticism `because it\naccents the naturalness, sentiments, and feelings in response to the increasing self-constraints by\nreason and rationality in modernity' (p. 360). It involves being `true to one's self' (Steiner and\nExistential authenticity entails individuals claiming and exercising personal freedom to `define\nthemselves, determine their own identity, discover their own meaning and respond to the world in\ntheir own way, not as others expect' (p. 312).\nFor Heidegger, the search for authenticity (a fundamental category of human existence) is a\ndeep and spiritual search for `genuine individuality or selfhood' that includes the search for who I\nam, my purpose and my relationship to the world and others (Mulhall, 2005: xi). Heidegger\nchampions autonomy and free thought, emphasizing that `to be human is to have possibilities and\nthe capacity to choose among them' (Steiner and Reisinger, 2006: 303). The human is portrayed as\nconstantly projecting forward to future possibilities in a conceptualization of time `where past\n(heritage), present (openness) and future (possibilities) coexist' (p. 305), and moments of exis-\ntential authenticity may come and go. However, although Heideggerian authenticity is personal\nand unique, it is not selfish or hedonistic because the search for a meaningful life may involve care\nand concern for others. The `phenomenon of care' (Heidegger, 1978: 365) is a basic structure of\nhuman existence which is linked to concern for others and moods (Mulhall, 2005) such as\nreflective anxiety that can trigger disclosure of authenticity.\nWe deploy Heidegger's (1978) concepts of idle talk (the superficial discourse of mass culture),\ncoincidental time (the simultaneous experience of past, present and future) and moods (including\nanxiety) to explore common themes of musical taste, musical indexicality, musical repetition and\nmusical authenticity observed in the data. For Heidegger, while the human being is perpetually\nprojecting forwards, searching for meaning and simultaneously reflecting on the past, moods such as\nanxiety and the phenomenon of care and concern for others can trigger a questioning of the everyday\nidle talk in which we are naturally absorbed, revealing existential, emancipatory possibilities.\nLeigh et al. (2006: 481) discuss existential authenticity, indicating how a consumer `authen-\nticates his or her identity through role performance and communal commitment'. We contribute to\nthe consumer identity and authenticity literature by extending Leigh et al.'s (2006) application of\nthe concept of existential authenticity, highlighting the significance of philosophically driven\nideological authenticity in consumers' responses to music and advertisements. In addition, we\nbuild on Kozinets' (2002b: 33) discussion of communal authenticity where communities exhibit\n`caring' and `sharing' activities `counterposed against the alleged inauthenticity of the mainstream\nor mass market'. Kozinets (2002b: 22) argues that with the rise of industrialization and post-\nindustrialization, `the influence of the market has increasingly encroached upon times, spaces,\nand roles previously reserved for communal relations'. Such communal authenticity is a dimension\nof existential authenticity that includes altruism, civic involvement and Wang's (1999: 364)\ninterpersonal authenticity of `intimacy', `friendship' and `sociality'. For Heidegger, our automatic,\nnon-dualistic connection with others should focus on care and concern for them. His emphasis of\n`care' and `concern' as primordial existential structures suggests a non-instrumental human with a\nquasi-religious moral dimension.\nAccording to Guignon (2006: 288), the authentic Heideggerian human recognizes their links\nwith the community and the shared quest for `fairness, honesty, dignity, benevolence, achieve-\nment, and so on'. Kozinets (2002b) shows how art can become involved in the attempt to recreate\ncommunal authenticity. Similarly, the current study observes how music combined with the\nadvertisement arouses Heideggerian care for others, and we show how some consumers attempt to\nreject the logics of the mass market through demonstrating allegiance to musical subcultures. For\nother consumers, music combined with the advertisement arouses material authenticity as desire\nfor particular material possessions that may enhance the search for meaning, for example as\nutilities, symbols of status or for their aesthetic qualities. For Heidegger (1978: 239), if these\nexperiences become linked to wishing and perpetually `hankering after' new possessions, this may\npotentially sublimate the person's ability to achieve awareness of their own possibilities.\nMethod\nWhile most previous studies on responses to music in advertising have used quantitative tech-\nniques, Goulding (2003) emphasized the need for more varied methods of consumer behaviour\ndata collection to obtain a richer, deeper understanding of consumers. Therefore, rather than\nfocusing upon narrowly prescribed advertising issues where the research agenda has been set by\nadvertising agency and client, the current netnographic research enables disclosure of a broader\nscope of music in advertising themes from the consumer perspective.\nFollowing preliminary discussions of television advertisements famous for using music, we\nexamined advertisements for these goods and services posted on YouTube. In order for an\nadvertisement to be included in this research, posted comments needed to be relevant in focusing\nupon music in advertising, and substantial enough to `have a critical mass of communicators'\n(Kozinets, 2015: 168). Consequently, we chose advertisements with a minimum of five relevant\npostings concerning music. After reviewing the selected consumer postings on YouTube, a total of\n472 relevant comments were chosen for analysis. The YouTube comments were posted by con-\nYouTube postings provide a platform for witty repartee, social commentary, self-promotion and\nmany other activities (Kozinets, 2016). Through storytelling and disclosure of personal, cathartic\nexperiences, consumers `not only refine their self-identities but also gain recognition from others'\n(Leigh et al., 2006: 487). While postings may involve exaggeration for humour or shock effect\nrather than talking more earnestly as in a focus group, the anonymity of YouTube may make those\ninvolved feel `less inhibited about expressing their ideas and feelings on the online platforms'\n(Schiele and Venkatesh, 2016: 9). Such frank exposition may `flourish in the anonymous confines\nof online discussion groups' (Oakes et al., 2013: 620), and the openness, anonymity and de-\ncontextualization of an online environment such as YouTube may encourage more reserved\nconsumers to share their thoughts (Cooke, 2008).\nNetnographic research in the current study was purely observational and involved no com-\nmunicative interaction between researchers and online users during the process of identifying\nand analysing comments. According to Langer and Beckman (2005), the observational role of\nthe researchers and lack of interaction with web forum users should be a norm for this type of\nstudy as observational netnography allows researchers to conduct studies without the need to\nacquire consent which might contaminate the findings (Oakes et al., 2013). Viewers' YouTube\nnames and user ID were deleted when using their postings in order to ensure complete\nanonymity.\nCareful re-reading of postings allowed discrete thematic categories to emerge from the data,\nafter which the researchers finalized specific key themes for in-depth analysis. Although the use of\nqualitative data analysis software packages such as NVivo 11 can be helpful in coding and clas-\nsifying a large data set, the current research uses a manual thematic approach in analysing the data\nas software packages `inevitably involve trading off symbolic richness for construct clarity'\nKozinets (2015: 140) suggests that `the collection and analysis of archived messages does not\nofficially constitute human subjects' social research' and it has been argued that comments posted\nin a public setting `should be considered to be in the public domain' (Clegg Smith, 2004: 232). Just\nas a book author's permission is not required prior to citation, there is no reason to believe that\nsubjects consider their `online social interactions are private', especially when no faces or iden-\ntities are revealed and there is no probability of harm to individuals or groups (Kozinets, 2015:\n141). Where no login is required in an online public space, previous netnographic research has\nproposed that `no informed consent is required' for interaction observation provided that\nNetnographic findings\nThis section discusses the four key themes revealed in the findings: musical taste, musical\nindexicality, musical repetition and musical authenticity.\nMusical taste\nMusical subcultures emerge due to dissatisfaction with mainstream musical tastes. Subcultures\nhave been theorized as rebelliously political due to `their ritualistic resistance to capitalist\nincorporation' (Weinzierl and Muggleton, 2006: 8). Subcultural music may evoke correspondingly\nrebellious images and ideals that are markedly different from those evoked by more commercially\nmainstream music. However, `musical taste, as with music itself, is both a multi-faceted and\ndistinctly fluid form of expression' (Bennett, 1999: 611) as distinctions between subcultural and\nmainstream classifications have become blurred. For example, the musical subculture dubstep has\nrecently gained wider recognition through endorsement by mainstream music stars (e.g. Rihanna\nand Taylor Swift), `as well as mainstream advertising by brands such as Apple, Samsung, Hei-\nneken, Skoda and BMW' that tap into subcultural authenticity by using dubstep (Hietanen and\nRokka, 2015: 1565). Nevertheless, individuals still strive to use subcultural capital to define their\ntaste as authentic and to accrue `cool' status that is valuable through its exclusivity. The dis-\ntinctiveness of subcultural capital is defended through construction of a `mainstream \"Other\" as a\nsymbolic marker against which to define one's own tastes as \"authentic\" (Weinzierl and Mug-\nA number of postings suggested that allegiance to a musical genre and associated subculture\ntriggers purchase intent as exemplified below:\nI ended up buying two boxes because of this ad. Dubstep is epic and I ran around the house shouting\n`DUBSTEP ON TV!' (Weetabix, Mord Fustang, `A New World', 2013, hereafter WMF)\nSome consumers claim that they dislike a product, but cannot resist buying it because they like\nthe genre of music used in the advertisement:\nWeetabix tastes like S***, but it's got Dubstep in the commercial. So, you'll buy it anyway. (WMF,\nIf the music is perceived as incongruous because its values are believed to be undermined by the\nadvertisement, it may pose an indirect identity or authenticity threat, resulting in avoidance of the\nadvertisement and product:\nLove this song but it's out of place in this commercial . . . makes me want to buy the Kia Soul less\nbecause I don't want people associating me with these strange commercials. (Kia Soul, Lady Gaga,\nSeveral consumers present themselves as arbiters of good taste and authenticity, typified by the\ncomment below:\nWorst ad ever \u00fe worst browser ever! Anyone who likes this song clearly has no idea what good music\nis. (Microsoft, Alex Clare, `Too Close', 2012)\nThe concepts of authenticity and taste can be linked through Heidegger's notion of superficial\n`idle talk'. Some consumers claim to have achieved a level of authenticity where they have\ntranscended the opinions of inauthentic mass culture. In Heidegger's (1978: 220) terms, they\nbelieve they have avoided idle talk and do not automatically follow mainstream tastes and fash-\nions, without prior reflection or critique:\nI applaud the courage to create commercials that are artistic and different. At least one company\ndoesn't bend to the average bourgeois taste of the masses. (United Airlines, George Gershwin,\nYouTube consumers demonstrate conspicuous musical consumption by communicating their\npersonal musical tastes to other readers. Some consumers attempt to validate their `good' taste in\nmusic by quantifying the number of people with similar taste, using their perceived shared experi-\nences to reinforce their own authenticity:\nCame on here to find the song off this advert and it's in the top viewed. 31,000 other people with good\ntaste in music . . . nice guys (John Lewis, Fyfe Dangerfield, `She's Always a Woman', 2010)\nThe style of music used in advertisements frequently appeals to consumer segments that are\nhappy to demonstrate their musical knowledge and taste. The posting below implies that the\nconsumer is well grounded through musical knowledge which helps to create a stable sense of\nidentity. The consumer creates the impression of having achieved a more authentic state through\nthe wisdom of seeing beyond tribal paradigms:\nI could write an essay on how this video is ideal for breaking down paradigms of OLDSKOOL vs new\nage/establishment vs niche, etc. (Kia, Ivan Gough/Feenixpawl, `In My Mind', 2012)\nIn the following comment, the consumer's superior taste in music and enhanced appreciation of\nmusical authenticity is justified by categorizing music used in an advertisement as art. In addition,\nfrom a Heideggerian perspective, it can be viewed as an example of a demonstration of achieving a\nmore meaningful life through a critique of commodification:\nWhat the Beatles made was art, not just a product, like today's pop stars. (Nike, The Beatles, `Rev-\nArsel and Thompson (2011: 795) discuss how, through media representation, hipsters are denuded\n`of any connotations of social protest'. Similarly, the current study reveals the link between\nmusical taste and the search for an authentic identity as consumers seek to prevent the erosion\nof their countercultural identities through criticizing the Nike relationship with John Lennon's\nidealistic social protest song Revolution. This demonstrates resistance to the way `cultural symbols\nare co-opted by the mainstream' in order to present corporatized versions of counterculture,\nthereby diminishing its rebellious connotations through the commodification process (Schiele and\nVenkatesh, 2016: 4). Thus, when advertisers attempt to `appropriate the rebellious allure' of\ncountercultural groups in a mainstream context, such inauthenticity may devalue countercultural\nmeaning and threaten identity (p. 8).\nThe consumer posting below exemplifies a number of consumer postings about an Air France\nadvertisement that reveal how incorporating a congruous, sophisticated piece of classical music\n(Mozart's Concerto No. 23) creates associations between the advertised service and characteristics\nsuch as elegance and class. Shankar et al. (2009: 89) discuss how our relative social position is\nreinforced by `narratives of socialization' (the stories and expectations through which we are\nsocialized). In this context, perception of leading an authentically meaningful life through mem-\nbership of an aspirational social class is demonstrated through overseas air travel usage and a\nrefined understanding of the music of a great classical composer. The consumers are displaying their\nculturalcapitalinimplyingthesophisticationandsuperiorityoftheirownmusicaltasteandjudgement.\nKlasse! The piece of course in and of itself is Mozart's genius! But even if a premier airline uses it to\ndepict the grandeur and elegance of what it has to offer . . . I think it's well served. (Air France, Mozart,\nThis is possibly the MOST beautiful commercial in years \u00ad Mozart and Air France . . . Exquisite!!!\nMeanwhile, some consumers become involved in online disputes if they consider that their good\ntaste, identity and search for an authentically meaningful life are threatened because an advertise-\nment containing liked music is criticized online. An extract from such a dispute is included below:\nSomeday you'll hear Mozart's Concerto No. 23 and without realizing why, you'll be reminded of Air\nFrance. I pity your lack of imagination. (AFM, 2012)\nMusical indexicality\nPrevious research indicates that music has a memory-triggering element capable of stimulating\nnostalgia for past events (Holbrook and Schindler, 2003; Kerrigan et al., 2014). MacInnis and Park\n(1991: 162) define musical indexicality `as the extent to which music arouses emotion-laden\nmemories', discussing how musical indexicality in advertisements may make associations with\nconsumers' past emotional experiences. If a piece of music is associated with a meaningful earlier\nepisode in a consumer's life, upon hearing the music again, memories and emotions tied to the\noriginal episode may be evoked (Dowling and Harwood, 1986). In this context, musical meaning is\ncontext-specific and referential (Sawyer, 2005). Music may retrieve favourable or unfavourable\nemotions from memory, thus influencing `consumers' feelings and ad attitudes' (MacInnis and\nAlthough consumers' identities may change over time, music with autobiographical resonance\nmay enable the temporary retrieval of one of their former identities, for example, through delib-\nerately revisiting an old, beloved record collection acting as a symbolic representation of past\nselves (Shankar et al., 2009). The comment below emphasizes the power of music combined with\nthe advertisement to retrieve childhood experience, enhancing the memorability of the adver-\ntisement in the process:\nI still remember seeing this commercial when I was just a kid and being completely enthralled by the\nwhole thing. The melody of this song has been playing in the back of my mind all these years. (VW,\nNick Drake, `Pink Moon', 2011, hereafter VWND)\nThe posting below provides an example of indexicality in showing how music combined with\nthe advertisement can be used for retrieving memories and reconstructing previous identities,\nenabling the past to come alive:\nThis song and commercial bring back such a flood of memories from my youth: driving on a hot\nsummer night with full moon and myriad of stars with good friends. (VWND, 2011)\nConversely, exciting experiences can also trigger memories of the advertising music:\nI'm so glad I saw this commercial when it first came out. Now, when I go kayaking, I remember the\nfirst scene and this song comes to mind. (Nissan, Lenny Kravitz, `Fly Away', 2012)\nSome postings suggest evidence of Heidegger's (1978) coincidental time, where past, present\nand future coexist and are linked to the search for authenticity. Thus, for Heidegger, the human\nbeing is constantly projecting forward, and such projections have the potential for a more authentic\nlife. Future projections are always linked to the past and rendered intelligible by past meanings\nThe comment below about an advertisement for the Vodafone mobile network clearly\ndemonstrates how a liked, nostalgia-inducing song combined with the advertisement can bring\nback good memories and conjure up a rejuvenated, more authentic future identity, which in turn\ncan lead to creating a positive attitude towards the advertisement and the brand:\nMore than an advert. It brings me back my young years full of outstanding memories. Hope to bring\nthem back again . . . (Vodafone, The Dandy Warhols, `Bohemian Like You', 2008)\nThe following posting demonstrates how Nick Drake's memorable Pink Moon recording com-\nbined with the advertisement enables personalized reconstruction of a previous identity, arousing\nmemories of carefree happiness and making the consumer think about future purchasing of the\nproduct, thus evoking Heidegger's (1978) concept of coincidental time:\nIt reminds me of driving with the top down, in a good mood, driving down the Pacific coast. Every time\nI see this commercial or hear this song, a happy memory comes to mind. I guess it's time to buy a\nconvertible to feel that again. (VWND, 2010)\nThe posting below illustrates how music and advertisement are fused together to create coin-\ncidental time where past, present and future merge involving social values. It also suggests\nKozinets' (2002b) notion of communal authenticity and Heideggerian authenticity through care\nand concern for others:\nI totally loved this commercial when I was a kid. I thought I would grow up and the world would be a\nhappy peaceful place. (Coca-Cola, The Hillside Singers, `I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing', 2013)\nMusical repetition\nDespite consumers' best efforts to prevent it, music may infiltrate the mind, repeat itself con-\ntinuously and become extremely difficult to dislodge. This widely experienced involuntary cog-\nnition is comparable to a cognitive itch in need of scratching and has been referred to as\n`brainworms' or `sticky music' (Sacks, 2011). From a Heideggerian perspective, our engagement\nwith repetitive music can be similar to our relationship with `ready-to-hand' tools in the external\nworld, where we become absorbed in their use and they help us to feel `at-home' (Heidegger, 1978:\n233). Thus, the use of extremely addictive and repetitive types of music in advertisements may\nhave positive effects on consumers' responses. The comment below indicates how continual\nrepetition of songs in people's minds may positively influence attitudes to the advertisement:\nI love this advert, you can't get it out of your head once you've heard it. I keep on randomly singing it!\nHowever, there were also many examples of negative responses to musical repetition arousing\nstrong emotions:\nLooks like I'm not the only one seeing this commercial EVERY TWO SECONDS. This song can get\nREALLY annoying sometimes. (Honda, Vampire Weekend, `Holiday', 2011, hereafter HVW)\nI hate this stupid jingle. It must have played 100 times yesterday alone. I felt like shooting the TV just\nbecause of the abuse. I would never buy a Honda. (HVW)\nIn the comment below, involuntary and repetitive exposure to a piece of music leads to dis-\npleasure and evocation of the brainworm image:\nThat tune is becoming like a worm eating its way through my brain. Make it stop! (HVW, 2011)\nSacks (2011: 100) describes how repeated sounds can reach the point of annoyance:\nThis endless repetition and the fact that the music in question may be irrelevant or trivial, not to one's\ntaste, or even hateful, suggest a coercive process, that the music has entered and subverted a part of the\nbrain, forcing it to fire repetitively and autonomously.\nIn Heideggerian terms, negative moods such as those associated with musical repetition can\ntrigger resistance to the homogenizing routines of the market, highlighting a critique of market\nmanipulation, and the desire and potential for a more authentic existence. Through negative moods\nsuch as anxiety, the human may become detached from its taken for granted, unreflective absorp-\ntion in the mass market. The human may become alienated or `not-at-home' (Heidegger, 1978:\n233) and may search for emancipatory possibilities. Such striving may enable consumers `to assert\ntheir identities in resistance to dominant meanings and power structures' (Rumbo, 2002: 135)\nincluding the dominant cultural hegemony epitomized by relentless musical repetition in adver-\ntising. Repetition may provide security through its predictability, but can also elicit resistance by\nmaking people want to find other, more meaningfully authentic experiences.\nMusical authenticity\nKlein (2013: 9) argues that the use of popular music in advertising has engaged with the arguments\nrelating to the `status of popular music as art, the status of art as commodity, and the existing\ntensions between artistic and commercial use of popular music'. Such musical authenticity debates\nreflect the tension `between cultural forms aspiring to creative integrity and those seeking com-\nmercial success' (Holbrook, 2005: 22). As the differences in opinion around the commercialized\nuse of music suggest, the concept of authenticity in consumption is considered to be a contested\nphenomenon. Adorno and Horkheimer (1997) argue that a work of art should be created for more\nnoble purposes than mere commercialization and profit. They consider the popular music concept\nas commercial and inauthentic. Although the use of popular music in advertising gives companies\nthe opportunity to communicate a favourable brand image and build a link between the music and\nthe advertised brand, there has been growing concern from music fans and musicians about such\ncommercialization. In this context, Corciolani (2014) reveals how bands' participation in adver-\ntising campaigns has been considered a breach of authenticity that may severely damage their\nreputation and their relationship with their fans. Many critics prefer their music to remain genuine\nby refusing to allow it to be used in advertisements, arguing against its commoditization and\ndetachment from its social and cultural origins. Some postings object to the use of revered songs in\nadvertisements. They consider musical authenticity to be compromised in the process because\nmusicians like Brandi Carlile wrote and recorded their songs as artists, not simply to advertise any\nproduct. Such postings do not associate the market and its logic of efficiency and economic\nrationality with aesthetic beauty.\nIt's a shame how they used Brandi's song for a car commercial, it's such a beautiful song. (GM, Brandi\nCarlile, `I was made for You', 2009, hereafter GMBC)\nIn the following car advertisement example, the posting suggests that consumers may passio-\nnately oppose liked music being used in advertisements:\nOh not again! So many adverts using Edward Sharpe songs. Stop spoiling good music! (Peugeot,\nPopular music has frequently been regarded as a context for individuals' resistance to meanings\nthat are being imposed on them from the dominant hegemony, resistance to the market and an\nimportant means for satisfying consumer needs and expressing identity (Shankar et al., 2009).\nInappropriate use of music in advertising underlines `concerns that culture is degraded by market-\ners as a means of social control' (Bradshaw and Holbrook, 2008: 25), thus undermining the\naesthetic qualities of music. In this context, use of The Beatles' song Revolution in a Nike\nadvertisement was considered controversial. Some of the YouTube comments regarding Nike's\nuse of the song suggest that it degrades the Heideggerian authenticity and value of the music as\nsuch songs carry meaningful, deeply felt social and political messages and are not created to sell\ngoods:\nSongs like Revolution don't mean a pair of sneakers, they mean Revolution. (NTB, 2009)\nMany consumers fear that advertising dilutes the aesthetic credentials of the music it uses.\nWhen the authenticity of favourite bands is indirectly questioned by association with the adver-\ntising of mundane products, the consumer's own present or former identity is also threatened\nthrough concern about `the character he was trying to be \u00ad the ineffective reproduction of a desired\nNow there's a big disconnect. You'd better change yourself instead. John didn't mean change the brand\nExploitation of John Lennon's lyrics to sell shoes makes existing Nike users angry enough to\nboycott the brand because of the degrading of one of their favourite songs:\nThis is disgusting. Shame on Nike for exploiting priceless art. I will never buy another Nike shoe again.\nConsistent with the previous example, the following example demonstrates how consumers\ndefend their musical identity from disruptions and assaults. In turn, their musical identity also\ndefends them `from other people and also from own fears and insecurities' by proclaiming their\nI love Ingrid Michaelson. Have loved her long before this commercial came out. I hate Old Navy\nthough for putting a cheesy commercial with her song. (Old Navy, Ingrid Michaelson, `The Way I Am',\nSometimes advertisements may be the medium through which people become familiar with a\nparticular musician or band. If consumers subsequently become fans, then the bands that they\nadopt reflect an identity choice, symbolizing social groups they wish to identify with and rejecting\nthose to which they do not wish to belong (Bourdieu, 2010). Indeed, many people became Nick\nDrake fans because of the use of Pink Moon in Volkswagen advertisements:\nThere are many other people with similar experiences who discovered Nick Drake thanks to VW.\nPostings revealed how music associated with a particular country evoked strong feelings of\nnational identity linked to perceived achievement of a Heideggerian, authentically meaningful life\nand the evocation of powerful moods:\nI don't know why this commercial literally brought tears to my eyes. It made me so emotional that I\nbegan crying uncontrollably. It is the power of music combined with the beautiful cinematography and\nevocative imagery, I suppose. Like most of you, I love America and I love American culture. Our\nautomotive heritage is part of our culture and we must treasure it. (GMBC, 2009)\nIn some cases, music associated with national identity increased likelihood of purchase intent\ndue to country of origin effects:\nThis actually makes me wanna buy an american car! Go USA! (GMBC, 2012)\nOccasional postings conveyed a sense of irony regarding advertising music and the influence of\nmulticulturalism upon a changing sense of national identity:\nA song from an American musical based on a Spanish book sung for a Japanese company's com-\nmercial. Do you feel it? Do you feel the multiculturalism? (Honda, Andy Williams, `The Impossible\nParticular songs evoked some of the big questions in life relating to the Heideggerian search for\nmeaning and how to live an authentic life. For one consumer, the song translated to a life given\nmeaning through material possessions:\nThey so got this so very right, a very holly-wood feel but in the right way! . . . It makes so much sense, a\ngreat song done by one of the best . . . rest in peace Andy. I want that house with the hot tub. (HAW,\nFor one consumer, Nick Drake's song combined with the advertisement conveyed musical\nauthenticity and suggested a projection towards the big issues of individual freedom, but also\ndemonstrated awareness of market manipulation, showing `how consumers willingly become\ncomplicit in their own seduction by marketplace narratives' (Arnould and Thompson, 2005: 875):\nNick Drake's music FINALLY got the wide recognition it so richly deserved. Watch the commercial\nagain, note the artistry, and best of all the message of individual freedom. I'm not one easily marketed\nto, but I do love this commercial. (VWND, 2010)\nFor another consumer, the same song directly raised the question of an authentic life where\nan awareness of the importance of the journey in life is heightened by recognition of human\nmortality:\nThis is a great ad. It is rare that you will get a commercial that is not just a commercial but that actually\nsays something important. This is what I think that something is; the journey is more important than the\ndestination. Thus, the irony of the inevitability of death. (VWND, 2009)\nFor some, Nick Drake's song was associated with positive, life-affirming feelings. For example,\nin Heideggerian terms, the song combined with the advertisement aroused romantic memories of a\nmeaningful life through caring for another:\nRarely do I get sentimental with commercials, but this one takes me back to the time when I was dating\nmy wife and when we were first married. We used to take drives like this in the mountains and I\nremember looking at her beautiful face in the moonlight. The music is perfect. The sentiment is perfect.\nIndeed, some music and advertisements were alleged to have triggered a more meaningfully\nauthentic life in very concrete terms:\nThis may sound flip, but this ad, the Nick Drake track, inspired me to leave my cr! p job in Montreal and\nmove back west to live in the mountains again. (VWND, 2010)\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe current research builds upon and extends the findings of previous reviews of the music in\nadvertising literature (e.g. Oakes, 2007) by revealing contrasting perspectives. On one level, it\nshows how music influences attitudes to the advertisement and brand, as well as potential purchase\nintent, but on another level, it reveals consumers' critical awareness and frequent resistance to the\nuse of music in advertising. The findings suggest that consumers demonstrate allegiance to musical\nsubcultures through expressions of musical taste and they sometimes demonstrate resistance to\nperceived commodification of those beloved musical subcultures. From the advertisers' per-\nspective, observed consumer devotion to minority musical genres suggests the potential benefits of\npositioning brands to appeal to niche subcultures displaying passionate musical allegiance (e.g.\nfans of electronic dance music genre dubstep). The current study suggests that `listeners are not\npassive consumers, but active partners in a cultural process who use music to fulfil different\nfunctions according to different social contexts' (Hargreaves et al., 2002: 13). Our findings suggest\nthat the Heideggerian concept of authenticity is an overarching framework that binds together\nanalysis of musical taste, musical indexicality, musical repetition and musical authenticity. For\nexample, in some cases, consumers indicate they have achieved a more authentically meaningful\nlife and higher social status by claiming to be able to distinguish between good and bad taste in\nmusic and advertisements. In Heidegger's terms, they suggest they have enhanced their authen-\nticity by being able to identify idle talk.\nFindings regarding indexicality reveal how emotional responses to advertising music may be\ndue to the triggering of autobiographical memories, thus making such responses unpredictable and\ndifficult to control for advertisers due to the individualized nature of the memories. Data in the\ncurrent study associates indexicality with personalized reconstruction of previous identities,\ndemonstrating how music may serve as an aide-memoire that allows consumers to relive\nexperiences from their past and reflect upon them (Nowak, 2016). Functioning as an aesthetic\nmarker, music may illuminate a narrative that enables recall of significant passages in life that\nsometimes reinforce the maintenance of identity over time, and at other times suggest that identity\ninvolves `continuous discourse in an ever changing and evolving communication of oneself to\nothers' (Parsons, 2010: 284). For example, the data demonstrates the gradual evolution of a shifting\nsense of national identity within the context of increased multiculturalism. In contrast, the data also\nshows how the recall of critical incidents in consumers' lives helps to maintain a unified sense of\nindividual identity over time through memory evocation (e.g. when the music brings a consumer\nback to their young years). Furthermore, findings suggest that music and advertisements can be\nlinked to Heideggerian time, where past, present and future are experienced simultaneously.\nMoments of authenticity may be triggered in the melee of emotions, memories and projections.\nGrayson and Martinec (2004: 298) suggest that `evaluating whether one's self is authentic is\nqualitatively different from evaluating whether something else is authentic'. However, within the\ncontext of responses to music in advertising, the current article argues that such evaluations are\ninevitably interconnected in the construction of an authentic identity. When a piece of music\nassociated with a consumer's sense of self-identity becomes less authentic through commodifi-\ncation, the consumer may feel that their own identity is threatened. Indeed, findings indicate\nconsumer resistance to advertising that attempts to control consumer behaviour, including\nattempting to impose `normative social identity' (Rumbo, 2002: 130) through musical repetition.\nAnxiety is a key emotion for Heidegger that the current data suggests can trigger critically\nreflective resistance as the human being becomes aware of its freedom to choose certain paths.\nIn addition, there is resistance to advertising that is perceived to undermine the musical\nauthenticity of favourite bands through excessive commercialization that some consumers allege\ndebases fine art and ruins the experience and memories of many people, highlighting `antagonisms\nbetween music and advertising' (Eckhardt and Bradshaw, 2014: 169). Furthermore, some con-\nsumers are extremely sensitive to the use of music composed and sung by popular musicians to\ntransmit social and political messages, which is then used for the purpose of selling products in\nadvertisements. Thus, the data indicates that music is not simply regarded as an instrumental\ncommodity that may influence intent to purchase advertised products, but is frequently considered\na sacred product in its own right. In such contexts, `consumers build and maintain identity\nboundaries between insiders and outsiders and protect tribal resources from appropriation by\nmarketers' through resistance that helps to sustain their identities (Healy and Beverland, 2016:\n224). In seeking the emancipatory preservation of their own identities, they are resisting the\ntemptation to `adopt identities that are pre-established by the market agents' (Ulusoy, 2016: 251).\nRetention of individual and collective identity through music may assist `consumers in their quest\nfor existential meanings' as well as providing a form of `resistance to and emancipation from\noppression' (p. 252) evident in excessive musical repetition and authenticity threats.\nIn general, the findings suggest that the power of music can often link the advertisement to\ndeep-rooted identity projects and values which can be usefully interpreted through Heidegger's\nconcept of authenticity. Thus, from a Heideggerian perspective, our findings reveal that the music\nand the advertisement (whether perceived as congruous or incongruous) are often connected to the\nfundamental human search for meaning in life, contributing to understanding one's place in the\nworld and one's relationship to others, in a variety of ways, often mediated or triggered by moods.\nFor some consumers in our study, this takes the form of material authenticity (seeking authenticity\nthrough material possessions), illustrating Heidegger's notion of `wishing' (absorption in the\nmarket with an uncritical stance). For other consumers, music (linked to advertised brands) has the\npower to evoke questions in life relating to individual freedom and a more critical stance towards\nthe market.\nIn some cases, music is implicated in Heidegger's care and concern for others (e.g. ethical\nconcerns with poverty, justice, equality and peace) which he regards as fundamental to achieving\nauthenticity. For example, our findings reveal Heidegger's care for others where the world is\nenvisioned by one consumer as `a happy peaceful place' on hearing the song `I'd like to teach the\nworld to sing'. In addition, findings in the current study also reveal Heidegger's care for others in\nthe expression of romantic memories of lifelong, personal relationships. These examples extend\nKozinets' (2002b) notion of communal authenticity, and the Heideggerian perspective shows how\nthey link to care as a fundamental structure of human existence. Furthermore, the Heideggerian\nperspective (including concepts such as idle talk, coincidental time and moods) emphasizes the\nsignificance of philosophically driven ideological authenticity in consumers' responses to music\nand advertisements. Thus, by exploring what it means to exist from a philosophical perspective, we\nextend Leigh et al.'s (2006) application of the concept of existential authenticity which focuses on\nrole performance and communal commitment.\nThe research contributes to marketing theory by interpreting consumers' responses to music and\nadvertisements through Heidegger's (1978) authenticity concept as a perpetual search for (or\nprojection towards) meaning where the past, the present and the future reciprocally question and\nilluminate one another (Mulhall, 2005), and the human being can potentially become aware of\nindividual freedom to choose certain paths, triggered by moods such as anxiety and the phe-\nnomenon of care and concern. From this perspective, the Heideggerian concept of authenticity\nindicates that music and advertising may become implicated in long-term projects for consumer\nemancipation rather than emancipation only being conceived `as temporary and local' as was\nsuggested by Kozinets (2002b: 36). Future netnographic research building upon the findings from\nthe current study could consider consumers' experience of the interplay between music, visual\nimages and words in specific advertisements in order to `analyze rhetorical and imagistic qualities\nthat contribute to advertising resonance' (Arnould and Thompson, 2005: 875) and `interpret music\nas part of an overall rhetorical intention' (Scott, 1990: 223), thus enriching the analysis of themes\nthat emerge.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAdorno, T.W. and Horkheimer, M.
