Demographic, clinical,\nradiological and histopathological features\nof the patients were recorded. The exclusion\ncriteria were as follows: (i) patients who did\nnot accept skin-sparing mastectomy;\n(ii) patients who did not agree to participate\nin the study; (iii) patients who definitely had\nskin involvement or those who were\nsuspected of having skin involvement after\nNAC; (iv) patients who had preNAC satel-\nlite skin lesions.\nEthics committee approval for this study\nwas obtained from the local Ethics\nCommittee of the Faculty of Medicine,\nBezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul,\nPatients who agreed to participate in the\nstudy provided written informed consent. All\nstudy procedures were carried out in accord-\nance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nPretreatment evaluation\nPatients with LABC who had stage IIB\u00adIIIC\ndisease underwent a full physical\nexamination and radiological investigations\n(mammography, ultrasonography, MRI). A\npathological diagnosis was made using a\nroutine core biopsy. PET/computed tomo-\ngraphy (PET/CT) was undertaken to inves-\ntigate the presence of systemic metastases.\nAll fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT\nexaminations were performed using a PET/\nCT scanner combined with 16-multi-detec-\ntor computed tomography (Biograph 16\nPET/CT system; Siemens Medical\nSolutions, Knoxville, USA). Patients were\ninstructed to fast for 5h before the scan, and\nblood glucose was measured immediately\nbefore an intraven-ous injection of 4.0 MBq/\nkg body weight FDG. No patients showed a\nblood glucose level >160 mg/dl. Static\nemission images were obtained approxi-\nmately 60 min after the FDG injection. For\nattenuation correc-tion and anatomical\nlocalization, helical CT scans from the top\nof the head to the bottom of the feet were\nobtained. Immediately after completion of\nthe CT, PET images of the region from the\nhead to the mid-thigh were acquired for\n3 min per bed position. Attenuation-cor-\nrected PET images were reconstructed with\nan ordered-subset expectation maximization\niterative reconstruction algorithm (18 sub-\nsets, 2 iterations).22 SUVmax values were\ncalculated as described previously.23 In\npatients with suspected clinical or radiolo-\ngical skin involvement, an additional skin\nbiopsy was performed and the presence of\ntumour was recorded. Two dimensional\nregions of interest were placed in areas of\ntracer uptake and measures of 18F-fluoro-\ndeoxyglucose accumulation were recorded,\nincluding SUVmax, SUVmean. A back-\nground SUVmax was also measured for\neach examination.24 A SUVmax cut-off\nvalue for skin involvement of 5 has been\npreviously suggested.25 However, this cut-\noff value has not been proven to be applic-\nable to all patients. When an elevated FDG\nuptake was demonstrated on the PET scan,\nthis suggested skin involvement, so it was\nbetter to compare scans before and after\nSystemic treatment and response\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy was adminis-\ntered using regimens containing taxane and\nanthracycline every 3 weeks as described as\nfollows. Six cycles of the TAC regimen\n500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide; all adminis-\ntered intravenously every 3 weeks) or four\ncycles of the AC regimen (60 mg/m2 doxo-\nrubicin; 600 mg m2 cyclophosphamide; all\nadministered intravenously every 3 weeks)\nand four courses of docetaxel (100 mg/m2\nadministered intravenously every 3 weeks)\nwere applied. Trastuzumab was added to the\nregimens for the treatment of patients with\ntumours that were positive for human epi-\ndermal growth factor receptor 2 receptor\n(HER2). Patients received 6 mg/kg trastuzu-\nmab intravenously every 3 weeks concomi-\ntantly with all chemotherapy cycles, starting\nwith a loading dose of 8 mg/kg trastuzumab\nintravenously on day 1 of the first AC\nregimen. If chemotherapy was discontinued\nearly, the missed trastuzumab cycles were\ngiven postoperatively. Total pre- and post-\noperative duration of trastuzumab treat-\nment was 1 year.\nPathological complete response to\nchemotherapy (pCR) was defined as com-\nplete resolution of the tumour both in the\nbreast and axilla. Partial response (pPR) was\ndefined as ! 30% shrinkage of the largest\ndiameter of the tumour. Minimal regression\nor stabilization of the tumour was defined as\nunresponsiveness to chemotherapy. Routine\nradiotherapy and hormone therapy in hor-\nmone receptor-positive patients were\napplied following surgery.\nReceptor immunohistochemistry\nRoutine immunohistochemistry was per-\nformed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded\nbreast cancer tissues. Oestrogen receptor\n(ER) (Clone SP1; Thermo Fisher Scientific\nInc., Rockford, IL, USA) and progesterone\nreceptor (PR) (Clone SP2; Thermo Fisher\nScientific Inc.) status was considered as posi-\ntive if> 10% of tumour cells showed staining.\nAn immunohistochemical score of 3 \u00fe or\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)\nCocktail Assay; Ventana Medical Systems,\nTuscon, Arizona, USA) for HER2 was\naccepted as HER2 positivity.\nA mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1\n(MIB-1) clone (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)\nwas used for the immunohistochemical ana-\nlysis of Ki-67. Immunohistochemical staining\nwas quantitatively evaluated by light micros-\ncopy, in which the entire tissue section was\nscanned at low-power magnification (\u00c210) to\ndetermine areas with the highest number of\npositive nuclei (hot-spots) within the invasive\ncomponent. Ki-67 was expressed as the per-\ncentage of cells positive for MIB-1 among a\ntotal of at least 1000 malignant cells at high-\npower magnification (\u00c240). Nuclear staining\nof the tumour cells was considered negative\nif 14% were stained for Ki-67 and as posi-\nThe final pathological response was\nassessed using the Miller\u00adPayne grading\nsystem, in which pathological response is\ndivided into five grades based on a\ncomparison of tumour cellularity between\nthe preNAC core biopsy and a definitive\nsurgical specimen. The Miller\u00adPayne grad-\ning system is as follows: grade 1: no change\nor some minor alteration in individual\nmalignant cells, but no reduction in overall\ncellularity; grade 2: a minor loss of tumour\ncells, but overall cellularity remains high\nwith up to 30% reduction of cellularity;\ngrade 3: between an estimated 30% and\n90% reduction in tumour cellularity; grade\n4: a marked disappearance of > 90% of\ntumour cells such that only small clusters\nor widely dispersed individual cells remain\n(almost pCR); and grade 5: no invasive\nmalignant cells identifiable in sections from\nthe site of the tumour (pCR).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Descriptive statistical methods\n(mean, number, percentage, median) were\nused to evaluate the data. For survival\nanalyses, the time between the first patho-\nlogical diagnosis of the tumour and the\nlocal/regional first recurrence of the disease\nwas calculated as local recurrence-free sur-\nvival and time to local/regional recurrence\nof the disease or distant organ metastasis\nwas calculated as disease-free survival.\nFollow-up time was defined as the time\nbetween first pathological diagnosis date\nand the last appointment date for the\npatient. Survival calculations were under-\ntaken using the Kaplan\u00adMeier method. The\nlog-rank univariate analysis test was used to\ninvestigate tumour and patient characteris-\ntics; and the effects of skin involvement on\nlocal and systemic recurrence. The effects of\nmultiple factors on skin involvement were\ninvestigated by Cox regression test in\nmultivariate analyses and the proportional\ndifferences between the groups were calcu-\nlated using 2-test (Continuity Correction,\nFisher's Exact Test). The relationship\nbetween skin involvement in PET and\nMRI findings with histopathological skin\ninvolvement was assessed using McNemar's\ntest. A P-value 0.05 was considered statis-\ntically significant.\nResults\nA total of 30 patients with LABC were\nenrolled in the study (mean age, 52.6 years;\nrange, 35\u00ad70 years). The detailed character-\nistics of the tumours are presented in\nTable 1.

PostNAC\nPET and histopathological skin involvement\nwere significantly different (P \u00bc 0.001).\nPreNAC MRI and histopathological skin\ninvolvement were also significantly different\n(P \u00bc 0.001), but there was no significant\ndifference between postNAC MRI and\nhistopathological skin involvement. These\nresults suggest that preNAC PET and\npostNAC MRI more accurately identified\nskin involvement than postNAC PET and\npreNAC MRI.

There was no sig-\nnificant relationship between postNAC\nMRI and PET or histopathological skin\ninvolvement and local or systemic recur-\nrence (data not shown). There was no\nsignificant relationship between local and\nsystemic recurrence and the type of surgery\nundertaken (data not shown). There was no\nsignificant relationship between the presence\nof ER, PR, HER2 receptors or Ki-67 pro-\ntein and histopathological skin involvement\n(data not shown). As the Ki-67 values of\npatients are different and as it is not related\nto skin involvement, the Ki-67 data are not\npresented in Table 1.\nDiscussion\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is accepted as\nthe standard treatment approach in LABC.8\nEvaluation of the response to NAC in\nLABC is traditionally performed by ultra-\nsonography or mammography. However,\nwith these methods, it is not always possible\nto distinguish residual tumour from fibrosis.\nAt present, 18F-FDG PET/CT and MRI are\nfrequently used in clinical practice. Several\nstudies suggest the combined use of MRI\nand PET for the prediction of histopatho-\nlogical complete response after NAC.24\u00ad29\nDetermination of the presence and extent\nof residual tumour after NAC is also\nimportant in planning the surgical approach\nto be performed. Effective use of preopera-\ntive imaging methods allows appropriate\nsurgery to be planned and successfully\napplied to the patient.30 However, consider-\nation should be given to which imaging\nmethod is more accurate at this stage.31,32 A\nprevious study that compared the efficacy of\nMRI to determine the histopathological\nresponse to NAC concluded that its sensi-\nthis present study, these values were 100%/\nfor MRI after NAC, respectively.

MRI can produce a false\n`complete response' result when, despite\ntumour cell destruction by the chemother-\napy, a residual tumour cell population\nremains. According to these results, consid-\nering the high sensitivity specivity and\npositive predictive value of PET before\nNAC and of MRI after NAC, it may be\nappropriate to use the two modalities\ntogether for effective and appropriate pre-\noperative planning.\nSkin-sparing mastectomy has become\nwidely used in recent years, especially in\npatients undergoing prophylactic mastec-\ntomy or those with early-stage breast\ncancer. It was first described by Freeman\nas possible is spared while the nipple areola\ncomplex is resected with breast tissue.\nSparing the natural skin covering also\nincreases the aesthetic success of the recon-\nstruction methods. However, there are still\nconcerns about its success for oncological\noutcomes and its negative effects on local\nand systemic recurrence when compared\nstudies have shown that breast-conserving\nmastectomy and classical mastectomy have\nsimilar local and systemic recurrence\nrates.16,39 Despite the controversial applica-\ntion of skin-sparing mastectomy, especially\nin advanced breast cancer, successful results\nof recent applications in this group of\npatients have been reported.39 A previous\nstudy that compared skin-sparing mastec-\ntomy and classical mastectomy demon-\nstrated no significant difference in the\nlocal, regional, and systemic recurrence\nrates between these two techniques despite\nthe fact that the local recurrence rate\nincreases with increased stage.40 Similarly,\nanother study that evaluated skin-sparing\nmastectomy in LABC found that irrespect-\nive of the histopathological complete\nresponse rate, skin-sparing mastectomy\nwas not associated with high local recur-\nrence.41 In NAC-treated patients undergo-\ning breast-conserving surgery and classical\nmastectomy, both surgeries showed similar\nresults for local recurrence.11,12 Prospective\nstudies that investigate the effect of different\nsurgical techniques over longer follow-up\nperiods may lead to more accurate findings.\nPredicting histopathological complete\nresponse, demonstrating axillary nodal\ninvolvement, and measuring biological mar-\nkers have been widely applied in studies that\nhave aimed to determine the effectiveness of\nthe radiological methods used in the evalu-\nation of treatment response after NAC.42\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no\nstudies have specifically investigated the\neffectiveness of various radiological evalu-\nation methods for predicting skin involve-\nment. In this present study, the role of PET\nand MRI for identifying skin involvement\npreNAC and postNAC was investigated in\norder to demonstrate the feasibility of using\nskin-sparing mastectomy. When these mod-\nalities were evaluated separately before and\nafter NAC, it was concluded that preNAC\nPET and postNAC MRI more accurately\nidentified skin involvement.\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, the number of patients was\nsmall. Secondly, the follow-up period was\nrelatively short. Extending the follow-up\nperiod would allow for a more reliable\nevaluation of local and systemic recurrence\nrates to be made.\nIn conclusion, preNAC PET and\npostNAC MRI more accurately determined\nskin involvement, so it might be possible to\nuse these two radiological evaluation meth-\nods together to assess patient suitability\nfor skin-sparing mastectomy in selected\npatients.\n"
