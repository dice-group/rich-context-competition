We examine this relationship empirically by\nlooking at the political regimes that follow coups in autocracies, as well as the level of repression against citizens. We\nfind that, though democracies are occasionally established in the wake of coups, more often new authoritarian regimes\nemerge, along with higher levels of state-sanctioned violence.\nKeyword\ncoups, authoritarian regimes, democratization, regime change, repression\n1University of California at Los Angeles, USA\n2Michigan State University, USA\n3Pennsylvania State University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJoseph Wright.

At least half of all coups \u00ad 56% dur-\nnew authoritarian regimes. For example, even though\nBasic summary statistics indicate that both before the\nCold War and afterward, coups are most often followed\nby new dictatorships.\nStatistical tests that take into account a variety of poten-\ntially confounding factors tell a similar story: the associa-\ntion between coups and democratization is statistically\ninsignificant, while that between coups and the establish-\nment of new dictatorships is robust.\nLooking at failed as well as successful coups fails to\nyield a rosier picture. Though some have argued that coup\nattempts, such as the Burundian military's failed power\ngrab in 2015, can set in motion changes leading to democ-\nratization (Noyes, 2015), our study indicates that this is\nunlikely. Regime change is less likely to follow a coup\nattempt than a successful coup, and when it does, the regime\nthat emerges is more likely to be a new dictatorship than a\ndemocracy.\nWe also examine the association between different types\nof coups and repression. Using an annual latent measure of\nrepression, we find that coups that launch new dictatorships\nare followed by an increase in repression in the calendar\nyear after the coup compared to the year before it. In con-\ntrast, coups that lead to democracy are associated with a\ndecrease in repression, but only for post-Cold War cases.\nWe supplement this with an analysis of event data for 49\ncoup attempts that occurred after 1989, by comparing state-\nsanctioned civilian deaths in the 12 post- and 12 pre-coup\nmonths. We find only one case of a coup followed by a drop\nin deaths and numerous cases of increases in violence after\ndifferent types of coup events.\nThe central message of this study is clear: though coups\nagainst autocrats have sometimes led to democratization,\nmore often they install a new set of autocratic elites and\nexpose citizens to higher levels of repression.\nThe study is organized as follows. It first provides some\nbackground: a definition of coups, and a description of how\npatterns associated with them have changed over time.\nNext, it evaluates the link between coups and regime\nchange empirically. It then investigates the connection\nbetween coups and repression. The final section summa-\nrizes our findings.\nBackground\nCoups are successful efforts `by the military or other elites\nwithin the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive\nusing unconstitutional means' (Powell and Thyne, 2011:\n252). Though civilians may support coups, at their core\ncoups are a technology that can only be used by the mili-\ntary, police, and security forces.\nThe most basic goal of a coup is to bring about a change\nin leadership, but often coup plotters also seek more sub-\nstantial political transformation. They may announce their\nintention to hold democratic elections in the near future and\neven offer a timeline for the transition. However, they do\nnot always fulfill such promises, as in Egypt where the\nmilitary that promised a transition later ousted elected\nPresident Morsi in 2013 and remains in control.\nRecent research, however, suggests that the conse-\nquences of coups may have changed since the end of the\nCold War. Not only have coups declined in frequency, but\nthose that occur are increasingly followed by competitive\nA variety of factors could explain this. For one, conspir-\nators often state that the desire to save their countries from\nautocratic incumbents motivated them. They may opt for\nfree and fair elections simply because they value them.\nEven when junta members are less altruistic, coups may\nlead to democratization because of the incentives created\nby international pressure in the post-Cold War era (Marinov\nand Goemans, 2014). Threats to suspend foreign aid can\nmotivate the military to hold elections quickly.\nIn summary, there are a variety of mechanisms through\nwhich coups might pave the way for democratization\n(Thyne and Powell, 2014), as well as compelling argu-\nments for why they might be more likely to do so since the\nCold War's end (Marinov and Goemans, 2014). Have coups\nbecome good for democracy, though? In the next section,\nwe evaluate this question empirically.\nCoups and regime change\nAn investigation of the consequences of coups should take\ninto account the kind of leadership the coup aimed to\n(49%) suffered from at least one coup, while only a third of\nDerpanopoulos et al. 3\nless frequent but just as likely to occur in democracies as in\ndictatorships (12%). Democracies ended by coups, how-\never, tend to rebound quickly (Marinov and Goemans,\n2014). One reason competitive elections more often follow\ncoups may therefore be that a larger proportion of them\nnow occur in places that tend to redemocratize quickly.\nYet, few would argue that coups against democratic gov-\nernments are `good' for democracy, even in cases like 2009\nHonduras, where the Supreme Court sided with the military\nand the autocratic interlude was short. Democracy, at a\nminimum, guarantees that transitions from one leader to the\nnext occur through a free and fair process. Thus coups in\ndemocracies indicate democratic backsliding at a minimum\nand usually outright democratic breakdown.\nTo avoid treating cases of quick redemocratization after\ncoups against democracies as `good for democracy', we\nlimit our investigation to coups against dictatorships. We\nexamine how coups influence the likelihood of two distinct\ntypes of autocratic regime collapse: democratization and\nadverse regime change (Geddes et al., 2014).5 The latter\nconstitute events during which one group of autocratic\nelites replaces another \u00ad as for example, when coups\nreplaced monarchies with military-led dictatorships in\nEgypt, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. Our main independent vari-\nable is an indicator of whether a coup occurred in the obser-\nvation year or either of the two years prior (Thyne and\nWe estimate a linear model with regime-case fixed\neffects.6 Doing so enables a within-regime comparison of\nwhat follows a coup, while conditioning-out all differences\nbetween autocratic regimes (e.g. level of development,\ncolonial history, how the regime seized power). Crucially,\nthis approach accounts for autocratic regime type, includ-\ning whether the incumbent autocracy is ruled by the mili-\ntary. Accounting for differences among regimes, such as\nwhether a military junta leads the dictatorship, is important,\nbecause military dictatorships often use coups as a method\nfor reshuffling leaders, and they are also more likely to\ndemocratize, though not necessarily because of coups\n(Geddes, 1999). The specification also controls for regime\nduration, leader duration and year fixed effects. To examine\nthe effect of the end of the Cold War, we estimate separate\nsimilar to estimating an interaction between time period\nand coups; the year fixed effects subsume the time period\nconstituent term.\nThe sample covers all autocratic regime-years in 285\ntion as the dependent variable estimates the effect of coups\non the probability of transitioning from autocracy to\ndemocracy, from one calendar year to the next:\nr emocracy utocracy\nt t\n( | )\n-\n. A model with adverse\nregime change as the dependent variable estimates the\neffect of coups on the probability of transitioning from\nautocracy to a new autocracy, from one calendar year to the\nnext: P N A\nr ewAutocracy utocracy\nt t\n( | )\n-\n.\nThe top panel of Figure 1 plots the estimates. The top\ncoefficient in each pair (circle) is from a model with democ-\nratization as the dependent variable, while the bottom coef-\nficient (triangle) is from a model in which adverse regime\nchange is the dependent variable.\nThe figure shows that successful coups during the Cold\nWar are not correlated with democratization; post-Cold\nWar coups are, but the estimate is not statistically signifi-\ncant. A successful coup is, however, associated with an\nincrease in the chance of transition from one autocracy\nto another; a 19% increase during the Cold War and 27%\nafterward. Both estimates are statistically significant. This\nsuggests that coups destabilize dictatorships not by improv-\ning prospects for democratization, but by boosting the odds\nthat a new dictatorship replaces the old one.\nWe next consider whether coup attempts \u00ad regardless of\nwhether the coup effort succeeds or fails \u00ad are associated\nwith higher chances of democratization. It is possible that\nFigure 1. Coups and autocratic regime transitions.\n4 Research and Politics \nwhen coups fail, they set in motion events conducive to\ndemocratization down the road. Thyne and Powell (2014)\nargue, for example, that failed coups increase the likelihood\nof democratization by sending a signal to incumbents that\nmilitary support for the status quo has declined. Incumbents,\nfearing a future successful coup, then opt for political liber-\nalization, which gives them a better position from which to\nnegotiate their exit than would a coup.\nThe data, again from Powell and Thyne (2011), show\nthat about half of all attempted coups fail. The likelihood\nof failure varies with time period: 48% of attempted coups\nfailed during the Cold War and 63% after it. In any case,\nregime change rarely follows failed coups: 6% of failed\ncoups were followed by democratization and 3% by the\nestablishment of a new dictatorship. In summary, coups\nfail frequently, and when they do, regime change rarely\nfollows.\nThe lower panel of Figure 1 is similar to the top panel,\nbut looks at all coup attempts (successful or failed). It\nreveals a similar pattern: coup attempts are correlated with\nan increased probability of adverse regime change, but the\neffect on democratization is not statistically significant.\nThese findings contrast with recent research on the\ndemocratizing effects of coups, notably Thyne and Powell\n(2014). To explore why our results differ, we re-examine\ntheir statistical tests in the Online Appendix. We show that\nthe `democratizing effect' of coups is not robust to includ-\ning either a control for military regime or regime-case fixed\neffects. These are not trivial changes to the specification\nbecause they address the most important omitted variable\n\u00ad namely, military regime leadership \u00ad which is correlated\nwith both coups and democratization. Furthermore, we\nshow that even using their specification, the association\nbetween coups and the probability of democratization is\nquite small in the post-Cold War period (1.2%).\nRegime change is not the only way coups can affect citi-\nzen welfare, however. In the next section, we investigate\nthe relationship between coups and repression.\nCoups and repression\ncoup in Guinea, just a day after the death of longtime dic-\ntator Lansana Cont\u00e9. Camara established the National\nCommittee for Democracy and Development (CNDD) to\ncontrol government (Walker, 2008). Though some citizens\ninitially welcomed the coup as a respite from the repres-\nsiveness of Cont\u00e9's government, their hopes of greater\nfreedom were soon dashed. Reports emerged in the months\nthat followed of arbitrary arrests and detentions, restric-\ntions on citizens' political rights, and criminal activities\norganized by the military (Human Rights Watch, 2009).\nforces killed more than 150 citizens participating in anti-\ngovernment protests, sparking international condemnation\nof the Camara regime and triggering sanctions against it\nThe 2008 coup in Guinea led to the establishment of a\nnew dictatorship. The events that followed it highlight the\npossibility that coups can have damaging consequences for\ncitizens beyond regime change. At the extreme, coups pre-\nunleashed a decade of political violence and repression,\nculminating in foreign intervention. We explore the coup\u00ad\nrepression nexus in this section.\nTo measure repression, we use mean estimates of a\nlatent measure of respect for human rights from Fariss\n(2014). This measure accounts for the changing standards\nof accountability over time, as human rights norms and\nreporting standards have become stricter. We invert it so\nthat larger values indicate higher repression.\nWe disaggregate coups into four categories: failed coups\n(Failed coups), coups that launch new autocracies (Adverse\nchange), democratization coups (Democratizing) and coups\nthat merely reshuffle leaders, causing no regime change\n(No change). To estimate the effect of coups on repression,\nwe compare levels of repression in the year before the coup/\nattempt to repression in the year after it, limiting the sample\nto dictatorships that experienced coups. The before-and-\nafter comparison allows us to rule out the possibility that\ncoups and repression are correlated because coups occur\nmore frequently in more repressive countries.\nLet C F A D N\n( , , , ) denote coup type and define\nE\nK\nC k\nKC\nt\nk\nt\nk\nC\n=\n( )\n + -\n-\nwhere k indexes KC coup events of type C, and R R\nt t\n+ -\n-\nis the difference in repression between the post- and pre-\ncoup year. To recover an estimate of EC (for coups of type\nC), we fit the following linear model\nR reCoup ostCoup\ni t\nC\ni t\nC\ni t\nC\ni t i t\n=      \n+ + + + +\nwhich includes binary indicators of pre- and post-coup\nyears (with coup years as the reference category) and coun-\ntry (\ni\n) and time-period fixed effects (\nt\n).7 The estimated\nwithin-country change in repression over the 3-year coup\nwindow ( t t\n- +\n ) is the difference between the coef-\nficients of the post- and pre-coup indicators. For example,\nthe estimated change in repression around adverse regime\nchange coups ( C A\n= ) is E A = \n- \n. If this is positive,\nit indicates there is more repression in the post-coup than\nthe pre-coup year.\nFigure 2 illustrates the results, with each estimate com-\ning from a separate model for each type of coup: Failed\ncoups, Adverse change, Democratizing and No change\nDerpanopoulos et al. 5\n(reshuffling).8 The left panel includes data from 1950 to\n2010, while the right panel restricts the sample to the post-\nCold War years. During the full period, repression is lower\nafter failed coups, democratizing coups and reshuffling\ncoups, but the effects for Failed coups and No change are\nsmall and not statistically different from zero. Higher\nrepression follows coups that initiate new dictatorships,\nhowever, consistent with the experience of Guinea after the\n2008 coup. In other words, dictatorships that replace other\ndictatorships via a coup tend to use more violence against\ncitizens than the dictatorships they replaced. The post-Cold\nWar pattern looks similar, but the worsening of repression\nfollowing coups that replace one dictatorship with another\nis even greater, as is the reduction in repression after\ndemocratizing coups.\nWe next look at the effect of coups on repression using\nevent data. We use two sources: the Worldwide Atrocities\nDataset (WAD) (Ulfelder and Schrodt, 2009), and the\nSocial Conflict in Analysis Database (SCAD) (Salehyan\net al., 2012). The former codes deaths of noncombatants\nbroader manifestations of instability, such as protests and\nGiven our focus on repression, we rely mostly on WAD, but\nin order to analyse as many coups as possible. Using these\ntwo sources, we create a variable measuring the change in\nnumber of deaths recorded in the 12 months following each\ncoup event compared to the 12 months preceding it. These\ndata allow us to focus on repression in the months immedi-\nately before and after coups, unlike the data used in Figure\n2. In order to capture repression, we only aggregate deaths\nfrom government-sanctioned lethal atrocities coded in\nWAD and deaths from pro-government violence coded in\nFigure 3 displays this information for all coups that\ntype. This includes 30 failed coups, seven democratizing\ncoups, seven adverse regime change coups and five leader-\nreshuffling coups. Boxplots summarize the distribution of\nchanges in deaths. They show that, for all except reshuf-\nfling coups, the median within-country change is zero \u00ad the\nmedian is the dark line in each box. Though we cannot be\nstatistically confident that repression increases after coups\n\u00ad even for reshuffling coups \u00ad we nevertheless believe there\nare some patterns worth noting.\nFirst, only one (failed) coup event is followed by a\ndecrease in civilian deaths. No lethal violence occurred\neither pre- or post-democratizing coups (D); hence the\nwhole distribution falls on the zero line. Substantial\nincreases in repression against citizens follow other kinds\nof coup, however. A considerable amount of violence fol-\nlows adverse regime change coups (A), consistent with the\nannual data evidence in Figure 2. Leader-reshuffling coups\n(N) are also associated with an increase in violence.\nHowever, this is owed mostly to one large outlier (which\nFigure 2. Coups and repression.\n6 Research and Politics \nhas been removed from the graph to aid interpretability).\nFinally, increases in post-coup deaths follow a number of\nfailed coups (F), the modal type in this period.\nTo sum up the evidence in this section, most coups, suc-\ncessful or failed, are followed by greater repression against\ncitizens.Although yearly indices, which exclude the year of\nthe coup itself, suggest a possible decrease in repression\nafter some coups, particularly democratizing ones, event\ndata, which track the months immediately after coups, doc-\nument no short-term decreases. The annual data allow a\nconfident claim that substantial increases in repression fol-\nlow coups initiating new dictatorships, and the monthly\ndata supplement this claim with suggestive evidence that\nmore atrocities are committed against citizens.\nConclusion\nSeveral scholars have recently challenged the standard\ninterpretation of military coups as anti-democratic. Instead,\nthey argue, a coup can help usher in democracy. Our results\ngive pause to such optimism.\nTo assess whether coups are associated with democrati-\nzation, we investigated what follows coups against dicta-\ntors, excluding coups against democracies. We show that\ncoups are not systematically correlated with democratiza-\nCold War. On the contrary, the perpetrators of coups tend to\noust dictators only to impose new ones.\nFurther, we show that many coups in dictatorships\nlead to increases in human rights abuses. Using a yearly\nrepression measure, we show that coups that launch new\ndictatorships are followed by increases in state violence\nagainst citizens. With more fine-grained event data, we\nnote that the year after all but one post-Cold War coup\nagainst dictatorship brings either an increase or no change\nin civilian deaths. In short, the months that follow coups\ncan be bloody, even if the coups themselves were not.\nAcknowledgements\nFor comments, we thank Andreas Beger, Jonathan Powell and\nClayton Thyne, as well as the editors of Research & Politics and\ntwo anonymous reviewers.\nConflict of interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nBarbara Geddes and Joseph Wright acknowledge funding for this\nNotes\n1.
