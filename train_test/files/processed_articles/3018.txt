Much of the increase is due to an\nincrease in the percentage of the heaviest\nAmericans, those who are obese rather\nthan merely overweight.2 Of particular\nconcern is the high prevalence of obesity\nin women, especially black and Mexican\nAmerican women. More than 37% of black\nwomen and 34% of Mexican American\nwomen are obese compared with 22% of\nwhite women.2\nThe NHLBI (National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute) Obesity Education Ini-\ntiative Expert Panel recently released a\nreport1,3 intended for physicians and as-\nsociated health care professionals, re-\nsearch investigators, and policymakers that\npresented a series of evidence-based clini-\ncal guidelines on the assessment and treat-\nment of obesity. Based on these guide-\nlines, clinicians can classify those patients\nat risk for increased morbidity and mor-\ntality and rely on an algorithm to identify\nan appropriate treatment recommenda-\ntion--either advice regarding the impor-\ntance of maintaining current weight and\naddressing other risk factors or specific\ngoals for weight-loss treatment and risk\nfactor modification.1\nSpecifically, the panel recom-\nmended that \"risk status should be as-\nsessed by determining the degree of over-\nweight or obesity based on body mass\nindex (BMI), the presence of abdominal\nobesity based on weight circumference,\nand the presence of concomitant CVD risk\nfactors or comorbidities.\"1(p62) The recom-\nFrom the Stanford Center for\nResearch in Disease Prevention,\nStanford University School of\nMedicine, Palo Alto, Calif.\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

For a\ngiven BMI, individuals with larger waist circumferences\n(ie, exceeding the cutoff points) are thought to be at\nhigher relative risk for disease than individuals of similar\nweight with smaller waist circumferences. This hypoth-\nesis includes patients of normal weight with large waist\ncircumferences. The recommendation to assess obesity-\nassociated risk factors, especially those related to CVD,\nrecognized that such concomitant risk factors are often\nassociated with excess weight8 and that the treatment of\nsuch risk factors can be as important as the treatment for\nexcess weight.1\nTo date, no study has identified the percentage of\nAmericans needing weight-loss treatment using the\npanel's treatment algorithm. Such data are critical for\nphysicians and other health care professionals to deter-\nmine how the algorithm will affect the demand for\ntreatment services. In addition, given the constraints of\ntime and cost in the present health care system, it is\nimportant to evaluate the clinical utility of assessing 3\ndifferent measurements (BMI, waist circumference, and\nCVD risk factors) to identify patients in need of weight-\nloss treatment.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to esti-\nmate the percentage of Americans needing weight-loss\ntreatment using the panel's treatment algorithm. We com-\npared this algorithm with less complex algorithms, in-\nMETHODS\nConducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,\nHyattsville, Md, NHANES III assessed the health and\nnutrition of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population\nof the United States using the same stratified, multistage\nprobability design used in previous NHANESs. It was\nconducted in two 3-year phases. Phase I was conducted\nor older.\nThe staff conducted NHANES III in households, ad-\nministering questionnaires to families, adults, and chil-\ndren. Standardized medical examinations followed, con-\nducted in NHANES III mobile examination centers. The\nhousehold surveys included demographic, socioeco-\nnomic, dietary, and health history questions; the medical\nexaminations included measurements of blood pressure and\nlipid and glucose levels.\nThe sample for our analysis included black, Mexican\nAmerican, and white women and men aged 25 to 64 years\nwho completed both the home questionnaire and medical\nexamination. We used the lower age cutoff point of 25 years\nto ensure that most individuals had completed their high-\nest level of education (a covariate included in our analy-\nsis) and the upper age cutoff point of 64 years to avoid prob-\nlems of selection effects due to morbidity and mortality\nunrelated to CVD.10 We excluded data for adults in the fol-\nlowing order: adults whose surveys were coded by NHANES\nIII as unreliable (n=16), women who were pregnant\n(n=162), adults who did not complete both the home ques-\ntionnaire and the medical examination (n=890), adults from\nother ethnic groups (n=488), and adults missing values for\neducation level (n=107). The protocol for this analysis\nwas approved by the Stanford University Administrative\nPanel on Human Subjects in Medical Research, Palo Alto,\nCalif.\nParticipants who classified their race or ethnicity as black,\nMexican or Mexican American, or white were included in\nour analysis. Participants reported the highest grade or year\nof school that they had completed. We selected years of edu-\ncation as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) be-\ncause of its strong association with indicators of over-\nweight11 and its role as a possible confounder of ethnic\ndifferences in obesity.12 In addition, unlike income or oc-\ncupation level, the measure of years of education is avail-\nable regardless of employment status, is a more constant\nmeasure of lifelong SES, and is not affected by the risk fac-\nThe NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative Expert Panel\ntreatment algorithm proposed that health care profession-\nals assess patients' BMI, waist circumference, and obesity-\nassociated diseases and risk factors (eg, CVD risk factors,\nsleep apnea, gallstones, and stress incontinence) when iden-\ntifying patients in need of weight-loss treatment.1 The pri-\nmary outcome variable for the present study was the per-\ncentage of adults meeting the criteria of the panel's treatment\nfactors}.\nAnthropometric measures (height, weight, and waist\ncircumference) were obtained according to standard pro-\ntocols.15 The waist was measured at the iliac crest.9 Body\nmass index, a measure of relative weight, was calculated\nas weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in\nmeters.\nFor this analysis, we focused on the 7 CVD risk fac-\ntors recommended by the panel for assessment because of\nthe strong associations of abdominal obesity with CVD risk\nfactors.6 Physical inactivity was not included in the 7 pri-\nmary CVD risk factors by the panel because of the lack of\nexisting quantitative risk cutoff points.1 The 7 CVD risk\nfactors are listed below.\n1. Cigarette smoking. Participants were classified as\ncurrent smokers if they reported that they had smoked at\nleast 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and were cur-\nrently smoking cigarettes.\n2.

We examined data for 9102\nblack, Mexican American, and white adults from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nRESULTS\ncould not be classified using the panel's treatment algo-\nrithm because they had incomplete data for BMI (n=4),\nwaist circumference (n=307), the presence of 2 or more\nCVD risk factors (n=462), or some combination of these\nassessments (n=94). Black participants were more likely\nto have incomplete data (12.0%) than Mexican Ameri-\n.01). However, there were no significant differences be-\ntween those with complete and incomplete data for the\n3 algorithm assessments by sex, age, years of education,\nor BMI.\nThe selected NHANES III sample included 2844 black,\nwomen, aged 25 to 64 years, who completed both the\nhome questionnaire and the medical examination and had\ncomplete data for the 3 algorithm assessments. There were\nlarge numbers of women and men in 2 subgroups that\nare typically underrepresented in studies of ethnic dif-\nferences in obesity: Mexican American adults with more\nand white adults with less than 12 years of education (329\nwomen and 318 men). Descriptive results for sociode-\n140 mm Hg or higher and/or their diastolic blood pres-\nsure was 90 mm Hg or higher and/or they reported cur-\nrently taking prescribed medicine for hypertension.\n3. High level of non\u00adhigh-density lipoprotein (non-\nHDL) cholesterol. The panel's treatment algorithm recom-\nmended identifying patients with a high level of low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, LDL cholesterol\nidentified participants with a high level of non-HDL cho-\nlesterol rather than a high level of LDL cholesterol for 2\nreasons. First, non-HDL cholesterol levels may be a better\nindicator of atherogenic lipoprotein particles than indi-\nrectly estimated LDL cholesterol levels.16 Second, the mea-\nsurement of non-HDL cholesterol does not require fasting\nblood samples and, thus, allowed the use of the entire\nNHANES III sample (only half of the sample fasted\novernight). Measurements were taken from serum speci-\nmens and analyzed by standard protocols.9 The non-HDL\nvalue was calculated as the difference between total cho-\nlesterol and HDL cholesterol levels. Participants were clas-\nsified as having a high level of non-HDL cholesterol if the\nand 187.8 mg/dL for women) or higher, a research-\nderived cutoff point corresponding to the LDL cutoff point\n4. Low level of HDL cholesterol. Participants were\nclassified as having a low level of HDL cholesterol if\ntheir HDL cholesterol level was less than 0.9 mmol/L\n5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment algo-\nrithm recommended identifying patients with clinical type\n2 diabetes (ie, fasting plasma glucose level  7.0 mmol/L\n[126.0 mg/dL]). Fasting plasma glucose levels were deter-\nmined using a microadaptation of the national glucose oxi-\ndase reference method9 and were available for the half of\nthe sample that fasted. Therefore, participants were clas-\nsified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus if they fasted for 8\nhours or longer and had plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L\n(126 mg/dL) or higher and/or if they reported a medical\nhistory of diabetes mellitus (other than during preg-\nnancy) with an age at onset older than 25 years.\n6. Family history of premature CHD. The treatment\nalgorithm recommended identifying patients with a family\nhistory of premature CHD if their father or other first-\ndegree male relative (eg, brother) experienced a definite\nmyocardial infarction or sudden death at or before 55 years\nof age or at or before 65 years of age for their mother or\nother first-degree female relative (eg, sister). Because a pre-\ncise measure of family history of premature CHD was not\navailable, we used a combination of the only 2 existing\nNHANES questions on family history of CHD. We identi-\nfied participants with a family history of premature CHD\nif they reported that any of their blood relatives (includ-\ning grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles,\nand cousins, living or deceased) had ever been told by a\ndoctor that they had a heart attack before the age of 50\nyears and if the participants reported that at least one par-\nent or sibling (first-degree relative) had experienced a heart\nattack.\n7.

The predictor variables were eth-\nnicity (black and Mexican American adults were com-\npared separately with white adults; each comparison used\nwhites as the reference group), years of education (con-\ntinuous and centered at 12 years); and the first-order\ninteraction term (ethnicityeducation). Age was not\nused as a predictor variable because it was a CVD risk fac-\ntor used in the panel's treatment algorithm to construct\nthe outcome variable.

Mexi-\ncan American adults were younger, had fewer years of\neducation, and were less likely to be born in the United\nStates than black or white adults.\nAs previously mentioned, the panel recommended assess-\ning 3 measures: BMI, waist circumference, and CVD risk\nfactors.1 The treatment algorithm was constructed to rely\non either 1 (eg, BMI 30) or a combination of 2 of the 3\nfactors) to identify patients needing weight-loss treat-\nment. Table 2 displays the percentage of black, Mexican\nAmerican, and white women and men by all possible com-\nbinationsofthe3assessmentmeasuresforcomparison.The\ntreatment recommendations--either \"advise to maintain\nweight/address other risk factors\" (M) or \"clinician and pa-\ntientdevisegoalsandtreatmentstrategyforweightlossand\nrisk factor control\" (T)--are listed at the bottom of the col-\numn of each assessment combination.\nNormal-Weight Adults\nFor brevity, the term normal-weight adults in the present\nstudy describes all adults with a BMI less than 25, includ-\ning underweight adults. As shown in Table 2, when using\nthe panel's treatment algorithm to determine the appro-\npriate treatment recommendation (M or T), it is only nec-\nessary to measure waist circumference for adults of nor-\nmal weight with 2 or more CVD risk factors (columns C\nand D). However, almost no women (1.0%-1.8%) or men\n(0.0%-0.2%) were of normal weight, had a large waist cir-\ncumferenceasdefinedbythepanel,andhad2ormoreCVD\nrisk factors (column D). That is, almost no normal-\nweight adults were identified as needing weight-loss treat-\nment perhaps in part because the correlation between BMI\nand waist circumference was high for all ethnic groups for\nIf the waist circumference cutoff point was low-\nered to 76.2 cm (30 in) for women, a value associated\nwith a 2-fold higher risk of CHD in women,4 4.0% of black\nwomen, 3.0% of Mexican-American women, and 6.9%\nof white women would be identified as needing weight-\nloss treatment (ie, normal-weight participants who met\nor exceeded the 76.2-cm waist circumference cutoff point\nand had 2 CVD risk factors).\nOverweight Adults\nment algorithm relies only on the assessment of BMI and\nthe presence of 2 or more CVD risk factors to identify\nadults needing weight-loss treatment (columns G and H).\nIn fact, the panel's recommended waist circumference cut-\noff points (ie, 88 cm for women or 102 cm for men)\ncould be increased or decreased without affecting the over-\nall percentage of overweight adults identified as need-\ning weight-loss treatment. For instance, for overweight\nwhite women with 2 or more CVD risk factors, lower-\ning the waist circumference cutoff point to 76.2 cm would\nchange the relative percentages in columns G and H from\never, the overall percentage of overweight white women\nidentified as in need of treatment would remain the same,\n8.3% (add columns G and H).

All rights reserved.\nreceived the same treatment recommendations using the\npanel's algorithm (based on BMI, waist circumference,\nand CVD risk factors) and a less complex algorithm (based\non BMI and CVD risk factors only). In addition, the less\ncomplex algorithm based only on BMI and CVD risk fac-\ntors identified a substantial percentage of at-risk over-\nCVD risk factors in need of treatment. These at-risk over-\nweight adults, for whom treatment could prevent sub-\nsequent obesity, would be missed using only the usual\ncriterion of a BMI of 30 or higher. Given increasing time\ndemands on clinicians and other health care profession-\nals, using the less complex algorithm based only on BMI\nand CVD risk factors appears to be sufficient for identi-\nfying patients in need of weight-loss treatment.\nIn this study, almost no women (1.0%-1.8%) and men\n(0.0%-0.2%) were of normal weight, had a large waist cir-\ncumference as defined by the panel, and had 2 or more\nCVD risk factors. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that\nwaist circumference may not be useful for identifying nor-\nmal-weight patients who need weight-loss treatment.\nHowever, in a recent epidemiological study4 examining\nthe relationship between self-reported waist circumfer-\nence and incidence of CHD in women, a smaller waist\ncircumference cutoff point of 76.2 cm was associated with\na 2-fold higher risk of CHD. Thus, a lower cutoff point\nmay be more appropriate for normal-weight women.\nClearly, further research is needed to determine whether\ncutoff points for waist circumference exist that are in-\ndicative of disease in normal-weight men, too.\nIn the panel's algorithm, measuring waist circum-\nference does not add independent information for iden-\nweight-loss treatment nor does it make recommenda-\ntions for different types of treatments for overweight pa-\ntients with and without a large waist circumference. In\nfact, the waist circumference cutoff points can be raised\nor lowered without affecting the overall percentage of\noverweight adults identified for weight-loss treatment.\nThus, the recommendation to assess waist circumfer-\nence in addition to BMI and CVD risk factors to screen\nall overweight patients may be undermined because of\nthe added time and cost involved for clinicians. How-\never, assessing waist circumference may be helpful when\ntracking and motivating subgroups of patients for whom\nit is important to measure treatment efficacy using mul-\ntiple outcomes over time. Such patients include those with\nmetabolic complications due to CVD1 and those who are\nunaccustomed to thinking that they are at risk and need\nto lose weight.\nThe high correlation between BMI and waist cir-\ncumference found in the present study for women and\nmen across different ethnic groups suggests that it may\nbe difficult to discern the independent contribution of\nwaist circumference to either total or abdominal obe-\nsity. In a recent critique of the literature, Molarius and\nSeidell17 called for more rigorously defended theoretical\nand biological rationales when identifying anthropomet-\nric indicators for abdominal obesity, such as waist cir-\ncumference and waist-hip ratio. Likewise, our findings\nunderscore the need for future scientific evaluation of an-\nthropometric indicators and cutoff points before imple-\nmenting health care policy.\nINTERVENTIONS\nBased on the less complex algorithm of BMI and CVD\nrisk factors only, the percentage of adults identified as\nneeding weight-loss treatment is staggering, especially\namong those with lower educational attainment. For in-\nstance, among those without a high school degree, more\nthan 57% of black women and more than 45% of Mexi-\ncan American women and white women were identified\nas needing weight-loss treatment. Yet, a recent report18\nindicated that 58% of obese patients (BMI  30) are not\nadvised by their health care professional to lose weight.\nSociodemographic characteristics appear to influence the\nlikelihood of being advised to lose weight. For instance,\npatients who were either male or had less education were\nless likely to have received such advice. According to our\nfindings, some patients in greatest need of weight-loss\ntreatment, for instance, 50% of white men and more than\n40% of black and Mexican American men who had not\ncompleted high school, would be missed.\nGiven that both lower educational attainment and\nethnic minority status were related to the need for treat-\nment, innovative tailored treatment programs and\nbehavioral strategies need to be developed that take lit-\neracy, cultural, and language needs into account. Unfor-\ntunately, behavioral weight-loss interventions often are\ntailored for white well-educated women,1 the group of\nwomen least likely to be identified as needing weight-\nloss treatment in our study. It has been hypothesized that\nthe content or delivery of existing weight-loss programs\nmay be less appropriate for some ethnic minority groups,19\nperhaps due to differences in perceptions of body image\nand attractiveness or other cultural influences.20 Prelimi-\nnary studies1,21 described weight-loss programs specifi-\ncally designed to be sensitive to educational level and cul-\ntural values. However, more research is needed that\nsystematically evaluates the efficacy of different compo-\nnents of such interventions. In addition, further re-\nsearch is needed to examine the efficacy of strategies for\nmen of all ethnic backgrounds, especially those with less\neducation.\nOne limitation of the present study was that 8.7% of the\nadults were missing 1 of the 3 assessments (BMI, waist\ncircumference, or CVD risk factors). Conceivably, the ex-\ntremely low percentage of normal-weight adults with a\nlarge waist circumference and 2 or more CVD risk fac-\ntors could be due to differential missing data. However,\nthere were no differences in BMI between those with and\nwithout missing data, making this hypothesis unlikely.\nAnother limitation is that we only examined how the as-\nsessment of a constellation of CVD risk factors (ie, the\npresence of  2 CVD risk factors) affected the percent-\nage of adults identified for treatment. Future studies need\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

A further limitation is that\nwe only examined CVD risk factors, a fraction of the obe-\nsity-associated risk factors recommended for assess-\nment by the panel (eg, gout and gallstones).1 As previ-\nously mentioned, we focused on the CVD risk factors\nbecause of their strong associations with abdominal obe-\nsity. One might expect that the percentage of adults iden-\ntified for weight-loss treatment might increase with the\naddition of other obesity-associated risk factors. How-\never, the addition of other obesity-associated risk fac-\ntors would not affect the findings in the present study\nregarding waist circumference, such as the lack of normal-\nweight adults with a large waist circumference as de-\nfined by the panel.\nDespite these limitations, the use of NHANES III to\nempirically evaluate the treatment algorithm of the NHLBI\nObesity Education Initiative Expert Panel had a number\nof strengths: The 2 largest ethnic minority populations\nin the United States, blacks and Mexican Americans, were\noversampled to provide reliable health estimates across\nmore than 1 ethnic group; the sample included suffi-\ncient numbers of men and women aged 25 to 64 years at\nthe extremes of SES for all ethnic groups; the noninsti-\ntutionalized population of the United States was nation-\nally sampled, allowing for broad generalizability; and ob-\njective measures of height, weight, waist circumference,\nand some of the primary CVD risk factors (eg, blood pres-\nsure and lipoprotein cholesterol level) were used.9\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, this study empirically evaluated the pan-\nel's treatment algorithm to identify patients in need of\nweight-loss treatment. Although waist circumference is\n1 of the 3 key components of the algorithm, it did not\ncontribute independent information for identifying adults\nin need of treatment. The results of this study have im-\nportant implications for the use of the panel's treatment\nalgorithm as currently written but do not negate the po-\ntential value of abdominal obesity as an important indi-\ncator of disease and mortality.\nThis work was done during the tenure of an Estab-\nlished Investigator Award from the American Heart Asso-\nciation, Dallas, Tex (Dr Winkleby), and supported by an\nAmerican Heart Association National Grant-in-Aid and US\ntional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National In-\nstitutes of Health, Bethesda, Md (Dr Winkleby).\nPresented as a poster at the 40th Annual Conference\non Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention of\nthe American Heart Association, San Diego, Calif, March\nWe thank Helena C.
