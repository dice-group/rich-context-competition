    "abstract": "Abstract\nTwelve governments recently signed the much-anticipated Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), sparking heated debate about\nits merits. As a primary motivation for this first \"mega-regional\" agreement, US President Barack Obama argues that the\nTPP is a way for the USA, and not China or someone else, to write the global trade rules of the future. This begs some\nimportant questions, namely which country or countries really did write most of the TPP and thus whose agenda for\n21st century trade might it advance? To answer these questions, we compare the recently-released text of the TPP to\nthe language in the 74 previous trade agreements that TPP members signed since 1995. Our text-as-data analyses reveal\nthat the contents of the TPP are taken disproportionately from earlier US trade agreements. The ten preferential trade\nagreements (PTAs) that most closely match the TPP are all US PTAs. Moreover, the contents of controversial chapters,\nsuch as the one on investment, are drawn even more heavily from past US treaty language. Our study and findings apply\npower-based accounts of international institutions to a landmark new agreement, and portray a more active, template-\nbased process of international diffusion.\n",

The TPP represents a notable\ndevelopment in global trade and has attracted much atten-\ntion, but it is far from the first preferential trade agreement\n(PTA) for any of the dozen signatories. Indeed, each coun-\ntry has signed multiple other PTAs over the past decade.\nThus we set out to compare the TPP to the many agree-\nments signed before it in order to reveal where the contents\nin the TPP come from and which member(s) played the\ngreatest role in crafting the agreement.\nAs the most high-profile trade agreement in years, the\nTPP could establish important guidelines for global trade\nmoving forward. This agenda-setting rationale is empha-\nsized by leaders across the membership, including President\nObama, who professes the following logic: \"...the TPP\nmeans that America will write the rules of the road in the\n21st century...if America doesn't write those rules--then\ncountries like China will\" (Obama, 2015). This raises an\nimportant but thus far unanswered question: whose vision\nfor modern trade agreements does the TPP best reflect?\nDictating new rules is an important way for states to exer-\ncise influence on the global stage, and the answers to this\nquestion can inform general debates about whether interna-\ntional institutions are driven by powerful states and how\nideas spread globally.\nWe evaluate the TPP in a new way by systematically\ncomparing the recently-released text of the TPP to the lan-\nguage in previous trade agreements that its members have\nsigned. Our text-as-data analyses reveal that the language\nin the TPP comes disproportionately from US trade agree-\nments. The ten PTAs that most closely resemble the TPP\nare all US agreements, and the contents of the most contro-\nversial chapters in the TPP draw heavily from US PTAs.\nWho wrote the rules for the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership?\nTodd Allee and Andrew Lugg\n Keywords\nTrade, preferential trade agreements, international negotiations, text analysis\nDepartment of Government and Politics, University of Maryland,\nCollege Park, MD, USA\nCorresponding author:\nTodd Allee, Department of Government and Politics, University of\nEmail: tallee@umd.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nThese findings provide an important new example of how\npowerful states use international institutions strategically to\nadvance their interests (Drezner, 2007). They also suggest a\nmore active global diffusion story (Solingen, 2012) \u00ad one in\nwhich countries have competing blueprints for what should\nbe included in international agreements and work actively\nto insert their preferred rules into landmark treaties.\nThe evolution of the TPP\nThe TPP resulted from a decade-long process in which par-\nticipation gradually expanded. The first major development\nwas the signing in 2005 of the Trans-Pacific Strategic\nEconomic Partnership Agreement by New Zealand,\nSingapore, Chile, and Brunei. In 2008 the USA entered into\nnegotiations with these four, all of whom were joined later\nthat year by Australia, Peru and Vietnam. Over the next five\nyears the advancing TPP negotiations were joined by\nmately Japan (2013). The TPP is intended as a \"living\nagreement,\" meaning that any future TPP members \u00ad\nincluding China \u00ad would be asked to sign the agreement as\nis, thus accepting what the original signatories have speci-\nfied. This makes the language in the TPP critically impor-\ntant for the future.\nFor years our knowledge of the TPP was based on con-\njecture, unofficial comments from participants, and the\nrelease via Wikileaks of controversial draft chapters. But\nsince the negotiated text was released on 5 November\n2015, the entire agreement has been publicly available to\nresearchers and observers. Particularly notable are compet-\ning studies of the agreement's macroeconomic effects, with\nthe pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics\nconcluding that the TPP would boost wages and exports\n(Petri and Plummer, 2016) and a study by Tufts University's\nGlobal Development and Environment Institute predicting\nlower wages and significant job losses (Capaldo et al.,\n2016). Other studies emphasize the mostly-positive effects\nin selected sectors (Peterson Institute for International\nEconomics, 2016) or negative effects in others (Powell\net al., 2016). The investment chapter, particularly the\nsection on investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), has\nattracted considerable attention, nearly all of it negative\nand from organizations that long have been critical on these\nissues (e.g. Bernasconi-Osterwalder, 2015; Johnson and\nSachs, 2015). We take a different approach toward answer-\ning our question about the TPP, by analyzing the entire\nagreement using a novel and unbiased methodology.\nThe TPP needs to be placed in the context of the many\nbilateral and plurilateral trade agreements negotiated since\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in\n1994. Given the continued gridlock in WTO trade negotia-\ntions, preferential agreements like the TPP have become a\nway for states to advance trade cooperation with willing\npartners beyond their WTO commitments (Mansfield and\nReinhardt, 2003). As the first \"mega-regional\" agreement,\nthe TPP could become the new standard for all future trade\nagreements \u00ad and perhaps the basis for any future multilat-\neral negotiations at the WTO. Therefore, the country or\ncountries that had the greatest hand in writing the TPP\ncould see their influence magnified if the contents of the\nTPP become the standard legal text and spread into future\nagreements. This dynamic suggests that countries like the\nUSA can dictate future trade cooperation if they dominate\nemergent institutions like the TPP (e.g. Barnett and Duvall,\nComparing the TPP to previous PTAs\nComparing the TPP to pre-existing PTAs is facilitated by\nthe fact that WTO-era PTAs are structured similarly and\ntypically address the same issues. The TPP is broad with its\n30 chapters, yet nearly all existing PTAs involving TPP\nmembers also include chapters on issues such as dispute\nsettlement, antidumping, safeguards, and general services.\nMost also include TPP-parallel chapters on electronic com-\nmerce, financial services, investment, and intellectual prop-\nerty, among others.\nAt the same time, we emphasize that the many PTAs\nsigned by TPP members exhibit considerable heterogeneity\n\u00ad particularly from one country to the next \u00ad and there is\nscant evidence of a common template. As an important\nfoundational step we compare the pre-existing PTAs of\nTPP members to one another using our primary text-com-\nparison methodology, which we describe more fully in the\nnext section.1 The heat map in Figure 1, which is organized\nby TPP members, depicts the relationships between each of\nthese 74 PTAs.2 Most apparent is the overall lack of simi-\nlarity among them \u00ad with the vast majority of the cells in\nthe heat map indicating less than 25% shared content\nbetween pairs of PTAs.3 Also note that the few Chinese and\nEuropean Union PTAs represented in Figure 1 have little\noverlap with the other PTAs, thus validating claims that the\nglobal economic powers have different visions for trade\ncooperation. The only areas in Figure 1 that exhibit signifi-\ncant similarity are those that compare PTAs including the\nsame TPP member, which are clustered along the diagonal.\nUS PTAs, in particular, have a high degree of internal con-\nsistency, indicating that the USA pursues its interests in\nnegotiations by reusing preferred language. Thus we con-\nclude that earlier PTAs signed by TPP members are quite\ndistinct, with some individual TPP members inserting cer-\ntain core contents in all of their PTAs.\nThat governments bring a preferred template with them\nto trade negotiations is a view held widely by scholars and\nconsistent with journalistic accounts of the TPP negotia-\ntions (DePillis, 2015). Therefore, we assume that on bal-\nance each TPP member's previous PTAs represent its\nrevealed preferences; that is, what it would like to see, or\nAllee and Lugg 3\nat a minimum would be comfortable with, in any new\nagreement. This assumption is bolstered by the earlier\nrevelation that a country's own PTAs often overlap sig-\nnificantly, and by existing research which holds that coun-\ntries frequently use past PTAs as a model for future ones\n(Allee and Elsig, 2015). As a starting point we assume all\nof a country's PTAs since 1995 could serve as a template,\nbut later we prioritize selected agreements for each coun-\ntry as possible templates.\nTo determine which members had the greatest hand in\nwriting the TPP, we evaluate the concordance between the\nlanguage in each member's past PTAs (over the past two\ndecades) and the language in the final text of the TPP.\nComparing texts in this manner is appropriate, since much\nof the TPP negotiations centered on whose preferred lan-\nguage would be adopted. Text analysis is increasingly\nused in the social sciences (e.g. Grimmer and Stewart,\n2013) and we argue that it is particularly appropriate for\nanalyzing deliberate, written content such as treaties \u00ad\nwhere precise wording and legal interpretation are crucial\nallows us to evaluate the entire TPP text, which others\nhave not done, and to measure the contents of particular\nTPP chapters in a more comprehensive way than can be\ndone with numeric coding.4\nOur central proposition is that past agreement language\nfrom the most powerful TPP members, particularly the\nUSA, should be pre-eminent in the TPP. The USA is the\nlargest actor in terms of market size, entered negotiations\nearly, and has many past PTAs from which to borrow lan-\nguage. This expectation of US influence is inspired by a\nwell-established literature which maintains that powerful\nstates design international institutions in ways that serve\nFigure 1. Heat map of text similarity among Trans-Pacific Partnership members' preferential trade agreements, 1995\u00ad2015.\n4 Research and Politics \npower-centered portrayal of international institutions,\nprominent examples of international cooperation, such as\nthe TPP, occur because key actors view such initiatives as a\nmeanstoadvancetheirgoals(e.g.Gilpin,1987;Morgenthau,\n1978). This was evident two decades ago with the estab-\nhas not been applied to recent trade institutions such as the\nTPP. Thus we investigate this prominent logic in a contem-\nporary, relevant, and consequential context.\nData and methodology\nBecause we are interested in the extent to which actors\nobtained their preferred content in the TPP, we first compile\nand prepare the texts of the relevant trade agreements, start-\ning with the recently-released text of the TPP.5 Next we uti-\nlize the Design of Trade Agreements project and website\n(D\u00fcr et al., 2014) and WTO Trade Agreements Gateway to\nidentify all PTAs signed by TPP members since 1995, a\nperiod that provides a sufficient time-window for compari-\nson but also ensures that comparisons are among modern,\nnew-generation agreements. There are 74 such PTAs, all of\nwhich have official versions in English. To facilitate con-\nsistent comparison, we eliminate idiosyncratic information\nat the beginning and end of agreements (signed dates and\nlocations, pronouncements, etc.), convert all text to lower-\ncase, and remove punctuation.\nSeveral features of our study lead us to eschew the bag-\nof-words approach to analyzing speech and text, which dis-\nregards text order and is often deployed inductively.6 First,\nthe structure of our analysis is dictated by theory and known\nto us ex ante, since we want to compare the TPP with a\nspecific collection of possible source PTAs. Second, the\norder of text is important, since we are analyzing carefully-\ncrafted agreement language that is laid out in a deliberate\nstructure. Likewise, the precise wording of the text also\nmatters because even small differences in text can have a\nprofound effect on legal interpretation (Spirling, 2012).\nTherefore, we adopt a methodology that computes tex-\ntual similarity for any two documents \u00ad in our case the\nTPP and each of the 74 existing PTAs \u00ad by identifying\nperfectly-matching text in common word sequences\ngreater than six words.7 Relying on common 6-grams or\ngreater allows us to preserve important information con-\ntained in word order and ensures that simple, everyday\nphrases do not constitute a match.8 This approach, and\nthese same metrics, have been used in other social-science\napplications (e.g. Corley et al., 2011; Ehsbaugh-Soha,\n2013). For each PTA\u00adTPP pairing we generate the num-\nber of perfectly matching words, which we then divide by\nthe total words in the PTA to produce a \"percentage cop-\nied\" number that is comparable across agreements. We\nalso aggregate these agreement percentages at the country\nlevel, to see which of the 12 members was most successful\nin getting its preferred contents in the TPP.\nThe prominence of US language in the\nTPP\nOur analyses reveal that US treaty language is pre-eminent\nin the TPP, suggesting that the USA had heavy influence in\nwriting this important new agreement. Figure 2 depicts the\nexisting PTAs of TPP members that have the most lan-\nguage replicated in the TPP. The prevalence of US agree-\nments, highlighted with blue dots, is striking. The ten\nclosest-match agreements all include the USA, with none\nof the other TPP members achieving anything close to the\nsame level of \"success\" in penetrating the TPP. The US\nagreements at the very top of Figure 2, which include bilat-\neral PTAs with Bahrain, Oman, and South Korea, each\nhave about 50% of their contents that can be found verba-\ntim in the TPP. TPP members Peru, Australia, and Chile\nenter into the top fifteen \u00ad but only by virtue of their agree-\nments with the USA.\nTo obtain a better sense of what is being taken from past\nPTAs, we present in theAppendix a few side-by-side exam-\nples from actual PTA texts, which come from different PTA\nchapters (intellectual property, investment, and telecommu-\nnications). First note that the common text across PTAs (in\nred) is overwhelmingly substantive as compared to generic.\nMoreover, large sections of TPP language are copied en\nmasse from earlier US PTAs. The TPP text highlighted in\nthe left column also can be found verbatim in the parallel\nUS agreements on the right \u00ad whether those with Bahrain\nand Colombia (intellectual property), Oman and Panama\n(investment), or Peru (telecommunications). By compari-\nson, the non-US agreements share more limited (Malaysia\u00ad\nPakistan, and Singapore\u00adEuropean Community) or\nincomplete (Peru\u00adEuropean Community\u00adColombia, and\nPeru\u00adJapan) amounts of text in common with the TPP.\nThe evidence thus far indicates that the TPP draws\nheavily from US agreements, yet we investigate further\nfrom a country-by-country perspective. For each TPP\nmember, we calculate the average percentage of its text\nthat is replicated in the TPP across the various 74 PTAs to\nwhich it is a signatory. These country-averages appear in\nFigure 3. As expected, the USA leads by a substantial mar-\ngin. On average, nearly 45% of the text of US PTAs from\npaces the percentages for those next on the list, Australia,\nCanada, and Peru, who see just over 30% of their past PTA\ncontents in the TPP. Most others are in the mid-20% range,\nincluding Japan, which is somewhat surprisingly next-to-\nlast on the list, and Mexico, which is at the bottom.9\nFurthermore, the results of systematic statistical tests con-\nfirm that the USA is distinct from all other TPP signatories\nin terms of the amount of language from their previous\nPTAs that was copied into the TPP.10\nThe country patterns in Figure 3, and the unique role of\nthe USA, are robust to different methods of comparison\n(see Table 1). The country-level averages above compare\nAllee and Lugg 5\nall of a country's past PTAs (since 1995) to the TPP, but\nnow we utilize only those PTAs that might best reflect a\ncountry's current preferences toward trade agreements.\nFirst we compare only each country's most recent (since\n2005) PTAs to the TPP. These overlap percentages with\nthe TPP increase slightly for the USA and nearly every-\none, as one might expect (Table 1, column 3).11 Next we\nconsider three additional methods to isolate the PTAs that\nmight best reflect each country's trade preferences. We\nre-calculate the TPP-overlap averages for Peru, Chile,\nAustralia, and Singapore after removing their bilateral\nagreements with the USA \u00ad and their averages drop by\n2\u00ad3%. Next we eliminate any past PTAs that were signed\nwith a fellow TPP member, where preferences could be\nconflated. These numbers (in the fourth column) remain\nlargely stable, although they drop notably for Peru, Chile,\nFigure 2. Percentage of text from previous preferential trade agreements of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) members that is\nreplicated in the TPP.\n6 Research and Politics \nand Malaysia. Lastly, we include only those PTAs in\nwhich the country was the dominant partner; that is, had\nthe largest gross domestic product among the PTA mem-\nbers. For most countries this pushes the TPP-overlap per-\ncentagesmodestlyhigher.Finally,werelaxtherequirement\nof perfectly-matching text and instead allow highly simi-\nlar language to count as matching. The resulting compari-\nson percentages (presented in the final column in Table 1)\ntrend upward by 2\u00ad3%.12 Across the varied comparisons\nin Table 1, then, the rankings and intervals are stable and\ndepict a strong US role in writing the TPP.\nWe also pursue more focused comparisons in which we\ncompare chapters of the PTAs directly to corresponding\nchapters in the TPP. We conduct these comparisons for fif-\nteen chapters commonly found in PTAs \u00ad all of which are\nincluded in the TPP. Table 2 lists these chapters and pre-\nsents the findings for each of them. Once again, US suprem-\nacy is apparent. For 11 of the 15 chapters analyzed, US\nlanguage is the most successful; that is, a greater\npercentage of content from US PTAs makes its way into the\nTPP. For the remaining four chapters, the USA has the sec-\nond-highest percentage.\nThe six most-copied chapters in the TPP (investment,\nfinancial services, general services, telecommunications,\nand safeguards) draw particularly heavily upon past US\nagreement language. This includes some TPP chapters in\nwhich two-thirds or more of an earlier US PTA chapter is\ncopied verbatim. Although substantially behind the USA,\nAustralia tends to be next in line in terms of its agreements'\npresence in various TPP chapters (highest percentage on\nenvironmental provisions, and second-highest percentage\non several other issues). Peruvian PTAs are surprisingly\npresent in the TPP, too (highest average percentage content\non procurement and electronic commerce).\nInterestingly, US content is most prevalent in the TPP in\nthe areas of greatest importance to US political and economic\ninterests. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report\nclaims that: \"(a) high priority for the USA in its negotiations\nof bilateral and regional free trade agreements has been\nincreased market access for services providers, especially\nfinancial services\" (Fergusson et al., 2015: 17). Indeed, gen-\neral services and financial services are among the chapters\nwith the highest percentage of US content in the TPP, at 62%\nand 68% on average, respectively. In fact, 72% of the general\nservices language in the 2006 US agreement with Colombia\ncan be found in the TPP, and six US PTAs have more than\n70% of their financial services content that is copied into the\nparallel chapter of the TPP. Furthermore, labor is another\narea highlighted in the CRS report (Fergusson et al., 2015:\n38\u00ad40) and US agreements score highest in this area too (see\nTable 2). Importantly, many of the above are areas in which\nthere is less consensus at the WTO, which makes the impact\nof writing the rules in these areas potentially greatest.\nThe most striking result in Table 2, however, concerns\nthe agreement language on investment. As noted earlier,\nselected parts of the TPP's investment chapter have attracted\nsubstantial attention and controversy. Investment is widely\nFigure 3. Average amount of past preferential trade agreement\ntext replicated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by country.\nTable 1. Alternate comparisons of the average amount of previous preferential trade agreement (PTA) text replicated in the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nCountry All of the\ncountries' PTAs\nOnly PTAs\nyears\nDrop\nPTA with\nUSA\nOnly PTAs\nwith non-TPP\npartners\nOnly PTAs in\nwhich country is\ndominant partner\nRelax exact\nmatch\nrequirement\nAllee and Lugg 7\nconsidered among the most important chapters of the TPP\nand long has been \"a high priority for the USA in its FTA\ncontents of the entire chapter, not just the subset on ISDS,\nand find that a staggering 80% of the language from past US\nPTA chapters on investment is included in the TPP's invest-\nment chapter, as depicted in the left side of Figure 4 (and\nalso Table 2). This is by far the highest percentage for the\nUSA or any other TPP member across any chapter. Indeed,\nmore than 80% of seven US investment chapters are copied\nverbatim into the TPP's investment chapter, as shown in the\nright side of Figure 4. One of the text illustrations in the\nAppendix, on minimum standards of treatment for\ninvestment, also shows this dominance. Furthermore, the\namount of text being copied is significant: more than 7500\nwords from past US investment chapters are written directly\ninto the TPP's investment chapter \u00ad a final piece of evidence\nthat the US \"got what it wanted\" in this controversial area to\nan extent even greater than is realized.\nConclusion\nText analysis is increasingly popular in the social sciences,\nand the methodology is particularly valuable when the text\nbeing analyzed is consequential and deliberate. The TPP is\nboth. Our research represents a new approach toward studying\nTable 2.

It pro-\nvides much-needed context by showing that the TPP is best\nthought of as a competition among members to insert their\nvision for trade cooperation into an important new agreement.\nThe TPP and other PTAs are lengthy and wide-ranging docu-\nments, and we provide a new way to quantify them, and their\nmost important parts, in their entirety.\nOur findings regarding the sizeable US role in writing the\nTPP have implications for several literatures. To begin, we\nsuggest that international diffusion is not always passive or\ndue to mimicry, but instead can occur because governments\nactively champion a particular blueprint for international\ncooperation. Whose model prevails in negotiations is deter-\nmined largely by bargaining power. Thus notable initiatives\nlike the TPP cannot be separated from power politics and\ntheir geopolitical context. Looked at in this way, the TPP is\nbest thought of as an attempt by the USA to shift trade coop-\neration away from the deadlocked WTO to a new venue\nwhere it can successfully write the trade rules for the future.\nThis agenda-setting motivation is central to understanding\nthe TPP, and it will be interesting to observe whether PTAs in\nthe near future draw heavily upon the language in the TPP.\nLastly, our findings provide new information to inform\nlong-standing debates about the trade regime and imminent\ndebates about TPP ratification. We have shown that modern\nPTAs are quite heterogeneous. The TPP represents an inter-\nesting amalgam of its members' priorities \u00ad since a certain\namount of past language from each can be found in the new\nagreement. Perhaps this suggests some movement toward\nconvergence of trade rules. Yet it appears that any future con-\nvergence will be on US terms. We can say with confidence\nthat the USA took a lead role in writing these newest trade\nrules, both overall and on the most controversial and unset-\ntled issues. What remains to be seen is whether the TPP is\nratified and where global trade cooperation advances next.\n"
