Corporate governance research\nshows that ownership structure can influence financial reporting quality, and thus play\nan effective role in capital market decision-making.\nThe main purpose of the current study is to examine the impact of ownership struc-\nture and disclosure quality on the information asymmetry phenomenon among the\nlisted companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Ownership structure (including\nownership concentration and institutional ownership) and disclosure quality (including\nreliability and timeliness) are considered as independent variables, and their impact is\nexamined on the dependent variable (information asymmetry). Consistent with extant\nliterature, bid-ask spread is used as a proxy variable for information asymmetry.\nThe statistical results, based on data collected from 102 listed companies on the TSE\nduring 2007\u00ad2014, revealed positive impact of ownership structure and negative impact\nof disclosure quality on information asymmetry. These results show that information\nasymmetry is less in firms that published more reliable and timely information, and is\nmore in firms with more concentrated ownership structure, higher institutional owner-\nship, and lower disclosure quality. In other words, reliability and timeliness of informa-\ntion have a positive role in stock price identification and close-up views of the buyer and\nseller in TSE.\nFindings of this article can assist accounting researchers and theoreticians in comparing\nreal world facts with hypotheses developed with respect to ownership structure, disclo-\nsure quality, and information asymmetry. By increasing transparency in the capital\nmarkets, market participants, decision-makers, financial analysts, and potential inves-\ntors are aided in their analysis of plans for investments in financial assets.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nDisclosure is essential to market efficiency. Firms\ndisclose their information via legal financial\nreports including financial statements, notes\nto the financial statements, management discussion\nand analysis, and other legal reporting systems. In\naddition, some firms make voluntary disclosures such\nas management forecasts and additional information\ndisseminated in press. Demand for financial reports\nand disclosure is mainly due to information asym-\nmetry and agency problems between management and\nexternal users (Jiang, Habib, & Baiding, 2011).\nInformation asymmetry and agency problem lead\nto inefficient allocation of resources in the capital\nmarket. Therefore, efficient contracts between agents\nand principals are used to solve these problems and\nincrease agent's incentive for disclosure of informa-\ntion. As a result of this process, misevaluation of the\nfirm is reduced and conflicting interests are tuned to\nbe congruent. Environmental and economic factors\nalong with financial characteristics of companies\nimpede information asymmetry and agency problems\nto be solved completely (Jensen & Meckling, 1976).\nAccounting disclosures under uncertain (risky) situ-\nations are essential for investors. So, firms attempt to\nmake high-quality disclosures to attain investors' trust\nand reduce their uncertainty.\nA key challenge for well-developed markets is optimal\nallocation of savings to existing investment oppor-\ntunities. Usually, there are many firms and entrepre-\nneurs who are willing to attract resources for purposes\nof applying their business ideas. While both inves-\ntors and practitioners are willing to operate business\nactivities, matching resources to investment opportu-\nnities in business sector is highly complicated for two\nreasons. First, managers have a better knowledge about\nthe value of investment opportunities than the depos-\nitors, and also, they have more incentive to overstate\nthe value of their firms. Therefore, investors face infor-\nmation asymmetry problem when deciding on invest-\nment in firms. Second, after depositors (investors)\nhave invested their money in a firm, managers have an\nincentive to use their investment in an inappropriate\nway, so that the agency problem appears (Beyer et al.,\nAccounting information (including accounting disclo-\nsures) plays important roles in well-developed capital\nmarkets. First, accounting information enables those\nproviding firm's capital (including shareholders' and\ncreditors') to evaluate potential return for investment\nopportunities (valuating or ex-ante role of accounting\ninformation). Second, accounting information enables\nthose providing firm's capital to monitor the usage of\ncontributed capital to the firm (stewardship or ex-post\nrole of accounting information). Generally, agency prob-\nlems and information asymmetry constrain optimal\nallocation of resources in capital markets (Beyer et al.,\n2010). Accounting disclosure is a good mechanism to\nfacilitate safe transmission of information between\nmanagement and investors, which play an important\nrole in mitigating information asymmetry (Healy &\nCapital structure is among the important factors\naffecting information asymmetry and agency problem.\nSome theoreticians believe that, according to active\nmonitoring hypothesis (Demiralp et al., 2011), exist-\nence of institutional investors among shareholders of\nthe firm (ownership concentration) can reduce infor-\nmation asymmetry and in turn mitigate agency costs,\nmainly due to the monitoring role of these types of\ninvestors. On the other hand, based on self-interest\nhypothesis (Statman, 2011), the institutional inves-\ntors have more incentive to access private information\nabout the firm for their trading purposes. In this situ-\nation, these investors are less interested in monitoring\nfirm's activities and more interested in disclosure by\nthe firm and, therefore, are likely to increase informa-\ntion asymmetry and in turn increase agency problems\nIn this backdrop, the main problem to be addressed in\nthis article is the impact of capital structure (including\nownership concentration and institutional ownership)\nand disclosure quality (including reliability and timeli-\nness of disclosure) on information asymmetry.\nBotosan (1997) found a negative relation between the\nlevel of disclosure index and information asymmetry\namong manufacturing companies with less analyst\ncoverage in the security market. Lang and Lundholm\n(2000) argued that disclosure of corporate governance\nand information about capital structure reduced infor-\nmation asymmetry. So, shareholders could more effec-\ntively monitor management actions.\nNoravesh and Ebrahimi (2005) examined the relation-\nships between shareholder composition, information\nasymmetry, and usefulness of performance measures.\nTheir purpose was to provide evidence on the role of\ninstitutional investors in reducing information asym-\nmetry among firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange\n(TSE). Their results showed that firms with more insti-\ntutional investors provided more information about\nfuture earnings compared to firms with less institu-\ntional investors.\nBeeks and Brown (2006) suggested that firms with\nmore concentrated ownership structure made better\naccounting disclosures which reduced information\nasymmetry. LaFond and Watts (2008) showed that\nfirms with more investment opportunities had lower\nfinancial reporting quality and were more likely to\nhave lower level of accounting disclosures. Conversely,\nduring the finalization of investment projects, when the\nfirms' potential for future growth is lower, information\nasymmetry could reduce and, therefore, the quality of\nfinancial reporting could improve.\nHasas and Bazazzadeh (2008) examined the relation\nbetween institutional investors and firms' value; their\nfindings, consistent with active monitoring hypoth-\nesis, showed a significant positive relation between\nthe level of institutional ownership and value of the\nfirm. Nevertheless, their other findings, contrary to\nthe interest convergence hypothesis, did not prove any\nsignificant relation between institutional ownership\nconcentration and value of the firm.\nKhlif and Souissi (2010) found a positive relation\nbetween profitability of the firm and information\nasymmetry. Jiang et al. (2011) examined the impact of\nownership concentration and discretionary disclosure\non information asymmetry among New Zealand firms.\nTheir findings showed a positive impact of owner-\nship concentration along with a negative impact of\ndiscretionary disclosure on information asymmetry.\nReeb and Zhao (2013) tested the relationships between\neducation, experience, and communication among\nboard members, disclosure quality, and information\nasymmetry. Their findings prove an inverse relation\nbetween education, experience and communication\namong board members and information asymmetry.\nEtamadi, Amirkhani, and Rezaei (2011) studied\nthe value relevance of disclosure with respect to\ninformation asymmetry. Their study revealed that\ndisclosures made via financial reports had information\ncontent about future earnings, and investors used this\ninformation for purposes of their decision-making.\nOsta (2011), in his study on relationship between\nownership structure and earnings management,\nsuggested that differences in ownership structure\ncould justify earnings management. In other words, his\nstudy showed a significant negative relation between\ninstitutional ownership, management ownership,\nand earnings management, but a significant positive\nrelation between company ownership and earnings\nmanagement. Rahimian, Hemati, and Soleymanifard\n(2012) studied the impact of earnings quality on\ninformation asymmetry among the firms listed on TSE.\nTheir study provided evidence on negative impact of\nearnings quality on information asymmetry of firms.\nDai, Kong, and Wang (2013) investigated how informa-\ntion asymmetry and mutual fund ownership affected\nthe listed companies' earnings management. The\noutcomes of the study showed that reducing informa-\ntion asymmetry improved firms' earnings management\nbehaviour. Further, they also found that compared to\nthe short-term mutual funds, the long-term mutual\nfunds promoted earnings quality more by adopting a\nmonitoring role.\nHan, Jin, and Kang (2013), by measuring information\nprecision, observed that managerial ownership was\npositively associated with financial analysts' public and\nprivate information precisions, largely consistent with\nthe alignment view of managerial equity ownership.\nKosaiyakanont (2013) examined the importance of\nfinancial analysts as information intermediaries in\nthe emerging capital market of Thailand. The find-\nings provided evidence that more analysts following\na company mitigated information asymmetry among\ninvestors and led to improved stock market liquidity in\nThailand's emerging capital market, similar to the role\nthey had been found to play in developed markets.\nUyar, Kilic, and Bayyurt (2013) investigated the factors\nthat impacted the voluntary information disclosure\nlevel of Turkish companies. The findings revealed an\nassociation between the voluntary information disclo-\nsure level and the variables such as firm size, auditing\nfirm size, proportion of independent directors on the\nboard, institutional/corporate ownership, and corpo-\nrate governance.\naffecting the extent of corporate voluntary information\nin Sweden. The findings showed asymmetric\ninformationandagencycostsasimportantdeterminants\nof the extent of strategic corporate information, that is,\nvoluntary information, in Swedish companies. Larger\nfirms seemed to reduce agency costs and narrowed\nthe information asymmetry by increasing the level of\ninformation disclosed.\nAli (2014) investigated the impact of ownership struc-\nture on corporate voluntary disclosure in Tunisia. The\nresults showed that the level of voluntary disclosure\nwas negatively significantly related to the blockholder\nownership and family ownership, while it was posi-\ntively related to the proportion of institutional investor\nownership and firm performance.\nBoubaker, Hamrouni, and Liang (2015) examined the\nrelative performance of several corporate governance\nfactors, specifically the characteristics of board of direc-\ntors, managerial ownership, and voluntary disclosure,\nin improving firm information environments based\non a B-convex method on a sample of 70 non-financial\nFrench-listed firms, belonging to the SBF 120 index.\nThe results of the study showed that 68.57 per cent of\nthe sample firms were located on the efficiency fron-\ntier. Corporate governance practices appeared to serve\nas effective monitoring for the top executives of these\nfirms, which reduced information asymmetry between\ninsiders and outsiders, thereby improving the informa-\ntion environment.\nSatta, Parola, Profumo, and Penco (2015) studied the\nexplanatory power of corporate governance issues,\nsuch as ownership structure and board composition, as\npotential determinants of communication quality. The\nresults showed that a diffuse ownership along with\nthe existence of an audit committee was associated\nwith increased qualitative levels of voluntary disclo-\nsure, while managerial ownership, board size, and the\nnumber of board committees presented a negative rela-\ntion to disclosure. Moreover, institutional investors'\nownership and the presence of independent directors\nwere not related to disclosure quality.\nAlbawwat and Yazis Ali Basah (2015) studied the rela-\ntionship between characteristics of corporate govern-\nance and structure of ownership on voluntary disclo-\nsubstantial degree of voluntary disclosure was demon-\nstrated in high-level corporate governance awareness\nand implementation in Jordan. Specifically, the factors\nof board compensation, audit firm size, and govern-\nment ownership significantly impacted voluntary\ndisclosure.\nAgency problems and information asymmetry limit\noptimal allocation of resources in capital markets\n(Beyer et al., 2010). Accounting disclosure is a mech-\nanism which facilitates safe transmission of informa-\ntion between management and investors, and plays an\nimportant role in mitigating information asymmetry\n(Healy & Palepu, 2001). Based on these concepts, the\nfirst and second hypotheses are developed as follows:\nH\n: There is a significant relation between timeliness of\ndisclosures and information asymmetry.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between reliability of\ndisclosures and information asymmetry.\nAccording to the active monitoring hypothesis, exist-\nence of institutional investors and major investors\namong shareholders of the firm (ownership concen-\ntration) can reduce information asymmetry and in\nturn mitigate agency costs, mainly due to the moni-\ntoring role of these investors. On the other hand, based\non self-interest hypothesis, institutional investors and\nmajor investors have more incentive for accessing\nprivate information about the firm for their trading\npurposes. In this situation, these investors are less inter-\nested in monitoring firm's activities and more inter-\nested in disclosure by the firm and, therefore, are likely\nto increase information asymmetry and in turn increase\nagency problems (Jiang et al., 2011). Based on this, the\nthird and fourth hypotheses are as follows:\nH\n: There is a significant relation between ownership\nconcentration and information asymmetry.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between institutional\nownership and information asymmetry.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe current study is considered as a semi-experimental\nstudy. An inductive method was applied on the ex-post\ndata (using historical data), and correlation analysis\nwas used for the statistical analysis. The initial sample\nincluded data from all the firms listed on TSE during\nthe following conditions were omitted:\n\u00b7 Availability of necessary data for measuring the\nvariables\n\u00b7 Listed at least from 2006 on TSE, and continued to\n\u00b7 Fiscal year ended March 21 every year (end of\ncalendar year in Iran).\n\u00b7 Did not operate as financial intermediaries.\nConsidering the above conditions, the final sample\nfor the study were collected using Iranian databases\nincluding Rahavard Novin, firms' prospectuses, and\ntheir audited financial statements. The statistical anal-\nysis used EViews and SPSS software, and the hypoth-\neses were tested using t-student statistic at the signifi-\ncance level of 95 per cent.\nFollowing Jiang et al. (2011), the first and second\nhypotheses were tested using Model 1:\nSPREAD it = \n+ \nTimeliness it + \nReliability it +\nSize\nit + \nTrading volume it + \nStock price it + \ni,t\nConsistent with Jiang et al. (2011), the following regres-\nsion model was used for testing the third and fourth\nhypotheses:\nSPREAD it = \n+ \nConcentration it + \nInsown it +\nSize\nit + \nTrading volume it + \nStock price it + \ni,t\nDependent Variable\nSPREAD = information asymmetry measured as\nbid-ask spread for firm i in year t.\nIndependent Variables\nTimeliness = proxy variable for measurement of timeli-\nness of disclosures.\nIn this article, timeliness of disclosures was measured\nusing corporate disclosure scores published by the\nIranian Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC).\nInformation dissemination scores for the firms were\ncalculated based on their reporting characteristics such\nas reliability and timeliness of their reporting.\nReliability = proxy variable for measurement of relia-\nbility of disclosures.\nIn this article, reliability of disclosures was measured\nusing corporate disclosure scores published by the\nIranian SEC. Information dissemination scores for the\nfirms were calculated based on their reporting char-\nacteristics such as reliability and timeliness of their\nreporting.\nConcentration=proxyvariableforownershipconcentra-\ntion. By ownership concentration, we mean percentage\nof shares owed by main owners. Shareholders owning\nmore than 5 per cent of all outstanding shares at the\nend of the year were classified as the main owners.\nInsOwn = percentage of shares held by governmental\norganizations and other public companies.\nControl Variables\nSize = measured as logarithm of total assets at the end\nof the year.\nTrading volume = measured as total number of shares\ntraded during the year.\nStock price = measured as closing price of firm's stock\nat the year end,\nFINDINGS\nDescriptive Statistics\nDescriptive statistics of independent, dependent,\nand control variables for data from the 102 sample\nfirms, including mean, median, standard deviation,\nminimum, and maximum are presented in Table 1.\nDetermination of an Appropriate Model for\nRegression Estimation\nChaw Test\nResults from F-test for regression models used in this\nstudy are shown in Table 2.\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\nVariables Mean Median Standard Deviation Min Max\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nTable 2: Chaw Test for Regression Models\nRegression Models F Statistic p-value\nSignificance\nTest Results\nModel 1--for testing 1st\nand 2nd hypotheses\nhypothesis is\nrejected\nModel 2--for testing\n3rd and 4th hypotheses\nhypothesis is\naccepted\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nNote. ** denotes significance level of 5%.\nFor Model 1 used to test the first and second hypotheses,\nconsidering the significance of Chaw's test results, null\nhypothesis (which says that using pool model is more\nappropriate) is rejected. In other words, due to existing\nsingular or group effects, panel data method should be\nused for regression estimation. In the following section,\nresults of Hausman test to determine whether the panel\ndata is random effect or fixed effect are described.\nFor Model 2 used to test the third and fourth hypoth-\neses, considering the significance of Chaw's test results,\nnull hypothesis (which says that using pool model is\nmore appropriate) is accepted. In other words, since\nthere are no singular or group effects, pool data method\nshould be used for regression estimation so that there is\nno need to perform Hausman test.\nHausman Test\nAfter constants are determined (not to be the same for\ndifferent years), there is a need to find an appropriate\nmethod (fixed effects or random effects) for regression\nestimation purposes. In this article, Hausman test\nwas used to test the null hypothesis, that is, random\neffect estimation is consistent against alternative\nhypothesis, arguing that random effect estimation is\ninconsistent.\nThe results from Hausman test for Model 1 used to test\nthe first and second hypotheses are presented in Table 3.\nThe Hausman test output shows that X2 statistic for\nat 5 per cent level, and leads to the disapproval of null\nhypothesis; thus, considering this result, panel data\nwith fixed effects was used for the estimation of Model\n1 to test the first and second hypotheses.\nTable 3: Hausman Test Results\nRegression Model X2 Statistics p-value Test Results\nModel 1--for testing 1st\nand 2nd hypotheses\nis rejected\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nNote. ** significance level of 5%.\nTesting Classic Assumptions for Regression\nEstimation\nBefore the estimation of any regression model, the\nclassic assumptions behind the linear regression models\nwere tested. These tests and their results are discussed\nin the next section.\nNormality of Independent Variable Distribution\nThe Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test was used to determine\nwhether the distribution of independent variables was\nnormal, results of which are presented in Table 4. Since\nthe significance level calculated in the Kolmogorov\u00ad\nSmirnov test is more than 5 per cent (0.586), as presented\nin Table 4, null hypothesis for this test is rejected and,\ntherefore, we can conclude that the distribution of\nSPREAD (independent variable) is normal.\nTable 4: One-Sample Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov Test Results\nDependent Variable P-value Test Result\nSPREAD\nProxy for information\nasymmetry\nDistribution is\nnormal\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nResiduals' Autocorrelation\nThe Durbin\u00adWatson statistic was used to test the pres-\nence of autocorrelation in the residuals. This statistic\nis generally used to test the following hypotheses in\nthis respect:\nH\n=Thereisnosignificantautocorrelation intheresiduals\nH\n= There is a significant autocorrelation in the residuals\nIf the Durbin\u00adWatson statistic is between 1.5 and 2.5,\nthen the null hypothesis (no autocorrelation between\nresiduals) is accepted; else, the alternative hypothesis\nis accepted.\nDurbin\u00adWatson statistic, R-square, and adjusted\nR-square for both the models used in this article are\nshown in Table 5.\nTable 5: Testing Autocorrelation between Residuals\nRegression Model R-square\nAdjusted\nR-Square\nDurbin-Watson\nModel 1--for testing 1st\nand 2nd hypotheses\nModel 2--for testing 3rd\nand 4th hypotheses\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nAs shown in Table 5, Durbin\u00adWatson statistic for both\nthe models is between 1.5 and 2.5. Therefore, the null\nhypothesis, that there is no significant autocorrelation\nin the residuals, is accepted.\nAfter testing the classic assumptions for regression\nmodels, the results from the estimation of the regres-\nsion models and the test of the main research hypoth-\neses are discussed in the following section.\nTesting Research Hypotheses\nThe results of estimation of regression Model 1 used\nto test the first and second hypotheses are presented\nin Table 6. As shown in Table 6, F-statistic for Model\nmodel is of appropriate level. Also, estimated R-square\nand adjusted R-square for Model 1 are 53.5 per cent and\n51.1 per cent, respectively. Based on this, therefore, it\ncan be concluded that explanatory variables used in the\nregression Model 1 can explain only 53.5 per cent of the\nchanges in information asymmetry.\nTable 6: Regression Estimation Results for Model 1\nSPREAD\nit\n= \n+ \nTimeliness\nit\n+ \nReliability\nit\n+ \nSize\nit\n+\n\nTrading volume\nit\n+ \nStock price\nit +\n\ni,t\nVariables Multiplier Standardized\nBeta\nt-statistic Significance\nConstant \nTimeliness \nReliability \nSize \nTrading\nvolume\n\nStock price \nAdjusted\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nIt should be noted that the positive (negative) sign of\nfigures presented in Standardized Beta column shows\nthe direct (reverse) impact of each variable on informa-\ntion asymmetry of the sample firms.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between timeliness of\ndisclosures and information asymmetry.\nAs shown in Table 6, timeliness of disclosures is signifi-\ncant at 5 per cent (sig. = 0.016); also, the absolute value\nof t-student statistic for this variable is \u00ad2.822, which\nproves that it is significant at 5 per cent level. Therefore,\nat 95 per cent level of confidence, the first research\nhypothesis that there is a significant relation between\ntimeliness of disclosures and information asymmetry is\naccepted.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between reliability of\ndisclosures and information asymmetry.\nAs shown in Table 6, reliability of disclosures is signif-\nvalue of t-student statistic for this variable is \u00ad3.012,\nwhich proves that it is significant at 5 per cent level.\nTherefore, at 95 per cent level of confidence, the second\nresearch hypothesis, that there is a significant relation\nbetween reliability of disclosures and information\nasymmetry, is accepted.\nResults from the estimation of regression Model 2 used\nto test the third and fourth hypotheses are presented\nin Table 7. As shown in this table, F-statistic for Model\nmodel is of appropriate level. Also, estimated R-square\nand adjusted R-square for Model 1 are 57.8 per cent and\n54.4 per cent, respectively. Based on this, therefore, it\ncan be concluded that explanatory variables used in\nthe regression Model 2 can explain only 57.8 per cent\nof the changes in information asymmetry. It should be\nnoted that positive (negative) sign of figures presented\nin Standardized Beta column shows the direct (reverse)\nimpact of each of the variables on information asym-\nmetry of the sample firms.\nTable 7: Regression Estimation Results for Model (2)\nSPREAD\nit\n= \n+ \nConcentration\nit\n+ \nInsown\nit\n+ \nSize\nit\n+ \nTrading volume\nit\n+ \nStock price\nit +\n\ni,t\nVariables Multiplier\nStandardized\nBeta\nt-statistic Significance\nConstant \nConcentration \nInsown \nSize \nTrading\nvolume\n\nStock price \nAdjusted\nR-square\nSource: Authors' Analysis.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between ownership\nconcentration and information asymmetry.\nAs shown in Table 7, ownership concentration is signif-\nicant at 5 per cent (sig. = 0.000); also, the absolute value\nof t-student statistic for this variable (5.215) is higher\nthan the relative value from t-student table at the same\ndegree of freedom, which proves that it is significant\nat 5 per cent level. Therefore, at 95 per cent level of\nconfidence, the third research hypothesis that there is\na significant relation between ownership concentration\nand information asymmetry is accepted. Moreover,\npositive sign of standardized beta estimated for owner-\nship concentration (4.258) in the regression Model 2 can\nbe considered as its positive (direct) impact on informa-\ntion asymmetry.\nH\n: There is a significant relation between institutional\nownership and information asymmetry.\nAs shown in Table 7, institutional ownership is signifi-\ncant at 5 per cent (sig. = 0.000); also, the absolute value\nof t-student statistic for this variable (6.445) is higher\nthan the relative value from t-student table at the same\ndegree of freedom, which proves that it is significant\nat 5 per cent level. Therefore, at 95 per cent level of\nconfidence, the fourth research hypothesis that there is\na significant relation between institutional ownership\nand information asymmetry is accepted. Moreover, the\npositive sign of standardized beta estimated for institu-\ntional ownership (3.445) in the regression Model 2 can\nbe considered as its positive (direct) impact on informa-\ntion asymmetry.\nCONCLUSION\nAccounting information (including accounting disclo-\nsures) plays an important role in well-developed\ncapital markets. First, accounting information enables\nthose providing firm's capital (including shareholders\nand creditors) to evaluate potential return for invest-\nment opportunities (valuating or ex-ante role of\naccounting information). Second, accounting informa-\ntion enables those providing firm's capital to monitor\nusage of contributed capital to the firm (stewardship\nor ex-post role of accounting information). Generally,\nagency problems and information asymmetry constrain\noptimal allocation of resources in capital markets\n(Beyer et al., 2010). Accounting disclosure is a good\nmechanism to facilitate safe transmission of informa-\ntion between management and investors, which plays\nan important role in mitigating information asymmetry\nCapital structure is among the important factors\naffecting information asymmetry and agency problem.\nSome theoreticians believe that according to active\nmonitoring hypothesis, existence of institutional inves-\ntors and main investors among shareholders of the\nfirm (ownership concentration) can reduce information\nasymmetry and in turn mitigate agency costs, mainly\ndue to the monitoring role of these types of investors.\nOn the other hand, based on self-interest hypothesis,\ninstitutional investors and main investors have more\nincentive to access private information about the firm\nfor their trading purposes. In this situation, these inves-\ntors are less interested in monitoring firm's activities and\nmore interested in disclosure by the firm, and, therefore,\nare likely to increase information asymmetry, in turn\nincreasing the agency problems (Jiang et al., 2011).\nStatistical results derived from the analysis of data from\npositive (direct) and negative (reverse) impacts of\nownership structure and disclosure quality on informa-\ntion asymmetry, respectively. These findings suggest\nthat information asymmetry is more in firms which\nhave major investors, higher level of institutional\nownership, and lower disclosure quality compared to\nother firms. Overall, the findings are consistent with\nthe self-interest hypothesis.\nREFERENCES\nAlbawwat, A., & Yazis Ali Basah, M. (2015).
