    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe article analyzes ergonomics as a social and cultural phenomenon, as something that is formulated and described by\nspeakers in a specific social context; in a company that is specialized in producing ergonomic office furniture. Through a\ncase study of an office chair, the article examines how ergonomics and its association with the vision of the potential users\nand their working spaces are constructed by the relevant actors in project meetings and individual interviews during the\nmanufacturing process. The article is concerned with how, in the process of producing an office chair, the chair gains an\nidentity of an aesthetic design object and how this comes to mean the reformulation of the idea of ergonomics. The empirical\nanalysis also provides insight into how the somewhat grand discourses of soft capitalism or aesthetic economy are not\nabstract, but very much grounded in everyday practices of an organization. The article establishes how the vision shared by\nall the relevant actors invites active, flexible, and cooperative end-users and how the vision also has potential material effects.\nThe research is an ethnographically inspired case study that draws ideas from discursive psychology.\n",

This is especially true in the case of office work as\nmost offices have undergone, and will most likely undergo,\nextensive changes when it comes to adopting new technolo-\ngies and products. Although academics and policy makers\nmight agree that there is a real need to develop the practice\nof ergonomics, there may be other contradictory develop-\nments in modern culture that are also reflected in the orga-\nnizational culture as well as design culture, and those may\nin fact diminish the role played by the practice and under-\nstanding of ergonomics.\nThe object of this study is not ergonomics as such; rather,\nit is understood as a cultural idea and resource that actors can\nutilize for different purposes in different contexts. The article\nanalyzes how the vision of ergonomics is constructed during\na manufacturing process in a company that specializes in\nproducing ergonomic office furniture and products, and how\nthis vision is intertwined with certain conceptions of office\nworkers and work spaces.\nThose who design and produce material objects and inte-\nrior design concepts to organizational settings anticipate how\ntheir products will be interacted with, and how they will fit\nwithin specific spaces (Dant, 2008). The vision of the role of\nergonomics, and the related visions of future workers and\nwork environments act as tools that help organize design\nknowledge to create a shared conception and consensus of\nthe aims of specific projects. In addition, the visions of future\noffice workers and office environments do not just reflect\nreality but actively strive to shape it and contribute to creat-\ning that reality (Pollock & Williams, 2010). The idea that the\nproducers' and designers' intentions and ideas are in some\nways embodied in the design and also responded to by the\nOberdiek, 1995) is not new, but there is still a lack of empiri-\ncal research that identifies the practices and arguments which\naim to freeze these visions and intentions into certain kind of\noffice spaces and furniture.\nAnalyzing the material and aesthetic dimensions of mod-\nern organizational culture has lately become a rich and grow-\ning field of critical research (see, for example, Chugh &\n1University of Tampere, Finland\nCorresponding Author:\nVirve Peteri, School of Social Sciences and Humanities, University of\nEmail: virve.peteri@uta.fi\nBad Enough Ergonomics: A Case Study of\nan Office Chair\nVirve Peteri1\n Keywords\noffice furniture, ergonomics, discursive psychology, ethnography, design, office work, soft capitalism, aesthetic economy\n2 SAGE Open\nWitz, Warhurst, & Nickson, 2003). This field of research\nshows how the design of objects and spatial settings for mod-\nern organizations is also a physical embodiment of a specific\norganization's culture and values. Sometimes, the display of\nthings and people is identified as presenting the values of\n\"knowledgeable capitalism\" or \"soft capitalism\" (Chugh &\n2009), while highlighting the soft characteristic of modern\nwork life: creativity, inspiration, emotions, and aesthetics.\nIndeed, it would be naive to assume that the visions the\ndesigners and producers promote would be somehow iso-\nlated from larger cultural and societal values and discourses.\nHowever, as part of this developing field of research, the\nreformulation of ergonomics has yet not gained attention,\nand this article aims to shed light on the specific meanings of\nergonomics and their possible consequences through a case\nstudy of an office chair.\nCentral to the literature concerning soft capitalism is the\nproposition that it is a form of capitalism that puts emphasis\non organizations as flexible entities that \"go with the flow,\"\nalways in action and on the move, aiming to produce workers\nwho fit this type of an organization. Flexible organizations\naim to recreate themselves by attempting to generate new\ntraditions and representations of themselves and the world,\ninstead of accepting established knowledge. In fact, the\nrefusal of established knowledge is the basic premise on\nwhich these organizations are built. Also, one form of this\nrecreation is to promote new kinds of office buildings that\nmaterialize and demonstrate the new flexible organization\nusually by trying to maximize social interaction and innova-\ntion (Thrift, 2005). The rhetoric of soft capitalism is the rhet-\noric of caring and sharing (Thrift, 2005), and it is concerned,\nas already mentioned, with beauty, emotions, and playful-\nness (Chugh & Hancock, 2009). It strives to enhance com-\ncreate new slogans, transform information and knowledge to\nfind \"fresh\" ways to motivate employees and attract custom-\ners. This rhetoric identifies the success of an organization to\nlie with culture, narratives, knowledge, and creativity rather\nthan with technologies, rationality, and cost\u00adbenefit calcula-\ntions even though its practices have a strong utilitarian\ndimension, and it is basically an attempt, as Paul Heelas\n(2002) notes, to instrumentalize these soft values for eco-\nnomic ends.\nThe literature concerning soft capitalism has some impor-\ntant resonances with the work of Gernot B\u00f6hme (2003) as is\nalso pointed out by Shalene Chugh and Hancock (2009).\nB\u00f6hme comes to the conclusion that we have entered into an\nadvanced phase of capitalism which may be characterized by\nan aesthetic economy. By this, he means that the aesthetic\nqualities of commodities have developed into an autonomous\nvalue, a new type of use value. What is central here is the way\ncommodities can be attractive, add new feeling to places,\nspaces, and people, and \"serve to stage, costume and intensify\nB\u00f6hme also introduces the concept of aesthetic labor\nwhich refers to all those practices that \"aim to give an appear-\nance to things and people, cities and landscapes, to endow\nthem with an aura, to lend them an atmosphere,\" and accord-\ning to B\u00f6hme, this concept encompasses all human activi-\nties, be it the activities of artists, designers, or producers, that\naim to \"lend to things, people and ensembles that more which\ngoes beyond their handiness and objective presence.\"\nAesthetic laborers take part in the process of creating a new\nvalue, a staging value, and here B\u00f6hme also expands the\ndefinition of aesthetic labor to include more than just embod-\nied self-presentations of employees. He casts light on the\nimportance of analyzing the process of creating staging value\nwith all its practices, things, and people who interact to cre-\nate this something more (Chugh & Hancock, 2009). Joanne\nstating that although some research has been carried out on\nthe market conditions under which different cultural artifacts\nwith an aesthetic value are produced, there is currently a lack\nof empirical work within different fields of cultural produc-\ntion and services to allow us to truly map the diversity of\npractices in which the aesthetic value is produced. And it is\nprecisely this process that my article discusses. The objective\nof the article is how, in the process of producing an office\nchair, the chair gains an identity of a special aesthetic design\nobject that has this something more, and how this also comes\nto mean the reformulation of the idea of ergonomics. The\nempirical analysis also aims to demonstrate how the some-\nwhat grand discourses of soft capitalism or aesthetic econ-\nomy are not mere abstractions but very much grounded in the\neveryday practices and discourses of an organization.\nThe article proceeds as follows. Before representing the\nresults of the case study, I will discuss, in brief, ergonomics\nas a historical and cultural idea. After that, the methodologi-\ncal approach and the data used will be introduced in short.\nThe construction of a new vision is analyzed in detail in the\nsubsequent sections. The last section of analysis aims at\nexamining how the chair can be analyzed as an embodiment\nof the new vision. In the concluding section, I present and\ndiscuss the central findings.\nThe Idea of Ergonomics\nMost often, \"ergonomics\" refers to a biomedical framework\nwhich focuses on the measurable qualities of human\u00adenvi-\nronment interaction and the resultant stress to the body.\nHowever, organizational and social issues that did not tradi-\ntionally exist in the core of ergonomics have lately been con-\nsidered to be gaining more relevance; therefore, the\nintegration of social scientific knowledge with ergonomics\nhas increased (Moray, 2008). For example, over the last few\nyears, a field of ergonomics called macroergonomics, which\naims at creating certain novel guidelines for the practice of\nergonomics, has been gaining more importance (Caldwell,\nIt recognizes, among other things, the importance of organi-\nzational culture, history, and goals and is also concerned with\nthe actual design processes of products and the organiza-\ntions'environments. Yet, ergonomics and design as changing\ncultural phenomenon in capitalism have so far not attracted\nattention in empirical studies.\nWork on chair comfort was started in earnest in the 1940s\nand 1950s, around the same time as the term ergonomics was\nintroduced. However, the background for the idea of ergo-\nnomics can be identified in the F.W. Taylor's scientific man-\nagement and in the war efforts. As new weaponry was rushed\ninto mass production, it was soon realized that design deci-\nsions affected performance and reliability in a major way\nmoted the idea of different tasks being divided among experts\nand different experts being separated spatially and seated in\ndifferent types of chairs. This idea developed into a hierar-\nchical organization of chairs which has had a long-lasting\neffect on office chair design. Typically, general office work-\ners, executives, and managers sit in chairs that reflect their\nAfter the Second World War in Great Britain, a group\nconsisting of members who had backgrounds in engineer-\ning, medicine, and human sciences formed a society that\nwas to study \"human beings in their working environment,\"\nand the society came up with the word \"ergonomics\" to\ndescribe what they were doing. All the members of the soci-\nety had been involved in research concerning the capacities\nof soldiers (Pheasant, 1996). After the First and Second\nWorld Wars, the cultural notion of \"mental health\" started to\nchange, as many soldiers were suffering from various psy-\nchological symptoms that had before the wars been consid-\nered biological and more or less preexisting weaknesses in\nthe personality. It was realized that stressful circumstances\ncan produce \"shell shock,\" temporary psychotic symptoms\nthe wars, this new knowledge was taken into account when\ndesigning workplaces and tools that would improve ergo-\nInterest in ergonomics increased even further after the\nfirst commercial computers based on transistors arrived.\nResearchers who were interested in \"human factors\" started\nto analyze people's cognitive styles and system design con-\nnomic furniture design focused on supporting the body; but\nfrom the mid-1980s, ergonomic design had to support the\nbody for 8 consecutive hours of seated PC use. At that time,\nthe Council of the European Union passed legislation that set\nminimum ergonomic standards to be met in the workplace.\nThis originated partly from an increased public awareness of\nconsumer goods' ability to either support or prevent health\nand wellness--whether they were food, cigarettes, cars, or\nHowever, products were designed with the users' point of\nview in mind even before the 1940s. The fact that things such\nas chairs to sit and relax on have existed is a good example of\nthat.Already in the Victorian era, furniture called patent seat-\ning was developed to prevent spinal ill health. The patent\nseating led the way for ergonomic furniture already 120\nyears before ergonomics as a term was coined. However, the\nVictorian culture failed to appreciate the chair that was to\nassist posture, and it was considered vulgar for anyone else\nthan the elderly or the disabled to use. In the Victorian era,\nmaintaining a dignified and upright posture specifically\nwithout the help and support of furniture demonstrated\nmorality, sophistication, and willpower (Pynt & Higgs,\n2008). This example further proves how good usability and\nergonomics, which were of course not the terms used at that\ntime, are not fixed and objective facts but culturally and his-\ntorically shaped.\nIn the late 19th century, the American architect Louis\nSullivan (1896) became famous for presenting the idea that it\nis actually a natural law that form should always follow func-\ntion, indicating that the functional considerations should deter-\nmine the design of an object. However, in practice the products\ndesigned by the representatives of the Modern Movement\nwere not that \"user-centred\"; rather, the early \"functionalism\"\ncame to mean just the lack of ornamentation:\nAccording to this theory, functional objects are, of necessity,\naesthetically pleasing. This is called \"functionalism.\" It was the\ndominant theory underlying the so-called \"Modern Movement\"\nin design. When we consider such modern classics as the Marcel\nBreuer \"Wassily\" chair (1925) or the Mies van der Rohe\n\"Barcelona\" chair (1929) we find very little relationship between\nthe form of these seats and that of the human body which it is\n(presumably) their function to support. The fact that such pieces\nare commonly referred to as \"occasional chairs\" implies that\nthey are without particular function-- except to be used\nThe so-called Postmodern Movement in Arts argued\nagainst the central ideas of functionalism. Corin Hughes-\nStanton (1968) claimed that postmodernism was less \"anti-\npuritanical and more humanistic than the modern school,\"\nand it means that \"we may no longer (to give a single exam-\nple) have to choose between ergonomic but clinically dull\ncars, and pleasure-giving but dangerous cars\" (p. 43). In his\nvision, postmodernism not only produced more variety, dec-\noration, playfulness, and flamboyance in design but also\nacknowledged the importance of ergonomics. It is quite\ninteresting how in this context \"modernism,\" with its striving\nfor designs that would serve a purpose for its users, is now\nassociated with antihumanism that ignores \"all those other\nhuman needs that give so much pleasure and satisfaction.\"\n4 SAGE Open\nIn the 21st century, claims have emerged that follow the\nbasic argument of postmodernists and develop it a bit further\nby arguing that aesthetically pleasing is actually naturally\nfunctional. This argument goes on to say that functionality\nshould follow the form, as pleasurable objects are naturally\ngood for the users. Furthermore, it is argued that modern\ndesign places far too much emphasis on usability and not\nenough on the aesthetics that promote enjoyment and plea-\n2006). Donald Norman, who has been one of the most prom-\ninent advocates of user-centered design, has previously\nargued (Norman, 1998) that the usability of everyday things\nis the most important aspect of design. Recently, Norman has\nclaimed that the emotional aspect may after all be more\nimportant, and that if things are attractive, they usually work\nbetter. From that follows that as the products make people\nhappier, people will also become more creative and innova-\ntive in their work (Norman, 2004). Lately, the idea (also\nfamiliar from the rhetoric of the so-called soft capitalism)\nthat aesthetically pleasing, good looking, or \"cool\" office\ndesign promotes inventions and inspiration has been widely\nembraced by the business sector (e.g. Howell Hirt, 2012;\nYoushaei, 2012), and when searching for information on the\nInternet using search terms such as \"good office design,\" it\nsoon becomes clear that especially information technology\n(IT), advertising, and media companies such as Facebook,\nSkype, Pixar, and Google are presented as leading the way\nfor this line of thinking.\nBy analyzing how my informants talk about ergonomics\nin this study, I do not try to classify them as advocates of a\ncertain view of ergonomics. The interviewees employ exist-\ning and emergent cultural notions of ergonomics as concep-\ntual resources by which they justify their notions. The history\nof the idea of ergonomics and the writings related to soft\ncapitalism are relevant, because they provide background for\nthe interviewees' comments analyzed here. Economic forces\nare at the core of ergonomics as they bring in the claims for\nhumans to adapt to working environments. Even though\nergonomics represents the \"humanitarian argument in organ-\nisation studies\" (Hofbauer, 2000), from a sociological per-\nspective it is also an ideological practice, which shapes\nbodies, actions, and social relations.\nResearch Material and the\nMethodological Approach\nWhen I became interested in the practice of ergonomics in\nthe field of industrial design, especially in the context of\nmodern offices, I contacted a company that specializes in\nergonomic office furniture. I requested a permission from the\ncompany's directors to gather information of their design\npractices. Soon, I got an approval to join in and follow a\ndesign process that we (the company's product manager, one\nof the company's designers and I) decided would most prob-\nably be completed within the time that I had funding for this\nalso described as \"a very interesting case.\"\nI did not inform the company's directors in advance that I\nwas specifically interested in the practice of ergonomics, as I\nalready knew it to be their specialist field. Much to my sur-\nprise, when I inquired about the ergonomic practices of the\ncompany or of the different actors, the informants looked\nmostly bewildered and/or uncomfortable and at times even\nirritated. At first, I was at least as bewildered as my infor-\nmants. As ergonomics concerning office furniture means two\ndifferent things, first, laboratory tests to prove that the prod-\nuct passes the requirements of ergonomic standards, and sec-\nond, the designer's and the team's expertise to produce a\nsuitable chair for certain chosen situations and work tasks,\nmuch of this knowledge is either standardized or probably\ntaken for granted, and therefore, difficult to articulate. It was\nonly later that I came to realize that maybe this very awk-\nwardness itself contained something interesting, something\nworth reflecting on.\nMy research is an ethnographically inspired case study of\nan office chair. The fieldwork period lasted from September\ninterviews at an organization, which specializes in producing\nergonomic office furniture and products. To get to know the\ncompany, I began by exploring the company's annual reports\nits website, Facebook page, and everything that was written\nabout it in magazines and newspapers. The fieldwork in the\ncompany consisted of informal discussions regarding the\norganization's design practices, studying documents express-\ning the guidelines for design and manufacture as well as\ninterviews with relevant actors. The project team that worked\non manufacturing this office chair consisted of several engi-\nneers, two people from the marketing department, a market-\ning director, project manager, technical designer, and\nindustrial designer. The industrial designer was hired from\noutside the company to work on this particular office chair.\nThe interviews took place either in the industrial designer's\nfirm, the company's head office, or in one of the company's\nfactories where the actual production, product development\nmeetings, and different laboratory tests took place.\nFor the purposes of this article, data that consist of informal\nmeetings and discussions, individual interviews with the\ndesigner of the chair, the company's product manager, the\ndesign director, and the design manager, along with the meet-\nings with the project team, have been analyzed.Altogether, the\ndata consist of 15 meetings that were not recorded (these took\nplace in the company's laboratory, company's restaurant or\nduring car journeys from the company's head office to the fac-\ntory) and of seven individual interviews and five meetings of\nthe project team that were recorded and transcribed. The indi-\nvidual interviews lasted from 1 to 2 hr, and the meetings with\nthe project team lasted from 1 to 3 hr. The data also include a\nfilm lasting 30 min, where the designer explains and sketches\nout the design process. This film was originally made for the\nstaff who are involved in the production or selling of the prod-\nucts to \"make them more motivated and involved in the proj-\nect,\" as described by the product manager in an interview. The\nmore informal discussions that were not recorded were written\ndown as field notes. For the purposes of this article, whenever\npossible, I tried to find the data samples from the data that\nwere transcribed, so that I could show word for word how\ninformants described or justified something.\nIn addition, the data contain notes from project meetings\nwritten by the technical designer, and a business abstract of the\nchair (18 PowerPoint slides) created and written by the prod-\nuct manager. The business abstract includes a \"product portfo-\nlio,\" which is an artifact used to evaluate, define, and justify\nthe place of the product in relation to the company's other\nproducts and to similar products produced by competitors. The\nportfolio is utilized to define the market \"slot\" the product is\nintended for: which kinds of environments it is designed for,\nand what the design and price indicate of its place among other\nproducts. The data also include photos and field notes of the\ninternational Stockholm Furniture Fair where the specific\nchair was introduced and marketed for the first time.\nThe analytic approach has derived some ideas from dis-\ncursive psychology. According to discursive psychology,\nartifacts can be perceived as having invitation and inhibition\ntoward certain kinds of actions. An article by Brown and\nMiddleton (2006) draws basic ideas from discursive psy-\nchology, and they assume the position that artifacts can be\nconceived as material frameworks, which either enable or\nconstrain certain discourses or practices. They add that it is\nreasonable to assume that objects place limits on the ways\nthey can be described and constructed in a discourse, but\nthey do not exist \"just there.\" Instead of assuming that there\nexists a given object world, which people describe through\n\"things as they are,\" they state that artifacts and workplace\ncommunication can be approached by analyzing \"how they\nare formulated and described by speakers,\" and thus \"the\nmutual orientation of speakers to things is a discursive\naccomplishment, which can be studied as such\" (Brown &\nview, ergonomic knowledge is something that speakers and\nactors construct in talk and use as a linguistic resource rather\nthan just possess. Hence, a focus on constructions in talk\nrequires the recognition of discourse as \"strategies and mean-\nings\" constructed in conversations. Discursive psychology\ninvolves looking at the forms of language use, its contents\nand functions. Through language, we find ways to speak\nabout objects and artifacts, which may have potential mate-\nrial effects (Brown, Middleton, & Lightfoot, 2001).\nThe Chair as a Symbol of\nOrganizational Change\nThe company in question, which I shall refer to as M\u00f6bel to\npreserve its anonymity, is an old Scandinavian family busi-\nness which designs and produces interior solutions for\nworking environments and public spaces. It is traditionally\nwell known for its high standards of ergonomic furniture and\nis one of the largest companies in its sector in Europe. The\nneed to modify the brand or the narrative of the organization\nhas developed, as noted by the directors, on the realization\nthat the firm has established itself as a prominent actor in the\nfield of ergonomic office furniture. This vision of the com-\npany is so well established that, as M\u00f6bel's project manager\nstated, the vision of good ergonomics has degraded other\nessential images of the company:\nYou have to think of what is an individual product's synergy\nwith our strategy. We have this new slogan that we are launching,\nEmotional Places, which I dig. In my line of work, it has been a\nburden that M\u00f6bel is so strongly seen as a company that produces\ngood ergonomic office furniture. When architects design\nseparate spaces for individuals to work on their computers they\nthink of M\u00f6bel, but when they design lounges, entrance halls\nand boardrooms, it is a different case. (November 2009)\nIt was clear from the outset that the manufacturers wanted\nto produce a chair that would stand for the ongoing organiza-\ntional change to gain that \"synergy with the new strategy,\" as\nthe project manager stated. The chair and the products to fol-\nlow would compose a new \"product family\" and would also\nadvocate a new line of thinking for the whole organization,\nboth outside and inside the organization. In the business\nabstract, the chair is described as embodying a \"classic\" line,\n\"emotional design\" and \"timeless design\" that \"will easily\nadapt to different kinds of architectural environments.\"\nThe new way of thinking was also explained as distanc-\ning the company from the old-fashioned ways of making\ndecisions. One way to pursue this, as I learned from a\nScandinavian business magazine, was that the company\n\"snatched\" a new design director from a globally well-\nknown IT company. The idea was that the new design direc-\ntor would bring with him a more contemporary line of\nthinking and making business, and one embodiment of that,\nas the product manager stated, was the product portfolio that\nthe new design director had created after his arrival. This\nparticular design director described in an interview that the\nway of thinking in M\u00f6bel was very old fashioned and\nbrought with it \"a social democratic way of making deci-\nsions\" as opposed to a more \"focused way that will also\nenable more high profile products and no grey mass.\" This\nis a discursive tactic known as a \"contrast argument\"\nsion seem like a fact by contrasting it with an alternative that\nseems unconvincing and like a bad choice.\nIn an interview, the project manager labeled the \"old way\"\nas a \"Swedish mode of discussing everything endlessly and\nlistening to everyone, so that before long every idea is viti-\nated.\" In a project meeting in spring 2010, the furniture\ndesigner also commented on the progress of the project in an\nironic manner, and stated that he did not object to\n\"Scandinavian dynamics\" as such \"if we achieve a deep\n6 SAGE Open\ncommitment,\" to which the technical designer replied that\nthe slowest part of the process was finally over, and it was\ntime to really get to work. All the key actors of the design\nprocess frequently utilized a discursive construction of the\n\"old model\" as a rhetorical act that needed no other justifica-\ntions. It was a discursive resource that articulated, depending\non the context, a \"natural connection\" between the chair and\nthe new brand, or between the chair and a vision of the\nchanging world of modern offices. In these constructions, the\nold vision is often geographically and politically localized: It\nis a Swedish or Scandinavian way, the social democratic way\nof thinking and making things. The new vision does not have\na similar kind of explicit geographical location or political\nidentity; although it seems evident that it is not a social dem-\nocratic view nor is it restricted geographically to Scandinavia.\nOtherwise, identifying the old vision as Scandinavian and\nsocial democratic would be senseless.\nBelow, the project manager describes the changes in mod-\nern work life, which are closely connected to the new vision\nand design of this specific chair:\nWorking is so different nowadays, and people work in so many\ndifferent places. People work more at home and also, according\nto a result of a recent research conducted by Kontor System\n[name changed], nowadays, offices are more than just that . . .\nthey are meeting places. Modern work life is very fragmented:\npeople work in different places, they travel, they work in their\nhome offices, and increasingly, office spaces are becoming\nmeeting places, not so much reserved for individual standard\nwork stations anymore. People travel more, and not everyone\nneeds a separate desk. That produces challenges for this\ncollection as well. (...) So you have this lounge-like chair, where\nyou sit in a relaxed manner, and the communication is also\ndifferent. I believe that the furniture cultivates behaviour so that\nwhen you have more casual colours and design, it is not a\nmeetinginatraditionalsenseanymore;rather,itisaconversation.\nYou can have a small side-table and your laptop on it, you can\ncheck something, but you can also sit comfortably. Now you\nhave to sit stiffly on your small chairs at small tables, the four of\nBased on the data, it seems that the new organizational\nculture or the brand of the company indicates a new mode of\nthinking about work environments. As in the excerpt above,\nthey are no longer seen as offices or public spaces or lounges\nor entrance halls or board rooms, but as the project manager\nclaims, first and foremost, as \"meeting places.\" Thus, the\nfurniture would need to be more relaxed to support and pro-\nduce freer and more inspirational conversations and meet-\nings. In the excerpt above, modern work life is seen as a\ncollection of fragments and different contexts where one\nworks. The connection between fragmented work tasks and\nchanging workplaces followed by a need to create more\nplaces as meeting places is not obvious. One might even sug-\ngest that fragmented work life could call for a counterbal-\nance in the form of more separate work stations, but the\nproject manager justifies his visions by referring to recent\nresearch. Thus, his views have additional scientific basis and\ndo not seem to require further justification. The director pro-\nvides details of the situation to emphasize the difference\nbetween the old and new models.\nThe firm Kontor System (the name has been changed) that\nproduced the research project, which the project manager\nuses as a justification for his visions, is a company that pro-\nvides services for other companies renting office spaces. The\nresearch project in question was carried out by several insti-\ntutions, and M\u00f6bel was one of the sponsors and collaborators\nof the project. The companies involved offered the cases for\nthe research project and the cases dealt, for example, with\nmobility, open plan offices and new work space solutions. In\nthe research report, the cases were then explicitly described\nas reflecting contemporary working life. This was not a\nresearch result as such but adopted as a starting point for the\nresearch project. Thus, this is a defining moment for the\nvision and the design project, because at this point the vision\ngained a new status and a new identity: It was not only a\nvision in a utopian sense but it became scientific knowledge.\nTo put it bluntly, the companies fed the research project with\nvisions in the form of case studies that were defined as repre-\nsenting the recent developments of working life and spaces.\nAs quid pro quo, they gain a new status and identity for their\nvisions.\nThe old world of meetings and meeting spaces is con-\nstructed in the excerpt as a situation where people have to\n\"sit stiffly in small chairs.\" The lounge-like chair, which is\ntraditionally seen as not being intended for sitting on for long\ndurations, is now constructed as the ideal: It is more comfort-\nable, and not only that, but it also produces more civilized\nbehavior. Therefore, the meeting is no longer a traditional\nmeeting but a \"conversation.\" This vision implies a discus-\nsion that is free of authoritarian aspects. It is a conversation,\nwhere persons meet and share their views.\nWhile the relevant actors represent the old model as an\nantithesis of the new model of organizational culture, the\nclear opposition between these models is actually ambiguous\nwhen analyzed from a discursive point of view. The old\nmodel was referred to, in various contexts of the interview,\nas a \"Swedish\" or \"Scandinavian\" way of discussing things\nindefinitely, and thereby wasting all chances for creating\nanything really innovative. The new model seems to call for\nan attitude toward work where sharing ideas and conversa-\ntions is the most important and essential element of creating\nnew ideas and innovations. It seems that the old model stands\nfor constant discussions and the new model signifies more\nconversations and less working alone. The difference seems\nto be that the new model's conversations take place in more\nopen offices among the designed furniture that is defined as\nmore casual and free spirited. Thus, the workers of the new\nmodel have their discussions in full view of everyone, and\nthese conversations are staged by special design furniture.\nIn the first data sample, the project manager stated that \"it\nhas been a burden that M\u00f6bel is so strongly seen as a com-\npany that produces good ergonomic office furniture.\" Thus,\nthe meanings attached to ergonomics are contradictory. On\none hand, it is one of their special fields of expertise and the\nkey element in their success, and on the other hand, it seems\nto be one of the central reasons they have developed a need\nto remold their brand and their vision.\nThe Reformulation of Ergonomics\nWhen I inquired about the industrial designer's vision of\nmodern work spaces as the context for his products, he also\nutilized the discursive resource of \"the old model\" of office\nenvironments \"when the static idea of ergonomics was the\ncentral way to perceive things here in Scandinavia\" and con-\ntinues in an ironic manner \"people were situated in lines in\ntheir own workrooms doing the same work; it was like fac-\ntory workers in office environments, but now it is more\nmobile.\" And just a few sentences later in the interview, he\ncontinues describing the office chairs that were created on\nthe basis of this old model:\nThey were passive chairs, and the expectation was that a persons'\nneck and hands were to be in a certain fixed position. I do not\nbelieve in that. I believe that the starting point has to be good,\nbut not fixed and static, and a human being herself needs to be\nactive. She has to get up, she has to reach for things, she has to\nstretch in different directions, and raise her legs up and other\nInterestingly, in this extract, the ergonomic quality of a\nchair is not constructed solely as a feature of the chair. More\nemphasis is actually laid on the user of the chair. She has the\nobligation to take responsibility of the ergonomics of the\nchair; she has to stay on the move and not expect that\nthe office furniture will take care of her neck or hands.\nConsidered from a realistic point of view, this is a reasonable\nargument, but when considered from a discursive perspec-\ntive, the statement raises several questions. First, the con-\nstruction of an \"old model\" communicates a vision of office\nwork consisting of monotonous and repeated tasks, which\nreminds one of factory work. Thus, the new open offices\nseem to produce more interesting work and duties, whereas\nseparate workrooms encourage monotonous work. The new\nopen office and the furniture that goes with the new office\nmodel also allow people to be more mobile and almost guide\nthem to be on the move. Consequently, the ergonomics of a\nworking environment becomes the responsibility of an indi-\nvidual worker. A chair's role in this new setting is to encour-\nage workers to be on the move. A chair needs to be good\nenough to sit on but not so good that people would enjoy\nremaining seated for long periods of time. The key element\nof what might be called \"new ergonomics\" is actually that\nthe chair needs to be bad enough to encourage its users to get\nup. The office chairs that have traditionally been considered\nas ergonomic office chairs with their adjustable armrests,\nbackrests, and headrests are now redefined as passive chairs.\nConsequently, in the \"new ergonomics\" the activity or pas-\nsivity of a chair is not a feature of the chair but of the user.\nIn the meetings of the project team, the ergonomic quality\nis very rarely discussed other than when referred to in an\nironic manner as belonging to an old-fashioned view on\ndesigning for work environments. Once at a project meeting,\nwe got to sit on the prototypes of the chair, and each of us had\na chance to make a brief comment on the experience. Mostly\nthe comments could be interpreted as positive or neutral\n(\"very nice\" or \"like it\" or just \"mmm\"), the only exception\nbeing the technical designer who claimed that the chair did\nnot fit his body type. Nobody responded to his comment, not\neven the designer.\nThe ergonomic quality of the chair is most explicitly\naddressed in the film that was produced in spring 2010 to\n\"motivate the employees\" who take part in the production or\nmarketing of the chair. In the film, the designer describes a\ncertain feature of the chair that is typical for chairs he has\ndesigned, and adds that this is \"first of all, ergonomically\nvery well designed\" and \"enables good sitting position and\ndoes not put pressure on the legs.\" Later in the film, the\ndesigner announces that he has hopes of how the products\nwill be marketed, and notes that he wants to say something\nmore about the ergonomics of the chair: \"If chairs were cho-\nsen by vote, the customers would choose a chair that enables\nonly a passive sitting position.\" He continues that these\nchairs \"would remind one of children's car seats, which feel\nsafe, but in that position you cannot really move anything but\nyour fingers.\" He emphasizes the absurdity by acting as\nbeing squeezed in a car seat in a position in which he looks\nlike he can only hold his hands above his shoulders and move\nhis fingers.\nApparently the ergonomic quality of a chair is something\nthat cannot be evaluated by the customers. The example of a\nchild's car seat, even though an anecdote, shows that custom-\ners' opinions and knowledge of ergonomics are quite infan-\ntile, and the customers make choices that might feel \"safe\" or\ngood. Therefore, the sellers have to give advice, so that cus-\ntomers do not make these easy mistakes. In other words, the\ncustomers need to be directed, so that they do not choose\nproducts that feel good, but from a designer's point of view,\ndo not function properly in new office environments that\nneed more active users.\nThe Embodiment of the New Vision of\nOffice Work\nThe active nature of this specific chair is often mentioned as its\nmost important feature. In practice, the chair is designed to be\nflexible in a sense that it allows a tiny amount of movement. It\nis not entirely firm and immobile, not a rocking-chair-like\n8 SAGE Open\nobject, but elastic. This is congruent with the visions that con-\nceptualized workers who are, above all, mobile and share\nrelaxed conversations. The chair itself encourages small\nmovement. It is also consistent with the vision of modern\noffice spaces, in which employees do not have separate work\nstations but use whatever free space there is in an overall open-\nspace office to either work on their laptops or have a chat with\ncoworkers or customers. Interestingly, this flexibility is never\nmentioned as ergonomically good even though it enables vari-\nous sitting positions.\nIn the business abstract, the chair is described as \"a uni-\nversal chair,\" which will fit every kind of situation.According\nto the designer, the flexibility of the chair enables it to be\nused for several purposes: to work alone on the laptop, to eat\nlunch, to have a casual conversation in a more relaxed sitting\nposition, or to have a more formal meeting.Also, the fact that\nthe chair is designed to resemble lounge furniture, as\nexplained by the project manager, invites workers to be on\nthe move and not remain seated for long periods of time.\nThe designer articulates in an individual interview and\nalso in a project meeting in spring 2010 that the design of the\nchair becomes most apparent when there are many such\nchairs in the same space. The designer then goes into saying\nthat several of these chairs together produce a \"certain bal-\nanced rhythm.\" The project manager also reflects that it is a\nfeature that can even be appreciated from a distance and\nfrom outside the office building. Thus, the chairs compose a\nform that is most distinctive only when viewed from a dis-\ntance, for example, through large panorama windows.\nBecause of this, the directors decide that several chairs must\nbe tacked high up on a wall as the chair is presented at the\ninternational Stockholm Furniture Fair. Otherwise, the \"spe-\ncial rhythm\" that can only be properly appreciated from afar\nwould not be visible to the customers. This feature seems to\nspecifically suit an open-space office. Thus, it fits in well in\noffice buildings that have glass walls and are staged to be\nviewed from outside to inside.\nWhen the chair is introduced at the fair, the company\ngives out a press release in which they state that they are\nintroducing a new vision of modern work life. This is a new\npractice, since before this the press releases have just intro-\nduced specific pieces of furniture. Now, the furniture is men-\ntioned only in brief at the end of the press release. In other\nwords, now the company is selling a vision, and the furniture\nis in a secondary position. The vision is taking the leading\nrole. The chair is introduced as an illustration of the vision, a\nmaterialization of it.\nWith the production of this chair, the company also estab-\nlishes several other new practices. The directors and the\ndesigner report in individual interviews that in this specific\nproject, all the decision makers (i.e., the directors and the\ndesigner) met several times even before starting the coopera-\ntion to discuss the characteristics of the new brand and to\ndevelop a shared understanding of the vision of new office\nenvironments and also of what kind of special know-how\nthey expected the designer to bring along. According to the\ninterviewees, it was unusual for these meetings to take place\nmore than a year before any detailed plans of the specific\nproduct existed. The directors explain that they wanted to be\nsure that the designer grasped their whole vision. Then, the\ndirectors made a deal with the designer that he would be\npresent in all the project meetings and would commit his\ntime to make a film where he would explain the story of the\nchair. These were all new practices.\nThe project manager explains the need for these new pro-\ncedures by saying that it is important that the chair is strongly\nassociated with the designer who has won several design\nprizes, and that it would not be as convincing if the project\nmanager instead of the designer were to explain the meaning\nof this chair and its position as part of the new brand and\nvision to the engineers and marketing people. It is much\nmore \"motivating\" when the designer himself takes part in\nthe meetings and delivers the story. \"Stories are vital when\nyou want to make a product sell,\" clarifies the project man-\nager. Thus, you could say that the directors utilize the\ndesigner as a brand managing tool who sells the idea of the\nnew brand to their employees.\nIn the film, the designer explains the vision of changing\nwork environments, and thus delivers the main idea of the\nnew brand to the employees. He describes how the chair can\nbe recognized as a reflection of this vision. He also narrates\nhow the chair can be identified as his creation, because it has\ncertain details that resemble some features of northern nature\nand wild life. Thus, the designer associates the individual\nproduct as part of a larger entity of his entire work as a\ndesigner, and thereby, individual chairs gain an identity as\naesthetic design objects that have a history longer than the\nseparate product as such. They are not just office chairs but\nauthentic design objects to be appreciated as part of a larger\nentity and a long history. The designer incorporates authen-\nticity and originality not only into the product but also into\nthe new brand.\nConclusion\nWith the help of this case study, the article was able to pro-\nvide insight into how material objects come to carry and\nmediate \"ideological meanings\" (see Maz\u00e9 & Redstr\u00f6m,\n2007) that may have very concrete impacts on organizational\npractices and culture, and even on workers' health. In other\nwords, the reformulation of ergonomics does not only mean\nnew ideas and concepts but also very concrete material\neffects on human bodies. Also, design is not only a matter of\naesthetics or usability but it is also about politics.\nThe contribution of this article is twofold. The article has\ndemonstrated how in the process of producing an office\nchair, the chair gains a status of an aesthetic object. In addi-\ntion, the empirical analysis provides insight into how soft\ncapitalism is grounded in the everyday practices and dis-\ncourses of the organization. The article analyzes how the\nreformulation of ergonomics in the company is intertwined\nwith a vision in line with the ideas of soft capitalism. In the\ncore of that vision is the aesthetic object which has to \"speak\"\nthe vision in its materialized form. The objects and artifacts\nthat convey the vision cannot be just any kinds of objects:\nThey have to have the status of an aesthetic design object.\nThus, establishing the vision as truth also means elevating\nand ennobling the identity of the object as an aesthetic object.\nThe fact that when the chair is presented for the wider public\nfor the first time, it is being tacked up high on a wall above\nour heads could, in a way, be seen as a reflection of its ele-\nvated character. The chair is above the everyday life, and\nthus, may even promise to raise us up and above the con-\nstraints of the mundane.\nDespite being small-scale and thus to some extent\nrestricted, the article casts light on the process of creating\nstaging value with all its practices, things, and people who\ninteract to create this something more. The vision as a discur-\nsive or rhetorical accomplishment is accompanied by several\npractices and arguments that work to give the chair an iden-\ntity of an aesthetic object and, hence, make it into a material-\nized form of the vision. The contrast argument works to\njustify the vision on a discursive level; the research project\nhelps turn the utopia into a reflection of reality; the meetings\nbetween the company's directors and the designer solidify\nthe vision as a shared goal; the new press release raises the\nvision into a primary role, and the designer's presence at the\nmeetings and involvement in producing a \"motivational\"\nfilm associate the chair more strongly with the vision and the\ndesigner, and so the chair gains a status of a creation of an\naward-winning designer. Thus, the status of an aesthetic\nobject comes into being as a result of multiple practices and\nchoices made by the directors of the company, the designer,\nthe marketing people, the researchers, and the consumers.\nAs those aforementioned practices and discursive means\nstrive to freeze the intentions of the manufactures, this pro-\ncess can also be seen as domestication of the ideas of soft\ncapitalism. The vision manifests itself through this universal\nchair in contrast with the Scandinavian or Swedish chairs\nand practices emphasizing the local (as meaning here\nrestricted, passive, and narrow) nature of the \"old\" and tradi-\ntional. Not only is this new chair global or international in\nnature but pompously universal as well. In this context,\nScandinavian does not mean authenticity, purity, or equality\nas in the marketing strategies of, for example, Ikea or some\nScandinavian cosmetic brands and clothing companies.\nAccording to the vision, ergonomics belongs to the past, and\nin the past it was very much the local way to perceive and\ndesign things. Even though the roots of ergonomics are not\noriginally in Scandinavia, the fact that ergonomics is so\nstrongly associated with the Scandinavian context is linked\nin the data with the idea of Scandinavia as a promised land of\ntechnical engineering as well as the so-called social engi-\nneering. However, the old way is never described in a matter\nof fact way but with irony which could implicate that the\nvision has not established itself as the dominant truth in\nScandinavia since otherwise there would be no reason to\nridicule the old way. Rather, it could just be presented as a\nhistorical conception that no longer prevails.\nAs said before, although policy makers and academics\nmay share the opinion that the importance of ergonomics is\ngrowing, in the data, ergonomics is constructed as almost the\nkeyword of a bygone age and of old-fashioned ideas.\nErgonomics is pass\u00e9 and not even fashionably retro. It is a\nmodernist dream that does not take into account the consum-\ners' supposed yearning for color, beauty, and mobility. The\njuxtaposition of ergonomics and the so-called humanism has\nits roots in the 1960s postmodernism that saw ergonomics as\ntoo rational an idea lacking pleasure, playfulness, and flam-\nboyance. Needless to say that those were not the original\naims of \"ergonomics\" as a developing idea and practice after\nthe World Wars. It was not developed to bring in the fun to\nworkplaces but to make them more efficient and safe. One\nmight think that ergonomics and good usability are fixed and\nobjective facts, but the article proves how they are culturally\nand historically shaped. In soft capitalism, the office furni-\nture needs to be ergonomically bad enough to encourage the\nusers to take more responsibility of their own health.\nThe new vision is presented as politically neutral and\nhumane as it claims to offer more free-spirited meetings,\ncasual and colorful meeting spaces in contrast with the social\ndemocratic way that produces gray mass and gray office\nworkers. Yesterday's ergonomic chairs are redefined as pas-\nsive, and the new lounge-like furniture is presented as the\nideal. This \"occasional chair\" of the day is defined as more\nuser friendly in a novel way: Ergonomics ceases to be the\nresponsibility of the designer and the manufacturer, and\nbecomes the responsibility of the new mobile worker, part of\nher self-discipline. If the Victorian age refused the basic\nideas of ergonomics to demonstrate sophistication and will-\npower, our age refuses similar values to demonstrate the\nstaging power of things, mobility, and individuality of ideas\nand people as well as to save money. Lounge-like furniture\ngoes with an open plan office that will save square footage\nand reduce costs. The directors of the company also admit\nthis to be the case. There is no reason to hide it as it is con-\nsidered a natural fact.\nThe new vision aims at creating a world consisting of\npeople, objects, and environments that compose a unity that\nwould \"welcome\" this product as a natural element with its\nassociations. The new vision is described as more demo-\ncratic as it invites an open office where everything and\neveryone are in view. The chair itself is democratic in that\nsense that everyone, regardless of their status in the com-\npany, is seated in this very same universal chair. In other\nwords, in this context democracy does not mean one's own\npersonal space and ergonomic furniture but the same aes-\nthetic design furniture and visibility for everyone. However,\nthis universal vision does not include everything and every-\nbody. The chair is suitable, for example, for working on a\nlaptop but not even once is it mentioned as suitable for work-\ning on a desktop computer. Working alone is not part of this\nuniversal idea. A room of one's own would hide the chair's\nstaging value, its special design, and the rhythm it is sup-\nposed to create in an open office space.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nsupportfromtheAcademyofFinlandfundedproject\"Domesticating\nDesign in Work Organizations\" (code 262368) and Kone founda-\ntion funded project \"The Biography of an Office Chair\" is grate-\nfully acknowledged.\nReferences\nBlythe, M., & Wright, P.
