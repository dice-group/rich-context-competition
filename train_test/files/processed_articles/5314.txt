Two studies have\nreported airway irritation-free results fol-\nlowing the administration of remifentanil\nprior to desflurane being used for inhalation\ninduction.8,9 The desflurane used in these\nprevious studies was limited to 1 minimum\nalveolar concentration (MAC) of the dial of\nthe vapourizer,8,9 implying that the expira-\ntory concentration was lower than 1 MAC,\nwhich means the actual concentration of\nthe threshold for airway irritation.12,13\nTherefore, the previous airway irritation-\nfree results could be due to the low MAC of\ndesflurane used in these studies,8,9 regardless\nof the prior administration of remifentanil. In\naddition, the use of a low MAC of desflurane\ncannot guarantee the loss of consciousness\nunder the potent stimuli of intubation.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that the effect\nof remifentanil on airway irritation could\nwork on desflurane induction in a stepwise\nincremental manner using a higher concen-\ntration of desflurane, which is more common\nfor inhaled induction to ensure that LOC is\nachieved in patients. The objective of this\nstudy was to determine the effect-site con-\ncentration of remifentanil target-controlled\ninfusion required for a smooth inhalational\ninduction without airway irritation using\ndesflurane in a stepwise incremental manner\n).\nPatients and methods\nPatient population and study design\nThis prospective observational study enrolled\nconsecutive patients who met the following\ncriteria at the Department of Anaesthesiology\nand Pain Medicine, Ajou University\nHospital, Suwon, Republic of Korea between\ncriteria were as follows: (i) American Society\nof Anesthesiologists physical status I and II;14\n(ii) aged 19\u00ad60 years; (iii) patients who were\nundergoing elective surgery under general\nanaesthesia. The exclusion criteria were as\nfollows: (i) suspected difficult airway; (ii)\nknown history of reactive airway disease.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board (no. AJIRB-\nHospital, Suwon, Republic of Korea. It\nwas registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT\nobtained from all patients.\nAnaesthesia induction methods\nVenous access was obtained from all\npatients using a 20 G intravenous catheter\ninserted into the forearm whilst the patient\nwas on the ward. Patients received no pre-\nmedication. Pulse oximetry, electrocardiog-\nraphy, and noninvasive blood pressure\nwere performed for patients after they\narrived at the operating room. Remifentanil\n(40 mg/ml solution) was loaded into a target-\ncontrolled infusion device (Orchestra\u00d5 Base\nPrimea; Fresenius Vial, Bre\n\u00b4 zins, France)\nusing the pharmacokinetic model of Minto\net al.15 Inspiratory and expiratory concen-\ntrations of desflurane were measured using a\ngas analyser within an anaesthesia ventilator\n(Dra\n\u00a8 ger Primus\u00d5; Dra\n\u00a8 gerwerk, Lu\n\u00a8 beck,\nGermany).\nAfter patients were preoxygenated with\n100% oxygen at 4 l/min using a face mask\nfor 3 min, infusion of remifentanil was\ncommenced. If the respiratory rate was <8\nbreaths/min, the patient was encouraged to\nbreath. Their chest wall rigidity (chest tight-\nness and difficulty in breathing) accompa-\nnied by desaturation (< 95%) was assessed\nfor active management. When the target\neffect-site concentration of remifentanil was\nreached, the vapourizer of desflurane was\ndialled at 4 vol% initially. The concentra-\ntion of desflurane was then increased to 8\nand 12 vol% at intervals of 30 s. The con-\ncentration of desflurane was also calculated\nas a MAC value. The MAC value was the\nage-corrected MAC value of each patient\ncalculated by Mapleson's method.16 Each\npatient was asked to open his or her eyes\nevery 10 s during inhalation of desflurane.\nThe time when the patient did not respond\nto this command was regarded as being\nwhen the patient had achieved LOC. After\nLOC was achieved, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium\nwas administered via intravenous (i.v.) injec-\ntion. Tracheal intubation was then performed\n90s after the administration of 0.6mg/kg\nrocuronium i.v. If airway irritation signs,\nsuch as breath holding, coughing, laryngos-\npasm and excitatory movements (head move-\nment, limb movement, verbal/forceful removal\nof the mask by the patient), developed during\nthe induction period, the dial of the vapourizer\nof desflurane was then set to zero. In addition,\n4mg/kg thiopental i.v. and 0.6mg/kg rocur-\nonium i.v. were administered immediately.\nAfter that, intubation and routine anaesthesia\nwere continued. Breath holding was con-\nsidered no breathing movements for> 30s.\nLaryngospasm was defined as complete airway\nobstruction associated with decrease in oxygen\nsaturation for> 20s. Regardless of the severity\nof the airway irritation sign, the presence of\nirritability was considered as a failed state and\nthe onset time of airway irritation signs,\ninspiratory and end-tidal concentrations of\ndesflurane were recorded.\nThe LOC time was defined as the time\nfrom the start of desflurane inhalation via a\nface mask to the point that the patient did\nnot respond to the verbal command. The\nLOC time, inspiratory and end-tidal con-\ncentrations of desflurane at the LOC point\nwere recorded. Haemodynamic data were\nrecorded at baseline (T0), when the target\neffect-site concentration of remifentanil was\nreached (T1), 1 min after desflurane inhal-\nation (T2), and at LOC (T3). In the case of\nbradycardia (heart rate < 45 beats/minute\n[bpm]) or tachycardia (heart rate > 130\nesmolol i.v. were administered, respectively.\nHypertension and hypotension were treated\nat the discretion of the attending anaesthesi-\nologists (J.Y.Y., Y.J.C., and S.Y.L.). The\ninvestigators (H.W.J. and H.B.P.) who con-\nducted the inhaled induction of desflurane\nand assessed the complications and airway\nirritation were blinded to the effect-site\nconcentration of remifentanil.\nThe effect-site concentration of remifen-\ntanil for preventing airway reactivity was\ndetermined using a modified Dixon's up-\nand-down method.17,18 The initial effect-site\nconcentration of remifentanil was 4 ng/ml.\nThe next target effect-site concentration of\nremifentanil was determined based on the\nresponse of the previous patient. A success-\nful response was regarded as the absence of\nbreath holding, coughing, laryngospasm, or\nexcitatory movements. If any of these symp-\ntoms occurred, it was regarded as a failure\nand the next target effect-site concentration\nof remifentanil was increased by 0.5 ng/ml.\nConversely, if the desflurane induction was\nsuccessful, the next target effect-site concen-\ntration of remifentanil was decreased by\nStatistical analyses\nThe patients were enrolled in this study until\neight crossover pairs were obtained according\nto Dixon's sequential allocation method.18\nThe sample size was decided based on prior\nliterature that demonstrated that the mod-\nified Dixon's up-and-down method required\nmore than the minimum six crossover points\nto minimize the inaccuracy of the individual\nstudy.19 Thus, data from eight independent\ncrossovers of patients were collected for this\nof remifentanil was defined\nas the mean value of independent crossover\npairs (i.e. failure to success of smooth induc-\ntion). The R statistical software package\nversion 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical\nComputing, Vienna, Austria) was used for\ncalculations using the isotonic regression\nmethod to estimate EC50\nalong\nwith 95% confidence interval (CI). The CI\nwas estimated using the bootstrapping\napproach.20 Other statistical analyses were\nperformed using the SPSS\u00d5 statistical pack-\nage, version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. Comparisons between\nthe success and failure groups were analysed\nusing independent t-test, 2-test, Fisher's\nexact test, or Mann\u00adWhitney U-test where\nappropriate. Haemodynamic data were ana-\nlysed with repeated measures of analysis of\nvariance, followed by paired t-test for com-\nparisons across successive time-points. Data\nwere reported as mean\u00c6 SD or the n of\npatients. A P-value < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThis study enrolled 26 patients (12 males,\n14 females) and the demographic character-\nistics of the success (n \u00bc 14) and failure\n(n \u00bc 12) groups are summarized in Table 1.\nThere were no significant differences\nbetween the two groups.

To date, two stu-\ndies have reported smooth induction by\nusing preadministration of remifentanil\nand inhalation of desflurane.8,9 As described\nTable 2.

The use of a low\nconcentration of desflurane may not ensure\nLOC in all patients with the potent\nstimuli of intubation, although the authors\nreported successful induction of anaesthesia.9\nIn addition, the optimal dose of remifentanil\nwas chosen to blunt the haemodynamic\nresponse to intubation, unlike the current\nstudy.9 This present study chose a stepwise\nincremental manner using a high concentra-\ntion of desflurane because it would ensure\nLOC was achieved. Opioids can increase the\nthreshold of airway irritation.6 These present\nresults revealed that remifentanil made\nsmooth inhalation induction possible when\nusing a high concentration of desflurane. This\ncould make induction of anaesthesia using\ninhaled desflurane a feasible option in the\nclinical situation. With regard to cardiovas-\ncular stimulation, no severe hypertension or\ntachycardia was observed in the present study.\nFigure 1.

However, when\n) of remifentanil was used for\nsmooth induction, caution was needed for\nhaemodynamic stability.\nThe inspiratory and expiratory concen-\ntrations of desflurane at LOC in the success\ngroup of the current study were 8.2 vol%\nrespectively. It has been reported that the\ninspiratory and expiratory concentrations\nat LOC using desflurane alone or with\nusing pretreatment with fentanyl and mid-\nazolam, the inspiratory and expiratory con-\ncentrations at LOC were 8.9 vol% and\n5.3 vol%, respectively.27 These results sug-\ngest that an opioid can decrease the anaes-\nthetic requirement for LOC. The mean \u00c6 SD\npresent study. However, the lack of control\ngroup means that it is not possible to\ndetermine if this time was reduced by the\nuse of an opioid. Whether or not pretreatment\nwith an opioid shortens the LOC time remains\ncontroversial because one controlled study\nfound a reduction,5 whereas another study\nfound no difference.27 Considering that remi-\nfentanil produces dose-dependent respiratory\ndepression, there is still a possibility that these\nrespiratory depression effects offset to some\nextent the expected shortening effect of induc-\ntion time due to a decrease of MAC of\ndesflurane.\nThe main airway irritation sign was exci-\ntatory movements in the current study,\nwhich was in line with previous studies.27,28\nExcitatory movements occurred in all\npatients in the failure group. Cough was\npatients and breath holding was found in\nevidence of laryngospasm. Excitatory move-\nments included verbal or forceful removal of\nthe mask by the patient, plus head and limb\nmovements. These excitatory movements\ncould have been the result of the patient's\nresponse to the pungent stimuli or the\nexpression of an excitatory stage (stage 2)\nof anaesthesia. Whatever the cause of the\nexcitatory movements, their presence limited\nthe anaesthesiologist's ability to increase the\nconcentration of desflurane and they were\nthe most common obstacle to the patient\ntolerating inhaled induction with desflurane.\nThe current study had several limitations.\nFirst, the same concentration of desflurane\nwas used for patients of all ages, but the iso-\nMACs are somewhat different in patients\nbasic bias between real plasma concentra-\ntion and the calculated one for remifentanil\nbased on the pharmacokinetic model of\nMinto et al.15,29 Thirdly, the feasibility of\ninhaled induction of desflurane was based\non the objective signs during inhalation.\nThere might be dissatisfaction of patients\ndespite the fact that they seemed to be calm\nduring inhalation. This was not checked in\nthis present study. Fourth, Dixon's up-and-\ndown method has potential limitations for\n. To overcome this limita-\ntion, this present study adopted the isotonic\nregression method and the bootstrapping\napproach as supplementary analyses for\nreducing bias and getting greater precision\nrather than using conventional methods.20,30\nIn conclusion, the EC50\nof\neffect-site concentrations of remifentanil\nrequired for smooth inhalational induction\nwithout airway irritation when using des-\nflurane in a stepwise increment were 3.40ng/ml\nand 4.31 ng/ml, respectively. Therefore,\nprior administration of remifentanil could\nprovide smooth inhalational induction with\ndesflurane.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
