Political\nactors may face uncertainty about their competitors' policy\npreferences, outside options, and objectives (De Winter and\nwhere parties know little about their mutual policy prefer-\nences and office payoffs, government formation is likely to\nbe characterized by considerable delays. Government for-\nmation in these contexts features a series of proposals and\ncounter proposals where the negotiating parties accumulate\ninformation about their partners'preferences and what kind\nof compromise is acceptable for them. The delay may also\nserve as a costly signal to the bargaining parties (and their\nrank-and-file) that other, more advantageous offers have\nnot been acceptable for all bargaining partners. In contrast,\na bargaining situation in which parties have reliable infor-\nmation concerning their mutual preferences and payoffs is\nlikely to be characterized by a swift and short government\nformation process.\nA competing theoretical perspective emphasizes the\ninfluence of the complexity of the bargaining environment\non the length of inter-party negotiations (Martin and\nVanberg, 2003). A complex situation would be coalition\ntalks including numerous parties with highly heterogene-\nous policy profiles. Due to the ideological incompatibility,\nagreeing on a joint policy platform is likely to be time-con-\nsuming, resulting in a long government formation period.\nAt the same time, the larger the number of parties, the more\ndifficult it becomes to reach agreement on policy and the\nallocation of ministerial portfolios. In contrast, fewer par-\nties \u00ad with similar policy positions \u00ad constitute a simpler\nbargaining situation, where negotiations should conclude\nswiftly and without considerable delays.\nGolder (2010) combines both approaches, arguing that\nthe effect of bargaining complexity is conditional on the\nlevel of uncertainty: while uncertainty always leads to\nlonger government formation processes, the complexity of\nthe bargaining situation increases the time required for gov-\nernment formation only in situations where the political par-\nties involved are uncertain about their counterparts'\npreferences. Specifically, assembling the required informa-\ntion on all potential coalition partners' policy and office\npreferences will take considerably longer when more parties\nare involved in coalition bargaining. The effect of complex-\nity is therefore determined by the level of uncertainty, and\nvice versa. This implies that the marginal effect of bargain-\ning uncertainty depends on the level of complexity (Berry\net al., 2012). While a higher level of uncertainty should\nalways increase the duration of government formation\n(Golder, 2010), this effect is strongest in complex bargain-\ning situations. These theoretical insights may be summa-\nrized as follows.\nHypothesis 1: Bargaining uncertainty increases the\nduration of government formation.\nHypothesis 2: Bargaining complexity increases the\nduration of government formation.\nHypothesis 3: The effect of bargaining uncertainty on\nthe duration of government formation depends on the\nlevel of complexity: uncertainty increases the duration\nof government formation at all levels of bargaining com-\nplexity, but its effect is strongest in complex bargaining\nsituations.\nHypothesis 4: The effect of bargaining complexity on\nthe duration of government formation depends on the\nlevel of uncertainty: complexity increases the duration\nof government formation if bargaining uncertainty is\nhigh, while there is no or less of an effect if bargaining\nuncertainty is low.\nData and methods\nWe use a new data set on 297 government formation pro-\ncesses in 27 European democracies to test these hypotheses.\nSpecifically, we study 158 formation processes in Bulgaria,\nthe Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, starting with the\nfirst fully democratically elected government.1\nBased on the ERD data set (Andersson et al., 2014)\nwe also collect analogous data for 139 government for-\nmation processes in 17 Western European countries for\nempirical results for the Western European heartland of\ncoalition studies with new data from Central and Eastern\nEurope.\nThe operationalization of the key dependent variable\nclosely follows that of the existing literature on bargain-\ning duration (Diermeier and van Roozendaal, 1998;\nGolder, 2010). Bargaining duration is thus defined as the\ntime period between the end of the previous and the start\nof the current government. For post-election governments\nthe start of the bargaining period coincides with the date\nof the parliamentary election.2 For inter-election govern-\nments the termination of the previous government \u00ad and\nthus the beginning of the bargaining period \u00ad is deter-\nmined by any change in the government's party composi-\ntion or a change of the prime minister (M\u00fcller and Str\u00f8m,\nbargaining in situations where a new government is trig-\ngered by one or more parties leaving or joining a govern-\nment is set to one day.\nThe empirical analyses feature an indicator variable for\npost-election status capturing the effect of bargaining\nEcker and Meyer 3\nuncertainty. Following Golder (2010), the level of bargain-\ning complexity of each bargaining process is captured\nusing two variables: the number of effective parliamentary\nparties and the ideological polarization in the legislature.3\nThe former is estimated using the standard formula and\nseat shares as legislative weights (Laakso and Taagepera,\n1979). The latter is calculated as suggested by Dalton\n(2008). In this context, data on the ideological positions of\npolitical parties are retrieved using the MARPOR general\nleft\u00adright scale (Volkens et al., 2015).4 Finally, all empiri-\ncal models feature two control variables. The first is an\nindicator variable for bargaining situations following early\nparliamentary elections, as these may be partly endoge-\nnous to the following government formation process. The\nsecond control variable is used to control for `majority\nsituations' in which a single party controls a majority of\nthe seats in the legislature (see Golder, 2010; Martin and\nVanberg, 2003) and potentially no `real' inter-party bar-\ngaining occurs.5\nGiven the nature of our dependent variable, the effect of\nall independent variables is estimated via Cox proportional-\nhazard models with bargaining-time as a dependent varia-\nble. Because all inter-party negotiations are eventually\nbrought to an end and no ongoing bargaining processes are\nincluded in our sample, all observations `fail' and thus no\ncomplex regime for right-censored observations needs to\nbe devised.6 Finally, the interpretation of proportional haz-\nard rates \u00ad the standard coefficients in survival analysis \u00ad in\nthe context of bargaining duration is somewhat counterin-\ntuitive. Here, negative coefficients reduce the risk that\nnegotiations are brought to an end at any point in time,\ngiven that they are still ongoing at that time. Thus, negative\ncoefficients denote factors that extend the bargaining dura-\ntion, while positive coefficients indicate elements reducing\nthe length of inter-party bargaining.\nEmpirical analysis\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of our dependent variable,\nbargaining duration, across and within countries. On aver-\nage, government formation in the Netherlands (90 days)\nand Austria (75 days) takes substantially longer than in\nDenmark (4 days), Greece (3 days), and France (2 days).\nThere is also considerable variation within countries, with\nthe top 5% of the bargaining processes lasting for 95 days\nor more. The average bargaining duration of countries in\nCentral and Eastern Europe falls within these extremes: the\naverage formation duration in the Czech Republic (39 days)\nis similar to that of Belgium (43 days), Spain (42 days), and\nLuxembourg (37 days). With an average of 19 days, the\nduration of government formation was rather short in\nRomania and Slovakia; this is about the same time it takes\nto form governments in Ireland (20 days) and Finland (18\ndays). The dashed lines in Figure 1 show the average length\nof formation processes in Western Europe and in Central\nand Eastern Europe. In general, bargaining duration in CEE\nFigure 1. Bargaining duration across and within European countries.\nNote: The box plots show the distribution of bargaining duration by country. The band inside the box depicts the average (not median) bargaining\nduration, while the whiskers span all data points within 1.5 inter-quartile-range of the nearer quartile. All countries are ordered based on their\naverage bargaining duration. Dashed lines indicate the average duration of government formation processes in Western Europe (WE) and in Central\nand Eastern Europe (CEE).\n4 Research and Politics \n(29 days) is similar to the average length of government\nformation processes in Western Europe (28 days).\nFigure 2 shows the relationships between uncertainty,\ncomplexity, and bargaining duration. The left panel shows\nthe average bargaining duration for inter-election (grey\nbars) and post-election bargaining situations (black bars).\nCoalition talks after parliamentary elections in Western\nEurope (40 days) take on average eight times longer than\nnegotiations in an inter-election context (five days). In\nCentral and Eastern Europe, this difference between post-\nelection and inter-election bargaining is substantially\nsmaller. Here, coalition talks after elections take roughly\ntwice as long as negotiations between elections (43 vs. 18\ndays). While these patterns support the claim that uncer-\ntainty affects the duration of government formation pro-\ncesses (Hypothesis 1), the effect is weaker in the data\ncollected for Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe right panel in Figure 2 distinguishes low complex-\nity (effective number of parties below mean; grey bars)\nfrom high complexity bargaining situations (effective\nnumber of parties at or above mean; black bars). There is\nsome evidence to support the claim that government for-\nmation takes longer in complex bargaining situations\n(Hypothesis 2). Yet, this effect is only visible in Western\nEurope (22 vs. 38 days), but not in Central and Eastern\nEurope. Here, complexity seems to have no positive effect\non delays in the government formation process (31 vs. 27\ndays).\nFigure 3 explores the conditional effects of uncertainty\nand complexity on the duration of government formation\nprocesses. Again, there is mixed empirical evidence for the\nconditional effects (Hypotheses 3 and 4). The patterns in\nWestern Europe corresponded to findings from earlier stud-\nies (Golder 2010): uncertainty (i.e., post-election status)\nincreases the time it takes to form a government, but this\neffect is strongest in complex bargaining situations\n(Hypothesis 3). Vice versa, increasing complexity has little\nor no effect in inter-election periods (grey bars) when\nuncertainty is low. It is only in post-election bargaining\nsituations (black bars) that increasing complexity leads to\nlonger bargaining duration (Hypothesis 4). However, in the\nnewly collected data for Central and Eastern Europe there\nis no consistent evidence for the conditional effect of uncer-\ntainty and complexity. Uncertainty increases bargaining\nduration, but this effect is similar in bargaining situations of\nFurthermore, complexity has almost no effect on bargain-\ning duration. Even in high uncertainty contexts (black\nbars), the difference in the average bargaining duration for\nless (40 days) and more complex bargaining situations (46\ndays) is small in absolute terms and much smaller than the\ndifference in Western Europe.\nFigure 2. Average bargaining duration for low and high levels of uncertainty and complexity.\nNote: This figure shows the average bargaining duration in days for bargaining situations in Western and Central and Eastern Europe. The left panel\nfurther differentiates between low uncertainty (inter-election; grey bars) and high uncertainty (post-election; black bars) bargaining situations. The\nright panel further differentiates between low complexity (effective number of parties below mean; grey bars) and high complexity (effective number\nof parties at or above mean; grey bars) bargaining situations.\nEcker and Meyer 5\nThe same empirical patterns emerge from a multivariate\nanalysis. Table 1 shows the results of a series of Cox pro-\nportional-hazard models using delays in government for-\nmation as the dependent variable. Models 1 and 3 include\nmeasures of uncertainty and complexity, thus testing\nHypothesis 1 and 2 in the context of Western Europe and of\nCEE separately. Models 2 and 4 then allow the effect of\ncomplexity to vary with the observed level of bargaining\nuncertainty, thus testing Hypotheses 3 and 4 again sepa-\nrately in Western Europe and in CEE. Both a global\nGrambsch and Therneau (1994) test and a visual inspection\nof the Schoenfeld residuals indicate that some models vio-\nlate the proportional hazard assumption. The corresponding\np-values of the global tests are displayed at the bottom of\nTable 1. We test each covariate separately to identify the\noffending covariate and account for their time-varying\neffect by including interactions with the natural logarithm\nof analysis-time. All empirical results are robust to these\nalternative model specifications.7\nCorroborating Hypothesis 1, the empirical results of\nModels 1 and 3 indicate that post-election status signifi-\ncantly and substantially delays the conclusion of coalition\nbargaining both in Western Europe and in CEE. Yet, the\neffect is weaker in the latter sample. The substantial effect of\npost-election status is estimated via exponentiated coeffi-\ncients (hazard ratios). In post-election contexts the risk of\ngovernment formation is approximately 81% lower in\nWestern Europe when compared with negotiations between\nelections, while the effect is only 59% in CEE. However,\nModels 1 and 3 provide no coherent empirical evidence on\nthe effect of complexity on delays in government formation\n(Hypothesis 2). In line with previous research and the bivar-\niate analysis in Figure 2 we find a significant negative effect\nof the effective number of parties in Western Europe. This\neffect is not robust to alternative model specifications (see\nEndnotes 3 and 6), however. Furthermore, the coefficient\nfor party system polarization is close to zero and does not\nreach conventional levels of statistical significance. This\nholds for government formation processes in Western\nEurope (Model 1) and in Central and Eastern Europe\n(Model 3) alike.\nEqually, Models 2 and 4 provide support for the condi-\ntional effects of complexity and uncertainty only in Western\nEurope, but not in CEE (Hypotheses 3 and 4). Moreover,\nthis moderating effect is only significant for the effective\nnumber of parties, while we find no such effect for party\nsystem polarization. Figures 4 and 5 visualize the corre-\nsponding marginal effects. Figure 4 shows the marginal\neffect of uncertainty (post-election status) for different lev-\nels of complexity (Hypothesis 3). The results using data\nfrom Western Europe (left panel) show that uncertainty\nreduces the risk to end the government formation process,\nbut this effect is strongest in complex bargaining situations.\nIn contrast, the data from Central and Eastern Europe (right\npanel) provide no support for a conditional effect: uncer-\ntainty reduce the risk of terminating the government forma-\ntion process, but this effect is independent of the level of\ncomplexity.\nThe left panel in Figure 5 shows the marginal effect of\nthe effective number of parties on bargaining duration\ncontingent on post-election status for government forma-\ntion processes in Western Europe (Hypothesis 4).8 In low\nFigure 3.

In contrast, in high uncer-\ntainty settings (i.e., after legislative elections) each addi-\ntional (effective) parliamentary party is associated with a\n22% decrease in the hazard of finalizing coalition negotia-\ntions in Western Europe. There is no such moderating\neffect of bargaining uncertainty for formation processes in\nCEE (right panel in Figure 5). As indicated in the above\nbivariate analysis, the data thus supported Hypothesis 4\nonly in Western European, but not in Central and Eastern\nEuropean democracies.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThis article explores government formation processes in\nWestern and in Central and Eastern Europe. Using a new\ndata set we show that bargaining delays in Central and\nEastern Europe are on average as long as those in Western\nEurope. Thus, in contrast to other phenomena such as gov-\nernment duration (e.g. Somer-Topcu and Williams, 2008),\nparty systems in Western and Central and Eastern Europe\nare somewhat similar with respect to the duration of gov-\nernment formation processes.\nAnother important finding from this analysis is that\nexisting theoretical approaches explaining delays in gov-\nernment formation cannot fully account for the empirical\npatterns observed in CEE. The perhaps most important\ncausal factor to explain the duration of formation processes\n\u00ad whether the formation process takes place in the after-\nmath of parliamentary elections \u00ad seems to play a less\ndecisive role in CEE. Moreover, the complexity of the bar-\ngaining situation has no direct or conditional effect on bar-\ngaining delays.\nWhat are the implications of these findings for future\nresearch on government formation processes? There are at\nleast two ways to respond to this question: one could chal-\nlenge the underlying theoretical model or its empirical\nimplementation. According to the former argument, uncer-\ntainty and complexity of the bargaining situation are insuf-\nficient to account for the variation in the duration of\ngovernment formation processes. Even the finding that\ngovernment formation takes longer in post-election con-\ntexts (Hypothesis 1) is vulnerable to alternative explana-\ntions. For example, Laver and Benoit (2015) note that the\nmeasure is somewhat endogenous because legislators\nbringing down a government between elections may do so\nhaving a preferred alternative already in mind.\nAnother line of reasoning would attribute non-findings\nto the empirical implementation of the theoretical models.\nFor example, we find no evidence that ideological polariza-\ntion affects the duration of government formation pro-\ncesses. While this non-finding is in line with the work of\nDiermeier and van Roozendaal (1998), it contrasts with\nprevious research identifying a link between ideological\ndispersion and bargaining duration (Golder, 2010; Martin\nFigure 5. Marginal effect of complexity conditional on uncertainty (Hypothesis 4).\nNote: This figure shows the estimated marginal effect of the effective number of parties on the risk of concluding coalition talks, conditional on post-\nelection status. The vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals around the median estimate from 1,000 draws using parameter and covariance\nestimates obtained from Models 2 and 4, respectively.\n8 Research and Politics \nand Vanberg, 2003). We can only speculate about the rea-\nsons for these differences. They may be due to case selec-\ntion or different measurement approaches. For instance,\nthere are several polarization indices, and inferences on\nideological polarization are often sensitive to the chosen\npolarization index (Best and Dow, 2015). Moreover, some\nscholars rely on party manifestos to measure party policy\npositions, while others use expert judgments.\nMore generally, both uncertainty and complexity are\nsomewhat complex concepts that are captured using rather\ncrude proxy measures. For example, the post-election\ndichotomy is a proxy measure suggesting that the bargain-\ning structure in inter-election periods is relatively stable.\nHowever,incontextsofhighturnoveroftheelite(Gherghina,\nbility and frequent party switching (Kreuzer and Pettai,\ntion is actually not met (see also Curini and Pinto, 2014).\nSimilarly, the existence of communist successor parties\n(Druckman and Roberts, 2007) and the relatively high num-\nrender standard measures of complexity rather inefficient.\nMore elaborated indicators for uncertainty and complex-\nity would also differ across coalition alternatives. While cur-\nrent indicators vary across government formation processes,\nwe can shift perspectives to analyse individual bargaining\nattempts that include a particular set of parties (Diermeier\nand van Roozendaal, 1998). Factors such as ideological con-\nflict, the number of bargaining parties, and elite turnover are\ncaptured more adequately at this lower level of analysis. For\ninstance, parliamentary elections may result in substantial\nturnover of the elite at the level of the party-system, indicat-\ning high levels of bargaining uncertainty. At the same time,\nhowever, the parties actually involved in coalition bargaining\nmay be those which did not experience any change in party\nleadership (because they are less likely to have incurred sub-\nstantial electoral losses). We believe that this shift in perspec-\ntives is a promising avenue for future research on government\nformation processes.\n"
