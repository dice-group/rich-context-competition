An\nadditional 9.7% had URR TSH, representing 20.6 million Americans,\nwho would also be identified as SCH if the upper TSH limit were\ndecreased. Many with URR TSH do not have thyroid disease.\nIntervention: The time of phlebotomy is important, because the TSH\nlevel varies throughout the day, with early morning values greater\nthan later ones, and is accentuated by sleep deprivation, strenuous\nexercise, or working during the night or evening shifts. Repeated\nmeasurements in the same individual vary considerably over months.\nResults: About half of those with URR TSH probably have thyroid\ndisease, but most with thyroid disease, antithyroid peroxidase anti-\nbodies, have TSH below 2.5 mIU/liter. Those with URR TSH with\nthyroid disease probably have minimal thyroid deficiency, without\nany reported adverse health consequences or benefit of treatments\nwith levothyroxine.\nConclusion: Because routine levothyroxine treatment is not recom-\nmended for SCH, it is certainly not warranted in individuals with\nURR TSH. For all patients with URR TSH, it is reasonable to deter-\nmine serum TSH every 1\u00ad2 yr. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 90:\nPRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM IS one of the most com-\nmon endocrine disorders, affecting many millions\naround the world. Although experienced clinicians may sus-\npect severe hypothyroidism, more often the symptoms and\nsigns of this disease are subtle and neither sensitive nor\nspecific for the disorder. Therefore, the diagnosis of hypo-\nthyroidism requires measurement of serum TSH in conjunc-\ntion with the serum free T4\nconcentration (1). The inverse\nlogarithmic relationship between free T4\nand TSH means that\nsmall changes in the serum free T4\nconcentration can, in turn,\nlead to much more dramatic changes in serum TSH.\nHypothyroidism ranges from mild to severe. Overt pri-\nmary hypothyroidism is characterized by decreased serum\nand increased serum TSH levels. The term subclinical\nhypothyroidism (SCH), also called mild hypothyroidism,\nrefers to a laboratory abnormality characterized by an ele-\nvated serum TSH with a normal free T4\nconcentration (2\u00ad4).\nPatients with these findings may or may not be symptomatic.\nOther causes of elevated serum TSH should be excluded.\nThere is a continuum between the euthyroid state and hy-\npothyroidism, as there is between normal and elevated se-\nrum TSH concentrations. Therefore, the distinction between\na normal and an elevated serum TSH level is somewhat\narbitrary. However, it has been used to distinguish individ-\nuals with normal thyroid function, who may or may not have\nunderlying thyroid pathology, from those with SCH. In cur-\nrent assays, the upper limit of the TSH reference range is\napproximately 4.5 mIU/liter (5).\nIn 2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinol-\nogists issued a statement encouraging \"doctors to consider\ntreatment for patients who test out of the boundaries of a\nnarrower margin based on a target TSH level of 0.3\u00ad3.0\nmIU/liter (6). Respected authorities have echoed this rec-\nommendation and even suggested that the range be further\ncontracted to an upper limit of normal of 2.5 mIU/liter (7\u00ad\n11). However, decreasing the upper limits of normal for\nserum TSH may have enormous health and economic im-\nplications and should not be undertaken without extensive\ndiscussion and consideration. Comprehensive analyses, dis-\ncussions, and debate preceded changes in criteria for diag-\nnosing diabetes mellitus (12), hypertension (13), and hyper-\ncholesterolemia (14). In each of these instances the guiding\nprinciple for change was the firm knowledge that interven-\ntions employing these guidelines would have important\nhealth benefits that outweigh potential risks. Such data are\nAbbreviations: DF-RF, Disease-free without risk factors; SCH, sub-\nclinical hypothyroidism; TPO, thyroid peroxidase; URR, upper reference\nrange.\nJCEM is published monthly by The Endocrine Society (http://www.\nendo-society.org), the foremost professional society serving the en-\ndocrine community.\nPrinted in U.S.A.

Therefore, we do not support a lowering of the upper\nlimit of the normal range for serum TSH at this time and\ndetail our reasons in the following discussion.\nNormal Range for Serum TSH\nThe normal or reference range for any parameter should\nprovide a framework for physicians to categorize patients as\n1) normal, 2) those who may require closer observation or\nintervention to detect and then treat a specific adverse health\noutcome, and 3), those with disease who might benefit from\ntreatment. For example, using glucose tolerance testing, in-\ndividuals are characterized as normal, prediabetic, or dia-\nbetic (12); for blood pressure measurements, normal, prehy-\npertensive, and hypertensive populations have been defined\n(13). Health interventions (usually lifestyle) are indicated in\nthe intermediate groups.\nDefining a normal range for serum TSH implies that any-\none outside of this range must be abnormal and, by inference,\nis a candidate for therapy. Several important questions must\nbe considered when defining a normal range for serum TSH.\n1) What is the distribution of TSH measurements in the\npopulation? 2) What is the reliability and reproducibility of\na given TSH measurement within and between assays? 3)\nWhat is the stability of the measurement? Does it vary over\nthe course of the day and from day to day? 4) Is a serum TSH\nconcentration between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter highly sensitive\nand specific for thyroid disease? 5) What is the natural his-\ntory of a person with a serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5\nmIU/liter? Does it inevitably rise to levels seen in overt\nhypothyroidism or may it return to normal? 6) What are the\nrisks and benefits of levothyroxine treatment in individuals\nwith serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter? 7) What are\nthe consequences of narrowing the TSH normal range?\nTSH Distribution\nNHANES III (5) provides data on the distribution of TSH,\nthyroid hormones, and antithyroid antibodies in 17,353 peo-\nple (total population) that represent the weighted racial dis-\nyr and designed to represent the United States population.\nIndividuals who reported thyroid disease, goiter, or taking\nthyroid medication (820 people) were excluded from the total\npopulation, leaving 16,533 people classified as the disease-\nfree population. A third group of 13,334 people (the reference\npopulation) further excluded people who had antithyroid\nantibodies; were pregnant, were taking estrogens, andro-\ngens, or lithium; and were without laboratory evidence of\novert hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Free T4\nwas not\nmeasured in this study. Because people who are pregnant, or\ntreated with estrogen or androgen (1,000 in NHANES III)1\ndo not have significant serum TSH elevations, their exclusion\nmakes the reference population less than optimal for deter-\nmination of TSH distribution in a population without thyroid\ndisease or risk factors (possibly excluding family history) for\nthyroid disease.\nThe disease-free group represents most patients who are\nevaluated for hypothyroidism, because clinicians generally\ndo not measure anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibod-\nies before measurement of TSH. Thus, the disease-free pop-\nulation is most appropriate for assessment of the range of\nTSH that is relevant to doctors in practice. We, therefore,\npresent analysis of the distribution of TSH in this population.\nWe also present data for a new subgroup from NHANES III\nwithout risk factors for thyroid dysfunction [disease-free\nwithout risk factors (DF-RF)]. For the latter group, we ob-\ntained unpublished population data for the disease-free pop-\nulation, excluding only the subjects with antithyroid anti-\nbodies, those taking lithium, or the few discovered\nbiochemically to have overt hyperthyroidism or hypothy-\nroidism (see Footnote 1). This new group represents a pop-\nulation without self-reported thyroid disease and no risk\nfactors for thyroid disease, except, possibly, a family history\nof thyroid disease.\nSimilar to the disease-free population, the non-log-trans-\nformed distribution of TSH values of this new group is sig-\nnificantly skewed toward higher TSH values (Fig. 1). When\nlog-transformed, the histogram is closer to a Gaussian curve,\nbut is still skewed toward higher TSH values (Fig. 2).

If the upper limit were further\nwould be considered hypothyroid.

Even in the\nreference population, which excludes thyroid antibody-pos-\nitive subjects as well as those who are pregnant or taking\nestrogens or androgens, a decrease in the upper limit of the\nTSH range to 2.5\u00ad3.0 mIU/liter would result in an approx-\nimately 3-fold increase in the number of people newly des-\nignated as hypothyroid (12 million). These projections are\nsupported by an analysis of TSH values in patients without\na history of thyroid disease in a tertiary care practice (15).\nDecreasing the upper limit of the TSH reference range to 3.0\nmIU/liter resulted in more than a 4-fold increase in patients\nclassified as hypothyroid.\nSome of those who suggest that the upper limit of the TSH\nrange should be 2.5 mIU/liter state that 95% of the subjects\nin the reference group (9) or rigorously screened normal\neuthyroid volunteers (8) had TSH levels between 0.5 and 2.5\nmIU/liter. We cannot find support for these statements in the\nNHANES III database. Unpublished data from NHANES III\n(see Footnote 1) indicate that only 81.5% of the disease-free\ngroup had TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/liter (Table 1).\nReproducibility of TSH Measurements\nTSH assay characteristics depend on the reagents, proto-\ncols, and technical performance of the assay. These were\ndefined and described previously (8). High-quality labora-\ntories should have intraassay variation of less than 5% for\nTSH in the range of 1.0\u00ad4.5 mIU/liter. Fewer data are avail-\nable concerning interassay variation in TSH concentration\nperformed on the same sample. Although it is somewhat\ngreater than the intraassay variation, interassay variation\nately calibrated assays, a single TSH determination should\nreasonably reflect the TSH concentration in that sample.\nStability of TSH over Time in the Same Individual\nThe reference range applies to populations, but clinicians\nmust apply the results of a single TSH determination to an\nindividual patient. It is particularly important for clinicians\nto know whether a single TSH measurement reflects the\nindividual's average TSH measurement over time. There-\nfore, the stability or variability of repetitive TSH determina-\ntions over short periods of time is critically important.\nAlthough such measurements are not performed in clin-\nical practice, several studies provide data showing signifi-\ncant variation in repeated TSH measurements over time in\nthe same individuals. Fish et al. (19) measured TSH 13 times\nwithin a 6-d interval in five patients taking the same daily\ndose of levothyroxine for at least 3 months. The initial serum\nTSH was normal for these patients. Considerable variation\nwas found when TSH was measured repeatedly, with four\nof the five patients having at least one TSH value move out\nof the normal range. Others have made similar observations\nTSH in 16 healthy men monthly for 1 yr. Each man seemed\nto have a specific and unique set point for thyroid hormone\nconcentrations. TSH measurements in any individual varied\nwithin 50% of the TSH distribution of the entire group's\nsamples. The variation in serum TSH concentration in re-\npeated samples from the same individual was large and\nclinically significant. For example, with a mean TSH of 1.4\nmIU/liter, repeated measurements in the same subject could\nFIG. 2. When log-transformed, the histogram is closer to a Gaussian\ncurve, but is still skewed toward higher TSH values.\nTABLE 1.

The Disease Free  Risk Free population is the disease-free population\nminus those with anti-TPO antibodies, treated with lithium or found to have hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. The last column (Combined)\nprovides the sum of the smaller intervals between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter.\nmIU/liter, the variation could be between 1.2 and 3.6 mIU/\nliter; and for TSH of 3.6 mIU/liter, the variation could be\nbetween 1.8 and 5.4 mIU/liter. Even with a mean normal\nTSH of 1.7\u00ad2.4 mIU/liter, some repeated TSH measurements\nwould be expected to exceed the newly proposed upper\nvalues could classify patients incorrectly as abnormal, al-\nthough the mean concentration over time is quite normal.\nThe time of phlebotomy is also important. In a clinical\ntients was significantly higher in 97 of 100 consecutive in-\nas having SCH based on the fasting sample, eight were re-\nclassified as normal (TSH, 4.5 mIU/liter) based on the late\nmorning sample. Ten of 15 individuals with fasting early\nmorning TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mU/liter had a late morn-\ning nonfasting TSH level below 3.0 mU/liter.2 Without ad-\ndressing the etiology of the TSH variation, this study does\nconfirm that the time of day of blood TSH sampling may\ninfluence the serum TSH concentration, resulting in misclas-\nsification as either abnormal or normal. The more narrow the\nreference range, the more likely that such misclassification\nwill occur.\nA nocturnal surge in serum TSH is well recognized. Serum\nTSH approximately doubles near bedtime and begins to de-\ncrease to lower values at the time of sleep (24\u00ad27). The\ndecline in serum TSH concentration may not be complete at\n0800 h, when blood sampling generally begins, resulting in\na higher serum TSH than at later times during the day. Mean\nmIU/liter in five healthy subjects without thyroid disease\nAverage TSH deceased 20\u00ad32% in one or more subsequent\n2-h intervals in every subject.3 This effect is amplified after\nsleep deprivation (28, 29) and exercise (30). Furthermore, the\npeak in pulsatile TSH secretion occurs in the morning hours\nin night-shift workers and also may be variable and delayed\nh (31). The night-shift and evening-shift workers whose\nh would have higher TSH concentrations than their 24-h\nmean levels, and some could fall into the 3.0\u00ad4.5 mIU/liter\nrange. In large numbers of subjects whose time of sleep is\noccur at their bedtime peak TSH. In the United States, 3\nmillion people work during the conventional night shift, and\nmillion people, 5% of the U.S. workforce over age 16 yr,\nwould probably have their phlebotomy at a time when serum\nTSH is at or near its highest level of the day. Results based\non that determination might result in misclassification.\nSpecificity of TSH between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/liter\nfor Hypothyroidism\nBefore making any clinical decisions based on a single\nserum TSH determination between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter,\nTSH determination should be repeated within several weeks\nto several months to exclude transient thyroid dysfunction or\nother disorders (2, 3). Common causes of transient TSH el-\nevations in a disease-free group include subacute, lympho-\ncytic, or postpartum thyroiditis and recovery from a non-\nthyroidal illness (2).\nThe presence of anti-TPO antibodies is prima facie evidence\nof autoimmune thyroid disease and predicts an increased\nrisk for development of SCH or overt hypothyroidism when\nserum TSH is greater than 2.0 mIU/liter (33). However,\nmany TPO antibody-positive individuals never develop\novert or subclinical hypothyroidism. We concede that many\npatients with serum TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mU/liter have\nanti-TPO antibodies and may have the very earliest stage of\nsubclinical hypothyroidism. However, among the 1719 in-\ndividuals in the disease-free population who had anti-TPO\nantibodies, 62.2% of them had serum TSH below 3.0 mIU/\nliter (5) (see Footnote 1). Therefore, autoimmune thyroid\ndisease and thyroid dysfunction are not synonymous.\nnote 1). Overall only 22.2% of those subjects with TSH be-\ntween 3.0 and 4.49 mIU/liter in the disease-free group had\nanti-TPO antibodies, whereas 77.8% did not. It is possible\nthat the true number of antibody-positive individuals was\nunderestimated in the NHANES III study, because the assays\nwere less sensitive than currently available tests. However,\neven if the prevalence of anti-TPO antibodies were doubled,\nthe positive predictive value for autoimmune thyroid disease\nwith a TSH level between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter would still\nbe less than 0.5. More than 50% of individuals within this\nTSH range would be anti-TPO antibody negative and mis-\nlabeled as having thyroid disease or hypothyroidism. In con-\nmIU/liter had TPO antibodies. Because 77.8% of the disease-\nfree population whose serum TSH was between 3.0 and 4.49\nmIU/liter did not have antithyroid antibodies, they would\nprobably not be at significant risk for hypothyroidism.\nGiven the inverse log-linear relationship between free T4\nand serum TSH, the TSH response to even minor thyroid\nhormone changes is markedly amplified (17). It is therefore\npossible that some individuals with serum TSH near the\nreference TSH median value (1.4 mU/liter) may have min-\nimal thyroid dysfunction, because this value may represent\na small deviation from their own set point. A logical corollary\nis that some individuals whose TSH is in the upper portion\nof the reference range may not have thyroid disease, but may\nactually be at their set points. Some recognized causes of\nmildly elevated serum TSH concentrations in euthyroid in-\ndividuals are circulating TSH variants of decreased biolog-\nSpurious TSH elevations due to assay interference can also\noccur with circulating heterophilic antibodies (38\u00ad40) or\n2 Unpublished data from Ref. 23 kindly provided by Ronald R.\nScobbo and Thomas W. vonDohlen.\n3 Unpublished data on TSH circadian rhythms kindly provided by\nMary Samuels.\nNatural History and Consequences of Serum TSH\nThe potential consequences of a serum TSH in the range\nof 4.5\u00ad10 mIU/liter will be reviewed briefly to provide con-\ntext for the range of 3.0\u00ad4.5 mIU/liter. For individuals with\na serum TSH of 5\u00ad10 mIU/liter, there is an increased risk of\nprogression to overt hypothyroidism. The risk (33) is esti-\nmated to be 2.6%/yr in the absence of anti-TPO antibodies\nand 4.3%/yr in their presence. After 20 yr, hypothyroidism\ndeveloped in 33% of patients with mildly raised TSH and in\n55% of similar patients who also had antithyroid antibodies\n(33). Comparable results were reported in a study of patients\nwith elevated serum TSH levels after treatment with radio-\nactive iodine or thyroidectomy (43). Over a mean 9.2-yr in-\nterval, overt hypothyroidism developed in 42.8% of those\nwith initial TSH levels greater than 6\u00ad12 mIU/liter, but in\nnone of the patients with initial TSH levels between 4 and 6\nmIU/liter.\nNot all individuals with SCH progress to overt hypothy-\nroidism or even continue to have SCH. In one study of SCH\nin individuals over age 55 yr, serum TSH returned to normal\nTSH returned to normal in 61% of antibody-negative indi-\nviduals and in 30% of those with positive antithyroid anti-\nbodies. Of patients over the age of 60yr with TSH between\n5 and 10 mIU/liter, serum TSH was normal 12 months later\nin 4% of antibody-positive individuals and 11% of those\nwithout antithyroid antibodies (45). In a recent report, 11 of\n21 octogenarians with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH,\n4.7 mIU/liter) had normal thyroid function 3 yr later (46).\nThus, in treating individuals in an attempt to prevent hy-\npothyroidism, many patients who would spontaneously re-\nturn to normal would be inappropriately treated.\nLimited natural history data are available for individuals\nwith serum TSH between 2.5 and 5.0 mIU/liter. We obtained\nunpublished data for rates of progression to overt hypo-\nthyroidism for such patients from the Whickham study.4\nTable 2 shows the 20-yr risk of developing hypothyroidism\nin women within TSH levels from 1\u00ad5 mIU/liter in the pres-\nence and absence of antithyroid antibodies. When serum\nof age, the probability of developing hypothyroidism in 20\n20-yr probability increased to 5\u00ad15%. When antithyroid anti-\nbodies were present as well, the 20-yr prevalence increased to\ngroup. Therefore, even in older patients, who have increased\nprobability of having SCH (2), the probability of developing\nhypothyroidism during their life expectancy is 25\u00ad50%, and\nnormalization of TSH over time is common (44\u00ad46).\nOther adverse health consequences have not been con-\nfirmed for individuals with serum TSH between 5 and 10\nmIU/liter (2). An increased risk for development of athero-\nsclerotic heart disease in SCH has been suggested by a cross-\nsectional study that did not stratify serum TSH (47). No\nprogression of atherosclerosis was found in the longitudinal\ncomponent of this study. Another study (48) did not confirm\nan increased risk for atherosclerotic heart disease. Several\nstudies of surrogate markers for heart disease suggest a pos-\nsible increased risk for coronary heart disease in SCH (49\u00ad\n52); other studies did not confirm significant abnormalities\nsurrogate markers to predict outcome is fraught with hazard,\nas was made painfully clear with recent data suggesting\nincreased risk for coronary disease with estrogens when\nmost surrogate studies pointed to a decreased risk. It is\ntherefore critically important to study the incidence of cor-\nonary heart disease and mortality over time to properly\nassess cardiovascular risk. Five prospective cohort datasets\nare available for analysis. One 10-yr study showed an in-\ncrease in cardiovascular mortality only in yr 4\u00ad6 in men with\nSCH, but no increase in women (56). Three studies with 4.6,\n10, and 20 yr of observation did not show an increase in\nadverse cardiac health outcomes when TSH was elevated (47,\n57, 58). One study in octogenarians demonstrated increased\nsurvival in patients with untreated hypothyroidism and SCH\n(46). Although designed specifically to observe individuals\nwith low serum TSH, a 10-yr cohort study of individuals over\nthe age of 60 yr did not show an increase in mortality in those\nwith serum TSH over 5 mIU/liter; a nonsignificant trend\ntoward decreased mortality was found (46). No data are\navailable for incident atherosclerotic heart disease or mor-\ntality in patients with TSH in the range of 3.0\u00ad4.5 mIU/liter.\nHowever, it seems logical to conclude that the consequences\nof TSH in this range would be even less than that for those\nBenefits and Risks of Levothyroxine Treatment in\nThere is no compelling evidence that treatment with levo-\nthyroxine improves symptoms compared with placebo in\nTreatment of subclinical hypothyroidism when serum TSH\nis between 5 and 10 mIU/liter generally does not have a\nbeneficial effect on serum lipid profiles (60). The only doc-\numented adverse health outcome for individuals with TSH\nlevels between 3.0 and 5.0 mU/liter is progression to overt\nhypothyroidism. Levothyroxine treatment would clearly\nprevent that outcome, but at what price? As noted above,\n4 Unpublished data from the 20-yr follow-up of the Whickham study\n(31) kindly provided by Mark P. Vanderpump and Joyce M. French.\nTABLE 2.

Furthermore, levothyroxine ther-\napy is often not optimally controlled and may not be innoc-\nuous. Individuals in the community who take levothyroxine\nfeel less well than controls who do not (62). Although the\nexplanation for this requires additional study, the observa-\ntion is robust.\nTwenty percent of levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid pa-\ntients are undertreated, with TSH concentrations greater\nthan 5.0 mIU/liter. Twenty-one percent of levothyroxine-\ntreated patients are overtreated, causing subclinical hyper-\nthyroidism with serum TSH below 0.4 mIU/liter. Only about\n60% of levothyroxine-treated patients have serum TSH in the\ntarget range (5, 63). These less than optimal results of levo-\nthyroxine treatment may be due in part to its narrow ther-\napeutic range (64). Thus, small changes in absorption may\nresult in subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyper-\nthyroidism. Although undertreatment results only in lack of\nfull benefit of the drug in those who need it, overtreatment\nmay be associated with adverse health outcomes. Patients\nwith subclinical hyperthyroidism (particularly the elderly)\nhave a 3- to 6-fold increased risk for atrial fibrillation (65, 66).\nWoman with subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly those\nwho are estrogen deficient, suffer an increased rate of loss of\nbone mineral and fracture (67, 68). Subclinical hyperthyroid-\nism in the elderly has also been associated with increased risk\nof all cause as well as cardiovascular mortality (57). Current\ncreased risk for these adverse outcomes of levothyroxine\ntreatment (69). The recent evidence that subclinical hypo-\nthyroidism in the very old decreases mortality cannot be\nignored, but cannot yet be extrapolated to other age groups.\nSome might suggest that educating physicians could sub-\nstantially reduce these risks. However, experience teaches us\nthat practice patterns are very difficult to change. For exam-\nple, a recommendation not to employ the T3\nresin uptake test\nwas made many years ago (70), but the test is still in wide use.\nIt is often interpreted incorrectly, leading to increased costs\nof additional unnecessary testing and referral, and anxiety\nfor the patient and family.\nConsequences of Narrowing the TSH Normal Range\nIn the disease-free group, 4.3% (representing 8.4 million\npeople) had subclinical or overt hypothyroidism (TSH, 4.49\nmIU/liter; Table 1). Decreasing the upper limit of the refer-\nence range to 3.0 mIU/liter results in characterizing an ad-\nditional 7.9% of the population (15.4 million subjects) as\nhypothyroid. Even when all risk factors are removed from\nconsideration (disease-free minus risk factors), 2.3% (3.9 mil-\nlion subjects) had subclinical hypothyroidism (Table 1); us-\ning a suggested revised upper limit of 3.0 mIU/liter, an\nadditional 6.4% of the population (10.8 million subjects)\nwould be considered hypothyroid. Thus, decreasing the up-\nper limit of the normal range to 3.0 mIU/liter would mark-\nedly increase the number of individuals identified as hypo-\nthyroid. Although labeling a patient with a TSH of 3.1 mIU/\nliter as hypothyroid would not necessitate therapy, in\npractice many or most nonspecialist clinicians and many\nspecialists are inclined to treat abnormal laboratory tests. The\nlow positive predictive value for thyroid disease of a TSH\nlevel between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter, the absence of demon-\nstrated benefit with therapy, and the potential for harm with\ntherapy lead us to conclude that changing the normal TSH\nrange at this time is premature, unjustified, and unwise.\nConclusion\nWe conclude from the data at hand that the generally\naccepted reference range for serum TSH, 0.40\u00ad4.2 mIU/liter\n(5), should also be considered the normal range, because the\nTSH range must 1) have clinical utility, 2) not result in in-\nappropriate labeling of normal individuals as having SCH,\n3) not result in unnecessary T4\ntreatment and potential ad-\nverse effects of treatment, and 4) must predict a high like-\nlihood of potential benefit with therapy. We concede that\nsome individuals with TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter\nhave the very earliest stage of hypothyroidism, but at the\npresent time, appropriate follow-up is the most prudent way\nto manage these patients.\nRecommendations\n1) If serum TSH is between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter, the\ndetermination should be repeated within several weeks to\nmonths, depending on the clinical circumstances. 2) When\nTSH remains in this range on repeated testing, the patient\nshould be carefully examined for an abnormal thyroid gland.\nA family history and history of previous treatment for thy-\nroid dysfunction should be obtained. These data help define\nthe risk of developing subclinical or overt hypothyroidism\nover the long term. 3) Determination of anti-TPO antibodies\nmay be helpful in defining the risk of progression. However,\neven in their presence, the rate of progression is 25\u00ad50% over\n20 yr, depending on age. 4) With or without anti-TPO anti-\nbodies, patients with TSH between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter\ncould be considered at risk for hypothyroidism and should\nhave repeat TSH determination in 6 months to 1 yr, then, if\nunchanged, about once a year. 5) Other than avoiding clinical\nmanifestations of overt hypothyroidism in those who would\nhave progressive decline in thyroid function, current data do\nnot support routine levothyroxine treatment in patients with\nTSH between 5.0 and 10 mIU/liter. We do not, therefore,\nrecommend routine levothyroxine treatment of individuals\nwith TSH levels between 3.0 and 4.5 mIU/liter.\n"
