These so-called shadow banks operate\noutside the perimeter of traditional banking regulation and the public financial safety\nnet, even though they are typically created and operated by regulated financial insti-\ntutions.1 A key feature in shadow banks' design is the provision of credit guarantees\nor liquidity lines by their sponsoring institutions. Such sponsor support is intended to\nlower individual shadow banks' susceptibility to investor runs by shielding them from\ndeteriorations in market liquidity conditions. In particular, liquidity lines \u00ad by providing\nshadow banks facing sudden funding withdrawals with a contingent liquidity source \u00ad\nmay help them avoid losses that would otherwise accrue from selling assets at discounted\nprices.2 The present paper challenges this view by arguing that the provision of such\nliquidity support can, in fact, be detrimental to aggregate market and funding liquidity\nconditions. We show this by developing a theory of asset market freezes and investor\nruns based on shadow banks' ability to acquire private information about their assets.\nContrary to the conventional view outlined above, we argue that market liquidity\nconditions are not independent of shadow banks' choice of liquidity sources since this\nchoice depends on the quality of assets on their balance sheets. Building on Akerlof\n(1970)'s key insight that asymmetric information can impede trade, we show that access\nto pre-committed liquidity lines gives shadow banks an incentive to acquire private\ninformation about their assets in order to avoid selling good assets at a discount. This\ncan lead to market freezes spurred by endogenous adverse selection which may, in turn,\nprecipitate panic-driven investor runs. In general, our model shows that agents' access to\n\"informationally insensitive\" liquidity sources (whose costs are unaffected by the agents'\nprivate information) can lead liquidity to dry-up in competitive asset markets that would\notherwise be immune to information-related trading frictions. Thus, rather than making\nthe shadow banking sector safer, the presence of liquidity lines may in fact be a source\nof financial fragility by opening the door to market and funding liquidity dry-ups driven\nby self-fulfilling fears of adverse selection in asset markets.\nOverview of the Model. Our results are based on a three-date model with three\ntypes of risk-neutral agents: shadow banks (e.g. off-balance sheet conduits or mutual\nfunds), wholesale investors, and deep-pocketed asset market traders. Shadow banks\n(henceforth referred to as \"funds\" for short) enter the economy with long-term assets,\npartly financed by redeemable liabilities. These liabilities are held by wholesale investors\nthat can choose to redeem them before funds' long-term assets mature. Funds' assets\ndiffer in terms of their payoff at maturity: some pay out a large cash flow (good type),\n1See Pozsar, Adrian, Ashcraft, and Boesky (2010) for an overview. A large variety of different types\nof non-bank financial institutions can be subsumed under the term `shadow banks', ranging from money\nmarket funds and other open-ended mutual funds that provide funding to off\u00adbalance sheet vehicles like\nSIVs, ABCP conduits or hedge funds.\n2See Brady, Anadu, and Cooper (2012) for a discussion of various cases of sponsor support during\nFigure 1: Model Mechanism\nInfo Acquisition\nSelf-Confirming\nEarly\nRedemptions\nAdverse Selection\nUse Liquidity Line\nif Assets are Good\nLow Asset Prices\nLow Value of Resi-\ndual Claims\nwhile others pay out a small cash flow (bad type). Although funds initially do not know\ntheir assets' type, they can expend resources to privately learn the type. To obtain the\nliquidity needed to meet short-term redemptions, funds can then either sell assets in\na competitive secondary market or tap a costly liquidity line provided by an (outside)\nsponsoring institution.3\nThe value of information in this environment stems from funds' ability to hold on to\ngood assets by resorting to their liquidity lines rather than selling them at a discount.4\nInformation acquisition by funds also generates an externality, as it induces an adverse\nselection problem in secondary markets that impedes the provision of market liquidity\n(i.e. lowers asset prices). This leads to a feedback from market prices to information\nacquisition, as lower prices reduce funds' opportunity costs of using their liquidity lines\nin case they have good assets.\nThe key contribution of our paper is to show that this feedback can generate self-\nfulfilling market liquidity dry-ups. To illustrate the underlying mechanism, suppose a\nfund faces redemptions and believes that other funds have acquired information (cf. the\nsolid lines of Figure 1). If informed funds with good assets opt to finance redemptions\nusing their liquidity lines, the relative share of bad assets in the secondary market in-\ncreases and asset prices fall. This \"lemons discount\" raises the value from witholding\ngood assets from the market and, a fortiori, the gain from acquiring information. The\nmere belief that others acquire information thus increases the private surplus from infor-\nmation acquisition, spurring self-fulfilling market freezes driven by endogenous adverse\nselection.\n3Off-balance sheet conduits and MMFs had extensive recourse to the balance sheets of their sponsors.\nThis included \"liquidity enhacements,\" or private liquidity lines through which sponsoring institutions\ncould repurchase performing assets if conduits failed to roll over maturing liabilities.\n4As in Hirshleifer (1971), information acquisition has no social value in our model as its only serves\nto redistribute rents across funds.\nThis information-induced dry-up in market liquidity can also raise investors' incen-\ntives to redeem their claims early and amplify funds' funding liquidity risk. Funds that\nsell assets in order to meet early redemptions have to sell increasingly large quantities\nas prices fall. Early redemptions in this case dilute the claims held by investors at\nmaturity and may lead to self-fulfilling investor runs if asset prices are sufficiently low\n(cf. the dashed line in Figure 1). The increased funding risk then raises funds' incen-\ntives to acquire information, which further pushes down prices and sparks even more\nredemptions.\nImportantly, financial fragility in our model results from strategic complementari-\nties in funds' information acquisition decisions. In particular, the coordination problem\namong investors precipitating redemption runs only emerges if endogenous information\nacquisition by funds leads assets to trade at a discount in secondary markets. When\nsecondary markets are liquid, investors' claims at maturity are unaffected by the volume\nof early redemptions, and their redemption decisions are purely driven by their idiosyn-\ncratic liquidity shocks. This distinguishes our paper from standard bank run models `\na\nla Diamond and Dybvig (1983), where fragility stems from strategic complementarities\nin creditors' withdrawal decisions that arise due to the exogenous discount banks incur\nwhen assets are liquidated prematurely.\nThe strategic complementarities characterizing funds' information acquisition and\ninvestors' redemption decisions can lead to multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. Equilib-\nria without information acquisition are characterized by high secondary market prices\nand low funding risk. These equilibria Pareto-dominate equilibria with information ac-\nquisition that are characterized by low market prices and high funding liquidity risk.\nThe coordination failure leading funds to acquire information can therefore generate\nsignificant welfare losses due to inefficient liquidity dry-ups. In order to select a unique\nequilibrium and study the effects of different types of policy interventions, we employ\nglobal game techniques by adapting the methodology of Goldstein (2005). This is done\nby introducing a macroeconomic state that affects the riskiness of assets' cash flows.\nWe show that depending on the parameters of the model, two different regimes can\narise: a weak dependence and strong dependence regime. In the former, information\nacquisition by funds leads to a drop in asset prices that may spur panic-driven investor\nruns. However, no reverse feedback exists and market liquidity risk is unaffected by the\nvolume of early redemptions. In the latter regime, market and funding liquidity mutually\nreinforce each other. Market liquidity dry-ups in this case are always accompanied by\ninvestor runs, and funding liquidity risk \"spills over\" and raises funds' incentives to\nacquire information about their assets.\nFinally, we analyze a number of policy measures that can be used to mitigate these\ninefficient liquidity dry-ups. Inspired by measures adopted by central banks during\nthe 2007-09 financial crisis to shore up liquidity in securitized asset markets, we focus\non three specific policy interventions: asset purchases, outright debt purchases, and\nliquidity injections to funds' sponsoring institutions. First, asset purchases reduce both\nmarket and funding liquidity risk by lowering funds' information rents and boosting their\nresidual equity value at maturity. However, as this policy does not completely eliminate\nfunds' incentives to acquire information, it sometimes requires the policymaker to incur\nlosses. Second, the policymaker can implement the efficient allocation, and prevent both\ninefficient market freezes and investor runs, using outright debt purchases. In effect,\nby completely shielding funds from funding liquidity risk, debt purchases eliminate the\ncoordination failure leading funds to acquire information. Third, we show that liquidity\ninjections to sponsoring institutions may backfire. Insofar as this policy reduces sponsors'\nopportunity cost of providing liquidity lines, it may exacerbate the adverse selection\nproblem that causes market liquidity to dry up in the first place.\nRelation to the Literature. Our paper highlights the fragility of financial insti-\ntutions that heavily rely on market-based liquidity provision and sponsor support to\nmanage their funding risk. It relates to a recent literature studying the origins and con-\nsequences of sponsor support for off-balance sheet vehicles and shadow banks. Ordonez\n(2016) and Segura (2017) focus on the reputational and signaling effects of sponsors'\nsupport decisions. In contrast to their papers, our model highlights the fragility of the\nshadow banking sector that arises from the interaction between market and funding liq-\nuidity engendered by sponsors' support decisions. Similar to Parlatore (2016), our paper\nemphasizes the detrimental effects of strategic complementarities arising from the inter-\naction between support decisions and market prices. Complementarities in her model\narise because fire-sales by funds without support raise their default risk, thereby reduc-\ning sponsors' incentives to offer support and increasing the need to fire-sell assets. In our\nmodel, funds face complementarities in information acquisition because sponsor support\nallows them to retain good assets. on their balance sheet. This leads to endogenous ad-\nverse selection in asset markets and can induce a mutual amplification between market\nand funding risk.\nThe source of financial fragility in our paper makes it conceptually different from the\n\"classical\" bank run literature - e.g. Diamond and Dybvig (1983), Rochet and Vives\n(2004), and Goldstein and Pauzner (2005) - where, as mentioned above, banks' fragility\narises from the nature of demandable deposit contracts in the presence of exogenous\nliquidation discounts. Panic-driven runs only emerge in our framework because informa-\ntion acquisition leads asset prices to fall, thereby eroding the value of residual claims. In\nthis sense, our paper builds on the literature studying how adverse selection can lead to\nand Heider, Hoerova, and Holthausen (2015). However, contrary to these papers that\ntreat asymmetric information as a primitive, adverse selection frictions emerge endoge-\nnously in our model due to funds strategic information acquisition behavior. Bolton,\nSantos, and Scheinkman (2011) also study how liquidity crises unfold over time in the\npresence of exogenous asymmetric information. Similar to our model, a key motive for\nnot selling assets in their model is the option value from retaining good assets when\nasset prices are low due to adverse selection frictions. In contrast to our paper, they\ndo not explore the consequences of this motive for the emergence of endogenous adverse\nselection and abstract from the interaction between market and funding liquidity.\nOur paper also relates to a growing literature on information acquisition in finan-\ncial markets. Gorton and Ordonez (2014), building on Dang, Gorton, and Holmstr\u00a8\nom\n(2015), study how information acquisition amplifies aggregate shocks to collateral val-\nues. The value of information in their model corresponds to an information rent that\naccrues to creditors from liquidating bad collateral at a pooling price.5 Importantly,\nthe feedback between market prices and information acquisition implied by this infor-\nmation rent induces strategic substitutability (rather than strategic complementarity)\nin information production. Hence, the self-fulfilling liquidity dry-ups that are the focus\nof our paper cannot arise in Gorton and Ordonez (2014)'s framework. Other recent\npapers studying strategic complementarities in information acquisition include Fishman\nand Parker (2015) and Bolton, Santos, and Scheinkman (2016). The source of strategic\ncomplementarities is conceptually different from the one studied here, however, as it\noperates through the rents informed investors extract when buying (rather than selling)\nassets.6 These papers also do not consider the interaction between market and funding\nliquidity risk that underlies our model of investor runs.\nThe mutual amplification of market and funding liquidity risk in our model links our\npaper to another literature studying the destabilizing effect of margins (Brunnermeier\nmarket illiquidity can amplify firm deleveraging due to a fire sale externality. This \"mar-\ngin channel\", however, differs substantially from our \"information acquisition channel\"\nin both its empirical and policy implications. First, fire sales resulting from funding\nconstraints lead prices to decline when firm deleveraging becomes excessive. In contrast,\nin our model prices decline because some firms (namely those that know they hold good\nassets) opt not to sell their assets in secondary markets. Thus, while the \"margin chan-\nnel\" suggests that low asset prices should be associated with high trading volumes, our\n\"information acquisition channel\" does not.7 Second, but related to the first point, fire\nsales caused by funding constraints emerge due to a lack of overall liquidity in the econ-\nomy. Liquidity injections that relax funding constraints therefore dampen price declines\ncaused by fire sales. Again, this contrasts with our framework, where liquidity injections\nmay exacerbate market illiquidity by reinforcing adverse selection frictions.\nFinally, our paper draws from the large literature on global games that interprets\nliquidity dry-ups as the result of a coordination failure; e.g. Morris and Shin (2003,\n2004a,b). Compared to this literature, our model studies a new channel of coordination\n5In a related model studying information acquisition by sellers (rather than buyers), Dang, Gorton,\nand Holmstr\u00a8\nom (2013) shows that the value of information is the minimum of either the information rent\nfrom selling a low payoff security at a high price, or the gain from not selling a high payoff security at a\nlow price. Firms' surplus from information acquisition in our model is similar to the latter. While Dang\net al. (2013) focus on optimal security design, we study the feedback between information acquisition\nand market prices.\n6Feijer (2015) also studies strategic complementarities in information acquisition in a model with\ncontracting frictions caused by a risk-shifting problem. The feedback mechanism in his model is distinct\nfrom the one here, as it operates through initial borrowing costs rather than secondary market prices.\nHe also does not consider the interaction between market and funding liquidity risk.\n7This \"double whammy\" (as Tirole (2011) refers to it) of declining prices and trading volumes fits\nwell with observed price and trading movements in securitized asset markets during the 2007-08 financial\ncrisis.\nfailure that explicitly ties market liquidity risk to an adverse selection problem caused\nby firms' information acquisition behavior. Our paper differs from most global game\nmodels as it features strategic complementarities within and across two groups of agents.\nMethodologically, our analysis is closely related to the twin crisis model of Goldstein\n(2005) who first extended global game techniques to a setting with two types of agents\nand a common fundamental.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we treat the amount\nof early redemptions as given and characterize funds' information acquisition decisions\nand the resulting unique equilibrium in terms of the macroeconomic state. This serves\nto illustrate the model's main mechanism. In Section 3, we endogenize the redemption\ndecisions of investors and derive the joint equilibrium between funds and investors. We\ncharacterize the different regimes and the welfare properties. Implications for policy are\nsubsequently discussed in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes. All proofs are relegated\nto the Appendix.\n2 Information Acquisition and Market Liquidity\nWe consider an economy populated by a continuum of risk-neutral financial institutions,\nindexed by j  [0, 1], that operate for three dates t  {0, 1, 2}. We think of these insti-\ntutions as non-bank entities like off-balance sheet conduits (e.g. structured investment\nvehicles), hedge funds, or money market funds. For simplicity, we henceforth refer to\nthe institutions in our model as funds.\nAssets. Each fund enters the economy at date t = 0 holding one unit of a perfectly\ndivisible long-term asset that pays out at date t = 2. The asset's payoff at maturity\nconsists of two parts: (i) a risky component ~\nX(), and (ii) a non-marketable control rent\nQ > 0. The risky component ~\nX() has the following payoff structure:\n~\nX() =\nX() with probability \nX() with probability 1 - \nWhen the realized payoff is X(), the asset is said to be of a good type; otherwise\nit is said to be of a bad type. The realization of the assets' type is assumed to be i.i.d.\nacross funds. The parameter     [0, 1] is a macroeconomic state that affects assets'\nreturns in a mean-preserving spread sense: i.e. E[ ~\nX()] = F for all    such that\nd\nd\nX() < 0 and d\nd\nX() > 0.8 The macroeconomic state  can be interpreted as a\nmeasure of uncertainty affecting funds' assets, with high (low) values of  indicating a\nlow (high) degree of macroeconomic uncertainty.\nIn addition to the risky component, each fund obtains a non-marketable control rent\nQ > 0 per unit of asset under management at t = 2. This control rent can be interpreted\n8More explicitly, X() = F\nsuch that d\nd\nX() = - (1-)F\nand d\nd\nX() = F\n.\nas additional value created by funds if assets remain on their balance sheet, e.g. due\nto funds' superior asset management capabilities, or benefits from regulatory arbitrage.\nHence, while the ex ante book value of the asset is given by F, from the funds' perspective\nthe ex ante expected value of assets held until maturity is equal to F + Q.\nInformation Structure. The macroeconomic state  is drawn at date t = 0 from a\nuniform distribution over .9 The realization of  becomes common knowledge before\nthe market opens at date t = 1.\nAt date t = 0, each fund receives a noisy private signal about the macroeconomic\nstate:\nj =  + j\nwhere j is i.i.d. across funds and drawn from a uniform distribution over [- , ]. In\naddition to observing this noisy signal about , funds can acquire private information\nabout the type of their asset at a fixed cost  > 0 at t = 0. For simplicity, we assume\nthat by acquiring information funds perfectly observe whether their asset is good or\nbad.10 We denote by j  {n, g, b} fund j's information set conditional on not acquiring\ninformation (n), or acquiring information and verifying the asset's type to be good (g)\nor bad (b). Correspondingly,\nE[ ~\nX()|j, j]  {F, E(X()|j), E(X()|j)}\ndenotes fund j's beliefs at t = 0 about its asset's type given its information set.\nLiabilities. Each fund is financed by a distinct unit mass of investors. A fraction\n(1 - ) of each fund's liabilities are irredeemable, e.g. long-term debt or equity shares\nheld by passive investors. The remaining fraction  is redeemable at date t = 1. More\nspecifically, we build on Liu and Mello (2011) and model the redemption process as\nfollows: investors must notify their fund about their redemption decision at t = 0; their\nclaims are then priced at the current marketable book value of the fund, F, and disbursed\nto investors at t = 1. For the moment, we assume that an exogenous share   [0, 1] of\nredeemable liabilities are withdrawn and need to be repaid at date t = 1. We endogenize\ninvestors' redemption decisions and study the resulting feedback between market and\nfunding liquidity risk in Section 3.\nLiquidity Sources. The balance sheet structure described above implies that funds\nare subject to a standard liquidity mismatch problem: while the long-term asset does not\npay out until t = 2, funds must finance redemptions of F at t = 1. We assume that\nfunds can obtain the liquidity needed to meet early redemptions in one of two ways.\nFirst, each fund has access to a private liquidity line from which cash can be drawn\n9The restriction to a uniform distribution is without loss of generality; any other continuous distri-\nbution with finite support  could be assumed.\n10Our results would not be altered if we assumed that funds could only observe a noisy signal about\nthe idiosyncratic state of their assets.\nFigure 2: Sequence of Events\n drawn, signals observed\ninformation and redemption\ntrue  revealed\nchoice of liquidity source\nmarket opens, assets trade at p\nassets pay out\nearly redemption payments\nlate redemption\nchoices\npayments\ndown at a unit cost of  > 1. Alternatively, funds can sell their assets on a competitive\nsecondary market in t = 1 at price p. The buyers in the secondary market are large\nin number, deep-pocketed and risk-neutral and stand ready to purchase assets at their\nexpected value at t = 1, i.e. p = E[ ~\nX()|]. Since the control rent is non-marketable,\nfunds selling assets to meet early redemptions must necessarily forego the additional\npayoff Q per unit of asset sold. This can also be interpreted as a fixed fire-sale discount\nincurred by funds when deleveraging. The sequence of events is summarized in Figure\n2.2 Liquidity Sources and Asset Prices\nLiquidity Lines vs. Asset Sales. At date t = 1, funds choose between the two\nliquidity sources in order to maximize their expected equity value, given their information\nset j and the realized macroeconomic state . Denote by V LL\nj\nand V AS\nj\nthe equity value\nof a fund with information set j that uses liquidity lines (LL) or asset sales (AS) to\nobtain liquidity. The expected equity value of a fund that obtains j  F units of\nliquidity at t = 1 by selling assets is given by\nj\n( j)|] = E max ~\nX() + Q 1 - j\np\n+ ( j - F), 0 j,  (1)\nSimilarly, the value of a fund choosing to obtain liquidity via its liquidity line equals\nj\n( j)|] = E max ~\nX() + Q -  j + ( j - F), 0 j,  (2)\nSince  > 1, funds meeting early redemptions using their liquidity lines will never\nchoose to obtain more liquidity than that needed to meet early redemptions. The choice\nof j for funds selling assets, however, depends on their information set and the size of\nQ. In what follows, we assume that the non-marketable control rent always exceeds the\ninformation rent that informed funds with bad assets could obtain by selling their entire\nportfolio at a price above their assets' true value. This ensures that informed funds will\nnever choose to sell more assets than what is needed to meet their liquidity needs.\nAssumption 1. Let   min{}, then the non-transferable control rent Q is such that\nQ > F - X()\nEquations (1) and (2) imply that funds' preference between liquidity lines and asset\nsales depends on the market price (p) and the cost of liquidity lines (). To fix funds'\npreference ordering over liquidity sources given their information set j, we impose the\nfollowing restrictions on the set of macroeconomic states :\nAssumption 2. The lower and upper bounds of , min{}   and max{}  , are\nsuch that\nF + Q\nX()\n<  <\nX() + Q\nF\nwhere the parameters  and Q are such that  = .\nThe upper bound on  corresponds to a standard \"lemons condition.\" It implies that\neven if assets trade at their ex ante expected value (p = F), informed funds holding good\nassets always prefer to meet redemptions by tapping their liquidity lines. Effectively, this\ninequality implies that the cash flow of a good asset is sufficiently large to compensate\nfunds for the cost of the liquidity line, regardless of the price at which assets trade in\nsecondary markets. The lower bound on , on the other hand, implies that even if\nassets trade at the lowest possible price (p = X()), uninformed funds prefer to meet\nredemptions by selling assets in the absence of default.11\nIn what follows, we assume that the fraction of irredeemable liabilities is sufficiently\nlarge such that funds never become illiquid even if they face full redemptions at t = 1,\ni.e.  = 1. In particular, funds never default if the following inequality is satisfied:\nF < min\nX() + Q\n\n, X() =\nF\n\nwhich implies that the face value of funds' redeemable liabilities is strictly less than the\nliquidation value of funds' with bad assets regardless of whether they obtain liquidity\nthrough asset sales or via their liquidity lines.12 This no-default assumption allows us\nto abstract from gambling incentives driven by funds' limited liability constraint.13\n11The lower bound on  is a technical assumption needed to guarantee the existence of an equilibrium\nin funds' information acquisition game.\n12The simplification of the right-hand-side of the inequality follows from Assumptions 1 and 2.\n13When this assumption is violated, uninformed funds could prefer to resort to the liquidity line\n(instead of selling assets) and gamble that their asset turns out to be good. Note that potential losses\nfrom this gambling behaviour would have to be borne by the sponsor whenever funds defaulted on their\nliquidity line. Given funds' limited liability constraint, investors would be wiped-out despite funds having\nreceived interim support. This, however, would be difficult to square with available evidence on sponsor\nAssumption 3. The fraction of redeemable liabilities is such that  < 1/.\nLemma 1. Given Assumptions 1-3, informed funds with good assets strictly prefer the\nliquidity line, while informed funds with bad assets and uninformed funds strictly prefer\nasset sales.\nAsset Price. Buyers that purchase assets in the secondary market must break even.\nSince the macroeconomic state becomes common knowledge before the markets open at\nt = 1, buyers' expectations are conditioned on the realized value of . Their participation\nconstraint is therefore given by\np  E[ ~\nX|] = X()( + (1 - ))\nwhere   [0, 1] denotes the fraction of good assets supplied to the market. Competition\nin the market ensures that this inequality binds in equilibrium.\nThe price at which assets trade depends on buyers' beliefs about the share of good\nassets supplied to the market. Given Lemma 1, only uninformed and informed bad funds\nsupply their assets to the market. Hence, whenever some funds acquire information, the\nshare of good assets traded in the secondary market will be strictly less than the share\nof good assets in the economy: i.e.  < . We assume that trading in the secondary\nmarket is anonymous, so that market participants cannot infer assets' state based on the\nquantity fund j supplies to the market.14 Letting   [0, 1] denote the share of funds\nacquiring information, the fraction of good assets traded in the market is then equal to\n() =\nand the market price can be rewritten as\np(, ) = F - ( - ())(1 - )X() (3)\nBy acquiring information, funds induce an asymmetric information friction in sec-\nondary markets, as informed funds with good assets withhold these from the market.\nThe resulting adverse selection problem leads assets to trade at a discount compared to\ntheir ex ante book value. Importantly, this discount is strictly decreasing in the fraction\nof informed funds since the share of good assets traded in the market falls as more funds\nacquire information, i.e.  () < 0. Moreover, since the value of bad assets rises when\nthe macroeconomic state improves, the price also increases in the macroeconomic state\n.\nsupport. For example, Brady et al. (2012) show that although a substantial number of MMFs could\nhave `broken the buck' had they not received support dring the 2007-08 crisis, there are no instances\nwhere funds defaulted after they received support. Similarly, Gorton (2010) documents that structured\ninvestment vehicles that received sponsor support did not default.\n14This assumption rules out the possibility of funds using their liquidity lines to signal their type to\npotential buyers. For an analysis of the signaling effects of liquidity lines see Segura (2017).\nLemma 2. The secondary market price is strictly decreasing in the fraction of informed\nfunds: p(, ) < 0, and is strictly increasing in the macroeconomic state: p(, ) > 0.\nDiscussion of Modelling Environment. The assumption that liquidity lines are\ncostly in our model is key, and can be justified for a number of reasons. For example,\nproviding funds with liquidity may require sponsoring institutions to pass on valuable\ninvestment opportunities for which they must be compensated. Funds may nonetheless\nprefer to use liquidity lines rather than maintaining cash balances since liquidity lines\nallow funds to avoid paying the liquidity premium implied by holding liquid assets in\nstates of the world where they do not face a liquidity shortfall (Acharya, Almeida, and\nCampello, 2013). Moreover, while cash balances constitute a sunk cost for funds if these\nare stored before liquidity shocks are realized, the costs of contingent liquidity lines are\nnot sunk but rather are only incurred if funds choose to draw them down. These costs\nshould therefore affect funds' choice of liquidity source when financing early redemptions.\nFunds' choice of liquidity source in our model can be more broadly interpreted as a\nchoice between: (i) deleveraging or (ii) borrowing funds from their sponsor at a fixed\ninterest rate. We restrict attention to these two liquidity sources insofar as we consider\nour model relevant for understanding environments where the issuance of new (debt or\nequity) securities by funds is not feasible. As in Gorton and Pennacchi (1990), risk-less\ndebt in our model has the advantage of being an informationally-insensitive security and\nconsequently not subject to adverse selection discounts. Consequently, if funds could\ncostlessly issue new securities, they would all optimally choose to issue risk-less debt.\nOur model assumes that the only way in which funds can obtain such informationally-\ninsensitive financing is by tapping their costly liquidity lines, and shows that funds' choice\nof liquidity source in this case fundamentally depends on their private information.15\nLiquidity lines also differ from new debt issuances as their cost (i.e. the interest charged\non funds drawn from the line) are contracted upon before the realization of liquidity\nshocks and therefore do not react to contemporaneous market information.\nIn principle our model could also be applied to commercial banks or depository insti-\ntutions. However, a number of our modeling assumptions make us inclined to interpret\nthe funds in our model as shadow banks or off-balance sheet vehicles. First, compared to\ncommercial banks who can access retail deposit markets and are subject to minimum re-\nserve and liquidity requirements, non-bank financial institutions rely to a much stronger\ndegree on market-based liquidity management. The assumption that uninformed funds\nprefer deleveraging to tapping their liquidity line (cf. Assumption 2) is consistent with\nthe fact that off-balance sheet vehicles often relied on so-called \"dynamic liquidity man-\nagement\" strategies to manage their funding risk, meaning that they regularly sold assets\nin order to obtain liquidity notwithstanding the recourse to their sponsors' balance sheets\n(Covitz, Liang, and Suarez, 2013). Second, credit intermediation activities of depository\ninstitutions are enhanced by official sector guarantees (e.g. deposit insurance schemes or\naccess to central bank discount windows). In constrast, the activities of shadow banks\n15Note that deleveraging is also costly as it requires funds to forgo the non-marketable control rent,\nQ.\nlie outside the perimeter of banking regulation and are only indirectly enhanced through\nprivate agreements with third parties, e.g. their sponsoring institutions (Pozsar et al.,\n2.3 Equilibrium: Information Acquisition\nSurplus from Information Acquisition. Given Lemma 1, if a fund does not acquire\ninformation, it prefers to meet early redemptions by selling assets. The expected equity\nvalue of an uninformed fund at t = 0 therefore equals E[V AS\nn\n(F)|j]. If a fund acquires\ninformation, then with probability  the asset is verified to be good and with probability\n1 -  it is verified to be bad. Again, by Lemma 1, funds with good assets always prefer\nto use their liquidity lines, while bad funds opt to sell assets. The expected surplus from\nacquiring information at t = 0, given signal j, is then equal to\nE[S(, ; )|j]  E V LL\nh\n(F) + (1 - )V AS\nl\n(F) - V AS\nn\n(F) j\nwhere the subindexes {n, h, l} indicate fund j's information set j at t = 0. Using\nequations (1) and (2), this function can be rewritten as\nE[S(, ; )|j] = E \nX() + Q\np(, )\n-  F j (4)\nThe expected surplus from acquiring information can be interpreted as the option\nvalue from holding good assets rather than selling them at the pooling price. In par-\nticular, informed funds with good assets benefit from using their liquidity lines rather\nthan trading in the market as they only forego  units of output tomorrow for one unit\nof liquidity today, compared to X() + Q units of output tomorrow for p(, ) units of\nliquidity today. The upper bound on  (Assumption 2) guarantees that this difference\nis always positive.\nAs shown by Lemma 2, the market price declines as more funds become informed\ndue to adverse selection. Importantly, lower prices reduce the opportunity cost of using\nliquidity lines and thereby increase the value from acquiring information (cf. equation\n(4)). This feedback between the value of information and the market price generates\nstrategic complementarities in information acquisition: i.e. for any private signal j \n, fund j s surplus from acquiring information is increasing in the fraction of funds\nacquiring information, .16 In addition, because the price increases whereas the value of\ngood assets declines in the macroeconomic state, the surplus from information strictly\ndecreases in .\n16The control rent Q is important for generating the monotonicity of the surplus function in . The\ncontrol rent effectively eliminates the incentives of funds with bad assets to sell off their portfolio at\na premium p - X() and obtain a `lemon rent'. This allows us to isolate the complementarities in\ninformation acquisition created by the `option rent' from withholding good assets. The option rent\nexists also in the presence of a lemon rent, e.g. when Q = 0. However, a lemon rent could overturn the\ncomplementarities and lead funds' decisions to become strategic substitutes instead. The consequences\nof such a lemon rent are already studied extensively in the literature, e.g. by Gorton and Ordonez (2014)\nLemma 3. The surplus from information acquisition is strictly increasing in the fraction\nof informed funds: S(, ; ) > 0, and is strictly decreasing in the macroeconomic state:\nS(, ; ) < 0.\nIn equilibrium, funds choose to acquire information if and only if their expected net\nsurplus from doing so is positive: i.e. whenever E[S(; ; )|j] -  > 0. In what fol-\nlows, we impose the following restriction on the relationship between funds' information\nacquisition costs and the set of macroeconomic states :\nAssumption 4. There exist F\n  and F  , such that the costs for acquiring\ninformation satisfy\nS(1, F ; ) <  < S(0, F\n; )\nAssumption 4 implies that whenever the state is above (below) the bound F (F\n),\nthe net surplus from information acquisition is strictly negative (positive), no matter\nwhat strategies the other funds choose. Moreover, it further implies that there are\nsignals above (below) which it becomes a dominant action to refrain from (engage in)\ninformation acquisition.\nMonotone Strategies. Funds choose whether or not to acquire information based on\ntheir signal of the macroeconomic state j, their beliefs regarding other funds' informa-\ntion acquisition decisions and the expected secondary market price. In equilibrium, the\nrealized share of informed funds and the resulting market price must be consistent with\nfunds' initially held beliefs.\nIn the absence of fundamental uncertainty \u00ad i.e. in an environment where the re-\nalization of  would already be common knowledge at t = 0 \u00ad the economy would\nexhibit multiple equilibria for intermediate values of   [F\n, F ] due to the strategic\ncomplementarities characterizing funds' information acquisition decision. In one equi-\nlibrium, funds, expecting market prices to be high, refrain from information acquisition\nand market liquidity provision is undistorted by asymmetric information frictions. In\na second equilibrium, funds, expecting market liquidity to dry-up, acquire information\nand precipitate an adverse selection problem by withholding good assets from secondary\nmarkets. The noisiness of funds' signals and the breaking of common knowledge about\nthe macroeconomic state allows to isolate a unique equilibrium (Morris and Shin, 2003).\nA strategy for fund j is defined as a mapping j :   [0, 1] which specifies for\neach signal j   the probability with which fund j chooses to acquire information\nabout the idiosyncratic state of its asset. A strategy is monotone, summarized by a\ncritical threshold \nj,\n, whenever the fund acquires information with probability one if\nj < \nj,\nand otherwise refrains from information acquisition. A symmetric monotone\nstrategy is a monotone strategy where all funds use the same critical threshold \nF,\n. As\nwe show below, restricting attention to symmetric monotone strategies is without loss\nof generality.\nUnique Monotone Equilibrium. By the law of large numbers and using the assump-\ntions of uniformly distributed states and signals, the share of funds acquiring information\ngiven a symmetric monotone strategy summarized by \nF,\nis equal to\n(\nF,\n, ) = Pr(j < \nF,\n|) = G\n\nF,\n-  +\nwhere G(x) = min{max{x, 0}, 1}.\nIn equilibrium, the threshold value \nF,\nmust be such that a fund that observes the\nsignal j = \nF,\nis just indifferent between acquiring information or not, given that other\nfunds use the monotone strategy around \nF,\n. Given the uniform prior assumption, the\nposterior belief about  for a fund receiving signal \nF,\nis uniform over [\nF,\n- , \nF,\n+ ].\nThe threshold \nF,\nmust therefore solve\nE[S((\nF,\n, ), ; )|\nF,\n] =\n\nF,\n+\n\nF,\n-\nS((\nF,\n, ), ; )d =  (6)\nChanging the variable of integration using the definition of the share of informed\nfunds given by equation (5), the latter condition can be written as\nS(, (\nF,\n, ); )d =  (7)\nwhere (\nF,\n, ) = \nF,\nProposition 1. (Unique Monotone Equilibrium)\n1. There exists a unique monotone equilibrium where funds acquire information if and\nonly if j < \nF,\n, where \nF,\n (F\n, F ).\n2. There are no other equilibria in non-monotone strategies.\nEquilibrium Properties. The information acquisition decisions of funds in equilib-\nrium imply that market liquidity dries up for states below \nF,\n+ . This critical state,\nand therefore the prevalence of market illiquidity, depends crucially on the marketability\nand the expected cash flow of the assets, as measured by F and Q.\nCorollary 1. The threshold \nF,\nbelow which funds acquire information is (i) strictly\nincreasing in the control rent Q: \nF,\n/Q > 0; and (ii) increasing or decreasing in the\nexpected cash flow of the asset: \nF,\nIncreases in the control rent, Q, reflect deteriorations in the marketability of assets\nand raise the surplus from information acquisition, thereby exacerbating the coordination\nproblem among funds. Put differently, as the marketability of assets decreases, secondary\nasset markets become more prone to endogenous adverse selection frictions.\nWhile changes to the control rent have an unambiguous effect on the threshold,\nincreases in the expected cash flows are associated with two opposing effects: a negative\nprice effect and a positive redemption effect. The price effect implies that funds have\nto sell less assets to meet a given amount of redemptions as cash flows increase. This\nlowers the surplus from information acquisition and tends to lower the threshold below\nwhich funds acquire information. Larger expected cash flows, however, also imply that\ninvestors are entitled to a larger claim if they withdraw early. This redemption effect\nraises the surplus from information acquisition and tends to push up the threshold below\nwhich funds acquire information. Whether the price or the redemption effect dominates\ndepends, among other things, on the magnitude of the costs of liquidity lines. If  is\nsufficiently large, the negative price effect dominates and higher expected cash flows\nreduce the set of states where the market dries up due to adverse selection frictions.\nAnother important feature of the equilibrium is that the set of states where market\nliquidity dries up due to adverse selection is increasing in the fraction of early redemp-\ntions, . Similar to the redemption effect mentioned above, a larger share of early\nredemptions increases the surplus from acquiring information and, for fixed information\nacquisition costs, leads funds to acquire information about the type of their assets for a\nlarger range of signals.\nCorollary 2. The threshold \nF,\nbelow which funds acquire information is strictly in-\ncreasing in the fraction of early withdrawals: \nF,\nThis last result raises the issue of how funds' funding liquidity risk is affected by\nmarket liquidity conditions. The next section shows how the endogenous adverse selec-\ntion, stemming from funds acquiring private information about their assets' type, can\nlead market and funding illiquidity to become mutually reinforcing. This feedback arises\nbecause investors' incentives to redeem their claims early may rise if they expect asset\nprices to decline, as this erodes the residual equity value of funds covering redemptions\nvia asset sales.\n3 Market Illiquidity and Redemption Risk\n3.1 Investors' Redemption Decisions\nand assume that active investors are subject to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks that affect\ntheir valuation for t = 2 consumption. In particular, we assume that each active investor\nfaces a liquidity shock with probability \u00b5, implying that a total share \u00b5  (0, 1) become\nimpatient and always redeem their claims at t = 1. The remaining share (1 - \u00b5) of\nactive investors are patient: they face no urgent liquidity need, but may nonetheless\nredeem their claim early if the payoff from doing so exceeds the expected value of their\nclaim at maturity.17 Investor types are private information, implying that funds cannot\ncondition redemption payments on whether an investor is patient or impatient.\nPatient investors, like funds, receive noisy signals about the macroeconomic state \nat date t = 0. These signals have the same structure as the signals received by funds:\n17While our results require the mass of impatient investors to be strictly positive, \u00b5 can be arbitrarily\nsmall. That is, all our results hold even in the limiting case where \u00b5  0.\ni =  + i, where i indexes patient investors and i is i.i.d. across investors and funds,\ndrawn from a uniform distribution over [- , ]. Based on their signals, patient investors\nform beliefs about funds' expected equity value at maturity, taking the information\nacquisition behaviour of funds, the resulting market price and the redemption decisions\nof other patient investors as given.\nSurplus from Early Redemption. The total share of active investors redeeming\ntheir shares at t = 1 is given by   [\u00b5, 1]. The value of a claim at maturity equals the\npro-rata share of a fund's equity value at date t = 2, denoted by D2(, ; ). A patient\ninvestor who observes signal i expects the value of claims redeemed at t = 2 to be\nE [D2(, ; )| i] = E\nh\n(F) + (1 - )V AS\nl\n(F) + (1 - )V AS\nn\n(F)\ni\nUsing equations (1) and (2), this expression can be rewritten as follows\nE [D2(, ; )| i] = E\n(F + Q) 1 -\nF\np(, )\n+ S(, ; ) i\nThe expected equity value of an investor's claim at maturity consists of two parts:\n(i) the residual equity value of funds' portfolios after assets have been sold to cover\nearly redemptions; and (ii) the information rents accruing to informed funds. A patient\ninvestor prefers early redemption if and only funds' ex ante book value, F, exceeds funds'\nexpected per capita equity value at maturity given the signal i. That is,\nE[W(, ; )|i]  F - E [D2(, ; )| i]  0 (8)\nNote that for all values of  and , W(, ; 0) = -Q < 0: i.e. in the absence of\ninformation acquisition by funds, patient investors would never choose to redeem their\nclaims early because of the control rent that they can earn if assets remain on funds'\nbalance sheets. If  > 0, however, asset prices fall below funds' ex ante book value,\ni.e. p(, ) < F. A fund that sells assets to cover early redemptions in this case must\nliquidate more than one unit of asset per claim redeemed at t = 1. This erodes the\nresidual value of the funds' portfolio and dilutes the claims of patient investors that hold\nout until maturity. This effect is counteracted by the fact that a larger share of early\nredemptions raises the information rents accruing to informed funds: i.e. S(, ; ) > 0.\nHowever, the former effect always dominates the latter, leading the residual equity value\nof funds to decline as the fraction of early redemptions rises. In other words, investors'\nredemption decisions are strategic complements whenever  > 0. Moreover, since asset\nprices are increasing in the macroeconomic state, the surplus from early redemption\nunambiguously decreases in .\nLemma 4. Investors' surplus from early redemption is increasing in the share of early\nredemptions and the fraction of informed funds: W(, ; )  0 and W(, ; ) > 0,\nand strictly decreasing in the macroeconomic state: W(, ; ) < 0.\nFor  > 0, there exist realizations of the macroeconomic state such that patient\ninvestors consider it always dominant to redeem early, and states where they consider it\ndominant to stay invested in the fund until maturity. These regions are bounded (from\nabove and below, respectively), and these bounds are implicitly defined by the following\nW(\u00b5, I\nAs for funds' information acquisition decision, patient investors must choose whether\nor not to redeem their claims early based on their signal of the macroeconomic state i\nand their expectations regarding other investors' redemption decisions and the secondary\nmarket price. A strategy for investor i is then defined as a mapping i :   [0, 1] which\nspecifies for each signal i   a probability with which a patient investor i redeems his\nclaim early. As before, we restrict attention to symmetric monotone strategies summa-\nrized by a critical signal \nI,\nwhereby investors always redeem their claims early with\nprobability one if i < \nI,\n, and never redeem otherwise.\nAs for the information acquisition game characterized above, the law of large numbers\nand the assumption of uniformly distributed states and signals implies that the share of\ninvestors redeeming their claim at t = 1 given the symmetric monotone strategy around\n\nI,\nis equal to\n(\nI,\n, ) = \u00b5 + (1 - \u00b5)G\n\nI,\n-  +\nFor fixed values of  > 0, the equilibrium threshold is determined by the signal realization\ni that makes investors just indifferent between redeeming their claims at t = 1 or t = 2.\nThat is, for a given , \nI,\nsolves\nE[W((\nI,\n, ), ; )|\nI,\n] =\n\nI,\n+\n\nI,\n-\nI,\n, ), ; ) d = 0\n3.2 Information Acquisition and Redemption Equilibrium\nThe joint monotone equilibrium between funds and patient investors is characterized by\ncritical values {\nF,\n, \nI,\n} such that funds acquire information if and only if j < \nF,\nand patient investors redeem early if and only if i < \nI,\n. The equilibrium thresholds\n\nF,\nand \nI,\nsimultaneously solve the following two indifference conditions:\nE[S(, , )| \nF,\n] =\nS , \u00b5 + (1 - \u00b5)G G-1() +\n\nI,\n- \nF,\n, (\nF,\n, ) d = \n18Note that since W(, 0, ) < 0 for all   [\u00b5, 1] and   , it must be that lim0\nI\n= I\n= .\nand\nE[W(, , )| \nI,\n] =\n\u00b5\n - \u00b5\n+\n\nF,\n- \nI,\n, (\nI,\nwhere (\nI,\n, ) = \nI,\nThe thresholds defined by conditions (9) and (10) are bounded from above and from\nbelow. These bounds are determined by funds' and investors' expected surplus under\n\"extreme beliefs.\" For funds, they correspond to realizations of the macroeconomic state\nsuch that the net expected surplus from information acquisition is equal to zero if funds\nbelieve no (all) patient investors redeem their claims early. Formally,\n\nF,\n(\u00b5) : E S((\nF,\n, ), \u00b5, ) \nF,\n=  and \nF,\n(1) : E S((\nF,\n, ), 1, ) \nF,\n= \nSimilarly, for investors, they correspond to realizations of  such that the expected\nsurplus from early redemption is equal to zero if investors believe no (all) funds acquire\ninformation\n\nI,\n(0) = , and \nI,\n(1) : E[W((\nI,\n, ), 1, ) \nI,\nNotice that patient investors never redeem their claims early if they expect funds to\nrefrain from information acquisition, regardless of the realization of the macroeconomic\nstate. However, this never arises in equilibrium since it is always dominate for funds to\nacquire information for sufficiently small realizations of  as there is always a positive\nmass \u00b5 of impatient investors that redeem their shares early. Broadly speaking, funds'\ndecision to acquire information induces a coordination problem among investors and\nprecipitates redemption runs whenever the macroeconomic state is sufficiently low.\nProposition 2. (Joint Monotone Equilibrium)\n1. There exists a unique equilibrium in monotone strategies where equilibrium thresh-\nolds are such that \nI,\n \nF,\nwith \nI,\n (, \nI,\n2. There are no other equilibria in non-monotone strategies.\nAn interesting implication of Proposition 2 is that redemption runs only arise in cases\nwhere market liquidity dries up due to adverse selection. However, secondary market\nfreezes precipitated by funds' decision to acquire private information about their assets\nneed not always result in investor runs. In other words, while funding illiquidity implies\nmarket illiquidity, the converse need not be true. Our model thereby complements\nthe classical bank run literature, e.g. Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Goldstein and\nPauzner (2005), where banks selling assets to meet early withdrawals face an exogenous\nfire sale discount. More specifically, our model proposes a channel through which such\nfire sale discounts endogenously emerge due to funds' strategic incentives to acquire\ninformation about their assets, and shows that while market illiquidity is a necessary\ncondition for runs to arise, it is not always sufficient.\n3.3 Global Game Solution\nTo facilitate the characterization of the equilibrium, we focus on the limiting case where\nagents' private signals about the macroeconomic state become arbitrarily precise, i.e.\n 0. In this case, the equilibrium behavior of agents becomes degenerate around the\nrealized state and the equilibrium outcome depends on the ordering of the bounds \nand \n(\u00b5). Following the terminology of Goldstein (2005), we distinguish between a\nweak dependence and a strong dependence regime.\nProposition 3. The equilibrium thresholds \nF,\nand \nI,\nfor vanishing noise,  0, are\nsuch that:\n1. Weak dependence: \n \n \n(\u00b5) if and only if \n\n(\u00b5).\n2. Strong dependence: \n \n [\n(\u00b5), \n(1)] if and only if \n(\u00b5) < \nIn the weak dependence regime, funds' equilibrium threshold is at its lower bound,\n\n(\u00b5). Information acquisition triggers a run by patient investors who redeem their\nclaims for realizations of the macroeconomic state below \n(1). However, for states\n  (\n(\u00b5)), patient investors abstain from redemptions despite the asset price\nhaving collapsed due to the relatively low degree of macroeconomic uncertainty. Hence,\nwhile information acquisition by funds triggers redemptions in the weak dependence case,\nthe coordination failure among patient investors does not exert an additional feedback\non funds' decisions to acquire information (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Weak Dependence Regime\n\n \nF\n(\u00b5)\n\nI\nredemption runs\ninfo acquisition /\nmarket illiquidity\nThings are different in the strong dependence regime, where funds' and investors'\nthresholds converge such that \n \n [\n(\u00b5), \n(1)]. In this case, redemption\nrisk and market illiquidity coincide and reinforce each other. Market liquidity dry-ups\ndue to adverse selection are now always accompanied by sudden redemptions by patient\ninvestors. The higher funding liquidity risk increases funds' incentives to acquire private\ninformation about their assets, raising the likelihood of asset market freezes caused by\nadverse selection. Thus, in the strong dependence case, the coordination failure among\ninvestors \"spills over\" and amplifies the coordination failure among funds, engendering\na destabilizing feedback between redemption risk and market illiquidity (see Figure 4).\nWeak versus Strong Dependence. Whether the weak or the strong dependence\nregime obtains depends crucially on the characteristics of funds' assets, such as assets'\nexpected cash flow or the control rent. Proposition 3 implies that the strong dependence\nregime obtains if and only if \n(\u00b5) < \nCorollary 3. The economy is more susceptible to the strong dependence regime if: (i)\nthe control rent Q is small; and (ii) the price effect dominates the redemption effect and\nexpected cash flows F are large.\nIf the marketability of the assets is high, the coordination problem among the funds\nis less severe. As a consequence, the threshold \n(\u00b5) is small. At the same time,\nif Q is low, investors do not gain much if they roll over, implying that \nmust be\nrelatively large. This makes the economy more susceptible to a destabilizing feedback\nbetween market and funding illiquidity: if the degree coordination frictions within funds\nis muted, they react relatively more to the coordination problem among investors. Sim-\nilarly, for a given share of early withdrawals, the negative price effect implies that larger\ncash flows make funds less prone to acquire information and thereby diminish the coor-\ndination problem among funds and lower the threshold \n. As higher expected cash\nflows increase investors' incentives to withdraw early, whenever expected cash flows are\nsufficiently large, the strong dependence regime and the mutual amplification between\nmarket and funding liquidity obtains.\nFigure 4: Strong Dependence Regime\n\n \nF\n(\u00b5) \nI\nredemption runs\ninfo acquisition\n\nI\n= \nF\namplified\ninfo acquisition\nEfficient Thresholds. When defining the relevant welfare benchmark, we restrict\nattention to allocations that maximize aggregate utility from consumption. The problem\nfaced by the social planner consists of choosing thresholds {sp\nF\n, sp\nI\n}  2 that maximize\nthe expected payments made to investors.\nDefinition 1. Given thresholds sp\nF\nand sp\nI\n, and associated values  = (sp\nF\n, ) and\n = (sp\nI\n, ), investors' expected utility from consumption is\nU(, ; ) = E0 [F + (1 - )D2(, ; )]\nUsing funds' value functions (1) and (2), we can rewrite the welfare function as\nfollows\nU(, ; ) = E0 F + Q - F ( - 1) + (1 - )\nQ\np(, )\nEven without taking into account the cost of information acquisition , social welfare\nwhen  > 0 is always strictly less than when  = 0. This is because information\nacquisition leads funds with good assets to meet early redemptions using their liquidity\nlines rather than selling assets. While informed good funds avoid the early liquidation of\ntheir assets, and thereby do not forgo the additional control rent Q, Assumption 2 implies\nthat the cost of liquidity lines  is sufficiently large such that aggregate consumption\ndecreases as more funds become informed.19 In other words, the unrealized gains from\ntrade that result from informed good funds using their liquidity line always exceed the\nforegone control rent from selling assets. Information acquisition is thus unambiguously\ninefficient in this economy, as it serves only a private rent-seeking purpose.\nIn the absence of market liquidity risk, it is never socially (nor privately) optimal\nfor patient investors to redeem their shares early since funds' expected equity value at\nmaturity exceeds their ex ante book value, F. As funds not acquiring information always\nopt to meet redemptions by selling assets at their fair value, early redemptions in this\ncase only lead to a destruction of funds' equity value due to the foregone control rent,\nQ.\nProposition 4. The Pareto efficient thresholds are such that sp\nF\n=  and sp\nI\n= .\nInefficiency of the Market Equilibrium. The inefficiency regarding funds' infor-\nmation decisions results from the collapse in market liquidity when funds acquire private\ninformation about the type of their asset. The externality distorting funds' incentives\noperates through changes in the market price, p. In particular, individual funds that\nacquire information and withhold good assets from the market do not internalize how\ntheir behavior affects other funds' option value from holding on to good assets.\nThe inefficiency regarding investors' redemption decisions arises because market liq-\nuidity risk induces a coordination failure among patient investors which leads to excessive\n19As mentioned above, the cost of liquidity lines may stem from the fact that sponsors must forgo\npositive net present value investment opportunities in order to disburse liquidity to their funds at t = 1.\nredemptions in equilibrium. This coordination failure operates through the residual eq-\nuity value of funds. More specifically, individual investors that demand early redemption\ndo not internalize how their redemption decision affects funds' residual equity value, and\nthereby the payment obtained by investors that redeem their shares at maturity. Im-\nportantly, the coordination failure distorting investors' redemption decisions is induced\nby adverse selection in secondary markets: i.e. funding liquidity risk is a consequence of\nfunds' private rent-seeking incentives. Absent information acquisition by funds, ineffi-\ncient redemption runs would never obtain in equilibrium.\n4 Policy Implications\nOur model allows to evaluate the efficacy of different policy measures aimed at mini-\nmizing the risk of market and funding liquidity dry-ups. We focus attention on three\nspecific policies: (i) liquidity injections that reduce the cost of private liquidity lines, (ii)\nasset purchase programs that place a floor on the price at which assets trade, and (iii)\noutright purchases of debt securities. The focus on these three measures is motivated by\nthe policies that central banks and policy makers implemented during the financial crisis\n2007-09 in order to shore up asset and funding markets. For example, beginning in Au-\ngust 2007, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) adopted a number of policy measures to shore\nup wholesale funding markets including the ABCP market. At first, \"conventional\" liq-\nuidity injections were implemented via a lowering of central bank discount rates and\nshort-term repurchase transactions.20 These liquidity injections, however, failed to stop\nthe precipitous fall in outstanding ABCP. They also did not prevent the run on money\nmarket funds that followed in the wake of Lehman Brother's bankruptcy. Subsequently,\nin the fall of 2008, the US Treasury Department announced that it would temporarily\nguarantee all assets held by money market funds. While this succeeded in stopping the\nrun on money market funds, it failed to prop up the further collapsing ABCP market.\nThis led the Fed to provide large amounts of non-recourse loans to commercial banks in\norder for them to purchase ABCP from money market funds. A few weeks later, the Fed\nalso began purchasing commercial paper directly from issuers.21 These policy measures\nspecifically targeting the ABCP market were also accompanied by outright purchases of\nasset-backed securities.22\n20In the euro area, the ECB injected 95 e billion into overnight lending markets on August 9, 2007.\nOver the following days, the Fed followed suit and injected $62 billion. On September 18, 2007 the Fed\nsupplemented these measures by launching the Term Auction Facility (TAF) which conducted longer-\nterm repurchase transactions totaling $100 billion (Kacperczyk and Schnabl, 2010).\n21The non-recourse loans were administered by the Boston Fed's liquidity facility (AMLF) and pur-\nchased roughly $150 billion worth of commercial paper in its first two week of activity. Outright debt\npurchases were carried out by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) which purchased over\n$300 billion worth of commercial paper. Through these two facilities, the Fed ended up holding about\n22The Fed extended non-recourse loans to buyers of both newly issued ABSs and legacy MBSs through\nits Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan facility (TALF) .\nLiquidity Injections. We begin by assessing the effect of liquidity injections, e.g.\nlowering interest rates that reduce the cost of funds' liquidity lines. Maintaining the\nbounds on  implied by Assumption 2, such a policy has an ambiguous effect on market\nand funding liquidity risk. Liquidity injections have a (direct) negative effect on market\nliquidity insofar as they decrease funds' opportunity cost of tapping their liquidity lines.\nThis increases funds' incentives to acquire private information about their assets, thereby\namplifying the adverse selection problem in secondary markets. The resulting fall in as-\nset prices increases investors' incentives to redeem their claims early. Concomitantly,\nhowever, liquidity injections that lower the cost of liquidity lines increase the residual\nequity value of informed funds holding good assets, and thus decrease investors' incen-\ntives to redeem early.23 This second channel implies a (indirect) positive effect on market\nliquidity, as fewer early redemptions lower funds' surplus from acquiring information.\nCorollary 4. Liquidity injections that lower the cost of liquidity lines  can either\nincrease or decrease market and funding liquidity risk: d\n,F\nd\nI,\nd\nAsset Purchases. Next, we consider the effect of a government commitment to pur-\nchase assets at a reservation price q() > X() for all   . By placing a floor on asset\nprices, this policy reduces funds' incentives to acquire information by lowering the option\nvalue from withholding good assets from the market. It also reduces investors' incentives\nto redeem their claims early by raising funds' residual equity value. Even though the\nfloor on asset prices reduces the private surplus from information acquisition, it does\nnot fully eliminate market liquidity risk since funds find it strictly dominant to acquire\ninformation for sufficiently small values of .24 Thus, any price guarantee q() > X()\nrequires the government to buy bad assets at a price above their fundamental value in\nsome states.\nCorollary 5. Asset price guarantees that place a floor on p decrease market liquidity\nrisk and decrease funding liquidity risk. The expected cost from purchasing assets at price\nq() > X() is equal to:\nCAP = (1 - )\nmax{q\nF\n(\u00b5),q\n}\n\n<q\nX()\nq()\n23The destabilizing effect of liquidity lines has also been pointed out by He and Xiong (2012). In their\ndynamic debt run model, liquidity lines amplify creditors' incentives to run when asset volatility is high\nbecause banks' fundamentals deteriorate while they obtain funds through their liquidity lines. This effect\ndoes not arise in our static framework. Instead, cheaper liquidity lines amplify funding withdrawals due\nto their effect on funds' information acquisition incentives, and thereby the market value of funds' assets.\n24Formally, given some reservation price q() > X(), the lower dominance region of funds' informa-\ntion acquisition game is given by\nq\nF\n(\u00b5) :\n\nX(q\nF\n(\u00b5)) + Q\nmax{q(q\nF\n(\u00b5)), p(, q\nF\n(\u00b5))}\n-  \u00b5Fd = \nOutright Debt Purchases. Finally, we consider the effect of outright purchases of\ndebt securities, such as those conducted by the Federal Reserve under the CPFF.25 In\nthe context of our model, this can be thought of as lowering the fraction of redeemable\nclaims. By committing to purchase claims at par at t = 1, the government effectively\nprotects funds from funding liquidity risk. In so doing, it lowers funds' incentives to\nacquire information. Debt purchases also reduce investors' incentives to redeem early by\nraising market liquidity, implying that the government ultimately only needs to purchases\nclaims held by impatient investors.\nCorollary 6. Debt purchases that lower the fraction of redeemable claims  decrease\nmarket and funding liquidity risk: d\nF,\nd\nI,\nd\n> 0. A commitment to buy all\nredeemable shares implements the efficient allocation.\nIf its purchases are unbounded, the government can completely eliminate market liq-\nuidity risk by ensuring that no fund acquires information in equilibrium. Debt purchases\ncan therefore be used to implement the efficient allocation described above. Importantly,\nthis policy does not require the government to purchase the totality of funds' outstand-\ning claims, as the absence of market liquidity risk reduces investors' incentives to redeem\nearly. Debt purchases thus mostly operate via an announcement effect that reduces the\ncoordination failure among funds and investors. This arises because the commitment\nto purchase claims at par if they are not rolled over effectively eliminates the maturity\nmismatch on funds' balance sheet. If claims held by the government are treated the same\nas those held by private investors, such a policy also never requires the government to\nincur a loss. While the government has to step in and absorb outstanding claims held by\nimpatient investors at t = 1, it is always paid back in full at t = 2 when assets mature.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper proposes a model of (shadow) bank runs based on a feedback between in-\nformation acquisition and market liquidity. The value of information arises from the\noption of holding on to good assets by covering redemptions using private liquidity lines\nrather than selling assets. This generates an adverse selection problem in secondary mar-\nkets which reduces market liquidity. Falling prices, in turn, erode shadow banks' equity\nvalue and raise investors' incentives to redeem their claims. This can amplify funding\nwithdrawals and cause market and funding illiquidity to become mutually reinforcing.\nAn implication of our paper is that shadow banks' access to private liquidity lines\nmay have contributed to the fragility of the shadow banking sector during the 2007-09\ncrisis. Another possible factor behind the run on off-balance sheet vehicles at the time\nmay have been investors' fears about the soundness of vehicles' sponsors, and thus the\ncredibility of their guarantees. Our model shows that, even in the absence of these\ncommitment problems, liquidity lines may have been inherently destabilizing by giving\n25Under the CPFF (Commercial Paper Funding Facility) the Federal Reserve provided funding to\nspecially created limited liability company that then bought highly rated unsecured commercial paper\nor ABCP with short maturities, e.g. three-month, directly from issuers.\nshadow banks incentives to acquire private information about the quality of assets on\ntheir balance sheet.\nBroadly speaking, our paper builds on Gorton (2010)'s idea that the run on the\nshadow banking sector during the 2007-09 financial crisis was caused by a sudden regime\nswitch whereby \"informationally insensitive\" securities suddenly became \"information-\nally sensitive.\" A key contribution of our model is to show that such regimes can be\nsustained by self-fulfilling beliefs about shadow banks' information acquisition behavior.\nIt thereby provides a new framework studying the interaction between information ac-\nquisition, market liquidity and funding risk that helps explain the fragility of the shadow\nbanking sector. Although our modelling assumptions make us inclined to think of the\nfunds in our model as shadow banking arrangements, the model also sheds some light\non more general market-based financial intermediation where fluctuations in the value\nof intermediaries' assets and liabilities are closely tied to changes in market prices. From\nthis perspective, it highlights the fragility of financial institutions holding complex and\nopaque securities that rely on a mix of market-based liquidity and third-party support\nto manage their funding risk.\nAppendix\nProof of Lemma 1. Before proving the lemma, we show that Assumptions 1 - 3 are not mutually exclu-\nsive, i.e. there exist non-empty intervals () and Q() such that any   () and Q  Q() satisfy\nAssumptions 1 and 2. To see this, observe first that we can use Assumption 2 to solve for a largest lower\nand a smallest upper bound on :\n =\n(F + Q)\nF - (1 - )(F + Q)\nand  =\nF - (F - Q)\n(1 - )(F - Q)\n() and Q() must be such that 0   <   1. Note first that   0 and   1 require Q  ( - 1)F.\nSecond,\nHence, whenever  > ( + 1)-1, the latter implies Q  ( - 1)F in contradiction to   0 and   1.\nTherefore,  < ( + 1)-1. Finally, substitung the explicit form for X() = ( + (1 - ))-1F and\nthe above expression for  into Assumption 1 and solving for Q yields Q > (-1)F\n. Summarizing, any\ncombination of  and Q from () = (0, (+1)-1) and Q() = ((-1)F\n, (-1)F) satisfies Assumptions\nTo prove the Lemma, note that for all j\n, we have that \nj\n= \u00b5F regardless of whether funds use\nassets sales or the liquidity line to meet redemptions. This follows because for all j\nand  we have that\nd\nd j\nj\n( j\n)|] < 0 since  > 1 and d\nd j\nj\n( j\n)|] < 0 due to Assumption 1.\nFor informed funds such that j\n {g, b} notice that E[V LL\nj\n(\u00b5F)|]  E[V AS\nj\n(\u00b5F)|] implies\nmax (E[ ~\nX()|j\n, ] + Q) - \u00b5F, 0  (E[ ~\nX()|j\n, ] + Q) max 1 -\n\u00b5F\np\nSimilarly, for uninformed funds such that j\n {n} notice that E[V LL\nn\n(\u00b5F)|]  E[V AS\nn\n(\u00b5F)|]\nimplies\nmax ( ~\nX() + Q) - \u00b5F, 0   E0\n( ~\nX() + Q) max 1 -\n\u00b5F\np\nFrom Assumption 2, it follows that informed funds holding a good asset prefer the liquidity line while\ninformed funds holding a bad asset and uninformed funds prefer asset sales for all \u00b5F < min{(X() +\nQ)/, X()}. Substituting the lower bound for Q implied by Assumption 1, this inequality implies that\n\u00b5 < 1/, which must hold due to Assumption 3.\nProof of Proposition 1. We prove the proposition by showing that funds' information acquisition game\nsatisfies all the properties of Proposition 2.2 in Morris and Shin (2003).\nThe required properties are:\n1.

Strict Laplacian State Monotonicity: There exists a unique \nF\nS(, \nF\n; )d = .\nProperties 1 and 2 are implied by Lemma 3. Properties 3 and 4 follow from the definition of the surplus\nfunction and the uniform distribution of signals, respectively. Property 5 is implied by Assumption\n4. Finally, Property 6 follows from the fact that 1\nS(, F\n; )d > , 1\nS(, F\n; )d <  and\nS\n(, ; )d < 0 for all  > 0. It follows that there exists a unique monotone equilibrium and that\nthere are no other equilibria in non-monotone strategies.\nProof of Corollary 1.

(i) Unique monotone equilibrium: We show that there exists a unique montone\nequilibrium where thresholds are such that \nI\n \nF\n.\nSuppose that funds and investors use monotone strategies around \nF\nand \nI\n. From the proof of\nProposition 1, we know that for a fixed value of \nI,\n(and hence a fixed value of   \u00b5) there exists\na unique threshold \nF,\n(\nI,\n) that solves condition (9). Note that the optimal information acquisition\nthreshold solving equation (9) is weakly increasing in \nI,\nwith slope given by\nd\nF,\nd\nI,\n=\nS\n(\u00b7) d\nS\nS\n(\u00b7)d\nwhere the condition follows from application of the implicit function theorem and the fact that S\nand S\nSubstituting condition (9) into condition (10) yields\nH(\nI,\n) \n\u00b5\nW , G\n - \u00b5\n+\n\nF,\n(\nI,\n) - \nI,\n, (\nI,\n, ) d\nNotice that\nH(\nI,\n\u00b5\nW , G\n - \u00b5\n+\n\nF,\n(\nI,\nI,\n, (\nI,\nsince \nF,\n(\u00b5) >  for all \u00b5 > 0, I\n(0) =  and W\n(\u00b7) > 0. Furthermore, we also have that\nH(\nI,\n\u00b5\nW , G\n - \u00b5\n+\n\nF,\n(\nI,\nI,\n, (\nI,\nwhere the condition follows from the fact that G(\u00b7)  [0, 1] and W\n(\u00b7) > 0. Hence, by application of\nthe intermediate value theorem, the function H(\nI,\n) must intersect the x-axis at least once for values\nof \nI,\n (\nF,\n(\u00b5), \nI,\n(1)]. Since d\nF,\nd\nI,\n< 1, it follows that\nH (\nI,\n) =\n\u00b5\nW\n(\u00b7)\nd\nF,\nd\nI,\n\u00b5\nW\nsince W\n(\u00b7) < 0, implying that there exists a unique value \nI,\n (\nF,\n(\u00b5), \nI,\n(1)] that solves H(\nI,\nFinally, we show that \nI,\n \nF,\n.

Towards a contradiction, suppose that an alternative non-monotone equilibrium exists where\nfunds acquire information for some signals j\n> \nF,\nand where patient investors redeem early for some\nsignals i\n> \nI,\n. By the existence of dominance regions there exist bounds N\nF\nand N\nI\nsuch that funds\ndo not acquire information for j\n> N\nF\nand investors never redeem for i\n> N\nI\n.

A symmetric argument establishes that agents\nwill not switch at types below \nF,\nand \nI,\n. Thus, a non-monotone equilibrium cannot exist.\nProof of Proposition 3. We first prove that \nF,\n \n(\u00b5) and \nI,\n \n(1) if and only if \n\n(\u00b5). Sufficiency follows by noting that when \nI,\n< \nF,\n, condition (9) implies\nlim\nE[S(, , )| \nF,\n] = E[S(, \u00b5, )| \nF,\n]  lim\n\nF,\n= \nSimilarly, condition (10) implies\nlim\nE[W(, , )| \nI,\n] = E[W(, 1, )| \nI,\n]  lim\n\nI,\n= \nHence, we must have \n(\u00b5). Necessity then follows from observing that \nI,  \nF,\nif\n\n(\u00b5).\nSecond, we show that \nI,\n \nif and only if \n(\u00b5). From above, by contraposition,\n\n(\u00b5) if and only if \n \nas  0. But since Proposition 2 implies that \nI,  \nF,\n, it\nmust be that \n= \n.\nFinally, we show that indeed \nF,\n \n [\n(\u00b5), \n(\u00b5). From condition\n(9), we have that\nlim\nE[S(, , )| \nF,\n]  E[S(, \u00b5, )| \nF,\n]  lim\n\nF,\n \n(\u00b5)\nwhere the inequality follows from lim 0\nG G-1() + \nI,\n-\nF,\n(\u00b7) > 0 and S\nSimilarly, using condition (10), we have\nlim\nE[W(, , )| \nI,\n]  lim\nE[W(, 1, )| \nI,\n]  lim\n\nI,\n \nwhere the inequality follows from lim 0\n+ \nF,\n-\nI,\n(\u00b7) > 0 and W\nSince \nI,\n \nF,\nas  0, it follows that \nF,\n \n [\n(\u00b5), \n(1)].

Asset Purchase Programs. Given an asset price guarantee q() > X(), funds' surplus function\n(4) implies that funds' equilibrium threshold in this case solves\nF,\n, \nI,\n) =\n\nX((\nF,\n, )) + Q\nmax{q((\nF,\n, )), p(, (\nF,\n, )}\n-  (\nF,\n, \nI,\nSimilarly, investors' surplus function (8) in this case solves\nF,\n, \nI,\n) = F -\n\u00b5\n(, (\nF,\n, \nI,\n), (\nI,\nTaking the limit as  0, we obtain\nlim\n\nF,\n=\nq\nF\n(\u00b5) if q\nI\nF\n(\u00b5)\nq\n [q\nF\n(\u00b5), q\nI\nI\nF\n(\u00b5)\nwhere\nq\nF\n(\u00b5) :\n\nX(q\nF\n(\u00b5)) + Q\nmax{q(q\nF\n(\u00b5)), p(, q\nF\n(\u00b5))}\n-  \u00b5Fd = \nand\nq\nI\n\u00b5\n(F + Q) 1 -\nF\nmax{q(q\nI\nI\n)}\n+ Sq(1, , q\nI\n(1)) d = F\n\nI,\n= q\nI\n\nI,\n= q\n [q\nF\n(\u00b5), q\nI\n(1)] depending on whether q\nI\nF\n(\u00b5).\nNotice that q\nF\n(\u00b5) < \n(\u00b5) since q() > X(). It follows that asset price guarantees strictly\ndecrease market liquidity risk in both weak and strong dependence regimes. By putting a lower bound\non asset prices, the government also props up funds' residual equity value and thereby strictly decreases\nfunding liquidity risk: i.e. q\nI\n(1). Also, notice that funds still acquire information for values of\n < max{q\nF\n(\u00b5), q\n}, implying that the government will be forced to purchase bad assets at an inflated\nprice in those states. Given some price floor q > X(), the expected cost of asset price guarantees\nequals\n\n\n(min{q\nI\n}, )F(1-(max{q\nF\n(\u00b5), q\n}, )) max 1 -\np((max{q\nF\n(\u00b5), q\n}, ))\nq()\nwhich simplifies to\nmax{q\nF\n(\u00b5),q\n}\n\n<q\nX()\nq()\n3. Outright Debt Purchases. We consider outright debt purchases that reduce the fraction of redeemable\nclaims, . Differentiating the system of equations (A5)-(A6) with respect to , we obtain\nA\n\n=\nS\n(, \u00b7)d > 0 and\nB\n\n=\n\u00b5\nW\n(; \u00b7)d > 0\nBy the implicit function theorem, we then have\nd\nF,\nd\nd\nI,\nd\nso that market liquidity and funding liquidity risk are both increasing in the fraction of redeemable\nclaims. For  = 0, the equilibrium thresholds that solve (A5)-(A6) simplify to \nF,\n= \nI,\n= .\nBibliography\nAcharya, V. V., H. Almeida, and M. Campello (2013). Aggregate Risk and the Choice\nAkerlof, G.
