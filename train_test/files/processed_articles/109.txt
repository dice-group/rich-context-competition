Market participants' trading behavior and the resulting contagion effects are said\nto have amplified the rather modest losses in the US subprime sector and contributed to\nthe spread of the crisis on a global scale (Brunnermeier, 2009; Hellwig, 2009). In response\nto these disturbances, many central banks resorted to unconventional measures in order to\ncontain the crisis. The effectiveness of these measures in reducing fire sales has, however,\nhardly been assessed.\nTherefore, this paper looks at German banks' proprietary trading to analyze how the\nunconventional monetary policy measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) affected\nbanks' trading behavior after the Lehman collapse. The default of Lehman Brothers can\nbe seen as a shock to the German banking system that was both unexpected and exoge-\nnous, which makes this setting ideal for studying banks' trading reactions. The shock\nreduced banks' liquidity due to the drying-up of interbank markets (see, e. g., Abbassi,\nBr\u00a8\nauning, Fecht, and Peydr\u00b4\nof credit lines by special purpose vehicles. It also affected banks' solvency due to direct\nlosses from interbank exposures and negative returns on securities holdings. Both would\nbe expected to have raised the pressure for banks to conduct fire sales. However, uncon-\nventional monetary policy measures by the ECB \u00ad in particular, the full allotment policy\nand the extension of the collateral framework \u00ad may have reduced the need for banks to\nconduct fire sales and may have relaxed the pressure on funding and market liquidity.\nWith increased liquidity provision by the central bank, funding from private sources is\nreplaced by central bank funding, making liquidity shocks much less harmful.\nOur analysis is based on a unique trade-level dataset for the German banking sector.\nThe paper answers two main research questions: First, is there any evidence of fire sales\nof German banks after the Lehman collapse? And second, did banks' trading behavior\nchange after the ECB implemented unconventional monetary policy measures? The em-\nployed dataset covers all trades by all German banks in all assets that are eligible for\ntrade on a regulated market in the European Economic Area (EEA). Thus, it contains\na wide range of asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, derivatives and futures), including\nthe over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in these assets. This makes it possible to not\nonly distinguish between different asset classes but also between banks' securities trading\nbehavior in exchanges and OTC markets.\nIn order to assess the impact of unconventional monetary policy measures, we match\nthe data with the daily list of ECB-eligible assets and divide them up into narrow basket\nassets, extended basket assets, never eligible bonds, and never eligible stocks.1 We also\ngroup banks according to the significance of fire sale constraints, as predicted by economic\ntheory. Specifically, banks with a weak liquidity position and a low regulatory capital ratio\nare more likely to conduct fire sales. We then study the investment behavior of banks\nor bank groups in different eligibility classes around the Lehman crisis and the ECB's\nunconventional monetary policy measures. In addition, we analyze price reactions at the\nsecurity level, depending on the securities' eligibility status and banks' trading behavior.\n1Narrow basket assets are eligible for central bank transactions in normal times, including many\nsovereign bonds. Extended basket assets became eligible with the extension of the ECB's Collateral\nBasket on 22 October 2008. The other two groups never became eligible.\nOur results suggest that the Lehman crisis did not trigger broad-based fire sales in the\nGerman banking system. Instead, banks increasingly invested in narrow basket assets,\nwhich points towards a flight to liquidity. In line with this interpretation, banks sold\nnever eligible bonds in response to the introduction of full allotment whereas the exten-\nsion of the collateral basket induced large purchases of newly eligible assets. Hence, the\nresults indicate that the monetary policy measures were an important driver of banks'\ntrading decisions. Trades reflected a portfolio rebalancing in response to the crisis and to\nmonetary policy measures rather than distressed selling. The eligibility of securities had\na strong impact on banks' trading behavior. Interestingly, with the support of central\nbank liquidity, German banks on the whole acted as market liquidity providers during the\nHowever, looking at the prices of selling transactions, we find evidence of tight market\nliquidity, especially directly after the collapse of Lehman. Interestingly, this seems to have\nbeen driven mainly by trades in OTC markets. As expected, tight market liquidity does\nnot affect eligible assets to the same extent. Hence, through their effect on the eligibility\nof securities, unconventional monetary policy measures mitigated the pressure on market\nliquidity. These results support the view that the ECB's policy measures contributed to\nstabilizing the financial system after the Lehman collapse.\nWe also find that there is a heterogeneity across bank groups. Relatively illiquid banks\ninvest in narrow basket assets and sell ineligible bonds, trying to improve their liquidity\npositions. By contrast, relatively liquid banks invest in extended basket assets and stocks,\nallowing them to collect higher returns. Weakly capitalized banks move into riskier bonds,\nwhich may be evidence of risk-shifting. In line with economic theory, the tightening of\nmarket liquidity after the Lehman collapse appears to have been largely driven by banks\nconstrained by liquidity or capital. Hence, it seems that the fire sale mechanism did,\nindeed, exist in the German banking sector after the Lehman collapse. However, it was\nmuted by monetary policy responses.\nDespite of the importance attached to fire sale externalities in the recent crisis, em-\npirical evidence is scarce. There are a number of papers analyzing low frequency balance\nsheet data, such as De Haan and Van den Ende (2013) and Boyson, Helwege, and Jindra\n(2014). De Haan and Van den Ende (2013) employ monthly balance sheet data for seven-\nteen large Dutch banks and find evidence of fire sales, triggered by liquidity constraints.\nBoyson et al. (2014) use quarterly balance sheet data for US banks, investment banks,\nand hedge funds and do not find any evidence of liquidity-driven fire sales. Other papers\nhave used data on mutual funds. For example, Coval and Stafford (2007) show that even\nin the pre-crisis period outflows from investment funds could create price pressure in se-\ncurities held in common by distressed funds. Manconi, Massa, and Yasuda (2012) find\nthat the trading behavior of institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may lead\nto a propagation of distress to other asset classes, in this case from securitized bonds to\ncorporate bonds. Finally, Ellul, Jotikasthira, and Lundblad (2011) provide evidence of fire\nsales in the insurance sector in response to regulatory constraints becoming binding after\na shock to the companies' capital. Even less is known about the effects of unconventional\nmonetary policy on banks' trading behavior.3 Our paper contributes to this literature by\n2See De Roure (2016) for an analysis of the purchase prices of ECB-eligible securities, which shows\nthat banks' trading behavior induced a price premium in eligible assets.\n3Acharya and Steffen (2015) analyze the impact of the unconventional longer-term refinancing opera-\nproviding evidence on German banks' securities trading after the Lehman shock and by\nexplicitly focusing on how monetary policy measures affect banks' trading behavior.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical background and\nthe data. Section 3 presents the empirical specifications as well as the aggregate results\nfor all banks, analyzing trading volumes first and then transaction prices. In Section 4,\nwe allow for heterogeneous bank reactions and distinguish between different bank groups\naccording to their liquidity and capital positions, again considering trading volumes and\ntransaction prices. Section 5 contains the conclusion.\n2 Theoretical Background and Data\n2.1 The Fire Sale Mechanism\nIn theory, contagion through fire sale externalities works as follows. In response to a shock\nto the value of assets or a sudden withdrawal of liabilities, banks may be forced to sell\nassets if a liquidity or leverage constraint becomes binding. Given the forced nature of the\nsales, prices might deviate from fundamental values in the presence of financial frictions.\nTherefore, distress sales of assets may depress market prices, which may then feed back\ninto the banking sector through common exposures. If banks holding the same assets\nhave to recognize distressed prices on their balance sheets, they might have to sell assets\nas well, leading to an expansion of the crisis (see, e. g., Allen and Gale (2004); Cifuentes,\nHence, the occurrence and intensity of fire sales in response to a shock hinge on banks\nbeing constrained. The first is a liquidity constraint. If banks are unable to refinance a\npart of their balance sheet, they are forced to sell assets to generate the liquidity needed\nto repay the debt (the classical Diamond and Dybvig (1983) case, see also Allen and Gale\n(2000) and Allen and Gale (2004)). Margin calls could have a similar effect. The less\nliquidity a bank has beforehand, the stronger the reaction is expected to be. The second\nis a leverage constraint. If banks experience losses, e. g. due to failing counterparties after\nLehman's bankruptcy, this could result in a lack of regulatory capital, inducing asset sales\nto \"free up\" regulatory capital (Cifuentes et al. (2005)). As long as the assets sold have\nregulatory risk weights above zero, this relaxes the pressure on capital. Sales are most\nlikely to occur at banks that already had low regulatory capital ratios to begin with.\nThese banks will also find it harder to absorb higher costs for refinancing liabilities (e. g.,\nincreasing haircuts) during a period of stress.5 Given these theories about bank behavior,\nwe expect that banks with less liquidity and less capital are more prone to sell assets\ntions in 2011 and 2012 on bank exposures, but they do not focus on the immediate central bank measures\nin the aftermath of the crisis. Hildebrand, Rocholl, and Schulz (2012) analyze bank investments after\nthe financial crisis but are not able to disentangle the effects of the Lehman default and the subsequent\ncentral bank policy measures due to the quarterly frequency of their data.\n4Hellwig (2009) argues that price effects were reinforced by mark-to-market accounting. However, the\nrole of mark-to-market pricing has been questioned by Laux and Leuz (2010) who note that fire sale\nprices do not necessarily have to be recognized on the balance sheet. According to Gorton and Metrick\n(2012), fire sales can also occur in the shadow banking sector and spill over to the regulated sector.\n5 Adrian and Shin (2010, 2014) show that financial institutions may target a specific ratio of value-at-\nrisk to equity, making leverage procyclical. This could also give rise to fire sales. However, as they show,\nsuch behavior can be found empirically for US broker dealers, in particular.\nfollowing the shock from Lehman's bankruptcy.\n2.2 The Role of Eligibility\nTrading behavior is expected to differ across different types of securities. When it comes\nto liquidity, the most important characteristic of an asset is its employability in repo\ntransactions. By \"repoing\" an asset, a bank can obtain funds without having to sell the\nasset on the market. Therefore, we classify our assets according to their eligibility for\nECB refinancing operations. Assets that were not eligible at any point in 2008 (mostly\nstocks, investment funds, certificates, options, bonds) are labeled \"never eligible assets\".\nAssets that were eligible before the ECB's collateral extension on 22 October 2008 or\nafter 14 November 2008 are the \"narrow basket assets,\" and those that became eligible\nin the meantime are the \"extended basket assets.\"6 The never eligible assets are rather\nheterogeneous. Therefore, we further split the never eligible assets into \"never eligible\nbonds\" that were never eligible in 2008 and \"never eligible stocks\", covering stocks, cer-\ntificates, options and the like. Note that the narrow and the extended basket also consist\npredominantly of bonds, which makes it easy to compare them with the group of \"never\neligible bonds,\" whereas the \"never eligible stocks\" are very heterogeneous.\nThe assets most prone to being sold in response to a shock are the ineligible ones.\nUnlike eligible assets, they cannot be used for repo transactions with the central bank\nor in interbank markets. In order to improve the regulatory capital position, selling\nineligible assets seems also appropriate because their average risk weight is higher.7 The\nmodels cited in the previous subsection do not introduce a central bank acting as a lender\nof last resort. In a crisis, the lender of last resort should \u00ad provided there is sufficient\ncollateral \u00ad lend freely to solvent banks to keep the financial system liquid. After the\nLehman collapse in 2008, the European Central Bank (ECB) accomplished this task\nmainly by introducing two unconventional monetary policy measures. First, it converted\nthe normal refinancing operations with banks to a fixed tender procedure on 8 October\n(announcement) and 15 October (implementation). This implied that, given sufficient\ncollateral, banks could obtain as much liquidity as they wanted. Under this regime, the\nonly reason for short-term liquidity problems is a lack of eligible collateral. In order to\navoid a potential lack of collateral, the ECB extended the range of eligible collateral on\n15 October (announcement) and 22 October (implementation) by reducing the rating\nthreshold to BBB-. Between 22 October and 14 November the ECB added assets to this\nextended collateral basket, increasing the number of eligible assets from around 26,000\nto more than 50,000 (see the lower right-hand graph of Figure 1). Consequently, the\noutstanding volume of eligible collateral increased from around 9 trillion in 2007 to nearly\nlower quality than the assets that had already been eligible before (the narrow basket\nassets) and were consequently subject to a higher haircut. Still, after the extension of the\ncollateral basket, banks holding such assets could easily generate liquidity by using them\n6We end the extended basket period on 14 November, as the number of eligible assets stops increasing\nafter this date (see the lower right-hand graph of Figure 1). It seems that the ECB's collateral policy\nreturned to normal after this point. Defining all newly eligible assets after 14 November until the end of\nthe sample period as \"extended basket assets\" does not change our results.\n7For example, stocks and derivatives are typically subject to a 100% risk weight, while government\nbonds, which are an important part of eligible assets, are often subject to a 0% risk weight.\nin a repo transaction with the central bank without having to sell them, or any other\nassets, to generate liquidity.\nFull allotment should generally lead to an improvement in banks' liquidity positions,\nwhich would, in turn, help to prevent liquidity-induced sales. As a result, investing in nar-\nrow basket assets became more attractive as they could be employed in repo transactions\nto an unlimited extent from that point onwards. It could even generate an incentive to\ncreate riskier narrow basket assets to be used in central bank transactions.8 In this way,\nbanks were able to increase their return on assets without affecting their liquidity posi-\ntions. By contrast, extended basket assets were not yet attractive at this point in time.\nYet, when these assets became eligible, they were suddenly a great deal more attractive\nbecause they then provided better liquidity services while yielding higher returns than\nnarrow basket assets at the same time. Given the higher haircut that extended basket\nassets were subject to, liquidity-constrained banks may nevertheless have found narrow\nbasket assets more attractive. In contrast, ineligible assets became relatively unattractive\nat this point, regardless of their relatively high returns. Therefore, one would expect that\nbanks sell ineligible assets in order to invest the proceeds in eligible assets. Especially\nextended basket assets, which have a higher coupon than the narrow basket assets on\naverage, would offer a relatively attractive return while providing better liquidity services\nthan stocks or ineligible bonds.\nThe analysis is based on several data sources. The main source is from the German Fed-\neral Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). This unique data set is based on reporting\nrequirements laid out in \u00a79 of the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandels-\ngesetz) under which all credit institutions and financial services institutions are required\nto report to the BaFin all transactions of all securities and derivatives that are admitted\nto being traded on an organized market in the EEA. The main objective of reporting is\nto prevent insider trading. Therefore, the dataset contains detailed trade information,\ni. e., the names of the trading bank and its counterparty, a dummy variable indicating\nwhether the bank's book was affected by the trade, the security identification number\nISIN, time and date of the trade as well as the transaction price, volume and currency\nand the exchange at which the trade took place.9 In total, roughly 1.2 million securities\nare potentially subject to reporting requirements. In our observation period from July\naround 24 million trades. In order to test for the representativeness of our data set, we\nmatched it with the Deutsche Bundesbank's Securities Holdings Statistics, which contain\ndetailed quarterly information on the securities holdings of all German banks in terms\nof volume (i. e., in euro), excluding derivatives ((Amann, Baltzer, and Schrape, 2012)).\n8In fact, this is what happened in the ABS market where some ABS were only created to be used as\ncentral bank collateral (\"originate to repo\", see European Central Bank (2013)).\n9If a transaction is conducted in OTC form, but the underlying security is permitted for trading in\nan organized market in the EEA, it still has to be reported to BaFin. Only derivatives such as CDS and\ninterest rate swaps, which are exclusively traded in OTC form, are not subject to reporting requirements\nunder this reporting framework.\nThe securities trading data set captures 64% to 97%10 of the trading volume calculated\non the basis of the Securities Holdings Statistics from 2008. Note that our dataset also\ncontains around 80,000 securities that do not appear in the Securities Holdings Statistics,\nwhich means they were traded and affected the banks' accounts but did not appear on\nthe banks' books at the end of the quarter.\nWe select our data sample in the following way. To begin with, we disregard all\ntrades with a price of zero and those where the trading bank is also the counterparty.\nTo control for bond issuance, we exclude all trades that take place before the issuance\ndate of the security and all trades by banks in their own bonds with a trade volume of\nover 1 billion. In addition, we only look at trades that have an impact on a bank's own\naccount. Customer trades are, therefore, not included in the analysis. We do not include\nany savings and cooperative banks, except for the ten largest ones of each bank group.\nThe small savings and cooperative banks delegate trading to their central institutions.\nThus, the informative value of the few trades contained in the data set is low. Banks that\nalready received state support before the Lehman crisis were not included in the data\nsample either. Finally, we disregarded all banks that traded on fewer than 21 days in\n2008. This procedure leaves us with 120 German banks (including foreign branches and\nsubsidiaries), which covers 95% of all trades included in the initial data set. These 120\nbanks represent 64% of total assets of the entire banking system in Germany. Further\ninformation on banks regarding their liquidity and solvency positions is collected from the\nBundesbank's Monthly Balance Sheet Statistics.\nThe information on asset classes (stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, cov-\nered bonds, CDOs, etc.) is obtained from the Centralised Securities Database (CSDB),\nwhile daily data on the eligibility of securities for the European System of Central Banks\n(ESCB) is obtained from the Eligible Assets Database (EADB). We restrict the sample\nand ten weeks after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008. While\nthe period before Lehman's demise was relatively calm, the financial crisis reached its\npeak in the aftermath of the bankruptcy. Several European banks were on the brink of\nfailure and had to be rescued, while interbank markets around the world dried up. Since\nbanks were no longer able to refinance themselves, they were at risk of becoming illiquid\nFor Germany, the demise of Lehman can be seen as an exogenous shock, since it was\nnot a result of the actions of German banks (see Brunnermeier (2009); Valukas (2010)),\nbut affected German banks' funding quite substantially (e. g., Hypo Real Estate lost its\nfunding and finally had to be nationalized). Therefore, the Lehman default provides an\nideal setting to study the reaction of banks to a large shock and to see whether such\nshocks give rise to fire sales.\nFigure 1 shows some descriptive characteristics of the dataset and illustrates how trad-\ning behavior was affected by both the crisis and monetary policy measures. In all of the\nfollowing figures, the three vertical red lines represent the following three events analyzed\nhere: first, the default of Lehman Brothers (15 September), second, the announcement of\n10The exact number depends on the interpretation of assets that are not held by any bank in one quarter\nin the Securities Holdings Statistics but by at least one bank in the following or preceding quarter. The\nshare captured is 64% if they are counted as traded and 97% if they are counted as newly issued or\nmatured.\nfull allotment (8 October), and, third, the introduction of the extended collateral basket\n(22 October). In the upper left- and right-hand panels, we see the gross (buy plus sell)\ntrading volume per day across all banks in the four eligibility classes. The narrow basket\nassets have the highest daily gross trading volume across the period under review. The\nmaximum value of 30 billion was reached on 8 October, i. e., the day that full allotment\nwas introduced and the interest rate cut was announced. The trade volume of shares and\nother non-eligible assets is slightly lower, with an average daily value of around 10 billion.\nNote that trading in both asset classes intensified around the Lehman collapse and the\npolicy interventions that followed. A different picture emerges for extended basket assets\nand never eligible bonds, which are only rarely traded in quantities larger than 2 billion.\nWe observe an increase in trading activity in extended basket assets towards the end of\nour sample period, starting in the week following the announcement to expand the col-\nlateral framework on 15 October. While never eligible bonds were traded only in small\nquantities prior to this expansion, values beyond 2 billion became more common after\nthe event. These aggregate trading patterns suggest that trading behavior changed due\nFigure 1: Descriptive graphs\nEuro\nnarrow basket never eligible stocks\nGross trade volume per eligibility class (1)\nEuro\nextended basket never eligible bonds\nGross trade volume per eligibility class (2)\nnarrow basket extended basket\nnever eligible stocks never eligible bonds\nNumber of trading banks per eligibility class\nNumber of eligible assets\nFigure 1 shows some descriptive timelines.

The lower\nright-hand graph shows the daily number of eligible assets. Sources: Microdatabase Securities Holdings\nto the events that took place in September and October 2008. A similar conclusion can\nbe drawn from the chart in the lower left-hand panel, which shows the number of banks\ntrading in an eligibility class on a given day. There are around 60 banks trading each\nday with narrow basket assets and never eligible stocks. The number increased slightly\nafter the Lehman collapse and dropped again after the policy measures were launched in\nOctober. Never eligible bonds are traded on a permanent basis by more than 30 banks\nper day. For the extended basket assets, this number increased from 20 to nearly 30 after\nthe collateral extension. It thus seems that the collateral extension led to an increase in\ntrading activity regarding these assets. Finally, the chart on the lower right-hand side\nshows the daily number of ESCB eligible assets. The narrow basket contained around\n26,000 assets at the beginning of our sample. Then, with the introduction of the extended\nbasket, the number doubled; this meant that, towards the end of our sample period, the\n3 Empirical Analysis \u00ad Aggregate Results\nWe now discuss the econometric model and our results, focusing on the German banking\nsystem as a whole without distinguishing between different bank groups. Any net pur-\nchases or sales of assets must, in the aggregate, be absorbed by market participants that\nare not included in our sample, such as hedge funds, insurance companies or non-German\ninstitutions. In Section 4, we will proceed to analyze trading behavior of different bank\ngroups to allow for a situation where distressed banks trade within the banking sector.\nWe will start by taking a look at trading volumes before considering transaction prices.\n3.1 Empirical specification for trading volumes\nIn order to analyze the trading behavior of banks and their reactions to the Lehman\nshock as well as the two policy measures, we construct a measure of net trading volumes,\ncapturing the daily net purchasing volume for each eligibility class at the bank level. We\nfocus on net trading volumes in order to measure the liquidity generated or absorbed\nby the banks' trades. Let nj\ni,t\ncount all trades of bank i on day t in eligibility class j.\nWe calculate the total volume of each trade nj\ni,t\n, tradej\nnj\ni,t\n,i,t\n, as the product of the price\n(converted to euro using the end of day exchange rate from Bloomberg and divided by\n100 in case of a bond) and the nominal value (for bonds) or the quantity (for stocks and\nthe like), counting purchases as positive and sales as negative. We then sum these trade\nvolumes over nj\nti,\nand divide by the initial total assets of the bank as at June 2008, TAi\n,\nwhich gives us the weighted net purchasing volume of bank i in eligibility class j on day\nt, net buyj\ni,t\n:\nnet buyj\ni,t\n=\nNj\nt\n\nnj\nt\ntradej\nnj\ni,t\n,i,t\nThe weighting by the initial total assets reduces the dominance of large banks and allows\nus to depict the banking system as a whole.11 The weighted daily purchasing amount is\nmultiplied by 100 to get a percentage value. Further, note that we attribute the value\nzero when a bank did not trade an asset class on a given day.\nIn the econometric analysis, we examine how banks' trading behavior changed in re-\nsponse to the Lehman collapse as well as to unconventional monetary policy measures.\nIn the basic regression, the variable net buyj\ni,t\nis regressed on three event dummies. The\nfirst is the default of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, represented by the dummy\nLehmant\n, which equals one from 15 September to 7 October. The second is the an-\nnouncement of the full allotment policy on 8 October 2008, represented by the dummy\n, which equals one from 8 October until 21 October. Note that we use the announce-\nment of full allotment rather than the implementation one week later as it was clear that\nthe full allotment policy would affect only narrow basket securities, which were the only\neligible securities at the time. So in order to take advantage of the full allotment pol-\nicy, one would need narrow basket securities. The third event is on 22 October, when\nthe implementation of the extended collateral basket started. The corresponding dummy\nvariable extendedt\nequals one from 22 October until the end of the sample period. Here,\nwe use the implementation date instead of the announcement date, the reason being that\nthe announcement itself did not specify which securities would become eligible. Conse-\nquently, banks could not react in a targeted fashion until they saw which securities became\neligible following the implementation. Moreover, note that the new securities were added\nto the eligibility list over several days so that the impact of the implementation could be\nexpected to happen gradually. In an unreported robustness check, we also use the an-\nnouncement date as the relevant event. This does not affect our results qualitatively. All\nregressions include bank fixed effects. The basic regression model then looks as follows:\nnet buyj\ni,t\n= i\nLehmant\nExtendedt\n+ uj\ni,t\nwhere j = narrow basket, extended basket, never eligible stocks, never eligible bonds\nWe will illustrate the regression results by constructing graphs of average trading\nbehavior. To this end, we cumulate the weighted amount over time so that net buycum,j\ni,t\ndepicts the amount a bank has bought or sold in net terms in a certain eligibility class\nbetween t0\n(July 1, 2008) and time t, weighted by initial total assets:\nnet buycum,j\ni,t\n=\nt\n\nnet buyj\ni,tn\nFor the aggregate graphs, which show the German banking system's holdings (and thus\nits net trade with the rest of the world), we take daily averages over all banks.\n3.2 Results on trading volumes\nBelow, we discuss the regression results along with the graphical illustration. The main\nresults for the aggregate German banking system are given in Table 1 and depicted in\n11We also show results for the unweighted variable in Figure A2 in the appendix.\nFigure 2, which shows the aggregate cumulated net purchasing volume weighted by to-\ntal assets (Equation (3) averaged across all banks) for the period from 1 July until 30\nIn turn, we discuss the results for the four eligibility classes. The trading behavior in\nnarrow basket assets is depicted in the upper left-hand panel of Figure 2. On average,\nGerman banks made net purchases of narrow basket assets during the sample period.\nBetween July and November 2008, German banks bought narrow basket assets worth 4%\nof their balance sheet on average, with purchases accelerating sharply after the default\nof Lehman Brothers. Between 15 September and 8 October, the average net balance\nincreased by nearly 2 percentage points (relative to total assets), implying that the daily\nnet purchasing volume in this period was far higher than before the Lehman collapse or\nafter the full allotment announcement. In the regressions (Table 1), this is reflected in a\nhighly significant and large coefficient of the Lehman dummy (see column 1). In contrast,\nthe coefficients of the two other dummy variables are not significantly different from\nzero, meaning that net purchases returned to the pre-crisis trend. We do not observe\naggregate sales of narrow basket assets during the sample period. Hence, there is no\nevidence of fire sales of narrow basket assets, especially not in the post-Lehman period\nwhen money markets were most tense. Given that such assets could be used in central\nbank transactions, it is not surprising that rather than selling assets into a distressed\nmarket, they were reserved for repo transactions with the central bank.\nInstead, the opposite occurred, namely that banks bought narrow basket assets on a\nbroad scale in this period. There are several potential reasons why banks would buy a\ngreater volume of narrow basket assets. First, supply-side factors may have been at play.\nSince narrow basket assets are often government bonds, a higher issuance of government\ndebt securities \u00ad for which banks are usually important buyers \u00ad might be responsible for\nthe substantial increase in narrow basket holdings after Lehman. However, the issuance\nof German government debt securities increased only slightly from 51 billion to 57 bil-\nlion from the second to the third quarter of 2008. (Note also that the issuance volume\nis planned one year in advance and finally determined one quarter before the actual is-\nsuance date.) Furthermore, an increased supply could stem from non-German financial\ninstitutions or German non-banks. In this case, the massive increase after Lehman could\nbe interpreted as German banks acting as the provider of market liquidity for institutions\nnot included in our sample, which are conducting fire sales. Some evidence for this inter-\npretation can be found in Abbassi, Iyer, Peydr\u00b4\nbanks invested mainly in assets of which the price had previously fallen. Second, demand-\nside factors may have played a role. As narrow basket securities provide access to central\nbank and interbank repo funding, they represent a valuable investment in the context\nof a liquidity crisis.13 This is especially true as collateralized interbank markets became\nincreasingly popular in the crisis period (see, e. g., Mancini, Ranaldo, and Wrampelmeyer\n(2016)), which have even stricter collateral requirements compared with the ECB (see\n12Note that the graphs depict cumulated series so that the regressions refer to the first difference of\nthe graphs shown.\n13Assuming that the Lehman shock reduced the liquidity of many financial assets and claims, another\nunderlying reason for the net purchase of narrow basket assets could be that banks tried to reestablish a\ngiven liquidity level on the asset side of their balance sheet by buying more liquid assets as in Froot and\nalso European Central Bank (2013) for the use of collateral of European banks with the\nFigure 2: Aggregate cumulated net purchasing volumes by eligibility class\n%\nNarrow basket\n%\nExtended basket\n%\nNever eligible bonds\n%\nNever eligible stocks\nThe figure shows the net (purchases \u00ad sales) euro trading volume of all 120 banks, weighted by each\nbank's total assets as at June 2008, averaged per day and cumulated over days, for all assets grouped\nby their ECB eligibility. Increases reflect an expansion in asset holdings while decreases represent net\nsales. The graphs show the evolution of the trade balance of the German banking system with the rest\nof the world. The red bars indicate from left to right: the default of Lehman Brothers (15 Sep), the\nannouncement of full allotment (8 Oct) and the introduction of the extended basket (22 Oct). Sources:\nDeutsche Bundesbank.\nIn the upper right-hand panel of Figure 2, we see the average net purchases of ex-\ntended basket assets. Until after the announcement of full allotment, banks tended to be\nnet sellers of these securities on average. The numbers are small compared with narrow\n14Instead of using cash, which would not directly increase the banks' liquidity, banks could tap the\nfollowing funding sources to finance the purchase of narrow basket assets: central bank liquidity via\nrepoed credit claims or asset-backed securities (some banks engaged in so-called \"originate to repo\"\nactivities, i. e., they originated ABS in the crisis with the sole purpose of using them as central bank\ncollateral, see European Central Bank (2013)) or sales of ineligible assets. In fact, Podlich (2016) shows\nthat distressed German banks sold roughly 60 billion worth ineligible assets in the fourth quarter of 2008,\nusing quarterly data from the Securities Holdings Statistics. Distressed banks are defined as banks which\nreceived government support between 2007 and 2011. Not all those banks are in our sample, because we\nexclude banks that received government support before our sample period begins.\nTable 1: Results without bank heterogeneity\nLHS: narrow basket extended basket nev. elig. bonds nev. elig. stocks\nBank FE yes yes yes yes\nRegressions for eligibility classes at the bank level without bank heterogeneity. The variable on the\nleft-hand side is the net purchasing volume of each bank, weighted by its total assets as at end of June\nDeutsche Bundesbank.\nbasket assets as extended basket assets are traded infrequently. However, we see a small\nselling tendency after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which intuitively makes sense\nas these assets are, on average, less liquid and riskier. Most importantly, they did not\nprovide access to central bank liquidity until the collateral extension took effect. What\nis more, banks started buying these assets on a large scale exactly on the date the collat-\neral extension was announced (15 September 2008). The regression results confirm the\ngraphical impression (see column 2 of Table 1). Net purchases are smaller in the post-\nLehman period than before but the difference is not statistically significant. However, we\nsee a positive and significant coefficient after the extension of the collateral basket, the\ncoefficient being much smaller than that for narrow basket assets, as expected.\nIt seems that the ESCB eligibility status made extended basket assets significantly\nmore attractive for banks. The reason is straightforward: From this point on, they could\nbe repoed for liquidity with the ECB so that buying these assets did not impair the\nliquidity position of the bank. Furthermore, they had on average a higher coupon and\nthus were more rewarding for banks to hold than, e. g., narrow basket securities. It thus\nappears that banks were engaging in risk-shifting by collecting the coupon on riskier\nassets but offloading part of the risk at the ECB. This complements the \"carry trade\"\nfinding of Acharya and Steffen (2015) who argue that banks borrowed from the ECB to\ngenerate exposure to high-yield euro-peripheral countries (which, however, would be part\nof the narrow basket). These results also help us interpret the findings on the narrow\nbasket assets. Given that eligibility appears to make an asset very attractive, it seems\nplausible that banks were buying narrow basket assets to prop up their liquidity pool.\nThis trading behavior also changed banks' portfolio composition. Using the Securities\nHoldings Statistics, which includes a quarterly snapshot of all securities held by German\nbanks, we see that relative to their total assets as at the end of June 2008, banks in our\nsample increased their holdings of narrow basket assets by 2.7% between the second and\nthird quarter of 2008, and their holdings of extended basket assets by 341% between the\nThe lower left-hand panel of Figure 2 illustrates the aggregate holdings of never eligible\nbonds. As can be seen, banks invested in these bonds before the Lehman crisis but largely\nceased to do so once Lehman crashed. Banks became net sellers of never eligible bonds\nafter the FA announcement and also briefly after the extended basket implementation,\nbefore purchases rise again towards the end of our sample. In the regressions this shows\nup in a mildly significant negative coefficient in the full allotment period (column 3 of\nTable 1). The results for never eligible stocks are less clear (lower right-hand graph of\nFigure 2). This is not entirely surprising as this asset class consists mostly of stocks and\nderivatives; these are often used by banks in the context of market making and hedging\nactivities, potentially making it hard to detect a particular trading strategy. Generally\nspeaking, banks sold these assets before the Lehman crisis and a remarkable downward\njump occurs at the time of the Lehman collapse, with banks selling 0.1% of their average\nbalance sheet total on average. This development resembles fire sale behavior, but is\nreversed immediately and the same amount is repurchased between the Lehman event and\nthe full allotment period. The reactions to both policy measures were positive. Purchases\nincreased after full allotment was announced and the extended basket implemented. In\nthe regressions, only the coefficient of the full allotment dummy is statistically significant\nand very large (column 3 of Table 1). The sharp increase in holdings immediately after\nthe FA announcement might indicate that banks were either increasingly willing to hold\nriskier securities after being assured that they would have access to the central bank\nliquidity (a demand effect) or that they purchased a large amount of assets because they\nwere supplied by other market participants.\nThese results are interesting as we see that trading reactions for bonds differ markedly\ndepending on the bonds' eligibility status. While banks buy bonds that can be used to\ngenerate central bank liquidity, they tend to sell bonds that do not. From a liquidity\nperspective, this seems reasonable as the only way to generate liquidity with ineligible\nassets is to sell the assets. This complements the finding by Beber, Brandt, and Kavajecz\n(2009), who study transactions in the European bond market and find that, compared\nwith normal times, the market liquidity of bonds becomes more important for the invest-\nment decision \u00ad relative to credit quality \u00ad during periods of distress. Note also that never\neligible bonds being sold off supports the hypothesis that the increased build-up of never\neligible stocks is supply-driven. As never eligible bonds can be regarded as the riskiest\nof our bond classes, they are most similar to stocks or derivatives regarding risk charac-\nteristics. If the increased holdings of these assets had been incited by a rise in demand\nby banks for risky assets, we should have been able to observe an increase in holdings of\nriskier bonds as well.\nThere are two potential factors that could bias our analysis. First, banks might sell\nlarge quantities of assets at decreasing prices. This could mask large-scale sales in our\nanalysis as we are multiplying quantities and prices. In Figure A1 in the appendix, we\ntherefore show results using only the quantities without multiplying the prices. With the\n15The initial holdings of extended basket assets are very low, which makes the increase in absolute\nterms relatively small. Further note that the numbers are not directly comparable between the two\ndatabases since maturing assets change total holdings in the Securities Holdings Statistics, but not in our\ntrading-based dataset.\nexception of stocks, where banks, indeed, seem to have sold cheaper assets (or purchased\nmore expensive assets), the results are comparable to Figure 2. Note, however, that the\n\"never eligible stocks\" also consist of all types of options and other derivatives, which\nmeans that price differences between securities in sales and purchases can quickly arise\n(for instance, a bank can sell options at low prices and hedge this by buying the underlying\nsecurities, which are usually more costly). Moreover, by weighting the net purchases with\nbanks' total assets large-volume sales by big banks could potentially go unnoticed. We\ntherefore also show the results for unweighted net purchases (again, multiplying quantities\nand prices) in Figure A2. Here too, the results for narrow and extended basket assets\nare very similar to the results presented in Figure 2. For never eligible stocks, we find\nthat the size of banks has an impact, which is intuitive given that large and small banks\nengage in derivative trading to different degrees. The results for never eligible bonds also\ndiffer. In unweighted terms, banks sold never eligible bonds in substantial quantities on\nbalance, suggesting that these sales are attributable to large banks, in particular.\nThe regressions in Table 1 are conducted at bank level to identify the liquidity gen-\nerated by banks' trading behavior at the individual bank level. It is also instructive to\nconsider the trading behavior at the individual security level and to check whether di-\nvergent reactions can also be found with respect to an asset's eligibility status at that\ndisaggregated level. The regressions at the ISIN level confirm the results from the pre-\nceding analysis (see Table 2). Once again, we see a shift towards narrow basket assets\n(starting after the Lehman collapse) and extended basket assets (after the introduction\nof the extended basket). Moreover, never eligible bonds are sold, in particular after the\nintroduction of full allotment. Finally, we observe an overall shift into never eligible stocks\nas before.\nTable 2: Results for regressions at ISIN level\nLHS: narrow basket extended basket nev. elig. bonds nev. elig. stocks\nISIN FE yes yes yes yes\nRegressions for eligibility classes at ISIN level.

Standard errors are clustered at the ISIN level.\np-values in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. Sources: own calculations, Bafin, ECB.\nSumming up, we observe that banks were, on the whole, net buyers of assets during the\nLehman crisis. The eligibility of assets was a key determinant of the trading decisions of\nbanks, which tended to buy eligible assets and sell ineligible assets. This can be seen as a\nreaction by banks to the tense liquidity situation following the Lehman bankruptcy when\ninterbank markets dried up and banks started hoarding liquidity (Acharya and Merrouche\n(2013)). However, no evidence of large-scale aggregate fire sales by banks can be found\nin any of the asset classes considered in the trading data. Therefore, we now turn to the\nanalysis of transaction prices.\n3.3 Empirical specification for transaction prices\nEven though the analysis of trading volumes provides no evidence of fire sale behavior,\nthere may nevertheless have been pressure on market liquidity after the Lehman collapse.\nIn a next step, we therefore take a look at the evolution of prices. More specifically, we\nwant to know whether banks' trading activity had an impact on security prices in the\ntime period under review. Our focus shifts from a bank-level to a security-level analysis.\nIn order to capture banks' aggregate trading behavior, we compute the daily net\npurchasing volume across all banks for each ISIN k:16\nnet buyk,t\n=\nNk,t\n\ntradenk,t,k,t\nThis variable represents the net volume of a particular asset traded with investors outside\nof the German banking system. Insofar as these can be viewed as outside investors in the\nspirit of Shleifer and Vishny (1992), price effects are most likely to be found in such trades.\nThe higher the selling volume to outside investors, the greater the effect on prices should\nbe. A similar approach can be found in Nyborg and \u00a8\ntrading volumes with price changes. As fire sale prices are associated with selling, we focus\nexclusively on selling prices. Net trading volumes can vary considerably across individual\nassets, and the ultimate price impact depends on an individual asset's liquidity features.\nConsequently, a bias towards zero can arise if assets traded with outside investors in large\nquantities are relatively liquid. We take logs of our explanatory variables for this reason.\nAs net buy can have positive and negative values, we use the log-modulus transformation\nto preserve the sign and the zeros:\nlog(net buyk,t\n) = sign(net buyk,t\n)  log(1 + |net buyk,t\nIn addition, the selling price may be influenced by the size of the trade, quantitynk,t,k,t\n.\nIn liquid markets, the quantity of a trade may not be of great significance. In times of\ncrisis, however, selling prices are likely to decrease with the size of the trade.\nHence, the basic regression establishes a link between selling prices and the quantity\nof a trade, as well as the overall net purchasing volume for all banks, as defined above:\nsell pricenk,t,i,k,t\n= i\n+ t\n+ kp\n+ log(quantitynk,t,k,t\n) + log(net buyk,t\n) + unk,t,i,k,t\n16In this section, we focus only on bonds as this is the largest and most important asset class. Further,\nthe analysis uses a relatively homogeneous pool of assets with comparable prices.\nWe control for bank fixed effects i\n, time fixed effects t\n, and ISIN\u00d7period fixed\neffects for the pre-Lehman, post-Lehman, full allotment and extended basket periods.\nThis allows us to control for any bank-specific and time-specific heterogeneity in prices.\nFurthermore, the ISIN\u00d7period fixed effects estimate a base price for each asset in each\nperiod. This is important as the underlying bonds are still relatively diverse so that the\ntime fixed effects cannot fully capture the exogenous shifts in asset prices for all assets\njointly. The main coefficient of interest is , relating to the overall net purchasing volume\nof a given asset. If  is positive, the correlation between banks' net purchasing volume\nwith outside investors and the prices that banks face in asset sales is positive. This would\nmean that a higher selling volume to outside investors (i. e., a negative net purchasing\nvolume) is associated with lower selling prices, which suggests price pressure or fire sale\nprice behavior.\nA favorable aspect of our dataset is that we can distinguish OTC transactions from\ntrades at exchanges. To obtain a better understanding of the often mentioned yet rarely\nstudied OTC markets, we carry out separate calculations of net trading volumes for\nOTC transactions and exchange transactions and compare the results of the two types\nof trades. Given that exchanges and OTC markets are fundamentally different regarding\nmarket participation, price setting mechanisms and regulation, effects may vary.\n3.4 Results on transaction prices\nTable 3 contains the results for the regressions of all trades (OTC and exchange). Column\n1 of the table shows that there is, indeed, an immediate price impact stemming from the\ntrade's volume: Selling prices tend to be lower, the higher the volume a bank attempts\nto trade. This suggests a lack of market liquidity in bond markets. More importantly,\nprices also appear to be lower when the banking sector as a whole records a high volume\nof net sales to outside investors. In the regressions in column 2, we allow for different\nprice impacts in different subperiods. The results show that the effect of aggregate net\nsales is driven by the post-Lehman period, whereas net purchase volumes are not related\nto prices in the other periods. Hence, although the volume regressions did not find any\nevidence of fire sale behavior, there seems to have been tight market liquidity in the post-\nLehman period, reflected in strong reactions by prices to trading volumes. This result\nis plausible since market conditions can be expected to be worst immediately after the\nLehman collapse as there was only a small number of traders willing to provide market\nliquidity at that time.\nFinally, in column 3, we explore how the price impact differs between eligible and\nineligible assets. To that aim, we use the time-varying variable eligiblej,t\n, which equals\none whenever an individual asset is eligible, and interact it with the net purchasing volume\nto outside investors. The coefficient of the interaction term is negative and significant.\nAdding the coefficients on net buy and net buy \u02c7 eligible shows that the price impact for\neligible assets is close to zero in the pre-Lehman period. So, for this period, we find a\nprice impact only for ineligible assets, indicating that outside investors were willing to\nbuy eligible assets without a discount. This is plausible given that eligible assets are\noften government bonds, which are generally seen as the most liquid bonds. Moreover,\nbanks are not forced to sell such assets into a falling market. Instead of selling such\nassets, they could be used as collateral in central bank transactions, which would help\nTable 3: Results for price regressions at the transaction level without bank heterogeneity\nLHS: sell price sell price sell price\nDaily FE yes yes yes\nBank FE yes yes yes\nISIN*Period FE yes yes yes\nHere, we estimate regression Equation (6) using the prices of all bond sales as left-\nhand-side variable.

Standard errors are clustered at the ISIN\ncalculations, Bafin, ECB.\navoid negative price effects while also providing liquidity. In the period surrounding the\ncollapse of Lehman Brothers, the overall effect is also significant for eligible assets, but\nthe overall effect is more muted than for ineligible assets.\nTable 4 shows separate regressions for OTC trades and trades at exchanges. Columns 1\nto 3 show that the results for OTC trades are very similar to the previous ones. Most im-\nportantly, the coefficient of log(net buyj,t\n) is positive and highly significant, which is again\nlargely driven by the post-Lehman period and is stronger for ineligible assets. However,\nthere is also a significant effect for the extended basket period in columns 2 and 3. This\ncould stem from upward price pressure due to the high volume of purchases of extended\nbasket assets by banks in this period. In columns 4 to 6, we see the same regressions as\nin columns 1 to 3 for exchange trades only. Interestingly, we do not find any significant\npositive correlation of selling activity with prices. The coefficient of the net trade vol-\nume is even significantly negative in the post-Lehman period, which indicates that banks\nacted as market liquidity providers on exchanges following the Lehman collapse. It is\npossible that they were buying assets which had previously diminished in value, inducing\na negative correlation between trade volume and prices. The results suggest that mar-\nket liquidity for banks mainly deteriorated in OTC markets, especially after the Lehman\ncollapse, and mostly for ineligible assets. In the meantime, banks were market liquidity\nproviders on exchange markets after the Lehman event and made use of favorable trading\nopportunities by buying securities at comparatively low prices.\nTable 4: Results for price regressions at the transaction level without bank heterogeneity\nLHS: sell price sell price sell price sell price sell price sell price\nMarket: OTC OTC OTC Exchange Exchange Exchange\nDaily FE yes yes yes yes yes yes\nBank FE yes yes yes yes yes yes\nISIN*Period FE yes yes yes yes yes yes\nHere, we estimate regression Equation (6) using the prices of all over-the-counter (OTC) bond sales in columns\n1-3 and of all exchange-based bond sales in columns 4-6 as left-hand-side variable.

However, this approach does not take into account the potential\nheterogeneity within the German banking sector. For example, it could be the case that\nbanks facing a liquidity shortfall after Lehman's demise had to engage in a fire sale to\ngenerate liquidity while banks with ample liquidity purchased these assets, rendering the\naggregate effect zero. The same could be true for banks with high or low regulatory\ncapital ratios: While some might want to sell assets with a comparatively high regulatory\nrisk weight to relax the regulatory capital constraint, banks with more regulatory capital\nmight have had more risk-bearing capacities and purchased the assets that the stressed\nbanks sold.\nIn order to capture such effects, we divide the banks into groups according to their\nliquidity buffers and regulatory capital ratios, and study the evolution of asset holdings\nfor the respective groups. More specifically, we use bank balance sheets as at the end of\nJune 2008, before our investigation period began, in order to avoid endogeneity problems.\nAs before, we start by analyzing trading volumes before considering the effects on prices.\n4.1 Empirical specification for trading volumes\nEquation (2) looks at the German banking system's trading balance with respect to the\nrest of the world, and thus the extent to which the German banking system as a whole\nprovided or absorbed market liquidity. However, as we argued above, the events are likely\nto have a stronger impact on banks with fewer liquid assets and weaker capital positions.\nIn addition, it may be the case that, for example, banks with a higher level of liquidity\nprovide liquidity to less liquid banks, which would not be reflected in the aggregate, as\nthe sales and purchases offset each other.17 Consequently, important differences in the\nreactions of specific bank groups may be missed by Equation (2). Therefore, in line with\nthe important differences between banks cited above, we compare bank groups based on\ntwo balance sheet characteristics, which are computed using the Deutsche Bundesbank's\nMonthly Balance Sheet Statistics. First, we use the ratio of liquid assets to short-term\nliabilities, which indicates a bank's liquidity position, given the liabilities it has to repay\nin the weeks ahead. If the ratio is above one, a bank has enough liquidity to repay short-\nterm debt and is thus relatively independent of the money market. A ratio below one\nindicates that a bank either has to rely on the money market to roll over maturing debt\nor take on new debt to repay maturing contracts. If a bank is unable to do so, it has to\nsell off illiquid assets to service its obligations, which can potentially result in a fire sale.\nIn other words, the ratio is an indicator of the resilience of a bank to a stressed money\nmarket and unfavorable refinancing conditions.\nFurthermore, we use a measure regarding the capital position of a bank, namely the\nratio of tier-1 capital to risk weighted assets, which measures regulatory capital adequacy.\nThe lower the capital ratio, the worse the capital position of a bank. Consequently, these\nbanks are more vulnerable to price shocks as falling prices might translate into lower\nvaluations of assets on the balance sheet and may further reduce a bank's capital. Banks\ncloser to the minimum regulatory capital ratio should then be more eager to sell assets. To\nbuild up regulatory capital, banks ought to sell assets with a higher risk weight. In order\nto obtain a clean measure of a bank's position that is not distorted by the events studied\nhere, we use the balance sheets as at 30 June 2008. To facilitate interpretation, we split\nthe banks at the median of each ratio to form two bank groups for each characteristic.\nThe banks with less liquid assets or a lower capital ratio should have been hit harder\nby the Lehman default and should be the ones benefitting more from the unconventional\nmonetary policy measures.\nAgainst this backdrop, the regressions that take bank heterogeneity into account look\n17Given that weighting was carried out based on an individual bank's total assets, the numbers might\nnot add up to zero if the selling banks and the purchasing banks differ in size. Using unweighted holdings\nyields similar results, compare Figures A1 and A2 in the appendix.\nas follows:\nnet buyj\ni,t\n=i\nLehmant\nExtendedt\nLehmant\n risk groupi\n risk groupi\nExtendedt\n risk groupi\n+ uj\ni,t\n,\nfor j =narrow basket, extended basket, never eligible stocks, never eligible bonds\nWe interact the events with a dummy variable indicating riskier banks in terms of their\nliquidity or capital to check whether we can detect fire sales for certain bank groups. Here,\nrisk groupi\nstands for the dummies that indicate the riskier banks according to one of\nthe two characteristics. With respect to liquid assets to short-term liabilities, the dummy\nvariable equals one for the banks with a liquid assets to short-term liabilities ratio below\nthe median; for the tier-1 capital ratio it equals one for the banks with a tier-1 capital\nratio below the median.\n4.2 Results on trading volumes\nWe start by looking at banks with different levels of liquidity relative to their short-term\nobligations as at the onset of the Lehman crisis. We split banks at the median of the\ndistribution of liquid assets to short-term liabilities at the end of June 2008. Banks above\nthe median have more liquid assets compared with their possible short-term payment\nobligations; we therefore name them \"liquid banks.\" By extension, banks below the\nmedian are the \"less liquid banks.\" Results for the liquidity groups can be seen in Figure 3\nand Table 5. In the upper left-hand graph of Figure 3 we see the holdings of narrow\nbasket assets of the two bank groups. As illustrated, both groups started to invest more\nin narrow basket assets after the default of Lehman Brothers, with the increase being a\ngreat deal more pronounced for the less liquid banks (denoted by the red graph). A general\ntrend towards assets eligible to obtain central bank liquidity could be observed, although\nthis demand was more strongly driven by less liquid banks. This seems reasonable as\nbanks with less liquidity should increase their holdings of assets giving access to central\nbank liquidity, especially when (unsecured) interbank funding becomes scarce. Again, the\ngraphical results can be confirmed by the regression analysis in Table 5. We see that both\nbank groups, and less liquid banks in particular, shift into narrow basket assets after the\nLehman collapse (column 1).\nWhen looking at the results for extended basket assets in the upper right-hand graph\nof Figure 3, it is evident that we can attribute the sales of assets found in the aggregate to\nthe less liquid banks, which suggests that those banks tried to dispose of assets that could\nnot be used to generate central bank liquidity. However, the difference is not statistically\nsignificant (see column 2 of Table 5). Both types of banks shift into extended basket assets\nafter the collateral extension, but the effect is much stronger for liquid banks, which is\nreflected in a highly significant, negative and large coefficient of the respective interaction\nterm. This could be explained by the fact that extended basket assets provide lower\nliquidity services than narrow basket assets due to their higher haircut, while yielding a\nhigher return at the same time. Since haircuts are less of a concern for liquid banks, it\nseems plausible that banks with a stronger liquidity buffer were more prone to move into\nnewly eligible and more profitable assets.\nThe lower left-hand graph shows the results for never eligible bonds. It becomes ap-\nFigure 3: Aggregate cumulated net purchasing volumes by bank liquidity groups\n%\nliq assets to short term liab. above median below median\nNarrow basket\n%\nliq assets to short term liab. above median below median\nExtended basket\n%\nliq assets to short term liab. above median below median\nNever eligible bonds\n%\nliq assets to short term liab. above median below median\nNever eligible stocks\nFigure 3 divides banks in two groups according to the median of their liquid assets to short-term liabilities\nas at June 2008.

At this point, they rapidly disposed of these bonds, while liquid\nbanks gradually moved into never eligible bonds. These results are also reflected in the\nhighly significant and negative coefficients of the interactions terms for the full-allotment\nand extended-basket periods (see column 3 of Table 5). Yet even this sharp decrease in the\nnet purchasing volume can hardly be described as fire sales because the same bank group\nwas shifting into other assets at the same time. Hence, not even at the disaggregated\nlevel is there any evidence of fire sales.\nAnother interesting observation concerns the never eligible stocks in the lower right-\nhand panel. As was shown in Section 3, banks turned into net buyers of stocks and\nderivatives after the Lehman incident, which remained the case after the introduction of\npolicy measures. Here we see that the liquid banks in particular changed their behavior\nafter the demise of Lehman, shifting towards higher holdings of never eligible stocks. This\ndevelopment is reflected in significantly positive and large coefficients for liquid banks in\nthe regressions for the post-Lehman and full-allotment periods, whereas the effect for less\nTable 5: Results with bank heterogeneity: liquid assets to short-term liabilities\nRisk group: liquid assets to short-term liabilities\nLHS: narrow basket extended basket nev. elig. bonds nev. elig. stocks\nBank FE yes yes yes yes\nRegressions for eligibility classes at the bank level with bank heterogeneity.

Since the increase started directly after the Lehman\nevent, it seems unlikely that banks were unconditionally seeking exposure to never eligible\nassets. The more plausible reason is that this increase is attributable to a higher supply\nof these assets, which was taken up by the banks with the highest liquidity.\nNext, we study the effects of different levels of bank capital, measured in terms of the\nregulatory tier-1 capital ratio (see Table 6 and Figure 4). In general, highly capitalized\nbanks behave similarly to the aggregate: We observe a flight to liquidity, especially to\nnarrow basket assets, and a shift towards stocks. By contrast, less capitalized banks shift\nless into narrow basket assets and more into riskier extended basket assets. This could\nbe indicative of risk-shifting or \"search for yield\" behavior as extended basket assets are\nriskier on balance but also offer a higher coupon. This, too, is consistent with Acharya\nand Steffen (2015), who show that poorly capitalized banks exhibited a higher exposure to\nhigh-yield peripheral country bonds. Lastly, we see that less capitalized banks move out\nof never eligible stocks, whereas better capitalized banks record high net purchases. This\nsuggests that banks with a higher risk-bearing capacity bought these assets in response to\nan increased supply, partly due to less capitalized banks, which disposed of these assets\nas they had become too risky or too capital-intensive.\nAgain, the regression results are consistent with the graphical analysis (Table 6).\nBoth types of banks shift into narrow basket assets, the effect being much stronger for\nwell-capitalized banks. Both bank groups also shift into extended basket assets after the\nFigure 4: Aggregate cumulated net purchasing volumes by bank capital groups\n%\ntier1 ratio above median below median\nNarrow basket\n%\ntier1 ratio above median below median\nExtended basket\n%\ntier1 ratio above median below median\nNever eligible bonds\n%\ntier1 ratio above median below median\nNever eligible stocks\nFigure 4 divides banks in two groups according to the median of their tier-1 capital ratio (tier-1\nRWA\n) as at\nJune 2008.

We are particularly interested in testing whether the aggregate results on prices\nfrom the previous section are, indeed, driven by constrained banks having to accept less\nfavorable prices. Previous research on fire sales has focused on distressed entities and has\nfound that the selling prices of distressed firms are lower and their price impact larger\nthan for firms that are in good condition (Pulvino (1998), Coval and Stafford (2007), Ellul\net al. (2011), Chu (2016)). Consequently, we would expect that the price impact of trades\nby liquidity- or capital-constrained banks is higher than that of other banks. To study\nthis, we calculate the net purchasing volume per asset of constrained banks only and use\nTable 6: Results with bank heterogeneity: tier-1 ratio\nRisk group: tier-1 ratio\nLHS: narrow basket extended basket nev. elig. bonds nev. elig. stocks\nBank FE yes yes yes yes\nRegressions for eligibility classes at the bank level with bank heterogeneity.

Sources: own calculations, Bafin, ECB,\nDeutsche Bundesbank.\nthis as a further explanatory variable. The coefficient of this variable then shows the\nadditional effect of sales by constrained banks. The estimation equation looks as follows:\nsell pricenk,t,i,k,t\n= i\n+ t\n+ kp\n+   log(quantitynk,t,k,t\n log(net buyk,t\n log(net buyrisk group\nk,t\n) + unk,t,k,t\n4.4 Results on transaction prices\nColumn 1 of Table 7 shows the regression where we split the price impact between the\nfour subperiods and distinguish between banks that are constrained and those that are\nnot constrained in terms of their liquidity. While there is still a significant price impact of\ntrading by all banks, the net trading volume of liquidity-constrained banks has a signif-\nicant additional impact on selling prices in the post-Lehman period. This indicates that\nliquidity-constrained banks were, indeed, forced to accept lower prices. As we showed in\nSection 4, liquidity-constrained banks continued to act as net buyers of eligible assets; this\ndevelopment is therefore probably attributable to sales of ineligible assets. In column 2,\nwe see that the price impact of constrained banks for ineligible assets is, in fact, higher\nalthough the difference is not significant here. Results are similar for capital-constrained\nbanks (see columns 3 and 4).\nWe now distinguish again between OTC and exchange transactions. The results can be\nseen in Table A1 for liquidity-constrained banks and in Table A2 for capital-constrained\nTable 7: Results for price regressions at the transaction level with bank heterogeneity\nRisk group: liquid assets liquid assets tier-1 ratio tier-1 ratio\nLHS: sell price sell price sell price sell price\nDaily FE yes yes yes yes\nBank FE yes yes yes yes\nISIN*Period FE yes yes yes yes\nHere, we estimate regression Equation (8), using the transaction level prices of all bond sales as left-\nhand-side variable.

For OTC transactions, the results for liquidity-\nconstrained banks mirror the previous results (see columns 1 and 2 of Table A1). In\naddition, the interaction with the eligibility status becomes significant in these regressions.\nBy contrast, columns 3 and 4 show no significant additional impact of the trading of\nliquidity-constrained banks for exchange transactions, except for the marginally significant\ncoefficient for the full allotment period. So while there is clear evidence that the sales\ncarried out by liquidity-constrained banks in OTC markets contributed to OTC price\ndeclines, this does not seem to have been the case for trading prices on exchanges.\nIn Table A2 we see the results for capital-constrained banks. The results for OTC\nmarkets are now even stronger than in the regressions considering liquidity-constrained\nbanks. There is a significant relation between the selling volume of capital-constrained\nbanks and selling prices, especially in the post-Lehman period. And again, when we look\nat the results for exchange trades, there is no such relation, which suggests that only OTC\nmarkets were vulnerable to distressed selling by constrained banks.\nSumming up, we see that banks' selling prices depend on the amount of sales to outside\ninvestors, with selling prices being lower if the selling volume is higher. This relationship\nbecame more pronounced after the Lehman collapse and applied to liquidity- or capital-\nconstrained banks, in particular. However, these relationships hold only for OTC markets,\nwhile banks' trading volume has no impact on prices in the context of exchange markets,\nsuggesting that OTC markets are particularly vulnerable to adverse market conditions\nand to selling pressure from constrained banks.\n5 Conclusion\nUsing a detailed, trade-level dataset on the trading behavior of German banks around\nthe time of the Lehman collapse, we have shown that this disrupting event did not result\nin widespread fire sales in the German banking sector, either in the aggregate or within\ncertain bank groups. Instead, we observe a general flight to liquidity as all bank groups\nshift into the most liquid asset class, i. e., narrow basket assets, which can easily be\ntransformed into liquidity at the central bank. Moreover, trading behavior was influenced\nstrongly by unconventional monetary policy measures. In particular, the introduction\nof the extended basket led to a shift towards newly eligible assets. Hence, the observed\ntrades seem to have occurred largely as a result of portfolio rebalancing in response to\nmonetary policy measures rather than distress. Transactions prices show some evidence\nof tight market liquidity after the Lehman collapse. However, price pressures subsided\nonce full allotment was introduced. Overall, German banks acted both as market liquidity\nproviders and central bank liquidity seekers during the 2008 crisis.\nDistinguishing between different bank groups we find that illiquid banks invested in\nnarrow basket assets and sold ineligible bonds at the same time, presumably to improve\ntheir liquidity position. In contrast, liquid banks invested in extended basket assets and\nstocks, which may have been driven by profitability considerations. Interestingly, liquid\nbanks appear to have played an important role in absorbing the increased supply of\nnever eligible stocks, which may have helped to stabilize prices. Finally, we find that less\ncapitalized banks invest more heavily in riskier bonds, which could be an indication of\nrisk-shifting or search for yield. The observed price effects of trading after the Lehman\ncollapse were driven mostly by banks constrained by their liquidity or capital and by trades\nin the OTC market, which appears to be most vulnerable to adverse market conditions.\nThe deep concern about fire sale externalities could not be confirmed for the German\nbanking sector during this particular period. The absence of broad-based fire sales in our\nsample does not imply that fire sales did not take place in other financial markets, by\nnon-banks or with assets not captured by our dataset. However, given the scope of our\ndataset it is unlikely that such fire sales strongly affected the German financial system.\nThere is, however, some evidence of tight market liquidity in the post-Lehman period,\nwhich was mitigated by the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policy.\nThis suggests that these policy measures contributed to stabilizing the financial system\nafter the Lehman collapse.\nA Appendix\nA.1 Graphs\nFigure A1: Aggregate cumulated net purchasing quantities\n%\nNarrow basket quantities\n%\nExtended basket quantities\n%\nNever eligible bonds quantities\n%\nNever eligible stocks quantities\nFigure A1 shows the net (purchases \u00ad sales) trading volume (using only euro quantities without prices) of\nall 120 banks, weighted by each bank's total assets as at June 2008, averaged per day and cumulated over\ndays, for all assets grouped by their ECB eligibility.
