Cancer was induced on 2-stage skin carcinogenesis model by single topical application of 7,12 dimethylbenz [a]\nanthracene (DMBA), as, initiator, and two weeks later it was promoted by croton oil treatment thrice a week on the dorsal\nsurface of mice for 16 weeks. Flaxseed oil (FSO; 100\u00b5L/animal/d) was orally administered 1 week before and 1 week after\nDMBA application (Peri-initiation stage). The animals of the FSO-administered group showed a significant reduction in\ntumor incidence (76.67%), cumulative number of tumors (37), tumor yield (3.7), and tumor burden (4.81) when compared\nwith the carcinogen-treated control animals. Biochemical parameters in skin and liver tissue such as LPO and phase I\nenzymes were significantly (P < .01) reduced in the FSO-treated experimental group, whereas the phase II enzymes (GST,\nDT-diaphorase) and antioxidant parameters (GSH, GPx, SOD, catalase, and vitamin C) exhibited a significant (P < .01)\nelevation when compared with the animals of the carcinogen-treated control group. Histopathological alterations in the\ncarcinogen-treated control animals were also observed in the form of epidermal hyperplasia, keratinized pearl formation,\nand acanthosis in skin and tumors, whereas these were found to be reduced after FSO administration. The results of\nthe present study demonstrate that the oral administration of FSO has the potential to modulate the levels of LPO,\nantioxidants, and detoxification enzymes in the DMBA-croton oil\u00adinduced skin carcinogenesis in mice.\n",

Cases of cancer are increasing rapidly\nthese days because of the changes in environment and life-\nstyle. All cancers develop by genetic damage, which is the\nresult of either internal factors such as spontaneous muta-\ntions, hormones, and nutrient metabolism in the body or\nexternal factors such as excessive tobacco oralcohol con-\nsumption, exposure to chemicals, and radiations.\nCancer is the second leading disease in developed coun-\ntries, accounting for nearly 1 in every 4 deaths. In the United\nStates, about 1\n370 new cancer cases are estimated to\nare expected to die of this disease.1 Skin carcinogenesis is\nthe most prevalent of all cancer types, and its incidence is\nexpected to rise substantially. There are 2 types of skin can-\ncer: malignant melanoma of the skin and nonmelanoma\nskin cancer. Malignant melanoma is the most serious type\nof skin cancer. Epidemiological data and experimental evi-\ndence suggest that UV-B radiation has the potential to cause\nboth squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma\nbecause of its characteristic wavelength range.1\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are the by-products gen-\nerated during the respiratory and metabolic reactions in our\nbody. These species have both positive and negative impacts\non our body depending on their concentrations: at low lev-\nels, these molecules have important roles in signal transduc-\ntion, whereas higher levels of ROS can cause oxidative\nstress and tissue destruction. In cancer cases, the cells gen-\nerate reactive molecules rapidly to accelerate their growth,\nso these molecules can act as a cancer marker. We need to\ndiscover products that can scavenge these free radicals\nwithout affecting our normal cells.2\nBesides the advancement in cancer treatment techniques,\nthere should be a preventive approach that is effective and\nsafer. Cancer chemoprevention is a promising strategy,\nwhich is now gaining momentum.

Such oil is con-\nsumed in various food formulations, and it is the subject of\nextensive research because of its potential health benefits.\nThe physiological benefits of flax oil are attributed primar-\nily to the high -linoleic acid content, chlorophyll pigments,\n-tocopherol, plastochromanol-8, phenolic acids, and flava-\nnoids, which may play significant and/or synergistic roles\nin the pharmacological quality of the oil.7\nBasch etal8 reviewed the medicinal properties of flax-\nseed and concluded that it had been studied on humans for\nthe prevention and treatment of 13 diseases, including con-\nstipation (as a laxative), attention-deficit hyperactivity dis-\norder, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis/coronary artery\ndisease, menopausal symptoms, cyclic mastalgia (breast\npain), breast cancer, prostate cancer, acquired immune defi-\nciency syndrome (AIDS), and hyperglycemia/diabetes. The\nscientific literature also provides evidence of the radiopro-\ntective and photoprotective properties of FSO in animal\nThe present study has been conducted to evaluate the\nchemomodulatory potential of FSO during DMBA and cro-\nton oil\u00adinduced skin carcinogenesis in mice.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals\nThe initiator, 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA)\nand croton oil (used as promoter) were procured from\nSigma Chemicals Co, St Louis, MO. DMBA was dissolved\nwas mixed in acetone to give a solution of 1% dilution. FSO\nwas procured from Prano Flax India Private Ltd.\nAnimals\nAnimal care and handling were approved by the ethical com-\nwere done according to guidelines set by the World Health\nOrganization, Geneva, Switzerland, and the Indian National\nScience Academy, New Delhi, India. The present study was\nconducted on Swiss albino mice (7-8 weeks old weighing 24\n\u00b1 2 g), selected from a random breed inbred colony. These\nanimals were housed in polypropylene cages in the animal\nhouse under controlled conditions of temperature (25\u00b0C \u00b1\n2\u00b0C) and light (14 light:10 dark). The animals were fed a\nstandard mouse feed (procured from Aashirwad Industries,\nChandigarh, India) and water ad libitum.\nExperimental Design\nSwiss albino mice in the resting phase of growth were\nselected from the inbred colony and divided into 5 groups.\nThe dorsal hair between the cervical and caudal portions\nwas clipped using a surgical clipper 2 weeks before applica-\ntion of the initiator.\nGroup I (vehicle-treated control; n = 10): animals of this\ngroup were treated with acetone (100 \u00b5L/animal) on the\ndorsal clipped portion, and double distilled water equiv-\nalent to FSO (100 \u00b5L/animal/d) was administered orally\nthroughout the experimental period of 16 weeks.\nGroup II (FSO-treated control; n = 10): these animals\nwere administered FSO alone at a dose of 100 \u00b5L/\nanimal/d for the 16 weeks.\nGroup III (carcinogen-treated control; n = 10): a single\napplied over the dorsal surface of mice in this group.\nTwo weeks later, croton oil (100 \u00b5L as 1% w/v in ace-\ntone) was applied topically 3 times a week until the end\nof the experimental period.\nGroup IV (experimental; n = 10): In this peri-initiation\ntreatment group, animals received FSO (100 \u00b5L/\nanimal/d) from 7 days prior to 7 days after the DMBA\napplication, whereas the croton oil was applied similarly\nto group III.\nAnimals of all the groups were monitored daily, and their\nweight was taken weekly. The mice were observed weekly\nfor the detection of tumors on the dorsal surface, and tumors\nwith diameter greater than 2 mm and whose persistence was\nmore than 2 weeks were recorded. The parameters studied\nafter the completion (ie, 16 weeks) of the experiment are\ndiscussed below.\nMorphological\n1.

The dermal region showed\nreduced dermal fibroblasts and fibroconnective tissue in\ncarcinogen-treated control animals (Figure 13B). Sections\nof tumor revealed cells with atypical nuclei, dyskeratosis of\nkeratin, and lymphocytes with reduced stroma accumulated\nat margins (Figure 13C).\nAdministration of the FSO during the peri-initiation stage\ndemonstrated a lower degree of epidermal hyperplasia,\nacanthosis, and damage in sebaceous glands. A moderate\nnumber of keratinized pearls were observed with suprabasal\nhyperplasia in the FSO-treated experimental groups in com-\nparison with carcinogen-treated control (Figures 13D-13E).\nDiscussion\nFSO is a rich source of -linolenic acid, which can be con-\nverted into long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid\n(PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexae-\nnoic acid (DHA) via elongation and desaturation reactions.21\nThe present study was performed to evaluate the potential\nof FSO against DMBA-croton oil\u00adinduced skin carcinogenesis.\nDMBA is an indirect-acting and organ-specific carcino-\ngen, which is metabolized to the ultimate carcinogen\nenzymes of CYP450. The DMBA intermediate causes muta-\ntions in the genome by forming adducts with DNA and acts\nas initiator in chemical carcinogenesis.22 12-O-tetradecanoyl\nphorbol-13-acetate is the active constituent of croton oil that\nbinds with protein kinase C and leads to transcription of\nearly genes c-fos and c-jun, and stimulates the activating\nprotein-1 and NF-B transcription factors, which result in\ncellular proliferation and apoptosis.23\nReduction in the cumulative number of tumors, tumor\nyield, tumor burden, and tumor incidence by administering\nvarious plant extracts during chemical-induced carcinogene-\nsis has been observed earlier.24,25 Similarly, a considerable\ndecrease in skin tumors with the oral administration of FSO to\nmice has been reported in the present study. It might be pos-\nsible that -linolenic acid, flavanoids, phenolic acid, and\ntocopherols in FSO elevated the cellular antioxidants and\nreduced the oxidative damage caused by carcinogen and\npromoter.\nLPO is produced during life processes in a chain reaction\ninitiated by free radicals produced. Malondialdehyde is the\nlipid electrophile generated from peroxidation, and an\nincrease in its levels is an alarming sign of various diseases,\nincluding cancer.26 Topical application of DMBA and croton\nFigure 10.

In contrast, FSO, rich in PUFA, protects the\ncellular membranes, and its other phytochemicals scavenge\nfree radicals and inhibit LPO in experimental animals.\nare the phase I enzymes respon-\nsible for the biotransformation of DMBA into its active\nintermediate. The elevated levels of phase I enzymes act as\na biomarker for cancer detection, and a related trend was\nnoted in the carcinogen-treated control group.27 Modulatory\nFigure 13.

GSTs and\nDT-diaphorase facilitate the detoxification of carcinogens\nby conjugating the carcinogen with GSH and uridine\ndiphosphate glucuronic acid, respectively, for its fast detox-\nification and excretion.28 In the present study, elevated\nphase II enzyme levels in skin and liver of experimental\nanimals were recorded after FSO administration.\nTreatment with FSO increased the levels of enzymatic\n(SOD, CAT, GPx) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (GSH) in\nboth skin and liver, which were noted to be decreased in the\ncarcinogen-treated control group. SOD accelerates the dis-\nmutation of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and\nfinally CAT, and GPx degrades H\nO\ninto water and oxy-\ngen. GPx is a selenium-containing enzyme, which works in\nassociation with GSH and needs different secondary\nenzymes (GR and G-6-PDH) and cofactors (NADPH and\nglucose-6-PO\n) for efficient action.28 Carcinogen treatment\nreduced the levels of SOD by generating ROS, whereas the\nfree radical scavenging action of FSO restored the same\ntoward normal in the experimental animals.\nTripeptide glutathione is a nonprotein thiol that plays a\ncrucial role in scavenging free radicals. GSH can readily\nform adducts with ROS and protects the macromolecules in\nour body.29 The depletion in GSH content in the control ani-\nmals was associated with tumor genesis, and administration\nof FSO reduced the oxidative stress and hence balanced the\nGSH levels.\nSimilarly, levels of vitamin C were observed to be\nreduced in carcinogen-treated controls because such vita-\nmins are used in quenching free radicals in the aqueous\nphase to protect cellular membranes from degradation.29\nFSO intake in mice conserves the vitamin C activity toward\nthe normal range by scavenging the reactive species.\nThis study was limited to the mouse model. The literature\nshows the anticancer properties of FSO against breast, colon,\nprostate, and intestinal cancer30 and others, with the possible\nmechanism associated with its high -3 PUFA content,\nwhich reduces the formation of proinflammatory mediators\nPGE2 and LTB4 from arachidonic acid. Omega-3 fatty acids\nof FSO hinder the production of prostaglandins by acting on\nthe cyclooxygenase pathway.31 Fatty acid metabolism is the\nsame in all mammalian models, including mice and humans,\nalthough evidence from animal and human experimentation\nsuggests that the products of omega-3-fatty acid (EPA and\nDHA) do have different potentials to alter gene expression\nand resulting metabolic and cellular functions.32\nConclusion\nThe results of the present study suggest that FSO admin-\nistration at the peri-initiation stage of carcinogenesis has\nchemopreventive potential by modulating the phase I and\nphase II enzymes and antioxidants in mammals. The anti-\ncancer and antioxidative effect of FSO might be a result\nof the synergistic action of various antioxidants present in\nsuch oil.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nFinancial assistance received from University Grants Commission\nmajor research project to Prof. P.
