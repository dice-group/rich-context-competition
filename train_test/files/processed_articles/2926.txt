This mismatch\nbetween the maturities of the assets and liabilities exposes the banks to interest rate risk.\nHowever, this maturity mismatch can also be a source of income (called the earnings from\nterm transformation) because long-term interest rates tend to be higher than short-term\ninterest rates.\nIn this paper, we investigate the banks' exposure to interest rate risk as well as their earn-\nings from term transformation using a dataset on German banks' exposure to interest rate\nrisk; the exposures in this dataset were derived from the banks' own internal risk models.\nThe results of our empirical study can be summarized in four statements. (i) For the sam-\nple period September 2005 to December 2009, the systematic factor for the exposure to\ninterest rate risk rises and falls in sync with the shape of the term structure. (ii) At bank\nlevel, however, the time variation of the exposure is largely determined by idiosyncratic\neffects (83%). The systematic factor and regulation, i.e. the quantitative limitation of\ninterest rate risk in the Pillar 2 of Basel II, account for 9% and 8%, respectively.

For instance, the proportion of the earnings from term transformation relative to\ncooperative banks, changes in earnings from term transformation over time have a large\nimpact on the interest margin. Across banks, however, exposure to interest rate risk does\nnot seem to be a decisive factor for the interest margin.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\n\u00a8\nUblicherweise vergeben Banken langfristige Kredite und refinanzieren sich durch kurzfristige\nKundeneinlagen.

Supervisors are especially concerned about banks' interest rate risk. From a financial\nstability point of view, they have to know what determines changes in banks' exposure\nto interest rate risk and whether the interest rate regulation has an impact on banks'\nbehavior. By contrast, practitioners are more interested in the earning opportunities from\nterm transformation. Both issues are addressed in this paper, and four questions guide our\nanalysis: (i) Is there a relation between the systematic factor of the exposure to interest\nrate risk and the shape of the term structure? (ii) What factors determine (at bank level)\nthe exposure to interest rate risk? (iii) How profitable is term transformation? (iv) Do\nbanks with a large exposure to interest rate risk have a high interest margin?\nThe main contribution to the literature is to investigate the four questions from above\nwith a unique dataset. This dataset includes the banks' exposure to interest rate risk,\nderived from their own internal models. In the previous literature, there are two methods\nof assessing the banks' exposure to interest rate risk: (i) One can use stock market data\nand analyze to what extent changes in the shape of the term structure affect the market\nvalue of the banks and (ii) one can estimate the interest rate risk exposure from the banks'\nbalance sheets. Both methods are fraught with problems, because both methods provide\nonly an approximation of the banks' true exposure to interest rate risk.\nBy contrast, we have data on banks' exposure to interest rate risk at our disposal and,\ntherefore, need not rely on estimates. The data covers the period from September 2005\n1We thank the discussant and participants at the 13th conference of the Swiss Society for Financial\nMarket Research (2010) and the participants at the Bundesbank's Research Seminar. The opinions ex-\npressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nto December 2009. With regard to term transformation, this period was very eventful:\nFrom 2005 to summer 2008, the term structure became more and more unadvantageous to\nterm transformation; in summer 2008, the term structure even became nearly flat. Then,\nafter the Lehman failure and the subsequent rapid reduction of short-term lending rates\nby the central banks, the steepness of the term structure increased considerably. From a\nsupervisory point of view, this period was eventful, because the regulation for the interest\nrate risk in the banking book was introduced (which had previously not been regulated\nquantitatively).\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we give a short overview of the\nliterature in this field. Section 3 describes the methods. In Section 4, the dataset is\npresented. The results are given in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes.\n2 Literature\nOur paper is related to two strands of the literature of the banks' interest rate risk (See\nStaikouras (2003) and Staikouras (2006) for a survey). The first one is about the deter-\nminants of the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, and the second one deals with the\nrelationship of the interest margin and the possible earnings from term transformation.\nfor Germany investigate the determinants of the banks' exposure to interest rate risk. They\nfind that the belonging to certain banking groups, the banks' size, their earnings and\nbalance composition, and the banks' application of derivatives have a significant impact\non their exposure to interest rate risk. In this paper, however, we are not interested in\nthe banks' level of interest rate exposure, but in the timely changes in the exposure.\nEnglish (2002) analyses the relationship of the (net) interest margin and the shape of\nthe term structure. Using aggregate data for a cross section of countries, he finds little\nevidence that the possible earnings from term transformation (i.e. the slope of the term\nstructure) have an impact on the interest margin. To some extent, our paper is related\nto Czaja et al. (2010). The authors extract the earnings from term transformation out of\nstock returns by analyzing a benchmark bond portfolio with the same exposure to interest\nrate risk as the underlying stocks. They find that a substantial part of the stock returns is\ndue to term transformation. In our paper, we also choose a benchmark portfolio to infer\na bank's earnings from term transformation.\nAs stated above, we can use data on the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, derived\nfrom the banks' internal models, and, therefore, do not have to estimate it. There is a\nlarge body of literature that deals with just this question, i.e. the question of how to\nestimate a bank's exposure to interest rate risk. Often banks' balance sheets are used,\nwhich are broken down into positions of relatively homogeneous repricing periods. For\neach position, a measure of interest rate sensitivity is assigned, for instance, the duration,\nand the weighted sum of the positions' duration is a measure of the bank's exposure to\ninterest rate risk (See, for instance, Sierra and Yeager (2004)). The main problem of these\napproaches is that they yield a rather imprecise estimate of a bank's actual exposure,\nbecause the data from the balance sheet is often not detailed enough and off-balance\nsheet positions, especially interest rate swaps, are ignored. Entrop et al. (2008) use time\nseries of balance sheet data and even their measure can only explain about 27% of the\ncross-sectional variation in the actual interest rate exposure of a sample of more than\n1,000 German banks. Another method consists in inferring the banks' interest rate risk\nexposure from the banks' stock returns (See Yourougou (1990) and Fraser et al. (2002)).\nThis approach, however, is only applicable to the listed banks and not to the unlisted\nones, which account for the vast majority of banks in most countries.\n3.1 Exposure in the course of time\nAs mentioned above, we do not need to estimate the banks' interest rate exposure from\nstock market returns or from balance sheet data, and yet the data analysis poses econo-\nmetric challenges. The challenges arise owing to the characteristics of the dataset: The\npanel is highly unbalanced. On average, there is around one observation for each bank in\neach year, but the time difference between two observations differs widely, from one month\nto more than three years. The number of observations per bank is also widely different in\nthe cross section of banks.\nThe variable Xi(t) with i = 1, . . . , N and t = 1, ..., T denotes the exposure to interest\nrate risk of bank i in month t. We model this exposure (normalized to the banks own\nfunds) as follows:\nXi(t) = i +\nt\n(k) + \nouti(k) +\nt\nwhere i is a time-invariant, bank-specific variable that captures the bank's attitude to-\nwards interest rate risk, for instance the banks' business model, its belonging to a specific\nbanking sector and its economic environment. The variable (t) describes the general\nmacroeconomic conditions in month t, in our case especially the shape of the (past and\ncurrent) term structure of interest rates. We call this variable the change in the systematic\nfactor of the exposure to interest rate risk. The variables (1), . . . , (T) are cross section-\nally constant. outi(t) is a dummy variable that takes on the value one in month t, if there\nexists an exposure observation for bank i in this month and if this exposure is greater than\nthe regulatory threshold of 0.2. i(t) is the banks' idiosyncratic change in the exposure to\ninterest rate risk. It is assumed to be serially and cross-sectionally independent.\nOur aim is to extract the systematic component (t) with t = 1, .., T from the exposure\ndata (See Equation (1)). One straightforward method is to calculate the change in the\ncross-sectional average exposure X(t) in month t (or the cross-sectional average exposure in\na given quarter). The problem with this approach is that the dataset is highly unbalanced,\ni.e. not only does the number of banks for which there exist exposure data in a given month\nvary, the composition of the sample in a given month may also change systematically. For\ninstance, it may be the case that there is a cluster of observations of banks with large\nexposure to interest rate risk in certain months. To show the problem with this approach,\nwe write the change in the average cross sectional exposure as\nX(t) = X(t) - X(t - 1)\n= ((t) - (t - 1)) + (t) + out(t) - out(t - 1) + ((t) - (t - 1)) , (2)\nwhere (t) is the cross-sectional average of the bank-specific variable i of those banks for\nwhich there is an observation in month t. As the composition of this sample changes in the\ncourse of time, the cross-sectional average (t) of the time-invariant bank-specific effects i\ndiffers from month to month. out(t) is the share of those banks for which there exist data\nin month t and whose previous exposure was in excess of the regulatory threshold. (t)\nis the average cross-sectional idiosyncratic change in the banks' exposure to interest rate\nrisk for the banks for which there is an observation in month t. The average idiosyncratic\nchange can be expected to cancel out in the event that the cross section is sufficiently\nlarge.\nWhen investigating the changes in the average exposure (as described above), it re-\nmains unclear whether a change in the observed average exposure X(t) is due to changes\nin the systematic component of the exposure to interest rate risk (t) or whether the com-\nposition of banks in the sample ((t) - (t - 1)) has changed, or whether changes in the\nsupervisory pressure out(t) - out(t - 1) are responsible.\nWe choose the following method of mitigating the problem of changing sample com-\nposition: Instead of the exposure levels Xi(t), we investigate the change in the exposure\nof the same bank, as stated in Equation (3). Let Ti(j) with j = 1, ..., ni denote the jth\nobservation for bank i. ni is the number of exposure observations for bank i. We define\nCi(j) := Xi(Ti(j)) - Xi(Ti(j - 1)) j = 2, . . . , ni (3)\nas the change in bank's exposure, and\nDi(j) = Ti(j) - Ti(j - 1) j = 2, . . . , ni (4)\nas the time span during which this change occurs. Analysing the changes instead of the\nlevels is accompanied by a loss of information; for instance, we can use only those banks\nfor which there are at least two observations, i.e. ni\nTo illustrate the notation, we give the following example. The interest rate risk expo-\nThe date is given in months since September 2005, i.e. October 2006 corresponds to\nin exposure is C107(2) = -0.04, the time span during which this change occurred is\nApplying Equation (3) to Equation (1), we obtain\nCi(j) =\nTi(j)\nt +  outi(Ti(j - 1)) + i(j) j = 2, . . . , ni (5)\nwith\ni(j) =\nTi(j)\nThe variable Ci(j) does not depend on the unobservable bank-specific effect i and the\ncoefficients (t) with t = 1, ..., T and  can be estimated with an OLS regression. To see\nthis, we rewrite Equation (5) as\nCi(j) = (1) ei(1, j) + . . . + (T) ei(T, j) +  outi(Ti(j - 1)) + i(j) (7)\nwith\nei(t, j) =\n\n\n\n1 Ti(j - 1) < t  Ti(j)\n0 otherwise\nwhere j = 2, . . . , ni and i = 1, ..., N. Note that, by assumption, the monthly idiosyncratic\nchanges i(t) and thereby the idiosyncratic changes i(j) themselves are cross-sectionally\nindependent. In addition, the idiosyncratic changes i(j) are also serially independent,\nbecause, by construction, the changes in exposure refer to non-overlapping periods, i.e.\nthe monthly idiosyncratic change i(t) (for a given month t) appears exactly once in\nthe idiosyncratic change i(j) (in the event that Ti(j - 1) < t  Ti(j)). However, the\nvariance of i(j) would not be constant even if the monthly idiosyncratic changes i(t) were\nhomoskedastic. Even under this assumption, the variance of i(j) would not be constant,\nbut proportional to the time span Di(j) between the current and the previous observation.\nTo account for this heteroskedasticity, we use White-corrected standard errors. The total\nnumber of observations that can be used in the regression (5) amounts to\nNobs =\nN\nni\nThe approach above is comparable to a panel estimation with fixed effects: in both ap-\nproaches, the bank-specific effect is removed by first differences (or, equivalently, by sub-\ntracting the time series average). In addition, this approach makes it possible to deal with\na highly unbalanced panel.\n3.2 Earnings from term transformation\nWe cannot directly observe which part of the banks' interest income is due to term trans-\nformation. Therefore, we use an indirect method and we estimate the bank's earnings\nfrom term transformation by analyzing a bond portfolio which has the same exposure to\ninterest rate risk as the bank under consideration. We assume that the same exposure to\ninterest rate risk yields the same earnings from term transformation. If this assumption\nholds and if the bank's exposure to interest rate risk is known (as in our case), we are able\nto obtain a precise estimate of the bank's earnings from term transformation.\nThe bond portfolio above is based on an investment strategy that consists of revolvingly\ninvesting in ten-year par-yield bonds and of revolvingly selling par-yield bonds with one\nyear of maturity.2 The basis point value (BPV) of this strategy is around BPVS = 0.372\n2See Memmel (2008) for details of these investment strategies.\neuro per 1,000 euro of volume (See the appendix). The BPV of a bank is\nBPVi(t) =\nXi(t) Ei(t)\nwhere Ei(t) is the regulatory capital (own funds) of bank i in month t, and Xi(t) is, as\ndefined above, the exposure to interest rate risk. Note that Xi(t) is the loss in present\nvalue due to a parallel upward shift of 130 basis points in the term structure in relation to\nthe bank's own funds Ei(t) (which explains the multiplication with Ei(t) and the division\nThe variable ki(t) states the ratio of the bank's interest rate exposure to the interest\nrate risk exposure of the bond portfolio, i.e.\nki(t) =\nBV Pi(t)\nIf the same exposure to interest rate risk translates into the same earnings from term\ntransformation, the scaling factor ki(t) concerning the exposure should also apply to the\nearnings from term transformation, i.e.\nki(t) =\nFi(t)\nFS(t)\nwhere Fi(t) and FS(t) are the earnings from term transformation of bank i and of the bond\nportfolio, respectively. Combining (11) and (12), we see that a bank's earnings from term\ntransformation depend multiplicationally on two factors: the bank's exposure to interest\nrate risk Xi(t) and the market conditions FS(t).\nWe are not primarily interested in the absolute earnings from term transformation,\nbut in their relation to total assets TAi(t) (Margin from term transformation variable:\nTMi(t)) and the bank's interest income Ri(t) (variable: sharei(t)). Note that total assets\nTAi(t) and interest income Rt(t) are reported only once a year (and, in the case of the\ninterest income, for the whole 12 previous months), i.e.\nTMi(t) =\nt\nFi(k)\nTAi(t)\nand\nsharei(t) =\nt\nFi(k)\nRi(t)\nFor this analysis, the assumption Same interest rate risk, same earnings from term\ntransformation is crucial. To our mind, this assumption can be justified because interest\nrates of different maturities are highly correlated. With respect to, for instance, the stock\nmarket, we would feel less comfortable if we made such an assumption.\nNext, we define the interest margin IMi(t) as (net) interest income over total assets\nand we estimate the following panel model:\nNote that this panel does not suffer so much from gaps in the data, because we are now\nlooking at yearly data (instead of monthly data as in the analyses before). Consequently,\nthe -operator means the difference to the previous year, i.e. a lag of 12 months.\nWe estimate Equation (15) twice, once as a fixed effects model and once as a between-\ngroup model. The fixed effect model\ngives information on how changes in a bank's earnings from term transformation affect\nthe bank's interest margin. If changes in the earnings from term transformation do not\naffect other components of the interest income, we expect the coefficient w to equal one.\nBy contrast, the between group model\nIMi = b + b TMi + i (17)\ngives evidence as to whether banks with higher interest rate risk exposure tend to have\nhigher interest margins. If b equals one, earnings from term transformation are an ad-\nditional source of interest income (which do not compete with other income sources for\nlimited risk budgets). This assumption is not so farfetched as it seems, because interest\nrate risk in the banking book need not be backed with regulatory capital. By contrast, if\nthe coefficient b is zero, then term transformation competes with other income sources\nfor limited internal risk budgets. If term transformation is more profitable (in terms of\nunits of risk budget) than the competing sources of interest income, we will expect b in\nthe interval between zero and one.\nAccording to section 24 of the Banking Act, banks in Germany must immediately notify\nBaFin and the Bundesbank if their banking book losses exceed 20% of their own funds\nowing to a standardized interest rate shock. The ratio of losses in present value over\nown funds is called Basel interest rate coefficient. To be able to fulfill the notification\nrequirement, banks have to calculate at regular intervals how much the present value of\ntheir banking book goes down owing to this standardized interest rate shock. Currently,\nthe standardized interest rate shock consists of two parts: a parallel upward shift of 130\nbasis points (bp) in the entire term structure and a parallel downward shift of 190 basis\npoints. The relevant shock for the banks is the one which leads to the larger losses.\nNearly all of the banks will gain if the term structure shifts downward and lose if the\nterm structure moves upward, because banks tend to grant long-term loans and take in\nshort-term deposits. For the few banks for which the 190-bp-upward shift is the relevant\nshock we proceed as follows: Their exposure is multiplied by -130/190 to account for their\nnegative term transformation and to rescale their exposure. Observations of parallel shifts\nof other than 130 basis points are rescaled accordingly. When calculating the effects of\nthe interest rate shock, banks have to include all on-balance and all off-balance positions\nin their banking book.\nOur dataset concerning the Basel interest rate coefficient consists of two sources: the\nnotifications in the event that the losses exceed 20% of the own funds, and the information\ngathered in regular on-site inspections. Our data cover the period from September 2005 to\nDecember 2009. In Table 1, we report summary statistics of the banks' change in exposure\nto interest rate risk Ci(j), the time between two observations Di(j), and the number\nof observations per bank ni. For confidentiality reasons, we cannot report descriptive\nstatistics about the exposure Xi(t) itself or the regulatory dummy outi(t). The dataset\nconsists of 4,014 observations of changes in the interest rate risk exposure. On average,\nthe change in the Basel interest rate coefficient is close to zero. The 25 percent largest\nchange is 3.02 percentage points, the 25 percent lowest change is -2.42 percentage points.\nThe time between two observations is, on average, 14 months, i.e. on average, there is\none observation for 13 gaps. The sample covers 1,562 banks, i.e. for these banks, there\nare at least two observations available (ni\n 2). Given a bank is in the sample, there\nare, on average, about 3.5 exposure observations (and one observation fewer when we\nrefer to observations of changes in the exposure). The sample is biased towards the small\nand medium-sized savings and cooperative banks. In December 2009, savings banks and\ncooperative banks accounted for 22.2% and 59.7% of all banks in Germany, respectively.\nFor the variable change in the interest rate exposure Ci(j) in our sample, the respective\nAs outlined above, we analyze a passive investment strategy for government bonds.\nThe government bond yields are taken from Deutsche Bundesbank which uses the Svens-\nson (1994) approach to estimate the term structure from government bonds (See Schich\n(1997)). Data concerning the banks' balance sheets, their interest income and their own\nfunds is taken from Bundesbank's database BAKIS (See Memmel and Stein (2008) for de-\ntails). Table 1 also gives the information on the interest margin in the period 2005-2009.\nOn average, this margin is around 225 basis points in relation to total assets.\n5 Empirical results\n5.1 Exposure to interest rate risk\nAs described in Subsection 3.1, we run the regression (5) to estimate changes in the\nsystematic component of the exposure to interest rate risk (1), . . . , (T). As stated above,\nto account for possible deviations from the OLS assumptions concerning the covariance\nmatrix of the residuals, we make use of the heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix\nestimation according to White (1980). In addition to the variable outi(t), which measures\nsupervisory pressure as a dummy variable for banks exceeding the regulatory threshold, we\nintroduce another variables for the regulation: the dummy variable out2i(t) which takes\non the value one in the event that a bank is far above the regulatory threshold, i.e. that\nthe banks' Basel interest rate coefficient is larger than 0.3.\nIn Table 2, we report the regression results. Owing to lack of space, the 51 coefficients\n(1), . . . , (51) are not reported in this table, but graphically displayed in Figure 1. In\nthis figure, the cumulative estimated change is plotted, i.e. SC(T) = T\n(t). Up until\nlate summer 2008, we see a declining trend in the systematic factor. From autumn 2008\nonwards, the systematic factor rises steeply. For comparison purposes, we also plot the\nearnings of the benchmark bond portfolio. Qualitatively, both variables show the same\npattern. This finding gives evidence that the systematic factor of changes in the exposure\nto interest rate risk is closely related to the (past and present) steepness of the term\nstructure.\nThe results shown in Table 2 make it possible to gauge the impact of different factors,\nat bank level, on the exposure to interest rate risk. Above, we investigated the system-\natic factor that drives the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, i.e. (t). Now, we are\ninvestigating, at bank level, how far the systematic factor, regulation and idiosyncratic\neffects impact the exposure to interest rate risk. As before, we measure the systematic\nfactor with the coefficients (t), the regulatory pressure with outi(t) and out2i(t), and\nthe idiosyncratic factor with i(j). By analysing the coefficient of determination R2 in\ndifferent specifications, it is possible to assess the contribution of the different variables.\nIn Table 2, we show the coefficient of determination for different regression models:\nthe full model (column 2), the model without the regulation variables (column 3) and\nthe model with only the regulation variables (column 4). The R2 of the full model is\n17.24%, i.e. the combined contribution of the systematic factor and the regulation to the\ntotal timely variation of the exposure is 17.24% and, therefore, 82.76% of the variation is\ndue to idiosyncratic effects. These effects may be changes in the bank's business model,\nspeculation about abrupt changes in the interest rates, and changes in the bank's own\nfunds. Note that we consider the exposure relative to the bank's own fund. That is why\nthe relative exposure changes in the event that the absolute exposure remains constant\nand the own funds decrease or increase.\nWith the help of the two other specifications, it is possible to disentangle the contri-\nbutions of the systematic factor and of the regulation. One can expect some correlation\nbetween the regulatory variables outi(t) and out2i(t) on the one hand, and the variables\nei(t) on the other: In the event that the bank's exposure is above the supervisory thresh-\nold, it can be expected that there will be more observations (because, in this case, the\nbank is likely to report its interest rate exposure to the supervisor more frequently). In\nfact, it turns out that the sum of the R2s of the two incomplete models is slightly larger\nexplained variation to 0.1724, we scale them. The share of explained variation due to the\nWhen extracting the systematic factor for the exposure to interest rate risk, we see a\nstrong co-movement. But, when we look at the bank level, the systematic factor accounts\nfor a bit more than 9% of the timely variation in the interest rate risk exposure. Regulation\naccounts for slightly less than 8% of the timely variation. Banks with exposure above the\nregulatory threshold of 20% reduce their exposure on average by 3.31 percentage points\nbetween two reports. If the exposure is above 30%, the reduction is even higher and\n5.2 Earnings from term transformation\nTo calculate the earnings from term transformation as outlined in Subsection 3.2, we need\nthe information on the banks' exposure Xi(t) in each month t. However, the dataset\nincludes around 13 gaps for each observation. We determine intermediate gaps by linear\ninterpolation. Gaps at the beginning and at the end are filled in with the bank's first and\nlast exposure, respectively.\nIn Table 3, we show the banks' estimated earnings from term transformation normal-\nized to total assets (the ratio TMi(t) as defined in Equation (13)). We give the results for\nthe median bank and we break down the results into banking groups and years.\nOver the whole period 2005-2009 and over all banking groups, the median bank earned\n26.3 basis points (in relation to total assets and per annum). There are, however, large\ndifferences across the years and across the banking groups. In 2005, when term transfor-\nmation was quite profitable, the median bank earned more than 56 basis points from term\ntransformation, whereas in 2008, when the term structure was nearly flat, the median\nbank earned barely more than nine basis points. The results illustrate that earnings from\nterm transformation are quite volatile in the course of time, depending on the current and\npast shape of the term structure.\nSavings banks and cooperative banks are said to rely heavily on earnings from term\ntransformation. And, in fact, the earnings from term transformation for the median\nsavings bank (29.2 bp) and for the median cooperative bank (30.2 bp) are much higher\nthan the ones for the median private commercial bank (6.9 bp) and for the median other\nbank (6.8 bp). This reliance on term transformation among savings banks and cooperative\nbanks can be also seen when we look at the share of earnings from term transformation\nin relation to interest income (See Table 4). For the median savings bank and cooperative\nbank, this share is around 15% and 13%, respectively, for the median private commercial\nbank it amounts to less than 5%.\nThese results are consistent with earlier findings for the German banking sector. En-\ntrop et al. (2008) find that German savings and cooperative banks have a significantly\nhigher exposure to interest rate risk than other banks, and practitioners gauge that Ger-\nman banks earnings from term transformation amount to between 10% and 35% of the\nbanks interest income.3\nIn Table 5, we show the results of the panel regression, the fixed effect or within-\nmodel (Equation (16)) and the between-group model (Equation (17)). This table reads\nas follows, for instance, for the savings banks: When a savings bank's earnings from term\ntransformation increase by 1 basis point (as compared to the previous year), the interest\nincome (normalized to total assets) goes up by 0.51 basis points. The timely variation of\nthe earnings from term transformation accounts for 30.48% of the timely variation in the\nsavings bank's interest margin. The second row concerns the cross-sectional relationship\nbetween earnings from term transformation and interest margin. If two savings banks\ndiffer by 1 basis point in the time average of the earnings from term transformation, the\ntime average interest margin is 0.59 basis point higher for the savings bank with the higher\naverage earnings from term transformation. The results are based on 2,217 observations of\n458 savings banks, i.e. for each savings bank, there are on average 4.8 (out of five possible)\nobservations.\nThe results of the within estimation, at least for the savings and cooperative banks\n(which account for more than 90% of all observations in our sample), are consistent with\nexpectations: Although the two w-coefficients are significantly smaller than 1 (around\n0.5), the interest income of savings and cooperative banks rises and falls in accordance with\nthe respective earnings from term transformation. The fact that a 1 basis point increase\nin the earnings from term transformation does not translate in a 1 basis point increase in\nthe interest income may be due to a negative correlation between the earnings from term\ntransformation and the risk premia on loans. In times of a boom the term structure tends\nto be steep and the risk premia (and thereby the mark-up) tend to be low. According\nto the coefficients of determination R2, the timely variation in the earnings from term\ntransformation accounts for roughly one-third of the variation in the interest margin (for\nsavings and cooperative banks).\nThe results of the between-group model do not indicate that banks with high interest\nrate exposure tend to have a high interest margin. It appears that the interest margin\nis not much determined by the banks' exposure to interest rate risk. To be fair, for the\nsavings banks we see a significantly positive coefficient, however the explanatory power,\nmeasured by the R2, is relatively low (4.08% compared to the R2 of the corresponding\nwithin- regression of 30.48%), for the other banking groups (apart from the regression\nwith all banks) we do not find any significant coefficient. One possible explanation of\nthis finding is that banks take the interest rate risk into account when they allocate the\nbudgets to the different sorts of risk and that the risk from term transformation yields\napproximately the same return as, for instance, credit risk, measured in terms of risk units.\n6 Conclusion\nUsing a unique dataset of German banks' exposure to interest rate risk, we can address\nquestions about the banks' behavior concerning this sort of risk and about their earnings\nfrom term transformation. We see that the systematic factor of the exposure to interest\nrate risk indeed moves in accordance with the possible earnings from term transformation.\nAt bank level, however, bank specific and regulatory effects are far more important. For\nsavings and cooperative banks, earnings from term transformation are an important source\nof interest income, and timely changes in earnings from term transformation strongly\naffect their interest income. However, in the cross-section, the interest margin is not much\ndetermined by the exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe results apply especially to the small and medium-sized banks in the German\nsavings and cooperative bank sector, which are engaged in traditional commercial banking.\nThese results could be transferred to similarly structured banks in other countries.\nAppendix\nConsidering a flat term structure with continuously compounded interest rate r, a bond\nwith a residual maturity of M [in years] and a continuously paid coupon c, we can express\nthe present value of this bond as\nPV =\nM\nc exp(-rt)dt + exp(-rM) (18)\n=\nc\nr\n(1 - exp(-rM)) + exp(-rM).

To calculate the durations, we use the corresponding continuously compounded interest\nrates.\nReferences\nBallester, L., R. Ferrer, C. Gonzales, and G. M. Soto (2009).
