The sample was composed of 2,583 images and 87 secondary school pupils. The analysis was carried out\nthrough the elaboration of an ad hoc coding scheme. The results showed that people whose appearance is similar to the\nin-group predominate. The kind of physical activity, the field, space, and level of competence vary according to race. The\ntextbooks analyzed in this study engender a stigmatized vision of racial diversity, and the images reproduce and reinforce\nracial prejudice.\n",

The country has the second largest num-\nber of immigrants in the European Union. In the last decade,\nthe number of non-Spanish residents increased threefold and\nnow stands at 5.7 million, more than 12% of the population.\nThe biggest European immigrant groups are from Romania\nand the United Kingdom. The greatest numbers of non-Euro-\npean immigrants are from Morocco, followed by those from\nEcuador and Columbia. In the last few years, Spain has also\nseen a significant increase in people arriving from Pakistan\nand China (Spanish Statistical Office, 2012). With regard to\n(Spanish Ministry of Education, 2013) indicated that num-\nbers of foreign school students had increased in the last\nimmigrants in full-time education (9.1% of the school popu-\nlation). The biggest group are of South American origin\n(34.8%), followed by students from the European Union\nmake up 7.5% of the total, with 4% coming from the rest of\nEurope.\nNevertheless, current educational practices in Spain gen-\nerally respond to a homogenized scholastic model that fails\nto successfully educate specific groups made up of racial\ndiverse subjects (Rodr\u00edguez, 2010). It is clear that racial ste-\nreotypes continue to be rooted in Spanish classrooms.\nSchool textbooks play a central role in the homogenizing\nprocess; they reproduce social images and settings that\nreduce the complexity of social reality and offer a differential\nschematic that orders and explains that which is configured\nas reality (Jorquera, 2010). A substantial amount of informa-\ntion that is shown to the student is done so through images\nthat filter into the collective consciousness, with no prior\nreflection, and this makes iconic language a very powerful\nmedium for the reproduction of stereotypes (Acaso & Nuere,\nWith regard to race, the imagery presented in textbooks is\nsimplistic and, rather than facilitating the construction of\nshared identities, it endorses and perpetuates the hegemony\nof the (White and Western) in-group (Morales & Lischinsky,\nneous biological considerations that are used to transmit\nexpectations on the performance of individuals that are based\non a supposedly collective potential, a message that responds\nto racist biopolitics and corporal differentiation (McDonald,\n1Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Antonio de Murcia, Spain\n2Universidad de Vigo, Pontevedra, Spain\nCorresponding Author:\nMar\u00eda In\u00e9s T\u00e1boas-Pais, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Antonio de Murcia,\nCampus de Los Jer\u00f3nimos, s/n. 30107 Guadalupe, Murcia, Spain.\nEmail: mtaboas@ucam.edu or inestaboas@uvigo.es\nRacial Representation in Physical\nEducation Textbooks for Secondary\nSchools: Image Content and Perceptions\nHeld by Students\nMar\u00eda In\u00e9s T\u00e1boas-Pais1 and Ana Rey-Cao2\n Keywords\nrace, stereotype, image, textbook, physical education\n2 SAGE Open\nThis research project aims to identify the level of racial\ndiversity with regard to the people represented in the images\ncontained in Spanish physical education textbooks. It is clear\nthat the iconic messages presented are perceived as an objec-\ntive reflection of reality, and, in particular, for those students\nbetween 12 and 15 years of age, there is a tendency to legiti-\nmize identity with images that are considered an \"undeniable\nreality\" (Revuelta, 2008). The referential function of the\nphotograph is of primary interest for this project so the anal-\nysis tools use observable \"indicators\" that provoke the per-\nception of difference. As authors, we are conscious of the\nlimitations of this type of phenotypical analysis (the analysis\nof representations of race in images in physical education\ntextbooks was confined to observable phenotypic indica-\ntors), not least, because it relies on the concept of race that,\nin both its biologistic and cultural construction, represents a\nregulatory fiction through which certain differences are\ntransformed into meaningful concepts that legitimize oppres-\nsion, exclusion, privilege, and dominance (McDonald, 2013;\nRomero, 2003). Nevertheless, the coding scheme used in this\nwork is utilized as a tool for identifying observable indica-\ntors in the photographs considered that act as \"semiotic-\nmaterial\" references in the consciousness of the people who\nview them, and this leads to a process of the development of\n\"ethno-racial\" subjectivities:\n. . . these are not a reflection of a biological reality or the effect\nof social ordering and interpretation; they are a product of the\nprofoundly unequal, multiple relationships between elements\nsuch as: bodies; legislative apparatus; media images; specific\nlocations; celebrations; meals; accents; ways of looking; police\ncontrols; dress; fears; scientific activities; the globalised\neconomy; descriptions of the human genome; legalisation\npapers; position in the labour market; racisms etc. (Romero,\nHomogenization of Corporal Culture Through\nPhysical Education and Sport\nCorporal culture can be conceptualized as a group of values,\nuses, knowledge, beliefs, norms, and behavior patterns that\ndelimit corporal appreciation and practices in a given social\ncontext. The biopolitical concept provides a framework for\nthe interpretation of physical education and sport1 as prac-\ntices inserted in mechanisms for the control and regulation of\nthe population (Foucault, 2009) and the homogenizing and\nglobalizing (Mella, 2005). In this way, the universalizing of\nsport has contributed to the reduction of the variety and\ndiversity of corporal and motor expressions, which have\nbecome limited to a dominant cultural model (Barbero, 2006;\nDue to its close relationship with sport, physical education\nis particularly susceptible to discourses relating to corporal\ndifferentiation. The culture of \"performativity\" has domi-\nnated educational discourse, affecting the way in which pupils\nthink and act toward physical education (Evans, 2013). The\nobsession of explaining the phenomenon of human physical\nperformance has tended to treat people in a technological and\nmechanical manner, and this has led to the legitimization of\nreductionist and determinist interpretations of racial distinc-\ntion that support arguments on differences in motor perfor-\na number of the ways that young women visualized valued\nbodies and found that more than half of the posters that the\ngirls created portrayed White men. Only one portrayed\nwomen of color, and no Asian women were represented in\nthe posters. As such, legitimate sporting bodies promoted in\nthe school site were embedded in Whiteness.\nIn Spain, the mass media minimize the role of specific\nracial groups in sport and promote the formation of stereo-\ntypes and prejudicial attitudes (Igartua & Mu\u00f1iz, 2004;\nof advertising images show White people, as do most TV\nprograms related to sport. This is consistent with research\nundertaken in other countries: In the United States, Latin\nAmerican and Asian people hardly feature in sports pro-\ngrams (Billings & Tyler, 2002), and Black people are almost\nalways seen playing baseball, basketball, American football,\nMcCarthy, Jones, and Potrac (2003) argue that the existence\nof racial stereotypes in U.K. sports coverage not only makes\nsome groups invisible but also reflects the structures of\npower.\nStudies on racial stereotypes reveal that perceptions of\ncompetence and future aspirations for sporting participation\nvary among adolescents of different origins (Azzarito &\nHarrison, Lee, & Belcher, 1999; Harrison, Sailes, Rotich, &\nBimper, 2011), and that students' construction of the ideal\nbody is racialized (Azzarito, 2009). In accordance with mass\nmedia images, young people attribute certain physical activi-\nties to different racial characteristics (Contreras, Pastor, &\nphysically superior, whereas White people have greater cog-\nnitive capacities (Sheldon, Jayaratne, & Petty, 2007). These\nstereotyped perceptions are also present in the discourses of\ncoaches, teachers, and parents; for example, Black people\nare more closely identified with athletics, American football,\nand basketball (Harrison, Azzarito, & Burden, 2004; Hayes\nThe most recent National Survey on Spanish population\nimmigrants above the age of 15 participate in sport.\nImmigrants of African origin are the most active (46%), fol-\nlowed by South Americans (45%) and Europeans (42.1%).\nIn terms of the type of activity, results of another study by\nLlopis (2005) indicate that Africans prefer running, Latin\nAmericans enjoy team sports (especially football), and\nEuropeans are more interested in mountaineering, tennis,\nswimming, walking, skating, gymnastics, tennis, and team\nsports.\nT\u00e1boas-Pais and Rey-Cao 3\nThis data demonstrate that race must be considered a\npowerful influence on patterns of participation and perfor-\nRacial Stereotypes, Textbooks, and Physical\nEducation\nAlthough many studies have examined racial stereotyping in\nschool textbooks used in a variety of courses and subjects,\nphysical education textbooks have received little attention.\nThis might be explained by the fact that the use of textbooks\nin physical education is relatively recent. In Spain, the first\nempirical analysis of physical education textbooks did not\nappear until the 1990s, and research has focused on gender\nstereotypes. Only a few contemporary works have specifi-\ncally examined the representation of race.\nInternationally, there is agreement that physical education\ntextbooks offer a rather unbalanced vision of society that\nperpetuates the use of race as a variable that legitimizes the\nexistence of differences and expectations based on racial\ngroups (McDonald, 2013). The images shown in textbooks\nare almost exclusively of White or Caucasian people\n(Botelho, Silva, Queir\u00f3s, & Caetano, 2008), Black people\nare closely linked to specific athletic activities (McDonald,\n2013), and other social realities are silenced by the dominant\nculture (Hsu & Chepyator-Thomson, 2010).\nAll these studies revealed racial stereotyping presented in\nthe educational materials. This study attempted to seek an\nanswer to the following question: What are the patterns of\nrace that are being conveyed by Spanish physical education\ntextbooks?\nThis analysis contributes to research initiated by these and\nother authors within the literature related to physical educa-\ntion and sport pedagogy because, specifically, studied how\nthe physical education is \"encoded\" with particular concep-\ntions of race, and how these may impact students'\nperceptions.\nObjectives\nThis work aims to characterize the patterns of race that are\ntransmitted by physical education textbooks in compulsory\nsecondary education in Spain. The following hypotheses\nwere advanced:\nHypothesis 1: People from the in-group (White and\nWestern) are represented in textbooks with greater fre-\nquency than other racial groups.\nHypothesis 2: Black people, Asians, and people from\nother racial groups are mainly shown participating in tra-\nditional sports, and to a much lesser extent, in artistic\nactivities in the natural environment or playing other\ntypes of games.\nHypothesis 3: Black people,Asians, and people from other\nracial groups are usually shown in competitive activities,\nwhereas White people are more commonly shown partici-\npating in non-competitive activities.\nHypothesis 4: Black people, Asians, and people from\nother racial groups are more frequently shown participat-\ning in elite sports than White people.\nHypothesis 5: Images of people from the out-group\nshown in textbooks generate greater prejudice among the\nstudents than images of the in-group (White and Western).\nMethod\nThe study was based on two methods: (a) a content analysis\nof images in Spanish physical education textbooks using\nsynchronic, empirical, descriptive, and non-experimental\ntechniques, and (b) a test of secondary school students' per-\nceptions of a set of images.\nSample\nMethod 1.The content analysis considered 2,583 photo-\ngraphs from 36 textbooks from 10 Spanish publishing\ndiscounted as it was not possible to identify the racial origin\nof the people shown, for example, due to the wide-angle\nfocus that was used.\nMethod 2. The sample comprised 87 students (45 males and\n42 females), aged between 12 and 17. Selection criteria were\naccessibility (the collaboration of the school authorities) and\nthe inclusion of students from each year of compulsory sec-\nondary education.\nVariables\nThe analyzed variables were race, type of physical activity,\nfield of practice, and level of activity. Operational definitions\nare given in Table 1.\nProcedure\nMethod 1. The codification system for the content analysis\nutilized a number of sources and strategies. The starting\npoint was L\u00f3pez's (2005) \"publicity image analysis system.\"\nIn addition to the categories that were theoretically or deduc-\ntively derived, the codification process was amplified\nthrough an inductive or empirical procedure that was the\nresult of a first \"superficial viewing\" of the images. The cat-\negories that were identified in this first viewing were defined\nin conjunction with specific literature; there were five phases:\n1. Initial trial test. The compilation of categories used\nby L\u00f3pez (2005) was applied to a set of images taken\nfrom physical education textbooks. Issues that\nemerged during the initial viewings of the images\nalso determined several other categories used in the\n4 SAGE Open\nstudy. In addition to the categories that a priori orga-\nnized and systemized the test, the procedure was also\nexploratory: It allowed the researcher to identify new\ncategories and indicators and eliminate others that\nwere shown to be irrelevant to the objectives of the\nanalysis.\n2. Second trial test.Acode and an operational definition\nwere assigned to each of the dimensions and catego-\nries. A second trial test was carried out to corroborate\nthe validity of the categories. One hundred sixty-\neight images were coded.\n3. Consultation with experts. Three content analysis\nexperts participated in the study; two of them hold\ndoctorates in physical education and habitually use\ncontent analysis as their main research technique.\nThe third expert is a doctor of philosophy and litera-\nture and has a BA in library science and documenta-\ntion; she is the author of a number of studies based on\nthe content analysis of images and has published a\nnumber of articles on content and image analysis of\ndocuments. The objective of the consultation with\nexperts was the validation of the coding categories.\nTable 1. Coding Scheme.\nCategories/indicators Operational definitions\nRace\nWhite People characterized by white skin; appearance corresponding to a European origin.\nBlack People characterized by black skin; appearance corresponding to an African origin.\nAsian People characterized by a yellow or clear skin tone, dark eyes, and an epicanthic fold;\nappearance corresponding to an Asian origin.\n Latin American People characterized by brown skin, dark eyes, prominent cheeks, dark hair, nose\nand lips larger than Europeans; appearance corresponding to a Latin American\norigin.\nOthers Those people not included in the above categories.\nVarious People belonging to other racial groups.\nKind of physical activity\n Team sports Sports played in teams, in collaboration/opposition. For example, basketball, handball,\nfootball, hockey, rugby, baseball, water polo, polo, and volleyball.\n Individual sports Sports where participation is individual, without team mates and/or which can be\nplayed against an opponent(s). For example, swimming, track and field, gymnastics,\nrowing, cycling, tennis, boxing, judo, golf, motorcycling, and weightlifting.\nArtistic Activities that use the body as the means for artistic expression. For example,\nactivities related to mime, theater, drama, and dance.\n Fitness and physical conditioning Activities directed toward improving strength, speed, flexibility, and/or resistance.\nFor example, running, bodybuilding, stretching, aerobics, step, spinning, and aquafit.\n Physical activities in natural environments Activities such as paragliding, bungee jumping, cycling, trekking, hiking, rock climbing,\nsurfing, and rafting.\nGames Leisure activities whose basic characteristic is the acceptance of simple rules that can\nbe modified and adapted according to the group. For example, floorball, spongee\npolo, and korfball.\nOther The image shows an activity that is not included in one of the previous subcategories.\nField of practice\nCompetitive Activities that belong to the field of institutionalized competition. The presence of\nreferees, a playing field with the regulatory dimensions or numbers on shirts that\ncan indicate a competitive context.\n Formal educational Activities in the context of formal education; there are clear signs that the image\nbelongs to a school. The school gym, the playground, the school cafeteria, and the\nclassroom are typical locations.\n Other (non-competitive) Fields of practice that are clearly different from institutionalized competition. They\ninclude tilitarian contexts (workplaces, Shops, the home, and hospitals, etc.) and\nrecreational contexts (parks, the street, etc.).\nLevel\nElite People famous for the activity they carry out appear (elite sportsmen, famous\ndancers, actors, etc.), as well as indicators such as the public or sponsors who\nmake it possible to place the action at the Olympic Games, a league, a professional\nchampionship, or any other type of spectacle of general interest.\nNon-elite People who are not famous for the activity they carry out appear, and there are no\nindicators that make it possible to place the action at the Olympic Games, a league,\na professional championship, or any other spectacle of general interest.\nT\u00e1boas-Pais and Rey-Cao 5\nThe experts were asked to complete a questionnaire\ngiving their opinions on five items: suitability of the\ncoding scheme, precision of categories, mutual\nexclusion of categories, clarity of definitions, and\nminimization of the subjectivity of the observer. Data\nwere collected by means of the Likert-type scale,\nranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly\nagree), and complementary, qualitative information.\n4. Second consultation with experts. After making the\nnecessary modifications, the new coding scheme, the\ncorrected definitions, and the questionnaire used in\nthe first consultation were returned to the experts. All\nitems were given a rating of 4 or 5.\n5. Triangulation with observers. Three observers were\ngiven training on the coding system and codebook,\nusing images from textbooks that were not in the\nfinal sample. The objective was to familiarize the\nresearchers with the pictures, the coding system, the\ncodebook, and registration. The three observers were\nthen randomly assigned 74 images from textbooks.\nThirty of them were selected by simple random sam-\npling through a table of random numbers; 44 were\nselected by non-random sampling. The selection cri-\nterion was that all the indicators in the coding scheme\nhad to be codified. Intercoder reliability statistics\nwere calculated to assess agreement. The kappa reli-\nability (>.80) was therefore satisfactory for all cate-\ngories: type of physical activity (M  = .90), field of\npractice (M  = .86), and level (M  = .84). The inter-\ncoder reliability served as content for a pilot reliabil-\nity test before full coding commenced; the pilot gave\nthe researchers a final opportunity to alter the coding\nscheme to maximize reliability.\nWhen reliability levels were considered adequate (based\non the results of the reliability pilot test), another representa-\ntive sample was used to assess reliability for the full sample\nto be coded. Cohen's kappa was also calculated for the cod-\ning of the final sample of photographs. For the second inter-\ncoder reliability analyses, 273 images (more than 10% of the\nfull sample) were selected by simple random sampling using\na table of random numbers. According to Lacy and Riffe\n(1996), the appropriate size of the sample should not be less\nthan 50 units, or 10% of the full sample, and it will rarely\nneed to be greater than 300 units. Cohen's kappa revealed a\nhigh degree of reliability: type of physical activity (M  =\nMethod 2. The test of perception of images was oriented at\ngaining an understanding of the variables that attracted the\nattention of the young people who saw them in physical edu-\ncation textbooks. The test was developed in four phases: (a)\ndesign of the first draft of the test, (b) consultation with four\nexperts, (c) a pilot test with students from 4 years of\ncompulsory secondary education (n = 94), and (d) the design\nof the definitive perception test.\nDuring the implementation of the definitive test, 15\nimages taken from physical education textbooks were pro-\njected in the classroom. The images were selected in accor-\ndance with the results of Method 1, with the aim that they\nwould be representative. The protocol was as follows:\n1. The students were given the \"Description and\nOpinion\" form.\n2. The students read the instructions for the test, and\nany questions or doubts were dealt with. The instruc-\ntion was to describe what they saw in the images.\n3. Each of the 15 images was shown for 1 min. The stu-\ndents gave a written description of the image with\ntheir opinions.\n4. The students handed in the completed \"Description\nand Opinion\" form.\nAnalysis and Data Processing\nMethod 1. All images were digitized to facilitate coding. The\nregistration process was carried out manually, using a chart\nfor each textbook.\nThe statistical analysis used SPSS software 15.0 for\nWindows. The processing of the information involved\ndescriptive univariate analysis and associative measures\nbetween the different variables or categories (bivariate anal-\nysis). Contingency tables were used to compare the observed\nfrequencies and percentages. The Pearson chi-square statis-\ntic significance level (testing independence) was set at 5%\n( = .05) and used to identify associations between the\nvariables.\nThe corrected normalized residuals were utilized to com-\npare results; the marginal values, sample size, and the num-\nber of cases in which each remainder was based would\notherwise have made it impossible. For the confidence level\nset for this study (95%), the corrected normalized residuals\nindicated that the difference between observed frequency\nand expected frequency was high when its absolute value\nwas above 1.96. Therefore, a corrected normalized residual\nwith an absolute value greater than 1.96 indicates that there\nare more cases (if it is positive) or less cases (if it is negative)\nthan could be expected if the variables were independent.\nHowever, a value between \u00b11.96 indicates that the difference\nbetween observed frequency and expected frequency is small\nand the variables are independent.\nMethod 2. The descriptions of the students were subjected to\na content analysis, using the N-VIVO 8 program for the cat-\negorization of the comments. The software allowed the orga-\nnization and reduction of the data into content analysis\ncategories. The initial categories were the same as the con-\ntent analysis of the images, and these were added to by\n6 SAGE Open\ncategories that were inductively derived from the first read-\ning of the students' descriptions.\nResults\nHypothesis 1: Prevalence of White People\nThe most numerous group featured in physical education\ntextbooks for secondary schools in Spain is White people\ntotal). This was followed by images that showed individuals\nthe total); Black people (92 photos, 3.56% of the total),\nphotos, 0.15% of the total), and other racial groups (11 pho-\nThere were some differences among the publishing\nhouses: the percentage of photographs featuring non-White\ninterracial images from one publishing house was 28, and the\nlowest was below 3 (see Table 2).\nHypothesis 2: Type of Physical Activity According\nto Racial Group\nThe analysis of the relationship between the variables of\nracial group and type of physical activity was undertaken by\nmeans of contingency tables and the Pearson 2 test. When\nthe two variables were interrelated, a critical value was\nobtained, which was associated to the 2 statistic, lower than\nactivity in which the textbooks showed the participants par-\nticipating varied according to race ( = .05).\nOf the images that featured White people, 19.2% involved\nteam sports, 22.4% individual sports, 10% artistic activities,\n15.8% fitness and physical conditioning, 9% physical activi-\nties in a natural environment, 9.7% games, and 13.9%\nshowed individuals involved in other types of activities:\nWhite people were shown as participating in a wide variety\nof physical activities. Individuals from Black, Asian, Latin\nAmerican, and other groups were shown playing sports in\nteam sports); depiction of their participation in non-sporting\nactivities was very limited: 9.6% fitness and physical condi-\ntioning, 5.9% games, 2.2% artistic activities, 0.7% activities\nin the natural environment, and 6.7% other activities.\nFurthermore, Black people were especially shown as partici-\npating in sport (82.6%) and specifically in individual sports\nsuch as track and field (63%).\nThere was a similar pattern in interracial images: 78.6%\nof photographs that featured individuals from different racial\nvidual sports) with only 5% involving other physical\nactivities.\nThe last line in each cell of Table 3 shows high corrected\nnormalized residuals: There is a strong relationship between\nthe variables. The probability that Black people and interracial\ngroups did sport and no other types of physical activities was\nsignificantly higher than would be expected if the variables\nwere independent (remainders of 5.2 and 6.6, respectively).\nHypothesis 3: Field of Practice and Race\nThe contexts that were linked to the people represented in the\ntextbooks also varied according to the race to which the indi-\nvidual belongs. A .000 significance was obtained with\nPearson's chi-square test, which allowed the rejection of the\nnull hypothesis with a confidence level of 95%. As Table 4\nshows, individuals from Black, Asian, and other groups were\nalmost exclusively depicted in competition (75%, 56.5%, and\n42.9%, respectively) and were excluded from educational\ncontexts. In the case of Asians and Latin Americans, the per-\ncentage of pictures in formal educational contexts was 0.\nInterracial groups were also more frequent in competitive\nfields of practice (78.6%). In formal educational contexts or\nother fields, the figure was much lower (8.2%). In contrast,\nWhite people were mainly linked to non-competitive contexts.\nIn the images of competitive activities, there was a sig-\nnificantly higher proportion of individuals from \"other\"\nracial groups in comparison with White people (typified\nremaining fields of practice (educational and non-competi-\ntive), there was a significantly higher proportion of White\npeople than people from other racial groups.\nHypothesis 4: Level of Activity and Race\nThe Pearson chi-square test results also indicated (signifi-\ncance level of .05) that there was a relationship between racial\ngroup and participation in elite level sports (p value = .000).\nThere was a much higher proportion of pictures of White\npeople in non-elite sports contexts than there were in elite\nTable 2.

A common discourse included reference to\n\"those others,\" especially Black people, as \"those people\nfrom over there,\" \"not from here.\" A Black person is often\nseen as belonging to \"a different team and a different coun-\ntry\" (Student 76). In some cases, their presence was consid-\nered a problem, both in sporting terms, \"the black guy is\ncheating, he's pushing the white guy to get the ball off him\"\n(Student 73), and in terms of the wider society, \"the Chinese\nare invading us\" (Student 27).\nActivities such as football and athletics are seen as most\nadequate for Black people; the arguments are generalized\nstereotypes: \"black people are usually stronger\" (Student 6),\n\"black people run a lot\" (Student 46).

Individuals with a different\nappearance to the in-group (White and Western) are very\nmuch excluded from images shown in Spanish schools'\nphysical education textbooks. This finding coincides with\nresults of research on TV programs and advertising related to\nphysical activity and sport (Billings & Tyler, 2002; L\u00f3pez,\n2005) and the few published studies on physical education\ntextbooks to date (Botelho et al., 2008): There is almost\nexclusive representation of Caucasian people and an absence\nof other racial groups. Black people are the second most rep-\nresented group, with a much lower percentage. This lack of\nracial diversity is not exclusive to physical education; previ-\nously published works have found similar disparities in other\nRacial Stereotypes and Physical Activity\nHypothesis 2 was confirmed. The analysis revealed the\nassignation of a specific type of physical activity based on\nracial appearance. No previously published works on the\nrelationships between racial variables and physical activities\nin school textbook images have been found. Nevertheless, a\nstudy by McDonald (2013) on the configuration of the con-\ncept of race in the textual content of physical education text-\nbooks concurred with the results of this current article and\nargued that textbook discourses emphasize the superiority of\nthe \"black race\" in the sprint and running disciplines of ath-\nletics. Similar conclusions have been drawn with regard to\nthe representation of Black people in the mass media in the\nUnited States--representation is almost exclusively oriented\ntoward baseball, basketball, and American football (Thomas,\n2004). We were unable to corroborate the association of\nBlack people with baseball; as it is not a sport that features in\nSpanish physical education textbooks, we could, however,\nconsider athletics, basketball, and American football. The\nresults coincided with the opinions of the students (who\nlinked these sports with Black people) and the results of a\nnumber of other studies (Azzarito & Solomon, 2006).\nHypotheses 3 and 4 were confirmed. Black people were\nfrequently depicted in competitive, high-level sporting activ-\nities. Images in Spanish physical education textbooks trans-\nmit the message that racial diversity neither exists in the\nschool nor in recreational contexts. People who are different\nfrom the White and Western model are only shown in institu-\ntionalized competitive, high-performance sporting contexts,\nand this might be the reason for beliefs concerning physical-\nconditioning superiority (Contreras et al., 2008; Harrison et\nHypothesis 5 was confirmed through the opinions of the\nstudents that evidenced racial stereotypes and prejudices.\nThe students commonly referred to the \"others\" as \"foreign-\ners\" and problematized their presence in both sporting and\nnon-sporting contexts. The students perceived the existence\nof different sports and physical activities in terms of race and\nconsidered competition and high-performance sports to be\nthe most adequate for Black people. Following the argument\nof Harrison et al. (2004), the stereotyped messages implicit\nin physical education and sport often promote stereotypes\nbased on physical superiority. Nevertheless, the real differ-\nences are based on social forces that construct the reality, not\non genetic or biological aspects. There is no scientific evi-\ndence that substantiates theories that aim to explain the phys-\nical superiority of Black people or their supposed intellectual\nfailures in comparison with White people (Hayes & Sugden,\nConclusion\nSchool textbooks are not coherent with educational policies\nthat favor interracial education and learning. The images in\nsecondary school physical education textbooks portray a\nracial homogeneity with majority representation of the in-\ngroup (White and Western), compared with the minority rep-\nresentation of people from different races (the out-groups).\nT\u00e1boas-Pais and Rey-Cao 9\nThe messages transmitted by the images shown in Spanish\nphysical education textbooks do not facilitate the construc-\ntion of racial diverse and shared identities: People with a dif-\nferent appearance from the in-group (mainly Black people)\nare only represented in a limited number of contexts that are\nstereotyped in accordance with conceptions of \"race.\" They\nonly appear in sports and activities such as football, basket-\nball, and athletics and are excluded from artistic physical\nactivities or games that take place in the natural environ-\nment. In general, Black people,Asians, and other people who\nare not from the in-group are always linked to competition\nand elite sport, and are excluded from recreational or utilitar-\nian contexts in the educational environment.\nThese sporting contexts, mainly basketball and football in\nhigh-performance competition, offer a biased vision of cor-\nporal culture and reinforce racial prejudice and stereotypes.\nThis analysis makes a contribution to the body of research\nthat was initiated by other authors from many countries (e.g.,\nin coaching education programs in Sweden and demonstrated\nthat textbooks construct gender differences. Recently, Anne\nFlintoff (2015) concluded by arguing for a critical analysis of\nthe construction of Whiteness through physical education\nteacher education. This study demonstrates the need to raise\nawareness with regard to the content of physical education\ntextbooks and the importance of working to overcome racial\nstereotypes associated with sport and physical education.\nPublishing houses and education authorities must become\nfully aware of the contents of physical education textbooks\nto become involved in their improvement. Teachers must\nanalyze the books from a critical point of view to be able to\nuse them in a coherently didactic way. In this respect, the\nteachers' initial training should enable them to reflect and\nbecome aware of the implications that school materials can\nhave in racial differences.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
