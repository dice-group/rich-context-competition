Several social\nfactors may be implicated.13 First, off-\ntime entry into fatherhood, in which\nmen become fathers outside the typical\ntimeframe for their generational peers,\nparticularly during the adolescent years,\nmay increase risk of depressive symp-\ntoms8,14 making the earlier years of fa-\nthering especially important in early\nchildhood development. Second, father's\nliving arrangements may play a role be-\ncause nonresident fathers report higher\nFinally, race/ethnicity has been shown to\nbe an important factor in depression in\ngeneral with non-Hispanic blacks and\nHispanics more likely to report major\ndepression than non-Hispanic whites.21\u00ad23\nNo studies of paternal depression that\nwe are aware of have examined these\nfactors collectively over time before and\nafter becoming a father. Given the sig-\nnificant negative consequences of pa-\nternal depression early on in fatherhood\nand the potential of exposing offspring\nduring key early childhood develop-\nmental stages when fathers are in their\nearly fathering years, understanding\nthe progression of fathers' depression\nand delineating key points of potential\nintervention are paramount.\nThe developmental window across\nthe life course during which fathers\nare at-risk or experience depression\nsymptoms has not been well estab-\nlished. Life course theory posits that\nappropriately timed interventions\nhold the most promise for improved\nlong-term outcomes and decreased\ndisparities.24 One such successful\napplication is a smoking cessation\nintervention designed specifically\nfor fathers using the transition to\nfatherhood as an intervention point.25\nThus, understanding the evolution of\npaternal mental health along the life\ncourse may identify key windows with\nthe greatest potential for interventions\nto improve the well-being of fathers and,\nultimately, their children.\nThe primary goal of this study was to\nassess how the transition into fa-\ntherhood may be associated with\nchanges in depression among men\nand whether this association differed\nby key social factors. Our data come\nfrom the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health (Add Health),\nwhich followed a representative sample\nof American youth from adolescence\nadolescents).Thesize,longitudinal scope,\nandnationalrepresentationofAddHealth\nprovide an exceptional opportunity to\ninvestigate the determinants of mental\nhealth among males as they progress\nfrom adolescence into young adulthood.\nWe examined a 2-sided hypothesis that\nchange exists between fatherhood pe-\nriod and depressive symptoms. We fur-\nther examined the association between\nchanges in depression and key social\nfactors.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Sample\nAdd Health is a nationally representa-\ntive, longitudinal study of the social,\nbehavioral, and biomedical health of\nress from adolescence into adulthood.\nWave I interviews (population N = 20\noversampled adolescents from various\nincome, racial/ethnic, and disability\nsubgroups26; study-supplied weights\ncorrect for this. Data were combined\nto support a continuous time analysis\nof participants' differing life stages\nacross waves such that all variables\nhad values for each year covered by the\nstudy. Our institutional review board\napproved this investigation.\nMeasures\nDepressive Symptoms\nAll participants reported on their\nsymptoms of depression at each wave\nof the survey using 10 items drawn\nfrom the well-validated Center for Ep-\nidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\nmean, SD, and quartiles for all 10\nquestions across each wave; scores\nwere averaged and standardized to\ncreate a total score with adequate\ninternal reliability at each wave (a1\n=\n=\nAn age-adjusted standardized de-\npressive symptoms score was created\nfrom this unadjusted score to control\nfor differences of depressive symp-\ntoms across ages along fatherhood-\nyears. This age-adjusted depressive\nsymptoms score was calculated by\nfinding the expected value of the un-\nadjusted score for each age and sub-\ntracting it from each participant's\nunadjusted score. The expected val-\nues were found by regressing all ages\non the unadjusted standardized de-\npressive symptoms score. Therefore,\nan increase or decrease in the age-\nadjusted depressive symptoms score\nARTICLE\nis commensurable across all 3 groups\nthroughout the fatherhood years. The\nchanges in this score represent a rela-\ntive change in a normally distributed\ndepressive symptoms outcome.\nFatherhood Status and Time in\nFatherhood\nFatherhoodstatuswasdefinedbyusing\nthe household roster (reports on each\nmember of their household) and live\nchild data set (reports on each child\nthey have fathered) in each wave. Men\nwho had listed a biological child in the\nhousehold roster or live child data set\nwere categorized as a father. Father's\nresidence was coded into 3 categories:\nresident fathers, nonresident fathers,\nand nonfathers. Resident or nonresident\nfather classification was held constant\nthrough all future waves. Nonfathers\nwere the referent group throughout\nthe analyses.\nWe created a person-year file in which\nall relevant interview years of any given\nsample male's longitudinal record were\nbroken into separate data records, each\nof which contained the male's identifi-\ncation number and demographic and\nmental health data used in the analysis.\nFor these \"fatherhood-year\" records,\nfatherhood status in each of the possi-\nble years of the data collection period\nwas calculated on the basis of wave-\nspecific information regarding the age\nof the firstborn child. For example, a\nparticipant who first mentioned a 3-\nyear-old in wave IV was coded as having\n+3 fatherhood-years in wave IV and \u00ad3\nfatherhood years in wave III (which was\nconducted 6 years before wave IV), \u00ad9\nfatherhood years in wave II (which was\nfatherhood years in wave I (which was\nconducted 13 years earlier). Data from\nmales who were never observed to be\nfathers were centered at the mean age\nof entrance into fatherhood for all fa-\nthers in the sample, which was 23. Thus,\n\"fatherhood years\" for a nonfather ob-\nserved when the nonfather was 26 are\ncodedas+3.Thisallowsforcomparisons\nof fatherhood-years over the 19-year\nfathers (\u00ad9 to +10) and resembles\nother approaches to defining person-\nyears surrounding events of interest.15\nThe term \"fatherhood-years\" is used\nfor fathers and nonfathers.\nControl Variables\nCovariates coded for each person-year\nobservation included respondents'\nrace/ethnicity and own mother's edu-\ncation (wave I), and education, physical\nhealth, income, marital status, and\nnumber of children (each wave). Race/\nethnicity was categorized as white,\nblack, Asian, Hispanic, and other with\nwhite as the referent group for the\nanalyses. Marital status was measured\nat entrance into fatherhood. Although\nthere was a significant difference be-\ntween resident and nonresident fathers\nand marital status, marital status was\nnot collinear with fatherhood status and\nhad minimal affect on regression coef-\nficients when removed (bdiff\ntherefore, it was kept in the model.\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of Fathers and Nonfathers Sample\nNonfathers Nonresident Fathers Resident Fathers P\nHS Graduate, Vocational School,\nor Technical School\nSome graduate school to\nprofessional degree\nHS graduate, vocational school,\nor technical school\nSome graduate school to\nprofessional degree\nParent's income (wave I)b ,.001\nPersonal income (wave IV)b ,.001\nP values derived from t test for continuous variables and x2 for categorical variables.

Next, a gen-\neralized estimating equation (GEE)\nmodel was estimated to control for\nother covariates and to measure de-\npressive symptom change over time.\nThe GEE allows for outcomes to corre-\nlate over time, features an exchange-\nable correlation structure, and does\nnot impose stringent assumptions of\nmeans, variances, and distributions on\nlongitudinal data. Missing data are\nhandled under a missing completely at\nUsing GEE, we estimate a spline model\nwith 3 knots modeling 4 mutually ex-\nclusive time category intervals to\nevaluate possible nonlinear change\nbefore and after fatherhood and based\non a life course perspective: adoles-\ncence (defined in our data to include \u00ad9\nup to \u00ad4 fatherhood-years), late ado-\nlescence (from \u00ad4 up to 0 fatherhood-\nyears), early fatherhood (from 0 up to\n+5 fatherhood-years) and later father-\nhood (from +5 up to +10 fatherhood-\nyears).

Scores at 0 fatherhood-years\nindicate that there are significant dif-\nferences between the 3 groups, with\nresident fathers having significantly\nlower depressive symptoms than non-\nfathers, who in turn were significantly\nlower than nonresident fathers. Sim-\nilarly, there are differing scores at\n0 fatherhood-years by fatherhood cat-\negory within certain races (Table 4)\nand differences in depression scores\nby race, with black and Hispanic men\nhave higher mean scores than white\nmen among both nonfathers and resi-\ndent fathers (Table 5).\nRegression Results\nDepression and Fatherhood Status\nThe regression results in Table 6 show\ntrends in depressive symptom scores\nfor all 3 groups of fathers, with non-\nfathers as the referent group. For\nnonfathers, none of the 4 time slope\nestimates is statistically significant.\nFor resident fathers, however, the in-\nteraction variable between fatherhood\nstatus and the late adolescence time\nperiod is negative and statistically sig-\nwith nonfathers. This indicates that be-\nfore becoming a resident father, de-\npressive symptoms are occurring less\noften. Yet the child's birth reverses this\ndownward trend; resident fathers show\na statistically significant increase in the\ndepressive symptoms score during\ncompared with nonfathers.

Early fatherhood\ntherefore represents a period of large\nchange in depressive symptoms for\nresident fathers. In contrast, none of\nthe 4 coefficients on interaction terms\nrepresenting nonresident fathers is\nstatistically significant.\nFigure 1 illustrates the trajectories of\nage-adjusted depressive symptoms for\nresident and nonresident fathers taken\nfrom the regression coefficients; the 2\nstatistically significant periods are the\ndecrease in resident fathers' scores\nbefore the child's birth and the in-\ncrease in scores after the birth.\nDepression and Other Covariates\nMother's education, own education,\nphysical health, employment, marriage,\nand income level were all associated\nwith lower levels of age-adjusted de-\npressive symptoms scores (Table 6).\nThere is evidence that each additional\nchild is positively associated with de-\nlimiting the range of children did not\naffect the outcome.

The\ntransition to fatherhood and early fa-\ntherhood years may indeed be optimal\ntime points along the life course trajec-\ntory to identify fathers at risk for or\nsuffering from depressive symptoms\nand intervene.\nFindings from the nonresident fathers\nand nonfathers groups, although not\nstatistically significant, provide addi-\ntional key context. In the years just\nbefore the transition to fatherhood (ie,\nlate adolescence), young men who are\nnot going to become a father have\nrelativelystablescores,whereasthose\nwho will become nonresident fathers'\nshow an increase and those who will\nbecome resident fathers show a de-\ncrease in scores. It is nonresident\nfathers reporting the highest levels of\nmean depressive symptoms scores\namong the 3 groups, reaching a maxi-\nmum just before entering fatherhood.\nThis confirms earlier research placing\nnonresident fathers at higher risk for\ndepression.15,16 The lack of statistical\nsignificance may be due in part to\nsmaller sample sizes; future studies\nwith larger sample sizes, either from\nthis data set as time passes or in\nothers, are warranted. Some may ar-\ngue that selection into fatherhood may\nbe playing a role, with the strongest\nargument being that those with the\nlowest scores are likely to find a part-\nner and become a resident father.\nNevertheless, our findings show the\nunique path each group takes over\ntime that plays a role when concep-\ntualizing effective interventions and\nprograms for young men.\nRace/ethnicity, another key social\nfactor, was associated with depressive\nsymptoms scores with black and His-\npanic fathers showing higher levels\ncomparedwithwhitesateachdatapoint\nand along the trajectories.

First, nonresident and resident\nfathers have different mental health\ntrajectories from late adolescence into\nearly fatherhood. Therefore, designing\nstrategiestoidentifytheseyoungmenat\nthe appropriate times is key to im-\nprovingtheirwell-beingandthatoftheir\noffspring. Of note, a growing body of\nresearch finds fathers present at pedi-\natric visits,34,35 suggesting that identify-\ning at-risk fathers at these encounters\nis possible. Second, depressive symp-\ntom scores among nonfathers and\nnonresident fathers increase in late\nadolescence. If identified early enough\nand acted on, peak scores during the\ntransition to fatherhood (or age 23 for\nnonfathers) may be diminished. This is\nlikely to be true for black and Hispanic\nmen who start with higher scores. Fi-\nnally, when considering interventions, it\nis essential to remember that men of\nthe child-rearing ages 18 to 44 are less\nlikely to be engaged in the health care\nsystem, have a primary care physician,\nand have insurance compared with\nfication of mental health problems dif-\nficult at the very time when the impact\non children and families may be the\ngreatest. Several initiatives, such as the\nAffordable Care Act37 and a new focus\non preconception care,38 offer potential\nto improve the care for young men.\nIdentifying changes in paternal mental\nhealth today faces similar challenges\nto identifying maternal mental health\nchanges in the past. Chief among them\nis finding effective screening tools.\nMen are typically more willing to ac-\nknowledge fatigue, irritability, anhe-\ndonia, and sleep disturbances rather\nthan reporting sadness, worthless-\ndo exist, including the Edinburgh Post-\nnatal Depression Scale,41 the 5-item\nShort Form Health Survey,43 the General\nHealth Questionnaire,44 the CES-D,27 and\nthe Patient Health Questionnaire--2.45\nThe next issue to address is identifying\nnext steps for those men who screen\npositive. This is a more formative hur-\ndle; first, men are often reticent to seek\nhelp, and, second, finding appropriate\nreferral sources for men may be dif-\nterventions designed specifically for\ncurrent study identifies the life course\ntiming during which programs and\ninterventions could be designed to ad-\ndress paternal depression.\nThe nature and timing of longitudinal\ndata collection present several limi-\ntations. First, we have variable point\nestimates that we estimate to be\nlinear but may be nonlinear. By using\nsplines, we ensure our linear slopes\nprovide reasonable estimates dur-\ning each time period. Second, be-\ncause of timing, our sample consists\nofyoungerfathers.However,resident\nfathers age of fatherhood entry, 25, is\nthe same as the National Survey of\nFamily Growth's age at first birth for\ngeneralize our findings to men who\nbecome fathers before age 18, who\nhave been fathers for .10 years, or\nare older fathers. Finally, because\nwe constrained the fatherhood sta-\ntus variable to 1 entry per partici-\npant, we cannot address the changes\nsome fathers may have made from\nnonresident to resident or vice versa.\nFuture research that can track these\nchanges and the role these changes\nhave on mental health is important.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith the growing appreciation of the role\nfathers play in the health and develop-\nment of their children, understanding\nthe natural history of paternal de-\npression over the life course has\nimplications for fathers'own well-being\nand involvement as well as the well-\nbeing of their children. In our longitu-\ndinal, population-based study, non-\nresident fathers showed an increase in\ndepressive symptoms leading up to\nfatherhood, whereas resident fathers\nshowed an increase in depression\nsymptoms during their children's years\n0 through 5, key development years for\nchild bonding and attachment. Identi-\nfying at-risk fathers and designing ef-\nfective interventions may improve\nhealth outcomes for themselves, their\nchildren, and their family.\nREFERENCES\n1. Paulson JF, Bazemore SD.
