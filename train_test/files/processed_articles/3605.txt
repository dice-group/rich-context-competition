This study aimed\nto assess whether antenatal steroid exposure would affect renal responses to the direct intrarenal infusion of angioten-\nsin-(1\u00ad7) in rams and the angiotensin receptors involved in mediating responses to the peptide.\nAdult, uninephrectomized rams exposed to either betamethasone or vehicle before birth received intrarenal angioten-\nsin-(1\u00ad7) infusions (1 ng/kg/min) alone or in combination with antagonists to angiotensin receptors for 3 h. Basal sodium\nexcretion (UNa) was significantly lower and mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in betamethasone- compared\nto the vehicle-treated sheep. Angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) decreased UNa more in betamethasone- than in vehicle-treated sheep.\nCandesartan reversed the response to angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) but D-Ala7-angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) did not. Angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) infu-\nsion decreased effective renal plasma flow in both groups to a similar extent and the response was reversed by candes-\nartan, but was not blocked by D-Ala7-angiotensin-(1\u00ad7). Glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in both groups\nafter 3 h infusion of angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) plus candesartan. These results suggest that antenatal exposure to a clinically\nrelevant dose of betamethasone impairs renal function in rams. Moreover, angiotensin-(1\u00ad7) appears capable of activat-\ning the AT1R in uninephrectomized rams.\n",

Based upon results of studies\nhypothesized that responses to direct infusions of ANG-\n(1\u00ad7) into the kidney would be attenuated in adult sheep\nthat had been exposed to betamethasone prenatally. To test\nthis hypothesis we infused a low dose of ANG-(1\u00ad7)\ndirectly into the renal artery in a group of 12 adult male\nuninephrectomized sheep of which half were exposed to\nbetamethasone and the remainder to vehicle at 0.6 gestation\nand measured aspects of renal function.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal preparation\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee of Wake Forest University School\nof Medicine. Time-dated pregnant ewes were randomly\nassigned to receive either two 0.17 mg\u00d7kg-1 intramuscular\ninjections of a 1:1 mixture of betamethasone acetate and\nbetamethasone phosphate (Celestone Soluspan, Schering,\nKenilworth, New Jersey, USA) or vehicle alone which con-\ntained 3.4 mg of monobasic sodium phosphate, 7.1 mg of\ndibasic sodium phosphate, 0.1 mg of sodium ethylenedi-\naminetetra-acetic acid, and 0.2 mg of benzalkonium chlo-\nrine per ml given 24 h apart at days 80 and 81 of gestation.\nThe ewes were allowed to deliver naturally at term (term is\napproximately 145 days in our flock).\nMale offspring (five or six in each group) were trans-\nferred to the laboratory at 12\u00ad18 months of age. The\nresearch team was blinded to the sheep allocation. The tem-\nperature in the laboratory facilities and in the sheep pens\nwas kept stable at 20\u00b12\u00b0C, and the humidity at approxi-\nmately 35\u00ad40%. Sheep were fed a standard commercial\ndiet (PMI Rumilab\u00ae Brentwood, Missouri, USA) contain-\ning 0.75% NaCl and had ad libitum access to clean tap\nwater. Twelve hour day/night light cycles were maintained\nthroughout the experiment.\nSurgical procedure\nA midline suprapubic laparotomy was made in the lower\nabdomen to expose the bladder. A 14 French silicone Foley\ncatheter (Bard Medical, Covington, Georgia, USA) was\nplaced in the bladder and exteriorized through the left flank.\nTwo polyvinyl catheters were placed in the left carotid\nartery and two catheters were inserted into the left external\njugular vein. These were tunneled subcutaneously and\nemerged through a left anterior neck incision. All vascular\ncatheters were fastened to their corresponding vessels and\nthe distal vessels were all ligated.\nA paravertebral left or right flank incision was made to\nexpose the corresponding renal artery. A modified, Teflon\ncoated, 22 gauge endovascular catheter 25 mm long and\nwith a 0.9 mm external diameter was placed into the left or\nright renal artery in a non occlusive fashion and attached to\na Tygon catheter. The Tygon catheter was tunneled a short\ndistance to emerge adjacent to the spine. We then removed\nthe contralateral kidney.\nAll the animals received daily intravenous doses of\nmg on the day of surgery and two days thereafter. All vas-\ncular catheters were flushed with a heparin solution on a\ndaily basis to confirm patency. During the post-operative\nperiod and throughout the experimental period, each pair of\nanimals was housed together in individual carts with free\naccess to food and water.\nProtocol of experiments\nAfter allowing five days for recovery, sheep underwent a\nseries of experiments to evaluate the response to a 3 h infu-\nsion of ANG-(1\u00ad7) alone or in combination with specific\nantagonists. The sequence of infused substances was: (a)\nsaline (1 ng/kg/min); (b) ANG-(1\u00ad7) (1 ng/kg/min, Bachem\nBioScience Inc., Torrance, California, USA); (c)ANG-(1\u00ad7)\nkg/min, Bachem BioScience Inc., Torrance, California,\nUSA); (d) D-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7) (10 ng/kg/min, Bachem\nBioScience Inc., Torrance, California, USA); (e)ANG-(1\u00ad7)\nand candesartan (AT1R antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg by bolus injec-\ntion via renal artery,Astra Zeneca, M\u00f6indal, Sweden) and (f)\ncandesartan alone (AT1R antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg by bolus\ninjection via renal artery, Astra Zeneca, M\u00f6indal, Sweden).\nAll drugs were infused directly into the renal artery with\nsyringes mounted on a multichannel pump. The dose for\nANG-(1\u00ad7) and candesartan were obtained from our previ-\nous work documenting ANG II effects during intrarenal\ninfusions in sheep.23 The dose of ANG-(1\u00ad7) was equivalent\nto ANG II because part of our long-term goal is to determine\nif antenatal betamethasone alters the relative efficacy of\nthese two peptides in the kidney. The dose of D-Ala-\nANG-(1\u00ad7) was obtained from a previous study in which\nwas able to abolish the effect of ANG-(1\u00ad7).24 We didn't\nevaluate higher doses of D-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7) because they\ncan potentially elicit nonspecific effects.13 Forty-eight to 72\nh were allowed between experiments for adequate clearance\nof previously infused drugs. Not all of the animals received\nall of the treatments due to occasional catheter failure.\nBlood and urine samples were serially obtained prior to\ninitiating all infusions, subsequent to initiating infusions\nand over the course of the following 3 h.\n292 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)\nTo guarantee adequate hydration status we administered\n2000 ml of normal saline intravenously the afternoon prior\nto beginning each experiment.

This antinatriuretic response was not blocked by the\nANG-(1\u00ad7) receptor antagonist D-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7) (Figure\n1(B)): however, a significant increase in sodium excretion\nin both groups of sheep was apparent during infusion of\nANG-(1\u00ad7) with the AT1R antagonist candesartan.

Moreover, a reduction in renal plasma\nflow was observed in both groups along with a tendency for\na reduction in GFR following ANG-(1\u00ad7) infusion. These\nresponses were also reversed by candesartan but not D-Ala-\nANG-(1\u00ad7). Considered together, the data suggest that\nantenatal betamethasone exposure alters the renal responses\nto ANG-(1\u00ad7) and that unilateral nephrectomy modulates\nthese responses independent of any effects induced by ante-\nnatal steroid treatment. We chose intrarenal infusion of\nANG-(1\u00ad7) in an attempt to influence renal function\ndirectly and avoid any confounding systemic effects, such\nas changes in blood pressure, resulting from significant\nelevations in the peripheral plasma levels of the peptide.\nIndeed, the intrarenal infusion protocol did not alter circu-\nlating levels of ANG-(1\u00ad7) nor influence blood pressure.\nThe data in the literature on the effects of ANG-(1\u00ad7) on\nsodium excretion are conflicting. Multiple reports indicate\nthe peptide increases sodium excretion and /or urine flow in\nfindings are in vitro studies that ANG-(1\u00ad7) acts on the\nproximal tubule to inhibit sodium uptake.32 In contrast,\nthere are several observations that ANG-(1\u00ad7) has antidiu-\nretic/antinatriuretic effects in vivo and in vitro.32 There is\nreasonable agreement that ANG-(1\u00ad7) is a naturally occur-\nring ligand for the Mas receptor and thus many of its effects\nare mediated via binding to that receptor,37 but ANG-(1\u00ad7)\nmay also interact with AT1 and AT2 receptors.37 In our stud-\nies the inhibition of sodium excretion does not appear to be\nassociated with activation of the Mas receptor as the\nresponse was not blocked by D-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7). The fact\nFigure 2.

This idea is further supported by the\nchanges in the FENa following the different infusions in\nboth groups. Thus, in the presence of AT1R blockade, the\nANG-(1\u00ad7) induced response converted from a decrease to\nan increase in FENa. Whether the latter is blocked by\nD-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7) or an AT2R antagonist awaits further\nstudy, but complex interactions among these receptors and\nANG-(1\u00ad7) have been noted in studies on the cardiac effects\nWhile we do not have data for sodium excretion before\nuninephrectomy in this cohort, comparisons with the\nintact sheep from a different cohort in our previous study22\nreveal some changes in sodium excretion. Specifically,\nbasal sodium excretion in these vehicle-treated unine-\nphrectomized sheep was about twice that found earlier in\nvehicle-treated intact males.22 This is consistent with the\nstudy by Shirley et al. which showed that excretion rates\nof sodium were approximately 2-fold higher in the remain-\ning kidney of uninephrectomized rats.40 Uninephectomy\nof adult animal results in compensatory renal growth, but\ndoes not involve formation of new nephrons. The signifi-\ncant decrease in basal sodium excretion in uninephrecto-\nmized, betamethasone-treated sheep (compared to vehicle)\nstrongly suggests that the impaired sodium excretion in\nthis model is directly associated with the antenatal beta-\nmethasone exposure while the decrease in sodium excre-\ntion caused by ANG-(1\u00ad7) seems related to the additional\nloss of nephrons from the unilateral nephrectomy.\nUninephectomy immediately stimulates the growth and\nfunction of the remaining kidney.41 There are differential\nmechanisms initiating the early compensatory renal\ngrowth response and functional adaptation,42 including\na number of endocrine, biochemical, and molecular\nchanges,43,44 which result in glomerular hyperfiltration,\nrenal hypertrophy, and compensatory changes of trans-\nporters.42 Regarding the RAS, ANG II and increased\nAT1R may mediate the growth of the remaining kid-\nin these changes. However, it is certainly possible that any\nof the adaptations mentioned above could modulate the\nresponses to betamethasone and ANG-(1\u00ad7).\nThe role of ANG-(1\u00ad7) in the regulation of renal plasma\nflow is not clear. It has been reported that ANG-(1\u00ad7)\ncauses afferent arteriolar vasodilatation and, even if devoid\nof any vasodilator actions by itself, it at least antagonizes\nthe renal vasoconstrictor effects of ANG II.47 Others, how-\never, have found that ANG-(1\u00ad7) does not exert vasodilator\nand/or ANG II opposing actions in the renal circulation.48\nAlthough it is difficult to reconcile such contradictory\nfindings, based on their comprehensive analysis of studies\nregarding the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of\nANG-(1\u00ad7), Santos et al.49 have suggested that the overall\nactivity of the RAS, as it results from experimental manipu-\nlations, markedly influences MAP and renal functional\nresponses to ANG-(1\u00ad7). Antenatal betamethasone expo-\nsure can alter the balance between angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) and ACE2 expression implying that the\noverall activity of the RAS may be changed in the animals\nin the present study.50\nThe intrarenal infusion of ANG-(1\u00ad7) suppressed renal\nplasma flow in both vehicle- and antenatal betametha-\nsone-treated sheep to a similar extent in the absence of\nFigure 4.

This suppression may have been the\nresult of vasoconstriction via AT1 receptor activation\nbecause candesartan, not D-Ala-ANG-(1\u00ad7), reversed the\nsuppression.\nWe have previously reported increases in arterial\nblood pressure in sheep exposed to betamethasone before\nnatal betamethasone-treated sheep is significantly higher\nthan in vehicle-exposed sheep in the present study. The\nmean difference is similar to that previously reported51 and\nwould not be accounted for by unilateral nephrectomy in\nour study. None of the infusions changed MAP in these\nstudies, suggesting that their effects were confined to\nactions directly on the kidney. Thus, for example, intrave-\nnous administration of candesartan lowers MAP in beta-\nmethasone-exposed sheep,52 but our intrarenal infusion had\nno effect on MAP. Absence of peripheral effects is also sup-\nported by the fact that we did not find a significant increase\nin the plasma levels of ANG-(1\u00ad7) during the intrarenal\ninfusions of the peptide.\nBasal GFR tended to decrease in antenatal betametha-\nsone-treated sheep but the reduction was not significant.\nAlthough the GFR did not significantly change during\nintrarenal infusion of ANG-(1\u00ad7) alone or with D-Ala-\nANG-(1\u00ad7), renal plasma flow (RPF) decreased. Thus, the\ndecrease in RPF was perhaps caused by contraction of both\nafferent and efferent arterioles. The GFR increased signifi-\ncantly in both groups during intrarenal infusion of ANG-\n(1\u00ad7) with candesartan. The simultaneous increase in RPF\nmay have contributed to this increase.\nGFR values in the present study are different than\nthose we found in intact sheep at 1\u00ad2 years of age. In both\nthe vehicle- and betamethasone-treated uninephrecto-\nmized animals, absolute GFR values are lower than the\ncorresponding values in intact sheep.22 The decline in\nGFR produced by uninephrectomy in these adult sheep\nagrees with data from other animal studies53 and with\nobservations in human living kidney donors.54\u00ad56\nHowever, single nephron GFR must be increased after\nthe unilateral nephrectomy because the reduction in\nnephron number was 50% while the decline in GFR was,\nat most, 25%. It is possible that the increase in single\nnephron GFR could partially explain the increased\nsodium excretion in these animals.\nIn conclusion, the present findings indicate that prenatal\nexposure to a clinically relevant dose of betamethasone\nmodulates renal responses to ANG-(1\u00ad7) in uninephrecto-\nmized, adult sheep.\n"
