They\ncompleted a 16 question TMS while in the waiting room\nand a two-question exit TMS. The participation rate was\n87%. Two out of 25 (8%) adolescents met the criteria for\nhazardous drinking and 28% reported alcohol use. It was\nfound that 38% and 25% of adolescents who completed\nthe exit TMS were asked or advised about drinking,\nrespectively. Text messaging to assess adolescent\nalcohol use in this setting seems feasible, does not\ndisrupt patient workflow, and can assess many health\nbehaviors before a clinical encounter.\nINTRODUCTION\nUnderage alcohol use is the leading cause of\npreventable mortality among adolescents in the\nUSA.1 Alcohol use often starts during early\nadolescence; the average age of onset for alcohol use\namong adolescents in the USA is 13.2 years.2\nFurthermore, motor vehicle injuries are the leading\nthose deaths involved an alcohol-impaired driver.3\nRecognizing and assessing underage alcohol use\nis a key component in preventing and reducing\nteenage morbidity and mortality. Since most\nadolescents have health insurance, either public or\nprivate, and receive at least one medical check-up\nannually,4 5 primary care physicians (PCPs) are in\na unique position to have an effect on teenage\nalcohol use by providing early identification,\nassessment, intervention, and referrals. The Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American\nMedical Association recommend adolescent alcohol\nscreening, identification, advice, and discussion at\nevery visit.6e8 Despite these guidelines, several\nstudies have found that PCP compliance with\nAmerican Academy of Pediatric/American Medical\nThe most common reason cited by healthcare\nprofessionals for not discussing sensitive topics\nsuch as adolescent substance abuse is time.11e13\nIdentification of health problems before the clinical\nencounter can guide PCPs in dealing with specific\nhealth concerns making the clinical encounter more\nefficient and possibly even shorter. Only 35% of\nadolescents reported discussing substance use with\ntheir PCP, although 65% said that they wanted to\ndo so.14 When given a computerized option for\nsubstance use screening, adolescents preferred it to\nverbal inquiry from a nurse or physician, and did\nnot differ in what they were likely to reveal.15\nConfidentiality is another concern for adolescents.\nOver half (58%) of high school students have\nhealth concerns that they wished to keep private\nfrom their parents and from friends and classmates\n(69%); similarly, 25% reported that they would\nforego healthcare in some situations if their parents\nWireless technology has been used to address\nPCP and adolescent concerns. Personal digital\nassistants (PDAs) have been used in clinics to\nenhance adolescent screening and counseling in\nprimary care. A recent study in five primary care\npractices in the USA found that a PDA-based\nscreening tool enhances physician counseling and\nimproves adolescents' perceptions of the well\nvisit.17 Another study examining the use of PDAs\non alcohol screening reported that with PDA usage\nmore adolescents rated their visit as confidential,\nmore thought they were listened to carefully,\nand more were very satisfied (all statistically\nsignificant differences).18 However, PDAs are\nexpensive, learning to use them requires training\nand thus uses valuable time in a clinic, and demand\na support staff to solve technical problems.\nCell phone texting provides an innovative tech-\nnological approach to deal with this important\npublic health problem. Its widespread use and fast\nadoption have created innovative ways for patients\nand healthcare providers to interact about a variety\nof healthcare problems.16 Moreover, mobile phones\nare an effective mode to deliver information owing\nto familiarity, ubiquity, and affordability.18 Texting\nmay also provide a method of interaction that is,\nsimple, confidential, and preferable to adolescents.\nResearch shows that most adolescents own a cell\nphone and that texting is their preferred means of\nMinimal research has been done on the feasibility\nof using text messaging technology in a clinic.\nIt is impossible to predict the future of wireless\ntechnologies. However, a 2011 report found that\n35% of adults in the USA own a smartphone.21\nFurthermore, by the end of 2011 smartphones will\nbe owned by 50% of cell phone users.22 Clearly, the\ntrend seems to be the acquisition of more powerful\nmobile devices. These devices will allow owners\nshort messages service (SMS) capabilities and also\ninternet connection. Once this transition occurs,\n< An additional appendix is\npublished online only.

We use alcohol screening in primary care\nas a case example.\nMETHODS\nParticipants and setting\nParticipants were recruited while attending a pediatric or\na family medicine clinic. Eligibility criteria included being\n13e17 years old, having a cell phone with text message capa-\nbilities, and being mentally and physically able to send and\nreceive text messages. Parental and adolescent consent were\nobtained before any assessment.\nProcedures\nA research assistant (RA) approached consecutive adolescents\nand their parents as they arrived for their clinical appointments.\nThe RA explained the purpose of the study and determined\neligibility. Thereafter, adolescents were given a printed card with\na text number and survey initiation code and instructions on\nhow to access the survey. Adolescents were instructed to return\nto the RA after their scheduled appointment to receive\ninstructions on accessing a separate two-question exit survey\nand to receive a $25 debit card to cover any text message charges\nand as a token of appreciation for participating.\nMaterials\nThis pilot study employed a low-cost system using mobile\nphones to receive and send SMS survey questions. The appli-\ncation uses text-to-email conversion capabilities from USA\nmobile phone companies, allowing teens to use their personal\nphones. This feature is key to ensure adoption and use as it\nprevents patient workflow disruptions that would occur if teens\nhad to learn how to text on a new phone, be trained to use\na PDA or create a username and password to login to a website.\nAn RA gave participants a printed card with a text number\nand survey initiation code and instructions on how to access the\nsurvey. As soon as adolescents send a text message with the\nsurvey initiation code to a study-specific number the automated\ntexting system sends the first questions to cell phones and waits\nfor a response. After each response, the system sends the next\nquestion until the last question is reached. This concludes the\nfirst stage of the TMS. After the medical assessment, an RA\ninstructs participants to text a different survey initiation code to\nthe same number. The automated system sends the exit ques-\ntions to cell phones following the same protocol described above.\nOnly two questions are sent and that concludes the TMS.\nAdolescent responses are stored as a spreadsheet data file where\neach row and column corresponds to a participant and TMS\nquestion, respectively. The participants' phone numbers are then\nautomatically deleted, the file saved, and delivered to the\nresearcher. Once the researcher receives the spreadsheet data file\nit is converted to Stata version 1123 format (Stata, College\nStation, Texas, USA). Statistical analyses and reports were also\ngenerated using Stata.23\nThe TMS consisted of 18 questions that were divided in two\nparts (see the online supplementary appendix). The first part\nincluded 16 questions and the second part consisted of two\nquestions sent soon after the adolescent left the clinical\nencounter. The TMS gathers information about demographics,\ndiet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, and PCP's assessment\nand advice on alcohol use. The CRAFFT instrument was used to\nassess alcohol use. CRAFFT is a mnemonic based on ",

CRAFFT has been validated and tested on\nadolescents in a clinic24 and is not affected by age, sex, or race.25\nAnalysis\nDescriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were\nRESULTS\nA total of 55 adolescents were approached to participate. Of\nthese, 18 were ineligible for two reasons (ie, physical or mental\ndisability (n\u00bc3), or did not bring their cell phones (n\u00bc15)).\nEligible participants comprised 37 teens but parental or partici-\npant refusals lowered the sample to 32. The study sample\nHowever, three had faulty cell phones so the final sample was 29\nadolescents (see figure 1).\nTable 1 presents selected characteristics of the study partici-\npants.\nFigure 1 Study recruitment flow chart.\nBrief communication\nParticipants had a mean age of 14.7 years (SD61.3 years) and\nwere almost equally divided by sex. The average length to\ncomplete the TMS was 15 min (SD 65 min). Table 2 presents\nresults for the CRAFFT questions.\nFor example, the most commonly reported risk behavior was\nriding in a CAR driven by someone (including yourself) after\nusing alcohol (21%). Two adolescents met the CRAFFT criteria\nfor hazardous drinking but their PCPs neither asked nor advised\nthem on the hazards of alcohol consumption. The exit survey\nwas completed by 55% (16/29) of the participants. Thirty eight\nper cent (6/16) of PCPs asked adolescents if they were using\nalcohol while 25% (4/16) advised about the health hazards of\nunderage drinking.\nDISCUSSION\nThe aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of\nusing a TMS in primary care taking as a case example screening\nadolescents' alcohol use. A major concern was participation rates\nbecause both parents and adolescents had to consent. However,\nthis concern proved unfounded since 86% of eligible adolescents\ncompleted the first and longest part of the TMS. This response\nrate is comparable to school-based surveys26 and higher than\npopulation-based computer-assisted interviews.2 The high\nparticipation rate shows that using cell phone text message in\nprimary care is well accepted by parents and adolescents to\ngather sensitive data and can facilitate screening and assessment\nof unhealthy behaviors.\nAnother concern was possible waiting room delays, which\nwould compromise the use of this technology in clinics.\nHowever, this pilot study also showed that this technology did\nnot increase waiting room time. Furthermore, PCPs rarely\nnoticed that their adolescent patients were participating in\na research study.\nSecurity of sensitive data is also a factor that needs to be\nconsidered. However, none of the participants expressed any\nconcern. Nevertheless, encryption data protocols for text\nmessaging authentication and confidentiality are currently\navailable (eg, SecureSMS) (CellTrust Corporation, Scottsdale,\nArizona, USA) and should be used when electronically collecting\nand transmitting sensitive data. Security encryption protocols\nmust become the norm when using wireless technology for data\ngathering.\nThis pilot study also has some limitations. The first is the\nsmall sample typical of this kind of study. Another limitation is\nthe lower response rate for the exit survey. A different approach\nis required to increase participation rates. Possible approaches\ninclude sending the TMS later in the day, providing adolescents\nwith an additional incentive to dial and answer the TMS at\na later time, or incorporating the TMS after the PCP clinical\nevaluation before leaving the examining room.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this study also has several\nstrengths. First, we obtained a high response rate (86%). This is\nhigher than similar surveys.2 26 Second, 38% of adolescents\n$15 years of age reported smoking, higher than other school-\nconfirms previous findings where adolescents reported predilec-\ntion for, and feeling more comfortable with, mobile technology\nto answer sensitive questions about illegal and socially undesir-\nable behaviors more honestly.28e30 Third, even within this small\nsample, two adolescents met the CRAFFTcriteria for hazardous\nalcohol use but neither of them were identified by their PCPs. Of\nadditional concern, is the low proportion of PCPs meeting the\nrecommended clinical guidelines. Fourth, the technology proved\nreliable and data capturing and storage was done immediately\nthus reducing data entry errors, costs, time, and quality control\nneeds. Finally, there were no waiting room delays and the time\nneeded to complete the TMS was small.\nEarlier studies have shown the feasibility and usefulness of\nelectronic means for patients' health data.31e32 However, these\nstudies have some limitations (eg, cost, patient training, length\nof assessment, and computer and internet literacy) and are prone\nto create a social divide with respect to access and literacy. Our\nstudy builds upon this previous work but uses a technology that\novercomes past limitations and all socioeconomic groups have\naccess to cell phones and know how to text.33 This study\nprovides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of using SMS\ntechnology to survey adolescents in a clinic before their evalu-\nation. This technology can screen adolescents for unhealthy or\nhazardous behaviors before they are evaluated by their PCPs.\nInformation on these behaviors can be relayed to PCPs before the\nvisit and therefore prompt them to initiate a conversation on\nidentified hazardous behaviors and make more effective use of\ntheir limited time. Moreover, SMS shortcomings on when and\nwhere to reach participants include time zones, improper hours,\ncarrier coverage, international texting costs, and text messaging\ncharges. This technology can serve as a valuable tool to gain\na better understanding of health behaviors (eg, smoking, alcohol,\nillegal drugs, and physical activity) in real life.\n"
