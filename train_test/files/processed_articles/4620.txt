Indeed a Google search for \"culture\"\nprovides more than half a billion hits, and major social\nrecent search by this author of published studies based on\nScandinavian culture alone during the last decade shows\nmore than 100 papers with culture as an independent variable\n(please see appendix). Indeed, academic studies published in\nthe last two decades have indicated some distinctive aspects\nof Scandinavian management. Smith, Andersen, Ekelund,\nGravesen, and Ropo's (2003) seminal paper, \"In search of\nNordic management styles,\" offers a valuable contribution to\nthis field. Nevertheless, little has been published in the last\ndecade to update these findings or to highlight the unique\nelement of each individual Nordic society. Hence, the debate\nof how culture matters is ongoing. Consequently, this article\nwill compare the findings from the GLOBE study of societal\ncultural practices from the Danish and Swedish data, to the\nNorwegian data from the author's doctoral research, to\nunderstand any such cultural differences in Scandinavia.\nThe methodology and quantitative instrument applied in\nthis present study of Scandinavian societal culture is based\non Project GLOBE's (Global Leadership and Organizational\nBehaviour Effectiveness) study (House, Javidan, Dorfman,\n& Gupta, 2004). This ongoing research is a multiphase,\nmultimethod project examining the interrelationships\nbetween societal culture, organizational culture, and leader-\nship. A total of 170 social scientists and management schol-\nars from 62 cultures representing all major regions of the\nworld are engaged in this long-term programmatic series of\nintercultural studies. Approximately 17,300 middle manag-\ners from 950 organizations took part in the original study by\nthis researcher's doctorate study of Norwegian societal cul-\ntural practices. The meta-goal of GLOBE is to develop\nempirically based theories to describe, understand, and pre-\ndict the impact of specific cultural variables on leadership\nand organizational process and to determine their effective-\nness. More detailed information can be found on GLOBE's\nwebsite at http://mgmt3.ucalgary.ca/web/globe.nsf/index.\nIntercultural research supports the belief that to be able to\nunderstand cultural and communication values, business\npeople first need to be open and aware of their own values\nand then be able to compare their own cultural norms with\nthose of their business partners.

Figure 1\nbelow summarizes the findings of this \"Scandinavian cluster\nstudy\" from this researcher's doctoral research. The follow-\ning section then discusses the GLOBE dimensions of\nUncertainty Avoidance, Collectivism, Assertiveness,\nPerformance Orientation, Humane Orientation, Power\nDistance, Gender Egalitarianism, and Future Orientation, in\na Norwegian context within a Scandinavian framework.\nProject GLOBE's Performance Orientation\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nPerformance Orientation is an important cultural dimension\nthat has not been sufficiently examined in past theoretical or\nempirical cultural research (House et al., 2004). The few\nresearcherssuchasParsonsandShils(1952)andTrompenaars\n(1993) who have discussed elements of Performance\nOrientation have explored this in relation to other society\nvalues such as how status is accorded. Project GLOBE pres-\nents Performance Orientation as the degree to which an\norganization or society encourages and rewards group mem-\nbers for performance improvement and excellence (House et\nthat performance values are not limited to regions with\nProtestant beliefs. They posit that Confucian principles of\nperseverance, working hard, and learning new skills mirror\nperformance, thus proposing that Confucius teachings and\nWeber's emphasis on hard work reach similar conclusions:\nthat cultural values of performance exist more strongly\namong some cultural and regional groups than others\nHigh-scoring cultures tend to focus on achievement, the\nfuture, taking initiative, and job-related accomplishments.\nLow-scoring countries, however, tend to focus on tradition,\nfamily, affiliation, and social ties. Hence, social relationships\nare valued more than achieving. Additional predictors of\nPerformance Orientation were found to be related to a coun-\ntry's level of economic prosperity, higher levels of human\ndevelopment, and a stronger social support for competitive-\nness (House et al., 2004). Data gathered from the IMD's\nGlobal Competitiveness Ranking (1998), the United Nation's\nHuman Development Report (1998), and The World Values\nSurvey (Inglehart, 1997) supported these hypothesized cor-\nrelations. Table 9 offers a summary of economic indicators\nrelated to the intercultural focus of this study.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, Performance Orientation eval-\nuates the extent to which a community encourages and\nrewards setting challenging goals, striving for innovation,\nand performance improvement versus valuing family rela-\ntions, traditions, sensitivity, and experience. Norway, along\nwith all her Scandinavian partners are categorized within\nband \"B\" of the GLOBE scores (moderate to high\nPerformance Orientation), with scores as follows: highest in\nProject GLOBE's Future Orientation\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nFuture Orientation is the degree to which individuals in\norganizations or societies engage in future-oriented behav-\niors such as planning, investing in the future, and delaying\nindividual or collective gratification (House et al., 2004).\nWith regard to the economic and social predictors of this\ndimension, project GLOBE applied relevant data from the\nIMD Global Competitiveness Ranking (1994), the World\nEconomic Forum's Competitiveness Ranking (1998), the\nUnited Nation's Human Development Report (1998), and\nFigure 1.

This data show\nthe following factors as predictors of high levels of Future\nOrientation: economic prosperity, high levels of society\nhealth, active political ideology, and positive attitudes\ntoward gender issues. Norway, along with Denmark, is\nplaced in band \"A\" and ranks highest of all the Scandinavian\ncountries in this study, while Sweden is placed in band B\n(moderately high). The mean scores for Future Orientation\nin the Scandinavian cluster are for Norway: 4.48, followed\nThese results correlate with Hofstede and Bond's study of\nlong-term orientation (Hofstede & Bond, 1988). Government\nplanning, tax contributions, public investment, and a com-\nmitment to a strong welfare state are elements of all the\nScandinavian nations' long-term approach to planning for a\nstable future. Table 2 offers a summary of the key elements\nrecognized in the Future Orientation dimension.\nProject GLOBE's Gender Egalitarianism\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nOne of the most fundamental ways in which societies differ\nis the extent to which each prescribes and proscribes differ-\nent roles for women and men (Hofstede, 2001). Some societ-\nies are more gender egalitarian and seek to minimize gender\nrole differences (House et al., 2004). Researchers of this\ndimension support these claims (Barry, Bacon, & Child,\nEgalitarianism is defined as the degree to which an organiza-\ntion or society minimizes gender role differences while\npromoting gender equality. Predictors of gender egalitarian\nvalues include national wealth per capita (Hofstede, 2001).\nThe figures in Table 9 summarize GDP, with Norway's fig-\nures indicating a stable national wealth and a variation from\nher main trading nations. Schwartz (1994) posits a positive\ncorrelation between levels of mastery or self-assertiveness in\nsociety and lower levels of Gender Egalitarianism. Coltrane\n(1996) claims that an important predictor of strong Gender\nEgalitarianism is the degree of men's parental investment.\nHe claims that a greater investment in child rearing by men\nin society exposes children to nontraditional parent roles,\nwhich then encourages their efforts in balancing gender\nroles in society later. Furthermore, this increased parental\ninvestment by men gives women the time to pursue nontra-\nditional careers. Nordic countries have introduced state\nincentives and regulations that help fathers to achieve a\nProject GLOBE claims to have discovered meaningful\nvariances in societal values such as Gender Egalitarianism\nas a function of a society's climate. Project GLOBE found a\nnegative relationship between ambient temperatures and a\nsociety's placement on the Gender Egalitarianism scale. The\nlower the average daytime temperature, the more a gender\negalitarian a society will be (House et al., 2004). Hofstede's\nmasculine/feminine construct research correlates closely to\nthese findings. Hofstede claims that in less hospitable cli-\nmates with stable economies, both men and women must\ntake part in daily tasks to manage or even ensure survival\n(Hofstede, 2001). Scandinavian countries experience harsh\nwinters with average winter temperatures falling as low as\n-20 degrees. Hence Hofstede's research posits that\nScandinavian countries, with harsh climates, value high lev-\nels of Gender Egalitarianism.\nThe findings of the GLOBE study of societies correlate\nclosely to Hofstede's masculinity index, with Norway's\nscore of 4.03 placing her in the top band A, with Denmark's\nin band A.\nA strong correlation is also posited to be that of GNP per\ncapita and societal values such as Gender Egalitarianism.\nNorway's post\u00adWorld War II regional development policy\nhas encouraged industry and work opportunities in all\nregions of Norway. Table 3 summarizes the key elements of\nGender Egalitarianism.\nProject GLOBE's Assertiveness\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nThe concept of Assertiveness originates in part from\nHofstede's cultural dimension of masculinity versus femi-\nninity (House et al., 2004). In masculine societies, men are\nsupposed to be assertive and tough and women are expected\nto be modest and tender (House et al., 2004). Kluckhohn and\nStrodtbeck (1961) discussed dominance as an element of\nTable 2. Key Elements of Future Orientation\nSocieties with stronger Future Orientation Societies with weaker Future Orientation\nEmphasize visionary leadership that is capable of seeing patterns\nin the face of chaos and uncertainty\nEmphasize leadership that focuses on repetition of reproducible\nand routine sequences\nValue deferment of gratification placing a higher priority on\nlong-term success\nValue instant gratification and place higher priorities on immediate\nrewards\nHave organizations with a longer strategic orientation Have organizations with a shorter strategic orientation\nValue collective safety nets in society Do not see a specific need for society to provide a collective safety\nnet.\n4 SAGE Open\nAssertiveness in relation to the nature of the relationship of\nindividuals, groups, and societies with the outside world. In\nline with Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961), Trompenaars\nand Hampden-Turner (1998) researched societies' orienta-\ntion to nature. They posit that certain cultural groups believe\nthat they can and should control or dominate nature\n(Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner, 1998). Hence, assertive\nsocieties will thus view relations in terms of dominance.\nAll elements of previous research into cultural Asser-\ntiveness share a common understanding that Assertiveness is\nthe degree to which individuals in organizations or societies\nare assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in social rela-\ntionships (House et al., 2004). Foreigners often regard\nNorwegians and indeed all Scandinavian societies as some-\nwhat reserved and \"cold-hearted\" due to the fact that many\nScandinavians are nondominant and do not reveal their emo-\ntions openly. This way of showing feelings is very culture\nspecific. A Scandinavian person's insular approach does not\nmean that individuals do not feel emotions: It is an indication\nof the sense of order and of keeping control in an interdepen-\ndent society such as Norway. In Scandinavia, it is rare to\nhave a heated argument or strong disagreement at work or in\nprivate life. In traffic, it is unusual to blow your horn or to\npush into a queue. A sense of order and fairness is prevalent\nfrom the time one starts in nursery schools and learns to take\nturns to the custom of patiently waiting in line in the com-\npany canteen. Country mean scores for Norway and her\nScandinavian partners are as follows: Denmark showing\nslightly higher scores of 3.80, placing them in band B, and\nSweden and Norway showing slightly lower scores of 3.38\nand 3.37, placing them in band C, indicating moderate to low\nlevels of Assertiveness in comparison. Table 4 summarizes\nkey elements of Assertiveness.\nProject GLOBE's Collectivism\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nAcross all disciplines researched, the importance of the indi-\nvidual versus the importance of the group has been studied.\nHofstede (2001) posits a correlation between individualism\nand wealth, with industrialized countries such as England,\nthe United States, and Australia as the most individualistic\ncultures (Hofstede, 2001). He also suggests that an increase\nin national wealth in a developing country causes an increase\nin individualism (Hofstede, 2001). Levine and Norenzayan\n(1999) posit that a more accurate predictor of individualism\nis pace of life. They argue that individualistic cultures have\na faster pace of life than collectivist cultures as they focus on\nachievement. Triandis (1995) discusses intrinsic family sys-\ntems as an antecedent to Collectivist values.\nProject GLOBE divided this dimension into two con-\nstructs at the second stage of their pilot study (House et al.,\n2004): Institutional Collectivism and In-Group Collectivism.\nInstitutional Collectivism (Collectivism 1) is the degree to\nwhich organizational and societal institutional practices\nencourage and reward collective distribution of resources and\ncollective action (House et al., 2004). In-Group Collectivism\n(Collectivism 2), however, is defined as the degree to which\nindividuals express pride, loyalty, and cohesiveness in their\norganization or families (House et al., 2004). Table 5 offers a\nsummary of the key traits of these two dimensions of\nCollectivism.\nTo conclude, mean country scores for Institutional\nCollectivism practices show rather high levels for all\nScandinavian nations: Sweden: 5.22 (band A), Denmark:\nreflectionfromLindellandSigfrids(2007)isthatInstitutional\nTable 3. Key Elements of Gender Egalitarianism\nSocieties with higher Gender Egalitarianism Societies with lower Gender Egalitarianism\nHave a higher percentage of women in the workplace and more\nwomen in positions of authority\nHave a lower percentage of women in the workplace and fewer\nwomen in positions of authority\nAccord women a higher status Accord women a lower status\nPromote equal opportunities for all people in society Tolerate inequality\nTable 4. Key Elements of Assertiveness\nSocieties with higher Assertiveness Societies with lower Assertiveness\nValue assertive, dominant, tough behavior for everyone in societies Value modesty and tenderness\nValue competition and believe that anyone can succeed if he or\nshe tries hard enough\nValue cooperation, people, and warm relations\nValue direct and unambiguous communication Emphasize the importance of \"face-saving,\" ambiguity and subtlety in\ncommunication\nEmphasize results over relationships and reward performance Are concerned that \"merit pay\" can be destructive to harmony\nWarner-S\u00f8derholm 5\nCollectivism seems, at least to some extent, to go in waves.\nWhen times are good in society, individuality will be stron-\nger, and in bad times Collectivism is stronger.\nA specific anomaly in Norway's In-Group Collective cul-\nture lies in the Norwegian tradition for expecting the state to\ntake care of old people and the sick rather than expecting the\nfamily to take this collective responsibility. A culture that\nscores high on In-Group Collectivism is traditionally a culture\nthat values a home where many generations live together and\nwhere the family collectively assumes responsibility for the\nelderly or infirm within the home and where young people at\nwork and university traditionally stay at home until they start\ntheir own family. In Norway, the high taxation system sup-\nports a comprehensive welfare state that in turn provides for\nstate care of the elderly or sick--Thus, the collective responsi-\nbility is not to provide a home for all generations but to con-\ntribute to the welfare state via paying one's taxes. It is not\ntherefore the norm to take care of elderly parents personally.\nThe state pension scheme alleviates the financial responsibil-\nity of taking care of the elderly. To sum up, mean In-Group\nCollectivism scores for Norway and her Scandinavian part-\nDenmark: 3.53 (both in band C).\nProject GLOBE's Power Distance\nWithin a Scandinavian Framework\nPower Distance is defined as the degree to which members\nof an organization or society expect and agree that power\nshould be stratified and concentrated at higher levels of an\norganization or government (House et al., 2004). McClelland\nthat effective managers were characterized primarily by\ntheir need for power. Bass (1985) posits that charismatic\nattributes and behaviors play an important role in Power\nDistance. Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter (1966) explored the\ndifferences in preferences for power among different cul-\ntures. Hofstede (2001) posits that the three most significant\npredictors of relative position on the Power Distance con-\ntinuum are (a) latitude--distance from the equator, (b) popu-\nlation size, and (c) wealth--GNP per capita. Geographical\nlatitude in a region predicts the variance in Power Distance,\nwith a decrease in Power Distance as distance from the\nequator increases.\nAs population increases, its members accept a political\npower that is more distant and less accessible than smaller\nsocieties. In terms of the third predictor of Power Distance,\nnamely, wealth per capita, this relationship is explained by\nHofstede as the fact that societal wealth is directly correlated\nto the growth of the middle class, which can act as a bridge\nbetween the powerless and the powerful.As presented above,\nNorway's post\u00adWorld War II regional development policy\nhas encouraged industry and work opportunities in all\nregions in Norway.\nNorway's mean score of 4.13 in the Power Distance\ndimension depicts Norway as a low Power Distance society,\nin keeping with her Scandinavian profile. Such low Power\nDistance values in Scandinavia are manifested in certain\naspects of Norwegian business practices such as little use of\nformal titles, dress codes, and attitudes to practical tasks in\nthe workplace. Most organizations do not adhere to strict\ndress codes to show status. Even in institutions such as par-\nliamentary offices and legal institutions, a senior member\nmay be dressed as informally as a junior staff member. Titles\nor last names are rarely used when addressing others, even if\nthey are of senior rank.Another element of Power Distance--\nthe roles and hierarchy within a society--is mirrored in the\negalitarian practices at work. In company canteens, for\nexample, all staff, whether directors or junior staff, pick up\ntheir food themselves in the staff canteen in an orderly man-\nner and dispose of uneaten food and used plates. Canteens\nare almost never segregated on a basis of position.\nAs a society that expects and agrees that power should be\nequally shared, the Norwegian progressive and comprehen-\nsive tax system, the high union membership, and the gener-\nous welfare state exemplify systems that are in place to\nprotect and promote egalitarian values. Holmberg and\n\u00c5kerblom (2007) discuss elements of low Power Distance\nseen outside the workplace in Sweden. These cultural ele-\nments can be seen to be equally pertinent to the discussion of\nPower Distance within a Norwegian context. Burial grounds\nfor instance, are generally similar for everyone, regardless of\nfamily wealth or social status. Nor is the ability to get on a\nbus or any other public transportation helped by personal sta-\ntus as such: Everybody is obliged to queue (Holmberg &\n\u00c5kerblom, 2007). Thus, egalitarian values are promoted on a\nnational and company level.\nTo sum up, the mean scores in Power Distance for the\ncountries in this study are as follows: Denmark: 3.89 (band\n(band B, moderate). Indeed, these results support the find-\nings from Lindell and Arvonen (1996) that a dominant\nTable 5.

Table 6 offers a summary of Power\nDistance.\nProject GLOBE's Humane Orientation\nWithin a Scandinavian Framework\nThe concept of \"urban helpfulness\" is an important concept\nin relation to this cultural dimension. Project GLOBE claims\nthat there is a correlation between decreasing unhelpfulness\nand urbanization with increasing population density (House\nism, benevolence, kindness, love, and generosity are salient\nmotivating factors guiding people's behavior in societies\ncharacterized by a strong Humane Orientation. Rokeach's\nsupport this proposition. Schwartz posits that the central\nnorms of a society can be categorized based on their position\non the bipolar dimensions of Self-Transcendence (including\nvalues of tolerance and protection of others) versus Self-\nEnhancement (self-gratification; House et al., 2004). A sup-\nporting theory to this is Espen-Anderson's studies of welfare\nstates and their relationship to Humane Orientation (Espen-\nAnderson & Korpi, 1987). The social democratic model of a\nwelfare state in Scandinavia is claimed to be more humanely\noriented compared with the liberal model exemplified in\nEngland and the United States. The social democratic model\nin Scandinavia recognizes the personal rights of all individu-\nals as an element of universal welfare rights, whereas the\nliberal model found in England and the United States offers\nwelfare state on a proportionally means-tested basis (House\net al., 2004). Table 7 below offers an overview of the main\ntraits of this dimension.\nThe scores in Humane Orientation for the countries in this\nstudy are highest for Norway: 4.81 (band A, high), followed\nby Denmark: 4.44 (band B, moderate to high) and Sweden:\n4.10 (band C, moderate to low). The social concern that is\ncharacteristic of Norway is captured in part by this dimen-\nsion, where Norway scores rather highly. At a regional level,\nhistorically, as a predominately agricultural and fishing\nnation, local communities living in harsh climates have tra-\nditionally helped each other in times of need. Even today, the\nphilosophy of \"civic duty\" and taking part in a dugnad (vol-\nuntary local help projects) remain a part of daily life in most\nregions in Norway, but to a lesser extent in large cities.\nProject GLOBE's Uncertainty Avoidance\nWithin a Scandinavian Context\nUncertainty Avoidance is the extent to which members of an\norganization or society strive to avoid uncertainty by relying\non established social norms, rituals, and bureaucratic prac-\ntices. People in high Uncertainty Avoidance cultures actively\nseek to decrease the probability of unpredictable future\nevents that could adversely affect the operation of an organi-\nzation or society, and remedy the success of such adverse\npeople in societies create coping mechanisms to handle the\nanxiety produced by excessive uncertainty. He notes that\ntechnology has helped us to defend ourselves against uncer-\ntainties caused by nature and the law, and against uncertainty\nin the behavior of others and religion, and to accept the\nuncertainties we cannot defend ourselves against (Hofstede,\nThe GLOBE study of Uncertainty Avoidance practices\nrevealed high correlations between high Uncertainty\nTable 6.

The Norwegian government has introduced support-\nive initiatives countrywide to support industry and welfare in\nall districts, and Norway scored high on Future Orientation.\nTable 8 below offers a summary of the key traits associated\nwith this dimension:\nExamples of uncertainty reduction and protection mea-\nsures in Norway and also in her Scandinavian neighbors\ninclude the high value placed on the comprehensive welfare\nsystem with generous social security payments for sick\nleave, long-term disability, unemployment, and maternity\nand paternity pay. A second Norwegian institution that mir-\nrors the value placed on Uncertainty Avoidance is the\nombudsman system--a system of checks and balances that\nprotects individuals against misgovernment in the legal or\npublic administration systems. Another element of\nNorwegian culture that is reflected in the sense of order in\nsociety is people's approach to time. The social norm is to\nalways be \"on time\" for both business meetings and social\ngatherings. Agendas are frequently distributed in business\nmeetings and social club meetings, and even for birthdays,\nweddings, and christenings, to ensure a sense of order. In this\nway, good time keeping and the ethos of sticking to agreed\ntimes is important in the maintenance of good social rela-\ntions, both in working and private life in Norway. The mean\ncountry scores for Uncertainty Avoidance showed a high\nlevel for all Scandinavian countries with Denmark and\nSweden falling into band A with the following scores:\nKey Economic Data\nTable 9 below summarizes key data for the countries in this\nstudy in terms of Gross Domestic Product, population den-\nsity, Corruption Perception Index, and Global\nCompetitiveness. The Global Competitiveness Report\n(2010), published by the World Economic Forum \" assesses\nthe ability of countries to provide high levels of prosperity\nto their citizens, as it measures the set of institutions, poli-\ncies and factors that set the sustainable current and medium-\nterm levels of prosperity\"(World Economic Forum, 2010).\nSummary of Findings on\nScandinavian Cultural Practices\nTo summarize, although the Scandinavian cultures studied\nin this intercultural research appear ostensibly similar, the\nresults illustrate Ashkansy's (1997) point, that such research\ncan reveal subtle but important cultural differences in\nnations that are similar yet dissimilar. All three societies\nappear intrinsically egalitarian, they appear to value low\nPower Distance, directness, and consensus in decision mak-\ning and to promote Gender Egalitarianism. Nevertheless,\nthere are significant differences in the degrees of commit-\nment to these values by each individual Scandinavian part-\nner. These differences need to be understood and appreciated\nto avoid misunderstandings. The hallmark of Norwegian\ncultural practices within a Scandinavian context was seen to\nbe higher Gender Egalitarianism. The most pronounced\nNorwegian cultural values within a Nordic framework were\nalso lower Power Distance and higher Humane Orientation\nvalues.\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this article was twofold: first, to map con-\ntemporary Norwegian cultural practices within a\nScandinavian context in relation to the author's recent doc-\ntoral research and project GLOBE findings (House et al.,\n2004), and second, to briefly introduce the argument that\nculture matters in Scandinavian academic research, by offer-\ning a summary of published research in the last decade\nwhere culture has been a variable. A future direction for\nresearch could be a more in-depth meta-analysis of such\nstudies.\nThere is no shortage of advice available to managers\nabout how to succeed with a new project in a culturally dif-\nferent region. Unfortunately much of this can be superficial\nas it only focuses on the practical elements of etiquette, such\nas \"speak in a low voice in Asia and avoid eye contact with\nfemales in Japan.\" On the other end of the scale, we might be\ngiven only general advice such as \"always be ethical.\" What\nis important to bear in mind here, however, is that what\nmight be seen as ethical business behavior in one country\nmay not be the same in another (Warner-S\u00f8derholm, 2010a).\nTable 8. Key Elements of Uncertainty Avoidance\nSocieties with higher Uncertainty Avoidance Societies with lower Uncertainty Avoidance\nShow a stronger desire to establish rules and have less tolerance for\nthe breaking of rules\nHave a higher tolerance for risk taking\nDocument agreements in legal contracts Rely on the word of others they trust rather than the contractual\narrangement\nTake more moderate risks Show more tolerance for breaking rules\nShow a stronger desire to establish rules, agendas, and routines Are less concerned with orderliness and the maintenance of records\n8 SAGE Open\nAs discussed earlier in this paper, culture matters. Subtle\nbut disturbing differences may surface when representatives\nfrom neighboring regions in Scandinavia work together. As\ndepicted in the literature review of Scandinavian cultural\nresearch during the last decade (appendix), culture impacts a\nwide range of business issues from investment activities,\nenvironmental commitment, social responsibility, manage-\nment practices, and dealing with crises to employee rela-\ntions. Management practices in Norway differ in subtle ways\nfrom those of her Scandinavian counterparts because\nNorwegians tend to place greater value on directness, stron-\nger Gender Egalitarianism values, and a greater tolerance for\nuncertainty. Furthermore, Norway's higher scores in Humane\nOrientation and In-Group Collectivist scores indicate a\nstronger focus on a more paternal, inclusive style of\nmanagement in Norway. While these differences are not\nmajor, their combined effects may have consequences in cer-\ntain situations. If a manager from Sweden operates in a more\nhierarchical, assertive manner in Norway, this could have a\nnegative impact on the outcome of the negotiation.\nFurthermore, a statement could be made by a Danish consul-\ntant such as, \"I'm afraid that we believe that the company\nshould consider cutbacks.\" The manager from Norway might\nhave phrased this message as, \"You, you have make cut-\nbacks!\" Knowledge about such specific cultural characteris-\ntics can help team members from different regions value and\nanticipate differences. Potential problems such as interper-\nsonal conflict that leads to stress and unnecessary personal\nstrain and potential loss of revenues can then be minimized.\nClearly, culture does matter.\nTable 9.
