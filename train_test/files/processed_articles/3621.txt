    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of this study was to consider the social representations of death of family caregivers in a palliative care context.\nThe authors focused on the analysis of 23 interviews with family caregivers who cared for a terminally ill person at home and/\nor in a specialized palliative care unit, in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. The finding showed that family caregivers had different images that\nspecifically represented death: (a) losses as different kinds of \"deaths,\" (b) palliative care as a place to negotiate with death,\nand (c) last times as confirmation of the end. These images highlight the meaning attributed to the body and the position of\nthe dying person in our Western society. Representations of palliative care reveal a kind of paradox, a place of respect and\nof \"gentle death,\" and a place where death is almost too omnipresent. They also show the strong beliefs surrounding the\nuse of painkillers at the end of life. Finally, these images refer to end-of-life personal rituals viewed as support for the passage\ninto a new state of being. This study provides a better understanding of the common sense of death for family caregivers in\na palliative care context and of the meanings of this emotional subject.\n",

In 1915, Freud said that nobody believes in their\nown death and human beings avoid broaching the subject with\nsomeone nearing death. However, death is the oldest reality\nshared by all of humankind and is the only thing of which all\nhumans can be certain. Many thinkers have considered the\nevolution of representations of death throughout time, as seen\nAttitudes to death have profoundly changed in the last cen-\nturies, as have the associated social representations--cultural\nproductions that facilitate our comprehension of social phe-\n(1970) referred to it as the crisis of death. According to Ari\u00e8s\n(1975), from the Middle Ages to the first half of the 19th cen-\ntury, people were on more familiar terms with death and\ndying. There was a collective notion of destiny in which death\nwas accepted as part of life. The dying process was a public\nevent in which family, friends, neighbors, and children would\ngather and everyone knew their role. Death was seen as a bio-\nlogical phenomenon manifested by a series of natural signals\nknown by the dying (Ari\u00e8s, 1975). Death occurred when there\nwas a complete and irrevocable cessation of vital functions.\nThe integration of religion into activities of daily life also\ninfluenced attitudes and representations of death. The dying\nwould place themselves in God's hands. For the family, death\nwas God's will (Ari\u00e8s, 1975) and the soul became immortal\n(Morin, 1970). However, the combined impact of medical\nadvances, the decline of religion, the affirmation of the indi-\nvidual, and the value placed on individual autonomy have\ndramatically altered our relationship with death (Ari\u00e8s, 1975;\nLarouche, 1991). There is an urgent desire to defeat death\nand disease, which is thought to be evidence of the failure of\nWestern medicine to maintain youth and health (Clavandier,\nThese changes are also evident in the process of dying. In\ntoday's society, death usually takes place in care institutions\nperson has lived at home throughout the course of his or her ill-\nness. Biomedical practices shape our understanding of the\nparameters of death (Kaufman & Morgan, 2005) and how we\nrecognize the end of life (Glaser, Strauss, & Anselm, 1966;\nconsequence of illness and old age, but the result of a series of\n1InterActions Research Center, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada\n2University of Quebec in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nSabrina Lessard, InterActions Research Center, CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'\u00cele-\nde-Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada H3M 2X6.\nEmail: sabrina.lessard.bcstl@ssss.gouv.qc.ca\nFamily Caregivers' Social Representations\nof Death in a Palliative Care Context\nSabrina Lessard1, Bernard-Simon Leclerc1,\nand Suzanne Mongeau2\n Keywords\nsocial representations, death, family caregiver, palliative care, end-of-life\n2 SAGE Open\nprocess unfolds in stages, sometimes making it difficult to rec-\nognize death when it actually comes, with the loss of conscious-\nness or the cessation of vital functions (Clavandier, 2009).\nDeath and medical assistance for the dying are important\nconcerns in contemporary social and political spheres, as\nshown by a recent public consultation on Bill 52 in Qu\u00e9bec,\nCanada, held by the Select Committee on Dying with Dignity\n(2012), which resulted in passage of the Act Respecting End-\nof-Life Care in June 2014 (scheduled to come into force in\nDecember 2015). The right to receive palliative care and\nmedical aid in dying is the central theme of this legislation.\nToday, family members who care for a loved one are gener-\nally known as \"family caregivers,\" a concept developed in\nrecent decades within a specific context. The concept became\nentrenched in the wake of the \"ambulatory shift\" reform, med-\nical advances, increased life expectancy, and the existence of\nchronic illnesses that vested the family caregiver with a new\nlevel of responsibility for a sick loved one that can extend over\nmany years, until the person's death (Wierzbowski, 2008).\nThe palliative care approach emerged in the late 1960s,\nand diverse health institutions set up the practice of this new\narea of care (Hintermeyer, 2010). Palliative care has under-\nlined the importance of easing pain and suffering in the dying\nprocess. For Rossi (2010), the palliative approach can be\nseen as a collective response to the fear of death. In relation\nto these observations, what are family caregivers' social rep-\nresentations of death after the experience of accompanying a\ndying loved one in a palliative care context? The aim of this\narticle is to explore the social representations of death of\nbereaved family caregivers.\nFew studies have been done on the social representations of\npatients (Lawton, 2002) and the general public (D'H\u00e9rouville,\n2010) with regard to palliative care, cancer, and the elderly in\nDany, Cannone, Dudoit, & Duffaud, 2010). To our knowl-\nedge, no study has been undertaken on the specific social rep-\nresentations of death of family caregivers in a palliative care\ncontext. Considering the literature, we think this study is par-\nticularly relevant to two fields of interest. First, from a scien-\ntific perspective, the study of social representations can help\nprovide a better understanding of the common sense of death\nfor family caregivers in a palliative care context. Second, try-\ning to understand different meanings can help to improve the\npractices of professionals who care for dying patients. Death is\nan emotional subject; it generates emotional reactions that can\naffect behavior and the mourning process.\nThe Concept of Social Representations\nOften used in social sciences, social representations refer to a\nvariety of meanings, boundaries, and definitions (Mannoni,\n2010). They are defined as an organized structure of beliefs,\nopinions, attitudes, images, and information constructed around\nwhich help humans understand the world, and guide actions\nand behaviors (Mannoni, 2010). They are an instrument of\ncommunication. Representations are part of an individual's\nuniverse and are constructed through interaction with others\n(Bellavance, 2011). As reported by Doise (Doise & Palmonari,\nmeaning are aspects of social representations. Each image is\nlinked to a meaning, and each meaning is linked to an image.\nTheir function is to transform an unusual phenomenon into a\nfamiliar one (Jodelet, 1989). They help to explain reality (Doise\nAccording to Seca (2010), representations take form and grow\nin daily conversation and are associated with specific situa-\ntions. The relationship to others and to the world is then modi-\nfied (Jodelet, 1989). Social representations are studied to learn\na group's common sense of a specific context. The representa-\ntions of death in palliative care generate images. The core ele-\nments of these representations generate the most commonly\nexpressed images (Moliner, 2008). They are commonly used to\ndescribe and understand their inherent meanings. They are\nessential to understanding emotionally charged topics such as\ndeath and palliative care (Bellavance, 2011).\nMaterials and Method\nThe data used for this article were initially gathered for an\nearlier study (forthcoming) conducted in an integrated uni-\nversity health and social services center (CIUSSS) in the\nnorth of Montr\u00e9al to assess the needs of family caregivers\nand services provided to end-of-life patients in palliative\ncare. Family caregivers spoke spontaneously about their\nexperiences, evoking powerful images of what death repre-\nsented for them. We decided to proceed with a secondary\nanalysis of the data to explore the social representations of\ndeath of family caregivers in a palliative care context.\nThe initial study used a mixed-methods design that drew on\ndata from different sources (family caregivers and profession-\nals, semi-structured interviews, a cross-sectional survey, and\nmedical databases) but, for the purpose of this study, we focused\nonly on an analysis of 23 interviews with family caregivers who\nhad cared for a terminally ill person at home and/or in a special-\nized palliative care unit (only one person died at home).\nCaregivers were initially selected according to the follow-\ning criteria: (a) has benefited from palliative care services at\nhome and/or in the specialized palliative care unit in the ter-\nritory of the CIUSSS, (b) is the principal caregiver in the\npatient's medical records, (c) has taken care of the terminally\nill person in the last 3 to 6 months, and (d) is willing to par-\nticipate in a face-to-face interview. The first authors con-\ntacted them by phone before meeting with them. Eighteen\nwomen and five men participated between December 2012\n(four), niece (one), and son-in-law (one).\nLessard et al. 3\nAn open-ended interview guide was developed with several\nrelevant sections: evolution of the disease, experience with care\nand death, experience with palliative care services, needs of\ncaregivers, social and cultural aspects of support, both given\nand received, and interaction with the formal and informal net-\nwork. The interviews were conducted by a research officer and\nanthropologist (first author), at the caregiver's chosen loca-\ntion--home, caf\u00e9, or a private room in the CIUSSS. Interviews\nwere done in French or English and lasted from 30 to 120 min\n(Lessard, Leclerc, & Mongeau, 2014). All interviews were\nrecorded (with written consent) and transcribed.\nThe study was approved by the executive director of the\ninstitution and conducted in accordance with the provincial\nhealth and social services act and the ethical standards of the\nuniversity institution (Leclerc et al., 2014; Minist\u00e8re de la\nsant\u00e9 et des services sociaux [MSSS], 2007). Participants\nwere clearly informed that their participation was voluntary\nand anonymity was preserved.\nData Analysis\nWe used a qualitative thematic analysis to enhance the under-\nstanding of the family caregivers' social representations of\ndeath. Using QDAMiner Software, we examined the materi-\nals by breaking the interviews into small units of categories\n(Negura, 2006) focused on social representations of death\n(Vaismoradi, Turunen, & Bondas, 2013). As empirical stud-\nies on our subject are poorly documented, we used an induc-\ntive open manner to identify different images representing\ndeath. The thematic analysis provided us with an overview of\nthe data within the specific context (Vaismoradi et al., 2013)\nof palliative care. The first author analyzed the content of\neach interview, and the other two authors validated the results\nin several consultation sessions. The images reported by\ninterviewees emphasized the meaning of the social represen-\ntations of death expressed by the family caregivers.\nQualitative coding underlined family caregivers' social rep-\nresentations of death and those of the person they cared for\nthrough the end-of-life process.\nResults\nThe analysis of the interviews showed that family caregivers\nhad different images that specifically represented death. The\nimages are personal, but together, they reveal a common sense\nof death in the palliative care context. We grouped the images\ninto three separate categories: (a) losses as different kinds of\n\"deaths,\" (b) palliative care unit as a place to negotiate with\ndeath, and (c) last times as confirmation of the end. These differ-\nent images represent non-linear steps in the end-of-life process,\nbut they were all lived in a palliative care context (Table 1).\nLosses as Different Kinds of \"Deaths\"\nFamily caregivers reported that the care process occurs over\na period punctuated by major changes, all associated with\nlosses. They happen at different points during the illness.\nEach of the following images was linked with death and was\nsignificant for the dying person and/or for the caregiver.\nFailing bodies. The interviews show how the transformation of\nthe physical body is associated with death. The family care-\ngivers described the deterioration of the person's physical\ncondition. This was often a slow process, lasting from hours\nto months, depending on the type and stage of the disease, but\nwith the constant awareness of the imminence of the ultimate\nloss. Disturbing images were associated with the deteriora-\ntion of the body. A caregiver described her feelings about her\nsister when she realized she could not stand up anymore.\nI found it difficult, when she was not able to get up anymore.\nShe was bedridden and always asleep. I found it rough. It was\nthe announcement of the beginning of the end. So it slaps you in\nthe face.\nA daughter explained one of the last mental images she\nhad of her mother\nSometimes, I have this image in my head. The swollen chest, the\nmouth wide open and her despairing eyes. I had never seen eyes\nlike this.And this, it hit me, the ears were glued to her head. That\nmeant not a lot of time left to live.\nAnother woman mentioned that her mother compared her\nbody with a puzzle falling apart:\nIn the morning, she told me, \"It is true my daughter, it is today\nthat I am leaving.\" She told me: \"it is as if my body was falling\napart, it leaves me. It is like a puzzle.\" At one point, she had two\nmouths, three stomachs. And she wasn't on morphine.\nThe significance of these different images was clear for\nthese women; the deterioration of the body was directly\nTable 1.

For some of them, these images\nwill remain in their minds long after their loved one's death.\nSocial death. Family caregivers described how their loved one\nsuffered due to the loss of belongings or social status for which\nthey had worked all their lives. Their exclusion was dual in\nnature, experienced in terms of their perception of themselves\nand the perception of others. The image of the loss of them-\nselves was clearly associated with the end. At this point, they\nfelt the loss of their social status. A spouse described how her\nhusband's physical condition affected his job:\nHe had injuries around his nose . . . At that point, she (their boss)\ncalled me and told me: \"I am sorry but I am obliged to tell you\nthat you can't come and do your show anymore because the\nresidents are in shock from seeing Roger (her sick husband) in\nthis condition.\"\nAnother caregiver described her mother's feelings about\nher belongings as she lived through the last stage of her life:\nThat's what she told me: \"My daughter, I have no control over\nmy life anymore. I have no car anymore, no house anymore, no\nmore projects, I have nothing left except my head.\" Her goal\nwas to keep her mind as long as possible.\nThe image of dispossession is a strong one.\nVanishing quality of life. This image spoke to the relationship\nbetween quality of life and death. Many family caregivers\nspoke about this. For some people, the loss of quality of life\nmeant acceptance of the dying process. Some of those who\nwere dying had no hope their condition would improve and\nwanted the situation to stop. They associated it with their life\ncoming to an end. Two daughters reported their respective\nmother's speech near the end:\nWhen she had her heart attack, she shouldn't . . . she wasn't to\ngo back home. Her quality of life was gone. She said to us\n\"There is no quality of life for me, and there won't be any in the\nfuture. I will go from one hospital to another.\" At that point, she\ndecided to stop everything (treatment).\nShe used to say: \"I have no more quality of life, it is crap. I am\nno longer able to stand up anymore and to go pee by myself. I\ncan't live in such conditions\" . . . She was sick, she had no more\nquality of life and it was her choice, she pushed to end it. She\nwasn't scared.\nTransformation of the loved one. When an ill person undergoes\na major change in their behavior, this is evoked by the image\nof the transformation of the loved one. The behaviors induced\nby the end-of-life process deeply affected some family care-\ngivers who felt they could barely recognize the \"new\" loved\none. For one husband, he experienced his first real loss when\nhe saw the transformation of his wife's behavior. The person\nhe used to know, at that point, was gone. \"All her gentleness,\nshe lost her gentleness . . . She was a really gentle and sweet\nperson. She began to die before dying. And I couldn't do\nanything. It was difficult.\"\nBreak in the bond of communication.This representation\noccurred during the end-of-life process, and therefore, some\nfamily caregivers felt the real loss when their loved one went\ninto a coma, before the person's actual death. The image of a\nbroken bond of communication represented the end. The loss\nof consciousness was viewed as the irremediable end of\ncommunication with the loved one. A daughter described her\nsense of loss when she realized that her mother was about to\nlose her mind:\nI can say that the most difficult moment was when the link\nbroke, when my mother said \"my daughter, it is true, I am\nleaving.\" And then, the relationship stopped with my mother. I\nfound it so difficult not being able to communicate with her\nanymore.\nPalliative Care Unit as a Place to Negotiate With\nDeath\nInterview respondents reported different representations of\nthe palliative care unit, confirming the personal meaning of\npalliative care. For all of them, the palliative care unit was a\nplace of great service, and at the same time, it represented the\narrival of death. They referred to different images.\nPalliative care unit as the last home. On one hand, family care-\ngivers see palliative care services as a release from the\nresponsibility of caring for their loved one. At the same time,\nit confirmed the reality of approaching death. The act of\nmoving from home to the palliative care unit was experi-\nenced by family caregivers as a moment when they were\nconfronted with the end. For many, the palliative care unit\nwas seen as \"the last home,\" \"the end.\" A spouse expressed\nhow she experienced the departure of her husband from their\nfamily home to the palliative care unit:\nI heard a lot about the palliative care unit. That it was really nice.\nI can confirm it, it was really nice. When they arrive (ill person)\nat that stage, there is a kind of detachment . . . When he left in\nthe ambulance, he knew he was not coming back, it was really\nemotional.\nThis departure was also experienced as a failure by some\nfamily caregivers, and the care unit seemed to represent a\nplace of death. They judged themselves as having failed in\ncaring for their relative. This was especially true when the\nstay in the unit was too short for them to appreciate the pal-\nliative approach offered by the professionals.\nI could have had some great moments. The only image I have\nleft, is of my wife making a grimace while receiving a shot from\nLessard et al. 5\nthe nurse. It is the last vital sign I remember. She was at the\npalliative care unit for three days.\nAs mentioned above, the palliative care unit was associ-\nated with both attentive care and death. It was difficult for\nfamily caregivers to hide the end-of-life process from their\nloved one, especially when the subject had been avoided.\nThe image of death remained engraved in the mind. A son\nexplained how he dealt with hiding the situation from his\nfather, because it was so strongly associated with death.\nI pretended like palliative care was just like this but he knew\nwhat it meant, palliative care. \"You, you won't die. Forget it, the\ndoctor only signed for you to get a room and look at the services\nyou get.\" He played the game with me. But at one point, there\nwere people dying next to him . . . I found it rough.\nDeath comes wrapped in a white cloth.A strong image of\ndeath represented in palliative care is that of the dead\nwrapped in a white cloth. Family caregivers often expressed\nacceptance of the arrival of death. However, the analysis\nshowed that seeing people dying in the palliative care unit\nconfronted them directly with the reality. Many of the family\ncaregivers mentioned the negative effect on their morale of\nknowing and seeing people dying close by. Death was too\nclose. A daughter spoke of finding out that nine people died\nin one night at the palliative care unit. \"There are 12 bed-\nrooms, only three were still occupied. Over the night, nine . . .\nGod, it gives you a slap in the face!\" A husband stressed his\ndiscomfort with the fact that his wife was aware of the death\nof others around her:\nThere is only one thing that was hard. I don't know if they can\ndo something to improve the situation. When there is a new\nperson who arrives (ill person in the palliative care unit), they\nshould put them in a wing for people more in shape . . . Once,\nshe (his wife) said hello to someone, and the day after, he was\ncovered up dead. There were three who died during her stay . . .\nOnce, she saw somebody who just died. The effect this had on\nher . . . two days later there was another. Whatever, I don't know,\nI speak on her behalf even if she knew why she was there.\nThe goodbye injection. The interviews showed that palliative\ncare was viewed as a way of dying without extreme physical\nsuffering. \"That's why we lived at the palliative care unit,\nthese were palliative care services because you feel and\nobserve all the medical assistance for physical and physio-\nlogical well-being.\" \"I can say that she did not suffer. At the\nunit, each time a professional saw her in pain, they gave her\nan injection.\"\nHowever, there was a strong representation shared by\nfamily caregivers of the \"goodbye injection.\" The painkiller\ninjection was viewed as a medical act to ease pain and induce\ndeath, especially when the ill person fell into a semi-coma\nand then died. They reported having accepted medical care to\nrelieve the pain, and some of them felt guilty after having\naccepted such care. Here are a few of the quotes expressed\nby different family caregivers. \"The hardest moment was\nwhen I realized what I'd said yes for; the perfusion to relieve\nthe psychological distress. It was the goodbye injection.\"\nThe doctor gave his authorization to put her in a deep coma . . .\nI thought it was a natural process, that it was the natural\nevolution. \"She has been getting shots,\" everybody said. OK\nfine, stop telling me, now I know.\nOther family caregivers mentioned witnessing the normal\ncourse of the dying process. They explained the necessity of\nthe pain medication and its link with the dying process. \"And\nthen, they started to give morphine on Wednesday. The\nFriday around noon, he had his injection and he fell asleep. It\nwas finished, he died at midnight.\"\nThe injection, for others, seemed to be a way to shorten\nthe dying process:\nUntil her last moment when she was able to communicate,\nespecially the very last moment, she found it really long. She\nwas looking forward to the end . . . My sister tried to influence\nthe formal caregivers to increase the morphine doses or I don't\nknow what . . . even if she was ready to die, at one point, she\ndidn't have any control on her thoughts, her body strived. It\nwanted to stay, survival instinct.\nLast Times as Confirmation of the End\nThe end-of-life process was reported to be associated with\ndifferent ways of saying goodbye. Family caregivers spoke\nabout their experiences with their relative while approaching\nthe end. Their different actions or behaviors were a kind of\nritual surrounding death, and they were linked to images.\nLast time.Mostly, family caregivers reported having orga-\nnized a last get-together for their loved one with family and\nfriends. The event was a moment to say good things about the\npast and wishes for the future. It was a chance to give the sick\nperson pleasure and see he or she had everything he or she\nwanted. Family caregivers experienced different last moments.\nI knew how to please her for her birthday . . . party hat for the\nmother, big strawberry shortcake, she was happy. Because\neverybody knew it was her last birthday, she knew it as well. We\ntook pictures and had cake.\nFor others, it was an opportunity to say goodbye\nMy mother used to call her people to say goodbye . . . She called\nher friends and told them, \"I just want to say that I am at the\nhospital and that I am leaving. I wanted to say goodbye.\"\nA spouse explained how the ritual continued once her\nhusband died as a way to accompany him. It was the first step\nin the memory of the living.\n6 SAGE Open\nWe put some candles in the bedroom and classic music that he\nused to like. My son-in-law got a bottle of wine and gave us a\nfull glass and \"cheers\" . . . It was OK, it was a kind of closure.\nDeath conversation. The image of the death conversation was\nomnipresent in the interviews. Family caregivers reported\nthat it was difficult to speak directly of death. They told us\nhow uncomfortable they were about broaching the death\nconversation with their loved one. Many of them then felt\nsorry they had avoided the subject. We explored different\nways of approaching the death conversation, for instance, to\nplan funerals and other logistical issues with the dying\nperson.\nWe had made her will. We had the talk but she counted on me, it\nwas to my discretion because she had difficulty talking about\ndeath. She was really scared . . . When we talked about death or\nthat she knew that she was about to die, she used to get upset.\nWe also observed that some family caregivers saw the\ndeath conversation as an overly strong representation of\ndeath to the point it became a taboo subject. Some decided to\ntake the opposite stance and evoke a positive vision of future\nhealth conditions. They said they did this to protect their\nloved one.\nShe was so scared to die. We did not . . . I did not talk about\ndeath with her. However, I tried to encourage her, to tell her that\nshe would get better. She would feel better, maybe tomorrow she\nwould feel better still. But . . . how long can we lie to try to\nchange the patient's vision? At one point, she couldn't get up.\nSo, it was just to say that we were there for her and that it was to\nbe for the best.\nRespondents also emphasized the difficulty of communi-\ncating with a dying person. One caregiver reported he\nretreated into silence while trying to talk with his wife. He\ndid not know what to talk about with her. The past, the future,\nor everyday conversation was not an option for him. He\nadopted the silence of death.\nIn the last months, I was not able to talk anymore. Luckily, my\nsister-in-law was there to listen to her. Me, I was unable to do so.\nThe kids used to tell me, \"Talk to her, talk to her.\" I told her, \"I\nwill always love you.\" It was the only thing I had to say.\nThe same man mentioned in the interview how he would\nhave liked professional accompaniment to face the difficult\nsituation. For him, the death conversation would have been\nan important moment.\nI learned something afterward. A friend of mine told me that\nwhen he was caring for his wife, they had access to a social\nworker. He (the social worker) talked with both of them, to the\nwife and to the husband. He made them ready for death. I think\nI would have loved to have that. It would have opened us up to\ntalk about it. We didn't talk about it at all.\nCall of death.Finally, family caregivers reported how they\nexperienced the arrival of death. Many of them knew it was\ncoming as they observed their loved one feeling and seeing\ndeath approach. The sick person's feelings were shared in\ndifferent ways. A spouse described it like this:\nThe last day he was mentally with us, the Easter Saturday. He\ndied the next Wednesday. During that day he began to say that\nhis brother was coming. \"Peter is coming, Peter is coming.\"\nPeter was his brother, who passed away many years ago. So\nthen, I knew that it was coming. When we begin to see dead\npeople, it was because we are engaged in that path.\nDiscussion\nSocial representations on the subject of death have been\nabundant over the years, from historical (Ari\u00e8s, 1975;\nempirical data, this study provides new knowledge about\nsocial representations of death in a palliative care context.\nThe article presents images spontaneously created by the\ncaregivers themselves that illustrate their vision of death.\nUsing a qualitative thematic analysis, we identified certain\nimages and the common sense that was ascribed to them. In\nall, we came up with three main groups of typical images: (a)\nlosses as different kinds of \"deaths,\" (b) palliative care unit\nas a place to negotiate with death, and (c) last times as a con-\nfirmation of the end.\nIt seemed appropriate to highlight the strongest images in\nsocial representations and to link them with the current social\ncontext. Our study distinguishes itself in two ways: the sub-\njects that were studied (family caregivers) and the context of\nthe study (palliative care). Both of these particularities are\ncharacteristic of our unique contemporary situation.\nImages of loss such as the failing body, the social death,\nand vanishing quality of life refer directly to the end of exis-\ntence and a person's death even before the person's physical\ndeath has occurred. These images highlight the meaning\nattributed to the body and the position of the dying person in\nAs a social object, the body is a key element of our identity\n(Clarke, Griffin, & Team, 2008), acting as a mirror that con-\nveys information about a person, and based on which others\nand the person herself or himself form judgments. The body\nis usually the focus of health, well-being, youth, and fitness\nthat must be maintained. It is therefore not surprising that\nwhen the body of a sick person begins to deteriorate and their\nappearance transforms into something that contrasts with the\nideals of health and beauty, the sick person feels excluded and\nfamily caregivers begin to evoke the approach of death. This\nsocial death (Lawton, 2002) occurring before the person's\nphysical death refers to the position of the dying person in our\nsociety, an ambiguous position because the sick person no\nlonger really belongs to the category of the living, but neither\nis she or he in the category of the dead (Clavandier, 2009).\nLessard et al. 7\nOur data revealed that powerful images are representing\npalliative care. They evoke a place permeated by respect and an\napproach focused on reducing the physical suffering caused by\na life that is on the wane. The sick no longer die suffering intol-\nerable pain. Palliative care may also, however, represent death;\nfamily caregivers described the image of the last place the\nloved one would live, and that of the dead person wrapped in a\nwhite cloth--the omnipresence of death around them. The pal-\nliative care unit is also the place where death is accelerated and\nwhere family caregivers mistook the soothing of pain through\nthe administration of a painkiller (usually refers to morphine)\nwith the \"goodbye\" injection. The possibility of hastening\ndeath may be strongly associated with the easing of suffering.\nThis representation generates genuine confusion among family\ncaregivers, and some felt responsible for the death of their\nloved one. The use of morphine and other medications to ease\npatients' suffering can alter their consciousness. This explains\nthe loss of consciousness or \"deep coma\" reported by some of\nthe caregivers. However, the literature on the subject tells us\nthat the administration of pain medication neither hastens nor\ndelays death (Rurup, Borgsteede, van der Heide, van der Maas,\nsentation may also be explained by the extensive media cover-\nage of the National Assembly of Qu\u00e9bec's public hearings on\ndying with dignity. Medical aid in dying, euthanasia, and\nassisted suicide have become the subject of a broad public\nIn light of these results, representations of palliative care reveal\na kind of paradox, a place of respect and a \"gentle death,\" and\na place where death is almost too omnipresent.\nFamily caregivers also spoke of images they associated\nwith end-of-life rituals such as the person's last moments, the\n\"death conversation,\" and the \"call of death.\" Death is a\ndefining moment, in which relational dynamics have a major\nimpact, both on the person who is dying and on the bereaved\nand the grieving process. The findings of our analysis show\nthat end-of-life rituals are individual and personal. They are\nconducted in private and most often only involve the family\nand immediate circle. This observation echoes a point\nrecently raised in the literature: Despite the individualized\npractices that have replaced traditional rites, individuals still,\nand will always, turn to rites in these circumstances\nsupport for the passage into a new state of being. They can\nalso be seen as a means of dealing with the anguish of loss.\nVarious representations of death are associated with a rup-\nture or change in the nature of communication with a loved\none. The break in the bond of communication happens when\nthe person goes into a coma or undergoes a behavior change,\nor when silence sets in because the caregiver sees no possi-\nbility of a future with his or her loved one. The comments of\nLe Breton (2004) concerning the imperative of communica-\ntion in our era highlight the feelings of unease or anxiety felt\nby family caregivers when they can no longer communicate\nwith the sick person approaching death. In light of Le\nBreton's (1992) remarks, we might well consider whether\nthis anxiety is not a product of Western society, which pro-\nmotes and creates the expectation of dialogue in all phases of\nlife. Some of the caregivers who participated in our study\nreported that their loved ones did not recognize their impend-\ning death although they were in a palliative care setting and\ntheir caregivers had been informed of the situation. Glaser\nand colleagues (1966) have described the mutual pretence as\na \"closed awareness\" context. These caregivers believed that\ntheir loved ones did not wish to know they were dying.\nWe believe it is important to examine the usefulness of these\nrepresentations for front-line practice and interventions. A con-\nsideration of the different social representations of death could\ngive health practitioners a fuller understanding of the attitudes\nof family caregivers and the diverse logic underpinning their\nactions. In this respect, our findings have highlighted the oper-\nating logic of family caregivers as not necessarily exclusively\nrational, but also rooted in the symbolic, relational, and emo-\ntional registers. The findings underline the importance of con-\ntinuing public information and education regarding the use of\nmorphine. Some family caregivers associated the injection of\nmorphine with the arrival of death, which caused them to feel\nguilt and frustration. The beliefs surrounding the use of mor-\nphine and other pain-relieving medication at the end of life are\nnumerous and appear to persist over time despite public aware-\nness activities by health care organizations. The numerous\ndeaths that occur in palliative care units remind family caregiv-\ners of approaching death in a manner that is almost brutal. We\nbelieve it would be appropriate to consider whether the reac-\ntions to these deaths might serve as a lever for addressing\nanguish about death and fears about the future (Arnault, 2004).\nLast, the representations associated with ruptures of communi-\ncation may be alleviated somewhat through professional sup-\nport in the form of mediators or facilitators to help the family\nand their loved one (Arnault, 2004). When the person who is\ndying goes into a coma and the communicational bond appears\nto be broken, professionals can use this as an opportunity to\nencourage the family caregiver to communicate using other\nmeans than words.\nThis qualitative study is still exploratory in nature, and\nresults cannot be generalized to other contexts, cultures, or\neras. A qualitative study does not generally seek to extrapo-\nlate the findings to the population in general, but rather aims\nto further investigate and better understand the phenomenon\nunder study. This research describes the social representa-\ntions of a culturally homogenous group, in other words, most\nof the individuals interviewed were born in Canada.\nConsidering the increasingly multicultural character of\nMontr\u00e9al, and Qu\u00e9bec in general, it is essential to consider,\nfor further research, this subject with individuals of various\nbackgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. Studies on family care-\ngivers' social representations of death in different contexts,\nsuch as long-term care facilities, could further contribute to\nour knowledge, given that all those who live in these centers\nspend their last moments of life there (Leclerc et al., 2014).\n8 SAGE Open\n"
