At the end of a 13-year follow-up period from cohort inception, cohort\nmembers seen for elder mistreatment at any time during the follow-up had poorer\nsurvival (9%) than either those seen for self-neglect (17%) or other noninvestigated\ncohort members (40%) (P.001). In a pooled logistic regression that adjusted for\ndemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, functional status, social networks,\ncognitive status, and depressive symptomatology, the risk of death remained\nelevated for cohort members experiencing either elder mistreatment (odds ratio,\nconfidence interval, 1.2-2.5), when compared with other members of the cohort.\nConclusions.--Reported and corroborated elder mistreatment and self-neglect\nare associated with shorter survival after adjusting for other factors associated with\nincreased mortality in older adults.\nFrom the Divisions of Geriatrics and Gerontology (Dr\nLachs) and General Internal Medicine (Dr Charlson),\nCornell University Medical College, New York, NY; the\nDepartments of Medicine and Epidemiology, Yale Uni-\nversity School of Medicine, New Haven, Conn (Ms Willi-\nams); the Connecticut Department of Social Services,\nHartford (Ms O'Brien); and the Cornell College of Hu-\nman Ecology, Ithaca, NY (Dr Pillemer).\nReprints:MarkS.Lachs,MD,DivisionofGeriatricsand\nGerontology, New York Hospital-Cornell University Medi-\npected to be a morbid and mortal entity,\nbutlittleisknownabouttheultimatefate\nof older victims of family violence. Stud-\nies have examined risk factors for mis-\ntreatment1-3 andprevalencesurveyshave\nin the most commonly cited study),4 but\nno longitudinal studies of survival of\nmistreated elderly persons have been\nconducted.\nWe previously completed a study that\nidentified risk factors for adult protec-\ntive service use and reported elder mis-\ntreatmentinalargegroupofolderadults\nfollowedupformorethanadecade.2,3,5 In\nthat research, we linked the records of a\nwell-characterizedcohortofcommunity-\ndwelling older adults interviewed annu-\nally(TheNewHavenEstablishedPopu-\nlation for Epidemiologic Studies in the\nElderly [EPESE]) with records from\nprotective services for the elderly from\nConnecticut, which was the official en-\ntity charged with the investigation of\nsuspected elder mistreatment. The goal\nwas to identify features of older adults\nthat would predict subsequent elder\nmistreatment.Aftercompletingthatre-\nsearch, it occurred to us that elder mis-\ntreatmentcouldbeviewednotonlyasan\nadverse outcome for these subjects, but\nalso as a risk factor itself for other ad-\nverseoutcomes,suchasmortality.Thus,\nwe were able to longitudinally examine\nthe mortality associated with elder mis-\ntreatmentinawell-characterizedcohort\nof community-dwelling older adults.\nMETHODS\nDescription of the Cohort\nThe New Haven EPESE study is 1 of\n4 cohorts funded by the National Insti-\ntute on Aging.6 In its inception year,\ncommunity-dwelling adults older than\n65yearsderivedfromastratifiedsample\nof residence types: public housing for el-\nderly persons (ie, age and income re-\nstricted), private housing for elderly\npersons (ie, age but not income re-\nstricted), and community (ie, no restric-\ntions).

A detailed description of the\nsampling strategy as well as the demo-\ngraphic, clinical, and other characteris-\ntics have been reported elsewhere.7\nAt baseline, subjects had a detailed in-\nterview covering broad medical, func-\ntional,demographic,andpsychosocialdo-\nmains. Standardized instruments were\nusedtoassesscognition,depressivesymp-\ntomatology, social networks, sources of\nemotional and other support, and chronic\nconditions.Subjectswereinterviewedev-\nery third year in person and annually by\ntelephone.Interraterreliabilitysubstud-\nies were conducted to ensure data qual-\nity and mortality follow-up is assumed to\nbe complete.

The law defines a group of manda-\ntory reporters who are likely to have fre-\nquent contact with older adults by virtue\nof their occupation (such as physicians,\nnurses,and socialservice providers), and\nmight therefore be in a position to iden-\ntify cases of suspected elder abuse. Re-\nports are made to a regional ombudsman\nintheelderlyprotectiveservicesdivision\nwho makes an on-site visit to the elderly\nperson to interview the client and any\nother involved party. Based on the infor-\nmation obtained, the ombudsman veri-\nfiesorrefutesasuspicionofmistreatment\nand assigns 1 or more of 3 designations\nto a case: abuse, neglect (including self-\nneglect), or exploitation. Elder abuse is\ndefinedasthewillfulinflictionofphysical\npain, injury, or mental anguish, or the\nwillful deprivation by a caretaker of ser-\nvices necessary to maintain physical and\nmental health. Neglect is defined as an\nelderly person alone who is not able to\nprovide himself/herself the services nec-\nessary to maintain physical and mental\nhealth, or who is not receiving those ser-\nvicesfromaresponsiblecaretaker.Thus,\nunder Connecticut definitions it is pos-\nsible to be self-neglected. Exploitation is\ndefined as taking advantage of an older\nadult for monetary gain or profit.\nThe ombudsman then develops a cli-\nent-specific care plan that is typically\nmultidisciplinary in nature and is in-\ntended to ensure safety while maximiz-\ning the autonomy of the older adult. In-\nterventionsvaryandmightincludehome\ncare, physician or other health care clini-\ncian referral, pursuit of guardianship, or\nnursing home placement.\nIdentification of Cohort Members\nSeen by the Ombudsman\nWeperformedamanualrecordmatch-\ning of EPESE and Connecticut Ombuds-\nman/Elderly Protective Service records\nto determine if any cohort members had\nbeen seen by the ombudsman during an\n11-year follow-up period from cohort in-\nmanual matching was performed in such\na way as to protect the confidentiality of\nall subjects involved (ie, so that elderly\nprotective services had no knowledge of\nwho EPESE cohort members were and\nEPESE investigators had no knowledge\nof which cohort members might have\nbeenseenbyelderlyprotectiveservices).\nThe protocol was approved by the insti-\ntutional review board, and the final\nmerged data set (which contained the\nstandardized EPESE data merged with\nelderly protective services\u00adderived in-\nformation about the nature of the prob-\nlems noted by the ombudsman in the\nhome investigation) had no information\nthat would permit the identification of\nany party.\nStrategy of Analysis\nAfter cohort members who were seen\nby protective services for the elderly\nwere identified, weighted 13-year sur-\nvival curves from cohort inception were\nconstructed for 3 subgroups of subjects:\n(1) those found to have sustained veri-\nfied elder mistreatment (abuse, neglect,\nand/or exploitation) by another person,\n(2) those seen by protective services for\ncorroborated self-neglect, or (3) other\nmembers of the cohort who had no con-\ntactwithelderlyprotectiveservices.Co-\nhort members who were seen by the om-\nbudsman, but who had no verified com-\nplaintswereexcluded.Allanalyseswere\nweighted and adjusted for the sampling\ndesign of the cohort.8\nMultivariate analysis was conducted\nwith all-cause mortality as the depen-\ndent variable. The goal of multivariate\nanalysis was to estimate the indepen-\ndent contribution of reported and cor-\nroboratedeldermistreatmentorself-ne-\nglect to all-cause mortality after adjust-\ning for other factors known to predict\nmortality. The group of cohort members\nnot seen by protective services for any\nreasonservedasthereferentgroup.The\ncategories of covariate characteristics\nwere demographic (age, sex, race, edu-\ncation, and income); health related (self-\nreported chronic conditions including\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, cancer,\ndiabetes,hypertension,andhipfracture,\nas well as body mass index in tertiles [a\nmeasure of weight in kilograms divided\nby the square of height in meters];\nphysical functioning (number of activi-\nties of daily living impairments [0 to 7]\nand number of Rosow-Breslau or Nagi\nand support (number of social ties,\nincluding marital status, frequent con-\ntact with friends and relatives, regular\nattendance at religious services, and\nparticipation in social or community\ngroups, and number of sources of emo-\ntional support; cognitive performance\n(Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status\nQuestionnaire [SPMSQ]11); and psycho-\nsocial domains (Center for Epidemio-\nlogical Studies Depression Scale12). For\nbody mass index and household income,\nwhich had more than 5% missing data,\ndummy variables were created for the\nmissingdatasothatthe2measurescould\nbe retained in the model.\nPooledlogisticregression13 wasusedto\nallow for updating the independent vari-\nables,includingreferraltoelderlyprotec-\ntive services as well as characteristics as-\ncertainedintheEPESEinterviews(such\nas depression scores and chronic condi-\ntions). Proportional hazards regression\ncouldnotbeusedbecausethedatadidnot\nmeettheassumptions.Manyofthepoten-\ntial confounders of the association be-\ntween elder mistreatment and mortality\nwere assessed at only the triennial face-\nto-face interviews, so we used 9 years of\nfollow-up divided into three 3-year inter-\nvals. According to this strategy, each of 3\nseparate record for each subject in the\npooled sample. For each record, the co-\nvariates were updated using the sub-\nject's status at the beginning of the inter-\nval. Likewise, the 3-level protective\nservices variable (no contact with protec-\ntive services for the elderly, corrobo-\nrated self-neglect, and corroborated mis-\ntreatmentbyanotherparty)wasupdated\nforeachintervalbyusingthedatesofom-\nbudsman investigation. The outcome for\neachintervalwaswhetherthesubjectdied\nduring that interval. Subjects who died\nwere dropped from subsequent inter-\nvals. Subjects who were seen by the om-\nbudsman but had no verified complaints\nduring follow-up (n=38) were excluded\nfromintervalssubsequenttotheirfirstin-\nvestigation, although we examined their\nsurvival separately.\nA series of 7 hierarchical models was\nconstructedtosequentiallyadjustfordo-\nmains of potential confounders of the as-\nsociation between elder mistreatment or\nself-neglectandmortality.Thefirstmodel\nincluded only an indicator for the 3-year\ninterval and dummy variables for self-\nneglectandeldermistreatmentwhilethe\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

For the elderly person who has\nbeen mistreated, the nursing home may\nreflect a safe haven from mistreatment.\nFortheself-neglectingelder,along-term\ncare facility might afford access to food,\nmedicines, or care that would otherwise\nbe inaccessible in the community. Alter-\nnatively, nursing home residents gener-\nallyareatahigherriskofdeaththantheir\ncommunity-dwelling counterparts, and\nnursing home placement might alter the\ncauseofdeathforapreviouslymistreated\nsubject. Accordingly, we assessed the\nproportion of deaths occurring in long-\nterm care facilities for all 3 groups (Table\n5). While those subjects experiencing\nself-neglect were more likely to die in a\nnursing home compared with uninvesti-\ngated subjects, those experiencing mis-\ntreatment were not.\nCOMMENT\nThis longitudinal study is the first to\nexamine mortality in a well-character-\nizedcohortofcommunity-dwellingolder\nadults, a subset of whom both have been\nreferred to protective services and have\nexperiencedeldermistreatment.There-\nsults demonstrated a mortality gradient\ninwhicholderadultswhohavebeenmis-\ntreated were more likely to be dead at\nthe end of a 13-year follow-up period\nthan either their self-neglected counter-\nparts or those cohort members who had\nno interaction with adult protective ser-\nvices. Survival was similar at the begin-\nning of the study, but midway through\nfollow-up, the survival curves diverged.\nNotably, the majority of mistreatment\neventshadoccurredinthecohortbythis\ntime, which may reflect a saturation ef-\nfect in the pool of persons susceptible.\nAdditionally, a multivariable analysis\nthat controlled for other factors known\nto be predictive of mortality in older\nadults revealed that both the need for\nprotective service use generally and el-\nder mistreatment specifically were in-\ndependent predictors of early death.\nNotably, no deaths in the mistreated\ngroup were immediately ascribed to in-\njury. How then might elder mistreat-\nment confer additional risk for mortal-\nity? One possibility is that we did not\nadequately adjust for the confounders\n(eg, comorbidity) or did not identify all\nconfounders that might be associated\nwith mortality, such as noncompliance\nwithmedicaltreatmentorpooraccessto\nmedical care. For example, malnutrition\nmight be associated with many of the\ncovariates in these models, but was only\nindirectly assessed through body mass\nindex. Comorbidity adjustment in this\nstudy was through self-report of 7 medi-\ncalconditions,whichislessaccuratethan\nmedical record\u00adbased abstraction. An-\nother possibility is that protective ser-\nvice use and elder mistreatment repre-\nsent comprehensive markers of frailty\nnotcapturedbytraditionalconstructsof\nthe older adult at risk. It may do this by\namalgamating, individually, high-risk\nfeaturesknowntobeassociatedwithad-\nverse outcomes such as poor functional\nstatus, cognitive impairment, and pov-\nTable 2.--All-Cause Mortality Associated With Verified Self-neglect and Verified Elder Mistreatment, by 3-Year\nInterval and Overall\nInvestigation Status\nTotal No.\nat Risk\nNo. (%)\nWho Died\nin Interval* 2 P Value\nTotal (pooled)\n*Percentages are weighted and adjusted for sampling design as are all statistical tests.\nCochran-Mantel-Haenszel 2, adjusted for interval.\nTable 3.--Hierarchical Pooled Logistic Regression for 3-Year All-Cause Mortality Risk Associated With Verified\nSelf-neglect and Verified Elder Mistreatment*\nModel Covariates\nSelf-neglect\nElder\nMistreatment\nIII Interval, demographics, health related (number of chronic\nconditions, body mass index entered as 2 variables)\nIV Interval, demographics, health related, function (number of\nADL impairments, number of Rosow-Breslau9 and Nagi10\nimpairments)\nV Interval, demographics, health related, function, social (number\nof social ties, martial status, number of sources of emotional\nsupport)\nVI Interval, demographics, health related, function, social, cognitive\n(Pfeiffer SPMSQ11 score)\nVII Interval, demographics, health related, function, social, cognitive,\npsychosocial (CES-Depression12 score)\n*All of the following were included as continuous variables in the models: age, years of education, activities of\ndaily living (ADL) impairments, higher functional impairments, number of chronic conditions, number of social ties,\nthe Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score, and CES-Depression score.

In the same manner that social in-\ntegration reduces mortality, it may con-\nversely be the case that the extreme in-\nterpersonal stress resulting from elder\nabuse situations may confer additional\ndeath risk. Future research that exam-\nines this hypothesis is greatly needed.\nNursing home placement is an inter-\nvention that is frequently implemented\nfor egregious adult protective services\ncases involving both mistreatment and/\nor self-neglect. This study had limited\nfollow-up of deaths occurring in long-\nterm care facilities, but in general, self-\nneglecting older adults were more likely\nto die in long-term care facilities than\neither mistreated subjects or those who\nhadnocontactwithadultprotectiveser-\nvices. Unfortunately, the numbers in\nthis study were small, and we believe\nthat defining the outcomes of long-term\ncare placement for adult protective ser-\nvice clients of all types is a crucial area of\nstudy,sincenursinghomeplacementisa\nradical, restrictive, and expensive inter-\nvention.Itisalsooneofthemostdifficult\ndecisions that adult protective services\nworkers and elder abuse field workers\nface in their jobs. More objective data on\nwhenitisappropriateandefficaciousare\ngreatly needed.\nAnother limitation of this study is that\nitexaminesthesurvivalofindividualssus-\ntaining reported elder mistreatment and\ntherearelikelymistreatmentcasesamong\nthe nonprotective services group.

This study argues that\nit may. Additionally, we have no way of\nadjustingforlengthofabusebecausepro-\ntective service referral does not indicate\nwhen mistreatment began, only when it\nbecame known to an official agency.\nIn summary, reported elder mistreat-\nment confers additional death risk.\nWhether multidisciplinary interven-\ntionsdirectedatstoppingeldermistreat-\nment would avert the associated in-\ncreased mortality is an area worthy of\nfurther investigation.\nThis study was supported by the National Insti-\nand the EPESE.
