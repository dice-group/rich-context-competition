Sampson, BA; Mark Olfson, MD, MPH;\nHarold A. Pincus, MD; Kenneth B. Wells, MD, MPH; Ronald C. Kessler, PhD\nContext: Epidemiologic surveys have consistently found\nthat approximately half of respondents who obtained treat-\nment for mental or substance use disorders in the year\nbefore interview did not meet the criteria for any of the\ndisorders assessed in the survey. Concerns have been\nraised that this pattern might represent evidence of mis-\nallocation of treatment resources.\nObjective: To examine patterns and correlates of 12-\nmonth treatment of mental health or substance use\nproblems among people who do not have a 12-month\nDSM-IV disorder.\nDesign and Setting: Data are from the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representa-\ntive face-to-face US household survey performed be-\nDSM-IV disorders using a fully structured diagnostic in-\nterview, the World Health Organization Composite In-\nternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).\nParticipants: A total of 5692 English-speaking respon-\ndents 18 years and older.\nMain Outcome Measures: Patterns of 12-month ser-\nvice use among respondents without any 12-month\nDSM-IV CIDI disorders.\nResults:Ofrespondentswhoused12-monthservices,61.2%\nhad a 12-month DSM-IV CIDI diagnosis, 21.1% had a life-\ntimebutnota12-monthdiagnosis,and9.7%hadsomeother\nindicatorofpossibleneedfortreatment(subthreshold12-\nmonthdisorder,serious12-monthstressor,orlifetimehos-\npitalization).Theremaining8.0%ofserviceusersaccounted\nfor only 5.6% of all services and even lower proportions of\npared with higher proportions of human services (18.9%)\nand complementary and alternative medicine (7.6%) vis-\nsumably low-need patients were delivered in the mental\nhealth specialty or general medical sectors.\nConclusions: Most services provided for emotional or\nsubstance use problems in the United States go to people\nwith a 12-month diagnosis or other indicators of need.\nPatients who lack these indicators of need receive care\nlargely outside the formal health care system.\ntute of Medicine1 de-\nscribed a gap in the qual-\nity of mental health care as\ngreat as or greater than that\nseen in the rest of the health care system.\nThe report described a primary goal for\nquality improvement of reducing under-\nuse and overuse of services.

Persons\nwithout diagnosed disorders make up most treated cases\ninmentalhealthneedsassessmentsurveysthroughoutthe\ndevelopedanddevelopingworlds.16-18 Thisconsistentfind-\ning has been interpreted as evidence of potential overuse,\nand recommendations have been made based on this con-\nclusion to redistribute services from persons without di-\nagnoses to those with more serious conditions.18\nIf overuse of services implies use of services in the ab-\nsence of need, then evaluating this problem empirically\nrequires carefully considering what we mean by the term\nneed and what we include in the enumeration of mental\nhealth services. Clinical need is a complex concept, best\nconceptualized not as a single entity but as a series of over-\nlapping constructs, including symptoms, disease bur-\nden, treatment effectiveness, and consumer percep-\ntions.19-22 In assessing potential need it is critical to\ncomplement diagnosis with other measures of symp-\ntoms and psychosocial burden and with patients' expla-\nnations of why they sought care.\nIn exploring the implications of use of services in the\nabsence of diagnosis, it is also critical to understand where\npeople are receiving their treatment. The types of men-\ntal health care that people obtain are heterogeneous, rang-\ning from services delivered in specialty mental health set-\ntings, to those provided by general health professionals,\nto those obtained from nonprofessionals, such as clergy\nand self-help group facilitators.23 Whereas treatment in\nthe formal health care system (either medical or mental\nhealth) contributes to rising health care costs, treat-\nment delivered outside of those sectors has fewer impli-\ncations for allocation of resources.\nThis study examines the prevalence and characteris-\ntics of use of 12-month mental health services in people\nwithout 12-month mental disorders based on the most\ncomprehensive survey ever conducted of the prevalence\nand correlates of mental disorders in the United States. Ex-\ntending research from previous epidemiologic surveys, we\nseek to understand the extent to which patients who do\nnot meet the 12-month criteria for any of the disorders as-\nsessed in the survey have other indicators of possible need.\nWe examine the sectors where treatment is received, the\nnumber of visits made to each treatment sector, and pa-\ntient self-reported reasons for seeking treatment.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative face-to-face house-\nhold survey of respondents 18 years and older in the cotermi-\nnous United States conducted between February 5, 2001, and\nadministered to all respondents. Part 2 assessed risk factors,\ncorrelates, service use, and additional disorders and was ad-\nministered to all part 1 respondents with lifetime disorders plus\na probability subsample of other respondents. The overall re-\nsponse rate was 70.9%. The part 2 sample, which is the focus\nof this study, included all part 1 respondents with a disorder\nand a probability subsample of other part 1 respondents, for a\ntotal of 5692 part 2 respondents. Part 2 data were weighted to\nadjust for differential probability of selection in households,\ndifferential nonresponse, differential selection of part 1 respon-\ndents into part 2, and residual discrepancies with US Census\npopulation data. Recruitment and consent procedures were ap-\nproved by the human subjects committees of Harvard Medical\nSchool and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor).\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment of 12-Month\nMental Disorders\nThe DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the World Health Or-\nganization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)\nversion 3.0,26 a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic in-\nterview. The DSM-IV27 criteria were used to generate diag-\nnoses. The 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders considered herein\ninclude mood disorders (bipolar I and II disorders, subthresh-\nold bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and dysthy-\nmia), anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without\npanic, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety dis-\norder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder, and adult separation anxiety disorder), impulse control\ndisorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, opposi-\ntional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and\npathological gambling disorder), substance use disorders (al-\ncohol and drug abuse with or without dependence), and non-\naffective psychosis. All diagnoses were made using organic ex-\nclusions and diagnostic hierarchy rules, except for the substance\nuse disorders, in which abuse was defined with or without de-\npendence. Masked clinical reappraisal interviews using the Struc-\ntured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)25,28 showed gen-\nerally good concordance between diagnoses based on the CIDI\nand the SCID for anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders\nbut CIDI underestimation of the prevalence of nonaffective psy-\nchosis.29 The CIDI lifetime diagnoses of impulse control dis-\norders were not validated.\nOther Indicators of Possible Need for Treatment\nRespondents who did not meet the 12-month criteria for any\nof the previously mentioned DSM-IV disorders were divided\ninto subsamples based on a 3-category gradient of possible need\nfor treatment: (1) those with at least 1 lifetime DSM-IV/CIDI\ndisorder; (2) those with 1 or more indicators of severity; that\nis, 12-month subthreshold disorders (ie, lacking only 1 crite-\nrion for a diagnosis), exposure to a major stressful event (eg,\nrape or divorce) in the past 12 months, and lifetime hospital-\nization for a mental disorder; and (3) those without any life-\ntime diagnosis or other indicator of possible need.\n12-Month Use of Mental Health Services\nAll part 2 respondents were asked whether they had ever re-\nceived treatment for \"problems with your emotions or nerves or\nyour use of alcohol or drugs.\" A list of types of treatment profes-\nsionals and a separate list of settings were presented in a respon-\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Separate assessments\nwere made for different types of professionals, support groups,\nself-help groups, mental health crisis hotlines, and complemen-\ntary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Follow-up\nquestions were asked about ages at the first and most recent\ncontacts and about number of visits in the past 12 months.\nReports of 12-month service use were classified into the fol-\nlowing predefined categories: psychiatrist, nonpsychiatrist men-\ntal health specialist (psychologist or other nonpsychiatrist men-\ntal health professional in any setting, social worker or counselor\nin a mental health specialty setting, and use of a mental health\nhotline),generalmedicalprovider(primarycaredoctor,othergen-\neral medical doctor, nurse, and any other health professional not\npreviously mentioned), human services professional (religious or\nspiritualadvisorandsocialworkerorcounselorinanysettingother\nthan a specialty mental health setting), and CAM (any other type\nof healer, such as a chiropractor, participation in an Internet sup-\nport group, or participation in a self-help group).\nBasic patterns of service use were examined by computing\nproportions in treatment and mean numbers of visits among\nthose in treatment. Logistic regression30 analysis was used to\nstudy predictors of 12-month treatment and treatment in par-\nticular sectors among those receiving any treatment. Standard\nerrors were estimated using the Taylor series method31 and\nimplemented using a software system (SUDAAN version\n8.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNorth Carolina). Logits and their 95% confidence intervals\nwere transformed into odds ratios (ORs) for ease of interpre-\ntation. Multivariate significance tests in the logistic regression\nanalyses were made using Wald 2 tests based on coefficient\nvariance-covariance matrices that were adjusted for design ef-\nfects using the Taylor series method. Statistical significance\nwas evaluated using 2-sided design-based tests and the P.05\nlevel of significance.\nRESULTS\nAs reported previously,4 17.9% of NCS-R respondents ob-\ntained some type of treatment for problems with their\nmental health or substance use in the 12 months before\ninterview. There was a strong monotonic relationship be-\ntween the gradient of possible need and the probability\nof treatment, with 39.9% of respondents with 12-month\nDSM-IV/CIDI disorders obtaining treatment compared\nwith 18.3% of those with lifetime but not 12-month dis-\norders, 12.7% of those without any lifetime disorder but\nwith another indicator of possible need, and 3.8% of those\nwithout any indicator of possible need (Table 1). Mean\nnumber of visits among patients was significantly re-\nlated to the gradient as well, with the highest mean (16.5\nvisits) among patients with 12-month disorders and the\nlowest means among patients without lifetime disor-\nders either in the presence (8.4 visits) or absence (10.3\nvisits) of other indicators of possible need. Of all pa-\ntients who obtained treatment, 61.2% met the criteria for\n1 or more of the 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders as-\nsessed in the survey. These 12-month cases accounted\nhad a lifetime disorder (19.9% of all visits), and the re-\nthe criteria for any lifetime or 12-month disorder.\nPatients with 12-month disorders accounted for higher\nproportions of visits to psychiatrists (73.5%), other men-\ntal health professionals (74.3%), and general medical pro-\nCAM (60.7%) professionals (detailed results available on\nrequest). Patients with lifetime but not 12-month disor-\nders accounted for a higher proportion of visits to CAM\nprofessionals (27.7%) than to other treatment sectors\nsessed in the survey and without any other indicator of\npossible need, in comparison, accounted for a higher pro-\nportion of visits to the human services sector (18.9%) than\nThese differences resulted in variation in treatment pro-\nfiles across sectors among patients in each subsample of\nthe gradient of possible need (Table 2).

This\nmeans that nearly two-thirds of all visits (64.8%) by pa-\ntients with a 12-month disorder were made in the formal\nhealth care sector. These are all higher proportions than\namong patients with a lifetime but not a 12-month disor-\nder, for whom 45.5% of visits were delivered by a mental\nhealth professional and 6.5% by a general medical profes-\nsional (52.0% in a health care sector), and among patients\nwithout either a lifetime disorder or any of the indicators\nof potential need (26.5% in a health care sector).

However, the 3 most commonly reported rea-\nsons were the same across subsamples: to obtain help for\nemotions or behavior problems, to cope with stressful\nevents, and to cope with ongoing stress.\nCOMMENT\nThe results reported herein show that most people who\nuse services for mental health or substance use problems\nin the United States have either a DSM diagnosis or some\nother indicator of possible need for treatment. These find-\nings extend those of previous studies in showing that a\nsubstantial percentage of service users did not have any\nof the 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI diagnoses assessed in the\nsurvey4,13-15 despite the fact that a much wider range of con-\nditions was considered herein than in earlier studies. How-\never, when we focused on number of visits, we found that\nthe nearly two-thirds of mental health service users who\nhad a 12-month diagnosis accounted for approximately\nthree-quarters of all professional visits for mental health\nor substance use problems. These results may help re-\nduce concerns based on the findings of previous epide-\nmiologic surveys that a high proportion of services are pro-\nvided to patients who do not have a DSM disorder.\nWe also found that patients with lifetime but not 12-\nmonth diagnoses made up most other 12-month service\nusers in the NCS-R. In this subsample of respondents,\nthose with recent episodes were significantly more likely\nthan others to be undergoing 12-month treatment, sug-\ngesting that they may be receiving time-limited treat-\nment for recent episodes. Use of services among other\npatients with lifetime disorders may reflect the growing\nawareness that maintenance treatment is important for\nrelapse prevention in people with a history of serious con-\nditions.32-34 The fact that indicators of lifetime severity\n(number of diagnoses and lifetime history of hospital-\nization) were significant predictors of 12-month treat-\nment is consistent with this hypothesis. This pattern is\nconsistent with earlier NCS-R findings that allocation of\nservices is significantly associated with burden of ill-\nTo the extent that maintenance treatment is taking\nplace, asymptomatic patients with lifetime disorders in\n12-month treatment may be treatment success stories.\nThe comparatively high proportion of people with life-\ntime bipolar disorder in 12-month treatment despite not\nhaving a 12-month manic-hypomanic or depressive epi-\nsode is an especially important case in point given the\nliterature suggesting the value of maintenance therapy\nin this population.33,35 The fact that asymptomatic people\nwith lifetime diagnoses had fewer visits than those with\nmore symptoms or risk factors further suggests an un-\nderlying rationality in resource allocation among stable\npatients receiving maintenance treatment.\nThe finding that a meaningful proportion of services\nis provided to patients who do not meet either 12-month\nor lifetime criteria for any of the DSM-IV disorders as-\nsessed in the NCS-R raises a more complex set of clinical\nand policy concerns. More than three-fourths of these pa-\ntients had a subthreshold 12-month condition, reported\nTable 6.

Subthreshold syndromes are currently less well\ndefined than threshold diagnoses, and relatively little is\nknown about the risks and benefits of treating these con-\nditions.36,37 Nonetheless, particularly in the presence of se-\nrious psychosocial stressors, arguments have been made\nthat treatment of subthreshold syndromes can have value\nnot only in reducing present distress and suffering but in\npreventingthefutureonsetofsyndromaldisorders.38-40 The\nfact that in this subsample a dose-response relationship\nexists between number of indicators of potential need and\nserviceusesuggeststhattreatmentdecisionsarebeingmade\nbased on these types of considerations. More generally, our\nfindings support the notion that need for care may be more\nappropriately thought of as a continuum than as a cat-\negorical construct.\nOnly a small proportion (8.0%) of service users did not\nhave any of the indicators of need considered herein. For\na wide range of medical interventions, it is commonly nec-\nessary to have some false-positive rate of treatment. For\nexample, a review of the appendectomy literature found\nan inverse relationship between the perforation rate and\nthe surgeon's false-positive rate, leading the authors to rec-\nommend that a 23% error rate (removal of a normal ap-\npendix)wouldbeappropriate.41 Formentaldisorders,pub-\nlic health efforts such as social marketing and antistigma\ncampaigns may simultaneously increase the rate of care\nin persons with and without disorders.42 Thus, some level\nof overtreatment may be an acceptable, and even desir-\nable, consequence of efforts to reduce the problem of un-\ndertreatment of mental disorders.\nAlthough service users without potential indicators of\nneed reported similar reasons for using services as other\nmentalhealthserviceusers,theyweremuchlesslikelythan\nother patients to receive their care in the formal health care\nsystem and much more likely to be treated in the human\nservices sector. This means that these presumably low-\nneed patients are not contributing importantly to formal\nmental health expenditures, nor do they divert a substan-\ntial proportion of professional resources away from pa-\ntients with diagnosable disorders. They account for only\n1.9% to 2.4% of all visits to psychiatrists and other men-\ntal health professionals and 3.7% of all visits to general\nmedical professionals for mental health or substance use\nproblems.Notethat44.8%ofthesepatientswhousedCAM\nservices reported that prayer was the main service pro-\nvided. This finding is consistent with previous research\ndemonstrating the common use of prayer43 and clergy vis-\nits44 in the United States for problems in daily life.\nThese results should be interpreted with the follow-\ning 2 limitations in mind. First, the CIDI does not pro-\nvide a fully comprehensive assessment of all DSM-IV dis-\norders, nor is it completely accurate in the diagnoses it\nassesses, as it is somewhat conservative relative to the\nSCID. As a result, some of the respondents classified as\nnot having had a 12-month disorder actually had one.\nSecond, the study relied on self-reported measures of ser-\nvice use. Because reporting bias for mental health ser-\nvices seems to be greatest in persons with high levels of\ndistress,45 such bias may be less of a concern for the popu-\nlation of primary interest in the present study (ie, pa-\ntients with low evidence of need for treatment).\nAlthough the study's findings should provide some re-\nassurance regarding the magnitude of overtreatment of\nmental health and substance use problems in the United\nStates, there is still much work to be done to ensure that\nmental health resources are used effectively and effi-\nciently.45 Overuse can be a problem not only for persons\nwithout need who receive services but also for individu-\nals with evidence of need who receive poor-quality ser-\nvices. From an economic perspective, poor quality of care\nrepresents wasted resources.46,47 The present study sug-\ngests that efforts to reduce waste need to shift from\nwhether the wrong persons are receiving mental health\ncare to ensuring that those who do receive care receive\nthe right services, in the right manner, and at the right\ntime.\nSubmitted for Publication: January 9, 2007; final revi-\nCorrespondence: Benjamin G.
