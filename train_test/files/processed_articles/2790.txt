However, despite methodological limitations of prior research, public policies and\nclinical practice have been based on this assumption.\nOBJECTIVE To empirically examine the commonly held belief that sexually abused children\ngrow up to become sexual offenders and specialize in sex crimes.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study and archival records\ncheck included cases and control individuals originally from a metropolitan county in the\nMidwest. Children with substantiated cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (aged\n0-11 years) were matched with children without such histories on the basis of age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, and approximate family social class (908 cases and 667 control individuals).\nBoth groups were followed up into adulthood (mean age, 51 years).

The\nresults did not provide support for sex crime specialization.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The widespread belief that sexually abused children are\nuniquely at risk to become sex offenders was not supported by prospective empirical\nevidence. These new findings suggest that early intervention programs should target children\nwith histories of physical abuse and neglect.

An earlier report from the US Government Ac-\ncountabilityOffice22 concludedthatresearchfindingsonthere-\nlationship between childhood sexual abuse and later sexual\noffending were inconsistent and inconclusive.

There was a nonsignificant trend for\nphysically abused males (P = .06), but not for sexually abused\nmales (P = .37). For females, there were no significant differ-\nences.\nChildhood Sexual Abuse and Specialization in Sex Crimes\nOf those in the sample with arrests for sex crimes, few (6.67%)\nhad records that included only sex offenses. Only 10 (9.52%)\nof the sex offenders met the criteria for specialization, and 3\nof these were control individuals.\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined a number of commonly held be-\nliefs about the consequences of childhood sexual abuse and,\nspecifically, the likelihood that these child victims will grow\nup to become sexual offenders and specialize in sex offend-\ning. Using a prospective design, we found that individuals with\nhistories of childhood abuse and neglect were at increased risk\nfor being arrested for a sex crime compared with individuals\nwithout such histories, and this effect was primarily in those\nwith histories of childhood physical abuse and neglect and for\nmales. This pattern of offending is consistent with earlier find-\nings that childhood survivors of physical abuse and neglect\nwere at increased risk for being arrested for a violent crime and\nreinforces the notion that sex crimes are also violent crimes.\nContrary to what is commonly believed, individuals\nwith a history of childhood sexual abuse were not at unique\nrisk to be arrested for a sex crime compared with physically\nabused or neglected individuals or matched control indi-\nviduals. Because of the relatively small number of sexually\nabused youth in this sample, these results need to be inter-\npreted with caution. The lack of significant findings for\nsexual abuse survivors may be the result of inadequate sta-\ntistical power. However, power is determined by sample and\neffect sizes. Many studies with small samples report signifi-\ncant findings because the effect is substantial. In 2 previous\nstudies from this sample of abused and neglected children,\nindividuals with childhood sexual abuse histories were at\nsignificantly increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases\nin adulthood37 and having same-sex sexual partners,38 sug-\ngesting that substantial effects can be detected even with\nthis relatively small subset of individuals with histories of\nchildhood sexual abuse.\nIn terms of age at onset of sexual offending, we did not find\nthat those who had experienced childhood sexual abuse were\narrested for their first sexual offense at an earlier age than con-\ntrol individuals. In contrast, we found that maltreated chil-\ndren in general and those who had been neglected had a higher\nprobability of being arrested at any age. Lastly, our results\nshowedthatindividualswhowerearrestedforsexcrimeswere\nnot likely to specialize in sex offending, regardless of maltreat-\nment status. Most of these individuals had arrests for other\ntypes of offenses, suggesting that the sex offenses commit-\nted were part of a larger pattern of violent and antisocial be-\nhavior, particularly among individuals with histories of child-\nhood physical abuse and neglect.\nInterpreting the findings from this study should take into\naccount the study's limitations as well as strengths. One key\nadvantagewastheprospectivelongitudinalfollow-upthatper-\nmitted an estimation of future risk compared with retrospec-\ntive designs. Although the use of official records of child abuse\nand neglect is also an advantage because of the lack of ambi-\nguity about the maltreatment experience, this strategy means\nthat only cases of abuse and neglect that came to the atten-\ntionofauthoritieswereincluded.Thesampleisweightedheav-\nilytowardthelowerendofthesocioeconomicspectrum;there-\nfore, the results may not generalize to consequences of abuse\nand neglect for children in middle- and upper-income fami-\nlies. These findings are also not generalizable to abused and\nneglected children adopted in infancy or early childhood be-\ncause these cases were excluded. Furthermore, because the\nsample represents children who grew up in the late 1960s and\nearly 1970s, this may raise concerns about the relevance of\nthese cases to current cases. However, the cases studied here\nare quite similar to current cases being processed by the child\nFigure 2.

One difference is that these\nchildren were not provided with extensive services or treat-\nment options as available today and, thereby, the results of this\nstudy represent the natural history of the development of\nabused and neglected children.\nAnother possible concern is the extent to which these chil-\ndren moved out of state, making the rates reported here con-\nservatively biased. However, because National Crime Infor-\nmation Center records reflect arrests for crimes across the\nUnited States and all state registries were searched, this should\nmitigate against this problem. It also might be argued that of-\nficial report data underestimate actual sex offense rates be-\ncause sex offenses are underreported. Although this is a con-\ncern, as suggested by Carpentier et al,39 underreporting may\nhave less impact if data are collected across a long follow-up\nperiod (in this case, more than 30 years). If a person was en-\ngaging in sex offending, the probability that at least 1 event\nwould be detected increases with the more crimes commit-\nted. Relatedly, these individuals were involved in official child\nprotective service cases as children and often came from fami-\nlies with extensive involvement with child welfare and jus-\ntice systems, increasing their general risk for arrest owing to\nsurveillance bias.\nWe searched the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public\nWebsite for information about sex offenders and found a se-\nrious underestimation of the prevalence of sex offenses (a total\nof 9 individuals listed on all state registries). Given such a ma-\njor discrepancy between the public registry data and official\ncriminal history records, our findings support previous rec-\nommendations that researchers should consider the use of the\npublic registry data with caution.40\nConclusions\nThis study represents a long-term and comprehensive assess-\nment of the extent to which sexually abused children become\nsex offenders and compares them to physically abused and ne-\nglected and nonmaltreated children. These findings show that\nphysically abused and neglected children are at increased risk\nfor being arrested for sex crimes and should receive effective\ninterventions to avert these negative consequences. These re-\nsults do not provide support for the common belief that being\na survivor of childhood sexual abuse carries with it a unique\nincrease in the risk for becoming a sex offender, contrary to\nsome public policies and administrative practices of some ju-\nrisdictions where children may be stigmatized, placed in re-\nstrictive settings, or barred from schools.
