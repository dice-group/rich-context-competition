    "abstract": "Abstract: This DataWatch estimates the costs and monetary value of lost quality of life due to death\nand nonfatal physical and psychological injury resulting from violent crime. In 1987 physical injury\nto people age twelve and older resulting from rape, robbery, assault, murder, and arson caused about\n$10 billion in potential health-related costs, including some unmet mental health care needs. It led\nto $23 billion in lost productivity and almost $145 billion in reduced quality of life (in 1989 dollars).\nIfassociated deaths and cases resulting in psychological injury only are included, costs average $47,000\nare almost $2.4 million per murder. Lifetime costs for all intentional injuries totaled $178 billion\nIn a discussion of violence and its impact on society, one aspect to\nconsider is the cost of violent crime to victims. It is useful to quantify\ncosts in this way for several reasons. They are important both in\ncharacterizing the crime problem and in examining ways to address it. They\nallow analysts and advocates to combine statistics on disparate crimes into\na single, readily understood metric. They guide resource allocation.1 They\nprovide insight into such crucial policy issues as the likely costs of mental\nhealth care for crime victims if mental health care were to be universally\nreimbursed. They allow program planners and evaluators to estimate the cost\nsavings from a community policing program. And they yield insight into the\nrationality of early prisoner release programs.\nThis DataWatch provides estimates of the cost of violent crime to the\nvictims, based on data from several national data sets.\nData Sources, Methods, And Limitations\nIncidence.

In face-to-face interviews, victims re-\nport nonfatal victimization, physical injury, work losses, and selected costs.\nFamilial violence (child abuse, elder abuse, and spousal assault) and rape\nprobably are underreported in the NCS.2 The NCS excludes victimization\nof children under age twelve, military personnel, the institutionalized, and\nthe homeless. For this study we used average NCS incidence counts for\nyear.3 We computed unit costs of crime injury using the 1987 NCS.\nThe quality of the injury costs from the NCS victim self-reports is suspect\nfor several reasons. The survey asks victims to recall details of crimes that\noccurred up to six months earlier. Victims who suffered minor injuries at\nthe start of this time period may forget small costs, while those who suffered\nserious injury may be unaware of the cumulative costs. For example, hospi-\ntal bills may go directly to the insurer, so that the insured never learns of the\namount. Also, the NCS includes only costs through the interview date, on\naverage only three months after victimization.\nOur source for nonfatal and fatal injuries in arson fires was 1987 esti-\nmates from the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), which\ncompiles fire department reports. Both civilian and firefighter injuries are\nincluded. NFIRS relies on voluntary reporting, with about half of all fire\ndepartments participating. The U.S. Fire Administration applies an algo-\nrithm to generate national NFIRS estimates. Given the nonrandom sam-\nple, these weighted estimates clearly are imperfect.\nOur third source was the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uni-\nform Crime Reports (UCR), which counts other fatal injuries and largely\nallocates them among rape, robbery, and assault. Circumstances underlying\nmurders were known in two-thirds of the cases. We distributed the remain-\nder proportionally to cases with known circumstances.\nCost framework. The cost estimates presented here represent an initial\neffort to estimate recent costs of victimization, using mostly secondary data.\nThe findings represent a preliminary, rather than a definitive, study. The\ncost framework and methods build from earlier studies.4 Like those studies,\nthis DataWatch describes three categories of costs: ( 1 ) direct losses other\nthan property losses--including costs of medical, mental health, and emer-\ngency response services, as well as insurance administration; (2) productiv-\nity losses--wages, fringe benefits, and housework; and (3) nonmonetary\nlosses--pain, suffering, and lost quality of life. We excluded property losses\nand the costs society incurs to prevent future crime.\nThis DataWatch presents two sets of cost estimates. One set shows the\ncost per physically injured crime victim, with murder treated as a separate\ncategory. The second shows costs per victimization associated with com-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It also allocates murders to their\nunderlying cause: A rape-murder victim is considered a rape victim, some-\none murdered during a robbery is a robbery victim, and someone murdered\nduring a quarrel is an assault victim. Thus, this version shows the relative\nseriousness of different crimes (which is useful, for example, when debating\nappropriate penalties).\nMedical costs. Average medical costs per fatal injury came from\nDorothy Rice and colleagues; no differentiation by cause was possible.5 The\nNCS captures only short-term medical costs for rape, robbery, and assault.\nThus, to estimate long-term medical costs, we used the only national data\navailable on the temporal distribution of injury medical costs: the Detailed\nClaims Information (DCI) database of the National Council on Compen-\nsation Insurance (NCCI). This database longitudinally tracks the medical\ncare costs of 450,000 randomly sampled victims of disabling workplace\nthe unknown NCS injury distribution within each NCS injury category\nwas similar to the DCI injury distribution within each category.\nThe DCI excludes rape. To estimate long-term costs for rape, we applied\nthe percentage of medical costs beyond six months for the DCI category\nwith the highest percentage of costs within six months (92 percent). Rape,\nhowever, may have potentially costly long-term consequences. For exam-\nple, the NCS does not ask explicitly about pregnancy, abortion, venereal\ndiseases, or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency\ndisease syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Carole Jenny and colleagues reported that\n43 percent of a sample of 204 victims examined within seventy-two hours\nafter rape incidents showed evidence of sexually transmitted diseases.7\nAmong victims who showed no evidence of such diseases at the initial\nexamination and who were not treated to prevent them, the incidence of\nnew diseases ranged from 2 percent for chlamydia to 19 percent for bacterial\nvaginosis.\nThe distribution of injuries in arson fires came from unpublished NFIRS\ndata. We used DCI unit costs of burns and smoke inhalation; for other\ninjuries we assumed that average medical costs per arson-related injury are\nthe same as for comparable injuries (for example, a broken bone) to assault\nand robbery victims.\nSome incidents of victimization may aggravate preexisting conditions\nthat later cause significant health problems. For example, elderly victims\nmay be at increased risk of future heart attacks.8 Our estimates capture these\ncosts incompletely.\nMental health costs. Despite a growing awareness of post-traumatic\nstress disorder and the psychological impact of intentional injury on its\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Exhibit 1 estimates crime victims' mental health\ninjury rates. For example, an estimated 10 percent of rape victims suffer\nfrom severely disabling psychological injury, and 40 percent suffer from\nemotional distress severe enough to require mental health treatment be-\nyond initial counseling.\nTo derive these frequencies, we started with the literature-based esti-\nmates by Mark Cohen.10 More recent literature confirmed the order of\nmagnitude of Cohen's rape estimates but provided better estimates for other\ncrimes. Specifically, Dean Kilpatrick's survey of 391 Charleston, South\nCarolina, women estimated that psychological injury resulted from 57\npercent of completed rapes, 37 percent of aggravated assaults, and 18\npercent of completed robberies.11 The psychological injury rate for com-\npleted rape was 3.3 times the rate for attempted rape. We assumed that this\nratio applied to other crimes and that rates for men and women were\ncomparable. Weighting the Kilpatrick psychological injury rates for com-\npleted versus attempted crimes by NCS crime completion rates yields\noverall psychological injury rates. Following Cohen, we assumed that the\nratio of severe disorder to distress was one to four for rape. For other crimes,\nwe assumed a ratio of one to eight. Those ratios allowed us to compute\ninjury rates by severity from the total. These estimates exclude the cost of\ntreating post-traumatic stress disorder in family members, police, and other\nservice providers.\nNo data describe typical mental health care use by crime victims. Follow-\ning Cohen, we assumed that potential mental health costs per injury for the\npsychological injuries in Exhibit 1 equal average mental health care costs\nincurred by people who won jury verdicts for emotional distress ($4,160)\nand severely disabling psychological injury ($24,800). These costs are po-\ntential costs because they describe a population whose psychological inju-\nries were treated. An unknown portion of psychological injury victims go\nPercentage Of Crime Victims With Mental Health Care Needs\nRape\nRobbery\nAssault\nArson\nEmotional\ndistress\nSeverely disabling\nmental illness\nSource: Vanderbilt/Urban Institute Cost of Crime Study, 1993.\nNotes: Includes attempted and completed crimes.

Victim service organizations provide a range of serv-\nices, including counseling, shelter, and financial assistance. The United\nStates has more than 2,000 victim service programs. The U.S. Department\nof Justice Office of Victims of Crime supports 1,422 of these. These agen-\ncies receive more than $35 million in funding as a result of the Victims of\nCrime Act (VOCA). The ratio of VOCA to nonfederal funding is at least\nthree to one. Since VOCA funds no more than 70 percent of all victim\nservice agencies, the total expenditures on victim services probably ex-\nceeded $200 million in 1987. The bulk of these expenditures are used for\nprograms designed to deal with rape, domestic violence, and child abuse.\nSince we lack a breakdown by victim type, these costs were excluded from\nthe analysis.\nEmergency response costs. Emergency response costs are derived from\nreported crimes. We surveyed eight police departments about primary re-\nsponse and follow-up investigative times. Automated police data show time\nspent by type of crime but not whether the victim was physically injured.\nWe used averages by crime. Unit costs of police response were calculated as\nsalary plus fringe benefits and administrative overhead multiplied by the\naverage time spent on a case per category of crime.12 Although some police\ntime is overtime, we valued all time as regular time.\nThe NCS lacks data on emergency transport. We used the 1980 National\nMedical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) estimate of\naverage emergency transport costs for hospitalized nonfatal injuries of $144\nper one-way transport. We arbitrarily assumed that all persons who were\nadmitted as hospital inpatients had been transported by ambulance and\nthat persons who were not inpatients had not received such emergency\ntransport. Emergency transport and coroner costs for highway crash fatali-\nties were assumed to be comparable to homicide costs.13\nProductivity losses. Productivity costs per homicide average $610,000.\nThis average is the productivity loss per firearm-related fatality inflated to\n1987 dollars and adjusted to a 2.5 percent discount rate (in the range used\nby courts in compensating liability).14 It is based on the victim's age and sex\nonly. It was not adjusted for victims' income levels or other demographic\ncharacteristics. Adjusting probably would lower the value.\nFor victims of nonfatal injury, the NCS data described workdays lost\nduring the first few months after injury. Lost wages per day were assumed to\nequal average daily earnings in private nonagricultural industries. Lost\nhousework days were estimated at 1.5 times the number of lost workdays for\nthose who reported employment. We assumed that victims who were not\nstudents or workers lost the same number of housework days as workers lost.\nJohn Douglass and colleagues have provided average annual values of\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The value of lost schooldays was calculated as the\naverage workdays per worker, reduced by 25 percent due to the seasonality\nof the school year. Each lost schoolday was valued at $23.96, the average\nannual cost per pupil in average daily attendance divided by an assumed\naverage school year of 166 days.16 Arson-related productivity losses were\nestimated in the same manner as medical costs.\nTo compute long-term productivity loss, we first computed the primary\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) distribution for hospitalized\nvictims of rape, robbery, and assault, using California, Washington, and\nVermont hospital discharge tapes with mandatory cause coding. Similarly,\nwe computed the ICD distribution of nonhospitalized crime injuries from a\nconvenience sample of twenty-one emergency rooms (in nine communi-\nties) that were able to supply this information. For physical injuries associ-\nated with rape, robbery, and assault, we multiplied the number of cases by\nICD code and hospitalization status times the corresponding DCI prob-\nabilities of permanent total and partial disability to get probabilities by type\nof crime and hospitalization status.17 We combined the hospitalized and\nnonhospitalized probabilities using NCS hospitalization rates. For arson, we\napplied the disability probabilities to the NFIRS arson injury distribution.\nTo translate the permanent disabilities into productivity losses, we multi-\nplied them times $610,000 (average productivity costs per homicide) for\npermanent disabilities and 17 percent of this amount for partial disabili-\nProgram administration. The administrative costs of health and dis-\nability insurance were estimated by multiplying the appropriate costs times\nthe percentage reimbursed by each type of payer times type-specific insur-\nance loss-adjustment expense ratios.19 For example, life insurance adminis-\ntrative cost was estimated as a 9 percent administrative cost on average life\ninsurance coverage of $47,000 per U.S. adult.20 This cost factor was applied\nto adult victims only.\nLost quality of life. Nonmonetary costs of intentional injury include\npain, suffering, fear, and lost quality of life. These costs were estimated\nusing two techniques: jury compensation and willingness to pay.\nFollowing Cohen, we estimated the jury compensation for pain, suffer-\ning, and lost quality of life received by victims of physical injuries similar to\nthose reported in the NCS. We started from jury award data from Jury\nVerdict Research, which lists compensatory damage awards and medical\ncare and productivity losses. We estimated regression equations predicting\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For victims\nwithout physical or psychological injury, a fear component was estimated.\nThis component is based upon a few jury awards in Louisiana, where the\ncourts allow recovery for fear without injury. Estimating these costs using\njury verdict data implicitly assumes that victims receive required mental\nhealth care. Victims not receiving needed treatment would experience\nhigher psychological injury costs.\nWillingness-to-pay estimates--value-of-life estimates derived from the\namount people willingly pay for safety when, for example, buying a smoke\ndetector or an automobile with airbags--were made using values of fatal\nrisk reduction from a literature review and synthesis by Ted Miller.21 For\nnonfatal injuries, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost were estimated\nusing previously developed methods, then multiplied times a value per life\nyear derived from the value per life lost. To derive the quality-adjusted life\nyears, we started with physician ratings of typical functional capacity loss by\ninjury on six dimensions: cognitive, mobility, sensory, cosmetic, pain, and\nactivities of daily living (essentially, bending, lifting, and grasping). We\nadded a work-related disability dimension, based on the DCI disability\nprobabilities. The capacity losses were combined into a single quality-\nadjusted life year loss per injury using survey data on the relative value loss\nassociated with each dimension and level of functional loss.22\nWillingness-to-pay amounts generally equaled an estimated 70 to 80\npercent of jury compensation amounts. Quality-adjusted life year ratings\nwere not available for rape, knife wounds, gunshot wounds, and psychologi-\ncal injuries. Based on the ratio for other injuries, we assumed that willing-\nness to pay is 75 percent of jury compensation for these injuries. The\nexhibits show pain, suffering, and lost quality of life due to physical injury\ncomputed as willingness to pay minus the productivity losses.\nThese losses largely come from typical injury settings, not crime settings.\nTherefore, quality-of-life losses due to psychological injury were computed\nfrom the mental health care costs (as described above) and added. The costs\nof fear were applied only to cases without physical or psychological injury.\nResults\nIncidence.

This exhibit omits secondary vie-\ntims--family members and others whose quality of life is adversely affected\nby the crime. The victimization count includes repeat victimizations; the\nvictim and injury counts refer only to single victimizations and the most\nrecent incident for serial victimizations.\nExhibit 2 describes the number of victimizations, the number of victims,\nand the percentage of victimizations that were fatal. It also shows the\npercentage of survivors who sustained injuries and the percentage of the\ninjured who were hospitalized. Nearly one-third of crime survivors reported\nsome physical injury. Sixty-one percent of rape and attempted rape survi-\nvors reported physical injuries. Injuries were reported by 36 percent of\nrobbery or attempted robbery survivors and 29 percent of assault or at-\ntempted assault survivors. Approximately 3 percent of arson fires resulted in\ncivilian injury and 11 percent in firefighter injury. Of those reporting injury\ndue to rape, robbery, and assault, 5 percent were hospitalized.\nMore than 4 percent of injured victims sustained gunshot or stab wounds,\nand almost 7 percent had bones broken or teeth knocked out. The vast\nmajority (81 percent) of victims who reported injury, however, suffered\nnothing more serious than bruises, cuts, and scratches.\nCriminal victimization accounts for 3.3 percent of all injuries.23 Intent to\nharm makes these injuries atypically severe.

Lost quality of life generally is about three-fourths of\nthe total cost.\nExcluding psychological costs, the cost per crime-related physical injury\nvictim (across fatal and nonfatal injuries) averaged $31,300. By compari-\nson, the average noncrime injury (attempted suicide or unintentional in-\njury) cost $23,400.24 The difference is that intentional injuries are more\noften fatal than unintentional injuries, on average. Nonfatal injury costs\nExhibit 4 shows unit costs for all crimes. The costs include attempted\ncrimes (rape, robbery, and assault attempts that resulted in sufficient physi-\ncal or psychological injury to cause the victim to view them as criminal\nvictimization even though they were not completed) and crimes without\nphysical injury. They also allocate murder costs to the crimes, primarily\nassaults, that underlie the murders. From this perspective, rapes have the\ncosts dominate the rape costs.

Violent crime accounts for about 5 percent of injury\ntreatment costs.25 Including related spending for treatment, administrative\ncosts, emergency transport, and mental health treatment brings potential\nhealth-related spending due to violent crime against those ages twelve and\nover to about $10 billion. Associated productivity losses exceed $23 billion.\nAt $7.2 billion, the potential mental health care and related administra-\ntive costs of rape, robbery, assault, and arson dwarf the medical costs. One\nreason is that many victims suffer only psychological injury. However, even\namong those with physical injuries, psychological costs dominate the pic-\nture. Current spending needs to be measured against this potential cost. A\nkey question is how much spending would grow if mental health care were\nreimbursed more extensively, as it would be under President Clinton's\nhealth care reform proposal. Despite the dominance of mental health costs\nin crime-related injuries, typically only physical injury costs are included in\nestimates of violence and injury costs. Policymakers should take note of this\ndisparity as different health care reform plans are debated.\nThis work was supported by National Institute ofJustice Grant no. 90AJ-CX-0050 to The Urban\nInstitute; the Michigan State Police (under a subcontract from the University of Michigan\nTransportation Research Institute); the Deans Summer Research Fund, Owen Graduate School\nof Management, Vanderbilt University; and the National Research Council Panel on the Under-\nstanding and Control of Violent Behavior.
