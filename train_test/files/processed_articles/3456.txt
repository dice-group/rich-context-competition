Similarly, there is evidence that\npreferences for body odours might be linked to heterozygosity. Here, we tested whether\nblending individual body odours into composites would follow a similar pattern as observed in\nthe perception of faces. We collected axillary odour samples from 38 individuals, which were\nsubsequently assessed individually and as composites of two (N \u00bc 19) or four (N \u00bc 9) body odours\nregarding their pleasantness, attractiveness and intensity. We found no significant differences\nbetween mean ratings of individual odour samples or composites of two or four odour\nsamples. Our results indicate that, in contrast to faces, composite body odours are not rated\nas more attractive. Composite body odours retain similar hedonic perceptual qualities as individual\nodours, thus highlighting differences in visual and chemosensory perceptual mechanisms.\nCorresponding author:\nJitka Fialova\n\u00b4, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Vinic\nna\nEmail: jitka.fialova@natur.cuni.cz\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\n",

The\nphenomenon was first noted by Galton (1879) who used photographic superimposing\ntechniques to combine facial images. More recent studies have improved upon these\ntechniques, using computer graphics to generate composite facial images (Grammer &\nRhodes & Tremewan, 1996), and finding that composites are considered more attractive than\nalmost all constituent faces. Furthermore, there is generally a positive association between\nthe number of individual images constituting a composite image and its attractiveness and\naverageness ratings (Langlois & Roggman, 1990), although average faces may not be the\nmost attractive (Perrett, May, & Yoshikawa, 1994).\nThe attractiveness of average faces may result from two different mechanisms. First, it\nmight be a by-product of visual system processing by which average faces can be processed\nfaster because they resemble a mental representation of a prototypical face (Enquist & Arak,\n1994). Indeed, it appears that prototypes are processed faster and have a higher probability of\nrecognition (Posner & Keele, 1968; Smith, Shoben, & Rips, 1974), and visual processing is\nmore fluent as reflected in decreased activity in the posterior occipital cortex (Aizenstein\net al., 2000). In addition, there is a positive relationship between prototypicality and\npreference, consistent with the observation that an increase in processing fluency also\nincreases liking (Martindale & Moore, 1988; Whitfield & Slatter, 1979). An alternative\nexplanation proposes that facial averageness might be a marker of heterozygosity (i.e.,\ngenetic diversity at certain loci; Lie, Rhodes, & Simmons, 2008; Thornhill & Gangestad,\n1993). It has therefore been argued that attractiveness of average faces might be a\nperceptual adaptation to favour heterozygous individuals (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1993).\nHeterozygosity in some loci positively affects viability of the organism, as deleterious\nalleles are predominantly expressed in recessive fashion (i.e., only in homozygotes).\nFurther, benefits of mating with heterozygous individuals may include reduced risk of\ndisease transmission and potential for high-quality paternal care (Kirkpatrick & Ryan,\nFacial attractiveness and averageness is associated with heterozygosity in the genes of the\nmajor histocompatibility complex (MHC; Lie et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2005). The MHC\ncomplex appears to be involved in mate selection processes of various vertebrate species\nincluding humans (Kamiya, O'Dwyer, Westerdahl, Senior, & Nakagawa, 2014; Winternitz,\nAbbate, Huchard, Havli\u00b4c\n ek, & Garamszegi, 2017). MHC genes are extremely polymorphic\nand code for cell-surface peptides that are responsible for recognition of foreign antigens and\nthereby initiating an immune response. As the MHC is expressed codominantly,\nheterozygous individuals are able to present a broader spectrum of peptides and thus\nprovide resistance to a wider range of pathogens compared with MHC homozygotes\n(Havli\u00b4c\n ek & Roberts, 2009). Consistent with this, MHC heterozygotes have faces that\nappear more healthy (Roberts et al., 2005). There is also some evidence showing\npreferences for body odour of MHC heterozygotes: Male body odour attractiveness as\nrated by women was positively associated with MHC heterozygosity, but there was no similar\npattern when men rated female body odour samples (Thornhill et al., 2003).\nBased on this evidence, one may speculate whether composite body odours might\nperceptually mimic odours of heterozygote individuals, as has been observed in studies of\ncomposite faces. If so, one would predict that body odour composites--individual odours\nblended and presented together--would be rated more positively than the individual samples.\nA test of this prediction could have important consequences for the methodology of body\nodour studies. Numerous previous studies have presented composite odours to assessors to\ntest potential communicatory significance of body odours. They use composite odours in an\nattempt to achieve a representative odour sample associated with a particular characteristic\nor state of interest while reducing the importance of individual variability in odour profiles.\nThus, the rationale behind these studies is that composite body odours (usually created by\npooling odour samples from people with a given characteristic) will contain shared qualities\nbased on their group attributes, such as gender (Lu\nWiesmann, & Freiherr, 2016) and sexual orientation (Martins et al., 2005). Similarly,\ncomposite body odours have been used for testing various affective states such as\nhappiness and fear (Chen & Haviland-Jones, 2000), disgust (de Groot, Smeets, Kaldewaij,\nPause, Adolph, Prehn-Kristensen, & Ferstl, 2009; Pause, Lu\nstress (Dalton, Maute\n\u00b4 , Jae\nFerstl, & Pause, 2006; Radulescu & Mujica-Parodi, 2013). While the approach used in such\nstudies is potentially very useful, it is currently unknown whether creating such composites\nmight influence hedonic qualities.\nIn light of this, here we aimed to test the effects of composite odour creation on the\nperception of odour attractiveness, pleasantness and intensity. We created odour composites\ncomprising two and four individual odours and tested whether these composite body odours\nare rated more positively compared with the distinct odours from the same individuals.\nMethods\nRaters\n\u00b4 &\nHavli\u00b4c\n\u00b4 , Roberts, & Havli\u00b4c\n ek, 2016). The composite samples were assessed\nThe two sets of raters were independent--no rater assessed both individual and composites.\nThe raters were mostly Charles University students and were contacted via e-mail, posters or\nby oral invitation. Raters reported no respiratory or other diseases at the time of the study or\nany problems or medication that could influence their olfactory abilities. All women were\nusing hormonal contraception to avoid changes in olfactory perception during the menstrual\ncycle (Martinec Nova\n\u00b4 kova\n\u00b4 , Havli\u00b4c\n ek, & Roberts, 2014). Following the procedure used in\nprevious studies, we assumed no systematic fluctuation in olfactory ability over time due to\nhormonal contraceptive use, and thus scheduling of assessments was unrestricted (e.g.,\nFialova\n\u00b4 , Rubes ova\n\u00b4 , & Havli\u00b4c\n\u00b4 , Fialova\n\u00b4 ,\nRoberts, & Havli\u00b4c\ncompensation for their time.\nThe study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of\nHelsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the institutional\nFialova\n\u00b4 et al. 3\nreview board of Charles University, Faculty of Science. Written informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nOdour Stimuli\n26), mostly students at Charles University (Prague, Czech Republic), participated as odour\ndonors (sample size varies across men and women because the participants were originally\nrecruited for the purpose of two other studies). All donors were nonsmokers and reported no\ndermatological or other diseases at the time of the study. No men shaved their armpits, while\nall women shaved their armpits; axillary shaving was kept constant within sex as it might\naffect perceived quality of the axillary odour (Kohoutova\nhormonal contraception to avoid possible body odour quality fluctuations across the\nmenstrual cycle (Havli\u00b4c\n ek, Dvor a\n\u00b4 kova\n(approximately US$40), respectively, in compensation for their time and potential\ninconvenience caused by the prescribed diet and according to duration of the study and its\ndemands.\nThe odour donors were asked to avoid consuming smelly and spicy food, alcohol, smoking\nor using any cosmetics on the day before and during the sampling day (48 hr overall). They\nattached 100% cotton pads under each armpit using surgical tape and wore the pads for 12 h\novernight (see Havli\u00b4c\n ek, Lenochova\n\u00b4 , Oberzaucher, Grammer, & Roberts, 2011). To avoid\nodour contamination from extrinsic ambient odours, the donors were asked to wear as the\nfirst layer of clothing a new white 100% cotton T-shirt that had been previously washed\nwithout washing powder. In the morning, they placed the pads in ziplock plastic bags and\nreturned them to the experimenters. The samples were immediately placed in a freezer at\n\u00c021C to prevent further microbial action and possible changes in odour quality. Freezing\nhas been shown to have no significant effect on hedonic ratings (Lenochova, Roberts, &\nHavlicek, 2008). Time elapsed between removing the pads and onset of freezing was\napproximately 1 to 2 hr. Each donor's conformity with the instructions was checked by a\nquestionnaire, and no violations on the day of sampling were recorded.\nTo create composite body odours, we first ranked the individual samples of either sex based\non their attractiveness ratings. Male and female composite odours were then created by\nblending two or four individual samples. We used previously unused pads that had been\ncollected at the same time from each individual; to do this, we used the pads collected from\nthe other armpit than the one that had been used for previous ratings of the individual samples.\nEach pad was cut into half and pooled with halved pads from other same-sex individuals who\nlay adjacent along the attractiveness continuum. In this way, we obtained 19 composites\ncomprised of 2 individual samples and 9 composites comprised of 4 individual samples.\nOdour Rating Procedure\nRatings took place in a quiet, ventilated room. The samples from one randomly chosen\narmpit of each odour donor were assessed individually, by the first set of raters. The\nsecond set of raters assessed the composites, originating from the other armpit and pooled\nas described earlier. Both kinds of samples were presented in 250 ml opaque jars labelled with\na code. Participants were asked to sniff each jar; ratings were recorded immediately after\nsniffing each stimulus, but the time spent sniffing was not restricted. To avoid adaptation, the\nsamples were randomly split into subsets, and raters were given approximately 10 min break\nbetween assessing each set. All samples were thawed before the rating session and then\nassessed in a randomized order regarding their (a) pleasantness, (b) attractiveness and (c)\nintensity, each on a 7-point scale. Both ends of each scale were verbally anchored by\ndescriptors (e.g., very unpleasant and very pleasant). If raters found any of the samples too\nweak to assess, they could select an option ``I cannot smell the sample'' instead of rating using\nthe scales (this occurred for 4.9% of the individual samples, 3.4% of the two-composite body\nodour samples, and 4% of the four-composite body odour samples). Such instances were not\nincluded in analyses, and hence the sample sizes of analyses can vary.\nStatistical Analysis\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov tests showed normal data distribution for all dependent variables. We\ncomputed mean values from the ratings of the individual samples that were used for creating\ncomposite body odour samples and compared them with actual ratings of composite body\nodour samples using paired t tests (e.g., for the two-odour composites, the ratings of 19\ncomposites were compared with 19 average scores from their constituent individual odour\npairs). To investigate sex differences in ratings of composite body odour samples, we used a\ntwo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with odour type and sex as a factor (two levels: two-\nand four-composite body odours and two levels: male, female, respectively). To explore\nwhether composite body odour samples retain qualities of the individual odours, we first\nranked the individual samples of either sex based on their attractiveness ratings and then\nsplit two- and four-composite body odours by the median value of the constituent samples.\nSubsequently, we compared the above median and below median samples by an independent\nsamples t test. In what follows, mean values calculated from ratings of the individual samples\nand actual ratings of the composite body odour samples are referred to as calculated samples\nand rated samples, respectively. We also tested for possible relationships between individual\nsamples and composite body odour samples using bivariate correlations.\nResults\nRatings of the Individual Versus Composite Body Odours\nWe found no significant differences between mean ratings of the individual samples and\ncomposite body odour samples (Figure 1; all ps > .16; for detailed results, see Tables 1\nand 2). These means were calculated from the full sample of raters (i.e., both male and\nfemale raters). Subsequently, we performed a two-way ANOVA for ratings of only\nopposite-sex odour samples. This also did not reveal any significant differences in women's\nratings of individual, two- and four-composite male odour samples, neither for pleasantness,\nindividual, two- and four-composite female odour samples, for pleasantness, F(2, 30) \u00bc 0.605,\nTo test whether composite body odours retain properties of the individual samples, we\nsplit two- and four-composite body odours by the median value of the constituent samples.\nWe found that two-composite body odours consisting of above median samples were\ndifferences were not significant in four-composite body odours either in pleasantness,\np \u00bc .712; see Figure 2(a) and (b).

Dashed lines indicate 95% CI.\nFialova\n\u00b4 et al. 9\nThe rationale was that composite body odours might be more positively perceived because\nthey would be more ``average,'' as analogously observed in facial attractiveness studies, and\nperhaps because they perceptually mimic the odour of relatively heterozygous individuals.\nContrary to expectation, we did not find significant differences between ratings of the\nindividual samples and both two- or four-composite body odours, and the same pattern\nwas observed for ratings of opposite-sex samples. Similarly, we did not find any positive\nassociation between the number of individual body odours constituting composite odours\nand its attractiveness ratings, as has been observed in facial images. However, we did find\nsignificant positive correlations between ratings of two- and four-composite body odours and\ncalculated values of individual odours.\nMoreover, our results suggest that two-composite body odour samples retain qualities of\nthe constituent individual odours as we found significant differences between the lower and\nupper halves of the distribution. The differences were not significant for four-composite body\nodour samples, perhaps as a consequence of limited sample size, but visual inspection of the\ndata (see Figure 3) indicates that four-composite body odour samples do appear to retain the\nqualities of the individual constituent samples.\nAs described earlier, our research was inspired by studies on facial attractiveness. These\nstudies systematically show that composite facial images are perceived as more attractive than\nthe constituent images (Langlois & Roggman, 1990). This was also observed to be\nindependent of their higher bilateral symmetry (Rhodes et al., 1999), another factor\nTable 4.

The attractiveness of\ncomposite images thus appears to be due to their higher prototypicality (Rhodes &\nTremewan, 1996); that is, they represent an average facial morphology and may thus\nmimic heterozygosity in individual faces. These processes are, however, far from how the\nolfactory system perceives chemical mixtures. Several previous studies have shown that odour\nmixtures might be perceived quite differently from their constituents (e.g., Thomas-Danguin\net al., 2014). Some scholars thus refer to odour mixtures as having emergent perceptual\nqualities that are frequently difficult to predict from the qualities of the constituents.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that humans, including professional ``noses,'' perform\nrather poorly in identifying individual chemicals from odour mixtures (Jinks & Laing, 1999).\nAnother possible mechanism is that higher attractiveness of facial composites, due to their\nprototypicality, is frequently perceived as more familiar. Unfortunately, we did not collect\nthese ratings. Thus, whether composite body odours are perceived as more familiar remains\nan open question.\nLimitations\nIn our study, we employed as body odour donors and raters women using hormonal\ncontraception to avoid possible fluctuations in body odour attractiveness (Havli\u00b4c\n ek,\nDvor a\n\u00b4 kova\n(Martinec Nova\n\u00b4 kova\n\u00b4 et al., 2014) during regular menstrual cycling. A previous study has\nrevealed shifts in MHC-related body odour in contraceptives users (Roberts, Gosling, Carter,\n& Petrie, 2008), and one may thus argue that our null findings might be thus attributable to\nthe fact that we employed contraceptive users. However, a recent meta-analysis did not show\nsignificant differences related to preferences for MHC dissimilarity between contraceptive\nusers and nonusers (Winternitz et al., 2017). In any case, the main advantage in employing\nhormonal contraceptive users as body odour donors was that we aimed to limit the known\neffect of cyclic fluctuations, which could drastically interfere with the process of creating\nblends across individual donors of different cycle phases. We suggest that this step should\nonly increase, and not interfere with, the chance to observe a positive effect of composite\nbody odours because it reduces noise in the collected samples. It is also worth noting that\nstudies of facial composite images, which find robust effects, did not similarly control for\neffects of hormonal contraception in women either contributing facial photographs or ratings\nus to suggest a likely sensory specificity in how composites of odours and faces are perceived.\nAnother potential limitation is that, when assessing individual odours and two-composite\nbody odour samples, raters were presented with either one complete cotton pad or two\nhalves, but four-composite samples were created using four halved pads. The difference in\nthe amount of presented material may potentially affect perception of body odour intensity.\nHowever, this does not seem to be the case, as we did not find any significant differences\nbetween pleasantness, attractiveness and intensity ratings of the individual samples and two-\nand four-odour composites.\nImplications for Future Studies\nSeveral previous studies have employed composite body odours from individuals sharing\ncharacteristics of interest, for example, their sexual orientation (Martins et al., 2005) or\naffective state (Pause et al., 2004), with the unstated assumption that shared features of the\nindividual odours would be perceivable in the composite stimuli. Our results indicate that\nFialova\nindividual hedonic qualities, at least, are retained in the odour composites, although further\nstudy is needed to investigate the retention of other trait-specific cues. We created\ncomposites from individual odours similar in their attractiveness, as this was the most\nefficient way to test the effect in question. However, it remains an open question as to\nwhether composites made of individual odours that are more variable in hedonic quality\nwould be perceived simply as an average of the constituents or whether such mixtures\nwould show some different, emergent quality. Previous studies investigating interactions\nbetween individual body odour and perfume have shown that qualities of the resulting\nblends cannot be reliably predicted (Sobotkova\n\u00b4 et al., 2017). In a related study, one of the\ncomponents was kept constant (i.e., the odour donors applied the same perfume),\nnevertheless the variability in hedonic quality of the blends was comparable with that\nseen in the body odours alone (Lenochova\n\u00b4 et al., 2012). Whether patterns observed in\nstudies on perfume-body odour blends can be generalized to the blends of individual\nbody odours should be addressed in future studies.\nRemarkably, it has been repeatedly shown that even though perceived qualities of body\nodour samples tend not to differ during hedonic assessment (e.g., pleasantness), they do\ninduce other effects on individuals exposed to these stimuli, for example, in their\nautonomic response (Adolph, Schlo\n\u00a8 sser, Hawighorst, & Pause, 2010), anxiety levels\n(Albrecht et al., 2011) or cognitive functioning (Chen, Katdare, & Lucas, 2006; Gelstein\net al., 2011). This evidence suggests that lack of consciously perceived differences does not\nexclude the possibility of odours transferring other socially relevant cues.\nFinally, our findings cannot be interpreted as evidence against a link between\nheterozygosity and attractiveness. Previous studies indicate that individual body odour\nsamples provide cues to heterozygosity (Thornhill et al., 2003), and this might be\nspecifically linked to heterozygosity in MHC genes that is important in MHC-based mate\nchoice providing direct fitness benefits (Havli\u00b4c\nNevertheless, our results demonstrate that the validity of composite body odour samples to\ntest hypotheses about heterozygosity might be limited. It also provides a caution for scholars\nprimarily interested in testing evolutionary hypotheses that the proximate mechanisms that\nunderlie interpreted functional outcomes must be treated with extreme care.\n"
