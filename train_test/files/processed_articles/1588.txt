Most neurologists\nwere comfortable diagnosing CJD (83%), but few patholo-\ngists felt comfortable diagnosing CJD (35%) or performing\nautopsy (29%). Addressing obstacles to autopsy is neces-\nsary to improve CJD surveillance.\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are\nrare, progressively fatal, neurodegenerative illnesses.\nHuman TSEs include classic   disease\n(CJD) and the recently described variant CJD associated\nwith eating bovine spongiform encephalopathy\u00adinfected\ncattle products in Europe (1). The recent identification of\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United States\nunderscores the importance of maintaining enhanced sur-\nveillance to monitor for the possible occurrence of variant\nCJD in this country (2,3).\nIn  , CJD is not reportable. Since 1999, the\n  CJD Surveillance Project of the  \nEmerging Infections Program, a collaboration of the\n  Department of Health Services and the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, has conduct-\ned enhanced surveillance for classic and variant CJD.\nMethods include review of state mortality data and follow-\nup investigation of CJD-related deaths that occur in per-\nsons <55 years of age, since >98% of cases of variant CJD\nin the United Kingdom have occurred in this age group. As\npart of this enhanced surveillance, medical records for 33\nthrough 2003 have been investigated with criteria for CJD\ndeveloped by the World Health Organization and Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention; none met the criteria\nfor variant CJD.\nCurrently, pathologic review of brain tissue obtained by\nbiopsy or autopsy is the only means of confirming a diag-\nnosis of CJD. Autopsy remains the preferred method for\nobtaining tissue, as brain biopsy can result in serious com-\nplications (e.g., brain hemorrhage or abscess formation)\nand may not yield adequate amounts of tissue for analysis.\nThe main role of brain biopsy is to exclude other, poten-\ntially treatable conditions (4).\nIn this article, we describe results from analysis of\nsummarize responses generated from a statewide survey of\nneurologists and pathologists regarding the challenges to\ndiagnosing CJD and variant CJD, including obtaining\nautopsy in suspected cases.\nThe Study\nCause-of-Death Data (underlying or contributing causes of\ndeath) were obtained from the Center for Health Statistics,\n  Department of Health Services (5).

Both data files\nincluded report of autopsy as a variable, with the exception\nwhen autopsy performance was not recorded. Statistical\nanalysis was performed by using SAS software (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC).\nFrom July to December 2002, questionnaires regarding\nexperience with diagnosing CJD were sent to 1,241\n  neurologists identified as members of the\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and 574 pathologists\nidentified as members of the   Society of\nPathologists and the American Association of\nNeuropathologists.

The results of our surveys, which\nattempted to discern the reasons for this low rate, imply\nthat both neurologists and pathologists have similar per-\nceptions of the value of obtaining histopathologic evalua-\ntion for CJD but for different reasons. Most neurologists\nappeared to be comfortable clinically diagnosing CJD,\nwith more than one third reporting they had never consid-\nered pursuing autopsy for CJD cases. In contrast, patholo-\ngists appeared to be less comfortable making a\nhistopathologic diagnosis, indicating that autopsy perform-\nance was limited by infection control concerns, lack of\nexperience with CJD cases, and institutional restrictions.\nOur results have some limitations. Approximately 10%\nof CJD cases may have atypical signs and symptoms that\ncan obscure the diagnosis. To the extent that these cases\nare misdiagnosed and not autopsied, they could contribute\nto overestimation of the autopsy rate. On the other hand,\ndeath certificate analysis can be an insensitive indicator of\nthe true rate of autopsy, and autopsy performance informa-\nCause-of-Death Data. Both factors could lead to possible\nunderestimation of the true autopsy rate. Given that some\nCJD cases will have had confirmatory brain biopsy or\nstrongly suggestive clinical features and diagnostic stud-\nies, the autopsy rates cited may apply mostly to patients for\nwhom a satisfactory antemortem diagnosis could not be\nmade. Interpreting survey results is limited by the low\nresponse rate; neurologists and pathologists who are expe-\nrienced in diagnosing CJD may be more likely to respond,\nwhich would introduce bias.\nThe public health benefits of performing autopsy on\npatients with suspected CJD should not be underestimated.\nAutopsy and histopathologic analysis remain important\nways to confirm a diagnosis of CJD and help define the\nusual occurrence of subtypes of classic CJD, thereby facil-\nDISPATCHES\nTable 1.

Autopsy\nrates for nonforensic deaths have declined dramatically\nduring the past 40 years, with national hospital rates cur-\nrently <5%, possibly resulting in missed diagnoses of the\nreasons for the decline are multifaceted and include esca-\nlating cost of autopsy borne by hospitals and county med-\nical examiners, lack of direct reimbursement, fear of\nlitigation, and increasing reliance on modern technology to\ndetermine a diagnosis antemortem (10).\nOur survey results suggest that infection control con-\ncerns play a role in low autopsy rates for CJD, whether\nbecause of fears about the risk of acquiring CJD from han-\ndling contaminated tissue or because of liability consider-\nations at the institutional level. More realistically, brain\nautopsy can be performed safely as long as CJD-specific\ninfection control guidelines are strictly followed (12\u00ad13).\nNonetheless, concerns about potentially acquiring CJD\nthrough autopsy procedures should be acknowledged and\nrecognized as an opportunity to address proper infection\ncontrol techniques.\nEnhancing surveillance for variant CJD and other\nemerging prion diseases will require educating neurolo-\ngists and pathologists, addressing the perceived obstacles\nto obtaining autopsy, and encouraging the use of available\nresources that provide expertise and technical assistance in\nevaluating CJD. For example, brain tissue can be submit-\nted to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance\nCenter (NPDPSC) in Cleveland, Ohio, for free state-of-\nthe-art diagnostic testing (14). The availability of a nation-\nal center of expertise may facilitate obtaining tissue\nevaluation; since the inception of NPDPSC, the number of\nreferrals to the facility has more than doubled, from 104 in\nthe University of  , San Francisco, Memory and\nAging Center, can also provide expertise and assistance\nwith diagnostic testing. Such resources are vital to main-\ntaining vigilance for cases of CJD and potentially emerg-\ning human TSEs, such as variant CJD or possibly a human\nform of chronic wasting disease in the United States.\n"
