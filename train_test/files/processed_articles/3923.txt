These hypotheses can be addressed by quantifying competitiveness in\nsports and testing if the sex difference is decreasing over time in the U.S., a society where\nsocial roles have converged. Study 1 assessed participation and the occurrence of relatively\nfast performances by masters runners (40\u00ad74 years old) at recent road races and track\nmeets. Fast performances occurred over 20 times more often at track meets than at road\nraces. Women comprised 55% of finishers at roads races but only 15\u00ad28% of finishers at\ntrack meets. Thus, the sex difference in masters track participation can serve as a measure\nof the sex difference in competitiveness.

The sex difference decreased overall, but there\nwas no evidence of change since the late 1990s.

On the one hand, social structural theory claims that sex differences arise from\nthe different roles men and women occupy in their current societies. It thus predicts sex\ndifferences will weaken and eventually disappear as women's power increases and social\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nevolutionary theory holds that sex differences partly reflect innate predispositions that were\nshaped by the differing challenges that typically faced men and women during human\nevolutionary history. This theory predicts that, although sex differences may vary as a\nfunction of social roles and other factors, some differences will remain robust across all\nResearchers have addressed these predictions by making comparisons across\nnations or within the same society across time periods. Several studies have supported\nZentner and Mitura, 2012). Nevertheless, other studies indicate that some predicted\nassociations are not robust (e.g., Buss, 1989; Gangestad et al., 2006; Lueptow, Garovich-\nSzabo, and Lueptow, 2001; Schmitt, 2012). Moreover, studies guided by evolutionary\ntheory have generated and found support for predictions regarding sex differences that do\nnot follow from social structural theory (e.g., Buss, 1989; Gangestad et al., 2006; Lippa,\nGangestad and colleagues (2006) showed that, across nations, pathogen prevalence predicts\nsex differences in the preference for a mate's intelligence.\nA major limitation of nearly all of these studies is their reliance on self-reports,\nwhich makes interpretation difficult (Lueptow et al., 2001; Schmitt et al., 2008; Wood and\nEagly, 2012). It therefore may be fruitful to consider sex differences in behaviorally\nexpressed preferences and motivations. In this spirit, Deaner (2006a, 2013) suggested that\nthe sex difference in competitiveness might be assessed in sports, especially distance\nrunning.\nCompetitiveness, especially the willingness to engage in direct competition\n(hereafter \"competitiveness\"), is an appropriate focus because it apparently constitutes a\n2010). In fact, the sex difference in competitiveness is thought to be important for\nunderstanding crime, mortality patterns, labor markets, and the arts and sciences (Archer,\n2011; Wilson and Daly, 1985). Evidence for a sex difference in competitiveness has\nemerged in many contexts: In laboratory games, men are more likely than women to\nchoose competitive rather than non-competitive compensation schemes (Croson and\nGneezy, 2009; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011); on surveys, men report greater enjoyment\nof competition in general (Houston, Harris, Moore, Brummett, and Kametani, 2005; Piko,\nSkulteti, Luszczynska, and Gibbons, 2010), greater desire to win in interpersonal situations\n(Gill, 1988; Spence and Helmreich, 1983), and greater desire to strive for success relative\nto others in sports (Gill, 1988; Merten, 2008); in their free time, boys and men play video\ngames more often than girls and women, particularly competitive games, and males are\nmore likely to report that competition motivates them to play (Hartmann and Klimmt,\nsubstantially more often than girls and women, although there is no consistent difference\nDistance running is an excellent area for assessing competitiveness because the\nmotivation to run varies substantially among participants. Whereas some runners are\nprimarily motivated by competition, most run for a variety of other reasons, such as\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\naffiliation, health, and life meaning (Masters, Ogles, and Jolton, 1993; Ogles and Masters,\n2003). Distance running is also advantageous because, unlike most other sports, it is\ngenerally accessible, acceptable, and popular for both men and women (Deaner, 2013).\nDeaner (2006a, 2013) suggested that a sex difference in competitiveness in distance\nrunning could be assessed across contexts and time periods by quantifying the frequency of\nmale and female runners that run fast relative to sex-specific world class standards. For\nexample, in a typical 5 kilometer road race held in the U.S., for every woman that finishes\nwithin 125% of the female world record, there are roughly three men that finish within\nis based on the assumption that relative performance predicts training volumes and\ncompetitiveness similarly in men and women, an assumption with empirical support\nthat, although the number of women that participate in distance running in the U.S. has\ngrown greatly since the 1980s so that there is no longer a consistent sex difference in\nparticipation, there are still roughly three times as many men that run fast relative to sex-\nspecific world class standards. This pattern holds robustly for elite runners and non-elite\n(i.e., recreational) runners, and tests reveal no indication that the sex difference in the\nnumber of relatively fast performers has diminished over the past few decades.\nThis temporal stability in relative performance challenges social structural theory\nbecause social roles have converged substantially in the U.S. over this time. This is true in\neducation, politics, and the labor force (Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, and Ristikari, 2011;\nLueptow et al., 2001; National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education [NCWGE],\nconsensus that great progress has been made in increasing females' competitive athletic\nNevertheless, because relative running performance is an indirect indicator of\ncompetitiveness, alternative interpretations for these results remain plausible (Deaner,\nHere, we more directly address the putative sex difference in competitiveness in\ndistance running and the possibility of historical change. In Study 1, we demonstrate that,\nalthough participation in road races is not a valid indicator of competitiveness, participation\nat masters track meets generally is. In particular, we show that most finishers at masters\ntrack meets perform at a high level and that, unlike at road races, there is a pronounced sex\ndifference in participation. In Study 2, we examine patterns of masters track participation\nOur studies are notable in focusing on masters runners, who are generally defined as\nbeing at least 40 years of age. We focused on these older runners rather than adolescents\nand young adults participating on high school and intercollegiate teams because, in the\nU.S., participation in these contexts is often motivated or modulated by extrinsic factors\n(Bowen and Shulman, 2001). In particular, some high school athletes participate to increase\ntheir prospects of being admitted to college or of receiving financial aid, and some\ncollegiate athletes may participate to maintain financial aid (Bowen and Shulman, 2001). In\naddition, at institutions offering intercollegiate sports, the assortment of sports teams that\nare sponsored and the number of athletes that are allowed on each team are strongly\naffected by financial considerations, institutional gender-equity participation goals, and\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nroster size limitations set by external governing bodies (Brake, 2010; Gavora, 2001;\nHogshead-Makar and Zimbalist, 2007; Rhoads, 2004). Thus, some believe that the sex\ndifference in organized school sports participation substantially underestimates the sex\ndifference in the desire to participate (Gavora, 2001; Rhoads, 2004). Recent studies support\nthis suggestion, showing that the sex difference in organized school sports participation is\nfar smaller than the sex difference in participation in unrestricted contexts (Deaner et al.,\nFor masters runners, by contrast, there are apparently no major incentives for\nexcelling (e.g., scholarships, prizes) or external constraints on participation (Cardenas,\nachieving an excellent performance and/or choosing to compete in a context where such\nperformances occur frequently should indicate genuine competitiveness. Furthermore,\nusing cross-temporal data from masters runners provides an especially powerful test of\nsocial structural theory (Study 2). This is because childhood and adolescent sport\nexperience is thought to shape adult sports interest (Fredricks and Eccles, 2005; Scheerder\net al., 2006), and the youth athletic experience and available role models for female masters\nrunners has increased substantially over time. Therefore, if social structural theory is\ncorrect, then the analyses in Study 2 will reveal that the sex difference in masters track\nparticipation has decreased.\nRoad races--from 5 kilometers (\"5K\") to the marathon (42.195 km)--have grown\ntremendously in popularity in the last few decades (Latter, 2012; Running USA, 2012b). In\nthe United States, this growth has been especially strong among women, who comprised\nand Mitchell, 2011; Running USA, 2012b). Another notable aspect of this \"second running\nboom\" has been its non-competitive emphasis, at least in the U.S. There is much evidence\nfor this: Although outstanding performers are often awarded medals or prizes, almost all\nroad races distribute memorial clothing to all registrants, and longer races typically award\nconsider finishing a marathon, no matter the time, to be a significant life achievement\n(Bingham, 2002; Burfoot, 2005); most races aim to attract large fields to support charities\nor earn profits, whereas few focus on optimizing racing conditions (Latter, 2012; Magill,\n2012; Robbins, 2010); for both men and women, median marathon times have slowed by\nparticipants report that they are strongly motivated by competition (Masters et al., 1993;\nDistance runners can also participate in track meets, but there is no indication of\nincreased participation in this context (Gerweck, 2012). This is apparently related to the\ncontinued emphasis on competition: Although many track meets award medals to winners\nor near winners, almost none award them merely for finishing, and many track meets that\nallow participation by older adults focus on formal competition between clubs or allowing\nindividuals to pursue qualifying performances for more prestigious meets.\nThe difference between road races and track meets is encapsulated in remarks by\nTom Derderian, coach of the Greater Boston Track Club:\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nThere's no running boom in track... There's nowhere to hide on a track...There's a\nphilosophy that's become prevalent in road racing that as long as you finish, you're\na winner. There's none of that in track. Track races are a very precise means of\ndetermining who's a winner, and how far behind everyone else is. There's no warm,\nfuzzy way to spin that. You're out there naked to the watch, and not too many\npeople want to do that, have the balls to do that. (Gerweck, 2012, para. 5)\nThese considerations suggest the hypothesis that participation in track meets, but\nnot road races, indicates competitiveness. This hypothesis can be assessed by testing the\nprediction that a far larger percentage of masters individuals run fast at track meets than at\nroad races. The basis of this prediction is that fast performances reliably correlate with self-\nreported competitiveness (e.g., \"to compete with others\") and greater running volumes\n1995). Moreover, these relationships are similar in men and women (Deaner et al., 2011).\nIn contrast to competitiveness, other running motives (e.g., health orientation) do not\ncorrelate with performance and training volume or, in the case of personal goal\nachievement (e.g., \"to compete with myself\"), do so only weakly (Masters et al., 1993;\nWe test this key prediction by quantifying the percentage of masters finishers at\ntrack meets and road races that achieve fast performances relative to sex-specific, age-\nspecific world class standards. We further assess the validity of masters track meet\nparticipation as an indicator of competitiveness by testing the prediction that masters men\nare substantially more likely than masters women to participate at track meets, but not at\nroad races. As noted above, previous studies have shown that more men than women run\nrelatively fast in road races, and that this seems explicable, at least in part, to more men\nmaintaining high training volumes, a correlate of competitiveness (Deaner, 2013).\nMoreover, more male than female runners report that competition motivates them to run\nMaterials and Methods\nTrack: State games\nTo obtain a representative sample of large track meets for masters runners, we\nfocused on the State Senior Games (hereafter \"State Games\") that are held in each of the 50\nU.S. states and the District of Columbia; top performances allow individuals to qualify for\nthe National Senior Games (www.nsga.com). The State Games generally include a wide\nvariety of sports (e.g., archery, badminton, basketball, etc.), and the track and field meets\nfeature several race distances. The State Games are open to individuals who are at least 50\nyears of age, and most states only allow participation by their residents. Our sample\ncomprised the first 25 states in alphabetical order that posted track and field results online\nfor the year 2012. We originally planned to use data from all states with available data.\nHowever, we elected to stop at 25 states because data collection was tedious and our initial\nanalyses indicated that our sample was already fairly large and that the predicted effects\nwere large.\nWe took data from the 800 m and 1500 m races, the longest track events held in\nyears. For each age group and race, we recorded the number of male and female finishers.\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nWe also recorded the number who met or exceeded (i.e., ran faster than) 125% or 150% of\nthe sex-specific, age-specific world record (www.mastersathletics.net). For example, for\nTrack: All masters\nA possible concern about the State Games sample is that it may be\nunrepresentatively competitive because it carries the prestige of being a state championship\nand national qualifier. Therefore, we developed a second sample based on a list of masters\ntrack meets occurring in the United States (www.mastersrankings.com). This list is\nmaintained by USA Track and Field (USATF) and is meant to be comprehensive. It\nincludes relatively large, prestigious masters meets, smaller masters meets, and masters\nperformances occurring at open (all ages) meets that are primarily oriented towards\nyounger athletes. For convenience, we examined all 177 meets listed for May 2011 and all\n302 meets listed for June 2012. These months were selected because they are months when\noutdoor track meets frequently occur throughout the U.S. We chose different months in\neach year to ensure that meets would not be duplicated. No State Games meets were\nincluded in this sample.\nFor this sample (hereafter \"All Masters\"), we included data for the 800 m, 1500 m,\nand 5000 m track races. We included the same age groups as we did with the State Games;\nhowever, because data were available, we added the 40\u00ad44 age group. For these age groups\nand events, there was at least one performance at 138 of the 479 meets; the other meets\nindicated at least one performance for other events and/or age groups. We again recorded\nthe number of participants and the number who achieved 125% and 150% standards.\nRoad races\nWe compiled our road race sample from two sources. First, Deaner (2006b)\nidentified and analyzed 20 of the largest 5Ks in the U.S. occurring in 2003. We sought\n2012 data for these races; however, because many of these races no longer occur, data were\nonly available for 10 of them. Second, we added 10 5K races from a website that attempts\nto maintain a comprehensive list of all road races in the U.S. (www.runningintheusa.com).\nWe used the advanced search tool and considered races that had \"5K\" in the title but did\nnot include the words \"walk,\" \"trail,\" \"women,\" or \"girls.\" To be included, races must have\npresented complete finishers' data for five-year age grouping and must have had at least\n200 total finishers of all ages. We included the first 10 races meeting these criteria that\nage groups and again recorded the number of finishers and the number of them who\nResults\nParticipation\nAs expected, masters track meets had substantially lower rates of participation than\n5K road races (see Table 1). In particular, at the 25 State Games meets, there were 471\nfinishers (M = 18.8 finishers per meet; SD = 8.5); at the 138 All Masters meets, there were\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nTable 1.

This\nrevealed that a runner at a track meet was 36 times more likely to achieve either standard\nstandard).1\n1 Technically speaking, the odds ratio indicates that the odds (not the probability) of achieving the standard is\nmultiplied by a factor of 36 for a runner at a track meet compared to a runner at a road race.

This is because most track performances were 800 m\nor 1500 m rather than 5000 m, and achieving relative performance standards becomes\nincreasingly infrequent and presumably more difficult with longer distances (Deaner,\n2006a; Deaner and Mitchell, 2011). Based on equations used in an earlier study (Deaner,\nto achieving 156% of a 5000 m standard. Although this means that the differences noted\nabove are overstated, the difference would remain very large even if we used formal\ncorrections. This is revealed by the fact that the percentage of finishers reaching the 125%\nstandard at track meets was more than twice as great as the percentage reaching the (much\nraces at All Masters track meets (i.e., same distance as 5K road races), 38% reached the\n125% standard and 83% reached the 150% standard. Finally, we also gathered data on road\nrace finishers reaching the 160% standard; only 11% did so, meaning that a runner at a\ntrack meet was 20.9 times more likely to reach the 150% standard than was a runner in a\nroad race to reach the 160% standard. Thus, we can be confident that runners at track meets\nare indeed far more likely to run fast than runners at road races.\nAnother important result is that the difference between road races and track meets\noccurred for both men and women (see Tables 1 and 2). Men's odds ratios for achieving\n125% and 150% standards at a track meet (combined samples) compared to a road race\nbetween road races and track meets occurred within all age groups. The odds ratios were\nSex differences\nWe next considered the prediction that men would participate more than women at\ntrack meets but not at road races. As predicted, women comprised 52% of finishers at 5K\nroad races but only 28% of finishers at State Games meets and 15% of finishers at the All\nIn the 40\u00ad44 age group, women comprised 55% of finishers at road races and 17% at All\nroad races, 34% at State Games meets and 18% at All Masters meets (p < .0001); in the\nFinally, we examined whether--among road race finishers--men were more likely\nthan women to run relatively fast, as reported in previous studies with runners less than 40\nDiscussion\nThis study had two main findings. First, participants at masters track meets in the\nU.S. were at least 20 times more likely to run fast than masters participants at road races\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nwere. Second, women comprised 52% of masters finishers at 5K road races but only 15\u00ad\n28% of masters finishers at track meets. Both of these results are novel yet consistent with\nprevious work. In particular, earlier reports indicated slightly greater female than male\nparticipation in contemporary U.S. 5K road races (Deaner and Mitchell, 2011; Running\nUSA, 2012b) and that the percentage of runners that run relatively fast at U.S. road races,\nalthough quite low, is higher in men than women (Deaner, 2006b; Deaner and Mitchell,\nOne concern about this study is that road races were 5K (5000 m) whereas most of\nthe track meet races were of shorter distances (i.e., 800 m or 1500 m). Because achieving\nand Mitchell, 2011), this will overestimate the difference in fast performances between\nthese contexts. However, we showed that the difference between these contexts remained\nvery large even when making conservative comparisons, including direct comparisons of\nBecause fast performances reliably correlate with self-reported competitiveness and\nthe maintenance of larger training volumes (Masters et al., 1993; Ogles et al., 1995; Ogles\nand Masters, 2000, 2003), these new results support the hypothesis that masters track\nparticipation is a valid measure of competitiveness and that, at the population level, the sex\ndifference in master track participation is a reasonable indicator of the sex difference in\ncompetitiveness. Of course, this is a population level result and does not signify anything\nabout specific individuals; many road race participants may very well be highly\ncompetitive and many track meet participants may not be.\nIn Study 2, we test social structural theory's prediction that, in the U.S., the sex\ndifference in competitiveness has decreased as social roles have converged in the past few\nWe do this by using the sex difference in masters track participation as a proxy for the sex\ndifference in competitiveness, an approach strongly supported by Study 1. We next discuss\nour measures of masters track participation and social roles.\nMasters track participation\nNeither sampling method used in Study 1 to assess masters track participation was\nviable for temporal comparisons. However, we identified a workable analog for each. First,\nthe State Games appear to be a fairly recent occurrence, and we were unable to locate\nhistorical data. Fortunately, USA Track and Field (USATF) has annually held a national\nmasters championship meet, and data are publicly available going back several decades.\nSecond, amassing data on participation at hundreds of individual masters track meets\nacross years, similar to the \"All Masters\" sample in Study 1, would be very difficult\nbecause many meets do not persist from year to year. Fortunately, USATF maintains yearly\nrankings lists, which aggregate all reported performances in a given calendar year by sex,\nage group, and event. These lists document the best performance for any individual known\nto have competed at least once, and they are publicly available beginning in 1988.\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nSocial roles\nOur primary proxy for convergence in social roles in the U.S. is year--an approach\nused by many studies (reviewed in Wood and Eagly, 2012). This approach is appropriate\nbecause year correlates positively with many measures of social role convergence (see\nFigure 2; Twenge et al., 2012). However, we also explored the predictive capacity of more\ndirect measures. First, because the division of labor is thought to play a fundamental role in\nproduction of sex-differentiated behavior (Wood and Eagly, 2012), we used the percentage\nof U.S. civilian women in the paid labor force (see Figure 2; Twenge et al., 2012). A\nlimitation of this measure is that working women remain over-represented in female-typical\n(communal) occupations and less likely than men to attain high status positions (Kan,\nsecond measure of the division of labor, we used the wage gap between male and female\nworkers (see Figure 2). For instance, the wage gap indicates that in 2011, on average, a\nfull-time, year-round working woman earned 82% as much as her male counterpart (U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics, 2013). This gap is believed to partly reflect discrimination,\nalthough it also reflects men working more hours and holding different jobs (Blau and\nreasonable proxy for working women's employment converging with men's.\nFigure 2. Convergence in social roles over time\nNote. Labor Force Participation indicates the percentage of civilian\nwomen aged 16 years or older in the U.S. paid labor force. Wage Gap\nindicates, for full-time U.S. workers, women's earnings as a\npercentage of men's. High School Sports Participants indicates the\npercentage of sports participants in U.S. high schools that are women.\nOlympic Participation indicates the percentage of participants in the\nSummer Olympic Games that are women.\nIn addition, because the influence of social roles might be partly domain-specific\n(Koenig et al., 2011), we used two measures of convergence in sport participation. The first\nLabor Force Participation\nWage Gap\nHigh School Sports Participation\nOlympic Participation\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nwas the percentage of participants that are female in U.S. high school sports (see Figure 2).\nThis represents a local, readily observable level of sport participation, with high rates of\nparticipation even among individuals of modest athletic ability (Stevenson, 2007). Females'\nparticipation in high schools sports increased dramatically in the wake of Title IX, an\neducation reform that bars sex discrimination in access to athletic opportunities in\nfederally-funded educational institutions (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist,\n2007; Stevenson, 2007). The second measure was the percentage of participants that are\nfemale in the Summer Olympic Games (see Figure 2). The Summer Olympic Games\nprovides the world's greatest variety of elite sports competition (Lowen, Deaner, and\nSchmitt, 2014), and the percentage female participation should proxy elite athletic\nopportunities for girls and women. We also note that the Olympics could have direct effects\non perceptions of the appropriateness of female sports. This is because the Olympics are\none of the few elite sporting contexts where female athletes receive media coverage that is\nreasonably similar to that of men (Billings, Angelini, and Duke, 2010), and this coverage is\nspread over more than 500 television channels across the globe, and these broadcasts\nreached an estimated 3.6 billion viewers (International Olympic Committee, 2013). The\nU.S. has had much success in the Olympics, although for both men and women, U.S.\nparticipation and success in winning medals is unremarkable after controlling for country\nlevel characteristics, such as population, gross domestic product, and gender inequality\nLagging social role measures\nOne limitation of these measures of social role convergence is that adult\ndispositions are thought to be largely shaped during childhood or adolescence (e.g.,\nTwenge, 1997b, 2001). Thus, the increasing occurrence of women in male-typical (agentic\nor instrumental) roles in the late 1980s, for example, might be irrelevant to the\ncompetiveness of women who were 40 years old at that time. However, these changes\ncould have impacted girls entering high school in the late 1980s; these individuals would be\neligible to participate in masters track meets in the early 2010s. To address this issue, we\nrepeated our analyses after lagging social role measures. We did this by taking the year of\ncompetition and subtracting the midpoint of the relevant age group and then adding 14\nyears to approximate early adolescence. For example, for runners in the 40\u00ad44 age group\nalso repeated these analyses after adding 8 rather than 14 years, as this would approximate\nmid-childhood. Unfortunately, we often lacked sufficient data to test the importance of the\nwage gap and high school sports participation when individuals in an age group cohort\nwould have been in early adolescence and mid-childhood (see Figure 2).\nOur primary analyses, which used year as a proxy for social role convergence, did\nnot require lagging years to approximate early adolescence or mid-childhood. This is\nbecause year, by definition, increases uniformly for all age groups at all times.\nMaterials and Methods\ndistances. We used the four age groups from Study 1, although to increase statistical power,\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nThus, there were 21 events per year.\nUSA Championships\nWe obtained data on the USATF's annual masters national championship meet\n(hereafter USA Championships) from the organization's links, especially\nwww.mastershistory.org/history/resultsusa.html. We obtained data on all years from 1988\u00ad\navailable for 1991. USATF allows non-Americans to participate in the championship meet,\nbut for some meets, especially in the 1990s and earlier, participants' citizenship was not\nindicated. To allow fair comparisons across years, we therefore based most analyses on all\nparticipants. However, we repeated some analyses using only U.S. citizens; for this we\nwomen were U.S. citizens. We counted an individual as participating if they were listed as\nregistered for the event in any capacity, even if they did not start, did not finish, or were\n92% of female participants legally finished their races.\nRankings\nwww.mastersrankings.com. Unfortunately, no data were available for 2002. In addition,\nevents (mostly for older age groups), both men and women had 25 or fewer ranked\nperformers, potentially allowing a sex difference to be computed; nonetheless, we did not\ninclude this data because such events might be unrepresentative of the typical sex\ndifference in that event. Therefore, there were no rankings data included from 2002\u00ad2006.\nSocial role convergence\nWe obtained data on the percentage of U.S. civilian women over the age of 16\nparticipating in the workforce from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor\nStatistics Data, 2014); we obtained data prior to 1948 from the Statistical Abstracts of the\nUnited States (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). We obtained data on the percentage\nwage gap between male and female full-time workers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013). We obtained data on high school sports\nparticipation from the National Federation of State High School Associations (National\nFederation of State High School Associations, 2013). We obtained data on Summer\nOlympic Participation from Wikipedia (\"Summer Olympic Games,\" 2014), which compiles\ninformation from the International Olympic Committee as well as sports scholars with\nmore accurate information. The Olympics occur once every four years; to maintain an\nadequate sample size, we assumed the Olympic participation value would remain fixed for\nthe following three years.\nAnalysis\nWe used the R programming language to conduct statistical analyses. In all models,\nthe dependent variable was female representation, measured as a percentage of total\nparticipants. We used multiple regression models with year or a social role convergence\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nmeasure as the explanatory variable of primary interest in order to investigate potential\ntime trends. We also controlled for age group and race distance. Moreover, since the\nnumber of runners varied substantially by race distance and especially by age group, our\nmodels were weighted by the total number of men and women in a given event. All\nstatistical tests were two tailed and, owing to the substantial number of tests, we used a 1%\nsignificance level ( = 0.01). The choice of  did not qualitatively affect our conclusions,\nand exact p-values are reported for all tests in the text or tables.\nResults\nWe first examined the sex difference in participation across all events, age-groups\nand years. For the USA Championships, there were 7,127 participants, and 27% were\nwomen. The sex difference was smallest in the 40\u00ad44 age group, where women comprised\n32% of participants; the sex difference was largest in the oldest three age groups, where\nwomen comprised 22% (see Table 3). For the yearly rankings, there were 32,696 ranked\nindividuals (hereafter \"participants\"), 22% of which were women. The percentage of\nfemale participants ranged from 20\u00ad23% across age groups (see Table 3).\nTable 3. The number of men and women participating in USA Masters Championships and\nUSA Championships Rankings\nAge group Men Women % Women Men Women % Women\nUSA Championships\nWe next examined whether the sex difference in participation decreased over time,\nbeginning with the USA championship meet. The multiple regression revealed that\npercentage female participation was significantly predicted by year and also by age group,\nbut not by race distance (R2 = .15; year\neach age group and found a significant increase in percentage female participation for the\nprovides slopes and p-values for all seven age groups.\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nTable 4.

In the overall model, year was positively associated with percentage female\nparticipation, although it no longer reached significance (R2 = .15; year\nTable 4), there was a significant increase in female participation in the 55\u00ad59 age group\nalso repeated these analyses using only U.S. citizens and found nearly identical results (see\nTable 4). Finally, we repeated these analyses using data from only the last 10 years of the\nstudy, from 2003\u00ad2012. In the overall model, year was negatively associated with\npercentage female participation, although this did not reach significance (R2 = .15; year\n=\nwere two significant changes within age groups: decreases in the 65\u00ad69 (-1.56% per year)\nYearly rankings\nWe performed similar analyses with the yearly rankings. The initial multiple\nregression model indicated that, with data from 1988\u00ad2012, the percentage of female\nparticipation was positively associated with year but--at the 1% level--not age group or\nwithin age groups, we conducted regressions separately for each (see Table 5). There were\nsignificant increases in the percentage of female participation for the 45\u00ad49 (0.29% per\nThe percentage of female participation was not predicted by any of the three candidate\n= 1.13, p = .32).

In this case, the model suggested an overall\ndecrease in female participation, although this did not reach significance (R2 = .12; year\n=\nwere no significant changes within age groups (see Table 5).\nFigure 3.

Values represent slopes, in units of % increase per year, with p-values in parentheses.\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nSocial role convergence\nFinally, we investigated whether our main results would change if we substituted\nmeasures of social role convergence for year. The logic is that although year is, in general,\npositively associated with various measures of social convergence (see Figure 2), the yearly\nvalue of one (or more) of these more direct measures might prove to be a stronger predictor\nof female participation than year itself. In addition, for each of these measures, we\nexamined predictive capacity of each measure's yearly value from the year when the\nindividuals in an age group were approximately 8 years old and also from the year when\nthey were approximately 14 years old.\nIn the Supplemental Information (see Tables S1\u00adS22), we present results for each\nsocial role convergence measure pooled across all age groups (controlling for age group\nand race distance). Tables S1\u00adS22 also present results stratified by age group, but given the\nsometimes small sample sizes, we restrict our summaries in the text to the overall models.\nIn addition, although we continue to use a 1% significance level ( = 0.01), we note all p-\nLabor force\nIncreased women in the labor force predicted a significant increase in female\nwas unchanged when we used labor force data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see\nTable S2) and 14 years old (see Table S3).\nWhen we examined yearly rankings, rather than the USA championship meets,\nincreased women in the labor force again predicted a significant increase in female track\nparticipation across all 25 years, and it was a nearly significant predictor the past 15 years\nforce data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S5) and 14 years old (see Table\nS6), women in the labor force again predicted a significant increase in female track\nWage gap\nDecreased wage gap (i.e., increased women's earnings relative to men's) predicted\na significant increase in female participation in the USA championship meet across all 25\nyears, but not for the past 15 or 10 years (see Table S7). However, the increase for the past\n15 was nearly significant (p = 0.06). There was insufficient wage gap data to test any age\ngroups when cohorts were 8 years old. Only the 40\u00ad44 age group could be tested when age\nS8). The result was that decreased wage gap predicted a near significant (p = .04) decrease\nin female participation (i.e., a result contrary to social structural theory).\nFor yearly rankings, decreased wage gap predicted a significant increase in female\ntrack participation across all 25 years, but not for the past 15 or 6 years (see Table S9).\nThere was insufficient wage gap data to test any age groups when age group cohorts were 8\nyears old. Only the 40\u00ad44 age group could be tested when the age group cohorts were 14\nyears old, and only for the years 2007\u00ad2012; there was not a significant effect (see Table\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nHigh school sports participation\nIncreased female high school sports participation predicted a significant increase in\nfemale participation in the USA championship meet across all 25 years, but not for the past\n15 or 10 years (see Table S11).

Patterns were similar when we used Olympic participation data\nwhen age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S21) and 14 years old (see Table S22),\nalthough there was no indication of a decrease when using data from the past 6 years.\nDiscussion\nThis study had three main results. First, we found a large sex difference in masters\nparticipation with two large data sets: USA Championships and yearly rankings (see Table\n2). Across all years combined, women constituted 27% of participants in the USA national\nchampionships meet and 22% of those individuals who appeared in the yearly rankings.\nThese results fully corroborate Study 1, which found similar sex differences with two other\nindependent data sets.\nThis study's second main result was that, in both data sets, we found that the sex\ndifference in masters participation significantly decreased across the 25 years for which we\nhad data, from 1988\u00ad2012. Nonetheless, in both data sets, the decreasing sex difference has\nnot occurred since approximately the late 1990s. Moreover, the historical change was\nmodest: For the USA championships, women constituted 21% of participants from 1988\u00ad\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nThis study's third important result was that these results proved robust when we\nsubstituted four direct measures of social role convergence for year (i.e., labor force, wage\ngap, high school sports participation, and Olympic participation). In particular, for each of\nthe four social role convergence measures and both measures of masters participation (i.e.,\neight tests in total), there was a significant decrease in the sex difference from 1988\u00ad2012.\nHowever, in no case did the significant decrease persist when we only examined the last 15\ndid the other participation data set corroborate it. First, from 1998\u00ad2012, labor force was a\nnearly significant predictor for yearly rankings (p = .06; 0.77% increase per year; see Table\nS5); however, over this period, labor force was not predictive for USA championships (p =\nfor USA championships (p = .06; 0.61% per year; see Table S8); however, over this period,\nwage gap was not predictive for yearly rankings (p = .65; see Table S10).\nWe also repeated the analyses of direct measures of social role convergence using\neach measure's yearly value from the year when the individuals in an age group were\napproximately 8 years old (mid-childhood) and also from the year when they were\napproximately 14 years old (early adolescence). For labor force and Olympic participation\nthere was sufficient historical data to conduct complete tests: In both cases, for both\nmasters participation measures, the sex difference significantly decreased from 1988\u00ad2012\ncould be conducted, mostly with younger age groups and for recent years. For both of these\npredictors, and for both masters participation measures, all tests failed to reach\nsignificance, and the coefficients were uniformly in the direction contrary to social\nstructural theory.\nThe timing and cause(s) of the sex difference in female participation\nWhat aspects of social structural convergence could have caused the increase in\nfemale participation? Unfortunately, our analyses could not answer this question because\nall four direct measures of social role convergence were qualitatively identical to year\nlagged analyses of these measures yielded similar results.\nOne possibility is that one or more social changes occurring in the 1990s increased\nthe motivation of masters-aged women to compete. There was for example, an increase in\nfemale athletes appearing on television during this decade (Messner, Duncan, and Cooky,\n2003). Another possibility is that changes occurring during childhood or adolescence were\ncritical, although this possibility is perhaps less likely because the changes would then have\noccurred at different times for different age groups. For instance, a 70 year-old woman\ntracking specific age group cohorts over time, especially as data accumulates in the coming\ndecades.\nOne thing that is notable about the timing of the female participation increase,\ngenerally in the 1990s, is that it is inconsistent with the hypothesis that Title IX affected\nfemale competitiveness due to girls growing up with more female athletic role models. For\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nexample, given the spike in female high school sports participation in the 1970s and 1980s\n(who were 14 years old in 1972); however, there was no evidence for such an increase.\nGeneral Discussion\nThere has been long-standing interest in testing the two major theories for the\norigins of sex differences in preferences and motivations, social structural theory and\nevolutionary theory. Although much empirical research has been conducted, almost all of it\nhas relied on self-reports. These can be problematic for several reasons, including that the\nsame item might be interpreted differently (e.g., become socially undesirable) in different\ntime periods (Lueptow et al., 2001) and because response variability might reflect\nindividuals' choice of comparison group (e.g., own sex vs. both sexes) when responding to\nrating scales (Wood and Eagly 2012; but see Schmitt et al., 2008). Therefore, the studies\npresented in this article--based on real-world behavior rather than self-reports--represent\nan important complement to previous work.\nStudy 1 provided new evidence that, although slightly more women than men\nparticipate in masters distance running in the contemporary U.S., among the fairly small\nnumber of individuals that run with a competitive orientation, men substantially outnumber\nwomen. This was demonstrated because at masters track meets, where we showed that\nmost participants actually run fast, men participate about three times more often than\nwomen do.\nBecause Study 1 established the validity of the sex difference in masters track\nparticipation as an indicator of the sex difference in competitiveness, Study 2 could address\nthe possibility of change over time. For both the USA championships and yearly rankings\ndatasets, the results were clear: The sex difference decreased from 1988 to 2012, but there\nwas no evidence of change since the late 1990s. These results provide powerful\nindicating that the sex difference in competitiveness is large and stable. Because social\nroles have been generally converging (see Figure 2), these results challenge social\nstructural theory, at least with regards to competitiveness in sports in the U.S.\nObjections\nOne potential objection to our studies is that it might seem odd to measure a sex\ndifference in competitiveness in sports by quantifying the number of men and women who\nparticipate at masters track meets. As discussed in Study 1, we believe this is a reasonable\napproach given that fast performances occurred frequently at track meets, over 20 times\nmore often than at road races, and that previous survey studies have shown that, in large\npopulations of recreational runners, faster performances reliably correlate with greater self-\n2003). We acknowledge that these surveys did not recruit track meet participants, and it is\nconceivable that these runners generally run fast despite generally having low\ncompetitiveness. However, we know of no reason to anticipate this; furthermore, many\ntrack meet participants also participate in road races.\nIt is also worth noting that there are other lines of evidence indicating an average\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nsex difference in competitiveness in U.S. distance runners. First, men are more likely than\nwomen to run fast relative to sex-specific world class standards, and this is likely due, in\npart, to their greater competitiveness and willingness to maintain large training volumes\nwomen to report that competition motivates them to run (Callen, 1983; Johnsgard, 1985;\nOgles and Masters, 2003). Third, a study reported that when they have the option of\nentering a single-sex competitive road race or a single-sex non-competitive road race held\nin the same location on the same day, men were substantially more likely than women to\nselect the competitive race (Garratt, Weinberger, and Johnson, 2013). Finally, it has been\nshown that there is a robust difference in pacing in the marathon: Men are three times more\nlikely than women to slow dramatically, and this probably reflects, in part, men's greater\npropensity for risk-taking (Deaner, Carter, Joyner, and Hunter, 2014), which may be related\nto their greater competitiveness (C\u00e1rdenas, Dreber, von Essen, and Ranehill, 2012; Croson\nA second potential objection to our interpretation is that social roles have not, in\nfact, substantially converged over our study period. This is because men are still greatly\nover-represented in many positions in society, particularly positions of leadership (Koenig\nhowever, because tests of social structural theory do not require that men and women have\nidentical social roles; they only require general convergence. And the evidence for\nconvergence in the U.S. is strong even since the 1990s, at least for some measures (see\nFigure 2). This is true in education, the labor force, and cultural products (NCWGE, 2012;\nTwenge et al., 2012). Moreover, in Study 2 we showed that analyses using more direct\nmeasures of social role convergence (i.e., yearly values for labor force, wage gap, high\nschool sports participation, and Olympic participation) yielded results that were highly\nsimilar to those using year itself. These findings underscore that changes in social roles\nwere not consistently associated with changes in the sex difference in masters track\nparticipation.\nIn addition, it has been argued that the influence of social roles might be partly\ndomain-specific (Koenig et al., 2011), and the convergence of social roles has been clear in\nsports. Most notably, Olympic and professional opportunities for female athletes have\ngreatly increased (see Figure 2; Eitzen and Sage, 2002; Lowen et al., 2014), and girls and\nwomen have come to comprise more than 40% of participants in organized school sports in\nthe U.S. (see Figure 2; National Federation of State High School Associations, 2010;\nNCAA Research, 2010). In fact, Title IX scholars and advocates routinely claim that this\nconvergence in social roles in sports has diminished and will eventually eliminate the\nremaining sex difference in sports interest (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist,\n2007). Although there is little empirical evidence for these claims (Deaner et al., 2012),\ntheir repeated assertion indicates that the expectation of convergence in competitiveness in\nsports is highly plausible.\nA third, related objection acknowledges that social roles have converged but claims\nthat there will be a substantial time lag between this and the convergence in female\ncompetitiveness. In other words, the 25 years of our study or the 40 years since the passage\nof Title IX simply was not enough time. Because one could always claim that more time is\nneeded, this hypothesis is, in some sense, unfalsifiable. However, it can be noted that\nprevious studies of changes in sex differences across time within the U.S. did not anticipate\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nor report evidence for a generation lag; instead, they assumed that if one generational\ncohort had substantially different experiences in childhood and adolescence than another,\nthey would develop differently (e.g., Twenge, 1997b, 2001). In fact, because childhood and\nadolescent sport experience may strongly affect adult sports interest (Fredricks and Eccles,\n2005; Scheerder et al., 2006), our results seem particularly damaging to social structural\ntheory. This is because the early athletic experience and available role models for female\nmasters runners participating in the late 1990s were strikingly different than those of\ncontemporary female masters runners (see Figure 2).\nA fourth objection recognizes that social structural theory has been falsified for\ndistance running but argues this pattern may not hold for other sports. This objection merits\nconsideration, but the available data provide little support for it. Historical and cross-\nsocietal studies of sports indicate that many societies have had appreciable female\nparticipation and interest, especially in societies where women have enjoyed greater control\nof resources and political power (Deaner and Smith, 2013). Nonetheless, boys and men\nappear to be substantially more involved than girls and women in all societies (Deaner and\nassert that there is no sex difference in general sports interest (NCWGE, 2012) or else that\nit is rapidly disappearing (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist, 2007), men\nactually show substantially greater interest (Deaner et al., 2012). Most relevant is a recent\nstudy that assessed intramural sports participation at colleges and universities, which\nmainly entail team sports; intramural participation is a superior measure of sports interest\nthan intercollegiate participation because intramurals do not involve external incentives\n(e.g., scholarships) or constraints on participation (e.g., quotas or cuts). This study found\nthat, for both co-ed and single-sex intramural competition, men participated about three\ntimes as frequently as women, and that this difference had been stable since at least the\nSocial roles and socialization\nWe have emphasized the finding that the sex difference in track participation has\nnot decreased since the late 1990s, despite continued convergence in social roles.\nNonetheless, our results can be fairly interpreted as partially supporting social structural\ntheory because, in both data sets, the sex difference decreased significantly, albeit\nStudy 2, our analyses were unable to specify the factors causing this difference although\nthe timing of change appears inconsistent with the idea that Title IX played a role.\nOther lines of evidence are also consistent with the social structural or socialization\nview of sports competitiveness yet do not demonstrate that socialization plays a causal role.\nFor example, many studies have shown that males and females have different sport-related\nexperiences, with, for instance, adolescent females experiencing greater pressure to eschew\nsports, especially stereotypically masculine ones (Blinde and Taub, 1992; Kane and\nsystematic comparison or experimental intervention has ever shown that sport-related\nexperience actually affects the development or expression of sports interest or\ncompetitiveness. Another line of evidence comes from developmental studies\ndemonstrating, for example, that parents' perceptions of their children's sports ability are\nassociated with the children's ability beliefs and their participation (Fredricks and Eccles,\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\n2005). Although this suggests that parents contribute to individual and sex differences in\nsports interest, correlations of this kind might be driven by the children's behavior\n(Fredricks and Eccles, 2005) or heritable genetic variation (Hur, McGue, and Iacono, 1996;\nLykken, Bouchard, McGue, and Tellegen, 1993).\nIn addition, the view that socialization explains all differences in sports interest or\ncompetitiveness is undermined by converging evidence implicating a role for prenatal\nandrogens (e.g., testosterone). Females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a disease\ncharacterized by heightened prenatal androgen exposure, are more likely than unaffected\nfemales to show strong interest in stereotypically masculine sports (Berenbaum and Snyder,\nto-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a putative marker of high prenatal testosterone, is associated\nwith greater athletic ability (reviewed in H\u00f6nekopp and Schuster, 2010) and participation in\ncompetitive sports (e.g., Giffin, Kennedy, Jones, and Barber, 2012; Manning and Taylor,\nmuch evidence indicates that exposure to prenatal androgens contributes to male-typical\nchildhood activity patterns (reviewed in Berenbaum and Beltz, 2011), and these activity\npatterns, in turn, predict adult sports interest (Cardoso, 2009; Giuliano, Popp, and Knight,\nIn sum, the results from Study 2 suggest a meaningful but constrained role for\nsocialization, and this interpretation is fully consistent with previous empirical research.\nCompatibility of social structural theory and evolutionary theory\nIn considering social structural theory in this article, we have exclusively focused\non its prediction that converging social roles will consistently decrease sex differences in\npreferences and motivations and also that this prediction is at odds with an evolutionary\napproach. Arguably, this unfairly represents social structural theory in two ways. First, its\ndevelopers take pains to show its compatibility with evolutionary theory (Wood and Eagly,\n2002, 2012). In particular, social structural theory explicitly acknowledges that sex\ndifferences in body size, strength, and childrearing capabilities are products of natural\nselection and that these sex differences (but not partly innate psychological predispositions)\nhave crucial implications for the efficient performance of many activities in human\nsocieties and thus the division of labor and social roles.2\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, in explaining how differing social roles\neventually produce sex differences in behavior, social structural theory specifies numerous\nmediating proximate mechanisms (e.g., social role beliefs, hormonal regulation, self-\nregulation to gender identities; Wood and Eagly, 2002, 2012). Thus, one might argue that\nsocial structural theory has not been challenged by Study 2's results because, although\nsocial roles changed in the U.S. during the study period, for unknown reasons, these\nchanges did not engage the crucial mediating mechanisms (which we did not assess). This\nWood and Eagly (2012; p. 66) acknowledge the possibility of partly innate psychological predispositions\nbased, for example, on prenatal androgenization of male fetuses. Nevertheless, they deny that the evidence for\nthese mechanisms is compelling and that these mechanisms contribute meaningful variation to behavioral sex\ndifferences.\nA stable sex difference in competitiveness\nargument warrants consideration, but it ultimately seems unconvincing. This is because\nproponents of social structural theory enthusiastically cite studies indicating links between\nsocial roles and behavioral sex differences as crucially supporting the theory (Wood and\nEagly, 2012). If such studies count in favor of social structural theory, then the stable sex\ndifference in masters track participation shown in Study 2 must count against it.\nConcluding remarks\nSocial structural theory has been enormously fruitful (Eagly and Wood, 1999;\nWood and Eagly, 2002, 2012). Nonetheless, our results are consistent with other studies\nindicating that, despite the importance of social roles and associated socialization\nprocesses, social structural theory cannot provide a comprehensive account of sex\ndifferences in preferences and motivations (e.g., Archer, 2009; Buss, 1989; Gangestad et\nmust explore the interactions between evolved dispositions and various environmental\nfactors, including social roles.\nIn addition, we suggest that future research should address temporal changes in sex\ndifferences in sports interest and competitiveness in the U.S. using other measures and\naddressing other sports. Similarly, these issues should be investigated with cross-societal\nFinally, future research should address the extent to which sex differences in sports\ninterest and competitiveness relate to sex differences in other kinds of preferences and\nmotivations, such as risk-taking. In pursuing this research, we hope that others will follow\nour lead in attempting to measure behaviorally expressed preferences. We have shown that\nparticipation in voluntary physical activity is one promising area. However, there are likely\nmany others, including television viewing preferences and internet searches (Ogas and\nGaddam, 2012). Ideally, complementary methodologies can be used, and these should\nultimately permit the most compelling conclusions.\n"
