    "abstract": "Abstract\nIt has been an accepted scientific fact in physics for almost 100 years that time speeds up and slows down for an observer\nbased on factors--such as motion and gravity--that affect space. Yet this fact, drawn from the theory of relativity, has not\nbeen widely integrated into the study of the psychology of time. The present article helps to fill in this gap between physics\nand psychology by reviewing evidence concerning what a psychological spacetime processor--one that accounted for the\ntheory of relativity's empirically validated predictions of the compensatory relationship between time and space--would\nlook like. This model of the spacetime processor suggests that humans should have a psychological mechanism for slowing\ntime down as motion speeds up, a prediction that already has widespread research support. We also discuss several novel\nhypotheses directly suggested by the spacetime model and a set of related speculations that emerge when considering\nspacetime (some of which have already received empirical support). Finally, we compare and contrast three very different\npotential reasons why we might have developed a spacetime processor in the first place. We conclude that the spacetime\nmodel shows promise for organizing existing data on time perception and generating novel hypotheses for researchers to\npursue. Considering how humans might process spacetime helps reduce the existing gap between our understanding of\nphysics and our understanding of human psychology.\n",

This isn't surprising; one is hard pressed to find the\nsurvival advantage offered by a solid grasp of relativity.\nNewton's flawed conceptions of absolute space and absolute\ntime work wonderfully well at the slow speeds and moderate\ngravity we encounter in daily life, so our senses are under no\nevolutionary pressure to develop relativistic acumen.\nThe intimately woven bond between space and time--a\nrelationship so entrenched that it is referred to by physi-\ncists as a single entity called spacetime--has been an\naccepted scientific fact for generations of scientists.\nRepeated tests have confirmed empirically that time is not\nthe static entity that Newton imagined it to be; rather, in\nline with the theory of relativity, motion and gravity not\nonly affect space but also simultaneously affect time. Time\nin reality slows up and slows down for each observer based\non their movement through spatial dimensions in highly\npredictable ways (see, for example, Greene, 2004; Penrose,\nYet, in spite of this long-accepted fact in physics, the\nnotion of spacetime has received curiously little attention\nfrom psychologists studying time perception. We suspect\nthat this is very likely because most academics share promi-\nnent physicist Brian Greene's (2004) assessment--illus-\ntrated in the above quote--of the relationship between\nactual spacetime and our perception of spacetime. That\nassessment could be summarized as follows: Who needs it?\nAfter all, if the added predictive \"everyday\" value of space-\ntime perception is so small that it conveys no survival\nadvantage at all, then why would we have ever developed a\nmechanism to account for it? And if we would not have ever\ndeveloped such a mechanism, why bother thinking about the\nrelationship between our psychological functioning and\nspacetime in the first place?\n1University of Montana, Missoula, USA\n2Syracuse University, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLucian Gideon Conway III, University of Montana, 143 Skaggs, Missoula,\nEmail: luke.conway@umontana.edu\nPsychological Spacetime: Implications of\nRelativity Theory for Time Perception\nLucian Gideon Conway III1, Meredith A. Repke1,\nand Shannon C. Houck2\n Keywords\ntime perception, spacetime, physics, relativity theory\n2 SAGE Open\nWhy Should Psychology Researchers\nCare About Psychological Spacetime?\nThe sentiment is understandable. Yet we nonetheless believe\nthat there are at least two separate reasons to care about psy-\nchological spacetime. First, available evidence suggests that\nthe psychology of time and the psychology of space are in\nreality intimately bound up; and yet this fact is rarely tied to\nthe physical relationship between time and space. For exam-\nple, positron emission tomography (PET) and functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) studies suggest that\ntime perception and motion perception systems have quite a\nbit of direct overlap in shared biological space in the brain\nDoherty, Rao, Mesulam, & Nobre, 2005; Griffin & Nobre,\net al., 2005). Similar work reveals that localized hemispheric\ndeficits in space perceptions show corresponding deficits in\ntime perception, further suggesting that \"representations of\nspace and time share neural underpinnings\" (Saj, Fuhrman, &\nBuonomano, 2004). Although this overlap does not mean we\nhave a spacetime processor in line with relativity theory, it is\nat least consistent with the notion that space and time are per-\nhaps more intricately bound up in human psychology than a\nNewtonian processor might expect. Thus, it is worth more\nfully conceptually and empirically exploring the nature of this\noverlap, and the actual operation of space and time in physics\nis one potential guiding model to aid our understanding.\nSecond, we have at times in history underestimated the\nhuman capacity for sensing and assimilating information\nfrom the environment. For example, 100 years ago, few\nwould have predicted the profound ability of the human\npsyche to sense, interpret, and assimilate information pre-\nsented below the level of conscious awareness, or the degree\nthat human psychology occurs beyond our explicit knowl-\nedge or consent. Yet, today, such unconscious and implicit\neffects are accepted scientific fact (see, for example, Bargh\nKouider, de Gardelle, Dehaene, Dupoux, & Pallier, 2010;\nProulx & Heine, 2008). For example, research demonstrates\nthat one can implicitly prime stereotypical schemas and alter\nsubsequent behavior in ways consistent with the stereo-\ntype--such as slowing down persons' walking speed by\npriming words related to \"old\"--without persons being con-\nsciously aware that the process is happening (see Bargh &\nAlthough our species has only recently begun to articulate\nthe concepts of spacetime, it seems nearly certain that physi-\ncal spacetime has existed in its present integrative form\nthroughout human history. As such, any evolutionary pro-\ncesses1 acting upon our species would have acted in the con-\nstant presence of such spacetime as a certain reality, and thus\nit is perhaps premature to dismiss out of hand the possibility\nthat we do have some mechanisms that aid us in the\nintegrative perception of spacetime. And, as we shall see\nbelow, some research suggests that we may indeed have\nspacetime-like mechanisms for perceiving the intimate, rela-\ntivistic relation between space and time.\nThe implications of understanding the psychological\noverlap between space and time are vast. To the degree that\nhumans do possess spacetime-like processors, understanding\nthose mechanisms could contribute a great deal to our funda-\nmental understanding of how humans process time. The\nlargely untested set of hypotheses generated by the new pro-\nposed model could importantly alter our understanding of\nthe psychology of time.\nThis is no small matter: The psychological processing of\ntime has multiple practical implications for human emotion,\nlifesatisfaction,andmentalhealth(e.g.,Carstensen,Isaacowitz,\npeople process time is altered by space and motion (as we dis-\ncuss below), then interventions that use time as a mechanism\nfor improving life quality could be potentially improved by\nincluding considerations of space and motion.\nThe Present Article\nThe purpose of the present article is to address this gap\nbetween physical spacetime and the psychology of time. Our\nprimary method to accomplish this goal is to consider what a\nspacetime processor--one that processed spacetime in line\nwith relativity theory--would look like if humans possessed\nit. As we discuss below, our model does not (necessarily)\npredict that physical spacetime and psychological spacetime\ndirectly overlap in one-to-one correspondence. It rather sug-\ngests larger directional principles concerning how we would\nprocess the relationship between space and time.\nTo illustrate our model, we discuss a set of predictions\nthat can be made, when considering physical spacetime,\nabout how people might perceive time and space. This\nincludes a substantial research literature supporting one of\nthe key predictions from our newly conceptualized psycho-\nlogical spacetime model, as well as additional novel hypoth-\neses that have yet to be tested. We then discuss a set of related\nspeculations that emerge when considering spacetime.\nFinally, we compare and contrast three very different poten-\ntial reasons why we might have developed a spacetime pro-\ncessor in the first place.\nThe Backstory Sketch of a Spacetime\nProcessor\nThe theory of relativity suggests that movements through\ntime and space are compensatory, so that movement through\nspace affects movement through time and vice versa. This\nConway et al. 3\nmeans that if we perceived spacetime in line with relativity,\nwe would have mechanisms that would in some way corre-\nspond to this interaction between time and space. It further\nsuggests that all things that \"bend\" space or alter motion--\nsuch as gravity--would also affect time perception. Below,\nwe discuss what we might expect to find in a human proces-\nsor if, in fact, there were mechanisms for processing space-\ntime in this manner. Before doing so, however, it is necessary\nto first discuss, writ large, how human processes typically\ninterface with the real world.\nHuman Processing Involves Exaggerated\nComparative Perceptions\nNo human processing mechanism interfaces with physical\nreality by producing a one-to-one correspondence with that\nreality. We do not \"copy\" reality into our mind; it is always\na reconstructive process. For example, from the moment\nlight photons hit the eye, the visual system is reconstruct-\ning, altering, transmuting, and adapting the reality \"out\nthere\" into an image \"in here\" (see, for example, Weiten,\n2013). As a result, it would be unrealistic to expect that a\nhuman psychological mechanism would exist that might\nproduce an exact replication of spacetime in the human\nmind. Rather, if we look across known human processing\nmechanisms, what we see instead are a series of exaggera-\ntions and perceptual heuristics that roughly correspond,\nmost of the time, to something \"out there.\" So, for example,\nour mechanisms for distinguishing objects in our environ-\nment involve a series of processes that essentially exagger-\nate differences between features in our visual world: We\nhave systems that visually enhance edges, systems that\noveremphasize clustering of like stimuli, and systems that\nfinish apparently unfinished familiar objects (see, for\nThese perceptions do not exist in a vacuum and, as a\nresult, are often as responsive to relative changes on a par-\nticular variable as to the absolute level of that variable (see\nCialdini, 2001). A common example involves judgments of\ntemperature--A 70-degree room will feel hot if someone\nenters it from a 40-degree environment, but the same\n70-degree room will feel cold if a person enters it from a\n100-degree environment. This simple example illustrates\nthat we often process changes in the general direction (e.g.,\nhot to cold, cold to hot) of variables as much as we process\nthe absolute level of those variables.\nAs a result of this general tendency to have exaggerated\ncomparative perceptual mechanisms, what we might expect\nto find in terms of our psychological interface with space-\ntime is not a one-to-one measurement of spacetime, but\nrather a set of similarly exaggerated mechanisms for perceiv-\ning the general direction of the relationship between the\nvariables involved in spacetime alterations. This looser per-\nspective suggests a set of hypotheses (described in detail\nlater in this article) about how we ought to perceive the\ngeneral relationship between space and time as a corollary to\ntheir actual physical relationship.\nHuman Processing Involves Perceptions of\nObservable Markers\nTime perception is highly malleable (see, for example,\nprocessing most typically involves perceptions of observable\nmarkers of objective reality and not the underlying reality\nitself. For example, evolutionary psychology theories of\nmate selection emphasize that we do not have a direct line to\nthe \"fertility\" of a particular mate; rather, there are markers\nthat themselves are correlated with fertility (e.g., markers of\nage, beauty, health), and it is those markers that we use (e.g.,\nBuss & Schmitt, 2011). Similarly, there are markers of\nwhether or not someone is related to us (Park, Schaller, &\nVan Vugt, 2008), or whether or not someone has a disease\nthat might harm us (Park, Schaller, & Crandall, 2007). These\nmarkers are not direct lines to kinship or disease; they are\nrather observable indicators that are correlated with those\nfactors.\nWhen we are thinking of how we might process space-\ntime, it is likely that we have mechanisms that note observ-\nable markers in our world that alter time perception, much in\nthe same way we might assume that someone with a sym-\nmetrical face is more likely to be fertile. This would mean\nthat, as in the case of fertility markers, the markers will\nsometimes not correspond to reality in a given instance.\nMuch evolutionary psychology suggests that we have psy-\nchological modules that operate in this manner (e.g., Buss &\nAs a result, it is not necessarily the case that we have to be\nexperiencing spacetime alterations ourselves to show the\neffect of the markers. As an example, consider that if we\nhave a heuristic that suggests \"darkness = exaggerate danger-\nrelated traits,\" we do not need to feel \"in danger\" for the\nheuristic to cause the expected outcome (e.g., Schaller, Park,\n& Mueller, 2003). Similarly, many of the hypotheses sug-\ngested by spacetime may not require people to actually expe-\nrience spacetime alterations; but rather, people may have\ncorresponding implicit mechanisms to alter their time per-\nceptions based on observable markers that are generally\nassociated with spacetime changes.\nWhat Would a Spacetime Processor\nLook Like?\nHaving painted a sketch in broad brushstrokes of how we\nmight expect a psychological spacetime processor to inter-\nface with the real world, we now turn our attention to the\nfeatures a spacetime processor should possess. To do so, we\nlay out some specific psychological factors we would expect\na time perception processor to operate on if it corresponded\n4 SAGE Open\nin some way to the known physical relation of space and\ntime. Each factor suggests some specific hypotheses relevant\nto human time perception. In perhaps the most salient\nhypothesis, data already exist that are consistent with the\nspacetime model; for the other hypotheses, no tests that we\nknow of have been performed.\nA Spacetime Processor Would Account for the\nCompensatory Interplay of Motion and Time:\nEvidence for the Spacetime Model\nOne of the most eye-opening predictions of relativity theory\nis that motion through space and motion through time are\ncompensatory: The more we travel through space, the less\nwe travel through time (see, for example, Greene, 2004;\nspeeds we normally travel at, this effect on time is not explic-\nitly noticeable; but it is occurring just the same. So if a space-\ntime processor existed, it would have some kind of\nexaggerated mechanism for accounting for this interaction.\nThis suggests a straightforward hypothesis for the spacetime\nprocessor: That perceptions of motion ought to make time\npsychologically slow down. Operationally, this means that\nmotion ought to increase estimates of duration (e.g., Cohen,\n1931), because if time appears to move slower to Observer A\nthan Observer B, Observer A will report that more time has\npassed in the same interval.\nWhen we go to the literature on time perception, this is--\nwith a couple of exceptions (Chen, Pizzolato, & Cesari, 2013;\nOrgs, Bestmann, Schuur, & Haggard, 2011)--exactly what sci-\nentists have found. Despite the fact that there is a widespread\nassumption that our time perception mechanisms are funda-\nmentally Newtonian, numerous studies across multiple para-\ndigms have shown that as people perceive motion, time slows\n& Miura, 2012). We next provide a summary of this evidence.\nIndeed, a long history of research on the well-established\nkappa effect is consistent with this time-stretching effect of\nSarrazin et al., 2004). The kappa effect occurs when partici-\npants overestimate the amount of time occurring between\ntwo repeated stimuli as the physical space between the stim-\nuli becomes larger. The kappa effect thus involves the depen-\ndence of temporal judgments on the spatial context; the\neffect is often directly tied to the phenomenological percep-\ntion of velocity or motion (see, for example, Jones & Huang,\ntheory--it becomes larger as stimuli move more quickly\nAdditional studies from different paradigms have investi-\ngated how the presence of action for a stimulus affects time\nduration estimates. For example, Yamamoto and Miura\n(2012) found that after viewing an image of a person run-\nning, participants perceived time to be lengthened--that is,\nthey perceived the presentation duration to be longer--com-\npared with participants who viewed an image devoid of\naction. Brown (1995) also found that stimulus motion length-\nened perceived duration, and further showed that higher\nvelocity stimuli led to increasingly lengthened estimates of\nperceived time, relative to lower velocity stimuli.\nOther work paints a similar picture. Tayama (2006) con-\ncluded that increased velocity of motion led to increased esti-\nmates of time elapsed. Matthews (2011) investigated the role\nof velocity by testing whether the time-lengthening effect\nwas equal for objects in constant motion, accelerating\nobjects, and decelerating objects. Viewing objects in con-\nstant motion led to the greatest degree of perceived time\nlengthening. Furthermore, Matthews found that when par-\nticipants viewed an accelerating object, followed by a sta-\ntionary object, the result was a perceived lengthening of the\nduration of the stationary object.\nOther studies have explored the effect of the perception of\nmotion by putting participants themselves into motion.\nConsistent with the spacetime model, Kroger-Costa et al.\n(2013) found that when a participant is in motion, perception\nof stimuli duration is lengthened. Decades earlier, Brehmer\n(1970) found that participants riding in faster moving cars\nmade longer estimates of duration than those in slower mov-\ning cars.\nIn summary, although there exists a small amount of evi-\ndence that might be construed as inconsistent with the space-\noverwhelming array of evidence from multiple paradigms is\nconsistent with a model suggesting that humans have mecha-\nnisms for processing spacetime in the general direction of\nrelativity theory's predictions.\nNovel Predictions of the Spacetime Processor\nAll good theoretical perspectives are first and foremost gen-\nerative (see, for example, Conway & Schaller, 2002). Thus,\nalthough it is interesting to note that one of the spacetime\nmodel's key predictions has received empirical validation--\nand it gives us a good reason to continue pursuing the\nmodel--it nonetheless is important to use the model to make\nfuture predictions that help us generate new knowledge.\nBelow, we illustrate three additional predictions made by the\nspacetime model that provide the potential to generate novel\nfindings.\nConway et al. 5\nNovel Prediction 1:A spacetime processor would account for the\nmagnification of time\u00admotion compensation across large dis-\ntances.Although much evidence supports that we have a\nmechanism that in some way accounts for relativity theory's\nprediction of the compensatory nature of motion and time, a\nrelated (and, in physics, an equally clear and demonstrable)\nprediction from relativity theory has received no attention at\nall in the time perception literature. Brian Greene (2004)\nillustrated by showing that if two observers were 10 billion\nlight years apart, relativity theory shows that Observer A\nmoving a paltry 10 miles an hour toward Observer B would\ncause Observer A to move 150 years into the future of\nObserver B! Thus, relativity theory directly shows that the\neffect of relative motion on time perception ought to be\ngreater the farther the two objects in question are from each\nother. Although, like all the other spacetime effects observed\nhere, this magnification effect of distance in space is negli-\ngible at the small distances we typically travel in, a space-\ntime processor might nonetheless have an exaggerated\nmechanism to track it.\nThis suggests a series of testable hypotheses. For example,\none could run typical experiments showing the motion\u00adtime\nperception link while systematically varying the distances\nbetween perceiver and perceived object. Furthermore, one\ncan run experiments that systematically vary the distance (or\nperceived distance) between two objects and their relative\nmotion to each other--Based on the spacetime model, we\nwould predict that as perceived distance increased, the\nstrength of the motion\u00adtime perception relationship would\nincrease as well.\nNovel Prediction 2:A spacetime processor would account for the\ncompensatory interplay of gravity and time.Relativity shows\nthat because gravity bends space, it also bends time. As a\nresult, for objects that are closer to large masses (where grav-\nitational pull would be more immediately present), time\nmoves slower than for objects farther from those masses\nprediction made by relativity theory, then, is that time moves\nslower on the earth at low altitudes than at high altitudes,\nbecause low altitudes experience more \"pull\" from the\nearth's gravity. And in fact, numerous studies using high-\npowered, precise atomic clocks have confirmed this effect--\nOne such study showed that time ran faster for clocks that\ndiffered in altitude by only 33 inches (Chou, Hume, Rosen-\nband, & Wineland, 2010). Indeed, the effect is important\nenough that if satellite global positioning system (GPS) did\nnot account for it, their predictions would sometimes be off\nby several miles (Hawking, 1996; Hawking & Mlodinow,\nIf we have mechanisms for processing time in line with\nrelativity theory, two related psychological hypotheses are\nsuggested by the effect of gravity on time (neither of which\nhas received direct empirical testing to our knowledge).\nFirst, and more local to our typical experience, is this: We\nshould perceive time as moving more quickly as we perceive\nincreases in altitude. Objects farther from the earth are higher\nup, and relativity theory suggests (and empirical observa-\ntions confirm) that time should move faster at higher alti-\ntudes. Thus, as a person perceives increases in altitude, time\nshould psychologically speed up for the spacetime processor.\nSecond, and more generally, we should perceive time as\nmoving more slowly when we perceive that a target is close\nto a mass that is large on a cosmic scale. Thus, if we perceive\nthat a target is very close to a mass large enough to affect\ngravity substantially (e.g., an astronaut is close to the sun vs.\nfar away), our spacetime model predicts that time would be\ndilated for that target.\nNovel Prediction 3: A spacetime processor would recognize that\nother people's experiences of time are different from its own.The\nthoughtful observer may have noticed that, up to this point,\nwe have conflated the effects of observing alterations that\nwould affect other people's conception of time and observing\nalterations that would affect our own conception of time.\nThat is in part because perceptual heuristics and primes often\nfunction this way--They often function like direct links tap-\nping into perception mechanisms, and those links sometimes\nwork independent of context. For example, a lot of work on\npriming shows that subtle exposure to words along specified\ndimensions directly alters subsequent behavior, even when it\nmakes no conceptual sense based on the context, such as\nwhen people walk more slowly after they are exposed to\nwords related to being \"old\" (for a summary, see Bargh &\nChartrand, 1999). In the same way, it is entirely possible that\nour spacetime mechanisms might be \"primed\" by images\neven in circumstances where they would not normally make\ndirect sense, and as such might alter our time perception in\nthe same way that priming \"old\" alters walking speed. Thus,\neven if we see other people in motion, or other people close\nto large gravitational objects, we might show effects of\nspacetime processing.\nOn the contrary, one of the more important suggestions of\nrelativity theory is that each observer's sense of time will\ndiffer from every other observer's sense, based on the prin-\nciples outlined above. Although spacetime might potentially\nsuggest a number of more speculative hypotheses in this\nregard--an issue we return to in a later section--one of the\nmore straightforward things we might expect from a space-\ntime processor is that it would account for the fact that other\npeople's senses of time might not always be the same as our\nown. For example, if (a) we have a mechanism for recogniz-\ning that objects at different altitudes move through time at\ndifferent speeds, and (b) Person A recognizes that she is cur-\nrently at a different altitude from Person B, it follows that (c)\nPerson A would recognize that she and Person B are cur-\nrently moving through time at different speeds.\nGeneral evidence suggests that we adjust for the fact that\ntime \"slows down\" and \"speeds up\" across contexts (e.g.,\n6 SAGE Open\ntortions (e.g., Lamotte, Izaute, Droit-Volet, 2012). For exam-\nple, participants in one study (Conway, 2004) showed time\nestimates that converged with those of other group members\nif they worked with them on a face-to-face task, demonstrat-\ning that time perceptions are implicitly malleable at a funda-\nmental level. As a result of this malleability, it is reasonable\nto assume that we are aware that time would subjectively\nmove differently for different people based on circumstances.\nHowever, none of that evidence to our knowledge tests the\nhypothesis that we directly account for spacetime effects\nwhen considering other people's movement through time.\nOne simple way to test this would be to show pictures/videos\nof other persons in various conditions where spacetime\neffects are manipulated, and then ask people to either (a) esti-\nmate how much time they think has passed for themselves, or\n(b) estimate how much time do they think has passed for that\nperson in the picture/video. To the degree that spacetime pro-\ncessing effects are larger for participants' time estimates for\nthe other people who (in those conditions) would actually be\nexperiencing the effects, this would suggest that we have a\nmechanism to directly account for the differential effects of\nspacetime on different targets.\nThus, although we might expect effects of perceived\nmotion and gravity to some degree regardless of context and\nactor, the spacetime model would expect those effects to be\nlarger when explicitly considering the person(s) to whom the\neffects should directly affect.\nAdditional Implications of Relativity:\nSpeculations Raised by Considering\nSpacetime\nWe have thus far discussed hypotheses that follow in a\nstraightforward fashion from the theory of relativity as classi-\ncally understood. This generally involves taking empirically\nvalidated or theoretically understood findings from the last\n100 years of physics--things on which almost all physicists\nwould agree--and extrapolating in a direct way what we\nmight expect a spacetime processor to look like in the human\nspecies. While of course, as we have emphasized, no psycho-\nlogical interface with reality is perfectly straightforward,\nthese hypotheses nonetheless mostly follow fairly directly\nfrom consensually agreed-upon implications of classical\nphysics. Few physicists would disagree that time slows down\nas motion speeds up, that the time dilation effect of motion is\nlarger as objects are farther apart, that time slows down near\nobjects with large mass, and that different observers often\ntravel through time at different speeds. The psychological\nspacetime implications we have drawn thus far correspond\nclosely to those known facts drawn from relativity theory.\nHowever, sometimes a theoretical perspective can be use-\nful not only for the direct hypotheses it offers but also for the\nspeculations and questions it inspires. For example, an evo-\nlutionary perspective of cultural transmission has not only\ngenerated specific hypotheses, it has also inspired research-\ners to consider questions about how culture grows that might\nnot have even been asked otherwise (see, for example,\nSchaller, Conway, & Tanchuk, 2002). Here, we briefly lay\nout three potential areas of research that are inspired by a\nconsideration of spacetime. These do not directly follow\nfrom classic relativity theory, yet they emerge largely because\nof a consideration of the issues involved with the theory. If\nrelativity theory is a pebble dropped in a pond, these specula-\ntions are the outward psychological ripples that emerge from\nthat pebble.\nA Spacetime Processor May Account for the\nMalleability of Time's Arrow: Precognition\nAlthough we generally perceive that time only moves in one\ndirection (from the \"past\" to the \"future\"), classic relativity\ntheory shows that there is no reason it cannot move both for-\nward and backward. Unlike in Newtonian physics, relativity\ntheory suggests that space and time are one whole self-con-\ntained entity, lumped together as a kind of \"frozen river.\"\nThis means that, in principle, spacetime implies that time\ncould be bidirectional. In the words of Sheehan (2006), both\nrelativity theory and quantum physics \"formally and equally\nadmit time-forward and time-reversed solutions . . . it seems\nuntenable to assert that time-reverse causation (retrocausa-\ntion) cannot occur, even though it temporarily runs counter\nto the macroscopic arrow of time\" (p. vii).\nFrom a psychological point of view, this asymmetry\npotentially opens the door for things in the future to affect\nthings in the present. As such, if we had a spacetime proces-\nsor that accounted for this fact, it would be psychologically\npossible that things in the future might influence what is psy-\nchologically happening right now, in the same way that\nthings in the past influence what is happening right now. This\nwould suggest that the existence of what are sometimes\ncalled \"psi\" phenomena may actually be rooted in both phys-\nical and psychological science.\nAnd indeed, recent evidence for precognition offers some\nreason to believe that this idea of relativity theory might hold\nsome weight. Precognition refers to an anticipatory cogni-\ntive or affective awareness, conscious or unconscious, of\nfuture events. Operationally, it is the influence of future stim-\nuli on one's present psychological processes. Recent experi-\nmental research has demonstrated precognitive effects\nrelevant to reinforcement, priming, habituation, and mem-\nory, such that effects operate \"backwards in time\" (Bem,\nage of nine studies published in the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology, found that participants were more\nlikely to respond in ways that were later reinforced, when\nConway et al. 7\nboth the random assignment of reinforcement and the rein-\nforcement itself occurred after the responses in question\nwere already made. In other words, Bem showed that what is\nabout to happen to participants influenced their responses\nbefore it happened to them. This surprising finding suggests\nthat current responses were influenced by future reinforce-\nment of those responses, reinforcement for which partici-\npants would ostensibly be unaware because it had not\n\"happened\" yet. In other, similar studies, participants' judg-\nments were influenced by primes that occurred after their\njudgments were reported, and participants performed better\non a recall test for words that were rehearsed after the recall\ntest was completed.\nThese findings have been met with a fair amount of criti-\ncal skepticism, in part because results have been inconsis-\ntently replicable (e.g., see Galak, LeBoeuf, Nelson, Leif, &\nSimmons, 2012), and more frequently due to both a lack of\ntheoretical explanation and a limited understanding of the\npotential underlying mechanism(s) of precognitive effects\n(Bem, 2011). Although we also share a skeptical view in part\nfor these same reasons, it is worth noting that data from a\nrecent meta-analysis of 90 experiments attempting to repli-\ncate precognitive effects--using either exact or modified\nmethods outlined in Bem (2011)--provide support overall\nfor the existence of precognition (Bem et al., 2014; for a\nreview of other meta-analytic evidence, see Tressoldi et al.,\nAlthough neither relativity theory nor modern quantum\nphysics directly predicts the specific mechanisms associated\nwith existing precognition effects, classic spacetime theory\nat the very least offers a theoretical starting point whereby\nthe future might psychologically affect the present. As Bem\net al. (2014) discussed, physicists accept that time is both\nsymmetric and asymmetric; it may be that precognition and\nphysics coincide in ways we do not yet understand. As such,\nprecognition fits within the larger framework of relativity\ntheory by suggesting that the direction of time is somewhat\nmalleable at least some of the time.\nA Spacetime Processor May Have Time Closely\nLinked to Entropy\nOf course, although relativity theory allows for the possibil-\nity of temporal causality to be reversed, this fact raises a bit\nof a psychological puzzle: Why do we explicitly perceive\ntime moving in only one direction (called \"time's arrow\")?\nThis puzzle only emerges because of relativity's conception\nof spacetime; in a commonsense Newtonian framework, we\nexpect time to only move in one direction. Relativity theory\nthus creates the puzzle of time's arrow.\nSo what does modern physics say about the question of\ntime's arrow? If time can be bidirectional, why do we per-\nceive it to move in only one direction? The most common\nassumption of modern physics is that this emerges because\ntime and entropy are closely linked. Brian Greene (2004)\nsummed this up:\n[T]he only convincing framework we found for explaining\ntime's arrow was that the early universe had extremely high\norder, that is extremely low entropy, which set the stage for a\nfuture in which entropy got ever larger. (p. 314)\nThis quote illustrates a commonly accepted physical fact\nabout spacetime: That one the most fundamental aspects of\nour experience of time--namely, that it only moves in one\ndirection--is intricately bound to entropy (see also Hawking,\nto high entropy: If we see a picture of a whole egg and then a\npicture of the same egg smashed to bits on the floor, we\nassume that the high-entropy smashed egg came after the\nlow-entropy whole egg.\nAlthough this tie seems fundamental, no research to our\nknowledge has directly explored this entropy\u00adtime percep-\ntion connection. A consideration of this relationship suggests\nthat, if we have some mechanism that is sensitive to the\nentropy\u00adtime relationship, our time perception might be dra-\nmatically affected by \"reversing\" entropy as it is presented in\nlinear time. So by playing video clips that go from high\nentropy to low entropy (instead of the reverse)--for exam-\nple, if one played a clip of billiard balls all \"re-assembling\"\ninto their typical beginning state on the pool table, rather\nthan the balls moving from that state to becoming more scat-\ntered--one might expect that our time perception mecha-\nnisms would not function in their normal way. In particular,\nthis could mean that that time slows down because we asso-\nciate high entropy with the \"end\" state and, if it is instead at\nthe beginning, are more likely to infer that time must be\nmoving more slowly.\nA Spacetime Processor May Have Shared Time\nPerception Mechanisms\nWe earlier outlined a straightforward prediction of the space-\ntime model pertaining to others' time perception mecha-\nnisms--namely, that a spacetime processor would account\nfor the fact that other persons' time clocks are different from\nours in ways conforming to classical relativity theory.\nHowever, it is worth noting that, to the degree that we do\naccount for this, it may also have other implications for\nhuman psychology. Here, we speculate briefly on what those\nmay be.\nHumans are inherently social beings. We have a funda-\nmental desire to belong; we do not want to be permanently\nalone or outcast; we live by being together (see, for example,\nBaumeister & Leary, 1995; Conway, Houck, & Gornick,\n2014). As a result, it is likely the case that, although we may\nimplicitly account for the fact that other people's time moves\ndifferently from ours, we do not want to be on a different\n8 SAGE Open\ntime continuum than they are. The thought that we are not\nmoving \"together\" on such a fundamentally basic dimension\nas time may feel undesirable. This suggests a set of related\nhypotheses.\nOne hypothesis is that we may have a mechanism for\nmentally \"synchronizing\" our perceptions of time with oth-\ners, so that we feel like we are, in fact, on the same time\nplane as they are. And indeed, some evidence suggests that\nwe do have just such an implicit mechanism. In one study\n(Conway, 2004), participants worked on a task either side-\nby-side (no interaction) or face-to-face (such that they inter-\nacted with others). Participants did not talk about time in any\nsession, yet face-to-face participants showed a tendency to\nconverge in their perceptions of time's passage, so that their\nperceptions of time became more like those of their fellow\ngroup members (an effect that did not occur in the side-by-\nside control conditions and was not accounted for by partici-\npants' mood). This research suggests that people seem to\nhave an independent mechanism to implicitly \"share\" the\ntime perceptions of others they interact with, even when they\nnever talk about that perception directly. This and other find-\nings at the cultural level that suggest cultures have a shared\nsense of \"pace of life\" (Conway, Ryder, Tweed, & Sokol,\nin fact, we do implicitly recognize that others have different\ntime clocks than we do, we may have a compensatory mech-\nanism to reestablish that we belong with them, in the same\nway that our implicit existential fear of death leads us to have\ncompensatory motivational \"buffers\" (e.g., Rosenblatt et al.,\nA second, related set of hypotheses involves the potential\npsychological unease caused by feeling one is separate from\nothers on the time dimension. In particular, showing others in\nsituations where they would be experiencing different time\nspeeds than the target according to relativity theory (e.g.,\nseeing others in higher altitudes than we are or in a motion\nstate that we are not currently experiencing) may cause us to\nexhibit signs of wanting to \"reconnect\" with the people\naround us as a compensatory mechanism. This may involve\na heightened effect size for reestablishing shared time (either\nimplicitly or by explicit efforts), or more general efforts to\n\"fit in\" or feel like one belongs.\nWhere Would a Spacetime Processing\nMechanism Come From?\nSo far, we have discussed what a potential mechanism for\nprocessing spacetime might look like if humans had such a\nmechanism. We have shown that, in addition to there being\nreason to believe that space and time are intimately bound in\nbiological substrate in the human brain, there is further\nalready substantial evidence for one of the key predictions of\nthe psychological spacetime model. In addition, there is at\nleast some evidence for two of the speculative hypotheses\ndrawn from the spacetime model.\nHowever, to this point we have spoken loosely of the\nspacetime processor without consideration of where or how\nwe might have acquired it. Below, we explore three separate\nreasons why we might process temporal information in a\nmanner consistent with relativity theory: direct adaptations,\nanalogical overlap, and cultural learning.\nAs Direct Adaptations\nIt is possible that psychological mechanisms evolved as\ndirect adaptations to spacetime itself. But is this a legitimate\npossibility? Although, on the surface, we agree with Brian\nGreene's opening assessment that there is no necessary sur-\nvival benefit to perceiving spacetime effects, there are none-\ntheless good reasons for being skeptical of arguments based\non our capacity to perceive the survival value of a psycho-\nlogical mechanism in the distant past (see, for example,\nknow or understand the context in which humans emerged,\nand the relationship of genetics to survival is immensely\ncomplex; as a result, it might be premature to assume that a\nset of mechanisms to more completely assess the nature of\nspacetime would have conveyed no survival value to its\nholders.\nEqually as importantly, no evolutionary theory suggests\nthat only traits are related to survival last--Many of our\nexisting traits appear to be either \"spandrels\" or \"noise\" that\nserve no necessary survival function (see, for example, Buss,\nHaselton, Shackelford, Bleske, & Wakefield, 1998; Conway,\nbone color, which is likely just an offshoot (a \"spandrel\") of\nother factors relevant to bone density and structure that affect\nsurvival--In other words, bone color itself is simply irrele-\nvant to survival (see, for example, Buss et al., 1998). Many\nof our traits are doubtless like that, and it is possible that we\nmight have developed a mechanism for perceiving spacetime\nthat conveyed no survival value, but it survived as a trait\nbecause it did not inhibit gene survival.\nRelatedly, and more importantly, is the fact that non-\nNewtonian spacetime effects would seem on the surface to\nbe so small that they would appear to be outside of the\nhuman capacity to perceive. As an analog, humans do not\nappear to have the capacity to see most ultraviolet radiation\nor to hear sound waves beyond 50,000 Hz. It is perhaps\ntherefore useless to talk about the \"interface\" of our percep-\ntion mechanisms with those physical phenomena, because\nwe do not seem to have them at all. So given that the effects\nof spacetime beyond Newtonian physics would be negligi-\nble (often measured in fractions of a nanosecond), it seems\nunlikely at first blush that we would perceive them at all.\nThe distance between the proposed \"exaggerated\" mecha-\nnisms for human psychology and the reality of spacetime\neffects in physics seems too great. It is thus a plausible\nhypothesis that we simply do not have a fine-grained enough\ntemporal mechanism for detecting the effects of spacetime\nConway et al. 9\nat really small units of time, and the psychological space-\ntime effects that exist occur for different reasons (we explore\ntwo other possibilities below).\nHowever, it is also worth noting that a glance at the his-\ntory of research on time perception suggests a pattern of\ndemonstrating that we can perceive time in progressively\nsmaller and smaller units. Based on what we currently know\nabout temporal-visual-related systems, we can detect stimuli\nat least on scales of a few dozen milliseconds (Clifford,\nsee Eagleman et al., 2005, for a review; see also Eagleman,\nAlthough this is nowhere near the speeds necessary to detect\nspacetime fluctuations in our current environment beyond\nNewtonian levels, as our ability to measure the human mind\nincreases, scientists are discovering faster and faster process-\ning and perception mechanisms. Given the fact that to our\nknowledge, no concerted scientific effort has been made to\ndiscover if such fine-grained levels of spacetime perception\nare possible, it may be premature to assume that such super-\nspeedy processing mechanisms do not exist; rather, it is pos-\nsible that we simply have not yet detected them.\nAs a Metaphorical Analog\nOf course, we too feel the same thing that Brian Greene\n(2004) and others have felt--that it seems unlikely that we\nhave any direct psychological adaptations to spacetime.\nHowever, even if that turned out to be true, there are still\nreasons to believe that we may have perceptual mechanisms\nthat would roughly correspond to relativity theory's predic-\ntions of the relation between space and time. Even when a\nspecific model does not directly apply in perfect correspon-\ndence to the observed phenomenon, it can still be beneficial\nas a rough metaphor (see, for example, Fredrickson, 2013).\nAs such, the consideration of spacetime might in that case\nstill serve as a useful metaphorical analog for how humans\nprocess time perception information.\nWe are not the first to make this suggestion: Others have\nnoted that relativity theory may serve as a useful loose meta-\nphor for understanding the relation of time and motion per-\nJones & Huang, 1982). Goldreich, for example, uses the rel-\nativity-inspired name time dilation to describe the stretching\nof time during motion--The name is explicitly chosen\nbecause of the rough conceptual overlap with relativity the-\nory. However, although these examples highlight that there is\nclearly empirical reason to believe in the overlap between\nphysical spacetime and psychological spacetime, to date\nresearchers have made little effort to fully explore this con-\nceptual overlap and what it means, or to explore potentially\nnew hypotheses and areas of research that might be opened\nup by a serious consideration of spacetime.\nGenerally speaking, the value of co-opting a process from\none physical or biological phenomenon to use as a metaphor\nfor helping explain another phenomenon has been seen\nacross multiple areas within psychology. So, for example,\nalthough human neural memory networks bear little struc-\ntural resemblance to traditional computers, computer-based\nmetaphors have led to great advances in our framing and\nunderstanding of memory (for a summary, see Solso,\nMacLin, & MacLin, 2007). Similarly, although cultural sys-\ntems do not operate under the same processes and constraints\nas biological evolution, nonetheless the Darwinistic evolu-\ntionary metaphor has served to inspire and aid a generation\nof new research ideas on how culture changes over time (see,\nfor example, Claidi\u00e8re, Scott-Phillips, & Sperber, 2014;\nOf course, the potential scientific value of pursuing any\nanalog is dependent on having reasons for suspecting that\nthe analog will reflect some underlying reality of the studied\nphenomenon. In this case, there are at least two potential\nsets of reasons why there might be overlap. The first set\ninvolves empirical considerations: We have already dis-\ncussed that space and time are clearly linked in the human\nbrain (see, for example, Eagleman et al., 2005) and that one\nof the key direct predictions of the spacetime model has\nreceived empirical support (e.g., Cohen et al., 1953; Jones &\nYamamoto & Miura, 2012). Thus, the early returns from the\nmodel are promising, offering a number of reasons to believe\nthat some of the other, as yet untested, hypotheses may be\nworth pursuing.\nSecond is a variant of the anthropic principle. This prin-\nciple argues that the things we discover about our universe\nmust in some way be compatible with our conscious process-\ning mechanisms (see, for example, Hawking, 1996). So, for\nexample, with respect to the analogical connection between\nhuman memory and computer memory, a view from the\nanthropic principle would consider that the human mind\nwould not have discovered the possibility of computer stor-\nage units if it bore no resemblance to the way we actually\nprocess information. Thus, although neurons are nothing like\nthe central processing units (CPUs) in computers, it is per-\nhaps unsurprising that computer memory systems and human\nmemory systems bear some phenomenological overlap.\nIndeed, it is likely the very reason that we made computer\nmemory systems the way they are--We would be highly\nunlikely to invent a memory system that was wildly discrep-\nant from our own.\nSimilarly, the anthropic principle suggests that it is pos-\nsible that we process information in a spacetime-like way for\nreasons that are independent entirely of the minutiae of\nspacetime itself, and yet it is that very fact that allowed us to\nultimately discover the more complicated nuances of space-\ntime to begin with. Although processing spacetime is not\ndirectly intuitively obvious to us, we nonetheless had the\ncapacity to uncover, observe, and understand the way time,\nmotion, gravity, and space all interact. Although this in no\nway means that we have implicit mechanisms to process\nspacetime in line with relativity theory, it does at least mean\nthat the ability to understand spacetime was latent within the\nhuman species. It is therefore possible that this latent pro-\ncessing ability in fact corresponds to implicit processing\nmechanisms. This is not a definitive argument for the space-\ntime model; but it does suggest a reason why we might have\nan analog spacetime mechanism even if it is not a direct\nadaptation. The causal arrow for the overlap may, in a sense,\ngo from our spacetime-like mechanisms to our discovery of\nspacetime, rather than the existence of spacetime causing us\nto develop such mechanisms as direct adaptations.\nAs a Product of Cultural Learning\nAn overarching knowledge structure may exist in human\nminds for multiple reasons. It may exist because it reflects\nsome underlying pan-cultural psychological reality, in the\nway that computer memory reflects aspects of human mem-\nory (e.g., Solso et al., 2007). It may also exist because it\noriginates in cultural learning, the way that knowledge struc-\ntures related to individualism and collectivism are largely\nlearned at the cultural level (e.g., Conway, Clements, &\nKitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, & Plaut, 2010;\nKitayama, Ishii, Imada, Takemura, & Ramaswamy, 2006).\nIt is thus possible that relativity theory influences time\nperception because it provides a conceptual cultural frame-\nwork for shaping reality (e.g., Conway et al., 2001; Conway\nframework itself has an impact on time perception. The\nhuman mind is incredibly malleable to such cultural influ-\nences, and as such, it is possible that people learn, for\nexample, about the time\u00admotion integration and compen-\nsate for it. If this were the case, the discovery of relativity\nitself--and subsequent adoption across cultures--would\nserve as a profound cultural framework for altering the per-\nception of time.\nIndeed, other researchers have suggested that time per-\nception is in part a cultural phenomenon (Conway, 2004;\ntainly plausible that relativity theory might overlap with time\nperception because it has become an accepted part of cultural\nknowledge and, as a result, influences time perception in the\nsame way other deeply accepted cultural folkways influence\nhuman psychology. If true, the cultural learning approach to\nthe spacetime metaphor suggests the important idea that as\nknowledge of relativity becomes more and more pervasive,\nits spread will correspondingly affect time perception in line\nwith relativity theory.\nDo the Potential Origins of a Spacetime Processor\nMatter?\nWe have briefly outlined three potential origins of a space-\ntime processor. But if we have a spacetime processor, would\nit matter why we acquired it? On the surface, it would seem\nthat all three explanations of why we acquired it would make\nthe same set of predictions.\nAnd that is true in some large sense. However, ultimately,\nas we gain more and more knowledge of how humans pro-\ncess temporal information, the three different proposed ori-\ngins would potentially make differing predictions. For\nexample, if we acquired the processor as a direct adaptation\nto real spacetime selection pressures, the predictions of the\nspacetime model should be more likely to continue to hold at\nincreasingly smaller units of time--because, in our local\npocket of the universe, those smaller increments are the units\nat which spacetime alterations would actually exist.\nConversely, if the spacetime processor emerged because of a\nmetaphorical analog or due to cultural learning, we would be\nless confident that it would continue to hold at incredibly\nsmall levels of temporal analysis. Instead, we might expect\nthat analogs or cultural learning would serve to guide time\nperception in a general way, only at the kinds of larger units\nfor which we typically make such judgments at a phenome-\nnological level. Thus, evidence that we show spacetime\nalterations at very small units of analysis would not defini-\ntively rule out the analogical or cultural learning origins, but\nwould weigh more heavily in favor of a direct adaptation.\nAnother potentially important factor on which the models\nmake competing predictions involves cross-cultural replica-\nbility. If the spacetime processor has a cultural learning ori-\ngin, one would expect that the level of knowledge a person or\nculture had of relativity theory would directly correspond to\nthe predicted time perception effects outlined here. If it\nproved to be true that the effects outlined here held only for\ngroups of persons with a strong knowledge of relativity, then\nit would seem increasingly unlikely that the spacetime pro-\ncessor had a direct adaptation or metaphorical analog origin.\nRather, that would make a stronger case for a cultural learn-\ning origin.\nConsider, for example, that the reported effects of time\u00ad\nmotion compensation were mostly performed in societies\nwhere there likely exists at least a cursory knowledge of the\ntheory of relativity. Although we strongly doubt that most of\nthe participants in these studies were aware of the specific\npredictions related to the studies in question, it is nonetheless\npossible that what those studies reflect is not a universal\nmechanism for accounting for motion\u00adtime perception inte-\ngration, but rather cultural learning of the theory of relativity.\nIf, however, such effects are found to be more or less univer-\nsal across cultures and independent of the knowledge of rela-\ntivity theory, this suggests that the spacetime-like effects\nemerging from this conceptual analysis have some deeper\nbasis that is more fundamental to the human species (whether\nof adaptive or analogical origins).\nAt this point, we do not have enough information to\nclearly distinguish between these various possible reasons\nthat we might see conceptual and empirical overlap between\nphysical spacetime and psychological spacetime. Like Brian\nGreene and others, we view a direct adaptation for spacetime\nprocessing as fairly unlikely, and thus would expect either\nthe metaphorical analog or cultural learning explanations to\nbe closer to the truth. However, our primary purpose in this\narticle is not to argue for any one potential origin. Rather, it\nis to point out that there are multiple valid reasons why the\noverlap between physical spacetime and psychological\nspacetime may exist. As such, this suggests that it may be\nworth more fully exploring the psychological spacetime\nmodel as an explanatory mechanism for studying time\nperception.\nConcluding Thoughts\nI had a sneaking suspicion that time was not constant, but I guess\nI could never prove it. I suppose it didn't really matter. I even\nhad a theory that time didn't go in straight line at all. I knew I\nwas no Albert Einstein, but I had the sneaking suspicion that\neverything that had happened, was happening, or would happen\nwas really happening all the time. There was no past, present,\nand future. Everything was going on all at once and forever.\n(Mark A. Roeder)\nOur altered understanding of spacetime was perhaps the\nmost important scientific advance of the last century. And\nyet, in spite of this, its potential implications for human psy-\nchology are largely not well understood. The guiding\nassumption seems to be that we are implicit Newtonians\nHuang, 1982); and because we do not likely have mecha-\nnisms to perceive spacetime in a manner consistent with the\ncomplicated fashion that it actually exists, we can safely pro-\nceed in ignoring psychological spacetime in our study of\ntime perception.\nThat guiding assumption may end up being right; but\nexisting evidence suggests that it may be at least partially\nwrong. After all, although we may not--to use Brian\nGreene's metaphor that we opened this article with--\"feel\nrelativity in our bones,\" we nonetheless have the capacity to\nunderstand it at some level. Thus, popular author Mark A.\nRoeder's \"sneaking suspicion that time was not constant\"\nmay, after all, turn out to represent something real in human\npsychology that has yet to be fully explored.\nGiven that time perception has incredibly important\nimplications for human emotion, life satisfaction, and mental\n2008), it is vital that we understand it as well as we can. With\nthat goal in mind, the present article at the very least suggests\nthe potential usefulness of considering psychological space-\ntime as a theoretical and conceptual device. It seems certain\nthat (a) time and space share a lot of biological overlap in the\nbrain, (b) we do at least in some way account for the relation-\nship of motion to time in a manner consistent with relativity\ntheory, (c) some speculative hypotheses consistent with the\nspacetime model have received support, and (d) there are\nadditional conceptual reasons to think that relationship might\napply across numerous other areas of time perception. Thus,\nmore fully considering the overlap between physical space-\ntime and psychological spacetime might prove to bear fruit\nin our quest to better understand time perception.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. The present article discusses possible evolutionary processes\nfrom the lens of evolutionary psychology, but it does not nec-\nessarily assume a direct evolved adaptive mechanism. We\nreturn to this issue later in the article.\n2. The Chen, Pizzolato, and Cesari (2013) study involved elite\nathletes rating time intervals following viewing action ver-\nsus nonaction pictures. Viewing action pictures compressed\n(rather than dilated) time. However, this study did not involve\nthe perception of actual (only implied) motion and was with\na very select population. The Orgs, Bestmann, Schuur, and\nHaggard (2011) study involved apparent motion based on\nthe timing of pictures of postures in different positions, and\nthey found that increased perceived movement in that sce-\nnario compressed time perception. Even if one accepts both\nstudies as direct evidence (and it is unclear whether the Chen\net al. study is directly related), most real effects generally have\ncounterexamples, and the overwhelming balance of evidence\nis in support of the time dilation hypothesis derived from the\nproposed model.\nReferences\nAbe, S.
