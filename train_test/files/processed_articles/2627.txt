To some degree, however, there has been a disjunction between\ntheorizing on how neighborhood dynamics affect crime and empirical examination of\nthese processes. Ecological theories are often used to explain between-neighborhood\ndifferences in crime rates, but less attention is paid to within-neighborhood change over\ntime. This is a substantial gap in our understanding of how structural conditions are\nlinked to crime, as the theoretical influence of neighborhood conditions emerges over\ntime as a function of dynamic processes. These simplifications overlook the possibility\nthat neighborhoods may appear similar in cross-section--that is, share a comparable\nlevel of some structural condition like economic disadvantage--but have substantially\ndifferent histories of change (or continuity).\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Jacob H. Becker, Department of Sociology, Anthropology, Social\nWork, and Criminal Justice, 518 Varner Hall,  , Rochester, MI 48309; jhbecker@oakland.edu.\nSampson (2012) has recently proposed that we consider neighborhoods from a devel-\nopmental or life-course perspective. He points out that neighborhoods change over time\nin ways that can be considered \"trajectories,\" and that they experience transitions and\nturning points (in the vocabulary of the age-graded theory of informal social control; see\nSampson and Laub 1993). It is logical then that the \"present\" of a neighborhood is de-\npendent on its \"past\" much like an individual's current state is conditional on his or her\nprior biography.\nA parallel body of work has examined spatial aspects of the associations between struc-\ntural conditions and crime (Baller et al. 2001; Messner et al. 1999) and tested several\nassumptions of nonspatial models. Among these is spatial invariance, which assumes that\nthe relationship between a predictor and an outcome is the same across geographic\nunits (or \"stationary\"). Research generally finds this does not hold--the association is\nsignificantly different across locations (Deller and Deller 2012; Graif and Sampson 2009;\nLight and Harris 2012). Our understanding of how contexts contribute to neighborhood\ncrime would benefit from a deeper consideration of how dimensions of time and space\nmanifest in ecological dynamics. There has been growing attention in both criminol-\nogy and sociology about spatial and temporal variability in individuals' exposure to con-\ntextual influences, exemplified by work on the \"uncertain geographic context problem\"\n(UGCoP; Kwan 2012). It is possible there is an analogous issue at the neighborhood level,\nmoving beyond debates of the appropriate unit of analysis (the \"modifiable areal unit\nof timing and duration. My goal is thus to explore temporal continuity and change in one\nimportant neighborhood condition--concentrated disadvantage--and how change (or\nlack of it) may link structural conditions with crime. In doing so, I will demonstrate how\naccounting for these dynamics can partly explain previous findings of spatially variant\nassociations between structural conditions and crime, and contribute to a developmental\nperspective on neighborhoods and crime that explicitly addresses these associations as\npart of a dynamic temporal process.\nRooted in the Chicago School of social ecology (Park et al. 1967), Shaw and McKay\n(1969) found that in the presence of relatively rapid changes in composition, neighbor-\nhoods with high levels of poverty had more crime than neighborhoods with less poverty.\nBecause high-poverty neighborhoods tended to remain impoverished over long periods\nof time, they proposed that a dynamic process, part of a larger trend of city growth\nand expansion, produced neighborhoods where poverty led to high residential turnover\nand racial/ethnic heterogeneity. Poverty was a distal cause of high crime rates operat-\ning through proximate mechanisms of residential instability and heterogeneity, creating\n\"socially disorganized\" neighborhoods where social control was limited. Later modifica-\ntions of this perspective focused on the theoretical mechanisms linking structural condi-\ntions to crime and disorder. The establishment of community attachment and network\nties in the \"systemic model\" (Kasarda and Janowitz 1974; Sampson 1988; Warner and\nRountree 1997), the exertion of social control at multiple levels (Bursik and Grasmick\n1993; Sampson and Groves 1989), and the channeling of social capital through social\nbonds to produce \"collective efficacy\" (Sampson and Raudenbush 1999; Sampson et al.\n1997) have all been found to mediate the effects of neighborhood structure on crime and\ndisorder. These relationships may be part of nonrecursive cycles (Sampson 2012) and can\nbe complex. For example, in tests of the \"negotiated coexistence\" model, the regulatory\npower of collective efficacy on crime was reduced in areas that had strong social net-\nworks (Browning 2009; Browning et al. 2004). Social ties between residents appeared to\nsimultaneously contribute to collective efficacy while offering offenders a source of social\ncapital that protected them from becoming \"targets\" of informal social control. Others\nhave reached similar conclusions; Pattillo (1998) found the incorporation of individuals\nlike gang members into largely prosocial resident networks could prevent those networks\nfrom being completely efficacious. Criminals remained community members embedded\nin networks who shared \"mainstream desires for neighborhood order\" but were \"given a\ndegree of latitude to operate in the neighborhood\" (Pattillo 1998, p. 770). Here, the sta-\nbility of the networks played a large role in determining how embedded residents, both\ncriminal and not, became in the community.\nThese variations on social disorganization have a common thread: There is a social\nprocess through which neighborhood conditions influence crime rates. Whatever the\nprocess, it is by definition temporal. It does not immediately follow from structural con-\nditions but requires time to emerge and exert its influence. It follows that change--\nor its inverse, continuity--in neighborhood conditions (whether good or bad) plays a\ncritical role in the operation of the social processes linking structure to crime (Bursik\n1986; Kirk and Laub 2010). However, many studies overlook the inherent dynamism of\nneighborhoods, due in part to a reliance on cross-sectional data. For example, Park et al.\n(1967, p. 53) characterized metropolitan areas as units of growth and change, part of a\nmetabolic process which affected the ability of an area to maintain some degree of con-\ntinuity and make a \"natural but adequate readjustment in the social organization\" of a\ncity. Disorganization was not pathological but a normal stage of development preceding\nreorganization, which could not commence while change was ongoing as it disrupted\nexisting patterns of social routine--producing a \"moving equilibrium of social order\"\n(Park et al. 1967, p. 54)--and led to neighborhoods with intractably high levels of crime,\ndelinquency, and other social ills. Disruption was expected to be succeeded by a period\nof reorganization if and when the pace of change slowed or halted. In areas of persis-\ntent high poverty or disadvantage, neighborhoods may already be in the end stages of\nreorganization, though along qualitatively different criteria given that old standards of\nbehavior have broken down and \"new . . . standards have arisen\" (Whyte 1943, p. 38).\nThe ecological perspective rests on an understanding of neighborhoods as dynamic\norganisms, and previous work has shown that the ecological structure of neighbor-\nhoods is often not in a state of equilibrium (Bursik 1986; Bursik and Webb 1982;\nSchuerman and Kobrin 1986). The associations between structural conditions and\ncrime appear sensitive to the stability of neighborhood ecological systems (Bursik and\nGrasmick 1993, p. 50), implying theoretical mediating processes like disorganization\nare dependent on the internal dynamics of the neighborhood itself. Neighborhoods\nwhich are on their surface disorganized or lacking social control may experience\nless crime than statistical models of structural conditions would predict. To illustrate\nhow this dynamism matters, I turn now to a neighborhood condition which consid-\nerable research has shown plays a large role in neighborhood crime: concentrated\ndisadvantage.\nEconomic conditions within a neighborhood are key predictors of any number of social\noutcomes, including crime. Early studies typically relied on a single measure-- poverty--\nand its association with processes linking neighborhood structural conditions to crime,\nlike residential mobility and racial/ethnic heterogeneity (Shaw and McKay 1969). More\nrecent work has reconceptualized neighborhood deprivation as the intersection of several\nnegative conditions in time and space, including high levels of poverty, female-headed\nhouseholds, and unemployment. Wilson (1996) described the emergence of \"concen-\ntrated disadvantage\" in urban areas toward the end of the 20th century as the result\nof larger social and economic processes at work in the United States at the time (also\nsee Massey and Denton 1993). The confluence of multiple dimensions of deprivation\ncreated a substantively different type of disadvantage than had existed previously; neigh-\nborhoods were no longer simply poor but suffered from a particularly severe form of\ndeprivation. Historical conditions (i.e., time) were essential for explaining the spatial\nconcentration of African Americans in disadvantaged neighborhoods. For example, non-\npoor black families had once acted as a \"social buffer\" for poor black families by acting\nas sources of neighborhood economic and social capital from which all coresidents could\nbenefit. When nonpoor families began to migrate to other neighborhoods, the resources\nthey supplied also left, leaving behind a concentration of disadvantage linked to a variety\nof negative social outcomes such as crime and violence.\nAt roughly the same time Wilson (1996) was exploring the growth of concentrated dis-\nadvantage in American cities, a debate emerged in macrocriminology on the conceptu-\nalization of \"deprivation.\" Prompted in part by critiques of poverty-based explanations of\ncrime (e.g., Blau and Blau 1982; Rosenfeld and Messner 1995) and inconsistent findings\nacross empirical research, this debate culminated in the work of Land et al. (1990). They\nfound the relationships between 11 commonly employed structural covariates and crime\nwere inconsistent across models using different units of analysis (e.g., cities or metropoli-\ncorporating \"resource deprivation/affluence\" variables like the poverty rate and propor-\ntion of single-parent families was more appropriate. The effect of this factor on crime\nrates was robust over time periods and different levels of measurement, in keeping with\nWilson's assertion that multiple dimensions of disadvantage influenced the social pro-\ncesses linking structural conditions to crime.\nWithin criminology, Wilson's (1996) work and the conclusions of (Land et al. 1990)\ncontributed to the widespread adoption of this conceptualization of deprivation and\nstratification (Sampson 2013). While essential to studies of urban neighborhoods and\ncrime, focusing on the distribution of disadvantage across neighborhoods had the unin-\ntended consequence of removing attention from the theoretical relationships between\necological change, social disorganization, and crime originally suggested by Shaw and\nMcKay (1969). Most contemporary research examines the harmful effects of neighbor-\nhood concentrated disadvantage through cross-sectional studies of neighborhoods with\nvarying degrees of disadvantage (though see Solari 2012), but rarely acknowledges that\nthis new type of disadvantage differs in a critical way from that depicted by Park et al.\n(1967) or Shaw and McKay (1969). Traditionally, poverty was linked to higher crime rates\nthrough processes that promoted neighborhood change; for example, higher population\nmobility, weaker community attachment, and less social control. Concentrated disadvan-\ntage, however, has commonly been conceptualized as inhibiting neighborhood change.\nNeighborhoods suffering from high levels of concentrated disadvantage are likely to re-\nmain that way by isolating and trapping residents in conditions that represent a \"tangle of\npathologies\" and are durable over time (Sampson 2009, 2012). This type of disadvantage\ntherefore does not lead to a lack of \"equilibrium\" but instead may promote the continuity\nthat fosters neighborhood reorganization. A similar mechanism has been found in rural\nareas, where poverty appears to increase rather than decrease residential stability, with\nconcurrent reductions in crime (Osgood and Chambers 2000). Social disorganization re-\ntains a positive relationship with area crime rates, but the indirect relationship between\npoverty and disorganization is reversed.\nIn the face of continuous and stable disadvantage, neighborhoods may have crime\nrates which are somewhat lower than predicted by their level of concentrated disadvan-\ntage alone. Inversely, neighborhoods with relatively low levels of disadvantage may expe-\nrience higher-than-expected crime rates if current levels of disadvantage were preceded\nby a period of substantial change (i.e., decreased disadvantage). This reasoning is consis-\ntent with previous work on neighborhood change and crime/delinquency. Bursik and\nGrasmick (1992) found increasing levels of residential stability within neighborhoods\nfrom 1930 to 1970 were significantly and positively related to declines in delinquency\nover time. Similarly, both positive (e.g., decreased disadvantage) and negative change\nwere linked to higher levels of violence in Baltimore (Covington and Taylor 1989; Taylor\nand Covington 1988). On its face, neighborhood revitalization/gentrification is bene-\nficial, leading to improved conditions like lower disadvantage and less crime (though\nthese benefits may be race-specific; see Papachristos et al. 2011). For example, Seattle\ncensus tracts which gentrified in the 1990s saw reductions in crime relative to nongentri-\nfying tracts as theoretically expected (Kreager et al. 2011). Viewed as a process, however,\nmortgage investment had a curvilinear relationship with crime, suggesting even favor-\nable change like gentrification can be disruptive. Disruption, in turn, leads to a dimin-\nished capacity for informal social control until some \"tipping point\" is reached and stable\ngentrification is associated with reduced crime (Kreager et al. 2011, p. 634).\nSince processes linking structural conditions to crime are embedded in the neighbor-\nhood's historical development, we should reconsider how neighborhood effects emerge\nand operate. If the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and crime is affected\nby \"when\" in the neighborhood's history we are looking (Bursik and Webb 1982), it can\nbe characterized as time-variant. In cross-section, this would likely appear as a spatially\nvariant relationship across neighborhoods; that is, the association between disadvantage\nand crime would differ among neighborhoods with similar levels of disadvantage at a\ngiven time point but substantially different histories. This line of reasoning would account\nfor previous findings that did not support assumptions of spatially invariant associations\nbetween neighborhood conditions and crime.\nThis potential link between temporal processes and spatial invariance offers another\nreason to attend to spatial organization's role in the study of neighborhoods. Nonspatial\nanalyses treat all observations (e.g., neighborhoods) as discrete geographical units, which\nrests on two key assumptions: (1) spatial independence and (2) spatial invariance. Spatial\nindependence implies that structural conditions and crime within one geographic unit\nhave no association with crime in proximate units. A growing literature addressing spatial\nindependence finds substantial evidence that this assumption is largely unmet (Baller\net al. 2001; Messner and Anselin 2004), though the form that spatial dependence takes is\nstill unclear (e.g., diffusion; see Morenoff et al. 2001).\nThe second assumption has received less attention to date, though this is changing.\nSpatial invariance posits the association between a structural predictor and the outcome\nof interest is constant across space, or \"stationary\" (Fotheringham et al. 2002). Nonspa-\ntial methods like ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression produce a single estimate of\nthe relationship, referred to as a \"global\" effect, which represents the average associa-\ntion within the entire sample. This assumes the relationship is relatively consistent across\nunits, potentially masking substantial and statistically significant spatial variation in the\nstrength and direction of the relationship. If the true relationship includes both signif-\nicant negative and significant positive associations, in a global estimate these opposing\nforces may \"wash out\" and produce a Type II error. Cases where the relationship is very\nlarge may alter the mean association of that variable with the outcome (like a univariate\noutlier influences a sample mean); where the true relationship is nonsignificant, the pres-\nence of outlier coefficients may overestimate the mean relationship (in either a positive\nor negative direction) and produce a Type I error.\nLimited research using geographic information systems (GIS) and geographically\nweighted regression (GWR) suggests the effects of important structural predictors\nof crime do vary across space. Graif and Sampson (2009) noted the concentrated\ndisadvantage-homicide rate relationship was spatially variant across Chicago tracts, and\nLight and Harris (2012) found the relationship between structural disadvantage and ar-\nrests was spatially variant in a sample of U.S. counties. A study of Portland, Oregon, em-\nploying GWR also found the associations between structural covariates and violent crime\nvaried across block groups (Cahill and Mulligan 2007). None of these studies, however,\nexplored what might be producing this spatial variation, like the within-neighborhood dy-\nnamics of structural stability and change that could influence the social processes linking\nconditions to crime. This study focuses on how within-neighborhood stability and change\nmay explain spatial variation in the relationship of concentrated disadvantage and crime\nrates in cross-section.\nGiven the theoretical importance of neighborhood dynamics to ecological explanations\nof crime, and prior findings of spatially variant cross-sectional associations between struc-\ntural conditions and crime, I test a hypothesis that links these temporal processes to spa-\ntial models of neighborhood effects: I predict that controlling for neighborhood struc-\ntural continuity and change will account for previously\u00adobserved spatial variation in the\ncross-sectional disadvantage-crime relationship. The relationship will become spatially in-\nvariant net of within-neighborhood change in concentrated disadvantage over time. The\nlevel of disadvantage is still expected to have a positive association with crime. More dis-\nadvantaged neighborhoods will have higher crime rates than those with less, a common\nfinding in this area (Morenoff and Sampson 1997; Stults 2010). What remains unclear\nis how change in disadvantage will influence the relationship. Change at any level of\ndisadvantage may be detrimental and lead to higher crime rates by disrupting mecha-\nnisms that limit crime, such as the formation of community attachment, social bonds,\nor collective efficacy; even relatively advantaged neighborhoods would have higher rates\nof crime than their level of disadvantage suggests (Kreager et al. 2011; van Wilsem et al.\n2006). Neighborhoods experiencing more change will have higher rates of crime than\nthose with less (or none), net of the level of disadvantage-- I characterize this as the\n\"temporal disruption\" hypothesis. Alternatively, the effects of continuity may depend on\nthe level of disadvantage within a neighborhood. At high levels, the detrimental effects of\nconcentrated disadvantage could accumulate over time, so neighborhoods with contin-\nuous high disadvantage would have higher crime rates than expected. Continuity would\nbe favorable in less disadvantaged neighborhoods because benefits would accrue over\ntime, weakening the disadvantage-crime relationship and producing lower than expected\ncrime rates, leading to the \"temporal accumulation\" hypothesis.\nIn the \"temporal lag\" hypothesis, the effect of change could depend on its direction.\nCommunity attachment, social ties, and the ability of a neighborhood to establish trust\nand exercise informal social control are types of social capital. Neighborhoods with in-\ncreasing disadvantage have \"savings\" of capital built in a less disadvantaged past, so the\nnegative effects of disadvantage will only emerge once this is depleted. In cross-section,\nneighborhoods with increasing disadvantage would have lower crime rates than pre-\ndicted because the relationship would be weaker than expected due to the time lag. In-\nversely, neighborhoods experiencing declines in concentrated disadvantage require time\nto translate increases in resources into social capital. In this case, the relationship between\ndisadvantage and crime would be stronger than expected in cross-section. The final pos-\nsibility is that neighborhood histories of disadvantage have no significant effect on the\nsocial process that links structural conditions to crime. The time necessary for concen-\ntrated disadvantage to impact a mediating social process like collective efficacy could be\nrelatively short and longer histories of disadvantage would not have a substantial effect on\nneighborhood crime rates. This seems unlikely, however, given how any ecological pro-\ncess mediating the structure-crime relationship is temporally dependent-- for example,\nhow long it likely takes to build trust and shared expectations for informal social control\nwithin a neighborhood.\nI explore the dynamics of concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates in Chicago\nneighborhoods with several data sources. Decennial census data on Chicago are used to\nconstruct measures of structural conditions from 1970 to 2000 in \"neighborhood clusters\"\n(NCs), a unit of measurement created as part of the Project on Human Development in\nChicago Neighborhoods (Earls et al. 2007). NCs are designed to represent ecologically\nmeaningful units in studies of neighborhoods (Morenoff et al. 2001; Silver and Miller\nboundaries using the Neighborhood Change Database (Geolytics) to ensure identical\ngeographical units were compared over time and aggregated tract-level data to the NC\nlevel using \"crosswalk\" data supplied by the PHDCN into a final sample of 342 NCs. Data\non neighborhood homicides from 2001 to 2005 were obtained from the Chicago Police\nDepartment's online database CLEAR (CLEAR 2012).\nThe outcome of interest is the five-year average homicide rate per 100,000 residents for\neach NC in Chicago. The Chicago Police Department's online database tracks crimes\nknown to the police by type and year, and each \"event\" includes information on where\nthe crime occurred. All homicides from 2001 through 2005 were geocoded to the appro-\npriate tract in ArcGIS and aggregated to the NC level. From this I calculated the average\nyearly number of homicides and constructed a rate per 100,000 residents. A multiyear\naverage rate is commonly used to reduce potential bias introduced by year-to-year fluc-\ntuations in crime, especially relatively rare types like homicide (Martinez et al. 2010).\nThe distribution of the homicide rate across NCs was substantially skewed and was trans-\nformed using a natural log function, in keeping with previous work.\nContemporary research often focuses on three summary measures of neighborhood con-\nditions: concentrated disadvantage, immigrant concentration (a modern analogue to\nShaw and McKay's (1969) measure of racial/ethnic heterogeneity), and residential in-\nstability. Several highly collinear univariate measures are combined in a single concep-\ntually distinct factor for a given dimension in a factor regression procedure, a relatively\nstraightforward strategy when examining a single year but more complicated when ap-\nplied to multiple time points. Comparisons of the factor loadings across 1970 to 2000\nshowed the same components loaded in substantively similar fashion over time; however,\nthe distributions of these variables changed considerably. Because final factor scores are\nnormalized, direct comparisons over time are affected by shifts in intercepts between\nyears, which represent the mean levels of factors across the sample of NCs for a given\nyear. For example, an NC with a level of concentrated disadvantage in 1970 equal to the\nmean disadvantage for the entire sample would have a standardized score of zero for\n1970. The same NC could again have a level of disadvantage in 2000 equal to the sam-\nple mean and a standardized factor score of zero, so disadvantage would not appear to\nhave changed within this NC. However, if the mean level of disadvantage across all NCs in\nChicago actually rose (or fell) in real terms, a change-score measure would be misleading.\nAll it would indicate is whether an NC's level of disadvantage, relative to the entire sample of\nChicago NCs, changed over time. To avoid this problem, I based the current factor scores\non the distributions of the univariate measures across the entire period. The results of\nthese models are the rotated factor loadings of component variables from 1970 through\n2000 (available upon request), and normalized factor scores based on the average distri-\nbution of the components over time. It is now possible to directly compare NC levels of\ndisadvantage, immigrant concentration, and residential stability over time.\nThe factor measures produced with this strategy are consistent with earlier work\n(Sampson et al. 1997). The primary independent variable of interest, concentrated dis-\nadvantage, consists of the proportion of residents in an NC who are black, the proportion\nunemployed, and the proportion of households which are female-headed, below poverty,\nor on public assistance ( = .94). The other two factor measures are employed as controls\nand constructed in a similar fashion. Immigrant concentration is determined by the propor-\ntion of Hispanic and foreign-born residents ( = .81), while residential stability comprises\nMean Median Std. Dev. Min. Max.\nthe proportion of residents living in the same location five years prior and the propor-\ntion of owner-occupied housing units ( = .69). In later models, I control for within-NC\nchange in disadvantage. The measure of change was constructed by summing the amount\nobscured changes in opposing directions that occurred over shorter periods and failed to\ntruly capture structural continuity/change. However, using the absolute change in con-\ncentrated disadvantage makes it impossible to assess how the direction of change may\nmatter; this study is limited to exploring the more basic role of structural stability. The\ndistribution of the absolute change in concentrated disadvantage from 1970 to 2000 was\ndivided into quartiles where the first quartile represents little or no change, with each sub-\nsequent quartile evidencing greater within-neighborhood changes (both increases and\ndecreases) in concentrated disadvantage than the last. For parsimony, dummy variables\nrepresenting the quartiles of change were calculated for each NC (1 = yes, 0 = no) to\ncharacterize shifts in the level of disadvantage over time. Descriptive statistics for the\nAs laid out earlier, I believe within-neighborhood dynamics may account for spatial vari-\nation in the associations between structural conditions and homicide, so I first test for\nthe presence of a spatially variant relationship between concentrated disadvantage and\nhomicide across Chicago NCs in cross-section using GWR. These results are compared\nto those of a traditional OLS model which assumes spatial invariance. In traditional OLS\nregression, the constant () and the coefficient () are the same regardless of location\n(i)\nyi\n=  + xi\nso the model produces a single parameter estimate for each predictor for the full sample.\nIn GWR, however, the relationship is not assumed to be independent of location (i.e.,\nspatially invariant) and the constant and coefficient are allowed to vary by observation\nyi\n=  (ui\n, vi\n) +  (ui\n, vi\n) xi\nThe values of the constant and the coefficient are a function of the location, denoted\nhere as geographic coordinates (ui,vi) which allow the location of every observation to\nbe determined relative to other sample observations. Each NC in the sample becomes\nthe center of a local regression employing a subsample of locations surrounding it. The\nresult is a set of local parameter estimates and model fit statistics for each sample NC.\nThe optimal local sample size is a trade-off between minimizing model bias and max-\nimizing the variance within each local regression. I use a spatially adaptive weighting\nfunction (Fotheringham et al. 2002) where observations closer to (ui,vi) are weighted\nmore heavily than those further away, in keeping with Tobler's (1970) \"first law of ge-\nography\" that nearer places are more similar than distant ones. The size of the local\nsample kernel or bandwidth is smaller in areas with many data points and extends fur-\nther in areas with less. This schema accounts for the distribution and size differences of\nNCs across Chicago, which tend to be smaller and denser closer to the city center, and\nkeeps the sample size and standard errors relatively consistent across local regressions.\nThis weighting schema assumes the spatial relationship is generally linear--that is, simi-\nlarities between neighborhoods are greatest among adjacent places and diminish as the\ndistance between them increases. This is not strictly the case in Chicago, where abrupt\nchanges in neighborhood conditions are possible (Sampson 2012), but map-based sup-\nplemental explorations suggest this assumption generally holds.\nA geographical variability test of spatial variation in the distribution of parameter\nestimates indicates whether any observed variation is statistically different from zero\n(Fotheringham et al. 2002). Any significant spatial variation in the disadvantage-\nhomicide relationship across Chicago would suggest that a given level of disadvantage\noperates differently across NCs. I then add the dummy measures of within-neighborhood\nchange to the model to observe if and how structural stability/change accounts for\nspatial variation in the cross-sectional disadvantage-homicide relationship.\nRESULTS\nNeighborhood cluster homicide rates were first regressed on the three factor measures\nof structural conditions using GWR and the results compared to those from an OLS\nregression model. The results of these \"baseline\" models appear in Table 2. In keeping\nwith prior research, in the OLS model (Panel B) concentrated disadvantage in 2000 has\na large, positive association with homicide rates (b = .557, p < .001) and is by far the\nlargest standardized coefficient in the model ( = .775). The three factor measures of\nstructural conditions explain about two-thirds of the variation in homicide rates across\nConsistent with previous studies, NCs with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage\nare predicted to have higher homicide rates, controlling for immigrant concentration\nand residential stability. However, this model is nonspatial and cannot address the pos-\nsibility that the true relationship varies across NCs. GWR allows me to test for spatial in-\nvariance and map local parameter estimates for visual inspection. I specified an identical\nbaseline model in the program GWR 4.0 using the adaptive weighting function described\nabove, and the model converged at a local sample size of 41 NCs. Local parameter es-\ntimates and model fit statistics, as well as fit statistics for the overall GWR model, are\ndisplayed in Table 2, Panel A. The results are organized as 5-number summaries across\nall NCs, indicating the distribution of local effects for the three predictors, the direction\nof significant relationships, and if they vary significantly across space.\nTABLE 2.

Geographic Variability\nMinimum Quartile Median Quartile Maximum Local Effects1 Test b (SE) \nModel fit and ANOVA\n1Statistically significant local effects, p < .05.\nThe results clearly indicate that the relationship between concentrated disadvantage\nand homicide rates varies across Chicago neighborhoods. It ranges from a null to statis-\ntically significant positive relationship, with local b-coefficients of concentrated disadvan-\ntage extending from -.58 to .92. The geographical variability test reveals this variation is\nstatistically significant (p < .001), indicating the spatial invariance assumption does not\nhold. The same is true of immigrant concentration, with the parameter estimates of vary-\ning significantly across Chicago (p < .001). Overall, the GWR model (AIC = 164.89) fits\nthe data better than the OLS model (AIC = 297.80), with a significant improvement in\nmodel fit (F = 3.36, p < .001), and accounts for 15 percent more variation in homicide\nrates (adjusted R2 = .79) than the OLS model (adjusted R2 = .67).\nLocal GWR models account for anywhere from 27 percent to 89 percent of the varia-\ntion in homicide rates (not shown), confirming that traditional OLS models mask sub-\nstantial and systematic differences in explanatory power across NCs. The relationship\nbetween concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates also exhibits a spatial pattern\nacross Chicago.

If one examined\nNCs in the central business district of Chicago, the findings would be quite different than\na study of neighborhoods on the fringe of the city. I hypothesized that this variation may\nbe due to neighborhoods having dissimilar histories of concentrated disadvantage though\nthey have similar levels at a given time point. Accounting for within-NC changes in con-\ncentrated disadvantage from 1970 to 2000 allows me to examine this prospect: I added\nthe dummy variables representing quartiles of change to the GWR model to assess if and\nhow neighborhood dynamics might account for spatial variation in the cross-sectional\nconcentrated disadvantage-homicide relationship. The first quartile, representing minor\nor no change in disadvantage, was the omitted reference group. The results of the GWR\nmodel were again compared to OLS estimates. The resulting 5-number summaries of the\nlocal regressions, in Table 3, Panel A, indicate the inclusion of the change variables in\nthe \"expanded\" GWR model has a notable effect. The range of the b-coefficient for con-\ncentrated disadvantage shrinks by about 13 percent (-.60 through .70) and the variation\nacross local regressions is smaller, though still statistically significant. Presented visually in\nFigure 1, Panel B, the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and homicide now\nappears more consistent across NCs compared to the t-surface map of the baseline model\nin Panel A. The t-surface map of the expanded model reveals that it is now more com-\nmon for the local associations to be nonsignificant (120 of 342 NCs) while the number of\nneighborhoods where the local t-value is 6 or above is less than 3 percent (9 out 342 NCs).\nHaving established that changes in disadvantage partly account for cross-sectional\nspatial variation in the disadvantage-homicide relationship across NCs, a closer look at\nthese dynamics is warranted. The spatial invariance assumption is still not completely\nsupported, but for the purposes of comparison with prior research a return to OLS\nPanel A: GWR (5-Number Parameter Summary) Panel B: OLS Regression\nLower Upper Range of Sig.

The results of the expanded OLS model presented in Table 3,\nPanel B are similar to the baseline model examined earlier. Roughly 70 percent of the\nvariation in homicide rates across NCs is explained in the expanded model; this is a signif-\nicant but substantively small improvement compared to 67 percent in the baseline model\n(F = 11.38, p < .001). However, there is a sizable reduction in the strength of the global\nrelationship between concentrated disadvantage and homicide (b = .428, p < .001) in\ncomparison to Table 2, Panel B. The relationship remains the strongest of the structural\npredictors ( = .596) but is about 23 percent smaller than when the change variables\nThe amount of within-neighborhood change in disadvantage clearly matters. Com-\npared to the omitted first quartile-- which includes neighborhoods experiencing little\nor no change from 1970 to 2000-- neighborhoods with more change are predicted to\nhave significantly higher homicide rates. This relationship seems to follow a somewhat\nlinear pattern, with each subsequent change quartile predicting higher homicide rates.\nThe cross-sectional association between an NC's level of concentrated disadvantage and\nits homicide rate appears to be influenced by whether that level has been relatively steady\nover time.\nPrevious research has found that a key assumption of nonspatial models of neighbor-\nhood structural conditions and crime-- spatial invariance-- was not supported (Cahill\n2004). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that within-neighborhood changes\nin concentrated disadvantage would account for spatial variation in the cross-sectional\ndisadvantage-homicide rate relationship. Prior work is largely descriptive and alludes\nto but does not directly test for the influence of theoretical mechanisms like \"diffu-\nsion\" of crime across spatial units, opportunities for violence, or interactions between\nneighborhoods and the larger spatial geography. This study both adds to a body of ev-\nidence that suggests empirical models of macrostructural conditions and crime should\nnot assume these relationships are invariant at a given point in time and suggests a\npotential avenue for future research. One explanation for the spatial variation in the\ndisadvantage-homicide relationship found here (also see Graif and Sampson 2009; Light\nand Harris 2012) is the role of dynamic structural conditions within neighborhoods.\nGiven the theoretical importance of within-neighborhood continuity and change to the\nproduction and maintenance of social processes hypothesized to mediate the relation-\nship (e.g., collective efficacy), I explored how changes in neighborhood disadvantage\nimpact estimates of the concentrated disadvantage-homicide rate association in cross-\nsection, leading to my key finding. A comparison of the \"basic\" and \"expanded\" models\nsuggests that within-neighborhood disadvantage dynamics influence the cross-sectional\nassociation between disadvantage and homicide. The inclusion of controls for how much\nchange had occurred within neighborhoods prior to 2000 produced two notable re-\nsults. First, controlling for changes in disadvantage reduced the spatial variation in the\ndisadvantage-homicide relationship (though the variation remained significant). Second,\nchanges in concentrated disadvantage over time mattered for the prediction of homicide\nrates; net of the level of concentrated disadvantage in 2000, higher degrees of change\nbe a substantive difference in how concentrated disadvantage affects homicide rates, de-\npendent to some extent on whether the neighborhood has experienced minor, moder-\nate, or major historical shifts in its level of concentrated disadvantage. This reintroduces\nan important temporal dimension to theorizing on the role of neighborhood structural\nconditions in producing or reducing crime. Neighborhoods with dissimilar histories of\ndisadvantage, though they have equivalent levels of disadvantage in cross-section, may ev-\nidence substantial variation in how much crime occurs within the neighborhood. While\nthis study limited its examination to homicide rates, future work should also test if spa-\ntially varying relationships and the role of historical change in disadvantage apply to other\ntypes of violent and property crime.\nThe findings are generally congruent with the \"disruption\" hypothesis; historical\nincreases in concentrated disadvantage predicted higher homicide rates, net of the\nlevel of disadvantage in 2000. However, this study was limited by the decision to model\nabsolute change. I outlined several ways historical dynamics might account for spatial\nvariation in the disadvantage-homicide relationship, but this framework was an idealized\nconceptualization: Neighborhoods could have high or low levels of disadvantage in\n2000, potentially preceded by increases, decreases, both, or no change. As this study was\nlargely exploratory, I chose to focus on internal neighborhood changes in disadvantage\nas an absolute; it was not possible to compare neighborhoods with similar degrees of\ninternal change, but in opposite directions, with the measure employed here. A fruitful\ndirection for future research would be examining neighborhoods and/or time periods\nwhich capture the full range of possible neighborhood histories. I also chose to focus on\na setting that has been well-studied (Park et al. 1967; Sampson 2012; Shaw and McKay\n1969) so results could be compared to an extensive literature on the disadvantage-crime\nrelationship.\nAny conclusions about the theoretical mechanisms linking the dynamics of neighbor-\nhood disadvantage to crime rates through a mediating social process are necessarily spec-\nulative and beyond the scope of this research. My purpose was to explore how change or\ncontinuity in concentrated disadvantage might contribute to neighborhood crime and\nprompt a deeper consideration of the ecological dynamics operating within neighbor-\nhoods over time. I did find, however, that greater change in concentrated disadvantage\nwas linked to higher homicide rates, net of disadvantage in 2000. This conforms to so-\ncial disorganization theories of neighborhood crime (Sampson and Groves 1989; Samp-\nson et al. 1997; Shaw and McKay 1969). In neighborhoods with shifting disadvantage,\nit would be more difficult to establish social ties or expectations of informal social con-\ntrol, regardless of the level of disadvantage at any given time. Inversely, neighborhoods\nwhich experience relatively steady levels of disadvantage (whether high or low) would\nhave a greater capacity to control crime; even criminals become embedded in primarily\nnoncriminal social networks over time and are subject to informal control in the neigh-\nborhood (Pattillo 1998). While disadvantage has concentrated in some neighborhoods,\ncreating \"traps\" and high levels of social isolation (Massey and Denton 1993; Sampson\n2009; Wilson 1996), there may be a very slender silver lining. Acute levels of disadvantage\nin these neighborhoods drive crime rates upward, but it is possible continuity engendered\nby the concentration process may inhibit the amount of crime occurring there. This is\nnot to suggest that concentrated disadvantage is a benefit-- the detrimental effects of the\nlevel of disadvantage found here far outweigh any favorable effects of its consistency.\nThese findings also indicate there may be a macrolevel analogue to the UGCoP de-\nscribed by Kwan (2012). The spatial and temporal uncertainty of \"context\" has received\nsubstantial attention in individual-level sociological and criminological research, but\nneighborhood-level studies tend to focus on spatial uncertainty (MAUP; see Hipp 2007)\nwhile failing to consider the temporal dimension. Lacking measures of mediating pro-\ncesses theorized to link neighborhood conditions and crime, I cannot say if structural\ncontinuity/change indirectly influences crime through a relationship with some social\nprocess (e.g., collective efficacy), and if so, how. Future work should look to further spec-\nify the models examined here and include measures of relevant theoretical mediators.\nFurthermore, while I believe these results suggest that within-neighborhood structural\nstability influences homicide rates, the use of GWR to explore how this change partially\naccounts for spatially variant structure-crime relationships is necessarily limited. There\nis a large literature that generally concludes there are other spatial forces at work-- for\nexample, spatial lag and spatial error models-- across adjacent neighborhoods (Baller\net al. 2001; Light and Harris 2012). A promising direction for future research would be\nto examine spatial variation in the structure-crime associations (addressing the spatial\ninvariance assumption) while controlling for spatial lag or error (addressing the spatial\nindependence assumption). It is theoretically possible that both the internal mechanisms\nof continuity/change suggested by this work and external mechanisms like spatial lag\nfound in previous work would operate simultaneously.\nThe principal goal of this paper was to examine neighborhood effects in a dynamic\ncontext. The ecological perspective of the Chicago School in which most contempo-\nrary macrocriminological theories are rooted held that continuity and change were cru-\ncial to explanations of neighborhood-level associations. By and large, however, studies\nof neighborhood effects have been limited to cross-sectional examinations of between-\nneighborhood differences. While these can tell us a great deal about how and why the\nlevel of a particular structural condition matters for crime-related outcomes, they fail to\nincorporate a dimension of neighborhood dynamism. These dynamics are theoretically\nimportant and appear to partly account for spatial variation in the disadvantage-crime re-\nlationship across Chicago neighborhoods. It is possible the temporal nature of the mech-\nanisms linking structural conditions to homicide expresses itself (to some degree) in the\nform of spatially variant cross-sectional relationships. This would link two influential the-\noretical paradigms in contemporary criminology: the social ecology of \"neighborhood\neffects\" research and the individual-level developmental/life-course perspective. Employ-\ning GWR and explicitly including a measure of within-neighborhood changes in disadvan-\ntage, I have demonstrated one possible strategy for exploring the intersection of \"social\nmechanisms and dynamic processes\" (Sampson 2012, p. 46) that moves beyond descrip-\ntion and correlation and into a potentially more complete explanation of neighborhood\neffects.\nREFERENCES\nAnselin, Luc. 1999. \"The Future of Spatial Analysis in the Social Sciences.\" Geographic Information Sciences 5:\nBaller, Robert D., Luc Anselin, Steven F.
