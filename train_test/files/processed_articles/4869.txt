This approach raises questions about knowledge and\nthe relationship of the knower to the known (epistemology)\nand determines how a researcher approaches the research\nprocess (methodology) (Lincoln, Lynham, & Guba, 2011).\nMethodology includes the strategy and plan of action of a\nresearch study. Methods are the techniques or procedures\nthat a researcher uses to answer their research question.\nChoosing which methods to use, including the recruitment\nand sampling of participants, data collection, data record-\ning, data analysis, and reporting, is guided by the research\nmethodology and the desired outcomes of the study (Crotty,\nLiterature aimed at postgraduate students and novice\nresearchers reiterates the importance of researchers establish-\ning the philosophical foundations of their study from the out-\nset (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005). Yet this activity does not\nalways occur. For example, in the case of grounded theory\nresearch, using the suite of grounded theory methods is often\nconsidered methodologically sufficient and due consideration\nis not necessarily given to a study's epistemological and onto-\nlogical underpinnings. This issue is compounded by the fact\nthat Glaser and Strauss (1967), the originators of grounded\ntheory, did not articulate the philosophical foundation of this\ndesign. Glaser's (2004) publication states that classic\ngrounded theory \"is simply a set of integrated conceptual\nhypotheses systematically generated to produce an inductive\ntheory about a substantive area\" (Introduction, para.7), effec-\ntively dismissing the need for an underpinning philosophical\nperspective. Glaser's position, however, should not be used as\na fall back that licenses a methodologically na\u00efve approach to\ngrounded theory research, particularly given the well-docu-\nmented analysis of his position as a post-positivist researcher\nlater Corbin and Strauss (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) state a\nnumber of philosophical and sociological assumptions that\nexplicitly underpin evolved grounded theory.\nIn the early 1960s, Glaser and Strauss conducted a study\ninto the experience of dying, culminating in their book\nAwareness of Dying (1965) and subsequently The Discovery\nof Grounded Theory (1967). Prior to the publication of this\nseminal text, social researchers were focusing on verifying\nextant theories or on testing barely generated theories.\n1James Cook University, Cairns, Queensland, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nJennifer Chamberlain-Salaun, School of Nursing, Midwifery and Nutrition,\nAustralia.\nEmail: jennifer.chamberlainsalaun@jcu.edu.au\nLinking Symbolic Interactionism and\nGrounded Theory Methods in a Research\nDesign: From Corbin and Strauss'\nAssumptions to Action\nJennifer Chamberlain-Salaun1, Jane Mills1, and Kim Usher1\n Keywords\ngrounded theory, symbolic interactionism, research design, methodology, methods\n2 SAGE Open\nHowever, Discovery changed accepted thinking with its\nmethods of inductive theory development.\nSince the introduction of grounded theory, the methodol-\nogy has diverged into three discernible schools of thought, or\nversions: (i) classic grounded theory, which is associated\nwith Barney Glaser; (ii) evolved grounded theory associated\nwith Anselm Strauss, Juliette Corbin, and Adele Clarke; and\n(iii) constructivist grounded theory, which stems from work\nby Kathy Charmaz. In this article, the authors present Corbin\nintroduce the reader to essential grounded theory methods,\nand provide a background to the development of pragmatism\nand symbolic interactionism as the epistemological and\nontological foundations of evolved grounded theory. Rather\nthan elaborating on specific features and differences between\nthe three versions of grounded theory, the authors focus on\nCorbin and Strauss' 16 assumptions of grounded theory\n(2008; Table 1), analyzing them for key symbolic interac-\ntionist themes and their links to essential grounded theory\nmethods. Our purpose is to highlight, particularly for novice\nresearchers and researchers new to grounded theory, the\nlinks between the assumptions and the fundamental contri-\nbution of symbolic interactionism to grounded theory meth-\nodology and methods.\nThe \"Lost Chapter\"\nGrounded theory has its roots in pragmatist philosophy and\nsymbolic interactionist sociology (Bryant, 2009; Charmaz,\nStrauss, 1987). However, until the publication of what we\nterm the \"lost chapter\" in Basics of Qualitative Research:\nTechniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded\nTheory (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), the influence of pragmatist\nphilosophy and sociological symbolic interactionist theory\non evolved grounded theory was not explicitly articulated by\nCorbin and Strauss. In Chapter 1 of the third edition of the\ntext, the authors (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) present 16 assump-\ntions that underpin their version of grounded theory method-\nology. They accompany this list of assumptions with a brief\ndiscussion on the epistemology and ontology of pragmatism\nand symbolic interactionism. Originally written for the sec-\nond edition of Basics of Qualitative Research (Strauss &\nCorbin, 1998), the publisher originally considered this sec-\ntion \"too complicated for a beginning text on qualitative\n16 assumptions in the latest version of the text provides the\nmissing link that formally articulates the philosophical and\nsociological perspectives underlying Strauss and Corbin's\nevolved grounded theory methodology.\nEssential Grounded Theory Methods\nGrounded theory methodologies use a common \"tool box\" of\nmethods in the design and implementation of a study. The\nfollowing constitute this set of essential grounded theory\nmethods: concurrent data generation or collection and analy-\nsis; constant comparative analysis; initial coding and catego-\nrization of data; intermediate coding; selecting a core\ncategory; advanced coding; theoretical integration; theoreti-\ncal sampling, theoretical saturation; theoretical sensitivity;\nand writing memos (memoing) (Birks & Mills, 2011, p. 9).\nUsed together, these methods constitute an unfolding, itera-\ntive process of actions and interactions that constitute the\ngrounded theory research process (Charmaz, 2006).\nIn this article, we link each of the essential grounded\ntheory methods to one or more of Corbin and Strauss'\npostulate that readers who familiarize themselves with their\nbook will \"easily grasp the relevance of the assumptions\nto [their] version of the [grounded theory] methodology\"\n(p. 6). However, we believe \"unpacking\" the assumptions and\ntheir symbolic interactionist themes to explicate the links\nwith essential grounded theory methods will clarify what it\nmeans to implement an evolved grounded theory design.\nThe assumptions are based on Corbin and Strauss'interpreta-\ntion of works by John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, Herbert\nBlumer, and Anselm Strauss himself. All four scholars are\nmembers of a group of sociologists known as the Chicago\nSchool situated within the University of Chicago (Lutters &\nAckerman, 1996). Table 2 provides a synopsis of each schol-\nar's period at the University and highlights periods when\ntheir tenures overlapped. The Chicago School is particularly\nassociated with qualitative methodologies, especially those\nusing a naturalistic observational approach to the study of\nhuman group life and human conduct, such as symbolic\ninteractionism (Blumer, 1969). A general understanding of\nthe evolution of symbolic interactionism, and its precursor\npragmatism, provides a point of departure from which to\napproach the assumptions and their links to essential\ngrounded theory methods.\nPragmatism\nPragmatism is a humanistic movement in philosophy, which\nemphasizes the role of humans in the creation of objective\nand meaningful reality (Shalin, 1991). American pragmatism\nemerged between the 1860s and the end of World War II in\nthe 1940s. During this period, personal material gain was\ndriving American economic and social progress and scholars\nwere demanding that philosophical pursuits extend beyond\ntheory to prove their worth in practice. In a country with a\nmeagre precapitalist past, pragmatism provided the \"philo-\nsophical expression of middle class liberalism\" (Novak,\napplying theory to practice distinguished pragmatist philoso-\nphy from other philosophical positions, which at the time\nwere based on empirical epistemology (Dewey, 1929).\nChamberlain-Salaun et al. 3\nTable 1.

Pragmatism is considered a precursor of symbolic\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism is an empirical social science per-\nspective on the study of human group life and human con-\nduct (Blumer, 1969). Mead is credited with developing\nsymbolic interactionism, although he did not use this term.\nBlumer explains how he himself offhandedly coined the term\nsymbolic interactionism in a chapter he wrote for Man and\nSociety (Blumer, 1937) and that it \"somehow caught on and\nThe theory and conceptualization of symbolic interaction-\nism developed during the period between the late 19th and\nmid-20th centuries within the Chicago School (Deegan,\nthemselves from other social scientists by their shared claim\nto Mead and his original idea that the \"human biological\norganism possesses a mind and a self\" (Herman-Kinney &\ncepts of self, action, and interaction are key interweaving\nthemes that feature in the various interpretations of symbolic\ninteractionism.\nReformulating the 16 Assumptions Into\nThemes\nMeaning and the concepts of action, interaction, self, and\nperspectives are themes of symbolic interactionism that fea-\nture in Corbin and Strauss' assumptions (refer Table 1).\nBlumer's (1969) three premises of symbolic interaction\nhighlight the interconnectedness of each of these themes and\nHuman beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings\nthat the things have for them . . . [T]he meaning of such things is\nderived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has\nwith one's fellows . . . [T]hese meanings are handled in, and\nmodified through, an interpretative process used by the person\nin dealing with the things he encounters. (Blumer, 1969, p. 2)\nThe three themes of meaning, action and interaction, and\nself, together with the subtheme of perspectives are used to\ngroup the 16 assumptions, and to link them with essential\ngrounded theory methods.\nMeaning\nIn the first half of the 20th century, realist philosophy and\npsychological ways (Blumer, 1969) of accounting for the\norigin of meaning were particularly dominant. A realist\naccount of the origin of meaning considers meaning as being\nintrinsic to all things. Thus, a hat is a hat. A psychological\nview of the origin of meaning contends that meaning is an\nexpression of sensations, feelings, memories, ideas, atti-\ntudes, and motives that are brought into play in connection\nwith a person's perception of a thing (Blumer, 1969). Thus, a\nhat may be viewed as a fashion statement or sun protection.\nFrom a symbolic interactionism perspective, objects such as\nhats do not have an innate, permanent character; they cannot\nbe isolated from what happens to them (Mead, 1959).\nMeaning arises in the process of interaction. Meaning is not\nfixed and immutable; it is fluid, modifiable, and open to\nThe process of ascribing meaning (Assumptions 2 and 3)\nto data corresponds to the essential grounded theory methods\nof initial coding and intermediate coding. Continually reas-\nsessing meanings in the data is demonstrated in the essential\ngrounded theory methods of constant comparative analysis\n(Assumptions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8). During the initial and inter-\nmediate coding phases, the researcher ascribes meaning to\ndata through the use of codes. Ascribing meaning is not,\nhowever, an isolated act. Through the process of constantly\ncomparing data codes to codes, codes to categories, and cat-\negories to categories, the researcher interacts with the data,\ncontinually reassessing meaning to \"what is really going on\"\nhighlight the temporal aspects of this process whereby inter-\naction with the data changes previous meanings and gener-\nates new ones. Viewing the data in new contexts is not a\nmatter of simply rejecting past codes and embracing new\nones. It is a process in which previous codes converge into\npresent analysis to advance the developing theory. Mead\n(1959) proposes that \"reality exists in a present\" (p. 1). In\nthis, Mead is not referring to a single reality; rather that the\npresent is the reconstruction of past and imagined future\nactions and interactions. The transformative aspect of con-\nstant comparative analysis is a unique characteristic that\nextends the scope of grounded theory research beyond\ndescriptive analysis.\nA unique feature of grounded theory research is the data\nanalysis method of selecting a core category. It is the point in\nthe grounded theory research process where previous actions,\nwhich led to the development of categories and subcatego-\nries, are aligned (Assumption 14). Until this point in the pro-\ncess, the researcher attributes meaning to data through the\ndevelopment of codes, categories, and subcategories.\nComparable with the concept of locating meaning within sys-\ntems of meanings (Assumption 3), selecting a core category\nrequires the researcher to select an overarching concept that\nencapsulates all previously developed categories and subcat-\negories (Birks & Mills, 2011). This process requires an inti-\nmate and distant relationship to the data and subsequent\ncategories and subcategories. Intimately questioning the\n6 SAGE Open\nmeaning of the data assists the researcher to reach a point\nwhere the grounded theory can be explained and not merely\ndescribed (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Selecting a core category\nalso requires the researcher to stand back from the data, so\nthat, with a wide view lens, they can isolate the common fea-\nture in all the categories and subcategories. Selecting a core\ncategory does not, however, commit meaning to an immuta-\nble state. It is a conceptually abstract representation of a range\nof meanings that an individual, or team of researchers,\nascribes to data to explain a social phenomenon (Corbin &\nStrauss, 2008). Selecting a core category provides the \"hook\"\non which to hang all other categories and subcategories.\nAction and Interaction\nActions arise out of social interaction. Mead (1934) identi-\nfies two forms of social interaction: nonsymbolic and sym-\nbolic. Nonsymbolic interaction is a \"conversation of\nin which individuals respond directly to one another's ges-\ntures or action (Blumer, 1969). Interaction becomes sym-\nbolic when individuals interpret and define objects and their\nown or another's actions and act on the basis of assigned\nmeanings. Symbolic interaction is an interpretive process\nthat directs the actions of the one doing the interpreting and\nconveys to the other, or to one's self, how he or she \"is to act\"\n(Blumer, 1969, p. 66). It is a cyclical and fluid process, in\nwhich participants continually adapt or change their acts to\nfit the ongoing acts of one other.\nThe symbolic interactionism theme of action and interac-\ntion is a feature of all the assumptions, and interacting with\nparticipants, the data, and with one's self are key activities in\ngrounded theory research. Assumption 9 refers to the review\nand evaluation of actions and their influence on future actions\nand interactions. This assumption demonstrates the pro-\ncesses of interaction and action within grounded theory\nmethods of concurrent generation or collection and analysis\nof data, and theoretical sampling. Concurrently generating or\ncollecting and analyzing data requires the researcher to inter-\nact with a first round of study participants and data prior to\nadvancing to the next stage of data collection and analysis.\nThe results of this interactive process direct what and from\nwhom or where the researcher will theoretically sample the\nnext phase of data collection. Data generation, collection and\nanalysis, and theoretical sampling are iterative processes that\ncontinue throughout the research process until a theory is\nfully developed.\nDuring a course of action and interaction, contingencies\nare likely to arise (Assumption 4). In Continual permutations\nof action, Strauss (1993) defines two types of contingencies,\nexternal and internal, that may affect a course of action. The\nfirst are external contingencies such as economic, political,\norganizational, and social world conditions (Assumption 15).\nBeing aware of external conditions that may influence an\nindividual's actions is a consideration when undertaking\nconcurrent data generation and analysis. When comparing\ndata through the process of constant comparative analysis,\npatterns in the data relating to external conditions may\nbecome apparent. The researcher is cautioned, however, not\nand Strauss (1993) suggest using a conditional matrix to con-\nceptualize, discover, and keep track of conditions that influ-\nence the phenomenon being studied. During the intermediate\ncoding phase, when categories and subcategories are devel-\noped, external conditions and their properties, such as time\nand place, are identified and explored. The challenge for the\nresearcher is to explore the effects and interconnectedness of\nexternal conditions on the process of interaction and not\nmerely to rely on conditions to provide a background for\nunderstanding the context of the phenomenon (Strauss,\n1993). The effects and interconnectedness of conditions are\nincorporated into the advanced coding and theoretical inte-\ngration stages when categories and subcategories are inte-\ngrated into a grounded theory that comprehensively explains\nthe phenomenon under study. The second type of contin-\ngency is the course of action itself. Unanticipated conse-\nquences that may arise in any course of action become\nconsequential for pursuant acts. That is, unanticipated conse-\nquences become internal conditions in the process of interac-\nIndividuals are members of multiple social worlds and\nsubworlds and these worlds are not without problematic\ninteractions. Assumption 16 refers to the formation of arenas\nin which problematic interactions between social worlds and\nsubworlds may be discussed, debated, and or resolved\nparticipants' memberships within social worlds/arenas is a\nuseful analytic exercise that \"lays out all of the collective\nresearcher with a view of their own and participants' affilia-\ntions within the broader social context. Understanding the\nbroader social context provides insights into macro-level\ninteractions that may influence individuals and groups of\nindividuals' actions and interactions. It also provides insight\ninto participants' arenas, which as Strauss (1993) states \"are\ncentral to an understanding of `social order'\" (p. 242).\nIdentifying the researcher's and participants' membership\nof social worlds and subworlds occurs, in the case of the\nresearcher, at the very beginning of the research process, and\nin the case of participants during concurrent data collection\nand analysis. Researchers may wish to explore their mem-\nbership of social worlds through the use of memo writing.\nAlthough some researchers confine memo writing to the\ngrounded theory stages between data collection and theory\nunique to data analysis (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), writing\nmemos from the conceptual stages of a research study can\nassist researchers to identify their world-views, member-\nships' of social worlds, and biases. Identifying and reflecting\non these elements can guide methodological decisions,\nChamberlain-Salaun et al. 7\nthereby influencing how essential grounded theory methods\nIdentifying participants'membership of social worlds and\nsubworlds is most likely to occur during concurrent data col-\nlection and analysis, through the collection of demographic\ndata and through discussions with participants in the inter-\nview process. During intermediate coding, understanding\nstudy participants' broader social contexts may assist the\nresearcher to conceptualize how codes previously developed\nin the initial coding phase may relate to each other.\nUnderstanding broader social contexts also provides contex-\ntual variants, which can be included in the storyline during\nadvanced coding and theoretical integration (Birks & Mills,\nThe intrinsic link between actions and emotions is empha-\nsized in Assumption 11. Expressed emotions and feelings are\noften preceded or succeeded by action or inaction; they are\npart of the same flow of events. Recognizing these linkages\nis particularly important when concurrently collecting and\nanalyzing data. Identifying participants' emotions and feel-\nings during data collection and analysis can provide the\nresearcher with cues as to meanings that participants ascribe\nto events and situations relating to the phenomena under\nstudy (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Hoare, Buetow, Mills, and\nFrancis (2012) explore the researcher's role in a study in\nwhichtheresearcherwasbothaparticipantandtheresearcher.\nThe article highlights the duality of the researcher's emic, or\ninsider, perspective and etic, or outsider, perspective.\nDocumenting your own emotions, feelings, and associated\nactions, particularly in light of your emic and etic perspec-\ntives, enables you, as the researcher, to more fully explore\nand challenge your interpretations of the research data. This\nprocess heightens your sensitivity to the data and to the\nresearch process (Birks, Chapman, & Francis, 2008).\nSelf\nThe French anthropologist and sociologist Le Breton (2008)\nrefers to the symbolic interactionism concept of self as \"a\ncorner stone of the conceptual edifice\" (p. 62; translation by\nChamberlain-Salaun).Self is central to all social acts.\nconcept of self differs from the accepted psychological and\nsociological concepts of self, dominant in the first half of the\n20th century, which view self as a definitive stable entity\nof the subjective \"I\" and the objective \"me.\" In other words,\nthe human being is an object to one's self and one's own\nactions. Self is continually constituted through reflexive pro-\ncesses, or self-interaction. The individual is a self-conscious\nbeing able to reflect back on itself and act toward itself as\none may act toward others. The self exists for the individual\ninsofar as the individual assumes the roles of the other\nother, one can view oneself from different perspectives and\ncorrelate these perspectives to make meaning of one's own\ninteractionist dimension of self, whereas the symbolic\ndimension of self refers to the self's \"dependency on the\nsharing of symbols, in particular language, with other selves\"\nSelf is implicit in all of the essential grounded theory\nmethods. However, it is in the act of memoing and in devel-\noping theoretical sensitivity that the symbolic interactionist\nconcept of self predominates. Similar to the stream of con-\nsciousness produced by a character in a Virginia Woolf novel,\nmemos record the researcher's reflexive processes, the inter-\nnal discussions between the \"I\" and \"me,\" while providing\nan audit trail of \"the thinking that goes into [-] decisions and\ntion and its influence on actions and interactions is demon-\nstrated inAssumptions 8 and 9.As highlighted inAssumption\n9, reviews and evaluations made along the action/interaction\ncourse may influence the direction or even recast the course.\nRecording actions, feelings, thoughts, and impressions in the\nform of memos preserves ideas and provides a tangible\nmeans for researchers to review the research process related\nto their study, including decisions made and actions taken\nof the continually constituted reflexive self and can be linked\nto the essential grounded theory method of theoretical sensi-\ntivity. Theoretical sensitivity relates to a researcher's insight\ninto themselves, others, and the area they are researching\n(Glaser & Strauss, 1967). It is demonstrated by a research-\ner's ability to recognize nuances in the data, to extract data\nelements relevant to a developing grounded theory, and to\nreconstruct meaning from data generated with participants\n& Francis, 2006). The act of memoing supports the develop-\nment of theoretical sensitivity. It provides the researcher with\na mechanism for contemporaneously recording and reflect-\ning on their thoughts, feelings, and actions, thus providing\ninsight into themself (Assumption 9). Similar to Mead's self,\nwhich continues to develop throughout a person's life, a\nresearcher's theoretical sensitivity continues to develop\nthroughout the grounded theory research process. An exam-\nple of acquiring theoretical sensitivity in a grounded theory\nstudy is demonstrated in Hoare, Mills, and Francis (2012).\nPerspectives\nA grounded theory research process is not an objective pro-\ncess. Instead it is an interwoven process that integrates the\nphenomenon under study, with the study participants' and\nthe researchers' perspectives and interpretations. An indi-\nvidual's perspective and how they interpret the world, an\nevent or a situation, influences how they act (Blumer, 1969)\n8 SAGE Open\nand this is highlighted in Assumptions 5, 6, 13, and 15. In a\ngrounded theory study, the researcher negotiates divergent\nperspectives within the data to produce an integrated theory.\nConscious awareness of multiple perspectives and how per-\nspectives influence participants' and the researcher's own\nactions and interactions enable the researcher to build varia-\ntion into data analysis, particularly during intermediate and\nadvanced coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Understanding\nhow and why various data elements are interrelated produces\na multi-factorial theory grounded in the data (Silverman,\n2011). During the concurrent data generation and analysis\nand comparative analysis phases, perspectives must be nego-\ntiated (Assumption 6) for action and interaction to proceed.\nIt is at the intersection of actions (Assumption 13), between\ngenerating and analyzing data, that difference among per-\nspectives is highlighted. During initial coding and categori-\nzation of data, the researchers negotiate their own perspective\nof the substantive area of inquiry with that of the partici-\npant's to make meaning of raw data and assign codes. Over\ntime and through the process of intermediate coding, in\nwhich codes are grouped together into categories, the\nresearcher's interpretations of divergent perspectives within\nthe data may change. Mead (1959) refers to the temporal\naspect of perspectives and interpretations in Assumption 5.\nConstant comparative analysis of codes to codes, codes to\ncategories, and categories to categories facilitates and indeed\nimpels the researcher to negotiate and renegotiate perspec-\ntives to advance the developing grounded theory.\nMemoing provides a means through which the researcher\ncan make visible their internal dialogue regarding the nego-\ntiation and integration of their own and participants'perspec-\ntives (Milliken & Schreiber, 2001) and heightens the\nresearcher's theoretical sensitivity (Assumptions 5, 6, and\n13). As previously highlighted, memoing also creates a\nrecord of decision making. This may prove particularly valu-\nable when actions within the research process are perceived,\nby others, as irrational (Assumption 10).\nAssumption 15 draws particular attention to the influ-\nence of social worlds and subworlds membership to indi-\nviduals' perspectives and therefore their interactions with\nothers. As Strauss (Strauss, 1993) points out, memberships\nare often complex, overlapping, contrasting, and conflict-\ning (Assumption 15) and therefore it is \"impossible to ana-\nlyze [interaction] in overly simple terms\" (Strauss, 1993,\np. 181). Exploring participants' and the researcher's own\nmembership of various worlds, within the context of the\nphenomenon under study, may provide information about\nhow and why membership influences individuals' perspec-\ntives and actions. This can be a valuable aspect to consider\nwithin the data when thinking about where, what, and from\nwhom to theoretically sample subsequent data. Individual's\nmembership of social worlds and subworlds may also pro-\nvide conditional contexts when developing properties and\ndimensions of categories and linking categories together\nduring intermediate coding (Birks & Mills, 2011; Strauss,\n1993). However, the process of symbolic interaction can-\nnot be simplified to a dependence on conditions such as\nsocial world memberships. Although social worlds and\nsubworlds influence perspectives and actions, they are\nantecedent conditions and their value is in assisting the\nresearcher to understand individuals' interpretive pro-\ncesses; they do not constitute the process itself (Blumer,\n1969). The process of symbolic interaction occurs in the\npresent when actions are interpreted and direct, adapt, and\nchange ongoing acts.\nThe authors agree with Milliken and Schreiber's (2012) con-\ntention that a conscious awareness and an appreciation of the\ninfluence of symbolic interactionism in grounded theory\nresearch will enhance the researcher's capacity to \"develop a\nuseful, deep, rich, explanatory theory\" (p. 693). Corbin and\nStrauss' (2008) inclusion of Assumption 12 in their original\nlist of assumptions highlights the complex nature of under-\nstanding human action and interaction and suggests that\ngrounded theory, with its inherently symbolic interactionist\nunderpinnings, is an appropriate methodology for under-\nstanding and interpreting human conduct.\nCross Referencing the Assumptions and Essential\nGrounded Theory Methods\nCorbin and Strauss' (2008) assumptions summarize their\ninterpretation of the works of Mead, Blumer, Dewey, and\nStrauss himself. This article in turn represents our inter-\npretation of the links between Corbin and Strauss'\nassumptions and essential grounded theory methods and\nTable 3 provides a cross-referencing overview of link-\nages between these two elements. This cross-referencing\nis, however, by no means definitive and is open to alter-\nnative interpretations.\nTable 3. Cross Referencing of Essential Grounded Theory\nMethods and Assumptions.\nEssential grounded theory method Assumption (refer Table 1)\nConcurrent data generation or\ncollection and analysis\nInitial coding and categorization of\ndata\nSelecting a core category 3, 14\nTheoretical saturation NA\nChamberlain-Salaun et al. 9\nTheoretical Saturation\nTheoretical saturation, which Birks and Mills include in their\nlist of \"essential grounded theory method[s]\" (2011, p. 9), is\nthe point at which categories and subcategories are well\ndeveloped, continued data collection and analysis provide no\nsignificant new insights, and previously identified gaps in\nthe theory are filled (Bloor & Wood, 2006; Corbin & Strauss,\ncross-referenced in Table 3, as the authors do not consider\nthat the method aligns with any of the 16 assumptions.\nConclusion\nIt is important for researchers to establish the philosophical\nfoundations of their research study from the outset. In this\narticle, the authors unpack the 16 assumptions presented in\nCorbin and Strauss' (2008) \"lost chapter.\" Unpacking the\nassumptions highlights the inherent symbolic interactionist\nthemes of meaning, action and interaction, self and perspec-\ntives, and explicates their links with essential grounded the-\nory methods. These linkages are our interpretation and are not\nintended as a prescription for undertaking a research study\nusing Corbin and Strauss' version of grounded theory meth-\nodology. Rather, providing and explicating these linkages\nattempts to clarify what it means to conduct a research study\nusing an evolved grounded theory approach. Awareness and\nan appreciation of the influence of symbolic interactionism to\ngrounded theory methodology and methods will, we hope,\nease the researcher's journey across the methodology bridge.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBaert, P.
