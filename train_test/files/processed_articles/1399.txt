This investigation was designed to identify individual and contextual factors associated with airline passengers'\nalcohol use, and to explore potentially dangerous in-flight alcohol consumption.\nMethods. Passengers waiting to board 24 domestic flights at an international airport in the South Atlantic United States were\nasked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Eighty percent of those approached agreed to participate. Our findings are based\nResults. A majority (84%) of passengers indicated that they did not intend to consume alcoholic beverages on the plane they were\nwaiting to board. Passengers who were more likely to report that they would drink were on longer flights, traveling with friends,\nand anticipating First or Business Class seating. Passengers who had already consumed alcohol that day and those who drank more\noften generally were also more likely to say that they intended to consume alcohol, as were people who thought that in-flight\nalcohol use was enjoyable, acceptable, and unlikely to make jet lag worse. Eighty-nine percent of the passengers who said they\nintended to drink reported that they would purchase one to two drinks.\nConclusions. Very few respondents reported intentions that would pose a risk to others. Future studies should validate alcohol\nconsumption and sample passengers at multiple airports throughout the year.\nThere has been virtually no scientific scrutiny of\nalcohol use among airline passengers.1,2 This topic\nhas received some attention in the lay press, usually\nwhen incidents of ``air rage'' are attributed to excess\nalcohol consumption. Disruptive passenger behavior\ncan range from noncompliance with safety instructions\nto the physical assault of airline staff.\nAlthough there are indications that such incidents\nmay have declined in recent years,3 they were described\nas having reached ``epidemic proportions'' at the\n2000 International Aircraft Safety Symposium.4 The\nInternational Air Transport Association reported a\nfivefold increase in air rage incidents between 1994 and\n1997.5 In that same time period, a voluntary government\nreporting system in the United States recorded an 800%\nincrease in reports of unruly passenger behavior.6\nAlthough it has been acknowledged that too little\nis known about air rage,7 two separate surveys of\nairline employees cited alcohol as its major cause.8,9\nIn the United Kingdom, alcohol was identified\nas a contributory factor in 45% of the incidents\nreported to the government between 1999 and\n2003.3 Similarly, when US officials analyzed a year's\nCorresponding Author: Deborah C. Girasek, MPH, PhD,\nAssociate Professor, Uniformed Services University of the\nHealth Sciences, Department of Preventive Medicine &\nUSA. E-mail: DGirasek@usuhs.edu\nworth of voluntary reports on passenger misconduct,\n``overindulgence in alcoholic beverages'' emerged as\n``the most prevalent contributory factor. . .by far.''4 An\nanalysis of newspaper accounts of air rage cases in\nCanada cited ``drunkenness/being cut off from alcohol''\nas their most common precipitating event.10 Anglin and\ncolleagues have characterized our understanding of this\nproblem as being analogous to ``where the drunk driving\nDisruptive passenger behavior is just one of several\npublic health issues that may be related to airline pas-\nsengers' use of alcohol. Many people drive home from\nairports after deplaning. Almost half of all rental car\nrevenue in the United States is generated at airports,12\nyet we have no data on the proportion of those leav-\ning airports who are intoxicated. In one civil lawsuit\nthat was brought against an airline for overserving\na passenger who went on to drive while intoxicated,\nthe plaintiff's private investigator was reportedly served\n12 drinks while sitting in the first class cabin for a\n90-minute flight.13 In New Mexico, authorities halted\nalcohol sales on two airlines after a recently deplaned\npassenger caused a crash that killed a family of five.14\nHis blood alcohol level was four times the state's legal\nlimit, and witnesses reported that he had been served\nalcohol in-flight despite appearing intoxicated.\nAnother potential concern is a passenger's ability\nto evacuate a commercial aircraft in the event of an\nemergency. In one report of a runway collision that\nresulted in a fire, 76% of the passengers in a Boeing 737\nM\nT\nwere able to escape to safety. Among the fatalities was a\nfirst class passenger with a blood alcohol level of 0.24%,\nwho had not even unfastened his seat belt.2 This issue is\nparticularly relevant for people sitting in the overwing\nexit row, who assume responsibility for operating that\nhatch when they agree to sit in those seats. This task\nhas been documented as challenging from both physical\nWe were also interested in whether airline passengers\nwho drink alcohol are less likely to wear their seat belts,\nas has been documented for automobile occupants.17\u00ad19\nUnbelted airline passengers are at increased risk for\nturbulence injuries, which can be fatal.20 That aspect of\nour study has been published elsewhere.21 In brief, we\nfound that airline passengers who intended to consume\nalcohol on their upcoming flight were twice as likely to\nreport that they ``rarely or never'' wore their seat belts\nwhen the seat belt sign was not illuminated.\nA final reason to increase our understanding of\nairline passengers' alcohol use is that air travelers\nare often advised to forgo alcohol consumption in\nhopes of reducing their risk of developing deep vein\nMethods\nSince the aircraft cabin environment has not been\nstudied in relation to alcohol consumption, we felt it was\nimportant to collect qualitative data before beginning\nour quantitative study. To this end, we held three focus\ngroups with airline passengers. Their input, and our\nreview of the general alcohol literature, resulted in\nthe list of candidate independent variables displayed in\nTable 1. We developed a survey instrument to measure\nthese factors, using standardized items when they were\nTable 1 Factors hypothesized as being associated\nwith airline passengers' alcohol consumption\nPassenger characteristics Situational characteristics\nDemographics Day of week\nFear of flying Time of day\nWater/hydration concerns Flight duration\nMood Purpose of travel\nAlcohol outcome expectancies Work responsibilities*\nPerceived norms Desire to sleep\nPast alcohol consumption Cultural context\nAlcohol dependency Special occasion\nNicotine dependency Heading home or away\nTravel companions\nSite of consumption\nClass of service\nExit row seating\nAisle vs other seating\nDriving after deplaning\nThese variables were added or refined as a result of our focus groups.\nOur survey instrument and study procedures were\napproved by the human subjects committee of the\nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.\nOur questionnaire was distributed to passengers who\nwere waiting to board 24 domestic flights at a major\ninternational airport located in the South Atlantic\nUnited States. Flights were selected to cover a range of\ndestinations, lengths, and dates/times of departure, but\nthose departing before noon were excluded from the\nstudy. Our data were collected from November 2005\nInterviewers were trained to approach all adult\npassengers who appeared to be waiting for the study\nflight. Passengers were eligible if they confirmed that\nthey were ticketed for the study flight, were at least\n21 years of age, could speak and read English or Spanish,\nand were not airline employees. Data collection began\napproximately 2 hours before the flight's scheduled\ndeparture and continued until the flight's last passengers\nhad boarded. Our introduction informed passengers of\nthe study's voluntary and anonymous nature. They were\nalso informed of the study's sponsor, focus (ie, ``airline\npassenger behavior''), length (``less than 10 min'') and\nthe fact that they would receive a gourmet coffee coupon\nworth $3 if they agreed to participate.\nIn an attempt to confirm that reported intentions\nto consume alcohol were well correlated with actual\nin-flight behavior, we provided 20% of passengers with\na $10 gift check and invited them to call a toll-free\nnumber after deplaning. Those who called were asked\nfor their coupon number (ie, so that their responses\ncould be linked to their preflight survey), whether they\nhad consumed any alcohol on the study flight, and (if so)\nthe type and amount. We also purchased alcohol sales\ndata--by flight--from the airline.\nWe used chi-square and t-tests to explore asso-\nciations between independent variables and reported\nintentions to consume alcohol in-flight. Factors with\nbivariate associations of p < 0.10 were entered into a\nlogistic regression model. Three of our four measures\nof usual/past alcohol consumption habits were excluded\ndue to collinearity, and we reduced our model several\ntimes to produce a final model that included only factors\nindependently associated with drinking intentions at the\np < 0.05 level. A Hosmer-Lemeshow test of our fitted\nmodel was also conducted. To account for the possible\neffects of clustering (ie, unmeasured common traits that\nmight be shared by passengers on the same flights),\nwe used the Huber-White robust variance estimator.24\nPotentially dangerous patterns of alcohol consumption\nwill also be described.\nResults\nSample\nOf the 2,013 passengers to whom we offered survey\nwere collected from 96% of those volunteers, resulting\nAirline Passengers' Alcohol Use 313\nin a final sample size of 1,548. Participants are described\nin Table 2.\nFactors Associated with Alcohol Consumption\nFourteen percent ( n = 212) of respondents responded\nthat they intended to consume alcoholic beverages on\nthe flight they were waiting to board. Male passengers\nHispanics (p = 0.03), and respondents who reported\nhigher household incomes ( p < 0.01), were more likely\nto answer this question in the affirmative. Participants\nwere more likely to report drinking intentions if they\nwere not ``jittery right now'' ( p < 0.01) and did not\nagree that ``airlines charge a lot for alcoholic beverages''\n( p < 0.01). The outcome expectancies that were\npositively associated with reported alcohol intentions\nincluded believing that alcohol is: relaxing ( p < 0.01),\nincreases their enjoyment of flying ( p < 0.01), makes\nthem more friendly to the person sitting next to\nthem ( p < 0.01), does not increase their aggressiveness\n( p < 0.01), does not have more of an effect if consumed\nduring a flight (p < 0.01), and does not make jet\nlag worse ( p < 0.01). Our social norm items were\nalso significantly associated with drinking intentions\n[ie, reporting that the respondent would not feel\nembarrassed if other passengers thought they were\ndrunk ( p < 0.01), and thinking that passengers ``should\nfeel free'' to have a couple of drinks when they are flying\n( p < 0.01)]. Most of our questions relating to usual\n(ie, nonaviation) drinking habits were associated with\npreflight drinking intentions: more frequent alcohol use\n( p < 0.01), consuming more drinks on a ``typical'' day\nof drinking ( p < 0.01), frequency of drinking ``five or\nmore drinks on one occasion'' ( p < 0.01), and having\nconsumed a higher number of drinks in a 1 day period\nin the last 12 months ( p < 0.01). Finally, passengers\nwho believed that being sober did not offer a survival\nadvantage in the event of an emergency landing were\nmore likely to report that they intended to drink on the\nflight they were waiting to board ( p < 0.01).\nSituational characteristics that were associated with a\nsignificantly higher likelihood of respondents reporting\nthat they were going to drink on board the plane\nincluded: evening flights ( p < 0.01), longer flights\n( p < 0.01), sitting in First or Business class ( p <\nwork responsibilities on the day of the flight ( p =\nconditions that are associated with alcohol use in the\nUnited States (eg, to a football playoff, to Las Vegas,\non New Year's Eve) ( p = 0.02), and having already\nconsumed alcohol on the day of the flight ( p < 0.01).\nPassenger characteristics that were measured but\nfound to be nonsignificant included age, gender,\neducation, being ``a nervous flyer,'' taking care not\nto get dehydrated when flying, having concerns about\nthe quality of the drinking water served on planes, being\nin a ``bad mood,'' being nicotine-dependent,25 being\nalcohol-dependent, and knowing the fine for interfering\nwith a flight attendant. Nonsignificant contextual factors\nincluded weekend (vs nonweekend), trip purpose,\nintending to sleep, celebrating something, leaving versus\ncoming home, being seated in an emergency exit row,\nhaving a nonaisle seat, and planning to drive home from\nthe airport.\nThe factors that emerged as being significantly\nassociated with intended alcohol consumption after we\nperformed the exploratory regression analyses described\nunder Methods are displayed in Table 3. Our final\nregression model was estimated using data from 1,444\nsurveys, because 7% of study participants were missing\nresponses to key variables.\nWe found that endorsing social norms that condoned\nin-flight drinking, holding positive outcome expectan-\ncies (or not endorsing negative statements about alco-\nhol), traveling with friends, sitting (or hoping to be\nseated) in First or Business Class, longer flights, drinking\nmore alcohol in other contexts, and having consumed\nalcohol earlier in the day were associated with reported\nintentions to drink on the flight that respondents were\nwaiting to board. This same set of variables remained\nsignificant after our standard errors were adjusted for\ncluster sampling.\nDangerous Patterns of Alcohol Use?\nOf those who said they intended to drink, the average\nlevel of consumption reported was 1.6 drinks ( SD =\n1.04). When passenger levels of intended consumption\nwere divided by flight length, 95% of respondents\nreported that they would consume less than one drink\nper hour.\nTable 2 Characteristics of airline passengers in\nsurvey sample\nCharacteristic % ( n)\nTable 3 Fitted regression model predicting intended\nalcohol consumption by airline passengers\nVariable Odds ratio interval p Value\nEnjoy flying more\nwhen drinking\nJetlag worse with\nalcohol\nIt's okay to drink on\nplanes\nDrank today\nIt is worth noting, however, that 14% of respondents\nhad already consumed alcohol on the day of their flight.\nAccording to their surveys, 78% had had one drink, and\nhalf had consumed their last drink within an hour of\ncompleting the survey. Almost half of these passengers\nreported having had their drinks in the airport; a third\nhad had their drinks on a plane.\nThe alcohol use of certain subgroups of airline\npassengers was of particular interest because they pose\na potential threat to other people. These included\npassengers sitting in an overwing (``emergency'') exit\nrow, people with a history of aggressive behavior after\nusing alcohol, and those who planned to drive a motor\nvehicle from their destination airport. Passengers who\nreported that they had gotten into a ``physical fight''\nwhile drinking or right after drinking in the last\n3 years were not significantly more likely to report that\nthey would consume alcohol on their upcoming flight.\nPassengers among that group who did intend to drink,\nhowever, said they would order 2.6 (SD = 2.4) drinks\non average, versus 1.6 (SD = 0.91) for other passengers.\nThree of those who reported a history of fighting after\ndrinking ( n = 49) said that they intended to drink more\nthan a drink per hour.\nAgreeing that, ``Drinking tends to increase my\naggressiveness,'' was negatively associated with intending\nto consume alcohol on the upcoming flight. Two\npassengers who endorsed that statement, however,\nintended to drink more than one drink per hour of\nflight.\nPassengers sitting in overwing exit rows were not\nsignificantly less likely to drink than their fellow\npassengers. The amount of alcohol they said they would\nconsume, however (1.2 drinks on average, SD = 0.44),\nwould not be expected to render them impaired.\nPassengers who expected to drive away from the\nairport upon reaching their final destination did not\ndiffer significantly from nondriving respondents, with\nregard to whether they intended to drink in-flight, or\nthe amount they said they would consume (1.6 drinks,\nSD = 1). Three of these respondents reported that they\nwould consume more than a drink per hour of flight.\nWe collected height and weight data to estimate26\ncrude blood alcohol levels for our respondents. These\ncalculations suggest that three respondents would\nachieve a blood alcohol level that exceeded 0.08 (ie,\nthe legal limit for operating a motor vehicle in the\nUnited States) over the course of their flight (factoring\nin drinks that passengers reported consuming just before\nboarding). One of these passengers said that he planned\nto drive home from his destination airport.\nValidating Our Outcome of Interest\nOur attempts to verify whether reported intentions to\nconsume alcohol in-flight were well correlated with\nactual in-flight consumption met with mixed results. Of\nthe 281 passengers who received gift checks requesting\nthat they participate in a brief telephone survey after\ndeplaning, only 27% ( n = 77) complied. A comparison\nof their preflight intentions to drink and their postflight\nreports, however, showed 91% agreement, which is\nsignificantly higher than would have been expected by\nMore objectively, we were able to purchase data on\nthe number of drinks sold to coach passengers for 18\nof our 24 study flights. These figures correlated with\nthe number of intended drink purchases reported by\nsignificant correlations within two of three categories of\nalcoholic beverages. When we calculated the correlation\nbetween drinks sold per economy passenger and\ndrinks reported per economy survey respondent, our\nAirline Passengers' Alcohol Use 315\nthese results, because our study volunteers represented\nonly a subset of the passengers who actually flew and\nwere eligible to purchase alcohol on-board.\nFinally, the dose response curve observed between\nhow much alcohol respondents said they usually drink,\nand whether they intended to drink on their flight, also\nsuggested that passengers were being candid.\nDiscussion\nSome of the factors that have been associated with\nalcohol consumption in nonaviation contexts (e.g. prior\nhistory of alcohol consumption, product pricing) were\nalso found to operate among this sample of airline\npassengers. Other significant findings may appear\nunique to this setting (eg, perceived association with jet\nlag), but most are consistent with previously recognized\npatterns of association (ie, positive alcohol expectations,\nsocial norms).\nSome variables that usually show association with\nalcohol intake--such as gender--dropped out of our\nmodel. Although it is possible that this pattern is the\nresult of previously identified phenomena (eg, gender\nconvergence operating among this upper socioeconomic\nstatus sample), it may also derive from the aviation\nsetting. Previous studies have shown that drinking\ncontext can have important effects on alcohol intake,27\nand that subgroups of alcohol users prefer to drink in\nThe fact that alcohol dependence was not associated\nwith increased reporting of intention to drink in-flight\nmay be attributable to our measurement tool. CAGE\n(cut down, annoyed, guilty and eye opener) has proven\nto be more valid when applied to clinical (vs. general)\npopulations and is not recommended as a screening test\nfor ``heavy or hazardous drinking.''30,31 Fear of flying\nand nicotine addiction were also nonsignificant, which\nis interesting because there has been speculation that\nairline passengers might self-medicate with alcohol in\nresponse to such stressors.\nAlthough airline passengers' alcohol use has not been\nstudied in the past, our findings share at least two results\nwith the nascent air rage literature. A study of major\nCanadian carriers reported that most events occur on\nflights that exceed 3 hours in length.1 In both Canada\nand the United Kingdom, it has been reported that\npassengers who were traveling with others were more\nlikely to become involved in disruptive incidents.1,32\nLimitations\nThis study has a number of limitations. It relies upon\nself-reports of intentions to consume alcohol. The alcohol\nliterature contains numerous reports which demonstrate\nthat intentions to behave are well associated with\nsubsequent behavior. Such associations are particularly\nlikely when the actions under study follow reported\nintentions closely in time,33 when they are measured in\nthe same referent context,34 and when the behavior is\nunder the respondent's control.\nOur data were collected at one airport in the United\nStates, from one airline's passengers. We did not include\nmorning flights in this study nor did we collect data\nduring the spring or summer. These constraints call\nthe generalizability of our findings into question. When\nour sample is compared to the flying public nationwide,\nthey are similar with regard to travel purpose and\nage distribution but different with regard to traveling\ncompanions, household income, and education.35 For\nthese reasons, it is advisable to focus on the associations\nidentified in this study rather than our prevalence\nestimates.\nThose associations suggest that many of the major\ncovariates of alcohol use on commercial aircraft are\nmodifiable (eg, alcohol expectancies and the amount of\ntime that passengers have access to beverage service in\nflight). Future studies should attempt to measure alcohol\nconsumption directly, expand to multiple airports and\nairlines, and collect data year-round.\nConclusions\nIf the results of future work support the findings of this\nstudy, we might conclude that problematic drinking in\nthe aviation context is relatively rare. This is consistent\nwith studies of air rage, one of which estimated that\npassenger misconduct incident.1 A second investigation\nconcluded that one serious on-board incident occurs for\nevery 2 million passengers carried.3\nIn the United States alone, however, 650 million\npeople fly each year and that number is expected\nto increase. Even small proportions of such a large\npopulation should not be ignored.\n"
