    "reduced_content": "Oral sessions\nnumber (R\n), defined as the average number of secondary infections\nper infectious person in a wholly-susceptible \npopulation without\ninterventions. We also calculated the age- and gender-specific equilib-\nrium prevalence and contributions to R\n. And we assessed the impact\nof interventions by comparing reproduction numbers with and\nwithout them. To assess the feasibility of opportunistic screening,\nwe analysed Market Scan, a commercial health insurance database,\nto determine the proportion of people seeking medical care.\nResults Treating symptomatic men and women who seek care and\nscreening 38% of women aged 15\u00ad24 years during annual examina-\ntions more than halve the reproduction number. The equilibrium\nage- and gender-specific prevalence of infection match those\nobserved in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nMen cause more secondary infections than women (contributing\ntwice as much to R\nin some age groups), and people aged 25\u00ad29\nyears cause as many as those aged 20\u00ad24. Analysis of the Market\nScan database indicates that insured men seek care often enough for\nscreening to have substantial impact. Screening women reduces the\nreproduction number by 3%; screening a similar proportion of\nyoung men would reduce it another 4%.\nConclusions Our modelling suggests that screening men as well as\nwomen and extending the upper age to 29 years may affect chla-\nmydia transmission or sequelae.\nHuman Papillomavirus in Very Young Men Who\nHave Sex with Men and the Potential Benefit from\nVaccination\n4,7G Prestage, *1,2C Fairley, *1,2M Chen. 1School of Population Health, University of\nMelbourne, Carlton, Australia; 2Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Alfred Health,\nCarlton, Australia; 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of\nMelbourne, Parkville, Australia; 4Kirby Institute, University of New South UK, Sydney,\nAustralia; 5Centre for Women's Health, Gender and Society, University of Melbourne,\nCarlton, Australia; 6Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Monash\nUniversity, Clayton, Australia; 7Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society,\nMelbourne, Australia\nBackgroundHomosexually active men are at increased risk for\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV associated anal\ncancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have maximum efficacy in peo-\nple who have not already been infected with HPV. This study aims\nto determine the prevalence of HPV among teenage MSM.\nMethods Same sex attracted males aged 16 to 20 were recruited in\nMelbourne via clinics, universities, community events, media, social\nnetworking and peer recruitment. At baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months\nanal and penile swabs and an oral rinse were obtained to test for 37\nHPV genotypes.\nResults 200 men were recruited. At baseline 39% had at least one\ntype of HPV DNA detected from at least one site. High risk (HR),\nlow risk (LR) and quadrivalent vaccine (QV) preventable types were\n(95% CI: 17\u00ad29%) of men respectively. Multiple types of any, HR,\nLR and QV preventable HPV were detected in 27%, 13%, 11% and\n8% of men respectively. The site specific prevalence of any HPV\ndetected from the oral cavity, penis and anus were 2%, 9% and 31%\nrespectively: the prevalence of QV preventable types at these 3 sites\n30 men who reported never receiving anal sex.

The use of online surveys is warranted as the results were com-\nparable to those of nationally representative population based\nsurveys. Addressing young adults' underlying attitudes towards\ntesting and perceptions of risk could increase their willingness to\ntest for chlamydia.\nStrain Typing to Resolve Repeated Chlamydia\nTrachomatis Infections in Young Heterosexual\nDutch Populations\n1H M G\u00f6tz, 2R J M Bom, 1M Wolfers, 2J S A Fennema, 3I V F van den Broek,\n2A G C L Speksnijder, 2S M Bruisten. 1Division of Infectious Diseases control-GGD, Rotterdam\nRijnmond, The Netherlands; 2Public health servide GGD Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\nNetherlands; 3Epidemiology & Surveillance unit, CIB-RIVM, Bilthoven, The Netherlands\nRepeated infections of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) occur frequently\nin young adults. These may be new infections, or persistent infec-\ntions due to treatment failure or unresolved infections in sex part-\nners. We compared CT multilocus sequence typing (CT-MLST) to\nompA genotyping in discriminating new from persistent Chlamydia\ninfections. Samples from young heterosexual persons were selected\nfrom Dutch screening implementation studies in Amsterdam and\npositive samples at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1) were geno-\nassessed by adding samples from 256 heterosexuals in Amsterdam.\nFor 27 out of 34 persons with repeated infections, full MLST\ntypes were obtained for paired samples. In 17 of these 27 persons a\nmultilocus (n = 13) or single locus variant (n = 4) was found, indicat-\ning new CT infections at T1. For 5 MLST discordant participants,\nthe ompA genovar was identical. The 10 persons with concordant\ntyping results were categorised as treatment failure (5 persons) or\nunresolved infections (5 persons). A minimum spanning tree, gener-\nated from all cases and 256 reference samples showed large and small\nclusters and singletons. Surprisingly, the persons with concordant\nsamples had CT strains that were either unique (singleton) or found\nin small clusters. The median time between T0 and T1 did not differ\nbetween the persons with concordant and discordant samples. The\nnumber of sex partners before T0 however, was higher for the discor-\ndant group. High resolution sequence typing was superior compared\nto ompA typing in discriminating new from persisting Chlamydia\ninfections. Many persons (37%) showed exactly the same Chla-\nmydia strain after 6 months indicating possible treatment failure.\nControlling Chlamydia: Population Modeling to\nAssess Promising Interventions\n1J W Glasser, 1K Owusu-Edusei, 2S N Glick, 1S O Aral, 1T L Gift. 1Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States; 2George Washington University,\nWashington, DC, United States\nBackground Chlamydia is an important public health problem\nassociated with neonatal sequelae, pelvic inflammatory disease,\ninfertility, and ectopic pregnancy.\nMethods Using a population model with 2 genders and ages 15\u00ad44\nyears in 5-year groups, but only heterosexual contacts, we evaluated\nthe impact of actual and hypothetical interventions on chlamydia in\nthe U.S. Parameters were obtained from the literature or estimated\nfrom the National Health and Social Life Survey and Seattle Sex Sur-\nvey.
