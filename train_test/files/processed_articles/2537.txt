In response\nto lower budgets and an increase in insured individu-\nals, some local health departments (LHDs) are explor-\ning ways to be reimbursed for their services by billing\nthird-party payers (public insurance providers such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, and private insurers) for ser-\nvices provided by LHD clinics.\nSome LHDs have already successfully billed third-\nparty payers.

To supplement the Forces\nof Change data and collect more in-depth information\non LHD billing practices, NACCHO also conducted\nkey informant interviews with survey respondents in\nat various levels of billing capacity, from LHDs that do\nnot bill at all to large LHDs with well-developed billing\nprograms.\n Billing at LHDs\nFindings show that most LHDs bill for at least some of\nthe clinical services they provide. Sixty percent bill pri-\nvate and public insurers (Medicaid, Medicare, or both),\n21% bill only public insurers, and 4% bill only private\ninsurers. Fourteen percent of LHDs reported that they\ndo not bill for clinical services.\nAs previous research has shown, LHDs bill third-\nparty payers in part to generate revenue.1,4 Forces of\nChange key informants repeatedly discussed that reim-\nbursements obtained through billing was an important\nfactor sustaining public health services to community\nAuthor Affiliation: Research & Evaluation, National Association of County & City\nHealth Officials, Washington, District of Columbia.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nCorrespondence: Sarah J.

There are [staff]\nthat rely on third-party for their salary and benefits\nand so forth, so [billing allows us] to expand and get\nqualified folks to be able to provide those services . . . .\"\nAnother reported, \"It helps to offset . . . some of our\ncosts. We don't receive near what it costs to run all our\nprograms.\"\nIn addition, some LHDs indicated that billing third-\nparty payers was important to demonstrate steward-\nship to elected officials:\nSo we need to be able to describe what we do, we need\nto be able to describe what it costs to do what we do,\nand we need to be able to show that we are recovering\nevery bit of money that we possibly can before we lean\non tax payer dollars.\nLHDs were most likely to bill for family planning,\nimmunization, and home health; few LHDs billed for\ntobacco cessation programs (Table 1). Across all service\nareas asked, LHDs were most likely to bill both public\nand private insurers.\nIn interviews, LHDs described that they attempt to\nbill for all reimbursable services they provide. How-\never, some also indicated that as a public health orga-\nnization their mission is to provide services that might\nnot be available elsewhere in the community. For in-\nstance, one informant reported:\nI don't know that there are a lot of other of our direct\nservices that really lend themselves to billing. Because\nby-in-large if it's something that insurance will cover\nand it's available in the broader community, we're\nprobably not going to be heavily invested in it.\nThis finding is consistent with other literature that\nshows that LHDs most often provide services to\nvulnerable populations or when no alternative health\ncare provider is available in their communities.5\n Engagement to Increase Third-Party Billing\nWhile some literature reports that LHDs have reduced\ntheir clinical services over time,5 Forces of Change\nfindings show that LHDs are interested in increasing\nbilling to third-party payers. For instance, one infor-\nmant stated, \"We can always do better. I wouldn't say\nthat we're at 100 percent of where I would like to be.\"\nAnother put it simply: \"If we could bill more, we would\nbill more.\"\nSurvey results show similar findings. More than 80%\nof LHDs were planning to increase billing to third-party\npayers (76.9%) or planned to establish billing with\nthird-party payers (4.3%) (Table 2). LHDs that served\nlarger populations were more likely to plan to establish\nbilling with third-party payers than LHDs that served\nsmaller populations.\nEven among LHDs that are not yet billing third-\nparty payers, key informants indicated they realize it is\nimportant for them to start billing to maintain their pro-\ngrams: \"We're definitely going to have to start billing, I\nmean there is no way around it if we want to keep our\nvaccine program going, if we want to have patients at\nall we're going to have to start billing.\"\n Implications\nForces of Change findings show that a large major-\nity of LHDs bill for some clinical services and most\nreport interest in increasing third-party billing.

At the\nsame time, LHDs are being encouraged to move away\nfrom clinical care and toward population-based pre-\nvention. The Institute of Medicine released a report\nthat emphasizes that population-based services, rather\nthan clinical care, have a larger impact on the public's\nhealth.6 The shift away from clinical care and toward\npopulation-based services has been a national trend\nfor decades. For example, NACCHO's Profile surveys\nshow that the percentage of LHDs providing primary\nservices showing big declines are prenatal care (54%\nlarly in the South) continue to provide extensive clinical\nservices.\nSufficient availability of health care providers and\nthe profitably of clinical operations should be consid-\nered when determining whether to continue to pro-\nvide clinical services. The availability of health care\nservices for low-income individuals, including those\ncovered by Medicaid, increased in many communi-\nties as community-based provider programs expanded.\nHowever, some communities continue to rely on LHDs\nas safety net providers, some individuals will remain\nuninsured, and some will continue to seek care at LHDs\nfor various other reasons (eg, confidentiality, high co-\npays, or deductibles). In addition, clinical services can\ngenerate revenue if LHDs provide them efficiently and\ncollect sufficient reimbursement from third-party pay-\ners. In these cases, clinical services are not competing\nfor tax dollars used to fund other services. As the health\ncare landscape evolves, LHDs need to carefully evalu-\nate the financial performance of their clinical operations\nregularly to make informed decisions about whether to\ncontinue, change, or eliminate services.\nBoth reducing clinical services and increasing billing\ncan change the relationship between LHDs and the\ncommunity they serve. For some LHDs, clinical ser-\nvices such as immunizations have been an important\nway for LHDs to be visible in their communities. When\nLHDs discontinue these services, they must look for\nnew ways to demonstrate their value.\nProviding services without regard to insurance sta-\ntus is a long tradition at many LHDs, so shifting to\nbilling for services is a major cultural change for both\npatients and LHD staff. However, for some LHDs, it is\na required change. One Forces of Change respondent\nreported,\nSome of the staff . . . don't like that we can't [provide\nservices] for free anymore. But you know, we have to\npay the bills and we have to be able to pay them a\nsalary. It's just really hard because a lot of the staff have\nbeen here for a very very long time and we never had to\neven question somebody about their income status or\ntheir insurance status. And so it's kind of hard for us to\nget accustomed [to] that too.\nDespite the debate over clinical care, a large propor-\ntion of LHDs are already billing third-party payers and\nmore are interested in increasing their billing capacity.\nResearchers and practitioners have argued that LHDs\nneed additional training, technical assistance, peer sup-\nport, and the exploration of a statewide unified billing\napproach, among other resources to support billing\ncapacity.3 Forces of Change key informants supported\nthis claim: \"If there was some way that someone could\nfigure this all out for us so that it wouldn't take us\nmonths to actually determine what it is that we can bill\nfor.\"\nThe local billing landscape will continue to develop\nover time. Data should be collected on which third-\nparty payers LHDs are billing, for which services and\nthrough which systems, and how much reimbursement\nis being collected compared with the costs of billing to\nbetter prepare LHDs to adapt to the changing local\npublic health and health care landscape.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
