    "abstract": "Abstract\ncategory is impaired in frontal damage (37), is investigated\nby the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, which is commonly\nused and considered as an important indicator of frontal\ndysfunction (38), and is one of the important aspects of\nexecutive function (39). Therefore, in the case of Learning\nTherapy, one possible explanation for the transfer of\ncognitive functions is the improvement of executive\nfunctions during the course of training.\nThe other important result of Learning Therapy is\nimprovement in communication between nursing staff and\nparticipants. Because immediate feedback of participants'\nperformance was required during Learning Therapy, this\ntherapy improves face-to-face verbal communication, and\nthe communication behavior of the nursing staff changed\nduring the course of the daily trainings.\nIt was suggested that, in general, the quality of staff\u00ad\nresident communication is often observed to be less than\noptimal (40\u00ad43). Because nursing home staff perceive them-\nselves as too busy to talk with the residents, they are noted to\nhave low expectations of the residents, leading to low levels\nof social interaction. The residents themselves perceive the\nstaff as too busy to engage in conversation, and feel that they\nshould not bother them unnecessarily (44\u00ad46). Cognitive\nimpairments are correlated with decreased engagement,\nconflict, and distress in nursing home residents (47,48),\nand changing the communicative behavior of the nursing\nstaff could have a strong positive impact on the residents\n(49). Therefore, in the present study, improvement of the\ncognitive function, particularly communication, of the\nlearners may well have resulted from the increased oppor-\ntunity for staff\u00adlearner communication in daily care. This\npoint is one of the limitations of interpretation of the results\nof our study. In this study, we were not able to distinguish\nwhether the source of benefits for the experimental group\nwas the cognitive training itself, the interaction with the\nexperimenters working with the experimental group, or the\nadditional attention received by the experimental group from\nthe nursing home staff. Future investigations attempting to\ndetermine the role of social, emotional, and cognitive factors\nin the training effect are necessary.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by JST/RISTEX, R&D promotion scheme for\nregional proposals promoted by TAO, the 21st Century Center of Excellence\n(COE) Program (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and\nTechnology) entitled ``A Strategic Research and Education Center for an\nIntegrated Approach to Language and Cognition'' (Tohoku University).\nAddress correspondence to Ryuta Kawashima, MD, NICHe, Tohoku\nryuta@idac.tohoku.ac.jp\nREFERENCES\n1.

Recent findings of neuroimaging studies indicate that reading aloud and arithmetic calculation activate\nbilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of reading aloud and\narithmetic calculation, by elderly people who were clinically diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer type, on their brain\nfunctions and activities of daily living.\nMethods. Sixteen experimental and 16 age- and Mini-Mental State Examination score-matched control subjects\nparticipated. The participants in the experimental group were asked to perform a training program using learning tasks in\nreading and arithmetic for 2\u00ad6 days a week. The function of the frontal cortex of the subjects was assessed by FAB at\nbedside (Frontal Assessment Battery).\nResults. After 6 months of training, the FAB score of the experimental group showed a statistically significant im-\nprovement. The FAB score of the control group decreased slightly over the 6-month period, and the difference between\nthe scores of the experimental and control groups was statistically significant. We also observed the restoration of com-\nmunication and independence in the experimental group.\nConclusion. Our results indicate that learning tasks of reading aloud and arithmetic calculation can be used for\ncognitive rehabilitation of dementia patients.\nRECENTLY, the importance of cognitive rehabilitation\nfor patients with dementia has been argued (1). The\naims of cognitive rehabilitation for patients with dementia\ninclude optimizing functioning and well-being, minimizing\nthe risk of excess disability, and preventing the development\nof a malignant social psychology within the patient's family\nand social environment (2). Because memory impairment is\na common attribute of any dementia subtypes, most of the\nintervention programs for dementia care focus on memory\nIn this study, we propose a new intervention program, the\nconcept of which is derived from the knowledge of both brain\nscience and clinical studies. Memory impairment and\ncognitive disturbances, such as aphasia, apraxia and agnosia,\nand disturbance of executive function, are the main cognitive\ndeficits in dementia, and the association cortices, particularly\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, are involved in these\ncognitive functions (7,8). The decrease in regional cerebral\nblood flow (rCBF) in the frontal, parietal, and temporal\nassociation cortices is commonly the case for dementia (9\u00ad\n11). Therefore, cognitive impairments in dementia patients\nmay well result from dysfunction in those association cortices.\nIn human brain-mapping studies, brain areas showing\nincreases in rCBF and metabolism in relation to performance\nof cognitive tasks have usually been reported (12).\nTherefore, we can identify specific cognitive tasks which\nincrease rCBF and metabolism of these association cortices,\nparticularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, from those in\nprevious brain-imaging studies. In this study, we hypothe-\nsized that activation of the association cortices by cognitive\ntasks may well improve rCBF and metabolism of these\ncortices, which lead to improve the function of these cortices.\nTo choose effective cognitive tasks for activation of the\nassociation cortices, we reviewed previous neuroimaging\nstudies published elsewhere and/or those by our laboratory.\nIn this process, we selected brain-activation paradigms that\nsatisfy the following two criteria: a) the paradigms must\nactivate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the\nparietal and temporal association cortices of the bilateral\nhemispheres compared with the resting state, and b) the\nparadigms must be very simple, so that people with senile\ndementia can follow and perform them. Finally, we\nidentified two tasks: a) reading sentences or words aloud\n22), both of which met our above-mentioned criteria.\nTherefore, we prepared two tasks in arithmetic and\nJapanese language, which were systematized basic prob-\nlems in reading and arithmetic, for the training program.\nThe theoretical flaw of our hypothesis is that it is not clear\nwhether activation of brain networks involved in reading and\ncalculations can improve functions of brain network(s)\ninvolved in other cognitive processes. To test our hypothesis\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nand to overcome this problem, we measured the effect of\ncontinuous learning by elderly people with dementia on\ntheir brain functions and activities of daily living. In this\nstudy, we focused mainly on the function of the frontal\ncortex. The limitation of this study is that we could not\ndetermine the role of social, emotional, and cognitive factors\nin the training effect.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nSixteen individuals in the experimental group and 16 in\nthe control group were recruited from a nursing home for the\nelderly, called Eiju-no-Sato, in Fukuoka, Japan. The subjects\nwere randomly assigned to these two groups. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each individual using\nforms approved by the Tohoku University and the\nDeclaration of Helsinki (1975). Clinical diagnostic evalua-\ntion by neurologists and an X-ray computed tomography\nexamination of the brain were performed on each participant.\nIn this study, none of the participants had abnormalities such\nas tumors, cerebral bleeding, cerebral infarction, or patho-\nlogical brain atrophy, on X-ray computed tomography\nexamination. All of the individuals in both groups had\na clinical diagnosis of dementia Alzheimer type (DAT) that\nmet the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th\nedition (DSM-IV). The participants in the learning group\nwere asked to perform a training program using learning\ntasks 2\u00ad6 days a week at learning centers in Eiju-no-Sato.\nTo estimate the change in the cognitive ability of the\nparticipants, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (23)\nand Frontal Assessment Battery at the bedside (FAB) (24)\nwere measured in each participant of each group. In the\nlearning group, the neuropsychological characteristics were\nmeasured prior to the start of the training program (baseline)\nand 6 month after the training program had taken place\n(follow up). In the control group, the same characteristics\nwere measured at the same time as in the learning group.\nThe baseline clinical and neuropsychological characteristics\nof the learning and control participants are summarized in\nTable 1. In addition, ability for verbal communication and\nindependence was estimated in both groups by two in-\ndividual items of scales for mental state and daily living\nactivities for the elderly, named the NM scale (25). Neither\nassessment score showed a statistically significant differ-\nence between the two groups (independent samples t test).\nExcept for the training program, both groups of participants\nhad the same nursing care programs at the same place.\nLearning Tasks\nThe materials for the training program were two tasks in\narithmetic and Japanese language, which were systematized\nbasic problems in reading and arithmetic. We prepared\na wide range of materials, which were used for everyday\nlearning for 4-year-old children to fourth grade elementary\nschool students (that is, 10-year-olds). The problems were\nprinted on both sides of A4-size paper. As for the arithmetic\nproblems, the lowest level was counting practice, and the\nhighest level was three-digit division. As for the Japanese\nlanguage problems, the lowest level was to read and write\nsingle syllables, and the highest level was to read aloud fairy\ntales. Prior to the training program, the appropriate degree of\ndifficulty and workload for each participant were assessed by\na diagnostic test, so that he or she could continue to perform\nthe learning tasks with ease.\nThe participants came to the learning center either on\nsummons by the staff, or on their own initiative every day\nfrom Monday to Saturday. They would complete two to five\nsheets of each task prepared for each individual for that day,\nand their work would be assessed by the staff. The mistakes\nwere corrected by the participants. If they could not solve\na problem by themselves, the staff members stationed\nbetween desks provided sufficient advice for them to be able\nto solve it. The study period ended when the participants\ncompleted each of the problems correctly. The daily learning\ntime for the two tasks was approximately 20 minutes.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe neuropsychological characteristics of both groups\nwere compared using an independent sample t test at baseline\nand at follow-up. A further analysis comparing baseline and\nfollow-up scores separately for the learning and control\ngroups was performed by paired t test. Statistical significance\nwas set at p , .05 for all the comparisons.\nRESULTS\nNeuropsychological Characteristics\nAll the participants in the learning group continued the\nprogram for more than 6 months. The mean (SD) of the\nThe scores of the neuropsychological characteristics at\nbaseline and follow-up are summarized in Figure 1. In the\nlearning group, the FAB score showed a statistically\nsignificant ( p , .05) increase after the training had taken\nplace. However, the MMSE score did not show any\nsignificant changes. In the control group, the MMSE score\nshowed a statistically significant ( p , .05) decrease at\nfollow-up compared with baseline. Nevertheless, the FAB\nscore did not show any significant changes. At follow-up, the\nMMSE and FAB scores for the learning group were\nstatistically significantly ( p , .05) higher than those for\nthe control group. There was no relationship between the\nmagnitude of change in the scores of the neuropsychological\nTable 1.

In the control group, the score for motor series\n(programming) showed a statistically significant ( p , .05)\ndecrease at follow-up compared with baseline. In the learning\ngroup, the score for similarities (conceptualization) showed\na statistically significant (p , .01) increase at follow-up\ncompared with baseline. There was no relationship between\nthe magnitude of change in the scores of the individual items\nof the FAB and the number of training sessions that the\nlearning group participants attended.\nThe scores of the individual items of the NM scale at\nbaseline and follow-up are summarized in Table 3. In the\nlearning group, the score for independence showed a statis-\ntically significant (p , .05) increase at follow-up compared\nwith baseline. Although score for verbal communication\nshowed an increase at follow-up compared with baseline, it\ndid not reach a statistically significant level (p \u00bc .1). In the\ncontrol group, the score for verbal communication showed\na subthreshold decrease at the p \u00bc .1 level at follow-up\ncompared with baseline.\nExamples of the Case Patients\nCase 1.--A 75-year-old man had baseline FAB and\nMMSE scores of 3 and 13, respectively. After the 6-month\ntraining period, his FAB and MMSE scores increased to 10\nand 15, respectively. He showed reactivation of his\ncommunicative ability during the course of training. Before\nthe start of the training, he could only speak a few words, and\nremained motionless in the same place, wearing an anxious\nexpression. After the learning period, his number of spoken\nwords increased, his voice became clearer, and he initiated\nconversation on his own. Moreover, before the learning\nperiod he had to be reminded by the staff about bowel\nmovements, but 3 months after the learning period, he was\nable to go to the toilet by himself.\nCase 2.--A 77-year-old woman had baseline FAB and\nMMSE scores of 5 and 7, respectively. She also showed\nreactivation of her communicative ability during the course\nof training. Before the learning period she almost did not\nconverse at all. She began to speak simple words and, after\n6 months, she could hold a simple conversation, and began\nto return smiles to the staff in corridors.In particular, right\nFigure 1.

In the early stages she came to the\nlearning center in her pajamas; later, she came dressed in\nregular daytime clothing. As learning became more natural for\nher, she began to express thanks for the care given to her, her\nexpression relaxed, and she began to smile in her daily life.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we demonstrated that a training program in\nreading and arithmetic problems, named a Learning Therapy,\nwas effective in dementia care for the improvement of\ncognitive functions. All of the experimental participants\nshowed improvement in verbal communications with the\nnursing staff. In addition, significant improvement was\nobserved in verbal conceptualization with regard to the FAB.\nIt is also important to note that cognitive ability measured by\nMMSE did not decline during the 6-month learning period.\nThe term rehabilitation is defined as a process of active\nchanges aimed at enabling people who are disabled by in-\njury or disease to maintain an optimal level of physical,\npsychological, and social functions (26). Recently, in line\nwith this view, cognitive rehabilitation approaches for\npeople with dementia have been introduced. Because\nmemory impairment is a common attribute of any dementia\nsubtype, most of the intervention programs for dementia care\nhave been focused on memory training (3\u00ad6). Learning\nTherapy has two significant characteristics that distinguish\nthis method from previous methods of cognitive rehabilita-\ntion. One is that this method is not an evidence-based\nmethod; it relies on the theoretical background of the\nknowledge of neuroscience research--that is, solving\narithmetic problems and reading aloud activate bilateral\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. The second is that\nit aims to mediate transfer of the different cognitive func-\ntions within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--that is, from\nreading aloud and solving arithmetic problem functions\ntoward general cognitive functions such as communication,\nindependence, and conceptualization. Although in the\npresent study, DAT patients showed improvement in the\nseveral cognitive functions following daily training in\nreading aloud and solving arithmetic problems.\nIt has been widely recognized that one of the significant\nfunctional roles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is to\ncarry out executive functions. The executive functions\nmediated by the frontal cortex involve planning, selection,\nand ongoing regulation of behavior (27). A number of\nstudies (28,29) reported a deterioration of the executive\nfunctions in DAT, and showed that impairment in perfor-\nmance of a variety of tasks in DAT patients are related to\nexecutive dysfunctions (30). In Learning Therapy, daily\ntraining is focused on reading aloud and solving arithmetic\nproblems. Reading aloud is accomplished by the combina-\ntion of several cognitive processes, for example, recognition\nof the visually presented words, conversion to phonological\nrepresentation from graphic representation of words, analy-\nsis of the meaning of words, and control of pronunciation.\nSolving arithmetic problems is also accomplished by many\ncognitive processes, for example, recognition of visually\npresented numbers, performance of arithmetic operations,\nand control of hand movements. It is obvious that both\nreading aloud and solving arithmetic problems require\nexecutive functions. Neuropsychological studies of children\nwith cognitive disorders indicated that reading disability\nthe impairment of executive functions. In the present study,\nsignificant improvement was observed in verbal conceptu-\nalization with regard to the FAB in the experimental group.\nThe verbal conceptualization test was designed to measure\nthe ability to identify abstract categories (24)."
