Fourteen cats presented with wet or dry-to-wet FIP and six cats presented with dry FIP. GC376 was administered\nsubcutaneously every 12 h at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Cats with neurologic signs were excluded from the study.\nResults Nineteen of 20 cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within 2 weeks of initial treatment. However,\ndisease signs recurred 1\u00ad7 weeks after primary treatment and relapses and new cases were ultimately treated for a\nminimum of 12 weeks. Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1\u00ad7 weeks\nof initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats\nhad recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission. Five kittens aged\n3.3\u00ad4.4 months with wet FIP were treated for 12 weeks and have been in disease remission after stopping treatment\nand at the time of writing for 5\u00ad14 months (mean 11.2 months). A sixth kitten was in remission for 10 weeks after 12\nweeks of treatment, relapsed and is responding to a second round of GC376. The seventh was a 6.8-year-old cat\nwith only mesenteric lymph node involvement that went into remission after three relapses that required progressively\nlonger repeat treatments over a 10 month period. Side effects of treatment included transient stinging upon injection\nand occasional foci of subcutaneous fibrosis and hair loss. There was retarded development and abnormal eruption\nof permanent teeth in cats treated before 16\u00ad18 weeks of age.\nConclusions and relevanceGC376 showed promise in treating cats with certain presentations of FIP and has\nopened the door to targeted antiviral drug therapy.\nCenter for Companion Animal Health, School of Veterinary\nMedicine, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis,\nDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine and Pathobiology, College of\nVeterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA\nDepartment of Chemistry, Wichita State University, Wichita, KS,\nUSA\nDepartment of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology,\nWashington State University, Pullman, WA, USA\nDepartment of Veterinary Medicine and Epidemiology, School\nof Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA\nCorresponding author:\nNiels C Pedersen DVM, PhD, Center for Companion Animal\nHealth, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California,\nEmail: ncpedersen@ucdavis.edu\nOriginal Article\nprotease inhibitors have been highly effective in curing\nHCV infection in people.2 Therefore, it is not surprising\nthat viral protease should also be an attractive target for\nresearch on RNA virus infections of animals. Kim et al\nsynthesized peptidyl compounds that target 3C-like pro-\nteases (3CLpro) and evaluated them for their efficacy\nagainst feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline calicivirus,\nas well as important human RNA viruses that encode\n3CLpro or related 3C protease.3\u00ad6 They identified a series\nof compounds that showed potent inhibitory activity\nagainst various coronaviruses, including FCoV, with a\nwide margin of safety. The in vivo efficacy of their\n3CLpro inhibitors was evaluated in mice infected with\nmurine hepatitis virus A59, a murine coronavirus, and\nfound to cause significant reductions in virus titers and\npathologic lesions.5\nThere are currently no commercially available antivi-\nral drugs for coronavirus infections in people or animals,\nand the studies of Kim et al showed that, as a proof of\nprincipal, inhibition of 3CLpro can lead to suppression\nof coronavirus replication in vivo.4,5 They suggested that\nsome of their 3CLpro inhibitors may be used as thera-\npeutic agents against these important viruses in domes-\ntic and wild cats. This was demonstrated to be the case in\na subsequent study using experimental feline infectious\nperitonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) infection in laboratory\ncats.6 Although experimental FIPV infection is highly\nfatal once the infection reaches a definable stage, 14\u00ad20\ndays of GC376 treatment caused rapid disease remission\nin six cats that has lasted over 12 months at the time of\nwriting in the remainder.\nMaterials and methods\nOfficial protocols\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee and the Clinical Trial Review Board of the\nVeterinary Medical Teaching Hospital Clinical Trials\nCommittee, University of California, Davis. This proto-\ncol detailed the conditions of the testing of a novel pro-\ntease inhibitor, GC376, in client-owned cats. Each owner\nwas required to read and consent to the conditions of the\ntrial (supplementary material).\nOrganization of clinical trial\nThe present study was designed to evaluate the 3CLpro\ninhibitor GC376 in a group of cats with naturally occur-\nring FIP. The study did not incorporate a placebo group,\nbecause, as noted by Miller and Brody,7 `the leading ethi-\ncal position on placebo-controlled clinical trials is that\nwhenever proven effective treatment exists for a given\ncondition, it is unethical to test a new treatment for that\ncondition against placebo'. GC376 was proven to be\nhighly effective in curing cats of experimentally induced\nFIP prior to the study and an effective treatment was\npresumably available. A natural history of disease group\nsubstituted for placebo controls.8 None of the 20 treated\ncats demonstrated lasting favorable responses to treat-\nments they received prior to GC376 therapy.\nInstitutional rules precluded the use of cats obtained\nfrom shelters or similar facilities for research even of this\ntype, thus requiring that all cats be legally owned/\nadopted and treated with strict client consent (supple-\nmentary material). Cats with clinically apparent neuro-\nlogic disease were also not included. Twenty cats from\nvarious regions of the USA, of varying age and with dif-\nferent presenting forms of FIP were ultimately enrolled in\nthe trial. This relatively small group of cats allowed valu-\nable insights into trial design, owner interaction and com-\npliance, monitoring safety and efficacy, establishing a\nminimal dosage regimen, evaluating disease relapses\nduring or following treatment, and determining the clini-\ncal forms of FIP most amenable to treatment. This infor-\nmation will, hopefully, assist in the additional testing\nrequired for licensing and eventual commercialization of\nGC376 and for conducting similar trials of future antiviral\ndrugs for FIPV and other chronic viral infections of cats.\nDescription of treatment cohort\nTwenty cats and their owners were ultimately included\nin the trial and pertinent information on each cat is\ngiven in Table 1 and on the entire trial group in Figure 1.\nCats presented to the study with varying degrees of pre-\ntesting by their primary-care veterinarians. This testing\nusually included a complete blood count (CBC) with\ntotal plasma protein, globulin (G), albumin (A), A:G;\nserum chemistry profile and analysis of effusions,\nincluding total protein, actual or estimated cell count,\nand type of inflammatory cells. Additional testing had\nbeen performed on a small proportion of cats and\nincluded FIPV antibody titers, abdominal or thoracic\nultrasound, biopsies of diseased tissue and quantitative\nreal-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on effusions.\nCats with clinical signs indicative of neurologic\ninvolvement were excluded from the trial based on ear-\nlier unpublished experimental studies with GC376. One\ncat that was a long-term survivor of an earlier pharma-\ncokinetic and efficacy trial of GC376 had a recurrence of\nFIP manifested by neurologic signs 6 months after what\nappeared to be successful treatment of acute infection.6\nThis cat failed to respond to a repeat course of GC376,\nwhich prompted a study of the ability of the drug to pen-\netrate into the brain. GC376 levels in the brains of labora-\ntory cats were only 3% of plasma drug concentrations.\nDisease confirmation\nThe diagnosis of FIP was confirmed at the time of entry\ninto the study based on signalment, clinical history,\nexamination of prior laboratory test results, physical\nexamination and repeat of basic blood and effusion\nanalyses. Manual palpation of the abdomen was usually\nsufficient to identify ascites, enlarged mesenteric lymph\nnodes, enlargement of the cecum and associated\nileo-cecal-colic lymph nodes, masses in the kidneys and\ncolonic infiltration. Manual palpation was augmented,\nwhen necessary, by ultrasonography. Eyes were exam-\nined initially with directed light for any abnormalities in\nthe retina, precipitates in anterior chamber or on the\nback of the cornea, and aqueous flare. The presence of\nocular disease was confirmed when in question by com-\nplete ophthalmoscopic examination conducted by the\nophthalmology service of the Veterinary Medical\nTeaching Hospital (VMTH), UC Davis. The presence of\nFIPV was further confirmed by qRT-PCR,6 either from\nabdominal or thoracic effusions taken at the time of\nadmission or at the time of necropsy. Sequencing of the\nFIPV protease gene was carried out on cats that relapsed\nwhile on therapy, to determine whether potential muta-\ntion conferring drug resistance had occurred.5,6\nThe diagnosis of dry-to-wet FIP in three cats (CT03,\nCT10 and CT14) was based on diffuse enlargement of the\ncolon and histories of loose stools, blood and mucus in the\nstool, straining to defecate and small-caliber stools prior to\noccurrence of abdominal effusions. Colonic FIP has been\ndescribed as a specific variant form of non-\neffusive FIP.9\nDry-to-wet FIP was also suspected in cats CT01, CT02 and\nCT12, owing to a stunting of growth that preceded the\nappearance of abdominal effusions by many weeks.\nTreatment regimen\nGC376 was synthesized in a highly pure form and formu-\nlated at a concentration of 53 mg/ml in 10% ethanol and\nGC376 was administered subcutaneously (SC) at a\nTable 1 Signalment, environmental origin, major presenting clinical signs and principal lesions found at necropsy\nfollowing treatment with GC376 protease inhibitor\nID/name Age\n(months)\nWeight\n(kg)\nSex Breed Origin Presenting signs Clinical status/necropsy lesions\nGross Histologic\nCT02 (Cate) 6 2.67 FS DLH KR Peritonitis, stunted \u00ad B, E, Int, L, MLN\nCT03 (Pancake) 7.86 3.18 MC Him Cattery Dry (Col) to wet + Int, L, MLN, S, Om, P\nCT07 (Mac) 6.6 2.6 MC DSH KR Dry (Col) + E, Int, L, MLN, S, K, A,\nLu\nOm, P, Lu\nCT12 (Daisy) 7.5 2.5 FS DSH KR Peritonitis, stunted \u00ad B, Int, L, S\nCT13 (Leo) 7.4 1.97 MC Sphynx Cattery Dry (E, K) + B, E, Int, L, MLN, S, K\nCT14 (Muffin) 8 2.94 FS DSH KR Dry (Col) to wet + E, Int, L, MLN, K, Om, P\nCT16 (Bean) 4 1.4 FS DSH KR Peritonitis, stunted + B, E, Int, L, MLN, S,\nOm, P\nretreat\nCT22 (Pepper) 3.3 1.6 F Siberian Cattery Peritonitis + B, E, Om, MLN, Lu, Dia\nFS = female spayed; F = entire female; DSH = domestic shorthair; KR = kitten rescue; B = brain; Int = intestine; DLH = domestic longhair;\nE = eye; L = liver; MLN = mesenteric lymph nodes; Him = Himalayan; Col = colon; S = spleen; Om = omentum; P = peritoneum; MC = male\ncastrated; M = entire male; K = kidney; A = adrenal gland; Lu = lung; FC = feral colony; RM = Ragmuffin; Dia = diaphragm\n*No necropsy performed but terminal neurologic signs\nSevere cerebral edema, no typical inflammatory lesions noted\ndosage of 15 mg/kg q12h SC, unless stated otherwise.\nThe effective dosage for cats with experimentally induced\nFIP was 10 mg/kg/ q12h SC, but the dosage was raised\nto 15 mg/kg after the first cat (CT01) failed to respond to\na lower dose of 10 mg/kg suggested by earlier pharma-\ncokinetic studies.6 This was a clinical decision based on\nthis one cat's response to treatment.\nMonitoring response to treatment Cats with FIP based on\npretesting and initial evaluation at the time of presenta-\ntion to UC Davis were hospitalized for at least 5 days\nand immediately started on treatment. They were closely\nevaluated at least twice daily for rectal temperature,\npulse, respiration, appetite and activity. Clumping litter\nwas used, allowing for daily evaluation of stool volume\nand consistency, and urination. Whole blood was col-\nlected in EDTA or heparin by venepuncture prior to\nstarting treatment, at 2 day intervals while hospitalized,\nat the time of discharge and at 2 week intervals for the\nfirst month and at monthly or greater intervals thereaf-\nter. Routine blood testing at each time point included at\na minimum a hematocrit, total plasma protein, icterus\nindex, total white blood cell count, differential white\nblood cell percentages, and absolute neutrophil, lym-\nphocyte, and monocyte and eosinophil counts. Blood\nserum chemistry values were taken periodically to check\nfor potential drug toxicities. Samples of abdominal\neffusions were obtained by paracentesis every other day\nif obtainable, which was usually for the first 3\u00ad7 days.\nCats presenting with dyspnea were examined by thoracic\nultrasonography and a fluid sample obtained by\nultrasound-guided paracentesis. Effusions were exam-\nined for presence of fibrinous precipitates, an admixture\nof neutrophils and small/large mononuclear cells, inten-\nsity of yellow discoloration, viscosity by threading and\ntotal protein content. Cell pellets from peritoneal or tho-\nracic effusions were also examined by qRT-PCR for viral\nRNA levels as previously described.6\nCats were discharged to their owners when a positive\nresponse to treatment was noted, usually within 5 days.\nThe owner(s) were instructed either by the trial veteri-\nnarian or primary-care veterinarian on how to adminis-\nter the medication twice a day by subcutaneous injection.\nInjection sites were varied to include the topline from the\nnape to the mid-back and on the sides of the chest and\nflanks. Care was taken to avoid depositing drug into the\ndermis or sequentially at the same subcutaneous site.\nOwners were encouraged to keep daily logs on rectal\ntemperature, activity, appetite, defecation and urination,\nand weekly to bi-weekly body weights. Periodic blood\nsamples for CBC and serum chemistry values were\nobtained by the owners' personal veterinarians and sent\nFigure 1 Demographics of cats enrolled in the trial.

Any\nabnormal signs or behaviors were to be noted and\npromptly reported. Euthanasia, when required, was con-\nducted either at UC Davis or by the primary-care veteri-\nnarian. Bodies of cats euthanized by primary-care\nveterinarians were immediately refrigerated and sent on\nice packs by overnight express mail to UC Davis for nec-\nropsy. The owners' request for care and final disposition\nof the body was honored.\nResults\nDetermining the duration of treatment\nThe first five cats in the trial were treated initially for 2\nimprovement in health was observed in all cats and treat-\nment was stopped. Despite the favorable initial response,\n7 (CT02) weeks after the 2 week treatments ended (Figure\n2). The cats were then retreated, the rationale being to\nprogressively extend primary and secondary treatment\nperiods for as long as their FIP remained responsive to\ndisease signs reappeared while on treatment. Cat CT08\ndeveloped neurologic disease, whereas cat CT16 had a\nrecurrence of abdominal lesions (Table 1). The primary\nand secondary treatment periods were then extended to\ndeveloped neurologic signs during the 9 week primary\ntreatment and was eventually euthanized when disease\nsigns became severe. Cat CT07 developed neurologic dis-\nease 6 weeks after starting the second treatment. At that\npoint, all new cats admitted to the trial, and earlier cats\nsuch as CT10, were treated or retreated for at least 12\nweeks. The benefit of 12 weeks of treatment was most\napparent in cat CT04 that had been treated three other\ntimes for shorter periods and then eventually relapsed\n(Figure 2). Treatment was stopped in cats that had no\nclinical or laboratory disease signs after 12 weeks of\neither primary or secondary treatments. It was deter-\nmined that a minimum treatment period should be\nbecause of delayed improvement in total protein and\nwhite blood cell counts (Figure 2). This cat suffered a\nrelapse of pleural FIP 13 weeks later and is at the time of\nwriting receiving more treatment.\nResponse to initial treatment and favorable\nresponse indicators\nA dramatic and progressive improvement in health was\nFigure 2 The time scale for treatment and clinical outcome of 20 cats entered into a field trial of GC376 protease inhibitor.\nPeriods during which cats were treated are identified by solid lines. The date of the last day of treatment for the six cats that\nachieved a sustained clinical remission is indicated. Cat 21 was still on treatment at the time of writing. The remaining 13\ncats succumbed to non-neurologic (FIP) or neurologic FIP (neuro-FIP) after being off primary or secondary treatments for\ntreatment. The exception was cat CT16, which responded\nwith a decrease in rectal temperature during the first\n4 days of treatment. However, the fever returned and\nhealth continued to deteriorate over the next 23 days and\nthe cat was euthanized. The fever (>102.5\u00b0F) in the other\nallel improvement in appetite, activity, growth and weight\ngain. Abdominal effusions were usually non-detectable\nwithin 2 weeks. The residual thoracic effusion remaining\nafter initial therapeutic drainage was largely gone after 3\ndecreased rapidly in size and were non-palpable after 2\nweeks. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were somewhat\nslower to return to normal size. Palpable thickening of the\ncolon and associated ileo-cecal-colic masses were the\nslowest to resolve and colonic signs persisted in cat CT03\nin the face of treatment and a return to otherwise normal\nhealth. Jaundice, a frequent finding in younger cats with\neffusive FIP, slowly resolved over 2 weeks or more, in par-\nallel with decreasing hyperbilirubinemia. Signs of ocular\ndisease began to clear within 48 h and were gone by 1\nweek, regardless of initial severity (Figure 3).\nWeight gain was a simple and accurate measure of\ngrowth and improvement of health. The value of monitor-\ning this parameter was typified by CT04, the oldest cat in\nthe trial (Figure 4a). Cat CT04 presented with significant\nweight loss of 30%. It gained weight after each round of\ntreatment, began to lose weight shortly before each disease\nrelapse, and regained and added to its weight after each\ntreatment. It regained all its lost weight after 9.3 months off\nand on treatment (4.8 kg to 7.19 kg).All kittens in sustained\nremission steadily gained weight during and after antivi-\nral treatment, indicating normal growth continued with\nantiviral treatment (Figure 4b). One long-term survivor\ncomplications during their disease remissions.\nLymphopenia was a common presenting clinical fea-\nture of cats with wet FIP (Figure 5), and tended to be\ndirectly correlated with the severity of abdominal\ninflammation, as indicated by the viscosity, presence of\nfibrin tags, protein content, cell count and degree of yel-\nlow coloring of the effusion. Lymphopenia improved\nwith treatment in all the cats with wet FIP except CT16,\nbut it was not helpful in predicting disease relapses that\noccurred thereafter (Figure 5a). Lymphopenia was not as\nevident in cats with dry FIP and not as helpful as other\nparameters in assessing treatment response (Figure 5b).\nTotal plasma protein levels as an indirect measure of\nglobulin concentration were frequently elevated at pres-\nentation, but the values were highly variable over the\nfirst 4 weeks and often increased transiently during the\nresorption of effusions. Cats that ultimately failed treat-\nment tended to have higher total plasma protein concen-\ntrations at the onset of treatment and tended to maintain\nhigher levels during treatment than cats that success-\nfully achieved sustained remission (Figure 6).\nDecrease in viral RNA levels in cells from ascitic\nfluid associated with treatment\nSequential ascites samples were collected from some of\nthese same cats over the first 6\u00ad25 days of antiviral treat-\nment and tested for levels of viral RNA by qRT-PCR.\nFIPV levels are frequently low or negative in blood from\ncats with FIP and are highest in cells from effusions.10\nTherefore, cells from ascites or pleural effusions were\nthe most reliable source of FIPV RNA. Cats CT15, CT16\nviral RNA, respectively, than CT02, which had the low-\nest virus load in effusion prior to treatment (Figure 7).\nwithin 2 weeks compared with pretreatment values,\nexcept for cat CT16 (Figure 8), which had the second\nhighest viral RNA levels prior to antiviral treatment\namong the 12 cats with effusion samples available for\ntesting (Figure 7). The failure of viral RNA levels of\nCT16 to rapidly decrease, along with severe lymphope-\nnia, may explain why it did not respond to treatment.\nCT10 also had a somewhat slower drop in virus levels\nand relapsed twice after antiviral treatment. It is note-\nworthy that viral RNA levels in ascites cells from cats\nalso among the five cats that went into a sustained dis-\nease remission. Whether this was a property of the indi-\nvidual FIPV isolates or the form and severity of the\nhost's disease was not determined.\nTreatment failure due to recurrence of abdominal\nFIP or occurrence of neurologic disease\nThirteen of 20 cats in the trial ultimately succumbed to\nrecurrence of disease. One cat (CT16) failed to show sig-\nnificant improvement and was euthanized 3 weeks after\nFigure 3 Appearance of the eyes of cat CT08 before starting\ntreatment (a) and 1 week later (b). This cat developed severe\nneurologic signs 3 weeks after starting treatment\nstarting a 4 week treatment regimen (Figures 2 and 8),\nwhereas the other 12 experienced variable periods of\ndisease remission following primary or secondary\ntreatment lasting from 3\u00ad17 weeks (average 7.8 weeks)\n(Figure 2). All but one (CT09) of these 13 cats was\nnecropsied (Table 1). Eight of these cats were euthanized\nbecause of severe neurologic signs and five because of\nrecurrences of abdominal disease (Figure 2). Three of\nthe cats that succumbed to neurologic disease (CT05,\nCT08, CT13) presented because of ocular FIP or ocular\ninvolvement was detected secondarily on examination\n(Table 1). The earliest signs of neurologic disease\nincluded fever that persisted in the face of continued\ntreatment, listlessness, sporadic muscle twitches of ears\nand muscles, abnormal swallowing movements, com-\npulsive stretching of the limbs and loss of normal men-\ntation indicated by brief staring episodes or withdrawal.\nThese signs persisted in the face of treatment for days\nor weeks, but ultimately progressed to incoordination\nand tonic/clonic seizures. The appearance and rapid\nprogression of neurologic signs was more apt to occur\nafter discontinuation of treatment than during treat-\nment (Figure 2).\nrecurrence of typical intra-abdominal lesions in the\nabsence of neurologic signs during or after treatment\n(Table 1). Four of them presented with ileocecal masses\nCT14) or became no longer palpable (CT07) following\nprimary treatment. However, CT03 continued to suffer\nfrom severe constipation, straining and toothpaste-like\nstool. The severity of the colonic obstruction necessitated\na colon resection, which relieved the clinical signs but did\nnot prevent eventual recurrence of abdominal disease.\nAll three cats that presented with severe ileo-cecal-colic\nFigure 4 Antiviral treatment and body weight changes.

Cat CT01 presented with effusive\nFIP and was initially treated with GC376 (10 mg/kg\nq12h SC for 9 days). The cat responded well, but fever\nreturned on day 9 and the dosage was increased to 15\nmg/kg q12h for 5 days. The fever disappeared and treat-\nment was stopped at day 14. Fever returned 3 days later\nalong with vague neurologic signs consisting of muscle\ntwitching, abnormal limb stretching and abnormal\nFigure 6 Mean and SD of total plasma protein levels among 20 cats over a 12 week period.

The cat was immediately put back\non treatment at a dosage of 15 mg/kg q12h SC and its\ncondition improved but shortly worsened with return of\nfever and the same vague neurologic signs with mild\nincoordination. The dosage was then increased to 50\nmg/kg q12h SC for 14 days and its condition improved\nto near normal. Treatment was stopped but neurologic\nsigns immediately returned. The cat was then treated for\nfour additional days at 50 mg/kg q12h SC, during which\ntime the neurologic signs once again improved. However,\na decision was made to stop all treatment after that time.\nThe cat's condition remained stable for 1 week and then\nthe cat developed extreme incoordination, dementia and\ntonic/clonic seizures. Euthanasia was performed and a\nnecropsy demonstrated lesions only in the brain.\nCat CT12 responded well to treatment at a dosage of\n15 mg/kg q12h SC; the rectal temperature returned to\nnormal within 48 h and the abdominal effusion disap-\npeared within 2 weeks. The cat appeared normal after\nthe second week of treatment but then developed a per-\nwas otherwise normal in activity and appetite so the\ntreatment was continued at the same dosage. However,\nthe fever persisted, subtle behavior signs were noted and\nthe cat failed to grow as expected. The cat continued\ntreatment for 15 more weeks during which time the drug\ndosage was transiently decreased twice (ie, to 10 mg/kg\nincreased and activity decreased each time and the 15\nmg/kg q12h dosage was reinstituted. The cat continued\nto show signs of variable fever and vague behavioral\nsigns, but the owners were optimistic about the cat's\nappetite and level of activity. The cat's treatment was\nthen stopped as further use of the drug for this purpose\ncould not be justified. The cat's condition remained\nunchanged with persistent fever, reclusive behavior and\nfailure to grow for another 5 weeks. Severe neurologic\nsigns consisting of incoordination, dementia and sei-\nzures appeared at week 22 and the cat was euthanized.\nGross and microscopic lesions were limited to the brain.\nTesting for the emergence of viral resistance\nThe emergence of a drug-resistant virus was considered\nin cat CT03, which relapsed with abdominal lesions after\nan initial favorable response to granulomatous colitis\nand dry-to-wet abdominal FIP. Granulomatous lesions\nwere still present in the abdomen at the time of necropsy\nand no gross or microscopic lesions were found in the\nbrain (Table 1). Therefore, disease recurrence was not\nrelated to neurologic disease and persistent FIPV anti-\ngen was identified in macrophages in granulomatous\nlesions. A sequence comparison was performed between\nthe 3CLpro of the pretreatment effusions and omentum\ncollected at necropsy 95 days later. However, no amino-\nacid substitution was found in 3CLpro, indicating that\nthe emergence of a drug-resistant virus was not the cause\nof the cat's recurrent disease.\nThe 3CLpro sequences of pretreatment viral RNA\nwere also compared. No differences were observed in\n3CLpro over this time. Sequences also remained\npresentation to necropsy. The viral 3CLpro from lung and\nspleen of cat CT10, which relapsed twice over 8 months\nand retreated, had an Asp-to-Ser substitution at position\n25 and a Lys-to-Asp substitution at position 260 com-\npared with virus from pre-treatment abdominal fluid.\nThe exact effects of these mutations on protease function\nare currently being investigated. It is reported that genetic\nevolution of viral protein quasi-species arises over time\nin patients chronically infected with an RNAvirus (HCV)\nand may lead to sporadic amino acid changes.11\nOccurrence of sustained clinical remissions\nSeven of the 20 cats in the GC376 treatment trial, all of\nwhich received at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment,\nwere categorized as potential treatment successes based\non more than 12 weeks of disease remission \nfollowing ces-\nsation of treatment (Figure 2). Six of these kittens pre-\nsented with acute effusive disease of the abdomen (CT15,\nof age and were treated continuously for 12 or 17 (cat\n6.8-year-old random-bred castrated male presenting with\ndry FIP limited to a mesenteric lymph node, also achieved\nFigure 9 Section from the greatly thickened wall of resected\ncolon from cat CT03.

However, cat CT21 still\nhad elevated plasma protein levels and an increased\nwhite cell count after 12 weeks and was continued on\ntreatment for another 5 weeks. Plasma protein and white\ncell counts were improved after 5 additional weeks of\ntreatment but still not within normal parameters.\nThirteen weeks after stopping treatment the cat devel-\noped a typical FIP effusion in the chest with fever. The\nchest fluid was drained to improve breathing and the cat\nstarted on a second round of GC376 and and at the time\nof writing was afebrile, active and eating normally after\n8 weeks of treatment. Treatment will last for 12 weeks if\nno signs of disease reappear.\nSide effects observed during and after treatment\nTwo side effects of consequence were observed during\nand after treatment with GC376. The drug often caused\nstinging on injection. Subcutaneous swellings occurred\nwhen too many injections were given in the same site but\nrapidly resolved. A deep localized ulceration occurred\nbetween the shoulder blades in one cat (CT12) at about\nweek 14 of an 18 week treatment period. However, no\nevidence of dermal FIP was observed at necropsy and it\nwas most likely a response to continuous injections into\nthe same site. A survey of the seven long-term survivors\ndemonstrated a palpable focal subcutaneous thickening.\nFour pea-sized nodules between the shoulder blades in\none cat were calcified on radiographs. These nodules\nalong with some surrounding fibrous tissue were surgi-\ncally removed. Three other long-term survivors have 1\u00ad3\nsmall focal areas of permanent hair loss in injection sites\nthat are obscured by the surrounding coat (Figure 10).\nThe owners and their veterinarians were asked to peri-\nodically inspect these lesions for any changes in charac-\nter and to check for any new ones.\nThe most consequential side effect associated with\nlong-term treatment involved juvenile dentition. The\nnormal formation, growth and eruption of permanent\nteeth were delayed in all four kittens that were treated\nstarting at 3.3\u00ad4.4 months of age. The canines, incisors,\nfourth premolars and molars were the least affected,\nwhereas second and third premolars were the most\naffected (Figure 11). The adult teeth appeared smaller\nthan normal and this coupled with delayed eruption led\nto either retention of deciduous canines, failure of decid-\nuous teeth to be shed or partial eruption of abnormal\npermanent teeth lingual to retained deciduous teeth. No\nother anatomic or physiologic defects have been\nobserved in any of the long-term survivors or noted on\nthose cats that were necropsied.\nNecropsy findings\nThe bodies of 12/13 cats that ultimately failed treatment\nwere submitted for necropsy including gross and histo-\nlogic examination and immunohistochemistry on dis-\neased tissues for FIPV antigen. Tissues collected and\nexamined included representative sections of all major\nFigure 10 A focal area of permanent hair loss caused by\ninadvertent deposition of GC376 in the epidermis of cat CT21.\nThese areas were usually covered by hair and not outwardly\nvisible\nFigure 11 The adult dentition of cat CT17, which was treated\nThere is retention of the upper left deciduous canine. The\nupper second and third premolars appear to be deciduous.\nSmall permanent third premolars have partially erupted\nlingual to the deciduous third upper premolars. The gingiva\nsurrounding the retained canine and premolars is inflamed.\nThe adult canines also appear smaller than normal. The\npermanent right canine and fourth upper premolars appear\nto have erupted normally\nabdominal and thoracic organs, brain and eye. Gross\nexamination identified three distinct presentations. Five\ncats had no gross evidence of active FIP (CT01, CT02,\nperitonitis with multiorgan involvement (CT03, CT14,\nCT16, CT22). Histology of the five cats lacking gross evi-\ndence of disease demonstrated mostly mild mononuclear\ninfiltrates, usually perivascular inflammation in the eye,\nliver, intestinal wall and kidney. The three cats with non-\neffusive FIP had mild-to-severe inflammation in many\norgans with the most severe lesions occurring in the eye,\nmesenteric lymph nodes, kidney and lung. The three cats\nwith effusive FIP had severe pyogranulomatous\ninflammation in multiple abdominal organs including\nthe omentum, peritoneum, intestinal wall, mesenteric\nlymph nodes, liver and spleen.\nSevere inflammation stereotypic of cerebral FIP was\npresent in the brains of all but one (CT07) of the eight\ncats that presented to necropsy with no gross evidence of\nFIP or with non-effusive FIP. The one cat without charac-\nteristic brain lesions had severe cerebral edema. In con-\ntrast, typical FIP lesions were absent in the brains of all\nthree cats that presented to necropsy with effusive FIP.\nStereotypic FIP lesions of the brain were characterized\nby moderate-to-severe chronic meningoencephalitis and\nventriculitis associated with periventricular parenchy-\nmal necrosis (Figure 12a). The fourth ventricle was most\nseverely affected and meningitis was most commonly\nobserved ventral to the cerebellum and brainstem. Thick\nperivascular cuffs associated with vasculitis were fre-\nquently observed. FIP antigen was demonstrated by\nimmunoperoxidase staining in the brain of 6/7 cases\nwith stereotypic cerebral FIP (Figure 12b). Tissues from\nthe 11 cats that were necropsied were tested for the pres-\nence of FIPV RNA by qRT-PCR. All of them tested posi-\ntive thus establishing the persistence of virus in cats\nfailing treatment.\nDiscussion\nSuccess with GC376 treatment against experimental\nFIPV infection prompted us to investigate whether\nGC376 could be equally efficacious against naturally\noccurring FIP.6 There are significant differences between\nexperimental effusive abdominal FIP and the naturally\noccurring disease. Experimental disease bypasses the\ncritical early stage that starts as kittens with exposure to\nan innocuous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV).12\nNaturally occurring FIP results from specific mutants\nthat arise following FECV infection and FIP occurs in the\npresence of FECV immunity.13,14 Experimental FIP, in\ncontrast, is induced in coronavirus na\u00efve cats by an intra-\nperitoneal injection of a large dose of laboratory cat-\npassaged and purified FIPV. Naturally occurring disease\nis often subclinical for many weeks or months before\noutward signs of disease are observed, whereas experi-\nmental disease signs appear within 2\u00ad4 weeks and rap-\nidly progresses. Naturally occurring FIP presents in a\nvariety of clinical forms, whereas the experimental infec-\ntion is almost always effusive and abdominal. FIP in\nnature is also affected by a milieu of disease enhancing\ncofactors, while experimental disease occurs in cats that\nare free of such extraneous influences.15 Differences may\nexplain why a small proportion of cats naturally exposed\nto FIPVs develop disease, whereas 80\u00ad100% of experi-\nmentally infected cats die.15,16 Our predictions proved\ncorrect and naturally occurring FIP was much more dif-\nficult to treat than the experimental disease. It must be\nstressed, however, that this trial would not have been\nFigure 12 Photomicrographs of a lesion in the brain of cat\nCT08. This cat developed severe neurologic disease while\non initial GC376 treatment. (a) The fourth ventricle contains\nproteinaceous fluid admixed with numerous neutrophils and\nmacrophages that multifocally extend into the surrounding\nrarefied neuropil. Large cuffs of lymphocytes and plasma\ncells surround blood vessels (*) (hematoxylin stain, \u00d7 20\nmagnification). (b) Multiple cells resembling peritoneal\nmacrophages (outlined by the small rectange in box in\nFigure 4a) demonstrate positive immunoreactivity for feline\ninfectious peritonitis antigen (hematoxylin counterstain, \u00d7 600\nmagnification)\napproved without the information obtained from phar-\nmacokinetic, acute and chronic toxicity, and efficacy\nstudies conducted on laboratory cats.\nThis was the first attempt to use a targeted antiviral\ndrug against a systemic and highly fatal disease of vet-\nerinary importance. Although no specific antiviral drugs\nare yet available for coronavirus infections in people or\nanimals, antiviral drugs for other viral infections of peo-\nple, such as HCV and HIV-1, have been developed for\ntreatment and the use of these drugs provided a sound\nbase for their application to animal diseases such as FIP.\nHCV mainly infects liver cells, causing persistent viral\ninfection in a majority of people. However, only about\nHCV infection can be cleared with non-specific antiviral\ntreatment (interferon and ribavirin) over 6\u00ad12 months in\nabout half of patients, and recent introduction of direct-\nacting antiviral drugs of 3\u00ad6 months, duration consider-\nably increased the cure rate to more than 90%.2 HIV\ninfection in people leads to a prolonged asymptomatic\nstate and eventually to advanced HIV disease. HIV-1\ninfects T cells and macrophges and survives in a latent\nstate. More than 30 antiretroviral drugs, most of them\nused in combinations of two or more drugs, have been\nsuccessfully used to reduce viral load to undetectable\nlevels in the blood of HIV/AIDS patients. However, the\nvirus rebounds on discontinuation of antiviral treat-\nment, necessitating life-long antiviral treatment.\nDissemination of virus to the brain, which is mainly\nmediated by virus-infected macrophages, and subse-\nquent development of neurologic disease occurs in more\nthan 50% of HIV infections.17 Therefore, neurologic\nimpairment still remains an important problem even in\nthis antiviral treatment era. These precedents of antiviral\ntreatment of HCV and HIV-1 infections show that treat-\nment outcome (viral clearance vs viral persistence),\ntreatment duration (finite vs continous) and the presence\nof neurologic sequelae are greatly influenced by viral\npathogenesis.\nThe present study was limited to 20 cats with FIP, rep-\nresenting a spectrum of ages and disease forms.Although\nthe number of treated cats was small, a surprising amount\nof information was gleaned, such as how long to treat,\npotential side effects, how to identify the clinical form of\nFIP most likely to respond to the therapy, and potential\nindicators for treatment failures and successes. The field\nstudy was based on the experiences gained from phar-\nmacokinetic and efficacy studies undertaken in labora-\ntory cats. The initial treatment period was set to be 2\nweeks based on experimental studies, but it was ulti-\nmately extended to 12 weeks and longer based on experi-\nences obtained as the trial progressed. This final treatment\nperiod was closer to the 3\u00ad6 months used to treat HCV\ninfection in people with direct-acting antiviral drugs.2\nDifficulties in treating neurologic disease was also\nanticipated from experimental studies. Side effects were\nacceptable and included stinging upon injection and der-\nmal and subcutaneous inflammation when too much\ndrug was given in the same spots. This was also seen first\nin laboratory cats. A more serious side effect, which was\nnot seen beforehand in laboratory cats, was limited to kit-\ntens and involved retarded development of adult teeth\nand retention or delayed loss of deciduous teeth.\nGC376 treatment was successful in inducing a signifi-\ncant remission of disease signs and regression of lesions\nin 19/20 cats. This result confirms our findings of rapid\nreversal of clinical signs in laboratory cats with experi-\nmental FIP treated with GC376,6 and extended our\nknowledge of the drug's effects on a broad spectrum of\nforms of naturally occurring FIP. Cats came from various\nparts of the USA and even Peru, thus confirming that\ngeographically diverse field strains of FIPV were equally\nsusceptible to this inhibitor. Marked reductions in viral\nRNA transcripts occurred in effusions within days of\ntreatment and were associated with rapid improvement\nof health. However, disease remission was sustained for\n3 months and longer in only 7/20 of these cats. Failure to\nachieve long-term disease remission was ultimately\nassociated with the occurrence of neurologic disease in\nthe absence of gross abdominal lesions or a recurrence/\npersistence of gross abdominal lesions in the presence of\nhistologic lesions in the brain and/or eyes. These find-\nings indicate that FIPV has a greater propensity to spread\nfrom the body cavities to the brain than previously\nassumed, especially if given enough time. This spread\nmost likely involves infected macrophages that enter the\nbrain through small blood vessels in the meninges and\nCats that developed neurologic disease did so either\nstopped. The most likely explanation for this delay, as\nwell as some therapeutic benefit of higher dosages, was\nthat some GC376 was still able to penetrate into the\nbrain. GC376 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were only 3%\nof plasma in the brain at 2 h after a subcutaneous injec-\ntion at a dosage of 10 mg/kg (unpublished data).\nAlthough the relative brain drug concentrations in these\ncats were low, they were still 21.4-fold higher than the\nlevels required to inhibit virus replication in tissue cul-\nture. Given this finding, it was assumed that higher dos-\nages would allow more drug into the brain. This\nassumption was bolstered by experiences with two cats\nthat manifested neurologic signs. Increasing the dosage\na noticeable improvement but did not eliminate the signs\nof brain disease. Extending treatment for a period of\nalmost 3 months at a dosage of 15 mg/kg q12h appeared\nto delay the progression of neurologic signs in a second\ncat (CT12), whereas attempts to reduce the total daily\ncaused neurologic signs to worsen. This suggested that\ndosages of 15 mg/kg q12h or above allowed enough\nGC376 to cross the blood\u00adbrain barrier to retard but not\neliminate neurologic signs.\nThe high incidence of central nervous system (CNS)\ndiseases in this study was greater than previously\nreported and unexpected given that cats with signs of\nbrain or spinal cord involvement were excluded from\nthe trial.20 CNS disease was much more likely to occur in\nolder cats with dry or dry-to-wet disease than in young\ncats with wet FIP. This indicates that FIPV can enter the\nbrain in many cats, if given enough time. Infection of the\nCNS appears to involve peritoneal-type macrophages,\nas FIPV-infected cells in the brains of cats with neuro-\nlogic FIP more closely resemble peritoneal rather than\nresident brain macrophages.18,19 This should not be sur-\nprising, as macrophages migrate to various tissues,\nincluding the brain, to carry out immune surveillance\nand are also targets for a range of infectious agents, such\nas FIPV and HIV-1. Infected macrophages play a major\nrole in viral dissemination to the brain in patients with\nHIV and detection of virus in the brain can occur within\nweeks of infection.21,22 However, neurologic impairment\nusually occurs at a later stage. Anti-HIV drugs also\nreduce the frequency of severe neurologic impairment,23\nas observed with FIPV and GC376 in the present study.\nThere are also alternative explanations. It is possible that\nextra-CNS involvement may inhibit the development of\nbrain disease and vice versa. It is common to see CNS\ndisease occur in the absence of visceral disease and vice\nversa.13,20 Suppressing viral replication in the non-\nneuronal tissues may also enhance positive selection for\nmutants that are more neurotropic or neurovirulent.\nHowever, proof for the latter would require considerable\nstudies using laboratory cats.\nThere were certain forms of FIP that appeared to\ninfluence treatment success. The behavior of GC376\ntreatment in treating ocular FIP was paradoxical as it\nresponded extremely well to GC376. Even though ocular\nlesions responded to treatment, all of the three cats with\neye involvement ultimately succumbed to brain disease,\nthus supporting the close anatomic relationship of the\neye and the CNS. Chronic ileocecal and colon involve-\nment and stunted growth in older cats also carried a bad\nprognosis in this study. A number of these cats appeared\nto develop abdominal effusions only as a terminal mani-\nfestation of their disease. Host factors also associated\nwith reduced response to antiviral treatment in other\nviral infections, such as HCV, include age, sex, liver cir-\nrhosis or fibrosis, race or body weight.24\nEmergence of resistance is a major concern for any\nantiviral drug, but FIPV is rarely transmitted from cat to\ncat,13,14 and drug resistance, if it does occur, would only\nbe a problem for individual treated cats and not the\nentire population. Although viral resistance to GC376\nwas not observed in up to 20 passages in vitro,6 suggest-\ning that resistance is not easily acquired, long-term and\nrepetitive treatment in vivo may be a stronger selection\nfactor. However, viral resistance did not appear to be\nresponsible for relapses of abdominal diseases in five\ntreated cats. These cats had granulomatous-like masses,\noften in the colon and ileo-cecal-colic lymph nodes,\nwhich may have provided a protected place for viruses\nto persist. Protection of pathogens within granulomas is\na well-documented phenomenon for mycobacteria and\napplies to other pathogens such as viruses.24 The status\nof liver disease (cirrhosis) in HCV infection also\nincreases the risk of relapse and necessitates longer\ntreatment, indicating that viruses may also be protected\nfrom drugs when in certain protected sites.2 The forma-\ntion of `protective granulomas' involves a large number\nof chemokines and cytokines and upregulation of\nchemokine receptors, addressins, selectins and integ-\nrins.25 Persistence of pathogens in such protected sites\nmay require a higher dose of drug and a longer treat-\nment period.\nTreatment failures may also result from an inability of\nthe host to mount a protective immune response during\nthe period when virus replication is being suppressed.\nSuch a failure has been observed for HCV infection of\npeople.2 T-cell-mediated immunity plays an important\nrole in protective immunity, which occurs for about 20%\nin acute infection of HCV,26 and an equal or greater pro-\nportion of FIPV infection.15\u00ad17 The possible synergism of\nT-cell-mediated viral clearance and antiviral drug ther-\napy in cats with FIP remains to be investigated. There\nmay also be merit in combining antiviral drugs and stim-\nulants of T-cell immunity for FIP treatment, such as the\ncombination of interferons and ribavirin for the treat-\nment of HCV infection.2\nThe sustained remission in 6/7 cats that were treated\nfor 12 weeks or longer was somewhat predictable. These\ncats were 3.3\u00ad4.4 months of age when presented for acute\nthoracic effusive FIP (CT20). This made them younger\nthan all but three (CT8, CT16, CT21 ) other cats in the trial\nand more closely resembling the 16-week-old laboratory\ncats with acute-onset effusive FIP that responded well to\nGC376.6 The disease, being more acute, may allow less\ntime for virus to spread to the brain or eyes. The acute-\nness of their disease may have also allowed less time for\nthe infection to permanently compromise any protective\nimmune response. The seventh cat, CT04, was an extreme\nto these six younger cats. CT04 was the oldest cat in the\nstudy at 6.8 years that presented with substantial weight\nloss (30%) and disease limited to mesenteric lymph\nnodes. CT04 suffered disease relapses requiring reinstitu-\ntion of treatment, but all relapses were identical to the\npresenting condition and did not involve the CNS. Cats\nwith this form of FIP have been known to undergo spon-\ntaneous remissions, indicating that there is a tipping\nand CT21 demonstrated the wisdom of re-instituting\ntreatment when relapses occurred, providing that those\nrelapses do not involve the eyes or nervous system and\nare still drug responsive.\nDetermining a minimal period of treatment was\nbased on progressively increasing treatment times based\non favorable response to treatment. The expectation\nbased on experimental studies was that 2 weeks of treat-\nment might be sufficient; hence, that was used as a start-\ning point. However, this study indicated that a minimum\ntreatment period was closer to 12 weeks, which was sur-\nprisingly close to the usual 12 week period required to\ntreat humans with HCV using protease inhibitors.2\nHowever, the treatment period for HCV can vary from\n8\u00ad24 weeks in different people. Cat CT21 was outwardly\nhealthy, active and growing after 12 weeks of treatment,\nbut total proteins and white blood cell counts had still\nnot returned to normal as they had in the other six cats.\nNonetheless, a decision was made to stop treatment after\n17 weeks because of the long period of outwardly nor-\nmal health. Whether treating for a longer period of time\nwould have prevented a disease relapse 13 weeks after\nstopping treatment is open to conjecture, but it does\nraise the point of how long treatment is required in some\ncats. It also raises the question of how long remission\nmust be sustained to declare the disease cured rather\nthan in a sustained remission. The longest disease-free\nperiod has been over 11 months at the time of writing,\nwith five other cats free of infection signs for 5\u00ad9 months.\nBased on clinical and histologic evidence of neurologic\ndisease at the time of fatal relapses, it would seem that\nthe virus will eventually reach the brain and that this\nmay be the most important limiting factor in antiviral\ndrug treatment of FIP.\nAlthough only one-third of cats were long-term survi-\nvors, the 20 cats in this trial provide a basis for future\nstudies with GC376 and other antiviral drugs that will\nfollow. Not all cats will be treatable, but this should not\nstop the effort. Normal health was returned to almost all\ntreated cats in this limited study, albeit only for several\nweeks or months. It is important to recognize the univer-\nsality of viral pathogens and to embrace the pioneering\ndrug development that has and is being clinically\napplied to human diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis\nC, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute res-\npiratory virus, Ebola and influenza.\nConclusions\nInhibition of the 3CLpro of FIPV with GC376 was effec-\ntive under the conditions of this study in decreasing virus\nreplication and causing remission of disease signs in cats\nwith naturally occurring FIPoutside of the CNS. However,\nsustained remissions in this study were more apt to occur\nin kittens <18 weeks of age presenting with acute onset\nwet FIP or in cats with dry FIP limited to a mesenteric\nlymph node and less likely to occur in cats greater than 18\nweeks of age presenting with dry, dry-to-wet or ocular\ndisease. Failure to achieve sustained remission was asso-\nciated with either a high incidence of neurologic disease\nduring or after treatment is stopped or to recurrence of\nabdominal lesions. Antiviral treatment seemed to slow\nthe progression of neurologic disease but did not reverse\nit at the dosage employed in this trial. The reason for\nrecurrence of extra-neurologic disease in the face of treat-\nment was not determined but was not associated with\nmutations in the protease binding region.\nSupplementary material Owner informed consent form.\nConflict of interest YK, KOC and WCG have patent claims\non the protease inhibitors in the manuscript.
