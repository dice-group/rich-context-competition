Hendershot\nThis   presents selected 1986 statistics on health status and\nmedical care utilization by race and poverty status and compares them to\nestimates for 1982, using data from the National Health Interview\nSurveys (NHIS).1 The focus on statistics for minorities updates the\nstatistical basis for the discussion of access to medical care that has been\nprominent in the pages of Health Affairs.2\nSource And Limitations Of The Data\nThe NHIS has been conducted continuously by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS) since 1957. It is based on a weekly cross-\nsectional, area probability sample of households, representing the civil-\nian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. The sample is\nredesigned every ten years to reflect population changes.\nInformation is collected by personal interview in sample households\nby interviewers employed and supervised by the Census Bureau. The\ninterviewers administer two questionnaires. The first, on public health\ntopics of current national interest, is revised each year. The second, on\npublic health topics of continuing national interest, is revised about\nevery ten years.\nThe NHIS data, like those from any interview sample survey, have\nGerry Hendershot is chief, Illness and Disabilities Statistics Branch, Division of Health Interview\nStatistics, at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Household respondents, the source of the information, may\nnot be able or willing to answer accurately some questions about the\nhealth status and medical care utilization of family members. Also,\nbecause the data are based on a sample, not a complete enumeration,\nthey are subject to sampling error. To control and measure these sources\nof error, fieldwork procedures are pretested and monitored, and the\nsampling errors of estimated statistics are computed and published.\nIn addition to these continuing limitations in the NHIS data, there are\nthe core questionnaire on topics of continuing interest was extensively\nredesigned to improve the completeness and accuracy of reporting on\nhealth status and medical care utilization. While the underlying concepts\ndid not change, the redesign produced changes in estimates for some\nstatistics. For that reason, 1982 is the earliest year to which many NHIS\nstatistics can be compared.\nAlthough the designed sample size of the NHIS was enlarged in 1985\nget restrictions required a 50 percent reduction in designed sample size in\nsample was relatively small, the 1986 estimates reported here are some-\nwhat less reliable than those for other NHIS data years (including 1987,\nfor which a full sample was included and should be available by mid-\nHealth Status\nExhibit 1 shows estimates of selected measures of health status and\nmedical care utilization by race and poverty status for 1986, and the\npoverty groups have different age compositions, and age is strongly\nrelated to some measures of health status and medical care utilization,\nthe statistics are adjusted for age (to 1982 estimates for ages under\neighteen, eighteen to forty-four, forty-five to sixty-four, and sixty-five\nand over).\nAcute conditions. The NHIS defines an acute condition as a health\ncondition that caused a restriction in activity or physician contact in the\npast two weeks, began less than three months ago, and is not considered\nchronic. As shown in Exhibit 1, the age-adjusted average number of\nnonpoor black persons to 2,342 for poor white persons. (Persons were\nclassified as poor if their family income was below the official poverty\nthreshold.) Medically attended acute conditions, which are usually more\nsevere, followed the same pattern at a lower level.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This does not\nreflect a long-term trend, but rather reflects annual fluctuations in the\nincidence of influenza and other respiratory infections. The incidence of\nthese conditions was considerably higher in 1986 than it had been in\nInjuries. In the NHIS, injuries are defined as acute conditions resulting\nfrom accidents or nonaccidental violence. The NHIS distinguishes be-\ntween injuries, accidents, and episodes of persons injured. One accident\nmay injure more than one person, and one person may sustain more than\none injury in a single accident. An \"episode of a person injured\" includes\nall injuries to a single person resulting from a single accident. The rate of\nepisodes of persons injured and the rate of such episodes that caused\nrestricted activity are shown in Exhibit 1.\npattern was similar for injuries with restricted activity, but at a lower\nlevel. Poor people had higher age-adjusted rates of all injuries and\ninjuries with restricted activity, although the estimates for minority\ngroups are too unstable to make statistically reliable comparisons. The\nnot indicate a significant trend.\nLimitation in activity. Persons are considered to have limitations in\nactivity if they have chronic health conditions that cause them to limit\nnormal activities, such as playing, going to school, or working. A chronic\nhealth condition is a health condition that began more than three\nmonths ago or is commonly regarded as chronic. The age-adjusted\npercentage of persons with limitations of activity is shown in Exhibit 1.\nIn 1986 the age-adjusted percentage of persons with limitation of\nactivity ranged from 10.9 percent for nonpoor Hispanic persons to 25.6\npercent for poor white persons. Limitation of activity was considerably\nmore common among poor people than among nonpoor people, even\namong persons in the same category of race. The differences between the\nactivity were small and do not indicate a significant trend.\nRestricted activity days. Restricted activity days are those during the\npast two weeks when the sample person restricted normal activities for\nmore than half a day due to a health condition, either acute or chronic.\nThe NHIS includes data on several kinds of restricted activity days: bed\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Exhibit 1\nshows the average number of restricted activity days of all types per 1,000\npersons, age-adjusted.\nIn 1986 the age-adjusted average number of restricted activity days\nranged from 14.3 for nonpoor white persons to 26.6 for poor black and\nwhite persons. Poor persons had more (age-adjusted) days of restricted\nactivity than nonpoor persons, although the difference has a large\nsampling error for the minority groups. The differences between 1986\nand 1982 in average numbers of restricted activity days were small, and\nindicate no significant trend over that period.\nGeneral health. The NHIS respondents are asked to assess the general\nhealth of household members as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.\nThis measure is correlated with other, more objective indicators of\nhealth status and serves as an overall measure of general health. The age-\nadjusted percentages of persons reported to be in fair or poor health are\nshown in Exhibit 1.\nThe age-adjusted percentage of persons in fair or poor health ranged\nfrom 7.7 percent for nonpoor white persons to 25.8 percent for poor\nblack persons. Fair or poor health was more prevalent among poor\npersons than nonpoor persons in each of the race groups considered.\nOverall and in most of the subgroups shown, the estimated percentage in\nSummary. For the indicators of health status, the 1986 NHIS shows\nthat poor people tended to be in poorer health than nonpoor people,\nespecially when differences in age are statistically controlled. This was\ngenerally found for each of the major groups considered--white, black,\nand Hispanic--although sampling variability in some estimates for the\nminority groups must qualify that statement. Except for an increase in\nacute conditions caused by an influenza epidemic and a possible slight\ndecrease in the percentage of persons assessed by respondents to be in fair\nor poor health, there was little evidence of significant trends in health\nMedical Care Utilization\nThe last five panels of Exhibit 1 contain NHIS estimates of age-\nadjusted statistics for selected indicators of medical care utilization:\ndental visits, physician contacts, and hospital stays.\nDental visits. Exhibit 1 shows the age-adjusted percentage of persons\nwho had one or more visits to a dentist in the year preceding their NHIS\ninterview in 1986, and the age-adjusted number of visits in that period.\nThese data show significant differences in access to dental care among\ndifferent race and poverty status groups. Among poor Hispanic persons,\nonly about one-third were reported to have seen a dentist, whereas three-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The age-\nadjusted average number of visits during the year ranged from less than\none for poor black persons to over two for nonpoor white persons. There\nare racial and ethnic differences in access to dental care that are indepen-\ndent of poverty status: black and Hispanic persons have less access to\ndental care than white persons regardless of their poverty status. The\nsome increase in access to dental care in that period.\nPhysician contacts. A physician contact is a telephone call or visit to\nan office or clinic during which the sample person was seen or talked to\nby a physician or by a health professional working under a physician's\nsupervision; physician contacts while a hospital inpatient are not in-\ncluded in this measure. Age-adjusted estimates are shown in Exhibit 1\nfor two measures of physician contacts: the percentage of persons with\none or more contacts during the year before the NHIS interview, and the\naverage number of contacts in that period.\nIn 1986 there was little difference between race and poverty status\ngroups in the percentage who had contacted a physician during the past\nyear. There was a poverty status difference, however, in the average\nnumber of contacts: poor persons had more contacts, on average, than\nnonpoor persons. This implies, of course, that while poor persons were\nno more likely than others to contact a physician, those poor persons\nwho did contact a physician at all did so considerably more often, on\naverage, than did nonpoor persons.\nHospitalization. The NHIS considers persons to have been hospital-\nized if they were inpatients in a hospital overnight. Exhibit 1 shows the\n1986 NHIS estimates of the age-adjusted percentages of persons who\nwere hospitalized one or more times in the past year. It should be noted\nthat persons who die while hospitalized and those who are discharged to\nnursing homes or other long-term care facilities are not in the household\npopulation represented by the NHIS. Since such persons account for a\nlarge proportion of hospitalizations, their absence from the NHIS is a\nsignificant limitation of these data.\nExhibit 1 shows that in 1986, after age adjustment, the percentage of\nnoninstitutionalized poor persons who were hospitalized was consider-\nwas a decline in the age-adjusted percentage hospitalized during the year,\nbut the decline was concentrated among nonpoor persons, widening the\ngap between the poor and nonpoor populations.\nSummary. Compared to nonpoor persons, poor persons have less\naccess to dental care, but access seems to be improving for both the poor\nand the nonpoor. Poor and nonpoor persons are about equally likely to\ncontact a physician during the year, but poor persons who do contact a\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Finally, poor persons are more\nlikely than nonpoor persons to be hospitalized during the year, and the\ndecline in the rate of hospitalization among the nonpoor is widening that\ngap. Given the poorer health status of poor persons, as shown in the\npreceding section, their use of physician and hospital services suggests\nthat they postpone medical treatment until their condition becomes\nmore serious and requires more extensive utilization of medical care.\nConclusion\nThe data from the NHIS included in this   are derived from\nan extensive set of unpublished tabulations completed by NCHS for\neach data year. While these tabulations are too extensive to publish or\ndistribute in their entirety, they are available to the public health\ncommunity on request.4 They generally become available about mid-\nyear of the year following data collection. Because the NHIS is based on a\nlarge sample (including an oversample of the black population), and\nbecause its procedures change very little from year to year, these annual\ntabulations are a useful resource for tracking levels and trends in health\nstatus and utilization of medical care in the population.\nThe interpretations included in this   are the author's, and do not necessarily reflect the views\nof the National Center for Health Statistics.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
