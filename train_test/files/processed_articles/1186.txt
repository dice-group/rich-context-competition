They compared vital status through 7 years ascertained from an NDI search\nthe Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Estimates of NDI\nunderascertainment were applied to mortality rate ratios for 66,667 older Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic\nWhites from the 1986\u00ad1994 National Health Interview Surveys linked to the NDI.

Two kinds of\nevidence exist for a Hispanic mortality advantage compared\nwith other groups: 1) mortality rates calculated by linking\nvital registration death data to census population counts and\n2) mortality rates calculated from cohort studies in which\nmortality is ascertained over a follow-up period. Both kinds\nof evidence are subject to data errors that might lead to\nmisstatement of a Hispanic mortality advantage.\nMortality rates calculated by linking death counts from\nvital registration to population counts from census enumera-\ntions are subject to error because the numerator and denomi-\nnator come from different sources. Both data systems are\nsubject to coverage errors (i.e., incomplete enumeration and\ndeath registration), discrepancies in ethnic classification, and\nage misstatement. Each of these errors can produce system-\natic biases in the calculation of death rates that could create\na false appearance of ethnic disparities (15).\nHispanics, like other minority populations, are dispropor-\ntionately exposed to several risk factors for both underregis-\ntration of deaths and underenumeration in a census. These\nfactors include low levels of formal schooling and English\nlanguage literacy; residency in poor, rural, and near-border\nenvironments; overrepresentation in agricultural and\ndomestic service occupations; and undocumented immigra-\ntion status. It is not clear a priori whether the undercount\nerror will be larger in the numerator (deaths) or the denomi-\nnator (census). However, one particular concern is that\nhealth-selective return migration of international immigrants\nto a country of origin may lead to underestimation of\nmortality rates in the United States by systematically\nremoving report of deaths from the numerator but not the\npossibility has been called the \"salmon bias\" hypothesis\n(12). Another especially important concern is that Hispanic\nethnicity may be systematically underreported in death\nregistration compared with census data. This underreporting\nmay occur in particular because the ethnicity field on the\ndeath certificate is sometimes filled out by a physician or\nfuneral director who may not know the decedent well (15,\n17).In addition, overstatement of age on the death certificate\nlowers age-adjusted mortality estimates (18), which may\noccur disproportionately among Hispanics because of their\nrelatively low levels of formal schooling and potentially\nlimited access to a birth certificate. All of these concerns\ncumulate to raise questions about comparison of Hispanic\nand non-Hispanic mortality using vital registration death\nrates alone.\nThe second kind of data documenting a Hispanic mortality\nadvantage comes from studies that ascertain vital status for\nlarge cohorts over a period of follow-up. Data from cohort\nstudies seemingly provide powerful corroborating evidence\nabout the Hispanic mortality advantage because they elimi-\nnate concerns about inconsistent ethnic classification in\ncensus and vital registration and reduce concerns about age\nmisstatement. Hispanic identification is fixed by self-report\nat the beginning of the study, so inconsistency of reporting\nethnicity at subsequent points does not affect calculated\nmortality rates. Two important studies have used this design.\nThe National Longitudinal Mortality Study reported\nmortality follow-up for select cohorts from the Current\nPopulation Survey. A second study has also ascertained\nNational Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Both data sets\nshowed mortality advantages for Hispanics compared with\nnon-Hispanic Whites (1, 2, 4).\nHowever, cohort studies are vulnerable to a potential bias\nresulting from underascertainment of mortality during the\nfollow-up period. Mortality follow-up for both the National\nLongitudinal Mortality Study and the NHIS was accom-\nplished by linking data on survey respondents to mortality\nrecords in the National Death Index (NDI). The NDI\nmatching process uses the following information to identify\ncases: first and last names, middle initial, father's surname,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, state of birth, state of\nresidence, sex, race, marital status, and age at death (19).\nResearchers have developed probabilistic approaches that\nclassify cohort members as matched or unmatched to death\nrecords based on the level of agreement and disagreement\nbetween survey and death record information (20). This\nmatching process has been carefully validated by using cali-\nbration samples from studies with an active follow-up of\nvital status (21). Both the NDI database and the matching\nmethod used for linkages between survey respondents and\nNDI records are considered the \"gold standard\" for ascer-\ntainment of mortality for a community cohort (22).\nImportant questions remain, however, about the accuracy\nof death information when the NDI is used for Hispanic\ncohorts. Emigration from the United States presents poten-\ntial problems for NDI-based studies because deaths outside\nof the country are not included in the NDI database. Even\nwhen a death occurs in the United States, automated\nmatching algorithms may not work as well for Hispanics as\nthey do for other groups, especially non-Hispanic Whites.\nThere are several reasons for this concern. The NDI\nmatching method relies heavily on Social Security number\nmatches. Use and accuracy of Social Security numbers may\nbe lower both in survey responses and on death certificates\nfor segments of the Hispanic population that are undocu-\nmented or whose work experience is primarily in the\ninformal agriculture or domestic service sectors. Name\nmatches may also be less reliable for Hispanics than for non-\nHispanic Whites because Hispanic naming practices differ\nfrom non-Hispanic White conventions in several ways that\ncan affect how names are reported both to survey researchers\nand on the death certificate. For example, many Hispanics\nuse both father's and mother's surnames as part of their\nname. By custom, at marriage, the bride adds her husband's\nsurname while retaining her parents' surnames. For many\nHispanics, the first surname listed is considered the primary\nsurname, in contrast to the conventional US emphasis placed\non \"last name.\" Identifying a single \"middle name\" may also\nbe difficult for some Hispanics because this term may refer\nto one of several given names or one of several family\nsurnames. Anglicized name variants, for example, \"Mary\"\nrather than \"Maria,\" may also be used in giving information\nto non-Hispanics (23).\nA lower NDI match rate for Hispanics for any of these\nreasons would increase the appearance of a Hispanic\nmortality advantage. Unfortunately, performance of the NDI\nEvaluation of Mortality Data for Mexican Americans 709\nmatching algorithm has not been investigated for Hispanics\nbecause the calibration samples used thus far have contained\nfew Hispanic members (24). These issues have contributed\nto continuing debate about the existence and magnitude of\nthe Hispanic mortality advantage (11, 16).\nThe purpose of this study was to determine empirically\nwhether bias exists in Hispanic mortality estimates based on\nan NDI search for a large cohort of older Mexican Ameri-\ncans. Data from the Hispanic Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) were used for\nthis investigation. The Hispanic EPESE collected identi-\nfying information for all 12 items used in the NDI matching\nprocess, making it possible to reproduce closely the\nmatching methods used in other population surveys linked to\nthe NDI. Additionally, the Hispanic EPESE includes 7 years\nof active follow-up of vital status through interviews with\nsubjects or reports from proxy informants. This combination\nof vital status information from proxy reports and the NDI\nmakes the Hispanic EPESE a unique data set evaluating\nmortality information for Hispanics.\nWe performed three tasks in this study. First, we compared\nvital status information from proxy informants and NDI\nmatches. Second, we examined discrepancies in mortality\nascertainment by age, sex, and nativity status. Finally, we\nderived adjustment factors for underascertainment from the\nNDI linked data to illustrate the impact of these adjustment\nfactors on estimates of the Hispanic mortality advantage.\nStudy samples\nThe Hispanic EPESE is a cohort of 3,050 community-\ndwelling Mexican Americans aged 65 years or older living\nin the southwestern region of the United States (25). An area\npercent of those originally sampled participating in the base-\nline survey. This sample is representative of approximately\nwestern states (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico,\nwith three subsequent waves of data collection in 1995\u00ad\nThe first vital status information for the Hispanic EPESE\ncohort was collected during each of the three follow-up\ninterview waves. If a subject was missing at follow-up, then\nproxy respondents were asked whether the subject had died,\nhad moved, or had been admitted to a hospital, nursing\nhome, or hospice facility. Proxy informants who reported\nthat the subject was deceased were interviewed by using a\ndeath questionnaire that asked the date, location, and cause\nof death as well as questions about hospital or nursing home\nadmissions prior to the subject's death. The overwhelming\nmajority (86 percent) of proxy informants were family\nmembers of the missing subject. In 164 instances, interviews\nwith proxy informants were not completed for subjects lost\nover the follow-up period (i.e., neither the subject nor a\nproxy informant was reinterviewed after baseline). There-\nfore, data were analyzed for 2,886 subjects, with vital status\nascertained through interviews with subjects or proxy infor-\nmants. Excluded subjects for whom vital status information\nwas missing were significantly younger (mean age, 69.2\nyears; standard deviation, 5.2 years) than those subjects\nincluded in the data analysis (mean age, 73.3 years; standard\ndeviation, 6.8 years), although no differences were observed\nby sex and nativity.\nVital status information obtained from interviews with\nsubjects or proxy informants (hereafter referred to as \"proxy\nreports\") was compared with information from a match of\nthe Hispanic EPESE cohort to death records in the NDI data-\nbase through a search performed in 2002. Deaths through\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, Mary-\nland) to match the NHIS to the NDI was used to identify\ndeaths of Hispanic EPESE subjects (26). This system\ninvolves a two-step process. In the first step, NDI records are\nidentified as potential matches to subjects when one of nine\ncriteria is met (formerly 12 criteria were used by the NDI,\nbut, in 1999, four of the Social Security number\u00adrelated\ncriteria were collapsed into a single Social Security number\nmatch criterion). The nine criteria are various combinations\nof agreement between supplied survey information and NDI\nrecords on seven matching items. For a given subject, one or\nmore NDI records may be identified as potential matches;\nfor other subjects, no potential matches are identified. In the\nsecond step, potentially matched records are evaluated to\ndetermine whether one particular record can be identified as\na \"true\" match to the survey subject. In this step, statistical\nweights derived from calibration samples provide investiga-\ntors with probability scores to evaluate potential matches.\nAll potential matches are categorized into mutually exclu-\nsive classes based on which items matched and the combina-\ntion of matched items. Class-specific cutoffs of probability\nscores are then used to identify \"true\" matches (21). Using the\nNHIS-NDI cutoff scores, we identified 753 deaths among the\n2,886 subjects in the Hispanic EPESE study sample.\nTo evaluate the implications of the findings from the\nHispanic EPESE for mortality differentials between\nHispanics and non-Hispanic Whites, adjustment factors\ncalculated from the Hispanic EPESE data were applied to\ncohort data that were linked to the NDI. The NHIS is an\nannual cross-sectional survey of approximately 75,000\npersons, representative of the noninstitutionalized US adult\npopulation. Vital status searches for subjects from these\nthe NDI. To provide survival time comparable to that in the\nHispanic EPESE (7.5 years), data on subjects from the\nall 66,667 non-Hispanic White and Mexican-American\n(self-identified as Mexican Mexicano, Mexican American,\nor Chicano) subjects aged 65 years or older were used in the\nanalysis.\nData analysis\nTo compare the vital status of Hispanic EPESE subjects by\nproxy reports and the NDI, both simple agreement and the\nkappa statistic were calculated. Stratified analyses of\nmortality by age, sex, and nativity were also performed to\ninvestigate systematic differences in death ascertainment as\na function of each of these characteristics. For each vital\nstatus source, logistic regression models were used to\nexamine univariate associations of vital status with age, sex,\nand nativity. Multivariate proportional hazards models were\nalso estimated to determine the effects of demographic\nfactors on survival. Odds ratio and hazard ratio effect sizes\nwere compared across each vital status source.\nTo assess the magnitude of death underascertainment bias,\nratios of proxy-reported to NDI mortality rates as well as 95\npercent confidence intervals were calculated using the\nHispanic EPESE data. To determine how this level of\nunderascertainment would affect estimates of mortality for\nMexican Americans in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites,\nthese mortality ratios were then applied as adjustment factors\nyears) mortality rates. Multiplying the stratum-specific\nmortality ratio by the respective NHIS observed mortality\nrate provided an adjusted mortality rate. This methodology\nhas been used previously to adjust mortality data for incon-\nsistent race/ethnicity classifications of Native Americans in\nthe United States and M\u00e4oris in New Zealand (27\u00ad29).\nAge standardizations for observed and adjusted mortality\nrates were made in the NHIS data by using the direct\nmethod. Standardized rates were prepared for each sex\nwithin each ethnic group (Mexican Americans and non-\nHispanic Whites). All subjects aged 65 years or older in the\ndard population. Age-standardized mortality rate ratios of\nNHIS Mexican Americans to non-Hispanic Whites were\ncalculated with 95 percent confidence intervals by using the\nMexican-American (exposed group) distribution as the\nreference standard (30).\nPrior to applying adjustment factors from the Hispanic\nEPESE to the rates calculated from the NHIS\u00adNDI, it was\nimportant to ensure that the mortality structure was compa-\nrable between the two data sets. The age distributions of NDI\ndeaths in the Hispanic EPESE and the NHIS were found to\nbe similar.\nFor Hispanic EPESE subjects, survival time was estimated\nseparately for each vital status source. The survival clock\nbegan with the baseline interview date for both sources. For\nmortality rates based on the NDI, subjects were right\ncensored either on their date of death according to NDI or on\nsubjects for whom proxy report information was available\ndepended on reinterview status. If a subject refused to partic-\nipate in the study at follow-up, then he or she was right\ncensored at the midpoint of that data collection period (dates\nof refused interviews were not recorded). Proxy informants\nwho reported that a subject had died were asked for the\nmonth and year of the death, which was used as the\ncensoring date (the 15th was used as the day of death for all\nproxy-reported deaths). Subjects were right censored on\ndate. Finally, those subjects interviewed in the fourth wave\nof data collection were right censored either on December\nIn calculating the preadjustment survival time from the\nNHIS-NDI data, survival time also began on the date of\nwhose survival time exceeded 7.5 years were right censored\nat this maximal point (2,740 days). All other NHIS subjects\nwere right censored with death dates from the NDI or\nanalyzed by using the SAS and SUDAAN statistical pack-\nRESULTS\nAmong Hispanic EPESE subjects, crude mortality based\non proxy reports was 29.6 percent over the 7.5-year follow-\nup period (table 1). An NDI search over the same time period\nyielded a lower crude mortality estimate of 26.1 percent.\nVital status classifications between the two sources agreed\nstrated reasonable concordance between the two sources\nwhile adjusting for chanceful agreement. Nonetheless, a\nmants were not identified by the NDI.\nTable 2 shows the demographic predictors of vital status\nclassifications for Hispanic EPESE subjects by NDI and\nproxy reports. We found that the effect of age on mortality\nwas stronger with proxy-reported information than when the\nNDI was used. This difference stemmed from fewer deaths\nidentified by the NDI of very old Mexican Americans. For\nexample, for subjects aged 80 years or older, proxy infor-\nmants reported 60 deaths not identified by the NDI. (Note\nthat only marginal totals are shown for each subgroup in\ntable 2; therefore, counts reported in this paragraph cannot\nbe directly calculated from table 2.) In addition, the mortality\neffect of male compared with female gender was weaker in\nthe proxy-reported information than in the NDI data. A total\nof 116 women were not classified as dead by the NDI but\nhad died according to proxy informants. Finally, foreign-\nborn nativity was protective for mortality based on NDI clas-\nsifications; however, this effect was not significant in the\nproxy death data because informants reported an additional\n99 deaths of foreign-born subjects not classified as dead by\nthe NDI.\nTABLE 1.

Ratios of proxy report\nto NDI mortality rates are shown in table 3. Although\nmortality rates were higher for men than for women, discrep-\nancies between the two vital status sources were larger for\nwomen than for men and were more pronounced when strat-\nified by age and nativity. Among men, for example, proxy-\ninformed mortality rates were approximately 1.1 times\nhigher than NDI rates for each age stratum. For women,\nhowever, mortality ratios were larger, especially in the older\nage groups. Similarly, the proxy-informed mortality rate for\nforeign-born men was 1.1 times higher than the NDI rate; for\nwomen, it was 1.4 times higher. Overall, proxy-reported\nmortality rates were higher, by 9 percent for men and 28\npercent for women, than rates based on the NDI.\nTable 4 shows stratified mortality rates (based on the NDI)\nfor elderly Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites\n* NDI, National Death Index; EPESE, Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\n Univariate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\n\u00a7 Multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals; age, sex, and nativity were entered into the model.\nNDI Proxy report\nDead Alive\nDead Alive\nNo. % No. % No. % No. %\nAge (years)\nSex\nNativity\nForeign\n* NDI, National Death Index; EPESE, Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, CI, confidence interval.\nProxy report NDI Ratio Proxy report NDI Ratio\nMortality\nrate\nMortality\nrate\nMortality\nratio\nMortality\nrate\nMortality\nrate\nMortality\nratio\nAge (years)\nNativity\nForeign\nnally observed mortality rates were lower for Mexican\nAmericans (first column) than for non-Hispanic Whites\n(fourth column) for both men and women (except for women\naged 65\u00ad69 years). This pattern extended to age-standard-\nized mortality rates and rates by nativity, suggesting the\nexistence of a Hispanic paradox. However, when Hispanic\nEPESE mortality ratios (of proxy report to the NDI) were\napplied as adjustment factors to NHIS Mexican-American\nmortality rates (third column), adjusted mortality rates for\nMexican-American women exceeded rates observed for\nnon-Hispanic White women for all age and nativity strata.\nAdjustments also affected death rates for Mexican-American\nmen, particularly in the foreign-born category. The original\nrate ratio of the Mexican-American to the non-Hispanic\nWhite age-standardized mortality rate was 0.77 (95 percent\nconfidence interval: 0.77, 1.09) for women, but the adjusted\nadjusted age-standardized Mexican-American mortality rate\nfor men remained lower compared with the age-standardized\nnon-Hispanic White rate; however, for Mexican-American\nwomen, the adjusted rate was higher than the non-Hispanic\nWhite rate by 18 percent.\nDISCUSSION\nFindings from this investigation indicate that deaths of\nolder Mexican Americans are underascertained when the\nHispanic EPESE cohort is linked to the NDI. If these find-\nings generalize to other data sets, Hispanic mortality rates\nbased on cohort studies linked to the NDI are understated.\nDeath underascertainment by the NDI was most apparent for\nMexican-American women aged 75 years or older and\nwomen born outside of the United States. Once this pattern\nwas accounted for, the age-adjusted mortality rate was\nsubstantially higher for older Mexican-American women\ncompared with older non-Hispanic White women. Thus, the\nmortality disadvantage experienced by Hispanic women is\nundetected in studies linked to the NDI. This pattern of\ngender difference in mortality rates adjusted for underascer-\ntainment reproduces earlier reports that the Hispanic advan-\ntage, if it exists, is primarily true for men (33).\nMuch of the discordance between proxy-reported and\nNDI-identified deaths likely stems from problems with\nmatching of Social Security numbers. Although researchers\nevaluating the NDI report that death ascertainment is good\nwhen identifiers other than Social Security number (34\u00ad36)\nare used,the most important determinant of an NDI match is\nthe Social Security number (37, 38). Indeed, the sensitivity\nof NDI death identification has exceeded 95 percent when\nSocial Security numbers were used (22). Given the impor-\ntance of the Social Security number for NDI death ascertain-\nment, it is not surprising that misclassification was most\nconcentrated among the oldest old and foreign-born\nMexican-American women. It is likely that some of these\nwomen born before 1919 were never employed in the formal\nUS economy or for a time had undocumented immigrant\nstatus and thus never acquired a valid Social Security\nnumber. For example, our tabulations of the California\nthe Social Security number field was blank for 7.3 percent of\nMexican-American women and 5.6 percent of Mexican-\nTABLE 4.

Another possibility is that older Mexican Ameri-\ncans may use relatives' or friends' Social Security numbers\nor that women may use their husband's. Thus, reliance on the\nSocial Security number for NDI death matching may be\nproblematic for older Mexican Americans, especially\nwomen. The findings from this study are concordant with\nthese expectations.\nOther major identifiers, such as date of birth, sex, or race,\ndid not yield many NDI matches for Hispanic EPESE\nsubjects. Only 119 Hispanic EPESE subjects were identified\nas dead by the NDI when the Social Security number did not\nmatch, even though all other identifiers were supplied to the\nNDI. That is, the Hispanic EPESE had fewer NDI matches\nwith probability scores meeting cutoffs for classification\ncategories that do not require a Social Security number. This\nproblem could result from misrecording of data by survey\ninterviewers or misrecording of information on death certifi-\ncates, such as name misspelling or use of a name variant. For\nstatistics data found that persons identified as Mexican\nAmerican were more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic\nmiddle name field in the data and were more than seven\ntimes as likely (5.9 percent vs. 0.8 percent) to report\nmother's maiden name as their own surname. This height-\nened potential for misrecording of items both on death certif-\nicates and in survey responses underscores the challenges of\nmatching Hispanics to the NDI.\nThe relatively high proportion of underascertained deaths\nof foreign-born persons is consistent with the \"salmon bias\"\nhypothesis, which predicts a higher rate of underascertain-\nment for the foreign born because it is likely that emigration\nfrom the United States would be more common for the\nforeign born than for those born in the United States (10).\nThat is, some of the foreign born may maintain active social\nties in the home community that they left when they came to\nthe United States (39). They may choose to return home for\nsocial support when they experience illness (40). However,\nonly 21 of the 99 foreign-born Hispanic EPESE decedents\n(21.2 percent) not matched by the NDI were reported by\nproxy informants to have died in Mexico. Thus, \"salmon\nbias\" accounts for only a small proportion of deaths not\nascertained by the NDI.\nUse of automated matching algorithms is a practical\nnecessity for studies that seek to link large population-based\ncohorts to the NDI. That these algorithms can sometimes fail\nis well understood. NDI documentation emphasizes that the\nclassification and scoring apparatus provided to users of this\nservice are intended as tools rather than definitive determi-\nnants of vital status. It is the responsibility of the end user to\nuse the results of the algorithm, along with any additional\ninformation available, to determine whether a record is\nmatched (19). The experience of linking the Hispanic\nEPESE to the NDI suggests that standard algorithms cali-\nbrated for the general US population may not work as well\nfor this population subgroup.\nAlternative practices for submitting survey records for an\nNDI search may improve the match rate for Hispanics. For\nexample, researchers who are collecting survey data on\nHispanic populations and anticipate linking these data to the\nNDI database may want to collect information about both\nmother's and father's surnames and to submit duplicate\nrecords with each parental surname as \"last name.\" All\npossible middle initials derived from parental surnames and\nfrom middle names may be tested. Records may be\nsubmitted without Social Security numbers to prevent false\nnonmatches from misreported Social Security numbers.\nResearchers should also carefully review potential matches\nat a lower threshold of probability than is the case for other\ngroups. Until such alternative practices can be developed\ninto calibrated scoring algorithms sensitive to different use\nof identifiers for Hispanic populations, NDI-based compari-\nsons of mortality rates for Hispanics and other subpopula-\ntions should be made with caution.\nThe current study is limited because death certificates\nwere unavailable to permit a more nuanced evaluation of the\nNDI matching method for Hispanics. Such evaluation could\nidentify matching elements that may need to be weighted\ndifferently for Hispanics to optimize the matching algorithm\nin this ethnic group. In addition, differences in data collec-\ntion procedures between the Hispanic EPESE and the NHIS\ndid not allow a direct assessment of the NHIS\u00adNDI\nmatching process. Application of bias estimates from the\nHispanic EPESE to the NHIS\u00adNDI study is reported only to\nillustrate the magnitude of underascertainment effects on the\nHispanic mortality paradox. Finally, mortality estimates for\nnon-Hispanic Whites were not adjusted for underascertain-\nment because a second source of vital status information was\nnot available for the NHIS\u00adNDI cohort.In studies that report\nsensitivity of the NDI, estimates range from 92 percent to 98\nare included in these estimates, the sensitivity of the NDI for\nnon-Hispanic Whites is likely closer to the upper bound.\nAssuming that the NDI has a sensitivity of 95 percent for\nnon-Hispanic White men and women, the mortality rate ratio\nadjusted for underascertainment would likely reduce to 0.80\nThe strength and importance of this study is that it is the\nfirst known to evaluate NDI matching in a large sample of\nHispanics with a second independent source of vital status\ninformation. The current study documents a pattern of NDI\ndeath underascertainment that has implications for\ncomparing death rates across racial and ethnic groups. An\nimportant implication is that small classification errors or\nunderperformance of the matching algorithm for subgroups\ncan have an important effect on calculated ethnic differen-\ntials, especially for the older Hispanic population. The\nsocial and economic characteristics of this population\nlikely contribute to data quality problems that lead to over-\nstatement of the Hispanic mortality advantage in cohort\nstudies linked to the NDI. Results from this study and\nothers underscore the importance of interpreting mortality\nrates for ethnic minority groups with caution. Considering\nthat death rates by race/ethnicity are used to set and eval-\nquality of vital registration and data reporting systems for\nethnic minority populations needs to become a greater\npublic health priority.\n"
