Economists focus on expenditures on food\nand budget shares (9,10). Recently, nutrition scholars have\nrecognized the importance of both household purchasing\nbehaviors and the characterization of the achievement and\nmaintenance of a healthy weight as \"work\" that must be \"man-\naged\" (11). In the consumer economics field, the household\nproduction model has been a framework of choice for research\n(4) and has been expanded to include the production of health\n(5). However, studying the production of a healthy weight is\nThe number of eating occasions, including snacking, in addi-\ntion to where people consume food, i.e., at home, in restaurants\nor at fast food establishments, influence obesity. That is partly\ndue to an increase in the average portion sizes of snack foods,\nsoft drinks and in all restaurant settings (15\u00ad17). Snacking\nimpacts total daily caloric intake as people fail to compensate\nby eating less at subsequent meals (18).\nA body of work related to time spent in meal production and\neating is developing (1,19). While still largely anecdotal, there\nis some evidence that knowledge of cooking increases healthy\nfood intake and the United States is a nation that cannot or\ndoes not cook (20). Research has also found that a decrease\nin the number of meals prepared \"from scratch\" increased the\nprobability of being overweight in a national sample (12). But\npeople perceive less time to cook (21,22).\nOther time uses are linked to obesity. Time spent in front of\na computer or television (screen time) as well as other forms\nof inactivity are detrimental to health (23,24). Americans fall\nshort of meeting exercise guidelines, spending less than 20min\ndaily in exercise, sports, or recreation but over 2 hours watch-\ning television (25). Sleep (or lack thereof) may be connected to\nResearch links obesity with demographic characteristics\nincluding educational attainment, gender, race, and age (27\u00ad30).\nOther factors include attributes of the built environment.\nResearch has linked walkability, urban location, and use of non-\nmotorized transportation modes to decreased obesity (31,32).\nThe conceptual basis for this study is Grossman's (5) model\nof the demand for health capital, an extension of Becker's (4)\nTime Use and Food Pattern Influences\non Obesity\nJane M. Kolodinsky1 and Amanda B. Goldstein2\nThe rise of obesity in the United States over the past 25 years has resulted in an increase in the number of research\nstudies published related to the causes, consequences, and possible solutions to the problem. Most would agree\nthat obesity is a multi-dimensional problem that requires a range of solutions related to individual diet and activity,\nfood and built environment, and public policy. Examination of complex relationships between food choice, time use\npatterns, sociodemographic characteristics and obesity has been limited by data availability and disciplinary focus.\nUsing the theory of the production of health capital, this paper links empirical data from the Consumer Expenditure,\nCurrent Population, and American Time Use Surveys to provide estimates of the impacts of food expenditure and time\nuse patterns on obesity in single female headed households of 31\u00ad50 years of age.\n1Department of Community Development and Applied Economics, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA; 2Center for Rural Studies, University of Vermont,\nBurlington, Vermont, USA.

Building stocks of health capital, one measure\nof which is a healthy weight, is a decision made at the house-\nhold level. Individuals, given an initial stock of health, produce\nhealth rather than consume it from the market as they would\nin a traditional neoclassical demand model. The model allows\nthe examination of the effects of time use, purchased inputs\nand household characteristics on the production of a healthy\nweight. Certain time uses result in energy output, e.g., physi-\ncal activity. Other time uses result in less energy output, e.g.,\nsedentary behaviors including screen time. Some time is com-\nbined with purchased inputs and results in energy input, e.g.,\ncooking time and purchased food for consumption at home.\nHowever, research on measuring food and physical activity\nenvironments is relatively recent, at an early stage of develop-\nment, and few standard measures exist (3). Any conceptual\nmodel which attempts to incorporate multiple factors related\nto obesity becomes increasingly complex. We estimate a mul-\ntivariate version of the health capital model that permits the\ntesting of several hypotheses, Ceteris Paribus. H1 and H2 are\nderived from the literature, which has relied mostly on bivari-\nate statistics to examine relationships between demographic\nvariables and obesity. H3, H4, and H5 are formulated based on\nthe energy balance equation (24).\nH1: Demographic characteristics of lower income, lower\neducation, rural location, and being of black or Hispanic eth-\nnicity are associated with increased obesity;\nH2: Food time use patterns that include more \"cooking time\"\nand \"mindful eating\" are associated with decreased obesity;\nH3: Food patterns that include more fast and other food\naway from home are associated with increased obesity;\nH4: Time use patterns that involve more sedentary behav-\niors are associated with increased obesity; and\nH5: Time use patterns that involve more physically active\nbehaviors are associated with decreased obesity.\nMethods and Procedures\nNecessary data include food expenditures, time use, demographic\ncharacteristics and measures of height and weight. No one nationally\nrepresentative database contains all this information. Therefore, the\nEating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS)\nis linked with individual data from the Current Population Survey\nand grouped data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). The\nCE has been available yearly since 1984 from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (http://www.bls.gov/cex/) and contains information neither\nabout height nor weight. In the time diary portion of the ATUS (http://\nwww.bls.gov/tus), respondents sequentially report activities they did\nbetween 4:00 AM on the day before the interview until 4:00 AM on the\nday of the interview. The ATUS Eating and Health Module provides\nwere pooled.\nThis analysis includes single female headed households of 31\u00ad50 years\nof age without a disability. Use of this subsample is based on a variety of\ndisciplinary findings. The Food Guide Pyramid and the 2005 Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans (DGA) (33) make recommendations by gender\ntion follows that categorization. People with disabilities were excluded\nto ensure that time use was dictated by personal choice and not physical\nlimits. Underweight and pregnant women were excluded; underweight\npresents a distinct public health issue, and pregnant women may have a\nhigher BMI without being overweight. Time use patterns differ across the\nlife stage (34). Individuals with a BMI >50 were excluded, since morbid\nobesity presents additional and more serious health problems and does\nnot parallel overweight or moderate obesity trends (35).\nWe reference both the Food Guide Pyramid and DGA to identify food\npatterns (33). We combined or renamed the CE broad food expenditure\ncategories to correspond to the specific food groups identified in the\nDGA (33). A content analysis conducted by two registered dieticians\nrecommended that expenditures be recoded as well as regrouped into cat-\negories that more closely mirror the DGA categorization. Average expen-\nditures from the CE were assigned to individuals in the ATUS through\na matching based on three demographic variables: gender, income, and\nfamily composition. These have all been linked as major predictors of\nboth food expenditures and time use patterns in addition to being corre-\nlated to obesity (36). In addition, that combination of variables preserves\nthe most variability within the expenditure data. Hundreds of matches\nwere made. An example of the assignment methodology is as follows:\naccording to the CE, in 2007, the average weekly expenditure on chicken\nfor an adult single female headed household without children earning\nwas a single female head of household without children who earned less\nthan $10,000 per year was then assigned a weekly chicken expenditure of\n$1.63. Similarly, the average value for all other food groups was assigned\nto each category of income and household composition. This matching\nmethod preserves individual data for demographic and time use vari-\nables in the ATUS data and assigns grouped data for food expenditures\nin the CE. Table 1 presents characteristics of the 1,451 respondents in\nthe linked sample and each healthy and overweight cohort. Weight status\ndiffers significantly across race, education, region of residence, income,\nemployment status, and self-reported health status. These relationships\nare consistent with other research (27\u00ad30).\nNext, expenditure shares for 28 food categories were calculated.\nInitially, only the major DGA categories were used. These included\ncombined categories of animal and non-animal protein, dairy, fruits,\nvegetables, carbohydrate, added fats, added sugars, and included the\nadditional categories of beverages, miscellaneous foods, fast food, and\nfull service food away from home. Early analysis revealed that regard-\nless of income level and family composition, the share of expenditures\ndid not differ significantly across demographic groups. Therefore, DGA\ncategories were further disaggregated. Using the expertise of dietitians,\nthe DGA categories, and available expenditures in the CE data resulted\nin expenditure shares that were diverse enough to show variation across\nrespondents, yet aggregated enough to allow interpretation within the\nDGA guidelines.\nThe method of two-step cluster analysis using the log-likelihood\ndistance measure and Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion in the Statistical\nPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to\nidentify food patterns. Cluster analysis is typically sensitive to the vari-\nables included in the clustering. In the case of food, all 30 of the DGA\nfood groups were included. There were no additions or deletions of vari-\nables that could influence the cluster results. Cluster analysis has been\nused across disciplines to define distinct dietary patterns using both\nfood intake and expenditure data (8,37,38). When the relationships\namong several variables are unknown and several variables may be con-\nsidered dependent, cluster analysis can give an indication of complex\npatterns within a dataset, not easily accomplished with economic, soci-\nological, or even social-ecological models, which tend to lead to regres-\nsion type approaches to empirical analysis (14,39,40). Five patterns\nclusters emerged; about average across food categories (AVERAGE;\n23 percent), higher full-service food away from home (FULLFAFH; 31\npercent), higher fast food away from home (FASTFOOD; 24 percent),\nhigher animal protein and beverages at home (PROTEIN; 11 percent),\nand higher processed and prepared foods at home (PREPARED; 11\npercent). Table 2 describes these clusters. The AVERAGE group has\nabout average expenditure shares when compared with the total sam-\nple. They do have higher shares for fresh fruits and vegetables and full\narticles\n \nservice food away from home, and a lower fast food share. The FULL-\nFAFH cluster has the lowest shares allocated to sugars and sweets, fats\nand oils, soda and juice. The PREPARED cluster appears to take time\nsaving routes to food purchasing. This cluster has the highest shares for\nprepared foods, other meats (includes cold cuts) and eggs (quick cook-\ning protein), and the largest shares for sugars/sweets and fats/oils. The\nPROTEIN cluster spends almost one-fifth of its food budget on animal\nprotein and five percent on soda and juice. The CE does not provide\na breakdown on the type of beverage beyond these, nor whether the\nbeverages are sugar sweetened or low calorie. The PROTEIN cluster\nhas among the lowest shares for sugars/sweets. The PREPARED food\ncluster has the highest proportion of overweight respondents (70 per-\ncent), followed by FASTFOOD (62 percent), PROTEIN (61 percent),\nAVERAGE (60 percent) and FULLFAFH (47 percent). The percentage\nof overweight respondents differs significantly across clusters, as do\nexpenditure shares on individual foods. On average, all clusters are\nclassified as overweight.\nNext, time use patterns were examined. Household work, personal\ncare, caring for others, work hours, education hours, volunteer hours,\nsleep, sleeplessness, physical activity, commuting time, socializing, non-\nactive leisure, and screen time were included in a cluster analysis, as\ndescribed above. As with the food groups, there were no additions or\ndeletions of time use in the cluster analysis that could lead to sensi-\ntivity in the emerging clusters. Table 3 describes the five clusters that\nemerged. Paid workers (WORKERS; 30 percent) spent over 8h per day\nin paid employment. The most physically active cluster (ACTIVE; 6\npercent) spent over 1h per day in physical activity, had the highest levels\nof sleeplessness and the lowest percentage of overweight respondents (42\npercent). Respondents who spent the most time in household activities\nand caring for others, more than 3h per day (HHWORK; 30 percent),\nalso reported getting the most sleep (~6h), screen time, and time in\nnon-active leisure (more than 5h). SOCIALITE (11 percent) spent the\nmost time socializing (more than 3 hours) and reported the most time in\npersonal care activities. VOLUNTEERS (5 percent) spent the most time\nin non-paid work, both in volunteering (more than 1.5h) and pursuing\neducation (almost 3h). Time uses differ significantly across clusters as\ndo the percentages of overweight respondents. On average, all clusters\nare overweight.\nStandard t-tests were run to examine differences in food-related time\nuses and behaviors between healthy weight and overweight cohorts.\nData included: number of primary and secondary eating occasions, time\nspent in secondary drinking (other than water), the primary cook in\nthe household, and time spent in meal preparation and clean-up. Sig-\nnificant differences were found between healthy weight and overweight\nindividuals in time spent eating and drinking, total minutes per meal\nand whether the respondent is the major cook in the household. Healthy\nweight individuals report spending more time eating and drinking and a\nlarger percentage are the major cook for the household. Table 4 presents\nthese results.\nBivariate results presented in Tables 1\u00ad4 show that the percentage of\noverweight respondents differs significantly across demographics and\neating and time use patterns, with fewer differences in time use related to\neating and drinking. Next, we regressed demographic, eating, and time\nuse pattern variables on both the probability of being overweight and on\nBMI. The method of truncated regression is used. A variation of the Tobit\nmodel, the probability of a non-limit outcome is determined separately\nfrom the level of the non-limit outcome. When applied to a model of\noverweight, the estimation of BMI is determined separately for healthy\nweight and overweight individuals, given the probability of being over-\nweight. Truncated regression allows the sign of individual coefficients\nto differ in the estimation of the probabilities compared to the degree\nof overweight, which is not possible in the Tobit regression model (for\ndetails of the statistical approach, see refs. 41,42).\nThree models are estimated. The dependent variables are the prob-\nability of being overweight (BMI 25), BMI for BMI 25 and BMI for\nBMI >18 and <25. Results of the estimation includes the probability of\ncrossing the overweight threshold and the effect of the independent\nvariables on BMI for both healthy weight and overweight individuals.\nBecause the focus of this paper is on overweight, we omit the healthy\nweight results. Independent variables include the food pattern and time\nuse clusters. Because these are 0/1 \"dummy variables,\" we leave out the\nHHWORK time use and AVERAGE food pattern cluster as the reference\ngroup. While any group can be the reference group, we chose to use the\nfood pattern group closest to the sample average and the time use pattern\ngroup with the most time in spent in the household. There was no \"aver-\nage\" time use cluster. The HHWORK cluster represented 30 percent of the\ntotal sample and had a percentage of overweight individuals that was clos-\nest to the national average. We also included the individual food-related\ntime use variables: number of primary eating and drinking occasions,\nnumber of secondary eating occasions, time spent in secondary drinking,\ntime spent in food preparation and clean-up, time spent in primary eating\nand drinking, minutes per meal (every additional 10min per primary eat-\ning and drinking occasion), whether the respondent is the major cook in\nthe household and an interaction term between major cook and cooking/\nclean-up time. The demographic variables age, race, education, income,\npresence of children, region of residence, living in a metropolitan area,\nand self-reported poor health status are also included.\nTable 1Demographic characteristics of the sample\nVariable\nTotal\nSample\nHealthy\nweight Overweight\nCritical\nvalue\n Less than\n high school\nIncome (%)\nChildren in\nhousehold\n(% have)\narticles\n \nResults\nTables 5 and 6 present regression results. The last column of\nTable 5 presents the marginal effect on the probability of being\noverweight. Each marginal effect is interpreted, \"holding all the\nother included variables constant, the effect of (independent\nvariable x) increases/decreases the probability of being over-\nweight by...\" For example, holding all other included variables\nconstant, the effect of being Black on the sample as a whole\nincreases the probability of being overweight by 24 percent. The\nmodel predicts the probability of being overweight correctly\nin 80 percent of the cases. For individuals in the >35\u00ad40 age\ngroup and the >40\u00ad45 age group, the probabilities of being\noverweight compared to those age 50 and older are 0.08 and\n0.09 probability points lower. Even in this limited age cohort,\nthe probability of being overweight increases with age. Being\nblack or of a race other than white increases the probability of\nbeing overweight by 0.24 and 0.22 probability points, respec-\ntively. Being Asian decreases the probability of overweight by\n0.36 points. Compared to those living in the Northeast, the\nMidwestern, Southern and Western residents all have higher\nprobabilities of being overweight. Those in poor health have a\nprobability of being overweight 0.19 points higher. Education\n(reference group is high school graduate) and income (refer-\nence group is <135 percent of poverty level), are insignificant.\nCeteris Paribus, income has no effect on the probability of\nbeing overweight.\nTable 2Expenditure shares for food by food pattern cluster\nF-stat*\n*All food expenditures significant at P < 0.001.\narticles\n \nThe probability of the full service restaurant pattern\n(FULLFAFH) cluster being overweight that is 0.10 points\nlower than the AVERAGE group. The time use cluster that\nspends more time in education and volunteer activities\n(VOLUNTEER) has a probability of being overweight that\nis 0.12 points lower compared with the reference HHWORK\ngroup. And, while, individual eating behaviors are not signifi-\ncant in predicting the probability of being overweight, their\ninfluence becomes apparent when the level of BMI is pre-\ndicted, given an individual has crossed the overweight thresh-\nold, as seen below.\nTable 6 presents results of the truncated regression esti-\nmates that predict BMI for overweight individuals. The coef-\nficients are interpreted, \"what is the incremental effect on BMI\nof each individual independent variable, given an individual\nhas a BMI greater than 25 and less than 50?\" Demographic\nvariables and time use and food patterns significantly impact\nBMI. While the probability estimates showed that individuals\nity of being overweight compared to those of >45\u00ad50 years of\nage, if overweight, their BMI is predicted to be 4.85 and 7.59\npoints higher than the oldest group. While all of the included\nracial groups, compared to whites, were significant in predict-\ning the probability of overweight, only blacks have a signifi-\ncantly higher BMI once they are overweight, increasing BMI\nby 7.74 points. Education was insignificant in predicting the\nprobability of being overweight. If an individual is overweight,\nindividuals with some college education have a predicted BMI\n7.34 points higher compared to having completed high school.\nPoor health was significant in predicting the probability of\nbeing overweight. It increases BMI 9.10 points for an over-\nweight individual. While income was insignificant in predict-\ning the probability of overweight, individuals with incomes\nTable 3 Minutes of time use for each time use cluster\nF-Stat*\nTable 4 Food-related behaviors\nTotal sample Healthy weight Overweight\nt-statistic\narticles\n \nBMI 5.06 points lower than individuals earning incomes less\nIndividual time uses related to food were insignificant in\npredicting the probability of being overweight. However, once\nan individual crosses the overweight threshold, these time uses\nare significant in predicting BMI. Each additional reported pri-\nmary eating occasion increases BMI by 3.96 points. For every\nadditional 10min spent in secondary drinking, predicted BMI\nincreases by 0.55 points. Interpreting the effects of being the\nprimary cook and time spent in food preparation and clean-up\nis more complicated because of the included interaction effect.\nTable 5 Probit estimates of the probability of overweight\nVariable Coefficient P value\nMarginal\neffect\nNumber of primary\neating and drinking\noccasions\nNumber of secondary\neating occasions\nTime spent in\nsecondary drinking\nTime spent in primary\neating and drinking\nFood preparation and\nclean-up\npoverty\nTable 6Truncated regression: estimates for overweight level\nVariable Coefficient P value\nLess than\nhigh school\nNumber of primary eating and drinking\noccasions\nNumber of secondary eating\noccasions\nTime spent in primary eating and\ndrinking\narticles\n \nIsolating the effect of being the primary cook is calculated as:\nand clean-up) \u00f7 0.08 food preparation and clean-up.\nBeing the primary cook decreases BMI 1.72 points for over-\nweight individuals. Isolating the effect of food preparation and\nclean-up time reveals that an additional 10min spent cooking\nand cleaning-up decreases BMI by 0.13 points.\nTwo food pattern clusters are significant in predicting BMI\nfor overweight individuals. Those in the full service food away\nfrom home cluster (FULLFAFH) have a predicted BMI 6.60\npoints lower than those in the AVERAGE cluster. Individuals in\nthe higher protein (PROTEIN) at home cluster have a predicted\nBMI 7.05 points lower compared with the AVERAGE cluster.\nThree time use clusters are significant. Given an individual\nis overweight, those classified as having the most time spent\nin social activities (SOCIALIATE), have a predicted BMI 5.88\npoints higher. Those classified as spending most time in vol-\nunteer activities (VOLUNTEER) have a predicted BMI 2.27\npoints lower compared to the HHWORK cluster. And, the\nACTIVE cluster has a predicted BMI 10.70 points lower com-\npared to the HHWORK cluster.\nDiscussion\nThis research adds to the literature in several ways. Three\npopulation-based data sets are linked to obtain a richer set of\nvariables for which to analyze the factors that contribute to the\nprobability of being overweight and BMI for both overweight\nand healthy weight individuals. This study shows the impor-\ntance of isolating the effect of these factors on the probability\nof being overweight separate from their effects on BMI once\nthe individual becomes overweight.\nForsingleheadedfemalehouseholdsbetweentheagesof31and\n50, variables that impact the probability of being overweight and\nvariables that predict BMI for overweight individuals differ in\nsignificance, magnitude, and in some cases direction of effect.\nLifestyle pattern clusters of time use and food patterns impact\nboth the probability of being overweight and BMI. The impact of\nindividual food-related time uses shows that knowledge of cook-\ning and eating patterns affect the BMI of overweight individuals.\nIncreases in cooking time are associated with a decrease in BMI.\nPrevious literature links demographic characteristics\nand obesity. When time use and eating pattern clusters are\naccounted for, race and region of residence continue to be\nsignificant predictors of the probability of being overweight.\nPeople residing in the northeast have a lower probability of\nbeing overweight and given they are overweight have a lower\nBMI, except when compared to people living in the south. The\neffect of income is not found to be as robust as other research\nbut this research controls for other variables (6,10,36). In our\nlimited age cohort, being older within the age range increases\nBMI only for already overweight individuals. These results\nstress the importance of maintaining a healthy weight in early\nadulthood. H1 is partially supported, and the effect of demo-\ngraphic variables depends on whether the dependent variable\nis the prediction of the probability of overweight or the predic-\ntion of BMI once the overweight threshold is passed.\nResults also show that for overweight individuals, more pri-\nmary eating and drinking occasions and time spent in second-\nary drinking increase BMI. While results for the truncated\nregression to estimate BMI for healthy weight individuals are\nnot presented in this paper, more drinking occasions are asso-\nciated with a decrease in BMI and number of primary eating\noccasions has no impact on BMI. This study is one of the first,\nin a multivariate analysis, to show that cooking at home has a\nmitigating effect on BMI for overweight individuals. Results\ncorroborate the idea that a resurgence of home economics type\nclasses within school curriculum and community cooking\nskills interventions might serve a useful purpose (43).\nOur results also show that a lifestyle that includes larger budget\nsharesallocatedtofull-servicerestaurants(FULLFAFH)isassoci-\natedwithalowerprobabilityofbeingoverweightandalowerBMI\nfor the overweight sample compared to the AVERAGE cluster.\nLookingacrossexpendituresharesinTable2,theAVERAGEclus-\nter spends \"about\" the average on most food categories, including\nfood away from home, while the FULLFAFH group spends less\non several at home categories, including protein (looking across\nmeats, eggs, and nuts), dairy, breads, cereals, sugars and sweets,\nfats and oils, and soda and juice. Further research is necessary to\ninvestigatewhetherthosewhospendalargershareoftheirbudget\non full-service food away from home substitute more expen-\nsive, lower in overall calorie foods for food at home and have a\nlower overall calorie intake compared to the AVERAGE cluster\nwhich has average shares on most food categories and higher\nthan average shares on full-service food away from home. The\nhigher protein (PROTEIN) overweight cluster also has signifi-\ncantly lower BMIs compared to the AVERAGE cluster. Looking\nat other shares in the PROTEIN group reveals that this cluster\nhas the lowest expenditure shares for both fast and full-service\nfood away from home. Further research is needed to investigate\nwhether the FULLFAFH cluster substitutes restaurant meals for\nfood at home and the PROTEIN cluster substitutes food at home\nfor restaurant meals, while the AVERAGE cluster eats both at\nand away from home. For the overweight sample, being in the\nfast food cluster (FASTFOOD) has no effect on BMI. Therefore,\nthis study does not show that being classified in a cluster with\nhigher than average food away from home shares is associated\nwith a higher probability of being overweight or a higher BMI if\noverweight, as has been suggested, though not overwhelmingly\nfood away from home must be interpreted within overall dietary\npatterns. H2 cannot be supported by this analysis.\nThis study also shows that certain time use patterns are asso-\nciated with being overweight and BMI level. Belonging to the\ncluster that spent the most time in educational and volunteer\nactivities decreased the probability of being overweight by\n0.12 probability points, but had no significant effect on BMI\nfor overweight individuals. On the other hand, while spending\nmore time in the labor market (WORKERS), in physical activ-\nity (ACTIVES), or socializing (SOCIALITE) did not signifi-\ncantly impact the probability of being overweight, individuals\nand 5.88 points higher compared to the HHWORK cluster. The\narticles\n \nSOCIALITE clusters had the lowest levels of physical activity\nof all clusters, and spent the most time traveling and in per-\nsonal care activities. While total calorie expenditure for travel\ncan vary if an individual actively commutes either by walking\nor by using a bicycle, research shows less than 4 percent of\nthe US population uses these transportation modes (47). The\nSOCIALITE cluster is sedentary compared to the other clus-\nters. The ACTIVE group has the lowest predicted BMI in the\noverweight group. H3 and H4, both having to do with energy\nexpenditure, are supported for overweight persons.\nOverall, considering time use and food expenditure pat-\nterns in the context of a household health production model\nadds to the understanding of the impact of time use and food\nexpenditure patterns, in addition to the importance of demo-\ngraphic characteristics on obesity. The results provide insight\ninto the complex array of factors that are associated with obes-\nity and points to both target groups and obesity prevention\nprograms. For example, blacks and minorities in the \"other\"\ngroup (including Hispanics) remain a priority target group for\nobesity prevention. Policies in the workplace should encour-\nage both places and time for physical activity. Alternatives to\nscreen time and non-active leisure alternatives must continue\nto be developed and marketed, especially to people who spend\nmuch of their time at home caring for others. The obesity epi-\ndemic is complex; a combination of variables jointly contribute\nto the probability of being overweight and to BMI.\nThere are limitations to this study. First, we have tested our\napproach on one cohort of individuals: single female headed\nhouseholds aged 31\u00ad50 years. The analysis should be repli-\ncated on other cohorts. Second, only two of the datasets used\nare linked by individual. More complete, nationally represented\ndatasets are needed. Third, food expenditures do not mean\nthe same thing as food intake. Future research should inves-\ntigate the possibility of linking the ATUS with the National\nHealth and Examination Survey data are still not fully avail-\nable. Fourth, in order to handle the complexity of the data,\nmany of the included variables are proxy measures. For exam-\nple, the composite SOCIALITE cluster gives an indication of\na variety of sedentary lifestyle behaviors and that individuals\nin this cluster who are already overweight may be engaging in\nmore energy intake and less energy output when participating\nin their social activities. Future studies should build on this\nresearch, and investigate more complexities in lifestyle patterns,\nincluding examining interaction effects between time use and\nfood expenditure patterns.\nWhen obesity is viewed within a model of health production,\nthe results corroborate what has been found in the hundreds of\nfocused studies related to the causes of obesity, and add to the\nliterature by identifying the impact of individual variables hold-\ning the effect of others constant. Such comprehensive analysis\nshould be replicated using other demographic profiles, including\nfamily types, ages, and gender of household head. Other datasets\nshould be explored, and interactions between food and time use\npatterns should be explored. Overall, this study motivates fur-\nther studies at both the focused and complex levels.\nDisclosure\nThe authors declared no conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1. Hamermesh D.
