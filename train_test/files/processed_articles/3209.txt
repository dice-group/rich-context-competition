Sargent, Points of\nDeparture\nWhat happens when fiscal or monetary policy rules change dramatically? Large\nchanges in fiscal and monetary policy rules are routinely evaluated in micro-founded dy-\nnamic equilibrium models (see for example Curdia and Finocchiaro (2013)). Two strong\nassumptions commonly underlie such exercises: agents are initially unaware of possible\npolicy changes, and agents become immediately aware of the new policy rule once it is\nimplemented. Work on Markov-switching DSGE models, such as Bianchi (2013) and Liu,\nWaggoner, and Zha (2011), dispenses of the first assumption, but retains the second. As\nSargent (2015) highlights, these assumptions represent different economic theories about\nhow firms and households in our models react to policy changes. We put forth another\neconomic theory and model agents as econometricians that have to estimate coefficients of\npolicy rules to remove the second assumption. We borrow the assumption of 'anticipated\nutility' decision-making (Kreps (1998)) that is common in the learning literature (Sargent,\nthus keep the first assumption of the standard approach in play1.\nA key theme of this paper is how random walk-like behavior (i.e. the VAR representation\nof the linearized equilibrium dynamics has eigenvalues equal to or slightly larger than 1)\ncan endogenously arise in models which under rational expectations, would only feature\nstationary dynamics. This behavior arises even though agents in our model have substan-\ntial knowledge of the economy and act as sophisticated econometricians to uncover those\nfeatures of the economy that they do not know about. It is the dynamics of the data in\nequilibrium that make the learning problem hard, leading to differences between beliefs\nof agents and the true policy rule, which in turn fuels the random walk-like behavior that\narises in equilibrium.\nWe study two stylized examples of policy transitions: one is motivated by the Volcker dis-\ninflation and studies the change of a monetary policy rule from parameter values which\nwould imply indeterminacy under full-information rational expectations to values which\nimply determinacy. We thus explicitly model the transition that is absent in papers that\nstudy separately indeterminate and determinate outcomes for the US, such as Lubik and\nSchorfheide (2004). Throughout this example we keep fiscal policy passive in the language\nof Leeper (1991) and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999). We revisit findings by Cogley,\nMatthes, and Sbordone (2015), namely that even if agents think the economy is stable,\nunstable behavior can arise if beliefs are different enough from the actual policy rule co-\nefficients. We build on their findings, but use a model that allows for fiscal and monetary\npolicy interaction along the lines of Leeper (1991) and show that the economy in this\nscenario will most likely feature random walk-like behavior rather than outright explosive\n1Bianchi and Melosi (2013) introduce a very specific type of learning into a Markov-switching DSGE\nmodel: Their agents do observe the policy rule coefficients currently in play, but are uncertain how\npersistent the current regime is.\nbehavior that would be rejected by the data. We also show that this behavior can persist\nfor many periods. It is important to emphasize that our focus here is on unusual (when\nconsidered against the backdrop of recent policy behavior) policy changes. We are not\nstudying small (or 'modest') policy changes such as those emphasized by Leeper and Zha\nThe second example we study is a transition from an active monetary policy/passive fiscal\npolicy regime to a situation where fiscal policy is active and monetary policy is passive.\nWe show that this policy scenario implies behavior of inflation and debt that is in line\nwith observations since the financial crisis: random walk-like behavior for debt, but also\nlow and stable inflation. These outcomes make learning about the true policy coefficients\nfor the monetary policy rule hard for the agents in our model, and lead to substantial\nperiods of confusion about the nature of equilibrium.\nThe agents in our model do not place any restrictions on the kind of equilibria they con-\nsider (their `perceived law of motion', or PLM): both determinate and indeterminate as\nwell as temporarily explosive equilibria are considered as possible outcomes by our agents.\nOnce we remove arbitrary restrictions on the kind of equilibria considered by agents, they\ncan easily find themselves in situations where they mis-perceive the nature of the equi-\nlibrium: In the first example, they might believe that equilibrium indeterminacy persists\nfor substantial periods and, in the second example, agents are led to believe that the\neconomy is temporarily explosive. Temporarily explosive dynamics can also be a feature\nof a Markov-switching rational expectations model, an outcome highlighted by Bianchi\nWe endow our agents with substantial knowledge of the economy. They are only uncer-\ntain about the finite dimensional policy rule parameter vector. Furthermore, we endow\nthem with the same knowledge of the timing of the structural change that agents in the\nstandard approach have: Once policy changes, firms and households suspect that policy\nhas indeed changed. In the standard approach, agents immediately learn the new policy\nrule coefficients, so their suspicions are instantaneously confirmed. In our model, agents\ninstead have to estimate the new policy rule coefficients.2 We do so to minimize the differ-\nences between our approach and the standard approach outlined above. Notwithstanding,\neven with this substantial knowledge of the economy, equilibrium outcomes in our envi-\nronment are substantially different from those determined using the standard approach.\nWe assume that private agents do not have a suspicion about the direction of the change\nin the policy rule coefficients. Any announcement about the magnitude or direction of\nthe policy change is thus viewed as incredible by our agents.\nOur focus on agents that only need to learn about the coefficients of policy rules sets this\npaper apart from the earlier literature which studied monetary-fiscal policy interaction\nunder learning such as Eusepi and Preston (2011) and Eusepi and Preston (2013), who\ninstead endow their agents with less knowledge about the structure of the economy.\nThe interaction of fiscal and monetary policy under rational expectations in DSGE model\nwas pioneered by Leeper (1991). Empirical analyses include Traum and Yang (2011) and\nBhattarai, Lee, and Park (2012). We use similar models and borrow parameter estimates\nfrom that literature, but refrain from using full-information rational expectations.\nThe effects of regime changes in monetary policy on beliefs and economic dynamics has\n2We model this suspicion by exogenously increasing the uncertainty about policy rule coefficients in\nthe period in which policy actually changes. Section 4 describes this in detail.\nbeen studied in Andolfatto and Gomme (2003). Changes in fiscal policy and their ef-\nfects in an RBC economy with distortionary taxation has been studied in Hollmayr and\nMatthes (2013). Finally, policy uncertainty more generally has recently received substan-\ntially more attention due to the work of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), who quantify\npolicy uncertainty using various measures and show its impact using VARs.\nOur approach is different from the previous literature in that we explicitly try to only use\nminimal departure from a full information rational expectations approach, restrict the\nprivate agents' model uncertainty to the policy rule parameters and focus on the tran-\nsition dynamics rather than asymptotic results (i.e. whether equilibria are 'learnable').\nThe agents in our model use the Kalman Filter to estimate coefficients. We thus make\nthem sophisticated econometricians who could not easily improve upon their estimation\nroutine.\nThe next section uses the model in Leeper (1991) and its analytical solution to shed\nsome light on how changes in beliefs alter equilibrium dynamics and can lead to random\nwalk-like behavior. We then turn to our benchmark DSGE model before describing the\nlearning methodology in detail and discussing the differences between outcomes under\nlearning and using the standard approach.\n2 An Analytical Example: Beliefs and Equilibrium\nIn this section we highlight the key forces underlying our main results in a simpler context\nthat allows for analytical results - the model in Leeper (1991). We do not explicitly model\nlearning in this section, but instead ask a simpler question - what happens if beliefs about\npolicy rule coefficients held by private agents happen to be wrong? In the language of\nthe learning literature, the agents' perceived law of motion (PLM) differs from the actual\nlaw of motion (ALM). Since agents in our benchmark DSGE model will be wrong about\nthe policy rules while they are learning about policy coefficients after a policy change,\nthis exercise will shed some light on the forces driving our result in the learning model\ndescribed in later sections. Here we focus on two examples: one in which agents know that\nmonetary policy is active and fiscal policy is passive, but do not know the exact value of the\npolicy rule coefficients, and a second situation in which agents still believe that monetary\npolicy is active and fiscal policy is passive, but the actual policy rule coefficients imply\nactive fiscal policy and passive monetary policy. For the first example, we will focus on\nhow changing beliefs can alter equilibrium dynamics more broadly, while, for the second\nexample, we explicitly show how and in what variables random walk-like behavior can\noccur. We will revisit the second example in this section later for our benchmark DSGE\nmodel. For analytical results that speak to the existence of non-stationary dynamics in\nthe first example (in which fiscal policy stays passive throughout), we refer the reader to\n3Cogley et al. (2015) do not explicitly model fiscal policy in their analytical example, but the underlying\nassumption is passive fiscal policy, as is common in textbook New Keynesian models.\nThe form of the monetary policy rule in Leeper (1991) (where monetary policy reacts contemporaneously\nto inflation) means that changes in beliefs about monetary policy (while keeping fiscal policy fixed) will\nnot affect the matrix multiplying lagged state variables in the equilibrium law of motion. Thus, Leeper's\npassive fiscal policy active fiscal policy\nactive monetary policy unique equilibrium no stable equilibrium\npassive monetary policy multiple equilibria unique equilibrium\nTable 1: The nomenclature of equilibria and policies in Leeper (1991).\nTo start, it is useful to first revisit the nomenclature introduced by Leeper (1991) in order\nto discriminate between different classes of equilibria under rational expectations. Table\n1 does this. We describe below exactly what parameter values constitute active or passive\npolicy, but, broadly speaking, passive fiscal policy describes a situation in which the fiscal\nauthority acts to stabilize debt, whereas active monetary policy describes a situation in\nwhich monetary policy tries to counteract inflation sufficiently.\nWe now turn to the economy studied in Leeper (1991). The underlying nonlinear model\nis described in that paper. To summarize, it is an endowment economy that features lump-\nsum taxation, money in the utility function and monetary policy that follows a Taylor\nrule. For the sake of brevity, we will directly focus on the linearized system in inflation\nt\nand debt bt\nEt\n= t\n+ t\nt\n+ bt\nt\n+ t\nt\n= \n+ \nt\nt\n= \n+ \nt\nThe  parameters are convolutions of parameters and steady states and are defined in\nLeeper (1991). Equation (1) is the result of combining the representative households con-\nsumption Euler equation and the monetary policy rule. Equation (2) is the government's\nbudget constraint, where we have plugged in the optimality condition for money holdings\nand the fiscal and monetary policy rules. A key parameter for our results is the discount\nfactor . t\nand t\nare exogenous policy shocks - the policy rules used in deriving these\nequations are\nRt\n= t\n+ t\nt\n+ t\nwhere Rt\nis the nominal interest rate and t\nare lump-sum taxes.\nTo analyze the dynamics of the system, we can stack the first two equations above:5\nmodel is less suited to showing how random walk-like behavior can arise in the example inspired by the\nVolcker disinflation for our benchmark model.\n4We will present the non-linear model for our benchmark case later.\n5For the sake of simplicity, we do not stack the exogenous laws of motion for the shocks in the system.\nOur results hold for generic laws of motion of the exogenous process as long as those processes are\nstationary. Also, to determine the properties of the equilibrium dynamics, we focus on the autoregressive\nmatrix in the equilibrium law of motion. That matrix determines stability properties as long as there is\nno root cancellation with the roots of the moving average polynomial. This turns out to be the case here.\nt\nbt\n=\n+\nt\nt\n+\n+\nTo solve the model, we have to plug in above an expression for the one-step ahead ex-\npectations of inflation as a function of pre-determined exogenous variables or exogenous\nshocks. Once we do that, the system above gives the equilibrium dynamics. The dy-\nnamics of the system and the nature of the prevailing equilibrium under full-information\nrational expectations are governed by  and -1 - . If the first term is larger than one\nin absolute value, while the second one is not, we are in a world of monetary activism and\npassive fiscal policy, whereas, in the reverse case, we are in a world of active fiscal policy\n(fiscal policy does not use taxes to stabilize debt) and passive monetary policy.\nLeeper gives the full-information rational expectations solution for inflation and expected\ninflation in the 'standard' case of active monetary policy and passive fiscal policy:\nEt\n= -\n\n - \nt\nt\n= -\n\n - \nt\nNote that fiscal shocks or the coefficient  in the fiscal policy rule do not enter either\nthe expected or actual inflation. This happens precisely because fiscal policy is passive.\nUnder rational expectations and active fiscal policy, the fiscal shocks would play a role in\ndetermining inflation, as documented by Leeper.\n2.1 The Dynamics Under a PLM When Agents Know Which\nPolicy is Active\nWe now turn to a situation where agents have incorrect beliefs about the policy rule\ncoefficients. As mentioned before, for simplicity we assume here that beliefs are not\nupdated over time, an assumption we drop later in our learning model. Just as in the\nlarger benchmark model that we use for our numerical work later, we assume here that\nagents observe all past endogenous variables, but not the policy shocks, which the agents\nhave to infer based on the observable data and their beliefs about policy rule coefficients.\nIn this section we assume that the true policy rule coefficients indeed imply that fiscal\npolicy is passive and monetary policy is active, but private agents believe that the policy\nrule parameters take on values that are not equal to the true values of those parameters.\nAgents have a degenerate prior on the policy rule coefficients given by  and  such that\n > 1 and -1 -  < 1, but  =  and  = , so agents know that fiscal policy\nis passive and monetary policy is active, but they do not know the correct parameter\nvalues.6 Given that agents think that monetary policy is governed by a policy rule with\n6We make this assumption because it simplifies the exposition. This example shares many properties\nof the first we will use for the DSGE model, but in that case initial beliefs of agents will be such that they\ncoefficient , their perceived policy shock is (we assume that  is not directly observable)\nt\n= ( - )t\n+ t\n. Their conditional expectations of inflation next period are then given\nby\nE\nt\n= -\n\n - \nt\n= -\n\n - \n(( - )t\n+ t\nIf we plug these expectations into the matrix equation above, we can see that, in this case,\nthere are two differences relative to rational expectations: first, the effect of a shock  on\nexpectations and thus contemporaneous inflation and debt can be different since now \nis in the denominator of the fraction in the equation determining expectations. Second,\nthere is an additional feedback effect governed by the differences between beliefs and actual\ncoefficients ( - )t\n. At this point, it is instructive to mention how beliefs about fiscal\npolicy enter the equilibrium dynamics. Equation (7) uses the actual policy rules and\nthe government budget constraint to solve for debt dynamics. In the true government\nbudget constraint beliefs do not directly enter. Agents use a perceived version of the\nbudget constraint (equation (2), with the true parameter values replaced by the agents'\nbeliefs and the true policy shocks replaced by the perceived policy shocks)7 to forecast\nequilibrium outcomes. The perceived fiscal shock will make their perceived government\nbudget constraint hold. As long as agents know that monetary policy is active and fiscal\npolicy is passive, beliefs about fiscal policy only enter equilibrium dynamics insofar as they\ninfluence agents' estimates of fiscal policy shocks that make the perceived government\nbudget constraint hold. This is because, under the perception of active monetary policy\nand passive fiscal policy, agents do not find fiscal shocks useful to forecast inflation, as\ncan be seen from equation (10).\n2.2 The Dynamics Under a PLM When Agents Are Confused\nAbout Which Policy is Active\nNow let us assume that agents hold the same beliefs as before, but the ALM satisfies\n < 1 and -1 -  > 1. Plugging the expectations derived in the previous section into\nthe matrix equation that describes the endogenous dynamics of the system, we get\n\n\n-\nA\nt\nbt\n=\nB\n+\n\n\n-\nt\nt\n+\nThe key insight to take away here is that t\nis still a stationary process (it is perfectly\ncorrelated with the stationary shock t\n). bt\n, on the other hand, is now non-stationary\nbecause inflation expectations and thus actual inflation do not move to offset the effects\nof |-1 - | > 1 since inflation expectations are formed according to the dynamics for\nbelieve that they live in an indeterminate equilibrium. To show how changes in beliefs alter equilibrium\ndynamics in this analytical example, we do not need to incorporate indeterminacy.\n7The perceived government budget constraint also includes perceived versions of 1\nsince those\nare functions of the perceived monetary policy rule parameter - see the definition of the  parameters in\nthe case in which monetary policy is active and fiscal policy is passive. To see this more\nclearly, we can invert the matrix on the left-hand side of the equation above (call this\nmatrix A) and multiply by the matrix multiplying the lagged endogenous variables (call\nthis matrix B). This gives us the matrix governing the endogenous dynamics in the actual\nlaw of motion. The inverse of A will also be lower triangular. To see this, we can apply\nthe formula for the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix to A. Doing so gives us the result that the\nThe eigenvalues of that matrix are 0 and -1 - . The second eigenvalue is thus larger\nthan 1 in absolute value by our assumption. In general, we assume that   0, so the sec-\nond eigenvalue is bounded from above by 1\n\n, which is around 1.01 with standard quarterly\ncalibrations of . This hints at the possibility that even if agents learn, in finite samples\ndebt can behave much like a random walk. We will see this in our learning economy.\nThis example, while abstracting from many important channels through which monetary\nand fiscal policy can influence economic outcomes, already shows that beliefs of private\nagents can have a large impact on economic outcomes and substantially alter the proper-\nties of the equilibrium. In particular, it will turn out that the random walk-like behavior\nof debt coupled with stationary inflation dynamics will also be an outcome of our larger\nmodel that we discuss next for the second policy experiment. Even though both Leeper's\nmodel and our larger DSGE model that we turn to next abstract from issues such as the\nzero-lower bound on nominal interest rates, the behavior of debt and inflation coming out\nof both models when studying the second policy experiment resembles actual data for\ndeveloped economies since the global financial crises and the subsequent changes in fiscal\npolicies.\nWhile Leeper's model is very useful for opening the hood and obtaining further insights\ninto the issues we want to study, it also has its limitations: An insight that we can only\ninfer from our benchmark economy (as we will see later) and not from Leeper's model\nis that random walk-like behavior can also occur in the first scenario where agents know\nthat monetary policy is active and fiscal policy passive.8\nWhenever eigenvalues of absolute value 1 or larger appear in arguments based on local\napproximations (as is the case here and will be the case in our benchmark model) we know\nthat we can not use simulations to approximate unconditional moments. Nonetheless, for\nsimulations or calculations based on finite time periods such as those presented in this\npaper, local approximation methods can be reliably used to approximate equilibrium dy-\nnamics when there are eigenvalues larger than 1 in play (especially when these eigenvalues\nare not much larger than 1 in absolute value). This point has been made by Kim, Kim,\n8One can use other models that can be solved analytically to show that random walk-like behavior\ncan occur in the related case where fiscal policy is not explicitly modelled - see Cogley et al. (2015).\n9The fact that the behavior of a very persistent, but stationary process is very similar to the behavior\nof a unit root process in finite samples is at the heart of many issues connected with unit-root test, for\nexample.\nOur model is a standard a medium-scale New-Keynesian model along the lines of, for\nIt incorporates nominal frictions, habits, capital utilization and, additionally, a fiscal\nsector. The government accumulates debt if its income from distortionary labor and\ncapital taxation does not match outlays for government spending, transfers, and debt\nrepayments and interest payments. First-order conditions and the complete log-linearized\nmodel may be found in the Appendix. The calibration for all parameters is standard in\nthe literature and is mostly taken from Traum and Yang (2011), who estimate a similar\nmodel using US data. We thus relegate the numerical values of the parameters to Table\n7 in the Appendix.\nThe economy is populated by a continuum of households which each have access to a\nfull set of state-contingent securities, which leads them to make the same investment and\nconsumption decisions, even though they each supply a different labor input to the labor\nmarket. Households maximize their expected utility, 10 where the instantaneous utility\nfunction of household j takes the following form:\nUj\nt\n= Ub\nt\n(Ct\n-\nt\nThe household derives utility from consumption Ct\nand disutility from hours worked L(j)t\n.\nUb\nt\nis a preference shock that follows in its log-linearized form an AR(1) process11:\nlog(ub\nt\n) = Constb\nu\n+ ub\nlog(ub\n) + ub\nt\nEach period, households can choose either to consume, invest (It\n) or save in the form of\ngovernment bonds (Bt\n).

We thus use an anticipated utility assumption along the lines of Kreps (1998), which is\ncommon in the literature on adaptive learning. A more thorough description follows in the section where\nthe learning algorithm is described in more detail.\n11Note that, throughout, lower case letters are used for log-linearized variables.\nThe household's income stems from working at the wage Wt\nand interest payments on\ntheir savings at the rate Rt\n.

Furthermore, we assume that firms that cannot reoptimize their prices\nin period t index their prices to the past inflation rate following the equation:\nPt\n(i) = Pt-1\n(i)p p\nt\nss\nProfits of firm j (in nominal terms) are then equal to\nt\n(i) = (Pt\n(j) - MCt\n(i))\nPt\n(i)\nPt\n-p\nt\nYt\nwith real marginal costs given by\nMCi,t\nt\n)W\nt\nt\nand the demand for good i Yt\n(i) as\nYt\n(i) = Yt\npt\n(i)\nPt\np\nt\n\np\nwhere p\nt\nis an exogenous markup shock to the intermediate good's price that also follows\nan AR(1) process in its log-linear form:\nlog(p\nt\n) = Constp\n+ p\nlog(p\n) + p\nt\nThe government budget constraint takes the following form:\nBt\nt\n- RK\nt\nKt\nt\n- Wt\nLt\nt\n+ Gt\n+ Zt\nWe let the labor tax rule react to past levels of debt. For simplicity, all other fiscal rules\nfollow Gaussian AR(1) processes. We assume that agents know all fiscal policy rules\nexcept for the tax rule. Government spending is given by\nlog(Gt\n) = ConstG\n+ g\n) + G\nt\nZt\ndenotes transfers which behave as follows:\nlog(Zt\n) = ConstZ\n+ z\n) + Z\nt\nAs mentioned above, the tax rate is modeled as a rule with the feedback coefficient b\n,\nwhich the agents do not know for sure and have to infer:\nlog(t\n) = Const\n+ b\n) + \nt\nUsing the debt-to-GDP ratio as the right-hand side variable instead does not alter our\nresults. Monetary policy is conducted via a simple Taylor-type rule, which is only reacting\nto lagged inflation.\nlog(Rt\n) = ConstR\n+ \n) + R\nt\nThe firms and households in our model know the form of the labor tax rule and the\nmonetary policy rule as described above, but they do not know the coefficients, which\nthey have to estimate. They also know that the government budget constraint has to hold\nin every period. We model the government and the central bank as reacting to lagged\nendogenous variables so as to circumvent endogeneity issues in the learning problem of\nprivate agents that would occur if the government and the central bank were to react\nto contemporaneous endogenous variables. Given the information and implementation\nlags present in economic policymaking, we do not think that this is an overly strong\nassumption.\nDemand on the part of the government and households in the form of investment and\nconsumption in addition to the adjustment costs related to the utilization costs must fully\nabsorb the output of the firms:\nYt\n= Ct\n+ It\n+ Gt\n+ (Vt\nMarket clearing in the bond market implies that all bonds issued by the government are\nbought by the households in the economy.\n4 Learning Mechanism\nOur approach to modeling learning is borrowed from our earlier work Hollmayr and\nThe private agents in our model observe all state variables in the economy and all\nexogenous innovations except for the true policy shocks - instead of the true policy shocks\nin the tax and monetary policy rules, they observe the perceived policy shocks, which are\nthe residuals in their corresponding estimated policy rules. They use those observations\nto estimate the coefficients of the policy rules. Firms and households know all other\naspects of the model. All private agents share the same beliefs and carry out inference\nby using the Kalman filter. The choice of the Kalman filter as the agents' estimation\nprocedure is motivated by the fact that we want to stay as close as possible to a (limited\ninformation) rational expectations setup, and the Kalman filter returns the posterior\ndistribution for conditionally linear models with Gaussian innovations such as ours.13\nThe one departure from limited information rational expectations in our setup is the use\nof the anticipated utility assumption (Kreps (1998)), which is common in the literature on\nlearning in macroeconomics (see, for example, Milani (2007)). This assumption amounts\nto the private agents using a point estimate each period to form their beliefs (rather\nthan integrating over the posterior) and not contemplating future changes in beliefs when\nmaking decisions.\nWe first describe the model that agents use to form estimates of policy rule coefficients.\nThen, we will describe what those estimates imply for the agents' view about the dynamics\nof the economy - we derive their perceived law of motion (PLM). Finally, we ask what\nthose perceptions imply for actual equilibrium dynamics - we derive the actual law of\nmotion (ALM) for the model.\nWe denote by t\nthe vector of policy rule coefficients \nand b\nthat agents want to\nestimate. In order for agents to be able to use the Kalman Filter for inference, we need to\nbuild a state-space system that encompasses our assumptions about the learning behavior\nof agents. The observation equation is obtained by stacking the monetary policy rule\nand the fiscal policy rule for taxes, whereas the state equation represents the perceived\ndynamics in policy rule coefficients.\nThe vector of observables t\nt\n=\nlog(Rt\n) - Rc\nlog(t\n) - c\nThe observation equation is then:\nt\nt\n+ t\nwhere t\ncollects the iid disturbances in the policy rules. Xt-1\ncollects the right-hand side\nvariables in the two policy rules, lagged inflation and lagged debt respectively. What is\nleft to specify then is the perceived law of motion for t\n- how do firms and households in\nthe economy think policy rule coefficients change over time? We study two assumptions:\nagents either know when the policy rule changes and take into account that policy rule\ncoefficients before and after the break date are fixed, or they suspect that policy changes\nevery period. The following law of motion for the coefficients encodes these assumptions,\ninspired by the literature on time-varying coefficient models in empirical macroeconomics\n13For a comparison of learning based on the Kalman Filter and learning based on recursive least squares\nalgorithms that are also common in the literature, see Sargent and Williams (2005).\n14For simplicity, we assume that the steady states are known to the private agents (Cogley et al. (2015)\nhighlight the fact that the differences between dynamics under learning and the full information case\nemerge mainly from different views held by agents on policy rule response coefficients, not intercepts).\nGiven their knowledge of the steady state and last period's estimates for the policy rule coefficients,\nagents can back out an estimate of the intercepts in the policy rule, which they use in their state space\nsystem. Those estimates are denoted below with a hat.\nt\nt\nIf we set the variance of t\nto a conformable matrix of zeroes, then the private agents in\nour model believe that policy rule coefficients do not change and they estimate unknown\nconstant coefficients. The indicator function 1t\nselects in what periods agents perceive\nthere to be a change in policy. We will assume that this indicator function is 0 unless the\npolicy rule actually changes.\nGiven beliefs for t\n, agents in our model will adhere to the anticipated utility theory of\ndecision-making: they will act as if t\nis going to be fixed at the currently estimated\nlevel forever onwards. This is a common assumption in the literature on learning, see for\nexample Milani (2007). We use the posterior mean forecast Et-1\n(t\ncalculated\nvia the Kalman Filter as a point estimate which the agents in the model condition on\nwhen forming expectations. By the random walk assumption on the parameters that\nagents use in the Kalman filter, this also implies that t|t-1\n).\nIf we denote the vector of all variables (plus a constant intercept) in the model economy\nby Yt\n, then we can stack the log-linearized equilibrium conditions (approximated around\nthe steady state, which we assume is known to agents) and the estimated policy rules to\nget the log-linearized perceived law of motion in the economy:\n)Yt\n)E\nt\n+ D\nt\n\nt\ncontains the standardized (i.e. variance 1) actual shocks that agents observe as well\nas the standardized perceived policy shocks (the residuals in the estimated policy rules).\nThose residuals are standardized because we choose to include the standard deviations\nof the shocks in the system matrices. Because we use the anticipated utility assumption,\nagents act as if their beliefs will not change in the future and this system can be solved\nusing a number of standard algorithms for the solution of linearized rational expectations\nmodels such as Gensys (Sims (1994)).16 The resulting reduced form perceived law of\nmotion is given by\nYt\n)\nt\n) solves the following matrix quadratic equation17:\n) = (A(t|t-1\n) - B(t|t-1\nand G(t|t-1\n) is given by\n) = (A(t|t-1\nTo derive the ALM, we replace the perceived policy rule coefficients in C(t|t-1\n) with\n15This assumption has been applied in the learning literature by Sargent et al. (2006), for example.\n16If the estimated policy rule coefficients imply an indeterminate equilibrium, we use the equilibrium\nreturned by Gensys.\n17The perceived law of motion can be derived by assuming a VAR perceived law of motion of order 1\nand then using the method of undetermined coefficients.\nthe actual policy rule coefficients and use the actual innovation vector t\n:\n)Yt\n)E\nt\n+ Cactual\n+ Dt\nTo solve the model, we can plug the PLM into the ALM twice to get\n)Yt\n)\nt\n) + Cactual\n+ Dt\nNote that there are two types of shocks appearing in the last equation: the true and\nthe perceived shocks. We can solve for the dynamics of Yt\nby only inverting A(t|t-1\n)\nas long as we can derive an expression for the perceived shocks that only depends on\npre-determined and exogenous variables. Fortunately enough, this is true in our case:\n\nt\n= t\n+ IP(Cactual\n) - C(t|t-1\nwhere IP denotes a selection matrix that selects those rows of the vector it multiplies which\nare associated with the policy instruments about whose dynamics the agents are learning\nand rescales those rows by the inverse of the standard deviation of the corresponding\npolicy shock.\nPlugging that expression into equation (43) we can derive the reduced form actual law of\nmotion:\nYt\n)\nt\n) + B(t|t-1\n))\n)IP(Cactual\n) - C(t|t-1\nThis derivation departs from the derivation used in Cogley et al. (2015) because we found\nour approach of solving for the equilibrium dynamics to be more numerically stable (once\nwe have solved for the ALM, our approach only requires invertibility of A(t|t-1\n)).\n5 Equilibrium Outcomes Under Learning\nWe now turn to simulating our learning economy. We consider the following two scenarios\ndescribed: First, we consider a scenario where we leave fiscal policy constant at all times.\nIt is passive in the sense that it stabilizes debt. Monetary policy is assumed to switch\nfrom passive to active: \nchanges from 0.8 to 1.5. This scenario is introduced to broadly\nmimic the disinflation period during Paul Volcker's chairmanship of the Federal Reserve\nWe then consider a second scenario in which monetary policy becomes passive and distor-\ntionary taxes react less to the level of debt. In particular, we consider a one-time switch\nin the policy rule coefficients \nand b\nthe economy undergoes a switch from monetary dominance to fiscal dominance. This sce-\nnario is meant to approximate the situation in many developed countries after the recent\nfinancial crisis. The numerical values for the policy rule parameters pre- and post-policy\nchange for both scenarios are in line with parameter estimates for the US economy (Traum\nTo keep the number of additional parameters manageable and to keep those parameters\ninterpretable, we assume agents use a covariance matrix of the innovations in the perceived\npolicy rule coefficients of the following form19:\nE(t\nt\n) =\nFor simplicity, we will use the same calibration for both scenarios. The initial values\nof the parameters are given by the pre-policy change true values - we can think of this as\nthe agents initially living in a world where any learning process has converged. For scale,\nwe use 1 as a benchmark value, but we also show selected results for 2 and 4. Agents\nthus experience a shock that is either a 1 standard deviation shock, a shock of size half a\nstandard deviation, or a one-fourth standard deviation shock.\n6.1 A Switch From Passive to Active Monetary Policy - Revis-\niting Volcker\nFigure 1 shows the probability that the perceived equilibrium of the private agents is\ndeterminate. The black line gives the actual equilibrium behavior and the colored lines\ngives the probabilities for the different sizes of perceived policy changes. We see that,\ndepending on the prior of the size of the policy change, initially the probability that\nagents know that the policy rules actually imply a unique equilibrium after the policy\nchange is only between 20% and 50%. Furthermore, learning about the nature of the\nequilibrium is slow. Before we turn to figuring out why this is, we want to point out that\nagents in our simulations for this scenario never think that they are in a situation in which\nthe equilibrium is unstable - therefore the complement of the probability plotted in figure 1\nis indeed the probability that the agents think the equilibrium is still indeterminate. Does\nthe fact that agents never think that the equilibrium is unstable imply that the actual\nequilibrium dynamics are stable? Figure 2 answers this. It plots for each simulation the\nlargest eigenvalue in absolute value of F(t\n) encountered in that simulation versus the\nnumber of periods for which an eigenvalue of that matrix is larger than 1 in absolute\nvalue. First, we see that large eigenvalues are pervasive in this scenario. All simulations\nhave at least one period with eigenvalues larger than 1. Second, the eigenvalues, while\nlarger than 1, are not substantially larger than 1, so the economy does not explode within\na few periods. Rather, eigenvalues of this magnitude imply random walk-like behavior.\nThird, there are many simulations that feature large eigenvalues for substantial periods\n18We choose not to put the policy switch at the beginning of the simulations in order to minimize the\neffect of the choice of the initial covariance matrix for the Kalman Filter.\n19We have used covariance matrices of this form in our previous work and found them useful for\ninterpreting the perceived amount of time variation.\nof time - the probability of random walk-like behavior is substantial. And finally, there\nis a negative relationship between the size of the largest eigenvalue during a simulation\nand the number of periods for which the simulation feature random walk-like behavior.\nThis last feature can be explained by simple econometrics: the larger the eigenvalue is,\nthe more volatile the economy tends to be. If there is more volatility, then the agents can\nmore easily identify the post-policy change parameters since the right-hand side variables\nin their models become more volatile. But how can it be that the economy features\nrandom walk-like behavior when the perceived law of motion is stable? The logic behind\nthis result is given in Cogley et al. (2015). (This paper does not focus on the size of the\neigenvalues, however, and instead focuses on solving for an optimal monetary policy rule.)\nThe logic can also be seen by revisiting the equation determining F(t|t-1\n):\n) + B(t|t-1\n))\n)IP(Cactual\n) - C(t|t-1\n)))\nThe first term on the right-hand side gives the equilibrium dynamics under the perceived\nlaw of motion, which are always stable in this scenario. However, the second term on the\nright-hand side features the difference between actual and perceived laws of motion. If\nthat difference is large enough, the eigenvalues of the entire matrix can become larger than\n1 in absolute value, even though the perceived law of motion is stable. In the standard\napproach to modeling policy changes, we do not see random walk-like behavior - the\neconomy switches from one stable equilibrium to another. To see what impact this has\non equilibrium outcomes, figure 3 plots the difference between the outcomes under the\nstandard approach and the learning approach. To obtain these results, we use the same\nshock series for both approaches, calculate the levels of the relevant variables and derive\nthe ratio of the median under one approach to the median under the other approach,\nnormalized by the steady state. For any variable at time j, we thus plot\nDiffW\nj\n=\n(Wlearning\nj\n- Wstandard\nj\n)\nW\nwhere Wlearning\nj\nis the median outcome in levels under learning and Wstandard\nj\nthe cor-\nresponding outcome for the standard approach. To make the differences in GDP more\nvisible, we plot cumulative differences for GDP instead:\nDiffW\nj\n=\nj\n(Wlearning\nt\nt\n)\nW\nWe also plot the average parameter estimates.\nWe can see that sizeable differences arise for GDP, where the differences are most\nvisible. Agents learn about the monetary policy coefficient slowly - inflation is not volatile\nenough to make them learn faster. Nonetheless, differences are -maybe surprisingly- small.\nEven under rational expectations, our model features substantial persistence in many\nvariables, so the emergence of random walk-like behavior does not lead to vastly different\noutcomes.20 This does not mean that our findings are not important for outcomes - we\n20This is also evidenced by the standard deviations of the variables (which we omit here for the sake\ntime\nProb. of determinate Solution\nFigure 1: Perceived equilibria in the `Volcker' experiment\nEigenvalues\nPeriods of Explosiveness\nScatter Plot\nFigure 2: Persistence in the `Volcker' experiment\nCum.

Also, even though we do not explicitly model credible policy communication in\nthis paper, our findings highlight that policy communication could be useful if it speeds\nup learning of the agents.\n6.2 The Dawn of Active Fiscal Policy\nFor our second experiment, the analytical results from Leeper's model already hint at\nthe strong possibility of random walk-like behavior when fiscal policy becomes active,\nbut private agents have incomplete knowledge of this. Note that, even if agents learn\nquickly about changes in the fiscal policy rule, they can be misled if learning about the\nmonetary policy coefficient is slow. This is exactly what happens in our second scenario.\nFigure 4 plots the probability of a stable perceived equilibrium. While, under rational\nexpectations, agents would know that the equilibrium is always stable, here agents are\nindeed misled and believe they are in an unstable equilibrium. In contrast to the first\nexample, here even the perceived law of motion is unstable. This was not the case in our\nanalysis of Leeper's model, where we assumed a stable PLM for simplicity. An unstable\nPLM can lead to instability in the ALM because of the first term on the right-hand side\nin the equation for F(t|t-1\n). The instability of the PLM creeps into the ALM in our\ncase, as can be seen by figure 5, which plots the largest eigenvalue in absolute value in\nthe ALM versus the number of periods for which an eigenvalue larger than 1 in absolute\nvalue is present in the equilibrium dynamics. Are all variables affected by this random\nwalk-like behavior? Figure 6 shows some randomly selected sample paths from our sim-\nulation for inflation and debt. In spite of the difference in the nature of the PLM, we see\nthe same results as for Leeper's model: inflation is low and stable, whereas debt is very\npersistent and displays random walk-like behavior. It is the stable behavior of inflation\nthat makes learning about the monetary policy coefficient hard, as can be seen by the\naverage estimate in figure 7. While debt is volatile enough in our economy so that the\naverage coefficient for the fiscal policy rule is learned almost immediately, 21 it takes a\nof brevity) under the two approaches - they are not very different from each other for this scenario.\n21Not all simulations feature fiscal policy coefficient that directly collapse to the true value, but they\nall move in the right direction and the variation is quite small, so focusing on the average estimate across\ntime\nProb. of stable PLM\nFigure 4: Perceived equilibria in the second experiment\nlong time to learn about the change in monetary policy. In many simulations, agents thus\nthink that both monetary and fiscal policy are active, leading them to believe that the\nequilibrium is unstable. In this scenario, we see larger differences in (cumulated) GDP\nand debt between the learning economy and the standard approach to modeling policy\nchanges.\nEven though our model abstracts from many issues that are important in the current\neconomic situation, this experiment still reproduces the broad patterns of low and stable\ninflation and substantial persistent movements in debt. If we were to model a fiscal stim-\nulus along the lines of Drautzburg and Uhlig (2011), Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland\n(2010) or Hollmayr and Matthes (2013), we would see a larger initial jump in debt. The\nlearning problem that agents face in this scenario is hard because inflation does not move\nenough to identify the changes in monetary policy. Incorporating the zero-lower bound\non nominal interest rates would only make this identification issue harder. The issues we\nhighlight here therefore seem very much relevant for the current economic environment.\nTo check whether or not our results hinge on the specific signal-to-noise structure\ninherent in our calibration, we next turn to a calibration where we set the standard\ndeviation of the monetary policy error R\nt\nto half of the value in our benchmark calibration.\nThis will increase the information value of observations. Nonetheless, as can be seen in\nfigure 9, the nature of perceived equilibria is basically unchanged. Agents learn somewhat\nfaster that the true equilibrium is stable, but the difference from the standard calibration\nis not large. These similarities carry over to other equilibrium outcomes, which we omit\nhere for the sake of brevity. Thus, even with a substantially smaller noise term in the\npolicy rule, we still get the same results - inflation in this experiment just does not vary\nenough to make agents update their beliefs faster.22\nsimulations is not misleading.\n22In the appendix we show that only once we almost let the noise term vanish we do get much faster\nlearning. In that case the standard deviation of the noise term in the monetary policy equation is 1/20th\nof our benchmark number. Even with such a small noise term learning is not immediate, though.\nEigenvalues\nPeriods of Explosiveness\nScatter Plot\nFigure 5: Persistence in the second experiment\nOutcomes Debt\nFigure 6: Inflation and debt sample paths in the second experiment\nCum.

We show that removing immediate knowledge of post-policy change\npolicy rules from agents can alter the nature of the perceived equilibrium. We show that\npersistent, random walk-like behavior naturally occurs when agents have to learn about\npolicy changes and that the resulting equilibrium dynamics can make learning the true\npolicy rule coefficients difficult. It is important to remember that the agents in our models\nare sophisticated econometricians - the properties of observed data in equilibrium make\nlearning hard, not the use of unsophisticated econometric techniques.\nReferences\nAndolfatto, D. and P.
