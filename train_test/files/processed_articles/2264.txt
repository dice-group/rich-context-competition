This study examines the associations of better\nneighborhood context with neighborhood housing values.\nMethods: We use the third wave of Add Health (2000-2001) to estimate the association of neighborhood contextual\nvariables and housing values first across then within income types. This is a census block group-level analysis.\nResults: We find that neighborhood context, especially access to fruit and vegetable outlets, is capitalized into, or\nassociated with, higher housing values. Fast food and convenience store access are associated with lower housing\nvalues. Capitalization differs by income quartile of the neighborhood. Even those in the poorest neighborhoods value\naccess to fresh fruits and vegetables, and those in the wealthier neighborhoods value activity resources. All\nneighborhood incomes types place negative value on fast food access and convenience store access.\nConclusions: Access to health-related contextual attributes is capitalized into higher housing prices. Access to fresh\nfruits and vegetables is valued in neighborhoods of all income levels. Modeling these associations by neighborhood\nincome levels helps explain the mixed results in the literature on the built environment in terms of linking health\noutcomes to access.\nBackground\nNeighborhood context, defined as the physical and social\nattributes of a neighborhood, is correlated with health [1].\nFor instance, better relative access to healthy food and\nphysical activity (PA) resources within a neighborhood\nis associated with lower body weight at the individual\nlevel. This is likely because better access lowers the time\nrequired to access healthy food and PA [2-6]. However\nin most neighborhood context studies, the association\nbetween health effects and context are estimated assum-\ning that locational decisions by individuals are random,\nwhich leads to bias [7,8]. An important and helpful theory\nfrom urban economics has been ignored in this literature:\nthe possibility that the health benefits of local access to\nhealthy food/PA, and of better neighborhoods generally,\nmay be capitalized into, or included in, higher hous-\ning values. Likewise, proximity to health-compromising\n*Correspondence: h.shelton.brown@uth.tmc.edu\n1UTHealth School of Public Health, Austin Regional Campus Michael & Susan\nDell Center for Healthy Living, Austin, TX, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nfeatures, such as fast food outlets, may be negatively\ncapitalized, or discounted in terms of housing values\nor rent.\nCapitalization can be thought of as evidence of pref-\nerence, at the aggregate level, for a given neighborhood\nand its attributes as compared to alternative neighbor-\nhoods. Housing price models are bid models. For instance,\nif a neighborhood acquires an attribute, like a redevel-\noped waterfront, its increased desirability will encourage\nhigher bids for the homes in that neighborhood, leading to\nhigher costs for buyers to live there. With capitalization,\n`premiums,' or the portion of the housing price which is\nattributable to that locational feature, may be required for\naccess. Homes can also be `discounted' (receive a negative\npremium) for features negatively related to health, indicat-\ning underlying preferences for health by those willing to\npay for access.\nIt is acknowledged that income and health are highly\ncorrelated [1]. The paradox is that if access to \"better\"\nneighborhood contextual factors is capitalized, income,\nnet of housing costs, will be reduced, which might lower\n\u00a9 2013 Brown and Yarnell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Therefore, the overall effects of con-\ntextual factors on health is ambiguous. Further, if neigh-\nborhood contextual factors are shown to be capitalized,\nthis demonstrates the extent to which locational decisions\nare not random. Neither issue has been given sufficient\nattention in the contextual factor literature.\nTwo economic theories suggest that housing markets\ncapitalize the benefits of neighborhood features. First, von\nTh\u00fcnen theorized in the early 19th century that land val-\nues are a function of the local area's attributes, particularly,\naccess to the center of the city, rather than the intrinsic\nvalue of the property in isolation [9]. Second, the Tiebout\nmodel of the 1950's asserted that people sort themselves\namong localities in order to find their utility-maximizing\nmix of government services, many of which affect health,\nand local taxes [10]. Thus, people with similar tastes and\nsimilar norms, including `like-mindedness' over health\nissues, are likely to sort together.\nEmpirically, `hedonic' price models have been used to\nestimate the level of capitalization of local attributes and\namenities. For example, if two identical houses on two\nidentical lots in different areas of town are priced differ-\nently, differential local contextual factors, like schools or\ncrime level, may explain the difference in price or capital-\nization. Hedonic models have been used to estimate the\ncapitalization of better local schools [11], of relative crime\navoidance [12], and of relative environmental advantages\nsuch as clean air [13]. However, studies of capitalization in\nthe neighborhood context literature do not exist.\nWe address this gap in the literature by estimating\nthe association of neighborhood contextual variables\u00ad\nparticularly, health-related neighborhood contextual\nvariables\u00adand housing values, using the third wave of\ndata from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nour hedonic regressions of housing values by income\nquartile, we demonstrate that health-related attributes\nsuch as supermarket density are capitalized.\nNeighborhood context and health\nHealth-related neighborhood attributes have received\nparticular attention in sociological and economic litera-\nture as correlates of health, yet, as mentioned, have not\nbeen investigated explicitly in models of housing capi-\ntalization. For instance, access to healthy food has been\nlinked to better diets and lower obesity rates. There is\nextensive literature documenting that poorer and ethnic\nminority neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets per\nhousehold [14-23]. Supermarkets often provide higher\nquality food products and offer lower food prices than\nother food outlets [22,24]. Increased availability of chain\nsupermarkets is significantly associated with lower ado-\nlescent BMI and overweight, while greater availability of\nconvenience stores is significantly associated with higher\nadolescent BMI and overweight [23]. According to Powell\net al. (2007), the link between supermarket availability and\nweight is often indirect, with studies often simply demon-\nstrating that availability is associated with consumption\n[25], or that availability is associated with diet quality [26].\nThere is also extensive literature documenting that par-\nticular physical environments are positively associated\nwith PA levels [4-6]. Neighborhoods with higher income\nand lower poverty have more of certain PA outlets, includ-\ning parks and bike path lanes (though not more public\npools or beaches) [27]. Lower income individuals are more\nlikely to perceive limitations to PA in their neighborhoods,\nincluding safety, gangs, traffic, and affordability [27,28].\nRegular PA, in turn, is associated with reduced obesity\nThe bid model\nThe von Th\u00fcnen bid model can be illustrated as follows.\nSuppose everyone living in the urban space must travel\ndowntown for work. Commute times vary by location of\nresidence, and people place different values on time, and\nthat value is correlated with wages. Suppose that a person\nvalues time at $10 an hour, and would save 20 hours per\nmonth commuting downtown for work by moving from\nhis current location to location X. What would he bid for\nmore than his current location. This may be enough to\ndisplace the person currently at location X, who may place\na lower value on time. Alternatively, the person at location\nX may match the higher bid. According to the bid model,\npeople bid and sort until an equilibrium emerges, where\nno one is induced to outbid people at other locations.\nNote that not everyone must move for the equilibrium to\nemerge.\nAll else equal, land rents or prices tend to increase\ntowards the center of the city because of lowered com-\nmute time costs.1 This equilibrium pattern of rental and\nland prices is called a rental gradient. Rental gradients\ncan also shift up or down because of characteristics other\nthan time needed to travel to a nearby location. These\ninclude local area crime, pollution, school quality, etc. For\ninstance, if crime avoidance is valued by the potential\nmover in the previous paragraph, he would bid less than\n$200 if location X has higher crime than his current loca-\ntion. If crime is lower at location X, he would bid more\nthan $200. Note that the process of valuation is subjec-\ntive, such as with the perceived threat of crime. Note also\nthat rents and prices for homes are highly correlated, spa-\ntially; there are few places with high housing rents and low\nhousing prices.\nNote that income limits the ability to bid, regardless of\npreference for a local attribute. For instance, low-income\npeople may highly value education for their children, but\nnot be able to afford to live in areas with the very best\nBrown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 3 of 11\nschools. However, qualities such as crime level and school\nquality are reflected by a range of levels, rather than in\nbinary variables. Therefore, low-income families may be\nwilling, and able, to pay more to live in a location with\naverage schools rather than living in an area with worse\nschools.\nIn this paper, we apply von Th\u00fcnen's bid model by test-\ning whether access to local food and PA amenities that are\npositively related to health are shown to be valued pos-\nitively in terms of housing prices, i.e., whether they are\nassociated with an upward shift in the gradient, and by\nhow much; and whether amenities negatively related to\nhealth are valued negatively in terms of housing prices.\nBecause poorer people are likely to be outbid for access to\nlocations with the absolute best access to healthy food and\nPA amenities, we stratify our analysis by income level of\nthe neighborhood.\nMethods\nData\nOur data are from the third wave of data from the Add\nHealth data set, a longitudinal study based on a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adolescents in the United States,\nwe utilize data from Wave III of Add Health, in which\na majority (73.13%) of the original Wave I respondents\nwhen these participants were between 18 and 26 years old\n[30]. We would have liked to have taken advantage of the\nfull panel of Add Health data. However, our capitalization\nand neighborhood context measures were only available\nat Wave III.\nWe chose the Add Health data set for this analysis\nfor several reasons. Most important, the neighborhood\namenities in the Add Health data are counted with respect\nto a distance, either straight line or street network, from\nan individual's residence, at one of four levels: block\ngroup, tract, county, or state. We chose the block group\nlevel (keeping only one observation, randomly chosen, per\nblock group); and used the street network distance, based\non an 8 kilometer search, for the counts. A block group is\ndefined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census as a \"subdivision\nof a census tract . . . [and] the smallest geographic unit for\nwhich the census bureau tabulates sample data. A block\ngroup consists of all the blocks within a census tract with\nthe same beginning number\" [31]. Block groups average\nU.S. Census data also counts amenities such as super-\nmarkets and fast food outlets at the block group level.\nHowever, it does not base its counts on street network\ndistances from each individual's residence, but rather\npresents counts in summative fashion for the block group\nas a whole, regardless of the location of individual's res-\nidences within that block group. Hence, the Add Health\ndata, while used here at the neighborhood level only, is\ninherently individual-focused. Measuring counts based on\ntravelable streets ties in directly with the von Th\u00fcnen bid\nmodel, reflecting the time and effort a resident would\npractically spend to reach the desired neighborhood\namenity, such as a supermarket. In analyzing neighbor-\nhoods or block groups rather than persons, we specified\nschool ID as the primary sampling unit, and specified\nregion as the strata variable, as indicated in Add Health\nweighting instructions. We used Stata's subpopulation\nweighting techniques when estimating models separately\nby income quartile.\nWe also found that the Add Health data have good rep-\nresentativeness in terms of sampling. Add Health's con-\ntextual data sample included low-population, rural areas\nwith as few as 1900 persons per county at Wave III. For\ncomparison, the American Community Survey (a yearly\ncounterpart to the decennial U.S. Census) is less repre-\nsentative in terms of places represented in the data, being\nbased on a more restrictive standard of 20,000 or more\npersons in a given area [31]. Additionally, the Add Health\ndata contain health outcome variables that, in a next stage\nof this research, can be easily linked with the home values\nand neighborhood amenities, to determine the influence\nof these on health.\nFinally, we chose to analyze data from earlier in the\n2000s because this reflected a period just before the hous-\ning bubble, and then the subsequent housing crash [32].\nEither event could bias attempts to correlate attributes\nwith housing values.\nThe use of the data has been approved by the Commit-\ntee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University\nof Texas Health Science Center.\nMeasures\nDensity\nWe based population density on a Wave III contextual\ndata item marking persons per square kilometer at the\nblock group level. This variable should be correlated with\ndistance to the urban center, making it essential in deter-\nmining housing value in the von Th\u00fcnen sense [9].\nPer capita income\nWe based per capita income on a Wave III contextual data\nitem marking per capita income at the block group level.\nIn Tiebout models, similar people sort together [10], so\nwe would expect wealthier people to pay a premium to\nlive near other wealthy people. In addition to using this\nitem as a predictor of median housing value and rent, we\nalso used it to divide our sample into quartiles based on\nblock group per capita income. This was done using the\nPROC RANK procedure in SAS. Dummy variables cre-\nated from this procedure (named `first' for the poorest,\n`second', `third' and `fourth' for the wealthiest) were used\nBrown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 4 of 11\nas subpopulation markers for Stata's subpopulation com-\nmand, which allowed us to estimate models separately by\nincome quartile group.\nMedian year built for housing units\nWe based median year that housing units in each block\ngroup were built on a Wave III contextual data item rang-\nMedian home value\nWe based median home value on a Wave III contextual\ndata item marking median home value of owner-occupied\nhousing units at the block group level, based on Census\n2000 data. Medians were preferable because this value was\nmost representative of each block group, without undue\ninfluence by markedly higher or lower home values for\na small number of blocks in the group. Utilizing values\nfor owner-occupied homes excluded homes for which the\nowner would not be using its nearby amenities, such as\nrental units, vacation homes, or seasonal residences.\nIn the original Add Health data, 95% of the home values\nWe eliminated cases that fell into these lower and higher\ncategories due to their extremity and the crude group-\ning of these cases in the Add Health data. This provided\nus with a representative range of values without exces-\nsive extremes, and with relatively precise measurement.\nFinally, we divided these home values by 1,000 to yield a\nvariable with a scale that was reasonably matched with the\npredictors, allowing for interpretable beta weights.\nDensities of food and activity resources\nWe based Wave III densities of supermarkets, fast food\nchain outlets, cooperative natural/health food stores,\nconvenience stores, fruit/vegetable markets, and activity\noutlets on Wave III neighborhood resource data items\nmarking counts of these resources within eight-kilometer\nnetwork search units. Activity outlets included instruc-\ntional facilities, membership facilities, outdoor facilities,\npublic fee facilities, parks, public facilities (such as\nbeaches and pools), schools, YMCAs, and youth organi-\nzations (such as boy and girl scout organizations). These\nresources had been categorized by Add Health staff\naccording to Dun and Bradstreet's 2001 primary Stan-\ndard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and keyword\nsearches within the company name and trade style fields.\nWhile the Dun & Bradstreet data have had their accuracy\nquestioned, recent literature has shown that the predic-\ntive validity of the D&B food resource data is \"good\" and\ncomparable to competitor data such as from InfoUSA and\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control data\nTo convert counts into densities, we divided the counts\nby Census tract population (a tract being a small, relatively\nhomogeneous subdivision of a county, larger than a block\ngroup) [31]. To put the density values on a scale similar\nto other variables in our models, we then multiplied these\nTotal crime\nWe based total crime on a Wave III item giving an index\nof total crimes reported (as opposed to arrests made) per\nProportion college educated\nWe based proportion of persons with a college education\non a Wave III variable marking the proportion of persons\nat the block group level who are 25 years or older and have\na bachelor's degree or more. In Tiebout models, similar\npeople sort together [10], so, as with income, we would\nexpect college-educated people to pay a premium to live\nnear similar people.\nRegion\nBecause real estate varies by region, we included dummy\nvariables (1=yes, 0=no) for whether the block group was\nin the West, the Midwest or the South, with the Northeast\nas the omitted variable.\nActivity by crime interaction\nResearch has shown that in high-crime areas, parents are\nmore apprehensive about using parks and trails [35], and\nvalue access less because they are seen as hosting criminal\nactivity [12]. Prior to modeling, we also created a Crime by\nActivity Resource Density interaction term, having cen-\ntered the Total Crime and Activity Resource Density vari-\nables prior to cross-multiplication. The interaction term\nwas included in all specifications of our model, along with\nthe centered versions of the component terms.\nAnalysis\nOur initial sample consisted of 7,870 unique block groups.\nPrior to analysis, we performed natural log transforma-\ntions on the population density, activity density, and five\nfood outlet density variables in order to account for\nthe highly skewed nature of these variables. After these\ntransformations, all variables showed reasonable skew\nstatistics.\nNext, we checked our data for outliers on the variables\nto be used in our regression models. We applied a con-\nservative 6.0 standard deviation cutoff for the removal of\noutliers from our sample. Removal of cases with absolute\nvalues of greater than 6.0 standard deviations from the\nmean on one of more predictors reduced the sample to\nN = 7,845, and removal of additional cases with extreme\nvalues for home prices reduced the sample to its final size\nBrown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 5 of 11\nOur hedonic price model is of the form\nYb\n= XHbb\n+ XNb + ub, (1)\nwhere Yb is the housing value for census block b, XHb are\nhealth-related attributes of that location, including access\nto food, etc., XNb are non-health-related attributes of that\nlocation, including access to the center of the city (density)\nand age of the housing stock. Finally, ub is the error term.\nWe estimated this model first across all block groups,\nthen separately by income quartile. As noted, we included\nMedian Income as a predictor in the model even when\nrunning models separately by income quartile. Our rea-\nsoning is that even among income quartiles, there is still\nsignificant variation on the Median Income variable. We\nalso ran models both with and without the natural/health\nfood and fruit/vegetable market density variables, rea-\nsoning that these variables could be collinear with the\nsupermarket density variable.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the means and proportions employed in our\nanalysis.\nTable 2 shows the results for the hedonic regression\nmodel for housing values estimated across all income\nquartiles. As expected, block group level income is cor-\nrelated with housing price, as is percentage of adults\naged 25 and older and with college education. This is in\naccordance with predictions of the Tiebout model, where\nwealthier people pay a premium to sort together.2 This\nwould as be predicted if there is a premium for prestige in\na neighborhood, or hard to observe benefits that accrue\nfrom living near wealthier, educated people. All else equal,\nhousing costs more in the West and less in the South and\nMidwest. Also as expected, the crime rate is negatively\nassociated with housing value, and block group level den-\nsity is positively related to housing value. As mentioned\nearlier, population density is a proxy measure for distance\nto the center of the urban space in the von Th\u00fcnen sense\n[9]. The greater the density, the greater the housing price\nbecause, typically, this is closer to the central city relative\nto less dense areas, thus affording greater access.\nIn terms of health-related neighborhood contextual fac-\ntors, most of the signs are as expected. Estimates for\nfruit/vegetable market density (positive), fast food den-\nsity (negative), and convenience store density (negative)\nare significantly different from zero. Thus, neighborhood\ncontextual factors are capitalized. Elasticities are useful\nin interpreting these coefficient estimates, particularly\nwhen both the dependent and independent variables are\ncontinuous. Elasticities measure the percentage change\nin the dependent variable associated with a percentage\nchange in an independent variable.

Our analysis reveals\nthat physical attributes related to health are capital-\nized into higher housing values, i.e., it costs more to\nlive in those areas. Because the hedonic price model is\nessentially a bid model, capitalization can be thought of\nas evidence of preference, at the aggregate level, for a\ngiven neighborhood and its attributes versus alternative\nneighborhoods.\nWe found that access to fruit and vegetable stores\nare highly capitalized. For instance, a 10 percent rise in\nthe density of fruit and vegetable stores, which could\nbe one store opening, is associated with $2,907 higher\nconsistent across neighborhoods with different income\nlevels. Supermarket access was capitalized when vari-\nables for the densities of fruit and vegetable and natural\nfood stores were excluded. However, fruit and vegetable\nstore access always dominated supermarket access over-\nall and across neighborhoods with different income\nlevels.\nIn some cases, attributes which are detrimental to health\nare negatively capitalized, meaning housing values are dis-\ncounted in those areas. In our study, people valued the\navoidance of convenience stores and fast food chains. We\nfound that a 10 percent rise in the density of fast food\nWe also found that capitalization varied by neigh-\nborhood income levels. Wealthier neighborhoods pay a\nhigher premium for access to PA resources. Among neigh-\nborhoods in the 4th quartile, housing values are $1,635\ndensity increases by 10 percent. Although people valued\nPA resources overall, activity resources are not consis-\ntently valued, especially among those with lower income.\nThis implies that projects to improve access to parks and\ntrails in a poor area may lead to wealthier people bidding\nup the value of nearby houses and apartments.\nAll neighborhood types paid a premium to avoid fast\nfood, but the distaste premium increased by neighbor-\nhood income level. A 10 percent increase in access to fast\nin lower housing values among neighborhoods in the 4th\nincome quartile. The distaste premium for convenience\nstore access also increased by neighborhood income level.\nOur results suggest that differential spatial access to\nhealth-related amenities is associated with capitaliza-\ntion. Capitalization has equity concerns in a bid model\nbecause wealthier persons will inevitably be able to outbid\nlower income people. Policies should encourage ubiqui-\ntous access to healthy food and PA opportunities, because\nwithout differential access, capitalization will not occur.\nSome policies exist to spread access, such as enterprise\nzones offering advantageous tax policies for supermar-\nkets. Our results show that access to small fruit and\nvegetable markets are more valued than supermarkets, so\nsubsidies to convenience stores, which themselves have\nnegative valuation, to sell healthier foods would help\nequalize access. In terms of PA, smaller parks in several\nlocations would be preferred to a single large park (or a\nfew large parks). This is because access to a single large\npark is easier to capitalize.\nWhile capitalization has equity concerns, our results\noffer a heretofore unavailed of method to reveal the value\npersons place on access to health-related amenities. The\npreference for access, particularly access for healthy food,\nextends to neighborhoods of all income levels.\nOur hope is that in future research efforts, we will be\nable to use capitalization to control for selection, revealing\nthe true health effects of the built environment.\nLimitations\nOne critical caveat to our findings is that they are rela-\ntional, but not necessarily causal. For instance, an increase\nin the health-related amenities near a location can result\nin increased prices because the amenities make the loca-\ntion of the property more valuable. Even announced or\nprospective changes in an area's amenities can affect hous-\ning pricing far before these additional amenities exist.\nFor example, houses in a neighborhood may increase in\nvalue at the announcement of potential plans for build-\ning a neighborhood park, since this reflects the interest\nof developers in the area's growth and improvement. Both\nare examples of increased amenities, actual or planned,\ndriving housing prices.\nHowever, directionality may also work in the opposite\ndirection. For instance, in the scenario of owned condo-\nminiums or gated communities, the building of a new\nwalking or exercise area may depend on whether there\nhas been an increase in the buying value of these homes.\nThe additional income generated by the upscaled prices\nmay be part of a development plan for the condominium\nor gated community to improve the value of the group\nof homes, which will in turn, increase prices even fur-\nther. Thus, it is likely that in some scenarios, amenities\nand prices affect each other reciprocally. Our data were\nfrom a single wave, but future research considering multi-\nple waves of data on amenities and home prices may help\ndistinguish directions of causality.\nAdditionally, our data reflect a particular historical\nperiod in the U.S. housing market, the early 2000s, which\nwe chose because of the relative absence of bubbles and\nConclusions\nIn this study, we addressed a gap in the literature by link-\ning research on the contextual factors that facilitate or\nimpede a healthy lifestyle with the hedonic price frame-\nwork, allowing us to estimate the degree to which these\nfactors are capitalized into housing prices. Although the\nnon-randomness of location is generally acknowledged in\nthe health economics literature, our results highlight the\nextent and magnitude of the non-randomness. Our results\nshow that, even among people in the lowest income quar-\ntile, access to better food comes at a premium. It is\nacknowledged that income and health are highly corre-\nlated, and our results show that the health benefits of\nbetter access to food among the poor comes at the cost\nof reduced income, net of housing costs. This perhaps\nexplains the mixed results in the literature.\nEndnotes\n1Note, however, that there can also be high-income\nneighborhoods away from the city, since some prefer to\nbuild larger houses on several acres. However, buying the\nsame house on the same number of acres, holding crime,\nschools, etc., constant, closer to the center of the city\nwould cost more. For example, Victorian homes in\nManhattan were eventually sold due to the increasing\nimportance of New York City.\n2Note that the Tiebout model is more concerned with\nefficient taxation than capitalization [10].\nCompeting interests\nBoth authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nHSB conceived of the study and analytic methods, and participated in\nreviewing results. LMY carried out the analyses and conceived of adjustments\nto models. Both authors contributed to the writing of this manuscript, and\napprove the final manuscript.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living and the Michael\n& Susan Dell Foundation for assistance in acquiring the Add Health data.
