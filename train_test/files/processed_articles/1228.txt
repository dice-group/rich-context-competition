The purpose is to test\nthe hypothesis stated above.\nDESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort studies. The mortality follow-up of the first and second National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys (NHANES I and NHANES II).\nSUBJECTS: A total of 10 169 male subjects aged 25 \u00ad 75 who participated in NHANES I and II were selected for analyses. Follow-\nup continued until 1992. The mean follow-up time was 14.6 y for NHANES I and 12.9 y for NHANES II. Ninety-eight percent of\nthe participants were successfully followed representing a total of 3722 deaths.\nMEASUREMENTS: Subscapular and triceps skinfolds thickness were used as FM indicators, whereas upper arm circumference\nwas used as a FFM indicator. The Cox proportional hazards model tested the relationships of BMI, FM and FFM with all-cause\nmortality adjusting for age, smoking status, race and education levels.\nRESULTS: BMI had a U-shaped relationship with mortality, with a nadir of approximately 27 kg=m2. However, when indicators of\nFM and FFM were added to the model, the relationship between BMI and mortality became more nearly monotonic increasing.\nMoreover, the relationship between FM indicator and mortality was monotonic increasing and the relationship between FFM\nindicator and mortality was monotonic decreasing.\nCONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that the apparently deleterious effects of marked thinness may be due to\nlow FFM and that, over the observed range of the data, marked leanness (as opposed to thinness) has beneficial effects.\nKeywords: BMI; adiposity; all-cause mortality; longitudinal cohort study\nIntroduction\nIt is well established that obesity is associated with increased\nmortality rate.1 However, the cause of the frequently\nobserved U- or J-shaped relationship between body mass\nindex (BMI) and mortality rate remains poorly understood.2\nIt has been contended that the elevated mortality rate\nwith low BMI is due to confounding by smoking and pre-\nexisting disease.3 While some studies support this hypoth-\nesis,4,5 most studies continue to find a U- or J-shaped curve\nbetween BMI and mortality rate even after attempting to\ncontrol for smoking and pre-existing subclinical or occult\ndisease.1,6 This puzzling finding seems inconsistent with the\nclinical observation that weight loss improves (short-term)\n*Correspondence: DB Allison, Department of Biostatistics, Ryals Public\nE-mail: Dallison@uab.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nhealth7 and experimental data that laboratory animals sub-\njected to marked caloric restriction live substantially longer\nthan animals fed ad libitum.8 Allison et al9 proposed an\nadditional explanation for the elevated mortality seen with\nlow BMI. Specifically, BMI was noted to be the summation of\nfat mass (FM)=meters2 and fat-free mass (FFM)=meters2. To\nthe extent that FM and FFM have opposite effects on mor-\ntality, simulation studies demonstrated that a U- or J-shaped\nrelationship between BMI and mortality rate could occur.9\nWith low BMIs, this might be due to elevated mortality due\nto insufficient FFM.\nSeveral studies offer limited information about the poten-\ntial validity of the hypothesis10 \u00ad 12 and have generally sup-\nported the expectation that measures of adiposity have a\nmore nearly monotonic increasing relationship with mortal-\nity rate than do measures of total body mass or BMI. How-\never, these studies were limited in sample size, body\ncomposition measurements (often relying on poorly vali-\ndated measures), and the thoroughness of the statistical\nanalysis (eg not assessing conditional effects, using inap-\npropriate tests etc).\nThree additional studies have addressed the relationship\nbetween adiposity per se, BMI and mortality rate.13 \u00ad 15 Lee\net al16 examined associations of FM, FFM and fitness with all-\nin an observational study. Unfortunately, Blair et al13 did not\nassess the conditional effects of FM and FFM or of FM and BMI\nand therefore did not eliminate the confounding among\nthese measures that may have existed due to their close\ncorrelation. Kalmijn et al14 examined the independent asso-\nciations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio and skinfold thickness\nwith all-cause mortality rate among 3741 elderly Japanese-\nAmerican men. Following subjects for a mean of 4.5 y,\ninvestigators found inverse and direct associations of BMI\nand waist-to-hip ratio, respectively, with mortality rate.\nWhereas increasing BMI was associated with reduced mortal-\nity rate, increasing waist-to-hip ratio was associated with\nincreased mortality rate. Heitmann et al15 studied 22 y mor-\ntality as a function of BMI and body fat among 787 Swedish\nmen followed from age 60 to 82 with body composition\nassessed by total body potassium counting. Results were\nconsistent with those hypothesized by Allison et al.9 Speci-\nfically, there was a U-shaped relationship between BMI and\nmortality rate, a monotonic increasing relationship between\nadiposity and mortality rate, and a monotonic decreasing\nrelationship between FFM and mortality rate. This study\nstrongly supports the hypotheses that the U-shaped relation-\nship between BMI and mortality rate may be due to the fact\nthat BMI is a composite of FM and FFM. However, its\nrelatively small sample size and the advanced age (60 \u00ad\n82 y) of the subjects suggest the importance of additional\nstudies in larger samples of the broader population.\nTo address this, we used data from the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) I and II,\nwhich consist of representative samples of the US civilian\nnon-institutionalized population. In each survey, height,\nweight, subscapular and triceps skinfolds were measured\nand mortality data collected. Collectively, these data sets\nyield over 10 000 adult male subjects, making this the largest\nstudy to date to address the differential effects of adiposity\nand BMI on mortality rate and the first to do so in a\nnationally representative sample. We will report on women\nin a separate paper given the substantial sex differences in\nMethods\nStudy sample\nSubjects were from two sources: the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I), and the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II\n(NHANES II).

Details\nabout these two surveys are well described elsewhere.20 \u00ad 23\nIn the present study we restricted analyses to male subjects\nfollow-up was conducted and all-cause mortality data were\ncompiled in 1992 for both NHANES I and II, which consisted\nSurvival time from baseline to date of death was calculated.\nRight-sided censoring was used for the 170 subjects lost to\nfollow-up.\nMeasures\nThe surveys covered many aspects relevant to health, nutri-\ntion and living conditions as well as anthropometrics. The\nfollowing covariates were selected for analyses in this study:\nbaseline age, height, weight, triceps and subscapular skin-\nfolds, arm circumference, smoking status, vital status, race\nand education level. Height, weight and anthropometric\nmeasurements using a standardized protocol were performed\nin both NHANES I and NHANES II.22,23 The smoking variable\nwas defined as current, unknown and never smokers. Race\nwas categorized as white, black and other. Education level\nwas divided into three categories, ie attaining less than 8 y of\neducation, 8 \u00ad 12 y, and more than 12 y. BMI was calculated\nas kg=m2. The operational definition of fat mass indicator\n(FMI) is the sum of the Z-score of triceps skinfolds thickness\nand the Z-score of subscapular skinfolds thickness. Z-score\nwas defined as a deviation from the sample mean value in\nsample standard deviation units. The upper arm circumfer-\nence was used as a fat-free mass indicator (FFMI). Although\nthe upper arm circumference includes muscle, bone and\nadipose tissue, ie it is a composite of FM and FFM, in the\npresence of FM indicators in the same model, ie conditional\non FM indicators, upper arm circumference should become\nAdiposity, BMI and mortality\nDB Allison et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nlargely representative of fat-free arm tissue. The choice of the\nprediction variables depends on the hypotheses to be tested.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used Cox proportional hazards model for the survival\nanalysis.

These\ncovariates were added to the main models below to assess\nthe sensitivity of the results.\nIn terms of modeling we considered four main models --\nmodels 1, 2, 3 and 4. In model 1, the prediction variables\nwere BMI and BMI2 to test for the U-shaped relationships\nbetween BMI and all-cause mortality that have been pre-\nviously observed. In model 2, the prediction variables were\nBMI, BMI2 and FFMI. This model was to test the hypotheses\nof decreasing (ie protective) effect of FFMI on all-cause\nmortality rate in the presence of BMI and BMI2. Model 3\ntested the hypotheses of increasing (ie harmful) effect of FMI\nand decreasing (ie protective) effect of FFMI on all-cause\nmortality rate conditional on a given BMI. Model 4 tested\nthe shape of the relationship between FMI and all-cause\nmortality by adding FMI2 into model 3. Sensitivity analyses\nwere followed by adding the `sensitivity covariates' above in\nfour models.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nThe baseline characteristics of subjects who participated in\nNHANES I and II are shown in Table 1. There was a statisti-\ncally significant difference in age between the two cohorts.\nWeight, BMI, subscapular and triceps skinfolds were greater\nfor participants in NHANES II compared to NHANES I;\nhowever there was no statistically significant difference in\nheight or arm circumference. There were also statistically\nsignificant differences in mean survival time, smoking status,\nvital status (including number of all-cause deaths), race and\neducational levels between NHANES I and II.\nThe correlations among BMI, FMI and FFMI are shown in\nTable 2. The correlation coefficient was highest between BMI\nand FFMI and lowest between FMI and FFMI.\nPrimary analyses\nTable 3 shows the hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality\nfor each of the four Cox proportional models performed. In\nmodel 1, there was a significant U-shaped relationship\nbetween BMI and all-cause mortality after adjusting for\nage, smoking status and cohort, but without adjusting for\nFMI and FFMI. The estimated nadir of the BMI curve was\n27.3 kg=m2. After adding FFMI into the model (model 2), the\nU-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of male participants of NHANES I\nn Mean (s.d.) n Mean (s.d.)\nArm circumference,\nright (cm)\nn % n %\nand NHANES II by t-test. {P < 0.001, statistical comparison between NHANES I\nand NHANES II by w2 test.\nTable 2 Correlation among BMIa, FMIb and FFMIc\nVariables FMI FFMI\naBMI, body mass index (kg=m2). bFMI, fat mass indicator, sum of triceps Z-\nscore and subscapular Z-score. cFFMI, fat-free mass indicator, right upper arm\ncircumference (cm). dPearson correlation coefficient. *P < 0.001.\nAdiposity, BMI and mortality\nDB Allison et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nremained significant, but the nadir of BMI was reduced to\nNHANES I and II combined.

Moreover, the relationship between FMI2 and all-\ncause mortality rate was not significant (HR \u00bc 0.999, 95% CI\nincreasing relationship between FMI and all-cause mortality\nrate. Current smokers showed a significantly higher rate of\nall-cause mortality when compared to non-smokers in all\nfour models.\nSensitivity analyses\nAs shown in Table 4, after adding race and education levels\nto the models, the relationships of BMI, BMI2, FMI, FMI2,\nFFMI, age, smoking status and cohort with all-cause mortal-\nity rate did not change.\nWhen we omitted subjects those with unknown smoking\nstatus, the results were virtually unchanged compared with\nthose using all subjects (data not shown).\nWe also evaluated the potential effect of multicollinearity\nbetween BMI, FMI and FFMI on our results. Standard diag-\nnostic tests did reveal modest multicollinearity. Although\nthis might have yielded larger standard errors, the parameter\nestimates remain unbiased. Furthermore, given that the key\nestimates were generally statistically significant, the multi-\ncollinearity did not seem to eliminate our ability to draw\nreasonably confident conclusions from our results. This was\nconfirmed with sensitivity analysis where two orthogonal\nTable 3 Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, male subjects aged 25 \u00ad 75, NHANES I and NHANES II combined\nb (s.e.)a HRb b (s.e.)

HRs for both FFMI and FMI are based on\nAdiposity, BMI and mortality\nDB Allison et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nprincipal component scores representing `FM' and `FFM'\nwere added to the Cox models. These models yielded similar\nresults: all-cause mortality decreased with FFMI and\nincreased with FMI, suggesting multicollinearity contributed\nnegligibly to these analyses.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we observed that the relationship between BMI\nand all-cause mortality was U-shaped with the nadir of BMI\nbeing approximately 27 kg=m2. However, after adjusting for\nFFMI alone or together with FMI, the nadir decreased to 19.5\nand 20.5 kg=m2, respectively. Moreover, unlike BMI, FMI\ntended to be monotonically increasing with respect to mor-\ntality rate, whereas the association between all-cause mor-\ntality rate and FFMI was monotonically decreasing. These\nresults are consistent with other studies,9 which have\nhypothesized that the consistently demonstrated U-shaped\nrelationship between BMI and all-cause mortality may be the\nresult of the inverse independent effect of FMI and FFMI on\nmortality. We have shown in these analyses using crude,\nsurrogate indicators of FM and FFM that this hypothesis may\nbe valid. Whether FM and FFM can be more precisely\nparceled out of BMI using more accurate and precise mea-\nsurements of adiposity such as dual-energy X-ray absorptio-\nmetry (DEXA) or magnetic resonance requires further\ninvestigation. It should be noted that this study did not\nmeasure changes in FM and FFM indicators in relation to\nmortality, which addresses a different question. There is\nreason to suspect that changes in these respective indicators\nmay have different associations with mortality. An analysis\nof the Tecumseh Community Health Study and Framingham\nHeart Study concluded that weight loss is associated with\nincreased mortality rate and fat loss is associated with\ndecreased mortality rate.27\nThe strengths of this present study are several-fold. Pool-\ning these nationally representative samples enhances statis-\ntical power, the precision and external validity of the results.\nThe high-quality standardization of the anthropometric\nmeasurements in these cohorts also minimizes measurement\nerror and potential biases. Additionally, the simultaneous\nuse of indicators of FM and FFM in the survival models\nallows for the potential assessment of each effect indepen-\ndent of the other.\nGiven the mean differences that exist between the two\ncohorts utilized in terms of baseline body mass indicators, it\nis reasonable to inquire how this might have affected results.\nSignificant differences (in means) of variables between the\ntwo cohorts will not affect the estimated effects of the\nindependent variables when data from the two cohorts are\npooled together, if a term for cohort is included in the model\nas we did and there is no interaction between cohort and the\nindependent variables. Although not reported in detail,\nthose interactions were tested and found not to be statisti-\ncally significant. Therefore, for this particular study, the\nsignificant differences in means do not seem to influence\nTable 4 Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality additionally adjusted for race and education levels, male subjects aged 25 \u00ad 75, NHANES I and NHANES II\ncombined\nb (s.e.)a HRb b (s.e.)

Therefore, pooling these two nationally repre-\nsentative samples seems well justified.\nThe present study demonstrated a differential association\nof BMI and adiposity with all-cause mortality rate. These\nresults, in conjunction with recent reports,13 \u00ad 15 should sti-\nmulate use of more rigorous body composition measure-\nments in epidemiologic studies. Additionally, and perhaps\nmost importantly, these studies may have implications for\nthe development of clinical and public health guidelines\npertaining to the weight and body composition associated\nwith optimal health.28\nThe results of this study, however, should be interpreted\ntaking into account several study limitations. Although the\ninclusion of skinfold measurements expands the underlying\nrole of BMI on all-cause mortality, estimates of FM using\nthese measurements are not optimal.29 Newer methods such\nas DEXA, for example, provide more accurate estimates of\ntotal body fat29,30 and would be preferable. However, these\nmethods are relatively expensive and may be difficult to use\nin large-scale epidemiologic research. Until such studies are\navailable, the anthropometric measurements may offer safe,\ninexpensive and practical proxies of subcutaneous fat.31\nThis study did not have measurements of regional adip-\nosity. Waist circumference, for example, as a measure of\nvisceral adiposity, has been shown to be more strongly\nassociated with obesity-related comorbidities and mortality\nrate than subcutaneous adiposity.32,33 Additionally, intra-\nabdominal FM measured by magnetic resonance or com-\nputed tomography imaging techniques may more accurately\nmeasure visceral FM.34\nSince this was an observational study, causal pathways\nunderlying the observed associations cannot be inferred with\nconfidence. We cannot rule out the possibility, for example,\nthat underlying wasting disease partially accounted for the\nrelationship between FFM and mortality rate. We believe our\nfindings here are provocative and future studies should\nreplicate these finding using more accurate body composi-\ntion measurements. Future studies using NHANES III and IV\ndata are expected to provide more precise answers to the\nresearch questions posed herein. NHANES III made use of\nbioimpedance analysis and, to our knowledge, NHANES IV\nwill make use of DEXA. Finally, despite the practical chal-\nlenges, studies making use of regional adiposity may yield\nnovel insights into true body composition \u00ad mortality\nrelationships.\n"
