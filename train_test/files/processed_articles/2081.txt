At the same time, there has been no improvement in diabetes-related complications\nas has been found in the general older population. These findings heighten the urgency for more\neffective public health interventions targeted to this population. As diabetes and obesity become\nmore prevalent in older adults, physicians should encourage appropriate management in older\npatients, including early detection and glycemic control.\nDiabetes is the seventh leading cause\nof death in the U.S., affecting 16.8\nprevalence of diabetes among individuals\naged 75 years is projected to increase\nattributed mainly to the aging of the pop-\nulation, an increase in obesity, and life-\nstyle changes (3\u00ad5). Simultaneously,\nthere has been a decrease in the preva-\nlence of several diabetes-related compli-\ncations as a result of advancements in\ndiabetes management (6).\nOlder Hispanics are a rapidly growing\nsegment of the U.S. population (7). Dur-\nnosed in 24.9% of older Mexican\nAmericans (aged 65 years) compared\nwith only 14.3% of non-Hispanic white\nadults of the same age (8). Mexican Amer-\nicans also have an increased risk and prev-\nalence of diabetes-related complications\nand a higher disability rate compared\nwith non-Hispanic whites (9,10). As\noverall life expectancy has increased,\nmany Mexican Americans are living\nlonger with more comorbidities including\ndiabetes (9). Although several studies\nhave examined the national trends of di-\nabetes over the previous decades, no stud-\nies have examined the trends in diabetes\nprevalence and diabetes-related compli-\ncations among older Mexican Americans.\nHence, the purpose of this study was to\nexpand on the current literature by exam-\nining the trends in diabetes prevalence\nand diabetes-related complications over\ncomparing two separate representative\nsamples from the Hispanic Established\nPopulation for the Epidemiologic Study\nof the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE), a com-\nmunity-based study of older Mexican\nAmericans (aged 65 years) residing in\nfive southwestern states.

Our study included\nsubjects both from the original cohort in\nThis process resulted in two independent\nsamples of Mexican Americans aged 75\nyears for analyses.\nMeasurement of diabetes\nRespondents were coded as having diabe-\nreported that they had been told by a doc-\ntor that they had diabetes, sugar in their\nurine, or high blood glucose or if they\nwere found to be taking hypoglycemic\ndrugs in an inspection of the medications\nthey had taken in the 2 weeks before the\ninterview.\nDiabetes-related complications\nDiabetes-related complications examined\nwere microvascular complications, in-\ncluding kidney disease and visual impair-\nment, and macrovascular complications,\nincluding circulatory disease and periph-\neral circulatory problems. Functional dis-\nability was also assessed. Kidney disease\nwas determined by the following ques-\ntion: \"As a result of your diabetes, have\nyou ever had any problems with your kid-\nneys?\" Visual impairment was deter-\nmined by the following question: \"As a\nresult of your diabetes, have you ever had\nany problems with your eyes?\" Peripheral\ncirculatory disease was determined by the\nfollowing question: \"As a result of your\ndiabetes, have you ever had any problems\nwith the circulation in your legs or arms?\"\nSubjects were determined to have cardio-\nvascular disease if they reported ever hav-\ning a heart attack or a stroke.\nFunctional disability was ascertained\nthrough several self-reported variables.\nLower-extremity function was measured\nby walking in a small room, walking a\nhalf-mile, walking up and down stairs,\nand transferring from bed to a chair.\nThese items were examined separately\nand also summed to form a dichotomous\nvariable indicating any lower-body dis-\nability. Also available was a measure of\nactivities of daily living (ADL), which as-\nsessed disability by asking the subjects if\nthey needed assistance with one or more\nof the following tasks: bathing, grooming,\ndressing, eating, transferring, or toileting.\nInstrumental activities of daily living\n(IADL) disability was assessed by asking\nthe respondents if they needed assistance\nwith one or more of the following tasks:\nusing a telephone, driving, shopping, pre-\nparing meals, doing light housework, tak-\ning medicine, or handling money. Both\nADL and IADL disability were dichoto-\nmized, indicating any ADL and IADL dis-\nability separately.\nDemographic and health-related\ncharacteristics\nOther covariates included in the analyses\nwere age, years of education, sex, obesity,\nhypertension, and number of physicians'\nvisits in the past year.

How-\never, the prevalence of having any lower-\nextremity disability did increase between\nthe two cohorts. In addition, self-reported\nADL disability also significantly increased\namong individuals with diabetes between\nthe two time periods.\nOur findings are consistent with pre-\nvious reports showing a national contin-\nuous upward trend in diabetes prevalence\nover the previous decade.

This improvement may not be appar-\nent in our study because of differences in\nstudy periods compared with other stud-\nies, the advanced age of our sample, and\nmeasures used.\nAlthough no prevalence data for dia-\nbetes-related kidney problems have been\nreported, findings from the U.S. Renal\nData System showed that incidence rate of\nend-stage renal disease (ESRD) among in-\ndividuals with diabetes aged 75 years\nhas increased significantly over the period\nimportant to consider that our estimates\nmeasure any kidney disease related to di-\nabetes, not ESRD specifically. The in-\ncrease shown in ESRD presented in\nprevious reports among those aged 75\nyears is again probably due to the in-\ncreased survival of individuals with dia-\nbetes. Moreover, it could also reflect a\nconcomitant increase in referral, admis-\nsion rates, and intervention rather than an\nactual increase in ESRD incidence (6).\nSimilar to the trends in microvascular\ncomplications, we did not find significant\nchanges in the prevalence of macrovascu-\nlar complications including cardiovascu-\nlar disease and peripheral circulatory\nproblems. These findings are similar to\nreports from the NHIS showing no signif-\nicant changes in the prevalence of any car-\ndiovascular disease among the general\npopulation aged 75 years over the pe-\ncrovascular conditions are not strongly\nrelated to hyperglycemia, improvement\nin diabetes management might not mod-\nify the prevalence of these conditions\namong individuals with diabetes (17).\nThe higher prevalence of diabetes re-\nported in this study might be partly due to\nchanges in the diagnostic criteria.

As we have shown above, the\nprevalence of obesity has increased dra-\nmatically in this older population since\nObesity is reported to be one of the most\nsignificant factors contributing to the de-\nvelopment of diabetes and is highly prev-\nalent in Hispanic populations (19).\nMexican Americans are living longer\nbut are living with more chronic condi-\ntions and more disability (9). Older adults\nwith diabetes are more likely to have\nfunctional disabilities and are more likely\nto use mobility aids compared with indi-\nviduals without diabetes (20). Conse-\nquently, more functional disability\namong individuals with diabetes could\nalso lead to an overall reduction in active\nlife expectancy.\nActive life expectancy is an important\nconsideration because the prevalence of\ndiabetes has dramatically increased\namong Mexican Americans aged 75\nyears. It has been found that individuals\nwith diabetes aged 75 years in the U.K.\nhave experienced a significant reduction\nin active life expectancy in recent years,\nwhere individuals without diabetes had\nan extra 2 years of life without disability\ncompared with individuals with diabetes\nof older adults aged 65 years showed\nthat those who do not have diabetes gain\nbetween 4 and 5 disability-free years of\nlife (22). Both diabetes and obesity con-\ntribute to a reduction in functional ability.\nOlder adults who are obese are more\nlikely to become disabled and, generally\nspeaking, older adults are also less likely\nto recover compared with younger obese\nindividuals (23). As Mexican Americans\nage, specific attention to the pathways\nleading to this increase in obesity such as\nthe reduction of adipose tissue in the ab-\ndominal area and dietary modifications\ncould reduce functional disability and in-\ncrease future active life expectancy.\nThere are several limitations to this\nstudy. The determination of a diabetes di-\nagnosis was based on a self-reported mea-\nsure and was not based on any clinical\nmeasure of fasting plasma glucose. In ad-\ndition, the presence of diabetes-related\ncomplications was also based on self-\nreport. However, these types of self-\nreported measures have been found to\nbe a valid and reliable method of deter-\nmining the presence of disease (24).\nNevertheless, underreporting may have\noccurred by not including those in whom\ndiabetes has not yet been diagnosed, but\nwho actually have the disease. In the U.S.,\nit is estimated that there are 2.4 million\nindividuals with undiagnosed diabetes.\nMoreover, many diagnoses are incidental\nand only occur when related complica-\ntions emerge. New onset of diabetes in\nolder individuals is not very common,\nmeaning that oftentimes diabetes goes\nundiagnosed while other complications\nIn summary, in light of the high preva-\nlence of diabetes in this group, no improve-\nment in diabetes-related complications\nheightens the urgency for public health\ninterventions. As diabetes is projected to\nbecome more prevalent in older adults in\nthe future (2), physicians need to be\ntrained in early detection of diabetes\namong older adults and should encourage\nappropriate management in patients aged\n75 years, including glycemic control\nand healthier lifestyles and adequate\npharmacological treatment when indi-\ncated. Moreover, common clinical and\nphysiological pathways between obesity\nand diabetes may allow the development\nof interventions that might improve dia-\nbetes-related complications and func-\ntional disability in this population.\n"
