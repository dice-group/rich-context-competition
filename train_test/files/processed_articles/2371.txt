This article will report trend information com-\nparing the 2003 data from the Developmental Victim-\nization Survey (DVS) and 2008 data from the National\nStudy of Children Exposed to Violence to assess whether\ndeclines have continued during this period.\nMETHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nThis analysis compared juvenile victimization data obtained from\n2 very similar national surveys conducted 5 years apart. The\nearlier survey, the DVS, collected data on 2030 children aged\nNational Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NATSCEV)\nData on experiences of violence and abuse in both surveys\nwere obtained using very similar items from the Juvenile Vic-\ntimization Questionnaire (JVQ). The JVQ is a comprehensive\ninstrument designed to screen for a wide range of victimiza-\ntion events, covering such general areas of concern as physical\nassault, property victimization, child maltreatment, peer and\nsibling victimization, sexual victimization, witnessing vio-\nlence, and indirect exposure to violence.12 Both surveys asked\nthe same questions about 34 separate victimization types and\ncollected similar demographic and background information.\nThe sampling methodology and procedures for both stud-\nies are described in detail elsewhere13,14 and will only be sum-\nmarized here. Although data collection occurred 5 years apart,\nthe studies were parallel in most respects. Both relied on a na-\ntionwide sampling of residential telephone numbers and used\nlist-assisted random-digit dialing for sample selection and data\ncollection. List-assisted random-digit dialing is the generally\naccepted method for scientific sampling of households with tele-\nphones in the United States. The sampling frame is landline resi-\ndential telephone banks with 1 or more listed (available for di-\nrectory publication or directory assistance) residential telephone\ning residential landline telephone numbers are still located in\ntheir listed telephone banks. In both studies, a short interview\nwas conducted with an adult caregiver (usually a parent) to ob-\ntain family background information. Then, 1 child was ran-\ndomly selected from all eligible children living in the house-\nhold by selecting the child with the most recent birthday. If\nthe selected child was aged 10 to 17 years, the primary inter-\nview was conducted with the child. If the selected child was\naged 2 to 9 years, it was conducted with the caregiver who was\n\"most familiar with the child's daily routine and experiences.\"\nFor the earlier survey (DVS), interviews were completed with\n79% of the eligible persons contracted. The sample for the more\nrecent survey (NATSCEV) combined a national cross-section\nportion (n=3053) with an oversampled portion drawing from\ntelephone exchanges with high proportions of Hispanic, Afri-\ncan American, or low-income households (n=1496). Inter-\nviews were completed with 71% of the eligible persons con-\ntacted in the cross-section and 63% of those contacted in the\noversample.\nConsent was obtained from the parent and assent from the\nchild. All procedures in both studies had been approved by the\ninstitutional review board at the University of New Hamp-\nshire. In both surveys, weights were calculated and applied to\ncontrol for the differential probability of selection of cases ow-\ning to sampling procedures and variations in within-\nhousehold eligibility and to adjust the sample counts to match\nexisting national demographic profiles in terms of child age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, and household income.\nMEASUREMENT\nExposures were assessed with the 34 JVQ items noted earlier\n(Table). Each item asked whether the child experienced a spe-\ncifically described event. The items included exposure to abuse,\nviolent acts, crimes, and acts that would be considered crimes\nif committed among adults, though in some cases not consid-\nered criminal when occurring among children (eg, hitting by\npeers or siblings). Virtually all of the exposures that were in-\ncluded have been studied individually as traumas or threats to\nchildren's welfare in other research. The same items were used\nfor the self-report interview (children aged 10-17 years) and\nthe caregiver interview (children aged 2-9 years), with slight\nwording changes to appropriately identify the subject of the ques-\ntion (eg, \"Did anyone use force to take something away from\nyour child/you that he or she was/you were carrying or wear-\ning?\"). The JVQ has shown evidence of good test-retest reli-\nability and construct validity across a wide spectrum of devel-\nTo facilitate analysis and help clarify trends, the 34 pri-\nmary victimizations were organized into 8 general domains, each\nreflecting distinctive aspects of juvenile victimization. Eight ag-\ngregate measures were constructed to represent each child's over-\nall experience within each domain, with each measure record-\ning whether a child had experienced any victimization of that\ntype. The aggregates are physical assault, property victimiza-\ntion, maltreatment, peer-sibling victimization, sexual victim-\nization, sexual assault, witnessing family violence, and expo-\nsure to community violence. For example, physical assault\ndocuments whether a child experienced any of the relevant\nphysical assault screeners, and maltreatment records any mal-\ntreatment episode (aggregate measures and associated screen-\ners are presented in the Table). One screener, \"sex with an adult,\"\nwas allowed to stand alone because variability in state laws about\nage of consent means that in some cases these exposures con-\nstituted statutory sex offenses and in others they did not.\nThe victimizations of interest for the present analysis were\nthose that occurred within the year prior to the interview. In-\nformation on victimization timing was obtained somewhat dif-\nferently in the DVS and NATSCEV. For the DVS, each ques-\ntion asked specifically about experiences \"in the past year.\" The\nNATSCEV asked each question with the phrase \"At any time\nin your child's/your life . . . ,\" which was followed with an ad-\nditional question designed to isolate past-year episodes from\nvictimizations that might have occurred earlier in the child's\nlife (\"Thinking of [the last time/when] this happened . . . did\nit happen in the last year?\"). In both surveys, cues were pro-\nvided to assist the respondent in setting and applying the past-\nyear time frame. A measure of socioeconomic status was com-\nputed by combining the measure of the child's household income\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nwith the measure of the highest level of education achieved by\neither of the child's caregivers.\nVictimization rates calculated for the DVS sample were com-\npared with those calculated from the NATSCEV sample to de-\ntermine whether significant changes had occurred in victim-\nization levels during the 5-year interval. For both surveys, the\nrate for each victimization was computed as the proportion of\nchildren in the sample who reported that type of victimization\nexperience in the year preceding their interview. Rates are re-\nported as percentages of each sample base. For aggregate vic-\ntimizations, the rate was the proportion of children in each sur-\nvey who had any victimization of each aggregate type. Weighted\ndata were used for both surveys to ensure that each sample was\nas representative of national patterns as possible.\nAssessment of significant differences in each set of rates was\nbased on a 2-sample difference-of-proportions test. Because the\nsurveys were similar in design but not completely identical, we\nchose to take a conservative stance in comparing victimiza-\ntion rates. For purposes of this analysis, differences were sta-\ntistically significant at P.01 ().\nRESULTS\nSeveral types of victimization were reported less often\nchildren and any peer-sibling victimization in the ag-\nwere affected by the drop in the single item on peer and\nsibling assault (an item included in both aggregates).\nThe peer/sibling victimization aggregate decline was\nalso strongly affected by the large drop in physical bul-\nlying, and a smaller decline (significant at P.05 but\nnot P.01) in emotional bullying. Any property vic-\ntimization did not decline, but theft and burglary of\nfamily households did individually. The small decline\nin any maltreatment was not significant, but the item on\npsychological and emotional abuse, which makes the\nlargest contribution to maltreatment, did decline sig-\nnificantly. The annual prevalence of any sexual assault\ndeclined from 3.3% to 2.0% of children. Sex with an\nadult (tracking possible statutory sex offenses) also de-\nclined.

Two indi-\nvidual items showed significant increases: robbery and\nwitnessing the physical abuse of a sibling.\nAnalysis of the trends by gender and age showed no\ndifferences in the patterns.

Sexual assault appeared to decline, as did thefts. These\ndeclines are consistent with trends apparent in the Na-\ntional Crime Victimization Survey, which since 2003 has\nshown marked drops in 12- to 17-year-old adolescents\nreporting assaults, sexual assault, and property crime.\nAmong the victimizations that did not decline were\nadult-instigated victimizations, including physical abuse\nand neglect, and exposure to adult domestic violence.\nChild exposure to adult physical abuse actually showed\nan increase. These patterns are somewhat at odds with\ndata on child maltreatment substantiations, for ex-\nample, which have indicated some declines in physical\nsubstantiated abuse reflect agency data, which are influ-\nenced by many factors besides real underlying rate\nchanges. Moreover, the number of cases of reportable child\nmaltreatment appearing in general population surveys of\nthe sort compared here may be too small to allow the de-\ntection of the relatively modest trends like the 17% de-\ncline in physical abuse shown by the federal child abuse\ndata during this period.\nHowever, there are possible reasons why various forms\nof peer victimization may have declined more than those\nperpetrated by adults. In the wake of several high-\nprofile school shooting episodes in the late 1990s, many\nschools began to rapidly adopt anti-bullying and other\nviolence-prevention policies and programs. Formal evalu-\nations of some of these programs have shown them to\nbe successful in reducing violence and bullying.17,18 De-\nclines in peer-related victimization during the mid-\n2000s may be one of the effects of this social-problem\nmobilization.\nThe finding that the declines were greater among chil-\ndren of lower socioeconomic status households is plau-\nsible as well. Various theories about recent declines in\ncrime rates have mentioned such factors as increasing po-\nlice staffing and activity (including at schools),7,19 grow-\ning immigration among groups with a high motivation\nfor economic advancement, and the development and dis-\nsemination of psychiatric medications to segments of the\npopulation previously not amenable to mental health ser-\nvices.4 These factors might be expected to have more im-\npact on low\u00adsocioeconomic status communities and chil-\ndren.\nHowever, the trend data in this study need to be in-\nterpreted with an important caveat concerning at least 1\nmethodological difference that could be an alternative ex-\nplanation for any drop. In the 2003 survey, respondents\nwere asked the questions about victimizations in the past\nyear first, before being asked in some selected instances\nabout any lifetime exposure to a subset of the victimiza-\ntion screeners. In the 2008 survey, by contrast, respon-\ndents were asked about lifetime exposures for all screen-\ners first and then asked to specify if any of these occurred\nin the last year. It is possible that respondents in 2003,\nbeing asked first about a 1-year time frame, eager to ap-\npear helpful or responsive and not knowing they would\nhave another opportunity to disclose them later, re-\nported some episodes within the past year that had ac-\ntually occurred earlier, a process known in epidemiol-\nogy as \"telescoping.\" In 2008, such respondents would\nhave had an opportunity to disclose those episodes in the\nfirst set of inquiries about lifetime exposure and then\nmight have been more accurate in their judgment about\nwhether they occurred in the past year or not. This pro-\ncess could have resulted in lower past-year estimates in\nOn the other hand, the pattern of findings in 2003 and\n2008 does not strongly support the telescoping expla-\nnation for the changes between the surveys. A telescop-\ning difference might have been expected to show up across\nall screeners, though some of the screeners actually\nshowed little change. In addition, it is not clear why the\ntelescoping would have applied more to peer victimiza-\ntions than adult-perpetrated ones. Another argument\nagainst a telescoping explanation is that delinquent be-\nhaviors in the past year (measured separately and in ex-\nnot presented here). This is consistent with a real de-\ncline in victimization.\nThe data analyzed in this study can be read as a pos-\nsible additional confirmation that declines have oc-\ncurred in some forms of child victimization during the\nrecent past. If that is true, it is certainly encouraging news\nfor those working to create safer environments for chil-\ndren, an endeavor that has mobilized a considerable quan-\ntity of resources in the last few decades.\nCorrespondence: David Finkelhor, PhD, Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University of New Hamp-\nshire, 126 Horton Social Science Center, 20 College Rd,\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Finkel-\nhor, Turner, and Hamby.
