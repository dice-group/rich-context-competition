In rural, northeastern South Africa, people living with HIV often ping-pong between traditional healers\nand allopathic providers.\nMethods: We conducted 27 in-depth interviews and 133 surveys with a random sample of traditional healers living in\nBushbuckridge, South Africa, where anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is publicly available, to learn: (1) healer perspectives\nabout which HIV patients they choose to treat; (2) the type of treatment offered; (3) outcomes expected, and; (4) the\ncost of delivering treatment.\nResults: Healers were mostly female (77%), older (median: 58.0 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50\u00ad67), with\nlow levels of formal education (median: 3.7 years; IQR: 3.2\u00ad4.2). Thirty-nine healers (30%) reported being able\nto cure HIV in an adult patients whose (CD4) count was >350cells/mm3. If an HIV-infected patient preferred\ntraditional treatment, healers differentiated two categories of known HIV-infected patients, CD4+ cell counts\n<350 or 350 cells/mm3. Patients with low CD4 counts were routinely referred back to the health facility.\nHealers who reported offering/performing a traditional cure for HIV had practiced for less time (mean = 16.9\nof education (mean = 2.8 vs. 4.1 years; p = 0.017) when compared to healers who reported not treating HIV-\ninfected patients. Healers charged a median of 92 USD to treat patients with HIV.\nConclusion: Traditional healers referred suspected HIV-infected patients to standard allopathic care, yet\ncontinued to treat HIV-infected patients with higher CD4 counts. A greater emphasis on patient education\nand healer engagement is warranted.\n",

Despite allo-\npathic practitioner's concerns with traditional medicine\nuse, patients still seek, and often prefer, alternative treat-\nments. Healers generally speak the same local languages\nas patients, spend more time with patients explaining\nthe source of the illness and the necessary treatments,\noffer greater perceived compassion than clinicians, and\nare oftentimes more easily accessible [11]. When experi-\nencing illness, it is common for patients to go back and\nforth between the allopathic health system and the trad-\nitional health system [2, 11\u00ad13]. Medical pluralism is\ncommon among patients dealing with a variety of\nchronic and acute ailments, including HIV, leading to\npoorer health outcomes among individuals who delay or\nabandon allopathic treatment for biomedical conditions\ncontrol healer treatment of HIV, with those claiming the\nability to cure the disease censured by provincial or\ndistrict health offices and by their own healer\norganizations.\nLittle work has been done to document HIV-related\ntreatment provided by the traditional health system cur-\nrently functioning within the rural Bushbuckridge area\nwhere the MRC/Wits Agincourt Research Unit has been\nrunning a Health and socio-Demographic Surveillance\nSystem (HDSS) since 1992. While we know some people\nemploy traditional services for their HIV care and treat-\nment, we know little of healer perspectives about which\nHIV patients they choose to treat, the type of treatment\noffered, outcome expected, and the cost of treatment.\nThis study was undertaken to address this paucity.\nMethods\nStudy location\nThe study was conducted in the Agincourt sub-\ndistrict, Mpumalanga province, northeastern South\nAfrica. The MRC/Wits Agincourt Research Unit over-\nsees the maintenance and operation of the Agincourt\nHDSS. Roughly 500 km northeast of Johannesburg,\nthe unit has been engaged in population-based health\nAgincourt HDSS population is comprised of roughly\nRoughly one-third of the permanent HDSS population is\ncomprised of former Mozambican refugees, who immi-\ngrated to South Africa during the 1980s. The study area\ncontains eight government run clinics, a public-private\ncommunity health center, and one large public health cen-\nter. Patients are referred to three district hospitals, each\nlocated at 25\u00ad55 km from the site and relying primarily\non public means of transport. HIV testing and treatment\nis available at all public health care facilities in the\nAgincourt sub-district. Therapy initially became available\nat district hospitals in 2007, with a complete roll-out of\nStudy population\nTraditional healers who are registered with Kukula\norganization [22] were randomly selected using the ran-\ndom selection function in Stata\u00ae (StataCorp, LP, College\nStation, Texas, USA). The Kukula organization consists\nof more than 300 traditional healers who have organized\nto champion for healer rights and responsibilities in the\nBushbuckridge region. The majority of healers living in\nthe area are members. Of the 169 participants (from a\npopulation of 280) selected to participate, four were no\nlonger living in the area and five had died. Of the 160\nhealers who were located and approached to participate\nin the study, all accepted (100% acceptance rate).\nEthics, consent and permissions\nThis study was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional\nand the Mpumalanga Department of Health's Research\nEthics Committee. All participants provided written in-\nformed consent.\nData collection\nWe conducted 27 in-depth interviews followed by 133\nWe used the in-depth interviews to inform and further\nrefine the development of the questionnaire used for the\nsurvey. Open, semi-structured interviews were con-\nducted in xiTsonga by a trained qualitative field super-\nvisor (SN; the other co-authors participated in several of\nthe interviews) and were focused on generating data on\nhow healers diagnosed illness, how they learned to treat\nHIV, how they decided which HIV-infected patients to\naccept for treatment, and whether they believed they\ncould cure the HIV virus from infected patients. Trad-\nitional healers were also asked about the ability of allo-\npathic medicine to treat HIV. Interviews lasted an average\nof 61 min. Quantitative surveys, borne from the findings\nof our qualitative interviews, asked healers how they diag-\nnosed HIV, preferred treatment strategies, anticipated out-\ncomes, and costs charged to patients. Data was also\ncollected on the number and type of patient diagnoses in\nthe past seven and 30 days. Given limitations in healer lit-\neracy, survey data was collected via face-to-face interviews\nwith healers at their preferred location.\nData analysis\nSurvey participant characteristics and service uptake\nwere presented as frequencies with percentages or\nmedians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Multivariable\nlog-binomial regression was used to model the odds of\ntreating HIV. The model was adjusted for age and edu-\ncation level.\nQualitative data were transcribed within two weeks of\nthe interview into xiTsonga and were subsequently\ntranslated into English. Two researchers participated in\nthe thematic analysis, both with extensive experience\nconducting qualitative research. Agreement in coding\nwas reviewed and discrepancies resolved by consensus.\nA comparison of coding agreement on the first six inter-\nviews found 90% agreement using Cohen's Kappa in\nMAXQDA\u00ae (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) software.\nResults\nTraditional healer demographics\nAmong healers who participated in the quantitative sur-\nveys, healers in the rural Bushbuckridge were mostly fe-\npracticing traditional medicine for an average of21 years\n(SD: 14)), and had low levels of education (mean3.7 years\n[SD: 3]). Ninety-two healers (69%) self-identified primar-\nily as an Inyanga (herbalist), with the remaining healers\nidentifying as a Sangoma [divine treatment; 34 (26%)],\nherbalist [2 (1%)], or \"other\" [5 (4%)]. Among all healers,\nthe mean number of patients treated in the past month\nwas 6; however, among active healers (those seeing a\nleast one patient per month), an average of 12 patients.\nThe majority of healers did not identify with any par-\nticular religion (n = 68, 52%), but the most common reli-\ngious affiliations were Zion (n = 19, 15%), Apostolic\nImmigration from Mozambique (either themselves or\ntheir parents) was reported by 94 (71%) of healers; how-\never, only 4 (3%) reported speaking fluent Portuguese.\nThe most commonly reported languages spoken in-\nDiagnosis and treatment\nWhen initiating the diagnosis process, healers described\nthe legal rationale of accompanying the patient to the\nallopathic health care facility for HIV and TB testing.\n\"Yes, it is a law that if a patient comes to us we have to\nrefer them to the hospital to be tested. We are not\nallowed to treat a patient without being tested ...\"\n(female, unknown age). Despite the health regulation re-\nquiring them to refer all patients suspected of having\nHIV to clinical sites for HIV counseling and testing,\nhealers acknowledged that they might unknowingly treat\nHIV if a patient lies about their status or refuses to test.\nAs such, traditional healers often offer treatment for\nsymptoms suggestive of HIV infection, without knowing\nwhether or not a patient is HIV-positive. One healer\nnoted, \"The problem with HIV is that you don't know if\nyou are treating it or not; because when a patient has\ndiarrhea we give her treatment, when she is coughing or\nshe had sores or anything, we just give her treatment to\ntake. Then we end up not knowing if we are treating it\n[HIV] or not\" (female, 54 years).\nHealers who claimed to cure HIV reported diagnosing\nthe illness through traditional practices (throwing the\nbones, for example), while others discussed accompany-\ning suspected HIV cases to the clinic for testing. Healers\nwho brought patients to the health facility waited with\nthem, and, if they tested HIV positive, ascertained their\nCD4 cell count from the patient. Qualitative interviews\nrevealed healers differentiating between two categories\nof known HIV-infected patients: (1) those with CD4 < 350\nwere less likely to treat patients with a low CD4 for fear\nthat they will die in their care: \"If the person is not bed-\nridden I do treat her but when she comes to me being\ncritical ill, I will not cure her because her CD4 count will\nbe very low and they [her immune system] are failing to\nfight the virus\" (female, 50 years). Among those sur-\nveyed, only 18 (14%) reported successfully curing HIV-\ninfected adult patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3,\nwhile 39 (30%) reported successfully treating HIV-\ninfected adult patients with CD4 cell >350 cells/mm3.\nTreatment strategies included providing herbal remedies\nto be ingested and/or injected. One healer describes the\ntreatment process: \"I will give him two liters of the treat-\nment [containing a mixture of six herbs]. He will take it\nand after two or three days he will start to have diarrhea\nand when he tells me that he has started to have diar-\nrhea I will give him a due date; and I will ask him if they\nhave the tree that I want him to dig its roots and when\nhe says they have it I will tell him to dig or to eat its\nleaves... his diarrhea will stop and I will also tell him to\nstop taking the medication that I have given him. He has\nto come back and collect another treatment that will\ncure him. All the powers of things that will create AIDS\nwill be gone after taking the treatment and having diar-\nrhea.\" (Male, 78 years).\nHealers who reported treating HIV-infected patients\nwith >350 cells/mm3 (versus those who did not) treated\nand had lower levels of education (2.8 vs 4.1 years;\np = 0.017) (Table 1). Inyangas had higher odds of treat-\ning someone with HIV versus Sangomas (OR: 2.49), but\nthis was not statistically significant (p = 0.068). Modified\nPoisson regression using robust errors revealed Inyangas\np = 0.049) (Table 2). Being above the median age and in-\ncreased educational attainment reduced the risk of treat-\ning HIV-infected patients but fell short of the 0.05\nthreshold for significance. Qualitative interviews re-\nvealed that leaves and roots from the Ximuwana, Gashu,\nand Nkompa trees were most commonly used to treat\nHIV symptoms. Healers charged a median of 92 USD\nReferral to and from allopathic care providers\nHealers were generally confident in their ability to treat\ncertain conditions, but they also frequently referred pa-\ntients to the health facility for HIV and TB testing, to\ntreat dehydration/blood loss, and to assist patients they\njudged themselves as unable to cure. Among the healers\nin this study, 113 (85%) had referred a patient for dehy-\ndration or for a blood transfusion and 47 (36%) referred\na patient to a clinic because they could not successfully\ntreat them. While these transfers were common, they\nalso led to patients shuttling back-and-forth between the\ntwo systems. One healer explains, \"When looking at the\npatient, I can see that this one doesn't have water in his\nbody because he will be very weak... What I do is to tell\nhim to go to the hospital and get tested and after testing\nand have the results you will come back to me for treat-\nment\" (Male, 67 years).\nDiscussion\nTraditional healers in Bushbuckridge, where ART is\navailable at public hospitals and clinics, continue to treat\nHIV-infected patients for both HIV and other opportun-\nistic infections resulting from HIV. Inyangas, or herbal-\nists, were at higher risk of believing they could cure an\nHIV-infected patient than a Sangoma, an unexpected\nfinding given the history of Sangomas treating HIV in\nSouth Africa [23]. Our data revealed the increasing so-\nphistication of healer practices: healers selected which\nHIV-infected patients to treat based on CD4 counts.\nHealers were avoiding the treatment of any perceived\nend-stage terminal conditions, as the death of a patient\nis bad for business. Furthermore, treating HIV-infected\nindividuals seemingly resulted in increased business.\nHealers claimed that they could cure HIV, leaving pa-\ntients with no negative health implications after treat-\nment, a potentially more tempting offer to patients than\nART for life. Engagement with healers may need to focus\non healer's ability to both appreciate and subsequently\nadvertise their own survival rates to gain entry into the\ntraditional system.\nTraditional healers were universally hesitant to dis-\nclose their strategies and sources of medication to\ntreat, highlighted their concern with the theft of their\nintellectual property [24]. They discussed the use of\nunspecified herbs (ingested and injected), baths, and\nceremony to cure the patient from HIV. The use of\nrazors to inject herbs under the skin of patients is\nconcerning, given the risk of HIV transmission from\nthe patient to the healer [25].\nThe cost of traditional treatment is high, considering\nboth median income and that primary health care, in-\ncluding antiretroviral therapy, [21] is free to the patient\nin South Africa. A recent study from South Africa ex-\nploring the cost of traditional healer treatment among\npeople with epilepsy found costs to be somewhat lower\nthan HIV treatment, but still substantially higher than\nallopathic health care costs [26]. While we cannot iden-\ntify the number or proportion of HIV-infected patients\npaying these high fees, qualitative interviews and previ-\nous research in Bushbuckridge suggest a large number\nof patients do accept their treatment [2].\nTraditional healers do refer patients to the allopathic\nhealth care system to ensure that patients suspected of\nbeing HIV-infected are tested and, in some cases, treated\nfor HIV. In this study, at least 85% of healers had previ-\nously referred patients to allopathic services. This inter-\naction highlights, at least, some current level of\nengagement between the two systems and while this\nstudy suggests that this engagement is possibly a result\nof fear of legal prosecution, further research on whether\nvoluntary engagement is warranted given the strong re-\nlationship between community members and traditional\nTable 1 Healer characteristics by claim to cure HIV\nClaims to cure Cannot cure Combined p-value\nNumber of patients past\nmonth (mean, SD)\nastatistically significant\nTable 2 Risk of intentionally treating HIV\nRisk ratio Robust standard\nerrors\nAge Category\n(>median age)\nNumber of patients\n(per additional patient)\nEducation\n(per additional year)\nastatistically significant\nhealers, and the large number of registered healers in\nthe Bushbuckridge area. Further engagement could fa-\ncilitate the incorporation of their work into the allo-\npathic health system. If trained and effectively engaged,\ntraditional healers could help increase early diagnosis\nand therapy uptake with prompt referrals, adherence\nsupport, and avoidance of herb-drug interactions and\noutcomes for people with HIV in an region beset with\nextremely high levels of HIV [19].\nEfforts to increase healer knowledge about specific dis-\neases, improve relationships with allopathic practi-\ntioners, and reduce delays to allopathic care have been\npiloted with traditional healers in diverse countries, in-\ncluding Brazil, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroon,\nLesotho, Gambia, Nepal, and India [33\u00ad48] with mixed\nresults.\nOur random sample of traditional healers living in\nnortheastern rural South Africa allowed us to generate\ndata that reflects the source population. However, sev-\neral factors may limit our results. Recall bias may con-\nstrain a healer's ability to remember the number of\npatients (and their diagnosis) treated in the past 30 days.\nSocial desirability bias may have resulted in fewer healers\nreporting the treatment of HIV given healer's knowledge\nthat treating HIV through traditional means is viewed\nnegatively in South Africa. The interviewer attempted to\nreduce this bias by assuring healers that the data would\nnot be reported to local authorities nor was she associ-\nated with any of the local health facilities.\nConclusion\nTraditional healers in rural South Africa are continuing to\ntreat HIV symptoms in patients, often at prices much\nhigher than the free primary allopathic healthcare avail-\nable in the area. Further understanding of commonalities\nand differences between traditional and allopathic health\ncare systems, ways of ensuring risk reduction among the\ntraditional healers, and promotion of honest and targeted\ndialogue between the two systems may allow for greater\ncoordination between the two systems and an ultimate\nimprovement in HIV patient care in rural South Africa.\nAbbreviations\nART: Anti-retroviral therapy; CD4 cells: Cluster of differentiation 4;\nHDSS: Health and socio-Demographic Surveillance System; HIV: Human\nimmunodeficiency virus; IQR: Interquartile range\n"
