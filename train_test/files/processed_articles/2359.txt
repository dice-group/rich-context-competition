Widowhood may result in declines in health and potentially stressful changes to daily routines. However,\nlittle research has examined how daily stressors contribute to physical and emotional well-being in widowhood. The\nobjectives of the current study were to examine daily stressor exposure and reactivity in widowed versus married older\nadults.\nMethod. Participants included all 100 widowed and 342 married adults aged 65 and older from the National Study\nof Daily Experiences, a daily diary study from the second wave of the Midlife in the United States. Daily stressors were\nmeasured using the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events; multilevel modeling assessed daily reactivity to stressors using\ndaily negative affect (emotional reactivity) and daily physical symptoms (physical reactivity) as outcomes.\nResults. Married participants reported more stressors in general, and specifically more interpersonal stressors (e.g.,\narguments). Both married and widowed participants were reactive to daily stressors. Married participants were physically\nand emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors. Widowed participants were more physically reactive to home-related\nstressors.\nDiscussion. Attention to the types of daily stressors that widowed older adults experience in daily life and the poten-\ntial physical effects of daily stressors during widowhood may help to alleviate some of the physical distress that widowed\nolder adults may experience.\nKey Words: Stress--Well-being--Widowhood--Daily diary.\nWidowhood is a common and stressful life event,\nwhich is likely to be accompanied by changes in all\naspects of daily life, and for some widows(er)s who have\nrecently experienced bereavement, a decline in mental and\nphysical health (Wilcox et al., 2003). Compared with their\nmarried counterparts, widowed older adults have increased\nrisk of mortality and morbidity (Stroebe, Schut, & Stroebe,\n2007). In addition, widowed older adults, compared with\nmarried older adults, have, on average, a 44% lower eco-\nnomic status (McGarry & Schoeni, 2005). Declines in\nphysical and mental health and disruptions to finances may\ncollectively result in distress for widowed older adults that\nmay potentially compromise long-term health and well-\nbeing. Much of the widowhood research has examined the\nwell-being of widowed older adults using mainly clinical\nor retrospective global measures of well-being, and less is\nknown about how this distressing life event may give rise to\nother types of stressful experiences, such as subtle day-to-\nday stressors or hassles.\nDaily hassles are the minor, frequently occurring\nchallenges of daily life, such as household chores or having\na disagreement with a family member (Almeida, 2005;\nBolger, Delongis, Kessler, & Schilling, 1989; McIntyre,\n2008) that have immediate, direct effects on health and\nwell-being (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003). The chronic\nexperience of stress, such as that which may occur in\nresponse to continued daily stress within the context\nof widowhood may lead to increased proinflammatory\ncytokines (Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser,\n2002) and an overactivation and dysregulation of the body's\nstress response that may result in a decreased ability to\nrespond to stress and potentially negative health outcomes\n(Finch & Seeman, 1999). Previous research indicates that\nindividuals who experience repeated exposure to stress\n(e.g., caregivers) or stressful life events have an increased\nrisk of worse physical and emotional health (Nolen-\nFurthermore, it has also been suggested that disruption to\ndaily activities may be a possible mechanism by which older\nadults with increased genetic, biological, or environmental\nrisk of depression experience depressive symptoms (Fiske,\nWetherell, & Gatz, 2009). Over time, widowhood may\nrequire adjustment to new and different routines, identities,\nand roles compared with previously established routines,\ndaily activities, or personal identity (Naef, Ward, Mahrer-\nThe dual process coping model posits that bereavement\ninvolves not only adjustment and coping with the emotional\nloss of the spouse (loss-orientated coping) but also\nadjustment to the changes in roles, responsibilities, and\ndaily routines after the death of the spouse (restoration-\noriented coping; Stroebe & Schut, 1999). Restoration-\noriented coping has been found to be more common a\nyear or more after the death of the spouse and has been\nassociated with positive outcomes, such as self-reported\npersonal growth and increased daily living skills (Caserta &\nprocess model by incorporating the measurement of loss-\norientated and restoration-oriented coping in the Inventory\nof Daily Widowed Life, which includes 22 items of daily\nlife activities assessed retrospectively during the past week,\nincluding visiting with friends or relatives, engaging in\nvolunteer or work activities, and managing household\nresponsibilities. Research is needed to prospectively\nexamine naturally occurring daily experiences among\nwidowhood to better understand whether the long-term\nchanges in daily experiences as a result of widowhood are\nrelated to differential exposure to stressors. Furthermore,\nresearch is also needed to better understand how the\npotentially different frequency and type of stressors that\nwidowed older adults experience may be associated with\nphysical and emotional well-being as a potential explanatory\nmechanism for increased distress in widowed older adults.\nThe current study aimed to further contribute to this\nresearch and address some of the gaps in the literature by\nexamining widowed older adults' adjustment to daily life.\nThe current study used a daily diary approach to examine\nthe potential role of daily stressors in relation to physical\nand emotional well-being by examining differences in the\ndaily stress process between married and widowed older\nadults. Advantages of the daily diary approach include the\nmeasurement of events and experiences that \"meaningfully\"\nvary over a short period of time and the ability to explain\nthe short-term variability in individuals (Affleck, Zautra,\nThe daily stress process model incorporates both the\nmeasurement of stressors and their effects on health as well\nasthelikelihoodthattheseconceptswillvarywithintheshort\nterm in individuals. The daily stress process considers both\nthe likelihood that an individual will encounter a stressor\n(i.e., stressor exposure) and an individual's emotional,\nphysiological, or behavioral response to that stressor (i.e.,\nstressor reactivity; Almeida, 2005; Bolger & Zuckerman,\n1995). Using this daily stress process model, past research\nhas identified that individuals report more physical symp-\ntoms and higher negative affect (Almeida, 2005) when they\nexperience more daily stressors. The model also incorpo-\nrates the measurement of characteristics of stressors (e.g.,\nstressor content) as well as resilience and risk factors (e.g.,\nbereavement or health factors; Almeida, 2005). In order to\nbetter understand the possible mechanisms of distress and\ninform intervention and supportive services for widowed\nolder adults, the model emphasizes the importance of not\nonly examining stressors as a whole but also of examin-\ning specific types of daily stressors (e.g., stressors at home,\nconflict with relative or friend) that may be related to worse\nMarital Status and Daily Stressor Exposure\nWidowhood is a risk factor that may result in significant\nchanges to everyday life and increased exposure to stressful\nor negative daily experiences. Previous research has found\nthat men report an increase in the number of hours spent\ndoing housework activities after the loss of their spouse\n(Utz, Reidy, Carr, Nesse, & Wortman, 2004). For older\nadults who may have relied on their spouse for daily tasks\nor who are not proficient in completing those tasks, different\nroutines may be particularly distressing after their spouses'\nLund's (2007) Inventory of Daily Widowed Life identifies\nother possible disruptions or changes to daily life following\nwidowhood, including \"learning to do new things,\" \"deal-\ning with financial matters,\" and \"finding ways to keep busy\nor occupied.\" Previous research has also identified greater\ndaily exchanges of support with friends or relatives among\nwidowed older adults compared with married older adults\nthat may be due to changes in household responsibilities\n(Hahn, Cichy, Almeida, & Haley, 2011). As a result, rela-\ntionships with friends and relatives may be particularly\nimportant for widowed older adults (Ha & Ingersoll-Dayton,\n2011). Supportive relationships with family and friends\nhelp with widowed older adults' adjustment (Utz, Carr,\nNesse, & Wortman, 2002); however, increased contact with\nfamily and friends also present opportunities to experience\nstressful interpersonal events, such as arguments or disa-\ngreements. Despite the possible changes to daily routines,\nresearch has yet to examine whether widowhood is associ-\nated with greater exposure to daily stressors and whether\ndifferent types of stressors, such as household responsibili-\nties or interpersonal stressors, occur more frequently among\nwidowed adults compared with their married counterparts.\nMarital Status and Daily Stressor Reactivity\nReactivity in daily life may be a marker of the effect\nof stressors on health and well-being. Previous research\nexamining reactivity to daily stressors has examined both\nphysical and emotional reactivity to stressors (i.e., daily\naffect and physical symptoms; Affleck, Tennen, Urrows,\nDaily stressors have been associated with higher daily\nnegative affect among older adults (Mroczek & Almeida,\nHowever, other research has found similar emotional\nreactivity to stressors among older and younger adults\n(Stawski, Sliwinski, Almeida, & Smyth, 2008) or lower\nemotional reactivity among older compared with younger\nadults (Neupert, Almeida, & Charles, 2007). Research\nthat investigates differences in emotional reactivity as a\nfunction of marital status may help to inform the current\nstate of research on emotional reactivity among older\nadults. Increased risk of morbidity and decreased financial\nresources during bereavement may alter widowed older\nadults' capacity to respond to stressors over time, possibly\nresulting in decreased resilience. Previous research suggests\nthat widowed older adults may experience physical effects\nof stressors as evidenced by increased heart rate and\nincreased heart rate variability compared with depressed\nand nonrecently bereaved participants (O'Connor, Allen, &\nStressors may not only affect physical health but daily\nstressors may also affect emotional health. Emotion\nregulation, such as in the context of coping with daily\nstressors, has been identified as an important risk fac-\ntor for bereavement outcomes (Stroebe & Schut, 1999).\nArguably, the chronic concerns widowed older adults\nface, such as financial hardship, may exhaust their cop-\ning resources, leaving them more vulnerable than their\nmarried counterparts to the negative effects of daily has-\nsles, such as an argument with a friend or an unexpected\nproblem at home. Despite the evidence suggesting possi-\nble increased physical reactivity in widowed older adults\nand the importance of daily emotional well-being for\nlong-term outcomes, research is limited that examines\nboth emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors\namong widowed older adults.\nCurrent Study\nOur study examined both within-person (WP) and\nbetween-person (BP) differences in responses to daily\nstressors in widowed and married older adults. In other\nwords, analyses were conducted that examined how indi-\nviduals compare with themselves (WP effects or intraindi-\nvidual variability) and how they compare with others (BP\neffects or interindividual variability). The WP analyses\nexamined whether an outcome (e.g., daily negative affect)\nis significantly associated with increased stressors com-\npared with that person's typical level of stressors. The BP\nanalyses examined whether individuals who experience\nmore stress, on average, have higher daily negative affect.\nThe current study has four specific research hypotheses.\nFirst, widowed participants will experience a greater num-\nber of daily stressors compared with married participants\n(Hypothesis 1). Second, participants will report higher\ndaily negative affect and more physical symptoms on\nstressor days than on nonstressor days (WP stressor effect;\nHypothesis 2). Third, participants who experience more\nstressors, in general, will have greater negative affect and\na greater number of physical symptoms compared with\nparticipants who experience fewer stressors, in general (BP\nstressor effect; Hypothesis 3). Fourth, we examined the\nextent to which marital status (i.e., married vs. widowed)\nmoderated both WP and BP effects of daily stressors. We\nhypothesized that widowed participants would experience\ngreater emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors\ncompared with their married counterparts (Hypothesis 4).\nMethod\nProcedure and Sample\nRespondents are from the second wave of the National\nStudy of Daily Experiences (NSDE II;Almeida, McGonagle,\n& King, 2009). NSDE II is one of the in-depth satellite\nstudies of the second wave of the Midlife in the United\nStates Survey (MIDUS II), a nationally representative tele-\nNSDE II study were randomly selected from the larger\nMIDUS II study, and the response rate for the NSDE II\nsample was 86%. As part of NSDE II data collection, par-\nticipants completed up to eight daily interviews once a day\nfor eight consecutive days. On average, married participants\naged 65 and older in the current study completed 7.6 out of\n8 interviews and widowed participants completed on aver-\nage 7.4 interviews out of 8 compared with an average of 7.2\nout of 8 interviews in the larger NSDE sample. Chi-square\nanalyses revealed no statistically significant differences in\nthe percentage of missed days for widowed versus married\nparticipants (p > .05).\nried participants aged 65 and older who participated in\nNSDE II. There was not an adequate number of single or\ndivorced adults aged 65 and older to make a meaningful\ncomparison, so the current study includes only married and\nwidowed adults. Participants received $20 for participating\nin the project, which consisted of nightly telephone inter-\nviews, where respondents answered questions about their\nday. Participants were on average, 72 years of age, half\nwere female (54.98%), and most participants were White\nThe widowed participants were significantly older, more\nlikely to be female, and reported lower levels of education.\nWidowed participants had been bereaved for an average of\nTable 1.

M = mean; OAs = older adults; SD = standard deviation.\naIndependent samples t test and chi-square analyses revealed significant\ndifferences by marital status at p < .05 level.\nMeasures\nDaily stressors.--Daily stressors were measured each\nday using the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE;\nAlmeida, Wethington, & Kessler, 2002). In the full DISE\nmeasure, participants were asked whether they experienced\nany of seven types of stressors that day. Participants\nreported (a) whether they experienced an argument or\ndisagreement, (b) whether they avoided an argument or\ndisagreement (something happened that they could have\nargued about but they decided to let it pass), (c) whether\nthey experienced a work- or school-related stressor, (d)\nwhether they experienced a home-related stressor, (e)\nwhether they experienced discrimination, (f) whether they\nexperienced a network stressor (something that happened to\na close friend or relative), and (g) if anything else happened\nthat was stressful for them. Participants responded yes (1)\nor no (0). Based on previous research, the current study\nincorporated four of the seven stressors that are the most\ncommonly occurring types of stressors (Almeida, 2005)\nand that were believed to be relevant in the older adult\nwidowed population, including interpersonal stressors (i.e.,\narguments or avoided arguments), home stressors, and\nnetwork stressors. Network stressors refer to events that\ndo not directly involve the respondent that still turn out\nto be stressful for the respondent, such as learning about\na friend's illness. Work- or school-related stressors were\nexcluded because of the age of the current sample (aged\n65 and older), and discrimination and \"any other\" stressors\nwere excluded because of their low frequency of occurring\nDaily negative affect.--Daily negative affect was meas-\nured using an adapted inventory of emotions from the Non-\nSpecific Psychological Distress Scale and the Positive and\nNegative Affect Schedule (Kessler et al., 2002; Mroczek\nRespondents reported how often during the past day they\nexperienced 14 different negative emotions (e.g., worthless,\nhopeless, and restless or fidgety) using a 5-point scale rang-\ning from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Items\nfor negative affect were summed for each day with higher\nscores reflecting higher negative affect, and reliability for\nthe measure was high ( = .91).\nDaily physical symptoms.--Participants reported each day\nwhether they experienced any of 25 physical symptoms (e.g.,\npain and musculoskeletal symptoms, gastrointestinal, flu and\nrespiratory symptoms, and other physical symptoms). The\nnumber of symptoms were summed (range 0\u00ad25), and higher\nscores reflected a greater number of physical symptoms.\nCovariates.--Descriptive variables were assessed at\nbaseline and included the following covariates: age, edu-\ncation (percent with high school degree), race (White or\nnon-White), gender, and depressive symptoms. Time since\nwidowhood was included as a descriptive characteristic\namong the widowed sample, measured continuously as\nthe number of years since the spouse's death. Scores for\ndepressive symptoms ranged from 0 to 7. Specifically, par-\nticipants answered yes (1) or no (0) to the following seven\nitems: \"During 2 weeks in the past 12 months, when you\nfelt sad, blue, or depressed, did you, `lose interest in most\nthings,' `feel more tired out or low on energy than usual,'\n`lose your appetite,' `have more trouble falling asleep than\nusual,' `have a lot more trouble concentrating than usual,'\n`feel down on yourself, no good, or worthless,' or `think\na lot about death'\" (Kessler, Mickelson, Walters, Zhao, &\nHamilton, 2004). The number of years since widowhood\nwas used as a covariate in the main analyses, and the aver-\nage length of time since spousal death was imputed for mar-\nAnalytic Strategy\nStressor exposure.--First, correlations were conducted\nto check for multicollinearity between predictor variables.\nSecond, chi-square analyses were run to examine differ-\nences in daily stressor exposure (stressor day vs. nonstressor\nday) between married and widowed participants (Hypothesis\n1) for any stressors and for the specific stressor types (inter-\npersonal stressors, home stressors, and network stressors).\nStressor reactivity.--Second, reactivity models were\nestimatedusingmultilevelmodels(MLM)withPROCMixed\nin SAS Version 9.2. Because WP and BP predictors can\nprovide unique information about how individuals vary from\ntheir own average and how individuals vary from each other,\nboth WP and BP predictors of the two outcome variables\nwere estimated (Curran & Bauer, 2011). Prior to conducting\nanalyses, an unconditional model was run to calculate the\nintraclass correlation coefficient to determine the proportion\nof WP and BP variability in both negative affect and physical\nsymptoms. Results of the unconditional models suggest\nthat 67% of the variability in daily physical symptoms was\nbetween participants, and 33% of the variability was within\nparticipants. For daily negative affect, 46% of the variability\nwas BP and 54% of the variability was WP. MLM estimated\nthe WP and BP effects of interpersonal stressors, home\nstressors, and network stressors as predictors of negative\naffect (Model 1) and number of physical health symptoms\n(Model 2). For the WP analyses, the stressor variable was\ncoded as 1 for days when the participant reported a stressor\nand 0 for days when the person did not report a stressor, and\nthe variable was also person-mean centered for multilevel\nanalyses to examine how participants vary from their own\naverage (Hypothesis 2). For the BP analyses, we aggregated\nthe number of daily stressors over the course of 8 days for\neach person (Hypothesis 3).\nFinally, the interactions between stressors and marital sta-\ntus were also entered into each model to examine the extent\nto which marital status moderates emotional and physical\nreactivity to daily stressors (Hypothesis 4). For all analyses,\ncovariates were grand-mean centered. In both Models 1 and\n2, age, gender, and education were included as covariates\nbecause there were group differences in those covariates\nfor married and older adults. Depressive symptoms were\nincluded as a covariate because of the significant relation-\nship with the outcome variables. Race was not included in\nthe models because there were no significant group differ-\nences, and it was not significantly related to either outcome\nvariable. Day of data collection (i.e., time) was included\nas a covariate in all models because there was a significant\ndecrease in the reporting of physical symptoms and nega-\ntive affect over the course of the 8 days of data collection.\nResults\nExposure to Daily Stressors by Marital Status\nContrary to our hypothesis, married participants reported\nexperiencing \"any stressor\" on a greater percentage of days\nMarried participants also reported experiencing an interper-\nsonal stressor on a significantly greater percentage of days\nmarried and widowed participants reported experiencing home\nstressors on approximately 6% of days, and network stressors\nwere reported on approximately 5% of days, and there were no\ngroup differences (p > .05).\nEmotional Reactivity to Daily Stressors\nResults revealed older participants and those with higher\ndepressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to report\nhigher daily negative affect. Time was a significant predictor\nof negative affect, suggesting a decrease in negative affect\nover the course of the daily diary collection. Results of the\nmain analyses examining emotional reactivity to stressors\nsuggest that after controlling for other types of stressors,\ninterpersonal stressors were significantly predictive of\nhigher daily negative affect at both the WP and BP levels\n(Table 2). The WP effect suggests that on days when\nindividuals reported an interpersonal stressor, they reported\nhigher negative affect compared with days when they did not\nexperience an interpersonal stressor. The BP effect indicates\nthat individuals who on average have more interpersonal\nstressors report greater negative affect. In addition, increased\nWP and BP home-related stressors were significant predictors\nof increased negative affect, and higher WP network stressors\npredicted higher daily negative affect. These results suggest\nthatondayswhenapersonreportsahome-relatedstressorora\nnetwork stressor, they report higher negative affect compared\nwith a day when that person does not report a home-related\nor network stressor. Also, people who in general report more\nhome-related stressors also report higher negative affect.\nMarital status differences.--Marital status was a signifi-\ncant moderator of emotional reactivity to WP interpersonal\nstressors. The interaction effect is illustrated in Figure 1 and\nshows that on days when both widowed (Estimate = 0.05,\nTable 2.

Figure 1 also shows that on nonstressor\ndays, widowed participants report higher negative affect,\nand they are similar to married participants on interper-\nsonal stressor days resulting in less emotional reactivity\namong the widowed participants from a nonstressor day to\na stressor day; however, they report higher negative affect\noverall across nonstressor and stressor days. Marital sta-\ntus did not moderate emotional reactivity to other types of\ndaily stressors.\nPhysical Reactivity to Daily Stressors\nResults indicated that participants who were older,\nfemale, married, and had higher depressive symptoms were\nsignificantly more likely to report a greater number of daily\nphysical symptoms. Time was also a significant predictor,\nsuggesting a significant decrease in daily physical symp-\ntoms over the course of the week of daily diary collection.\nControlling for other types of stressors, increased home-\nrelated stressors were significant predictors of a greater\nnumber of daily physical symptoms at both the WP and BP\nlevels (Table 2). These results indicate that on a day when\na person reports a home-related stressor, they report more\nphysical symptoms than on a day when they do not report\na home-related stressor. In addition, people who in general\nreport more home-related stressors also report more physi-\ncal symptoms, on average. The BP effect of interpersonal\nstressors remained a significant predictor of a greater num-\nber of daily physical symptoms, suggesting that participants\nwho, on average, report more interpersonal stressors also\nreport a greater number of physical symptoms.\nMarital status differences.--Marital status was a signifi-\ncantmoderatorofWPphysicalreactivitytoWPhome-related\nstressors (Figure 2). In other words, widowed participants\nreport significant increases in physical symptoms on a day\np = .004), whereas married participants do not report\nincreased physical symptoms on days when they report a\nhome-related stressor compared with days when they do not\nreport a home-related stressor. Marital status did not moder-\nate physical reactivity to the other types of daily stressors.\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined widowed older adults'\nadjustment to daily life by examining whether daily stressor\nexposure and stressor reactivity varied between married and\nwidowed adults. The results of this study suggest that (a)\nmarried participants reported more stressors in general,\nand in particular, more interpersonal stressors compared\nwith widowed participants; (b) married and widowed par-\nticipants were both emotionally reactive to interpersonal\nstressors, but married participants were significantly more\nemotionally reactive; and (c) widowed participants were\nphysically reactive to home-related stressors. In support of\nthe daily stress process model and partially in support of our\nhypotheses, daily stressors were associated with increased\nnegative affect for all participants, and emotional and physi-\ncal reactivity was moderated by marital status. In support of\nour hypothesis, widowed participants were more physically\nreactive to home-related stressors. In contrast, our finding\nof greater emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors\namong married participants was unexpected.\nMarital Status and Daily Stressor Exposure\nContrary to our hypothesis, married participants reported\nsignificantly more stressors, in general, and specifically\nmarried participants reported more interpersonal stressors.\nWe also found that married participants experienced greater\nemotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors compared\nwith widowed participants. Constant interaction with a\nspouse may put married participants at increased risk of\nrepeated exposure to interpersonal tensions. In additional\npost hoc analyses examining the person with whom married\nFigure 1.Marital status as a moderator of emotional reactivity to within-\nperson interpersonal stress. *p < .05.\nFigure 2.Marital status as a moderator of physical reactivity to within-\nperson home-related stress. *p < .05.\nversus widowed participants experienced interpersonal\ntensions, married participants reported the majority of their\narguments involved their spouse (68%), whereas widowed\nparticipants reported the most arguments with \"friends\" or\n\"others.\" When spousal arguments are excluded from the\ncomparison of daily stressors between married and widowed\nparticipants, the significant differences in reports of \"any\nstressors\" and \"interpersonal stressors,\" as illustrated in\nFigure 3, were reduced to nonsignificant levels (p > .05),\nsuggesting that married older adults' greater stressor\nexposure, particularly to interpersonal tensions, is largely\nattributable to married older adults' increased opportunities\nto argue or disagree with their spouse.\nThere were no differences in exposure to network or\nhome stressors between married and widowed participants.\nHowever, because long-term widowed older adults may\nhave adjusted to daily life and are more likely to have more\nconfidence in daily living skills (Caserta & Lund, 2007),\nincorporation of widowed participants with a range of years\nsince widowhood may mask some variation in exposure to\ndaily stressors among the recent widowed older adults.\nMarital Status and Daily Stressor Reactivity\nUnexpectedly, married participants were more emo-\ntionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than widowed\nparticipants. However, widowed participants were not\nimmune to the negative effects of other daily stressful\nevents as evidenced by similarity in emotional reactivity\nto network and home-related stressors among married and\nwidowed older adults and higher negative affect overall\non noninterpersonal stressor and interpersonal stressor\ndays. These findings also support previous research that\nfinds some evidence of stability and resilience in the long\nterm for widowed older adults (Bonanno, Moskowitz,\nPapa, & Folkman, 2005). Married participants, however,\nmay be more emotionally reactive to interpersonal stress-\nors because for married adults, these events are likely to\ninclude a spouse. In an analysis of emotional reactivity to\nstressors as a function of marital status excluding spousal\narguments, the effects of increased emotional reactivity\nto interpersonal stressors among married participants are\nreduced to nonsignificant. These results suggest that both\nwidowed and married participants report emotional reac-\ntivity to interpersonal stressors, and that marital status dif-\nferences in emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors\nare driven by spousal relations. Previous research has indi-\ncated that marital relationships may be a particularly sali-\nent relationship for older adults as illustrated by a stronger\nrelationship between marital quality and psychological\nwell-being among older adults compared with younger\nIn support of our hypotheses, our findings also provide\nsome evidence of decreased resilience in the daily lives\nof widowed participants. The widowed participants in our\nstudy were more physically reactive to home-related stress-\nors. Our finding of greater physical reactivity among wid-\nowed older adults in a sample with a range of years since\nthe loss of their spouse suggests that they may be more\nphysically vulnerable to the changes in daily life during\nwidowhood even after many years of adjustment to the loss\nof a spouse. The dual process model of coping suggests\nthat restoration-oriented adjustment to widowhood may\ninclude coping with tasks of daily life (Caserta & Lund,\n2007) and that widowed older adults may better adjust to\nthese tasks over time. Our finding of similar exposure to\nFigure 3.Percentage of days of reported stressors by marital status. *Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences by marital status at significance\nhome-related stressors in widowed and married older adults\ndespite greater physical reactivity to home-related stressors\namong widowed participants suggests that the changes to\ndaily life that accompany the loss of a spouse may, in fact,\nhave lingering effects. The daily stress process model pos-\nits that risk factors may increase vulnerability to the nega-\ntive effects of stressors (Almeida, 2005), and our findings\nsuggest that widowhood may be a possible risk factor. The\ndifferences in reactivity by stressor types also support the\nimportance of identifying and examining different types of\nstressors, as suggested by the daily stress process model\n(Almeida, 2005). The greater physical reactivity to home-\nrelated stressors in the widowed population and greater\nemotional reactivity among married participants suggests\nthat while older adults, regardless of marital status may\nexperience reactivity, different daily routines, activities, and\ninteractions that may vary based on marital status may be a\nmechanism by which adults experience differential declines\nin health and well-being.\nThe finding of significant effects in both WP and BP\nanalyses illustrates the importance of examining both\nintraindividual and interindividual variations in the asso-\nciations between stressors and well-being. The intrain-\ndividual variations may produce temporary distress in\nday-to-day life as a result of daily events and particular\nexperiences, and the interindividual variations may result\nin negative outcomes over time associated with repeated\nstressor exposure. These results collectively suggest that\nthe experience of daily stressors is associated with both\nphysical and mental health among older adults, regardless\nof marital status. However, there may also be differences in\nthe extent and type of reactivity based on stressor type and\nmarital status of the participants that may help to increase\nour understanding of the mechanisms contributing to over-\nall health status.\nIn addition, the finding of greater physical symptoms\namong married compared with widowed participants was\nunexpected. Research has shown that with increasing age,\nindividuals are more likely to self-report their physical\nhealth more positively (Idler, 1993). Despite our controlling\nfor age in the analysis of marital status and the age range\nof both the widowed and married participants being more\nthan 65 years, there may be a potential confounding\nunmeasured variable associated with age, marital status,\nor physical symptoms that resulted in higher reporting\nof physical symptoms in the sample of married older\nadults. Furthermore, repeated exposure to stress may have\ncumulative effects over time (McEwen & Seeman, 1999),\nand the greater overall exposure to stressors may contribute\nto participants reporting more physical symptoms regardless\nof the type of day (stressor day vs. nonstressor day). Finally,\nmarried participants may report more physical symptoms\nbecause they are more accustomed to sharing their physical\nsymptoms with their spouse and are therefore more likely to\nreport symptoms as part of a study.\nStudy Limitations and Future Directions\nSome limitations in the current study and suggestions\nfor future research should be mentioned. First, the obser-\nvational measurement of reported stressors, daily negative\naffect, and daily physical symptoms does not examine\ncausal relationships that would further inform the cur-\nrent understanding of marital status and stressor reactiv-\nity. Future research examining reported daily affect and\ndaily physical symptoms before and after the experience\nof widowhood and before and after the experience of a\ndaily stressor is needed to better understand the tem-\nporal order and the role of stressors in daily health and\nwell-being. Previous research has examined reactivity to\nstressors using measures both before and after a stressor in\nother populations, including middle-aged and older adults\nwho are working versus retired (Wong & Almeida, 2012)\nand reactivity to daily stressors in younger versus older\nadults (Dijkstra, Charness, Yordon, & Fox, 2009). Similar\nresearch is needed among widowed older adults com-\npared with older adults of other marital statuses, includ-\ning married, single, and divorced older adults. Second, the\nsignificant decrease in the outcome variables over time\n(i.e., negative affect and physical symptoms) suggests a\npossible reporting bias where participants may be report-\ning (but not experiencing) fewer symptoms and emotions\nover repeated daily interviews. The current study included\ntime as a covariate to control for possible effects of this\ndrop-off in reports of negative affect and physical symp-\ntoms. Moreover, we attempted to control for group dif-\nferences in demographic characteristics by using them as\ncovariates in the analyses, but another method would be\nto match samples on these characteristics (Cook, Steiner,\n& Pohl, 2009), but the relatively small sample size in the\ncurrent study precluded such an approach. In addition, it is\nalso possible that because of the differences in covariates\nbetween the married and widowed participants, we were\nunable to account for differences in the slope, or the rela-\ntionship between stressors and outcomes (negative affect\nand physical symptoms) that may vary as a function of\nthe covariates. Larger sample sizes that are matched by\ndemographics or that include the covariates as moderators\nin the marital status by stressor interaction effect would\nprovide a better understanding of the role of demograph-\nics in the reactivity relationship for widowed versus mar-\nried participants. Similarly, because of the relatively small\nsample size, we did not examine gender differences in the\nproposed relationships between daily stressors and reac-\ntivity to stressors. Given the evidence of possible differ-\nences in exposure and reactivity to stressors as a function\nof gender (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001), future research with\nadequate sample sizes should examine potential gender\ndifferences. Third, the study only examined a few types\nof stressors believed to be associated with widowhood.\nFuture research should continue to examine daily stressors\nwithin the context of other factors that may be associated\nwith health and well-being in widowhood, such as the\npreference for help with daily activities or the levels of\nand desire for social contact. Fourth, there may be some\ngroup differences, which were not included in the current\nanalyses, such as marital satisfaction for the married par-\nticipants and for the widowed participants, time since the\ndeath of their spouse. For most widowed participants in\nthe current study, it has been 5\u00ad10 years since the death\nof a spouse, so findings might differ if research consid-\nered daily stressors among more recently widowed older\nadults. Also, in the current study, our interaction effects\nwere relatively small, suggesting further work is needed to\nprospectively examine daily stressor exposure and reactiv-\nity in a larger sample with multiple marital status groups to\nbetter determine the meaning of the results.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, although widowhood may not result\nin increased exposure to stressors, our findings provide\nsupport for both similarities and differences in stressor\nreactivity among married and widowed older adults.\nMarried older adults were more emotionally reactive to\ninterpersonal stressors, whereas widowed older adults\nwere more physically reactive to home-related stressors.\nAttention to the types of daily stressors that widowed older\nadults experience in daily life, and the potential physical\neffects of daily stressors during widowhood may help to\nalleviate some of the physical distress widowed older adults\nmay experience. In addition, further research is needed to\nbetter understand how intervention and supportive services\ntargeting physical reactivity in widowhood may help to\nalleviate potential long-term health risks associated with\nphysical responses to home-related stressors.\nFunding\nThis work was supported in part by funding from National Institutes\nSuccessful Midlife Development of the John D. and Catherine T.
