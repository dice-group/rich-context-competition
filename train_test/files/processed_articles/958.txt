    "reduced_content": "Patterns in Functioning Among Residents of\nan Affordable Assisted Living Housing Facility\nStephanie J. Fonda, PhD,1 Elizabeth C. Clipp, RN, PhD,2\nand George L. Maddox, PhD3\nPurpose: This is the second article reporting a project that\n(a) characterized the longitudinal functional patterns of\nresidents in an affordable, assisted living housing (ALH)\nmilieu for low-income people and (b) compared the ALH\nresidents' functional patterns with those for similarly low-\nincome, community-dwelling people. Design and Meth-\nods: Functioning was defined as the ability to perform ac-\ntivities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily\nliving and respondents' competing risks such as death\nand institutionalization. The comparison samples were\nselected from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and\nthe Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old\n(AHEAD) study. The analyses involved description of\nfunctional patterns and multinomial logit models to assess\nthe relative likelihood that study participants experienced\neach pattern of functioning and competing risks. Results:\nAbout 42.4% of the ALH residents had stable high func-\ntioning, 32.9% deteriorated (e.g., had increased im-\npairment, institutionalization, death), 3% improved in\nfunctioning, 6% exhibited moderate to severe impairment\nthroughout the study, and the remainder returned to the\ncommunity. Comparison of the ALH residents' functional\npatterns with those of the community-dwelling respon-\ndents indicated that the ALH residents' patterns generally\nwere similar and in some ways better, adjusting for so-\ncial\u00addemographic factors and health; for example, the\nALH residents were no different (statistically) in terms of\nimprovement, decline, and death, but they were more\nlikely to have stable high functioning. Implications: The\nresults suggest that the affordable ALH milieu enabled\nlow-income residents to maintain function or cope well\nwith functional decline. The comparison with community-\ndwelling participants provides evidence that the afford-\nable ALH milieu was comparatively beneficial.\nKey Words: Functional patterns, Long-term care,\nLongitudinal assessment, Transition\nA basic goal of much recent gerontological re-\nsearch is to delineate patterns of aging and to identify\nthe many individual and environmental factors that\nshape these patterns. This research has suggested\nthat there is considerable heterogeneity in patterns of\naging in all studied populations; for example, some\nolder adults experience periods of decline occasioned\nby episodes of partial recovery, whereas a majority\nexperience both sustained good health and stable dis-\nability until the end of life (Beckett et al., 1996;\nClipp, Pavalko, & Elder, 1992; Crimmins & Saito,\nVerbrugge, 1989). This research has also suggested\nthat some of the observed heterogeneity in patterns\nof aging is due to variation in residential milieu (e.g.,\nBengtson, Burgess, & Parrott, 1997; Hochschild,\nhousing (ALH)--defined generally as any group\nhome-like residential program with the capacity to\ncare for people with disabilities on an as-needed ba-\nsis (Citro & Hermanson, 1999; Kane & Wilson,\ncently has attracted attention as a potentially benefi-\ncial milieu for the physical and mental health of\nolder people, particularly those not in need of skilled\nnursing services (Fonda, Maddox, Clipp, & Rear-\nport for concluding that it is an especially beneficial\nmilieu, however, has accumulated slowly. Even re-\nsearch simply describing the functional patterns of\nALH residents has been limited. Thus, in this study,\nwe examined the functional patterns of residents of\nan affordable ALH facility and evaluated compara-\ntively whether the residents had beneficial outcomes.\nWe focused on a unique group of ALH residents,\nSupport for this article was provided through Continental National\nAmerican Insurance Company to Drs.

The ALH residents were unique because rela-\ntively few low-income elderly people live in this type\nThe growing desirability of ALH as a long-term\ncare option for older people is evident in the rate at\nwhich it has spread throughout the United States in\nthe past decade (Maddox, 2001). Although differing\nterms for ALH facilities make it difficult to obtain\nprecise estimates, it appears that ALH has grown at a\nrate of 15% to 20% in recent years, making it\namong the most rapidly growing type of age-friendly\nhousing in the United States (American Health Care\nAssociation [AHCA], 1998; Citro & Hermanson,\nsure regulations, were drafting regulations, or pro-\nvided Medicaid funding for ALH facilities in the\nstates were studying ALH as a possible long-term\ncare option. Additionally, about 1.15 million people\nnumber is likely to increase substantially as the Baby\nBoomers approach late life.\nThe idea that the ALH milieu could enhance well-\nbeing has its roots in ecological perspectives on ag-\ning, specifically the ecology of aging model (Lawton\n& Nahemow, 1973) and congruence models of per-\nson\u00adenvironment fit (Kahana, 1982). Lawton and\nNahemow, in their groundbreaking article, \"Ecology\nand the Aging Process,\" (1973), developed the con-\ncepts that inform prominent environmental theories\nof aging--individual competence and environmental\npress. They defined competence as an individual's\ncognitive and physical capacity to meet his or her\nown needs. It varies from individual to individual\nand within individuals as well, often as a function of\nfactors such as illness and advancing age. This varia-\ntion relates to the range of experiences to which\npeople can adapt comfortably. Environmental press\nrefers to the aspects of settings with which people\ncontinually interact that activate their needs and that\ncan be challenging, neutral, or supportive. Highly\ncompetent people fare better in environments that\nhave more press and that promote autonomy,\nwhereas less competent people fare better in environ-\nments with less press and more security (Lawton &\ncongruence model focuses on the fit between individ-\nuals' competencies and the demands of their environ-\nments. When fit between the characteristics of the en-\nvironment and the needs of older people is achieved,\npersonal well-being results (Kahana, 1982).\nThe model of selective optimization with compen-\nsation also emphasizes the contribution of environ-\nment to well-being. In this model, selection is the\nprocess whereby older people redefine their goals\nand modify their normal activities, goals, and envi-\nronments in response to changes (usually losses) in\ntheir personal abilities or resources (M. M. Baltes &\nexample, an older woman who relocates to a smaller\napartment because her spouse dies or because she\ncan no longer maintain a house engages in selection.\nThe choices people make when they redefine their\ngoals and choose modifications are probably shaped\nby their feelings of self-efficacy and agency (Bandura,\nolder people find new ways to maintain existing\ngoals (i.e., they do not modify their goals, as they do\nin the selection process) in response to changes in\ntheir abilities or resources. Older people who pur-\nchase housekeeping services when they can no longer\nkeep house themselves, for example, are compensat-\ning according to this model. Optimization refers to\nthe process by which older people relearn how to do\nthings for themselves and thereby regain functioning,\nhealth, autonomy, and so forth. Older people who\nbehave more autonomously after moving out of\noverprotective settings into environments designed to\nenhance independence have experienced optimiza-\ntion (M. M. Baltes & Carstensen, 1996). The ideali-\nzation of ALH seems to lie in its promise to provide\nreliably available, as-needed compensatory care for\npeople whose physical resources decline as well as\nopportunities for optimization among those who\nfind they have physical reserves on which to draw.\nA substantial literature focusing on earlier forms\nof congregate housing for older people suggests that\nthe expectations of environmental models of aging\nand the model of selective optimization with com-\npensation are largely realistic (e.g., Carp, 1966,\nrelevance to our study is the research showing the re-\nlationship in the context of noninstitutional milieus.\nFor example, in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental\ninvestigation of aged residents living in a congregate\ncility's residents reported better mental and physical\nhealth and were more active than sociodemographi-\ncally similar people living in the community. Simi-\nlarly, Lawton and Cohen (1974) compared the well-\nbeing of older adults who moved to five senior hous-\ning facilities with older adults who remained in place\nin the community. They found that the people who\nrelocated to the senior housing facilities had poorer\nphysical functioning relative to the community-\ndwelling people, but were better off in terms of\nmorale and satisfaction with their housing. Moos\nand Lemke (1994), in one of the most far-reaching\nstudies of person\u00adenvironment interaction to date,\nobserved the health and well-being of residents in\nover 262 nursing homes, residential care facili-\nties, congregate apartments, and veteran's facilities.\nThey found that residents of settings with socio-\neconomically homogeneous populations and high\nlevels of activity reported more involvement in on-\nsite, organized events, regardless of their level of\ndisability. In addition, residents who lived in facili-\nties with more prosthetic features (e.g., hall railings,\nnonskid floor surfaces, etc.) reported higher levels of\nindependence. Studies such as these suggest that mi-\nlieu is linked to maintenance or improvements in\nhealth and individuals' abilities to adapt to problems.\nFew studies have examined the relationship be-\ntween the newer ALH milieu and residents' well-being,\nhowever, and studies that have are inconclusive. For\nexample, Grayson, Lubin, and Van Whitlock (1995)\ncompared the depressive affect of people living in an\nALH facility with that of people residing in the com-\nmunity. They found that the depressive affect of the\nALH residents was, on average, worse than that of\nthe community residents. The cross-sectional design\nof that study makes it difficult to know whether the\naffective functioning of the people in the ALH setting\nhad improved or would improve over time and thus\nwas beneficial (or not) for residents. In another\nstudy, Pruchno and Rose (2000) compared the mor-\ntality rates, need for higher levels of care, cognitive\nstatus, depression, and subjective health of people in\nan ALH facility with people in a nursing home and\nfound that the ALH residents were no better off than\nthe nursing home residents were across all of the\nhealth outcomes they observed. They speculated\nthat, because the ALH facility and the nursing home\nthey observed were owned and operated by the same\nparent organization, their milieus might have been\ntoo similar to have meaningfully different effects on\nresident's well-being.\nThe study reported in this article was motivated\nby the scarcity of research on the functioning of ALH\nresidents per se. The first objective was to character-\nize the individual-level, longitudinal functional pat-\nterns of older residents in an affordable, defined\nALH milieu. Individual-level functional patterns are\nthe temporal changes that each person experienced\nin their ability to perform everyday self- and home-\ncare tasks. The categories used in our character-\nization of individual-level functioning (e.g., stable\nhigh functioning, stable low functioning, etc.) were\nadapted from a rubric developed by Clipp, Pavalko,\nand Elder (1992). The second objective was to com-\npare the ALH residents' functional patterns with\nthose for similarly low-income people who lived in\nthe community, thereby providing evidence for\nwhether the ALH residents had more or less benefi-\ncial outcomes. Given the tenets of environmental\nmodels of aging, the possibilities for optimization in\nthe ideal ALH facility, and research on earlier forms\nof congregate housing, one might expect the ALH\nresidents to have better outcomes than their commu-\nnity-dwelling counterparts. Or, given findings from\nthe few studies focusing on ALH residents per se as\nwell as explanations for why people move to congre-\ngate housing (e.g., in response to current or antici-\npated deterioration in health; Aday & Andersen,\nmight expect the ALH residents to have less benefi-\ncial outcomes. As a compromise, we posed a null\nhypothesis that the functional patterns of the ALH\nresidents would be no different from those of their\ncommunity-dwelling counterparts.\nMethods\nParticipants\nDefining an ALH Population.--The context for this\nresearch was a new, affordable ALH facility in North\nCarolina. This facility was affordable because people\nwere eligible for residency only if their incomes were\nfor the county, or about $16,000 per year, and rent\nassistance was available to most residents. The\nNorth Carolina Department of Health and Human\nResources differentiates between two types of ALH:\nrest homes (adult care and family care) and multi-\nunit housing with services (MUHS). Rest homes\nserve people who require at least some care in a\nstructured, institutionalized, moderately staffed envi-\nronment. Residents usually have one private room\nthat they cannot lock, and they share bathrooms and\nkitchens. On-site, licensed staff provide the rest\nhome residents with housekeeping services and per-\nsonal care. MUHS, by contrast, provides an environ-\nment that is minimally restrictive and maximizes au-\ntonomy. Residents have private, lockable living space\nwith their own kitchens and bathrooms, and they re-\nceive housekeeping services and personal care on an\nas-needed basis through off-site agencies. The ALH\nfacility observed in this project is an example of the\nMUHS model.\nPreliminary to characterizing the individual-level,\nlongitudinal functional patterns of the ALH resi-\ndents, we confirmed that this ALH facility was indeed\nsupportive while also facilitating resident autonomy.\nWe did so using the Multiphasic Environmental As-\nsessment Procedure, which Moos and Lemke (1992,\n1994) designed and used to characterize hundreds of\ncongregate care facilities, nursing homes, and apart-\nments for older people. We found that the ALH facil-\nity we studied had more features facilitating resident\nautonomy, such as prosthetic aids and availability of\npersonal space, than the average apartment Moos\nand Lemke observed. It had fewer features providing\nsocial and cognitive support, such as social\u00adrecre-\national aids, orientation aids, safety features, and\nstaff oversight, than did the average nursing home\nMoos and Lemke observed. There was more cohe-\nsion among the residents and interaction between the\nstaff and residents at the ALH facility we studied\nthan in the average age-segregated apartment Moos\nand Lemke studied, but less cohesion in the ALH fa-\ncility than in the average congregate care facility. In\nshort, the ALH facility we studied appears to provide\na reasonably supportive social environment.\nThis article reports on the first cohort of older res-\nidents who moved into the ALH facility when it\ntained information about each resident's functioning\nusing the Duke Service Outcome Screen (SOS),\nwhich is a short form of the Older Americans Re-\nsources and Services Multidimensional Functional\nAssessment Questionnaire (Fillenbaum, 1988; Fillen-\nbaum, Dellinger, Maddox, & Pfeiffer, 1978). The\nSOS asks about social demographics, general health\nstatus, functional status, social support, housing ade-\nquacy, economic status, and emotional well-being.\nThe questions about functioning in the SOS profile\nwere designed to be consistent with those included in\npopulation-based surveys of older people, such as the\nNational Long Term Care Survey. This article pre-\nsents SOS information obtained from ALH residents\nduring three observations: before they moved into\nthe facility, after 1 year of residency, and after 2\nyears of residency.\nComparison Samples.--We faced several challenges\nwhen selecting an appropriate benchmark for the\nALH residents. First, because people with lower in-\ncomes tend to experience worse health outcomes\nthan people with higher incomes do (e.g., Bunker,\nimportant that the comparison sample or samples be\nsimilarly low income. Second, the ALH residents\nwere 50 years of age or older, so it was necessary\nthat the comparison sample or samples were as well.\nThird, we required at least two observations of the\ncomparison sample or samples, 2 years apart, so\nthat we could delineate their functional patterns\nover the same span of time that the ALH residents\nwere observed. Finally, it was necessary that evalua-\ntions of the comparison samples cover the same do-\nmains covered in the SOS profile, especially func-\ntional status. The Duke Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) ini-\ntially seemed an obvious choice for a comparison\nsample because it sampled older people residing in\nNorth Carolina; however, the Duke EPESE used a\ndifferent schedule for including the full set of ques-\ntions about functioning and it sampled an older co-\nhort (i.e., people aged 65 and older at baseline). In-\nstead, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and\nthe Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old\n(AHEAD) study together met most of our selective\ncriteria.\nThe HRS and AHEAD study are nationally repre-\nsentative, prospective studies of community-dwell-\ning middle-aged and older Americans, designed to\ninvestigate their health transitions and how these\ntransitions affect finances, formal and informal sup-\nport, family dynamics, and health care. They sur-\nveyed several, nonoverlapping cohorts enrolled at\ndifferent time points: (a) the HRS cohort of people\nyears), studied since 1992; and (b) the AHEAD co-\nand the AHEAD study reinterviewed respondents in\nquestions in these surveys changed between baseline\nand the first follow-up interview, making longitudi-\nnal analysis with those particular interviews prob-\nof the AHEAD study. The availability of only two\ndata points over the 2-year intervals for the HRS\nand AHEAD study meant that we could observe\nonly transitions (not nonlinear trajectories) for these\nrespondents.\nOur comparison samples obtained from the HRS\nand AHEAD consisted of Caucasian and African\nAmerican respondents who completed the questions\nabout their functional status and had household in-\ncomes of $16,000 per year or less (standardized to\n1993 levels to be consistent with the ALH residents).\nWe excluded the small number of survey respondents\nwho were living in senior housing, retirement com-\nmunities, and other types of noninstitutional housing\nthat provided services. This yielded samples of 1,759\nHRS respondents and 2,258 AHEAD respondents.\nMeasures\nThe analyses reported here measured functional\npatterns in terms of the participants' self-reported\nabilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)\nand instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).\nADL indicators common to the interviews for the\nALH residents, the HRS respondents, and the\nAHEAD respondents included bathing, transferring\nin and out of bed, dressing, eating, using the bath-\nroom, and walking. IADL indicators included pre-\nparing meals, taking medications, managing money,\nusing the telephone, and shopping for groceries. Sim-\nilar to other examinations of functional patterns\n(Anderson et al., 1998; Manton, Corder, & Stallard,\n1997), we categorized individuals' functional abili-\nties as independent (i.e., with no IADL and ADL\ndifficulties), as IADL disabled only, or as ADL dis-\nabled. For follow-up observations, we had measures\nindicating whether the participants relocated to\nmore care-intensive milieus (e.g., rest homes, nursing\nhomes), died, or left the study for other reasons. For\nthe ALH residents, these other reasons included relo-\ncation to the community because they needed more\ncare from family caregivers or they wanted to live\nalone. ALH staff did not always know or note which\nreason applied. For the community respondents, the\nother reasons for leaving the study included refusal\nor nonresponse.\nSeveral social\u00addemographic and health variables\nwere incorporated into this study as well. These were\nage, race (Caucasian or African American), gender,\nhousehold income, number of life-threatening health\nconditions that the participants had (i.e., cancer,\nstroke, heart problems, and diabetes), and number of\ndebilitating health conditions that the participants\nhad (i.e., arthritis, high blood pressure, hearing prob-\nlems, and vision problems).\nAnalyses\nThe analysis consisted of two parts. The first was\nprimarily descriptive, involving application of Clipp\nand associates' (1992) scheme for characterizing in-\ndividual-level, longitudinal patterns in functional sta-\ntus. Their scheme included constant good health, de-\ncline at the end of life, decline and recovery, constant\npoor health, and linear decline. Similarly, our catego-\nries included stable high functioning, stable low\nfunctioning, decline, improvement, and competing\nrisks such as institutionalization. We identified the\nrates at which patterns occurred among the ALH res-\nidents using information obtained from three data\npoints: before they moved into the facility (baseline),\nafter 1 year of residency (Wave 2), and after 2 years\nof residency (Wave 3). Inasmuch as the categories re-\nfer to strictly linear patterns, they apply to patterns\ndefined by two data points as well.\nA quasi-experimental approach characterized the\nsecond part of the analysis (Campbell & Stanley,\n1963). We compared the rates at which each pattern\nof functioning occurred for each group, using the\nbaseline and Wave 3 observations for the ALH resi-\ndents and the baseline and Wave 2 observations for\nthe community respondents. We then investigated\nthe relative likelihood that the ALH residents and\ncommunity respondents experienced each functional\npattern adjusting for salient social\u00addemographic and\nhealth factors. For this, the three groups were\ncombined into a single data set (N  4109) and their\nfunctional patterns regressed on variables denoting\nstudy membership (i.e., ALH, HRS, or AHEAD),\nage, gender, race, income, debilitating health condi-\ntions, and life-threatening health conditions. We esti-\nmated a multinomial logit model, using Version 7 of\nthe STATA statistical software (Stata Corporation,\nBecause of the disparity in sample sizes across the\nstudy groups, we were concerned that the effects of\nmembership in the HRS or AHEAD groups would\noverwhelm any effects of membership in the ALH\ngroup when we estimated the multinomial logit\nmodel. To explore this issue, we created 50 data sets\nconsisting of all the ALH residents and 5% each of\nthe HRS and AHEAD respondents. The HRS and\nAHEAD respondents were selected at random and\nwith replacement for each data set. This strategy pro-\nduced reasonably similar sample sizes across the\nstudy groups. Then we regressed the ALH residents'\nand community respondents' functional patterns on\nage, gender, race, health, and dummy variables indi-\ncating study membership using each of the 50 data\nsets (yielding 50 repetitions) and averaged the re-\nsults. This approach was similar to bootstrap sam-\npling and estimation. In brief, the results using the 50\nsmaller samples were very similar to those obtained\nusing a single data set consisting of data from all of\nthe respondents, eliminating concerns about the dis-\nparity in sample sizes. Thus we report the results\nfrom the first multinomial logit model described\nabove, using the full, original samples.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the ALH residents and the\ncommunity-dwelling respondents are reported in Ta-\nble 1. The average age of the ALH residents was 71\nyears, about 10 years greater than the average age of\nthe HRS respondents and 10 years less than the aver-\nage age of the AHEAD respondents. More than half\nof the participants in all three studies were women.\nAlthough more than half of the participants in all\nthree studies were Caucasian, the proportion of Afri-\ncan Americans in the ALH facility was considerably\nlarger than the proportion in either community sam-\nple. As intended, average household income across\nthe three groups was roughly similar (ranging from\nview, the ALH residents had 1.02 debilitating condi-\ntions on average, which is less than that reported by\nboth the HRS and AHEAD respondents. All three\ngroups had less than one life-threatening health con-\ndition on average, but the HRS respondents ap-\npeared to be healthiest in this respect.\nExamination of the ALH residents' unadjusted\nfunctional status when they entered the ALH milieu,\nafter 1 year of residency, and after 2 years of resi-\ndency revealed that the most common pattern was\nstable high functioning (see Table 2). That is, 42.4%\nof the residents reported that they were independent\nTable 1.

Decline also was com-\nmon, with 9.9% reporting loss of independence after\nbaseline and 1.1% with IADL difficulties at baseline\nprogressing to loss of ADL functioning. Relocation\nto more care-intensive milieus and death also consti-\ntuted decline for this group, but warranted separate\nmention; that is, 14.1% of the ALH residents relo-\ncated to more care-intensive milieus and 6.5% of the\nresidents died. Improvement in functioning among\nresidents who remained in the facility accounted for\na small, but notable percentage of the trends (4.4%).\nHalf of these participants improved in IADL func-\ntioning between baseline and the year-1 observa-\ntion and then reverted to being IADL disabled by\nthe year-2 observation. Improvement probably also\ncharacterized the experiences of some residents who\nreturned to live in the community (see the \"Other\"\ncolumn in Table 2), but the ALH staff did not always\nknow the reason for departure of all residents in this\ncategory so we cannot comment on the percentage of\nresidents to which this pattern applied. About 5.4%\nof the residents had stable low functioning, reporting\nIADL and/or ADL difficulties for the full 2 years of\nthe study, without decline or improvement.\nComparison of the ALH residents' unadjusted\nfunctional patterns with those found for their com-\nmunity-dwelling counterparts initially suggested that\nthey fared slightly worse than the HRS respondents\nbut better than the AHEAD respondents. (In the in-\nterest of brevity, the table used to derive the percent-\nage of HRS and AHEAD respondents with each pat-\ntern is not shown here but is available from the\nauthors on request.) Compared with HRS respon-\ndents, about 10.9% fewer of the ALH residents had\nstable high functioning, 5.3% fewer improved, 2.4%\nfewer died, and 14.0% more moved into institu-\ntional milieus during the 2-year period analyzed in\nthis study (see Figure 1). Compared with AHEAD re-\nspondents, about 10.3% more of the ALH residents\nhad stable high functioning, 4.9% fewer declined in\nfunctioning, and about 9.3% fewer died. In only one\nrespect did the ALH residents fare worse than the\nAHEAD respondents--about 14.0% more ALH resi-\ndents than AHEAD respondents moved into institu-\nALH residents had stable low functioning than did\nHRS and AHEAD respondents; this is interesting be-\ncause, given the prosthetic aids that were part of the\nphysical setting of the ALH facility, one might expect\nit to attract more people with stable low functioning.\nThe multinomial logit model in which the func-\ntional patterns were regressed on important risk fac-\ntors and study variables denoting study membership\n(i.e., ALH, HRS, or AHEAD) provided a more com-\nplete view of the differences suggested by the unad-\nTable 2.

The results indi-\ncated that the average HRS and AHEAD respondent\nwas no more or less likely to have improved, de-\nclined, or died, adjusting for age, gender, race, in-\ncome, debilitating health conditions, and life-threat-\nening health conditions. This finding is consistent\nwith our null hypothesis. The average HRS and\nAHEAD respondent, however, was significantly less\nlikely to have moved to an institutional setting and\nto have dropped from the study for other reasons.\nThe most striking finding was that the average HRS\nand AHEAD respondent was more likely to have ex-\nperienced stable low functioning than the average\nALH resident was (3.6 and 2.7 times more likely, re-\nspectively). Another way of stating this result is that\nthe average community-dwelling respondent was less\nlikely to have had stable high functioning than was\nthe average resident in ALH (.28 and .37 times less\nlikely, respectively). This countered our null hypoth-\nesis but was consistent with the theoretical expecta-\ntions of environmental models of aging and the con-\nstruct of selective optimization with compensation.\nDiscussion\nGerontologists have long argued for the role of\nsupportive housing milieus in preserving health and\neffective functioning in later life. Recently many have\npointed to ALH as a particularly beneficial milieu for\nolder people potentially in need of care, but to date\nthere are few studies of actual functioning to support\nthis belief. This article characterizes the functional\npatterns of older residents over the first 2 years in an\naffordable ALH facility. By affordable, we mean that\nthe facility was for low-income people. Functioning\nwas measured in terms of participants' self-reported\nFigure 1.

To determine how well\nthe ALH residents fared, this article compared their\nfunctional patterns with those for similarly low-\nincome respondents of two community panel stud-\nies--the HRS and AHEAD study.\nSeveral limitations of this study require comment\nbefore we summarize the results. First, because the\nALH residents we observed were from lower socio-\neconomic backgrounds and were cognitively intact\nwhen they moved into the facility, the generality of\nour results are obviously limited. The reason is that\npeople with lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend\nto experience worse health than do people with\nhigher SES (e.g., Bunker, Gomby, & Kehrer, 1989;\n& Collins, 1995). Thus we do not know what our\nfindings imply about the functional patterns of ALH\nresidents with higher SES. This is a drawback be-\ncause ALH is a much more common option for\nhigher SES people than it is for lower SES people.\nMoreover, the functional patterns of people with\ndiminished cognitive abilities are probably worse\nthan those of their higher functioning counterparts\nas well (Fitzgerald, Smith, Martin, Freedman, &\nknow what the findings of this study imply about the\nfunctional patterns of more cognitively impaired\npeople. Generalization to all ALH residents, how-\never, was not a chief goal of this analysis; rather, we\nwanted to provide a rare look at the functional pat-\nterns of this special population. To our knowledge\nthis is the first examination of functional patterns of\nlow-income elderly people in ALH.\nSecond, although the two benchmark surveys rep-\nresent community-dwelling older Americans aged 51\nto 61 years and 70 years or older, they do not pro-\nvide perfect comparison or control groups for the\nALH residents we studied. One reason is that, until\nthe studies merged in 1998, they did not include the\nOur bootstrapping test partially dealt with the non-\nrandom inclusion of certain age groups, however,\nand still yielded results consistent with those re-\nported in Table 3. In addition, we know little about\nthe survey respondents' milieus. It is possible that the\npeople who lived in the community were less predis-\nposed toward, or in need of, ALH or other types of\nlong-term care settings when they were sampled (see\nAndersen & Newman, 1973). What this study re-\nveals then, is a sense of how the functional patterns\nof the ALH residents living in a defined milieu com-\npared with the functional patterns of community-\ndwelling people in average, undefined environments.\nThis average was affected by variation in the physical\nsupports to which residents had access, the safety of\ntheir settings, other people living in their settings,\ntheir access to services, and so forth. Obtaining in-\nformation about community-dwelling older adults,\ntheir settings, characterizing their functional pat-\nterns, and then comparing their functional patterns\nto those for ALH residents represent an area of fur-\nther study. This information would facilitate for-\nmal, systematic tests of the person\u00adenvironment\nrelationship.\nThird, it is difficult to know how to interpret the\npatterns we observed for the ALH residents. Are the\npatterns unique to these ALH residents or did resi-\ndence in the ALH really have a favorable effect? Am-\nbiguity regarding our findings is due to the homoge-\nneity of the ALH residents at baseline. That is, 73%\nwere independent and only 10% had ADL limita-\ntions (Table 2). Given the potential for ceiling and\nfloor effects in our dependent variable (i.e., respon-\ndents with functional limitations had more opportu-\nnity to improve than did those with none and vice\nversa) and the observation that most people who are\nindependent tend to remain so over time (Crimmins\nchange can we expect to see? Still, there was suffi-\ncient variability in the ALH residents' functional pat-\nterns over time to suggest that they were more het-\nerogeneous at baseline than indicated by the baseline\ndata. Also, there were sufficient differences between\nthe ALH residents and community respondents, de-\nspite their similarities with respect to baseline health\nand sociodemographics, to suggest reasonable causal\ninferences about the relationship of milieu to the\nALH residents' functional trends.\nTurning to our initial characterization of the ALH\nresidents' functional patterns, we documented that\nmost of the residents experienced favorable out-\ncomes of some sort. These favorable outcomes in-\ncluded stable high functioning, improvements in\nIADL and ADL functioning, and stable low function-\ning. We counted residents who experienced stable\nlow functioning among those who have favorable\noutcomes because we believe their continued tenure\nin the facility suggests that the ALH milieu enabled\nthis at-risk group to live independently (possibly\nthrough compensation) and to avoid further deterio-\nration in functioning and institutionalization. To-\ngether, stable high functioning (by far the most com-\nmon pattern of the three), improvement, and stable\nlow functioning accounted for at least 52% of the\nALH residents' experiences. We suspect that this per-\ncentage would have been higher if there were more\ninformation available about the residents who re-\nturned to the community during the study. The other\nfunctional patterns of the ALH residents included de-\ncline in functioning, relocation to more care-inten-\nsive milieus, and death. These patterns together ac-\ncounted for the remainder of the ALH residents'\nexperiences. Their high prevalence was not particu-\nlarly surprising; people at risk of worsening health\ntend to move into milieus where they can live more\ncomfortably with those problems and/or receive care\n(Andersen & Newman, 1973; Wolinsky & Johnson,\n1991). Thus many of the ALH residents probably\nwere at elevated risk from the outset and the preva-\nlence of these patterns captured some of that. We\nknow from the prevalence of improvement and sta-\nble low functioning, however, that in spite of being\nat risk of worsening health, optimization was possible.\nAlthough it was important to characterize the\nfunctional patterns of the ALH population, it was\nunclear, without benchmarks, what those patterns\nindicated about the comparative well-being of the\nALH residents. One of the most important contribu-\ntions of this study is its juxtaposition of the ALH res-\nidents' patterns with those identified among commu-\nnity-dwelling people. The (adjusted) results indicate\nthat the ALH residents were no more or less likely to\nhave experienced improvement, decline, and death\nthan were their community-dwelling counterparts.\nThis was consistent with our null hypothesis and can\nbe considered a comparatively beneficial outcome as-\nsuming the ALH residents were indeed at higher risk\nfrom the outset. But contrary to the null hypothesis,\nthe ALH residents fared better than their commu-\nnity-dwelling counterparts in some ways; specifi-\ncally, the ALH residents were more likely than the\ncommunity respondents to have maintained high\nfunctioning during the 2-year interval of observation.\nThis finding was consistent with environmental\nmodels of aging (e.g., Kahana, 1982; Lawton & Na-\nous studies of earlier congregate housing for older\nadults and resident well-being (e.g., Carp, 1966,\nAn important question underlying this study is\nwhether or not the ALH model should be generalized\nto other older people seeking congregate housing\nwith services. The implicit criterion for making this\ndetermination is whether the ALH milieu can be\nshown to have some positive effect on the well-being\nof its residents, including, among many components,\nphysical functioning. Given the rapid expansion of\nALH in the past decade (AHCA, 1998; Citro & Her-\nthat the ALH model already has been generalized\nwithout evidence demonstrating its positive effects.\nTherefore the utility of results such as those reported\nhere lies in their ability to show for whom and under\nwhat circumstances the ALH model should be gener-\nalized. This study suggests that the ALH model holds\nutility for low-income older adults by helping them\nmaintain stable high functioning at rates that reflect\nat least two normative samples of older, community-\nliving people, by providing opportunities for im-\nprovement and by helping functionally impaired per-\nsons attain the goal of independent living through\nthe provision of as-needed compensatory care.\nReferences\nAday, L.
