Return\ndistribution asymmetry is examined with higher order movements. Skewness in commodity future's return is largely\ninsignificant, whereas kurtosis is highly significant for both stock and commodity future contracts. Correlation analysis is\ndone with Pearson's and Kendall's tau measures. Commodities provide significant diversification benefits when added in a\nportfolio of stocks. Compared with stocks, commodity future's returns show stronger correlation with unexpected inflation.\nThe volatility is measured through Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity\n(GJR-GARCH) model and reflects that commodities have inverted asymmetric behavior, that is, more impact from the\nupward shocks compared with downward. Stocks have asymmetric volatility, that is, more impact from negative shocks\ncompared with positive. Gold has highest inverted asymmetric volatility. Tail dependence, measured through Student's t\ncopula, shows no combined downside movement. In conclusion, commodity investments provide diversification and inflation\nprotection.\n",

Considering this rational behavior of investors, founda-\ntions for the mean\u00advariance optimization framework and\nportfolio diversification were laid in traditional finance the-\nory that gave birth to a trend marked by the development of\ndifferent risk management models, including Capital Asset\nPricing Model (CAPM), Fama-French, and Poster Stemberg\nto facilitate investors' decision making and to explore alter-\nnatives such as mutual fund, real estate, and commodities.\nCommodity investments greatly drew widespread attention\nin periods of high financial markets' volatility during the\n19th century by exhibiting their potential for portfolio diver-\nsification and inflation protection. Later, commodity futures\ncontracts were introduced in 1922 when U.S. Congress\nenacted the Grain FutureAct to regulate the pricing seasonal-\nity in commodity investments. There are several factors\nwhich differentiate price variations in commodities from\nstock investments such as state of economy, weather condi-\ntions, government policies, and facilities of transportation\nand storage. Commodity futures exchange of Pakistan which\nstage with appreciable future growth prospects. Being a new\ninvestment avenue, commodity's investments are perceived\nto have equity such as returns, diversification, and inflation\nhedging potential based on previous studies in developed\neconomies. There is a discernible distinction between the\ndynamics of developed and developing economies (Elder &\nTraditional investments have witnessed many periods of\nfinancial turmoil, for example, global financial crisis of\n2008, which motivated investors to take refuge in alternative\ninvestments including commodities. Since the past one\ndecade, commodities have shown remarkable performance\nmaking investors' preferences shift toward commodity's\ninvestments. Commodities (metal, energy, and agriculture)\nhave long-standing history from consumption and invest-\nment perspective as a store of value or to mitigate the risk.\nCommodities that fall in real assets'domain have unique tan-\ngible features, intrinsic value (roll, convenience, and income\nyield), and can be used in the production process. However,\nreal assets can be segregated into two broad categories: dura-\nble assets that are used in the wealth production process, for\nexample, transport vehicles; and non-durable assets that are\n1COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan\n2Burj Bank Limited, Karachi, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nSyed Jawad Hussain Shahzad, Lecturer, Department of Management\nSciences, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, VC, Islamabad\nEmail: jawad.kazmi5@gmail.com\nCommodities and Stock Investment: A\nMultivariate Analysis\nSyed Jawad Hussain Shahzad1, Naveed Raza1, and Aneese\nHayat Awan2\n Keywords\nasymmetric volatility, commodity futures contract, GJR-GARCH, Student's t copula\n2 SAGE Open\nconsumed in the wealth production process, for example,\nfuel for transport vehicle. Commodity prices depend on\nshort-term supply and demand factors, for example, high\ndemand for wheat to fulfill current demand of bread.\nIncreasing prices of physical commodities are a source of\ninflation and thus show correlation with inflation (Bodie,\ncomprises wages of laborer, cost of capital and raw material.\nFor a given price of production process, if short-term cost of\nlabor is considered constant and cost of raw material\nincreases, the cost of capital must decrease. Similarly, if the\ncost of capital increases, the cost of raw material must fall.\nThus, commodity prices and capital asset prices are nega-\ntively correlated (Daskalaki & Skiadopoulos, 2011; Fuertes,\nHowever, the correlation between commodities and stocks is\ntime-dependent and highly volatile (Creti, Jo\u00ebts, & Mignon,\nEvent risk profile of commodities is different not only\nfrom each other but also from stock and bonds. Financial\nassets are claims on real assets or cash flows derived from\nutilizing the real assets. Nature of these two asset classes\n(stocks and commodities) is different and the way these are\naffected by economic variables also varies across the catego-\nries (Fuertes et al., 2010). When the business cycle is at its\npeak, commodity prices tend to be high, reflecting higher\ndemand for raw material. This booming business activity\ncauses interest rates to be high and expectations for growth\nto slow down causing financial assets to perform poor.\nCommodities are affected by short-term economic fluctua-\ntions, whereas financial assets are affected by long-term\ngrowth expectations. Stocks and commodities being exposed\nto different factors and events also exhibit different return\ndistributions (Kat & Oomen, 2006). Both investments are\nexposed to extreme shocks reflecting the outlier behavior in\nthe tail where there are more chances of returns falling close\nto mean and also more chances for returns to be falling far\nfrom the mean. Both stocks and commodity investments\nhave a non-linear pattern in returns distributions, which a\nstandard correlation cannot properly account for, especially,\nwhen both these are tail-dependent. This tail dependence\n(Delatte & Lopez, 2013) can have dangerous effects from the\nportfolio perspective as there are chances that both these\ninvestments move parallel creating losses (B\u00f6rger, Cartea,\nOwing to the complexities in risk\u00adreturn profiles of stocks\nand commodities highlighted in above discussion, this study\nfocuses on the asymmetric behavior of returns, strength of\nrelationships, asymmetric volatility and tail dependence of\nstocks and commodities in a portfolio context. Rest of the\nstudy is organized as follows. Section \"Data and Method\"\npresents the data and methodological aspects. Section\n\"Results and Analysis\" discusses result and analysis, and\nSection \"Conclusion\" concludes the study.\nData and Method\nMonthly price series of 25 stocks (source: http://www.kse.\ncom.pk/), 3 commodities (in Pakistani rupee [PKR] and U.S.\n10 commodity future contracts (source: http://www.pmex.\nsample for analysis. Details of secondary data with specifica-\ntion are shown in Appendix A. Return1 is calculated as\nr P P\nt t t\n= -\nln( / )\n1 , where Pt denotes price at time t.\nWith the premise that commodity prices often reflect high\nupward spike, one may start feeling that commodity spot and\nfutures returns are positively skewed. However, stocks have\nalso reported spike behavior and investors. The following\nthree skewness (Kat & Oomen, 2006) measures are used in\nthis study:\nSkew-I =\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nT\nR\nt\nT\nt\n\u00b5\n\n\n\n,\nSkew-II =\n+ -\n-\n  \n \n,\nSkew-III =\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nT\nP\nt\nt\nT\nIf return distribution tails become fatter, there is more likeli-\nhood of loss. Commodities are popular for having frequent\nand aggressive price roller coaster, therefore they may have\nhigh excess kurtosis (EK). EK reflects the probability of\nintense outcome (Daskalaki & Skiadopoulos, 2011; Roache\napplied for the analysis are as under:\nKurt-I =\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n=\n\nT\nR\nt\nT\nt\n\u00b5\n\n\n\n,\nKurt-II =\n- + -\n-\n-\n. . . . . ,\nKurt-III =\n-\n-\n-\n. . . ,\nwhere \u00b5\n^ = T Rt\nt\n- \n= -\n- \nT Rt\nt\n( , and P\n denotes\n \u00ad percentile of return. Skew-I is known to be sensitive to\noutliers, whereas Skew-II and Skew-III are more robust\n(Kim & White, 2004). Skew-I is unbound, whereas Skew-II\nand Skew-III are bounded between +1 and -1. Similar condi-\ntion holds for kurtosis measures.\nThe association of commodities and stocks' returns with\neach other and with unexpected inflation is measured with\nShehzad et al. 3\nPearson's (r) and Kendall's tau () measures. Later, non-\nparametric measure is used keeping in view the asymmetric\nnature of return distribution. Following are the equations for\nboth measures:\nr\nx x y y\nx x y y\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\n=\n-\n( ) -\n( )\n-\n( ) -\n( )\n=\n= =\n\n \n,\n =\n( )-\n(\nnumber of concordant pairs\nnumber of discordant pairs)\n)\n-\n( )\nn n\n.\nVolatility analysis of commodities return is done using\nminimum, maximum, 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, annualized\nstandard deviation ( c ), ratio of commodity standard devia-\ntion to 25 stocks ( RS ) and ratio of commodity standard\ndeviation to Index ( RI ).\nThe asymmetric volatility is a market phenomenon and\nindicates dependence of volatility on up and down market\nmovements. This phenomenon may have been attributed by\nthe volatility feedback, effects of leverage, and psychologi-\ncal attributes that are related with risk/return level in a par-\nticular market. It has been extensively examined and\nconfirmed; however, drivers of this phenomenon lack con-\nsensus. The Generalized Autore-gressive Conditional\nHeteroskedasticity (GJR-GARCH) model by Glosten et al.\n(1993) is used to examine the asymmetric (different impact\nof good and bad news) volatility of all sample returns. The\nuse of model is motivated by the notion that basic situation is\nto be studied first before moving into complexities.\nAsymmetry of volatility along with the above measures will\nhelp frame a better picture for investment in commodity spot\nand futures. The specification of the conditional variance\nequation is given by\nh u u d h\nt t t t t\n= + + +\n- - - -\n   \nwhere dt takes the value of 1 for ut < 0, and 0 otherwise.\nGood news has an impact of , whereas bad news has an\nimpact of  \n+ . A  = 0 indicates symmetry, whereas  <or>\n0 indicates asymmetric behavior.\nTail dependence of return data is analyzed using Student's\nt copula. The Student's t copula can be written as follows:\nC u u u t t u t u t u\nm v v v v m\n, ,... , ,..., ,\n( )= ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n\n- - -\n,\nwhere tv\n, is the multivariate Student's t distribution with\na correlation matrix  with v degrees of freedom. Matlab\ncode to graph copula is provided in Appendix B.\nResults and Analysis\nSkewness pattern for stocks and commodities requires spe-\ncial attention when adding in the portfolio. If mean and vari-\nance of portfolio are constant, adding an investment\n(commodity or stock) with positive skewness will shift\nmedian return below the mean. This clustering of returns on\nthe negative side creates undesirable results for the investors\nwhen market conditions are stable. Portfolio with positively\nskewed return will underperform as compared with no or\nnegative skewness. Whereas when market conditions remain\nvolatile, returns of two portfolios will strike a balance.\nIntuitively, skewness measures whether there is an increased\nprobability of a pleasant (positive skewness) or nasty (nega-\ntive skewness) surprise. Of course, ceteris paribus, people\nwill prefer positive over negative skewness (Kat & Oomen,\n2006). Detailed comparison of skewness and kurtosis mea-\nsures over long and short time horizon is provided in Table 1.\nSpot commodity's returns have significant negative skew-\nness. However, the skewness values are very low and range\nand future commodities returns are not skewed, consistent\nwith the results of the other two skewness measures. The\ncommodity future contracts show similar results where only\none gold contract (Gold Kilo) has high positive Skewness\nIII. Two gold contracts and a silver contract also have low\npositive Skewness III. Commodity futures results are similar\nto commodity spot. Given the frequent floods in Pakistan\nprices due to sharp supply cuts, one may expect high skew-\nness values. However, commodity exposure to positive\nshocks does not generate positively skewed returns (Kat &\nStocks have the tendency to portray negative skew returns\nvalue stocks have positive skewness where Pakistan\nPetroleum Ltd. (PPL) has the highest value. Large cap\ngrowth stocks report negative skewness. Karachi Electric\nSupply Corporation (KESC) has very high positive skew-\nness, which is consistent with the conclusion of Shefrin and\nties-based firm stocks (indirect exposure) also show mar-\nginal positive skewness in both long and short time periods.\nKurtosis I, II, and III measures show that commodity\nfutures contracts and stocks have above normal kurtosis.\nCommodity spot return's EK is comparable with commodity\nfutures. Gold future contracts seem more prone to severe\noutcomes. Crude oil future contracts have more chances of\nextreme events compared with spot oil returns. Stocks have\nEK but within the range of 0.5 to 4. Commodity futures\nresults indicate higher EK compared with Karachi Stock\nExchange (KSE) Index returns in contrast with the results of\nprevious studies (Kat & Oomen, 2006) conducted in well-\ndeveloped futures markets. Higher sensitivity of commodity\n4 SAGE Open\nfutures returns to extreme events, in comparison with stocks\nand index, in a newly developed futures market indicates that\ninvestment attributes depend on the state of market develop-\nment, storage infrastructure of commodities, and traders'\nexperience. EK of all stocks is comparable and maximum\nEK touches the value of 4 over a long period of time. Indirect\ncommodity exposure also shows low EK values.\nCommodity or stock investment may seem riskier from a\nstand-alone perspective, but when added to portfolio, it is the\nassociation which matters (Kat & Oomen, 2006). Results of\nPearson's correlation (see Table 2) between different com-\nmodities and stocks show weak correlation and even nega-\ntive in few cases. In commodities, Gold spot shows\ncorrelation with silver spot and futures. There is also a very\nlow correlation between crude oil, rice, and wheat.\nGold and crude oil futures indicate lowest correlation\nwhen measured with Kendall's . Adding stocks to gold and\ncrude further reduces the portfolio's correlation.\nDiversification benefits can be enhanced by adding small cap\nvalue stocks in a portfolio. Stocks have low correlation with\ncommodity futures compared with commodity spot.\nCommodities and stocks have low or negative association\nover a longer period of time compared with short time hori-\nzon. Commodity spot and futures contracts show no sign of\nbondage or movement with KSE 100 index over both long\nand short time periods. It is also a signal that index invest-\nTable 1.

Stocks and bonds have\nbeen criticized historically for purchasing power loss.\nComparing the data (see Table 3) for long and short time\nperiods reveals that stocks protect investor's purchasing\npower over a longer period of time.\nStocks show no sign of inflation hedging for short period\nof time. All large cap growth stocks have low significant\nassociation with inflation over a longer period of time. For\nshort time period, no significant association is witnessed. All\nstocks show similar results over a longer time period. Only\ncommodity-based firms (NML, ATRL, NFoods, RMPL)\nhave low significant association with inflation for both short\nand long time periods. Both commodity spot and future\nreturns have high and significant association with unex-\npected inflation. Commodity futures have out surpassed both\ncommodity spot and stocks inflation hedging property.\nWithin group (metal class), gold has offered more inflation\nhedging property compared with silver and within gold class,\nTGold 100 and TGold 50 have strong association with infla-\ntion. TGold 50 has the highest Kendall's  association within\nand across commodity groups. Crude oil futures contract has\nthe highest Kendall's  association value of .838.Agricultural\ncommodity futures contracts also show medium-level asso-\nciation with inflation where Palmolien has more association\ncompared with rice futures contracts. It shows that agricul-\ntural commodity future contracts have low inflation protec-\ntion property. KSE 100 index and consumer price index\n(CPI) show weak association. Gold and crude oil futures\nhave strongest Kendall's  correlation with inflation and neg-\native association with stocks, which makes them strongest\ncandidate for portfolio diversification and inflation hedging.\nAccording to the theory of storage (Kaldor, 1940), volatil-\nity of commodity prices is inversely related to inventory lev-\nels. Infrequent price shocks can be balanced with the\nadequate storage facilities. Storage requirements also differ\ndepending on the nature of commodities. For agricultural\ncommodities, weather conditions play a vital role in supply\nparticular attention in this setting. The volatility analysis of\ncommodity spots and futures is presented in Table 4. In com-\nmodity futures contracts, RICEIRRI-6, CRUIDE100, and\nPALMOLEIN have the highest volatility ratios. Commodity\nspots volatility ratio with index ( RI ) is between 1.36 and\n2.96. Silver PKR spot has the highest volatility ratio ( RI )\nwith a value of 1.35. Gold PKR spot has the highest \" RI \"\nvalue over a longer period of time. Crude oil spot has the\nhighest \" RS \" value of 1.04 over a long time period. Major\ndifference is observed in Gold spot where the ratios consid-\nerably changed between shorter and longer time periods.\nResults are in contrast with those of Kat and Oomen (2006).\nThe volatility of commodity prices is higher than stock and\nindex. For investment point of view, simply relying on diver-\nsification parameters may not be enough as the things change\nduring crises.\nAsymmetric volatility (last column) in GJR-GARCH\nmodel is shown in Table 5. Negative coefficient values imply\nthat downward (negative) surprises demonstrate a lesser\nforce on the volatility than upward (positive) shocks. From\nanother perspective, upward shock of asset classes enhances\nvolatility of asset more than downward shocks. All stocks\nshow asymmetric volatility. Gold and other commodities\nreflect inverted asymmetry. In the case of commodities, gold\nhas highest volatility (also evident through volatility analy-\nsis) along with inverted asymmetry, implying that increase in\ngold prices has more volatility impact than decrease in price.\nBaur (2012) argues that this effect is related to the safe-\nheaven property of gold. The higher gold prices may be con-\nsidered as an indication of future adverse conditions and\nuncertainty in other asset markets. This perceived uncer-\ntainty by the investors results in higher volatility in gold mar-\nkets. The inverted volatility effect of gold can lower the\naggregate risk of a portfolio for specific correlation levels\n(Baur, 2012). Traditional use of gold as ornament in Pakistan\n(inelastic demand) may have also contributed to higher\nprices during uncertain markets. All commodity spot and\nfutures show similar results with varying magnitude of asym-\nmetric volatility.\nTable 2.

Tail dependence, from a risk management and\nportfolio perspective, has captured increased attention of\ninvestors and portfolio managers. It helps determine the joint\ndownside movement of two investments when downside risk\nis concerned. It captures the true behavior, especially when\ninvestment returns are not linearly related and their return\ndistributions are not normal. Student's t copula has a better\nability to capture the joint downside, keeping the flexibility\nof center of the distribution. Commodity futures contracts\n(gold, crude oil, and rice) have negative tail dependence with\neach other, which shows no joint downside movement. Other\nfutures contracts show no sign of significant tail dependency,\ngood news from the investor's risk management perspective.\nCommodity futures and stocks show no sign of tail depen-\ndency for both short and long time periods. Results are in\ncontrast with those of Delatte and Lopez (2013). Comparing\ncommodity spot tail dependence pattern, there are cases\nwhere tail dependence is witnessed over the long period.\nSilver spot and Gold spot show significant tail dependence\nbut with low magnitude. Same is the case with silver and oil.\nStocks of different styles reflect significant tail dependency\nwhen assessed within category. Large cap value and growth\nstocks show significant and above medium tail dependency\nwith KSE 100 index, whereas small cap growth and value\nstocks show below medium tail dependency with KSE 100.\nWithin large cap growth and value stocks, almost all stocks\nreflect significant tail dependency with each other, while\nacross group tail dependency decreases for small cap and\ncommodity-based firm stocks. Graphs of selected Student's t\ncopula are provided in Appendix C.\nConclusion\nIn a multivariate analysis of stocks and commodities, the\nresults of this study indicate that stocks have marginally\npositive skewness. Stocks'returns have significant and pos-\nitive skewness over longer period of time but no or mar-\nginal negative skewness over a shorter time period. We may\nconclude that stocks do not provide better results when\ninvestment is made for a short time period. Commodity\nspot and futures reflect little or no positive skewness after\naccounting for outliers. Hence, the commodities are not\nexposed to positive shocks. These results make commodity\nTable 4.

Commodity futures EK is comparable with large\ncap stocks. Indirect commodities' returns have low EK val-\nues and hence make them a strong candidate for risk-averse\ninvestors.\nThe analysis also highlights that the risk\u00adreturn relation\ncan be changed by adding commodities in a portfolio of\nstocks. Commodities and stock investments show no associ-\nation with each other, indicating potential diversification\nbenefits. However, all the commodity futures do not offer\nsame diversification benefits, also highlighted by Faber\nhave strong protection against inflation, a property not found\nin stocks investments. Gold and crude oil futures show high-\nest diversification and inflation hedging benefits. These\nresults are in line with those of Bodie and Rosansky (1980),\nStocks have low significant correlation with inflation over a\nlonger period as compared with short time period, a bad sign\nfor investors expecting short-term inflation protection.\nGold has highest inverted asymmetry, while stocks\nexhibit high asymmetric volatility. The inverted asymmet-\nric volatility of gold and other commodities along with\nasymmetric volatility of stocks can benefit the investors by\nreducing overall portfolio risk. The volatility impact is not\nsame for both commodities and stocks. Increased volatility\nof commodities becomes good news for the investors pro-\ntecting their wealth in period of uncertainty in financial\nmarkets. In a portfolio of stocks and commodities, high\nvolatility of commodities complements the advantageous\nnegative correlation during economic turmoil. These find-\nings are consistent with Baur and Mcdermott (2010),\nMcCown and Zimmerman (2006), and Glosten et al.\nBoth commodities and stocks show no sign of tail depen-\ndency. Large cap value and growth stocks show significant\nand above medium tail dependency with KSE 100 index,\nwhereas small cap growth and value stocks show below\nmedium tail dependency with KSE 100. This pattern is\nappropriate as KSE 100 is capitalization value weighted\nindex and therefore large cap stocks have high impact on the\nmovement of the index than small cap stocks. Commodity\nfuture contracts and stocks can be added to portfolio as both\nthese investments are not moving jointly on the downside.\nThe reported results are of Student's t copula, which may\nvary if another copula function is applied. Our analysis finds\nthat investment in commodities can be a good diversifier for\nstocks portfolio and it also protects the purchasing power of\ninvestments. However, these findings are subject to change\nover time.\nAppendix B\nStudent's t copula function to get Graphs in matlab.\nx = stocks(:,1);\ny = stocks(:,2);\nu = ksdensity(x,x,`function',`cdf');\nv = ksdensity(y,y,`function',`cdf');\n[Rho,nu] = copulafit(`t',[u v],`Method',\n`ApproximateML')\ntau = copulastat(`t',Rho, `type',`kendall')\nscatterhist(u1,v1,`Direction',`out')\nxlabel(`u')\nylabel(`v')\nset(get(gca,`children'),`marker',`.')\nInvestment type Criteria Selected stocks and commodities Stocks' symbol Time frame\nStocks\nLCG Rules 1, 2, and 4 Unilever Pakistan Ltd UNILEVER Long time period from 2004 to\nPakistan Telecommunication PTC\nEngro Corporation Ltd ENGRO\nPakistan State Oil PSO\nLucky Cement Ltd LUCKY\nLCV Rules 1, 2, and 5 Oil and Gas Development Corporation Ltd OGDCL\nPakistan Petroleum Ltd PPL\nMCB Bank Ltd MCB\nFauji Fertilizer Corporation FFC\nPakistan Oil Fields Ltd POL\nSCG Rules 1, 3, and 4 Karachi Electric Supply Corporation KESC\nJahangir Siddiqui Corporation Ltd JSCL\nAdamjee Insurance Corporation Ltd AICL\nBYCO Petroleum BYCO\nFauji Cement Corporation Ltd FCCL\nSCV Rules 1, 3, and 5 Clariant Pakistan CP\nAttock Cement Pakistan Ltd ACPL\nAskari Bank Ltd AKBL\nPakistan Suzuki Motor Corporation PSMC\nPackages Ltd PKGS\nCBF Indirect exposure to\ncommodity prices\nNishat Mills Ltd NML\nAttock Refinery Ltd ATRL\nFauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Ltd FFBL\nNational Foods NF\nRafhan Maize Products RMPL\nIndex Largest stock exchange for\ninflation hedge test\nKarachi Stock Exchange-100 Index KSE\nInflation Consumer Price Index CPI\nCommodity spot\nGold Commonly traded spot\ncommodities.\nGold Prices in Pak.
