This growing national problem has raised concerns\namong criminal justice system practitioners and victim advocates\nalike. When SAKs (also termed `rape kits') are not submitted for\nforensic DNA testing, there is no opportunity for the evidence\nwithin these kits to help prosecute perpetrators, protect public\nsafety, and/or exonerate those who have been wrongly accused\nof crimes they did not commit (1,6). Even if tested years after\ntheir original collection, previously untested SAKs still have the\npotential to provide actionable information for police and prose-\ncutors, so many jurisdictions are deciding to submit their kits for\nforensic testing, often thousands of SAKs at a time (5), which\npresents substantial challenges for forensic science laboratories.\nTo meet these increasing demands for testing, it is essential that\nlaboratories have DNA testing methods that are time, staff, and\nresource efficient, without sacrificing quality. To that end, in this\nstudy, we examined an emerging method that has shown pro-\nmise in the forensic science literature for its efficiency and qual-\nity--selective degradation (7,8). Using actual casework from one\nU.S. city that had thousands of untested SAKs in police prop-\nerty, Detroit, Michigan, we compared the forensic testing out-\ncomes of SAKs analyzed with selective degradation or standard\nmethods.\nOver the past thirty years, there have been revolutionary\nchanges in how biological evidence can be tested and used by\nthe criminal justice system (9\u00ad12). The general process of testing\ncrime scene evidence for DNA includes body fluid identification\n(serology) screening of the samples to determine whether they\ncontain biological evidence (e.g., semen, saliva, blood), extract-\ning the DNA from the samples, quantifying the amount of DNA\nextracted, characterizing the DNA, and finally analyzing and\ninterpreting the results (9). Over the years, different methods\nhave been developed for the extraction, amplification, separation,\nand analysis steps, and in the past decade, newer methods have\nbeen developed that allows forensic scientists to skip traditional\nserology screening in favor of faster screening methods that\ndetermine whether there is any male DNA in the samples (Y-\nmarker screening methods). The development of short tandem\nrepeat (STR) typing techniques and polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) methods have been particularly impactful advancements\nfor offering faster analysis with smaller samples (10). There have\nalso been significant successes in decreasing overall testing time\nthrough the use of automation (13) and microchip technology\n1Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI.\n2Center for Statistical Training & Consultation, Michigan State University,\nEast Lansing, MI.\n3Department of Social Work, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA.\n4Michigan State Police, Forensic Science Division, Lansing, MI.\n5Harder+Company Community Research, Los Angeles, CA.\n*Supported by a grant from the National Institute of Justice (2011-DN-\nThe opinions or points of view expressed in this document are those of\nthe authors and do not reflect the official position of the U.S. Department of\nJustice.\n\u00a9 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences\nAvailable online at: onlinelibrary.wiley.com\nMore recently, other strategies for reducing testing time have\nemerged, ones that focus on improving efficiency within specific\nsteps of the DNA testing process. One of the more time-consum-\ning processes in testing samples from SAKs is separating the\nsperm cells from all other cells (e.g., male epithelial cells, female\nepithelial cells). National epidemiological data indicate that most\nsexual assault victims are female and most perpetrators are male\n(16), so the task of separating male and female DNA is neces-\nsary for the vast majority of SAKs submitted for forensic testing.\nTraditionally, the differential lysis method has been used, which\n\"relies on separation of intact sperm from the DNA of digested\nepithelial cells by centrifugation and careful removal of super-\nnatant, a process that remains unchanged since it was first\ndescribed in 1985\" (7). For decades, standard practice has been\nto physically separate the offender's sperm from all other cells\nby use of a centrifuge and then to wash the sample repeatedly to\nremove any remaining female DNA. This process for DNA\nextraction has been criticized for its tediousness, difficulty to\nautomate, and riskiness for losing sperm from the sample (8).\nTo address these problems, selective degradation methods\nwere created, which utilize chemical techniques for the separa-\ntion of male and female DNA (see Fig. 1). Nonsperm cells (e.g.,\nmale offender epithelial, female victim epithelial cells) are chem-\nically lysed; the sperm heads are resistant to this process and are\nnot lysed. This first step produces a pellet of sperm heads with\nresidual DNA from the lysed nonsperm cells. A nuclease is used\nto remove remnants of nonsperm DNA from the sperm head pel-\nlet. The nuclease is deactivated prior to chemical rupture of the\nsperm heads, producing a relatively pure male DNA sample for\nexplained, \"the addition of a degradative agent is inherently\neasier than a physical separation process and can require only a\nTo evaluate the efficacy of the selective degradation method,\nGarvin et al. (2009) analyzed postcoital vaginal swabs from con-\nsensual vaginal\u00adpenile sexual intercourse; swabs were divided\nlengthwise and then randomly assigned to DNA testing method\n(standard vs. selective degradation). As expected, the samples\ntreated with the nuclease had far less contamination by female\nDNA, making identification of the male profile substantially\neasier. Garvin et al. (2009) also obtained archived swabs from\nfive criminal sexual assault cases and randomly assigned sam-\nples to testing condition. In three samples, there was similar per-\nformance between the two methods, and for two samples,\nselective degradation produced superior STR profiles than stan-\ndard methods. In a follow-up efficacy study, Garvin et al.\n(2012) compared STR profiles generated by selective degrada-\ntion and standard methods from three types of samples:\nsemen-spiked female buccal swabs, postcoital vaginal swabs\nfrom consensual sex, and four samples from actual criminal sex-\nual assault casework. Across all three types of samples, the STR\nprofiles of male DNA fractions extracted via selective degrada-\ntion were of equal or better quality than those obtained using\nstandard methods.\nThe results of these efficacy studies are promising, so a key\nnext step in this line of research is to evaluate selective degrada-\ntion methods with larger samples of actual sexual assault case-\nwork. It is also important to examine whether there are any\n\"downstream\" implications of this testing method with respect to\nwhether and how the results may be utilized by criminal justice\nsystem practitioners; specifically, in regard to whether a profile\nwill qualify for entry into CODIS. CODIS (Combined DNA\nIndex System) is the U.S. national forensic DNA database,\nwhich consists of reference DNA profiles from arrestees/con-\nvicted offenders and from samples obtained at crime scenes\n(9,17\u00ad19). A DNA profile may be eligible for entry into CODIS\nif it meets specified standards regarding biological quality of the\nsample, and reasonable assurances that a crime was in fact com-\nmitted and that the forensic sample is most likely from the\nthese standards, then it can be compared to the reference sam-\nples in CODIS, and if there is a match (termed a \"hit\"), then\nlaw enforcement personnel have a promising investigative lead.\nTo date, no prior studies have compared rates of CODIS entry\nstemming from different DNA testing methods to determine\nwhether resulting profiles are more or less likely to qualify for\nCODIS. Because a CODIS entry is a necessary condition for a\nCODIS hit, it is useful to examine this outcome as a first step in\nunderstanding how testing methods can affect law enforcement\nand prosecutorial utilization of forensic testing findings. If there\nare \"downstream\" differences such that CODIS entry rates for a\nparticular DNA testing method are significantly higher or lower\nthan another method, such findings could be concerning for\ncriminal justice system practitioners. However, if the rates of\nCODIS entry are functionally equivalent across testing methods,\nbut one method is notably more resource efficient, then such\ninformation could be helpful to laboratory administrators and\ntheir colleagues in law enforcement and prosecution for estab-\nlishing methods for SAK testing, particularly if this effect was\nestablished with actual criminal sexual assault casework.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to examine forensic\ntesting outcomes in a sample of 350 SAKs from Detroit, Michi-\ngan. This sample was selected from the larger population of\napproximately 8,500 untested SAKs that were found in a Detroit\npolice department storage facility in August, 2009 (21). When\nthese untested SAKs were discovered, a multidisciplinary action\nresearch project was formed with funding from the National\nInstitute of Justice to bring together researchers and law enforce-\nment personnel, prosecutors, forensic scientists, nurses/medical\npersonnel, and victim advocates to develop data-driven response\nstrategies (22). A primary goal of this action research project\nwas to develop empirically informed approaches for resolving\nlarge numbers of untested SAKs, which provided an opportunity\nto evaluate promising DNA testing methods with actual case-\nwork. To that end, we randomly selected a sample of SAKs\n(N = 350) and randomly assigned kits to either standard DNA\ntesting methods or selective degradation methods. In contrast to\nprior formative studies on selective degradation by Garvin and\ncolleagues (7,8), our focus was not the forensic adequacy of the\nmethod (i.e., STR profile quality), but rather its potential utility\nto criminal justice system practitioners. As such, we quantified\nand compared how many SAKs in each testing group proceeded\nfrom serology screening to DNA testing to CODIS-eligible pro-\nfiles, as well as how the methods compared with respect to the\ncost of consumable supplies and the amount of personnel effort\nrequired to test, interpret, and review the testing results.\nMethods\nSample\nThe sample contained a total of 350 SAKs, which were asso-\nciated with a total of 344 unique assailants. Descriptive charac-\nteristics of the victims, offenders, and sexual assaults associated\nwith these SAKs are documented in Table 1 (for each testing\nmethod and for the overall sample). Nearly all of these victims\nwere female (96.6%) and the assailants were male (94.9%). It is\nimportant to note that in female-perpetrated sexual assaults,\nselective degradation methods would not be appropriate (regard-\nless of which testing condition to which the kit was assigned),\nand standard methods would be utilized. In this project, only\none SAK associated with a female assailant was assigned to the\nselective degradation testing group, but it did not pass the body\nfluid identification (serology) screening, so this was not a con-\ncern in this study. Four of the SAKs randomly assigned to the\nselective degradation group had missing data regarding perpetra-\ntor gender; there was no additional information in the medical\nforensic report to suggest that the offender was female, and\ngiven that the overwhelming majority of SAKs received by the\nstate police forensic science division have male perpetrators, test-\ning proceeded as though these four offenders were male. Among\nthe SAKs associated with sexual assaults in which there were\nmultiple perpetrators, the assailants were exclusively male for all\nbut one SAK, which had missing data regarding assailant gen-\nder; that kit had been randomly assigned to the standard testing\ngroup, so the missing data regarding offender gender were not\nproblematic. With respect to race/ethnicity, most of the victims\nrespectively), consistent with the demographic composition of\nDetroit. The victims were, on average, 23.04 years old at the\ntime of the assault, and the assailants were somewhat older\n(M = 28.49 years old). The SAKs had been collected, on aver-\nage, 6.55 years prior to the time they were selected for testing,\nwith a range of 4\u00ad11 years ago. Accounting for missing data,\n21.1% of the assaults were committed by a stranger and 60.9%\nwere committed by someone known to the victim.\nProcedures and Measures\nWe randomly assigned half of the SAKs to each DNA testing\nmethod (0 = standard testing; 1 = selective degradation testing).\nThe state police outsourced forensic testing of the SAKs to a pri-\nvate laboratory capable of performing selective degradation test-\ning methods. A site visit was conducted at the vendor laboratory\nbefore shipment of the kits to ensure that testing procedures and\nquality control processes met standards established by the state\npolice forensic science division.\nForensic testing is a multistage process whereby SAKs pass\non from one stage to the next only if they meet stage-specific\ntransition criteria (10,12); hence, the last stage of testing reached\nby each SAK is an ordinal variable. We reorganized the data to\nrecord a set of stage-specific binary outcome variables showing\nwhether each SAK continued to the next stage after it reached a\ngiven stage (0 = no, 1 = yes). For this study, we focused on\nFIG. 1\u00ad\u00adComparing standard and selective degradation DNA extraction methods. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\ntwo specific transition points in this process. First, we computed\nhow many SAKs passed serology screening (i.e., the samples in\nthe kit contained bodily fluids that could be analyzed), which we\ntermed Stage 0, and proceeded to DNA testing, which we ter-\nmed Stage 1. The probability that a kit will proceed from Stage\n0 to Stage 1 can be quantified as the DNA Testing Rate. We did\nnot expect a significant difference in the DNA testing rate\nbetween the two testing conditions because what distinguishes\nthe two groups occurs during Stage 1, but we quantified and\ncompared this rate to verify that randomization to testing condi-\ntion was successful.\nFor the SAKs randomly assigned to the standard DNA testing\ncondition, if semen was present via Christmas tree staining and\nmicroscopic observation, the forensic scientist used a standard\ndifferential extraction method to separate the sperm from the\nnonsperm cells. For the SAKs in the selective degradation condi-\ntion, if semen was present, the sample was chemically lysed,\nseparated by centrifugation, and the resulting sperm pellet treated\nwith a nuclease to purify the sperm. Once the sperm cells were\nisolated, testing in both conditions proceeded per usual PCR-\nSTR methods. The DNA quantitation method used quantitative\nPCR using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR instru-\nment and Promega's Plexor HY quantitation chemistry. The\nshort tandem repeat (STR) kit was Promega's PowerPlex 16HS\nchemistry. If no semen was present, the kit testing was halted\nand no further testing occurred regardless of group.\nThe second key transition point in the testing process that we\nexamined was whether the resulting DNA profile (whether\nobtained by standard methods or selective degradation methods)\nmet minimum state requirements for completeness and eligibility\nfor entry into CODIS (Stage 2). The probability that a kit will\npass from Stage 1 to Stage 2 was quantified as the CODIS Entry\nRate. Comparing the CODIS entry rates between the two testing\nconditions was the key focus of this study. We did not examine\nwhether those CODIS entries resulted in a CODIS hit (i.e.,\nCODIS Hit Rate, Stage 3) because a hit depends on the match\nbetween the contents of new CODIS entries and other records\nalready stored in CODIS (not on the method used to extract the\nDNA). Any effect of testing method on the CODIS hit rate must\nbe mediated by either what is being entered into CODIS or what\nwas already present in CODIS.\nThe vendor laboratory completed stages 0 and 1 in the testing\nprocess. Forensic scientists at that laboratory recorded whether\neach SAK passed the serology screening, the presence of sperm\n(0 = absent, 1 = present), the cost of consumable supplies (in\nUS dollars, including the costs of waste, controls, and reprocess-\ning), and laboratory personnel effort spent on testing and review-\ning test results (in hours). Then, state police forensic scientists\nreviewed the results, entered eligible profiles into CODIS (Stage\n2), and recorded CODIS entry outcomes and personnel effort\nspent reviewing test results (in hours). The testing outcomes for\neach SAK (whether it advanced from Stage 0 to Stage 1, then\nfrom Stage 1 to Stage 2), the presence of sperm, and the staff\ntime and cost of consumable supplies required to test/review the\nresults were recorded and sent to the research team.\nThe cost and personnel effort data were sometimes recorded\nas aggregate values for batches of multiple SAKs and other\ntimes recorded separately for each SAK. This inconsistency in\nthe level of detail recorded requires that we aggregate these data\nand present only descriptive summaries, as we are not aware of\nany statistical method that can adequately quantify the sampling\nvariation expected around the estimates given the inconsistent\nway the data were recorded.\nData Analytic Plan\nWe used continuation-ratio models (23,24) to quantify and\ncompare the forensic outcomes (i.e., DNA testing and CODIS\nentry rates) as a function of DNA testing method. Continuation-\nratio models are an appropriate analytic choice for evaluating\nsequential selection processes (23), which aligned well with our\nfocus on examining SAK progression through these two transi-\ntion points (or stages) in the forensic testing process.\nOur base model regressed stage-specific binary outcomes\nshowing whether a SAK continued passed each stage to reach\nthe next one (0 = no, 1 = yes) on main effects for stage and\nDNA testing method, plus a stage times method interaction.

By contrast, the\nCODIS entry rate is a conditional rate that corresponds to the\nproportion of SAKs that were actually tested (i.e., that passed\nthe screening at Stage 0) that yielded DNA profiles suitable for\nupload into CODIS. Focusing on the conditional estimate\nensures that we have a clean comparison between the two DNA\ntesting methods under conditions where laboratory personnel\nbelieve there is enough biological evidence present in the SAKs\nthat extracting an offender's DNA profile is actually possible.\nIn addition to reporting these rates, we also report odds ratios\n(ORs), relative risks (RRs), and number needed to submit (NNS,\nwhich is based on the number needed to treat [NNT]; (25,26) to\nfacilitate interpretation of the findings. Relative risk reflects how\nmuch more often an event happens (e.g., a CODIS entry) for\none group (e.g., SAKs tested with selective degradation meth-\nods) relative to another group (e.g., SAKs tested with standard\nmethods). RR is computed by dividing the CODIS entry rate for\nthe selective degradation testing group by the CODIS entry rate\nfor standard group, which tells us how much more likely that\noutcome (CODIS entry) is for the former group versus the latter.\nThe NNS is another useful index for understanding differential\nrates between two groups. Larger absolute values of NNS indi-\ncate that more SAKs would need to be submitted and tested to\nobtain a one-unit difference between the groups; if it takes a\nsubstantial number of SAKs to yield just a one-unit difference in\nthe focal outcome (e.g., CODIS-eligible profiles), then that sug-\ngests the two groups are fairly similar and it may not make prac-\ntical sense to treat them differentially.\nResults from two separate analyses are presented below: (1) a\nbase model that omits covariates; and (2) a model that accounts\nfor a binary covariate, namely the presence of sperm in the\nSAK, acting as a moderator of the testing method effect. In this\ncontext, a moderator is a covariate that modifies how strongly a\nfocal predictor affects the outcome of interest. Here, we consider\nthe possibility that the testing method effect on DNA testing\nrates and CODIS entry rate depends on whether sperm is present\nin the SAK. The selective degradation testing method is\ndesigned to work by selectively degrading DNA not contributed\nby a sperm cell. Thus, it has the greatest potential to outperform\nstandard testing when sperm is present. It also has some poten-\ntial to perform worse when sperm is not present because other\nassailant DNA that is present may be degraded. Accounting for\nthis potential moderator may be important in understanding\nwhen standard versus selective degradation testing may yield dif-\nferent results. To examine whether the testing method influences\nforensic outcomes after we account for the presence or absence\nof sperm, we extended the model to include a stage by testing\nmethod by presence of sperm interaction effect, then looked at\nthe simple main effect of testing method on each rate separately\nwhen sperm was absent and when it was present.\nWe also directly examined whether the two groups yield con-\nditional and unconditional CODIS entry rates that are function-\nally equivalent. Conventional statistical tests, such as the\ncontinuation-ratio model, adopt a null hypothesis that there is no\ndifference between groups (i.e., their outcomes are exactly\nequal). A nonsignificant finding from a conventional test yields\nonly an \"absence of evidence\" with respect to the hypothesis\nthat two groups have equivalent outcomes. Establishing that\ngroups have equivalent outcomes requires generating credible\n\"evidence of absence\" with respect to group differences, which\nis the purpose of equivalence tests. These statistical methods\nadopt the null hypothesis that the outcomes for the groups are\nnot equivalent (i.e., the difference is large enough to be impor-\ntant) (27\u00ad31). Only when the analysis provides strong evidence\nrefuting that assumption can we conclude that groups are equiva-\nlent. Explicitly defining equivalence in advance is crucial for\nthese tests. When rates are expressed as proportions, the margin\nof equivalence can be expressed as either an odds ratio or an\nabsolute risk reduction (ARR = pSD\n) (28). We set the mar-\ngin of equivalence for the ARR at 5% because feedback from\nforensic science stakeholders (two at the state level and two at\nthe national level) suggested that CODIS entry rates for the two\nwould warrant considering the two DNA testing methods func-\ntionally equivalent.\nWe analyzed the data with R 3.2.2 (32) and several R pack-\nages (33\u00ad40). All data, raw statistical output, and R code used to\nobtain our results have been submitted for archiving in the\nNational Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) to promote\nreproducible research.\nResults and Discussion\nConditional Rates for DNA Testing and CODIS Entry:\nModerator Omitted\nFigure 2 shows the effect of DNA testing method on the test-\ning outcomes when we omit the potential moderator (presence of\nsperm) from the model.

The CODIS entry rate is\na conditional estimate (the proportion of SAKs tested that yielded a DNA\nprofile suitable for upload into CODIS). These results generalize to the sub-\npopulation of untested, SOL-unexpired Detroit SAKs (regardless of adjudica-\ntion status or victim\u00adoffender relationship).

So, CODIS entry rates\nfor the two groups are not equivalent because the rate yielded\nby selective degradation testing may be more than 5% lower\nthan the rate yielded by standard testing.\nWe also examined results of the experiment in terms of\nunconditional rates when we omit the potential moderator from\nthe model. Because our focus is on conditional CODIS entry\nrates, we put Figure S1 (which contains the unconditional rates)\nand interpretive comments in the supplemental file.\nConditional Rates for DNA Testing and CODIS Entry:\nModerator Included\nFigure 3 shows the effect of testing method on the testing out-\ncomes when we include the presence of sperm as a moderator in\nthe model.

There was little\nbetween the two methods, which could be entirely attributable to\nthe difference in costs at the Stage 0 screening.\nThe aggregate time spent by laboratory personnel on stan-\nlaboratory personnel spent on selective degradation testing\nMost of the difference was time spent on the actual testing\npersonnel spent an average of 4.85 h/SAK on standard DNA\ntesting; they spent an average of 3.75 h/SAK on selective\ndegradation testing. Therefore, selective degradation testing\nmethod saved an average of 1.10 h/SAK in laboratory person-\nnel time relative to standard testing. Cumulated across a large\ncollection of SAKs, this may yield substantial savings on per-\nsonnel costs, but we cannot assess how much sampling varia-\ntion one might expect in these estimates from the current\ndata. The true average time savings for laboratory personnel\ncould be higher or lower, but we cannot provide a valid CI\nbecause the data were already partially aggregated when we\nreceived them.\nThe aggregate difference in state police forensic science per-\nsonnel time spent on reviewing test results was substantially\nsmaller (a total of 10.85 h).

The DNA testing\nrate is an unconditional estimate (the proportion of SAKs that pass the Stage\n0 serology screening to reach Stage 1 (the actual DNA test)).

These results\ngeneralize to the subpopulation of untested, SOL-unexpired Detroit SAKs\n(regardless of adjudication status or victim\u00adoffender relationship). After\nselecting N = 350 SAKs from that subpopulation, n = 175 SAKs were\nrandomly allocated to each of the two testing methods. The SAKs were\nsorted by the presence/absence of sperm in the samples.

Again, we cannot assess how much\nsampling variation one might expect for that figure due to par-\ntially aggregated data.\nTABLE 3\u00ad\u00adContinuation-ratio model for DNA testing method effect (moderator included).\nModel Effects\nParameter Estimate SE Rate Rate 95% CI Odds Ratio OR 95% CI p-value\nStage\nTesting method\nSperm\nStage by testing method interaction\nStage by Sperm Interaction\nTesting Method by Sperm Interaction\nStage 1\u00ad>2: Selective degradation effect\ntimes 1 sperm effect adj. for CODIS entry rate\nStage by Testing Method by Sperm Interaction\nStage 1\u00ad>2: 1 sperm times Selective degradation\ntimes CODIS entry rate effect\nDerived Contrasts\nSpecific Rates Estimate SE Rate Rate 95% CI Odds Ratio* OR 95% CI* p-value\nSimple Main Effects Estimate SE Rate Rate 95% CI Odds Ratio OR 95% CI p-value\nThese results generalize to the subpopulation of untested, SOL-unexpired Detroit SAKs (regardless of adjudication status or victim\u00adoffender relationship).\nAfter selecting N = 350 SAKs from that subpopulation, n = 175 SAKs were randomly allocated to each of the two testing methods.

Cost estimates include waste, controls, and reprocessing. SAK = sexual assault kit.\nDiscussion of Findings\nA growing body of research indicates that there are likely\nhundreds of thousands of untested SAKs in police property facil-\nities throughout the United States (1,6). These kits could contain\nuseful, actionable information for law enforcement personnel and\nprosecutors, so many communities with large numbers of\nuntested rape kits have elected to have all kits tested for DNA\n(41). In addition, many U.S. states are passing laws requiring\nthat all SAKs be submitted for forensic testing (41\u00ad44). It will\nbe challenging for forensic laboratories to process older, previ-\nously untested SAKs, and maintain timely turnaround on current\ncase work. Decreasing testing time, without sacrificing testing\nquality, is one of many strategies that could help meet this chal-\nlenge. Emerging literature suggests that selective degradation\nmethods may offer a more efficient approach for DNA extrac-\ntion, and initial efficacy studies indicate that the technique pro-\nduces good quality STR profiles (7,8).\nIn this project, we looked further \"downstream\" in the pro-\ncess of forensic testing to explore whether selective degradation\nmethods yielded comparable rates of CODIS-eligible DNA pro-\nfiles compared to standard testing methods. Using actual case\nwork from a sample of previously unsubmitted SAKs in\nDetroit, Michigan, we randomly assigned 350 kits to either\nstandard or selective degradation testing methods. We then\nquantified and compared the forensic testing results with\nrespect to DNA testing rates and CODIS entry rates. The con-\ntinuation-ratio model showed no significant differences between\nthe two groups, indicating that the selective degradation method\nhad no decrement in performance relative to customary meth-\nods. Follow-up equivalence tests, however, indicated that the\nCODIS entry rates for the two methods could differ by more\nthan \u00c65%, due to wide confidence intervals around the\nestimates.\nTaken together, these results are somewhat conflicting: The\nsignificance test model showed no difference between the rates\nof CODIS-eligible profiles for standard and selective degradation\nmethods, but the more rigorous test of equivalence could not\nestablish that the rates were statistically equivalent. Future stud-\nies should use larger samples because narrower confidence inter-\nvals around the estimated difference between the CODIS entry\nrates associated with standard and selective degradation DNA\ntesting methods will clarify whether these rates differ meaning-\nfully, allowing researchers to discern more definitively whether\nselective degradation performs at least as well as standard testing\nwith respect to CODIS entry rates. The data from this project\ncan help facilitate sample size planning required to obtain high\nprecision estimates (45,46). Our estimates were not precise\nenough to determine unambiguously whether any differences in\nCODIS entry rates between testing methods were small enough\nto be substantively unimportant.\nThe findings of this study are clearer regarding the potential\npractical utility of selective degradation methods. We computed\nnumber-needed-to-submit (NNS) indices, which estimate how\nmany more SAKs would have to be tested to obtain a one-unit\ndifference between the groups. In this study, when sperm were\npresent, the NNS = \u00c020.21, which was quite high and means\nthat we would need to test 20.21 SAKs via selective degradation\ntesting to observe a one-unit change in the number of CODIS\nentries (one fewer CODIS entry). The practical advantages of\nselective degradation were also evident in our cost analyses.\nMaterials costs were also similar across the two groups, but the\nselective degradation method offered a substantial savings in\nstaffing time for interpretation/review: 1.10 h of laboratory per-\nsonnel time per SAK relative to standard testing. Cumulated\nacross a large collection of SAKs, selective degradation testing\nmay yield substantial savings on personnel costs, but our results\nmerit replication in other laboratories/settings prior to broad-\nbased implementation.\nStudy Limitations\nIt is important to note several limitations of this study that\ntemper the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from\nthis work. First, it is worth reiterating that selective degrada-\ntion methods are not appropriate for female-perpetrated\nassaults, but given that national epidemiological data indicate\nthat the vast majority of sexual assaults are committed by\nmales (1,6), this testing method could be viable for most--but\ncertainly not all--SAK casework. Second, selective degrada-\ntion has the potential for automation, which was not used in\nthis experiment; thus, the potential time savings of this\nmethod are underestimated in this study. Replication of these\nfindings with automation would provide more sensitive data\nregarding potential time savings offered by selective degrada-\ntion. Finally, the focus of this study was not the quality of\nthe STR profiles generated by selective degradation (7,8), but\nrather, whether there are potential \"downstream\" differences in\nthe number of CODIS-eligible profiles. We did not explore\nhow these testing results were utilized by criminal justice\npractitioners in the investigation and prosecution of the cases\nassociated with these SAKs. As such, we do not know\nwhether there were (or will be) any legal challenges to this\ntesting method, which was beyond the scope of this study,\nbut clearly merits examination in future research.\nConclusions\nWith these caveats in mind, this study was the first large-scale\nevaluation of selective degradation testing methods with actual\nSAK casework. Our findings indicate that this method could\noffer forensic laboratories substantial time savings as a more\nefficient method for DNA extraction.\nCompared to standard testing methods, selective degradation\ndid not produce a significantly higher or lower number of\nCODIS-eligible DNA profiles, but additional studies are needed\nbecause our results were equivocal as to whether the rates were\nin fact statistically equivalent between the two groups. Addi-\ntional studies that evaluate both the quality of the STR profiles\nand the downstream utility and utilization of DNA profiles\nobtained through selective degradation are needed.\nReferences\n1.
