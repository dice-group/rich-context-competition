In apparent\ncontrast, however, other evidence has called into question\nwhether such early romantic relationships--though quite\nnormative in this age period--should be considered salient\ndevelopmental tasks in adolescence, in part because (a)\ncompetence in this domain may not have long-term pre-\ndictive significance for adaptation in adulthood (Roisman\net al. 2004) and (b) precocious engagement in this domain\nmay actually undermine development (Davies and Windle\nreconcile these two lines of research by examining whether\nhigh-quality parenting and peer experiences prior to and\nduring adolescence were negatively associated with the\ndepth of romantic relationship engagement (e.g., number of\nserious relationships; sexual experience) for a cohort\ntracked from infancy to age 15. Then, for the subsample\nwith a current romantic involvement at the time of the age\n15 survey, we examined whether high-quality parenting\nand peer experiences prior to and during adolescence were\npositively associated with romantic relationship quality.\nThis study is directed by a Steering Committee and supported by\nNICHD through a cooperative agreement (U10), which calls for\nscientific collaboration between the grantees and the NICHD staff.\nThe content is solely the responsibility of the named authors and does\nnot necessarily represent the official views of the Eunice Kennedy\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,\nthe National Institutes of Health, or individual members of the\nNetwork.\nG.

Cauffman\nDepartment of Psychology and Social Behavior,\nUniversity of California, Irvine, CA, USA\n \nBethesda, MD, USA\nMost theories of the development of romantic relation-\nships have focused on parents' influence on adolescents\n(Connolly et al. 2000). According to attachment theorists,\nthe attachment behavioral system provides the foundation\nfor the attachment, caretaking, and sexual behavior systems\noperating in romantic relationships (Furman and Wehner\n1994). Early experiences in attachment relationships affect\nindividuals' ability to form affectional bonds as well as the\nquality of these bonds. Hazan and Shaver (1987) proposed\nthat representations of parent\u00adchild relationships influence\nrepresentations of romantic relationships because these\nrelationships serve similar attachment functions, suggest-\ning continuities between experiences with primary\ncaregivers and the quality of later romantic attachments.\nAlthough some research has shown links between child\u00ad\nparent attachment and romantic relationships, these studies\nfrequently have focused on late adolescents and young\nScharf and Mayseless 2001), perhaps because, until\nrecently, it was assumed that romantic relationships in\nadolescence were of little developmental significance\nshowed that attachment to parents was related to 15- to\n18-year-old adolescents' social skills, which in turn were\nassociated with adolescents' friendship and romantic rela-\ntionship competence. Other research indicates that negative\nemotionality (e.g., anger, ambivalence) in parent\u00adadoles-\ncent dyads is predictive of poor quality interactions with\nromantic partners in late adolescence (Kim and Capaldi\n2004). Thus, there is some evidence that individuals with\nmore supportive experiences with parents also tend to have\nhigher quality romantic relationships in adolescence.\nAn alternative view is that adolescents' romantic rela-\ntionships, particularly those that occur before late\nadolescence, are more closely aligned with their relation-\nships with close friends and other peers than with their\nrelationships, past and present, with parents (Connolly\nromantic relationships are less intimate than later romantic\nrelationships and primarily involve the affiliative and sex-\nual systems rather than the attachment and caregiving\nFurman and Wehner 1994). Furthermore, romantic rela-\ntionships are egalitarian and develop within the peer\nnetwork, unlike child\u00adparent attachment relationships\n(Furman and Wehner 1994). Indeed, early on, Sullivan\n(1953) proposed that the capacity for intimacy first devel-\nops during pre-adolescence in same-sex friendships.\nAccording to Sullivan, once puberty begins, heterosexual\nadolescents begin to desire and seek intimacy in opposite-\nsex romantic relationships, transferring what they have\nlearned in same-sex friendships to opposite-sex romantic\nrelationships.\nThere is some empirical evidence of associations\nbetween the qualities of peer and romantic relationships\n1997). In addition, Furman and colleagues have stated that\ncurrent evidence indicates that links between supportive\ncharacteristics of parental and romantic relationships are\nweaker than those between friend and romantic relation-\nships in adolescence, yet virtually no study of adolescents'\nromantic relationships has included data on parent\u00adchild\nand friend relationships beginning in infancy and early\nThe current study aims to address this gap in the liter-\nature using prospective, longitudinal data drawn from a\ncohort of over 1,000 youth tracked from infancy through\nage 15 as part of the National Institute of Child Health and\nHuman Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth\nDevelopment (NICHD SECCYD). Specifically, we drew\non outcome data on romantic relationship engagement and\nquality (the latter for the subset currently involved in a\nromantic relationship) from the age 15 assessment of this\ncohort, as well as observational data on maternal sensitivity\nand mother-reports of participants' peer competence from\nchildhood through mid-adolescence.\nHypotheses\nFollowing from the results of studies conducted to date on\nadolescent romantic relationships reviewed above, we\nexpected that both parent\u00adchild and peer relationships in\nchildhood and adolescence are likely to be correlated with\nthe quality of adolescents' romantic relationships at age 15,\nsuch that supportive experiences with parents and peers is\nreflected in higher quality romantic relationships during\nadolescence. However, in line with recent theory and evi-\ndence that romantic relationships represent emerging\n(rather than already salient) tasks of development in ado-\nlescence (Roisman et al. 2004), we hypothesized (a) that\nhigh-quality experiences with parents and peers are most\nlikely to be reflected in higher-quality romantic relation-\nships for the sub-set of adolescents who engage in them,\nyet (b) negatively associated with indicators of intense\nengagement in this domain. This latter hypothesis is con-\nsistent with other empirical evidence that family\nexperiences can, in part, influence the likelihood that\nadolescents engage in risky sexual behavior (Coley and\ntheoretical arguments that adolescence reflects a period\nfocused on the development of identity, only after which\n(in adulthood) does intimacy (with romantic partners)\nemerge as a central theme of development (Erikson 1968).\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were enrolled in the NICHD SECCYD, a\nprospective longitudinal study conducted at 10 research\nsites across the US (Charlottesville, VA; Irvine, CA;\nLawrence, KS; Little Rock, AR; Madison, WI; Morganton,\nNC; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; Seattle, WA; and\nWellesley, MA). During selected 24-h sampling periods\nthe eligibility criteria for the study. Families were excluded\nif the mother was younger than 18 years of age; the family\nplanned to move; there was a multiple birth; the infant had\na known disability or remained in the hospital more than\n7 days; the mother acknowledged substance abuse; the\nmother did not speak English; or the mother lived more\nthan an hour from the laboratory site or in an extremely\nunsafe neighborhood as determined by local police. From\nthat group, 1,364 families became study participants upon\ncompleting a home interview when their infants were\n1 month old. The recruited sample consisted of 52% boys,\n24% children of color, 11% mothers not completing high\nschool, and 14% single-parent families. Additional details\nabout recruitment and selection procedures are available in\nprior publications from the study (see NICHD Early Child\nCare Research Network 2005) and from the study web site\n(http://secc.rti.org/).\nThe analysis sample in the present report comprised 957\nmissing data (note that although n = 957 is the sub-sample\nof participants at age 15 who completed the measure of\nromantic relationship involvement, n = 213 indicated a\ncurrent romantic relationship and completed questions\nrelated to quality--ns fluctuate further as a function of\nmissing data from earlier assessments). Participants inclu-\nded in the n = 957 analysis sample were primarily non-\n(SD = 2.4) years of education when participants were\n1 month old, and their families had a mean income-to-\nneeds ratio (from 1 month through 15 years) of 4.0\nProcedure\nChildren were followed from birth through age 15.\n36 and 54 months old; when they were in kindergarten and\ngathered from participants at home, in the laboratory, at\nschool, and via regular phone calls by trained personnel\nfrom the ten study sites that were centrally trained and\ncertified to conduct each assessment). The following\nsections describe the specific measures used in the present\nanalyses and the time points of administration. Additional\ndetails about all data collection procedures, psychometric\nproperties of the instruments, and descriptions of how\ncomposites were derived and constructed can be found in\nthe study's Manuals of Operation and Instrument Docu-\nmentation (http://secc.rti.org).\nMeasures\nDemographic Characteristics\nChild gender and maternal education level were obtained\nby maternal report at 1 month. Family income was reported\nby mothers at each major data collection point (1 month\nthrough age 15) and converted to an income-to-needs ratio\nby dividing total family income by the US Census-based\npoverty-level income for that family size. Ratios used in\nanalyses were averaged from data obtained at 1 month\nthrough 15 years. Child race/ethnicity was coded as\n1 = White/non-Hispanic, 0 = all others represented in the\ncohort (Hispanic, African American, Asian, Native Amer-\nican, biracial, or other).\nMaternal Sensitivity\nEarlier Maternal Sensitivity Our measure of earlier\nmaternal sensitivity was calculated from mothers' behavior\nduring a videotaped interaction between mother and child\n54 months, and grades 1, 3, and 5 (NICHD Early Child\nmaternal sensitivity was created at each age from coding of\nthe videotapes for developmentally appropriate indicators\nof sensitivity. These composites were transformed to the\nsame scale and averaged from 6 months to Grade 5\n(standardized a = .83).\nContemporaneous Maternal Sensitivity Contemporane-\nous sensitivity was assessed at age 15, via coding of a\nvideo-recorded 8-min home discussion of one or two areas\nof disagreement between the adolescent and mother (e.g.,\nchores, homework, money), selected by the adolescent (this\nvariable was standardized for analyses). Seven-point rating\nscales of the interaction were used, with higher scores\nindicting higher levels of sensitivity (M. T. Owen et al.,\n2006, Unpublished manuscript), based on adaptations of\nthe more micro-analytic coding systems of Allen and his\ncolleagues (J. P. Allen et al., 2003, Unpublished manu-\nscript) and coding systems used at earlier ages in the\nNICHD SECCYD (e.g., M. T. Owen et al., 2000, Unpub-\nlished manuscript). Interrater reliability (intraclass\ncorrelation) was .86.\nPeer Competence\nEarlier Peer Competence We assessed earlier peer\ncompetence using mother reports on an a priori, internally\nconsistent peer competence sub-scale derived from the\nSocial Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham and Elliott\nand grades 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. (Standardized alphas for these\nscales at each assessment point ranged from .70 to .80;\nmean = .75). These scales were, in turn, averaged to form\na single measure of early peer competence (standardized\nContemporaneous Peer Competence At age 15, we\nassessed contemporaneous peer competence using the\nz-score of the same sub-scale (i.e., peer competence) of the\nSSRS (standardized a = .81), again as reported by moth-\ners, with higher scores indicating higher levels of peer\ncompetence. (Note that maternal reports were used at age\n15 to maintain consistency with the earlier assessments).\nRomantic Relationship Quality and Engagement at Age 15\nRomantic Relationship Quality Romantic relationship\nquality was measured using items from the Network of\nRelationships Inventory (NRI; Furman 1996) pertinent to\nromantic relationships that were completed by the partici-\npating adolescents at age 15. Specifically, this slightly\nmodified 29-item measure resulted in ten a priori scales:\ncompanionship, conflict, instrumental aid, intimacy,\nnurturance, affection, admiration, reliable alliance, antag-\nonism, and criticism (the internal consistencies of these\nfurther reduce the number of dependent measures of\nquality, we subjected these NRI sub-scales to a Principal\nComponents Analysis, which yielded evidence for two\ncomponents: (a) positive qualities (i.e., companionship,\ninstrumental aid, intimacy, nurturance, affection, admira-\ntion, reliable alliance; standardized a = .91) and (b)\nnegative qualities (i.e., conflict, antagonism, and criticism;\nstandardized a = .89). Note that only participants currently\nin a romantic relationship at the age 15 assessment com-\npleted the NRI.\nDepth of Romantic Engagement The entire age-15 cohort\ncompleted questions about their depth of engagement in the\nromantic domain. For the current study we used the four\nindicators derived from a set of descriptive items, in\naddition to a measure of sexual behavior, to assess depth of\nromantic engagement. More specifically, the four descrip-\ntive indicators included (a) a Guttman-like composite scale\nof dating experience based on the average of answers given\nto five yes/no questions (I only hang out with same-sex\nfriends [reversed], I go to activities with boys and girls\npresent, I go to dances with boys and girls present, I go out\nat night in group with boys and girls, I go out on dates--but\nwith a group, and I go out on dates--just the two of us), (b)\nLongest romantic relationship (in days), (c) Number of\nserious romantic relationships, and (d) the response to the\nquestion: ``Have you ever been deeply in love?'' To assess\nsexual behavior, participants were also asked how many\ntimes they had ever had oral sex (recoded either to\n0 = never or 1 = one or more times) or engaged in sexual\nintercourse (recoded either to 0 = never or 1 = one or\nmore times) with higher scores indicative of more sexual\ninvolvement. The two sexual behavior indicators were\naveraged.\nResults\nAnalytic Plan\nData were analyzed in two steps. First, we provide\ndescriptive information in order to characterize (a)\ninvolvement in romantic relationships at age 15, as\nreflected in dating, sexual, and romantic engagement for\nthe full cohort and (b) the perceived quality of participants'\nromantic relationships for the sub-set of individuals who\nwere currently dating. Second, we examined early and\ncontemporaneous parenting and peer competence as pre-\ndictors of romantic engagement (for the entire sample) and\nperceived quality (for the currently dating sub-group). We\npresent both correlational data as well as regressions where\nall independent variables were simultaneously entered as\npredictors of each romantic outcome at age 15. A series of\nfollow-up regressions were conducted and reported that\nalso include demographic covariates (i.e., child sex, child\nethnicity, maternal education, and family income-to-needs\nthrough age 15) as predictors in order to examine how\nrobust effects of sensitivity and peer competence were after\naccounting for potential confounds. Note finally that many\nof the analyses reported here had high levels of statistical\npower to detect statistically significant effects--even for\ncorrelations small in absolute magnitude. As such, con-\nsistent with Cohen's (1988) recommendations, we viewed\ncorrelations smaller than r = .10 as of ``trivial'' magnitude.\nDescriptive Data\nDescriptive data on all romantic relationship dependent\nmeasures are presented in Table 1. Measures of engage-\nment in romantic relationships completed by the full cohort\ndemonstrate that, with just a few exceptions focused on\ndating experience, adolescents were not engaging in high\nlevels of romantic involvement at age 15. For example,\nwhereas a strong majority of participants reported going\nout at night with groups of boys and girls, less than half had\nthe experience of dating in groups or in pairs. Similarly,\nparticipants reported that their longest relationships aver-\naged approximately 7 months, they had just over 1 serious\nrelationship to date, they engaged in relatively low levels\nof sexual behavior, and just over a third had ever been\ndeeply in love. Only 22% of the sample reported a current\nromantic relationship. In sum, while a large majority of\nparticipants had some experience in the romantic domain\nby age 15, high levels of engagement were relatively\nuncommon.\nCorrelational Analyses\nAs shown in Table 2, for the full cohort, early and con-\ntemporaneous peer and parent experiences tended to be\nnegatively associated with indicators of intense engage-\nment in the romantic domain. There were, nonetheless,\nseveral exceptions and caveats to this trend that should be\nnoted: (a) a non-significant association between age 15\npeer competence and number of serious romantic rela-\ntionships, (b) the dating experience outcome was trivially\ncorrelated with early and contemporaneous maternal sen-\nsitivity and actually positively associated with both early\nand contemporaneous peer competence, and (c) correla-\ntions between early peer competence and romantic\nengagement, although statistically significant, were trivial\nto small in magnitude.\nFor the 20% of participants who reported being cur-\nrently engaged in a romantic relationship, earlier and later\npeer and parent experiences were, with one exception, all\nsignificantly and non-trivially associated with the per-\nceived quality of participants' romantic relationships at\nage 15, such that higher quality parent and peer experi-\nences were correlated positively with positive features of\nthese relationships and negatively associated with negative\nfeatures. The one exception to this trend was that con-\ncurrent maternal sensitivity was not significantly\ncorrelated with either positive or negative romantic rela-\ntionship quality.\nRegression Analyses\nAs indicated above, all four independent variables (i.e.,\nearlier peer competence, contemporaneous peer compe-\ntence, earlier parent\u00adchild quality, contemporaneous\nparent\u00adchild quality) were entered simultaneously into\nregressions as predictors of romantic engagement (dating\nexperience, longest relationship, number of serious\nromantic relationships, sexual experience, and ever been\ndeeply in love?) and measures of quality (positive, nega-\ntive). (Note that a logistic regression was conducted for\n``Ever deeply in love'' as this outcome variable was\ndichotomous). The robustness of significant effects was\nchallenged by subsequently adding a set of four demo-\ngraphic variables to the regression analyses.\nIn general, earlier maternal sensitivity uniquely and\nnegatively predicted indicators of depth of romantic\nengagement, although some of these effects were attenu-\nated with the addition of demographic covariates (see\nTables 3, 4). One partial exception to this general trend\nwas the regressions predicting dating experience, with age\n15 peer competence positively associated with the\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for romantic relationship outcomes\nVariable n M SD Min Max\nRomantic relationship engagement\nRomantic relationship quality\nNote: The first six indicators under romantic relationship engagement were averaged to form the dating experience composite (the first item was\nreversed prior to aggregation)\noutcome, even with demographic controls in place. Earlier\npeer competence was uniquely predictive of romantic\nquality (see Table 5, Model I). After adding demographic\ncovariates (see Table 5, Model II), this effect remained for\nthe prediction of positive but not negative quality. Earlier\nmaternal sensitivity emerged as a significant predictor of\npositive quality in these more complex models. Note that\nthe variables cumulatively accounted for modest propor-\ntions of the variance in each romantic outcome (3\u00ad8% in\nModel I, which did not include demographic covariates and\n6\u00ad13% in Model II equations, which did include these\ncontrol variables).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study were consistent both with evidence\nthat adolescent romantic relationships reflect current and\npast relationship experiences with parents and peers (Fur-\nman et al. 1999) as well as the notion that the romantic\ndomain may not be a salient developmental task of mid-\nadolescence (Roisman et al. 2004). Specifically, we found\nthat high-quality experiences with parents and peers prior to\nand during adolescence tended to be negatively associated\nwith indicators of intense engagement in this domain for the\nfull NICHD SECCYD cohort, but positively associated with\nthe reported quality of adolescents' romantic relationships\nat age 15 for the sub-set of adolescents engaged in them.\nWe resist the interpretation that evidence that peer and\nparent experiences were negatively correlated with indicators\nof romantic engagement is merely reflective of a kind of\npseudo-intimacythatcharacterizes adolescentswho engagein\na relatively large number of relationships. Instead, given that\nsupportive relationships with parents were associated with a\nwide range of indicators of intense romantic involvement, we\nare more inclined to interpret these findings as suggesting that\nserious engagement of this domain (either in terms of quantity\nof partners or depth of emotional investment) is less than\noptimaldevelopmentally(DaviesandWindle 2000;Neemann\net al. 1995), perhaps in part because it is not until adulthood\nthatintimacy insuch relationships becomes a key challenge of\nWe should also note that, because the theoretical per-\nspectives that framed this analysis do not claim that\nprocesses differ by males versus females, we did not\npresent relevant moderator analyses. Nonetheless,\nTable 2 Correlations among early and age 15 parent\u00adchild quality, early and age 15 peer competence, and indicators of romantic engagement\nand quality at age 15\nParent\u00adchild quality Peer competence Romantic engagement Romantic quality\nexperience\nNote: a 1 = yes, 0 = no. * p \\ .05, ** p \\ .01, *** p \\ .001 (two-tailed). ns are in parentheses\nsupplementary analyses revealed no instance where a sig-\nnificant regression effect was moderated by sex.

We do not present\ndepth of engagement analyses for the romantically\ninvolved sub-group largely because indicators of depth of\nengagement are censored at the low end of the relationship\nquality distribution among such individuals. Indeed, not\nsurprisingly, associations between early and later peer and\nparent experiences and depth of engagement indicators\nfailed to emerge in supplementary analyses focused on the\ncurrently involved sub-sample.\nThe current study has a number of strengths. First,\nmeasures of peer, parent\u00adchild, and romantic relationships\nwere drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of\ndevelopment, resulting in evidence that experiences prior\nto adolescence were uniquely predictive of adolescent\nromantic relationship engagement and quality, above and\nbeyond comparable contemporaneous assessments of par-\nent and peer experience. Second, in no instance were\nassociations between predictors and outcomes overesti-\nmated by the use of a single informant or measure,\nresulting in a relatively conservative test of our hypotheses.\nFinally, this study is among the first to distinguish among\nthe origins of different parameters of functioning in ado-\nlescent romantic relationships (for an excellent theoretical\nThis research is nonetheless limited in several respects.\nPerhaps most critically, although rich information is\navailable on participants in the NICHD SECCYD from\ninfancy through adolescence, data specific to participants'\nromantic relationships are exclusively self-report. Argu-\nably, information regarding involvement in the romantic\ndomain (e.g., number of romantic partners, ever been\ndeeply in love?) is best acquired from the adolescent him or\nherself. However, our assessment of relationship quality\nwas also focused on the adolescents' perceptions of those\nexperiences, an important though by no means compre-\nhensive indicator of interpersonal functioning that is\nideally complemented with observational and other mea-\nsures. Additionally, it should be noted that social\ncompetence data for the current analysis derived exclu-\nsively from maternal-report, and the study, though multi-\nsite, is not based on a nationally representative sample.\nThe current analysis contributes to the literature in a\nnumber of respects. Specifically, results of this study sup-\nport the notion that adolescents' romantic relationships\nreflect the relational history of those involved in them in\nmid-adolescence, both with parents and peers as assessed\nprospectively from infancy forward. In contrast, given\nevidence reported here and elsewhere that supportive early\nand later relationship experiences (particularly with\nparents) are normatively reflected in less intense engage-\nment in the romantic domain in adolescence, it appears that\nadolescent romantic competence--at least by age\n15--should not be regarded as a defining developmental\ntask within which adaptation in adolescence is judged.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which per-\nmits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nAppendix\nCurrent members of the Steering Committee of the NICHD\nEarly Child Care Research Network, listed in alphabetical\norder, are: Jay Belsky (Birkbeck University of London),\nCathryn Booth-LaForce (University of Washington), Rob-\nert H.
