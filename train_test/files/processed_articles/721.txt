President Bill Clinton has proposed\nallowing Americans ages fifty-five to sixty-\nfour to buy into Medicare. The impact of such\npolicies and the need for, and role of, public\ncoverage will depend on the extent to which\nprivate coverage is held by the affected popu-\nlation: those nearing Medicare's eligibility\nage, whatever it ends up being.\nPrior research has documented current pat-\nterns ofhealth insurance coverage in the popu-\nlation that is near Medicare eligibility.1 Private\ncoverage in this population depends critically\non three factors: the propensity of older adults\nto work full time, the likelihood that older\nworkers will hold health insurance coverage,\nand the extent of private health insurance\namong retirees under age sixty-five. We used\ninformation about recent trends in these com-\nponents to project coverage patterns for future\ncohorts of older persons and to assess the sen-\nsitivity of future private health insurance cov-\nerage to changes in these trends.\nn DATA SOURCES. The analysis con-\nducted here used three years of data from the\nMarch Current Population Surveys (CPS)--\nforce and health insurance experience of co-\nhorts of older Americans. The CPS is a na-\nholds that includes demographic and\nlabor-force information, as well as informa-\ntion on source and nature of health insurance\ncoverage. The CPS has used a consistent set of\nhealth insurance questions since 1989; these\nquestions refer to health insurance coverage\nduring the year preceding the survey. Eco-\nnomic conditions in 1992 were worse than in\nwere quite similar.\nJust over half of older Americans who have\nhealth insurance obtain it through a current\nor former employer or spouse's current or for-\nmer employer (Exhibit 1). More than one-fifth\nof persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four obtain\ncoverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or the\nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the\nUniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Finally,\nnearly 10 percent of older persons hold private\ninsurance that is not obtained through a cur-\nrent or former employer. More than 16 percent\nof persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four were\nTo get a better sense of the determinants of\nhealth insurance coverage among older\nAmericans, we compared their coverage to\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nSherry Glied is associate professor and head of the Division of Health Policy and Management at Columbia\nUniversity's Joseph L.

The overall rate of coverage among\npersons ages sixty-one to sixty-four is nearly\nas high as that among the younger group, but\nthe pattern of coverage is quite different. Per-\nsons ages sixty-one to sixty-four are less\nlikely to hold private coverage and much less\nlikely to hold employer-sponsored coverage\nthan are their younger counterparts (although\nthey are more likely to hold public coverage or\nindividually purchased private coverage).\nThis difference is a consequence of the much\nlower rates of employment, especially of full-\ntime employment, in the cohort of persons\nages sixty-one to sixty-four, relative to the\nyounger group. Among persons working full\ntime, those ages sixty-one to sixty-four are\nabout as likely to have health insurance as are\nthose ages forty-five to sixty.\nThe importance of labor-market behavior\nis equally apparent in comparisons within the\ncohort of persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four.\nAmong the most-educated men andwomen in\nthis age group--those with a college de-\ngree--rates of private health insurance cover-\nage are nearly twice as high as among the\nleast-educated group. The difference is princi-\npally a consequence of much lower rates of\nemployer-sponsored coverage in the latter\ngroup. Again, this difference is mainly a result\nof differences in labor-force participation. The\nleast-educated persons are far less likely to be\nworking full time in their early sixties than\nare their more-educated counterparts. The ef-\nfect of this difference is further exacerbated\nby differences in the likelihood that more- and\nless-educated full-time workers obtain\nemployer-sponsored coverage.\nCOVERAGE\nThe private health insurance coverage of older\nHealth Insurance Coverage, Persons Ages 45\u00ad64, By Primary Source Of Coverage\nMedicare\nMedicaid\nCHAMPUS\nTotal public coverage\nEmployer-sponsored\nWorking\nRetired\nDependent\nPrivately purchased insurance\nNo health insurance\nAny health insurancea\nAny private insuranceb\nEmployer-provided health insurancec\nEmployed\nEmployed full time\nEmployed part time\nSOURCE: 1997 March Current Population Survey.\nNOTE: CHAMPUS is Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services.\na Includes all private and public sources of insurance.\nb Includes any source of private insurance coverage.\nc Includes health coverage provided by an employer or by a household member's employer.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Nonetheless, in each\nyear the percentage of the population work-\ning full time is significantly lower among\nolder persons. Not surprisingly, as cohorts\nage, the percentage of persons working full\ntime declines sharply. Although 60 percent of\ning full time when they were ages fifty-three\nto fifty-six, only 31 percent of that cohort\nworked full time when they reached their\nearly sixties. Similarly, 71 percent of persons\nfull time in 1989 when they were ages forty-\nfive to forty-eight, but only 64 percent of this\ncohort worked full time by 1997 when they\nwere ages fifty-three to fifty-six. This pattern\nof declining labor-force participation within a\ncohort is one element in predicting patterns of\nemployer-sponsored insurance for today's\nlate-middle-age workers. Since more of them\nare working today, more are likely to be work-\ning eight years from now.\nAs noted above, at any point in time, older\nfull-time workers are nearly as likely as their\nyounger counterparts are to obtain health in-\nsurance coverage (Exhibit 2). Nonetheless,\ncohorts of older workers have been affected\nby the economywide decline in private health\ninsurance coverage. Over the eight-year pe-\nriod examined here, the percentage of full-\ntime workers in each age group who hold\nhealth insurance coverage has fallen by about\ntwo percentage points. As cohorts of full-time\nworkers have aged, their rates of health insur-\nance coverage have fallen. Although 86 per-\ncent of full-time workers in the cohort born in\nerage when they were ages fifty-three to fifty-\nsix, only 83.3 percent of full-time workers in\nthat cohort held private coverage eight years\nOnly about one-third of persons ages\nsixty-one to sixty-four work full time, so\nchanges in patterns of insurance coverage\namong nonworkers are likely to be particu-\nlarly pronounced among older Americans.

These declines translate into declines in\ncoverage within cohorts of older Americans.\nPrivate health insurance coverage rates for the\nage points as they aged from their mid-fifties\nvate coverage rates for the cohort born in\naged from their early forties (in 1989) to their\nmid-fifties (in 1997). Note that these drops in\ncoverage did not translate one-for-one into\ndeclines in insurance coverage. Growth in\npublic coverage offset more than half of the\ndrop in private coverage.3\nThese declines have been even more acute\namong the least-educated members of this\npopulation--those who did not complete\nhigh school. Although 58 percent of the least-\neducated members of the cohort born in\nthey were in their mid-fifties, only 41 percent\nof this cohort did so eight years later.\nFUTURE\nThe forecasts described below are based on\ntwo premises. First, the private health insur-\nance coverage of persons ages sixty-one to\nsixty-four (and ages sixty-five to sixty-seven\nin the absence of Medicare) is closely linked\nto the coverage patterns that these people ex-\nperienced when they were in their prime\nworking years. Those who held jobs without\nhealth insurance coverage when they were in\ntheir mid-fifties probably will not obtain jobs\nwith coverage ten years later. Retirees who\nlack private coverage in their early retirement\nyears are unlikely to gain it later, either.\nSecond, the change in private coverage\namong those now in their mid-fifties as they\nreach their early sixties depends on the rela-\ntionship between aging and health insurance\ncoverage, a relationship that we assume re-\nmains relatively constant across cohorts.\nBased on these premises, we generate fore-\ncasts of future health insurance coverage by\nsuperimposing information about the link be-\ntween aging and health insurance coverage\nobtained from past cohorts on the current\ncoverage patterns of persons ages fifty-three\nto fifty-six.\nExhibit 4 presents baseline information\nabout today's sixty-one to sixty-four-year-\nolds. Scenario One forecasts coverage pat-\nterns for today's fifty-three to fifty-six-year-\nlabor-market and health insurance behavior\nfollow past trends. Slightly more persons in\nthe older cohort are expected to be working\nfull time in 2005, because more persons ages\nfifty-three to fifty-six are working full time\ntoday than had done so eight years ago.

Similarly, the sharp drop in cover-\nage among nonworkers ages fifty-three to\nfifty-six over the past eight years is expected\nto translate into a lower rate of coverage\namong nonworkers ages sixty-one to sixty-\nfour in 2005. This baseline projection yields a\nrate of private health insurance coverage that\nis 4.5 percentage points lower than today's\nrate. Since the size of the population ages\nsixty-one to sixty-four is also expected to in-\ncrease by 26 percent, this lower rate of cover-\nage translates into an increase of 1.25 million\nin the number of persons ages sixty-one to\nsixty-four who lack private coverage.\nHow will this forecast be affected by\nchanges in the labor-force or health insurance\nexperience of older workers? Changes in So-\ncial Security rules or retirement policies, for\nexample, could encourage more older workers\nto remain in the labor force full time. Scenario\nTwo maintains all of the health insurance pro-\npensity projections as in Scenario One and\nmeasures how high full-time employment\nrates would have to be to restore the private\nhealth insurance coverage rate to its 1997\nlevel. Full-time employment would have to in-\ncrease by nearly 50 percent over today's rate\nto hold coverage constant--an implausibly\nhigh figure. Even under this extremely opti-\nmistic scenario, under which the rate of cover-\nage actually increases, growth in the size of\nthe older population would lead to an increase\nlacking private coverage.\nA slowdown in the rate of growth of health\ninsurance costs might stem the declines in\nprivate coverage among older full-time work-\ners. Scenario Three examines the effect on ex-\npected private coverage levels of holding\nhealth insurance coverage among full-time\nworkers at today's rates. This change would\nhave a small effect on coverage, reducing the\nnumber of people lacking private coverage by\nOne component of President Clinton's pro-\nposal for coverage expansion is to increase\ncoverage among nonworkers. The effect of\nsuch a change is illustrated in Scenario Four.\nIf retiree coverage rates remained at today's\nCurrent And Projected Private Health Insurance Coverage, Persons Ages 61\u00ad64,\nBaseline\nScenario\nOne\nScenario\nTwo\nScenario\nThree\nScenario\nFour\nPercent working full time\nPercent working part time\nPercent not working\nPercent with health insurance\nWorking full time\nWorking part time\nNot working\nTotal with health insurance coverage\nwithout private health insurance\nNOTE: Baseline column denotes the population ages 61\u00ad64 in 1997.

Scenario Three projects health insurance coverage holding constant the probability of having\nhealth insurance coverage, given full-time employment. Scenario Four projects health insurance holding constant the probability\nof having health insurance for those not working.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Again, this assumption\nis extremely optimistic. Prior cohorts experi-\nenced declines in the percentage of nonwork-\ners holding private insurance over time. This\nscenario would require a five-percentage-\npoint increase in this percentage as the cohort\naged. Furthermore, an increase in the avail-\nability of public coverage for nonworkers\nmight lead more people to leave the labor mar-\nket and change the balance of public and pri-\nvate coverage.\nUnder most plausible scenarios both the\nnumber and the percentage of older Ameri-\ncans who lack private insurance coverage are\nlikely to rise over the next decade. Rates of\nprivate coverage among persons ages fifty-\nthree to fifty-six are lower today than they\nwere among this age cohort eight years ago,\nand these lower rates are likely to continue\ninto the future. This problem is likely to be-\ncome even more severe over time because\nrates of employer-sponsored health insurance\ncoverage among baby boomers have been de-\nclining steadily over the past fifteen years.4\nThese results suggest that raising the age\nof eligibility for Medicare in tandem with the\nSocial Security eligibility age is likely to leave\na large number of older Americans without\nprivate coverage. Although raising the age of\neligibility for pension benefits will encourage\nmore older Americans to work, our projec-\ntions suggest that implausibly large increases\nin employment would be needed to offset the\nexpected declines in coverage.\nConversely, expanding Medicare by per-\nmitting older Americans to buy in is unlikely\nto make a significant dent in the number of\nnear-elderly uninsured persons. The decline\nin private insurance coverage is especially se-\nvere among the least-educated members of\nolder cohorts.5 This group is unlikely to be\nable to afford to pay actuarially fair premiums\nfor Medicare coverage. Furthermore, increas-\ning Medicare eligibility might even crowd out\nsome existing private coverage.\nNew policy initiatives are needed to ensure\nthat older Americans, especially those who are\nnot working, can maintain health insurance\ncoverage until they become eligible for Medi-\ncare. These could include new public coverage\nalternatives or policies that would encourage\nthe purchase of long-term, non-employer-\nsponsored private retiree coverage.\nThisresearchwassupportedby anInvestigatorAward\n(to Sherry Glied) from the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation.\nNOTES\n1.
