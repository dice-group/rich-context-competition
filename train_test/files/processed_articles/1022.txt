The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between two forms of helping behavior among\nolder adults--informal caregiving and formal volunteer activity.\nMethods. To evaluate our hypotheses, we employed Tobit regression models to analyze panel data from the first two\nwaves of the Americans' Changing Lives survey.\nResults. We found that older adult caregivers were more likely to be volunteers than noncaregivers. Caregivers who\nprovided a relatively high number of caregiving hours annually reported a greater number of volunteer hours than did\nnoncaregivers. Caregivers who provided care to nonrelatives were more likely than noncaregivers to be a volunteer and to\nvolunteer more hours. Finally, caregivers were more likely than noncaregivers to be asked to volunteer.\nDiscussion. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that caregivers are embedded in networks that provide them\nwith more opportunities for volunteering. Additional research on the motivations for volunteering and greater attention to\nthe context and hierarchy of caregiving and volunteering are needed.\nRESEARCHERS who study social and productive activ-\nities among older adults increasingly focus on the ways in\nwhich the myriad forms of these activities are related to one\nanother (e.g., Moen, Robison, & Fields 1994). A common\nquestion addressed among these studies is whether different\nforms of productive activity are complementary or whether\nparticipation in one activity impedes participation in another\nactivity (e.g., Gallagher 1994). To our knowledge, no study has\ninvestigated the association between informal caregiving and\nformal volunteering--two types of helping behavior taking\nplace in different social contexts. However, a few studies have\nexamined the relationship between care work and other forms\nof social activity; this research literature provides important\nclues guiding our study.\nFormal volunteering, a type of structured helping behavior\ntypically undertaken in public settings, is a discretionary\nactivity for most persons. We defined formal volunteering as\nactivity involving a person's time and effort that is not\ncompensated by regular payment or monetary reward, but is\nfreely undertaken and produces goods and services for\norganizations, and by extension, for other individuals (Wilson\n& Musick, 1997). We focused on volunteer work or service (a\nsocial activity) as compared to voluntary group membership\n(a social status; see Wilson, 2000). Among older adults,\nengagement in volunteer activities in formal settings constitutes\nan important forum for their productive contribution to their\ncommunities and the larger society.\nProviding care informally to persons in one's social network\nis often considered an obligatory activity, especially when the\ncare recipient is a family member. This type of helping\nbehavior is less structured than volunteering and is undertaken\nin private as opposed to public venues. Caregiving is not as\ncommon an activity as volunteering, in that at any given time\na relatively small proportion of the population is arranging for\nor providing care to persons who have a debilitating physical or\nmental health condition. However, when a person assumes\na caregiver role, the commitment of time may be substantial. In\nsome cases (e.g., caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease),\ncaregiving represents an all-encompassing activity that makes it\ndifficult to engage in other productive or social activities. Other\nforms of caregiving are likely to be not so intensive or time\nconsuming (e.g., intermittently providing care for distant\nrelatives or nonrelatives) and, therefore, may allow for engage-\nment in additional productive, social, leisure, and self-\nimprovement pursuits.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether informal\ncaregiving among older adults is related to formal volunteer\nservice. Caregivers may be more likely to volunteer and show\na stronger commitment to volunteer activities as an extension of\ntheir caregiving routines, in part because this activity brings\nthem into increased contact with social networks and\norganizations that provide information about and opportunities\nAmericans' Changing Lives survey to examine these issues.\nIt may also be argued that volunteers are more likely to be\ncaregivers. We suspect that if such a relationship exists, it may\nbe more likely that volunteering puts people into contact with\nothers who are aware of ill or disabled persons who need care.\nThis would be most likely to lead to caregiving opportunities\nfor nonrelatives, because a potential caregiver is likely to be\naware of relatives needing care. In fact, Wilson and Musick\n(1997) found that volunteering predicted informal helping\nbehavior (e.g., helping friends or neighbors with running\nerrands, transportation, etc.) but not the reverse (see also\nGallagher, 1994). However, in this article, we assumed that the\noften obligatory nature of caregiving was more likely to bring\ncaregivers into contact with organizations that need volunteers\nthan is the case for discretionary volunteering. Thus, we\ndeveloped below a framework proposing that caregiving creates\nopportunities and motives for volunteering.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nWhile researchers have apparently not examined the\nassociation between caregiving roles (an often obligatory\nactivity) and volunteer roles (a discretionary activity), there is\na small body of research that considers care work as it relates to\nthe caregivers' capacity to participate in voluntary associations\nand other social pursuits. The findings from these studies are\nequivocal due in part to the employment of idiosyncratic\nsamples, use of alternative measures of caregiving and social\nactivity, and variability in the age groups examined. These\nstudies are nevertheless informative for establishing the\nhypotheses for our investigation of caregiving and volunteering.\nSome research suggests that caregiving impedes the ability to\nengage in productive and social activity. Skaff and Pearlin\n(1992) argued that caregiving for persons with Alzheimer's\ndisease may become so overwhelming as to result in a ``loss of\nself'' and thus fewer social roles are accepted and social activity\nis limited. Other research supports this finding by showing that\nolder caregivers participated in fewer social activities (George\n& Gwyther, 1986), and caregivers who reported high demands\nrelated to their care work also perceived themselves to be in-\nvolved in fewer social activities (Miller & Montgomery, 1990).\nAnother stream of research shows that it is informative to\nconsider the type of caregiving and the time committed to\ncaregiving when considering the effects on social activity and\nbelonging to voluntary associations. This research indicates that\nsome characteristics of caregiving actually lead to increased\nlevels of social activity and organizational membership. Using\ndata from the National Survey of Families and Households,\nHoyert and Seltzer (1992) analyzed the social activities of adult\nfemale caregivers who care for spouses, children or parents. In\ngeneral, they found that caregivers participated in more\norganizations than noncaregivers, suggesting that participation\nin these activities may provide temporary relief from their\ncaregiving responsibilities and burden. They found that female\ncaregivers who care for spouses participate in the fewest social\nactivities and organizations when compared to women caring\nfor nonspouse relatives and others. Women providing care for\nchildren engaged in more activities than noncaregivers, and\nwomen providing care for parents engaged in fewer social\nactivities. They also showed that the longer that their sample of\nwomen were involved in care work, the more likely they were\nto experience negative outcomes.\nFarkas and Himes (1997) employed cross-sectional data from\nthe 1987 National Survey of Families and Households to\nexamine whether middle-aged and older women's caregiving\nroles and employment status positively or negatively impacted\na wide range of voluntary social activities. Focusing on family-\ncentered activities, association with formal groups, and casual\nactivity, they found that caregiving does not reduce participation\nin family activity or formal groups, and at least for middle-aged\nwomen, caregiving was predictive of greater casual activity\n(e.g., recreation, time spent with friends). They also found\nevidence that older women who engaged in paid work and\nprovided care were less likely to engage in family and formal\nactivities, indicating that both roles combined have a dampening\neffect on these types of activities. Examining caregiver-recipient\nmodels, they found that middle-aged women caring for parents\nwere more likely to engage in family and formal activities.\nToward an Explanation for the Link Between\nCaregiving and Volunteering\nHow might care work be linked to volunteer activity and\nunder what circumstances? According to Wilson (2000), there\nare two broad approaches employed to explain why people\nvolunteer. One approach is based on social psychological\nreasoning that attempts to identify how motives, values, and\nbelief systems ``inspire volunteering'' (p. 218). Early sociali-\nzation, educational experiences, and family background\ncharacteristics influence underlying impulses to help others in\nthe public sphere (Wuthnow, 1995). This is sometimes referred\nto as cultural capital. The second approach is a behaviorist\nperspective, focusing on a cost-benefit or rational choice\nframework. Social resources such as social network character-\nistics and family relations, sometimes referred to as social\ncapital (Wilson & Musick, 1997), represent another set of\ncharacteristics increasing the opportunities for and likelihood of\nvolunteering. Also important to this set of arguments are the\ninfluences of employment characteristics, levels and types of\neducation, and income, sometimes referred to as human capital.\nThe caregiving role as related to volunteering encompasses\nfeatures of each broad theoretical approach. Caregiving provides\ncaregivers with unique motivations and opportunities to volun-\nteer in their communities in ways not commonly encountered by\nnoncaregivers. Caregivers typically do not carry out their\nhelping roles in isolation. Assistance is received from organi-\nzations, sometimes at low or no cost to the caregiver, which\nmakes the task of providing care to ill or disabled persons\nresiding in the community easier and more feasible. Receiving\nthis assistance likely produces a sense of gratitude among care-\ngivers, who in turn may feel motivated to repay this debt, in part,\nthrough the act of volunteering, if not directly to the organiza-\ntions providing help, then in a more generalized sense to other\nFurther, caregivers are often embedded in social networks\nthat include other caregivers. Studies show that many primary\ncaregivers have secondary or tertiary helpers--such as adult\nchildren, other relatives, friends, and neighbors--who provide\nfinancial, instrumental, and/or emotional assistance both to the\nperson receiving care and to the caregiver (Mui, Choi, & Monk,\n1998). These helpers form a complex social network that may\nprovide additional information about volunteer opportunities\nwith formal organizations. The social networks of caregivers\nlink them to other persons who may be volunteers, to\ninformation about volunteer programs, and to organizations\nthat seek volunteers (Wuthnow, 1995). Because the service\norganizations that caregivers rely on to assist in the care of an ill\nor disabled person are often underfunded, understaffed, or both,\nthese organizations seek out volunteers to help them fulfill their\nmissions. Caregivers interact with organizations that often have\nthe most need, and thus they are more likely to be asked to\nWe have provided some examples to demonstrate how these\ntwo factors--opportunity and motivation--link caregivers to\nvolunteering. Someone who cares for an elderly parent may\ninteract with formal support organizations such as a senior\ncenter or an adult day care center. The relationship between the\ncaregiver and these organizations puts the caregiver in\nproximity to knowledge about the need for volunteers in these\nunits. Aging services administrators may reach out directly to\nthe caregiver asking him or her to participate in directing center\nactivities or supervising outings for seniors. Caregivers often\nhave valued skills that are developed or enhanced through the\ncaregiving role that are important to volunteer organizations.\nWhen caring for elderly parents, caregivers develop commu-\nnication skills and knowledge about the unique needs of older\nadults, especially those with functional status deficits.\nSimilarly, caregivers who provide care for a seriously ill or\ndisabled person often provide help to the person through\ninteractions with health care service providers (e.g., health\nclinics, hospitals) by making appointments, providing trans-\nportation, interpreting instructions, and helping with prescribed\ntherapies. In the act of interfacing with these organizations on\nbehalf of the care recipient, the informal caregiver learns about\nthese organizations and about opportunities to volunteer. After\nthe connection between the care recipient and health care\nservice provider is finished, or perhaps before, the caregiver\nmay feel a sense of gratitude toward the organization and\nvolunteer her or his time to pay back the help received.\nFinally, a person caring for a relative or friend who may be\nchronically ill (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients, Alzheimer's patients)\nmay volunteer in the political arena. In providing such care, it is\nlikely that the caregiver comes into contact with other persons\nwho also provide care for someone with similar illnesses, either\nin a clinical or hospital setting, hospice, or by belonging to\na support group. By virtue of contact with other caregivers,\ncombined with a desire to improve the conditions of other\npersons with similar serious afflictions, the caregiver may\nbecome politically active by doing volunteer work for a political\norganization, advocacy group, or political candidate. A\ncaregiver may volunteer to work for a candidate running for\npolitical office with a platform containing a progressive stance\non AIDS research or a policy supporting increased government\nsupport for long-term care for persons with Alzheimer's\ndisease. These settings where informal and formal care\ninterface provide sources of information about ways to become\npolitically active as well as social support for such activity,\nmaking it more likely that the current or former caregiver will\nbecome an advocate for change. In sum, we expected\ncaregivers to be more likely than noncaregivers to volunteer\non the basis of their caregiver role and the social networks in\nwhich they are embedded.\nAnother dimension influencing the complex link between\ncaregiving and volunteering concerns characteristics of the\ncaregiver activity. Two dimensions of caregiving considered in\nthis study include the time committed to caregiving and the\nnature of the relationship between the caregiver and care\nrecipient. Some types of caregiving, such as caring for a person\nwith an advanced stage of dementia, require a constant vigil,\nimplying an extraordinary time commitment, taking both\na physical and an emotional toll on the caregiver (e.g., Zarit,\nPersons who give a substantial amount of their time to the\ncaregiver role likely must reduce their commitments to other\nroles, including volunteering. Thus we expected that persons\nproviding a low or modest level of care in terms of hours\ncommitted would be more likely to volunteer than persons\nproviding no care (as noted above) and persons providing\na high amount of care (a curvilinear effect).\nFinally, we expected the type of relationship of the caregiver\nto the care recipient to impact volunteering behavior. Some\ncaregivers do not feel they have a choice with respect to their\ncaregiving responsibilities when the potential care recipient is\na close relative (e.g., a spouse) for reasons of both affection and\nnorms of social obligation (Gerstel & Gallagher, 1993). Thus,\nalthough the literature on spousal caregiving and social activity\nis somewhat sparse, we expected that providing care to a spouse\nwould either have no relationship to volunteering or at least\nreduce the likelihood that a person engages in volunteer activity\nand reduce the time commitment to such activity. This\nexpectation is supported by the fact that caring for a spouse\ntends to occur in one's own home (among persons who are\n50 years old and older in the Americans' Changing Lives sur-\nvey, more than 90% of spousal caregiving is provided in the\nrespondent's home). Caring for someone in one's home may\nlimit the number of social network contacts often necessary for\nlocating volunteer activities.\nResearch literature reporting on the relationship between\nparticipation in other activities and caregiving for children and\nparents is equivocal. Nevertheless, following research by\nFarkas and Himes (1997), we expected that caring for a parent\nor a child would result in more volunteering, given that there\nare numerous organizations and support groups whose mission\nis to provide formal help to older persons and children and that\ncaregivers are likely to come into contact with these\norganizations. Finally, persons providing care to more distant\nrelatives and nonrelatives (e.g., friends and neighbors) likely\nhave a greater sense of discretion in these activities and more\nflexible schedules. Caregiving provided to distant relatives and\nnonrelatives provides many of the same opportunities for\nvolunteering but fewer of the barriers related to the often\nintense emotional and time commitment provided to close\nrelatives. Comparing each of the five types of care recipients,\nwe expected that those caring for persons where social\nobligation and emotional intensity are likely to be weaker\n(e.g., other relatives and nonrelatives) would have a stronger\nattachment to the volunteer labor force.\nMETHODS\nData. --In this study, we used data taken from the\nAmericans' Changing Lives survey (ACL; see House, 1995).\nThe ACL is a complex panel survey with a multistage area\nprobability sample design. We used the first two waves of the\nsurvey. The baseline survey obtained information from 3,617\nrespondents aged 25 and older in 1986. Blacks and individuals\nolder than age 60 were oversampled. The second wave of the\nthe original respondents. Our research used two waves of these\ndata so that the temporally causal relationships among our\nmeasures of caregiving and volunteer activities would be\neffectively gauged. The study sample was based on middle-\nstudy sample was restricted to those participating in both the\nwere based on weighted data, using the T2 person weight\nprovided in the ACL.\nMissing values were addressed through imputation. There\nwere 16 missing cases on the attitudes about helping others\nquestion that were assigned the modal category of strongly\nagree. For family income, there were 158 missing cases (9.8%),\nand values were imputed by the ACL survey staff using\ninformation on mean education, marital status, home owner-\nship, and occupation.\nAs with most panel surveys based on a probability sample\ndesign, selection bias due to attrition across the two waves of\nthe ACL may negatively impact generalizability. To account\nfor this possibility, we employed a two-stage sample selection\nestimation technique following Heckman (1979). We predicted\ninclusion in the study sample with a regression model that\nincluded the interviewer's perception of the respondent's level\nof cooperation at T1 (instrumental variable), age, number of\nhealth conditions, and sex. This strategy yielded an estimate of\nthe likelihood () of inclusion in both waves of the survey. We\nsubsequently included a lambda term in all of the multivariate\nregression analyses reported in this study. In addition, we\nadjusted the standard errors of the coefficients of the regression\nmodels for the complex sample design of the ACL by using the\ninterval regression (INTREG) procedure found in STATA 8.1\n(StataCorp, 2003; see below). Without this adjustment, there\nwas a chance that the standard errors would be biased\ndownward, yielding misleading inferences about relationships\namong affected variables.\nMeasurement. --Respondents to the ACL survey were asked,\n``During the last 12 months, did anyone ask you to volunteer\nyour time?'' (yes or no). Respondents who indicated they\nparticipated in one or more activities were also asked,\n``Altogether, about how many hours did you spend on\nvolunteer work of (this kind/these kinds) during the last 12\nmonths?'' We provided the amount of time spent volunteering\nacross all types of organizations reported in the survey in the\nprevious year at the median of the five original categories (see\nTable 1) as 0 hr (for those who reported no volunteering in the\n(the ACL does not report time commitment for specific types of\nactivity). Our dependent variable was the number of hours\ncommitted to volunteering observed at T2.\nThe key independent variables captured several dimensions\nof caregiving behavior; unless otherwise noted, we took all\nindependent variables from T1. The ACL survey asked the\nfollowing question: ``Now I would like to talk with you about\nfriends and relatives who have trouble taking care of themselves\nbecause of physical or mental illness, disability, or for some\nother reason. Are you currently involved in helping someone\nlike this by caring for them directly or arranging for their care?''\nThe survey also asked respondents about their relationship to\nthe person they provide the most care to and the number of\nhours of care provided during the last 12 months (reported in the\nrepresent the midpoints of the original survey categories).\nWe defined caregiving status by a dichotomous variable: 1 \u00bc\ncaregiver, 0 \u00bc not a caregiver. We measured intensity of care-\ngiving in time committed during the previous 12 months. We\ncreated three dichotomous variables to measure time committed\nto caregiving, where 10 to 30 hr equaled low commitment, 60 to\nhigh commitment (reference group is 0 hr). In Table 1, we\nreported the weighted means of the midpoints of the volunteer-\ning and caregiving hours variables in Panel A and the frequency\ndistribution of the categories of hours committed to these\nactivities in Panel B. We measured caregiver's relationship to\nthe care recipient with five dichotomous variables: cares for\nspouse, cares for a child, cares for a parent, cares for another\nrelative, and cares for a nonrelative (the reference group was\nrespondents who reported no caregiving). The survey ques-\ntion referred to the person to whom the caregiver provides the\nmost help.\nHuman capital concepts were represented by indicators that\ninclude education, measured by number of years of formal\neducation completed (range \u00bc 0\u00ad18\u00fe), and health, measured\nwith a cumulative index that summed four indicators of\nlimitations with activities of daily living (ADLs; range \u00bc 0\u00ad4).\nThe ADL indicators included whether the respondent has\ndifficulty bathing, difficulty climbing a few flights of stairs,\ndifficulty walking several blocks, or difficulty doing heavy\nhousework such as washing walls or shoveling snow. If the\nrespondent indicated that they had some difficulty, a lot of\ndifficulty, or they could not do the activity at all, the respondent\nwas considered to have a limitation with this activity. We\ncreated three dummy variables for limitations with ADLs\nacross the two waves: number of limitations with ADLs\nincreased, number of limitations with ADLs decreased, and\nnumber of limitations remained the same (reference group).\nSocial capital (social network) was represented by two\nmeasures. The first is an index of informal social activity,\ncombining responses from two questions relating to how often\nthe respondent talks with friends and neighbors and how often\nshe or he visits with friends and neighbors (range \u00bc 0\u00ad10). The\nresponse options were never, less than once a week, about once\na week, two or three times a week, once a day, and more than\nonce a day. The second measure was informal social network\nsize, based on a question asking respondents to give the number\nof persons he or she could call on for help (``About how many\nfriends or relatives do you have whom you could call on for\nadvice or help if you needed it?''). The measure ranged from 0 to\n40 (top-coded at 40 to account for extreme right-hand skew).\nFollowing Wilson & Musick (1997), we measured helping\nvalues (cultural capital) by the respondent's level of agreement\n(strongly agree to strongly disagree) to the following statement:\n``Life is not worth living if one cannot contribute to the well-\nbeing of other people.'' The scores ranged from 1 to 4, where\na higher score indicated a higher level of agreement with this\nsocial value.\nDemographic variables included gender (1 \u00bc female; 0 \u00bc\nmale), race (1 \u00bc white, 0 \u00bc other), marital status (1 \u00bc married,\n0 \u00bc other), age in years (range \u00bc 50\u00ad96), and age squared (to\ncapture the possible curvilinear impact of life cycle stage on\nvolunteer activity). We measured paid work activity by the\nnumber of hours of work reported in the 12 months prior to the\ninterview (logged). We measured income by self-reports of\nfamily income in the 12 months prior to the interview (given in\nAnalytic Strategy. --Our dependent variable, hours of\nvolunteering in the past year at T2, was truncated in that\nmore than 50% of the sample reported no volunteer hours.\nOrdinary least squares regression techniques were not em-\nployed because this technique may yield biased results when\nemployed with censored data. The bias may occur because two\nsubstantively interesting features of volunteer behavior were\ncaptured in the dependent variable volunteer hours: (1) the\ndecision to volunteer, and (2) for those who choose to\nvolunteer, how much to volunteer. We did not assume that\nthe factors that predicted one part of the decision process\nimpacted the other part in the same way. Thus, we employed\nTobit regression techniques to estimate our models because this\napproach takes into consideration the truncated nature of our\n(StataCorp, 2003) to estimate our models. Because the Tobit\nregression routine does not allow for the use of weights or to\nadjust the standard errors to account for clustering of cases in\nthe sample design, we used the INTREG procedure with the\nrobust error estimation and cluster options (Hardin, 2001). We\nmodified the interval regression method to replicate the Tobit\nregression model, yielding coefficients based on weighted data\nwith standard errors adjusted for the complex sample design.\nTobit regression modeling techniques generate a single\ncoefficient predicting the underlying behavior of whether to\nvolunteer and how much time to commit to volunteering. This\ncoefficient did not provide a direct interpretation of the two\nprocesses. Therefore, following a strategy proposed by Roncek\n(1992), we decomposed the estimated coefficient into a part that\nindicated the probability of volunteering and a part that indicated\nthe effect of the independent variables on the number of hours of\nvolunteering (see also Musick, Wilson, & Bynum, 2000). We\nreported both the original Tobit regression coefficients and the\ndecomposition of the coefficient into its two constituent parts.\nWe estimated two types of models to evaluate the effect of\neach dimension of caregiving on whether a person is a volunteer\nand the number of hours volunteered. We estimated the total\nTable 1.

Next, for each dimension of caregiving, we estimated\nmodels that included our full set of control variables, providing\nestimates of the net (adjusted) effects.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for the study sample.\nAmong those respondents in the ACL survey aged 50 and older\nat first interview, 38.4% reported volunteering for a religious\nor secular organization in the 12 months prior to the second\ninterview. Approximately one fifth of the sample (21.3%)\nreported providing care or arranging for care for someone with\na disability or illness at first interview. Table 1 also provides\na breakdown for measures of caregiving, resources, and other\npersonal characteristics at T1 according to whether the respon-\ndent was a volunteer at T2.

For each analysis, we reported the unstandardized\nTobit regression coefficients (and standard errors) along with\na decomposition of the coefficients that includes an estimate of\nthe probability of being a volunteer along with an estimate of\nthe number of hours of volunteering for those who were\nvolunteers. In Table 2, the number of volunteer hours reported\nat T2 was regressed on caregiver status at T1. The unadjusted\n(or total) effect shows that caregivers volunteered more hours\nthan noncaregivers (see Model 1). Based on the decomposition\nof the unstandardized Tobit coefficient, we can see that the\nprobability of being a volunteer was 10.9% higher for\ncaregivers than noncaregivers, and caregivers reported 9.33\nmore hours of volunteering annually than did noncaregivers.\nIn Model 2, we reported the results of the full model\n(adjusted or net effects). The effect of caregiver status on\nvolunteering remained marginally statistically significant,\nwith a 43% reduction in the unstandardized Tobit regression\ncoefficient. Net of the control variables in the model, caregivers\nwere 6.6% more likely to be volunteers than were non-\ncaregivers, and caregivers contributed 5.4 more hours of\nvolunteering annually than did noncaregivers. As with previous\nresearch (see Wilson & Musick, 1997), we also found that\nhigher levels of human capital (education, income), social\ncapital (informal network activities and size), and cultural\ncapital (helping values) also predicted higher levels of\ncommitment to volunteering among middle-aged and older\nadults. In general, the results presented in Table 2 supported our\nexpectation that caregivers would be more likely than non-\ncaregivers to be volunteers and volunteer more hours.\nIn Table 3 we have reported the results of the number of\nhours of volunteer activity regressed on the number of hours of\ncaregiving. Contrary to our expectations, persons with modest\nlevels of caregiving time commitment were not more likely\nthan noncaregivers to be volunteers. Rather, middle-aged and\nolder adults who reported 200 or more hours of caregiving (the\nhighest amount of caregiving hours reported) were more likely\nthan persons reporting no caregiving hours to be volunteers and\nvolunteer more hours. We have presented the unadjusted effects\nin Model 1, whereby persons reporting 200 or more hours of\ncaregiving were 12.3% more likely to be volunteers as\ncompared to noncaregivers, and these high-commitment care-\ngivers volunteer 10.5 more hours per year than noncaregivers.\nWe have presented the adjusted effects in Model 2. Although\nthe strength of the effect of caregiving hours on volunteer hours\nwas reduced in size, the same pattern found in Model 1\nemerged.

Those who provided care to a non-\nrelative were 18% more likely to be volunteers and volunteer\n14.5 more hours than those reporting no caregiving.\nIf our expectations about caregivers having unique in-\nformation about and opportunities for volunteering were\naccurate, then we might have expected that caregivers were\nasked to volunteer more than noncaregivers. We investigated\nthis possibility by regressing a variable describing whether\npersons were asked to volunteer at T2 (yes or no) on our three\ndimensions of caregiving and on our set of control variables\n(logistic regression analysis; see Table 5). The results showed\nsupport for this idea. Caregivers were more likely than\nnoncaregivers to be asked to volunteer. In addition, persons\ncommitted to a modest or high level of caregiving in terms of\nannual hours reported were also more likely to be asked to\nvolunteer than noncaregivers. Finally, persons providing care\nto parents were more likely to be asked to volunteer than\nnoncaregivers. The remaining types of care recipients appeared\nto show no relationship with being asked to volunteer.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analyses support the central thesis of this study that\ncaregivers report more volunteer activity than noncaregivers; we\nfound in our regression analyses that caregivers are more likely\nto be volunteers than noncaregivers, and they report more hours\nof volunteering. We also found that those who are most\ncommitted to caregiving in terms of hours of care work reported\nare more likely to be volunteers and report more hours of\nvolunteering. We expected, but did not find, a curvilinear effect,\nwhere those providing a modest amount of care would be most\nlikely to be volunteers. It may be that the ACL variable for\ncaregiving hours, truncated at 200 or more hours, is not sensitive\nenough to capture such an effect. In other words, if a continuous\nmeasure of caregiving were available without truncation, we\nmay have calibrated our measures of low, modest, and high\ncommitments differently. Persons reporting 200 hr of caregiving\nare providing, on average, about four hours of caregiving\nper week. This would not be considered a high amount of\ncaregiving for persons who provide care to someone with\nAlzheimer's disease. More research is need on this question.\nFinally, caregivers of nonrelatives are more likely than\nnoncaregivers to be engaged in volunteering and commit more\ntime to volunteering. These findings are generally consistent\nwith the results of Farkas and Himes' (1997) study of caregiving\neffects on social activity and formal voluntary association. We\ndid not find that spousal caregivers were less likely to be\nvolunteers than noncaregivers, as we had predicted. One reason\nmay be that spousal caregivers are older than noncaregivers (in\nthe ACL, the average age difference is 5.6 years). Given that\nvolunteering has been shown to decrease with age (however, see\nHendricks & Cutler, 2004) may explain the lack of a relationship\nin our analyses. We also note that we found no interaction\neffects among age and caregiver status and the other control\nvariables (including ADL limitations) that might further explain\nvolunteering behavior.\nWe posited that caregivers would be exposed to more\nopportunities for caregiving than noncaregivers and that this\nexposure would also result in caregivers being more likely to be\nasked to volunteer. Our analyses support this argument as well.\nA cross-tabulation of the asked to volunteer variable with the\nvolunteer status variable among our sample respondents shows\nthat 72.3% of those asked to volunteer in the last 12 months\nalso reported volunteering in the last 12 months. We regressed\nvolunteer hours on whether a person was asked to volunteer,\nincluding controls for caregiving status, along with controls for\ndemographic and resource characteristics (results available\nupon request). We found that those who are asked to volunteer\nare more likely to volunteer than those who are not asked and\nthat the inclusion of the asked to volunteer variables reduces the\neffect of caregiving variables to statistical nonsignificance. This\nmay mean that being asked to volunteer mediates the effects of\ncaregiver status and commitment, which is consistent with the\nidea that caregivers are embedded in social networks and have\ncontact with organization personnel that ask them to volunteer.\nHowever, because the asked to volunteer question in the ACL\nsurvey was not asked at T1, we cannot be certain of the\ndirection of the causal relationship between volunteering and\nbeing asked to volunteer. It is possible that persons who\nvolunteer are also more likely to be asked to volunteer than\nnonvolunteers. A definitive analysis of this issue is beyond the\nscope of this study.\nIt is likely that opportunities for volunteering are combined\nwith motivations for volunteering among caregivers. With the\nACL data, we are not able to measure specific motivations for\nvolunteering. We assumed that our measure of helping values is\nan indirect measure of motivation to volunteer, but we do not\nfind any interaction effect between this general measure of\nvolunteering motivation and caregiver status. It may also be\nthat many caregivers use their social networks to get involved\nin volunteer activity as a means of spending time away from\ncaregiving routines and the associated sense of burden or stress.\nTable 5.

All models include controls for age, age squared, female,\nwhite, marital status, employment hours, income, help values, ADL limitations,\ninformal social activity, social network size, and lambda. *p .05; **p .01;\nSome caregivers may find that volunteering provides a respite\nfrom the rigors of caregiving and perhaps provides them with\na form of social support. Thus, caregivers may have self-\nprotective motivations that include making efforts to maintain or\nimprove their own physical and emotional health, while car-\nrying out the challenges posed by the caregiver role. The ACL\ndata do not allow us to investigate this issue, but if data become\navailable, researchers should more closely investigate the moti-\nvations for volunteering among caregivers and noncaregivers.\nIt is also possible that in the population of older persons there\nmay be a class of individuals who could be characterized as\n``super-helpers'' or ``doers.'' That is, some persons have high\ncommitments to helping others in both the private and public\ndomains, and they possess the necessary resources to act on\nthese commitments. These people likely find the time and\nenergy to engage in both types of activity and are self-selected\ninto these activities (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001). We are unable to\nmeasure these underlying personality characteristics with these\ndata and believe new data need to be collected to capture\nimportant motivational characteristics and personality traits that\nmay be associated with being a super-helper. Theoretical\nconcepts that may help identify this class of super-helpers\nwould include, but are not limited to, emotional IQ, self-\nefficacy, and a wide array of specific personal motivations for\nhelping others.\nTo further explore the relationship between caregiving and\nvolunteering, we also estimated change models of volunteer\nactivity (results available upon request). We included in our\nmodel of volunteer activity at T2 a measure of volunteer status at\nT1, along with the other variables reported above. Not\nsurprisingly, volunteer status at T1 is the strongest predictor\nof volunteer hours at T2, evidence of the stability of volunteer\nbehavior over time. In these change models, nearly all of the\ndimensions of caregiving failed to reach statistical significance.\nHowever, after controlling for volunteer status at T1 and the\nother control variables, we found that those who care for\nnonrelatives report a greater number of volunteer hours at T2\nthan those who are not engaged in caregiving. The fact that most\nof the caregiving variables do not reach statistical significance\ncould be a substantive finding or it could be a statistical artifact\nrelated to the correlation among the T1 volunteer status variable\nand the other T1 predictors.\nTo examine this issue more closely, we created a productive\nactivity measure at T1 with the following categories: (1) no\nvolunteer or caregiving activity; (2) volunteer activity; (3)\ncaregiver activity; and (4) caregiving and volunteer activity. We\ncompared this measure of productive activity at T1 with\nvolunteer activity at T2. An interesting hierarchy emerged.\nPersons who engaged in no volunteer or caregiving activity at\nT1 report about as much volunteer activity at T2 as those who\nreport caregiving activity only. Those who reported volunteer-\ning at T1 reported the next highest level of volunteering at T2,\nand those who reported volunteering and caregiving at T1\nreported the highest level of volunteering at T2. This may be\nfurther evidence to support the idea that persons engaged in\nmultiple social networks (caregiving and volunteering net-\nworks) have the most opportunity and motivation to engage in\nproductive activity in later life. More research is needed to\ndetermine how specific types of productive activity cluster\ntogether and to determine the impacts of such clustering.\nLimitations of this study include the relative age of the ACL\ndata. Although these are currently the best panel data available\nfor examining the questions posed here, it is possible that more\nrecent cohorts of middle-aged and older adults exhibit different\npatterns of relationships among caregiving and volunteering\nactivities. Nevertheless, the ACL data remain valid for\nhypothesis testing. While the data on caregiving in the ACL\nare better than most other sources, it would be helpful to have\nmore detail on types of caregiving, hours committed to specific\ntypes of caregiving, specific information on motivations for\ncaregiving and volunteering, along with individuals' history of\ncaregiving and volunteering.\n"
