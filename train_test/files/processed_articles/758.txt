Johnson, PhD,1 Usha Sambamoorthi, PhD,2 and Stephen Crystal,\nPension benefits from past employers are an im-\nportant source of retirement income. In 1994, annual\nprivate pension income averaged $4,330 among eld-\nerly pension recipients, accounting for 24% of their\nhousehold income (Grad, 1996). For persons nearing\nretirement in 1992, pension wealth, defined as the\npresent value of the stream of future expected pen-\nsion benefits, equaled 23% of total household wealth,\nalmost as large as the share of total wealth attribut-\nable to future Social Security benefits (Custman, Mit-\nchell, Samwick, & Steinmeier, 1997). Pensions have\nalso been growing in importance over time. For ex-\npersons received income from private pensions, com-\ncrease in private pension receipt continues, and if bud-\ngetary pressures on the Social Security system limit the\ngenerosity of public pensions, then private pensions\nare likely to become an even more significant source\nof income for upcoming generations of retirees.\nAn important concern for pension policy is the un-\nequal distribution of benefits. In 1993, for example,\nonly 56% of full-time wage and salary workers were\ncovered by a pension plan on their current job (U.S.\nDepartment of Labor, 1994). Workers with pension\ncoverage tend to be economically advantaged in other\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Pension\nand Welfare Benefits Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor,\ncomputing assistance from Kaila Simmons, and research assistance from\nAyse Akincigil.

For example, covered workers are pre-\ndominantly White and well educated, work for large,\nunionized firms, and earn high wages (e.g, Turner &\naccumulated pension wealth among persons aged 51\nto 61 was more unequally distributed than overall\nhousehold wealth, which itself is known to follow a\nvery skewed distribution. The unequal distribution of\npension income may be responsible in part for the\ngreater inequality in income observed in later life than\nat younger ages (Crystal & Shea, 1990; Crystal &\nDifferences in pension wealth are especially pro-\nnounced between men and women. Among full-time\nprivate sector workers, only 43% of women had pen-\nsion coverage on their current job in 1988, compared\nappear to be even larger among retirees and persons\nnearing retirement. For example, within a sample of\nnew Social Security beneficiaries in 1982 who had\nonly 36% of women received private pension income;\namong pension recipients, the mean pension benefit\nfor women was only 55% as large as the mean ben-\nefit for men (Even & Macpherson, 1994). McGarry\nreceiving pension income or expected to receive\nbenefits in the future from a current or past job, com-\npared with only 52% of women. Moreover, for indi-\nviduals with current or expected pension benefits, they\nestimated that pension wealth was 40% greater for\nmen than for women. McGarry and Davenport's esti-\nmates were based on self-reports of expected future\nbenefits, which may not be very accurate because\nmany people have only limited knowledge of the de-\ntails of their pension plans (Mitchell, 1988). Gustman\nand colleagues (1997) analyzed detailed pension plan\ninformation collected from pension providers and\nreached similar conclusions: Among married persons\nwas only one fourth as large as men's.\nAlthough the existence of gender differences in pen-\nsion wealth is well established, the underlying causes\nof the differential are less well understood. Women\nmay accumulate less pension wealth than men for a\nnumber of different reasons. In virtually all pension\nplans, benefits are based on past earnings and time\nspent on the job. In traditional defined benefit plans,\npension income is generally computed as a specified\nfraction of some measure of final earnings times years\nof job tenure. In defined contribution plans, where\nfuture benefits are determined by the amount of\nfunds that have accumulated in the worker's individual\naccount, account balances typically increase over time\nwhile plan contributions from both employers and em-\nployees generally increase with wages. Thus in both\ntypes of plans, men with higher earnings and more\nyears of job experience would receive higher benefits\nthan women with lower earnings and fewer years of\nseniority.\nWomen may also be sorted into jobs that offer low\npension benefits. Defined benefit plans often impose\nfinancial penalties for leaving employment before re-\ntirement, because benefits are generally based on\na nominal measure of final earnings, which erodes\nin value with inflation. Firms may backload compen-\nsation in this way until the end of the career as a\nmeans of reducing turnover and the hiring and train-\ning costs associated with it (Allen, Clark, & McDermed,\nsee Appendix, Note 1). Firms may also offer pensions\nas a means of eliciting effort from workers when\nmonitoring performance is difficult, because workers\nwho are caught shirking and are fired would forfeit\nthe generous pension benefits they would have other-\nwise earned near the end of the career (Lazear, 1979).\nWomen, however, may avoid jobs that backload\ncompensation with defined benefit plans if they\nanticipate that child-rearing responsibilities will leaa\nto intermittent work histories. Similarly, firms may\navoid hiring women for jobs with substantial specific\ntraining requirements, which often offer generous\npension plans (Johnson, 1996), because women tend\nto have higher turnover rates than men (see Appen-\ndix, Note 2).\nPrevious studies have highlighted the importance\nof earnings differences between men and women in\nexplaining the gender gap in pensions. Even and Mac-\npherson (1994) found that about one half of the\ndifferential in pension benefits, among pension recipi-\nents, was attributable to the relatively low earnings\nof women on their longest career job. Differences in\njob tenure, total labor market experience, full-time\nstatus, education, industry, and occupation explained\nlittle of the gender gap. However, since Even and\nMacpherson's (1994) findings were based on a sample\nof persons who retired in 1982, it is unclear how well\nthey describe pension differences among workers\ncurrently in the labor force. The patterns of pension\nincome received by women who retired 15 years ago\nmay differ substantially from the patterns that will be\nobserved for the next cohort of retirees, because of\nthe dramatic changes in the labor market experiences\nof married women that have occurred over the past\n30 years. In addition, to compare the level of pension\nbenefits that men and women earn in the labor mar-\nket, it may be preferable to study a sample of current\nworkers approaching retirement rather than a sample\nof retirees. Although information on pension income\nreceived by retirees can offer insights into questions\nabout the adequacy of pension income, it does not\nnecessarily offer the best data to investigate how the\nlabor market compensates workers in the form of pen-\nsion benefits. Gender differences in pension income\nreceived during retirement do not always reflect dif-\nferences in pension wealth earned on the job. For\nexample, retirement income depends in part on a num-\nber of factors that do not affect expected pension\nwealth earned on the current job, including the age\nat which persons choose to begin receiving pension\nincome, the way in which they choose to receive\npensions (as a single annuity instead of a joint life\nannuity, for instance), and the amount of benefits re-\nceived earlier in the life course as lump sum distribu-\ntions from retirement plans.\nThis article investigates gender differences in pen-\nsion coverage and pension wealth on the current job\nfor a sample of workers approaching retirement and\nthe factors responsible for the differentials between\nmen and women. The gender gap in pension wealth\nhas important policy significance, because it may con-\ntribute to the very high rates of poverty among di-\nvorced and widowed women at older ages (Hurd &\nWise, 1989). Large differences in pension wealth\nbetween men and women may also exacerbate the\nwell-known gender inequalities in wages (Blau, 1998).\nTo improve the accuracy of our estimates of pension\nwealth, we utilized data collected from pension pro-\nviders, which include detailed information about plan\nprovisions. We found that differences between men\nand women in pension coverage on the current job\nwere small but significant in a sample of full-time workers\napproaching retirement. However, gender differences\nin pension wealth conditional on coverage were quite\nlarge. Among full-time workers with coverage, median\npension wealth on the current job was 76% greater\nfor men than women. We found that most of the gen-\nder gap in pension wealth could be attributed to\ndifferences in wages, industry, and job experience be-\ntween men and women.\nData\nThe data for our study came from the first wave of\nthe Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is an\nespecially rich source of information on pension wealth\nfor a large sample of persons nearing retirement. Con-\nducted by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the\nUniversity of Michigan, in 1992 the HRS interviewed\na nationally representative sample of men and women\naged 51 to 61 and their spouses (regardless of age)\nand resurveyed them every two years. The baseline\nholds, including oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and\nFlorida residents. Information was collected on the in-\ncome, assets, employment history, health, demographics,\nand family structure and financial transfers of the re-\nspondents (see Juster & Suzman, 1995, for additional\ninformation about the HRS).\nHRS respondents were asked a detailed series of\nquestions about-their entitlements to future pension\nbenefits. Persons who reported being part of pension\nor retirement plans sponsored by their employers or\nunions were questioned about the number of plans\nin which they were included, and for each plan they\nwere asked about plan type (defined benefit, defined\ncontribution, or some combination of the two), the\nnumber of years they had participated in the plan,\nthe age at which they expected to begin receiving\nbenefits, and the amount they expected to receive at\nthat age. In addition, respondents with defined con-\ntribution plans were asked about the balance in their\npension accounts and the amounts they and their em-\nployers each contribute to the plan. These data are\nlikely to provide reliable information on pension cov-\nerage, because persons approaching retirement gen-\nerally know whether they belong to pension plans.\nHowever, it is less clear that respondents are able to\nreport accurately their future expected pension ben-\nefits. For example, Mitchell (1988) found that many\npersons do not have detailed knowledge of their pen-\nsion plans.\nInstead of basing our estimates of pension wealth\non questionable self-reported data, we used more re-\nliable information collected from pension providers (see\nAppendix, Note 3). Respondents who reported par-\nticipating in pension plans were asked to supply the\nnames and addresses of the employers (or unions) who\nsponsored the plans. Summary plan descriptions, which\nprovide information about retirement ages, vesting re-\nquirements, employee and employer contributions to\ntrie plan, cost of living adjustments, Social Security off-\nsets, and the formulas with which pension benefits are\nbased, were then collected from the plan administra-\ntors. Some descriptions were also gathered from records\nat the U.S. Department of Labor when HRS staff were\nunable to obtain information from employers.\nDetailed pension information was collected for\n3,834 persons, or about two thirds of the respondents\nwho reported pension coverage at Wave 1. An im-\nportant limitation of the provider data is that HRS re-\nspondents who were successfully linked with summary\nplan descriptions do not represent a random sample\nof respondents with pension coverage. Table 1 reports\nthe percentage of full-time workers in the HRS who\nwere linked to provider data among those who self-\nreported pension coverage on the current job. We\nfound little variation in overall match rates by gender,\nwith 68% of covered male workers and 67% of cov-\nered female workers linked to provider data at Wave\n1. However, the proportion of covered workers linked\nto provider data varied substantially by plan type, firm\nsize, industry, wage, and education. For example, only\nabout 30% of respondents who participated only in\nTable 1.

Match rates were also quite high among\nworkers in public administration and the professional\nservices industry and among well-educated and high-\nwage workers. For example, 95% of covered men and\n92% of covered women working in public administra-\ntion were linked to summary plan descriptions pro-\nvided by their employers. Within subgroups, however,\ngender differences in match rates were generally in-\nsignificant.\nWe accounted for the overrepresentation of par-\nticular subgroups of covered workers in the pension\nprovider sample in two ways. First, we reweighted the\nprovider data so that the distribution of full-time\nworkers by firm size and plan type was consistent with\nthe observed distribution among full-time workers with\npension coverage in the full HRS sample. The weights\nwere computed as the ratio of the proportion of ob-\nservations in the full HRS sample with a given plan\ntype and firm size to the proportion of observations\nin the pension provider sample with the same pen-\nsion plan and firm size. In both samples, the frequency\ncomputations were restricted to full-time wage and\nsalary workers with pension coverage on the current\njob. The largest sample weights were assigned to\nworkers in firms with fewer than 100 employees and\nin defined contribution plans, who were assigned\nwere assigned to workers in firms with 500 or more\nemployees and in defined benefit plans. In the\nweighted provider sample, the distribution of workers\nby key characteristics, such as gender, education, race,\nplan type, firm size, industry, occupation, job tenure,\nand wage, was similar to the distribution of workers\nwho self-reported pension coverage in the first wave\nof the HRS. Second, we accounted for the over-\nrepresentation of particular subgroups of covered\nworkers in the provider sample by applying standard\nselection correction techniques to our multivariate\nestimates, as described in the Methods section.\nWe restricted our sample to age-eligible respon-\ndents who were employed full-time as wage and sal-\nary workers at the time of the survey. We eliminated\nrespondents younger than age 51 or older than age\n61 because they were included in the survey only\nbecause they were married to an age-eligible respon-\ndent, and thus do not represent a random sample of\npersons in their age group. We considered only full-\ntime workers because part-time workers in their fifties\nmay have already retired from their career jobs (Doe-\nringer, 1990), on which they earned the bulk of their\npension wealth. We also eliminated self-employed\nworkers because the determinants of compensation\nmay be quite different for them than for wage and\nsalary workers. Members of the Armed Forces were\ndropped because we were concerned only with the\ncivilian labor market. Our final sample consisted of\nthe age-eligible men in the full HRS sample and 38%\nof the age-eligible women. Our sample of respondents\nwith matched pension plan data, who were further\nrestricted to workers with pension plans on the cur-\nMethods\nTo investigate gender differences in pensions earned\non the current job, we estimated probit models of\npension coverage and, for covered workers, linear re-\ngression models of pension wealth. We also decom-\nposed the gender gap in pension coverage and wealth\ninto the portions attributable to different worker and\njob characteristics.\nComputation of Pension Wealth\nSoftware recently developed by ISR was used to\nestimate pension wealth by combining information on\nwages, years of service, and age with pension param-\neters (see Appendix, Note 4). For defined benefit plans,\nreal pension wealth was defined by Equation 1:\nPW = [T x W x X - + /)-\"?-a)\nwhere T is completed years of job tenure at retire-\nment, W is the final wage base at retirement, expressed\nin 1992 dollars, X is the plan-specific percentage fac-\ntor, <\n|\n) is the reduction in pension benefits due to\nSocial Security integration, R is the retirement age, / is\nthe real interest rate, a is age in 1992, and aR\nis a\nfunction converting a one-dollar lifetime annuity into\nits present value as of the retirement age.\nThe term in brackets in Equation 1 is the value of\nnominal pension benefits that a worker participating\nin the plan can expect to receive during the initial\nyear of retirement. Years of expected joo tenure T\nwas computed by taking the self-reported value of\ntenure on the current job in 1992 and assuming that\nworkers remained with the employer until the assumed\nretirement age. The definition of the final wage base\nW varies by plan, and is specified in the summary\nplan description. In some cases it may be defined as\nthe worker's average annual earnings over the entire\ncareer, whereas in other cases it is defined as annual\nearnings in the final year of employment; typically,\nhowever, it is defined as average earnings over the\npast three to five years. To compute the final wage\nbase at the time of retirement, the ISR program pro-\njected the current 1992 wage as reported by the re-\nspondent forward to the assumed retirement age. Be-\ncause real wages do not generally increase over time\nfor workers approaching retirement age (Custman &\nsumed that the rate of real increase for current earn-\nings was equal to the economy-wide growth in wages\nand that real earnings did not change because of the\nrespondent's progression through the life course. The\npercentage factor X, which was also taken from the\nsummary plan descriptions, is sometimes a step func-\ntion of years of service or of earnings. For cases in\nwhich the pension plan sets benefits equal to a fixed\namount per year of service, independent of earnings,\nW in Equation 1 is set equal to unity and X is set\nequal to the dollar amount per year of service. The\nreduction factor <\n|\n> also takes different forms in differ-\nent plans. In some plans, it is equal to the total amount\nof Social Security benefits the worker is expected to\nreceive at age 65, whereas in other \u00a3Jans it may be a\ngiven fraction of the Social Security taxable wage base\ntimes years of service, for example. Pension benefits,\nand hence pension wealth, were zero when T was\nless than the required number of years for vesting.\nThe nominal benefits calculated for the first year\nof retirement are received annually for the remainder\nof the retiree's life, although the size of the payment\nmay be subject to cost-of-living adjustments. The\nannual benefit is converted into its annuity value\nby the function aR\n, shown in Equation 2.\nt = R\n\\t-R\nwhere kt\nis the COLA at age t, sRt\nis the probability\nof surviving from the retirement age to age t, n is the\nchange in the Consumer Price Index from period\nt - 1 to t, and / is again the real interest rate. Survival\nprobabilities after retirement were tabulated sep-\narately for men and women. (All respondents were\nassumed to survive with certainty until retirement.) The\nvalue of kt\ndepends upon the inflationary environ-\nment and the COLA provisions of the specific pen-\nsion plan, which were available from the summary plan\ndescription. Real retirement benefits were further\ndiscounted from the assumed retirement age to the\ncurrent age in 1992 by the real interest rate.\nFor defined contribution plans, pension wealth was\ndefined as the projected balance in the plan account\nat the time individuals expect to retire, discounted to\n1992 (the time of the survey). The account balance\ndepends upon the level of contributions to the plan\nand the amount of interest earned on past contribu-\ntions. Mandatory contributions, by both employers and\nemployees, were specified in the summary plan de-\nscriptions. Information about additional voluntary con-\ntributions by employees was reported by respondents\nat the time of survey, and the level of voluntary con-\ntributions was assumed to remain constant while the\nrespondent remained in the plan. Past contributions\nwere assumed to grow at the nominal rate of interest\nfor both men and women. Because there is some evi-\ndence that women invest more conservatively and hence\nearn lower returns than men (Bajtelsmit & Bernasek,\ntion that past contributions grow at the same rate for\nmen and women may lead us to underestimate gen-\nder differences in pension wealth.\nThe macroeconomic assumptions incorporated\ninto our estimates of pension wealth correspond to\nthe intermediate assumptions used by the Social Se-\ncurity Administration in 1996 for their assessment of\nthe financial condition of the Social Security trust fund\n(U.S. Social Security Administration, 1996). The an-\nnual inflation rate was assumed to equal 4.0%, the\nreal interest rate was assumed to equal 2.3%, and\nwages were assumed to grow at a real annual rate of\n1.0%. In addition, all workers were assumed to retire\nand to begin receiving pension benefits at age 65.\nMultivariate Estimates of Pension\nCoverage and Pension Wealth\nTo identify the effects of worker and job charac-\nteristics on pensions for men and women, we esti-\nmated multivariate models of pension coverage and\npension wealth separately for men and women. The\npension coverage estimates were generated from probit\nequations, in which the dependent variable was set\nequal to one if the respondent reported being included\nin a pension or retirement plan on the current job\nsponsored by an employer or union, zero otherwise.\nThe pension wealth estimates were generated from\nlinear regression models, in which the dependent variable\nwas the natural log of pension wealth.\nWe attempted to correct our estimates of pension\nwealth for the nonrandomness of the provider matches\nby using standard sample selection adjustments (Heck-\nman, 1979). We first estimated probit equations of\nthe probability of being linked to provider data, con-\nditional on self-reporting pension coverage, from which\nwe derived the inverse of Mills' Ratio. We then in-\ncluded the inverse of Mills' Ratio as a regressor in the\npension wealth equations. (We included the same set\nof regressors in the probit selection equations as in\nthe pension wealth regressions.) If unooservable fac-\ntors affecting the probability of being linked to pro-\nvider data are correlated with unobservable factors\naffecting the level of pension wealth, then omitting\nthe inverse of Mills' Ratio from the pension wealth\nregression could bias our estimated parameters in the\nwealth equation. A drawback of this selection adjust-\nment is that it is quite sensitive to the way in which\nthe selection equation is specified. This lack of ro-\nbustness suggests that the corrected estimates may not\nbe superior to the uncorrected estimates, and we re-\nport both sets of estimates below.\nIn both the pension coverage and wealth models,\nthe covariates consisted of measures of education,\ndemographic characteristics, job experience, industry,\noccupation, union membership, firm size, and wages,\nplus an intercept term. Education was measured by a\nseries of dichotomous variables, indicating whether the\nworker did not attend high school, attended some high\nschool but fewer than four years, completed exactly\nfour years of high school, or attended some college\nbut fewer than four years; college graduates were\nthe reference group. The models included an indica-\ntor for race (non-White, with White as the reference\ngroup) and two indicators for marital status (widowed,\ndivorced, or separated, and never married, with cur-\nrently married as the reference group). Job tenure was\nmeasured by a series of variables indicating 1 year or\nless, more than 1 but no more than 5 years, more\nthan 5 but no more than 10 years, more than 10 but\nno more than 15 years, and more than 15 but no\nmore than 20; the reference group was more than 20\nyears of job tenure. The model included six industry\ncontrols, with manufacturing as the reference group,\nfive occupational controls, with managers as the refer-\nence group, and an indicator for being covered by a\nunion or employee-association contract. The effects\nof firm size were captured by a series of variables in-\ndicating the number of employees at all locations (un-\nas the reference group). The hourly wage entered the\nmodel through indicator variables for earning $6 or\nless, more than $6 but no more than $10, and more\nthan $10 but no more than $15; the reference group\nwas employees earning more than $15 per hour. Be-\ncause all regressors in the model were binary, the mar-\nginal effect of a given covariate on pension coverage\nwas estimated by taking the difference between the\npredicted probability of coverage when the factor\nwas present and the predicted probability when not\npresent, holding other characteristics at the sample\nmeans. For the wealth regressions, marginal effects were\ncomputed as eB - 1, where B is the estimated regres-\nsion coefficient.\nDecomposition of Gender Differences\nWe also decomposed gender differences in pen-\nsions into the portions that could be explained by ob-\nservable characteristics of men and women in order\nto assess the impact of different variables on the\ngender gap. As Oaxaca (1973) has pointed out, the\ndifference in some mean outcome, say pension\nwealth, for two groups, say men and women, can be\nexpressed as:\nor\nwhere X-, is the vector of mean explanatory variables\nfor gender / (/' = males and females) and (3, is the\nvector of regression coefficients for gender /. The first\nterm in Equations 3 and 4 represents the portion of\nthe difference in outcomes that can be attributed to\ngroup differences in observed characteristics, which is\noften referred to as the explained portion of the dif-\nference. The second term, often referred to as the\nunexplained portion of the difference, is the fraction\nattributable to the difference in regression coeffi-\ncients, or the returns to particular characteristics. Be-\ncause the portion of the gender gap that can be ex-\nplained by differences in observable characteristics\ncan vary sharply depending upon whether male coef-\nficients or female coefficients are used as weights and\nneither estimate is preferred a priori, we reported re-\nsults from both Equations 3 and 4.\nAlthough the approach described above cannot be\napplied directly to probit equations, we used a similar\ntechnique, employed by Even and Macpherson (1990,\n1994), to decompose the gender gap in pension\ncoverage. The fraction of the gender difference in\ncoverage that can be attributable to characteristic j can\nbe expressed as:\nor\nwhere x,y is the mean value of characteristic j for gen-\nder /, P(\ny is the estimated regression coefficient for\ncharacteristic j, and X, and (3, are defined above. As\nwith the linear decomposition, we estimated the por-\ntion of the gender gap attributable to given character-\nistics by computing both Equations 5 and 6, because\nresults can vary depending upon whether male coeffi-\ncients or female coefficients are used as weights.\nResults\nPension Coverage\nTable 2 compares worker characteristics and pen-\nsion coverage for men and women. (Percentages were\nweighted by the inverse of the sampling probability\nto reflect the oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics in\nthe HRS.) There were strong gender differences in\npersonal and job characteristics for full-time wage and\nsalary workers. Chi-square tests indicated that all of\nthese differences, with the exception of firm size, were\nstatistically significant at the 5% level. Women in the\nsample were slightly more likely than men to have\ncompleted high school (81% vs 78%) but were slightly\nless likely to have completed college. Female workers\nwere substantially more likely than men to belong to\na racial minority; 17% of women, versus only 12% of\nmen, were not White. Women in the sample were\nalso much less likely than men to be married and more\nlikely than men to be widowed, divorced, or sepa-\nrated. For example, 10% of the women in the sample\nbut only 1% of men were widowed.\nThe job characteristics of full-time workers approach-\ning retirement also differed sharply by gender. Men\nhad longer job tenure and were substantially more\nlikely than women to have worked for their current\nemployer for more than 20 years. Men were more\nlikely than women to work in the manufacturing in-\ndustry, whereas women were clustered in the profes-\nsional services industry. In terms of occupation, women\nwere more likely than men to work in clerical jobs,\nwhereas construction, precision production, mechanic\nand repair services, operators, and agriculture, forestry,\nand fishing (which are included in the \"other\" occu-\npational category in Table 2) were predominantly male\noccupations. Men were also more likely than women\nto be covered by union contracts. Finally, men earned\nsubstantially higher salaries and wages than women.\nFor example, 47% of men earned more than $15 per\nhour, compared with only 17% of women.\nThe last two columns of Table 2 report the per-\ncentage of full-time wage and salary workers with\npension coverage, by gender and worker characteris-\ntics. Overall, men were significantly more likely than\nwomen to participate in pension plans on the current\njob. Fully 75% of men belonged to a plan, compared\nwith only 68% of women. The entire gender differ-\nence arose from differences in combination coverage,\ndefined as having more than one plan from the cur-\nrent job (generally a combination of defined benefit\nand defined contribution plans). Only 16% of women\nhad combination coverage on the current job, com-\npared with 24% of men. \"*\"\nFor workers with a particular characteristic, cover-\nage rates forjnen and women were generally similar,\nalthough some important gender differences were\nevident in our sample.

Rates of pension coverage were similar for men\nand women with limited job tenure, but men had a\nsubstantial advantage among workers with more than\n20 years of experience with the current employer.\nMen had significantly higher rates of coverage than\nwomen among workers in the manufacturing, trade,\nand professional services industries and among work-\ners in the professional, clerical, and services occupa-\ntions. Among unionized workers and workers in large\nfirms, rates of coverage were also higher for men than\nwomen. The only group for which women had sig-\nnificantly higher rates of coverage than men was low-\nwage workers. Whereas rates of coverage were virtu-\nally identical for workers earning more than $15 per\nhour, women enjoyed a clear advantage over men\nin terms of pension coverage for workers earning less\nthan $15 per hour. For example, 63% of women in\nthe sample earning between $6 and $10 per hour\nhad pension coverage on the current job, compared\nwith only 56% of men.\nTable 3 reports the marginal effects of worker and\njob characteristics on pension coverage, based on probit\nequations that were estimated separately for men and\nwomen. Our results were similar for men and women.\nControlling for other observable characteristics, pen-\nsion coverage rates were significantly lower among full-\ntime workers who had only limited education, who\nwere not White, and who were not covered by union\ncontracts. Workers who were employed by the cur-\nrent firm for fewer than five years were also less likely\nto participate in pension plans on the current job than\nmore senior workers, but additional years of service\nbeyond five years had only small and generally insig-\nnificant effects on pension coverage. Coverage rates\nwere especially low for workers in small firms. Hold-\ning other observable factors constant, women in firms\npoints less likely to have pension coverage than women\nemployed by firms with 500 or more workers. The\nwage level also had large effects on pension cover-\nage. For women, workers earning less than $6 per\nhour were 25 percentage points less likely to partici-\npate in pension plans on the current job than workers\nearning more than $15 per hour. The effect of low\nwage on coverage was even larger for men. In addi-\ntion, we found some significant differences in pension\ncoverage by industry and occupation, with coverage\nrates especially low in the nonprofessional services\nindustry for both men and women and in the trade\nindustry and services occupation for women. Marital\nstatus had significant effects on coverage for men but\nnot for women. Men who were widowed or divorced\nwere significantly less likely to have pension coverage\non the current job than married men.\nThe shortfall in pension coverage observed for\nwomen relative to men may arise because women are\nless likely than men to possess particular characteris-\ntics associated with pension coverage or because par-\nticular characteristics are associated with lower rates\nof coverage for women than for men.

The\ndecompositions reported in the table were estimated\nfirst using male coefficients as weights (corresponding\nto Equation 5) and then using female coefficients as\nweights (corresponding to Equation 6). Weighting by\nmale coefficients, our model predicted that 78% of\nthe gender gap in pension coverage would be elimi-\nnated if men and women had identical characteris-\ntics. The wage gap between men and women ac-\ncounted for most of the gender gap in pension cover-\nage. Equalizing job tenure, marital status, and union\nmembership for men and women would also have\nlarge effects on narrowing the coverage gap. However,\nwhen weighting by female coefficients from the probit\nequation, observable differences between men and\nwomen accounted for only 27% of the gender gap in\npension coverage. The decomposition was quite sen-\nsitive to the choice of weights because the probability\nof pension coverage was found to be substantially less\nresponsive to job tenure, union membership, marital\nstatus, and wage levels for women than for men. The\nactual distribution of industry and occupation favored\npension coverage for women, so that equalizing the\ndistribution for men and women would increase the\ngender gap in coverage, regardless of the choice of\nweights.\nPension Wealth\nObserved differences in pension wealth between\nmen and women may arise from both the gender gap\nin pension coverage and from the gender gap in\npension wealth conditional on coverage. To explore\ndifferences in wealth conditional on coverage, we ex-\namined data from the pension provider supplement\nto the HRS. Table 5 reports worker characteristics and\nmedian pension wealth for the sample of full-time\nwage and salary workers for whom information from\npension providers was available and who had pen-\nsion coverage on the current job. The data were weighted\nto account for the underrepresentation of workers in\nsmall firms and workers in defined contribution plans\nin the pension provider sample and to account for\nthe oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics in the HRS.\nAs we noted earlier in this article, we believe that\nestimates of pension wealth for this sample of work-\ners will be more accurate than estimates based on\nself-reports of expected future benefits. Characteris-\ntics of the sample of covered workers differed from\nthe full sample of workers in ways that reflected the\npatterns of pension coverage observed in Table 2. For\nexample, the sample of workers with matched infor-\nmation from pension providers was better educated,\nearned higher wages, had longer job tenure, was more\nlikely to belong to unions, and was more likely to be\nemployed by large firms than the full sample of work-\ners. However, the patterns of gender differences in\npersonal and job characteristics were quite similar for\nthe two samples. For example, in the sample of full-\ntime workers linked to pension provider information,\nhigher percentages of men than women had long job\ntenure, earned high wages, and belonged to FaDor\nunions. These same patterns were also observed in\nthe full sample of workers described in Table 2.\nGender differences in pension wealth on the cur-\nrent job among covered full-time workers were much\nlarger than the observed differences in pension cov-\nerage. As reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5,\nmedian pension wealth on the current job for cov-\nfor covered women, representing a 76% advantage\nfor men. Men had higher pension wealth than women\namong virtually all groups within the sample. How-\never, gender differences were especially large among\nworkers with defined contribution plans only, who\nrepresented about 30% of the sample. Median pen-\nsion wealth was 170% higher for men with defined\ncontribution plans only than for women. In contrast,\ngender differences were fairly modest among workers\nwith a single defined benefit plan, where men held\nonly a 30% advantage over women in terms of\nmedian pension wealth. Median pension wealth was\nalso substantially higher for men than women among\nworkers in the trade and finance, insurance, and real\nestate industries and in sales and clerical occupations.\nSomewhat surprisingly, gender differences in pension\nwealth were small and statistically insignificant within\nwage groups. In fact, among workers with positive pen-\nsion wealth earning between $10 and $15 per hour,\nmedian pension wealth was slightly higher for women\nthan for men. Gender differences were also small and\ninsignificant among workers in nonprofessional ser-\nvices industries, non-White workers, unmarried work-\ners, and workers with tenure between 10 and 15 years\nor one year or less with the current employer.\nTable 6 reports the results of linear regressions of\nthe natural log of pension wealth on worker and job\ncharacteristics.

Both sets of models in-\ndicated that wage level and job tenure have large\neffects on pension wealth for both men and women,\nconditional on having pension coverage. In the un-\nadjusted model, pension wealth was 92% lower for\ncovered men earning $6 per hour or less than for\ncovered men earning more than $15 per hour, hold-\ning other factors constant. The wage effects were\nsmaller but still substantial for women. Pension wealth\nfor both men and women also steadily increased with\njob tenure. For example, in the unadjusted model,\ncovered women with only 5 to 10 years of experi-\nence on the job had accumulated only 64% as much\npension wealth as women who had spent more than\n20 years with the employer, all else equal. Demo-\ngraphic variables did not generally have significant ef-\nfects in the unadjusted models.\nAttempts to correct for the nonrandomness of the\nprovider matches had some substantial effects on the\npension wealth models. However, because the selec-\ntion corrections were not very stable and were quite\nsensitive to the way in which the selection model was\nspecified, the corrected estimates may not be supe-\nrior to the unadjusted estimates. The unadjusted\nmodel predicted tnat women in public administration\nand in finance, insurance, and real estate industries\nhad more than twice as much pension wealth as\nwomen working in manufacturing, all else equal. How-\never, after correcting for selection, the models revealed\nno significant differences by industry for women. The\nadjusted model indicated that men in professional ser-\nvices industries and in public administration had sig-\nnificantly less pension wealth than men in manufac-\nturing, whereas there were no significant differences\nby industry in the unadjusted models for covered male\nworkers. The estimated effects of firm size on pension\nwealth changed sign after correcting for selection. In\nthe unadjusted model, men and women with pen-\nsions in small firms had significantly less pension wealth\non the current job than workers in large firms. The\ncorrected model, however, indicated that covered workers\nin small firms had significantly more pension wealth\nthan workers in large firms. These differences notwith-\nstanding, the adjusted and unadjusted models were\nconsistent in revealing large, significant effects of wages\nand job tenure on pension wealth.\nTo understand better how different personal and\njob characteristics contributed to the observed differ-\nences in pension wealth between men and women,\nTable 7 decomposes the gender gap in pension wealth\ninto the percentages that could oe attributed to gen-\nder differences in each of the variables in our mod-\nels. The decompositions reported in Table 7 were es-\ntimated first using male coefficients as weights and then\nusing female coefficients as weights and were based\non linear regression models with and without the se-\nlection correction. Differences in observable charac-\nteristics--particularly those related to the current job--\nbetween men and women accounted for almost the\nentire gender gap in pension wealth. When weighting\nby male coefficients, differences in observable char-\nacteristics explained 111% of the total gender gap be-\nfore correcting for selection, and 138% of the gap\nTable 7.

In other words, when\nweighting by the male coefficients, the model pre-\ndicted that gender differences in the returns to per-\nsonal and job characteristics in terms of pension wealth\nactually favored women over men among full-time\ncovered workers at midlife. Differences in wages had\nthe largest effect on the gap in pension wealth, ac-\ncounting for between 64% and 70% of the pension\nwealth gap. Differences in job tenure were also very\nimportant, accounting for between 22% and 36% of\nthe gap in pension wealth. Correcting for nonrandom-\nness of the provider matches substantially increased\nthe portion of the gap in pension wealth attributable\nto gender differences in industry, because match rates\nvaried significantly by industry. When weighting by male\ncoefficients, adjusting for selection increased the pro-\nportion of the gap that could be explained by gender\ndifferences in industry from 17% to 44%. Other per-\nsonal and job characteristics accounted for only small\nportions of the gender gap in pension wealth.\nDecompositions weighted by coefficients from the\nfemale pension wealth equations indicate that differ-\nences in observable characteristics between men and\nwomen accounted for most, but not all, of the gender\ngap in pension wealth. When weighting by female co-\nefficients, the explained portion of the total gender\ngap in pension wealth ranged from 70% to 96%. Most\nof the discrepancy between the decompositions based\non male coefficients and female coefficients arose from\nthe smaller portion of the gender gap that could be\nexplained by wage differences when using the female\nrather than male coefficients. The wage gap explained\nonly 20%-35% of the pension wealth gap with female\ncoefficients because the wage level was found to have\nweaker effects on pension wealth for women than for\nmen, as reported in Table 6. Despite discrepancies in\nthe precise magnitude of the estimated effects, how-\never, each of the decompositions predicted that al-\nmost all of the gender gap in pension wealth could\nbe explained by differences in observable characteris-\ntics between men and women, and that eliminating\ngender differences in wages and job tenure would\ndramatically reduce the gap in pension wealth.\nDiscussion\nEvidence from pension provider data in the HRS\nindicated that the gender gap in pension wealth on\nthe current job was substantial among full-time wage\nand salary workers. For full-time workers with pen-\nsion coverage, median pension wealth on the current\njob was 76% greater for men than women, and the\ngender gap was even larger among workers who had\nonly defined contribution plans on the current job.\nThe gender differential in pension coverage was much\nsmaller than the differential in wealth, however. Cov-\nerage rates were high for both male and female full-\ntime workers approaching retirement. Fully 75% of men\nand 68% of women had some type of pension cover-\nage on the current job, although men were substan-\ntially more likely than women to participate in more\nthan one plan on the current job.\nDifferences in wages and years of job tenure be-\ntween men and women accounted for most of the\ngender gap in pension wealth on the current job. We\nFound that equalizing the number of years of job ten-\nure for men and women could eliminate up to 39%\nof the gender gap in pension wealth. Eliminating gen-\nder differences in the wage earned on the current job\ncould eliminate between 20% and 70% of the wealth\ngap. We also found that, at most, one third of the\ngender gap in pension wealth could not be explained\nby gender differences in education, demographics, or\njob characteristics. Thus, labor market discrimination\nagainst women, differences in tastes for pension in-\ncome between men and women, and other unob-\nservable factors affecting pension income appeared to\naccount for only a small part of the gender difference\nin pension wealth. Our findings differed from the re-\nsults of Even and Macpherson (1994), who concluded\nthat except for income earned on the longest job, per-\nsonal and job characteristics could not explain much\nof the gender gap in pension benefits. However, Even\nand Macpherson (1994) examined gender differences\nin pension income received by recently retired per-\nsons with some past work experience, whereas we\nexamined differences in pension wealth on the cur-\nrent job for a sample of full-time workers. Observed\npatterns in pensions based upon benefits received\nfrom all past jobs may not be comparable to patterns\nbased on pension wealth earned on the current job.\nRestricting our sample to full-time workers also led us\nto estimate smaller gender differences in pensions\nthan Even and Macpherson (1994), because part-time\nworkers have much lower pension benefits on the cur-\nrent job than full-time workers, and women are more\nlikely than men to work part time. In addition, mem-\nbers of our sample were born about 15 years later\nthan the members of the sample examined by Even\nand Macpherson (1994), and pension benefits may\nhave changed substantially during that period.\nFor a number of different reasons, the results de-\nscribed here may present an overly optimistic picture\nof women's experiences in the labor market and un-\nderstate the gender differences in pension benefits.\nFirst, we have compared pension wealth for men and\nwomen only on the current job, but retirement in-\ncome includes pension benefits from all past jobs. A\nrecent study found that a large portion of the pen-\nsion wealth held by workers approaching retirement\nwas earned on past jobs, not the current job (McCarry\n& Davenport, 1998). Gender differences in total pen-\nsion wealth may be more pronounced than differences\nobserved only on the current job. Second, by focus-\ning only on full-time workers we did not consider part-\ntime workers and persons not in the labor force, who\nare likely to have low pension wealth and are pre-\ndominantly female (see Appendix, Note 5). Third, part\nof the gender difference in future annual pension\nbenefits among current workers is masked by gender\ndifferences in life expectancy, which favor women. Be-\ncause women live longer than men on average, gen-\nder differences in annual pension benefits received\nduring retirement from defined benefit plans will be\nlarger than the estimated gap in wealth. Fourth, evi-\ndence that women invest more conservatively than men\nand earn lower returns than men do may lead to larger\ngender differences in pension wealth than we have\nestimated, because we assumed that men and women\nearned equal returns on their defined contribution plan\naccounts. Differences in investment behavior may have\nlarger effects on the gender gap in pension wealth for\nfuture cohorts, who will hold much of their pension\nwealth in defined contribution plans. Finally, although\nour results indicate that most of the gender gap in\npension wealth can be explained by differences in ob-\nservable job characteristics between men and women,\nand in particular by gender differences in wages, they\ndo not explain why women earn less than men in the\nfirst place. Recent research indicates that about 10%\nof the gender gap in wages remains unexplained after\ncontrolling for differences in observable characteristics\nbetween men and women and may result from dis-\ncrimination against women in the labor market (Blau\n& Kahn, 1997). Although discriminatory behavior may\nnot directly affect women's pension wealth in a sub-\nstantial way, it may play an important indirect role by\nreducing the wages earned by women.\nDespite these caveats, our results are reason for op-\ntimism about the economic security of future cohorts\nof retiring women. The dramatic reduction over the\npast 30 years in gender differences in employment\ncharacteristics, which account for most of the pension\ngender gap among workers currently approaching\nretirement, suggests that the gap in pension wealth\nbetween men and women will narrow over the\ncoming decades. Women's labor force participation,\nyears of work experience, and earnings have all been\nincreasing, both in absolute terms and relative to men,\nsince members of the baby boom cohort began reaching\nparticipation rates increased 26% for women aged 35-\n44 while declining 6% for men at the same ages. Dur-\ning the same period, real weekly wages among full-\nwomen are still less likely to work than men and con-\ntinue to earn less than men when they do work, the\nlikely result of these trends will be greater pension\nwealth for women, leading to more equitable labor\noutcomes for working women and improved economic\nsecurity for elderly women in the next century.\nReferences\nAllen, S.

Pension coverage among private wage and salary\nworkers: Preliminary findings from the 1988 Survey of Employee Ben-\nAppendix\nNotes\nworkers in defined contribution plans were no more\nlikely to quit their jobs than workers in defined ben-\nefits plans. Because defined contribution plans do not\ngenerally backload compensation, their finding sug-\ngests that the low turnover rates exhibited by workers\nwith pensions are driven not by potential capital losses\nbut by the compensation premia earned by covered\nworkers.\n2. An important advantage of pensions for most\nworkers is that they offer tax-advantaged opportuni-\nties to save for retirement, because contributions to\nthe plan and interest they earn are not taxed until\npension benefits are received. Even and Macpherson\n(1994) argue that women will benefit less from the\ntax advantages of pensions because they earn less than\nmen, and thus will be less likely to choose jobs that\noffer generous pensions. However, most married couples\nfile joint tax returns, so the tax savings offered by\npension plans should be equally advantageous to most\nmarried men and married women.\n3. Self-reported HRS data have been used by other\nresearchers to estimate pension wealth; see, for ex-\nample, Smith (1995) and McGarry-and Davenport\n4. The ISR software for estimating pension wealth\nwas written by Richard Curtin and updated by Robert\nPeticolas and Jody Lamkin.\nnot working at wave 1 and 13% were working part\ntime, compared to 39% of men who were not work-\ning and 4% of men who were working part time."
