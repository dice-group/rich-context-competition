Further examination of network and community factors is needed\nto explain these disparities.\nResearch has documented significant racial disparities in sexu-\nally transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and\nyoung adults in the United States.1,2 Although black-white dispar-\nities have received substantial attention, other racial/ethnic groups\nare also at a heightened risk of STIs, relative to whites. American\nIndian (AI) adolescents and young adults have one of the highest\nrates of STIs of any racial/ethnic group in the United States.2\u00ad4\nFor instance, in 2010, AI adolescents had chlamydia and syphilis\nrates roughly 3 times higher than those of whites and gonorrhea\nrates approximately 3\u00bd times higher.2 However, there exists a\npaucity of studies that have examined why disparities in STIs exist\nbetween AIs and whites.\nPrior research examining racial disparities in STIs has often\nfocused on risky individual health behaviors and the black versus\nwhite comparison. For instance, Hallfors and colleagues5 tested\nwhether risky sexual behaviors and substance use explained the\nblack-white disparity in STIs. The results showed that a number\nof disparities existed between blacks and whites in risky sexual be-\nhaviors (and to a lesser extent, substance use behaviors), yet con-\ntrolling for these behaviors did not account for much of the race\ngap in STIs.5 Nonetheless, a large body of research has demon-\nstrated that substance use and risky sexual behaviors heighten\nSTI risk,6\u00ad8 suggesting that these behaviors may help to explain\nthe high rates of STIs among certain racial minorities (such as\nAIs), relative to whites.\nCumulative evidence has demonstrated that AIs are dispro-\nportionately involved in risky sexual and substance use behaviors\ncompared with whites. Research suggests that urban AI adoles-\ncents are more likely to be sexually active, have first intercourse\nat younger ages, and are less likely to use condoms than their white\nadult AIs are less likely to have used alcohol in their lifetimes, past\nyear, or past month, some studies suggest that adult AIs suffer\nfrom much higher rates of binge drinking, substance abuse, and\nsubstance dependence than whites.13,14 Finally, studies have found\nthat AI's illicit drug use exceeds that of other racial/ethnic groups\nYet despite these disparities, we are aware of no studies that\nhave examined whether sexual and drug behavior patterns can ex-\nplain the AI-white race gap in STIs. A recent study by De Ravello\nand colleagues10 using 2 years of data from the national Youth\nRisk Behavior Survey found higher levels of self-reported sub-\nstance abuse and sexual risk behaviors among AI compared with\nwhite high school students. However, because the Youth Risk Be-\nhavior Survey does not collect information about STI prevalence,\nthe association between these risk behaviors and STI status for\nAI adolescents and young adults is not known. Our study objective\nis to determine the association between sexual and substance use\nbehaviors with the likelihood of having an STI among AI com-\npared with white young adults after adjusting for confounding\ncharacteristics.\nMETHODS\nThis study uses data from wave III of the National Longitu-\ndinal Study of Adolescent Health, or the Add Health study.15\nThe Add Health is a nationally representative study of adolescents\nAdd Health sample is representative of schools in the United\nStates with respect to region, urbanicity, school size, school sector,\nand racial composition.16 The weighted response rate for wave III\ngesting that this wave's sample was reflective of the original wave I\nspondents were 18 to 26 years old.

Respondents\nwho consented received an incentive of $10 for providing the\nspecimen. Laboratory testing methods used for Add Health are\ndescribed elsewhere.18 Approximately 81% of the wave III partic-\nipants submitted a viable sample. Any respondent who had miss-\ning information for these tests, regardless of the reason, was\nexcluded from the present study. Furthermore, our study included\nonly those respondents who had complete information on all co-\nvariates of interest and who self-identified as primarily AI or white\n(there was no Alaskan Native option).\nAdd Health respondents could choose multiple racial cate-\ngories. Respondents were coded AI if they identified as only\n\"American Indian or Native American\" or if they responded that\n\"American Indian or Native American\" best described their racial\nbackground. A similar approach was used to code white respon-\ndents. In addition to race, we included other demographic vari-\nables including age, sex, and dichotomous indicators of marital\nstatus, not having a high school degree, and public assistance\n(based on whether the respondent had received temporary assis-\ntance for needy families/welfare, food stamps, or a housing sub-\nsidy, during the past year).\nSubstance use behaviors measured included injection drug\nuse since 1995 and frequency of marijuana use in the past month\nup to 31 times or more. Alcohol use behaviors measured included\nthe frequency of alcohol use and binge drinking (i.e., drinking 5\ndrinks in a row) in the past year. Both were measured on a scale\nfrom 0 (none) to 6 (everyday or almost everyday). A number of\nmeasures of sexual behavior were included: early sexual initiation\n(<15 years of age), condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse\n(3 categories: condom use at last sex [referent category], did not\nuse condom at most recent sexual intercourse [no condom use\nat last sex], and did not have sexual intercourse in past year [no\nsex]), engaging in sex for money (paid for sex), number of sexual\npartners in the past year, and sexual situation that respondent later\nregretted because she/he had been drinking or used drugs (regret-\nted sex due to substance use).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe outcome variable is STI, which is a dichotomous mea-\nsure of whether the respondent tested positive for any of the 3 STIs\n(i.e., chlamydia, trichomoniasis, or gonorrhea). We examined this\ncomposite measure given the overall low percentage of positive in-\nfections, coupled with the relatively small number of AI respon-\ndents. American Indian and white participants were compared\nwith respect to demographic, substance use, and sexual risk behav-\niors using bivariate logistic regressions for categorical variables\n(e.g., STI), ordinary least squares regression for continuous\nvariables (e.g., age), and negative binomial regression for count\nvariables (e.g., number of sexual partners). Subsequently, we com-\nputed multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the asso-\nciation between these variables and having an STI. All analyses\nwere conducted in Stata version 13 and weighted to account\nfor the complex survey design and the unequal probability of\nRESULTS\nAfter limiting the sample to respondents with complete in-\nformation on relevant variables, our final sample size was 367 AIs\nand 7813 whites. Descriptive information about AI and white\nparticipants is presented in Table 1. The results showed that the\npercent of AI participants who tested positive for an STI at wave\nIII was 2.5 times greater than the percent of white participants\nwho tested positive, a statistically significant difference (9.0%\nfor AIs vs. 3.6% for whites). The results also demonstrated notable\ndifferences with regard to substance use behaviors. The frequency\nof binge drinking and the frequency of alcohol use were signifi-\ncantly lower (P < 0.05) for AIs than for whites. However, AIs were\nmore likely to have injected drugs in the past year, relative to\nwhites. The observed difference in marijuana use frequency failed\nto reach statistical significance. With regard to sexual behaviors,\nAIs and whites only differed in terms of their likelihood to pay\nfor sex. Among those who had sex in the past year, AIs were sig-\nnificantly more likely to have paid for sex (9.0% vs. 3.0%). None\nof the other measures of sexual activity differed by racial group in\nour sample.\nTable 2 presents associations between demographic, sub-\nstance use, and sexual behavior variables. Importantly, even when\ncontrolling for substance use and sexual behaviors, race was a sig-\nnificant predictor of having an STI. The odds of having an STI\nwere 2.4 times greater for AIs than for whites. Surprisingly, none\nof the substance use behaviors were significant predictors of hav-\ning an STI. In contrast, a number of sexual behaviors emerged as\nimportant predictors of having an STI. Early sexual initiation was\nassociated with a heightened risk of STI, controlling for all other\nvariables. Not using a condom at last sex also was associated with\nTABLE 1.

The results (available from the authors\non request) were quite similar to the findings presented in Table 2.\nDISCUSSION\nThe key finding from our study was that the significant ra-\ncial disparity in STIs persisted even when controlling for sub-\nstance use and sexual behaviors. That is, the higher STI\nprevalence among AIs compared with whites was not explained\nby differential substance use or risky sexual behaviors between\nthe 2 groups. Our finding is consistent with prior research, exam-\nining whites and other racial groups, that such behaviors could not\naccount for racial disparities in STIs.5,20\nConsistent with past studies, we found that a number of\nrisky sexual practices were predictive of increased STI risk. Not\nusing a condom at last sex and early sexual initiation were both as-\nsociated with a higher likelihood of having an STI. However, even\nwhen adjusting for these individual substance use and sexual be-\nhaviors, the racial disparity in STIs persisted. These results extend\nprior work by highlighting that the differences in STIs among AI\nand white adolescents and young adults are not due to differences\nin substance use and risky sexual activity. Although we do not\nknow the reasons for the enduring AI-white gap in STIs, our re-\nsults clearly suggest the need to look beyond sexual and substance\nuse behaviors. It may be that the documented STI disparity results\nfrom racial differences in social environments (e.g., discrimina-\ntion, place of residence, and neighborhood disadvantage)21,22\nor differential access to treatment services between the groups.23\nFurthermore, the gap may result from different sexual networks\nbetween the 2 groups. Morris and colleagues24 have argued that\nindividual behaviors do not define one's STI risk. Instead \"sexual\nnetworks determine levels of individual exposure, the population\ndynamics of infection spread, and the interactional contexts that\nconstrain behavioral changes\" (p. 1029). Indeed, findings from a\nnumber of studies have linked sexual network characteristics with\nSTI prevalence.25,26 These studies suggest that there is a compel-\nling need to conduct more research that examines sexual networks,\nespecially for exploring the AI-white race gap in STIs.\nImportantly, our results should be interpreted in light of the\nlimitations of the current study. First, we only explored the associ-\nations with cross-sectional data. Hence, we have not examined the\npossibility that early substance use or risky sexual behaviors led to\nSTIs before the wave in which our data were collected. Further-\nmore, we did not consider reciprocal relationships in these analy-\nses; it is possible, for instance, that people who discovered that\nthey had an STI before wave III might have reduced their engage-\nment in risky sexual behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex), potentially\nserving to weaken the strength of the association between risky\nsexual behaviors and STIs (measured at wave III). Ideally, a longi-\ntudinal model that would include testing for STIs at each wave\nwould allow one to more precisely examine these relationships,\nbut our data did not include such testing. In addition, the sexual\nand substance use measures were self-reported, and thus, some re-\nsponse bias may be a concern. Furthermore, our measure of con-\ndom use only captured the last sexual intercourse; hence, the\nconsistency in condom use during sexual activity is not being con-\nsidered in our study. Also, the Add Health study did not ask infor-\nmation about the tribal affiliation of the AI respondents, so we\ncannot speak to any tribal variation in norms and customs relating\nto sexual activity. Nor does our analysis consider evidence that\nsuggests that AI STI rates may vary greatly by region.27 Finally,\nthe Add Health study, like any study based on students in schools,\nmisses students who are truant or dropped out when the wave I\nstudy was conducted, missing respondents who may be at a height-\nened risk for engaging in substance use and risky sexual behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, the results from the current study\nmake an important contribution to the literature. The findings\ndemonstrate that AI young adults were much more likely to have\nan STI (i.e., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis infection)\nthan white young adults. Because each of the tested STIs can\nbe treated, access to health care may be an important factor that\nmay serve to explain much of the race gap. Thus, focusing on\nstructural factors that may explain the AI-white gap in STIs will\nbe an important direction for future research. Factors such as per-\nsistent poverty, limited access to health care, and high incarcera-\ntion rates may all contribute to the AI-white gap in STIs. Indeed,\nit may be time to reconsider the individual behavioral approach\nto explaining race differences in STIs and implement models that\nfocus on networks and communities instead.\nREFERENCES\n1.
