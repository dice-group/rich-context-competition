The present study sought to inves-\ntigate the characteristics of adolescent (aged 16-17 years)\nand young adult (aged 18-29 years) past-year gamblers\non measures of psychiatric health and gambling. The\nyoung adult group of gamblers was separated into early-\nonset (gambling onset at age 18 years) and adult-\nonset (gambling onset at age 18 years) groups. We hy-\npothesized that (1) each group of gamblers would report\nmore psychiatric problems than nongamblers, (2) ado-\nlescent and early-onset gambling would show stronger\nassociations with adverse measures of psychiatric health\ncompared with adult-onset gambling, and (3) adoles-\ncent, early-onset adult, and adult-onset gamblers would\ndiffer on reasons for and patterns of gambling, with ado-\nlescent and early-onset adult gamblers demonstrating\ngreatergamblingseverity(higherquantity/frequency)than\nadult-onset gamblers.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nData analyzed were obtained from the GIBS, a national US ci-\nvilian household survey conducted by the National Opinion\nResearch Center (NORC). The goal of the GIBS was to exam-\nine the impact of gambling in the United States.17,18 Partici-\npants were interviewed through the use of random-digit-\nface-to-face interviews at selected gambling venues (530 adults\nonly). Because face-to-face interviews were not conducted with\nadolescent gamblers and different questionnaires were used for\nthe gambling venue and RDD adult samples, only data from\nthe RDD surveys were analyzed in the present study.\nData for the adult RDD survey were obtained using a list-\nassisted approach and one-plus sampling (selecting from banks\nof 100 telephone numbers with at least 1 listed telephone num-\nber), as is typical for the NORC, and they are described else-\nwhere.17 Telephone numbers purchased from Survey Sampling\nInternational (Fairfield, Conn) were stratified by state lottery sta-\ntus, and working residential telephone numbers were identified\nin part through screening by Survey Sampling International.17\nThe individual interviewed from the contacted household was\ndetermined via a variant of the Troldahl/Carter/Bryant method.17\nThe adolescent population screened in the GIBS consisted\nof 16- and 17-year-olds, a population representing less than 7%\nof US households. In an effort to increase access to this popu-\nlation, adolescents were recruited using not only the RDD tele-\nphone lists like those used for adults17-19 but also \"enriched\"\nlists that had a higher probability of providing access to ado-\nlescents.17,18 Screening of adolescents required consent from the\nadolescent's parent or guardian and the adolescent.\nThe adolescent and adult RDD samples were weighted to\nbe representative of the US population for 16- and 17-year-old\nadolescents and adults 18 years and older, respectively. The\nweighting procedure has been described previously for ado-\n.uchicago.edu/dlib/ngis.htm). Sample weights for the adoles-\ncent and adult RDD samples were scaled to sum to the actual\nand sample sizes reported refer to sums of sample weights.\nStudies involving analysis of publicly accessible GIBS data\nwere presented to the Yale Human Investigations Committee\nand were exempted from review. Only participants aged 16 to\n29 years, inclusive, were studied to minimize recall bias with\nrespect to age at gambling onset and confounding of cohort ef-\npast-year gambling status (yes vs no), and age at gambling on-\nset (18 years vs 18 years) to form 5 groups: adolescent gam-\nadult nongamblers (n=187). Past-year gambling was defined\nas \"placing a bet [during the past 12 months] on the outcome\nof a race or game of skill or chance, or playing a game--\nincluding for charity--in which one might win or lose money.\"17\nData from individuals missing data on gambling status (n=13\nadults) and adults missing data on age at gambling onset (n=7\nadults) were excluded from analyses. Sample weights were ad-\njusted for individuals included in the analyses.\nMEASURES\nVariables were derived from questions in the GIBS,17,18 as de-\nscribed previously.20 Alcohol and drug use and abuse/\ndependence measures were based on DSM-IV criteria as imple-\nmented in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.17\nPast-year alcohol use was defined as use of alcohol at least once\nor twice per month for a minimum of 12 days in the past year.\nPast-year drug use was defined as use of an illicit drug for a\nminimum of 5 days in the past year. Respondents needed to\nmeet a threshold criterion of use of a substance (not including\nnicotine or caffeine) for nonmedical purposes on at least 5 days\nin the previous year to be asked follow-up questions that as-\nsess DSM-IV criteria for abuse/dependence (eg, questions about\ntolerance, withdrawal, and adverse physical or social effects of\nuse). Substance abuse/dependence variables assessed abuse/\ndependence of alcohol; marijuana and hashish; cocaine and\ncrack; stimulants such as methamphetamine, amphetamines,\nand speed for nonmedical reasons; and tranquilizers such as\ndiazepam and alprazolam for nonmedical reasons.\nTwoscreeningquestionsfromtheDiagnosticInterviewSched-\nule measured depression, assessing a lifetime history of 2 weeks\nwhen the respondent either felt sad, empty, and depressed all\nthe time or lost interest in most things previously found enjoy-\nable. As with drug and alcohol use measures, screening ques-\ntions were designed to capture most respondents with a history\nof major depression while minimizing respondent burden.\nMost gambling measures (reasons for gambling, age at gam-\nbling onset, and quantity/frequency measures) were adapted di-\nrectly from the GIBS.17,19 At-risk or problem gambling was de-\nfined as a lifetime NORC Diagnostic Screen score of 1 or more\nDSM-IV inclusionary criteria for pathological gambling.

Some sociodemo-\ngraphic variables were not included in the analysis for adolescent\ngamblers because they were judged to be of limited heteroge-\nneity (age, marital status, and employment) or reliability (house-\nhold income). A logistic regression procedure implemented in\nSAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to determine odds\nratios (ORs) adjusted for between-group differences as fol-\nlows. Odds ratios associated with past-year alcohol use and\nabuse/dependence, past-year drug use and abuse/dependence,\nany past-year substance abuse, and lifetime depression were ad-\njusted for sociodemographic factors.

Relationships between psychiatric health mea-\nsures and gambling status for adolescent gambling com-\npared with those for adult-onset gambling (ie, [adolescent\ngamblers vs adolescent nongamblers] vs [adult-onset gam-\nblers vs adult nongamblers]) were significant for alco-\nabuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 4.96; P=.01), and sub-\nstance abuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 3.01; P=.01). Re-\nlationships between psychiatric health measures and gam-\nbling status for early-onset adult gambling compared with\nthose for adult-onset gambling (ie, [early-onset adult gam-\nblers vs adult nongamblers] vs [adult-onset gamblers vs\nadult nongamblers]) were significant for alcohol use (ad-\njusted OR, 1.73; P=.01), alcohol abuse/dependence (ad-\nP.001), and substance abuse/dependence (adjusted OR,\ntionships between psychiatric health measures and gam-\nbling status for adolescent gambling compared with those\nfor early-onset adult gambling.\nReasons for Gambling\nCompared with both groups of adult gamblers, adoles-\ncent gamblers were more likely to report gambling for\nsocial reasons and less likely to report gambling for the\npersonal services received (ie, friendly or respectful treat-\nment from staff) or to win money (Table 3).

Adolescent gamblers were also less likely than\nearly-onset adult gamblers to gamble weekly or daily and\nmore likely than adult-onset gamblers to report at-risk\nor problem gambling. Early-onset gamblers were more\nlikely than adult-onset gamblers to report usually gam-\nbling with someone and largest wins of $100 or more.\nTypes of Gambling\nAdolescent gamblers were less likely than both groups\nof adult gamblers to report past-year nonstrategic,\nmachine, and casino gambling (Table 3).

Compared with\nadult-onset gamblers, early-onset gamblers were more\nlikely to report past-year strategic and noncasino gam-\nbling and less likely to report past-year casino gambling.\nCOMMENT\nThis study examined psychiatric health and gambling-\nrelated attitudes and behaviors in adolescent, early-\nonset adult, and adult-onset past-year gamblers using data\nfrom younger age groups in a recent national survey. Al-\nthough gambling was associated with psychiatric prob-\nlems (eg, substance abuse/dependence) in adolescents and\nyoung adults, these relationships were largely confined\nto the groups reporting an early age at gambling onset.\nBetween-group differences in reasons for and patterns of\ngambling were observed, with some measures suggest-\ning that early-onset adult gamblers display heavier pat-\nterns of gambling than do adult-onset gamblers. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that gambling during ado-\nlescence may influence adult psychiatric functioning.\nDEMOGRAPHICS\nThe finding that adolescent and early-onset adult past-\nyear gamblers were more likely than adolescent and adult\nnongamblers, respectively, to be male is consistent with\nfindings from other studies21-23 of adolescent and young\nTable 2.

Data\nsuggest that of adult problem gamblers, women begin\ngambling later in life, but once they begin gambling, they\ndevelop gambling problems more rapidly than men.20,24\nThus, the findings suggest that gambling prevention in-\nterventions that target youth groups should preferen-\ntially focus on boys. However, given the sex-related dif-\nferences in adult gambling and problematic gambling\nbehaviors,20,24 more research is needed to investigate sex-\nrelated differences in the characteristics of adolescent gam-\nblers to inform youth gambling and adult problem gam-\nbling prevention efforts.\nStrong associations with alcohol and other drug use and\nabuse/dependence were observed with gambling in ado-\nlescent and early-onset adult gamblers, and these associa-\ntionswere,exceptforalcoholuse,notobservedintheadult-\nonset gamblers. In part, these findings may reflect aspects\nof adolescent risk taking, decision making, and experien-\ntial learning.25 Studies26 support the notion that risky be-\nhaviors (eg, drug use) often begin in adolescence, peak in\nearly adulthood, and diminish over time. Moreover, risky\nbehaviors often co-occur during adolescence.27 For ex-\nample, past-year gambling has been shown to be associ-\nated with alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, drug\nuse, seat belt nonuse, aggressive behavior, and sexual ac-\ntivity in adolescents.25,27 These findings not only suggest\nthat gambling and other risky behaviors be considered\nwithin a neurodevelopmental framework,28 but they also\nhighlight the importance of age-appropriate public health\nguidelines for gambling.29 The findings also suggest that\nscreening and treatment efforts for a variety of adolescent\nriskbehaviors,includingthoseinvolvinggamblingandsub-\nstanceuse,shouldbeintegrated.However,thepresentfind-\ning of a similar pattern of differences in psychiatric mea-\nsures in the adolescent and early-onset adult gamblers\nsuggeststhattheseeffectsarenotdueexclusivelytoasimple\neffect of age but rather are related to the onset of gam-\nbling during or before adolescence.\nAdolescent gamblers were more likely than adoles-\ncent nongamblers to report lifetime depression. Depres-\nsion has been reported15,29 in association with recre-\national and problem or pathological gambling in adults.\nAs in studies of adults, the nature of the association be-\ntween depressed mood and gambling in adolescents can-\nnot be easily discerned from association studies such as\nthe present investigation. The extent to which de-\npressed mood leads to increased gambling (eg, to es-\ncape), gambling leads to depressed mood (eg, through\nfinancial losses or other adverse consequences), or a mu-\ntual factor leads to both (common environmental or ge-\nnetic factors) requires direct examination.\nAdolescent and adult gamblers reported differences in mo-\ntivations to gamble. Compared with adult gamblers, ado-\nlescent gamblers more frequently acknowledged gam-\nbling for social activity and less frequently for personal\nTable 3.

Com-\npared with adult gamblers, few adolescent gamblers re-\nported casino gambling, a finding presumably reflecting\nlegal efforts to restrict adolescent casino gambling or de-\ncreased availability (eg, restricted or limited access to au-\ntomobile transportation). Previous research22 suggests that\nadolescent gambling is socially oriented, similar to sub-\nstance use behaviors in adolescents. Adolescents more\nfrequently than adults acknowledge past-year gambling\nrable or lower rates of past-year gambling on other forms\nof gambling.17 The importance adolescents place on so-\ncializing during risk behaviors has implications for teen\ngambling prevention strategies, for example, money may\nnot represent the major motivating factor for adolescent\ngambling. As such, prevention efforts that focus on in-\ncreasing the availability of nongambling social activities\nwarrant consideration.\nCompared with adults, adolescents less frequently ac-\nknowledge large wins or losses. These differences may\nlargely reflect the financial situation of adolescents, who\ngenerally earn much less than adults. The high rates of\nat-risk and problem gambling in adolescents despite low\nquantity/frequency measures warrant notice. Because the\nmost widely used screen for adult problem gambling, the\nSouth Oaks Gambling Screen,31 heavily scores items re-\nlated to finances (ie, debt), more research is needed into\nthe suitability of specific measures for identifying ado-\nlescents with gambling problems.\nEarly-onset adult and adolescent gamblers were simi-\nlarinseveralimportantways.Specifically,bothgroupswere\nmorelikelythanadult-onsetgamblerstoreportusuallygam-\nblingwithsomeoneandengaginginstrategicformsofgam-\nblingandlesslikelytoparticipateincasinogambling.Thus,\nforboththeadolescentandearly-onsetadultgroupsofgam-\nblers, an element of competitive risk taking seems to exert\na stronger influence on the reasons for gambling and the\ntypes of gambling performed. Adult-onset gamblers were\nleast likely to report usually gambling with someone, sug-\ngesting that the social element present in adolescent gam-\nbling persists for adult gamblers who began gambling dur-\ning adolescence. As with the alcohol and drug abuse/\ndependence measures, the most pronounced differences in\nrates of at-risk and problem gambling and strategic and ca-\nsino gambling variables were observed in the compari-\nsons between adolescent and adult-onset gamblers. Early-\nonset adult gamblers differed from adult-onset gamblers\non the measure of large wins, which suggests that early on-\nset may be associated with \"heavier gambling,\" similar to\nprevious research2,13 demonstrating an association be-\ntween age at gambling onset and gambling severity. Con-\nsistent with this notion, early-onset gamblers were more\nlikely than adult-onset gamblers to report high-frequency\ngambling (at least weekly; OR, 1.72), although this differ-\nence did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study is the first, to our knowledge, to compare ado-\nlescent, early-onset adult, and adult-onset gamblers sys-\ntematically on measures of psychiatric health and gam-\nbling-related attitudes and behaviors. The strengths of\nthe study include a representative sample of the US popu-\nlation acquired through an RDD method using a struc-\ntured interview. One limitation involves the psychiatric\nhealth measures. These measures were limited to depres-\nsion and alcohol and drug use and abuse/dependence and\nwere assessed by a limited number of questions. These\nquestions did not include complete diagnostic criteria,\na limitation in part mitigated by incorporation of diag-\nnostic criteria into the survey questions, following the\nprecedent of other national surveys.17,32 Another limita-\ntion involves survey differences, particularly in the screen-\ning process for gambling pathology. The adolescent and\nadult surveys were conducted separately, introducing the\npossibility of selection bias, and the screening measures\nused differed. All adolescents who had ever gambled were\nasked the NORC Diagnostic Screen; in contrast, only\nadults who acknowledged ever losing $100 or more in a\nyear were surveyed on the NORC Diagnostic Screen. This\ndifference may contribute to lower levels of at-risk and\nproblem gambling in the adult population. The use of\nthe age of 18 years to distinguish adolescents and adults\nhas pros and cons because states vary regarding ages at\nwhich specific forms of gambling become legal. How-\never, 18 years is generally the youngest age at which in-\ndividuals may gamble legally. Other limitations include\nuse of a small sample size relative to statewide surveys\nand limitations inherent to cross-sectional surveys in gen-\neral, including the potential for recall bias, cohort ef-\nfects, differences in respondents' interpretations of ques-\ntions, and the inability to discern cause and effect in the\nobserved associations. Attempts were made to mini-\nmize the effect of recall bias and cohort effects by study-\ning a narrowly defined age group of young adults (aged\n18-29 years). The findings of differences in adolescent\nand early-onset adult gambling compared with adult-\nonset gambling in relation to measures of psychiatric\nhealth, and of differences in gambling attitudes and be-\nhaviors among groups of adolescent, early-onset adult,\nand adult-onset gamblers, hold multiple implications for\nyouth gambling health guidelines and prevention and\ntreatment strategies. The observation that the associa-\ntions of gambling with substance use and abuse/\ndependence measures were most pronounced in groups\nreporting early-onset gambling suggests that gambling\nduring adolescence may substantially impact adult func-\ntion. These findings highlight the need for longitudinal\nstudies to examine the effect of gambling on younger age\ngroups, particularly as the availability and social accep-\ntance of legalized gambling increases. Information gath-\nered from such studies could be of great value in gener-\nating health guidelines for gambling in adolescents and\nadults.\nSubmitted for Publication: June 2, 2003; final revision\nCorrespondence: Wendy J.
