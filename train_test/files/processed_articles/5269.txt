The effect\nof low doses of guaiacol and ethanol on enzyme activities was manifested in an\noscillating manner. Similar response patterns were observed when pure enzymes\nwere exposed to the same serial dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol. T uersicolor\ncultures enriched with 40 mmol guaiacol (simulating natural environmental condi-\ntions) also displayed oscillating enzyme activity patterns in response to serial dilu-\ntions ofguaiacol, but the maximum enzyme activity values were increased compared\nto those observed in cultures not receiving 40 mmol guaiacol. The differences\nbetween maxima and minima varied among the experimental groups and de-\npended on the species of fungus, type of effector, and kind of enzyme.

The concentration of effectors is very important for initiation\nof even ts such as the activation of chemoreceptors or cascade of apoptotic processes\nin humans (Calabrese 2001a,b,c), as well as mechanisms of biochemical immuniza-\nRapoport and Luebering (1951) reported that diphosphoglycerate phosphatase\nis strongly activated by low concentrations of potential metabolic poisons, Hg(lI) or\nAg(l) ions. In 1964 Dixon and Webb reported that some effectors can act as poisons\nfor some enzymes and activators for others. More recently, bimodal types of regu-\nlation of tyrosine kinase by low doses of the inhibitor genistein (Morimoto and\nBonavida 1992) and of protein kinase C by very low concentration of some antioxi-\ndants (Maltseva 2002) have been described.\n\" Effectors are usually divided into activators and inhibitors, but according to the\nhormetic principle the concept of activation and inhibition is strongly dependent\non the concentration of effectors and their time of action (Calabrese and Baldwin\nFungi were chosen as the experimental model because they can be grown on\nvarious substrates and produce large amounts of extracellular enzymes, such as\nlaccase and peroxidase, which cause the white rot of wood and are involved with the\nprocess of enzymatic delignification (Leonowicz et al. 1999; Luterek et al: 1998;\nMalarczyk and Widenska 2002). These enzymes are sensitive to the presence ofvarious\nsmall molecular effectors that regulate the reactions involving the biodegradation of\nlignin and transformation ofnatural phenolics (Molitoris, 2001; Malarczyk etal: 2001).\nMany aromatic substances, mainly alcohols, aldehydes and acids such as ferulic,\nvanillic, and anisic are substrates for laccase. The induction oflaccase is also possible\nwith the same natural aromatic activators or similar synthetic substances such as 2,5-\nxylidin (Rogalski and Leonowicz 1992). Peroxidase, which requires H2\nas a co-\nsubstrate, is often activated by the same substances. This article describes the effects\nof very low doses of guaiacol and ethanol on the activity of extracellular laccase and\nperoxidase in the liquid cultures oftwo fungi, Trametes versicolorand Pleurotus sajor-caju.\nPure Enzymes\nCerrerut unicolorlaccase was purified in the Biochemistry Department, MCS Uni-\nversity in Lublin according to the procedure described by Luterek et al: (1998).\nHorseradish peroxidase was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company.\nBiological Models and Culture Conditions\nTwo species of fungi from the fungi collection of the Biochemistry Department,\nM.C.S. University, Lublin, Poland (i.e., strains Trametes versicolor, designated No. 20\nand Pleurotussnjor-caiu, designated No. 100 in the collection) were used as biological\nHonnetic Effect of Guaiacol and Ethanol on Enzymatic Activity of Fungi\nsources oflaccase and peroxidase. Fungal mycelia were inoculated on the Lindeberg\nmedium according to the method described by Luterek et at. (1998). After 10 days,\nthe mycelia were homogenized with glass beads. Small conical flasks containing 10\nml medium were inoculated with the homogenate (0.5 ml homogenate/flask).\nTwenty-one flasks (a control and 20 serial dilutions of enzyme) were used in each\nexperiment. Each experiment was replicated three times.\nPreparation of Dilution and Stimulation Course\nSerial dilutions (one part effector solution to 99 part'! 75% ethanol) were pre-\npared from solutions of guaiacol and ethanol (initial concentrations of 0.3 mol/L\nand 16 mol/L, respectively). The concentrations of the serial dilutions ranged from\nexplanation of molecular changes that may occur at ultra high dilutions]. Twenty III\nof serial dilutions were added to the cultures every second day, beginning on day 3\nof the experiment (a total o\u00a3120 Ill/flask over the course of the 14-day experiment).\nControl cultures received after 14 days a total amount 120 Ill/flask of 75% ethanol\nonly. For experiments with pure enzymes, 200 III of serial dilutions were added to\neach flask containing 200 III of purified laccase or peroxidase in 700 III of proper\nbuffer and enzyme activities were measured at the end of 1 hour.\nEnzyme Assays\nLaccase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using syringaldazine (2.5 1lM)\nas the substrate in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 according to the method\nofLeonowicz and Grzywnowicz (1981). Peroxidase activity was measured using 4 IlM\nof o-dianisidine in methanol and 10 mmoles of H\nas the substrate and co-\nsubstrate, respectively, in 0.1 M acetate-Na buffer, pH 5.5 according to the method\nof Claiborne and Fridovich (1979). Enzyme activities were expressed in nkatals\nwhere one nkatal is defined as the enzymatic degradation of one nmole ofsubstrate\nduring 1 sec and one international unit of enzymatic activity correspond to 16.67\nnkatals.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using the software package\nSTATGRAPHICS version 2.6. Line regressing analyses were performed for the data\nfrom all 14 experiments presented in Table 1 and Figures 1 to 4. Trend lines are\nshowed in all figures with proper equations. The values of maximal and minimal\npoints (lying above or below the trend lines) were summarized and put in Figure 5\nto illustrate how various dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol can work to activate and\ninhibit laccase and peroxidase activities (see also ]a\\jock and Lewis, 2002).\nRESULTS\nOscillatory changes were observed in laccase and peroxidase activities in the\nmedia of both fungal species exposed to serial dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol.\n....\n'J\n=\nLaccase activities measured on day 15 in the media of Trametes versicolor cultures grown in serial dilutions of ethanol and guaiacol,\nrespectively (A and B).

Comparative analysis for the data from all 14 experiments presented in Table 1 and Figures 1 to 4. Trend lines are showed in all\nthese figures and the values ofmaximal and minimal points (lying above or below the trend lines) were summarized to illustrate the\nactivating or inhibiting possibilities of various dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol against laccase and peroxidase activities.\nMalarczyk et al.\nThe oscillations were characterized by a similar number of maximal and minimal\nlevels of activity (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1 no. 1 to 8).\nSimilar oscillatory changes were observed in 40 mmol guaiacol-enriched cultures\nof T versirulorexposed to serial dilutions ofguaiacol. However, the distance between\nthe maximal and minimal activity values increased more dramatically. For peroxi-\ndase it reached approximately 2570 nkatals (Figure 3, Table 1 no. 9) and for laccase\nit reached up to 5870 nkatals (Figure 3, Table 1 no. 10). The corresponding values\nfor non-activated cultures of T versicolorwere approximately 680 nkatals for peroxi-\nOscillatory changes were also observed in solutions of purified laccase and\nperoxidase, although the distance between the maximal and minimal activity values\nwere much lower compared to those obtained from the fungal culture media (i.e.,\nfor peroxidase the distance between maximum and minimum did not exceed 90\nnkatals (Figure 4 C and D, Table 1 no. 11 and 12) and for laccase the distance did\nnot exceed 40 nkatals (Figure 4 A and B, Table 1 no. 13 and 14). The frequency of\noscillations in enzymatic activity, however, was similar to that observed for the\nenzymes in fungal cultures.\nFigure 5 represents an assessment of the combined data for the 14 different\nexperiments and indicates the most likely probability of observing a maximal enzy-\nmatic activity.\nDISCUSSION\nGuaiacol and ethanol are found in the natural environment and essential for the\nmetabolism of the fungi Trametes and Pleurotus. Increasing dilutions ofboth effectors\nshowed the exponential dependence between the enzymatic protein reaction and\nthe effector's concentration. The oscillatory character of activity changes was ob-\nserved for both enzymes in showing systematically repeated frequencies (Figure 5),\nindicating the tendency of some effector's dilutions to stimulate the enzyme activity\nwhile other dilutions inhibit.\nIt should be emphasized that in all experimental conditions the oscillatory\npatterns were similar. However, the distance between maximum and minimum of\nactivity did vary among the experimental groups and depended on the species of\nfungus, type of effector and kind of enzyme. Generally, the laccase activity level in\nthe Trametes cultures was always higher than that in the Pleurotus cultures, which had\nan effect on the distance between the maximum and minimum activity values.\nGuaiacol showed a greater stimulation of laccase activity in both Trametes and\nPleurotus cultures, whereas ethanol showed a greater stimultaion of peroxidase\nactivity in the Pleurotus cultures.\nIn the case of Trametes cultures enriched with 40 mmol of guaiacol, statistically\nsignificant (p=0.05; see Figure 3) increases in the activities of both enzymes were\nobserved in response to serial dilutions of guaiacol. Maximum laccase activity\nincreased to approximately 8000 nkatals compared with 504 nkatals in the control\nHormetic Effect of Guaiacol and Ethanol on Enzymatic Activity of Fungi\ncultures. Maximum peroxidase activity increased to 4250 nkatals compared to 54\nnkatals in the control cultures. It is conceivable that this activation can take place\nin nature in in vivo conditions during fungal growth. Low concentrations ofguaiacol\nmay be generated during fungal metabolism of various phenol substances.\nChanges in activity of both enzymes (Table 1) assume the shape of the letters\nJ or U described as characteristic of hormesis (Calabrese 2001). The occurrence\nof oscillatory patterns of enzyme activation/inhibition in response to effectors\nshould be examined for other species of fungi and other enzymes. The findings\nreported here suggest the possibility of subtle regulation of enzymatic activity on\nthe molecular level and clarification of these processes should be the focus of\nfuture research.\n"
