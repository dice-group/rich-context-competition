Kelly, PhD\nA longitudinal investigation of childcare for children with developmental disabilities (N = 89) was\nconducted, with in-person assessments at 12, 15, 30, and 45 months of age, and phone interviews\nwith mothers at 14, 29, 37, and 44 months. When compared with typically developing children\nfrom another sample, and with census data, the participants entered childcare at an older age and\nfor fewer hours; they were more likely to be in \"informal\" (father, relative, in-home nonrelative)\ncare; and they were less likely to transition into more formal care (childcare center, childcare\nhome) with increasing age. Finding good-quality care, the cost of care, distance/transportation\nissues, and integration with other services/special needs received the highest ratings for childcare\nissues. Children who were not in childcare had lower adaptive behavior scores if their mothers\ncited their child's special needs as an issue in keeping them out of care, compared with children\nwhose mothers did not indicate that special needs were an issue. These 2 groups did not differ\nin their diagnoses, mental, or motor development scores. Results are discussed in the context\nof family leave policies and welfare work exemptions, and the need for high-quality caregiving\noptions.

In an earlier report on the present sam-\nple of children with disabilities, as well as chil-\ndren with biomedical risk factors, we found\nthat more than 58% were in some form of\nnonmaternal childcare by 15 months of age\n(Booth & Kelly, 1998). Thus, it would appear\nthat the need for childcare is no less evident\namong families of children with special needs\nthan it is for families of typically developing\nchildren. In fact, childcare issues have been\namong the most important problems reported\nby parents of children with disabilities in\nsurvey research (Axtell, Garwick, Patterson,\nBennett, & Blum, 1995; Bailey, Blasco, &\nSimeonsson, 1992; Freedman, Litchfield, &\nHorner, Rawlins, & Giles, 1987; Palfrey,\nLike many other families with young chil-\ndren, families of children with disabilities are\nfaced with a variety of childcare issues, such\nas finding good-quality, affordable care that is\nwithin a reasonable distance from home or\nwork. Additionally, they are faced with logisti-\ncal problems such as transportation between\nearly intervention (or special education) and\nchildcare programs, and with limited avail-\nability of childcare options due to their chil-\ndren's special care needs. Despite federal\nmandates that all early childhood programs\nmust be accessible to all children (Americans\ngrams are not equipped to meet the needs\nof these children (Bredekamp, 1993), and\nmany caregivers lack the appropriate train-\ning (Crowley, 1990; Dinnebeil, McInerney,\nWarfield & Hauser-Cram, 1996). Additionally,\nthe severity of the child's disability or ill-\nness compounds these problems (Breslau,\nSalkever, & Staruch, 1982; Stoiber, Gettinger,\n1996). Although model training and consul-\ntation programs have yielded encouraging re-\nsults (eg, Giovinazzo & Cook, 1995; Jones &\njority of caregivers have not received such\ntraining.\nIn order to find out more about patterns of\nchildcare usage and the childcare needs and\nchallenges of families of children with disabil-\nities, we examined data from the Early Child\nCare Study of Children with Special Needs, a\nlongitudinal study conducted by the present\nauthors. The main purpose of this ecological\nstudy was to examine the complex interac-\ntions among child and family characteristics,\nand the effects of varying quantity and quality\nof home and childcare environments on the\ndevelopment of children with disabilities and\nbiomedical risk factors from 12 to 45 months\nof age (see Booth & Kelly, 2002). In the con-\ntext of this study, we collected a wealth of lon-\ngitudinal data about the age at which these\nchildren entered nonmaternal childcare, the\nweekly hours spent in care, and the type of\ncare, as well as interview data about mothers'\nreasons for not using childcare, the problems\nand issues of mothers who chose to use child-\ncare, and the particular problem of integrating\nchildcare with other services. In this report,\nwe focus on the children who had diagnosed\ndisabilities by the age of 12 months.\nIn describing patterns of childcare usage,\nwe have included data for comparison pur-\nposes from the typically developing children\nenrolled in the NICHD Study of Early Child\nCare, a 10-site national longitudinal investiga-\ntion of over 1300 children and their families\n(see NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-\nwork [ECCRN], 2001). This is a particularly\nappropriate comparison sample because we\npatterned the research design and data collec-\ntion methods for the Special Needs study after\nthe NICHD study, for which we are investiga-\ntors also. We have included some additional\ncomparisons with the most recent US cen-\nsus data about childcare, based on the Spring\n1997 Survey of Income and Program Partici-\npation, which provide a \"snapshot\" of fami-\nlies' patterns of childcare usage in the previ-\nous month prior to the survey (Smith, 2002).\nChildren with disabilities (n = 89) and their\nmothers enrolled in the Special Needs study\nwhen the children were approximately 12\nmonths old, and we collected data through\n45 months of age.

We did not include children who\nhad severe visual or hearing impairments, be-\ncause of assessment difficulties. We included\nchildren in the present report at 30 and 45\nmonths only if they had demonstrated a 25%\nor greater developmental delay.\nParticipation in childcare\nOur first question concerned the extent to\nwhich families used nonmaternal childcare\nover time in this sample. We found that more\nn (%)\nNote: At 12 months, children were included in the diagnosed group if they qualified for early intervention services\nbecause of developmental delays and other special needs.

At 30 and\n45 months, children were included in the delayed group if they had a 25% or greater developmental delay.\nthan half of the families had children in some\nform of childcare arrangement by 14 months,\nand use of childcare increased over time, as\nof the children were in some form of nonma-\nternal childcare, and this figure increased to\n74% by 45 months. The average across ages\nreported in the census data. Although the\npercentage of children with disabilities in\nchildcare increased over time, as shown in\nFig 1, these numbers were considerably lower\nthan the percentage of typically developing\nchildren in childcare in the NICHD study.

The number of hours per\nweek of childcare in the NICHD sample from\n3 to 54 months of age was higher, with a\nfact, the latter figure may be an underestimate,\nFig 1.

Although the\nproportion of children in center care was very\nsimilar in the 2 samples at 14 months, there\nwas a dramatic increase in center-care use\nin the typically developing sample over time,\nwhile the proportion of children in center\ncare in the delayed sample remained relatively\nstable with increasing age.\nWe also compared types of care in the\nSpecial Needs sample with the most recent\ncensus data. Because the census data were\ncollected at only one point in time for a cross\nsection of preschoolers of all ages, we com-\npared these figures with the average across\ntime for the Special Needs sample. We found\nthat children with disabilities were less likely\nto be in center care (18% vs 24%), more likely\nto be in informal care (71% vs 64%), and about\nequally likely to be in childcare homes (11% vs\nFor those mothers whose children were in\nchildcare, we asked them to rate (from 1 = no\nproblem to 5 = a very big problem) the ex-\ntent to which 7 childcare issues were prob-\nlematic for them. These issues were: (a) find-\ning good-quality care, (b) confidence in staff,\n(c) integration with services, (d) cost, (e) spe-\ncial equipment or needs, (f) distance, and (g)\nMean (SD)\ntransportation. These data appear in Table 4.\nAlthough there were a range of ratings for\neach item, it is interesting that the average\nscore for each item was less than 3. In other\nwords, mothers did not find these issues to\nbe particularly problematic. Nonetheless, the\nrank order of the ratings is interesting.\nThe item that received the highest (ie, most\nproblematic) rating at each age was find-\ning good-quality care. At 15 months of age,\nthe cost of childcare, distance to childcare,\nand transportation issues were the next most\nfrequent problems. However, at 30 and 45\nmonths, integration with services received\nan increasingly high problem rating. This may\nreflect changes in services provided for these\nchildren, as they transition into more formal\nspecial education programs.\nAs of 37 months of age, 61% of the children\nhad entered a special education program, and\nthis number increased to 95% by 44 months.\nOf the children enrolled in special education,\n44 months) were also participating in some\nform of nonmaternal childcare. Thus, families\nwere faced with the challenge of coordinat-\ning childcare with special education. Still, it\nshould be noted that the ratings for integrat-\ning services were still relatively low, and this is\nreflected in mothers'specific responses about\nwhether they had a problem coordinating spe-\ncial education with childcare. At 37 months,\nTable 5. Children's special needs as a reason for not using childcare at 15, 30, and 45 months\nn (%)\nNote: For the first row, percentages relate to the total respondents; for the second row, percentages relate to the total\nrespondents without childcare.\nAt 15 months, mothers were asked if they had used childcare since the child's birth; at 30 and 45 months, mothers\nwere asked whether they were currently using childcare for 10 or more hours per week.\nonly 6% of the mothers reported coordination\nproblems, and at 44 months, 23%. Interest-\ningly, at 37 months, only 9% of the mothers\nwhose children were enrolled in special edu-\ncation plus childcare indicated that their Indi-\nvidualized Family Service Plan specifically ad-\ndressed the coordination between programs;\nat 44 months, this figure was only 5%.\nA final question concerned the extent to\nwhich the children's special needs were a fac-\ntor in families' decision to not use childcare.\nThese data are shown in Table 5. At 15 months\nof age, 36% of the mothers who had made the\ndecision not to use childcare cited their chil-\ndren'sspecial needs as a reason. At 30 months,\nTable 6 shows a series of comparisons\nof children whose mothers said that special\nneeds were an issue in deciding against child-\ncare, and children whose mothers did not give\nthis reason. We expected that children in the\nformer group would have more severe impair-\nments or perhaps would have different diag-\nnoses than would children in the latter group.\nChi-square analyses at each age indicated\nthat the groups did not differ in their di-\nagnoses. A series of t tests comparing the\ngroups on mental, motor, and adaptive be-\nhavior scores at each age produced signifi-\ncant group differences only for adaptive be-\ncally, mothers who cited their children's spe-\ncial needs as a reason for not using childcare\nhad children with lower adaptive behavior\nscores than did mothers who did not give this\nreason.\nAlthough we expect adaptive behavior to\nbe related to mental and motor development\nscores, and to some extent, diagnoses, it is\ninteresting that adaptive behavior was the sig-\nnificant one discriminating the group of chil-\ndren whose mothers kept them out of child-\ncare because of special needs. That is, it was\nthe children's day-to-day functioning that ap-\npeared to be of primary concern when con-\nsidering childcare.\nDISCUSSION\nPatterns of care\nFrom our longitudinal analyses of data from\nthe Early Child Care Study of Children with\nSpecial Needs, we found that families of chil-\ndren with disabilities have needs for child-\ncare that are comparable to the needs of fam-\nilies with typically developing children. Even\nthough the percentage of children with dis-\nabilities participating in childcare during the\npreschool years was lower than the percent-\nage of children in the NICHD study (means of\n65% vs 80%), the former figure was very simi-\nlar to the percentage reported in the census\ndata (63%). Regardless of these differences,\nit is clear that participation in nonmaternal\nchildcare during the preschool years is as\nChildcare Patterns 13\nTable 6.

On average, the children\nwith disabilities entered childcare about 6\nmonths later and, by conservative estimate,\nfor at least 6 fewer hours per week. Notably,\nthe 21.4 average weekly hours in the present\nreport is very similar to the 22.2 hours\nreported in the Warfield and Hauser-Cram\ndisabilities.\nThe children with disabilities also were\nmore likely to be in informal care through-\nout the first few years of life, rather than tran-\nsitioning to more formal care as did many\nof the typically developing children. These\nfindings echo other reports in the literature.\nSpecifically, Landis (1992) found that spouses\nprovided the largest proportion of type of\ncare among young children (birth to 3 years)\nwith special needs; in an older (5-year-old)\ngroup of children with disabilities, Warfield\nand Hauser-Cram (1996) found that care pro-\nvided by relatives was most common and\ncenter-based care the least common.\nChildcare choices\nFamilies of children with special needs may\nchoose informal care for a number of reasons.\nOne is that much of this care is provided by\nfathers or other relatives and parents may be-\nlieve that family members know best about\nhow to meet the child'sspecific special needs,\nand/or appropriate alternative care may not\nbe available. The fact that finding good qual-\nity care was the most prominent concern of\nmothers of children in childcare supports the\nlatter idea. This issue is a recurring theme that\nhas been found in prior research (Cuskelly,\nPulman, & Hayes, 1998; Warfield & Hauser-\nRegardless of federal mandates about in-\nclusion of children with disabilities in child-\ncare programs, many are not equipped to\nmeet the needs of these children (Bredekamp,\n1993) and many caregivers lack the appro-\npriate training (Crowley, 1990; Dinnebeil\nCram, 1996). The inadequate supply of ap-\npropriate childcare arrangements may be\nespecially problematic as the children with\ndisabilities approach school age. The NICHD\ndata showed a trend toward participation in\nmore formal childcare arrangements as the\nchildren aged. These arrangements may pro-\nvide more structured educational experiences\nas well as opportunities to develop social\nskills with peers, which would be expected\nto provide important benefits in the transi-\ntion to school. The continued reliance over\ntime on informal care in the Special Needs\nsample might be less beneficial in the sense\nthat these children would be missing out on\nimportant experiences, including daily inter-\nactions with their typically developing peers,\nand their transition to school might be more\nproblematic.\nIt is also interesting that families who chose\nnot to use childcare because of their child's\ndisability had children with lower adaptive be-\nhavior scores than did children whose moth-\ners did not indicate that their child's special\nneeds were a reason to keep their child out\nof childcare. Once again, these data point\nto the need for providing appropriate child-\ncare alternatives for families of children with\nmore severe disabilities. This is especially\nproblematic in light of evidence from the\npresent project about the effects of childcare\non children'sdevelopment (see Booth & Kelly,\n2002). We found that after taking the child's\ninitial level of adaptive behavior into account,\nincreases in adaptive behavior were related to\nchildren's participation in high-quality child-\ncare. Thus, these data suggest that given ap-\npropriate high-quality childcare alternatives,\nchildren functioning at a lower level of adap-\ntive behavior may benefit from participation\nin such care, and lack of such alternatives may\nplace these children even further behind their\npeers when they enter school.\nChildcare costs\nAnother reason that parents may choose\ncare by family members is that it is \"free\" or\nfar less costly than other types of care, and\nthis may be an economic necessity for fami-\nlies. In fact, we found that the cost of child-\ncare was another one of the primary concerns\nof mothers of children in childcare. At the\nsame gross income level, families of children\nwith special needs have additional expenses\nsuch as medication, special services and activ-\nities, transportation, etc, resulting in a lower\nnet income than do families of children with-\nout special needs (Gunn & Berry, 1987). Thus,\nmothers' income may be even more neces-\nsary in families in which the child has a dis-\nability than it is in other families. Adding the\ncost of childcare to these additional expenses\nmay be highly problematic for families, par-\nticularly for those who are low-income, and\nchildren with special needs are overrepre-\nsented in poverty samples (Bennett & Gural-\nnick, l991). For example, in Washington State,\n75% of children under the age of 3 who are\nenrolled in Infant/Toddler Early Intervention\nPrograms (children with established disabili-\nties or at environmental or biological risk of\ndisability) are Medicaid recipients (Washing-\nton State Department of Social and Health Ser-\nIn some families, the decision for the\nmother to stay at home and care for a child\nwith a disability is one that can be made with-\nout adverse financial consequences. How-\never, in other families, maternal employment\nmay be absolutely necessary for the economic\nwell-being of the family. In fact, in a small\nAustralian study, Cuskelly et al., (1998) found\nthat 100% of mothers of children with special\nneeds, but only 60% of mothers of children\nwithout disabilities indicated that they were\nemployed because their \"wage is needed.\" In\nChildcare Patterns 15\nsuch cases, families may have few options\nabout the type and quality of care arrange-\nment to select.\nThese data suggest the importance of\nstrengthening family leave policies to include\nmore families who might benefit from job-\nprotected leave under the provisions of the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In l995,\nonly 54.9% of workers met the FMLA em-\nployee eligibility requirements, which include\ncontinuous, full-time work for a covered em-\nployer (Department of Labor, l995). In addi-\ntion, the FMLA provides only unpaid leave,\nwhich is not sufficient for mothers depen-\ndent on their own contributions to the family\nincome.\nIn low-income families, particularly those\nwith single mothers, the need for the mother\nto stay at home and care for her young child\nwith special needs may result in the need\nfor government assistance. Ironically, the cur-\nrent welfare-to-work Temporary Assistance to\nNeedy Family (TANF) regulations may pro-\nvide only a few months' respite from work\nrequirements, unless families can qualify for\na hardship exemption. However, not all fam-\nilies of children with disabilities living in\npoverty will be able to obtain a hardship ex-\nemption, and the lack of provision for child-\ncare assistance for mothers who are forced\nto enter the workforce despite their chil-\ndren's special needs, compounds the prob-\nlem of inadequate care alternatives (Ohlson,\nIntegrating services and programs\nAnother issue for families was the problem\nof integrating other services with childcare,\nespecially as the children transitioned into for-\nmal special education programs. These data\npoint to the need not only to address the is-\nsue of appropriate childcare alternatives, but\nalso to assist families in coordinating their\nchildcare choices with educational programs\nthat are not scheduled around parents' work\nhours. Very few of the mothers in this study in-\ndicated that their IFSP addressed the need for\ncoordination of childcare and other services,\nsuggesting the need for improvement in this\narea.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, our study results suggest\nthat families of children with disabilities\nwould benefit from increased options about\nwhether and when to initiate childcare, and\nthe type of care to use. From a policy per-\nspective, this may mean increased funding\nfor hands-on caregiver training and education\n(Stoiber et al., 1998), on the one hand, and\nincreased funding for family leave and wel-\nfare work exemptions, on the other. Every\nchild with a disability should have access to\nthe most optimal care for their specific needs,\nwhether that means care by the mother, by\nanother family member, or by another well-\ntrained care-provider.\nREFERENCES\nAxtell, S.
