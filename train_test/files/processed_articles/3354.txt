Although it\nmainly acts as a regulator of metal homeostasis such as zinc and copper in tissues, MT also acts as a\npotent antioxidant and adaptive (or stress) protein to protect cells and tissues from oxidative stress.\nDiabetes affects many Americans and other populations, and its development and toxic effect on\nvarious organs have been attributed to increased oxidative stress. Studies showed that zinc-induced or\ngenetically enhanced pancreatic MT synthesis prevented diabetes induced by chemicals such as strep-\ntozotocin and alloxan, and zinc pretreatment also prevented spontaneously developed diabetes. Since\ndiabetic complications are the consequences of organ damage caused by diabetic hyperglycemia and\nhyperlipidemia through oxidative stress, whether MT in nonpancreatic organs also provides a pre-\nventive effect on diabetic toxicity has been recently investigated. We demonstrated that overexpression\nof cardiac MT significantly prevented diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy. Likewise, overexpression of\nrenal MT also prevented diabetes-induced renal toxicity. In addition, we also found that MT as an\nadaptive protein is overexpressed in several organs in response to diabetes. Therefore, the biological\nimportance of diabetes-induced MT in diabetic complications and subsequent other pathogenesis was\nfurther explored. We found that diabetes-induced hepatic and renal MT synthesis was accompanied\nby a significant prevention of endotoxin-induced hepatic toxicity and cisplatin-induced renal toxi-\ncity. These studies suggest that MT as an adaptive protein can prevent both diabetes development\nand its complications or subsequent suffered other pathogenic injury.\nKeywords. metallothionein, diabetes, oxidative stress, diabetic complications, adaptive protein\nINTRODUCTION\nMetallothioneins (MTs) are a group of intracellular metal-binding and\ncysteine-enriched proteins.

Compared with other antioxidants that can protect specifically against\ncertain damage--SOD against superoxide radical, catalase against hydrogen\nperoxide, and glutathione peroxidase against hydrogen peroxide and lipid\nperoxides--MT is a potent antioxidant against a wide range of free radi-\ncals including the most active radicals: hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite\nDiabetes affects so many Americans and other populations around the\nworld. Cardiovascular injury from diabetes contributes greatly to various di-\nabetic complications including renal, retinal, and cardiac dysfunction and\nabetes onset and its complications have been considered to be due to the\ngeneration of oxidative stress caused by diabetes; therefore, developing a\nstrategy for prevention of diabetic onset and its complications through sup-\npression of oxidative stress has received investigative attention (Cai and Kang,\nthat Zn-induced MT synthesis in rat pancreas prevented chemical streptozo-\ntocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (Yang and Cherian, 1994), and we have shown\nthat overexpressed MT in the mouse heart significantly prevented diabetes-\npreliminary studies have been further confirmed and characterized by later\nstudies. In this article, the summarized data based on our own and other stud-\nies for the prevention of diabetes onset, its complications, and subsequent\nsuffered pathogenic injury were presented to extend our insight into MT\nprevention of diabetes and its toxicity.\nEarly published data on the preventive effect of MT on diabetes onset and\ndiabetic complications were obtained by searching MEDLINE using MT and\ndiabetes and selected after studying the content of these publications. Our\nown studies were performed in a mouse diabetic model which was produced\nby giving a single injection of 150 mg/kg STZ as described by Cai et al. (2002a).\nMT Prevents Diabetes\nIn the study by Yang and Cherian (1994), diabetes was produced by a\nsingle injection of STZ (75 mg/kg) in Sprague Dawley rats, and the synthesis\nMetallothionein and Diabetes 91\nFIGURE 1 Changes of Zn and MT in tissues, and serum MT and glucose.

At day 1 (30 hr) after STZ, (A) Zn and (B) MT levels were measured.\nIn addition, (C) serum MT and (D) glucose levels were also measured on days 1, 21, and 45 after STZ\non the results of a study by Yang and Cherian (1994) with permission from the authors.\nof pancreatic MT was induced by subcutaneous Zn injection 12 hr before\ninjection of STZ. Results, summarized in Figure 1, indicate that both Zn\nand MT levels increased in the pancreas of rats on day 1 after STZ treat-\nment. Serum MT was also significantly increased in the Zn + STZ group on\ndays 1, 21, and 45 after STZ treatment. More importantly, serum glucose\nlevels in both STZ and Zn + STZ groups increased compared with the con-\ntrol group, but the level of glucose in the Zn + STZ group was significantly\nlower than that in the STZ group (Figure 1D). This result suggests that MT\ninduction by Zn pretreatment could significantly prevent STZ-induced dia-\nbetes. Subsequent experiments supporting the case for prevention against\ndiabetes development by MT are summarized in Table 1 with the following\ncharacteristics.\nZn supplement was the most commonly used agent to induce pancreatic\nMT synthesis for prevention of the diabetic development.

By in situ immunohistochemical methods,\nMT induction has been specifically identified in islet -cells. Cu is another\nsignificant prevention of diabetes induced by multiple low doses of STZ\n(Sitasawad et al., 2001). In addition, a transgenic mouse model was devel-\noped in which MT is pancreatic-specifically expressed about 20-fold higher\nthan the wild type without alteration of other antioxidants, and a signifi-\ncantly high resistance to STZ-induced diabetic development was observed in\nthis mouse model (Chen et al., 2001), suggesting the direct prevention by\nMT of STZ-induced diabetes.\nInduced MT synthesis prevents diabetes development in a wide range of\ndiabetic models. It has been recently reported that multiple low doses of STZ\ninduce a diabetic model mechanistically different from that induced by a sin-\nInduced MT synthesis in pancreas not only prevented diabetes induced by\na single dose of STZ or alloxan, but it also prevented diabetes induced by\nmultiple low doses of STZ, and even genetically prodiabetic models such as\nMetallothionein and Diabetes 93\nthe BB Wister rat and db/db or od/od mouse diabetes development. This\nsuggests that MT can prevent both type I and type II diabetes.\nThe preventive effect of T on diabetes could be seen in different strains of\nrats and mice. The preventive effect of induced MT synthesis in pancreas was\nnot affected by species difference for the diabetic development in response to\nSTZ. For example, C57BL/6 mice typically start severe hyperglycemia 2 weeks\nafter the first injection of STZ, whereas B6SJL/F1 mice show a long latent\nperiod for developing severe hyperglycemia about 10 weeks after the first\ninjection of STZ (Ohly et al., 2000). However, the preventive effect of induced\nMT synthesis in pancreas was significantly observed in both diabetic models.\nMT Prevents Diabetic Complications\nIncreasing evidence in both experimental and clinical studies suggests\nthat free radicals are formed disproportionately in diabetes by glucose ox-\nidation, nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, and the subsequent oxidative\ndegradation of glycated proteins. These consequences of oxidative stress play\na major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (Cai and Kang,\nof glucose induce cardiac cell death along with significant ROS formation\n(Cai et al., 2002a). In diabetic rats, abnormal spermatogenesis was found\ndue to germ cell death (Cai et al., 2000b). Therefore, we hypothesized that\ndiabetes-caused oxidative stress may play a critical role in inducing cell death\nin diabetes-targeted organs leading to severe organ dysfunction, and MT as a\npotent antioxidant may prevent diabetic complications through suppression\nof diabetic oxidative damage.\nFirst we have preliminarily explored the preventive effect of MT in the\nheart on diabetes-induced cardiac toxicity (Cai and Kang, 2001b; Kang and\nCai, 2001). We found that diabetes-caused cardiac toxicity, measured by\nserum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and cardiac cell death, could be pre-\nvented in cardiac-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice (Cai and Kang,\nsubsequent studies on the preventive role of MT in diabetes-induced car-\ndiac toxicities. These studies suggested that MT in the hearts showed sig-\nnificant prevention against diabetes-induced serum cardiac enzyme activity,\nmyocardial cell death, oxidative damage, and abnormal morphology and\nfunction.\nA different transgenic mouse model in which MT is whole-body over-\nexpressed was also used to investigate the protective effect of MT on dia-\nbetic toxicity. MT expression in the heart and kidney of transgenic (MT-TG)\nmice was significantly higher than that of their wild-type (WT) counterparts\n(Figure 2A, Cai et al., unpublished data). Our preliminary study (Cai et al.,\nunpublished data) showed that diabetes was developed by administration of\na single dose of STZ (150 mg/kg) in both MT-TG and WT mice.

These studies, therefore, strongly indicate that\nMT as a potent antioxidant significantly prevents the diabetes-induced car-\ndiac and renal toxicities, respectively, and results in a prevention of these\norgan dysfunctions.\nMT Induced by Diabetes Prevents Subsequent Pathogenic Injury\nMT is also up-regulated in various organs in response to various types\nof stress, making it a so-called adaptive response (stress) protein (Klaassen\nMT expression was significantly enhanced in the liver and kidney of 1- and\n6-month diabetic rats (Cai et al., 2002b) and in organs of 2-month diabetic\nmice (Figure 3). However, what biological importance diabetes-induced MT\nplays in diabetes and other coexisting pathogenesis has received limited in-\nvestigative attention.\nWe recently investigated the effect of diabetes on endotoxin-induced hep-\natic toxicity by measuring serum hepatic enzymes in normal and 2-month\ndiabetic mice after endotoxin treatment. We found that 2-month diabetes an-\nimals exhibited a significant increase in hepatic MT expression compared to\nnondiabetic mice (Figure 3), and endotoxin further enhances the diabetes-\ninduced MT expression (Song et al., unpublished data). More important,\ndiabetic animals exhibited significantly reduced endotoxin-induced hepatic\ninjury, showing significantly lower serum ALT activity and hepatic lipid per-\noxidation (TBARS) than one would expect from LPS-treated diabetic mice\n(Figure 4).\nIn support of this observation, an early study demonstrated that renal MT\nsynthesis was increased in diabetic mice and was accompanied by a significant\nMetallothionein and Diabetes 95\nFIGURE 2 MT concentrations in the tissue of transgenic mice and its prevention from diabetic toxicity.\nAdult (8\u00ad10-week-old) male transgenic mice in which MT-I/II genes are overexpressed in whole-body\nand their wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were used to measure cardiac and renal MT by Cd-hem methods\n(Cai et al., 2002b).

In addi-\ntion, earlier studies have shown the preventive effects of diabetes on subse-\nquent ischemia-induced cardiac injuries (Bouchard and Lamontagne, 1998;\nalso be related to the induction of cardiac MT in response to diabetes as\nindicated in Figure 3. In summary, these results indicated that diabetes at\ncertain stages of its pathogenesis can provide a resistance to subsequent insult-\ninduced toxicity, and this enhanced resistance may be due to up-regulated\nMT expression.\nFIGURE 3 Enhanced expression of MT in tissues in response to diabetes. MT was immunostained in the\nheart, kidney, and liver of diabetic mice 2 months after STZ treatment.\nFIGURE 4 MT induced by diabetes prevents endotoxin-induced hepatic injury. Serum ALT and hepatic\nlipid peroxidation (TBARS) were measured in LPS-treated nondiabetic and diabetic mice 2 months after\nLPS-treated mice (diabetes + LPS \u00ad control = expected effect).\nMetallothionein and Diabetes 97\nMechanisms by Which MT Prevents Diabetes, Diabetic Complications,\nand Subsequent Other Pathogenic Injury\nMT as Antioxidant\nOxidative stress is the critical initiator for diabetic onset and complica-\ntions, and antioxidants can prevent both diabetic onset and complications\n(Rosen et al., 2001). T-cell\u00admediated inflammatory autoimmune reaction and\nSTZ- or alloxan-induced diabetes are all considered to be due to ROS and\nRNS formation leading to -cell destruction. In addition, very low concentra-\ntions of antioxidants found in animal pancreatic islets and hearts make these\norgans vulnerable to STZ or alloxan-induced diabetes through the genera-\nPancreas contains relatively high levels of MT compared to other tissues\nand Matsubara, 2000). The high expression of MT in pancreas may suggest\nthat it is required for normal physiological function. Indeed, mice with the\nMT-I and -II gene null show obesity and hyperlipidemia (Beattie et al., 1998).\nFurthermore, although isolated islets from MT-null and WT mice had similar\nislets for MT-null mice), the islets from the MT-null mice showed much lower\nlevels of basal and maximal insulin releisletsase (Laychock et al., 2000). These\nresults suggest the requirement of MT for physiological function of pancre-\natic -cells in which MT may act as an antioxidant in scavenging ROS and RNS\nto preserve cell membrane integrity, protein sulfhydryls or nucleic acids, and\nsecretary responsiveness. Overexpression of MT induced by Zn in pancreatic\n-cells has been shown to provide significant protection against STZ-induced\ndiabetes in rats and mice (Table 1), suggesting that MT plays an important\nrole in the prevention of oxidative injury which otherwise initiates diabetes.\nThe possibility that the prevention of the diabetes was due to other effects\nof the inducer (such as Zn) was eliminated by use of genetically manip-\nulated pancreatic-specific MT-overexpressing transgenic mice (Chen et al.,\n2001). In these mice, both spontaneously developed and STZ-induced dia-\nbetes were prevented. In cultured islets from control mice and MT-TG mice,\nMT decreases STZ-induced islet disruption, DNA breakage, and depletion\nof NAD+. These results demonstrate that MT can reduce diabetes through\ninhibition of STZ-induced oxidative DNA damage (Chen et al., 2001). Using\ncardiac MT-TG mice, significant prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy was\nalso found along with significant suppression of diabetes-induced ROS and\nRNS accumulation and oxidative damage (Table 2).\nActivation of NF-B (a ROS-sensitive transcription factor) plays a criti-\ncal role in initiating -cell death leading to diabetic development (Darville\ndietary Zn supplementation with overexpressing pancreatic MT was found to\nsignificantly attenuate hyperglycemia in prodiabetes db/db mice and chem-\nically induced diabetes by alloxan or STZ, accompanied by significant inhi-\nIn further support of the antioxidant action of MT, there is evidence\nindicating that up-regulation of SOD made mice resistant to diabetes de-\nvelopment (Kubisch et al., 1997). Thioredoxin (TRX), a redox (reduction/\noxidation)-active protein, has recently been shown to protect cells from ox-\nidative stress. Transgenic mice with specific expression of TRX in pancreatic\nislets showed a significantly lower incidence of spontaneously developed and\nSTZ-induced diabetes as compared to their WT counterparts (Hotta et al.,\n1998). In addition, low-dose radiation has been known to up-regulate an-\ntioxidant capacity leading to a wide range of adaptive response (Cai, 1999).\nIt has also been reported that low-dose radiation prevents spontaneous or\nchemically induced development of diabetes through enhanced pancreatic\nMT as Regulator of Zn Homeostasis\nMT is a regulator of Zn homeostasis. When the target tissues are ex-\nposed to oxidative stress, Zn-binding MT releases Zn that in turn plays an\nimportant role in the prevention of oxidative damage (Maret, 2000). High\nZn content was found in islets. For example, Zn content of Sprague Dawley\nrat pancreatic islets was found to be 27.9 \u00b1 2.0 ng/mg islet cells (Kim et al.,\n2000). This may suggest the requirement of Zn for insulin function (Kim\nroles of Zn in insulin function have been recently indicated (Salgueiro et al.,\n2001): (a) Zn is required for insulin-forming hexameric crystals which are\nstored in -cells and released into the portal venous system at the time of\n-cell degranulation. Furthermore, pancreatic Zn level in db/db mice was\nsignificantly lower than in lean mice, and Zn supplementation restored both\npancreatic Zn concentration and serum glucose of db/db mice (Simon and\nTaylor, 2001). (b) The Zn-to-insulin ratio within these crystals determines the\nternary structure, antigenic properties of insulin, and the binding capacity to\nits receptor. (c) Zn pretreatment not only accelerates and increases the mag-\nnitude of insulin binding to the receptor, but also simultaneously inhibits the\ndegradation of insulin by the liver plasma membranes. (d) Zn is closely in-\nvolved in insulin-dependent metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids,\nand chelation of Zn is able to induce diabetes (Epand et al., 1985). (e) Zn is an\nimportant factor in preventing cell death. Zn can inhibit caspase-3 activation\nto prevent cell death that is initiated via Fas/FasL pathway or mitochondrial\ncytochrome c pathway (Yamada et al., 1999). -cell death under exposure to\ndifferent insults plays a critical role in the development of diabetes (Chandra\net al., 2001). Therefore, Zn plays important and wide-ranging functions in\nregulation of insulin function and prevention of spontaneous and chemical-\ninduced diabetes.\nMetallothionein and Diabetes 99\nHowever, whether these functions of Zn are MT-dependent is unclear\nbecause MT is both normally found in high concentration in pancreas and\nalso highly inducible by Zn. MT-null mice were used to investigate the effect\nof Zn supplement against STZ-induced diabetes in order to dissect the pro-\ntective role against STZ-induced diabetes either by MT or Zn (Apostolova\net al., 1997), but the results are still inconclusive. In that experiment, Zn\npretreatment was given at two dose levels: 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body\nweight as ZnSO4. The high dose of Zn fully suppressed development of\nhyperglycemia in both MT-null and WT mice after STZ treatment. How-\never, the low-dose Zn pretreatment had a definite inhibitory effect on STZ-\ninduced diabetes development in MT-null mice, but no marked effect in\nWT control. This study seems to suggest that Zn itself can play an impor-\ntant role in the prevention of diabetic pathogenesis under certain conditions\n(Apostolova et al., 1997). However, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in\nMT-null mice is less than in WT mice, suggesting the requirement of pancre-\natic MT for the insulin secretion under normal condition (Laychock et al.,\nThe different effects between low-dose and high-dose levels of Zn may be\ndue to MT induction in nonpancreatic tissues. In C57BL/6J mice, low-dose\nZn supplement induced hepatic and renal MT, which binds more Zn lead-\ning to less free Zn available to pancreas -cells, whereas in MT-null mice the\nlack of MT induction, or subsequent Zn binding, in nonpancreatic tissues\ncauses sufficient free Zn to be available for pancreatic -cells. It has been\ndocumented that MT induction by low-dose Zn supplementation is lower\nin the pancreas than in the liver, whereas high concentration of Zn sup-\nplementation could induce a higher proportion of pancreatic MT synthesis\ncompared to liver (Zimny et al., 1993). This study suggests that liver is the\ntarget organ for initial storage of Zn although pancreas is highly responsible\nfor Zn-induced MT synthesis. This explanation may also explain the failure\nof MT to demonstrate protection in the alloxan-induced diabetes study by\nThe aforementioned studies strongly demonstrate that MT prevents di-\nabetes through its antioxidant action, Zn regulation, or both.

These results support the antioxidant action of\nMT in the prevention of diabetes. In addition, although Zn is required for\ninsulin physiological function and provides preventive effects from sponta-\nneous and chemical-induced diabetes, high levels of free Zn also cause pan-\ncreatic -cell damage resulting in diabetes (Kim et al., 2000). The fact that the\nfree-Zn-induced pancreatic -cell damage can be prevented by Zn chelator\n(Kim et al., 2000) suggests that MT plays an important role in maintaining\nFIGURE 5 Outline of mechanisms by which MT coordinately with Zn prevents diabetes development\nand diabetic complications.\nZn homeostasis by binding free Zn and releasing Zn when it is required.\nTherefore, MT plays the critical role in coordination with Zn for preventing\ndiabetes development, as outlined in Figure 5.\nRegarding the relationship between MT and Zn in nonpancreatic tissues\nand their function in preventing diabetic complications, to date no inves-\ntigation has been documented. With the exception of Zn's role in insulin\nregulation and secretion, it would be expected that the relationship interac-\ntion between Zn and MT would be the same as in the pancreas (Figure 5).\nIn summary, MT as a potent antioxidant, adaptive protein, and Zn home-\nostasis regulator plays important roles in the prevention of diabetes develop-\nment, complications, and subsequent suffered pathogenic toxicity. Develop-\nment of strategies for up-regulation of MT would be of interest for pharma-\nceutical and medical applications.\nREFERENCES\nAndrews GK, Kage K, Palmiter-Thomas P, Sarras MPJ.
