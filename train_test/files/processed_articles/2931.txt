One kind of risk\nthat banks can well control is the interest rate risk, which arises from different fixed\ninterest periods on the asset and liability side of a bank's balance sheet. In the present\npaper, we theoretically and empirically investigate whether banks in a stressed earnings\nsituation behave differently to the other banks concerning their exposure to interest rate\nrisk. This issue is relevant in the context of the low interest rate environment which can\nlead to a massive reduction in banks' earnings.\nContribution\nNormally, the demand for a risky asset increases if its expected return goes up. In our\ntheoretical model, we show that the opposite outcome is possible as well, meaning that\nthe risky asset becomes the more coveted the lower its expected return.

This risk stems from traditional banking business activity,\nin which banks hand out long-term loans and collect short-term deposits. By making\nuse of hedging instruments, banks can decide how much of this risk they want to retain.\nMany banks do not hedge their interest rate risk completely in practice. In Germany, for\nexample, interest rate risk is one of the most material risks taken by small and medium-\nsized banks. The interest rate risk is important from an aggregate perspective too, since,\ndue to its high correlation in the cross section of banks, it may have a significant impact\non financial stability.1\nIn finance, one typically observes a positive relationship between the demand for a\nrisky asset and its expected return. Hence, banks' interest rate risk is generally expected\nto decrease if the expected return from bearing the risk falls. Recently, however, a number\nof German banks seem to have taken more interest rate risk despite falling expected return.\nIn this paper, we first show the theoretical possibility that a falling expected return may\ninduce the taking of a higher interest rate risk. We then estimate empirically the critical\nlevel of bank profitability below which a negative relationship prevails between the taking\nof interest rate risk and its expected return. Put differently, in the current paper we\npresent a theoretical rationale and some empirical evidence for a search for yield in the\nform of higher risk-taking due to lower profitability.\nIn economics, it is well known that there exist situations where increasing prices lead\nto an increase in the demand for the respective good. Counter-intuitive though this may\nseem, this is not merely a theoretical possibility. There is empirical evidence for the exis-\ntence of such a phenomenon, for instance in labor economics: An increase in hourly wages\n(which corresponds to an increase in the opportunity cost and thus the price of leisure)\nmay lead to a decrease in the labor supply and, hence, to an increase in the demand for\nleisure (e.g. Camerer, Babcock, Loewenstein, and Thaler (1997)). More recently, Doman-\nski, Shin, and Sushko (2015) find that the demand curve of German insurance companies\nfor long-term bonds is upward-sloping. In our paper, we also deal with situations where\nan increase in the price of a good (here: a decline in the expected return of the risky\nasset) may lead to an increase in the demand for this good. Although the ensuing em-\npirical effects are similar to the foregoing labor market example, a different mechanism\nis at work in our case: In the labor market example, the income effect dominates the\nsubstitution effect. By contrast, in our paper, the effect of a change in expected profits\non risk-taking is due to the preference structure: Whereas risk is seen as negative and\nthe decision-makers act in a risk-averse manner in normal times, in times with very low\nprofits, risk becomes something which is desirable and the decision-makers seek risk.\nAs mentioned above, interest rate risk can easily be hedged and its amount is hence, to\na large extent, within the discretion of bank managers. Therefore, the observable level of\ninterest rate risk is a rather accurate reflection of bank managers' underlying incentives.\nIn this paper, we work with a measure for a bank's exposure to interest rate risk which\nis closely linked to the bank's Basel interest rate coefficient, which is the supervisors'\nyardstick for the interest rate risk in the banking book. Covering both on- and off-\nbalance sheet items, this coefficient is a rather comprehensive standardized measure of\n1An extensive discussion of interest rate risk in the German banking sector can be found in Deutsche\ninterest rate risk concerning banks' traditional business.\nThe low interest rate environment is a crucial motivation for our investigation. It is\nconsistently understood as driving down banks' profit margin and, if it persists, as further\nreducing banks' income in the future.2 Accordingly, due to low profits, an increasing share\nof bank managers can be expected to act as if they were risk-prone. In other words, the\nshare of banks which increase their interest rate risk exposure even though the term\nstructure flattens can be expected to rise if the low interest rate environment persists.\nSince the interest rate risk applies to a large number of banks simultaneously, financial\nstability risks can ensue, among others, also through this channel in the low interest rate\nenvironment. This is a major topical takeaway from our investigation.\nWe look at German banks' interest rate risk for the period 2005-2014 and find the\nusual direct positive relationship between expected returns from term transformation and\nexposure to the corresponding interest rate risk. In addition, we show that this relation-\nship becomes weaker if a bank's operative income goes down. Eventually, if the operative\nincome falls below a certain threshold, the relationship changes its sign, meaning that the\nbank starts to increase its exposure to interest rate risk even though the expected returns\nfrom term transformation decrease. We find that, depending on the sample specification\nand estimation methodology, about 0.6 to 8.3 per cent of the observations are below this\nthreshold. This indicates that the prevalence of the search for yield in the sense described\nabove has been limited until now. However, this may change if the current low interest\nrate environment persists.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we provide a review of the litera-\nture concerning banks' risk taking and search for yield, especially in a low interest rate\nenvironment. In Section 3, we present an illustrative theoretical model and its empiri-\ncal implications. Section 4 describes the data and in Section 5 we discuss the empirical\nresults. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Literature\nOur paper is the first to establish a general link between lower expected return from\ninterest rate risk and increased taking of this risk by banks. We show that there is\na threshold level of profitability below which banks search for yield, i.e. below that\nprofitability level banks increase their exposure to interest rate risk although the term\nstructure becomes flatter and thus earning opportunities become smaller.\nResearch on how interest rates affect banks' risk-taking has gained momentum, not\nleast due to the low interest environment, in recent years. Most recent contributions\ndealing with the subject are framed as investigations of the risk-taking channel of mon-\netary policy as advanced by, e.g., Borio and Zhu (2012). Theoretical research on how a\nlow interest rate environment affects banks' risk-taking addresses reactions to both lower\nshort-term rates and lower long-term rates as well as a combination of both. Depending\non the differing reactions of short-term and long-term rates to the low-interest rate en-\nvironment, the yield curve may become steeper or flatter, the former (latter) generally\n2The European Central Bank (2015) expects that, in the current low interest rate environment, the net\ninterest margins of banks are going to remain under pressure. See also Borio, Gambacorty, and Hofmann\n(2015) and Busch and Memmel (2015) for empirical evidence on decreased bank profitability as a result\nof low interest rates and a flat yield curve.\nleading to a higher (lower) profitability of the lending business due to term transforma-\ntion. Thus, various possible incentives for risk-taking are conceivable in a low interest\nenvironment. Diamond and Rajan (2009) and Acharya and Naqvi (2012), for example,\nmodel how lower short-term rates, or open market operations bringing them about, lead\nto higher liquidity in the form of deposits and thus to a lower probability of punishment\nin the form of a bank run or a penalty for the manager. Adrian and Shin (2010) ex-\nplain how an increase in asset valuesfollowing from lower long-term rates leads to a larger\nrisk-bearing capacity of financial institutions, provided that the balance sheet is marked\nto market and there is a binding value-at-risk constraint. Adrian and Shin (2011) point\nout that increased profitability of classic lending business resulting from a steeper yield\ncurve leads to a larger risk-bearing capacity. Fishburn and Porter (1976), who provide\nthe classic discussion of the general link between risk and expected return, point to a\nwhat can be called \"risk-return slack\", i.e. a lower level of risk associated with every given\nlevel of expected return. Banks may be inclined to increase their risk due to a risk-return\nslack. In contrast, Rajan (2005) points out how a decreased profitability of classic lending\nbusiness, as it results from a flatter yield curve, induces what he calls a search for yield,\nwhereby higher risks are taken in order to counteract decreasing profits.3\nNote that, reversing the arguments presented in the foregoing paragraph, a low interest\nenvironment with a steeper or flatter yield curve can also induce lower risk-taking. How\na low interest environment effects risk-taking hence depends on which of its opposite\neffects on risk-taking is dominant. Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and Marquez (2014) develop,\nfor example, a model in which a steepening yield curve generates two opposing effects.\nWhile, on the one hand, it leads to higher risk-taking due to a risk-return slack, it lowers,\non the other hand, incentives for risk-taking due to an inverted search for yield through\nrisk-shifting. In their model, the relative strength of these two channels on risk-taking\ndepends on the leverage of the bank.\nIt should also be noted that there are possible second-order effects of a low interest\nenvironment on risk taking as well. Adrian and Shin (2011) model, for example, how low\nshort-term rates first lead to increased lending, which in turn leads to higher asset valua-\ntions and thus to a larger risk-bearing capacity. Bernanke and Gertler (1989, 1990) show\nhow changes in interest rates reduces the riskiness of borrowers and, if existing borrowers\nbecome less risky, a bank might be induced to accept riskier new borrowers. Finally, there\nare possible effects of low interest rates on the risk-taking of an individual bank which\nresult from the interaction with other banks and the central bank. Most notably, Farhi\nand Tirole (2012) identify incentives for banks to correlate their risk exposures in order\nto be bailed-out in the event of failure. Such second-order effects are not investigated in\nour paper.\nSome of the above mentioned mechanisms may affect incentives for both credit risk\nand interest rate risk exposure. The model of Dell'Ariccia et al. (2014), for example,\ncenters on the decision about the monitoring level of a loan portfolio, which is assumed\nto be inversely related to the corresponding credit risk, and a steeper yield curve which\n3Borio et al. (2015) report evidence for particularly decreased bank profitability as a result of par-\nticularly low interest rates and a particularly flat yield curve. Furthermore, a decreased profitability of\nclassic lending business may also be due to a smaller margin contribution from deposits as a result of\nlower short-term rates as the findings of Ruprecht, Kick, Entrop, and Wilkens (2013) and Busch and\ninduces an increased maturity mismatch and hence interest rate risk. Data from lending\nsurveys and credit registers are analyzed by De Nicolo, Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and Valencia\nby Maddaloni and Peydr\u00f3 (2011) for the US and the euro area, by Jimenez, Ongena,\nand Peydr\u00f3 (2014) for Spain and by Ioannidou, Ongena, and Peydr\u00f3 (2015) for Bolivia.\nThe common outcome of these studies is that lower short-term rates, which are generally\nassociated with a steeper yield curve, lead to increased credit risk-taking by banks.\nSearch for yield is a crucial aspect of our study. In the existing body of literature, two\npotential explanations for search for yield have been proposed. The first explanation refers\nto some sort of risk-shifting as introduced by Jensen and Meckling (1976), elaborated on\nnotably by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) and Kane (1989) and observed in a recent case\nstudy by Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011). Explanations of this type maintain the\nassumption of perfect rationality and rely on an institutional setup or some appropriate\ncontractual arrangement such as limited liability or bonus incentive schemes. The second\nexplanation relies instead on an assumption of bounded rationality. Explanations of\nthis type feature a behavioural assumption that might be very simple, for example the\ninability of market participants to account for all available information as suggested by\nRajan (2005), or they are more sophisticated, say, along the lines of the prospect theory\ndeveloped by Kahneman and Tversky (1979).\nIt should be noted that parts of the existing literature seem to imply a diverse un-\nderstanding of what constitutes a search for yield. In particular, some studies diagnose a\nsearch for yield when lower short-term rates lead to increased risk-taking. For example,\nwhen lower short-term rates are accompanied by a steeper yield curve, what might be\ncalled search for yield may occur in the form of increased taking of interest rate risk due\nto increased earning opportunities from term transformation. In contrast, we in this pa-\nper understand search for yield as a link between lower earning opportunities from taking\na certain risk and increased taking of that risk. Construed in this way, a shift of risk\npreferences turns out to be one explanation for search for yield. Our concept as such is\na narrow notion of search for yield which is in line with the reasoning of Rajan (2005)\nwho defines search for yield as a reaction to lower earning opportunities that consists in\nan increase in risk-taking as a means to bolster profitability.\nThere already exists empirical research on the link between interest rates and the\ntaking of interest rate risk. Hanson and Stein (2015) find that a steepening of the yield\ncurve due to a decrease in short-term interest rates induces US banks to increase their\nholdings of long-term bonds and thereby to increase their interest rate risk.4 Memmel\nest rate risk and annual account reporting from Germany with the overall result that a\nflatter yield curve, implying a lower expected return from interest rate risk, leads to a\ndecreased taking of this risk by banks. Our paper refines the findings of these studies by\nestablishing a general potential link between lower expected return from interest rate risk\nand increased taking of this risk. Namely, we start out by showing the existence of the\n4Hanson and Stein (2015) actually go even further and show that this increased demand for long-\nterm bonds leads to an increase in price and by this to a reduction of long-term interest rates also,\nthough to a smaller extend than the initial decrease in short-term interest rates. Chodorow-Reich (2014)\nreports evidence for increased risk taking of money market funds seeking to cover administrative costs in\na low-interest rate environment.\ntheoretical possibility that below a threshold level of profitability banks search for yield\nby increasing their interest rate risk despite, say, a flatter yield curve. Subsequently, we\nestimate empirically the level of the threshold and the share of banks falling short of it.\n3 Modeling\n3.1 Theoretical Model\nIn our illustrative theoretical model, we include the search for yield in a bank's taking of\ninterest rate risk by assuming a utility function which is convex below a target rate of\nreturn and concave above this rate. Fishburn and Kochenberger (1979) find that a utility\nfunction of this form best captures the risk attitude of managers. Laughhunn, Payne, and\nCrum (1980) present additional evidence for risk-seeking behavior of managers in case of\nbelow target returns.\nNote that, by assuming a utility function which is symmetric to the reference point, we\ndo not accommodate the assumption of loss aversion common in behavioral economics.\nThis assumption, advanced by Benartzi and Thaler (1995) in the field of behavioural\nfinance, postulates that more disutility results from a loss of a given size than utility from\na gain of the same size. In contrast, we focus on an expected utility framework with a\nsymmetric combination of risk seeking below the target rate of return and risk aversion\nabove it. Such a utility function captures the essence of the search for yield behavior\nwe are investigating in the most stripped-down way and without loss of generality of our\nconclusions. However, it is straightforward to extend our theoretical model to feature loss\naversion.\nWith the empirical specification derived from the following theoretical model, it is\npossible for the first time to identify the critical value of the expected return below which\nsearch for yield dominates the link between expected return from interest rate risk and\ntaking of this risk by banks. Our empirical findings are the first to document this richer\npicture of banks' interest rate risk-taking.\nIn the following stylized model, we assume that the bank management's utility function\nis\nu() = arctan() (1)\nwhere the first derivative is\nu () =\ni.e. the marginal utility is always positive. For  > 0, the function is concave, meaning\nrisk aversion, for  < 0, it is convex which means risk seeking.5\nThe income  of a bank is assumed to be composed of an on-balance sheet part a\nand a part due to derivatives (interest rate swaps) d where the bank can determine its\nexposure w:\n = a + w \u00b7 d (2)\nwith\n5Note that the second derivative of the function reads u () = -2/(1 + 2)2. Pratt (1964) mentions\nthis utility function, albeit only the positive part where it is concave.\nd =\nwhere p stands for the probability that the first outcome in (3) materializes. We assume\n > \u00b5 > 0 so that there are no arbitrage opportunities. Note that, for banks without\nderivative usage, d and w can be interpreted as describing what may be called the pure\ninterest rate risk of on-balance sheet business. Combining (1), (2) and (3), we can express\nthe expected utility of the bank management as\nE(u) = 0.5 \u00b7 arctan (a + w \u00b7 (\u00b5 + )) + 0.5 \u00b7 arctan (a + w \u00b7 (\u00b5 - )) . (4)\nDifferentiating (4) with respect to w, one obtains\ndE(u)\ndw\n(\u00b5 + )\n1 + (a + w \u00b7 (\u00b5 + ))2\n(\u00b5 - )\n1 + (a + w \u00b7 (\u00b5 - ))2\nSetting (5) to zero and solving for w,6 one obtains the optimal exposure wopt\nas\nwopt = -\na\n\u00b5\n+\n+\nThe expected income E() when using the optimal weights is always positive (combining\n(2) and (6)), irrespective of the on-balance sheet income part a, which can be seen from\nEquation (7):\nE (opt) = a + wopt\n\u00b7 \u00b5\nThe rationale behind this result is as follows. Suppose the expected income were negative.\nIn this case, the probability mass would be mainly in the convex part of the utility\nfunction. Accordingly, the decision-maker would be mainly risk-seeking, not risk-averse,\nmeaning that he/she derives a higher expected utility from higher risk. Therefore, a\nportfolio with negative expected return could not be the optimal one because the decision-\nmaker could in this case always achieve a higher expected utility by increasing the off-\nbalance sheet exposure w (which leads to higher risk and higher expected return). For a\nsufficiently large derivative exposure w, however, the expected return of the entire bank \nwould turn positive (even if the on-balance sheet expected return a is negative) because,\nby assumption, the expected return of the derivative is positive. In this case, the usual\ntrade-off between risk and expected return would apply.\nIn order to compute the change in the optimal risk exposure in response to changes in\nthe expected return of the risky asset, we calculate the derivative of the optimal amount\n6See the appendix.\nof the investment in the risky asset with respect to its expected return and obtain\nwopt\n\u00b5\n=\na\n\u00b7\n\n\n +\n\u00b7\nThe first summand in (8) has the same sign as a, because the term in the brackets is\nalways positive. The second summand is likewise always positive. With this in mind, we\nrewrite (8) as\nwopt\n\u00b5\nwhere x1(\u00b7) and x2(\u00b7) are functions with strictly positive values.\n3.2 Empirical specification\n(9) can lead to the following empirical implementation\nor \u00ad more concretely with indices for time t and bank i \u00ad\nwopt,t,i =  + 1\u00b5t + 2\n\u00b7 (at,i\u00b5t) +  zt,i + t,i\nwhere zt,i\nis a vector including bank-specific and time-variant control variables, \u00b5t\nis the\nchange in steepness of the yield curve (or the change in the earning opportunities from\nterm transformation), at,i\nis the deviation of bank i's operative income from its historic\nmean and wopt,t,i\nis the interest rate risk. Of special interest is the term\n\u00b7 at,i\nwhich gives the effect of changes in the earnings opportunities from term transformation\n(which can be positive or negative). The expression -^\nis an estimate for the critical\nvalue a where the sign of the effect changes, i.e. for at,i > -^\n, an increase in the\nearning opportunities from term transformation leads to an increase in the interest rate\nrisk exposure (see Figure 1).\nWith the help of the delta method, it is possible to derive the asymptotic distribution\nof the estimation for the critical value ^\na = -^\n:\n\nT \u00b7 N (^\nwith\nV = T \u00b7 N \u00b7\n\n\nvar ^\ncov ^\n+\nvar ^\n\nwhere Tand N are the numbers of observations in the time and the cross-sectional dimen-\nsions, respectively.\nFigure 1: Critical Income\nfa,\nwopt\n\u00b5\na\nfa\nwopt\n\u00b5\n\u00b7 a\nRisk-seeking bank observations\na\nAs the dependent variable, named w and corresponding to wopt\nin the previous section,\nwe use the year-to-year change in a bank's exposure to interest rate risk in our regressions.\nThis exposure has to be reported to the supervisor by each bank in Germany, and banks\ncompute it using their internal risk models. For regulatory purposes, this exposure is\ndefined as the change in the present value of a bank's banking book due to an overnight\nshift of the term structure. The banks perform the calculation twice, once for a parallel\nupward shift of 200 basis points and once for a downward shift of the same magnitude,\nassuming the (more) adverse of the two outcomes for regulatory purposes. For reasons of\nstandardization, the present value change is normalized with the banks' regulatory capital\n(this measure is then called the Basel interest rate coefficient). In this study, we carry\nout the standardization by using the banks' total assets. This standardization is more\nconvenient for our purposes because the Basel interest rate coefficient includes both the\nrisk exposure and the risk-bearing capacity, whereas with our standardization, only the\nrisk exposure is expressed.7 Another deviation from the regulatory figure is that, in our\nanalysis, we consider only the upward shift in the term structure. We do so because the\nconventional business model of banking consists in positive term transformation, which\nmeans that maturities are longer on the asset side than they are on the liability side.\nIn fact, for 95% of the banks, the upward scenario is the (more) adverse one in our\ndata set. Our empirical analysis covers the period from 2005 to 2014. For the years\nfrom 2005 to 2010, reports of banks' exposure to interest rate risk are available only\nat unsystematic reporting dates, which we treat as follows: Exposures to interest rate\nrisk with reporting dates from January to June are counted as the year-end value of\nthe previous year. Accordingly, values with reporting dates from July to December are\ncounted as year-end values of the current year. From 2011 on, we use the fourth quarter\nvalue as the year-end value. Focusing on the direction of the change in banks' exposure to\ninterest rate risk and in order to avoid noise due to extreme values (in spite of the outlier\ncorrection mentioned below) in the data, we introduce an alternative dependent variable,\n7For the interpretation of the numerical values reported below it is helpful to note that in our sample,\nthe average Basel interest rate coefficient is about 11 times as large as the average interest rate coefficient\nstandardized with total assets.\nwhich is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a bank's exposure to interest\nrate risk standardized with the bank's total assets has increased in a given year and zero\nif it has declined or stayed the same. This variable is named I{w>0}.\nThe main explanatory variables in our regressions are dmu (corresponding to \u00b5t\nin\nEquation (11)), the year-to-year change in the earning opportunities from interest rate\nrisk, and ert, the deviation of a bank's standardized operating income from its mean\noperating income over time. More precisely, dmu measures possible earnings from term\ntransformation following an investment strategy that consists in revolvingly investing\nin 10-year par-yield bonds and of revolvingly issuing par-yield bonds with one year of\nmaturity.8 ert is defined as the deviation from the mean over time in order to account\nfor differences in bank-specific business models.9 Furthermore, for the sake of consistency\nwith the theoretical results of the previous subsection, ert is multiplied by the variable\ndmu, yielding the variable ertdmu, which corresponds to the term at,i\u00b5t\nin Equation\nIn our regressions, we use several control variables. To measure a bank's credit risk, we\nlook at the write-downs in its credit portfolio and the average riskiness of its assets. The\nformer variable, labeled writedowns, is defined as the ratio of a bank's gross write-downs\n(in a given year) relative to its customer loans. The latter variable, labeled rwa_ta, is\nthe quotient of a bank's risk-weighted assets and total assets. The bank's risk bearing\ncapacity is measured by its regulatory capital ratio, its Tier 1 ratio captured by the\nvariable Tier1. According to theory, an increase in this capital ratio should lead to\nhigher risk-taking because of the then larger loss-absorbing capacity. To account for time\ntrends and regulatory changes, the yearly cross-sectional median of the respective variable\nis subtracted from the variables writedowns, rwa_ta, and Tier1. Regulatory pressure\nis captured by the variable reg, which is a dummy variable equaling one if the Basel\ninterest rate coefficient (the measure for a bank's interest rate risk used by supervisory\nauthorities) exceeds 20 per cent, which used to be the regulatory criterion for banks with\nelevated interest rate risk exposure.\nTable 1 gives the summary statistics of the dependent variable w, i.e. the change\nin banks' exposure to interest rate risk standardized with its total assets, the main ex-\nplanatory variables, dmu and ertdmu, as well as the control variables Tier1, rwa_ta and\nwritedowns. Summary statistics of the variable ert are provided only to enable a better\nunderstanding of the variable ertdmu. For reasons of confidentiality, we do not report\nsummary statistics concerning the dummy variable reg.\nWe apply an outlier correction to all variables where we cut off the values beyond the\nfirst and the 99th percentile as default. The only exception is the continuous variable\ndmu for which we abstain from any outlier correction because of limited variation and the\ndummy variable reg. Applying an alternative more extensive outlier correction, we treat\nthe variable ertdmu differently than in the default specification and exclude its values\nbelow the fifth percentile and above the 95th percentile from the sample. Our reason for\nreporting results from both of these alternative treatments in our baseline estimations is\n8See Memmel (2008) for details on and Memmel (2011) for an application of this investment strategy.\n9The main reason to focus on operating income as a measure of profitability is that it is difficult to\nmanipulate for banks.\n10As one of our robustness checks we additionally include ert by itself as an independent variable.\nHowever, the results hardly change and the regression coefficient on ert turns out to be insignificant.\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\nVariable Nobs Mean Stand. dev. 5th percentile Median 95th percentile\nSummary statistics for the two dependent variables, the year-to-year change in a bank's exposure to\ninterest rate risk w (present value losses due to a 200 bp parallel shift of the term structure, in per\ncent of total assets) and the dummy variable I{w>0}\nwhich takes the value one in case w > 0, and\nthe main explanatory variables, dmu, ertdmu, Tier1, rwa\n\u00af\nta, writedowns. For completeness, we give\nthe corresponding statistics of the variable ert as well. The summary statistics in the table refer to the\nsample after applying the default outlier correction as described in the main text.\nthat the variable ertdmu has particularly extreme values in the tails. For instance, the\nratio of the 99th percentile to the 90th percentile is 5.3 for ertdmu, whereas it is 2.2 for\nthe dependent variable w and 1.8 for normally distributed variables.11\nDuring the ten years under consideration (2005-2014), many mergers took place among\nthe banks in the sample. In our subsection about robustness checks, we try out the\nfollowing alternative treatment: Two merging banks cease to exist after the year of the\nmerger and a new bank is created in the year after the merger. For our baseline results,\nhowever, we proceed as follows: The dominant institution among the two merging banks\ncontinues to exist, whereas the subordinate bank ceases operation.\n5 Empirical Results\nWe estimate four baseline specifications of Equation (11), namely with the continuous\n(I) or the binary (II) dependent variable and each with the default (a) or the more\nextensive (b) outlier correction. The results (see Table 2) show that banks \u00ad as expected\n\u00ad increase their interest rate risk exposure when the return from this risk goes up; i.e. in\nall four specifications the regression coefficient on the variable dmu is positive and highly\nsignificant. Focusing on this regression coefficient, the estimates with the continuous\ndependent variable (specifications Ia and Ib) show that banks increase their exposure\nto interest rate risk (standardized with total assets) by around 0.09 percentage points\non average if the earning opportunities from interest rate risk increase by one standard\ndeviation, meaning that the Basel interest rate coefficient increases by about 0.7 points\n11These numbers for ertdmu and w refer to the sample without any outlier correction applied. The\ndefault outlier correction produces similar numbers, namely 5.0 and 1.8, respectively. This suggests that\nthe default outlier correction does not take sufficient care of the fat tail of the distribution of ertdmu.\n(see Footnote 7). Regressing on the binary dependent variable instead (specifications\nIIa and IIb), the probability of the average bank increasing its exposure to interest rate\nrisk in the face of a rise in earning opportunities is estimated to increase by around 5\npercentage points.12 This finding is in line with those of Memmel (2011) and Memmel\nand Schertler (2013). Note that the positive sign of the regression coefficient on the\nvariable dmu suggests that banks actively manage their interest rate risk. The reasoning\nfor this interpretation is as follows. Everything else equal, a flatter yield curve tends to\nshift loan demand toward longer maturities or interest rate fixation periods. Hence, if\nbanks were passive regarding the level of the interest rate risk, a negative relationship\nbetween expected return and interest rate risk would prevail. Accordingly, the positive\nrelationship which we obtain in our regressions is evidence for banks' active management\nof their interest rate risk.\nThe regression coefficient on the variable ertdmu is significantly positive in all speci-\nfications, though on different levels. This means that the interest rate risk exposure of a\nbank with a lower deviation of its operative income from its historic mean shows a weaker\nresponse to changes in earning opportunities from interest rate risk (dmu) than a bank\nwith a higher deviation. If the deviation of a bank's operative income from its historic\nmean is very low, i.e. sufficiently negative, the relationship between exposure and earning\nopportunities can even change its sign from positive \u00ad as it is usually the case \u00ad to nega-\ntive. Table 3 gives the level of this critical deviation of operative income a below which\nsuch a reversal of the relationship is to be expected (see Equation (12)). It is striking\nthat the empirical significance and the economic relevance vary with the outlier correc-\ntion applied. With the default outlier correction, the regression coefficient on ertdmu is\nsignificant at the 5% level in the specification with the continuous dependent variable and\nthe critical deviation of operative income is below the threshold for around 0.6% of the\nobservations in the sample (specification Ia). Similarly, the specification with the binary\ndependent variable produces a critical deviation below which 0.5% of the observations\ncan be found, though on an inferior level of significance of 10%. With the more extensive\noutlier correction, the regression coefficient on ertdmu turns out to be significant at the\n1% level for both the specification with the continuous and the specification with the\nbinary dependent variable, and more than 5% of the observations in the sample display a\ndeviation of operative income that falls below the critical threshold (specifications Ib and\nIIb). This shows that the way in which we treat outliers has a significant impact on the\npercentage of observations (and banks) that are below the critical value. Put differently,\nwith the default outlier correction, an operating income that is close to 1.7 (specification\nIa) or 2.0 (specification IIa) standard deviations below the historic mean takes a bank\nbelow the critical level, and with the more extensive outlier correction, the factor is less\nthan 0.7 (specification Ib) or 0.6 (specification IIb) standard deviation.\nWith the default outlier correction, we find that a deviation of the operating income\nrelative to total assets from its historic mean by -0.80 percentage points (specification Ia)\nor -0.98 percentage points (specification IIa) is the threshold. With the more extensive\noutlier correction, the threshold is estimated to be at -0.34 percentage points (specification\nIb) or at -0.29 percentage points (specification IIb). Since the mean operating income\n12This marginal effect is calculated as the difference between the predicted values of the dependent\nvariable with all explanatory variables set to their mean value and with all explanatory variables set to\ntheir mean value except for dmu which is set to its mean value plus one standard deviation.\nTable 2: Main Results\nDependent variable w (I) I{w>0}(II)\nOutlier treatment default (a) ext.

The only exception is the result produced with the\ndefault outlier correction and the binary dependent variable (specification IIa), which,\nhowever, has the lowest level of significance.\nConcerning the control variables, we find that regulatory pressure, measured by the\ndummy variable reg, has a highly significant impact on the change in the interest rate risk:\nIf a bank is qualified as an outlier, the bank reduces its exposure by 0.3 percentage points\n(specifications Ia and Ib) (on average) over the next year. According to the specifications\nwith the continuous dependent variable, capital adequacy, measured by the variable Tier1,\nhas a significant positive impacti.e. banks with more capital at hand take a higher interest\nrate risk. The riskiness, measured by the variable rwa_ta, is estimated to be significant in\nall four specifications. But the sign of the estimated coefficient varies. With the continuous\ndependent variable, it is positive (specifications Ia and Ib) and, with the binary dependent\nvariable, it is negative (specification IIa and IIb). As both the dependent variable and this\nexplanatory variable are normalized with total assets, the positive sign can be regarded\nas an artefact. If total assets decrease, both variables increase mechanically. Noting\nthat a banks' risk-weighted assets mainly reflect credit risk and not interest rate risk, the\nnegative coefficient for rwa_ta (as produced by specification IIa and IIb) suggests that\nbanks have an internal risk budget that they distribute between credit and interest rate\nTable 3: Critical operative income\nDependent variable w (I) I{w>0}(II)\nOutlier treatment default (a) ext.

Its effect is significant only in the specifications with the\nbinary dependent variable (specification IIa and IIb), the estimated sign being negative.\n5.2 Robustness Checks\nWe run several robustness checks. If not otherwise stated, the results are compared to\nthe ones produced with the baseline specification Ia.\nFirst, we include ert as an additional independent variable in the regression. We do\nbecause the results for the interaction term ertdmu might change, if besides dmu the\nsecond interacted variable ert is seperately included in the regression too. The regression\ncoefficient on ert turns out to be highly insignificant. The regression coefficient on ertdmu\nhardly changes and its level of significance remains if ert is seperately included in the\nregression. This suggests that our baseline results for ertdmu do not only pick up some\nspurious regression and justifies the exclusion of ert from our baseline models.\nSecond, we alternatively use the one-year lagged value of the variable ert for the\ncalculation of the independent variable ertdmu. We do so in order to address a potential\nendogeneity problem arising from simultaneity, i.e. a two-way determination of the change\nin a bank's exposure to interest rate risk and its operating income. We find that the\nregression results hardly differ from the results produced by our baseline model.\nThird, we normalize the present value change in a bank's banking book due to an\novernight upward shift in the term structure by 200 basis points using the bank's regu-\nlatory capital instead of its total assets. As pointed out earlier, this measure is closely\nrelated to the Basel interest rate coefficient. We find that the significance of the variable\nertdmu vanishes under the default outlier correction and becomes a bit weaker given un-\nder the more extensive one. The reduction in the significance of the coefficient does not\ncome as a surprise. As noted above, in our baseline models we apply the normalization\nwith total assets in order to disentangle changes in risk exposure and in risk-bearing ca-\npacity. The variable included to capture the latter, namely Tier1, becomes insignificant,\nif the alternative normalization is applied.\nFourth, we apply a different merger treatment as described in Section 4: No longer\ndoes the dominating bank prevail, but a new bank appears and the two merging banks\n13The canonical reference for this finding is the paper by Schrand and Unal (1998).\ndisappear from the sample after a merger. Due to this different treatment of the merg-\ners, we lose some observations. However, the qualitative results remain, although the\nsignificance of the variable ertdmu becomes slightly weaker.\nFifth, we control for bank size. To this end, we include the logarithm of a bank's total\nassets normalized by the cross-sectional median for each year as an additional control\nvariable. The regression coefficient on this variable turns out to be negative and highly\nsignificant. More importantly, the regression coefficients on the main variables of interest\nhardly change and their levels of significance remain unaltered.\nSixth, we investigate whether banks applying interest rate derivatives behave differ-\nently. We define a dummy variable which takes the value one in each year if a bank reports\na positive figure for the nominal derivative volume. This is the case in 48.7% of the ob-\nservations. We interact this dummy variable with dmu as well as with ertdmu. We find\na positive relationship between expected return and risk for both values of the dummy\nvariable. As noted above, this highly significant relationship suggests that banks' interest\nrate risk is actively managed in both subsamples. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is\ncommon for smaller banks which do not apply interest rate derivatives to actively manage\ntheir interest rate risk by means of bidirectional loans of different maturities with their\nrespective central institutions.14'15 However, it is only for banks not using interest rate\nderivatives that we find the variable ertdmu to be significant. One possible explanation\nfor the variable ertdmu to be significant only for these banks is that banks using interest\nrate derivatives are likely to use other instruments such as credit default swaps to manage\ntheir risk.16 According to this interpretation, interest rate risk is a viable means of con-\ntrolling a bank's risk position, although other and possibly more convenient means to that\nend exist and it might be the case that only banks with an elaborate risk management\n(here proxied by the use of interest rate derivatives) have access to them.17\nSeventh, we break up the sample period 2005-2014 into two subperiods, ranging from\nvariables of main interest, dmu and ertdmu, with an appropreately defined dummy vari-\nable. We find that the regression coefficients on both variables are significant only for\nthe first subperiod and insignificant for the second. The lack of significance in the second\nsubperiod is likely due to relatively little variation of the variable dmu.\nEighth, the empirical specification in Equation (11) is a linearization of the relationship\nderived in Equation (9). This relationship is non-linear, which suggests including the\nt,i\n\u00b5t\nin the empirical specification (11). The corresponding coefficient is positive\nand significant at the 5% level, suggesting a convex relationship. Note that no real\ncritical operating income can be calculated with the resulting coefficients. Moreover, the\n14Ehrmann and Worms (2004) have a related study on bank networks in Germany.\n15Readers who are unfamiliar with the German banking system are referred to the recent overview\nprovided in chapter 2.1 of Koetter (2013). The three pillars of the German banking system are commercial\nbanks, savings banks, and cooperative banks. Savings banks and cooperative banks have dedicated central\ninstitutions. Unlike most savings banks and cooperative banks, their central institutions are active on\nthe capital markets. One of their functions can be described as providing mediated access for savings\nbanks and cooperative banks to these markets.\n16G\u00fcnd\u00fcz, Ongena, T\u00fcmer-Alkan, and Yu (2015) find that banks apply CDS as an effective tool to\ncontrol bank risk.\n17See also Ruprecht et al. (2013), who find that banks with trading book differ from banks without\ntrading book with respect to their behavior towards interest rate risk.\nestimated coefficients other than for the quadratic term are all very similar to the ones\nthat we obtain with the default sample specification.\nNineth, we further restrict the sample to observations with an interest rate risk ex-\nposure that occupies a substantial part of the risk-bearing capacity. The underlying\nhypothesis is that banks for which this is not the case do not take interest rate risk as a\npart of their business model and are, in effect, not subject to the mechanism we inves-\ntigate. However, we find that restricting the sample to banks with a net present value\nchange in the banking book due to an overnight upward shift in the term structure by 200\nbasis points normalized with regulatory capital of 5% or 10% does not lead to materially\ndifferent results. Interestingly, these restrictions reduce the number of observations only\nby about 4% or 10%, respectively. This shows that our sample is dominated by banks\nwith an interest rate risk exposure that occupies a substantial part of the risk-bearing\ncapacity. This, in turn, explains why restricting the sample in the way described does not\nlead to materially different results.\nTenth, for the sake of completeness, we dispense with any outlier correction in our\nsample. Compared to the default outlier correction, the regression coefficients in the\nestimation with the continuous dependent variable hardly change. The significance of the\ncoefficient of the variable ertdmu even improves from the 5% to the 1% level.\n6 Conclusion\nIn our theoretical model, we allow for the possibility that, in some situations, the bank\nmanagement may change its risk preference from risk aversion to risk seeking. This\nbehaviour can lead the bank management to increase the bank's risk exposure even if the\nexpected return from the risk is falling. In our empirical study on the interest rate risk\nexposure of banks in Germany, we observe the usual positive direct relationship between\nexpected return and exposure. Furthermore, we find evidence that in extreme situations,\nsuch as the ones with very low profit levels, the relationship is reversed. The reverse\nrelationship is relevant for about 0.6% to 8.3% of the observations, depending on the\nsample specification and the estimation technique used.\nThis study is a first attempt to empirically document the search for yield by banks in\na narrow sense. We characterize the extreme situations mentioned above as situations in\nwhich a banks' operative income falls below a certain threshold. If the low interest rate\nenvironment becomes entrenched and banks' earning opportunities are squeezed further,\nsuch extreme situations may become more likely.\nAppendix\nSetting (5) to zero, we get\n(\u00b5 - ) \u00b7 (1 + a2) + (\u00b5 - ) \u00b7 2aw(\u00b5 + ) + (\u00b5 - ) \u00b7 w2(\u00b5 + )2\nRearranging gives\na\n\u00b5\n\u00b7 w -\n(16) has two solutions; due to our assumption \u00b5 > 0, the solution in (6) is the maximum\n(which we look for) and the other is the minimum.
