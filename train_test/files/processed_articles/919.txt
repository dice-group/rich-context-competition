    "abstract": "Abstract: To test whether use ofhealth care services is a function offirm size, we analyzed a three-year\nmillion subscribers in western Pennsylvania. In this database both small and large firms had higher\nmedically underwritten costs than mid-size firms had. Furthermore, risk-pooling alternatives that\nincluded small companies had a lower cost per subscriber than the risk pools that included large\ncompanies, especially companies of more than 500 contract holders. Age, sex, health status, and the\ntypes of hospitals used for inpatient care of pooled subscribers, in combination, were found to be the\nimportant determinants of costs. With risk adjustment based on these factors to correct for adverse\nrisk selection, community rating can be a feasible approach to increasing the affordability and\naccessibility of health insurance to the majority of those who lack it.\nProviding affordable health insurance to small businesses is critical to\nreducing the number of uninsured Americans.1 Because premiums are\nmore costly for small firms than for large firms and because of the\ninsurance industry's common practice of risk selection (risk or experience\nrating), health insurance has been less accessible to employees of small firms\nand their dependents. By virtue of their size, small businesses do in fact pose\ngreater financial risks to insurers--that is, their health care costs are less\nstable and thus harder to predict with sufficient accuracy for firm-specific\nexperience rating. Moreover, many believe that coverage for small firms is\nmore costly to administer than that for large firms, and that subscribers from\nsmall firms have higher health risks and use more services than subscribers\nfrom large companies.\nAlthough the profitability of insuring firms by type and size is frequently\nanalyzed, the actual costs of health services used by individual subscribers\n(as opposed to premiums and costs for the firm in aggregate) have not been\nmeasured consistently and compared systematically across firms of different\nWanda Young is president of the International Center for Health Services Research, which she\nfounded, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dorothy Joyce is senior investigator of the Pittsburgh Health\nResearch Institute.

In this study we assess whether firm size is associated with subscriber\ncosts; we then assess whether firm size is important in explaining differences\nin the health risk status of policyholders.\nOur primary hypothesis is that the underwritten cost of the medical\nservices used by contract holders of small firms and their dependents, on\naverage, is not higher than that among their counterparts in large firms.\nThe analysis is intended to test the implicit assumption of many insurance\ncarriers that health risk is a function of firm size--specifically, that subscrib-\ners from small firms are higher health risks, and therefore incur higher\nmedical costs, than subscribers from large companies.3 This untested as-\nsumption has led some insurance companies to price health coverage\nhigher for small companies or to refuse to underwrite small firms at all.\nData And Methods\nWe assembled a longitudinal person-level file of health insurance claims\nand associated demographic and benefits data for subscribers in firms of all\nsizes located in western Pennsylvania. These firms were active customers of\nBlue Cross of Western Pennsylvania (BCWP) and Pennsylvania Blue\nShield (PBS) during all or a part of the study period (1 January 1988-31\nDecember 1990). Subscribers in this database had similar benefits--tradi-\ntional, first-dollar Blue Cross hospitalization coverage, Blue Shield \"UCR-\n100\" professional coverage (100 percent reimbursement of the usual, cus-\ntomary, or reasonable fee), and Major Medical coverage (80 percent of\ncharges for eligible supplementary services).4\nThe resulting database included more than 20.5 million records for\napproximately 1.4 million covered lives (contract holders, spouses, and\ndependents) per year. Databases such as this one are uncommon since few\nlarge third-party payers continue to provide comparable health care benefit\nplans (without medical underwriting, preexisting condition exclusions, and\ncopayments) to small and large firms.\nMembership files, the primary source of eligibility and demographic\ninformation on each subscriber, were validated first.5 Inpatient, profes-\nsional, and supplementary claims for covered services then were linked for\neach subscriber over time to establish episodes of care. By creating a\nperson-level file of claims submitted over three years, we could define the\nmeasure of health care use for each person, firm, and risk pool as a stand-\nardized cost of all covered services per subscriber per year.\nHospital inpatient and outpatient costs were standardized using each\nhospital's ratio of total costs to total charges applied to patient charges\n(RCCAC methodology). No adjustments were made to professional fees or\nsupplementary (ancillary and drug) charges. These cost estimates were\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The resulting cost per subscriber is similar to\nthe insurance industry term pure premium, which reflects the cost of all\ninsured medical services without the insurer's administrative expense or\nany retention fee charged by the insurer for administrative services.\nTo test the hypothesis that use of health services is a function of firm size,\nsubscribers were aggregated into risk pools by firm size using number of\ncontract holders as a surrogate for firm size. A total of 490 distinct firm sizes\nemerged, ranging from firms of one to 18,730. Within each, subscribers\nwere aggregated into ten age/sex strata, yielding a set of 4,900 data points.\nAll other variables (cost per subscriber, proportion of subscribers using\nmetropolitan teaching hospitals, average case-mix units per subscriber, and\nso on) were calculated at the stratum level for each firm size.\nThis analytic design was sensitive to differences among subscribers at\neach firm-size level while providing enough data points for multivariate\nanalysis. To do this analysis at the individual firm level would have been\ninappropriate because of the extreme variability in the number of subscrib-\ners across firms. Similarly, an analysis at the firm-size level, without age/sex\nsubscriber strata, would have incorporated a disproportionate amount of\nvariation within the small firm sizes.\nBecause case-mix units per subscriber were used both as an independent\nvariable in explaining costs and as a dependent variable in explaining\nhealth risk, this is one of the most important variables we constructed. We\nconsidered this variable to be a reasonable surrogate for the health status of\neach risk pool because all subscribers in a pool, including those who used no\nservices, contributed to the measure. A case-mix score was assigned to each\nperson in the database by using the Patient Management Category (PMC)\nClassification and Scoring System and the diagnosis and procedure infor-\nmation on inpatient claims.6\nThe PMC Relative Intensity Score assigned to each subscriber quantifies\nthe illness conditions of inpatients and the relative resource use expected\nfor each patient.7 Subscribers without inpatient use received a score of zero.\nCombining all scores within a given pool and dividing by the number of\nsubscribers in that pool yielded the variable used for health risk status--\ncase-mix units per subscriber. Since this variable is not a measure of prior\nuse, we avoid much of the circularity found with other case-mix measures.\nStudy population. Although large firms (more than 500 contract hold-\ners) make up less than 1 percent of all firms in this database, they account\n36.3 percent of the total number of subscribers (contract holders and their\ndependents, n = 1,360,636). Small firms (fifty or fewer contract holders)\naccount for a similar proportion of contract holders and subscribers (30.5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Firms of ten or fewer contract holders account for\n77-5 percent of the firms and 11.7 percent of the covered lives.\nWe define firm size as the number of BCWP/PBS contract holders in the\nfirm, not necessarily total number of employees. In addition to being a\nreadily available measure of firm size, it is a better indicator for the insur-\nance industry of the size of the firm being rated than is a count of full-time-\nequivalent (FTE) employees. Furthermore, we did not have complete infor-\nmation about whether employees could opt out of coverage, whether\npremium sharing occurred, or who paid the premium, contract holder or\nemployer. However, during the study period BCWP and PBS covered\napproximately 90 percent of the employer-based health insurance in the\narea, benefit options were not a common practice in western Pennsylvania,\nand businesses could enroll or disenroll at any time.\nDemographics and firm size. The proportion of subscribers in each\ncompany over age fifty-five is higher for both the largest and the smallest\nfirms, and lower in mid-size firms (19 percent in firms with more than a\nthousand contract holders; 13.3 percent in firms with ten and fewer con-\ntract holders; and 10.4 percent in firms with fifty-one to one hundred\ncontract holders). Statistical analysis verified a significant relationship\nbetween the mean age of subscribers in each firm size and yearly health care\nuse as measured by total costs of care.\nSex was also found to correlate significantly with costs: Female subscrib-\ners incurred more costs on average ($969 per year) than males ($856 per\nyear). To specify and evaluate the interactive effect of age and sex on use\nand costs, we constructed ten age/sex strata (five age groups by two gender\ngroups) within each firm size.\nResults\nFirm size and costs. Exhibit 1 shows the total cost of care per subscriber\nper year, as well as the cost of each component of care (inpatient, out-\npatient, professional, and supplementary) by firm size. These raw numbers\nshow that the smallest firms (defined as ten or fewer contract holders) have\nhigher costs, on average, than firms of other sizes have. However, the\nlargest firms (more than 1,000 contract holders) also have, on average,\nessentially the same total unadjusted costs of care as the smallest firms. This\nslightly U-shaped distribution (with higher costs for both small and large\nfirms) is similar to the distribution of mean subscriber age across firm sizes.\nTo evaluate the effect of firm size on costs per subscriber while control-\nling for other known sources of variation across strata and firm sizes, we\nused multivariate regression techniques.

The resulting correlation coefficient was 0.03 (p =\n0.45), indicating no relationship.\nThe variable found to have the most significant correlation with costs\nwas case-mix units per subscriber. In general, costs per subscriber are higher\nas age increases. Males are less costly than females, with the exception of\nmale children and adolescents compared with females of the same age.\nFurthermore, with the exception of children age three and under, the\ninteraction of age and case-mix units per subscriber increases the costs per\nsubscriber even more. We believe that the variable related to use of metro-\npolitan teaching hospitals is a further adjustment for price differentials\namong hospitals and reflects the capacity of various types of hospitals. This\nvariable was found to be directly related to the costs of care per subscriber.9\nResults of additional multivariate analyses yielded consistent evidence\nthat risk pools comprising subscribers from small firms do not use more\nservices or incur more costs, on average, than risk pools of subscribers from\nfirms of any other size.

Given the lack of any significant relationship\nbetween firm size and health care costs after adjusting for age, sex, and the\nhealth risk status of policyholders (based on our model), we then explored\nthe relationship between firm size and health risk status. That is, even\nthough subscribers of similar age, sex, and disease mix use similar services,\nare subscribers of small firms sicker than subscribers of large firms, and,\ntherefore, do they pose greater health risks? To answer this question, we\nperformed additional multivariate analyses, this time using case-mix units\nper subscriber as the dependent variable. Approximately 67.8 percent of\nthe variation in case-mix units per subscriber was explained by age, sex, the\ninteraction of age and sex, and the proportion of subscribers using metro-\npolitan teaching hospitals. We found no statistically significant relation-\nship between firm size and health risk. Using firm size as a categorical\nvariable yielded a model that again permitted a direct assessment of the\nassociation of firm size and health risk status, with a resulting correlation\nPooling arrangements. We next sought to understand the effect of\nincluding firms of different sizes in community-rated risk pools. To do this,\nwe calculated the pure premium (costs of use alone, without administrative\nexpense) for various pooling arrangements. Exhibit 2 shows the average\ncost per subscriber per year for selected risk pools. It should be emphasized\nthat these costs are not adjusted for the age, sex, or case-mix of subscribers\nin each pool. That is, no risk adjustment has been applied to these costs.\nRather, they reflect the actual utilization differences occurring among this\nset of small, mid-size, and large firms.\nIf all firms in the study population were pooled, the average cost per\nsubscriber per year would be $916. By contrast, the lowest-cost pooling\nalternative includes firms with 1-500 contract holders ($888), while the\nhighest-cost risk pool includes firms that have more than 500 contract\nholders ($959).

This\nfinding confirms what many policy analysts have suggested in the past: that\nsmall firms would pay less if they were included in community-rated risk\npools. In fact, it is the very small firms of five or fewer contract holders that\nwould pay much less if included with larger firms (Exhibit 3). An unex-\npected finding of this analysis, however, is that very large firms (more than\n500 contract holders) also would pay less if they were included in commu-\nnity-rated risk pools, while mid-size firms, on average, would pay more.\nFurther examination of the risk pool including firms of all sizes indicates\nthat for 65 percent of all firms, the firm-specific average cost per subscriber\nwas less than the community rate of $916 per subscriber per year. That is,\nfor this particular database, these firms (with their low use) would have\nsubsidized the other 35 percent of firms whose use exceeded the pooled\naverage. While only 35 percent of all firms had average costs per subscriber\nper year that exceeded the community rate of $916, the amount of savings\nby these \"winner\" firms if they had paid the community rate (rather than\nthe actual costs of use) far exceeds the amount the \"losers\" would have paid\nbeyond their actual use.\nThis analysis shows that despite the fears of large firms and other advo-\ncates of experience rating, community rating is a feasible approach to\nincreasing the affordability of health insurance among the firms in this\ndatabase. Actual use and cost differences among firms of different sizes are\nsmall, and increasing the size of risk pools, regardless of the size of the firms\nincluded, will improve the stability and thus the predictability of rates.\nPolicy Implications\nContract holders who work for small firms, and their dependents, neither\npose greater health risk nor incur more health care costs than do the\nAverage Cost Per Subscriber Per Year For Risk Pools Of Small Firms, By Firm Size\nSource: Authors' analyses.\nNotes: Firm size is defined by number of contract holders, as explained in text.

Neverthe-\nless, insurers probably will continue to think of small firms as \"too risky,\"\nprimarily because a single, unpredictable, costly illness could have a greater\nimpact on small firms' cost experience and actuarial rating than is the case\nin larger firms. This situation, however, is attributable to the size of the risk\npool, rather than the size of the firm in the risk pool.\nWithout age/sex and case-mix adjustment, both small and large firms in\nour study population had higher costs per subscriber per year than mid-size\nfirms had. Furthermore, risk pools that included smaller companies had a\nlower cost per subscriber than did the risk pools that included larger\ncompanies, especially firms with more than 500 contract holders. These\nfindings suggest that some form of risk pooling is a feasible approach to\ncorrecting insurance market inequities in health care if they are imple-\nmented hand-in-hand with a risk adjustment methodology.\nMany analysts agree that some form of community rating should be used\nto mitigate the effects of a single costly illness on an individual firm's\npremium. Alternatives could be designed to spread risk and reduce variabil-\nity in costs for any one firm in a risk pool. Community rating without\nmedical underwriting is especially important to bring health care coverage\nwithin the financial reach of small firms. The unanswered question is how\nto structure risk pools to reduce variability in costs and stabilize trends.\nDebate in this country has focused on whether community rating should\nbe mandatory or voluntary, publicly financed or subsidized, or some combi-\nnation of these options. Should firms of all sizes be combined, or should\nsome firms be allowed to form their own risk pools and have separate and\ndifferent premiums? What about persons who purchase insurance directly\nfrom private carriers, or for whom insurance is publicly provided?\nAlthough the data used for this study were comprehensive, representing\nnearly all of the insured firms with full-service benefits in one geographic\nregion, we could not address many of the complexities of community rating\nand risk adjustment, such as the more current scenarios of multiple benefit\nplans within each firm, selective contracting, and multiple payer involve-\nment. Furthermore, we did not address the question of including currently\nuninsured persons or other publicly financed insured persons such as\nMedicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. These persons, as well as those who\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

While the concept of commu-\nnity rating or risk pooling would be the same, the level of costs and the risk\nadjustment factors may be much different for other populations.\nWith community rating, by virtue of chance or geographic location, or\nby design, some health plans inevitably will include sicker or healthier\nenrollees than their competitors. Unless each risk pool can approximate the\ncharacteristics of the entire community, application of a risk adjustment\nmethodology will be necessary to maintain a reasonably competitive\nprivate health insurance market. Our analyses represent a framework for\nthe development and validation of such a retrospective risk adjuster.\nMore research is needed, however, to understand how such a risk adjust-\nment mechanism, once designed and tested, would actually work in the\nprivate sector with multiple payers. Given the recent political rejection of\na federally managed solution to health care reform, new thinking is needed\nto create a workable mix of public regulatory and private-sector initiatives\nthat can achieve affordable health care. We believe that our research points\ntoward the conclusion that, with community leadership--by insurance\ncompanies, the corporate community, and others--effective health care\ncan be delivered to all citizens and financed at affordable prices.\nResearch for this paper was funded by The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation (Grant no. 18731 ) .\nThe authors acknowledge the contributions ofRick Coughenour, A\u00ce Schmidt, Robert Schwarzbach,\nand Nancy Nugent, former research analysts at The Pittsburgh Research Institute.

However, this is not true at the level of analysis\nused in this study--age/sex strata within firm sizes. In fact, there is no correlation\nbetween average case-mix units per subscriber and the proportion of subscribers treated\nat metropolitan teaching facilities.
