    "abstract": "Abstract. When people know to look for an unexpected event (eg, a gorilla in a basketball game),\nthey tend to notice that event. But does knowledge that an unexpected event might occur improve\nthe detection of other unexpected events in a similar scene? Subjects watched a new video in which,\nin addition to the gorilla, two other unexpected events occurred: a curtain changed color, and one\nplayer left the scene. Subjects who knew about videos like this one consistently spotted the gorilla\nin the new video, but they were slightly less likely to notice the other events. Foreknowledge that\nunexpected events might occur does not enhance the ability to detect other such events.\nWhen people perform a selective looking task by devoting attention to some aspects of a\ndisplay while ignoring others, they often fail to notice unexpected information in the display.\nThis phenomenon--first studied empirically in the 1970s by Ulric Neisser and his colleagues\n(Neisser and Becklen 1975; Neisser 1979)--has seen a resurgence of interest under the new\nmoniker `inattentional blindness' (Mack and Rock 1998; Simons and Chabris 1999). In one of\nNeisser's better-known examples, subjects viewed a video and counted the number of times\none group of players passed a ball while ignoring another group of players who also passed a\nball. While performing this attention-demanding task, many observers failed to notice when\na woman carrying an open umbrella unexpectedly walked through the scene (described in\nIn Neisser's videos the players and the unexpected event all occupied the same physical\nspace (to test whether attention focuses on objects or regions of space). A consequence of\noverlaying each of the videos is that all of the actors in the scene had a partially transparent,\nghostly appearance. As such, they were not as visible as they would have been had the entire\nevent been filmed with a single camera. Christopher Chabris and I replicated the original\nexperiments using partially transparent players, but we also filmed choreographed sequences\nof all the actors in a single shot (Simons and Chabris 1999). In addition to the woman with an\numbrella, we filmed a version with a woman in a gorilla suit. Our intuition was that these\nfully visible unexpected events would be noticed, but Neisser's perceptual cycle model of\nattention (Neisser 1976; Most et al 2005) predicted that they might not. Our studies not only\nreplicated Neisser's original results with partially transparent events but also showed that\npeople regularly miss fully visible unexpected events. In the most dramatic example, the\n`gorilla' stopped in the middle of the action, turned to face the camera, thumped its chest,\nand exited after a total of 9 s on screen. Only 50% of observers noticed.\nIn part due to the counterintuitive nature of this finding--90% of people predict that they\nwould notice the gorilla (Levin and Angelone 2008; see also Chabris and Simons 2010)--the\n`gorilla' video has become a fairly well-known demonstration of the limits of visual awareness.\nIts notoriety presented an opportunity--the unexpected gorilla is, for many people, no\nlonger unexpected; in the poetic but opaque phrasing of former US Secretary of Defense\nDonald Rumsfeld, it is a `known unknown'. When people know to expect an `unexpected'\n4 D J Simons\nevent, will they be immune to inattentional blindness in videos such as this one? Translated\ninto Rumsfeld-ese, would the presence of an expected unexpected object alert them to the\npossibility of unexpected unexpected objects?\nWith the assistance of undergraduates in a seminar on visual awareness, I filmed a new\nversion of the gorilla video, this time in front of a green-screen that allowed me to digitally\nreplace the background with a red stage curtain and the floor with a wooden stage floor\n(figure 1a). As in the original video, three people wore white shirts and three wore black shirts,\nand each team passed a ball among the members of their group. Due to the arrangement\nof the space where we did the filming, the players moved more slowly than in the original,\nso the video was played to subjects at 120% of its filmed speed. The video as presented to\nsubjects lasted 30 s. Sixteen seconds into the video, a man wearing a gorilla suit entered stage\nright (figure 1b), walked to the center of the scene, turned to face the camera (figure 1c),\nthumped his chest, and exited stage left (figure 1d), remaining on screen for 6 s. Just after\nthe gorilla entered the scene, the curtain backdrop gradually faded from red to gold over a\nperiod of approximately 6 s, and one of the black shirted players casually backed off the right\nside of the screen and remained off camera for the remainder of the video (figures 1b\u00ade).\nFigure 1. Five frames from the video depicting the gorilla event, the curtain change, and the change in\nthe number of players wearing black. The video itself can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\nIGQmdoK_ZfY. Frame A shows the scene before the appearance of the gorilla. Frame B shows the gorilla\nentering the scene and one of the players in black backing out of the scene, both on the right side of\nthe image. Frame C shows the gorilla in the center of the scene thumping its chest. Frame D shows the\ngorilla exiting the scene on the left. Frame E shows the final appearance of the curtain and black team\nafter the gorilla left the scene.\nWe tested a total of 76 subjects in the entryway to the student union building at the\nUniversity of Illinois by playing a version of the video from a DVD on one of two laptops (one\nwith a 13-inch display and one with a 12-inch display). Subjects were instructed to count\nthe number of times the players wearing white shirts passed the ball, and after completing\nMonkeying around 5\nthe task, they were handed a packet with the following questions, each on a separate page\n(yes/no responses were made by checking a box):\n(1) How many passes did you count?\n(2) Did you notice anything unexpected happen during the video? If you answered `yes',\nplease describe what you noticed.\n(3) Have you heard about or seen a video like this one before? If you answered `yes', please\ndescribe what happened in that video.\n(4) In the video you just watched, did you notice any of the following: a person in a gorilla\nsuit, a person in a pirate suit, a person in a rabbit suit, a change to the curtain backdrop,\na change in the number of players, a change in the number of balls, a change in the color\nof a ball.\nOnly 3 subjects in the entire sample spontaneously described a change to the curtain or\nthe number of players in response to question 2. However, more subjects checked `yes' for\nthose items in response to question 4. In order to use the most liberal measure of detection, I\ncoded detection from responses to item 4. Of the 76 subjects, 26 had previously heard about\nor seen the gorilla video or variants of it (the familiar group) and 50 had not (the unfamiliar\ngroup). For analysis, data from 12 subjects were excluded due to inaccurate counting (off by\nmore than 2 passes from the total of 16) or falsely reporting having seen an unexpected event\nthat had not occurred (a false alarm), or both. The resulting data set included 23 subjects in\nthe familiar group and 41 in the unfamiliar group.\nFor those in the unfamiliar group, 56% noticed the gorilla (23 out of 41), a rate roughly\ncomparable to that found with the original video. In contrast, 100% of subjects in the Familiar\ngroup spotted the gorilla. Across both groups, 11% of subjects noticed the curtain change,\nand 16% noticed the change to the number of players on the black team. Only 1 participant\nnoticed both the curtain and the player change.\nAlthough subjects who knew to look for a gorilla were much more likely to spot the gorilla,\nthey were no more likely to notice the other unexpected events. In fact, they might even\nbe less likely to notice (see table 1); only 17% of the subjects (4 out of 23) in the familiar\ngroup noticed either the curtain or the player, whereas 29% (12 of 41) in the unfamiliar group\nnoticed one of the other events.\nTable 1. Percentage of subjects noticing as a function of familiarity with the original gorilla/basketball\nvideo.\nUnexpected event Familiar\nUnfamiliar\nFamiliar that\nnoticed Gorilla\nUnfamiliar that\nnoticed Gorilla\nLooking just at the 23 subjects in each group who noticed the gorilla, twice as many\nsubjects in the unfamiliar group noticed one of the other events (unfamiliar 35%, familiar\n17%). Although these differences in detection of other unexpected events were not statisti-\ncally significant, the trends suggest that knowledge that an unexpected event might occur\ndoes not increase the likelihood that people will notice other unexpected events. If anything,\nfamiliarity with the task and the presence of a `gorilla' actually decreases the likelihood of\nnoticing other events in the same scene.\n6 D J Simons\nThis trend is consistent with the phenomenon of `satisfaction of search'--people are less\nlikely to search for additional targets once they have found their original target (Fleck et al\n2010)--but extends it to the previously untested domain of inattentional blindness and the\ndetection of unexpected objects. In sum, looking for an expected unexpected event has an\nunexpected effect on the detection of other unexpected events.\nAcknowledgements.
