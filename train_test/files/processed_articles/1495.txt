Depression is often present in\nhypertensive patients and has also been associated with increased\nmortality risk.The aim of this study was to evaluate the association\nof depressive symptoms with all-cause mortality and ischemic heart\ndisease (IHD) mortality among adults with self-reported HTN.\nMethods\nWe studied 10,025 participants in the National Health and Nutrition\nEpidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHANES I) who were alive and\ninterviewed in 1982 and had complete data for the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Four groups were\nidentified based screening status at initial interview: (i) no HTN, no\ndepression (reference group); (ii) HTN, no depression; (iii) no HTN,\ndepression; and (iv) both HTN and depression. Cox proportional\nhazards regression was used to calculate multivariate-adjusted\nhazard ratios (HRs) of death for each group.\nResults\nOveranaverageof8years(83,943person-years)offollow-up,patients\nwithbothself-reportedHTNanddepressivesymptomshadthehighest\nmultivariate-adjustedHRforall-causemortalityat1.39(95%confidence\n2.34).Inposthocanalysis,nondepressedhypertensivepatientshad\nsignificantlyloweradjustedHRforall-causemortalitycomparedto\nConclusion\nComorbid depressive symptoms are associated with increased all-\ncause mortality in patients with self-reported HTN.\nKeywords:bloodpressure;depression;epidemiology;hypertension;\nmortality\noriginal contributions\nHypertension, Depression, and Mortality\nand questionnaires that addressed various health topics.\nPersons living in poverty areas, women of childbearing age\nNHANES I cohort were medically examined. The NHANES\nI Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) is a longitudinal\nstudy of participants who were between 25 and 74 years old\nyears at the NHANES I assessment (n = 14,407). Participants\n1982 follow-up interview included data on self-reported medi-\ncal conditions and an assessment of depression based on the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).\nFor this investigation, we analyzed data on participants in the\nNHEFS cohort who completed the CES-D in 1982 and were\nDefinitions of HTN and depression. Self-reported HTN was\nbased on a \"yes\" response to the question, \"Have you ever been\ntold by a doctor that you have hypertension?\" Although this\nquestion does not equate to a diagnosis of HTN, it has been\nvalidated as a screen for HTN in epidemiologic studies.18\u00ad20\nA positive screen for depression in the NHEFS study was\ndefined using the CES-D, a validated self-report scale for\nassessing depression in the general population.21 The scale\nconsists of 20 items rated on a four-point scale with response\ncategories indicating the frequency of occurrence of each\nitem in the previous week. The four-point scale ranges from\n0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the time).\nScores for items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reversed before scores for\nthe 20 items are summed. Total scores range from 0 to 60 with\nhigher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. A cutoff\nof 16 has been used extensively for distinguishing depressed\nfrom nondepressed patients. The CES-D is a valid and reliable\ninstrument for assessing depression in community samples\nwith high internal consistency, good construct and concurrent\nvalidity, and modest test\u00adretest reliability.21\u00ad24\nDefining the study cohort. We defined our cohort as the 10,025\nindividuals who were alive and interviewed in 1982 and who\nhad complete data for the CES-D. Of the 14,407 respondents\nexcluded 498 individuals who either did not have complete data\nfor the CES-D or were missing data for covariates. We divided\nthe cohort into four groups based on the presence or absence\nof self-reported HTN and depressive symptoms (defined as\nand without depression (No HTN/No DEP), (ii) individuals\nwithout HTN but with depression (No HTN/DEP), (iii) indi-\nviduals with HTN but without depression (HTN/No DEP), and\n(iv) individuals with both HTN and depression (HTN/DEP).\nBaseline data collection. Demographic, lifestyle behavior,\nand comorbidity information were collected as part of the\n1982 interview. We included age (in years) as a continuous\nvariable. Race/ethnicity was categorized as white vs. black/\nother. Poverty/income ratio was defined as percentage of the\n400%. Education was categorized as <high-school graduate,\nhigh-school graduate, or >high-school graduate, and marital\nstatus was classified as not married or married. BMI was calcu-\nlated from self-reported weight and height and categorized as\n(30.0). Smoking was grouped as never, former, or current\nsmoker, and physical activity based on the individual's engage-\nment in usual recreational activity was categorized as regular,\nlight, or sedentary. Self-reported aspirin use was dichotomized\nas yes vs. no. In addition, respondents were asked to report\npreviously diagnosed medical conditions, including diabetes,\nheart disease, stroke, and cancer.\nOutcome measures. The main outcome measures were all-\ncause mortality and IHD mortality across the four groups\nin the cohort. Follow-up data were collected in four waves:\nor proxy interviews were conducted and health-care facil-\nity records as well as death certificates were obtained. Death\nfor each cohort member was ascertained through a search\nof the National Death Index or through tracing of vital\nstatus via a proxy interview. The reliability of the National\nDeath Index for epidemiological studies has been previously\nvalidated.25,26 Length of follow-up for each individual was\ncalculated from the date of the baseline interview (1982\u00ad\n1984) to either the date of death or the date of last follow-up\nat which patients without confirmed death were presumed\nalive and lost to follow-up.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with\nSAS27 and SUDAAN28 and the approach recommended by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics for analyzing the NHEFS\nwas used.29 Means or proportions of baseline risk factors were\ncalculated for the reference group (No HTN/No DEP) and\nthe other three groups (No HTN/DEP, HTN/No DEP, and\nHTN/DEP). All-cause mortality rates per 1,000 person-years\nof follow-up were calculated for the four groups. Life expect-\nancy and survival times for the four groups were estimated by\nthe Kaplan\u00adMeier product-limit method. Cox proportional\nhazards regression models were used to calculate multivari-\nate-adjusted HRs of death for each group compared with the\nreference group (model 1). A series of sequential multivariate\nexplanatory models were developed that included potentially\nconfounding sociodemographic and clinical variables. Model\n2 incorporated sociodemographic variables suspected of influ-\nencing the outcomes for hypertensive patients. Model 3 incor-\nporated variables for lifestyle and behavioral variables such as\nphysical activity, smoking, and aspirin use. Model 4 incorpo-\nrated adjustments for comorbid illnesses including diabetes\nmellitus, cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Similar\nmodels were developed with IHD as the outcome of interest.\nWe performed post hoc tests to assess for interaction between\noriginal contributions Hypertension, Depression, and Mortality\nself-reported HTN and high CES-D score. We also developed\nmodels using HTN/DEP as the reference group to determine\nwhether hazard ratios for death from all causes and from IHD\nwere significantly different between the HTN/DEP and HTN/\nNo DEP groups. The assumption of proportionality of hazard\nwas assessed for the four HTN/depression \nclassification groups\nand each study covariate; all multivariate models satisfied this\nassumption.\nResults\nIn this nationally representative sample of 10,025 adults fol-\nlowed for an average duration of 8 years (83,943 person-years of\nthe baseline characteristics of the study participants.

The\nstudy provides evidence that over a mean follow-up period\nof 8 years, the coexistence of HTN and depressive symptoms\nis associated with significantly increased risk of death from\nall causes. The strength of this association was diminished\nsomewhat after controlling for sociodemographic, behav-\nior/lifestyle, and comorbid disease variables in sequential\nmultivariate-adjusted models. However, even after adjusting\nfor clinically relevant confounders, people with self-reported\nHTN still had a significant 15% lower relative hazard for death\nwhen compared to the group with both self-reported HTN\nand depressive symptoms.\nWe observed similar trends toward increased IHD mortal-\nity in patients with comorbid HTN and depression, but this\ndid not reach statistical significance. There are several poten-\ntial reasons for this observation. First, the smaller number\nof IHD deaths may have limited our power to observe a dif-\nference in IHD mortality between the two groups. Second,\nit is possible that a significant number of patients evaluated\nin 1982 may have been classified as nonhypertensive who\nwould be considered hypertensive based on current guide-\nlines.

If a significant proportion of hypertensive\npatients were included in the \"no HTN group\", then this would\ntend to minimize the risk difference between the two groups.\nAdditionally, there may have been crossover between groups if\npatients developed HTN during the 8-year follow-up. If \"con-\ntamination\" and crossover were significant, this may explain\nwhy there was also no difference in cardiovascular mortality\nbetween the group of hypertensive individuals with and with-\nout comorbid depression.\nAnda et al. previously described a relationship between\nsymptoms of depressed affect/hopelessness and subsequent\nIHD morbidity and mortality in the NHANES I NHEFS study\ncohort. These investigators found that the relative risk of\nfrom the General Well-Being Schedule depression sub-scale\n(GWB-D). A separate group has reported a significant cor-\nrelation between positive screen for depressive symptoms on\ncohort.33 NHEFS patients received the CES-D and two items\nof the GWB-D during follow-up interviews, and 83 and 89%\nof patients were classified in the same (depressed/nonde-\npressed) category on follow-up exam by the CES-D and GWB,\nrespectively.\nOur report differs from the prior report by Anda et al. in sev-\neral important ways. First, our analysis uses the CES-D in place\nof the GWB depression scale. The CES-D has better reported\nsensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of all depressive\nsyndromes when compared to the gold standard structured\nclinical exam.21\u00ad24 Second, our analysis also looks at all-cause\nmortality in addition to IHD mortality. Third, Anda et al. did\nnot include HTN in their models. In fact, they specifically\nexcluded respondents with baseline comorbid coronary artery\ndisease/angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and conges-\ntive heart failure from their sample.\nIt is important for clinicians to appreciate the risk of comor-\nbid depression in their patients with HTN for several reasons.\nFirst, depression has been shown to be a predictor of incident\nHTN.34 Second, depression has been shown to adversely affect\nadherence to medical therapy for HTN.35,36 This study supports\nthe notion that there is an additional mortality risk associated\nwith comorbid HTN and depression. The biologic mecha-\nnisms underlying this observed association are not clear, but\nit is possible that increased burden of chronic diseases includ-\ning depression may contribute to increased allostatic load in\naffected patients.37 Finally, there is emerging evidence that inte-\ngrated treatment strategies that target both HTN and depres-\nsion simultaneously are safe and have the potential to improve\noutcomes in primary care and subspecialty settings.38\u00ad41\nThe approach in this study has several strengths in that it\nfeatures a large, nationally representative sample prospectively\nfollowed for a relatively long interval with available informa-\ntion on key risk factors. This approach does have some limita-\ntions. First, data were based on self-report, which might allow\nmisclassification. However, available evidence suggests that\nself-reported information on chronic diseases and cardiovas-\nSecond, the diagnosis of depression was not based on clinical\ninterview, the gold standard for diagnosis. However, the CES-D\nis a well-validated and accepted tool for use in screening large\npopulations for depression.21\u00ad24 Third, it is possible that there\nwas some misclassification of HTN status given the evolution\nof our understanding of HTN risk and diagnostic guidelines\nover time. As discussed above, this phenomenon, if present,\nwould tend to underestimate the between-group differences.\nAnother important limitation of this study is the lack of infor-\nmation regarding the severity of HTN in this data set given that\nthe degree of both systolic and diastolic BP elevation has a lin-\near relationship to cardiovascular disease risk and mortality.45\nIn summary, both HTN and depression are highly prevalent\nconditions conferring significant risk for overall morbidity and\nmortality.
