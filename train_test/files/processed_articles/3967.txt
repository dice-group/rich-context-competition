    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nSignalling through the IGF1R [type 1 IGF (insulin-like growth\nfactor) receptor] and canonical Wnt signalling are two\nsignalling pathways that play critical roles in regulating\nneural cell generation and growth. To determine whether the\nsignalling through the IGF1R can interact with the canonical\nWnt signalling pathway in neural cells in vivo, we studied\nmutant mice with altered IGF signalling. We found that in\nmice with blunted IGF1R expression specifically in nestin-\nexpressing neural cells (IGF1RNestin2KO mice) the abundance\nof neural b-catenin was significantly reduced. Blunting\nIGF1R expression also markedly decreased: (i) the activity of\na LacZ (b-galactosidase) reporter transgene that responds to\nWnt nuclear signalling (LacZTCF reporter transgene) and (ii)\nthe number of proliferating neural precursors. In contrast,\noverexpressing IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor I) in brain\nmarkedly increased the activity of the LacZTCF reporter\ntransgene. Consistently, IGF-I treatment also markedly\nincreased the activity of the LacZTCF reporter transgene in\nembryonic neuron cultures that are derived from LacZTCF Tg\n(transgenic) mice. Importantly, increasing the abundance of\nb-catenin in IGF1RNestin2KO embryonic brains by suppressing\nthe activity of GSK3b (glycogen synthase kinase-3b)\nsignificantly alleviated the phenotypic changes induced by\nIGF1R deficiency. These phenotypic changes includes: (i)\nretarded brain growth, (ii) reduced precursor proliferation\nand (iii) decreased neuronal number. Our current data,\nconsistent with our previous study of cultured oligoden-\ndrocytes, strongly support the concept that IGF signalling\ninteracts with canonical Wnt signalling in the developing\nbrain to promote neural proliferation. The interaction of IGF\nand canonical Wnt signalling plays an important role in\nnormal brain development by promoting neural precursor\nproliferation.\n",

During the past two decades,\naccumulating experimental data have convincingly estab-\nlished an essential role for IGF (insulin-like growth factor)\nsignalling in the normal development and growth of neural\ncells.

Many of these results have been\nconfirmed in mutant mice. Overexpressing IGF-I in the brain of\nTg (transgenic) mice increases neural proliferation (Ye\nYe et al., 1995), and reduces neural cell apoptosis (Ye\nin specific neural cells (Zeger et al., 2007; Kappeler\nsignificantly retards brain growth by decreasing the prolifera-\ntion of neural precursors and the survival of neurons and\noligodendrocytes. These data convincingly show that signalling\nthrough the IGF1R is essential to the normal development of the\nCNS. The precise intracellular signalling pathway(s) that\nmediates each of these IGF actions and IGF interactions with\nother neural signalling, however, remain to be defined.\nCanonical Wnt signalling, mediated through b-catenin\ncritical role in neural development and growth. For example,\nTg mice overexpressing b-catenin exhibit brain overgrowth\nwith a greater proportion of neural precursors re-entering\nb-catenin expression is increased in the SVZ (subventricular\nzone) of adult mice, the proliferation of neural precursors is\nincreased (Adachi et al., 2007). In contrast, blunting the\nexpression of b-catenin or Wnt3, an extracellular Wnt ligand,\nleads to a marked retardation of brain growth (Machon et al.,\nin neural proliferation (Machon et al., 2003; Adachi et al.,\n2007) and an increase in apoptosis of neural precursors\nWhile the role of IGF and canonical Wnt signalling\npathways in neurogenesis has been independently studied\nextensively, the interactions of the two important signalling\npathways, as well as the functions of their interactions,\nduring development remain largely unclear. Recently, our\nstudies of oligodendroglial cultures suggest that b-catenin\nacts as a signalling molecule downstream of the IGF-I-PI3K\n(phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-Akt pathway, partially mediating\nIGF proliferative and survival signalling (Ye et al., 2010). To\nfurther determine whether this new IGF signalling pathway\nalso exists in neural cells during normal in vivo development,\nand if so, what role it plays in neurogenesis, we studied\nmutant mice with ablated IGF1R specifically in nestin-\nexpressing neural cells (IGF1RNestin2KO mice). As almost all\nIGF1RNestin2KO mice die within 48 h after birth (Liu et al.,\n2009b), our study focused on prenatal development. In this\nreport, we provide evidence that IGF signalling interacts with\ncanonical Wnt signalling, at least at the level of b-catenin, to\npromote neural cell proliferation during normal brain\ndevelopment. Our data also strongly suggest that a portion\nof IGF-I and Wnt signalling converges by regulating the\nphosphorylation and activity of GSK3b (glycogen synthase\nkinase-3b) and the abundance of b-catenin.\nMutant mice\nGeneration and characterization of IGF1RNestin2KO mice have\nbeen described previously (Liu et al., 2009b). Mutant mice\ncarrying a LacZ (b-galactosidase) reporter transgene that is\nunder the control of a promoter containing multiple copies of\nconsensus TCF (T-cell factor)-binding motifs (LacZTCF Tg mice,\nMaretto et al., 2003) were obtained from the Jackson\nLaboratory.\nTo suppress GSK3b activity in embryonic brains, pregnant\ndams bearing E11.5 IGF1RNestin2KO embryos were treated with\nLiCl at a concentration of 0.24% for 5\u00ad7 days as a supplement\nconcentration has been shown to be well below the level of\ntoxicity for fetuses (Szabo, 1970). Sucrose (5%) was added to\nimprove taste, and NaCl (0.9%) was added to maintain\nsodium balance and correct diuresis that may be caused by\nIGF1RNestin2KO and control mice, given the same amount of\nsucrose and NaCl, served as treatment controls. No obvious\nabnormalities in gross brain morphology were observed in\nmice receiving LiCl. Some pregnant dams bearing E11.5\nIGF1RNestin2KO embryos were treated with the GSK3b\nadministered by oral gavage at 30 mmol/kg, twice daily for 6\nwas reconstituted in a modified solution (Noble et al., 2005)\nthat contains 40% poly(ethylene glycol) 400 and PBS, and\ndimethylamine was omitted from the original recipe because\nof its high toxicity in vivo. All procedures used were\nconsistent with the guidelines of National Institutes of\nHealth and approved by the institutional review committees\nof the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nLacZ histochemistry\nBrains were fresh-frozen in liquid N2\n, and coronally sectioned\n(18\u00ad20 mm in thickness) on a cryostat. Serial sections,\ncomprising every sixth section, were obtained, and subjected\nto LacZ histochemical staining, as we previously described\n(Zeger et al., 2007). Briefly, sections were fixed with cold 2%\nPFA (paraformaldehyde) and 0.02% glutaraldehyde in PBS for\n10 min on ice. After extensive washes with cold PBS, sections\nwere incubated with a reaction buffer (Mercer et al., 1991)\nthat contained 1 mg/ml X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl\nb-D-galactopyranoside) and 2 mM MgCl2\n.

Two\nto three sets of serial sections (8 mm in thickness), comprising\nevery seventh section, were obtained. One set of the series\nsections was stained with Cresyl Violet. To determine the\nvolume of HIP and CA (cornu ammonis) PCL (pyramidal cell\nlayer), the area of the brain regions on each sections\n[corresponding to plates between number GD18 Cor. 12 and\nmicroscope, assisted with Stereo Investigator software\n(Microbrightfield). The volume (V ) was then estimated using\nthe equation V5SA6T6I, where SA is the sum of area\nmeasured on each section, T is the section thickness and I is\nthe section intervals.\nThe numerical density of CA pyramidal neurons (neurons\nper mm3) was determined using previously published\nmethods (Dentremont et al., 1999). Briefly, stained sections\ncorresponding to plate GD18 Cor. 14 in Schambra et al.\n(1992) from each brain was selected, and cell nuclei within\ndelineated areas of interest were counted, assisted with\nStereo Investigator software. The total number of CA neurons\nwas calculated from the estimate of tissue volume and the\nnumerical density of neurons.\nCulture of embryonic frontal cortex\nFrontal cortex from E14.5 LacZTCF Tg embryos were minced into\nsmall pieces and digested with papain (1 unit/ml) at 37\u00b0C for\n3 min. Single cells, obtained by titration and passing through a\nscreen, were seeded on to poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips\nindividually placed in six-well plates, and cultured with a\ngrowth medium [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium)/\nF12 medium supplemented with insulin-containing F27 me-\ndium (Invitrogen)]. After 2 days in culture, the growth medium\nwas replaced by a low-insulin medium [DMEM/F12 me-\ndium supplemented with an alternative F27 medium containing\nno insulin (Invitrogen) and with 5 ng/ml of insulin]. At the\nconcentration of 5 ng/ml, insulin does not activate IGF1R.\nR&D Systems), or a combination of both IGF-I (100 ng/ml) and\nWnt3a (10 ng/ml) were then added to cultures for 24 h.\nTo quantify LacZ-positive (+) cells, cells on each of the\ncoverslips were immunostained with an antibody against LacZ\n(1:400, Abcam). Antibody\u00adantigen complexes were detected by\nan Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated secondary antibody\n(Invitrogen), and cell nuclei were counterstained with the\nnuclear dye DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen).\nSix random fluorescent images per coverslip were digitally\ncaptured using a fluorescent microscope and a Spot Jr. digital\ncamera (Diagnostic Instruments). LacZ+cells, each with a clearly\nvisible nucleus, were scored on the captured images, and their\nnumber was calculated as a percentage of total cells (judged by\nDAPI stained nuclei). More than 970 cells in each group were\nassessed.\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrains were fresh-frozen and serially sectioned as described\nabove. After being fixed with 4% PFA and washing with PBS,\nsections were subjected to immunostaining. Primary anti-\nbodies against the following proteins were used: b-catenin\n(1:500, Vector Laboratories). Antibody\u00adantigen complexes\nwere detected by an Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated or Alexa\nFluorH 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Cell\nnuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Staining without\nprimary antibodies served as negative controls, and no\nsignificant non-specific background staining was observed.\nFluorescent images were digitally captured and analysed\nusing a fluorescent microscope and a Spot Jr. digital camera.\nTo quantify the number of pH3Ser10+ proliferating neural\nprecursors in VZ (ventricular zone), the areas of VZ in immuno-\nstained sections, corresponding to plate GD18 Cor. 10 in\nSchambra et al. (1992) from each brain, were digitally captured.\nOn captured images, pH3Ser10+cells in VZ, each with a clearly\nvisible nucleus, were scored, and their number within a defined\nlinear length (100 mm) was calculated.\nProtein Western immunoblot analysis\nTissues were pulverized on solid CO2\n, and protein was extracted as\npreviously described (Richards et al., 2001). Aliquots of protein\n(30\u00ad40 mg) were separated on polyacrylamide gels and trans-\nferred on to PVDF membranes (Amersham). Proteins of interest\nwere detected using specific antibodies and visualized using ECLH\n(enhanced chemiluminescence; Amersham). Primary antibodies\nspecific protein bands on X-ray films were digitally scanned and\nquantitatively analysed using a computer-assisted image analysis\nsystem (Image-Pro, Media Cybermetics).

In agreement with Western immunoblot ana-\nlyses, immunoflorescence staining showed that in E17.5\nIGF1RNestin2KO mice both nuclear b-catenin and membrane-\nbond b-catenin were markedly reduced in multiple brain\nregions, including HIP, VZ and SVZ (Figure 2), brain regions\nwhere neural precursors actively proliferate. Similarly, the\nabundance of b-catenin protein was also significantly\ndecreased in the DG (dentate gyrus) and cerebellum of mice\nwith an IGF-I null mutation [IGF-I KO (knockout) mice (Liu\nTo directly determine whether IGF signalling can influence\nthe nuclear Wnt\u00adb-catenin signalling, we bred LacZTCF reporter\nTg mice with IGF1RNestin2KO mice.

Thus, this\nmouse model allows us to readily assess canonical Wnt\u00adb-\ncatenin signalling in vivo by monitoring the expression pattern\nof LacZ. At E16.5\u00adE18.5, LacZ+ cells were readily detected in\nmany brain regions, including VZ, SVZ and DG, a finding that\nis consistent with previous reports (Maretto et al., 2003; Lie\net al., 2005). In DG, LacZ expression was predominantly\nobserved in granule cells and subgranule layer cells. When\ncompared with control mice (i.e. LacZTCF Tg mice without\naltered IGF signalling), blunting IGF1R expression in LacZTCF/\nIGF1RNestin2KO double mutant mice significantly decreased\nLacZ staining.

Consistent with these in vivo results, IGF-I\ntreatment of cultured embryonic cells derived from E14.5\nLacZTCF frontal cortex also showed significant increases in the\nintensity of LacZ staining and in the number of LacZ+ cells\n(Figure 4).

Similarly, the number of\nKi67+ cells was also decreased in IGF1RNestin2KO mice by\n,40% and ,26% in DG and VZ/SVZ respectively (Table 1).\nIntriguingly, there is only a fraction of Ki67+ proliferating\ncells that also exhibit active expression of the LacZ reporter\ntransgene. The reason(s) for this is not clear. One of the\npossible explanations is that b-catenin can activate nuclear\nWnt signalling in a TCF-independent manner (Filali et al.,\n2002).

To determine whether IGF signalling also\ncan regulate the expression of other canonical Wnt signalling\nmolecules in mouse brain, we quantified the abundance of\nmRNA for Wnt ligands, frizzled receptors and TCF-4\ntranscription factor, which are highly expressed in the CNS\nin a spatial- and temporal-specific pattern (Roelink and\nand Dressler, 1998). As shown in Figure 6, the mRNA\nabundance of the Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors\nexamined, except for Wnt 3a and Frizzled 3, was similar in\nthe brain of E17.5 IGF1RNestin2KO mice and control mice. The\nabundance of TCF-4 mRNA in IGF1RNestin2KO mice also did\nnot differ from that in control mice (Figure 6).

In contrast, overexpressing IGF-I in LacZTCF Tg\nbrain and IGF-I treatment of cultured neuronal cells derived\nfrom LacZTCF brain markedly increases the expression of the\nLacZTCF reporter transgene. Furthermore, increasing b-catenin\nabundance by suppressing pGSK3b activity drastically reduces\nthe detrimental effects of IGF1R deficiency on neural growth,\nas evidenced by increases in brain weight, the volume of HIP\nand CA, the number of PCL neurons, and the neural\nproliferation capacity in IGF1RNestin2KO mice.\nConsistent with our previous report showing a critical role\nfor neural IGF signalling during postnatal life (Liu et al.,\n2009b), our current study also demonstrates that blunting\nIGF1R expression specifically in the nestin+ neural precursors\nand their progeny significantly reduces the weight of\ndeveloping brain, the volume of HIP and the number of py-\nramidal neurons during embryonic development. These results\nsupport a critical role for IGF\u00adIGF1R signalling in neurogen-\nesis and brain growth during normal prenatal development.\nAt E17.5, when neural precursors actively proliferated in both\nVZ/SVZ and HIP, deficiency in IGF\u00adIGF1R signalling leads to a\nsignificant reduction in the number of proliferating neural\nprecursors. In contrast, less than 0.05% of active caspase 3\npositive apoptotic cells are detected in VZ and other brain\nregions, and no significant differences are observed between\nIGF1RNestin2KO mice and control mice. These data are\nconsistent with our previous study of Tg mice overexpressing\nIGF-I in nestin+ neural precursors (Popken et al., 2004), and\nsuggest that, at this stage of brain development, neural\napoptosis is unlikely a major factor in neurogenesis; rather,\nprecursor proliferation plays a significant role in response to\nIGF stimulation.\nThe Erk MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway\nhas been thought to play a major role in cell proliferation.\nHowever, accumulating evidence indicates that in neural cells\nthe PI3K-Akt pathway plays a critical role in cell proliferation\nand is likely required for a full mitogenic response to IGF-I.\nOverexpression of Akt enhances the proliferation of cortical\nneural precursors (Sinor and Lillien, 2004). Conversely,\ninhibiting PI3K-Akt activity markedly suppresses the IGF-I-\nstimulated proliferation in cultured cortical neural precursors\n(Mairet-Coello et al., 2009) and cerebellar granule cell\nprecursors (Cui et al., 1998). In line with these reports, our\nprevious studies of cultured oligodendroglial precursor cells\nalso demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K-Akt activity hinders\nthe IGF-I-stimulated expression of mRNA for cyclin D1\nprotein (Ye et al., 2010), a molecule key to the cell-cycle\nprogression through the G1\n/S phases. The IGF-I stimulatory\neffects on cyclin D1 expression are partially mediated by b-\ncatenin (Ye et al., 2010), a key member of the canonical Wnt\nsignalling pathway, indicating that IGF signalling can interact\nwith Wnt canonical signalling, via the PI3K-Akt-b-catenin\npathway, to promote their proliferations. While the predom-\ninant neuronal expression of the nestin-driven Cre transgene\nin our mutant mice (Liu et al., 2009b) precludes studies on\noligodendrocyte lineage cells in vivo, our current study clearly\nsupports the concept that b-catenin plays an important role\nin IGF proliferation signalling during neuronal development\nby showing that in neuronal precursor cells: (i) IGF signalling\nregulates the abundance of b-catenin and the activity of the\nLacZTCF reporter transgene, which responds to nuclear Wnt\nsignalling stimulation, and (ii) increasing b-catenin abund-\nance mitigates the detrimental effects of IGF1R deficiency on\nneural proliferation.\nOur data also show that ablating neural IGF1R expression\nsignificantly reduces the abundance of b-catenin protein and its\nmRNA in the brain of mutant mice, suggesting that IGF\nsignalling regulates the expression of b-catenin at both the\nprotein and mRNA level. These findings are consistent with our\nprevious study of cultured neural cells (Ye et al., 2010). In\ncultured oligodendrocytes, IGF-I rapidly increases the abund-\nance of b-catenin protein as early as 1 h after treatment, likely\nby enhancing its stability. In contrast, the expression of b-\ncatenin mRNA is not altered during first 4 h of treatment and\nbecomes significantly up-regulated after 24 h of treatment (Ye\net al., 2010). Despite the distinct patterns of b-catenin protein\nand its mRNA expression in response to IGF-I stimulation,\ninhibition of PI3K-Akt kinases significantly suppresses the IGF-I-\nstimulated increases in both b-catenin protein and mRNA (Ye\net al., 2010), indicating a critical role for PI3K-Akt in IGF-I\nstimulatory actions on both b-catenin protein and mRNA in\ncultured oligodendrocytes. Whether IGF signalling also regulates\nthe expression of b-catenin protein and its mRNA in a similar\npattern in vivo remains to be determined.\nWhile the brain expression of individual members in\nthe Wnt signalling pathway has not been fully defined,\nmultiple Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors and TCF/LEF\n(lymphoid enhancer factor) family transcription factors are\nhighly expressed in the CNS in a spatial- and temporal-\nthese reports, we also observed abundant expression of mRNA\nfor multiple Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors, as well as\nTCF-4 transcription factor, in developing forebrains. The\nIGF and Wnt signalling interacts in neuronal cells\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nmRNA abundance of these proteins, however, is similar in\nE17.5 IGF1RNestin2KO mice and their littermate controls,\nexcept for Wnt 3a mRNA and Frizzled 3 mRNA, both of\nwhich are increased in IGF1RNestin2KO mice. As b-catenin, a\nmolecule downstream of Wnt and Frizzled receptor, is\nsignificantly decreased in IGF1RNestin2KO mice, we interpret\nthe increased expression of Wnt 3a and Frizzled 3 mRNA as\ncompensatory to reduced b-catenin signalling, and deem that\nIGF signalling and Wnt signalling are likely to interact mainly\nat the levels of GSK3b and b-catenin, although other\nmechanisms may also exist.\nIn summary, our new findings strongly point to a critically\nimportant role for the IGF and Wnt\u00adb-catenin signalling\ninteraction during normal in vivo neurogenesis, and suggest\nthat b-catenin is a common effector mediating a portion of\nIGF and Wnt signalling to promote neural cell proliferation.\nOur conclusion is further supported by an earlier report that\nIGF-I signalling is capable of interacting with Wnt\u00adJNK (c-Jun\nN-terminal kinase) signalling in Xenopus embryo (Carron\net al., 2005), albeit their actions are likely different in early\nstages of embryonic development.
