Among its distinctive characteristics, there is the\nfact that it flows steadily and that it corresponds also to\nlength. In this, we can distinguish it from relative time,\ndefined as \"apparent\" and \"vulgar\" because it is only a mea-\nsurement of absolute time. Space considered in an absolute\nsense, the physicist tells us, is by nature void of relations with\nexternal elements. For this reason, it is always the same and\nremains still. When, instead, we refer to relative space, it is\nnecessary to consider it as a moving dimension or as a mea-\nsurement of absolute space that our senses define according\nto its position with the surrounding bodies. A place is the part\nof space occupied by a body, and with reference to space, it\ncan be absolute or relative (1965). It is a linear conception of\ntime--the one proposed by Newton--that will later on be\ncriticized by A. Einstein with his equation of relativity.\nYet the concepts of time and space described by Newton\nsuit the cultural and experiential dimension outlined by\nM. McLuhan (1962) in his description of phonetic and visual\nculture--an analysis, which moving from the introduction of\nthe alphabet, brings us to Gutenberg and to the electronic\nmedia. It is only at the end of the 19th century that the tele-\nphone became a habit for the inhabitants of the Western\nworld. Before then, there had never been the need to assign\nthe codification or the decodification of a message to any\nkind of media. The necessary competences to perform this\nfunction were, in fact, already innate in the sender and the\nreceiver of the message: in man. Language, the mastery of\nthe alphabet, and, of course, hearing and sight are things that\nman possesses. Man crystallizes as a medium of the things that\nare communicated through him. With the spreading of electri-\ncal media, among which McLuhan considers also automation,\nman can expand his senses, overcoming the barriers of face-\nto-face communication. The communication process expands\nover time and space: It goes beyond the physical place. There\nis the possibility to communicate at a distance with different\ntimes of emission and reception. Relying once again on the\ngreat scholars of the past, but without abusing their knowl-\nedge, we can establish a parallelism between the new percep-\ntion of time and space offered to us by the Web and what\nEinstein says with his equation of relativity. Moving from\nthe consideration that if the time of the perception of all\nobjects was instantaneous, then the speed of light would be\ninfinite, Einstein starts confuting the idea of linear time. In\n1University \"Kore\" of Enna, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nGevisa La Rocca, Faculty of Humanities and Social, University \"Kore\" of\nEnna, Cittadella Universitaria, Enna, 94100, Italy\nEmail: gevisa.larocca@unikore.it\nFrom the Alphabet to the Web:\nHowTime, Space, andThought\nHave Changed\nGevisa La Rocca1\n Keywords\ncommunication, culture, media, and society, new media\n2 SAGE Open\nfact, Einstein says that this is not true--the speed of light is\nnot infinite--and in declaring this, he was able to count on\nthe studies carried out in those years on this issue. The speed\nof light is high, but it is not infinite, and it corresponds to\nenunciation is that nothing can be measured as fast as light.\nEinstein imagined riding the light that carries the informa-\ntion about movement, and he therefore understood that it\nwas necessary to change the dimensions of time and space\nwhen the events are being observed. In Einstein's opinion,\nspace and time are not distinct absolute quantities as Newton\nhad presupposed. They are instead intrinsically relative, so\nthat space cannot absolutely be distinguished from time; it is\nthe interaction between energy and matter that determines\nvariable dimensions of time and space in the universe. These\nwords recall those of J. Meyrowitz (1985), according to\nwhom the influence of mass media is not so much in the\nvehiculated content but in their ability to create social situa-\ntions where interactions can take place, transforming com-\nmunicative models and favoring social change. The idea of\ntime and space used by the Web picks up the one outlined by\nEinstein, and it could incur in the same paradoxes. For exam-\nple, when we talk about communication via the Internet, we\nindicate it as simultaneous, but is it really so? How much\ntime passes from the emission of the message and its recep-\ntion? Can we \"really\" consider it simultaneous? Certainly\nnot. What we can here point out is that we pass from the\nlinear time typical of the alphabet to a dimension of time and\nspace connected to each other and capable of drawing a net\nof relations and \"places.\"\nThe systems of communication have changed, change,\nand will probably continue to change our perception of prox-\nimity. What was once perceived as distant is now part of our\nspace of experience, that is, of that place where everything\nappears to be simultaneous. Information travels across the\nWeb in simultaneous time. The Medium Theory (Meyrowitz,\n1994) considers media as \"environments\" in which interac-\ntions between individuals occur, contributing to the creation\nof \"technologically structured communities.\" This distances\nus from the idea that the means of communication are pas-\nsive containers inside which information moves. The exam-\nples in favor of this statement are numerous and are connected\nto the very introduction of a \"new technology\" (Paccagnella,\nthe invention of print had consequences on the general struc-\nture of society; satellites, radars, and, more in general, the\nnew communication technologies have changed military\nstrategies and tactics (De Landa, 1991). If we normally attri-\nbute to the invention of print and of movable type the pas-\nsage from traditional to modern society, Marvin (1988)\nmakes the attempt to position that moment toward the end of\nthe 19th century, when the communicative potential of the\ntelephone, the telegraph, and the light bulb was discovered.\nWith the development of the Internet, and with the increas-\ning pervasiveness of communication between networked\ncomputers, we are in the middle of the most transforming\ntechnologicaleventsincethecaptureoffire(Haythornthwaite\nIn recent years, the spreading of the Internet has changed\nand widened the modalities, the space, and the time of com-\nmunication, work, and structure of thought. Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICT) have become so perva-\nsive that the situational geography of social life has changed\n(Meyrowitz, 1985), projecting in the telematic sphere (Picci,\nTime and space, considered as social constructs, undergo\nconstruction and deconstruction processes linked to the tech-\nnologies and the \"cultures\" (phonetic, visual), which are\nintroduced from time to time.\nTime From the Alphabet to the Web\nTime in Linear Communication\nIn The Gutenberg Galaxy, McLuhan (1962) affirms that the\ninteriorization of the phonetic alphabet transports man from\nthe magical world of hearing to the neutral world of sight.\nWith the introduction of technological innovations, there is\na substantial change in the vision of the world of a European\nor American boy in comparison with that proper of an\nAfrican one. In an example offered by McLuhan, the tech-\nnology surrounding boys coming from the Western world is\nessentially described as visual, abstract, and explicit, where\nthings occur in times and spaces that are continuous, uni-\nform, and in linear succession. On the contrary, African boys\nlive in an implicit and magical world of resonant words\n(McLuhan, 1962). To strengthen this analysis, McLuhan\nquotes a research by J. C. Carothers, which appeared in the\njournal Psychiatry in November 1959. This author asks in\nwhat way teaching how to read and write can determine in\nsociety the passage from the idea of words as a living and\nresonant strength to that of a simple mental meaning. In his\nstudies, Carothers compares illiterate and literate aboriginals\nand then, more generically, illiterates and Western world\nmen. His observations push him to conclude that Western\nworld men move from a reality where sounds are dynamic\nand external objects to another reality where, because of the\nexistence of writing, they lose these characteristics and are\nsubject to sight. The Western world man, affirms therefore\nCarothers, \"mainly relies on the structuring of time-space\nrelationships without which it is impossible to obtain the\nmechanical sense of casual relationships necessary to give\nan order to our experiences\" (McLuhan, 1962, p. 44). This is\nthe direct consequence of writing: In fact, as soon as words\nare colored with ink, they become part of the visual world,\nand they abandon the hearing one. This is also the opinion of\nW. J. Ong (1982), when he stresses the change in the rela-\ntionship between space and discourse with reference to the\npress. The use of different media to communicate produces\nits consequences in the experiential world of man, who ends\nLa Rocca 3\nup therefore changing his way of perceiving time and space.\nThe relationship between culture and technology is a theme\nthat McLuhan and the School of Toronto are fond of. H. Innis\n(1952) in The Bias of Communication had indicated that writ-\ning systems develop as a means capable of coordinating and\ncontrolling human activities with reference to a greater\nextension of time and space. The same author in a previous\nbook titled Empire and Communication (Innis, 1950) had\nalready highlighted how a fundamental distinction to be\nmade in terms of communication is the one that separates\noral from written cultures, pointing out that whereas Greek\ncivilization had been kept together by an oral culture, Roman\ncivilization had been based on a written one. The conse-\nquences of the introduction of the alphabet were put forward\nagain by McLuhan, who defined the literate as a \"divided\"\nand \"schizophrenic\" man. Such schizophrenia was attributed\nto the phonetic alphabet with its \"abstraction of a meaning\nfrom sound and the translation of sound in a visual code.\" It\nforces, in fact, man to face an experience that transforms him\nnetic alphabet has the capability of liberating man from the\ntribe because he is taken away from the tight net of interac-\ntions of the hearing system. Man abandons or rather \"comes\nout of\" those simultaneous relationships typical of acoustic\nand oral spaces, and he finds himself in the world of the\nalphabet. Here, he lives a moment of dualistic schizophre-\nnia, due to the dilatation or externalization of one sense or\nanother. Yet, when technology extends one of our senses, a\nnew cultural translation takes place at the same speed with\nwhich the new technology is internalized. The coming of the\nInternet Galaxy (Castells, 2001) produces a fusion between\nhearing and sight. If the introduction of a new technology\ndetermines a dilatation and an intertwining of our senses and\nif this has already been discovered by McLuhan in the pas-\nsage from the magical world of sounds to the alphabet, in\nother words from a hearing system to a visual linear time one,\nhow can we explain multisequentiality? How can we insert\nin an interpretative dimension the question put forward by\nN. Carr (2010): \"Does the Internet make us stupid? Or does\nit only make us once again schizophrenic?\"\nTimelessTime\nIt is in The Rise of Network Society that Castells (1996)\nidentifies in simultaneity and timelessness the characteris-\ntics of time in our society. This is a consequence of com-\nputer-mediated communication that makes it possible to talk\nin real time with chat and interactive systems. The conse-\nquences of this system of communication can be traced in\nthe predominant cultural system.\nThe reorganization of media time within the same\nchannel of communication and with the free choice of\nthe spectator/actor, creates a temporal collage in which\nonly genres are mixed together, while time becomes\nsynchronic over a flat horizon, without a beginning, an\nTimelessness--Castells (1996) adds--is a trait of our cul-\nture deriving from the structure of the multimedia hypertext.\nAlso for him, this way of finding and structuring information\n\"shapes the minds and memories of the children educated in\nthe new cultural context\" (p. 526). Time events and, more in\ngeneral, history are organized in sequences, in extractable\nfreeze-frames so that a visual culture prevails. The author\nreminds us how encyclopedias organized knowledge in\nalphabetical order. At present, instead, the means of commu-\nnication organize the access to information according to the\nneeds of producers and consumers. Proceeding this way, the\nevents lack chronological order and what we obtain is a cul-\nture of the eternal and of the ephemeral. The predominant\nculture is eternal because it is able to move forward and\nbackward along the entire sequence of cultural expressions.\nIt is ephemeral because it changes, bends, and takes the\nshape demanded by the context it finds itself in. In this case,\nthe main change is the disappearance of linear sequentiality.\nIt is in this sense that we have to interpret the passage from a\nlinear alphabetic culture linked to the flow of letters that\nmake words and to single events that make situations and\nhistory to a culture based on the multisequentiality of images,\nwith a \"timeless time,\" both eternal and discontinuous. The\nperspective in which Castells moves is called informational-\nism. It is the idea of the Web as a world capable of guarantee-\ning the connection and the communication between users\ngeographically distant from one another and of becoming the\nmost important resource from the economical and political\npoint of view. Using the flows. The author can therefore\naffirm that timeless time belongs to the space of flows,\nbecause in the movement of the Web, the sequentiality of\nevents is altered.\nSpaces, Places, and Social Situations\nBeyond the Sense of a Place\nThe action is performed by an actor/element situated in a\nspace that makes it come to being in a time that goes from t0\nto t1. This is how we could make explicit the sense of what\nshould be considered as an action and, consequently, as a\n\"situation\" in linear time. It matches what Newton (1965)\nenunciates in his Philosophiae Naturales Principia\nMathematica. Yet, as we have here already affirmed, this\nconception falls to pieces as soon as we consider Einstein\nand his theory of relativity. It falls to pieces also when we\nconsider the presence of the media. Milestone of this change\nis Meyrowitz's (1985) No Sense of Place. The author, study-\ning in-depth the concepts of social interaction, of place, and\nof scene and back-scene presented by E. Goffman (1959),\nintroduces us to the idea that \"the nature of interaction is not\n4 SAGE Open\ndetermined by the physical environment as such, but by\ntranslation, 1995). In fact, Meyrowitz argues that a place\nsuch as a room has a social meaning because the walls and\nthe doors bring to the inclusion and the exclusion of the\nparticipants, defining a space of action. Hence, it is the case\nto ask oneself if \"behavioral environments have to be neces-\nsarily places. In other words, is the place really so important\nfor the behavior or is there something else, traditionally\nassociated to the place and for this reason confused with it?\"\nanswer is the \"informative flow,\" the knowledge, and the\ninterpretation of the action and of the social situation that\nexists in a certain environment. The example proposed is\nthat of some waiters who move between the lounge, where\nthey serve the clients (the scene), and the kitchen (the back-\nscene), where they get ready to serve the tables. But if the\nlounge is empty because the restaurant is still closed, the\nspace of the \"scene\" can be used to perform \"back-scene\"\nactivities. Likewise, if a regular client goes beyond the\ndoors, which separate the lounge from the kitchen, also the\nkitchen can become part of the scene. It is clear that what\nchanges when you are in a place is the different flow of\ninformation that you possess according to the situation you\nare in. The social situation is characterized by an \"informa-\ntive system,\" that is, by a certain model of access to informa-\ntion concerning the behavior of other people. Considering\nthe situation as an informative system allows you to estab-\nlish a continuum between a \"face to face\" situation and a\nsituation mediated by communication systems. Media mod-\nify the border between the scene and the back-scene, no\nlonger drawing it using a physical dimension, but with an\ninformative one instead. Think about when you receive a\ncall on your mobile and someone asks you, \"Where are you?\nAm I disturbing? Can we talk? Are you alone?\" All these\nquestions are necessary to define the social situation. This\nway you can sense if it is possible to ask certain kinds of\nquestions, how the interlocutor will filter his or her answers,\nhow much time he or she will be able to dedicate to the call\nand the topics of discussions, and what else could attract his\nor her attention. The introduction and the diffusion on a large\nscale of new means of communication restructure many\nsocial situations and require new social behaviors. But there is\na \"dark side\" to this declination in a large scale of situations\nand also to the creation of landscapes in which you are\ninserted.TheyaretackledbyA.Appadurai(1996)inModernity\nat Large, where he defines ethnoscapes as \"scapes of group\nidentities.\" He explains that this neologism contains a wanted\nambiguity. It refers first of all to the dilemmas of perspective\nand representation all ethnographers have to face, and he\nadmits that (as for the landscapes of the visual arts) the tra-\nditional perceptions and perspectives, together with the\nvariations in the situations of the observer, can influence the\nprocess and the result of the representation (Appadurai,\nhave a fluid and irregular shape for they are the consequence\nof global interactions, stretched between cultural homogeni-\nzation and heterogenization. What Appadurai (1996) sug-\ngests should be read as an acceptance of the consequences of\nthe exchange of information via the new technologies--in\nother words, the acceptance that the exchanged flows of\ninformation produce new scapes, such as the ethnoscapes,\nthe mediascapes, the technoscapes, the finanscapes, and the\nideoscapes. The mediascapes refer\nboth to the distribution of the electronic ability to pro-\nduce and spread information (newspapers, magazines,\nT.V. stations and motion picture production studios)\nwhich are available to an increasing number of centers\nof private and public interest all over the world, and to\nthe images of the world provided by these media.\nThe main function of mediascapes is to offer stories and\nimages in which are mixed the worlds of goods, politics, and\nnews. The effect on the public or, better, on the users is to\nreduce the distance between fictional and realistic worlds.\nThe negative consequence underlined by Appadurai (1996)\nin this excess of symbolic media production is that the more\nthe public is distant from experiencing directly what is nar-\nrated, the more it will build imaginary and chimeric worlds,\nbasing itself on what is produced by the media. And this will\nbe its reality.\nThe Space of Flows\nIn recent years, the diffusion of the Internet modified and\nwidened the way, the space, and the time of communication.\nThe space of flows (Castells, 1996) is known to be \"a time\nout of time and a space out of space,\" a web with more inclu-\nsion and exclusion than in McLuhan's (1962) \"global vil-\nlage.\" The concept of an active space in the geographical\nstructure of the Web is not defined by the physical distance\nbetween two points of the Web itself, but it must be con-\nnected to the notion of \"place\" specifically of the Web.\nCastells (1996) suggests that it is space to organize time and\nnot vice versa. He stresses the strength of the space of flows\ntoward the space of places, going beyond what is expressed\nby Newton: A place is the part of space occupied by a body.\nHere, the place can be an environment of communicative\nvicinity and exchange. According to Castells, there are flows\nof capital, information, technology, organizational interactions,\nimages, sounds, or symbols--everything that can \"move\"\nfrom one node to another using the technological support.\nInformation being the predominant resource also from the\neconomic point of view, the flows become an expression of\nthe processes that control the economic, political, and sym-\nbolic life. If in social theory, space is the material support\nof the social practices of time sharing (Castells, 1996, p.\nLa Rocca 5\nmaterial support of the main processes will be the elements\nthat support the flows.\nThe space of flows is the material organization of the\nsocial practices of time sharing which operate through\nflows. By flows I intend sequences of exchange and of\ntargeted, repetitive and programmed interactions\nbetween physically separated positions occupied by\nsocial actors in the economical, political and symboli-\ncal structures of society. (p. 473)\nThe places that make up the territories of the Web are\nelectronic mail, mailing lists, newsgroups, forums, Internet\nreal chats (IRC), Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) or Muds\nObject Oriented (MOO), but also massively multiplayer\nonline role-playing games (MMORPG) and social network\nsites. The connection of users thanks to these instruments of\ncommunication creates forms of community relationships\nthat are different from the relational networks with weak and\nhidden borders (Dell'Aquila, 1999) and in which prevails a\n\"hybrid\" kind of language. Dell'Aquila emphasizes how the\nbirth of virtual communities takes place in the presence of a\ncommon Lebenswelt (world of life) that pushes who is alone\nto enter a community. This is little to do with T\u00f6nnies's\nGemeinschaft because it has the characteristics of a social\nunity--more or less locally extended--where shared themes\nare discussed (Giuliano, 1999). Mailing lists, newsgroups,\nsocial networks, and chats become privileged places where it\nis possible to monitor the development of the themes, of the\nadopted modalities of communication, and of the tools them-\nselves, considered as agor\u00e0 and milieu innovative.\nPrinciples and Consequences\nof the Digital\nThe Digital Paradigm\nThe phonetic alphabet favors the linearity of language and\nthought projecting us toward a linear time and space. The\ndigital paradigm characterized by the principles of nonse-\nquentiality, of probability, and of variability (Manovich,\n2001) brings us to the perception and the structuring of a\nmultidimensional space and thought. The three main princi-\nples of the digital paradigm provide us with a reading/\nwriting space that is different from that of the alphabet and\nof visual culture. There is a step from a \"mythical thought\"\nin which things have sense because they are brought back to\none and only one context to an \"alphabetical thought\" and at\nlast to \"digital thought,\" which introduces us into an inter-\nsubjective context deriving from a new auditive and visual\nculture to be found in a nonsequential textual dimension (de\nKerckhove, 2001). The nonsequentiality exists both in the\nwriting phase and in the text fruition phase on the Web. In\naddition, the possibility to choose one connection instead of\nanother favors the indeterminacy of the structure of a\n\"story.\" All this pushes us to summarize the variability of the\nnarration typical of the new media as the sum of the relation-\nships that can be created between the objects (Guidolin,\nacceleration in the relationship between culture and com-\nmunication, offering new perspectives to the art of writing,\nthe structure of texts, and the perception of events. The new\ncommunicative modalities have a lot in common with oral\ncommunication. Although this belongs to the past, we can\nnow paradoxically find some of its modalities in technologi-\ncal settings: the immersion of the reader/user in the context,\nhis or her ability to be \"trained\" by it and to interact with the\ntext by changing it, and his or her willingness to accept new\nexperiences.\nHypertexts as articulations. Hypertexts derive from numer-\nous literary, philosophical, and technological influences,\nwhich may seem unconnected, but which have in reality col-\nlaborated to the realization of a new software system linked\nto a conceptual and psychological environment: virtuality\n(La Rocca, 2006). The oxymorons--Derrida, the hyper-\ntextual, and Nelson, the poststructuralist--were coined by\nLandow (1994) to indicate how two disciplines, philosophy\nand computer science, apparently so distant from one\nanother, can have in some way worked together to create a\ndigital-conceptual structure capable of originating a nonse-\nquential way of writing and an active way of reading. Two\ncultures face the future of writing, two approaches give\nhypertexts a structure: The labyrinth is not only a net of links\nbut also a mythological image. T. Nelson (1990) notes how\ntechnological culture and humanistic culture have not estab-\nlished any form of dialogue on common themes. Technolo-\ngists are interested in the rational logic of their proceedings,\nand they condemn the humanists who usually discuss the\nproblems and themes considered idealistically.\nFor the Humanists the World is history, art, literature\nand the little corner is occupied by \"technical things\".\nFor the technologists the World are the great ideas\nand the Technical Issues, while the little corner is\noccupied by old-fashioned things of a pre-technolog-\nObviously, Nelson has a different opinion. He believes\nthat both parties live in a \"little corner\" and because of their\nclosed mentalities, they both do not understand that the\nobjectives of the editorial systems of the future are those of\ncivilization itself and that technological tools are necessary\nfor these objectives to be reached. \"System Humanists\" are\nin Nelson's opinion those who believe in this possible union.\nThe conceptual link, identified later by Nelson and Derrida, is\nthe Eldorado of the System Humanists. Derrida is a post-\nstructuralist philosopher born in 1930; The affinity with the\nsystems of hypertext writing can be found in some works of\nthe French philosopher, such as Of Grammatology (Derrida,\n6 SAGE Open\nisthelanguageexperience,whichcanbesuchonlyifexpressed\nin writing. The written text becomes a brand, an epiphany, a\ntangible sign of a word. In Dissemination, in the part dedi-\ncated to Plato's Pharmacy, he writes, as follows:\nBut what does absent or present mean here? As every\ntext, Plato's could but be connected in a virtual, lateral\ndynamic way to all the words which make up the Greek\nlanguage system. Associations unite at a distance and in\ndifferent ways, the words \"effectively present\" in a\nspeech to other words effectively present in a lexical\nThis passage taken from Landow (1994) underlines how\nthe hypertext writing system is present, even if not in a bla-\ntant way, in Derrida's analysis. Recalling our attention to\nsome of the words present in the aforementioned text, such\nas virtual, dynamic, lateral, associations, and different ways,\nwe can identify the elements of hypertextual surfing and the\ncreation of an active way of reading. The textual implica-\ntions of the development of a semantic space seem to be\nclear also to Nelson and to T. Berners-Lee (1999), although\nthe latter is more interested in the technological aspects than\nin the literary ones connected to the development of a virtual\nenvironment. Nelson affirms that there are some difficulties\nin the sequential writing of a text. These lie in the necessity\nfor the author to make a choice among the arguments to pres-\nent, which at the same time implies a process of inclusion\nand exclusion of both words and concepts. Using a hyper-\ntext, these difficulties are eliminated because the choice\nmoves from the sequences to present to the connective struc-\nture of the elements to articulate. It is no longer necessary to\ndecide what to insert and what to exclude; what is needed is\nto identify \"where one can fix things in an explorable laby-\nlimits of traditional writing were also noticed by Calvino\n(1973), who broke it up in Il castello dei destini incrociati.\nThe work consists of some short stories, narrated using a\npack of tarot cards. The position of the cards of the first\nplayer is the link to jump spontaneously to the story of the\nfollowing character. It is not necessary to mix the cards again\nor to choose new ones: It is their position to suggest the new\nstory to tell. The combination of the different cards resem-\nbles the structure of the hypertext with its links: Hypertexts\nallow us to zig zag between words and concepts. Using links,\nit is possible to go from one page or paragraph to another.\nThe indication of the presence of a connection is given by an\nactive word. The reader can therefore jump from one page to\nanother activating various links, and this process is called\nhypertext surfing. The technological stimulus to create a\nhypertext as we know it today came from Berners-Lee\n(1999). It is important to consider that the structure of a text\nwritten with multimedia support has a sequentiality and an\nimpact that have to be distinguished from the linearity of a\ntraditional printed text. A written text has a spatial structure,\nwhich implies also a temporal structure: According to Bolter\n(2001), a written text can, in fact, be compared with an orches-\ntral score with its visual representation of the notes on the staff\nand its verticality, in the same way of the musician who is able\nto read the notes in the spaces without the need to play them.\nThe complete reading of a text, therefore, involves both a spa-\ntranslation, 2002). \"Reading is to follow a path among those\nsuggested by the distribution of the text\" (p. 135).\nTwo cultures tackle the future of writing; two approaches\ngive a structure to the hypertext net. The labyrinth is not only\na reticulate of links, but also a mythological image.According\nto some theoretics, ours is the \"civilization of image\"; accord-\ning to others, it is the \"civilization of writing\"; according to\nothers again, our world is a \"global village\" or the return to a\nsecond level oral civilization made possible by the electronic\ntechnologies. Indeed, in the experience of gaining access to\nthe Web or in the knowledge favored by the new electronic\npublishing systems, as well as in that which comes from the\nglobalization of information, we can find the same elements\nof simultaneity of oral communication, although they all\nmake use of hypertextuality. There seems to be the possibility\nto talk with somebody about a certain topic and to inform him\nor her also about the connections that come before the narra-\ntion or the going into the matters more thoroughly.\nThe Consequences on Experience\nA first reorganization of the forms of experience is due to the\ndevelopment of modern society: The increase of knowledge\nand the possibility to communicate events \"distant\" from\nour daily lives have determined what J. B. Thompson\n(1995) calls a release from sequestration of experience.\nSuch release from sequestration is carried out by the press,\nbut also by the radio and the television, which have the capa-\nbility of clearly transmitting news geographically distant\nfrom those who receive them. Thompson calls this kind of\nexperience \"mediated experience\" to distinguish it from the\nlived experience of W. Dilthey's (1924) Erlebnis. The char-\nacteristics attributed to the latter are immediacy, the being\ncontinuous and, to a certain extent, instinctive, but it is also\nthe \"experience we have in the practical contexts of daily\nThis experience is the result of the activities and the encoun-\nters we have everyday, and in this sense, it is different from\nthe one determined by media interactions, which expanding\nin space and time allow an intimacy with other people who\ndo not share the same spatial\u00adtemporal environment and are\ntherefore \"distant\" (p. 305). Thompson indicates four sub-\nstantial differences between mediated and lived experience.\nFirst of all, mediated experiences are those that take place\nin situations distant from daily life. Then they are contextu-\nalized differently, in the sense that people gain access to\nthem in places that are different from those where they are\nLa Rocca 7\nhappening. A third element that distinguishes a mediated\nexperience from a lived one comprises the priorities it is\ncharacterized by. With this, the author means to say that if\nthe self is like a symbolic project that the individual\nmodels and re-models during his/her life, we must\nthen admit that such project presupposes a scale of the\nmost important things, which can also be continuously\nmodified: This scale decides the relevance or irrele-\nvance of the real and potential experiences. This struc-\nture of priorities is an integral part of our project of\nThe structure of the priorities attributed to mediated expe-\nriences is different and from certain points of view inferior to\nthe one attributed to lived experiences because, in the first\ncase, also when certain appointments become a routine, the\nrelationship that the self establishes with them remains weak.\nThe fourth element considered is called \"de-spatialized com-\nmonality.\" This is necessary to stress the difference in the\nproximity of the sharing of the experience. In fact, in the case\nof a lived experience, the place in which this takes place is\nthe same for all the actors who are experiencing it; this does\nnot happen in the case of mediated experiences because\nthese permit the actors to live the same experiences even\nthough they are not sharing a similar life environment. At the\nend of this analysis, Thompson then asks himself what hap-\npens to the self in a world in which mediated experience\nplays such a deep role in the life of people and in which the\nself is liberated from its ties with the practical contexts of\ndaily life. Here, we affirm instead that the need to make medi-\nated experience daily and therefore close to us in its context,\ntime, and place has as a consequence that people--or some\npeople--look for it as a media-lived experience. The new\nmeans of communication allow us to have what we describe\nhere as \"media lived experiences.\" They can be connected to\nDilthey's experience because they are inserted in the tempo-\nral flow of daily life, but also to the media. The media allow\nthat experience can be, one, \"mediated\" because it is known\nthrough the media and, other, \"mediatic\" because the indi-\nvidual has the opportunity to live the experience entering the\nmedium.\nThe Consequences onThought\nLet us start from the end, reading what Carr (2010) writes at\nthe end of his book: \"An intellectual technology exercises its\ninfluence changing the focus of our thought.\" We are nearly\nat the end of a book when the author himself admits that he\nhad to disconnect from the Web to see light and this because\nthe Internet changes our capability of \"working on a piece\"\nfor a long time.\nThe consequences of the Internet on our cognitive modali-\nties can be enclosed in that short statement: The Internet is an\nintellectual technology, and like all intellectual technologies,\nit widens and strengthens our mental capabilities and it\nrequires an exploration modality that is different from that of\nother technologies; with time and in time the way in which\ninformation is structured inside itself changes (as a conse-\nquence) our \"way\" of organizing and storing information.\nWe cannot look to the Internet as a lived experience distinct\nfrom the rest of life; Haythornthwaite and Wellman (2002)\nsuggest that we think of the Internet as \"embedded in every-\nday life.\"\nIn time, there have been various intellectual technologies.\nCarr mentions the map and the mechanical clock--the map\nas an example of the change in the representation of space\nand the mechanical clock, instead, as the emblem of how\ntime and natural and social organisms have been represented.\nWhen the map and the clock became of common use, they\nchanged our language, sense of abstraction, and thought.\nGod became this way the Great Clockmaker. His cre-\nation was no longer a mystery to accept. It had become\na problem to resolve. Descartes wrote in 1646: \"Without\ndoubt, when the swallows arrive in Spring, they\nbehave like clocks.\" (Carr, 2010; Italian translation,\nThe Internet and its surfing require forms of extremely\nintense mental multitasking. This is because the multisequen-\ntiality and the surfing routes allow us to jump from one page\nto another, from one information to another very quickly,\ngenerating the anxiety to obtain \"new\" information. We are\npushed to search and search, reflecting little on what we have\njust found. It is a sort of \"liquid\" information, following\nwhich we move from one page to another. This exercise has\nits cost of commutation, which Carr explains presenting the\ndifferent studies carried out by psychologists, eye specialists,\nand neuropsychiatrists. Recalling what M. Jackson (2008)\nwrites in Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming\nDark Age, we can say that in Internet multitasking, surfing\nthe brain takes time to pass from one page to another, having\nto reset its objectives very quickly and to remember the rules\nrequired to perform one task and then another. This multi-\ntasking activity allows us to acquire a capability of reorga-\nnizing our research activities very quickly, but we lose the\ndepth of thought. We are often interrupted while we are per-\nforming an activity on the Web, but we often want to be\ninterrupted because we know that every interruption carries\nwith itself some precious information, because the Web is\nable to monitor events, to update, and, therefore, to tell us\neverything that we need to know. The consequence is that the\nWeb encourages us to face a wide range of topics, but at a\n\"superficial\" level.\nThe episode of Vittorio Alfieri's life, in which wishing to\nlearn Latin, he ties himself to a chair until he learns it, is well\nknown. From this experience derives the famous sentence:\nVolli, sempre volli, fortissimamente volli esser poeta e lo fui\n(I wanted, I always wanted, I very strongly wanted to be a\n8 SAGE Open\npoet and I was one). This is an approach to knowledge that\nexcludes any form of distraction to be able to learn in-depth.\nToday,Alfieri would have probably simply looked for a good\nsearch engine for translation and linguistic adaptation to\ntranslate in Latin his works written in volgare--and this,\nwhile he kept simultaneously open his Facebook pages, his\nelectronic mail, and a few online newspapers. He probably\nwould have never felt the need to learn Latin. But we should\nalso ask ourselves, \"Would he today have written anything\nwithout his computer and without an Internet connection?\"\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAppadurai, A.
