    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe No Child Left Behind legislation was signed into law to ensure children in the United States receive quality education\nand learn the skills needed to be successful. Career and technical education (CTE) is not mentioned in the legislation, which\nsuggests that more CTE courses may be dropped from high school master schedules, which makes the topic a concern for\neducational leaders.The purpose of this study was to investigate the academic performance of CTE completers and non-CTE\ncompleters in the Commonwealth of Virginia on the standards of learning English reading and mathematics assessments as\nwell as cohort graduation rates. Findings indicate that statistically (p < .05), CTE completers had higher mathematics and\nGrade 11 English reading pass rates as well as higher cohort graduation rates than those of non-CTE completers.\n",

With the increasing pressures to improve educa-\ntional programs, states have implemented standards and per-\nformance assessments (high-stakes tests) to measure student\nachievement, including increased graduation requirements.\nHigh-stakes testing systems generate scores with important\nconsequences to schools and school personnel, which are\nalso applied to students in the form of graduation require-\nments or remedial courses (Austin & Mahlman, 2002).\nThe No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation changed the\nface of the standards movement and the measure of student\nachievement. The purpose of the NCLB legislation was to\nensure that all students have an opportunity to obtain a high-\nquality education and increase students' academic achieve-\nment (Gordon, Yocke, Maldonado, & Saddler, 2007). There\nare growing concerns among career and technical education\n(CTE) leaders based on the fact that no program area of CTE\n(agriculture, business and computers, marketing, family and\nconsumer sciences, health occupations, or technology-trade\nand industry education) is specifically mentioned in the NCLB\nlegislation, and there could be a significant impact on CTE\nprograms in the future (Martin, Fritzsche, & Ball, 2006).\nCTE courses are an integral part of most comprehensive\nhigh schools in Virginia; thus, if these courses are reduced,\nmany high school students will not have the opportunity\nfor a comprehensive high school experience or gain expo-\nsure to specialized training and work skills. Elective courses\nprovide students with educational alternatives to reinforce\nreading, mathematics, and science skills that are highly\nvalued in the state assessments. Students succeed in schools\ndue to a number of factors, and a sound CTE program is one\nStatement of the Problem\nAs CTE establishes and maintains itself as a viable compo-\nnent of the comprehensive school program, there is a need to\ndetermine how students who have completed a CTE concen-\ntration of sequenced courses perform on the state-mandated\nhigh-stakes Virginia standards of learning (SOL) tests. CTE\ncourses will continue to lose enrollment and be removed\nfrom high school course offerings unless educational leaders\ncan clearly demonstrate how these programs (a) contribute\nto the academic success of students as measured by state\nacademic tests and (b) serve as motivation for students to\nstay in school and perform better in academic courses\n(Daggett, 2009). All CTE courses in Virginia have been cor-\nrelated to the core content area SOL; thus, the curriculum for\nthese courses covers some of the same content as the core\ncourses with a practical and contextual application. In 2000,\nthe Virginia Department of Education's (VDOE) Career and\nTechnical Education Department developed crosswalks\n(correlations) to the SOLs in the four content areas.

Through an evaluation of CTE students'\nperformance on Virginia's SOL assessments in English read-\ning, mathematics, as well as graduation rates, educational\nleaders would gain information about the performance\nof CTE students as it relates to academic performance on\nthe state-mandated SOL tests. In this time of school\naccountability, a study on the impact of CTE on academic\nachievement in the Commonwealth of Virginia is due to be\ninvestigated.\nSignificance of the Study\nResearchers note that there is a scarcity of research on the\nimpact of high-stakes testing and NCLB on CTE (Gordon et\nal., 2007). Federal legislation has regulated CTE since its\ninception and continues to mandate the operation of the\nprograms. Thus, there is documentation available in reference\nto the specifics of the Carl Perkins legislation and the\nrequirements of the grant that funds secondary and postsec-\nondary CTE programs. However, few state studies have\nbeen conducted to evaluate the impact of the requirements\nof federal-mandated testing of NCLB on CTE programs\nLiterature Review\nEven though CTE courses use contextual learning and\nreal-world application, the courses are typically offered as\nelectives, and because CTE is not mentioned in the NCLB\nlegislation, it may be difficult for policy makers, educators,\nand teachers to see how CTE courses contribute to achieving\nthe goals of the legislation. Policy makers and educators\nhave generally acknowledged the value of the practical skills\ntaught in CTE courses, but they rarely receive the status or\nimportance attributed to academic skills and knowledge\nlearned in CTE courses. The literature acknowledges that\nCTE provides students with practical occupational experi-\nences that help students to see the relevance of school, but\nas the demands of NCLB continue to increase, educators are\nmaking decisions to enforce more instructional time in core\ncontent courses. The reviewed literature indicates that a\n\"narrowing curriculum\" has evolved as a result of increased\naccountability requirements (Amrein & Berliner, 2002;\nDavis, 2006). As a result, CTE is in a position that it must\ndemonstrate its contribution to student achievement.\nBased on the contextual approach used in CTE courses,\nstudent achievement and learning are improved (Glenn, 2005).\nIn addition, there is an increased emphasis on incorporating\ncore academic skills into CTE. As a result of the Carl D.\nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006,\nmany states have closely aligned their CTE competencies\nwith state academic standards, which resulted in case study\nresults that demonstrate isolated successes. The literature\nreviewed has yielded mixed results regarding the impact of\nCTE on student achievement and graduation rates. Studies\nreviewed indicate that CTE student achievement may not\nsurpass that of their non-CTE counterparts, but there has been\nan increase in their academic performance and course-taking\npatterns. Investigating the historical perspective of CTE\nand how it has evolved to meet the needs and demands\nof changing educational reforms, including the current legis-\nlation of NCLB and high-stakes testing, is important to this\nstudy. The literature indicates that there is a need for CTE to\ncontinually demonstrate its contributions to the accountability\nbenchmarks set forth in NCLB to avoid narrowing the\ncurriculum.\nMethod\nAfter reviewing the literature regarding narrowing the cur-\nriculum and CTE student achievement, it was determined\nthat examining CTE student achievement and graduation\nrates in Virginia was worthy of investigation. The purpose of\nthis study was to investigate the academic performance of\nCTE completers and non-CTE completers in the\nCommonwealth of Virginia on the SOL Grade 11 English\nreading and mathematics assessments as well as cohort\ngraduation rates. Evaluation of SOL pass rates in English\nreading and mathematics as well as graduation rates pro-\nvided data regarding the performance of CTE completers as\ncompared with non-CTE completers. The research questions\nthat guided this study were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What is the difference, if any,\nbetween high school CTE enrollment status (CTE\ncompleter vs. non-CTE completer) and student\nBlowe and Price 3\nachievement as measured by Grade 11 English\nreading SOL pass rates?\nResearch Question 2: What is the difference, if any,\nbetween high school CTE enrollment status (CTE\ncompleter vs. non-CTE completer) and student\nachievement as measured by SOL mathematics\npass rates of the highest level of mathematics com-\npleted (Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry)?\nResearch Question 3: What is the difference, if\nany, between high school CTE enrollment status\n(CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer) and the\ngraduation rates of students?\nThis study used a quantitative evaluation methodology to\ndetermine the difference between CTE concentrators and\nnonconcentrators with regard to academic achievement and\ngraduation rates of high school students. According to Miller\nand Salkind (2002), evaluation research involves assessing\nthe strengths and weakness of a program to evaluate effec-\ntiveness or merit. In this study, the \"program\" is CTE, and\nthe value or \"merit\" is the impact of CTE concentration on\nstudent achievement. As indicated in the literature review,\nthere is a narrowing of the curriculum that has caused\nschools to reduce the number of electives offered or to\nreduce the instructional time provided for noncontent elec-\ntives to meet state-mandated test requirements. Thus,\nresearch provides data to support the fact that elective\ninstruction, as it relates to CTE, would assist educators in\nmaking decisions for their schools regarding these courses.\nPopulation\nThe population for this study was the 131 school divisions\nin the Commonwealth of Virginia. Data submitted to the\nVDOE by each school division served as the database for\nthis study. CTE and divisional data for this study are public\ndomain regarding CTE completers' English reading and\nmathematics SOL pass rates and graduation rates as a result\nof information submitted to the VDOE annually.\nData Collection\nwith regard to SOL student performance as well as gradu-\nation data for the same years were used for evaluation. For\nthe purposes of this study, student achievement was mea-\nsured by Grade 11 English reading and mathematics SOL\npass rates. The mathematics data were based on the highest\nlevel taken during the adequate yearly progress reporting\nyear. Data used for this study were gathered from the\nVDOE Office of Educational Information Management\nand the VDOE websites. Three VDOE website reports pro-\nvided much of the data necessary for this study:\n1. CTE Annual Performance Report (by school divi-\nsion),\n2. VDOE School Division Report Card and Virginia\nAssessment Results, and\n3. VDOE High School Graduates and Completion\nreport.\nStudent achievement in Virginia is measured by the SOL\nassessments, and they serve as the high-stakes assessment\nthat determines student graduation and school accreditation.\nHigh school students are expected to pass a minimum of two\nEnglish, one mathematics, one science, one social studies,\nand one student-selected end-of-course assessment to gradu-\nate from a Virginia high school. Data on school division\nreport cards include student achievement based on the grade\nlevel of the students in the division and end-of-course\nassessment results. By definition in the Commonwealth of\nVirginia, a CTE \"completer\" is a student who has met the\nCTE's two sequential elective concentration of courses\nand all requirements for high school graduation (VDOE,\nEnglish reading and mathematics (highest level) SOL results\nfor the reported completers and non-CTE completers during\nthe identified school years to provide a conventional com-\nparison. Groups were compared based on their high-stakes\ntest scores over 3 years.\nLast, the High School Graduates and Completion report\ncollects data on an annual basis during the fall, following\nstudents' completion year. Each locality submits data for\ntheir schools for the combined regular and summer terms.\nThe data are then compiled, and division and state totals are\ncalculated (VDOE, 2010). This report provides graduation\nnumbers for each of the 131 school divisions in the\nCommonwealth of Virginia. Data collected on the cohort\nused for this study.\nResearch Design\nAccording to Cohen, Manion, Morrison, and Morrison\n(2007), ex post facto research is also called causal-comparative\nresearch. In ex post facto research, there is an attempt to relate\nan after-the-fact treatment that cannot be manipulated by the\ninvestigator to an outcome or dependent measure. The spe-\ncific type of ex post facto research design that was used in this\nstudy is criterion group. The \"phenomenon\" or \"variable\" in\nthis study is CTE concentration. The dependent variables are\nstudent achievement and graduation rates.\nThe data for the school divisions were divided into two\ncategories: CTE completers and non-CTE completers. CTE\ncompleters are students who have met the requirements for a\nCTE concentration and all requirements for high school\ngraduation or an approved alternative education program.\n4 SAGE Open\nCompleters have passed at least 80% of the program compe-\ntencies in an approved CTE concentration sequence or set of\nsequential electives. Non-CTE completers are students who\nhave not completed an approved CTE concentration.\nThe independent variable group was categorized as CTE\ncompleters and non-CTE completers. The CTE \"completer\"\nachievement data were obtained from the CTE Performance\nreports for each school division. For the purposes of this\nstudy, the Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rates were used\nfor student achievement in English, and the mathematics SOL\ndata were based on students attaining a passing score on high-\nest level of mathematics end-of-course test as reported by the\nVDOE. The graduation data were derived from the VDOE\nGraduation and Completion report, and the CTE Performance\nreports for each of the school divisions. These dependent\nvariable data, student achievement and graduation rates, were\ndownloaded from VDOE to an Excel spreadsheet for analy-\nData Collection Procedures\nThe various data collected for this study were based on the\nresearch questions. Information from the VDOE State\nDivision report cards,VDOE Career andTechnical Education\nPerformance reports, and the VDOE Graduation and\nCompletion report are submitted annually to the\nCommonwealth. The data were analyzed using statistical\nmeasures to determine the differences in the performance of\neach of the identified groups--CTE completers and non-\nCTE completers. A spreadsheet was developed to organize\nthe collected data for further analysis.\nData Analysis\nIn analyzing data for this quantitative study, Microsoft\nExcel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\n(SPSS) were used to do the statistical calculations. Statistics\nwere generated for SOL English reading, SOL mathemat-\nics, and graduation rates for CTE completers and non-CTE\ncompleters for each school division in the Commonwealth\nof Virginia. Longitudinal data for 3 years were compared\nto assess whether CTE concentration affects student\nachievement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statis-\ntics, including frequencies, means, and standard devia-\ntions. The descriptive statistics were used to describe what\nwas occurring in the data. The numbers of CTE completers\nand non-CTE completers as well as the corresponding\ndependent variables for each category were calculated.\nTotal CTE completer students by school division were\nmarked as such with codes, as were the students who had\nnot completed an approved concentration sequence.\nA t-test analysis was used to assess whether the means of\nthe two sample groups (CTE completers vs. non-CTE com-\npleters) were statistically different from each other. To test\nthe level of significance, an alpha level of .05 was used to\ndetermine whether there was a significant difference in the\nmeans of the two groups. Permission to conduct the study\nwas requested and approved from the Virginia Polytechnic\nInstitute and State University's Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nstudents who participated in CTE to the level of being con-\nsidered CTE completers. CTE completers are students who\nhave taken two sequential CTE electives in a prescribed\nprogram area with 80% proficiency in the competencies\nrequired for the courses.\nFor the purposes of this study, the reading data were\nbased on the end-of-course Grade 11 English reading SOL\nassessment. The mathematics data were based on the math-\nematics course for which a SOL assessment is required. The\nSOL assessments are given in the spring of each school\nyear. All students enrolled in end-of-year courses (EOC)\ntake the associated EOC SOL test. In each of the years of\nthis study, CTE completer pass rates outperformed those of\nthe rest of the students on the reading SOL by at least 3%\npoints. In the area of mathematics during the years of 2009\npoints higher than the rest of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nwhere the CTE completer mathematics pass rate was lower\nthan the pass rate of the state. During the year of 2008, the\nstate pass rate on the Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry\nSOL was 91%, whereas the performance of CTE completers\nfor that same year was only 84%.\nResearch Question 1--Results\nWhat is the difference, if any, between high school CTE\nenrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)\nand student achievement as measured by SOL mathematics\npass rates of the highest level of mathematics completed\n(Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry)?\nA breakdown of school divisions by mathematics SOL\npass rate categories was organized to illustrate the number\nof school divisions by CTE enrollment status that fell within\nhad a CTE pass rate in mathematics below 82%. However,\nthe following 2 school years, more than 120 school divi-\nsions had CTE pass rates in mathematics above 95%. In the\ncategory of non-CTE completers, an average of 22 school\ndivisions had mathematics pass rates above 95%.\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for the CTE com-\npleters and non-CTE completers for the years of the study.\nUsing the rescaled student population numbers, the data were\nimported into SPSS for analysis. The mean mathematics SOL\nstandard deviation of 5.14, and CTE completers had a mean\nBlowe and Price 5\nhad mean pass rates of 97.86 with a standard deviation of\nNon-CTE completers for the same school years had mean\nmathematics pass rate was among the CTE completers in\nOn further analysis of the data, an examination of stan-\ndardized coefficients of skewness and kurtosis was conducted\nto determine the normality of the distribution. The coefficient\nof skewness provided information regarding the degree of\ndeparture of the data from that of a normal distribution. The\nskewness of the distribution of data must be determined to\nevaluate whether the distribution is significantly skewed to\nthe left or right tail of the distribution. If the skewness is\nwithin the range of +3 or -3, then it is not seriously violated.\nThe coefficient of kurtosis provided information regarding\nthe peakness of the distribution or the concentration of data to\nthe center, the upper and lower ends, and the shoulder. A nor-\nmal distribution will have a kurtosis value of 0, with a range\nof normality of \u00b13. With 11 of the 12 skewness and kurtosis\nfactors beyond the range of \u00b13, it was determined that each of\nthe distributions depart from that of a normal curve for the\ndependent variable of mathematics SOL pass rates. A total of\n11 of the 12 coefficients calculated are beyond the range for a\nnormal distribution.\nAs the mathematics SOL pass rates for CTE completers\nand non-CTE completers were not normally distributed, a\nnonparametricstatisticalprocedurewasused.Nonparametric\nstatistics are used when the data do not fit in a normal\ndistribution. Nonparametric statistics are also referred to as\ndistribution free in that the statistical procedures are not\nassuming that the data fall within a normal distribution and\nreduce the influence of outliers on the statistic results.\nAccordingly, a Wilcoxon's t test was used to address\nthe research question. A Wilcoxon's t test is used to compare\ntwo related samples to assess whether their means differ.\nAWilcoxon's t test assumes that the data are not normally dis-\ntributed and that the data are ordinal in nature. The results\nindicate that there is a statistically significant difference (p <\n.05) in the performance of CTE completers on the mathemat-\nics SOLs, p < .001. Cohen's d effect size was also calculated\nto measure the strength of the difference between the vari-\nables. This statistic measures the overlap of the data of one\nsample group to that of the other. Based on Cohen's effect size\ncriteria, size of d  0.8 indicates the nonoverlap of the distribu-\ntions. In each of the years of the study, the effect size was\nd = 1.88) for the mathematics SOL passing rates. CTE com-\npleters had a statistically significant difference in their pass\nrates on the mathematics end-of-course SOL test as compared\nwith their non-CTE completer counterparts.\nResearch Question 2--Results\nWhat is the difference, if any, between high school CTE\nenrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)\nand student achievement as measured by Grade 11 English\nreading SOL pass rates?\nWhen considering the second research question, Grade\n11 English reading SOL pass rates were examined. School\ndivision pass rates were initially reviewed based on the fre-\nquency of school divisions in the pass rate bands. Nearly all\nof the CTE completer school division pass rates were at\n89% or above. Only one of the CTE completer school divi-\nsions in the 3 years of this study had a pass rate below 89%,\nwhereas non-CTE completer pass rates were on average\nevenly split above and below 89%.\nThe mean CTE completer pass rates for the 3 years\nexamined in this study were higher than non-CTE. The\nmean CTE completer pass rate for the English reading SOL\ncompleter pass rate was 97.99 with non-CTE completers\nhaving a mean pass rate of 89.16. Furthermore, the highest\nmean Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rate was among\nAn examination of the standardized skewness coefficient\nand the standardized kurtosis coefficient for the English\nreading SOL passing rates revealed that the distribution of\nthe data departs from that of a normal distribution. As the\nEnglish reading SOL scores of the CTE students were not\nnormally distributed, a Wilcoxon's t test was used to address\nthe second research question.\nFurther analysis of the Grade 11 English reading SOL\npass rates was used to determine whether there was a differ-\nence in students' performance on the assessment with\nregard to CTE enrollment status. The findings of the\nWilcoxon's t-test analysis conducted on the data indicated\nthat there was a significant difference in the performance of\nCTE completers to non-CTE completers (p < .001). The\nt test yielded a statistically significant result for each of the\nyears examined. This t-test statistic also represents that the\nlikelihood of this happening by chance is 5% or less. The\nacceptable level of significance for social sciences is .05;\nhowever, the significance level of .000 is well under the .05\nlevel and the more stringent .01. This analysis revealed a\nstatistically significant difference in the Grade 11 English\nreading SOL performance and pass rates of CTE com-\npleters than that of non-CTE completers.\nThe effect size associated with the difference in the Grade\n11 English reading SOL pass rates, Cohen's d, was calcu-\nlated on the data to illustrate the magnitude of the difference\nbetween the groups. In each instance, the Cohen's d effect\nabove 0.8 indicates a large effect size (d  0.8). The large\n6 SAGE Open\neffect size emphasizes the size of the difference in the mean\nEnglish reading SOL pass rates of the two groups in this\nstudy. Large effect size as defined by Cohen equates\nto \"grossly perceptible,\" and therefore corresponds to the\nfinding of CTE completers Grade 11 English reading SOL\npass rates above those of students who have not completed a\nprescribed set of CTE courses and are not considered CTE\ncompleters.\nResearch Question 3--Results\nWhat is the difference, if any, between high school CTE\nenrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)\nand the graduation rates of students?\nWhen evaluating the third research question, graduation\nrates were gathered for the groups evaluated in this study. The\ncohort graduation rates were included based on the graduation\nband in which the school divisions'performance dictates. The\nhighest mean graduation rate was among the CTE completers\nThis mean is notably higher than the mean graduation rate for\nnon-CTE completers in that same year of 85.50 with a stan-\ndard deviation of 7.66. The extreme difference in the mean\ngraduation rates may be an indication of the change in report-\ning of high school graduates in response to on-time graduation\nrates and the mandates of NCLB. Mean CTE completer grad-\nuation rates remained above 90% for the 3 years of the study,\nwhereas non-CTE completer cohort graduation rates were in\nCTE completer graduation rate (94.90), whereas the non-CTE\ncompleters in that same year had their highest cohort gradua-\ntion rates (88.88). Although the non-CTE completers had an\nincrease in their mean graduation rate, it was still nearly 10%\npoints below that of CTE completers.\nAn examination of the graduation rates of the participants\nof this study to that of a normal distribution remains consistent\nwith the findings for the previous two research questions. A\nreview of the histogram and the coefficients of skewness and\nkurtosis indicated that the data were not normally distributed.\nBecause the data for the graduation rates were not normally\ndistributed as proven by the coefficients of skewness and kur-\ntosis, the nonparametric statistic was used for these data as\nwell. The Wilcoxon's t test yielded a statistically significant\ndifference between CTE completers and non-CTE completers\nDelving deeper into the results of the Wilcoxon, the effect\nsize associated with the difference in the graduation pass\nrates was found to be large using Cohen's d criteria. The\ntrated the difference between the CTE completers and non-\nCTE completers based on graduation rates in standard\ndeviation units. Therefore, the distributions of the graduation\nrates for these groups do not extensively overlap. The results\nof the study are presented in three sections based on the guid-\ningresearchquestions.Thedependentvariablesfortheresearch\nquestions were Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rates,\nmathematics SOL pass rates (Algebra I, Algebra II, and\nGeometry), and graduation rates. The first structure analyzed\nin the section \"Research Question 1--Results\" was the student\nachievement of CTE completers and non-CTE completers\nbased on the pass rates for the highest mathematics SOL taken.\nThe t-test analysis revealed that there was a difference in the\nstudent achievement of students on mathematics SOLs based\non CTE enrollment status. This result was found to be true for\neach of the years of the study.\nThe second structure analyzed was the Grade 11 English\nreading pass rates for the populations in the study. The\ndescriptive statistics and t-test analysis revealed that there\nwas a significant difference in the student achievement of\nCTE completers and non-CTE completers on the Grade 11\nEnglish reading SOL. The academic achievement of this\ngroup of students proved consistent for the 3 years of the\nstudy with nearly all the CTE completer school divisions\nhaving pass rates above 90%.\nThe third section focused on the graduation rates of stu-\ndents based on CTE enrollment status. As with the Grade 11\nEnglish reading SOL pass rates for CTE completers, the\ngraduation rates for this group of students indicated that\nnearly 95% of the school divisions had CTE completer grad-\nuation rates above 90%. As the accountability requirements\nof NCLB continue to increase, these data will become\nincreasingly important to school divisions.\nEach of the sections outlines specific data regarding the\nresearch questions, data collection and rescaling proce-\ndures, relevant descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon's t test, and\neffect size for the dependent variables of this study. The data\nanalyzed and data tables representing each of the indepen-\ndent variable groups have been presented.\nFindings, Implications for Further\nStudy, and Reflections\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the academic\nperformance of CTE completers and non-CTE completers in\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL English and\nmathematics assessments as well as cohort graduation rates.\nThis study focused on the pass rates and graduation rates for\neach of the 131 schools divisions in the Commonwealth of\nVirginia based on data that were reported to the Department\nof Education. There were two independent variables in the\nstudy based on CTE concentration status. Participants of the\nstudy were categorized as CTE completers or non-CTE\ncompleters. The three dependent variables were the pass\nrates on the Grade 11 English reading SOL and the mathe-\nmatics SOL pass rates for which the students were enrolled.\nThe graduation rate data were based on the cohort informa-\ntion as reported to the VDOE.\nBlowe and Price 7\nOne of the intents of this study was to determine whether\nCTE is a viable program that can contribute to the academic\nproficiencies required for high-stakes testing, such as\nVirginia's SOL. Furthermore, this study is intended to be a\nmedium to provide quantifiable data to public school divi-\nsions when making decisions regarding curriculum and\nprogram evaluation in this era of accountability and NCLB.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the academic\nperformance of CTE completers and non-CTE completers\nin the Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL English reading\nand mathematics assessments as well as cohort graduation\nrates.\nDiscussion of Findings\nFirst, in the study populations, CTE completers earned\nhigher mean pass rates on the mathematics SOLs during the\ncompleters had a mean pass rate of 9% points higher than\nyears. These results suggest that CTE completers do outper-\nform their non-CTE counterparts on mathematics SOLs.\nSecond, the pass rate for CTE completers was higher than\nthat of the non-CTE completers on the Grade 11 English\nreading SOL. The mean reading SOL pass rates for CTE\ncompleters during the years of this study were 7% to 8%\npoints higher than that of the non-CTE completers. Third,\nCTE completers also attained mean high school cohort\ngraduation rates of 6% to 13% higher than non-CTE com-\npleters for the years of the study. Students in CTE courses\ngraduated with their cohort of classmates at an average\ngraduation rate of 96%, whereas the average non-CTE\ncohort graduation rate was 87% for the three academic\nyears of the study.\nImplications for Practice\nThe results of this study indicate that CTE affects student\nachievement and graduation rates. As school divisions make\ndecisions regarding cutting CTE programs, the results of this\nstudy should be reviewed as it concludes that students who\ncomplete a CTE sequence of courses demonstrate higher\nmathematics, reading, and graduation pass rates. Several\nimplications for practice were identified from the findings of\nthis study. The research indicates that there are mixed\nreviews regarding CTE's impact on student achievement and\ngraduation rates. These inconclusive studies served as the\nimpetus for this study in the Commonwealth of Virginia and\nthe desire of the researcher to investigate the performance of\nCTE completers in the state. Based on the implications\nbelow, educators should explore further the role of CTE in\nthe achievement of students.\nImplication 1. School administrators interested in increas-\ning mathematics and reading SOL performance should\nencourage more students to enroll in and complete CTE\nsequenced courses. For this study, CTE completers demon-\nstrated a statistically significant higher pass rate on the math-\nematics and Grade 11 English reading SOL than their\nnon-CTE counterparts. Therefore, school divisions and edu-\ncational leaders should encourage enrollment of students in\nCTE courses.\nImplication 2. School administrators interested in increas-\ning cohort graduation rates should encourage more students\nto enroll in and complete CTE sequenced courses. Based on\nthe results of this study, the CTE completer cohorts had an\naverage graduation rate of 95%, which was well above the\naverage for non-CTE completers during the same years.\nImplication 3. School administrators should encourage\nnon-CTE completers in CTE courses to complete a sequence\nof CTE courses and become completers. Increasing the num-\nber of non-CTE completers taking sequenced courses and\nbecoming completers would benefit school divisions and\nstudents. As evidenced by the pass rates of CTE completers,\nstudent participation in courses that are not included in the\nstate-mandated testing could prove to be as valuable for\nfuture plans as time spent preparing for the required aca-\nImplication 4. Career and technical educators should con-\ntinue to document and collect data on the performance\nof program completers to monitor CTE effectiveness. To\npromote CTE as a program viable in meeting benchmarks,\ndisaggregated data regarding specific program areas and\ncourse work should be investigated. In this time of narrow-\ning curriculum and data-driven decisions, CTE must con-\ntinue to collect, document, and promote CTE courses.\nImplication 5. School administrators should evaluate\ninstructional practices used in CTE courses for their merit\nand value with integrated instruction. Educators acknowledge\nthat students learn more when the work is connected to their\ninterests, to real-world problems, and the world of work and\ncollege.\nRecommendations for Further Research\nDaggett (2009) states that for CTE to establish and maintain\nitself as a viable component of the comprehensive school\nprogram, there is a need to determine how students who\nhave completed a CTE concentration of sequenced courses\nperform on state high-stakes tests. Therefore, the researchers\nrecommend that more quantitative studies are conducted to\ndetermine the impact of career of technical education on the\nacademic achievement and graduation rates of students.\nResearchers note that there are limited studies on the impact\nof CTE on NCLB and high-stakes testing. Thus, there is\nmuch more quantitative research that should be done.\nLittle information exists regarding the academic perfor-\nmance of CTE concentrators on high-stakes state assess-\nments. There are numerous national studies and anecdotal\ndata regarding CTE student performance, but given the\nincreased focus on NCLB benchmarks, the researchers\n8 SAGE Open\ndiscovered limited research on CTE performance on the\nhigh-stakes standardized tests required by each state. With\nthe growing accountability requirements, it is especially\nimportant for CTE teachers and administrators to take this\nopportunity to highlight the success of their program areas\nand courses as it relates to student progress and graduation\nrates.\nInstructional practices and contextual learning strategies\nused in CTE courses produce the successful student academic\nperformance as demonstrated in this study. This investigation\nof Virginia's CTE completer pass rates compared with stu-\ndents who have not completed a CTE program and students'\nsuccess on the SOL assessments.\nAs the nation begins to embrace the concept of 21st century\nskills, performance-based learning, and President Obama's\ncollege and career readiness initiatives, it is time for CTE to\nshowcase how its programs support and encompass these con-\ncepts. Daggett (2009) suggests that CTE must continue to\nclearly demonstrate that these programs contribute to the aca-\ndemic success of students and motivates students to stay in\nschool through graduation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmrein, A.
