Martin 1\n Introduction\nClass differences in marital dissolution rates are a cause for concern in a time of rising\neconomic inequality. White and Rogers (2000) noted that both gendered and gender-\nneutral theories of marital dissolution predict that as economic inequality increases, so\nshould the class gap in marital dissolution rates. Regardless of their origin, however,\ngrowing class differences in marital dissolution rates would exacerbate some effects of\nsocioeconomic inequality and perpetuate inequality across generations, to the extent\nthat marital dissolutions contribute to deficits in adult outcomes as well as deficits in\nchildren's physical and emotional health, educational attainment and performance\nWhereas a slight decline in marital dissolution rates since the late 1970s (Goldstein\noverall trend reflects a sharp decline to highly educated women exclusively, rather than\na broad decline among all groups of women.\nResults from several recent studies suggest a divergence in marital dissolution\nrates by women's educational attainment. Raley and Bumpass (2003) examined first\nmarriage dissolution rates and union dissolution rates for women in the 1995 National\nSurvey of Family Growth (NSFG). They found an education-by-trend interaction\nconsistent with an educational divergence, although the interaction was statistically\nsignificant for only two of several comparisons across educational groups, at p<.10.\nversions of the NSFG, but neither study tested education-by-trend interactions for\nstatistical significance. Elwood and Jencks (2004) also found educational divergence in\nthe prevalence of divorced or separated mothers as a percent of all mothers in the 2000\nCensus 1% Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS). Of course, trends in divorced or\nseparated mothers as a percent of all mothers reflect demographic trends in marriage,\nremarriage, and childbearing as well as trends in marital dissolution.\nWhereas the above studies have produced consistent findings, there are still\nreasons to be uncertain about the extent and timing of any educational divergence in\nmarital dissolution rates. For one thing, even in simple descriptive statistics, the way\nthat education is measured can distort and exaggerate trends in marital dissolution in\nways that previous studies have addressed only lightly or not at all. In addition, at least\ntwo other studies of trends in marital dissolution reported no evidence for educational\ndivergence, at least in the full statistical models (Teachman 2002, South 2001). These\nstudies differ from the others in several respects; they use data sets with generally\nsmaller sample sizes but more statistical controls and a longer historical time span, and\nthey use different specifications for educational attainment and age at marriage. This\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 539\npaper attempts to reduce the uncertainty that still exists about trends in marital\ndissolution by women's education by examining whether educational divergence is\ntruly occurring, and if so, how much is occurring, and when the divergence began. I\noutline three objectives below:\n2. Research objectives\n2.1 Objective one: Confirm an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates\nAn observed trend of declining marital dissolution rates for highly educated women and\nstable or rising rates for less educated women could be (at least in part) a spurious result\nof the way education is measured. Elwood and Jencks (2004) and others have noted\nthat shifts in marital dissolution rates at a given education level might simply reflect\nchanges in the educational distribution rather than changes in the relationship between\neducation and marital dissolution. One way to correct for this problem is to assign\npercentile ranks to education categories, and then to derive approximate quantiles for\nthe education. An example would be to measure marital dissolution rates for the top\nthird, middle third, and bottom third of the education distribution. However, Ellwood\nand Jencks also noted that each education level should be affected in the same direction,\nso that shifts in educational attainment should have little effect on the coefficients for\ndifferences between education categories (see Ellwood and Jencks 2004). In this\npaper, I focus on the increasing differences between educational categories rather than\nthe trend for each separate category.\nA potentially greater but less recognized problem with the measurement of\neducation is that studies of trends in marital dissolution have typically measured\neducational attainment at only one point in time, usually at the time of the survey\ninterview. A woman's educational attainment at interview could have been completed\nbefore marriage, at some point during a marriage, or even after a marital dissolution. At\nthe very least, this means that for some women, their education at interview does not\ncorrespond to their education level for part or all of the time they were married. This\nproblem with educational measurement will almost certainly distort trend estimates in\nretrospective surveys, because women in earlier marriage cohorts have more years to\ncomplete their education after marriage, and even after a marital dissolution, but before\nthe survey interview. A reported decline in marital dissolution rates for recent cohorts\nof highly educated women could simply reflect a correlation between marriage cohort\nand the average time between marriage and survey interview. The current analysis\naddresses this problem by recording a woman's marital and educational histories, and\ncoding educational attainment as a time-varying covariate.\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n540 http://www.demographic-research.org\nA final concern is that evidence for divergence in marital dissolution rates might\nshow up in some data sets but not in others. In the appendix, I summarize trends in\nmarital dissolution rates from other commonly used surveys.\n2.2 Objective two: Distinguish trends by education from other demographic shifts\nIn recent decades there have been at least four shifts in demographic patterns of\nmarriage and of educational attainment that have the potential to confound (or explain)\na divergence in marital dissolution rates by women's educational attainment. One of\nthese is later age at marriage, which is a powerful predictor of low marital dissolution\nprimary reason for the overall decline in marital dissolution rates since 1980 (Heaton\n2002). If highly educated women are delaying marriage more than other women, this\ntrend might explain why highly educated women's marital dissolution rates are\ndeclining while rates for less-educated women are not.\nAnother pronounced shift in marriage that affects marital dissolution rates is an\nincrease in the incidence of premarital births. Among women with lower educational\nattainment, first marriages are increasingly likely to follow a nonmarital birth\n(Upchurch, Lillard and Panis 2001). This trend might explain why less-educated\nwomen's marital dissolution rates remain high while rates for highly educated women\nare declining.\nA third demographic factor correlated with educational attainment is race;\nSweeney and Phillips (2004) have documented diverging racial trends in marital\ndissolution rates that could be conflated with educational trends in the absence of\nappropriate statistical controls.\nThe three potential confounds described above (age at marriage, premarital births,\nand race and ethnicity) can be statistically controlled with the data available for this\nanalysis. However, a final demographic factor correlated with a wife's education is her\nhusband's characteristics. Husbands' education levels have also increased in recent\ndecades, and educational homogamy has also increased (Schwartz and Mare 2005). As\na result, it is impossible to tell from this analysis what part a divergence in marital\ndissolution rates by wives' educational attainment is attributable to husbands' education\nand other economic and social variables. South (2001) and Teachman (2002) included\ncontrols for spousal characteristics in their analyses, but this is not possible in the\ncurrent study. The SIPP does not gather retrospective information on the characteristics\nof first husbands for women who have experienced a marital dissolution.\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 541\n2.3 Objective three: Identify the time period over which divergence has occurred\nAlthough a causal analysis of why marital dissolution might be diverging by women's\neducational attainment is beyond the scope of this paper, confirmation of educational\ndivergence in marital dissolution rates within a specific time period would encourage\nfuture exploration of economic, cultural, and ideological factors particularly salient in\nthat time period. For example, both marital dissolution rates and women's labor force\nparticipation rates were rapidly increasing in the 1960s and 1970s, so interest naturally\nfocused on gendered theories of marital dissolution. After the mid-1970s, educational\ndifferences in women's labor force involvement changed less (c.f. Blau 1998), whereas\nother factors became more salient. One of these new factors is income inequality\nbetween educational groups (McCall 2000; Morris and Western 1999), but many other\nfactors have changed as well, including social awareness of the negative consequences\nof divorce (Waite and Gallagher 2000), family policies (Bogensheider 2000) and a\ncooling of some liberal attitudes about the family (Blankenhorn 2002).\nIn this paper, I analyze trends in marital dissolution rates for U.S. women entering\neducational attainment. To do this, I measure education by educational percentile, by\neducational attainment at interview, and with a time-varying measure of educational\nattainment during a woman's first marriage. I use a multivariate analysis to identify\nany portion of an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates that might be\nattributed to recent changes in age at marriage, prevalence in premarital childbearing, or\ndiverging marital dissolution rates across racial groups of women. Finally, I use\nsupplemental information on earlier marriage cohorts to evaluate whether educational\ndivergence started with the mid-1970s marriage cohorts or at some earlier time.\n3. Data and methods\nIn these analyses I use the 1996 and 2001 Surveys of Income and Program Participation\n(SIPP) (U.S. Census Bureau 2001) and limit the sample to U.S.-born women with a first\nmarried in 1990 \u00ad 94. By excluding foreign-born women, I obtain slightly higher\nestimates for marital dissolution rates for women with no high school diploma than\notherwise. I also limit the sample to exclude men due to concerns about data quality.\nIn sensitivity analyses comparing men and women in the SIPP sample, men reported\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n542 http://www.demographic-research.org\nfewer marital dissolutions than women, particularly at recall durations more than fifteen\nand fewer than three years. Finally, I limit this analysis to first marriages, due to space\nconstraints. Analyses of trends in second marriages, for men, and for foreign-born\nwomen are available on request.\nThe Wave 2 Topical Modules of the SIPP contain event histories for respondents'\nfirst, second, and most recent marriages, as well as a retrospective education history.\nFor marital dissolutions, the SIPP marital histories identify dates of permanent\nseparation as well as divorce (termination). The SIPP provides fewer explanatory\nvariables than the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) or the Panel Study of\nIncome Dynamics (PSID), but these alternate data sources have a much smaller\neffective sample size. The SIPP is the largest survey with an education history that can\nbe matched to a marital history. The fact that this information is available in Wave 2\nalleviates some concerns about sampling attrition in subsequent waves of the SIPP. For\ncomparison, the appendix includes summary statistics on marital dissolution rates and\ntrends from the NSFG, PSID, and the marital and fertility history supplements of the\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS).\nThe outcome variable in this analysis is whether a woman reports a permanent\nseparation (including but not limited to divorce) within ten years of first marriage.\nWomen who do not report a permanent separation within ten years of a first marriage\nare censored from the analysis at the ten-year point. Because a few women who report\na recent but permanent separation at the time of the survey subsequently reconcile those\nmarriages Martin and Bumpass (1989) recommend censoring marital dissolution\nhistories 12 months before interview. I do not use this correction because it can\nintroduce systematic bias in life table estimates for data sets (like the SIPP) that report\noutcomes on an annual rather than monthly basis. Censoring all marital histories at the\nfirst or second year before interview, or counting only divorce as a marital dissolution,\ndoes not alter the main findings of this study. Findings from Raley and Bumpass\n(2003) suggest that education*trend patterns in union dissolution (including cohabiting\nunions with marriages) are not dissimilar from education*trend patterns in marital\ndissolution, but the SIPP does not include a cohabitation history to confirm this finding.\nIn this study, the key explanatory variables are the year of a woman's first\nmarriage and her educational attainment. In the descriptive analysis, I identify\nwoman's education using the most common fixed measure of education \u00ad the level of\neducation at interview (no high school diploma, high school diploma or equivalent,\nsome college, four-year college degree, and master's or professional degree). I also\ngenerate a percentile score for the education distribution of each 5-year marriage cohort\nand identify each woman as being in the top, middle, or bottom third of her respective\neducation distribution. For college graduate women, I show descriptive statistics based\non the time women complete their education, relative to marriage. Finally, in the\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 543\nmultivariate analyses, I treat educational attainment as a fully time-varying covariate for\nall women, so that a woman's yearly risk of marital dissolution is estimated based on\nher educational attainment in that specific year. The SIPP education history makes this\ntime-varying specification possible. In the multivariate analysis I also control for age at\nfirst marriage, whether a first marriage was preceded by a premarital birth, and race or\nethnic group.\nA significant concern in this analysis is the potential for response error in the\nretrospective reports of the marital and education histories. Response error can be\ncorrelated with both educational attainment and duration of retrospection, the main\ncoefficients under investigation in this study. I checked the results from the SIPP using\ndescriptive life tables from the marital histories of all six cycles of the NSFG from 1973\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) marriage and fertility supplements for June 1985,\n1990, and 1995. All surveys showed trends consistent with those from the SIPP. The\neducational divergence since 1975 was less pronounced in the NSFG and PSID than in\nthe SIPP, and slightly more pronounced in the CPS. I also checked for possible\ncorrelations between response duration and survey error by comparing SIPP 1996 and\nSIPP 2001 reports for the same marriage cohorts at different recall durations, and I\nfound no systematic variation of marital dissolution patterns by response duration.\nAs a final check, I looked for evidence of post-dissolution educational attainment\nas a source of response error. While the prevalence of response error is unknown, the\nseverity of its potential effects can be inferred from the relative frequency of women's\neducational transitions within and after marriage. If response errors in event histories\noccur randomly and in random directions, misreports that place education after (rather\nthan before) a marital dissolution and those that place education before (rather than\nafter) a marital dissolution should balance out. However, if a marital dissolution\nincreases the true rate at which women subsequently complete additional education,\nthen response errors will not balance out, but will inflate the measured marital\ndissolution rates for women with education within marriage. In separate sensitivity\nanalyses, I estimated coefficients for the effect of marital dissolution on women's rates\nof educational transitions. I found evidence that a marital dissolution increases\nwomen's rates of transitions to high school completion, some college, and master's or\nprofessional degree attainment, but not for the transition to a four-year college degree. I\nthen estimated models with education at interview instead of time-varying coefficients\nfor education, and found that the coefficients for divergence patterns were slightly\nsmaller than those shown here but remained statistically significant, indicating that\nsome proportion of the educational divergence in marital dissolution patterns is taking\nplace among women who complete their education within marriage (or report doing so).\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n544 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3.2 Analytic approach\nIn the descriptive analysis, I analyze trends in marital dissolutions for first marriages\nfrom 1975 to 1994 using SIPP data and employing a Kaplan-Meier life table procedure\nto identify the outcome of a marital dissolution within 10 years of a first marriage. I\nthen summarize results from marriage cohorts of the SIPP dating back to 1960 to make\na rough estimate of the time when marital dissolution rates began to diverge by\neducational attainment.\nIn the multivariate part of the analysis, I measure coefficients for educational\nattainment on the yearly hazard of a marital dissolution. The objective of the\nmultivariate analysis is to find out whether trends in marital dissolution rates by\nwomen's educational attainment might be parsimoniously explained by other\ndemographic variables known to partly explain trends in marital dissolution rates. To\ncontrol for the possibility that educational trends in marital dissolution rates might\ninappropriately reflect shifts in the proportion of women who complete their education\nafter marriage (or even after a marital dissolution), I use the time-varying measure of\neducational attainment in the multivariate analysis rather than education at interview. I\nemploy Cox proportional hazard models to control for marital duration and censor all\nobservations after 10 years of a first marriage (For a review of event history models, see\nThe Cox proportional hazard models identify the coefficient for each covariate on\nthe yearly rate or hazard of a marital dissolution. I specify the yearly hazard h(t) as a\nfunction of respondent characteristics for age and race (xi\n), age at marriage and\nincidence of a premarital first birth (xj\n), year of first marriage (y), and duration since\nmarriage (ti\n) as represented below:\nModel 1: Log h(t) = 0\n+ i\nxi\n+ y + xi\ny + (t).\nModel 2: Log h(t) = 0\n+ i\nxi\n+ y + xi\ny + (t) + j\nxj\n.\nFor the term y representing the year of first marriage, year 1975 is rescaled to 0,\nand the term xi\ny captures the interaction between year of marriage and each of the\ndichotomous variables for education and race. I include race*year interactions because\nSweeney and Phillips (2004) found such interactions in a previous study. Hence, the\nmodels estimate two coefficients for each education and race variable: a \"main effect\"\nas of first marriages formed in 1975, and an interaction between each explanatory\nvariable and year of first marriage that identifies the extent to which trends in marital\ndissolution rates have changed by that variable for first marriages formed after 1975.\nThe term (t) implicitly captures the duration dependency of marital dissolution rates\nthrough the Cox proportional hazard specification.\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 545\nThe second model adds the series of dichotomous controls for age at marriage and\nincidence of a premarital birth. In sensitivity analyses, the year*age at marriage\ncoefficients did not increase the model fit enough to justify inclusion in the main\nmodels (results available on request). The main findings of this analysis were robust\nwith respect to this and other alternative model specifications.\nThe models shown in this paper use only a single duration dependency coefficient\nand only one time span \u00ad ten years. There are several possible ways that the hazard of a\nmarital dissolution might not be proportional with respect to duration, and other studies\nhave found some evidence for such dependency (c.f. South 2001). Some possible\ninteractions include year of marriage*duration, age at marriage*duration, and education\nlevel*duration. Various sensitivity analyses with different controls for nonproportional\nhazards did not affect the substantive results. Also, alternative models with 5-year\ndurations, 15-year durations, and open-ended durations did not affect the substantive\nresults. In any case, the reader should be cautioned that the coefficients from these\nmodels reflect group differences that are averaged across the first ten years of marriage.\n4. Results\nThe descriptive results show that it is unlikely that recent increases in women's\neducational attainment have contributed to the observed decline in marital dissolution\nrates for women with four-year college degrees. Indeed, marital dissolution rates are\nactually rather high in the upper-middle part of the education distribution that is\npresumably the source of the increasing numbers of college graduates. Although\nshifting educational attainment could explain part or all of the observed increase in\nmarital dissolution rates at the very lowest education level (because women with no\nhigh school diploma are an increasingly small and select proportion of the total\npopulation), a comparison between the top third and the remaining two thirds of the\neducation distribution still shows a clear pattern of divergence in marital dissolution\nrates.\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n546 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Women with a marital dissolution within ten years of a first\nmarriage, as a percent of all women entering a first marriage:\nCohort life table estimates by education percentile, education level,\nand timing of 4-year degree relative to marriage\nYear of First Marriage\nA B C D D \u00ad A\nBy Education Percentile\nBy Education Level\nBy Timing of 4-Year Degree\nTable 1 shows life table estimates for the proportions of U.S. women with a\nmarital dissolution within ten years of first marriage for five-year marriage cohorts from\nstatistical significance levels from a simple t-test for the difference between the\nproportions.\nAdditional rows in Table 1 separate marital dissolution rates by timing of four-year\ncollege degree relative to marriage. The results show that timing of completed\neducation relative to marriage is an important determinant of the probability of a marital\ndissolution, and that a time-varying specification for current educational attainment in\neach year of a marriage might be more appropriate than a specification based on\neducation at interview or at the time of marriage. Historically, marital dissolution rates\nwere lowest among women who complete a four-year college degree before marriage,\nbut dropped most rapidly for women who complete a four-year college degree after\nmarriage. Table 1, shows, however, that for the 1975-79 marriage cohort in particular,\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 547\nwomen who finished a college degree after marriage had divorce rates similar to\nwomen with no college degree, rather than to women who received a college degree\nbefore marriage. Finally, women who complete their four-year college degree more\nthan ten years after marriage have marital dissolution rates comparable to women with\nno college degree. For these women (who are most numerous in the marriage cohorts\nwith the longest recall durations), educational attainment at interview is clearly not a\ngood predictor of marital dissolution rates.\nTable 2 describes the variables in the event history model, with separate statistics\ndistribution of covariates. Table 2 measures educational attainment at two points in\ntime for each respondent to capture some of the time-varying nature in this variable (In\nthe actual hazard models, education is coded as a fully time-varying covariate).\nEducation at marriage has increased more than education at censoring, in part because\nage at marriage has increased dramatically and women are increasingly likely to\ncomplete their education before marrying. Hence, the timing of educational attainment\nis correlated with marriage cohort for the time period of this study. Compared to\nwomen in earlier marriage cohorts, women in more recent cohorts were more likely to\nhave a constant (completed) education level throughout the first ten years of marriage.\nAlso, age at marriage has increased dramatically, as has the proportion of women\nentering a first marriage having already had a premarital birth.\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n548 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Covariates used in the Cox proportional hazard analysis of the risk\nof a marital dissolution: Descriptive statistics (N = 16,756)\nOverall\nSample\nCohort\nCohort\nEducation at marriage\nEducation at censoring\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 549\nTable 3: Cox proportional hazard models for variables predicting the rate of\nmarital dissolution for women entering a first marriage from 1975 to\nModel A Model B\nPredictor B SE B eB B SE B eB\nMain Coefficients for Education\n4-Year College Degree - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nYear of marriage x education\nYear x 4-Year College Degree - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nCoefficients for Race/Ethnicity\nNonhispanic White - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nYear x Nonhispanic White - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAge at 1st marriage\nEducational attainment is measured as a time-varying covariate.\neB = proportional increase in event rate associated with a 1-unit increase in x.\nThe reference category is Nonhispanic White women with a 4-year college degree, age 22-24 at marriage, with no premarital birth,\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n550 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3 shows results from the multivariate analysis. Model A includes covariates\nfor educational attainment, race, year of marriage, interactions between year of\nmarriage and educational attainment and interactions between year of marriage and\nrace. Education was already a strong predictor of marital dissolution for first marriages\nas of 1975, as shown by the main coefficients for education. For example, compared to\nthe comparison category of women with a four-year college degree, women with no\nhigh school diploma had a marital dissolution rate exp(1.67) or 1.95 times as high,\ncontrolling for race. The coefficient for year of marriage shows that for the (omitted)\ncategory of women with a four-year college degree, marital dissolution rates declined\nacross year of marriage by a factor of exp(-.038) or .963 each year. For women with no\nhigh school diploma, the interaction term for year of marriage*no high school diploma\nindicates that marital dissolution rates increased across year of marriage by a factor of\nexp(.048) or 1.049 each year, relative to the (declining) baseline trend for women with a\nfour-year college degree.\nModel B adds covariates for age at marriage and incidence of a premarital birth.\nWhen these variables are added to the model, the main coefficients for education are no\nlonger statistically significant, indicating that for marriages around 1975, much of the\ndifference in marital dissolution rates across educational levels was explained by the\nfact that highly educated women married at older ages than less educated women.\nSimilarly, the negative coefficient for year of marriage is smaller in Model B than in\nModel A, indicating that for the comparison group of women with a four-year college\ndegree, some part of the decline in marital dissolution rates over time is explained by\nincreasing age at marriage for college-educated women. However, the coefficients for\ninteractions between year of marriage and educational attainment are just as\npronounced in Model B as in Model A. In other words, marriage timing can partly\nexplain differences in marital dissolution rates across education levels, as well as\noverall trends across marriage cohorts, but cannot explain the differences in trends that\nconstitute the educational divergence in marital dissolution rates.\nOne explanation for the persistence of a pattern of educational divergence in\nModel B is that age at marriage has increased for women of all educational levels. In\naddition, women of lower educational attainment marry younger than women of higher\neducational attainment, and the effects of a shift in age at marriage are more\npronounced at young ages (say, 18 versus 20) than at older ages (say, 24 versus 27).\nAmong women of high educational attainment, marital dissolution rates would have\ndecreased less dramatically were it not for increasing age at marriage, but among\nwomen of lower educational attainment, marital dissolution rates would have increased\nmore dramatically were it not for increasing age at marriage, so the magnitude of\neducational divergence would have stayed roughly the same.\nDemographic Research: Volume 15, Article 20\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 551\nTo illustrate this point, I have used the coefficients from Model B in Table 3 to\npredict relative marital dissolution rates for women of different education levels who\ncomputational exercise. Compared to the descriptive results in Table 1, the results in\nTable 4 show a shallower decline in marital dissolution rates for college graduates, but\na steeper rise in marital dissolution rates for women of lower educational attainment.\nTable 4: Relative rates of marital disruption during the 10 years following a\nfirst marriage, controlling for race, age at marriage, and premarital\nbirths.

These results indicate that\nhighly educated women have had lower marital dissolution rates than other women for\nat least several decades. However, educational differences in marital dissolution rates\nbecame much more pronounced only after the 1975 \u00ad 79 marriage cohort. Because\nwomen in marriage cohorts of the 1960s and 1970s had to recall their marital histories\nup to 40 years, the results for these cohorts are more vulnerable to response errors and\nselection concerns than the results for more recent marriage cohorts.\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n552 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 1: Women with a marital dissolution within ten years of a first\nmarriage, as a percent of all women entering a first marriage:\nLife table estimates by education level (N = 28,067)\n5. Conclusion\n5.1 Confirming an educational divergence in marital dissolution rates\nThe results show that marital dissolution rates have indeed been diverging by women's\neducational attainment.

However, patterns indicating\nan educational divergence in marital dissolution rates remain robust and strongly\nstatistically significant in event history models that use a time-varying measure of\neducation to control for changes in the timing of education relative to marriage.\nDescriptive statistics show the greatest declines in marital dissolution among college\ngraduate women whose completion of a college degree came after their first marriage.\nInstead of explaining away a spurious trend in marital dissolution rates, the time-\nvarying specification of education effectively captures a real trend.\n5.2 Distinguishing trends by education from other demographic shifts\nResults from Tables 3 and 4 show that the increasing educational divergence in marital\ndissolution rates after the 1975 marriage cohort appears to be independent of changes in\nage at marriage, increasing incidence of premarital first births among less-educated\nwomen, or shifting racial patterns of marital dissolution. The use of statistical controls\nfor age at marriage and premarital childbearing leads to a potentially troubling\ninterpretation of recent trends in marital dissolution rates. For groups of women with\nless than a four-year college degree, observed marital dissolution rates are steady or\nonly slightly increasing. However, net of demographic controls (chiefly for age at\nmarriage), marital dissolution rates for less educated women are clearly rising; their\nmarriages are becoming more unstable even as marriages become more stable for\nhighly educated women.\n5.3 Identifying the time period over which divergence has occurred\nResults from Figure 1 suggest that prior to the 1975 marriage cohort, educational\ndifferences in marital dissolution rates were large but not increasing. This pattern may\nexplain part of the discrepancy between longer-term analyses that found little or no\neducation-by-trend interaction in marital dissolution rates (Teachman 2002; South\n2001) and shorter-term analyses that found an education-by-trend interaction (Sweeney\nand Phillips 2004; Raley and Bumpass 2003). However, the studies differ in other\nrespects, such as the use of statistical controls for husband characteristics, specification\nof age at marriage, and specification of marital duration.\nFinally, whereas the recent educational divergence in marital dissolution rates is\nnot explained by other demographic factors, the educational differences that existed in\n1975 are at least partly explained by differences in age at marriage across educational\ngroups. This finding strengthens the case that a new relationship between women's\nMartin: Trends in marital dissolution by women's education in the United States\n554 http://www.demographic-research.org\neducation and marital dissolution is emerging; a relationship quite different from that\n6.
