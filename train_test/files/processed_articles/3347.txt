These calls\nseem motivated by two developments in the field. One is our\nincreasing recognition that the social context in which move-\nments operate facilitates or inhibits their emergence, mobili-\nzation, and outcomes. Indeed, the mass media and public\nopinion provide support or opposition for a movement, thus\nopening or closing windows of opportunity for action (e.g.,\nBeaford, Gongaware, & Valadez, 2000; Neidhardht & Rucht,\n1991). Another is our increasing recognition that we need to\nbetter understand those factors that influence identification\nwith and participation in movements (e.g., Klandermans,\nHere, public opinion signifies the potential pools of citizens\nwho may be converted from adherents into activists in move-\nments--or from unsympathetic to them into activists against\nOne reason that social movement scholars have been slow\nto investigate the roles of public support for social movements\nis the paucity of measurement instruments, empirical data, and\nanalytical techniques suitable for facilitating such research. In\nMcCright, 2008) have begun to remedy this by developing\nand validating a measure of social movement identity for the\nenvironmental movement. They argue that a generic, revised\nversion of this measure may be efficacious for examining\nidentification with a broad array of movements, especially\nwhen it is embedded within a nationally representative survey.\nSuch a revised measure would facilitate investigation of over-\nlapping support for (or opposition to) multiple movements,\nallowing further contributions to cross-movement research\nIn this study, we showcase a generalized version of the\nsocial movement identity measure first presented by Dunlap\nand McCright (2008). Our social movement identity instru-\nment may be useful for scholars interested in examining pub-\nlic support as a movement resource or as an indicator of\npotential activists or opponents. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our instrument by investigating identification with 20\nmajor U.S. social movements within a diverse sample of the\nAmerican public.

We also examine the demo-\ngraphic, social, and political bases of these social movement\nidentities. Influenced by work on values (e.g., Gecas, 2000;\nrelated work on emotions (e.g., Jasper, 2011)--in social\nmovements scholarship, we further examine how values ori-\nentations and moral intuitions influence social movement\nidentities.\nIn the next section, we briefly review the relevant scholar-\nMcCright, 2008), who introduce and validate the social\nmovement identity measure that we extend here. As our con-\ntribution primarily focuses on instrumentation and analytical\ntechniques, we abstain from a wider theoretical or concep-\ntual discussion about identity and social movements, which\nDunlap and McCright (2008) and McCright and Dunlap\n(2015) review. In subsequent sections, we describe our study\nparticipants, the social movement identity instrument, and\nthe other measures used in our study. After discussing our\nresults, we sketch a future research agenda for using this\nsocial movement identity instrument to improve our under-\nstanding of understudied rank-and-file movement members,\nsympathetic adherents, and unsympathetic opponents in the\ngeneral public.\nDeveloping a Measure of Social\nMovement Identity\nDespite the increased attention to identity in the social move-\nments literature in recent decades (e.g., Hunt & Benford,\nremains rather ambiguous (see, for example, Jasper, 1997, p.\nclarity and empirical precision, Dunlap and McCright (2008)\nexamine selected frameworks that enumerate key dimen-\npersuaded by the logic and empirical utility of Jasper's\n(1997) typology of personal, collective, and movement iden-\ntities and Hunt et al.'s (1994) typology of protagonist, audi-\nence, and antagonist identity fields. Briefly, Dunlap and\nMcCright (2008) argue that a social movement identity mea-\nsure that taps movement identity as conceptualized by Jasper\n(1997) and also captures the different identity fields concep-\ntualized by Hunt et al. (1994) will facilitate the type of\nempirical research on public support and opposition to social\nmovements that other scholars have been calling for (e.g.,\nUsing survey data from a nationally representative Gallup\nvalidate a measure of environmental movement identity.\nThey use responses to the survey item--\"Thinking specifi-\ncally about the environmental movement, do you think of\nyourself as: an active participant in the environmental\nmovement; sympathetic towards the movement, but not\nactive; neutral; or unsympathetic towards the environmental\nmovement?\"--to differentiate across the following environ-\nmental movement identities: unsympathetic, neutral, sympa-\nthetic but not active, and active participant. Dunlap and\nMcCright (2008) find this single-item measure of environ-\nmental movement identity to be moderately associated with\nmembership in environmental movement organizations,\nevaluations of the environmental movement, and pro-envi-\nronmental behaviors.\nMcCright and Dunlap (2008a) extend the Dunlap and\nMcCright (2008) study while analyzing 6 years of Gallup\nitem indicator of environmental movement identity is associ-\nated with key characteristics of environmental problem\nbelief systems within the U.S. public, building upon earlier\nscholarship on the movement-related belief systems of orga-\nnizational leaders. Briefly, McCright and Dunlap (2008a)\nfind that \"the environmental problem belief systems of self-\nidentified active participants in the environmental movement\nexhibit greater consistency, greater consensus, and less posi-\ntion extremity than do those of individuals unsympathetic to\nthe environmental movement\" (p. 651).\nMost recently, analyzing data from a March 2000 Gallup\nPoll, McCright and Dunlap (2015) compare the relative per-\nformance of two measures of environmental movement iden-\ntity: a variant of Pichardo Almanzar, Sullivan-Catlin, and\nDeane's (1998) \"self-identified environmentalist\" and\nDunlap and McCright's (2008) \"environmental movement\nidentity.\" They find that Dunlap and McCright's (2008) envi-\nronmental movement identity indicator more strongly pre-\ndicts environmental organization membership and affect\ntoward the environmental movement than does Pichardo\nAlmanzar et al.'s (1998) self-identified environmentalist\nindicator, while the latter more strongly predicts self-reported\npro-environmental behaviors than does the former. They\nargue that a slightly revised version of Dunlap and McCright's\n(2008) self-reported indicator of social movement identity\nmay help scholars investigate identification and engagement\nwith a broad array of social movements via surveys of nation-\nally representative samples of the public--achieving wide\ngeneralizability and further embedding public opinion schol-\narship into social movement research.\nIn this study, we revise the Dunlap and McCright (2008,\np. 413) measure in two ways they suggest. First, we include\nan \"active opponent\" response category to mirror the \"active\nparticipant\" category. This will allow us to capture those\nindividuals who are actively opposing--not just unsympa-\nthetic toward--a movement. Second, we revise the question\nstem and response categories so they can apply to any move-\nment and not just the environmental movement. We demon-\nstrate the efficacy of this revised social movement identity\ninstrument by investigating identification with 20 major U.S.\nsocial movements within a diverse sample of the American\npublic.\nAllen et al. 3\nThe Study\nParticipants and Procedures\nWe tested our social movement identity instrument via an\nonline survey administered to a modestly sized U.S. conve-\nnience sample. Briefly, we administered our survey via\nSurveyMonkey to participants we recruited via Amazon\nMechanical Turk (AMT), a crowdsourcing website where\n\"requesters\" solicit \"workers\" to perform \"human intelli-\ngence tasks\" (HITs) for pay. AMT has emerged as a practical\nway for recruiting a large number of participants from a rea-\nsonably wide cross-section of the general public either for\nconducting online experiments (e.g., Clements, McCright,\nDietz, & Marquart-Pyatt, 2015) or for designing and testing\nnew measurement instruments (e.g., Allen, Dietz, &\nMcCright, 2015) across the social sciences (e.g., Goodman,\nCryder, & Cheema, 2013; Levay, Freese, & Druckman,\nWeinberg, Freese, & McElhattan, 2014). To solicit a broad\ncross-section of research participants and minimize self-\nselection by AMT workers highly engaged with different\nsocial movements, we advertised a HIT titled \"YourAttitudes\nAbout Important Social Issues in the US.\" We limited par-\nticipation to adults residing in the United States.\nOur survey was completed by 542 U.S. residents on May\nvey, which took slightly less than 8 min on average. Compared\nwith a representative sample of the U.S. general public, our\nAMT convenience sample is younger, more highly educated,\nmore liberal, and less religious (see Table 1). In addition to our\nsocial movement identity instrument, the survey included typi-\ncal questions about respondents' demographic, social, and\npolitical characteristics as well as questions we used to measure\ntheir values orientations and moral intuitions.\nMeasures in the Study\nNear the end of the survey, respondents answered the follow-\ning question:\nMany social movements in our nation try to influence\ngovernment policy, business practices, and/or social and cultural\nnorms. Below is a list of 20 US social movements that have been\nactive in recent decades. Please indicate how, if at all, you\nidentify with each social movement.1\nTheir response categories (with coding) were as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm an active opponent of this movement (1);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm unsympathetic toward the movement, but I don't\nactively oppose it (2);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm neutral toward this movement (3);\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm sympathetic toward the movement, but I'm not\nactive in it (4); and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 I'm an active participant in this movement (5).\nThe order of these 20 movements was randomized so that\nrespondents saw the items in different orders. Nonresponse\nacross these 20 items was rather minimal; most items had\nonly one or two cases with a missing value, and no item had\nmore than five cases with missing values. To maintain sam-\nple size when creating our scales, we assigned missing val-\nues to the median category for that specific item.\nThe results of exploratory factor analysis (described in the\n\"Analytical Techniques\" section) informed our creation of\nthree social movement identity scales, which we formed by\naveraging respondent's answers to similar items. One mea-\nsure, progressive movement identity (Cronbach's  = .83),\ntaps identification with the rights-based and other progres-\nsive social movements: animal rights, antinuclear, civil\nrights, environmental, gay and lesbian rights, gun control,\nlabor, peace, pro-choice, and women's rights movements.\nAnother measure, traditional and Christian movement iden-\ntity ( = .81), captures identification with general conserva-\ntive movements and the Christian Right: anti-immigration,\nantipornography, Christian Right, pro-life, and Tea Party\nmovements. A final measure, masculinist and libertarian\nmovement identity ( = .68), taps identification with conser-\nvative masculinity and property rights movements: libertar-\nian, men's rights, militia, Promise Keepers, and property\nrights movements.\nWe measured respondents' values orientations using the\nas modified by Stern, Dietz, and Guagnano (1998); Steg and\nTable 1.

The order of these items\nwas randomized. The full list of value statements appears in\nTable SM1 in the Supplementary Materials. Informed by the\nresults of exploratory factor analysis, we created four values\norientations scales by averaging respondents' answers to\nsimilar items: openness to change ( = .68), traditionalism\n( = .66), self-interest ( = .82), and humanistic altruism\nWe measured respondents' moral intuitions using the\nMoral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek,\n2009), which consists of two related questions assessing the\nkinds of moral intuitions people use when making decisions\nabout right and wrong. Respondents indicated the relevance\n(from \"not at all relevant\" = 1 to \"extremely relevant\" = 6) of\nseveral brief moral considerations when deciding whether\nsomething is right or wrong, and they expressed their judg-\nment (from \"strongly disagree\" = 1 to \"strongly agree\" = 6)\nabout several statements. The order of these items was ran-\ndomized within each question. The full list of relevance\nitems and judgment items appears in Table SM2 in the\nSupplementary Materials. Again after exploratory factor\nanalysis, we created five moral intuitions scales by averaging\nrespondents' answers to similar items: care ( = .70), fair-\nness ( = .67), in-group loyalty ( = .75), authority ( = .77),\nand purity ( = .86).\nTable 1 describes the demographic, social, and political\nvariables we used in our analyses. Gender (\"female\" = 1) and\nrace (\"White\" = 1) were measured with dummy variables.\nwas measured by the highest degree earned: \"high school\ndiploma or GED equivalent\" = 1 to \"graduate/professional\ndegree\" = 4. Income was measured as approximate yearly\nmore\" = 5. We measured religious affiliation with two\ndummy variables (\"Christian\" and \"non-Christian\") using\n\"non-religious\" as the reference category. Religiosity was\nmeasured as frequency of attendance of religious services:\n\"never\" = 1 to \"once a week or more\" = 5. Finally, we again\nused exploratory factor analysis to help create an ideology\nscale (Cronbach's  = .92), by averaging respondents'\nanswers to three items meant to tap political, social, and eco-\nnomic dimensions of ideology: \"very conservative\" = 1 to\n\"very liberal\" = 7.2\nAnalytical Techniques\nWe conducted our analyses in three stages with IBM SPSS\n19. First, we examined the dimensionality of the 20 social\nmovement identities to determine whether any identity clus-\nters emerge. We performed this via principal components\nanalysis with Promax rotation with Kaiser Normalization. As\nwe mentioned in \"Measures in the Study\" section, these fac-\ntor analysis results identify three distinct social movement\nidentity clusters. Second, we explored the percentages of our\nrespondents who reported different levels of identification\nwith the 20 social movements in our study.\nThird, we performed a series of ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regression analyses to examine the demographic,\nsocial, political, and cultural bases of the three social move-\nment identity clusters. For each social movement identity\ncluster, we performed a three-block nested OLS regression\nanalysis, adding demographic, social, and political charac-\nteristics in the first block, values orientations in the second\nblock, and moral intuitions in the third block. We examined\nthe results of these regression analyses to determine the\nextent to which the measures that emerge from our social\nmovement identity instrument have construct validity\nreport conventional significance levels, but as this is a con-\nvenience sample, p values are probably best interpreted as a\ncomparison of the effects of a particular independent vari-\nable to the potential effects of a purely random variable.\nResults and Discussion\nThree Social Movement Identity Clusters\nThe results of our principal components analysis support the\nexistence of three distinct social movement identity clusters.\nThree factors have eigenvalues greater than 1 and factor\nloadings greater than 0.4. Furthermore, these three factors\nhavesubstantialfacevalidity.TableSM3intheSupplementary\nMaterials displays the factor loadings and eigenvalues from\nour principal component analysis.\nOur results show that respondents' identification with the\n10 left-leaning social movements hangs together as one pro-\ngressive movement identity cluster. This cluster consists of\non extending rights to historically marginalized, oppressed,\nor disenfranchised groups; flattening hierarchy; and reducing\nviolence. Despite conflict and competition among the lead-\ners, organizations, and funders of left-leaning movements\n(often discussed as \"identity politics\") (e.g., Bernstein, 2005;\nSchlesinger, 1991), our analysis indicates that laypeople in\nthe general public seem to identify with this group of move-\nments in a coherent manner. Analyzing nationally represen-\ntative survey data from spring 2000 onAmericans'agreement\nwith the goals of a similar group of movements, McCright\nand Dunlap (2008b) find evidence of a progressive social\nmovement ideology centered on a rights master frame. Even\nthough we examine movement identity and not agreement\nwith movement goals, our results nevertheless help confirm\nthe existence of a progressive social movement family in the\nminds of the general public.\nIdentification with the 10 right-leaning social movements\nin our study separates into two distinct clusters, one repre-\nsenting a traditional and Christian movement identity and\nthe other tapping a masculinist and libertarian movement\nAllen et al. 5\nidentity. Movements within the former cluster represent a\nmore traditional and populist conservatism, which promotes\nfundamentalist moralism and nativism and also includes the\nright wing rage of Tea Party activism in recent years.\nMovements within the latter cluster represent a conservatism\nfocused more specifically on preserving and promoting tra-\nditional views of masculinity, free market fundamentalism,\nand patriarchal property rights. To illustrate, this movement\nidentity cluster likely captures such related activism as the\nmale-dominated Alt-Right Internet community, property dis-\nputes in the Western United States ranging from the 1970s'\nSagebrush Rebellion to the recent conflicts at the Cliven\nBundy ranch in Nevada and the stand-off at a wildlife refuge\nheadquarters in Oregon, and the vigilant antistatism of many\nmale advocates of Internet-based cryptocurrency (e.g.,\nBitcoin).\nLevels of Identification With 20 Social\nMovements\nTable 2 shows the percentages of respondents at each level of\nidentification with each of the 20 social movements. We have\ngrouped these movements into their three clusters from the\nprevious section. As our data come from a convenience sam-\nple that skews younger, more liberal, and less religious than\nthe U.S. general public, we do not present these percentages\nas estimates of population characteristics. Rather we offer\nthem to show the variation in identification with multiple\nmovements that can be captured with our social movement\nidentity instrument--variation that likely may prove effica-\ncious in explaining movement-related attitudes, beliefs, and\nbehaviors.As McCright and Dunlap demonstrate with nation-\nally representative data, such a measure of social movement\nidentity for the environmental movement does help explain\nself-reported membership in environmental organizations and\nself-reported environmental behaviors (Dunlap & McCright,\n2008) as well as movement-related belief systems (McCright\n& Dunlap, 2008a)--even better than does a self-identified\nenvironmentalist measure (McCright & Dunlap, 2015).\nGiven this earlier work on the environmental movement and\nthe fact that the Gallup Organization continues to include a ver-\nsion of the environmental movement identity measure in its\nsurveys, we first briefly discuss the percentages for the environ-\nmental movement identity. As a point of comparison, in its\nMarch 2015 Environment Poll (which was administered 6\nweeks prior to our survey), Gallup reports that 16% of its nation-\nally representative sample identifies as an active participant in\nthe environmental movement, 41% identifies as sympathetic\ntoward the movement but not active in it, 30% identifies as neu-\ntral toward the movement, and 11% identifies as unsympathetic\ntoward the movement (with 1% reporting \"no opinion\"). The\npercentages for the environmental movement in Table 2 differ\nTable 2. Percentage of Respondents Reporting Identification With 20 Social Movements in the United States (N = 542).\nSocial movements\nActive\nopponent of\nmovement\nUnsympathetic toward\nmovement, but don't\nactively oppose it\nNeutral\ntoward\nmovement\nSympathetic toward\nmovement, but not\nactive in it\nActive\nparticipant in\nmovement\nProgressive\nTraditional and Christian\nMasculinist and Libertarian\n6 SAGE Open\nonly somewhat from these. In our study, 20.7% of respondents\nidentify as active participants in the environmental movement,\n50.4% identify as sympathetic but not active, 21.4% identify as\nneutral, and 7.6% identify as unsympathetic toward or active\nopponents of the environmental movement. These more pro-\nenvironmental percentages are most likely due to greater per-\ncentages of liberals and younger adults in our sample than in the\ngeneral public--as these two groups tend to report high levels\nof environmentalism (e.g., Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, & Jones,\noffers at least modest evidence that this social movement iden-\ntity measure can distinguish different levels of identification\nwith a social movement in what we argue is a meaningful way.\nA few key patterns in Table 2 warrant some discussion.\nFirst, not surprising given the nature of our sample, we see\nstronger identification with left-leaning or liberal movements\nthan with right-leaning or conservative movements among\ndents indicate that they are sympathetic toward or active par-\nticipants in a liberal movement, yet only between 10.5% and\n34.5% of our respondents report being sympathetic toward or\nactively participating in a conservative movement.\nSecond, patterns of identification within the group of 10\nleft-leaning movements seem to align with the salience and/or\nmobilization of these movements in recent years. For instance,\nthe three left-leaning movements with the lowest percentages\nof sympathetics or active participants either emerged prior to\nment: 46.4%) or are movements relatively circumscribed in\ntheir focus (antinuclear movement: 38.4%; gun control move-\nment: 46.6%). The remaining seven movements, which have\nmore substantive origins in this rights-based protest cycle each\nenjoy clear majorities of sympathetics or active participants.\nIndeed, the three left-leaning movements with the highest per-\ncentages of active participants--approximately 20% for the\nenvironmental, animal rights, and gay and lesbian rights\nmovements--each have experienced considerable mobiliza-\ntion and have garnered much media coverage in recent years.\nThird, very low percentages of our respondents are active\nparticipants in the 10 conservative movements, and only\nrelatively small percentages are sympathetic toward these\nmovements. Distinguishing the five masculinist and libertar-\nian movements from those traditional and Christian move-\nments reveals another interesting pattern.Although majorities\nof our respondents are either unsympathetic toward or active\nopponents of the five traditional conservative movements,\nnear majorities or majorities are neutral toward the five mas-\nculinity-based or libertarian movements--suggesting less\npublic familiarity with this latter group of movements.\nDemographic, Social, Political, and Cultural Bases\nof Three Social Movement Identity Clusters\nWe now turn to the results of our three-block nested OLS\nregression analyses that help us identify the demographic,\nsocial, political, and cultural bases of the three social move-\nment identity clusters. Tables SM4 to SM6 in the\nSupplementary Materials display the full results of this\nregression analysis for each cluster, respectively. Table 3\npresents the results of the final OLS regression model for\neach cluster. The average variance inflation factor (VIF) in\nthe full models is 1.79, with the highest VIF of 2.90 for the\nauthority moral intuition, indicating no substantial problems\nwith multicollinearity.\nThe first model in Table 3 explains approximately 56% of\nthe variation in identification with progressive social move-\nments. As Table SM4 indicates, gender and political ideol-\nogy alone account for about four fifths of this explained\nvariance. Females and liberals report much stronger identifi-\ncation with these progressive social movements than do their\nmale and conservative counterparts. Furthermore, altruism\ntoward other humans and a moral intuition of nurturing care\neach has a moderately strong positive effect on progressive\nsocial movement identity, while a purity moral intuition of\nabhorrence for things perceived as disgusting has a small\nnegative effect.\nThe second model in Table 3 explains approximately 58%\nof the variation in identification with traditional and Christian\nsocial movements. As indicated in Table SM5, a small set of\ndemographic, social, and political variables account for\nabout 85% of this explained variance, with political ideology\nhaving the strongest effect of these variables. Briefly,\nfemales, lesser educated adults, less wealthy adults, more\nreligious individuals, and political conservatives report\nstronger identification with these traditional and Christian\nconservative movements. Also, openness to change has a\nsmall negative effect and traditionalism has a small positive\neffect on identification with these movements. Furthermore,\nabhorrence for things perceived as disgusting (a purity moral\nintuition) has a moderately strong positive effect on identifi-\ncation with these conservative movements.3\nThe third model in Table 3 explains approximately 21%\nof the variation in identification with masculinist and liber-\ntarian social movements. As Table SM6 indicates, three\nsocial and political variables account for slightly more than\nhalf of this explained variance. Lesser educated adults, less\nwealthy individuals, and conservatives report stronger iden-\ntification with these movements than do their respective\ncounterparts. In addition, a traditionalist value orientation\nand in-group loyalty (tribalism) and purity moral intuitions\neach have weak positive effects on this masculinist and liber-\ntarian movement identity. Interestingly, both ideology and\npurity have a considerably stronger influence on traditional\nand Christian movement identity than on masculinist and lib-\nertarian movement identity.\nOverall, these results provide reasonably strong evidence\nthat the measures from our social movement identity instru-\nment have construct validity (Babbie, 1995; Singleton &\nStraits, 1999). Briefly, our measures of social movement\nidentities are related to other key conceptualizations in\nAllen et al. 7\ntheoretically expected ways. Liberal ideology has a much\nstronger influence on the first two clusters (positive for pro-\ngressive movement identity and negative for traditional and\nChristian movement identity) than on the third cluster (nega-\ntive for masculinist and libertarian movement identity), con-\nfirming our expectation that this third cluster is centered\nmore on masculinity and property than on traditional politi-\ncal conservatism.\nIn addition, the strong positive effects of humanistic altru-\nism and a moral intuition of care on progressive social move-\nment identity confirm that the latter is capturing an\nother-centered concern for improving the condition of mar-\nginalized or oppressed others that is central to progressive\nsocial movements. Also, the strong positive effects of a\nmoral intuition of purity (a concern for sanctity) and religios-\nity--as well as the weak negative effect of openness to\nchange and weak positive effect of traditionalism--on tradi-\ntional and Christian movement identity confirm that the lat-\nter is representing a concern for promoting the social and\ncultural conservatism that is central to traditional and\nChristian movements.\nFurthermore, the fact that purity has a much stronger posi-\ntive effect on traditional and Christian movement identity\nthan on masculinist and libertarian movement identity con-\nfirms that the latter identity cluster is less aligned with\ntraditional conservatism, while the former identity cluster is\nmore aligned with fundamentalist moralism and nativism.\nFinally, the negative effects of socioeconomic status (educa-\ntion and income) and the positive effects of traditionalism\nand a moral intuition of in-group loyalty on masculinist and\nlibertarian movement identity confirm that the latter is tap-\nping a concern for protecting the market-based patriarchal\npower that has eroded in recent decades due to macro-level\neconomic shifts that is central to masculinist and libertarian\nmovements.\nConclusion\nWe showcased a revised version of the social movement\nidentity instrument first presented by Dunlap and McCright\n(2008) and demonstrated the efficacy of this revised instru-\nment for investigating identification with 20 major U.S.\nsocial movements. Briefly, even though scholars may use\nthis instrument to examine identification with individual\nmovements, we chose to demonstrate how this instrument\nmay help us understand identification with social movement\nfamilies. We found strong evidence of three social movement\nidentity clusters--progressive movements, traditional and\nChristian movements, and masculinist and libertarian move-\nments--that align with recognizable movement families in\nTable 3.

We also showed that our instrument cap-\ntures meaningful variation across the levels of identification\nwith these 20 social movements. Furthermore, we provided\nstrong evidence that our instrument has construct validity, as\nselected predictors explained variation in social movement\nidentities in ways expected by existing theory and previous\nresearch.\nOf course, there are opportunities for further improve-\nment of our instrument. First, to guard against overestimat-\ning active participants and active opponents, scholars could\nprovide a few examples of behaviors that would be consid-\nered active participation and active opposition. Second,\nrather than providing the name of a social movement, schol-\nars instead could provide a brief description of the movement\n(or perhaps include both). Offering a brief description may\nreduce the likelihood that respondents are influenced by\nname-related associations. Third, in many samples, it is pos-\nsible that some respondents will not have heard of some\nmovements. To accommodate this, we suggest considering\nthe addition of another response category to capture this.\nFourth, we urge scholars to use our instrument in conjunction\nwith established self-reported measures of movement behav-\niors and movement organization membership. Doing so pro-\nvides further opportunities to validate our instrument and\nadvance the social movements scholarship.\nWe end by proposing an agenda for future research that\nuses the social movement identity instrument showcased\nabove to investigate understudied rank-and-file movement\nparticipants, sympathetic adherents, and even unsympathetic\nopponents in the public. Such scholarship may complement\nthe typical strategy of analyzing key leaders of movement\norganizations or other samples of known activists. Also,\nother researchers should feel free to populate this instrument\nwith those social movements of interest to them.\nFirst, this instrument allows scholars to analyze key char-\nacteristics of individuals across different social movement\nidentity levels. Such characteristics may include beliefs\nabout movement goals, support for movement strategies,\nand trust in the responsiveness of political authorities. For\ninstance, McCright and Dunlap (2008) discover substantial\ndifferences across active participants, sympathetics, neu-\ntrals, and unsympathetics vis-\u00e0-vis the environmental move-\nment in the consistency of their beliefs about environmental\nproblems.\nSecond, administering this social movement identity\ninstrument to a nationally representative sample would allow\nscholars to examine the extent to which participation in, or\nmere support for, some movements is associated with the\nsame for other movements, helping extend earlier research\non activists' involvement with multiple movements (e.g.,\nVan Dyke, 2003). Such work should examine not only public\nsupport for and engagement with left-leaning social move-\nments but also should examine the same for right-leaning\nmovements, which tend to be understudied in the social\nmovements literature. Furthermore, scholars may use this\ninstrument in work examining how citizens across the left-\nright political spectrum differentially consume and contrib-\nute to politically framed, movement-related social media.\nThird, including this social movement identity instrument in\npanel surveys would allow us to monitor the extent to which\ncitizens' participation in, support for, or opposition to social\nmovements vary over time, complementing Minkoff (1997).\nIndeed, merging such survey data with relevant contextual data\non, for example, movement-related media coverage or the\npresence of elite allies and opponents would facilitate analyses\nof how different contextual factors influence social movement\nidentity across space and over time. Finally, this instrument\nenables an examination of the social, political, and cultural\nbases of social movement identities among the general public.\nThis would allow us to investigate the breadth or narrowness of\nsupport for or opposition to different movements and whether\nsuch support or opposition diffuses to a broader base over time.\n"
