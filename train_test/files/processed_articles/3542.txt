Continuing professional educa-\ntion (CPE) and other developmental opportunities are com-\nmonly used to address these challenges and have been linked\nto improvements in HCP performance and patient health\n(Forsetlund et al., 2009). Research shows, however, that\nCPE activities differ in their ability to increase HCP's com-\npetence and performance, and have inconsistent effects on\npatient health outcomes (Marinopoulos et al., 2007).\nA variety of factors affect whether a CPE trainee is able to\napply new knowledge and skills acquired during training to\ntheir clinical practice, a concept commonly referred to as\nknowledge translation (KT; Davis et al., 2003; Graham et al.,\ndefines KT (also called knowledge transfer, training transfer,\nand implementation) as \"the synthesis, exchange, and applica-\ntion of knowledge by relevant stakeholders to accelerate the\nbenefits of global and local innovation in strengthening health\nsystems and improving people's health\" (Landry, Amara,\ndifficult to measure, KT is often the sought outcome of CPE\nevents.\nResearch points to three main areas that influence whether\ntranslation occurs: (a) trainee characteristics, (b) training char-\nacteristics, and (c) organizational characteristics (Aguinis &\nRoche, Pidd, & Freeman, 2009). Notably missing in the litera-\nture is the trainer's role in facilitating KT. Although leading\nscholars have hypothesized that ineffective trainers can lead to\nTannenbaum & Yukl, 1992), few studies have explored the\nrelationship between trainer attributes and trainee KT.\nConsidering most trainers acquire their training-related skills\non the job (Bunch, 2007) and there are few formal programs to\nbecome a CPE trainer, we argue that to improve the efficacy of\ntraining programs, it is essential to understand trainer attri-\nbutes and actions that lead to or hinder KT.\n1University of California San Francisco, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKevin Khamarko, University of California San Francisco, 50 Beale Street,\nEmail: kevin.khamarko@ucsf.edu\nDeveloping Effective Clinical\nTrainers: Strategies to Enhance\nKnowledgeTranslation\nKevin Khamarko1, Kimberly A.

This is accomplished through a nationwide\nnetwork of 11 regional centers, 5 national centers, and over\n130 local performance sites. TheAETCs have trained more than\n1 million HCPs over the last two decades (Health Resources\nnurses (33%) and physicians (17%) working primarily in\nhospital/hospital-based clinics (20%), community health\ncenters (12%), and community-based organizations (8%).\nGiven the volume of trainings the AETCs provide and\ntheir potential impact on health care outcomes, evaluation of\nKT in relation to these programs is important. In comparison\nto the estimate that not more than 15% of what trainees learn\nAETC trainees report changes in practice behavior following\ntraining (Bashook et al., 2010). This finding suggests that\nAETCs may be especially successful in assisting their train-\nees implement new knowledge and skills. The current study\nwas designed to understand how AETC clinical trainers sup-\nport trainees during the translation process. The main objec-\ntive of this study was to identify strategies trainers use to\nincrease the likelihood of KT.\nMethods\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with AETC clinical\ntrainers to explore strategies employed to assist trainees in\nthe translation process. To obtain our sample, we contacted\nregional AETC program directors to describe the study and\nrequest they nominate four of their regional clinical train-\ners. The recruitment criteria required that participants be\n(a) a physician, an advanced practice nurse, a registered\nnurse, a physician's assistant, a dentist, or a pharmacist; (b)\na core AETC trainer with more than 3 years of training\ndelivery experience; and (c) experienced in developing\ntraining curriculum. Two of the nominated clinical trainers\nfrom each region were selected at random to receive an\nemail describing the project and asking for their participa-\ntion. We then followed up with each trainer to schedule an\ninterview.\nAll participants were interviewed between December\nphone by one of the first two authors using a semistructured\ninterview guide. Participants were asked to explain how they\nprepared for training events, to describe aspects of trainings\nthat worked well for audiences, and to provide examples of\nhow they assisted trainees with implementation issues.\nInterviews lasted approximately 1 hr and were audio recorded\nand transcribed. Participation was voluntary; respondents\nwere asked to provide informed verbal consent using\nprocedures approved by the University of California San\nFrancisco Committee for Human Research.\nResearchers took extensive notes during interviews and\ndiscussed their initial observations following each interview.\nAdjustments to the interview protocol were made during\nthese conversations to ensure sufficient probing on key\nresearch domains. In addition, emerging themes and direc-\ntions were documented to aid in the development of a coding\nframework. The first three authors read a cross-section of\ninterviews to identify an initial set of analytic codes. This\npreliminary codebook was applied to a second set of inter-\nviews; codes were further modified and clarified through\nteam discussions. After several revisions to the preliminary\ncodes, the final codebook was applied to the entire data set.\nThe coded data were entered into Atlas.ti\u00a9, a qualitative\nresearch software program used to organize data. The char-\nacteristics of the major themes were identified and explored.\nResults\nOur sample had representation from 10 of the 11 regional\nAETCs. Among the nominated clinical trainers, the overall\nextensive experience in both providing direct HIV care to\npatients (M = 20 years) and delivering training to clinicians\n(M = 19 years). The sample consisted of nine physicians,\nthree advanced practice nurses, three registered nurses, and\none pharmacist.\nMultiple themes emerged on common techniques that\ntrainers use to assist trainees in the KT process. Based on\nthe findings presented below, we constructed a framework\n(see Figure 1) that represents a continuing sequence of\nKT-enhancing strategies for utilization by program planners.\nThe figure illustrates that in addition to having excellent\ncommunication and facilitation skills, trainers must also con-\nduct supplemental activities to enhance KT.\nStrategiesThat Enhance Knowledge\nTranslation\nIn advance of training, identify needs within the clinical setting\nand among trainees. In general, participants stated that the\nmethods and activities used to assist trainees differ depend-\ning on the topic and intensity of training. Participants empha-\nsized the importance of determining the training scope prior\nto the event. Respondents recommended that trainings focus\non identified professional practice gaps and involve all\nstakeholders during initial planning activities. When describ-\ning how trainings take shape, one participant stated,\nFor the last couple of years, we haven't held a large\nconference here but have actually been going out and\ndoing site visits and trainings based on what we have\nassessed their [trainees] needs to be . . . because they\nwere all at different levels of capacity in treating HIV.\n(Nurse Trainer)\nKhamarko et al. 3\nAlmost all participants felt that familiarizing themselves\nwith the target audience, trainees' work environments, and\nclinic leadership was a vital step. Participants described a\nnumber of methods used to gather this information, ranging\nfrom needs assessments to site visits and discussions with\ntrainees. This information was a necessary component in the\ncreation of training events that led to KT, as noted by the\nparticipant below:\nOverall, the ones that don't go well are those where I\ndon't have a good feel for the audience: who they are,\nwhat professions they are, what the barriers are in their\nhospital, what kind of people they're seeing--the\nthing about not knowing your audience. I think when\nI go in and try to talk to people without really knowing\nwhat their practice setting is, I feel like I'm talking to\na blank wall cause I don't know if I'm saying what\nthey need to hear or addressing their barriers.\n(Physician Trainer)\nEngage stakeholders in the training process and identify con-\nducive training environments. Most participants thought train-\nees needed support from clinic leadership to implement\ntraining concepts, particularly if these concepts required\npolicy changes or reallocating resources. Participants\ndescribed the process of gaining buy-in from key stakehold-\ners as a best practice for ensuring KT. This process often\nentailed direct communication with clinic leadership and\nstaff on the value of implementing specific clinic policies\nand procedures. Participants also recommended that clinic\nleaders attend trainings to increase their understanding of\nparticular issues and to demonstrate their commitment to\nimproved care.\nYou need buy-in if you're going to change a system\nand that certainly doesn't apply to all trainings. If you\nwant systems change, then you need the players to be\nthe ones that can actually effect change. (Physician\nTrainer)\nInterviewees recommended holding trainings in clinical\nenvironments or settings favorable to training as a factor that\ninfluences the success of training. Nearly all participants told\nus that on-site training (i.e., in trainees' workplaces) was the\nmost effective environment for clinical training. Respondents\nnoted that on-site training promoted relationship building,\nallowed for highly relevant content to be discussed, and\nallowed trainers to observe the clinical environment and\naddress barriers. Although on-site training did not guarantee\nthat KT would occur, it provided trainers with numerous\nopportunities to enhance training plans.\nTailor training design and content to target audience. Respon-\ndents recommended tailoring trainings, which required that\ntrainers take trainees' professional practice gaps, profes-\nsional roles, and work environments into account when\ndeveloping training curricula. This allowed for the incorpo-\nration of content most applicable to trainees. The incorpora-\ntion of case-based discussions was also a common trainer\ntechnique that helped make trainings salient to trainees.\nMany participants felt that tailoring improved training out-\ncomes, including a pharmacist trainer that stated, \"I think it\nwent well because we knew the audience; we knew specifi-\ncally what they wanted. They gave us specific questions and\nwe were able to tailor the presentation to that and conse-\nquently the feedback was excellent.\"\nIn addition to developing thoughtful curricula, it was\nequally important to create \"actionable\" products for train-\nees. Some respondents created easy to understand tools and\nprovided reference materials for use during KT. The follow-\ning quote illustrates this strategy:\nPeople had a lot of trouble with anal cytologies until I\nstarted incorporating into my presentation an actual\nvideo of myself doing an anal exam on a patient. I did\nit in real life, my clinic, my patient and then had my\npatient come with me [to training] and actually say not\nonly was that me you saw, but I'm here to tell you that\nit wasn't painful, it wasn't uncomfortable, I under-\nstood why it was being done and it was important.\n(Physician Trainer)\nCreate dynamic training activities. Participants were able to\nprovide a variety of examples on how to create an effective\ntraining leading to KT. Most of these examples included\nactivities (role-play, small group exercises, and teach backs)\nIdenfy Needs of\nTrainees\nEngage\nStakeholders in\nTraining Process\nTailor Training to\nAudience Needs\nIncorporate\nEngaging Acvies\ninto Training\nProvide Post-\nTraining Support\nCommunicaon\n& Facilitaon\nSkills\nFigure 1. Sequence of knowledge translation\u00adenhancing\nstrategies\n4 SAGE Open\nthat made trainees think about both the training content and\nits intended implementation. The majority of respondents\nconsidered the incorporation of interactive skills-building\nactivities to positively influence the training environment. A\nphysician trainer touched on this when stating, \"what made it\n[training] go well is that the design of the training included a\nwide variety of different kinds of activities and modules so\nas to match different learning needs of people.\"\nAnother recommendation involved devoting time during\ntraining for participants to do \"real work\" (e.g., practice\nadministering and interpreting rapid HIV test results). Many\nparticipants also suggested trainers build informal time into\ntrainings, for casual discussions, and leave time at end for\ntrainees to discuss specific cases individually. The following\nquote illustrates the value of informal time:\nThe best part of the training: you give your lecture and\nit's all well and then one or two people hang out after-\nwards and ask you about a specific patient or say, \"I\ntried to get our doc to do that but they wouldn't do it.\"\nSometimes those conversations you have before and\nafterwards are much more fruitful in some ways,\nbecause you are hearing their specific issues and\nyou're able to respond to that instead of just down-\nloading information. So that's a good training tip,\nalways leave yourself time to hang out afterwards and\ntell people, \"I'm happy to stay and talk to you about\nthese things or I'd love to tour your clinic and talk to\nyour staff.\" (Physician Trainer)\nCommunicate clearly and be flexible in facilitation. Trainer\ncharacteristics (i.e., approach to training and behavior) influ-\nence all stages of the training process. Participants described\ntraining events that required trainers with strong communi-\ncation skills who were also adept, flexible, and approachable\nduring the trainings. Some participants provided examples of\ntrainings with audiences that were different from what they\nprepared for (e.g., training social workers on drug interac-\ntions); in these cases, it was important for trainers to be able\nto gauge the audiences' needs and to be flexible in the deliv-\nery of training content. Trainer's willingness to allow for\ntrainee-directed learning (i.e., trainer allows audience to\nsteer training based on their needs) was also identified as a\nKT-enhancing strategy. This concept is described in the fol-\nlowing physician trainer quote, \"so it really turned into an\neffective training session because people were focusing on\nthe things they wanted to learn; not so much what we thought\nthey wanted to learn.\"\nSome participants noted a distinction between the skills\nrequired to facilitate a didactic presentation and those\nrequired to deliver a skills-building workshop. Most partici-\npants stated that skills-building trainings were more effective\nthan didactic presentations, primarily because they require\nmore active involvement from trainees. These sessions also\nrequire more effort by skillful trainers, as described by the\nfollowing participant:\nIts [interactive, skills-building training] definitely\nmore demanding . . . I could be sick as a dog and still\ngive a lecture from the power points, but the facilita-\ntion piece involves being able to be both thinking\nabout your content and listening to what they're [train-\nees] saying, analyzing it, reflecting on it and translat-\ning it for the other participants. It's a much more\ncomplicated mental task. (Physician Trainer)\nProvide post-training support. Many participants discussed\nthe importance of the implementation process not ending\nafter the training event is conducted. \"It doesn't just end with\nthe training,\" one participant said. Participants developed a\nvariety of techniques to keep trainees connected to the train-\ning topic. Participants described how they followed up with\ntrainees and clinic leadership to gauge whether training was\nbeing implemented effectively and how they could further\nassist. Some participants maintained relationships with train-\nees or clinics and continued to discuss cases related to the\ntraining topics. Implementing policy changes required the\nmost post-training support and required time investments by\nclinics and trainers. In addition, some participants estab-\nlished coaching relationships with trainees and developed\nKT action plans. This excerpt illustrates one participant's\nthoughts on coaching:\nSo it's breaking the change down. We help coach\nthem. It's very much like the gym; it's not that the\ntrainer teaches you anything new, it's that you have a\ncommitment to each other and someone's bugging you\nabout it. Nagging you, creative, gentle, kind nagging\nis actually a major part of the coaching phenomenon.\n(Physician Trainer)\nIn addition to follow-up support, participants also talked\nabout the benefits of building strong working relationships\nwith trainees. Some participants worked in settings where\neveryone knew each other; sometimes this allowed for easier\naccess into clinics and feeling well connected to potential\ntrainees. Some trainers used the \"adopt-a-clinic\" model,\nwhereas others worked to establish longitudinal programs,\nwhere a continuum of training was provided over time. In the\nabsence of longitudinal training, participants suggested pro-\nviding refreshers/booster sessions to trainees. A physician\ntrainer illustrates this when stating,\nYou need to go longitudinal, so you can go back and\nsay, \"Did it work? Didn't it work?\" If you just give it\n[training] to them and leave, you don't know whether\nthey were able to transfer it or not.\nDiscussion\nThe literature on KT suggests that aspects of the trainee,\ntraining, and organizational setting influence transfer. Key\ntrainer characteristics are often subsumed under the training\nKhamarko et al. 5\ncategory, thus making it difficult to understand the discrete\nrole trainers play in the KT process. The current study\nexplored how clinical trainers design trainings that facilitate\nKT. The findings from this study highlight the difficulties\ninvolved in achieving KT and emphasize the responsibilities\nof trainers in this process. We identified a variety of strate-\ngies trainers can employ to increase the likelihood of KT.\nThese activities should be tailored to the audience and may\ndiffer depending on the topic and intensity of training.\nCreating an effective training--one leading to KT--requires\nactive planning, communication, and command of the train-\ning topic. In addition, trainers must be familiar with the\ntrainees' work environments, be able to identify their knowl-\nedge deficits, and devote time to provide trainees with post-\ntraining support.\nOur study identified five strategies, in addition to adept\ncommunication and facilitation skills, which increased the\nlikelihood of KT among trainees (see Figure 1). The first strat-\negy consists of identifying trainees'professional practice gaps,\na concept consistent with principle guidelines outlined by the\nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (www.\nacgme.org). The second strategy involves the process of\nengaging stakeholders and obtaining buy-in from clinic lead-\nership on training concepts. This is an important step, as front-\nline staff and leadership may have different perceptions of\ntheir clinics' needs, and obtaining supervisory support has\nbeen widely supported in influencing KT (Blume, Ford,\n2011). The above strategies yield information about trainees\nand their work environments, which is required to tailor train-\nings to the audiences' needs, our third strategy. In addition to\nmaking the training salient to the audience, our sample recom-\nmended the incorporation of interactive activities that both\nengaged the audience and kept them focused on the applica-\ntion of training concepts. The final recommendation centers\non providing support to trainees after training events, a strat-\negy not yet employed by all trainers in our sample.\nTrainers described the aforementioned techniques and\ntheir influence on KT in detail but acknowledged that the\nactivities require both time and rapport building with train-\nees and their clinics. Overall, our participants noted the\nimportance of conducting specific activities both before\n(e.g., collecting data on trainees and their needs) and after\n(e.g., following up with trainees and helping to resolve KT\nbarriers encountered) the training, but these activities were\nnot easily implemented. For example, an effective training is\nformed with the main objective in mind (e.g., increasing anal\ncytology screening), but this means the trainer needs to con-\nsider all components that could lead to successful KT, rang-\ning from details on the screening method, to billing, and\npatient education. Most trainers were not able to invest this\nlevel of effort for all of their trainings; some trainers focused\nonly on the training event itself.\nAlthough this study identified valuable teaching and sup-\nport strategies, it was not without limitations. A purposeful\nsample of experienced trainers was recruited for participa-\ntion, which may have led to sampling bias. Purposeful sam-\npling was used as a method to allow for the selection of\ninformation-rich cases from which in-depth knowledge\nabout the phenomenon being studied could be gained (Patton,\n2002). Although AETC directors nominated potential par-\nticipants, individuals on the list were contacted at random\nwith emphasis on representation from all regional AETCs.\nThe sample recruited included both seasoned and newer\ntrainers from diverse professional backgrounds.\nOur study shows that some trainers strongly believe in the\nvalue of coaching trainees and providing follow-up support\nafter training events. However, more research needs to be\ndone to evaluate the outcomes associated with post-training\nactivities. Furthermore, we are uncertain of whether follow-\nup support is widespread among AETC trainers and whether\nthe AETC program structure is sufficient to sustain or\nencourage this level of effort. The findings from this study\nprovide insight into important strategies for developing\neffective clinical trainers. Program planners, trainers, and\nmanagers can use the lessons from this study to increase the\nlikelihood that training will result in improvements in care.\nAuthors' Note\nFebruary 22, 2014) by the University of California San Francisco's\nCommittee on Human Research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nproject is supported by a grant from the Health Resources Services\nReferences\nAguinis, H., & Kraiger, K.
