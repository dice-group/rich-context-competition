This impair-\nment is common, and nearly 19.0% of\nindividuals aged >65 years are affected.\nCompared with older individuals with\nnormal cognition, patients with MCI have\na three- to five-times higher risk of develop-\ning Alzheimer's disease (AD). Petersen's\ncriteria are frequently used to divide MCI\ninto two groups: the amnestic (aMCI) and\nnon-amnestic (naMCI) forms. Interestingly,\naMCI is associated with frequent memory\nloss and progression to AD.1\u00ad3 However,\npatients with naMCI develop memory loss\nas well as other cognitive issues, including\nLewy body dementia. Both types can be\nsubcategorized; in the present study, how-\never, we did not perform subcategorization\nbecause of the limited sample size.4,5 While\nthe US Food and Drug Administration has\napproved several medications for the treat-\nment of AD, no medications have been\napproved for patients with MCI.6\nThe importance of the glutamatergic\nN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\nin memory and learning processes is well\nrecognized. Memantine, a low-affinity non-\ncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, is\nthe only glutamatergic drug approved for\nthe treatment of moderate to severe cogni-\ntive symptoms of AD. Recent studies have\nshown that memantine can also reduce the\nlevels of amyloid b peptides, which inhibit\nthe amyloid b oligomer and improve cogni-\ntive performance.7,8 Memantine can usually\nbe used in addition to acetylcholinesterase\ninhibitors in patients with AD9 Interestingly,\nmemantine treatment results in slight benefi-\ncial effects on memory, activities of daily\nliving, and behavior.\nWe conducted a prospective open-label\nstudy to test the hypothesis that the anti-\nglutamatergic activity of memantine can\nimprove cognitive functioning. Patients\nwith aMCI were treated with and without\nmemantine and compared using neuro-\npsychiatric tests and single-photon emission\ncomputed tomography (SPECT).\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants\nThe present study was a 48-week, open-label\nextension study involving 45 patients diag-\nnosed with aMCI and 30 healthy controls\nwho were consecutively examined at the\nMemory and Dementia Outpatient Clinic\nof our neurology department.\nVolunteers who responded to the adver-\ntisements for this study underwent a multi-\nstage screening procedure. The inclusion\ncriteria were an age of >55 years (with the\nexception of seven individuals aged 55\u00ad68\nyears); availability of an informant who\ncould provide information about the partici-\npant's daily function; absence of significant\nunderlying medical, neurological, or psychi-\natric illness; and willingness to participate in\nthe study procedures. All patients were\nrequired to be either cognitively normal or\nmildly impaired, but without dementia; that\nis, they were required to have a Clinical\nDementia Rating (CDR) of either 0.0 or 0.5.\nAll patients with MCI experienced\nmemory that deviated from their previous\nnormal function. We based the diagnosis of\naMCI on the following criteria established\nby the International Working Group on\nMild Cognitive Impairment10:\nAll participants were evaluated for\ndepression using the 15-item short version\nof the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),\nin which a total score of >5 indicates\ndepression. Neuropsychological testing was\nIn total, 75 participants were included in\npatients diagnosed with aMCI who received\nmemantine. They initially received meman-\ntine at 5 mg once daily, and this was\nincreased weekly by 5 mg/day in divided\ndoses to a total dosage of 20 mg/day.\nGroup 2 comprised patients diagnosed with\naMCI who received no treatment. Group 3\ncomprised healthy controls without aMCI.\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows:\nprobable or possible AD; the presence of\nother neurodegenerative conditions, such as\nparkinsonian, frontal, vascular, or meta-\nbolic dementia; a history or diagnosis of\nother neurologic diseases, such as stroke or\nhydrocephalus; a primary psychiatric diag-\nnosis, such as depression or schizophrenia;\nthe presence of sedating medications at\nthe time of testing; and a metabolic or\nsystemic disorder that might influence cog-\nnitive performance.\nAll participants underwent magnetic\nresonance imaging or brain computed\ntomography examinations, medical and\nneurological examinations, and neuropsy-\nchological testing by the same researchers.\nThe following laboratory tests for dementia\nwere requested: complete blood counts,\nblood chemistry, serum vitamin B12 and\nfolic acid levels, thyroid function tests, and\nsyphilis serology.\nSPECT was performed at baseline and at\n48 weeks in patients receiving memantine\ntreatment.\nNeuropsychological tests\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination\n(MMSE)11 was applied to all patients and\ncontrols by an experienced neurologist to\nevaluate the status of cognitive decline. All\npatients underwent neuropsychiatric evalu-\nation including the digit span (forward and\nback), Wechsler Memory Scale subtests\n(immediate word recall list, delayed word\nrecall, delayed word recognition, visual\ncopy, and visual memory),12 Wechsler\nAdult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R)\nvocabulary subtest, Boston Naming Test\nfluency, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale\n(BDRS),15 Instrumental Activities of Daily\nThe same person implemented the neuro-\npsychological tests for all patients. Sessions\nwere conducted in the morning in a quiet\nPerfusion SPECT imaging\nRegional cerebral blood flow was studied at\nbaseline using SPECT. Patients received an\ninjection of technetium-99 m ethyl cysteinate\ndimer and rested for 1 h in a quiet environ-\nment with their eyes closed. SPECT image\nacquisitions were performed using a double-\nhead rotating gamma camera (Siemens)\nequipped with a fan beam collimator.\nSPECT was carried out at baseline and at\n48 weeks in patients receiving memantine\ntreatment.\nSemantic memory\nWAIS-R, word list memory, and recall. Semantic\nmemory was assessed with the WAIS-R and\nword list memory recall. Free recall and\nrecognition were assessed with a word list\ncomprising 10 unrelated concrete nouns.\nUnit-weighted composite scores were com-\nputed based on vocabulary and general\nknowledge tasks.\nEthics statement\nAll patient examinations were conducted in\nfull compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.\nAll patients were informed before providing\nwritten consent, and the local ethics commit-\ntee approved the research.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nThe Shapiro\u00adWilk test was used to verify\ndata normality assumptions. For normally\ndistributed data, the paired sample t-test and\none-way analysis of variance were used\nfor further analyses. For non-normally dis-\ntributed data, the Wilcoxon t-test and\nKruskal\u00adWallis test were used. For multiple\ncomparisons, Dunn's method and Tukey's\ntest were performed. A p-value of <0.05 was\nconsidered significant.\nMultiple linear regression analysis was\nperformed to identify independent associ-\nations of the cerebral SPECT values by\nincluding the parameters correlated with\ncerebral SPECT perfusion in the bivariate\nanalysis. Standardized b regression coeffi-\ncients and their significance according to the\nmultiple linear regression analysis were\nreported. A p-value of <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nDemographic data of all participants,\nincluding age, sex, educational status, and\nhand dominance, are summarized in\nTable 1. There was no significant difference\namong the three groups.\nNo significant differences were observed\nin any scores between Groups 1 and 2.\nHowever, there was a significant difference\nin the neuropsychiatric test scores between\nthe patient groups and control group.\nAt baseline, significant differences in calcu-\nlation, word list memory-3, word list recall,\nWAIS-R, backward digit span, and BDRS\nscores were observed between the patient\nand control groups (p < 0.05) (Table 2).\nAt week 12, Group 1 had significantly\nimproved scores on the MMSE, word list\nmemory-2, word list recall, BNT, and CDR\ncompared with Group 3. Improvement in\nthe MMSE score was observed in Group 1,\nwhile no significant improvement was found\nin Groups 2 and 3 compared with baseline.\nWord list recall scores were increased in all\ngroups, especially Group 1. Interestingly, a\nstatistically significant advancement was\nobserved for the calculation scores in\nGroups 1 and 2. The BNT and BDRS\nscores were significantly improved only in\nThe MMSE scores were higher at week 24\nthan at week 12 in Groups 1 and 2. At week\n24, Group 1 showed significantly higher\nscores for word list memory-3, word list\nrecall, WAIS-R, backward digit span,\nBDRS, and GDS compared with baseline.\nGroup 2 showed a statistically significant\ndecrease in verbal fluency scores at week 24\n(Table 3).\nAt week 48, the significant increase in\nthe word list memory-3, word list recall,\nWAIS-R, backward digit span, BDRS, and\nGDS scores continued. No differences were\nobserved in the other test scores among the\nthree groups (Table 3).\nSemantic memory composite Z-score\nZ-scores were measured for the WAIS-R\nand word list recall test, which were used\nfor semantic memory. The scores were\nTable 1.

Detection of AD\nat a very early time point would enable early\nintervention and a timely start of therapy,\npossibly preventing disease progression.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors have long\naccounted for a majority of the treat-\nments administered for MCI; this trend\nfollows the cholinergic hypotheses.21\u00ad23\nAnother approach that is widely accepted\n(at least as widely accepted as the histo-\npathogenesis of AD) is the glutaminergic\nhypothesis, which is related to the increased\neffect of glutamate.24 The discovery that the\ntoxic effect of glutamatergic neurotransmis-\nsion is present in the very early phases of the\ndisease brought modulatory treatments up\nTable 4.

In the present study, we examined\nthe effects of memantine on neuropsycho-\nlogical measures for aMCI, improvements\nin which could be mediated by a neuron-\nprotective effect of memantine.\nThe current use of memantine aims to\ntreat cognitive and behavioral disorders in\npatients with mild to moderately severe AD\nand mild to moderate vascular dementia.\nNo pharmacological agents have obtained\nregulatory approval for the treatment or\nprevention of these disorders. A review of\npublished clinical trials indicated that early\ntreatment of hypertension, a risk factor for\nstroke, reduces the risk of vascular dementia\nand slows its progression.25 Because neur-\nonal damage begins in the preclinical phase\nof the disease, it is believed that neuron-\nprotective treatments should be initiated at\nvery early stages.\nThe enhancing effects of NMDA recep-\ntor antagonists on cerebral blood flow\nhave been demonstrated in experimental\nischemic models. In a study of the efficacy\nof memantine on neuroimaging, glucose\nmetabolism decreased to a lesser degree in\nThis finding supports the functional and\nneuroprotective efficacy of memantine.\nIncreased perfusion in the posterior parietal\narea, which affects attention and memory as\nshown by cerebral SPECT studies, has been\nobserved in patients with AD treated with\ndonepezil. Studies using functional imaging\ntechniques have suggested that semantic\nmemory impairment, which occurs relatively\nearly in the course of AD, is caused by\nneural degeneration in the areas of associ-\nation in the lateral and inferior temporal\nCurrently, no drugs are specifically per-\nmitted by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration for MCI.31 Because aMCI\nmay be associated with AD, drug therapies\ntargeting AD may be help to manage\nMCI.32\u00ad34 In one study, the combined treat-\nment of galantamine and memantine had\ncognitive benefits in the short term, and\ncognitive decline occurred after discontinu-\nation of galantamine.35,36 Although various\nstudies have examined donepezil, rivastig-\nmine, and galantamine alone or combination\nwith memantine, reliable data on the influ-\nence of memantine alone in the treatment of\naMCI are lacking.\nIn one related study involving 270 amne-\nsic patients with MCI, Salloway et al.37\ninvestigated the effectiveness of donepezil\non memory loss by comparison with a\nplacebo group. Although donepezil treat-\nment was not strong enough to affect pure\nmemory test scores (a primary scale of\nefficacy), it had positive effects on attention,\nconcentration, and psychomotor speed.38,39\nOther similar studies have suggested that\ndonepezil treatment improves logical\nmemory at week 24. In a study investigating\nthe role of galantamine in patients with\nMCI, global rating scales improved and\nADAS-cog subscale scores decreased after\n6 weeks at all dose levels.40 In another study\nby Pelton et al.,41 35 patients received anti-\ndepressant and memantine treatment, which\nwas found to be effective on cognition. The\ndementia conversion rate was significantly\nlower than in the control group.\nIn the present study, the recognition,\nword list memory and recall, WAIS vocabu-\nlary subtest, BDRS, and GDS scores\ndiffered between memantine-treated patients\nand controls; these scores decreased until\nthey normalized at week 48. Similar results\nwere observed for the MMSE and glo-\nbal assessment scale, for which the scores\nin memantine-treated patients increased at\nweek 48 and the significant differences in the\nscores between these patients and the con-\ntrols were no longer present. These results\nsuggest that 48 weeks of memantine treat-\nment improved patient functioning until\ntheir scores were comparable with those of\nthe healthy controls, whereas this was not\nthe case for patients with untreated aMCI.\nIndeed, no change was observed in the\nglobal cognitive and functional scales of the\npatients with untreated aMCI. However, the\nmemory test results showed improvement.\nThe fact that fewer significant between-\ngroup differences were apparent over time\nbetween the patients not receiving meman-\ntine and the control group suggests that\nmemory functions improved over time in the\nformer. We found that patients not treated\nwith memantine showed a deterioration of\nthe GDS score. Therefore, memantine may\nreduce the risk of depression.\nSemantic memory deficits are frequently\nseen in patients with AD, even in the early\nphase, but not necessarily in patients in the\npredementia state, as in aMCI. In the present\nstudy, we observed a significant improvement\nin the WAIS-R, word list memory, and recall\ntest used to evaluate semantic memory at 48\nweeks in patients who received memantine.\nMemantine is a noncompetitive recep-\ntor antagonist, and it delays the process\nof dementia by preventing the patho-\nlogical activation of NMDA receptors.\nIts neuroprotective effects have been dis-\nplayed in various neurological disorders.\nImportantly, memantine reportedly reduces\nthe release of proinflammatory factors in\nIn patients with aMCI, pathologic\ndamage first occurs in the medial temporal\nstructures, mainly the entorhinal cortex,\nwhich causes episodic memory deficits.44\nThe present study showed a significant posi-\ntive correlation between semantic memory\nand SPECT perfusion of the right inferior\ntemporal region in patients receiving mem-\nantine. This finding may be due to the\nneuroprotective effects of memantine therapy\nin patients with aMCI.\nRamaswamy et al.45 observed improve-\nment in memory, core symptoms of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and depression in\ncombat veterans with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder after open-label treatment with\nmemantine. One limitation of the present\nstudy is the relatively small number of\nparticipants. The low prevalence of aMCI\nrestricted our ability to include a greater\nnumber of individuals. Another limitation is\nthe duration of the study. A longer-term\nstudy would have allowed us to better\nobserve the efficacy of memantine and deter-\nmine which patients did and did not develop\nprogression to AD or dementia.\nWe found a significant increase in the\nWAIS vocabulary subtest score when evaluat-\ning language functions and semantic memory\nin our study. SPECT revealed cerebral hyper-\nperfusion in the right inferior temporal region\nin the memantine-treated patients before and\n48 weeks after the start of treatment.\nIn conclusion, neuropsychological tests\nand cerebral SPECT imaging showed that\nmemantine may be effective in improving the\nsemantic memory of patients with aMCI.\nMemantine may inhibit oxidative stress and\ninflammation during the early stage of the\ndisease. The optimal treatment for patients\nwith MCI is controversial. Importantly,\nhowever, our study has shown that meman-\ntine can be used for initial therapy of MCI.\nFuture studies should further investigate this\ntopic by including greater sample sizes and\nperforming long-term follow-up.\nEthics and consent\nOur Clinical Research Ethics Committee\nAll patients provided written informed consent.\nConsent for publication\nConsent for publication was obtained from all\nauthors.\nData and materials availability\nThe dataset was available for all authors of the\nstudy.\n"
