    "abstract": "Abstract: Many studies have reported that during high fertility points in the menstrual\ncycle, women demonstrate increased preference for men with masculinized faces and\nbodies. In this study, we analyzed whether appetitive aggression in men serves as an\nadditional signal for a favored partner choice. Appetitive aggression describes the intrinsic\nmotivation to act violently even when not being threatened. This study evaluated the\nresponses of 1212 women to one of four descriptions regarding a soldier\u00b4s experience after\nreturning from war. The four vignettes included trauma related symptoms with high or low\nappetitive aggression, or no trauma related symptoms with high or low appetitive\naggression. Participants rated their desirability for the soldier in regards to potential long-\nterm and short-term relationships. Results indicate that women preferred a soldier high in\nappetitive aggression as a short-term mate but not as a long-term relationship. This\npreference for the \"warrior\" was higher for women in their fertile window of the menstrual\ncycle. We conclude that women in their fertile window prefer men exhibiting higher\nappetitive aggression as a short-term partner, revealing appetitive aggression in men may\nserve as a signal for a higher genetic fitness.\n",

Conan, what is best in life?\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\nConan: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the\nlamentations of their women!\nKhitan General: [Cheers]...That is good.\n(From the movie: \"Conan the Barbarian\", 1982)\nEvolution may have favored those who go to war (Elbert, Weierstall, and Schauer,\n2010; Jones, 2008). If so, it is reasonable to assume that the partner preference of women\nmight have been decisive in this process. Indeed, it has frequently been noted that women\ncan be interested in \"bad boys\" (Urbaniak and Kilmann, 2006), dominant men (Sadalla,\nKenrick, and Vershure, 1987), or self-confident men in uniform (Hewitt and German,\n1987). The parental investment of women is significantly higher than the investment of\nmen (Trivers, 1972). Therefore, women need to be selective when choosing a mating\npartner. Apart from a man's resources, his signals of good gene quality (i.e., heritable\nfitness) are essential in the selection process. Facial and body symmetry and a variety of\nmasculine physical and behavioral traits constitute male signals of good heritable condition\n(Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). For example, women find males with deeper voices\n(Feinberg, Jones, Little, Burt, and Perrett, 2005), muscular bodies (Frederick and Haselton,\n2007) and dominant behavior more attractive (Sadalla et al., 1987). However, the\npreferences also depend on the time perspective of the relationship: Women maximize their\nreproductive success if they choose a more masculine man as a short-term mate and a man\nwith a relatively more feminine face and a warmer, more agreeable personality (Fink and\nPenton-Voak, 2002) as a stable long-term partner (Kruger, 2006). Consequently, men with\nmore masculine faces and bodies (Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Rhodes, Simmons, and\nPeters, 2005) and more dominant behavior (Snyder, Kirkpatrick, and Barrett, 2008) have\ngreater success in short-term, but not in long-term, mating. Men who are warm, kind and\nwilling to invest considerable resources in their offspring are preferred as long-term mates\n(Li, Bailey, Kenrick, and Linsenmeier, 2002). Utilization of this worthwhile strategy results\nin both better genes in terms of assertiveness and more dynamic provision for the offspring.\nArcher and Thanzami (2009) found in a sample of Indian men that young males who\nperceive themselves as more attractive to women are more aggressive. Aggressive behavior\ncomes in two different types, a reactive\u00adimpulsive form which is thought to counter threat\nand an appetitive form which results from the intrinsic rewarding properties of cues related\nto violence, hunting, and combat (Elbert et al., 2010; Weierstall, Schaal, Schalinski,\nDusingizemung, and Elbert, 2011). Appetitive aggression is thus \"motivated out of itself\nfrom hunt and power: it is the aggression of the considerate aggressor, the hunter, the one\nin power and it is the form of aggression hitherto seldom scientifically examined.\"\n(Allwood, Bell-Dolan, and Husain, 2002; Elbert et al., 2010). We predict that appetitive\naggressiveness may signal heritable fitness in men. Therefore, we expect for women to\nprefer men with sizeable scores in appetitive aggression as short-term, but not long-term,\nmates.\nIn line with the aspect of reproduction, women's mate preferences change across the\nmenstrual cycle, and they are more selective during estrus than during other points in the\nmenstrual cycle. During their fertile period, women may particularly attend to men with\nsignals of \"good genes\" and select them as a short-term mate as opposed to a stable, long-\nterm partner (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). For example, women in their fertile window\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\nshow differences in preferences when compared to women at non-fertile moments in their\ncycles. Such differences include a preference for the scent of highly dominant men\n(Havlicek, Roberts, and Flegr, 2005), more masculine male faces (Johnston, Hagel,\nFranklin, Fink, and Grammer, 2001; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000; Penton-Voak et al.,\n1999), men with lower pitched voices (Puts, 2005), and higher social presence and\nintrasexual competitiveness as short-term mates (Gangestad, Simpson, Cousins, Garver-\nApgar, and Christensen, 2004). If appetitive aggression is a cue for heritable fitness in men,\nwe expect that women in their fertile period, compared to women in their non-fertile phase\nof their menstrual cycle, will prefer men who experience pleasure in being violent as short-\nterm mates.\nHowever, combatants that go to war or hunt are also exposed to a large number of\ntraumatic stressors that render them vulnerable to developing posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD; Elbert, Rockstroh, Kolassa, Schauer, and Neuner, 2006) and other forms of\nSchaal and Elbert, 2006; Schaal, Jacob, Dusingizemungu, and Elbert, 2010). In line with\nthe hypothesis of an increased fitness of men who have a propensity to behave cruelly,\nWeierstall and colleagues (2011; 2012) found evidence in various combatant populations\nthat appetitive aggression can be a resilience factor against PTSD. But how appealing are\nmen with trauma-related symptoms to women? Past research revealed an association\nbetween PTSD symptoms and intimate relationship problems, such as discord, physical and\npsychological aggression perpetration (Taft, Watkins, Stafford, Street, and Monson, 2011)\nas well as partner's distress (Renshaw and Campbell, 2011). For the partners of traumatized\nindividuals, it is hard to deal with the altered behavior of the affected person. Men with\nuntreated and treated PTSD had significantly less sexual functioning in the domains of\ndesire, arousal, orgasm, activity and satisfaction compared to healthy controls (Kotler et al.,\n2000). A study with 90 male combat veterans revealed that 80% experienced clinically\nrelevant sexual problems, mainly either impotence or premature ejaculation (Letourneau,\nSchewe, and Frueh, 1997). Patients with PTSD show an elevated tonic level of cortisol\ncompared with traumatized controls without PTSD (McFarlane, Barton, Yehuda, and\nthe faces of men having lower levels of cortisol as more attractive than the faces of men\nwith higher cortisol levels. This preference is higher during the fertile window of the\nmenstrual cycle compared to the luteal cycle phase. Persons with PTSD suffer in different\nareas of their lives due to psychological illness. Because of their sexual difficulties and\nrelationship problems, we predicted that men with trauma symptoms would be less\nattractive as either stable long-term partners or short-term partners for women.\nIn this study we examine the effect of fictional descriptions of different single men\non women. All single men were soldiers returning from war with different reactions to\nviolent experiences. Female participants had to evaluate the desirability of a soldier as a\nlong-term and short-term mate.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\n1586 German women completed an online survey. Three control questions at the\nend of the study checked whether the participant had read, understood and memorized the\ndescription in detail. They had to pick one of four possible answers. The correct answer\nwas the exact wording from the text (see appendix). Women who did not correctly answer\nall three questions were excluded from the data set. One thousand two hundred and twelve\nwomen (mean age = 25.54 years, SD = 8.22) were in the final sample. Sixty six percent\nwere students, 24.8% employed, 5% in professional training and 3.8% job seeking. Seven\nhundred thirty four women were in a relationship (e.g., married) and 476 were single. One\nhundred fifty five women were mothers. Six hundred and six women used oral\ncontraceptives and 598 did not, and 8 did not respond to that question. Participants received\nno financial compensation. All participants gave informed consent. The ethical review\nboard of the University of Konstanz approved the study.\nStimulus Material\nParticipants read a fictional scenario with the following content:\nGermany becomes a target of a series of terrorist attacks of\nAl Qaeda II with the consequence of increasing the number\nof German military troops in Afghanistan. After a long, but\nsuccessful war, the combatants returned back home. One of\nthe returning soldiers is Wilko.\nWe chose the name \"Wilko,\" an uncommon name in Germany, to ensure that\nparticipants have no personal connection to this name. The fictional war scenario appeared\nin this study because war is a situation in which traumatization is societally more accepted,\nif not even anticipated, and appetitively violent experiences occur without necessarily\nprecipitating moral condemnation. Germany is not currently at war, thus requiring the\nprovision of a fictional scenario. We named the enemy Al Qaida II, because Al Qaida is a\nwell know terrorist group. It is generally agreed that this terrorist group poses a serious\ndanger to civilians and that it would be morally acceptable to use force in order to counter\nthis threat.\nA description of Wilko followed (see appendix). Wilko was characterized as either\nbeing high (conditions 1 and 2) or low (conditions 3 and 4) in appetitive aggression.\nAccording to the descriptions, he would either have (conditions 1 and 3) or not have\n(conditions 2 and 4) trauma symptoms. The descriptions were validated in a pretest sample\nabout the disorder PTSD and appetitive aggression. Then they read one of four possible\nWilko descriptions. They had to decide if Wilko has PTSD, and if he is appetitively\naggressive on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 \"not at all\" to 6 \"most intensive.\" The Wilko\ndescriptions were in conformity with the underlying constructs. The two descriptions of\nWilko with trauma symptoms were rated higher in PTSD symptoms than the two\ndescriptions of Wilko without trauma symptoms (trauma symptoms: M \u00b1 SD = 4.69 \u00b1 1.05,\neffect on the perception of Wilko as appetitively aggressive. The two descriptions of Wilko\nwith high appetitive aggression were rated higher in appetitive aggression than the two\ndescriptions of Wilko with low appetitive aggression (high appetitive aggression: M \u00b1 SD =\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\n1.92), but had no effect on the PTSD perception of Wilko.\nMeasures\nAttractiveness for different kinds of relationships. Participants had to consider\nWilko in terms of different kinds of desired relationships (date, steady boyfriend, life\npartner, platonic friend, sexual affair, one night stand) on 7-point Likert scale from 0 \"not\nat all\" to 6 \"most intensive.\" For the factor desirability as a long-term mate, we\nsummarized the evaluation for Wilko desirability as a life partner and desirability as a\nsteady boyfriend. We summarized the evaluation for Wilko\u00b4s desirability as a sexual affair,\ndesirability as a one-night stand and the evaluation as \"sexually attractive\" (see next point\ncharacterization) into the factor desirability as a short-term mate.\nCharacterization of the single man. Women rated the soldier along dimensions that\ncorresponded to those identified by Sadalla et al. (1987) using a 7-point semantic\ndifferential which consists of the following adjectives: dominant/submissive, sexually\nattractive/sexually unattractive, soft/hard, feminine/masculine, rugged/delicate,\ntough/tender, bad/good, warm/cold, nice/awful, pleasant/unpleasant, friendly/aggressive,\nunintelligent/intelligent, and healthy/ill. We used the rating \"healthy/ill\" as a manipulation\ncheck for trauma symptoms and the mean value of the ratings for \"submissive/dominant,\nfeminine/masculine, and friendly/aggressive\" as manipulation check for appetitive\naggression.\nMenstrual Cycle Analysis. To calculate the fertile window of each women, we took\ninto consideration the first day of her last menstrual cycle and the typical cycle length (M \u00b1\nSD = 27.51 \u00b1 3.64). We estimated the fertile window of each woman, using an ovulation\ncalculator (http://www.umrechnung.org/eisprung-bestimmen-berechnen/zyklus-\neisprungkalender-fruchtbare-tage.htm). This calculator, based on medical data reported by\nWilcox, Duncan, Weinberg, Trussel, and Beired (2001), assumes a fertile window from day\n12-17 in a 28 days cycle (women who have longer cycles tend to ovulate later in cycle).\nThe luteal phase was assumed to be 14 days, but we subtracted 13 days from the usual\ncycle length to estimate the cycle day of ovulation as 13 days provide a less biased estimate\nof the mean ovulation day (Trussell, Rodriguez, and Ellertson, 1998). We divided the\nparticipants into three groups: fertile group - women who are in the follicular phase of their\ncycle (n = 119), non-fertile group - women who are in other phases of their cycle (n = 440)\nand oral contraceptives group - women who take oral contraceptives (n = 589). The\nfrequency distribution of fertile women in the different conditions was the following: 32\nwomen received the description of Wilko with trauma symptoms and high appetitive\naggression, 26 women received the description of Wilko without trauma symptoms and\nhigh appetitive aggression, 34 women received the trauma symptoms and low appetitive\naggression condition and 27 women received the condition without trauma symptoms and\nlow appetitive aggression of Wilko.\nProcedure\nThe online-survey was conducted for five months, using the software Unipark\n(www.unipark.de). It started with the informed consent, after which demographic variables\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\nwere ascertained. Women had to indicate (a) the first day of their last menstruation, (b) the\nuse of birth control pills and (c) their typical cycle length. It was their task first to read the\nterror attack/war scenario carefully and to try to visualize this situation as vividly as\npossible. Then they were randomly assigned to one of the four possible characterizations of\nWilko and given the task to read and imagine the described veteran (nminimum\n=\n317 in every group). After that, they received the task to imagine being single and\nmeeting the single Wilko. Participants rated the desirability of Wilko for different\nrelationships and his characterization. Next, participants were asked to answer three control\nquestions concerning the written description. Four different response options were offered\nfor each question from which only one was the correct response. Participants could not go\nback to the description of Wilko. Only participants providing three correct answers were\nincluded in the final analyses.\nResults\nManipulation Check\nFirst we performed a manipulation check to prove whether the Wilko descriptions\nwere in conformity with the underlying constructs. Therefore, we analyzed the rating for\nthe dependent variable \"healthy/ ill\" for the single man with a 2 (trauma symptoms) x 2\n(appetitively aggressive experiences of Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. For the variable\n\"health/illness,\" we found a significant main effect for the factor \"traumatization of Wilko\"\nof Wilko\" and no interaction of either factor (p > .05). Women rated men presenting with\ntrauma symptoms as more ill than men without trauma symptoms (trauma symptoms: M \u00b1\ndependent variable \"appetitive aggression\" for the single man with a 2 (trauma symptoms)\nx 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. For the\nvariable \"aggression/masculinity/dominance,\" we saw a significant main effect for the\neffect of the factor \"traumatization of Wilko\" and no significant interaction. Women rated\nmen high in appetitive aggression higher in aggression, masculinity and dominance than\nmen low in appetitive aggression (high appetitive aggression: M \u00b1 SD = 3.92 \u00b1 0.83, low\nResults for ratings of long-term mate attractiveness\nWe analyzed the dependent variables \"desirable as a long-term mate\" for the single\nman with a 2 (trauma symptoms of Wilko) x 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of\nWilko) between-groups ANOVA. We found a significant main effect for the factor\nman with fewer appetitively aggressive experiences as more desirable as a long-term mate\nthan a man who enjoys aggressive behavior. We found no significant main effect for the\nfactor \"trauma symptoms of Wilko\" and no significant interaction of the factors trauma\nsymptoms x appetitively aggressive experiences (see Figure 1). Women judged the\ndesirability of a long-term-mate of a man low in appetitive aggression higher if the man is\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\nnot traumatized, compared to a man with trauma symptoms (man with trauma\nsymptoms/low appetitive aggression: M \u00b1 SD = 1.95 \u00b1 1.56, man without trauma\nResults for ratings of short-term mate attractiveness\nWe analyzed the dependent variables \"desirable as a short-term mate\" for the single\nman with a 2 (trauma symptoms of Wilko) x 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of\nWilko) between-groups ANOVA.

The difference in the desirability of men with trauma symptoms\nin regard to their appetitive aggression (high/low) is not significant (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

Rated by women in their fertile period (dark grey bars), non-fertile phase of their cycle (middle grey\nbars) and women who take oral contraceptives (light grey bars).\nDiscussion\nResults suggest that men high in appetitive aggression scores are sexually preferred\nby women as short-term mates over those with a low score, particularly when the selector is\nin her fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. This result coincides with other studies\ndemonstrating that typical, well-marked male attributes such as dominance and masculine\nfacial features are sexually preferred by women in their fertile window (e.g., Havlicek et\nal., 2005; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000). When ovulating, women seem particularly\nselective and sensitive for a range of distinct markers of male features (Thornhill and\nGangestad, 2008). This study indicates that not only the physical appearance but also\nbehavioral traits \u00ad in this case, appetitive aggression in combination with no trauma\nsymptoms \u00ad constitute signals for presumed genetic male fitness. Men who seek dominance\nand find pleasure in aggression are not a profitable option for a stable relationship because\nthey pose a threat to the family, demonstrate less parental investment and engage in extra-\npair copulation (Marlowe, 1999). Consequently, as predicted, women in our study prefer\nmen with low appetitive aggression as a long-term mate. Instead of a more aggressive man,\na kinder, more sensitive man, might be a better option for a long-term mate (Buss and\nWhile men high in appetitive aggression are deemed the least attractive potential\nlong-term mates, regardless of the presence or absence of trauma symptoms, the presence\nof trauma symptoms mediates the attractiveness of the men with low appetitive aggression.\nTrauma symptoms in men with low appetitive aggression are evaluated as less attractive for\nlong-term relationships compared to men lacking trauma symptoms and low in appetitive\nFemale attraction to appetitive-aggressive men\naggression. Traumatized men with higher appetitive aggression scores are found to be as\nattractive as similarly highly appetitively aggressive men lacking trauma symptoms. Men\nbehaving less brutally during war are seemingly perceived as more sensitive and are\ntherefore preferred. Appetitively aggressive men prove to be so strongly unattractive to\nwomen for stable long-term relationships that additional trauma symptoms have no further\ninfluence on the perception of a soldier. All in all, men without trauma symptoms and low\nin appetitive aggression are the most preferred options among the ex-combatants as long-\nterm mates.\nIn this study women were tested once during their menstrual cycle. A within-\nsubjects design, in which the same women are tested multiple times at different points of\ntheir cycle, might produce even greater effects owing to the control of inter-individual\nvariations. Another restriction of this study is that we did not ask the women if they cycled\nregularly. Wilcox et al. (2001) showed that the likelihood of conception differ between\nwomen with regular cycles and women with irregular cycles. Therefore it might be useful\nto validate fertility hormone levels in future studies. Fictional descriptions of the different\ntypes of men we presented may limit the information value of our findings. However, the\ninvestigation of desirability of real men with/without expression of traumatization and\nlow/high appetitive aggression might be distorted by many confounding variables. The\nadvantage of this study is the standardization of the stimulus material, a large sample size\nand control questions ensuring participant attention to detail.\nConclusion\nThe present investigation indicates that appetitive aggression in men may serve as a\nsignal for high genetic fitness. Appetitive aggression enhanced the desirability of a short-\nterm mate especially for women in their fertile window. Men with a combination of high\nappetitive aggression and lacking trauma symptoms are the most desirable option as short-\nterm mates. However, aggressiveness decreased the desirability as a long-term mate,\nwhereas a partner with a low drive for aggressive behavior may be the better option.\n"
