This study describes a recent\neffort to enhance the utility of these surveys by incorporating a calendar format.\nMethods A calendar of morbidity and treatment behaviour during the 2-week period prior\nto interview was implemented in the Guatemalan Survey of Family Health\n(EGSF), a large-scale sample survey that was fielded in 60 communities in rural\nResults The EGSF calendar data provide estimates of diarrhoeal illness that are consistent\nwith those obtained from more conventional questionnaire designs. However, in\ncontrast to conventional health survey questions, these calendar data: (1) permit\na much more complete evaluation of the accuracy of reporting; and (2) offer a\nricher and more complex description of child illness and treatment behaviour.\nFor example, the results demonstrate that even the preferred 2-week recall period\nsuffers from underreporting of diarrhoeal illness, that the majority of children\nwith diarrhoea experience at least one additional symptom, and that mothers assess\nseverity of diarrhoea from the type and number of accompanying symptoms.\nConclusions The findings indicate that additional implementation and evaluation of calendar\nformats is warranted in order to provide the most useful and accurate data\npossible at relatively low cost.\nKeywords Calendar, child illness, diarrhoea, health interview survey\nDuring the past two decades, health interview surveys have\nbecome an increasingly common source of information about\ncurrent morbidity patterns and utilization of health services in\ndeveloping countries. These surveys typically involve a single\ncross-sectional interview in which respondents are asked to\nreport the illnesses that they have experienced and the health\nservices or treatments that they have used within a specified\nperiod prior to interview. In surveys of child illness, mothers are\ntypically proxy respondents for their children.\nSingle cross-sectional interviews have several advantages\nover clinical studies and longitudinal surveys, most notably\ntheir low cost and the ease of obtaining a representative sample\nof a large population. On the other hand, they are more likely\nto result in inaccurate reports of illness and treatment behav-\niour, particularly in comparison with studies that rely on med-\nical professionals or clinical records for the assessment of illness\n' Office of Population Research, 21 Prospect Avenue, Princeton, NJ 08544-\nand treatment. In view of these limitations, there have been\nseveral attempts in recent years to improve and standardize the\ndesign of health interview surveys. These efforts have resulted\nin some enhancements, such as use of a 2-week recall period for\nquestions related to morbidity--a period which is considered by\nmany investigators to offer the best balance between recall error\nand maintaining a feasible sample size--and greater reliance on\na list of tracer conditions and symptoms to identify particular\nThe present study describes a recent effort to further improve\nthe usefulness of the health interview survey, by providing a\nmuch richer description of illness. The essence of the new sur-\nvey design is its reliance on a calendar of morbidity and treat-\nment behaviour in the 2-week period prior to interview. While\na calendar approach has been shown to have several advantages\nover more conventional designs in other contexts (such as for\nthe collection of contraceptive histories),5 it has rarely been\nused in health interview surveys. The authors recently imple-\nmented a calendar approach in a large-scale sample survey,\nthe Guatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF),6 which was\nof Guatemala. The survey data were designed to measure child\nand pregnancy-related illness and treatment behaviour, along\nwith important family- and community-level factors such as social\nsupport, poverty, health beliefs, and the availability of health\nand provided information on 3193 children in the household\nThis paper examines the nature and quality of information\nobtained from the calendar, focusing specifically on the epi-\ndemiology of diarrhoea among young children. In the first sec-\ntion, we describe the design of the calendar approach used in\nthe EGSF. Subsequently, we examine various characteristics of\ndiarrhoeal illness, including the complexity, frequency, and\nseriousness of illness, and briefly explore patterns of treatment.\nFinally, we discuss our findings with regard to the advantages\nand drawbacks of the calendar approach in the study of child\nillness.\nQuestionnaire Design\nThe questionnaires employed in the EGSF were based on ques-\ntions included in previous demographic and health surveys, on\nthe results of health-related research in Guatemala, and on a\nqualitative survey conducted as pan of the EGSF project. The\nquestionnaires were reviewed by an interdisciplinary team of\nresearchers, were extensively field tested, and went through\ntranslation and backtranslation procedures in Spanish and two\nindigenous languages.7\nIn the section of the questionnaire devoted to children's ill-\nnesses, mothers were asked for detailed information pertaining\nto a maximum of two children born since 1990 (Appendix).\nThey were first asked whether each of eight specific symptoms\nrelated to respiratory or diarrhoeal illness (E1-E8) occurred\nduring the 2 weeks, and if so, when the symptom began and on\nwhich days during the past 2 weeks the symptom was present.\nThese symptoms have been shown in other studies to have high\nsensitivity and specificity1-2'4'8 and were adapted to the rural\nGuatemalan setting on the basis of medical anthropological\nresearch and on the EGSF qualitative study carried out in four\nrural Guatemalan communities.9 Respondents reporting at least\none of the eight symptoms during the 2 weeks were asked about\nany other symptoms experienced during this time (E10), whether\nthe symptoms were serious, whether mothers asked others for\nadvice (E12) or visited providers (E13) regarding their child's ill-\nness, and whether any treatments were administered by the\nmother or by anyone else (E14). This information was noted in\nthe calendar in the appropriate days. Additional information\n(such as cost and perceived effectiveness) was subsequently\nobtained about each of the people, providers and treatments\nrecorded in the calendar, and about hospitalization, perceived\ncauses of illness, and general health status of the child.6\nThese questions on child illness permit us to address many of\nthe methodological weaknesses of previous health interview\nsurveys. For example, Ross and Vaughan3 note that studies often\nfail (or are unable) to: (1) identify whether episodes of illness\nwhich began prior to the recall period but extend into the period\nare included in reports and measures of illness; and (2) disting-\nuish complete from incomplete episodes of illness. The calendar\napproach used in the EGSF permits identification of both left\nand right censoring of episodes and leads to unbiased estimates\nof illness frequency and duration as long as the analyst employs\nappropriate life table techniques. Another benefit of this cal-\nendar approach is that it permits the analyst to carry out in-\nternal checks of consistency of the data and to thereby assess\nthe quality of reporting of illness. A third advantage is the ability\nof the calendar to capture complex illness histories (i.e. several\npartially overlapping symptoms and treatment behaviours),\nwithout the analyst having any a priori definition of an (episode\nof) illness. For example, the analyst can explore the sensitivity\nof estimates of acute respiratory illness (ARI) to alternative\ndefinitions (i.e. combinations of symptoms). These benefits of\nthe calendar approach are demonstrated below in the study of\ndiarrhoeal illness among young Guatemalan children.\nComplexity of Reports of Diarrhoeal\nIllness\nAs is generally recognized in the epidemiological literature,\nvalidation of a diarrhoeal episode in community surveys is prob-\nlematic because of the difficulty of obtaining daily observations\nor stool collections for a large population.81011 This is especially\ntrue for young children, for whom the collection of all soiled\ndiapers would constitute an excessively intrusive and demand-\ning undertaking. As a result, mothers' or care givers' reports\nhave been used as the generally accepted procedure for identi-\nfying cases of diarrhoea in epidemiological research based on\nyoung children.10'11 Although numerous studies have shown\nhigh agreement between mothers' perceptions about the oc-\ncurrence of diarrhoea and mothers' responses to standardized\nquestions on the frequency and consistency of stools,8 the latter\nIn the EGSF, the occurrence of diarrhoea on any given day in\nthe last 2 weeks was determined by mothers' responses to\nquestion E6 about whether the child experienced 'asientos', at\nleast three times on the given day. In extensive field tests prior\nto the survey, 'asientos' was shown to be the term for diarrhoea\nthat was most likely to be understood by the rural Guatemalan\npopulation. For example, when asked to describe the symptoms\nassociated with 'asientos', mothers were most likely to report\nthe watery consistency of stools, along with increased frequency\nof defecation.9 The use of three or more stools in the definition\nof diarrhoea has been shown to lead to high sensitivity and\nspecificity.8\nA definition of a diarrhoeal episode requires further delineation\nas to the number of intervening diarrhoea-free days required to\ndefine a new episode. Among the 705 children reporting any\ndiarrhoea in the 2-week period (22% of children born since\nmore days) between two occurrences of diarrhoea. Given the\nreports of multiple periods of diarrhoea in the EGSF are relat-\nively rare, estimates are very robust to alternative specifications\nof the length of the diarrhoea-free period required to define a\nnew episode. In the remainder of this analysis, we use a defini-\ntion of two or more diarrhoea-free days; this definition results\nin a total of 722 episodes of diarrhoea during the calendar period.\nA salient problem concerning the definition of a diarrhoeal\nepisode is whether and how to incorporate reports of other\n(non-diarrhoeal) symptoms. As shown in Table 1, almost two-\nthirds of diarrhoeal episodes have at least one additional symptom\nreported within the episode. The majority of these were elicited\nTable 1 Measures of complexity of diarrhoeal eplsodes,a Guatemalan\nCharacteristics of episodes Proportion of episodes\nMultiple episode (2nd or 3rd) within calendar\nAt least one accompanying symptom\nAt least one non-solicited symptomb\nAt least one symptom occurring completely\noutside the episode of diarrhoea\nNumber of diarrhoea episodes\n\" Two Intervening days without diarrhoea are required to define a new\nepisode.\nb Symptoms reported in column E10 of the calendar, see Appendix\nby questions E1-E5 and E7-E8 on specific symptoms; however,\nfor 10% of episodes, respondents reported a symptom within\nthe diarrhoeal episode in response to a general question (E10)\nabout other problems experienced during the illness.\nThe description of an illness becomes even more complex\nwhen we recognize that symptoms reported in the calendar\nperiod can extend beyond or occur totally outside the period of\ndiarrhoea. The actual illness history for one child in the EGSF\nsample (whom we call Ana) is shown in the Appendix. Ana had\ndiarrhoea for only 2 days in the calendar but had several other\nsymptoms for longer periods (including a constant cough for the\npast 9 months). Fever occurred both on the days with diarrhoea\nand on several days prior to the start of diarrhoea. Moreover,\nseveral days of vomiting--which are likely to be part of the\nsame illness as diarrhoea--occurred totally outside the episode\nof diarrhoea. Such complicated histories are not rare. For ex-\nample, as shown in the last row of Table 1, almost one-fifth of\nepisodes have a symptom that falls totally outside the period of\ndiarrhoea. These occurrences point to the ambiguities associated\nwith the definition of an episode of diarrhoea (or of any other\nillness).\nFrequency of Diarrhoeal Illness\nTabulations of starting dates, ending dates, and durations of\ndiarrhoeal episodes (not shown here) indicate some heaping\nof responses. The most marked levels of heaping occur for\nthe starting dates 8 and 15 days before interview (i.e. 1 and\n2 weeks). Heaping on the latter date, which occurs just outside\nthe 2-week calendar, is likely to have arisen because the Spanish\nexpression used to describe the most recent 2-week period is\n'estos ulitmos 15 dfas' (these last 15 days). Asa result of the ap-\nparent heaping, we calculated estimates of prevalence for three\nalterative periods, excluding the day of interview: the most recent\n2-week period (21.8%), the most recent 1-week period\nestimates reveal a substantial underestimate in the next-to-last\nweek compared with the last week, due to a deficit in reporting\nof diarrhoea for this period or to a displacement of days with\ndiarrhoea from the penultimate to the last week (or to both).\nThe heaping of reported starting dates on the day prior to the\ncalendar period (15 days ago) suggests that some of these\nepisodes probably began within the calendar period and that\nestimates for the penultimate week as well as for the entire\n2-week period may be too low. On the other hand, the estim-\nated prevalence of 22% from the EGSF for the past 2 weeks is\nslightly higher than alternative estimates for Guatemala: 20%\nfor rural areas according to the 1995 Demographic and Health\nSurvey (DHS) in Guatemala (based on our own calculation) and\nHealth Survey in Guatemala.12\nIn Table 2, we present estimates of incidence and prevalence\nby age for two reference periods that are likely to encompass\nthe true rates: the last week (which may yield overestimates)\nand the last 2 weeks (which may yield underestimates). We\nuse a risk measure of incidence defined as the probability that a\ndiarrhoea-free child at the start of the relevant period develops\ndiarrhoea within the ensuing period.13 The quality of the EGSF\nestimates is supported by the finding that all estimates of incid-\nence reveal the expected age pattern of diarrhoeal illness, with\npeak rates during the latter half of infancy and the second year\nof life. Especially high morbidity from diarrhoea during these\nages occurs in a large number of developing countries, pre-\nsumably from poor weaning practices (e.g. inappropriate foods\nIn Table 3 we explore differentials in incidence and preval-\nence by whether or not the child is chronically malnourished,\nusing an indicator of stunting (i.e. more than two standard\ndeviations below the median height for age as defined by the\nTable 2 Prevalence and incidence of diarrhoea for 1-week and 2-week period prior to interview, by age, Guatemalan Survey of Family Health\nAge No. of children\nPrevalence1*\nIncidence1\"\nTotalc\na Calculations exdude day of interview since it represents an Incomplete day of exposure.\nb Prevalence is measured as the proportion of children with any diarrhoea during the specified recall period.

Our\nconclusions would remain the same if we had used the last week\nas a reference period, but the 2-week period has the advantage\nof including longer episodes of diarrhoea (i.e. greater than\n7 days) and of larger sample sizes.\nThe results in Table 3 indicate modest (but not statistically\nsignificant) differences in the frequency of diarrhoea by stunt-\ning, fn spite of clearly established negative associations between\ndiarrhoea and children's physical growth,19\"2' earlier studies\nhave yielded mixed findings regarding the association between\ninfection and growth, in part because of variation in the severity\nand duration of illness,17'22 as well as frequent reliance on\ncross-sectional rather than longitudinal data.23\nLife table calculations based on all episodes of diarrhoea begin-\nning in the calendar period (N = 550) indicate that the median\nduration is equal to 5.3 days, a value which lies in the range 3-7\ndays found in other developing countries.4 Differences in dura-\ntion by whether or not children are stunted are not statistically\nsignificant.\nSeriousness\nSince the EGSF asked mothers to determine whether their\nchild's illness was serious (and to specify the days on which it\nwas serious), we can compare these reports with characteristics\nof the illness to determine the basis on which mothers assessed\nseverity. The first column of Table 4 indicates the frequency with\nwhich diarrhoeal episodes have different types and numbers of\naccompanying symptoms. For example, almost one-third of epi-\nsodes are accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom and\na similar proportion by fever. The likelihood that a diarrhoeal\nepisode was assessed as serious (i.e. contains at least 1 day in\nwhich the mother felt that the symptoms were serious) varies\nboth by the nature of accompanying symptoms and by the\nnumber of these symptoms. Almost 70% of diarrhoeal episodes\nthat include additional gastrointestinal symptoms (primarily\nvomiting) were considered serious in contrast to about half of\nepisodes that include respiratory symptoms. The association\nbetween reported severity and the total number of accompany-\ning symptoms is strong and monotonic: for example, whereas\nless than one-third of diarrhoeal episodes with no additional\nTable 4 Proportion of diarrhoeal episodes assessed as serious, by type\nof accompanying symptom and by number of symptoms reported,\nGuatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF) (1995)a\nProportion of\nNo. (proportion) episodes considered\nof episodes0 serious\nType of accompanying symptom\nRespiratory\nGastrointestinal\nSkin\nFever\nOther\nNo. of accompanying symptoms\nTotal\nb\na Based on episodes for children ages 0-5 years.\nb Respiratory symptoms indude cough, rattling chest, wheezing, measles,\nbronchitis, cold, flu, allergy, sneezing, and ear and throat problems.

Tabulations (not\nshown here) indicate that stunted children were significantly\nmore likely to have their diarrhoeal episode assessed as serious\ntable estimates (also not shown here) indicate no significant\ndifference in overall duration by whether or not the mother\nreported the episode as serious.\nTreatment\nAlthough this analysis focuses on a description of diarrhoeal ill-\nness, a brief examination of treatment behaviour demonstrates\nthat the benefits of the EGSF data collection strategy extend\nto the study of treatment as much as to the assessment of the\ncharacteristics of illness. Unlike many other health interview\nsurveys, the EGSF recognizes that treatment encompasses a\nwide range of providers (i.e. people who offer traditional, pop-\nular and biomedical treatments), as well as advice sought from\nfriends and relatives, and treatments administered at home\n(often by the mother) or elsewhere.24 For example, as shown\nin the Appendix, Ana's mother consulted with her husband and\nadministered three different types of medicine (specified later in\nthe questionnaire) and a steam bath (temescal) to help cure Ana.\nTable 5 Descriptive statistics for treatment behaviour during diarrhoeal episodes,3 Guatemalan Survey ol Family Health (EGSF) (1995)\nPeople from whom advice sought\nProviders seen\nTreatments administered\nMean\nno.\nMaximum\nno.\nPer cent with\nat least one\nMean day first person\nsought/treatment used\na Based on episodes of duration greater than 3 days, beginning in the 2-weeW period.\nTable 5 presents several summary measures of treatment\nbehaviour for the entire sample of diarrhoeal episodes; since\ntreatment is likely to vary by the duration of the episode, this\ntable is restricted to episodes lasting more than 3 days. The\nmeasures indicate that, on average, mothers sought advice from\none other person (such as a family member, friend or neigh-\nbour) and 0.4 providers during the episode. Whereas only\nabout one-third saw any provider, more than three-quarters of\nmothers sought advice from a relative or friend. Virtually all\nchildren received some form of treatment (from the mother or\nfrom another person), and on average they received about two\ntreatments during the course of the episode. On average, pro-\nviders were seen on the third day of the episode, later than the\nadministration of the first treatment or the seeking of advice\nfrom another source.\nDiscussion\nThe analysis of diarrhoeal illness highlights the main advantages\nof the calendar approach for the study of child illness. One\nnotable benefit that has received little attention in the past is\nthat a calendar permits the analyst to assess the quality of the\nresulting data in several respects: (1) evaluation of patterns of\nreporting (such as the extent of heaping of responses on par-\nticular days); (2) comparison of estimates with outside sources\nthat provide information on illness frequency in the past 24\nhours, week or 2-week period (or other short periods); and (3)\ncalculation of internal checks of consistency. For example,\nestimates of prevalence from the EGSF for sub-periods within\nthe 2-week calendar suggest that reporting is more complete for\ndays closer to the time of interview. Although a 2-week recall\nperiod is recommended by most epidemiologists for interview\nreports of child illness, this analysis and other studies indicate\nthat memory lapses may occur within this relatively short time\nspan.25 In contrast to information ascertained from fixed recall\nperiods, the calendar approach permits the analyst to alter the\nreference period for estimates (e.g. by focusing on the last week\nrather than the last 2 weeks) subsequent to data collection.\nAn equally important advantage of the calendar is that it\nprovides a much richer description of illness (and treatment\nbehaviour) than is possible with many other types of ques-\ntionnaires. While results from longitudinal studies demonstrate\nthe frequent recurrence and overlapping of different illnesses or\nsymptoms, cross-sectional surveys have typically presented a\nvery oversimplified description of illness. The Demographic and\nHealth Surveys, for example, present separate results for the fre-\nquency of diarrhoeal and respiratory illnesses for a given child,\nwithout explicitly recognizing that these symptoms often over-\nlap. Results from the EGSF demonstrate that the definition of\n(an episode of) illness is complex and that classification of illnes-\nses into distinct categories (such as diarrhoeal versus respiratory),\nwith the corresponding starting and ending dates, may not\nconstitute the most meaningful strategy for understanding child\nillness. Such classification schemes become even more unsatis-\nfactory when the analyst attempts to ascribe reports of illness\ncausation, seriousness, and treatment to particular symptoms or\nepisodes.\nThe survey design implemented in the EGSF is not without its\ndrawbacks. As suggested above, memory problems are likely to\npersist in any health survey that obtains information retro-\nspectively, even those that incorporate a short recall period. One\napparent limitation of the EGSF is the tediousness of obtaining\ndetailed illness histories from more than one child in the family.\nEstimates (not presented here) indicate that this repetition\nprobably led to underreporting in the EGSF: the frequency of\nreported illness is lower for the penultimate as compared with\nthe last child, even when age, birth order and other relevant\ncharacteristics are controlled. While the redundancy could have\nbeen eliminated by restricting questions to a randomly selected\nchild born during the relevant period (January, 1990 to inter-\nview date),26 this strategy precludes any analysis of family\neffects related to illness and treatment--an important objective\nof the EGSF and of other epidemiological and social science\ninvestigations.\nIn spite of these problems, the analysis presented here\nindicates the usefulness of calendar formats for measuring child\nillness. Conventional estimates pertaining to diarrhoea--such\nas prevalence in the past 2 weeks, age patterns and average\nduration--can be readily derived from the calendar format.\nThese estimates for the EGSF appear to be of high quality, e.g.\nthey are consistent with those obtained from other sources in\nGuatemala and elsewhere. At the same time, the calendar\nformat provides much more information about illnesses and\ntreatment behaviour than do more conventional instruments,\nsuch as the questionnaires for the Demographic and Health\nSurvey project which have been used in over 50 developing\ncountries during the past decade. Since epidemiologists are rely-\ning to a greater extent than in previous years on single-round\nhousehold interviews, rather than more costly longitudinal\ninvestigations and field surveys, additional implementation and\nevaluation of calendar formats is warranted to provide the most\nuseful and accurate data possible at relatively low cost.\n"
