The study population consisted\nof 16,196 individuals age 18 or older who had peripheral blood counts and data on HCV\ninfection. The lowest fifth percentile of each component of the peripheral blood was desig-\nnated a priori as being low. HCV infection was assessed by antibody reactivity. HCV\nantibody\u00adpositive individuals were 3-fold more likely to have low neutrophil counts (HCV\npositive, 9% vs. HCV negative, 3%, P < .0001) and 2.6-fold more likely to have low platelet\ncounts (HCV positive, 13% vs. HCV negative, 5%, P < .0001) independent of other\nevaluated factors. HCV infection was observed in more than 20% of persons with neutrophil\ndetected between anti-HCV status and anemia or other peripheral blood cell components. In\nconclusion, HCV-infected persons in the general population of the United States are more\nlikely to have low neutrophil and platelet counts, and HCV testing should be considered for\npersons with unexplained neutrophil counts below 1.0  109/L or platelet counts less than\n100  109/L. Alternate causes of anemia should be considered for HCV-infected persons\nAn estimated 2.7 million people in the United States\nhave hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.1 HCV\nprincipally replicates in the liver and its cardinal\nmanifestation is progressive hepatic failure from fibro-\nsis.2-4 Evidence of HCV replication also has been reported\nin peripheral blood cells, and abnormal blood counts have\nbeen noted in clinic patients with HCV infection.5-8\nHowever, the frequency and severity of peripheral blood\ncell count abnormalities in the majority of HCV-infected\nindividuals are unknown.\nNo universally accepted normal range exists for most\ncomponents of the peripheral blood count. In addition, a\nnumber of factors are known to affect both the peripheral\nblood count and the prevalence of HCV infection.1,9-11\nThus, the objective of this investigation was to evaluate\nthe frequency and severity of peripheral blood cell abnor-\nmalities in HCV-infected patients in the general popula-\ntion after accounting for age, race, and other potential\nconfounding factors.\nPatients and Methods\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES III) was conducted by the United\nStates National Center for Health Statistics for the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of a representative sample of\nthe United States civilian population, as previously de-\nof age or older were enrolled at 89 randomly selected\nlocations throughout the United States.

This analysis is restricted to 16,196\nexaminations and complete laboratory assessments in-\ncluding HCV antibody (anti-HCV) testing.12,13\nLaboratory Testing. Venous whole blood was drawn\ninto vacuum tubes containing potassium ethylenediami-\nnetetraacetic acid for assessment of the leukocyte count\nand differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpus-\ncular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean cor-\npuscular hemoglobin concentration, red-cell distribution\nwidth, platelet count, mean platelet volume, and platelet\ndistribution width. Complete blood counts were per-\nformed in duplicate within 20 minutes of collection by\nusing a Coulter S-Plus Jr. automated hematology analyzer\n(Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), which has a linear\n109/L for white blood cells. Electronic differential counts\nwere confirmed in a subset by review of the peripheral\nblood smear. All abnormal differentials were reviewed by\nperipheral smear. The accuracy and completeness of he-\nmatology data were reviewed by the Serum Bank Branch,\nScientific Resources Program, National Center for Infec-\ntious Diseases.\nSerum chemistry profiles including total bilirubin, al-\nbumin, and total protein were analyzed by using a Hitachi\nModel 737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Manheim\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Anti-HCV testing was\nperformed by using a second-generation enzyme immu-\nnoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). Positive sam-\nples were repeated and then confirmed by using the\nMATRIX assay (Abbott Laboratories).1 A sandwich ra-\ndioimmunoassay (Abbott Laboratories) was used to quan-\ntify hepatitis B surface antigen in human serum. Serum\ntransaminases were performed on previously frozen sam-\nples and therefore were not evaluated.13\nStatistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed by using methods appropriate for complex survey\ndesign and clustered data. Because of heterogeneity in\nreference ranges used by clinical laboratories and the ab-\nsence of clear biologic thresholds, hematologic markers\nwere examined according to their distribution in the\nNHANES III adult population. Values below the fifth\npercentile were considered low and were compared with\nthe remaining 95% designated as the normal range. These\nconventions were used for analysis of all hematologic pa-\nrameters by calculating a Pearson 2 statistic corrected for\ncomplex survey design and clustered data. The relation-\nship between anti-HCV and blood neutrophils and plate-\nlets was then further examined by using multivariate\nlogistic regression to adjust for potential confounding\nvariables including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index\n(BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and hepatitis B\nsurface antigen status. When a low blood-cell index was\nmore common in HCV-infected patients, the outcome\nvariable (the blood count value) was altered across a clin-\nically meaningful range and the prevalence of HCV infec-\ntion was reassessed.\nAge and ethnicity were categorized according to the\nsurvey design as suggested by United States National\nCenter for Health Statistics for analysis of NHANES III\ndata.13 Age was analyzed in 10-year intervals and ethnicity\nwas divided into 4 categories: non-Hispanic White, non-\nHispanic Black, Mexican American, and others, which\nincluded other Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.\nThe other category was excluded from analysis because of\nsmall sample size and within-group heterogeneity. BMI,\ndefined as weight/height2 (kg/m2), was classified accord-\ning to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute cri-\nor normal, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, re-\nspectively.14 Cigarette smoking status was characterized as\nnever, former, or current, based on individual response at\nthe time of interview. Excessive alcohol intake was defined\nas ethanol consumption greater than 50 g/day (approxi-\nmately 5 drinks) during the past year.13\nAnalysis was performed by using STATA (Vs 6.0, Col-\nlege Station, TX). All analyses incorporated sampling\nweights, which are based on United States Census Bureau\ndata describing the age, sex, race, income, and geographic\nlocation of the United States population, to provide ac-\ncurate estimates that were representative of the United\nStates population during the 6 years of the survey. These\nsampling weights take into account the unequal probabil-\nities of selection owing to the cluster design of the survey,\nnonresponse, and the planned oversampling of certain\nResults\nage or older had complete blood counts and anti-HCV\ntesting. These participants are similar to the entire survey\npopulation with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity and\ntherefore are considered representative of the adult\nUnited States population at the time of the survey (data\nnot shown). Three hundred ninety of the 16,196 partic-\nipants in the study sample (2.4%) were anti-HCV posi-\ntive. As previously published, HCV infection was\nsignificantly more common among non-Hispanic blacks,\nmen, persons aged 30 to 49 years old, persons consuming\nmore than 50 g ethanol/d, illegal drug users, persons with\na history of high-risk sexual behavior, persons infected\nwith hepatitis B virus, and individuals of lower socioeco-\nnomic status.1\nLeukocyte Counts. Overall, the median total leuko-\nof anti-HCV\u00adpositive individuals had leukocyte counts\nless than 4.3  109/L, a result explained by a reduction in\nneutrophils (Table 1). The median neutrophil count was\n109/L were found in 9% of anti-HCV\u00adpositive persons\nbut only 3% of those without HCV infection (P \n.0001).

Sex, ethanol use, and hepatitis B surface anti-\ngen status were not associated with neutrophil counts less\nthan 2.1  109/L and did not affect the association of\nanti-HCV status with neutrophil counts (data not\nshown). Compared with anti-HCV\u00adpositive individuals\nwith neutrophil counts greater than or equal to 2.1 \nwere more likely to have a total serum bilirubin greater\nthan 32 mol/L (P  .02) and serum globulin greater\nthan 40 g/L (P  .01) but not a platelet count less than\n(P  .97).

These general pop-\nulation data contribute substantially to our understand-\ning of the relationship between HCV infection and the\nperipheral blood count and indicate the prevalence of\nHCV infection is substantially increased among patients\nwith moderate reductions in neutrophil and platelet\ncounts.\nOne potential implication of these data is that persons\nwith unexplained neutropenia or thrombocytopenia\nshould be tested for HCV infection. In this study, more\nthan 20% of patients with neutrophil counts below 1.0 \nantibodies. In addition, all anti-HCV\u00adpositive patients\nwith counts below these thresholds had HCV RNA in\ntheir blood, a positive predictive value for ongoing HCV\ninfection of 100%. Identification of persons with HCV\ninfection is important because effective treatment exists\nand most HCV-infected persons are not aware of their\ninfection.15-17 Risk factor\u00adbased screening is the most im-\nportant means of identifying HCV-infected persons in\nthe population. In this study, 25% of persons with HCV\ninfection and neutropenia or thrombocytopenia had a\nhistory of illicit drug use and thus could also have had\ntheir HCV infection detected if they acknowledged this\nexposure to their health care provider. Because in practice\nthese behaviors are often not accurately assessed, practi-\ntioners should test persons with unexplained neutropenia\nand thrombocytopenia for HCV infection, as is already\nrecommended for those with elevated liver enzyme levels.\nThis analysis was not designed to identify the mecha-\nnism of these associations. It is interesting to note that\nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia were associated with\nseveral markers of severe liver disease such as an elevated\nserum bilirubin or globulin level or a low serum albumin,\nand that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can be\nfound in patients with cirrhosis of many etiologies.18 On\nthe other hand, because the NHANES III study was con-\nducted in the community and not a liver disease clinic, it\nwould be surprising if a high proportion of subjects had\nserious liver disease. Other studies have suggested that\nHCV could cause thrombocytopenia through other\nmechanisms, such as an autoimmune process.6-8,19 Unfor-\ntunately, because liver and bone marrow biopsy speci-\nmens were not obtained, additional research is required to\ndetermine the biologic basis for these associations.\nIn this study, there were a number of factors that could\nhave confounded or modified the associations of HCV\nexample, racial differences were observed in the strength\nof the association between anti-HCV status and low\nplatelet counts. Although the bases for these findings are\nnot evident, the interrelationship between HCV infec-\ntion, platelet and neutrophil counts, and multiple other\nfactors (e.g., race, age, cigarette smoking) underscores the\nimportance of adjusting for these in any future studies and\nis a strength of the adjusted risk estimates determined in\nthe NHANES III investigation.\nThere are no universally accepted normal ranges for\ncomponents of the peripheral blood, and ranges that are\nclinically useful vary substantially. Therefore, we estab-\nlished normal ranges for each component based on the\ndistribution of values in a sample of the noninstitutional-\nized general population of the United States and exam-\nined the relationship between HCV infection and blood\ncounts across the full range of observed values. The neu-\ntrophil and platelet levels that are associated with HCV\ninfection in NHANES III are higher than what is the\nlower range of many hospital laboratories. We believe this\nis another instance in which the clinically meaningful lev-\nels of blood components need to be established according\nto the condition under consideration, not according to\narbitrarily selected external standards.\nThis analysis has several limitations. As mentioned ear-\nlier, the cross-sectional design and lack of complete med-\nical information and long-term follow-up limit the extent\nto which HCV infection can be considered the cause of\nthe hematologic abnormalities and impede identification\nof the biologic basis of these findings. Cirrhosis, hyper-\nsplenism, bone marrow suppression, and autoimmune\ndestruction associated with HCV infection as well as co-\nexisting viral infections such as human immunodeficiency\nvirus potentially could influence these findings. Human\nimmunodeficiency virus infection is an especially impor-\ntant potential confounder because it is transmitted by\nsimilar routes and can cause thrombocytopenia.The lim-\nited data available for the NHANES III population do\nnot allow precise identification of a single cause and ex-\nisting data suggest that multiple mechanisms may be re-\nsponsible.6-8,18 Although the population-based sampling\nclearly enhances the contribution this analysis makes to\nprior clinic-based investigations, it is also possible that the\nseverity of hematologic findings is underestimated be-\ncause persons with advanced HCV infection are more\nlikely to be institutionalized and thus not available for\nstudy.\nIn summary, these data indicate HCV infection is as-\nsociated with low neutrophil and platelet counts, but not\nanemia, in the general population of the United States.\nFurther research is needed to assess the biologic basis for\nthese findings. In the meantime, practitioners should con-\nsider screening patients for HCV infection with unex-\nplained neutrophil counts below 1.0  109/L or platelet\n"
