Unfortunately, we are not very well informed about the psychology of\nNeanderthal man or about the psychology of Homo siniensis of Teilhard de\nChardin. Since this field of biogenesis is not available to us, we shall do as\nbiologists do and turn to ontogenesis (Piaget, 1970, p. 13).\nTextbooks on child development and educational psychology often take Piaget\nas the starting point for discussing cognitive development (e.g. Ormrod, 2003).\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nThis is a very reasonable tack because Piaget, more than any other theorist,\nshaped our understanding of how children's cognition changes in predictable\nways. Central to Piaget is the idea that children are able to solve certain problems\nonly at certain ages and that these problems can be organized into a\ndevelopmental sequence that defines discrete stages of cognitive development.\nPiaget was clearly extending a notion borrowed from Binet (early in his career\nPiaget had been employed standardizing intelligence tests, Vidal, 1994), but while\nBinet focused on individual differences, Piaget found significance in children's\nPiaget's approach has proved remarkably fruitful. For example, it is now well\ndocumented that children across cultures accomplish certain Piagetian tasks\napproximately at the ages and in the sequence predicted (Brainerd, 1978; De\nLemos, 1969). Indeed, some aspects of the Piaget model are so universal that they\nextend beyond the human species. There is evidence of Piaget like developmental\nmilestones in a number of mammalian species (Parker and McKinney; 1999,\nPiagetian influenced research has become important in ethology (Vauclair, 1996;\nlinked Piagetian tasks to the developmental changes in the brain (e.g. Diamond,\nYet for all its success, several important elements of Piaget's work have not\nstood up to empirical scrutiny. There is now abundant evidence that Piaget\nunderestimated the capacities of infants (Ormrod, 2003). Many neo-Piagetians\nnow reject his notion of an overarching logical-mathematical structure as the\ndriving force of development and now think in terms of independent cognitive\nstructures regulated by a generalized developmental capacity (Case, 1992;\nPascual-Leone, 1987). In addition, Piaget's model of unified stages, while a\nconvenient heuristic, does not always capture the combined and uneven\nPerhaps, his greatest failure was his characterization of the formal operations\nstage, said to begin in adolescence. It is now abundantly clear that many\nteenagers and adults do not reason in the ways described by Piaget.\nThe goal of this paper is to discuss this latter problem with Piaget's work in\nlight of evolutionary psychology. It is argued here not simply that Piaget's model\nmust be modified to incorporate the insights of evolutionary psychology, but that\ndevelopmental theory should be subsumed into evolutionary psychology. More\nover, a case is made that absent the insights of evolutionary psychology, Piagetian\nconstructivist pedagogy is fundamentally flawed.\nIt may surprise some to learn that Piaget was deeply committed to an\nevolutionary view of cognitive development. Textbooks are often silent on this\npoint (e.g. Feldman, 1998) and one has the sense that Piaget has been\n\"debiologized\" for presentation to publics not open to biological and evolutionary\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nexplanations (although it should be noted there are many excellent exceptions to\nthis phenomenon, e.g. Cole and Cole, 1989).\nThe notion that evolutionary psychology is the proper framework for continued\nevaluation of Piaget is perfectly natural. As the epigram for this paper suggests\ndevelopment could only be understood as part of a larger evolutionary model.\nThe limits of Piaget could even be said to reflect the limits of the evolutionary\nmodel he embraced. Piaget, while a committed evolutionist, was not a Darwinian\nand he was deeply influenced by teleological and recapitulationist points of view\nkind of telos, a view that is impossible to make consistent with modern\ncannot be shaped by some distal endpoint. Rather brains evolve to solve proximal\nenvironmental and social challenges. Modern evolutionary psychology suggests\nthat the best understanding of the mind will arise from study of our species'\nEnvironment of Evolutionary Adaptedness. Defined by Symons (1992) as \"the\nPleistocene environment in which the overwhelming majority of human evolution\noccurred\" (p. 143). The structure and development of human cognitive abilities,\nlike all products of selection, can only be fully understood in the context of\nnatural history.\nThe strength of this approach can be seen in Cummins' (1998) work on deontic\nreasoning. Cummins notes that humans are particularly good at deontic\nreasoning, that is reasoning about obligations and rights, because our minds have\nadapted to negotiate the uncertainties of dominance hierarchy. Cummins observes\nthat \"children as young as three years of age organize themselves into dominance\nhierarchies\" (p. 45). Research by Edelman and Omark (1973) not only documents\nthe existence of dominance hierarchies in young children, but links the\ndevelopment of these hierarchies to the child's attainment of the ability to seriate,\ndiscussed the ability to seriate as a developmental phenomenon. Because Piaget\nwas unclear on the underlying evolutionary context of cognitive development\n(although he fully acknowledged that it existed) he limited the explanatory power\nof his model. Using an evolutionary approach Edelman and Omark were able to\nsee connections that eluded Piaget, in this case \"the logical equivalence of\nseriation and hierarchization\" (p. 108).\nFormal Operations\nKuhn (1979) has argued, \"that Piaget's stage of formal operations is the single\nstage in his sequence having the most profound and far reading implications for\neducation\" (p. 34). The stage was first described by Inhelder and Piaget in 1958.\nThe formal operational abilities include prepositional logic, inductive logic,\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nhypothesis testing, and reasoning about proportions, combinations, probabilities,\nand correlations.\nThe name for the formal operations stage comes from the belief that younger\nchildren cannot disregard the content of an argument and pay attention to its\nformal structure. Phillips (1969) gives this example of a syllogism\nAll children like spinach;\nBoys are children\nTherefore boys like spinach (p. 103)\nHe goes on to note that \"the younger child will respond to the context\n(particularly if he is a boy who doesn't like spinach!), but the adolescent can\nfollow the argument because he is impressed by its form\" (p. 103). But in a\nfootnote, Phillips mentions a 1944 study by Morgan and Morton where most\ncollege students could not distinguish between the form and content of a\nsyllogism. Morgan and Morton found \"that even when a subject is presented with\na syllogism in which the terms are abstract symbols or concrete terms which have\nlittle or no personal significance, he has difficulty in selecting the correct\nconclusion\" (p. 39). When the content was personally significant they found that\ndistortion becomes much more marked when the terms in the syllogism are\nrelated to the personal convictions of the reasoner. A person is likely to\naccept a conclusion which expresses his convictions with little regard for\nthe correctness or incompleteness of the inference involved (p. 39).\nThus, contrary to Piaget's predictions, not only were adults not able to separate\nform from content, they had difficulty with syllogistic reasoning itself. This\nobservation is consistent with experimental results that show that humans have\ngreat difficulty solving normative deductive reasoning problems (Evens, 2002;\nTamburrini (1982) pointed out that \"there is considerable evidence that formal\noperational thought is contextually bound\" (p. 319). This is no small concession;\nthe very point of formal operations is that they go beyond context and content.\nThe failure of adolescents and adults to reason in the ways predicted by Piaget is a\nserious problem for both the theory and practice of education, for it is precisely\nthe formal reasoning skills that are necessary for mastering academic subjects\nsuch as math and science beyond the elementary level.\nThe literature abounds with evidence that adolescents and adults fail to exhibit\nthe type of reasoning predicted by Piaget. This failure can be found in both\nacademic and non-academic contexts. Capon and Kuhn (1982) in a study of\nsupermarket shoppers found that most could not apply the formal operational skill\nof proportional reasoning to calculate best buys. They concluded formal\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\noperations \"appears to be the only stage in Piaget's sequence that is not attained\nEvolutionary psychology, on the other hand, does give us a framework for\nunderstanding the frequent failure of adolescents and adults to use formal\nreasoning and master certain academic tasks. Geary (1995) makes a distinction\nbetween biologically primary abilities and biologically secondary abilities.\nBiologically primary abilities refer to those cognitive skills, such as learning\nlanguage, which are the result of the evolved architecture of the brain (Geary,\nBiologically primary abilities are acquired universally and children\ntypically have high motivation to perform the tasks involving them. In\ncontrast, biologically secondary abilities are culturally determined, and\noften tedious repetition and external motivation are necessary for their\nmastery. From this perspective it is understandable that many children have\ndifficulty with reading and higher mathematics (p. 63).\nIt is important to note that this is not a simple model of biological base and\ncultural superstructure. Rather as Geary (1995) points out biological secondary\nabilities entail \"the co-optation of primary abilities for purposes other than the\noriginal evolution-based function and appear to develop only in specific cultural\nUsing this framework we are now in a position to reinterpret Piaget's\ncontribution. We can understand the Piagetian tasks (at least those that have been\nempirically verified) that characterize the first 11 years of life as rooted in the\nbiologically primary abilities. For example, Parker and McKinney (1999) in their\nextensive review of primate cognitive development found that\nFirst, macaques, cebus, great apes, and humans transverse the same\nsequence of stages in the development of logical as well as physical\ncognition during the sensorimotor period.\nSecond, both great apes and humans complete all the sensorimotor period\nstages in logical as well as physical cognition, but macaques and cebus\nThe sensorimotor period was the first of Piaget's developmental stages that\noccurs in humans between the ages of birth and two years. In addition, Parker\nand McKinney found evidence \"that great apes may achieve the level of intuitive\nsubperiod of preoperations in the logical-mathematical domains of seriation,\nclassification, conservation, and number\" (p. 105). All this suggests a deep\nphylogenetic history for the ability to perform many of the Piaget tasks and\nsuggests that many are biologically primary abilities. Formal operational tasks, on\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nthe other hand, should, like reading, be regarded as biologically secondary\nabilities. Formal operational skills should not be thought of as skills that naturally\nunfold over the course of development, instead these are skills that are acquired\nwith considerable effort and often require instruction.\nThis distinction between biologically primary abilities and biologically\nsecondary abilities allows us to explain results obtained by Goodnow and Bethon\n(1966). These researchers combined data on schooled and unschooled children in\nHong Kong and schooled children in the United States and discovered that \"lack\nof schooling does not upset the conservation of weight, volume, or surface but\ndoes upset a task of combinatorial reasoning\" (p. 573). It appears that solving the\nconservation tasks, the hallmark of Piaget's concrete operational stage, relies on\nbiologically primary abilities while the combinatorial task is more related to\nbiologically secondary abilities. Kuhn (1979) in her review of the educational\nimplications of formal operations implicitly recognizes this type of distinction:\nEvidence of the lack of universality in the attainment of a formal\noperational level of cognitive development suggests that there may be an\nimportant potential role for education to play in this attainment. This is a\nrole that is absent in the case of the earlier stages in Piaget's sequence,\ngiven the research evidence that all individuals within the normal range of\nintelligence attain the stage of concrete operations loses its force as a\nmeaningful curriculum objective: and a look at the history of Piaget-based\nearly childhood programs reveals that their curriculum objectives quite\nrapidly turned away from the teaching of concrete operations and toward\nother, quite different utilizations of Piaget's theory in an educational context\nAlthough using a different vocabulary, Kuhn's conclusion is remarkably\nsimilar to Geary's and Bjorklund's. Put more simply, many higher-level skills do\nnot come to most of us easily or naturally, rather they must be conquered through\na process of schooling.\nThe distinction between biologically primary and biologically secondary\nabilities has important educational consequences. Constructivism is a popular\neducational theory that traces its roots to Piaget (DeVries and Kohlberg, 1987;\nconstructivist viewpoint:\nClassroom \"learning\" is unnatural and something that does not occur in the\nearly years of life when a child learns a language, and something most\nadults avoid after they have escaped formal education. The implication of\nconstructivism, and of our elaborations on it, are to argue that children must\nhave access to the same natural learning processes they employ before they\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nenter school, and later, outside traditional classroom environments where\ninterest and dynamic functions operate. In the unnatural classroom\nenvironment this does not occur (p. 24).\nBy failing to distinguish between biologically primary and biologically\nsecondary abilities, Iran-Nejad deduces that because children acquire some skills\neasily with little instruction they can acquire all skills that way. Because\nconstructivists assume that all learning unfolds as part of the developmental\nprocess they often endorse student-centered approaches to education at all levels,\nassume that intrinsic motivation is always possible, and downplay the importance\nof acquiring a knowledge base. For example, Iran-Nejad (2001) calls for\nclassroom activities that:\npermit multiple sources of control to interact with the natural learning\nprocess that create knowledge. Attention must be directed and controlled by\nthe individual, as an outgrowth of interest and problem-solving behavior,\nnot controlled by the environment and forced by the teacher. Curiosity\nmust be stimulated for intrinsic learning (p. 27).\nPiaget has shown us, in his thorough and painstaking studies of the child,\nthat verbal understanding is superficial and \"deforming\"; learning, whether\nfor children or their teachers, comes only through the subject's own activity.\nThe ability and eagerness to learn, which is part of every child's birthright,\nis our greatest educational resource (p. 205).\nWhile no educator would disparage the importance of intrinsic motivation, there\nis ample evidence that for most students for most academic tasks, intrinsic\nRousseauian view that Piaget's work is often used to justify contrasts sharply with\nthe evolutionary perspective taken by Pinker (2002):\nEducation is neither writing on a blank slate nor allowing the child's\nnobility to come into flower. Rather, education is a technology that tries to\nmake up for what the human mind is innately bad at. Children don't have\nto go to school to learn to walk, talk recognize objects, or remember the\npersonalities of their friends, even though these tasks are much harder than\nreading, adding, or remembering dates in history. They do have to go to\nschool to learn written language, arithmetic, and science because these\nbodies of knowledge and skill were invented too recently for any species-\nwide knack for them to have evolved (p. 222).\nPiaget, Pedagogy, and Evolutionary Psychology\nIf this evolutionary view proposed by Pinker is correct, we would expect that\nas children move through their compulsory schooling and presumably from a\ncurriculum centered on concrete operational / biologically primary abilities to one\ncentered on formal operational / biologically secondary abilities that student\nmotivation would shift from intrinsic to extrinsic. This is exactly the pattern that\nwe find. Steinberg (1996) reports \"we know that early on \u00ad in preschool, for\nexample - children are highly intrinsically motivated and naturally curious, and\nthey need little in the way of extrinsic rewards to motivate them to participate\nenergetically in classroom activities (p. 73). Steinberg goes on to note that:\nRegardless of what parents and teachers wish, intrinsic motivation plays a\nrelatively small role in motivating student performance in adolescence and\nbeyond. In our survey, for example, the most common reason students gave\nfor trying hard in school was not genuine interest in the material, but getting\ngood grades in order to get into the college (p. 74).\nConstructivist theorists have contributed many useful ideas to make instruction\nmore interesting and meaningful. However, because they fail to distinguish\nbetween biologically primary abilities and biologically secondary abilities they do\nnot recognize that there are situations where these techniques may fall short.\nThey have erred in accepting an inadequate understanding of how cognitive skills\ndevelop and they have made the mistake of elevating a delimited set of\ninstructional techniques into an overarching philosophy of teaching. A pedagogy\ninformed by evolutionary psychology will, on the other hand, try to root teaching\nin a modern evolutionary understanding of cognitive development and recognize\nthat much academic learning will continue to be hard work requiring extrinsic\nsupport.\nReferences\nBrainerd, C.
