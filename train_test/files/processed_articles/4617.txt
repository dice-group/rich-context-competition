Levels of\ntrol; Table 2) and protein (each dose P< 0.05\nvs control; Table 2) were significantly upregu-\nlated by incubation with metformin.\nDiscussion\nMetformin has been shown to activate the\nadenosine monophosphate activated protein\nkinase (AMPK) signalling pathway and\ninhibit the activity of the downstream\nrelated enzyme in vivo, thereby regulating\nthe metabolism of glucose and lipids.18\nStudies have showed that metformin can\nsignificantly inhibit the growth and prolifer-\nation of a variety of tumour cells\nin vitro.11\u00ad14 It has been reported that\nmetformin slows bladder cancer progression\nby inhibiting stem cell repopulation through\nthe COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis in both\nanimal and cell models.19 The drug may\nalso be used as an adjuvant in combination\nwith antiproliferative modalities to improve\nthe outcome of patients with obesity-\nactivated thyroid cancer.20 In one study,\nlow doses of metformin were able to reduce\nproliferation of certain glioblastoma cells,21\nand it has been postulated that it may have a\nrole in the prevention and management of\nurological malignancies.22 In addition, met-\nformin has been shown to inhibit prostate\ncancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion\nand tumour growth mediated by upregula-\ntion of pigment epithelium-derived factor\n(PEDF) expression.23 Furthermore, metfor-\nmin had an effect on progenitor/stem cells in\na chemoprevention setting, and is being\ninvestigated as a potential early intervention\nin patients with chronic liver disease at high\nrisk of hepatocellular carcinoma.24 Another\nstudy has reported that metformin inhibits\nthe proliferation of human keratinocytes by\nregulating the MAPK and Akt signalling\npathways.25 The results of our study showed\nsuppressed the proliferation of human hypo-\npharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu) in a\ndose- and time-dependent manner over 12\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of\nendogenous, single-stranded non-protein-\nexpression of target genes at a posttranscrip-\ntional level, and play a vital role in cell\ndifferentiation, biological development and\ndisease occurrence and progression.26\u00ad28\nSeveral miRNAs are located in tumour sus-\nceptibility loci, and their abnormal expres-\nsion has a close relationship with cell\ncancerization. For example, miR-21-5p is\nTable 2.

Metformin\nsignificantly downregulated miR-21-5p, and\nupregulated PDCD4 mRNA and protein,\nwhile significantly inhibiting cell proliferation.\nA limitation of this study is that these in vitro\nfindings may not be representative of the\nin vivo environment. Further in vivo studies\nare therefore required to validate our findings.\nIn conclusion, metformin inhibited the\nproliferation of FaDu cells in vitro. This\nmay be associated with the downregulation\nof miR-21-5p expression and the upregula-\ntion of PDCD4 expression.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Shandong\nProvincial Natural Science Foundation, China\nReferences\n1.
