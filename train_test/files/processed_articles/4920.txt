The results showed (1) traits indicating social status and parental investment were more highly valued by the parents,\nwhile traits indicating genetic quality and traits related to romantic love were more highly valued by the children. (2) Parental\npreferences were moderated by gender of the in-laws. Good earning capacity was more preferred by parents in a son-in-law,\ntraits connoting genetic quality and reproductive fitness were more preferred by parents in a daughter-in-law. (3) There was more\nconvergence in in-law and mate preferences in Chinese culture than in Western cultures. (4) Traditional cultural values (i.e., filial\npiety) can be used as a predictor of traditional mate preferences and less parent\u00adchild divergences. Additionally, greater\npreference for kind and understanding by parents than by children as well as by daughters than by sons, and greater preference\nfor social status by the daughters' than by the sons' parents have not been observed in the rating and the ranking instrument.\nThese findings illustrated how culture handles the parent\u00adchild disagreement over mating by authorizing greater parental\ninfluence on children's mating decisions.\n",

However, the traits desired\nby the parents do not necessarily maximize the genetic interests\nof their children, given that parents and children have a coeffi-\ncient of genetic relatedness of 0.50. Specifically, the parents\nprefer their child having a mate of high parental investment that\nis beneficial for all the parents' children and grandchildren, and\nthe child prefers having a mate of high genetic quality, because\nhe or she may obtain more genetic benefits for his or her own\noffspring than the parents (Apostolou, 2016; Buunk, Park, &\nalso disagreement regarding what is considered an ideal mate\nParent\u00adoffspring divergence in mate preferences seems to\nbe universal, but the degree to which children adopt parental\npreferences may also vary across cultures (Bejanyan, Marshall,\na crucial cultural dimension for understanding human behavior\nin different populations, individualism\u00adcollectivism (Hofstede,\n1980) has been found to be strongly associated with the level of\ntures encourage independence and uniqueness, advocating\n1 Department of Psychology, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, People's\nRepublic of China\nCorresponding Author:\nYujie Li, Department of Psychology, Shandong Normal University, No. 88 East\nEvolutionary Psychology\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/\nby/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE\nand Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nself-determination, and personal choice. In individualistic\ncultures, the qualities seen as desirable in a mate are a personal\nmatter.

By moralizing\nchildren's obedience to family elders and authorizing parental\ncontrol over the children's mate preferences and mating stra-\ntegies, filial piety may successfully solve an evolutionary\nproblem for parents (Nichol, 2013). Children are socialized\nto be deferential and obedient to family elders, prioritizing the\ninterests of family members and extended family members\nover their own. Children who violate filial obligations always\nexperience negative emotions such as guilt and shame\n(Schwartz et al., 2010). This can lead to significantly greater\nharmony between parents and children compared with their\nWestern counterparts. In this study, we used Chinese parent\u00ad\nchild dyads as participants to directly compare their in-law\nand mate preferences. This will make a valuable addition to\nthe emerging evolutionary psychological literature testing\nparent\u00adoffspring conflict theory (Schlomer et al., 2011; Trivers,\nDivergence Between In-Law and Mate Preferences\nParents and children are genetically related but not genetically\nidentical. This translates into overlapping as well as diverging\nin-law and mate preferences. A child's marriage can increase\nhis or her parent's inclusive fitness by (1) leading to the pro-\nduction of genetically high-quality grandchildren and (2) for-\nging political alliances that increase the fitness of kin other than\nthe betrothed. Because grandchildren are half as genetically\nrelated to grandparents as they are to parents, prospective\ngrandparents will tend to weight the production of healthy\ngrandchildren as relatively less important as prospective par-\n1974). Genetic quality, as indexed by traits such as physical\nattractiveness, athleticism, creativity, and intelligence, can\nbring about asymmetric costs and benefits for parents and for\nchildren. Higher genetic quality in a mate may result in heal-\nthier, more attractive, and probably more successful offspring.\nBut an individual can reap more genetic benefits from a geneti-\ncally high-quality mate than his or her parents from a geneti-\ncally high-quality in-law, because he or she share more genetic\noverlap with his or her own children (50%) than his or her\nparents with their grandchildren (25%). If children's mate\nselection is based on their own preferences, they should give\nmore weight to genetic quality in a potential mate than parents\nThere are also characteristics (e.g., good family background)\nthat are more preferred in an in-law than in a spouse (Buunk\ntics can extend parents' cooperative alliances and enhance their\nstatus, giving more fitness benefits to parents than to children.\nHowever, the discrepancy mentioned above may only make\nsense if there is a cost to the parents. That is, if a genetically\nhigh-quality mate is a bad parent, or if parents prioritize other\ntraits over genetic quality.\nThe divergence in mate preferences between parents and\nchildren, especially between parents' and daughters', can also\nbe understood in terms of evolutionary trade-offs (Gangestad\nof benefit inevitably reduces the likelihood of obtaining\nanother type of benefit. From a biological point of view, the\nbenefits provided by a mate can be grouped into two main\nclusters: heritable fitness and parental investment. High\ngenetic quality in an in-law contributes to parents' fitness\nthrough the birth of genetically high-quality offspring (i.e.,\nthe parents' grandchildren). However, individuals of high\ngenetic quality may probably be poorer quality parents, as\nthey tend to invest more effort into seeking new mates than\nwith a partner of high genetic quality, but low investment\npotential may lead a daughter to depend on her parents and\nother kin for support. This will limit the parents' ability to\ninvest in their children and grandchildren. Moreover, an in-\nlaw of good investment potential can bring fitness interests to\nthe parents and their family through protection and resources\nprovision or childcare. As a consequence, when evaluating the\nsuitability of a potential in-law, parents would place more\nvalue on traits indicating parental investment and cooperation\nwith in-group compared with the children themselves.\nFindings suggest that parents are more interested in control-\nling their daughters' than their sons' mating decisions (Apos-\nin her offspring, so the trade-off between good-provider and\ngood-genes selection is especially relevant for daughters\n(Buunk et al., 2008). So a son-in-law of good investment poten-\ntial is more highly valued by the daughter's parents than by the\ndaughter herself. Selecting an investing son-in-law is espe-\ncially important for survival of the daughters' children, as par-\nents are certain that they are genetically related to the offspring\nof their daughter than to that of their son. If a son-in-law is a\npoor investor, the parents are pressured to take the responsibil-\nity to invest in their daughter's offspring themselves (Perilloux\net al., 2008). Moreover, females are especially valuable repro-\nductive resource in the mating markets to which males strive to\naccess. While a sexual adventure can damage a daughter's\nreputation and decrease her long-term mate value, leading to\ndetrimental consequences for her parents' fitness interests\nsuccessful control of their daughters' mating behaviors may\nenable the parents to maximize their own inclusive fitness by\nextracting more resources from their sons-in-law or by building\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nnew alliances and elevating social status. In some cultures,\nparents may even pressure their daughters to marry into a\nfamily with economic success and strong social standing\nwe can infer that parents may be choosier in the selection of a\nson-in-laws versus a daughter-in-laws, as parents are more\nlikely to exert stricter control over the daughters' versus the\nsons' mating decisions (Buunk et al., 2008).\nRecent literature has explored the areas of divergence in\nmate and in-law preferences (see Apostolou, 2015b, for a\nreview). For example, Perilloux, Fleischman, and Buss\n(2011) compared the students' preferences for 13 traits in a\nprospective mate with their actual parents' preferences for the\nsame set of traits in a prospective in-law. They found that traits\nsuch as religious, good housekeeper, earning capacity, healthy,\nand kindness were more preferred by parents in an in-law\n(Perilloux et al., 2011), while physical attractiveness and excit-\ning personality were more highly valued by offspring in a\nspouse. Similarly, in Chinese immigrants to North America,\nHynie, Lalonde, and Lee (2006) found that traditional mate\ncharacteristics (e.g., chastity, housekeeping abilities, having\nstrong cultural ties, and wanting children) are more preferred\nby the parents in an in-law than by the children in a spouse.\nIn another line of research, participants were asked to act as\nparents and express their in-law preferences and act as children\nand express their mate preferences. Results showed that the\nparticipants valued attractiveness and exciting personality\nmore in a spouse than in an in-law and valued good family\nbackground and similar religious background more in an in-\nBecause selecting an in-law of desirable backgrounds is helpful\nfor parents to strengthen family relations and build new\nUsing a similar methodology, participants were given\nspecific negative traits (i.e., unattractive and bad family back-\nground, etc.) in a potential mate, and where asked to rate\nwhether said traits would be relatively more unacceptable to\nthemselves or to their parents (Buunk et al., 2008; Dubbs &\nconnoting a lack of heritable fitness (e.g., attractiveness) were\nconsidered more unacceptable to the children, while a lack of\ntraits connoting parental investment and cooperation with\nin-group (e.g., good family background and similar religious\nbackground) was considered more unacceptable to their par-\nents. Lacking traits related to romantic love (e.g., exciting per-\nsonality, a sense of humor) was more acceptable to children\nthan to parents because such traits are correlates of genetic\nquality and can facilitate amicable cohabitation and coopera-\ntion in love-based marriage relationships (Buunk et al., 2008).\nThe Influences of Culture\nParental influences on their children's mate selection are con-\nsiderably different across cultures (Apostolou, 2010b; Bejan-\nthat advocate freedom of personal choice, mate selection is\nmainly based on personal preferences, stressing mutual love\nand attraction (Buunk et al., 2010). Individuals are encouraged\nto exercise personal control over their mate selection and\nrelationship maintenance. In collectivist cultures where the\nwell-being of the in-group is prioritized over individuals' own\nneeds, building new alliances is often a key objective for\nmarriage. Parents and close kin are often involved in partner\nselection by directly choosing the spouse or introducing\npotential partners to one another (Buunk et al., 2010; MacDo-\nnald, Marshall, Gere, Shimotomai, & Lies, 2012). Children's\nmarriage is often utilized by their parents to forge new alli-\nances, strengthen social standing, and continue family line\nof parental influence in mate selection leads the offspring to\nadopt and internalize parental preferences, resulting in lower\nlevels of parents\u00adchild discrepancy.\nEndorsement of traditional mate characteristics and\ngreater parent\u00adchild convergence regarding mate prefer-\nences have indeed been observed in collectivist cultures.\nA cross-cultural study (Buss et al., 1990) found that the\ncollectivists placed greater value on traditional mate char-\nacteristics such as health, desire for children, chastity, and\ndomestic skills of the potential mates, and fewer values\nwere given to dependability, mutual attraction, sociability,\npleasing disposition, exciting personality, and appearance.\nBejanyan, Marshall, and Ferenczi (2015) found that the col-\nlectivists (i.e., Indian) tended to accept greater parental\ninfluence on their mate choice, which contributed to a\nsmaller gap between adult children's preferences for the\nqualities signifying status resources in a spouse and their\nperception of their parents' preferences. The collectivists\nalso reported greater family allocentrism (Bejanyan et al.,\n2015), characterized as the closeness family members feel\ntoward one another, which contributed to the smaller dis-\ncrepancy between their own preferences for qualities sig-\nnifying warmth trustworthiness in a spouse and their\nperception of their parents' preferences.\nChina is a typical collectivist society (Hofstede, 1980) char-\nacterized by the ideology of filial piety that stipulates chil-\ndren's obligations and duties to their parents, familial elders,\nand ancestors through a set of closely related behaviors, ritual\npractices, dispositions, and mental states (Nichols, 2013; Smith\n& Hung, 2012). Children often comply with parental wishes\nand strive to meet the expectations set by their parents, leading\nto the children's mate preferences being in greater harmony\nwith their parents' in-law preferences than populations else-\nwhere in the world (Nichols, 2013). China has a long history\nof Confucian sex ideology in favor of male power over female.\nWomen have been traditionally required to be submissive to\nmen and to stay in family to support the male members of the\nfamily. Woman should be obedient to her father and older\nbrothers before marriage, obedient to her husband after mar-\nriage, and obedient to her sons in widowhood (Chia, Allred, &\nsuperior gender norm has been dominating China for over\nGuo et al. 3\n2,500 years and is still influential in present society. Recent\nstudies reveal that males' main responsibilities are supporting\nthe family; females' main responsibilities are household and\nchild-rearing tasks (Chia et al., 1997; Chen, Fiske, & Lee,\n2009). In these cultural and historical settings, the mate prefer-\nences of the Chinese are expected to be different from those of\nthe Westerners.\nThe Present Study\nRecent literature suggests that parental influence should be\ntaken into consideration when applying theories of sexual\nselection (e.g., Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson,\n2000). Across different cultures and time, humans often have\nlimited freedom and autonomy in mate choice (Apostolou,\n2010a, b). Human mate preferences can also be substantially\naffected by culture. Across the 31 characteristics examined by\nBuss et al. (1990), culture accounted for an average of 14% of\nthe variance. Cultural variations have also been observed in\nparent\u00adchild discrepancy over mating, with greater parental\ninfluence on mating in collectivist cultures than in individua-\nThere is still a scarcity of literature investigating parental\ninfluence over mating in mainland China, one of the most\ncollectivist societies (Hofstede, 1980) characterized by a\nhigh endorsement of filial piety. Unlike other collectivist\nvalues (e.g., communalism, familism), the ideology of filial\npiety primarily emphasizes the value of obedience of chil-\ndren to parents. This enables the parents to extract more\nresources out of their children and impose special obliga-\ntions on children concerning reproductive behaviors and\nmate selection (Nichols, 2013). As a consequence, Chinese\nadult children are more likely to accept their parents' influ-\nence or develop mate preferences similar to their parents\nand show more preferences for traditional marriage values\nthan participants everywhere in the world (Buss et al., 1990;\nThis is the first study designed to directly compare mate and\nin-law preferences in Chinese culture. Some findings are\nexpected to be culturally universal that reflects human evolved\npredispositions (Apostolou, 2008a). For example, traits indicat-\ning parental investment and cooperation with the in-group\nshould be more preferred by Chinese parents in an in-law,\nwhile traits indicating genetic quality and traits related to\nromantic love should be more preferred by Chinese children\nences in an in-law should also be moderated by the gender of\nthe in-law. Most importantly, there should be cultural-specific\nfindings that can be explained by traditional cultural values\ncharacterized by the ideology of filial piety. Specifically, there\nshould be less parent\u00adchild divergence in mate preferences in\nChinese culture than in Western cultures (Hypothesis 1). Filial\npiety can be used as a predictor of Chinese children's tradi-\ntional mate preferences and less parent\u00adchild divergence in\nmating (Hypothesis 2).\nMethod\nResearch Instruments\nFactors in choosing a mate. This is a rating instrument (i.e., a\nnormative scale) used by Buss et al. (1990). Its Chinese version\nwas introduced by Chang, Wang, Shackelford, and Buss\n(2011). The participants were requested to rate each of the 18\ncharacteristics on a 4-point scale with 3 \u00bc indispensable and\n0 \u00bc unimportant according to their importance in choosing a\nlong-term mate.\nPreferences concerning potential mates. This is a ranking instru-\nment (i.e., an ipsative scale) used by Buss et al. (1990) and its\nChinese version was also introduced by Chang et al. (2011).\nThe participants were requested to rank the 13 characteristics\nfrom most desirable (the rank is 1) to 13th desirable (the rank is\n13) in a potential long-term mate, and each of the characteris-\ntics should be assigned a number according to their importance.\nGiven that the ipsative scales can only capture relative rather\nthan absolute importance of the characteristics in the scales\nwith no variance of the total scores across participants, we\nprimarily relied on findings in the rating instrument for com-\nparisons. Because findings from the ranking instrument should\ndiffer predictably in magnitude, but not in direction, from find-\nings from the rating instruments (Feingold, 1992).\nThe Filial Piety Scale (FPS). FPS was developed by Ho (1994) to\nassess filial attitudes (e.g., \"After the father has passed away,\nsons and daughters must conduct themselves according to\nthe principles and attitudes the father followed while he was\nstill living,\" \"No matter how their parents conduct them-\nselves, sons and daughters must respect them\"). All the\n22 items in FPS were scored on a 7-point scale ranging from\n1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Cronbach's a\nwas .88 in this study.\nParticipants and Procedure\nThe study was conducted under the approval of the institu-\ntional review board at Shandong Normal University. We\nrecruited 351 undergraduates from a university in East China\nwith students coming from all over the country. After deleting\ninvalid cases due to incomplete responses, there were 347\nundergraduates (160 sons, Mage\ndaughters, Mage\n\u00bc\n\u00bc\ndyads, and 162 daughter\u00adfather dyads. Each participant\nreceived five gel pens for compensation.\nAfter the undergraduates filled out the research instru-\nments, they were required to send home the research instru-\nments for their parents together with elaborate instructions.\nOnly the rating and the ranking instruments were admini-\nstrated to the parents. The male and female parents were\ninstructed to independently indicate their preferences for an\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nin-law in the research instruments that were required to be\nmailed back. The instructions for parents were transformed\ninto the following words:\nImagine that your child who is in our university is choosing\na long-term mate, you have right to express opinions on\nwhat characteristics the prospective mate should have.\nPlease rate (or rank) these characteristics according to their\nimportance. If your child is a daughter, you are expressing\nyour preferences in a son-in-law; if your child is a son, you\nare expressing your preferences in a daughter-in-law. Your\nopinions are important for us.\nResults\nBefore data analysis, we averaged the rating/ranking scores of\neach child's parents together to get a parental rating/ranking\nscore for each trait for that child. For the single-parent child,\nthe mother's or the father's scores were used as the parents'\nscores. A grand mean of the items in the rating instrument but\nnot in the ranking instrument was calculated.\nComparing In-Law and Mate Preferences\nDescriptive statistics were shown in Table 1 (the rating instru-\nment) and Table 2 (the ranking instrument).\nTo analyze parent\u00adchild divergence in the 31 characteris-\ntics, General Linear Models (GLMs) were conducted with one\nwithin-subject factor (child vs. parent) and one between-\nsubject factor (male vs. female).\nFirstly, we analyzed the main effects of generation.

This should be treated as another\nheritage of traditional Chinese cultural values.\nFilial Piety as a Predictor of Preference for Traditional\nTraits (PTTs) and Less Parent\u00adChild Divergence\nCorrelations between filial piety and individual items are\nshown in Table 3 (the rating instrument) and Table 4 (the\nranking instrument).\nWe predicted that in Chinese culture, there is less parent\u00ad\nchild divergence regarding what constitute an ideal mate for the\nchildren. Spearman's correlation and effect sizes (Cohen,\n1992) were calculated as the indicators of overall parent\u00adchild\nconvergence in mate preference. In the rating instrument, the\ncorrelation between parents and children, between parents and\nsons, and between parents and daughters were .94, .96, and .93,\nrespectively (Cohen's d \u00bc .23, .32, and .25). In the ranking\ninstrument, the correlations were .95, .94, and .94, respectively\n(Cohen's d \u00bc .30, .37, and .32). These correlation coefficients\nwere higher than those we calculated using the data of an\nAmerican sample reported by Perilloux et al. (2011), which\n.27). A medium effect size (Cohen, 1992) was only observed in\nthe American sample. These results suggested more parent\u00ad\nchild convergence in Chinese culture.\nWe further hypothesized that more parent\u00adchild conver-\ngence in Chinese culture can be attributed to children's PTTs,\nwhich may be explained by filial piety. Based on the previous\ncharacteristics (similar political background, similar educa-\ntional background, favorable social status, desire for home\nand children, good cook and housekeeper, good health, good\nfinancial prospect, chastity, sociability, and similar religious\nbackground) to measure the PTTs. These items were aver-\naged to create a PTT Scale, with internal consistency (Cron-\nbach's a) acceptable both for parents (a \u00bc .70) and for\nchildren (a \u00bc .70). Results showed that the children's filial\npiety scores was related to their PTT scores, r \u00bc .18, p < .01\n(two-tailed), but was not related to their parents' PTT scores,\nr \u00bc \u00c0.04, p \u00bc .49 (two-tailed). Filial piety also correlated\nnegatively with the absolute parent\u00adchild PTT score differ-\nence, r \u00bc \u00c0.16, p < .01 (two-tailed). For items in the rating\ninstrument, filial piety correlated positively with similar\npolitical background, r \u00bc .12, p < .05 (two-tailed), desire for\nhome and children, r \u00bc .24, p < .001 (two-tailed), good cook\nand housekeeper, r \u00bc .15, p < .01 (two-tailed), chastity, r \u00bc\n(two-tailed); and negatively with education and intelligence,\nr \u00bc \u00c0.11, p < .05 (two-tailed).

Filial piety also correlated\nnegatively with the absolute parent\u00adchild score difference in\ncreative and artistic, r \u00bc \u00c0.12, p < .05 (two-tailed), and wants\nchildren, r \u00bc \u00c0.13, p < .05 (two-tailed). But we failed to create\na reliable scale measuring the PTTs.\nThese results indicated that the children who endorsed the\nideology of filial piety were more likely to accept traditional\nmarriage values and develop mate preferences similar to their\nparents and were less likely to value characteristics indicating\ngenetic quality and traits related to romantic love.\nDiscussion\nIn human history, evolutionary pressures have resulted in in-\nlaw and mate preferences to diverge (Gangestad, Haselton, &\nBuss, 2006). Both parents and children have evolved mating\npreferences which enable the two parties to select mates and\nin-laws to maximize the inclusive fitness of their own (Apos-\net al., 2011). Results in this study are consistent with these\nfindings. Traits indicating parental investment and traditional\nvalues were more highly valued by the parents, while traits\nindicating genetic quality and romantic love were more\nhighly valued by the children. Chinese parents preferred\ncharacteristics such as the similar religious background in\nan in-law more so than the children in a spouse. Chinese\nchildren preferred characteristics such as dependable charac-\nter and good looks in a spouse more so than the parents in an\nin-law. Good financial prospect and sociability were more\npreferred in a son-in-law than in a daughter-in-law by the\nparents. Traits connoting genetic quality and reproductive\nfitness (e.g., physical attractiveness) and traits related to fam-\nily care (e.g., good cook and housekeeper) were more pre-\nferred by the parents for a daughter-in-law than a son-in-law.\nThese results suggested that the nature of parent\u00adchild diver-\ngence over mating may be a cultural universal.\nLess Divergence Between In-law and Mate Preferences\nand the Role of Traditional Cultural Values\nHowever, this study also has revealed some culture-specific\nfindings that should be interpreted by Chinese traditional cul-\ntural values. This study found more parent\u00adchild convergences\nin mate preferences compared with Western samples (Perilloux\net al., 2011). This is in line with previous findings that East\nAsians tend to accept more parental influence on mate choice\nthan Europeans and European Americans (Buunk et al., 2010,\nChinese children to accept traditional marriage values, result-\ning in less parent\u00adchild divergence in mating. This finding is\nfurther supported by literature showing that Taiwanese adoles-\ncents with stronger filial beliefs were found to be less likely to\nexperience parent\u00adchild conflict (Yeh & Bedford, 2004).\nTherefore, both Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported.\nIn China, the disagreement in in-law and mate preferences\ncan be handled effectively in a cultural-specific way. That is,\nparent\u00adoffspring conflict over mating that arises from diver-\nging genetic interests can be handled in a way that it does not\nescalate. Through the internalization of filial obligations,\nchildren are more willing to accept the traditional marriage\nvalues (continuing family line, enlarging family resources,\nimproving social status, and bringing honor to ancestors) and\nare less committed to love-based marriages. The desire for\nchastity in a potential mate is a good testimony to show the\ninternalization of parental preferences in Chinese children's\nmating behaviors. Buss et al. (1990) observed stronger desir-\nability for chastity in a potential mate in both Chinese males\nand females, indicating stronger traditional mate preferences\nthan the participants everywhere in the world.\nThe Daughters' Parents Were Not More Demanding\nThan the Sons' Parents\nParents are supposed to be more demanding in selecting a son-\nin-law than a daughter-in-law (Buunk et al., 2008). For\nTable 4. Correlations Between Filial Piety and Parent\u00adOffspring Divergence (Ranking Instrument).\nCharacteristics Offspring Father\u00adOffspring Difference Mother\u00adOffspring Difference Parent\u00adOffspring Difference\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nsocieties and found that parents valued wealth, working ability,\nsocial status, and good economic prospects more in a son-in-\nlaw than in a daughter-in-law. Only chastity was valued by the\nparents more in a daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law.\nBut in this study, the daughters' parents were even less\ndemanding than the son's parents (though the difference was\nnot significant). There are evolutionary explanations for this\nphenomenon. Parents are expected to be more vigilant partic-\nularly about a daughter's early sexual activity because it is\nmore likely to drain their own resources if it leads to a child\nout of \"wedlock\" (Perilloux et al., 2008). But this does not\nnecessarily result in more choosiness in selecting a long-term\nmate for a daughter. On the other hand, the sons' parents could\nalso be stricter in in-law selection. If a daughter-in-law is\nunfaithful or does not take good care of her offspring, the\nparents may run the risk of losing all investments in their son\nBut Chinese culture should also be taken into account when\nunderstanding this phenomenon. After a female is married, she\nbecomes a member of her husband's family unit (this is seldom\nthe case for a male) and takes the responsibility to bear children\nto continue the family line of her husband's paternal ancestors\nwell educated and comes from good family background, she is\nexpected to be capable of rearing high-quality children. More-\nover, in traditional China, wealth was inherited through the\nmale line from father to son (Nichols, 2013; Smith & Hung,\n2012). A virtuous (e.g., chaste, filial, and industrious)\ndaughter-in-law played a key role in enhancing cooperation\nwith in-group, maintaining and enlarging family property, and\nraising family standing. Additionally, when the parents get\nolder and gradually lose control over family resources, they\nmainly depend on daughter-in-laws for elderly care (Cook &\nOther Culture-specific Findings\nThis study has revealed some interesting findings that should\nbe interpreted by Chinese traditional values and gender role\nideology. First, desire for home and children and healthy were\nmore preferred by the parents in an in-law than by the children\nin a spouse, while in Western cultures (e.g., Perilloux et al.,\n2011) this phenomenon has not been observed. These results\nagain revealed that Chinese parents prefer in-laws with tradi-\ntional traits in order to continue ancestral line (Hynie et al.,\n2006). In China, the piety of a son is proportional to the number\nof and quality of children, and bearing a male heir was the son's\nhighest duty. The desire for children is also preferred by the\ndaughters' parents in a son-in-law because their daughters'\nmarriages might be stabilized by the birth of babies. Second,\nkind and understanding was more preferred by parents than by\nchildren and was more preferred by daughters than by sons in\nWestern samples (Perilloux et al., 2011). As a kind mate is\nmore willing to dedicate time and energy in childcare. But in\nthis study, kind and understanding was less preferred by\nparents than by children and was less preferred by female than\nby male participants. This suggests that kindness was less val-\nued by parents (especially the daughters') than by children. For\nthe parents (especially the daughters'), generosity of an in-law\nmay result in resources being allocated to genetically unrelated\nones (Guo, Feng, & Wang, 2017; Oda, Shibata, Kiyonari,\nTakeda, & Matsumoto-Oda, 2013). But for the children, kind-\nness is important for love-based marriage because it can pro-\nmote a harmonious partnership and amicable cohabitation\n(Apostolou, 2008b). Third, Western parents prefer working\nability and social status more in a son-in-law than in a\nstudy these differences have not been observed, given that the\nin-laws' social status and ambition and industries were highly\nvalued both by the sons' and daughter's parents. This can also\nbe interpreted as the influence of traditional culture values and\ngender role socialization in Chinese society. An industrious,\nhigh social status daughter-in-law is capable of rearing high-\nquality children and taking care of family elders, these charac-\nteristics are especially valuable for the son's parents (Nichols,\nFindings in this study add to the literature illustrating how\ncultural values have shaped human mating behaviors (Buunk\net al., 2010). Humans have evolved psychological adaptations\nthat are specifically designed to receive and process variable\nsocial and cultural input. Thus, they are exceptionally respon-\nsive to the cultural environments they are exposed to (Gang-\nestad et al., 2006). Taking into account parental influences,\nsocial and ecological conditions may enable us to more accu-\nrately understand the evolution of human mating behavior\nSome findings in this study may not be specific to Chinese\nethnic groups. Literature shows that filial piety, familism, and\ncommunalism share a common thread in stressing the impor-\ntance of social ties over individual interests and valuing the\nneeds of the in-group over the needs of individual person\n(Schwartz et al., 2010). We infer that people from other col-\nlectivist cultures may also be more likely to accept traditional\nmate values and have mate preferences more similar to their\nparents' in-law preferences. This may be particularly the case\nin places where people live near their parents and extended\nfamilies and depend on kin. Even in Western samples, the\nparticipants who are more concerned about their parents' opi-\nnions are more likely to shift their mate preferences to conform\nto those of their parents (Dubbs et al., 2012). That is, the indi-\nviduals' sensitivity toward parents is positively linked with\ntheir preferences for parental investment and cooperation in a\npotential mate.\nThis work is not without limitations. One being that it exam-\nined in-law preferences using instruments containing a greater\nnumber of traditional/parental investment traits, compared to\ntraits indicative of genetic quality. Future studies should\ninclude more traits that in theory children would prefer in a\nmate. Furthermore, this study found that Chinese children are\nsocialized to accept traditional marriage values and develop\nmate preferences similar to their parents. This proposition was\nGuo et al. 9\nsupported by the positive correlation between filial piety and\ntraditional mate preference. We further proposed that filial\npiety should be negatively correlated with the preferences for\ncharacteristics indicating genetic quality and traits related to\nromantic love. However, using the items in the research instru-\nments in this study, we failed to construct a reliable scale\nmeasuring the preference for genetic quality and the preference\nfor traits related to romantic love. A future study is encouraged\nto address this issue using items developed in recent literature\nAnother limitation is that this study was conducted only in\nChinese culture setting, leaving in-law and mate preferences\nnot being directly compared in other collectivist cultures, such\nas Africa, Arab countries, India, and Spanish-speaking coun-\ntries (Schwartz et al., 2010). Future work needs to replicate\nthese findings in different samples and in different cultural\nsettings. Furthermore, in this study, filial piety only showed a\nrather limited power in predicting parent\u00adchild convergence in\nmate preferences. One reason may be that the FPS (Ho, 1994)\nused in this study only measures filial belief, which might\nrarely be reflected in actual behaviors (Chow & Chu, 2007).\nAnother reason is that filial piety may be a multidimensional\nexpected to explore whether multidimensional filial piety\nconstruct can better predict the parent\u00adchild agreement over\nmating. Additionally, findings in this study were based on\nself-report data, we are not sure whether filial piety can reduce\nparent\u00adoffspring divergence in real-life situations. Future\nnaturalistic studies may overcome this limitation.\nPrevious literature also suggests that mate values of an indi-\nvidual who excises mate selection also influence the mate pre-\nferences of that individual and his or her parents (Apostolou,\nies should take into account mate values of an individual (e.g.,\nphysical attractiveness, height, health, income, social status,\neducation, and personality) and those of his or her parents when\nexamining parent\u00adchild convergence and divergence over\nmating (Chang et al., 2017). Social\u00adeconomic status and size\nof a family also influence the parents' ability to invest into their\nchild and grandchildren (Lawson & Mace, 2010). These factors\nare recommended to be included in future studies.\nThis is the first study that directly compared in-law and mate\npreferences in Chinese culture, illustrating how parent\u00adchild\ndisagreement over mating could be handled in a culturally\nspecific way. In China and probably other collectivist societies,\nchildren are socialized to adopt and internalize parental prefer-\nences, resulting in low level of divergence in mate and in-law\npreferences. More specifically, traditional culture values\n(e.g., filial piety) can handle the parent\u00adchild disagreement\nover mating that arises from diverging genetic interests in a\nway that it does not escalate.\nAuthors' Contribution\nQingke Guo conceived and designed the experiment and written the\nmanuscript.
