While discourse on school bullying is abundant, previous studies are limited in explaining\nthe predictive effect of factors such as individual/demographic variables, school environmental variables, and school antibullying\npreventive measures. Using a nationally representative sample of 12,987 private and public school students in the United States,\nthe current study examines school safety measures and students' perceptions about school environments (or climate), especially\nschool rules and punishment. Findings reveal that the variables of security guards, fairness and awareness of school rules, gangs\nand guns at school, students misbehaving, and teachers' punishment of students were statistically significant predictors of bullying\nvictimization. Implications of these findings for school anti-bullying programs as well as directions for future research are discussed.\n1. Introduction\nIn recent decades, school bullying and victimization, which\ncontinues to be a serious social and health problem in the\nUnited States, has received extraordinary levels of attention\nfrom the public, criminal justice practitioners, academicians,\nand educators [1\u00ad3]. A significant number of empirical stud-\nies indicate that bullying and victimization is an increasing\nproblem on school grounds and one that has negative conse-\nquences for both bullies and their victims [3\u00ad8]. For example,\npercent of students reported being bullied at school, while\n[9]. Recently, Dinkes et al. [10] found that 75 percent of US\npublic school principals indicated that schools reported one\nor more violent incidents to the police, and 25 percent of\npublic schools reported school bullying on a daily/weekly\nbasis. Numerous studies [11\u00ad15] also document that school\nbullying is physically and psychologically detrimental to the\nvictims.\nLimited empirical studies [16\u00ad22] have examined pre-\ndictors of bullying victimization, and few have focused on\nindividual and school-related factors. Yet these studies found\nthat individual demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and\nrace) and school characteristics (e.g., presence of gangs at\nschool, and police/school staff members' supervision) are\nsignificantly related to victimization. For example, a study\nby DeVoe et al. [17] found that victims of school bullying\nare more likely to be younger and white and to report the\npresence of gangs in their schools.\nMost previous research on bullying, however, suffers\nfrom several limitations. First, the majority of prior research\nhas focused on bullies, types of bullying, and related pre-\nvention/intervention strategies. Second, many studies have\nfocused on physically aggressive bullying and victimization\nwhile ignoring psychologically/emotionally aggressive vic-\ntimization, despite the fact that many children are known\nto be bullied not only physically, but also psychologi-\ncally/emotionally [3, 23]. Third, while schools have attempted\nto create safer environments by implementing a variety of\n2  \npreventive strategies and programs, such as the use of school\nsecurity technologies (e.g., metal detectors, and surveillance\ncameras), school security guards, and anti-school-bullying\nprograms during the last decade, few studies have examined\nwhether these preventive strategies and technologies have any\nsignificant effect on reducing bullying victimization [17, 22].\nThe current study, using a nationally representative\nsample of adolescents in the United States, takes a more\nholistic approach and addresses these limitations. Primarily,\nthe focus of the current study is to determine whether\nvarious school safety strategies, the school environment, and\nindividual social demographic factors are significantly related\nto each of the school bullying victimization categories. It is\nhypothesized that students who attend schools where there is\na heightened safety outlook (including school safety strategies\nfor a more safe and protective school environment/climate)\nwill have less incidents of victimization than schools that\ndo not have such an environment. Additionally, this study\nwill examine three different categories of school bullying\nvictimization (physical, psychological, and both physical and\npsychological bullying victimization) in an effort to help\nschools develop more strategic plans for reducing bullying\nand victimization.\n1.1. School Bullying Victimization and Negative Consequences.\nAccording to Olweus [13], school bullying is defined as\nphysical and/or emotional harm inflicted by students within\nthe geographical boundaries of a school campus. More often,\nbullying includes repeated incidents of harm, is generally\ncharacterized by an imbalance of power and/or an asym-\nmetrical relationship among students [7, 13], and harm is\ndirected at specific students (or targets) [24]. Victimization\n(being bullied) of school bullying is therefore defined as\nrepeated exposure to physical and emotional harm from more\npowerful students on campus [13].\nAlthough the prevalence of victimization of school bul-\nlying varies in empirical studies, prior research has found\nthat a significant number of children have been victims of\nschool bullying [13, 25\u00ad27]. For example, a study by Silvernail\net al. [26], using a sample of 4,496 youths in public schools,\nfound that 41 percent of students reported being teased in a\nmean way and 38 percent reported being victims of physical\nbullying (i.e., being hit, kicked, and/or pushed). Orpinas\net al. [25] found that almost half of the students in the\nsample were victims of physical bullying and similar numbers\nwere emotionally and/or verbally bullied at school. More\nrecently, the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicated that\napproximately 8 percent of adolescents (aged 12\u00ad18 years)\nin the sample were being threatened and injured by other\nstudents. Overall, the results consistently report that our\nchildren are victimized by other students on school ground.\nA number of empirical studies have found that school\nbullying has detrimental effects on a victim's physical and\npsychological well-being and also hurts his/her academic\nstanding [7, 28\u00ad35]. For example, victims of school bullying\nare more likely to suffer serious mental health disorders,\nsuch as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and unhappiness,\nIn addition, bullied victims are more likely to experience\nrelational problems with their school peers, to be rejected\nby their peers, to dislike school, and to have lower grades\n[7, 29, 33]. These findings clearly show that victimization\nof school bullying is serious problem that requires changes\nto school environments in order to improve safety among\nstudents.\n1.2. Predictors of School Bullying Victimization. Although\nany student can be a victim of school bullying, there are\nconsistent characteristics of victims. Several empirical studies\nhave found that individual demographic characteristics (e.g.,\ngender, age, and race) are significantly related to school\nand colleagues [18] and Rodkin and Berger [36] found that\ngirls are more likely than boys to be victimized at school\nand to identify themselves as victims. Age and grade level\nhave also been found to be significant predictors of being\nshows that risk of being bullied decreases with age. DeVoe\net al. [17] also found that 14 percent of 6th graders in the\nsample reported being victimized, while only 2 percent of 12th\ngraders were victims of school bullying. Similarly, Olweus\n[13] found that elementary and middle school students were\nmore vulnerable to victimization than high school students.\nRegarding the relationship between race and school bullying\nvictimization, the findings are mixed. A study by Seals and\nYoung [37] indicates no significant difference between whites\nand racial minorities, while Mouttapa et al. [38] found that\nAsian youths were more likely than other racial groups being\nvictimized at school. Other studies [39\u00ad41] found that stu-\ndents with mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression,\nunhappiness, aggression, and emotional difficulties) appear\nto be more vulnerable to school bullying victimization than\nstudents without mental health problems.\nPrior empirical studies also indicate that negative interac-\ntions with parents and a home environment where domestic\nviolence is present are significantly related to school victim-\nization. Youths who have been rejected by parents and/or\nexposed to a harsh home environment, such as hostility\nand violence among family members, are more likely to be\nvictims of school bullying [42\u00ad45]. In addition to individual-\nrelated characteristics, lifestyle and opportunity influence\nbullying victimization. Adolescents who are more exposed to\nopportunities to engage in risky behavior (e.g., skipping class\nor getting involved in a fight) have a higher probability for\nvictimization than others.\nOther studies [46\u00ad49] found that school characteris-\ntics and climate (i.e., school conduct/discipline, teachers'\nattitudes, teachers' support, rule clarity/enforcement, and\nstudents' respect) are significant predictors of school vic-\ntimization. In contrast, adolescents attending schools where\nteachers paid attention to bullying and intervened in or\nstopped bullying problems were less likely to be victimized\nAlso, research shows a significant relationship between\nschool safety/adult supervision and bullying victimization\nat school [49\u00ad51]. These studies found that students were\n  3\nless likely to be victimized when schools increased staff\nsupervision of student activities in hallways and in the\ncafeteria. Additionally, students attending schools in which\nteachers were aware of school policies on bullying and in\nwhich school professionals handled victimization problems\nadequately tended to be victimized less often [50]. In contrast,\nlower levels of involvement by teachers in the establishment\nand enforcement of policies on aggressive student behavior\nwere associated with higher rates of bullying and victimiza-\nGottfredson and his colleagues [53] reported on a mul-\ntilevel study of the effects of the school climate on students'\nvictimization using a large national sample of secondary\nschools from the National Study of Delinquency Prevention\nin Schools. The researchers predicted that better discipline\nmanagement (i.e., perceptions of the fairness of school\nrules/rule enforcement and perceptions of the clarity of rules)\nis related to lower levels of student victimization. Results\nfrom another study on the effects of school level security and\nrelated issues on the degree of school bullying victimization\nhave been mixed. Schreck et al. [8] found no evidence\nthat school guardianship, such as school guards/hallway\nsupervision, metal detectors, and visitor sign-in protocols,\naffected overall rates of students' victimization in school\nonce individual and school characteristics were controlled.\nHowever, they found that students at schools with locker\nchecks and corporal punishment policies experienced less\nvictimization.\n1.3. Theory of School Climate and School Bullying Victimiza-\ntion. A few studies have focused on the role that the school\nclimate, including school characteristics, plays in bullying\nvictimization; most studies, however, overlook the ecological\ndimension of school bullying and victimization although\nframing school violence within this model is perhaps the\nmost cogent approach. Bronfenbrenner [54], in discussing a\nmore holistic perspective to human growth and development,\nproposed an ecological model governed by the reciprocal\nrelationship an individual has with his/her environment.\nExtrapolating from his theory, a few researchers have pro-\nposed mechanisms of bullying victimization by employing\nan ecological model whereby adolescent development is\ninfluenced by both their proximal environment and other\nenvironmental contexts including fluid interactions with\nparents, peers, teachers, and the school climate [55, 56].\nBullying victimization can thus be best understood within\nthis framework.\nThe central features of ecological perspectives are four\ndifferent ecological levels of interaction: (i) microsystem;\n(ii) mesosystem; (iii) exosystem; and (iv) macrosystem [54].\nThe microsystem involves interactions with the individ-\nual's immediate or proximal environment. The microsystem\nincludes patterns of activities, roles, and interpersonal rela-\ntionships. Families are generally the first microsystem within\nwhich adolescents function [54]. For instance, parents may\nhave the closest and the greatest influence on an adolescents'\nbehavior. The second ecological system is the mesosystem,\nwhich refers to interrelations of two or more elements within\nthe microsystem. Harmonious relationships between parent\nand peers or parents and school may influence an adolescent's\nbehavior. Thirdly, the exosystem is defined as a \"system that\nis not in direct interaction with the developing person but\nhas indirect effects on the person\" [54, p. 26]. For instance,\nparents in poor neighborhoods may face greater obstacles\nin taking proper care of their children. If there is a lack of\nresources in such neighborhoods, the relationship between\nlack of parental support and lack of community resources\nmay not directly affect an adolescent's behavior, but indirectly\naffect it. The last system is identified as the macrosystem,\nwhich includes influences by one's culture, norms, and laws\nof society [54], In sum, the theory of ecology of human\ndevelopment has not produced one uniform set of explana-\ntions for interaction between individuals and environment.\nRather, it provides many possible explanations, such as\nvarious interactions between parent, peer, school, and/or\ncommunity factors from all of these ecological sources. It\ndoes, however, provide the best theoretical framework for\nstudies on bullying victimization because it describes fluid\nand reciprocal interactions between peers, some of which\nnegatively impact those in asymmetrical power relationships\non campus.\n1.4. Research Questions and Hypotheses. In sum, we believe\nthat further research is necessary to better understand the\netiology of bullying victimization, especially focusing on\nthe effects of school prevention/intervention strategies and\nschool environments on victimization. We first examine\nwhether school safety equipment and strategies are signif-\nicantly related to various types of bullying victimization.\nBased on the extant literature, it is expected that security\nguards and security equipment have significant effects on var-\nious types of bullying victimization. Second, we expect that\nschool environments (e.g., awareness/fairness of school rules\nand punishment and presence of gangs and guns at school)\nare significant predictors of each type of victimization. Third,\nwe examine whether individual demographic characteristics\nand deviant behaviors are significantly related to bullying\nvictimization.\n2.1. Sample and Procedure. Self-reported data on bullying\nvictimization were collected from 22,686 adolescents in the\nNational Crime Victimization Survey in the United States.\nSCS uses a rotating panel design of randomly selected house-\nholds and is a collaborative cross-national study examining\nschool-related victimization among school-aged adolescents\nto provide specific information for policymakers and prac-\ntitioners. In particular, SCS is designed to examine several\ndirect and indirect characteristics of bullying victimization\nand bullying victims. In addition, the SCS component asks\nrespondents about school life, participation in extracurric-\nular activities, access to drugs, weapon carrying, and other\nschool-related issues. To obtain a nationally representative\nsample, data were collected from school-aged adolescents\n(between 12 and 18 years old) who were in middle school\n4  \nand high school. Since the purpose of the current study is to\nunderstand school safety measures related to victimization at\nschool, the analysis is restricted to those who were enrolled in\nprivate or public education programs during the six months\nprior to the interview. Therefore, a total of 12,987 students\n2.2. Dependent Variable. Even though bullying is considered\nan aggressive behavior [57], bullying includes more subtle\npatterns of violence such as taunting, teasing, name calling,\nand spreading rumors [13]. In line with this assumption\nregarding more subtle forms of bullying, a review of prior\nresearch suggested key differences between students whose\nbullying victimization involved physical or emotional/verbal\nabuse versus students who did not experience any victim-\nization. For the purpose of the present study, therefore,\nbullying victimization was defined by the most widely used\ncriteria [13]: (0) no victimization; (1) physical victimiza-\ntion; (2) emotional victimization; and (3) both types of\nvictimization. Physical victimization is defined by four items:\n\"During this school year, has any student bullied you, such as\nthreatened you; pushed/shoved/tripped; you done anything\nto you against your will; and destroyed your property.\" The\ndefinition of emotional victimization also comprises four\nitems: \"During this school year, has any student bullied\nyou, such as made fun of you or called you names; spread\nrumors; excluded you\" and \"has anyone called you an\ninsulting or bad name at school having to do with your race,\nreligion, ethnicity, disability, gender, and sexual orientation.\"\nResponses for each victimization item were recorded into a\ncategorical variable which was coded 0 if the respondent had\nnot experienced any such victimization incidents at school,\ncoded 1 if the respondent had experienced at least one of\nthese physical victimization incidents at school, coded 2 if the\nrespondent had experienced at least one of the emotional vic-\ntimization incidents at school, and coded 3 if the respondent\nhad experienced both physical and emotional victimization\nincidents at school. The dependent variable used in our\nanalysis differs from that in some prior studies in that it\nadds both physical and emotional victimization as a separate\ncategory along with traditional categories including physical\nand emotional victimization. This particular process allows\nboth physical and emotional victimization category to be\ncompared to a reference category (i.e., none) simultaneously.\n2.3. School Characteristics. The SCS records contained mea-\nsures of several characteristics commonly expected to differ-\nentiate types of victimizations (see Table 1). Two groups of\nschool security measures were supposedly related to school\nbullying victimization. The measured variable school security\nguards included whether a respondent's school had security\nguards or staff/adults in the hallways. We also employed\nthe school safety equipment measure that asked whether a\nrespondent's school had a metal detector, locked doors, or\nsecurity cameras. Among these three items, locked doors\nand security cameras were selected as proxy variables for\nschool safety equipment. The school safety measures had a\ndichotomous (1 = yes/0 = no) response.\nIn addition to school safety measures, we employed\nschool climate measures including fairness of school rules,\nawareness of school rules, and awareness of school punishment.\nThree items were combined to measure fairness of school\nrules: \"School rules are fair\"; \"Same punishment for breaking\nrules\"; and \"School rules strictly enforced\" (see Table 1).\nIt is expected that students who believe that school rules\nare fairly and strictly administrated will be less likely to\nhave bullying victimization than other students who distrust\nschool's discipline management [53]. For further analysis, the\naverage scores were calculated based on these three items\nso that the higher scores indicate that students think school\nrules/punishments are trustworthy and fair. The reliability\ncoefficient (Cronbach's ) for fairness of school rules was 0.67.\nThe variable awareness of school rules asked whether \"every-\none knows school rules,\" and awareness of punishments asked\nwhether \"students know the punishment.\" Each item had\na four-point Likert-scale response ranging from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 4 (strongly agree).\nPrevious research on bullying victimization found that\nschool-related variables, such as students misbehaving, gangs\nat school, guns at school, types of school, and school location,\nwere associated with bullying victimization [17]. In particular,\nit is hypothesized that such school environment including\nstudents misbehaving, gangs or guns at school are positively\nrelated to each type of victimization. To examine the effects\nof school-related characteristics on victimization, we used\nthree variables: students misbehaving, gangs at school, and\nguns at school. A single item is used to measure fellow stu-\ndents' misbehavior at school: \"How often are you distracted\nfrom doing your schoolwork by students misbehaving.\" The\nresponse options for the item ranged from 1 = never, 2 =\nAlmost never, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = most of the time. Gangs\nat school (\"Are there any gangs at your school?\") and guns\nat school (\"Do you know any students who have brought a\ngun to your school during this school year?\") were coded\ninto a binary variable (1 = yes/0 = no). In addition, since\npublic schools and schools located in urban areas may have\na higher percentage of bullying victimization compared with\ntheir counterparts (i.e., private schools and rural areas) [21],\ntypes of school (1 = private and 0 = public) and school location\n(1 = urban and 0 = rural) were also included in the model in\norder to control the potential intervening effects of type of\nschool and school location on bullying victimization.\n2.4. Individual Characteristics. Because prior research indi-\ncates that some social-demographic individual characteristics\nare significant predictors of bullying victimization, we exam-\nine whether age, gender, household income, race/ethnicity,\ndeviant behaviors, academic performance, and extracurricu-\nlar activities are significantly related to bullying victimization.\nAge is an interval level variable, ranging from 12 to 18\nyears old. Sex is a dichotomous variable, coding male as 1\nand female as 0. Race is also a dichotomous variable with\nnonwhite as 1 and white as 0. Ethnicity is a dummy variable,\ncoding Hispanic as 1 and non-Hispanic as 0.\nAdditional measures of individual characteristics were\nskipping class and fighting in the last 6 months; all were\n  5\nTable 1: Survey items for measuring school and individual characteristics.\nVariables Survey item(s) Range Cronbach's \nSecurity guards (1) Whether security guards or staff/adults are present in school? 0-1a\nSecurity equipment I (1) Whether school has locked door? 0-1a\nSecurity equipment II (1) Whether school has security cameras? 0-1a\nFairness of school rules\n(1) School rules are fair, (2) same punishment for breaking rules, and\n(3) school rules strictly enforced\nAwareness of school rules (1) Everyone knows school rules 1\u00ad4b\nAwareness of punishments (1) Students know punishments 1\u00ad4b\nGangs at school (1) Are there any gangs at your school? 0-1a\nGuns at school (1) Have you known or seen anyone who brought a gun to school? 0-1a\nStudents misbehaving (1) How often are you distracted by students misbehaving? 1\u00ad4c\nTeachers' punishment (1) How often do teachers punish students? 1\u00ad4c\nType of school 0: public, 1: private school 0-1\nSkipping class (1) Have you skipped classes? 0-1a\nFighting last 6 months (1) Have you been in a fight during the last 6 months? 0-1a\nTeacher-student\nrelationship\n(1) Teachers treat students with respect\n(2) Teachers care about students\nExtracurricular activities\n(1) During the last school year, have you participated in any of the following extracurricular activities sponsored by your\nschool such as athletics, spirit groups, arts, academics, school governments, service clubs, or other school activities?\nAge Respondent age at the time of survey 12\u00ad18\nEthnicity 0: non-hispanic, 1: hispanic 0-1\na0: no, 1: yes; b1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: agree, and 4: strongly agree; c1: never, 2: almost never, 3: sometimes, and 4: most of the time.\n6  \ndichotomous variables coded 1 for yes and 0 for no. A\nsingle item, \"During this school year, across all subjects have\nyou gotten mostly?,\" was used to measure students' school\nperformance, and the response options were 1 = F; 2 = D;\n3 = C; 4 = B; and 5 = A. The SCS also measured students'\nparticipation in extracurricular activities consisting of items\nasking, \"Have you participated in athletic teams, spirit groups\n(e.g., cheerleading or pep club), performing arts, academic\nclubs, or student government?,\" which we coded as Extra-\nCurricular Activities (1 = yes/0 = no). (In order to check\nfor any possible multicollinearity (MC) problems among\nindependent and control variables, the variance inflation\nfactor (VIF) and tolerance statistics were calculated. Results\nconfirmed that there was no severe MC problem among those\nstudy simultaneously included all available school safety and\nsocioeconomic variables as well as control variables in the\nregression models).\n2.5. Analytic Strategy. Since the primary dependent variable\nwas a nominal variable with four discrete categories (i.e.,\nconsisting of unordered categories of no bullying, physical\nbullying, verbal bullying, and both physical and verbal bul-\nlying victimization), a multinomial logistic model (MNLM)\nwas used to estimate the effects of school safety variables on\nschool bullying victimizations. The MNLM is preferable to\nbinary logistic regression analysis because it takes account\nof the unordered nature of the dependent variable and\nprovides more efficient estimations by producing multiple\nlogits simultaneously [58].\nMissing values (data) are important because the improper\nhandling of missing values will produce biased coefficients\n[59]. Thus, a missing data analysis was also conducted to\nensure the quality of the analysis. The preliminary results\nconfirmed that the missing observations of most of the\nvariables in this study's data occur completely at random.\nHowever, some independent variables were found to be\nsignificantly different between complete and incomplete data\n(e.g., school guard). To correct this problem, we estimated the\nmultinomial logistic regressions using the sampling weight\noption (pweights) in STATA [60]. In particular, we employed\nan inverse probability weight (IPW) procedure so that all\nobservations from the complete data were given more weight\nthan others when computing estimates. An IPW procedure\nconsists of two practical steps. First, a logistic regression\nanalysis was conducted to estimate a subject's probability\nof being fully observed (Prob [ = [1, 1, 1, . . . , 1] | 0\n]).\nThen, the inverse of these probabilities were calculated and\nused to re-weight contributions to generalized estimating\nequations in a completer-only analysis (i.e., MNLM with\npweights). Finally, STATA yields robust standard errors that\nautomatically adjust potential misspecifications bias since\nprobabilities are only estimated in the main model [61].\n3. Findings\nTable 2 illustrates the descriptive statistics for the dependent\nand independent variables used in this analysis. Of 12,987\nstudents, approximately 33 percent of students reported\nexperiencing some form of bullying in the previous school\nyear. Among those bullied students, slightly more than\nhalf had been emotionally bullied (52 percent), and about\n39 percent had experienced both physical and emotional\nbullying, followed by physical bullying (nine percent). This\nrelatively low level of bullying victimization was found to be\nin several large-scale studies [1]. One recent study found that\nhigh and high school students) reported moderate to frequent\ninvolvement in bullying including the bully, the victim, or the\nbully-victim [7].\nIn terms of school safety measures, most schools had\nsecurity guards (and/or assigned police officers), school staff\nmembers, or other adults supervising the hallways and class-\nrooms (70 percent). Most schools had security equipment,\nsuch as locked entrance or exit doors (61 percent) or security\ncameras (70 percent), to monitor and secure the school\nduring the day.\nMost students also reported that school rules were fair\nand that they were aware of school rules and punishments.\nSome students reported gangs at school and that they knew\nof students who had brought a gun to their school (27\npercent and five percent, resp.). With regard to demographic\ncharacteristics of students, few students had skipped a class\n(seven percent) or gotten into a fight (six percent) in the\nprevious six months. Most of the students indicated that they\nhad been participating in extracurricular activities such as\nathletics, spirit groups, and arts during the previous school\nyear (67 percent). Finally, the average age of the students was\nabout 15 years old, with a standard deviation of 1.90, and\nabout half of the students were male (51 percent). Roughly\n20 percent identified themselves as nonwhite and Hispanic\nor Latino.\nTable 3 presents results from a multinomial logistic\nregression with inverse probability weighted estimation. (We\nalso estimated multinomial logistic regressions without IPW\nestimation. Although the magnitudes of coefficients were\nslightly changed, the significant results were remaining con-\nsistent throughout the models. Finally, it should be noted\nthat the number of observations after listwise deletion of\nincomplete cases for both regression models are 6,988 and\n6,891, resp.). The results indicated that the variables of\nsecurity guards, fairness and awareness of school rules, gangs\nand guns at school, students misbehaving, and teachers'\npunishment were found to be statistically significant pre-\ndictors of overall bullying victimization. More specifically,\nstudents attending schools where security guards (and/or\npolice officers) were present in the hallways were less likely to\nreport being victims of physical bullying, emotional bullying,\nand both physical and emotional bullying (exp (b) = 0.68,\nsignificant effect on each type of bullying victimization\nexcept one model. That is, students who attend schools with\nlocked doors were more likely to report physical bullying\nvictimization (exp (b) = 1.49). If the level of fairness of\nschool rules were to increase by one unit, the relative risk\nof experiencing emotional or both physical and emotional\nbullying (versus none) would be expected to decrease by\n  7\nVariables  % Mean SD Min Max\nMissing\n %\nSchool characteristics\nIndividual/demographic characteristics\nNote: cumulative frequency may not be equal to the sample size ( = 12,987) due to missing values.\n%: valid percent.\nfactors of 0.91 and 0.86, respectively, given the other variables\nin the model are held constant. Similarly, students' perception\nof their awareness of school rules and punishments were\nalso negatively related to physical bullying victimization\nand emotional bullying victimization, respectively. That is,\nstudents who reported a higher level of awareness of school\nrules were less likely to report victimization for physical\nbullying (exp (b) = 0.73). Similarly, students who knew\npunishments also were less likely to be emotionally bullied\nthan their counterparts (exp (b) = 0.87).\nIn addition, the presence of gangs in respondents' schools\nincreased the relative risk of bullying victimization, par-\nticularly for emotional or both physical and emotional\nforms. However, after controlling for students' individual\ncharacteristics, the presence of gangs in the schools became\na nonsignificant predictor for physical bullying. The same\npatterns were found with respect to the presence of guns\nin the schools. In other words, students who knew of other\nstudents who had brought a gun to the school or saw\nanother student with a gun at school were more likely to be\nvictimized by emotional and both physical and emotional\nwere frequently distracted from doing their school work\nbecause other students were misbehaving (e.g., talking) were\nmore likely to report victimization for all forms of bullying.\nStudents who thought their teachers spent too much time\npunishing students had a greater risk of being victims of\nemotional and both physical and emotional bullyings (exp\n(b) = 1.13 and 1.38). Finally, security equipment (i.e., security\ncameras), type of school (public versus private), and school\nlocation (urban versus rural) were not statistically significant\npredictors of bullying victimization.\nWith regard to individual and demographic character-\nistics, students who skipped classes were more likely to be\n8  \nTable 3: The results from multinomial logistic regression models with inverse probability weighted estimation.\nVariables\nb SE b SE b SE b SE b SE b SE\nSchool characteristics\nIndividual/demographic\nP < .01, P < .05, SE: robust standard error, b: relative risk ratio, and : number of observations after listwise deletion of incomplete cases.\n1None is the reference category.\nemotionally bullied, and students who were in one or more\nphysical fights at school in the previous six months were at\ngreater risk of being victims of all forms of bullying (e.g., exp\n(b) for physical bullying = 7.06). Students who participated\nin any type of extracurricular activities were more likely to\nreport being victims of emotional and both physical and\nemotional bullyings. Students who maintained a higher GPA\nwere less likely to be victims of both physical and emotional\nbullying (exp (b) = 0.86). Nonwhite and Hispanic students\nwere less likely than whites and non-Hispanics to report being\nvictims of both physical and emotional bullyings (exp (b) =\n0.68 and 0.58, resp.). Interestingly, while male students had a\ngreater risk of being physically bullied than females, males\nwere less likely than females to report emotional bullying.\nFinally, students who participated in the 2007 survey were\nmore likely to have experienced both physical and emotional\n4. Discussion\nMany researchers have examined the effects of individual-\nlevel (or microlevel) characteristics on victimization of school\nbullying. And, only a few researchers have examined the\neffects of school safety equipment/strategies on victimiza-\ntion. However, existing research has usually tested for vic-\ntimization based on non-nationally representative samples.\nFurthermore, the majority of prior victimization studies paid\nlesser attention to the etiology of different types of bullying\n  9\nvictimization. The current study, using a national representa-\ntive sample of youths in the United States, addresses several\nlimitations of prior research on school bullying victimization.\nThe study provides a test of variables that examine bullying\nvictimization, especially focusing on individual/demographic\nand school environmental factors and school antibullying\nmeasures. Next, we summarize the key findings of the current\nstudy and implications for future research.\nOverall, the current findings show that several individual\ncharacteristics (i.e., school performance, race, ethnicity, and\ngender) are significantly related to physical, emotional, or\ngeneral (i.e., both emotional and physical) bullying vic-\ntimization. Consistent with prior studies [62, 63], there is\na negative association between academic achievement and\nvictimization, in that academically competent respondents\nare less likely to report being victims of general school\nbullying. Also, the results show that boys are more likely to\nbe bullied physically, while girls are more likely to report\nemotional bullying. These findings may suggest that boys are\nparticularly susceptible to intimidation if they appear out-\nwardly weak, while girls are more likely than boys to engage\nin relational bullying, to use rumors or misinformation, and\nto deny (or shun) targets [64]. Interestingly, the findings\nindicate that non-white adolescents are less likely than their\nwhite peers to report general school bullying, consistent with\nseveral prior findings that minority youth were less likely to\nbe victimized than white youth [7, 30]. However, there is\nsome disagreement in the literature about racial differences\nin victimization. For example, Hanish and Guerra [65] found\nthat white adolescents were the highest ethnic group at risk\nfor victimization among different racial and ethnic groups.\nFindings from Seals and Young [37], on the contrary, found\nthat there is no clear-cut evidence regarding the role of race\nand ethnicity on peer victimization. That being said, the\nrelationship between race and ethnicity and vulnerability to\nbullying is still unclear and seems to vary. Because of the\nmixed findings regarding race and ethnicity, there is a need\nfor further research to better understand the crucial role of\nrace and ethnicity on peer victimization.\nAs expected, the findings indicate that students' delin-\nquent behaviors are significantly related to school bullying\nvictimization. The results show that those respondents who\nreported starting and/or being involved in physical fights\nat school in the previous six months have a greater risk of\nbeing a victim of physical and emotional bullying. Thus, it\nis highly possible that adolescents who behave aggressively\ntoward others are indeed more likely to engage in interper-\nsonal conflicts and then become a target of retaliation by\npeers, as suggested by Perry et al. [66]. In addition, this is\nconsistent with previous findings that individuals engaged\nin risky or deviant behaviors, or whose lifestyle has exposed\nthem to risky environments, are more likely to experience\nvictimization [67\u00ad69].Unexpectedly, the results indicate that\nstudents who participate in various extracurricular activities\nare more likely to be subjects of emotional and general\nbullying. This finding contrasts with a prior study that found\nthat extracurricular activities had a preventive effect on\nschool violence [70]. Although further research is necessary\nto better understand the relationship between extracurricular\nactivities and school bullying victimization, we can speculate\nthat students who engage in extracurricular activities may\nhave more opportunities to interact with bullies without staff\nsupervision, especially if these activities are after school.\nVarious school environmental factors have significant\neffects on bullying victimization on school grounds. The\npresence, in school, of gangs and guns and teachers' frequent\nuse of punishment have salient effects on both physical and\nemotional school bullyings victimization in the expected\ndirections. We also found the prevalence of other students'\ndistracting behaviors to be important in predicting both\nphysical and emotional bullyings victimization. Conversely,\nstudents' perceptions of the fairness of school rules is nega-\ntively related to school bullying victimization, in that students\nwho perceive greater fairness in school rules are less likely\nto be victimized physically and emotionally. These findings\nclearly indicate the importance of reducing students' expo-\nsure to adverse school environmental factors and improving\nschool fairness in discipline and rules in order to reduce\nschool bullying victimization.\nOur analyses of school safety measures show that stu-\ndents attending schools where security guards (and/or police\nofficers) are present in the hallways are less likely to be\nbullied. Students may feel safe in their school, and bullies\nmay have limited opportunities to bully other students when\nschools employ security personnel [71]. Interestingly, the\nfindings show that security equipment (i.e., locked doors) is\nnot significantly related to school bullying victimization, even\nthough the installation of security equipment in schools has\nbecome a popular preventive/deterrent measure. This finding\nis consistent with previous findings [72, 73] that school-\nbased security equipment measures do not fundamentally\naddress school bullying and victimization. It may be pos-\nsible that locked doors create a heavily scrutinized, prison-\nlike feeling and that intrusive searches foster unwelcoming\nschool environments [74]. Consequently, students may feel\noppressed, which in turn may lead them to engage in school\ncameras, the results from multinomial logistic regression\nanalyses also yield unexpected results. Inconsistent with our\nexpectation, security cameras (a proxy measure for security\nequipment) were found to be positively associated with\nphysical bullying. That is, students at schools with security\ncameras tend to experience slightly more physical bullying\nvictimization. It seems impossible to argue that the security\ncameras are a cause of physical bullying victimization. A\nfeasible explanation for this particular finding is that schools\ninstalled security cameras because of increasing number of\nphysical bullying victimization among students.\nNotably, it is concluded that other school-related charac-\nteristics (i.e., gangs at school, guns at school, and teachers'\npunishment) are not effective in reducing physical victimiza-\ntion nor effective in reducing risk of emotional victimization.\nThis result is perhaps not surprising. Students may not be\ninvolved in any type of inappropriate behaviors, if they are\naware of the likelihood of being caught because of high\nsecurity strategies and aware of the potential consequences\nbecause of school rules. This is true despite enrollment in\nschools characterized by poor security measures.\n10  \nAnother explanation can be offered. According to Ma\n[76], a school climate characterized by students' disruptive\nbehaviors may encourage bullies. Similarly, Nansel et al. [7]\nfound that bullies reported a significantly poor perception\nof school climate. Bullies can incorporate and employ new\ntechniques to bully other students. For example, bullies avoid\nphysical interaction, which may result in physical signs (e.g.,\ndamaged property, physical signs or bruises, etc.), rather than\nverbally abuse or ignore the other students completely to\navoid being caught by school officials (REVIEWER 1 \u00ad no. 2).\n5. Future Directions and Implications\nGiven our findings, an interesting question remains to be\naddressed: how can school safety strategies maximize effec-\ntive outcomes that reduce the risk of being bullied? The\nanswer to this question undoubtedly involves future research\nto test the efficacy of intervention strategies. First, research\nshould closely examine the specific characteristics of school\nsafety measures. As prior research has shown, perceptions\nof school safety conditions, such as gated/locked school\nentrances, visitor sign-in protocols, metal detectors, and\nsecurity cameras have direct and indirect relationships with\nschool violence [71]. By including these perceptions of the\nquality of school safety conditions, we can gain a better sense\nof the effect of safety strategies and their ability to prevent\nbullying victimization.\nSecond, school bullying interventions should also focus\non the interplay between factors such as students' family,\nschool, and community characteristics and students' procliv-\nity to bully others at school. From the victim's perspective,\nit is important to understand how these factors interact\nwith bullying and how these factors can be taken into\naccount in order to develop better intervention programs\nthat help to create safer school environments. Thus, it is\nbecoming increasingly clear that a more holistic approach\nthat moves beyond the geographical boundaries of a school\nmay be needed to prevent school bullying. In addition,\nresearch should investigate the characteristics of bullying\nand of victimized children that are associated with students'\nexperience of bullying victimization. Understanding these\nfactors will lead to a more thorough evaluation of school\nviolence and, subsequently, better prevention programs.\nOverall, the results of the current study point to the\ncritical role that school security guards/resource officers and\nthe school climate/environment play in students' risk of\nbecoming victims of school bullying. The results also show\nthat individual background characteristics influence the risk\nof victimization. However, the main goal of the current study,\nnamely, the effect of school security equipment on victimiza-\ntion, has not been realized. Nonetheless, our findings have\nobvious implications for preventing victimization in schools.\nFirst, the findings of the current study imply that gender\nis an important predictor of bullying victimization. Indeed,\nfemale students may be more vulnerable to emotional/verbal\nthreats because of negative peer evaluation and loss of peer\nrelationships, while males are more likely to be hurtful\nbecause of their attitude toward social dominance [77].\nTherefore, interventions may work best when combined with\ngender-specific programs. In particular, school prevention\nstrategies should focus on enhancing pleasant social experi-\nences within the school, encouraging relational ties among\nfemale students. For male students, prevention efforts should\nfocus more on fostering adaptive cognitions for aggressive\nand disruptive behavior.\nAs school bullying has received a significant amount of\nattention, several models and approaches of bullying pre-\nvention programs have emerged. According to Espelage and\nSwearer [50], there are over 300 school-based antibullying\nprograms. Although all of the models vary by background,\nprocedures, type of curriculum, and participants, each model\nshares common goals to achieve outcomes such as identifying\nthe bully and victim, helping to cope with negative conse-\nquences of bullying, providing support and protection for\nvictims, and reducing school bullying [50, 78, 79]. However,\nmany evaluations studies have reported mixed and incon-\nsistent results across samples and measures [80, 81]. The\nmixed results suggest that there is no single best approach\nto school bullying prevention. Based on our findings, many\nschool-related characteristics were associated with emotional\nvictimization across the United States. Although emotional\nbullying has detrimental effects on victims, relatively little\nattention has been given to this type of bullying [82]. In\nenhancing existing school bullying prevention program, both\neducators and stakeholders must be aware of less obvious acts\nof bullying victimization, such as emotional bullying.\nThe findings of the current study also imply that an\nunsupportive school climate clearly contributes to bullying\nvictimization. The school-wide physical and social environ-\nments can serve as protective factors that contribute to a\nsafe and healthy school. Thus, it is necessary to create a\nschool climate that it proactive in inhibiting bullying and\nis transparent in its intolerance of bullying. In particular,\nit is important for schools to address students' distracting\nbehaviors and the presence of gangs at school. According\nto Fox and Burstein [83], gangs and gang activity on school\ngrounds increase violence because gangs are willing to terror-\nize an entire school, create fear among students, and disrupt\nthe school climate. Strategies should focus on generating\nschool resources that are likely to discourage students from\njoining gangs and engaging in violence, in order to decrease\nthe level of violence in school. Overall, no matter how\ndiligent and responsible security strategies are in preventing\nschool bullying, there can be no absolute guarantees that\nbullying will not occur. However, if school staff/officials,\nparents, and the community seek interagency coordination\nand collaboration to better facilitate informal social control,\nthese may prove to be decisive factors that can prevent school\nbullying and successfully suppress gang activities.\nReferences\n[1] J.
