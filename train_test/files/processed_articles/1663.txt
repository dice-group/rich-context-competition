The\nnumber of methadone pain pills distributed now exceeds liq-\nuid methadone used in opioid treatment, and the increases\nin buprenorphine indicators provide evidence of the need to\nmonitor and intervene to decrease the abuse of this drug.\nThe need for additional and improved data to track trends\nis discussed, along with findings as to the characteristics of\nthe users and combinations of drugs. Data on toxicities re-\nlated to methadone or buprenorphine, particularly in combi-\nnation with other prescribed drugs, are presented and clinical\nimplications and considerations are offered. These findings\nunderscore the need for physicians to be aware of potential\ntoxicities and to educate their patients regarding these issues.\nINTRODUCTION\nAbuse of prescription opioids, pain medications, is a\ngrowing problem.1\u00ad3 The number of Drug Abuse Warning\nNetwork (DAWN) emergency department visits for opi-\nand the increase is seen in both those opiate drugs that\nhave been on the market for many years and in the newer\ndrugs. DAWN emergency department cases with a mention\nof hydrocodone singly or in combinations increased from\npaper uses publicly available data to examine trends in the\nuse of methadone and buprenorphine in the United States,\nthe characteristics of the users, the formulations of the sub-\nstances, and their use in combination with other drugs.\nAddress correspondence to Dr. Maxwell, Addiction Research\nInstitute, The University of Texas at Austin, 1717 West 6th Street,\nUnderstanding the reasons underlying increases in the\nuse of opioid medications can be complicated. There has\nbeen little research on the factors involved in these ad-\nverse events, such as the formulation of the opioid drug\n(liquid, single ingredient or in combination), case type (sui-\ncide, adverse reaction, etc.), underlying physical and mental\ncondition of the affected individual, combinations of drugs\ninvolved (including serum levels and toxicology reports),\ndosing instructions given to the patient, source of the drug,\nreasons for use, and ease of access to nonprescribed phar-\nmaceutical drugs through illegal methods. Many of the new\ndrugs fall into International Classification of Diseases-10\n(ICD-10)5 categories such as \"Other Synthetic Narcotics,\"\n\"Other Opioids,\" and \"Other and Unspecified Narcotics,\"\nwhich currently do not provide data on a specific drug.\nThus, for this paper, a number of different data sources\nhave been accessed to try to understand this growing trend.\nBuprenorphine was first marketed in the United States\nit was only available as a low-dose (0.3 mg/ml) injectable\nformulation under the brand name Buprenex\u00ae. In October\n2002, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved\ntwo buprenorphine products (Suboxone\u00ae and Subutex\u00ae)\nfor the treatment of narcotic addiction. Both products are\nhigh dose (2 mg and 8 mg) sublingual tablets. Subutex\u00ae is\na single entity buprenorphine product and Suboxone\u00ae is a\ncombination product with buprenorphine and naloxone in\na 4:1 ratio, respectively. Buprenorphine has been classified\nas a Schedule III drug.\nMethadone, a pharmaceutical opioid used in the treat-\nment of opioid dependence since 1964, is currently mar-\nketed as oral concentrate (10 mg/ml), oral solution (5\nprescription compounding). As of January 1, 2008, the\n40 mg dispersible tablets (diskettes) are no longer approved\nby the FDA for use in the management of pain. Methadone\nis a Schedule II drug.\nMETHODOLOGY\nData from surveys, prescriptions, poison control centers,\nemergency room visits, treatment admissions, deaths, retail\nshipments, and toxicology laboratory data were retrieved\nfrom online sources, special data runs by the agencies col-\nlecting the data, and from agency publications. Very few of\nthe datasets could report whether or not the affected in-\ndividuals had taken drugs prescribed for them. Texas data\nwere provided by the Department of State Health Services\nand analysis was by the author. The U.S. treatment data as\ncollected in the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) was\navailable online and chi-square statistics were calculated\nusing the statistical programs included in the Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Data Archive.6 The DAWN and\nthe Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related\nSurveillance (RADARS\u00ae) were the only datasets available\nfor this paper that reported whether or not the cases in-\nvolved adverse reactions to the medicine prescribed for the\nindividual. In addition, the DAWN tables provided to the\nauthor by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA) included measures of signifi-\ncant changes over time.\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NS-\nDUH) is conducted by the Office of Applied Studies of\nSAMHSA. It collects information on the prevalence, pat-\nterns, and consequences of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal\ndrug use and abuse in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized\nindividuals were sampled in this survey, which is represen-\ntative of the U.S. general population.\nThe number of Americans who used pain relievers non-\nmedically in their lifetimes increased from 29.6 million in\nuals reported lifetime use of methadone in 2002, compared\nfor 26 and older.7\u00ad10 The survey did not query for use of\nbuprenorphine.\nSDI Vector\u00ae reported that the total number of prescrip-\ntions filled at retail outlets for methadone increased from\nwas in prescriptions for the 10 mg tablet, which comprised\nof the Suboxone\u00ae prescriptions and the 8 mg formulation\ncomprised 71% of the Subutex\u00ae prescriptions.11\nThe National Poison Data System of the American As-\nsociation of Poison Control Centers reported the number\nof human exposure calls made about buprenorphine and\nmethadone to all poison control centers across the nation\n(Table 1).\nRADARS\u00ae collects data on acute and chronic exposures\nfrom 47 of 60 U.S. poison centers. Table 2 shows the com-\nbinations of drugs in the calls to RADARS\u00ae in 2008 that\nmentioned human exposure to methadone or buprenor-\nphine12 as well as the combination of calls to Texas poison\ncontrol centers that reported human exposure to these two\ndrugs.

In 2007,\nand 2007, the number of visits involving a mention of\nthe number of visits involving buprenorphine alone or in\nmales, 74% of visits were by Whites, while 9% were by\nBlacks, and 6% were by Hispanics. Some 47% of the\nbuprenorphine visits involved females and 87% of visits\nwere by Whites; the proportions that were Black or His-\npanic were not estimated because of the DAWN suppres-\nsion rules regarding small numbers of cases or Relative\nStandard Errors. For both substances, the highest rates of\nvisits were for those with age of 21\u00ad24 years, but overall,\nFIGURE 1.

Ten percent of the methadone\nvisits were seeking detoxification, 7% had an adverse re-\naction in which the patient took his or her own medica-\ntion as prescribed but had a reaction or side effect, and\n5% involved a suicide attempt.

They were younger, less likely\nto report currently injecting drugs, more likely to be first\nadmissions, were better educated, were more likely to be\nemployed, more likely to enter drug treatment with other\npsychiatric problems, and more likely to have begun their\nopiate use later.\nYet there have been some important shifts in the charac-\nteristics of these populations, with the proportion of male\nclients with a problem with illicit methadone decreasing\nmale heroin clients increasing from 66% to 69%. The pro-\nportion of White illicit methadone clients increased from\n67% to 85%, the proportion of White other opiate clients\nincreased from 85% to 89%, and the proportion of White\nand 2007. Injection as the current route of administration\nhas decreased: the proportions who reported injecting their\nprimary, secondary, or tertiary drug at admission dropped\nfrom 33% to 15% for illicit methadone clients, and from\n32% to 14% for other opiates. All changes were significant\nThe 2007 treatment clients reported very different pat-\nterns in terms of their second problem drugs (Table 5). For\nthose with a primary problem with heroin, cocaine/crack\nwas the second most common drug problem, while for those\nwith a primary problem of nonprescription methadone,\nother opiates were the second problem drugs. Those with\nprimary problems with other opiates were more likely to\nreport no other drug problem or to report problems with\nalcohol, cocaine/crack, or marijuana.18\nSAMHSA's 2007 National Survey of Substance Abuse\nTreatment Services (N-SSATS), an annual census of 14,359\nfacilities providing substance abuse treatment, reported\nthat 23% of all clients in treatment were receiving buprenor-\nphine or methadone, with 3,032 (1%) receiving buprenor-\ndoes not survey those physicians who might be prescrib-\ning buprenorphine for opioid dependence in their private\npractices.\nThe rates for receiving methadone or buprenorphine\ntreatment were higher in the northeast census region and\nlowest in the midwest (Table 6).\n78 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January\u00adFebruary 2010\nTABLE 4.

Since 2000, the distribution of methadone\nFIGURE 6. Distribution of methadone in the United States by\nreflects the increased use of 5 and 10 mg methadone tablets\nfor analgesia (Fig. 6).

ARCOS is the one source that provides\ninformation about the use of buprenorphine as distributed\nto both narcotic treatment programs and private physicians\nprescribing the drug for narcotic treatment or treatment of\npain. Ninety-four percent of the Suboxone\u00ae and Subutex\u00ae\ntablets were distributed through pharmacies; only 1% was\ndistributed to narcotic treatment programs in 2008.\nMore doses of methadone and buprenorphine were sold\nin the northeast census region with the lowest amounts in\nthe midwest (Table 6).\nDISCUSSION\nThis paper has reviewed publicly available data relating\nto use, abuse, misuse, and distribution of methadone and\nbuprenorphine. These individual data sets are constrained\nby significant limitations. Data are neither available on\nbuprenorphine admissions to treatment nor on deaths in-\nvolving the drug. Information is inconsistent on formula-\ntion of the drugs used, sources of the drugs, age groups of\ndrugs were prescribed for the individual, and the frequency\nof combinations of these two drugs with other drugs. Yet,\nwhen these pieces of information are drawn together, a\nclearer picture emerges.\ntablets (5, 10, and 40 mg) sold through retail outlets in-\nhuman exposure calls to poison control centers increased\nand grams of methadone shipped as reported to ARCOS\ncases seen in DAWN emergency rooms increased from\nof deaths in NCHS with a mention of methadone increased\nThe proportional increases in buprenorphine indicators\nare much larger, but this is due to the fact the nonin-\njectable formulation did not come to market until 2002. Be-\nand the number of Subutex\u00ae tablets increased from\nThese increases are indications of the exposures to and di-\nversion of the drug since 70% of the DAWN cases were\nreported to be related to nonmedical use of the drug.\nDepending on the data source, anywhere from 38%\nto 55% of the poison control center and DAWN ED\nmethadone cases involved only methadone, as did 31\u00ad33%\nof the deaths involving methadone. However, these data\nindicate that the majority of these adverse events and\ndeaths involved methadone in combination with other\ndrugs. According to the Texas death data, combinations of\nmethadone involving only illicit drugs are decreasing, while\ncombinations involving prescription opioids (whether pre-\nscribed or not), are increasing.\nThe use of methadone for pain, as compared to treat-\nment for opioid dependence, can be tracked through data\nreporting the formulation of the drug. According to the\nmethadone tablets has now surpassed distribution of the\nliquid used in narcotic treatment programs and Texas poi-\nson control center statistics confirm the increases in calls\n82 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January\u00adFebruary 2010\ninvolving the tablets. Further, RADARS\u00ae data reported\nthat formulation of methadone was unknown for 72% of\ndeaths, but 24% of deaths could be attributed to methadone\ntablets and 3% of deaths were traced to methadone liq-\nuid. These data, when considered with the ARCOS data\nand Texas data, appear to point to the increasing role of\nmethadone tablets used in the treatment of pain as a more\nprevalent source of methadone toxicity than methadone\nfrom narcotic treatment programs where the drug is dosed\nin a liquid form.\nThe data showed the methadone user was more likely to\nbe male (depending on the dataset, between 53% and 67%),\nWhite (74% and 77%), with the highest prevalence of use\namong those of ages 21\u00ad24, according to NSDUH, DAWN,\nand NCHS. However, their use of methadone continued\nover the years with adverse events noted in Texas poison\ncenter calls at an average age of 36, the highest death rates\nin NCHS being 41 years for males and 43 years for females,\nand DAWN ED visits continuing at high levels through\nBuprenorphine numbers are scarcer due to ICD-10 cod-\ning. However, the rapid increases in buprenorphine as doc-\numented in the number of prescriptions written, poison\ncenter exposures, DAWN, NFLIS, and ARCOS provide\nevidence of the need to monitor the potential abuse of this\ndrug. Buprenorphine cases are less likely to occur among\nmales (47\u00ad53% females) and less likely to occur in persons\nof color (87% White in DAWN). The age group seen most\noften in DAWN data was 21\u00ad24 years and the average age\nfor the Texas poison center calls was 35 years.\nBuprenorphine is also a more difficult drug to track,\nsince it can be prescribed for pain, for opioid treatment by\noffice-based practitioners, as well as for use in opioid treat-\nment programs. Thus, there is no reliable way to determine\nthe level of buprenorphine distributed for pain as com-\npared to office-based narcotic treatment, although ARCOS\nreported that only 1% of the buprenorphine tablets were\ndistributed to narcotic treatment programs.\nAs of 2008, there is even less data on Subutex\u00ae in com-\nparison to Suboxone\u00ae. Because of the small numbers of\nSubutex\u00ae cases, DAWN suppression rules limited analysis\nof the data and the numbers of different combinations could\nnot be determined. The data do not tell us if Subutex\u00ae users\ndiffer in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. How-\never, the increases in the number of Subutex\u00ae prescriptions\nshould be recognized. The buprenorphine/naloxone com-\nbination tablet is recommended for use in the treatment of\nopioid addiction,26 with limited use for Subutex\u00ae, which is\nreserved for pregnant, opioid-dependent women. However,\nmethadone is still considered the standard of care for the\ntreatment of these women27 and the limited use for preg-\nnant women seems unlikely to be the source of the large\nincrease in Subutex\u00ae prescriptions. One possibility is that\nphysicians are prescribing this formulation for the treat-\nment of opioid dependence when patients complain that\nthe combination tablet is not well-tolerated. Another possi-\nbility is that physicians prescribe Subutex\u00ae for treatment of\npain (an indication that is not FDA-approved). The greater\nabuse liability for the buprenorphine-alone formulation is\nalso confirmed by the data in this review and underscores\nthe need for physicians to carefully consider appropriate use\nof buprenorphine-alone formulations, given the literature\nAdditional data are needed on reasons for use of these\ntwo drugs. DAWN reported 7% of the methadone cases\nwere adverse reactions to the patient's own drugs and\n16% of the buprenorphine cases also sought help for ad-\nverse reactions. The RADARS\u00ae data reported 16% of the\nmethadone decedents took their own medications and ther-\napeutic error was the exposure reason in 2% of the deaths.\nDetermining the role of drugs taken by the patient as pre-\nscribed, compared to using nonprescribed drugs or drugs\ntaken in a manner not prescribed, is a major concern. The\nfact that the number of overdose deaths of clients in Texas\nnarcotic treatment programs remained stable while the total\nnumber of methadone deaths in the state increased is evi-\ndence that the problem with methadone-associated deaths\nis not related to diversion of methadone from narcotic treat-\nment programs.\nAnalysis of the NFLIS, N-SSATS, and ARCOS data\nfound that availability of the two drugs differed by cen-\nsus region, with more buprenorphine used in treatment,\ndistributed, and found in toxicology examinations in the\nnortheast. More methadone was examined in toxicology\nlaboratories in the south, with more methadone used in\ntreatment and distributed in the northeast. Because these\nthree datasets can be specific as to location (ARCOS and\nN-SSATS are available at the zip code level), tracking \"hot\nspots\" where levels of distribution and seizures are high,\nbut with no opioid treatment programs present to distribute\nmethadone or buprenorphine can be a way to identify areas\nwarranting additional attention by law enforcement and li-\ncensing boards for diversion or inappropriate prescribing.\nMethadone and buprenorphine must also be considered\nin the context of heroin and other opiates. Heroin indi-\ncators including treatment admissions, DAWN ED visits,\nand NCHS death data have remained fairly constant over\ntime while indicators for other opiates have increased. Since\n1992, the gender and racial characteristics of the clients\nhaving problems with illicit methadone have changed so\nthat by 2007, they more closely resembled other opiate\nclients. All treatment clients, whether heroin-addicted, il-\nlicit methadone-addicted, or other opiates-addicted had\nsubstantial rates of psychiatric illness (range: 25\u00ad37%)\n(Table 4).\nIn addition, the secondary-problem drugs are different\nin these groups. Some 31% of the individuals with a prob-\nlem with other opiates reported no second problem, as did\n29% of the heroin clients; but only 23% of those using illicit\nmethadone reported no other drug problem. And there was\nvariation in the secondary-problem drugs reported by those\nwho did have problems (Table 5). Given the demographic\nsimilarities between the illicit methadone and other opiate\nclients, the perceptions among users about illicit methadone\nmight be changing from use that had been primarily to\nprevent withdrawal from heroin to now using methadone\nto prevent withdrawal from other opiates. In brief, these\ndata raise the question of whether methadone is now con-\nsidered as just \"another opiate\" by users. It appears that\ntwo very different groups of opioid users (heroin vs. other\nopiates + nonprescribed methadone) are emerging as treat-\nment seekers. Clinicians need to be aware of the different\ntreatment needs in terms of use with different drug combi-\nnations, mental health treatment needs, and social support\nnetworks or lack thereof.\nAnother issue of significant concern in these data is\nthe high rate of use of other drugs, both licit and il-\nlicit in combination with methadone and buprenorphine.\nDAWN ED cases show significant increases in cases in-\nvolving methadone and other pharmaceuticals as well as\nmethadone in combination with alcohol, other illicit drugs,\nand other pharmaceuticals (Table 3). Similarly, a myr-\niad of other drugs in combination with methadone and\nwith buprenorphine have been reported in data collected\nthrough RADARS\u00ae, NCHS, Texas deaths, DAWN ED,\nand the Texas poison centers (Table 2).\nConsistently, co-occurring use of benzodiazepines, par-\nticularly alprazolam, has been reported in both methadone\nand buprenorphine DAWN ED, poison center, and death\nmentions (Table 2). These findings might be expected, given\nrecent findings from the NSDUH, which show a signif-\nicant increase (p = .05) in misuse of tranquilizers from\nquilizers among lifetime nonmedical users were Valium\u00ae\n(diazepam), Xanax\u00ae\n(alprazolam), Ativan\u00ae\n(lorazepam),\nand Klonopin\u00ae\n(clonazepam), in that order.32 The rate of\nbenzodiazepine use in the population of methadone- and\nbuprenorphine-treated patients is high. Lifetime use of ben-\nzodiazepines in methadone-maintained patients has been\nreported to be as high as 94%.33 In addition, Iguchi and\ncolleagues reported that diazepam, lorazepam, and alpra-\nzolam were frequently used by methadone clients for their\n\"high\" producing effects and for selling to produce income.\nThey also reported that, in contrast, chlordiazepoxide and\noxazepam had much lower ratings of \"high\" and were less\nlikely to be obtained for getting \"high\" or for resale.33 Sim-\nilar findings for buprenorphine with benzodiazepines have\nNot all methadone- and buprenorphine-treated individ-\nuals seek benzodiazepines with the intent to abuse these\ndrugs. Many of these patients experience significant anx-\niety, insomnia, and withdrawal symptoms that lead to re-\nquests for ancillary medications;37,38 benzodiazepines are\noften the drugs prescribed for these symptoms. One of the\nclinical dilemmas in treating such patients is the differ-\nentiation of true psychiatric disorders from drug-seeking\nbehavior. However, with exceptions to be discussed below,\na sound clinical approach to psychiatric complaints in this\npopulation is to monitor for a period of time rather than\nprescribing immediately; select nonbenzodiazepine inter-\nventions whenever possible (e.g., cognitive-behavioral ther-\napy); and, if necessary, utilize certain of the selective sero-\ntonin reuptake inhibitors (below) for anxiety and depressive\nsymptoms; address other co-occurring drug and alcohol\nabuse that may be contributing to the symptoms presented;\nand provide education on sleep hygiene.\nClose monitoring of the use of benzodiazepines and use\nof long-acting medications such as clonazepam are pre-\nferred and must be undertaken if they are to be prescribed.\nThese medications should be prescribed for a short (e.g.,\n2\u00ad4 months) period to prevent development of tolerance\nand dependence.39 Further, frequent re-assessment to de-\ntermine positive benefit (e.g., increase in level of function)\nshould be documented. If improvement does not occur, it\nshould lead the clinician to question the benefit of the ben-\nzodiazepine treatment, given the risks that are apparent\nfrom the data in this paper.\nAside from misuse/abuse/overuse of these drugs with\nmethadone and buprenorphine that can lead to toxicity,\nthere are other important pharmacological reasons to ex-\npect that benzodiazepines in combination with opioids\nmight produce adverse events and even deaths. Benzodi-\nazepines, like opioids, depress the central nervous system,\nalbeit via different pharmacological mechanisms. One of\nmany effects of the binding of an opioid agonist to the mu\nopioid receptor is sedation and altered mental status.40 Ben-\nzodiazepines produce similar effects, but via binding to the\ngamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, producing\nincreased chloride ion flow into the neuron and resulting in\ndecreased membrane excitability.41 A combined pharmaco-\ndynamic effect of these drugs can be to depress the central\nnervous system to the point of toxicity. Indeed, what lit-\ntle information exists on pharmacokinetic interactions be-\ntween methadone and benzodiazepines indicates little in the\nway of significant interactions.42 Pharmacokinetics studies\nbetween buprenorphine and benzodiazepines have not been\nreported to date, despite several reports of buprenorphine\ntoxicity in humans co-abusing these drugs.43,44 The paucity\nof studies available in this area of research underscores the\nneed for it to be undertaken.\nAnother area of concern identified from the data in\nthis paper is the toxicity data related to methadone and\nbuprenorphine in combination with licit medications likely\nprescribed for medical and psychiatric conditions. Of great-\nest concern is the consistent reporting of adverse events\nand deaths across data sets (Table 2), in which methadone\nor buprenorphine occur in combination with psychotrop-\nics such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (in\nparticular, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline,\ncitalopram, and escitalopram). While these drugs are not\nknown to produce mood-altering effects (e.g., \"high,\" se-\ndation), they share a common property of inhibition of\nrole in methadone metabolism.46,47 Further, norfluoxetine,\n84 Buprenorphine and Methadone Use and Abuse January\u00adFebruary 2010\na metabolite of fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine potently in-\nhibit CYP P450 3A4, which is important to the metabolism\nimportant to the metabolism of buprenorphine and its\nfunction is inhibited by fluoxetine and fluvoxamine.48 In-\nhibition of the metabolism of long-acting opioids such as\nmethadone and buprenorphine could lead to toxicity, which\nappears to be the case based on the data in this study. Clin-\nicians need to be aware of the potential for such toxicities\nand judiciously prescribe these medications.\nIf an SSRI must be used in methadone-maintained pa-\ntients, selecting those that do not affect both CYP 450 2D6\nand 3A4 would be preferable (choices would include parox-\netine, sertraline, and citalopram, escitalopram). If there is\na clinical need for use of these medications in methadone-\nmaintained patients, monitoring should be considered to\ninclude a baseline cardiogram with a repeated cardiogram\nafter 2 weeks at a stable dose of antidepressant medica-\ntion in order to follow the cardiac QT interval that can\nincrease should methadone metabolism be inhibited, lead-\ning to greater exposure.49 Patients receiving these medica-\ntions should also be monitored for any increased opioid\neffects that they may be experiencing. Evidence of toxic-\nity should trigger re-evaluation and alteration of the treat-\nment plan. Another consideration is the use of buprenor-\nphine in patients needing an opioid therapy, but who\nwould also benefit from an SSRI treatment of a mental\ndisorder due to its ceiling effect at which increasing ex-\nposure is not associated with increasing opioid effects.50\nFurther, buprenorphine metabolism is less likely to be af-\nfected by SSRIs that primarily effect CYP 450 2D6, but\nnot CYP 450 3A4 (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram,\nOthermedicationsmentionedasbeingpresent incasesof\ntoxicity or deaths related to methadone or buprenorphine\nuse and that inhibit the function of CYP 2D6 include dulox-\netine, clomipramine, doxepin, perphenazine, and hydrox-\nyzine. These medications are commonly used for treatment\nof psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety as\nwell as psychosis (perphenazine). Amitriptyline, frequently\nused for the treatment of depression as well as chronic pain,\nis mentioned in RADARS\u00ae data for methadone. This medi-\ncation is not only itself sedating with potential for pharma-\ncodynamic interactions with methadone and, potentially,\nbuprenorphine, but it is an inhibitor of both CYP 450 3A4\nand 2D6.52 Similarly, atypical antipsychotics, specifically\nquetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone are mentioned in\nassociation with methadone and buprenorphine use. Que-\ntiapine has been reported to be abused by injection and\nnasal insufflation, particularly with cocaine in a combina-\ntion referred to as a \"Q-ball.\"53 It is an inhibitor of CYP\n450 2D6 and is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter p-\nglycoprotein.54 Quetiapine should not be considered a first-\nline treatment of anxiety or psychosis in methadone or\nbuprenorphine-maintained patients. Interestingly, risperi-\ndone and olanzepine do not inhibit metabolic enzymes re-\nlated to methadone or buprenorphine metabolism, but have\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the po-\ntential interactions of every drug mentioned in these ad-\nverse events related to methadone and buprenorphine use.\nHowever, it is useful for clinicians to be aware of the wide\nvariety of substances that may be associated with toxici-\nties in patients treated with these opioid therapies or who\nare abusing these medications. What are the implications?\nDo these data indicate that physicians should avoid the use\nof many psychotropic and analgesic drugs in patients with\nopioid dependence? We would suggest that this paper only\nprovides information that a clinician can use in consider-\ning treatment plans. When possible, clinicians might want\nto avoid medications known to have the potential to pro-\nduce pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions\nin patients. Another possible consideration is to undertake\na genetic test to determine the level of activity of a patient's\nCYP2D6 enzyme, since there are well-documented genetic\npolymorphisms in this enzyme that include both rapid and\npoor metabolism of drugs.57\nClinicians should become accustomed to considering the\npossibility of drug interactions with medications they pre-\nscribe. These data underscore the need to educate patients\nabout the potential for adverse drug interactions when these\nmedications are used together--or when they are misused\nor abused together. Patients should ideally be receiving\nmedications from one prescriber; when this is not possible,\nit is imperative that prescribing clinicians work together to\navoid such toxicities. Patients must be educated about the\nneed not to share medications and to use medications only\nas prescribed. Further, they must be told about possible side\neffects that should be reported to the treatment provider so\nthat rapid intervention(s) can be made if needed. Patient\ntreatment agreements outlining these parameters of treat-\nment may be useful in this population.\nThis confusing picture underscores the need for signif-\nicant improvement of the indicators, particularly as new\nabuse-resistant opioid drugs come to market. New drugs\nare being introduced, but they are placed in ICD-10 codes\nsuch as Other Synthetic Narcotics, which are nonspecific.\nHowever, since 2003, the narrative text on the death cer-\ntificate (referred to as \"death certificate literals\") has been\nretained by NCHS for analysis and work is underway to\ntranslate details on the death certificates into data that can\nexpand the nonspecific ICD-10 code categories. In addi-\ntion, some states with centralized medical examiner sys-\ninformation on the specific drugs and formulations, but\nthey cannot be used to provide national information, since\ndrugs and drug use patterns, particularly use of the opi-\noids, vary across the states. The 2007 SAMHSA Methadone\nMortality Meeting recommended that uniform nomencla-\nture, case definitions, and standards for toxicological test-\ning be used to encourage uniform reporting by medical\nexaminers and coroners and to support analysis.61 This\nrecommendation for standardization was expanded to in-\nclude all the drug-related deaths in a SAMHSA Expert\nImprovement in the collection and reporting of indicator\ndata is needed if FDA and the manufacturers are to meet\nthe requirements of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategies (REMS).62 The key elements of the REMS will\nbe education and certification for prescribers, pharmacists,\nother healthcare providers, or institutions that dispense or\ndirectly administer covered opioid products, as well as pa-\ntient education. The REMS will also use metrics to assess\nthe success of the REMS program in decreasing abuse and\nmisuse of opioids while ensuring they remain available for\npatients who suffer daily from chronic pain. The available\ndata systems discussed in this paper need to be fully sup-\nported and the data reported by manufacturers to FDA\nunder REMS must be freely available to researchers and\npublic health officials who must monitor the effects in their\nareas.\nWhile improvements to data collection systems are es-\nsential to improving public health related to prescription\nopioid abuse, the data collected and presented in this paper\nmake several important points. First, they underscore the\nrapid increases in prescribing of methadone and buprenor-\nphine, the substantial and sobering statistics showing large\nincreases in toxicities and deaths related to misuse of\nthese drugs, and the increases in narcotic trafficking with\nthese medications. Second, the toxicities reported with these\ndrugs in combination with other drugs, particularly other\nlicit medications, underline the lack of understanding or\nconsideration by physicians of the possible toxic effects re-\nlated to drug interactions. While only a few of these data\nshow which toxicities occurred in those prescribed these\nmedications versus those who illicitly obtained and abused\nthese drugs, it is still incumbent on physicians to be aware\nof potential toxicities and to educate their patients regard-\ning these issues. The data in this manuscript may help to\nassist with that process.\nstitute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, Md (Dr. McCance-Katz).\nMany individuals contributed to this paper, and we wish to\nacknowledge Elizabeth Crane and Rong Cai, DAWN; June\nHoward, ARCOS; Liqun L Wong, NFLIS; Elise Bailey,\nRADARS\u00ae; Mathias Forrester, Texas Poison Centers; An-\nnette Kowalski, DSHS; Li-Hui Chen and Margaret Warner,\nCDC, NCHSC; Kim France and Kevin Holman, Covidien;\nand Steven Marcus, New Jersey Poison Information & Edu-\ncation System.\nDeclaration of Interest\nThe authors report no conflict of interest.
