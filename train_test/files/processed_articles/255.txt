Potential\ncases were identified using the NEISS-AIP definition of a sport and recreation injury. The authors then\nreviewed the two line narrative to identify injuries related to participation in a sport or recreational activity\namong men and women more than 64 years old.\nold were treated in emergency departments for injuries sustained while participating in sport or\nrecreational activities. The overall injury rate was 177.3/100 000 population with higher rates for men\nand bicycling caused 17% of injuries among men. Twenty seven percent of all treated injuries were\nfractures and women (34%) were more likely than men (21%) to suffer fractures.\nConclusions: Recreational activities were a frequent cause of injuries among older adults. Fractures were\ncommon. Many of these injuries are potentially preventable. As more persons engage in recreational\nactivities, applying known injury prevention strategies will help to reduce the incidence of these injuries.\nIt is well known that the demographics of the United States\npopulation are changing due to the growing proportion of\nolder Americans.1 It is also well known that regular\nphysical activity throughout life is important for maintaining\na healthy body, enhancing psychological wellbeing, and\npreventing premature death.2 3 Injuries are an unintended\nconsequence of physical activity. Little is known about sport\nand recreational injuries (referred to as recreational injuries\nin this paper), particularly among older persons. This paper\ndescribes recreational injuries among older adults age >65\nyears.\nIncreasing physical activity among all Americans is a\nnational health goal and there have been successful efforts to\nimprove rates of participation.4 A Healthy People 2010\nthe proportion of all Americans who engage in moderate\nphysical activity for 30 minutes at least five times a week. The\nolder Americans, met this goal.5 One significant effort to\nachieve this objective is the National Blueprint, Increasing\nPhysical Activity Among Adults Age 50 and Older.6 This proposal\nwas developed by a collaboration of governmental and\nprivate organizations interested in physical fitness and aging.\nImplementation will lead to greater numbers of older persons\nengaging in physical activity. While increased physical\nactivity will have an overall positive effect on health, it also\nwill increase exposure to the possibility of injury.\nWe know very little about recreational injuries, especially\namong older adults. Gotsch et al analyzed National Electronic\nInjury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP)\nwere 4.3 million recreational injuries treated in United States\nemergency departments.7 The recreational injury rate for\nwomen.7 However, these authors did not examine injury rates\nfor adults age >65 years. Hootman and colleagues surveyed a\nselect population of seniors that included 1569 community\ndwelling persons >60 years old who were enrolled in a\npreventive medicine clinic exercise program. They found that\n17.5% of the respondents reported they had sustained an\nactivity related lower extremity injury to soft tissue or bone.8\nFor the general population of older persons, many of whom\nare not engaged in fitness activities, the recreational injury\nrate likely is markedly lower.\nThe rapid growth in the proportion of Americans age >65\nyears old suggests that the number of recreational injuries\ntreated in emergency departments will grow if efforts at\nincreasing physical activity among older Americans succeed.\nIt is important to characterize recreational injuries to help us\nunderstand the activities associated with higher risk for\ninjury and the mechanisms of injury so that strategies can be\ndeveloped and implemented to prevent these injuries. In this\npaper, we analyzed NEISS-AIP data to describe non-fatal\nrecreational injuries among older adults treated in emergency\ndepartments and provide national estimates of the number of\ninjuries, types of recreational activities, and diagnoses.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from the NEISS-AIP from 1 January 2001\nrecreational injuries among older adults in the United States\n(defined as adults age >65). The Northeastern Ohio\nUniversities College of Medicine Institutional Review Board\nexempted this secondary analysis of public data from review.\nNEISS-AIP is operated by the United States Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission and collects data on initial visits\nfor all types and causes of injuries treated in United States\nemergency departments.9 NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a\nnationally representative subsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS\nhospitals, selected as a stratified probability sample of\nhospitals in the United States and its territories with a\nminimum of six beds and a 24 hour emergency department.\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; NEISS-AIP, National Electronic\nInjury Surveillance System-All Injury Program\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nand consumer product related emergency department cases\neach year.\nEach case was assigned a sample weight based on the\ninverse probability of the hospital being selected. Confidence\nintervals (CIs) were calculated by using a direct variance\nestimation procedure that accounted for the sample weights\nand complex sample design. Rates were calculated by using\n2001 United States Census Bureau population estimates.\nNEISS-AIP defines a recreational injury as one occurring\nduring organized and unorganized activity whether or not\nwork or product related. Injury is defined as bodily harm\nresulting from exposure to an external substance. NEISS\nclassified each case into one of 39 mutually exclusive sport/\nrecreation categories (see box 1) based on an algorithm that\nincluded the consumer product involved (for example, bicycle\nor golf cart) and a two line description of the event. Falls\noccurring on pool decks were classed as recreational injury\nwhen there was clear evidence from the two line summary\nthat the person was swimming. Golf carts are battery\npowered four wheel vehicles frequently used for transporta-\ntion of players and equipment during golf matches. Their use\nis mandatory on many courses that cater to retirees. They also\nare used for transportation in retirement communities and\nelsewhere. We classified golf cart injuries as recreational\nunless there was clear evidence that it was not. We elected to\ndefine all falls while walking as recreational injuries.\nCases were excluded if the cause was violence related or\nthe principal diagnosis was illness. Also excluded were cases\nof pain only, psychological harm only, contact dermatitis,\nadverse effect of surgery or therapeutic drugs, or the patient\nwas dead on arrival or died in the emergency department.\nPotential cases in our analyses were >65 years old and\ninitially identified using the NEISS-AIP definition of a\nrecreational injury. The authors then independently reviewed\nthe two line narrative and identified injuries related to\nparticipation in a recreational activity. Differences were\ndiscussed and resolved.\nExcluded cases were those that:\nN Involved sports/recreation equipment or apparel but had\nno evidence in the narrative that the person was engaged\nin a recreational activity at the time the injury occurred\n(for example, was moving or repairing equipment, had\nequipment fall on them, was injured near a swimming\npool with no evidence of swimming).\nN Involved a powered scooter, a four wheeler or all-terrain\nvehicle at home because these were regarded primarily as\nforms of transportation.\nN Resulted from, or was incidental to, a ``grand parenting\nactivity'' (for example, struck by a child who fell off a\nswing).\nAlso excluded were cases in which the person was a\nspectator at a sport or recreational event or when an injury\nwas related to an occupational activity.\nRESULTS\npersons >65 years old treated in emergency departments for\ninjuries sustained while participating in recreational activ-\nof these were hospitalized. Table 1 shows that the injury rate\nfor men was 60% higher than the rate for women, and the\nrates for both sexes decreased as age increased. Forty percent\nvenue, 13% at home, and 11% in the street (data not shown).\nFigure 1 depicts the distribution of activities associated\nwith non-fatal recreational injuries for men and women.\nApproximately 70% of injuries occurred as a result of five\ncategories of activity: bicycling, exercising, fishing, golfing,\nand snow skiing. However, older men and women were\ninjured in a wide variety of activities as seen by the large\nproportion characterized as ``other'' injuries (see box 1).\nExercise was the activity most often associated with injury\noccurrence. Thirty percent of women and 16% of men were\ninjured while exercising (which included walking, running,\nTai Chi, equipment, and exercise classes). Bicycling, snow\nskiing, and exercise were virtually equal as sources of injury\nfor men, closely followed by golf and fishing. Bicycling was\nthe second leading source of recreational injuries among\nwomen. Snow skiing ranked fourth for women, but the\nfrequency was similar to bicycling and golf. Fishing was a\ncommon source of injuries for men but not for women. Most\nof the fishing injuries were foreign body (fishhook) injuries\nBox 1: Categories of sport/recreational injury\nN Amusement attraction.\nN All-terrain vehicle.\nN Baseball.\nN Basketball.\nN Bicycle.\nN Billiards.\nN Bowling.\nN Camping.\nN Combative.\nN Exercise.\nN Fishing.\nN Football.\nN Go-kart.\nN Golfing.\nN Gymnastics.\nN Hockey.\nN Horseback.\nN Miscellaneous ball games.\nN Moped/powered minibike/off*.\nN Non-powder gun.\nN Personal watercraft.\nN Playground.\nN Racquet sports.\nN Scooter.\nN Skateboarding.\nN Skating, ice.\nN Skating, in-line.\nN Skating, other.\nN Snow skiing.\nN Snowmobile.\nN Soccer.\nN Softball.\nN Swimming.\nN Toboggan/sled/disk.\nN Tack and field.\nN Trampoline.\nN Volleyball.\nN Waterskiing/surfing.\nN Other, specify.\n*Two wheeled off-road powered vehicles including dirt bikes and\ntrail bikes.\nRecreational injuries among older adults 135\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nbut exposure and insect bites were also sources of injuries.\nMany of the golf cart injuries common among men and\nwomen resulted from inappropriate operation of golf carts\n(for example, tipping on a slope, driving while impaired).\nThe single most common type of all non-fatal injuries\ntreated in emergency departments was fracture (table 2).\nFractures comprised 27% of all injuries and were more\ncommon among women. One third of women were treated\nfor fractures compared with one fifth of men. Women also\nwere more likely to suffer sprains and strains, the second\nleading injury diagnosis for both sexes. Internal injury was\nthe least common consequence of recreational activities and\noccurred in less than 5% of all cases.\nTable 3 presents the distribution of non-fatal injuries\namong different body sites. The pattern for location of\ninjuries was similar for men and women. Extremities were\nthe most common site and accounted for half of all injuries.\nWhile the overall picture is similar, it is worth noting that one\nthird of injuries for women compared with one fifth of\ninjuries for men were to the leg and foot.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of non-fatal\nrecreational injuries sustained by older adults treated in\nemergency departments. The injuries sustained by persons in\nthis study reflect the current population based rates of\nparticipation in sports and recreational activities by older\nadults. With the changing demographics and the promotion\nof physical activity, these rates will likely increase and\nrecreational injuries among older adults will become a more\npressing public health issue.\nOlder adults engaged in a variety of recreational activities.\nExercise (including walking, equipment use, and exercise\nclasses), bicycling, snow skiing, golf, and fishing were\nresponsible for the majority of recreational injuries. These\ninjuries ranged from serious that are associated with\nsignificant morbidity and mortality (for example, fractures)\nto minor that required little medical attention (for example, a\nfishhook in the finger).\nWhile many injuries to older adults that are treated in the\nemergency department may appear to be minor, they may\nhave important long term consequences. Such injuries can\nseriously affect an older person's ability to function inde-\npendently. Shapiro and coworkers followed up a group of\npersons >65 years old who were treated in the emergency\ndepartment for minor injuries (including 26% fracture.) They\nfound that 7% of them had decreased scores in fundamental\nactivities of daily living and 23% had decreased scores in\ninstrumental activities of daily living.10\nOlder people are not commonly the focus of injury\nprevention programs. Given these results, it appears that\ndesigning injury prevention programs for older adults would\nTable 1 Number and rate of recreational injury for persons >65 years old, United\nPatient\nFigure 1 Distribution of activities that\ncause recreational injuries to persons\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nbe worthwhile now--and probably more so in the future.\nBicycling, a common source of recreational injuries, can be\nmade safer through environmental modifications that sepa-\nrate bicycles from traffic.11 Such efforts will benefit cyclists of\nall ages. Wearing protective equipment when cycling is\nanother effective injury prevention strategy,12 and older\nadults should be encouraged to adopt such safety measures.\nOperating golf carts inappropriately (for example, striking\nobjects, tipping the cart, and attempting to board a moving\ncart) resulted in many recreational injuries. Strategies such as\neducation programs that focus on using golf carts safely may\nreduce such injuries.\nOur estimates of the number of recreational injuries among\nolder adults are subject to some important limitations. First,\nwe did not have information on how frequently older adults\nparticipated in the various recreational activities. Thus, we\ndid not have the ability to calculate the true risk for the\ninformation that we reported. We used census data to\ncalculate rates for population groups. Rates calculated with\ntime engaged in an activity (exposure) as the denominator\nmay reveal a different picture.\nSecond, the report included only non-fatal injuries treated\nin hospital emergency departments. We are missing injuries\nthat were treated in physicians' offices, free standing medical\ncenters or other clinics, those that did not require medical\nattention, and fatal injuries. People who are injured are likely\nto go to the emergency department for treatment. Injuries\naccounted for 37% of initial emergency department visits13\ncompared with about 7% (56.4 million) of physician visits\n(including both initial treatment and follow up care).14 No\ndoubt many of the office visits are to follow up care received\nin the emergency department. Additionally, Kinney and\nGerson reported that in a Midwestern midsize city, 80% of\npersons who had a private physician were first treated for an\ninjury at a free standing emergency medical center.15 This\nadds further support that private physicians' offices are often\nnot the first place injured persons visit for treatment. We\nelected to focus on non-fatal injuries because information\nTable 2 Number and percent distribution of diagnoses for recreational injury to persons\nDiagnosis Unweighted No Weighted No 95% CI %\nMale\nFemale\nTotal\nTable 3 Number and percent distribution of body part injured for recreational injury to\nBody part injured Unweighted No Weighted No 95% CI %\nMale\nFemale\nTotal\nRecreational injuries among older adults 137\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nabout deaths is not well captured by NEISS-AIP. Categorizing\nfatal recreational injuries would require details that are often\nmissing in emergency department records of fatal events.\nA third limitation was that the algorithm used to classify\nan injury relies on both the product involved and a two line\ndescription of the event. These descriptions often were\nsketchy and it was difficult to determine if the person was\nengaged in a recreational activity or if the event was classified\nas recreational because of the product. For example, there\nwere a number of cases where a person fell on a pool deck. It\nwas difficult to determine if the person was on the deck\nbecause they were swimming or they just happened to fall\nwhile on the deck for other reasons. We included as\nrecreational injury only those cases in which there was clear\nevidence from the two line summary that the person was\nswimming. Similarly, for injuries that involved golf carts, it\nwas not always clear whether the person was using the cart\nas part of a golf game or for transportation. We assumed that\nit was recreational unless there was clear evidence that it was\nnot. Another difficult decision was if a fall occurred while\nwalking. We elected to define all falls while walking as\nrecreational injuries. Although we did our best to classify\ninjuries, the limited information likely contributed to some\nmisclassification.\nNEISS-AIP is an important injury surveillance system.\nHowever, it is constrained by the information available in the\nmedical record as well as the limited space provided by the\ntwo line narrative description. It would be helpful if\ninformation about the use of safety equipment were included\nin the medical record. It is important for emergency\nphysicians to ask about use of protective equipment and to\nrecord whether it was used. In addition to recording valuable\ninformation, this interaction provides an opportunity for the\nphysician to counsel the patient and family about safety and\nthe importance of using protective equipment. Although only\none complete year of data is currently available, NEISS-AIP\nwill provide ongoing surveillance of recreational injuries and\nin future permit analyses of injury trends.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe described the epidemiology of recreational injuries among\nolder adults treated in emergency departments. Older adults\nwere injured while participating in a wide variety of\nrecreational activities, particularly while bicycling and exer-\ncising. Fractures were common and women were more likely\nthan men to suffer fractures. Many of these injuries are\npotentially preventable. As more persons engage in recrea-\ntional activities, applying known injury prevention strategies\nwill help to reduce the incidence of these injuries.\n"
