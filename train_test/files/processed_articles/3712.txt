A\npeacock's tail, which is useless and costly to sustain, is the most famous example of an\nornament. Showing off and creativity may be the human equivalents of this ornamentation\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\n(Miller, 2000). Certain polygynous species, such as the elephant seal, become weapon\nspecialists, relying primarily on intrasexual combat to achieve reproductive success. Other\nspecies, such as the peacock and numerous birds of paradise, specialize in intersexual\nselection to produce extravagant male ornaments. Humans are versatile animals who rely on\na large brain to facilitate amassing and facultatively employing a large repertoire of survival\nand reproductive strategies, including weapons and ornaments.\nEven though ancestral men may have used intrasexual combat more than intersexual\nornaments in acquiring mates (Puts, 2010) and much human female choice may also have\nderived from male contests (Berglund et al., 1996), modern men use both intrasexual and\nintersexual mating strategies as evidenced by much research showing a clear association\nbetween mating motivation and various behaviors that constitute weapons and ornaments in\nmen. Specific weapon-like behaviors under mating investigation include physical or direct\naggression in response to provocation (Daly and Wilson, 1988; Griskevicius et al., 2009;\nKirkpatrick, Waugh, Valencia, and Webster, 2002; Terrell, Patock-Peckham, and Nagoshi,\n2009), throwing darts at humanoid rather than inanimate object targets (Mussweiler and\nForster, 2000), social dominance and status (Li et al., 2013; Valentine, Li, Penke, and Perrett,\n2014), endorsing warring attitudes (Chang, Lu, Li, and Li, 2011), and producing a low voice\npitch (Puts, Doll, and Hill, 2014). The studied ornament-like behaviors include conspicuous\nmaterial consumption (Griskevicius et al., 2007; Sundie et al., 2011), risk taking (Baker and\nManer, 2008; Frankenhuis, Dotsch, Karremans, and Wigboldus, 2010; Pawlowski, Atwal,\nbeing unique and non-conforming (Griskevicius, Goldstein, Mortensen, Cialdini, and\nKenrick, 2006), becoming loss averse (Li, Kenrick, Griskevicius, and Neuberg, 2012),\nmaking generous financial donations (Iredale, Van Vugt, and Dunbar, 2008), and exhibiting\nheroic altruism (Griskevicius et al., 2007), all of which are preferred by women.\nThese studies suggest that, similar to other male animals, men can exhibit weapon-\nlike and ornament-like behaviors, but, unlike many male animals that specialize in either\nweapons or ornaments nearly to the exclusion of the other, men seem to have developed the\nversatility to acquire and apply both strategies to facultatively respond to intrasexual and\nintersexual competition. Men may use weapons and ornaments facultatively as situational\nresponses to intersexual and intrasexual conditions and, over time, may also develop\nbehavioral tendencies in using one strategy more frequently over the other, adding to the vast\nindividual differences along a weapon-ornament dimension. However, existing mating\nresearch has not investigated this potential human versatility either in terms of facultative\nsituational response or in terms of personality differences. Because male contest, female\nchoice, and sperm competition are all involved in human mating (Puts, 2010), not\ndistinguishing the facultative use among different strategies prevents existing studies from\nidentifying the specific sexual selection mechanism driving a particular mating behavior.\nSpecifically, existing studies have not manipulated intrasexual and intersexual conditions to\ndetermine whether men respond using weapon-like or ornament-like behaviors. Instead, the\ntypical research paradigm has involved activating a general male mating motivation by\nexposing male participants to attractive female photographs (e.g., Lu and Chang, 2012) or\nby making them think about romantic partners or events (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009) and\nobserving their behavioral responses. Although the subsequent behavioral responses can be\nshown to be either weapons or ornaments, few studies have concurrently examined these two\noutcomes or have empirically linked them to intrasexual or intersexual selection conditions.\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nSome studies using the general mating motivation approach have obtained results\nsimilar to mapping intrasexual or intersexual conditions with weapon-like or ornament-like\nbehaviors, but have not included both selection conditions or both behavioral outcomes in\nthe same study. For example, Frankenhuis et al. (2010) had male participants walk across a\nrope bridge toward a female or male target in a 3D, virtual reality setting. A female or male\nexperimenter guided the participants to cross the bridge. Although it was not the intention of\nthe study, the design yielded intrasexual (i.e., male target and female experimenter or female\ntarget and male experimenter) and intersexual conditions (i.e., female target and female\nexperimenter) for the male participants. Frankenhuis et al. (2010) examined risk taking,\nwhich is an ornament-like behavior, based on the speed at which the male participants\ncrossed the bridge. As expected, the participants moved the fastest under the intersexual\ncondition (M = .62 m/s) and slowest under the intrasexual condition (M = .46 m/s), but the\nstudy did not include weapon-like behavior.\nIn another example, Griskevicius et al. (2009) induced a general mating motivation\nby having male participants envision a romantic scenario and examined their physical\naggression toward imagined insults from a same-sex stranger. However, the focus of this\nstudy was the audience effect of either a male or a female spectator witnessing the insult. The\ngeneral mating motivation and the spectator manipulation together generated the additional\nintrasexual (male witness) and intersexual (female witness) conditions. The results indicated\nthat when the witness was male (intrasexual), the general mating motivation affected direct\naggression of the male participants, whereas when the witness was female (intersexual),\nmating motivation did not influence aggression. The study did not include ornament-like\nbehavior to assess the possibility of facultative switching between the two mating strategies.\nFinally, Hodges-Simeon, Gaulin, and Puts (2011; also see Puts, Gaulin, and\nVerdolini, 2006) showed that voice pitch as a weapon was related to intrasexual competition.\nIn this study, male participants introduced themselves to a female date (intersexual condition)\nand then addressed a male suitor of that date (intrasexual condition). The participants' speech\nwas recorded during both conditions. The results showed that a monotone voice, representing\nintrasexual dominance or a weapon-like strategy, was exhibited during the intrasexual but\nnot the intersexual condition. Again, the contrasting effect on ornament-like behavior was\nnot investigated. Together, these studies suggest that men potentially use weapons and\nornaments facultatively in response to intrasexual and intersexual selection conditions, even\nthough no study has explicitly manipulated both sexual selection conditions or has\ninvestigated both weapon-like and ornament-like behavioral outcomes.\nIn the present study, we manipulated intrasexual and intersexual conditions to\nobserve the corresponding weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors among men. Creativity\nand aggression were used as ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors, respectively, to test\nthe hypothesis that intersexual selection situations increase ornamental displays, whereas\nintrasexual selection situations increase the use of weapons. Creativity may be a human\nornament that evolved through intersexual selection (Haselton and Miller, 2006; Miller,\n2000). It is a costly and a reliable indicator of mental and physical fitness (F\u00f6rster, Friedman,\nand Liberman, 2004; but see also Puts [2010] for criticism) and is therefore worth showing\noff to draw the attention of potential mates (Griskevicius, Cialdini, and Kenrick, 2006;\nMiller, 2000). Recent studies have shown that creativity can be situationally enhanced based\non mating motives (e.g., F\u00f6rster, Epstude, and \u00d6zelsel, 2009; Griskevicius, Cialdini, et al.,\n2006). Aggression that is directly related to intrasexual combat obviously functions as\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nweapon-like behavior (Puts, 2010). Aggression and war have been associated with mating\nsuccess in both prehistoric and modern societies (Chagnon, 1988; Daly and Wilson, 1988;\nPuts, 2010). For example, in the hunter-gatherer Hadza tribes in Tanzania, the courtship of a\nwoman by multiple male suitors could cause aggressive or even fatal combat among men\n(Marlowe, 2004). These studies confirm the validity of aggression and creativity as weapon-\nlike and ornament-like mating strategies.\nWe conducted three studies. In the first two studies, we manipulated two dating\nsituations relevant to intrasexual and intersexual selection, and examined how they\ninfluenced aggression (as a weapon) and creativity (as an ornament). In Study 3, we\nconducted a questionnaire investigation to examine whether being creative and aggressive as\npersonality traits were also associated with intersexual courtship and intrasexual competition,\nrespectively.\nIn Study 1, we tested the hypothesis that men demonstrated weapon-like as opposed\nto ornament-like behaviors when motivated by intrasexual rather than intersexual\ncompetition. However, the same effect was not expected from women because men are more\nlikely to experience sexual selection pressures than women are (Archer, 2009; Buss, 1989;\nmanipulated during a simulated dating game, and creativity and aggression tasks were used\nto represent ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors, respectively.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe sample consisted of 132 Chinese undergraduate students (average age = 20.11\nyears, SD = 1.01; 66 men) who received a moderate monetary incentive for their\nparticipation. A 2 (participant gender) x 3 (sexual selection situations: intersexual vs.\nintrasexual vs. control, between participants) x 2 (mating strategies: creativity vs. aggression,\nwithin participants) mixed design was used.\nThe participants were randomly assigned to intersexual, intrasexual selection, or\ncontrol conditions. After arriving at the laboratory, the male participants were shown a\nphotograph of an attractive woman, which was pre-rated by an independent group of judges,\nand told that they may be selected to participate in a dating game with that woman based on\ntheir performance in two subsequent tasks. In the intersexual selection condition, the male\nparticipant was told that the woman in the photograph would evaluate his task performance\nand select her dating game partner. In the intrasexual selection condition, the male participant\nwas told that his performance would be evaluated by other male participants in selecting the\ndating game partner. The female participants were shown a photograph of an attractive man\nand given either one of the same two types of instructions for playing the dating game with\nthat man. After being prepared for intrasexual or intersexual selection conditions, the\nparticipants were assigned creativity (category inclusion) and aggression (competitive\nreaction time) tasks. Half of the participants completed the category inclusion task first,\nfollowed by the competitive reaction time task and vice versa for the other half of the\nparticipants. After completing the tasks, the participants answered four questions addressing\ntheir positive and negative mood by using a 9-point scale (two items for each mood;\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nGriskevicius et al., 2009). Finally, they were thanked and debriefed. The control group,\nwhich received no mating instructions, simply participated in the creativity and aggression\ntasks. Their performances served as a baseline to confirm that the expected differences\nbetween the intrasexual and intersexual groups were obtained because the hypothesized\ngroup exhibited a superior performance, but not because the opposite group exhibited an\ninferior performance compared with the control group.\nCreativity task\nCreative performance was measured using a category inclusion task (Isen and\nDaubman, 1984) that has been widely used in creativity research (e.g., De Dreu and Nijstad,\n2008; Friedman and Forster, 2000). This task is used to test cognitive flexibility and\nideational originality based on the breadth of inclusion of items atypical of a category\n(Murray, Sujan, Hirt, and Sujan, 1990) and has been found to correlate with associative\nthoughts, cognitive flexibility, and originality of ideas (Gasper and Middlewood, 2014;\nMiron-Spektor, Gino, and Argote, 2011; Nijstad, De Dreu, Rietzschel, and Baas, 2010). The\nparticipants were given three categories (furniture, vegetables, and clothing), each containing\nnine exemplar items. Three of these items were strong exemplars, three were moderate\nexemplars, and three were poor exemplars of the category. The nine items within each\ncategory were individually presented in a fixed order that differed in typicality from most\n(e.g., sofa for the furniture category), to moderately (e.g., bookcase for the furniture\ncategory), to least typical (e.g., telephone for the furniture category). The participants\nindicated how typical each item was for the named category on a 10-point scale ranging from\n1 (atypical) to 10 (typical). Using highly and moderately typical exemplars (e.g., sofa and\nbookcase for the furniture category) as representatives of a category is not presumed to\nrequire cognitive flexibility (Isen and Daubman, 1984) because such exemplars clearly\nbelong to a specific category. Using atypical exemplars (e.g., telephone) in the category\nrequires seeing these exemplars in unusual ways. Therefore, the extent to which these\nexemplars are used reflects cognitive flexibility and creativity. Based on relevant literature\naggregated the typicality ratings of the nine atypical exemplars for each category, forming a\ncreativity index. The internal consistency reliability estimate was .75.\nAggression task\nEach participant played the competitive reaction time game (e.g., Bushman, 2002),\nostensibly against a same-sex competitor who was sitting inside a cubicle opposite the\nparticipant. Although the participants assumed they played against same-sex players, they\nplayed against a computer programmed to mimic their responses. The participant pressed a\nbutton as fast as possible during a series of trials, expecting to receive or send a blast of white\nnoise based on which player \u00ad the participant or his opponent, responded slower. Before\nbeginning the game, the participants determined the intensity level (ranging between 60\ndecibels [Level 1] and 105 decibels [Level 10]) and duration (ranging from 0.5 seconds\n[Level 1] to 5 seconds [Level 10]) of white noise that their opponent would experience when\nreacting slower compared with the participant. A nonaggressive no-noise option (0 decibels)\nwas also offered. Thus, the participants were provided \"weapons\" to inflict pain on same-sex\ncompetitors.\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nThe task comprised nine trials, and the initial trial was not provoked. The participant\nheard noises during half of the trials (randomly determined). Previous studies (e.g., Bushman\nand Baumeister, 1998; Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, and Stucke, 2001) have shown that the\nfirst trial yields the optimal measure of unprovoked aggression because the participants have\nnot yet experienced aversive blasts of white noise from the opponent. Based on this literature,\nwe used the blast intensity and duration selected in the first trial as measures of aggression.\nThe two variables (intensity and duration) were converted into z-scores and summed to\ngenerate a composite aggression score.\nResults and Discussion\nNo statistical differences existed between the intrasexual and intersexual selection\n0.36, p = .55). This suggests that the aggression derived from intrasexual competition is not\nassociated with negative arousal (i.e., anger and frustration).\nConsistent with predictions, an ANOVA of the 2 (participant gender) x 3 (intersexual\nselection vs. intrasexual selection vs. control) x 2 (creativity vs. aggression) mixed design\nthe specific study hypotheses, we performed a series of planned comparisons of creativity\nand aggression (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

Error bars indicate \u00b1 SE\nRegarding creativity, we predicted that intersexual selection motives would enhance\nmale creativity. The men in the intersexual selection condition exhibited higher creativity\n= 0.73). There was no difference between the intrasexual and control conditions (t[63] = 0.28,\np = .78). The female participants exhibited no differences regarding creativity levels between\nthe intersexual (M = 4.05, SD = 2.16) and intrasexual selection conditions (M = 4.04, SD =\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nConcerning aggression, we predicted that intrasexual selection motives would\nenhance male aggression. The men in the intrasexual selection condition exhibited higher\n2.63, p = .01, d = 0.89). There was no difference between the intersexual and control\nconditions (t[63] = 0.46, p = .65). The women exhibited no differences regarding aggression\nlevels between the intrasexual (M = -.73, SD = 1.33) and intersexual selection conditions (M\n= 0.32, p = .75). These results suggest that, as explicated by sexual selection theory,\nintersexual and intrasexual selection conditions elicit distinct male mating strategies. Similar\nto other animals that specialize in ornamental or weapon strategies, men respond to the two\nsexual selections by exhibiting corresponding ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors.\nIn Study 1, one photograph of an attractive person of the opposite sex was used to\nestablish mating motivation. Although a single photograph has been widely used (e.g., Baker\nand Maner, 2009), allowing the participants to choose from multiple photographs may more\neffectively activate mating motivation. Thus, in Study 2, the participants chose their mates.\nWe also altered the intrasexual and intersexual selection manipulations by asking the\nparticipants to imagine real dating situations. The same aggression task was used as in Study\n1, but a different creativity task was used that relies on independent judges to assess the\noriginality of novel ideas. We also eliminated the control group and only compared\nintrasexual with intersexual conditions because Study 1 had already shown that the expected\nchange in aggression and creativity was due to the relevant experimental groups. With these\nchanges, we expected Study 2 to replicate the results of Study 1.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe sample consisted of 100 Chinese undergraduate students (average age = 20.37\nyears, SD = 0.86; 50 men) who received a moderate payment for their participation.\nAfter arriving at the laboratory, the participants viewed a computer screen that\ndisplayed photographs of 10 attractive members of the opposite sex. They chose one person\nwhose photograph was displayed onscreen and were asked to imagine romantically pursuing\nthis person. In the intersexual condition, the male participants were told that the woman had\nother male suitors and that she would decide whom to date after reviewing how the\nparticipants performed in two subsequent tasks. In the intrasexual selection condition, the\nmale participants were told that they and other male suitors would decide who would date\nthe chosen woman after completing two tasks. The female participants were given the same\ninstructions regarding male targets and female suitors. After the sexual selection\nmanipulation, the participants completed the aggression and creativity tasks in a\ncounterbalanced order. Finally, the participants completed the four mood state questions.\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nThe experiment design was a 2 (participant gender) x 2 (sexual selection situations:\nintersexual vs. intrasexual) x 2 (mating strategies: creativity vs. aggression) mixed-factorial\ndesign. Gender and selection situation were the between-participants factors and mating\nstrategy was a within-participant factor.\nThe Unusual Uses Task (Friedman and Forster, 2000) was implemented as the\ncreativity measure in Study 2. During this task, the participants listed as many creative uses\nof a tin can as possible in 1 minute. This yielded 130 unique uses, which four independent\njudges rated for originality by using a 9-point scale. The interrater reliability was .86. The\ncreativity score represented the average originality rating for all uses proposed by a\nparticipant.\nResults and Discussion\nNo statistical differences existed between the intrasexual and intersexual selection\n1.66, p = .20). An ANOVA of the 2 (participant gender) x 2 (intrasexual vs. intersexual\nselection conditions, between participants) x 2 (creativity, aggression, within participants)\nThe results are shown in Figure 2. Men in the intersexual selection condition demonstrated\nhigher originality levels (M = 4.45, SD = 1.26) than men in the intrasexual selection condition\nselection condition showed higher aggression levels (M = 1.53, SD = 2.26) than men in the\nFigure 2. Intersexual and intrasexual effect on creativity and aggression in Study 2\nNote. Error bars indicate \u00b1 SE\nRegarding the female participants, there were no significant differences in creativity\nt [48] = 0. 67, p = .51), and there were no significant differences in aggression between\n-0.45, p = .65). These results replicate those of Study 1, supporting the hypothesis that, in\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nmen but not women, intersexual selection yielded ideational originality (an ornamental\ndisplay) and intrasexual selection yielded aggression (a weapon-like behavior).\nThe first two studies showed that male behavioral response to intrasexual and\nintersexual selection pressures was weapon-like (e.g., aggressive) or ornament-like (e.g.,\ncreative). Over time, varying environmental pressures can select people who specialize in\none survival and reproductive strategy slightly more compared with others, generating\npersonality and individual differences (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). In this study, we\nexamined how individual differences among men regarding aggression and creativity were\nassociated with the ways by which men respond to intrasexual and intersexual mating\ncompetition. We developed a questionnaire to measure male preferences regarding using\nintrasexual competition or intersexual courtship to compete for mates. We hypothesized that\ncreative men would engage in intersexual courtship more than aggressive men would,\nwhereas aggressive men would engage in intrasexual competition more than creative men\nwould.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and procedures\nBecause sexual selection conditions yielded no effect on female mating behaviors in\nStudies 1 and 2, only Chinese male university students participated in Study 3 (n = 118;\naverage age = 19.39 years, SD = 1.25). The participants were asked about their current partner\nstatus, completed a short questionnaire, and were assured of their confidentiality and\nanonymity. Forty percent of the participants were currently in a romantic relationship.\nMeasures\nCreative personality was measured using the Creative Personality Scale (CPS)\ndeveloped by Gough (1979). It comprises 20 adjectives that are self-rated on a 5-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sample items included\n\"insightful,\" \"inventive,\" and \"conventional\" (reverse-coded). As a measure of creative\npersonality, the CPS has been shown to relate to other-rated creativity (e.g., Silvia, Wigert,\nReiter-Palmon, and Kaufman, 2012). The internal consistency reliability estimate was .76.\nAggressive personality was assessed using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire\n(Buss and Perry, 1992). The questionnaire comprises 29 items, forming four subscales:\nphysical aggression (e.g., \"I have threatened people I know\"), verbal aggression (e.g., \"I\noften find myself disagreeing with people\"), anger (e.g., \"I have difficulty controlling my\ntemper\"), and hostility (e.g., \"I know that my `friends' talk about me behind my back\"). The\nparticipants evaluated the extent to which these statements were characteristic or\nuncharacteristic of themselves, using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely\nuncharacteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic of me). Based on the original intention\nof the scale, a general trait aggression score was calculated by averaging the scores across all\nitems. The internal consistency reliability estimate was .84.\nWe developed a 26-item questionnaire in Chinese, the Men's Mating Strategy Scale,\nto measure male preferences for using intrasexual or intersexual mating strategies. By using\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\na 6-point scale ranging from most unlikely to most likely, the men indicated what they would\ndo to pursue their mate choice. Twelve questions represented intersexual courtship (e.g., \"I\nwould appeal to her;\" \"I would work hard to show her that I am worth her love\") and 14\nquestions represented intrasexual competition (e.g., \"I would prevent other men from getting\ntoo close to her;\" \"I would make sure I am respected by other guys in front of my girl\"). A\nprinciple component factor analysis using eigenvalues larger than 1.0 extracted two factors\ncorresponding to intersexual courtship and intrasexual competition. The two factors\naccounted for 53.33% of the variance. Factor loadings ranged between .56 and .83. The\nEnglish translation of the Chinese items and factor loadings are reported in Appendix 1. We\naveraged the relevant items to form the two mating strategy variables. The internal\nconsistency reliability estimates were .89 for intersexual courtship and .93 for intrasexual\ncompetition.\nResults and Discussion\nWe conducted multiple regression analyses using each of the two mating strategies\nas a dependent variable and using, by simultaneous entry, age, partner status, and creative\nand aggressive personality as predictors. To exclude the possible effect of an interaction\nbetween creativity and aggression, we generated an interaction term by multiplying the\nstandardized aggression and creativity scores and entering the interaction variable in the\nregression. Table 1 lists the results of these analyses.\nTable 1. Regression of intersexual courtship and intrasexual competition on creativity and\naggression\nIntersexual courtship Intrasexual competition\nb SE  t b SE  t\nThe results in the left column of Table 1 indicate that creativity, but not aggression,\nwas positively related to intersexual courtship. The results in the right column of Table 1\nshowed that aggression, but not creativity, was positively related to intrasexual competition.\nThe interaction between creativity and aggression did not predict intersexual courtship or\nintrasexual competition. These results support the hypothesis that creative men were more\nlikely to use intersexual courtship, whereas aggressive men were more likely to exhibit\nintrasexual competition, suggesting that individual differences in creativity and aggression\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nas personality traits may also have been shaped by sexual selection in response to intersexual\nand intrasexual competitions. Finally, the correlation between intersexual courtship and\nintrasexual competition was .21. Like other weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors, these\nmating strategies or styles are distinct, but they also show moderate overlapping, reflecting\nan overall mating motivation as well as the possibility that some ornaments may have been\nGeneral Discussion\nWe tested the hypothesis that men respond to intersexual and intrasexual selection by\nperforming weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors, respectively. This facultative response\nof men contrasts with other male animals that specialize either in weapons or ornaments as\nnearly exclusive mating strategies. The findings obtained by manipulating the modes of\nsexual selection in Studies 1 and 2 yielded converging support for the prediction that men\nwould respond to intrasexual selection with elevated aggression and to intersexual selection\nwith enhanced creativity. During the simulated dating games, male aggression, but not\ncreativity, was elevated when the right to date a mate was decided by other male suitors. By\ncontrast, an elevated level of creativity, but not aggression, was exhibited when the female\ndating targets chose a suitor. Thus, men facultatively employ weapons or ornaments as a\nmating strategy based on situational demands. Similarly, we showed in Study 3 that\nindividual differences in creativity and aggression as personality traits were also associated\nwith men's mating strategies. Based on the mating strategy questionnaire, aggression\nsignificantly predicted a preference for intrasexual mating strategies and creativity\nsignificantly predicted a preference for intersexual mating strategies. These findings suggest\nthat intersexual and intrasexual selection pressure over time may select some men to\nspecialize in one reproductive strategy slightly more compared to other men, adding to the\nvast personality and individual differences along a weapon-ornament dimension.\nAlthough some of these findings seem self-evident within the framework of sexual\nselection theory, this research is among the first to empirically manipulate both intersexual\nand intrasexual selection conditions to study the corresponding weapon-like and ornament-\nlike behaviors. The findings confirm the power of sexual selection, which has shaped most\nanimal species, including currently monogamous species such as human beings, after\nmillions of years of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Because of a large brain and\nparental investment, monogamous human males do not show the same level of biological\nintensity in building and using weapons or ornaments compared with certain polygynous\nmale animals. However, humans compensate for a lack of biological enhancements with\nextended phenotypes. Weapons and ornaments are extended throughout human culture in\nwars and the military (Chang et al., 2011) and in art, music, and literature (Miller, 2000).\nEmploying these culturally extended weapons and ornaments is also facultative. Men's\nartistic creativity was shown to increase when performing for women compared with men\n(Griskevicius, Cialdini, et al., 2006). Preindustrial tribesmen fought wars to compete for\nwomen (Manson and Wrangham, 1991), and such competitions continued within the\ncontemporary military (Nikoli-Ristanovi, 2000). Culturally extended weapons and\nornaments are also widely depicted in literary works and are often embodied in the lives of\ntheir writers. A fitting example is the 19th century Russian poet, Pushkin, who wrote\nnumerous notable poems (ornaments) and fought and died in a duel (weapons) for the love\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nof women. More often, however, are warriors and poets \"played out\" by disparate men,\nrepresenting personality differences in using weapons and ornaments. Large human brains\nenable humans to amass and culturally extend a substantial repertoire of survival and\nreproductive strategies, including weapons and ornaments. Thus, humans are facultative and\nflexible, using various strategies to solve specific survival and reproductive challenges, and\ndisplaying substantial personality and individual differences when selecting relevant\nstrategies.\nSeveral limitations affected the present study. First, the developed mating strategy\nquestionnaire used in Study 3 lacked sufficient evidence of validity. We conducted focus\ngroups to determine items for inclusion and conducted a factor analysis to confirm that these\nitems conformed to the expected two-factor structure. However, the questionnaire was not\ncorrelated with other constructs to provide external, rather than merely internal, evidence of\nconstruct validity. Second, we used a between-subjects design to manipulate the intrasexual\nand intersexual selection conditions among two groups of men. Future studies should use a\nwithin-subjects design to examine how a single group of male participants facultatively\nswitches between weapons and ornaments. Third, we used aggression and creativity to\nrepresent weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors. Because our aggression task involved\nblasting white noise against a same-gender opponent, using such a task as the dependent\nvariable could introduce an additional intrasexual competition component that was not\ncounterbalanced by an additional intersexual component with the creativity task. Future\nresearch could use other weapon-like variables that do not directly involve intrasexual\ncompetition.\nFinally, we conceptualized that male ornaments arise from female choice and do not\nserve adaptive functions other than attracting females, and that male weapons originate from\nmale-male competition. This is typically consistent with sexual selection theory. However,\nsome human ornamental traits such as creativity, sense of humor, and risk taking do serve\nadaptive functions other than attracting mates (Fessler, Tiokhin, Holbrook, Gervais, and\nSnyder, 2014; Li et al., 2009), and the mate choices of women seem to exceed merely\nsuperior genes or ornaments. They also include weapon-like attributes such as dominance\nand competence (Valentine et al., 2014) derived from intrasexual competition, as well as\nfatherly qualities such as loving and being kind (Li, Valentine, and Patel, 2011; Low, 2005;\nLu, Zhu, and Chang, in press). There is also evidence suggesting that ancestral and modern\nhumans have substantial weapon-based sexual dimorphism (Lassek and Gaulin, 2009), that\nmale contest competition rather than female choice or sperm competition was the primary\nmechanism driving male mating competition over human evolution (Puts, 2010), and that\nsome ornaments may have initially been selected through intrasexual combat but later\nbecame used as ornaments because fighting prowess indicates male condition to both sexes\n(Berglund et al., 1996). However, a discussion of the origins of human mating is beyond the\nscope of the present study, which is based on the simpler premise that the large human brain\nenables extraordinary versatility for acquiring and employing varieties of survival and\nreproductive strategies including weapons and ornaments. Despite these limitations, this\nstudy is among the first to manipulate both intersexual and intrasexual selection conditions\nto study how they affect weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors among men. It is also one\nof the few studies of human mating competition not conducted on a Western, educated,\nindustrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) population (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan,\n2010), which is especially needed to test pan-cultural evolutionary predictions. The results\nCreativity and aggression as ornament and armament\nshowed that, similar to other male animals, men both show off using conspicuous social\nornaments (e.g., creativity) to appeal to potential mates, and arm themselves using aggression\nto compete with male suitors.\nReferences\nAndersson, M.
