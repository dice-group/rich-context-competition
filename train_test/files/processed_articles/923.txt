These hospitals comprise a stratified prob-\nability sample of all US hospitals with emergency departments. The National Vital Statistics System\n(NVSS) is a complete census of all death certificates filed by states and is compiled annually.\nMethods: National data on BB/pellet gun related injuries and injury rates were examined along with\nfatal and non-fatal firearm related injuries and injury rates. Non-fatal injury data for all BB/pellet gun\n1999 were obtained from hospital emergency department records using the NEISS. Firearm related\nResults: BB/pellet gun related injury rates increased from age 3 years to a peak at age 13 years and\ndeclined thereafter. In contrast, firearm related injury and death rates increased gradually until age 13\nand then increased sharply until age 18 years. For persons aged 19 years and younger, BB/pellet gun\ntrend was similar to those for fatal and non-fatal firearm related injury rates per 100 000 which were\nrelated injuries among persons aged 19 years and younger were treated in US hospital emergency\ndepartments.\nConclusions: BB/pellet gun related and firearm related injury rates show similar declines since the\nearly 1990s. These declines coincide with a growing number of prevention efforts aimed at reducing\ninjuries to children from unsupervised access to guns and from youth violence. Evaluations at the state\nand local level are needed to determine true associations.\nBB and pellet gun related injuries represent an important\npublic health concern in the US,especially for children and\nteenagers. A previous study reported that children and\nteenagers account for about 80% of all non-fatal BB/pellet gun\naged 19 years or younger were treated annually for non-fatal\nBB/pellet gun related injuries in US hospital emergency\ndepartments.2 Although a majority of these injuries in children\nand teenagers resulted from unintentional shootings, at least\n10% of them were from interpersonal or self directed\nviolence.2 This is in contrast to fatal and non-fatal firearm\nrelated injuries which are predominantly violence related.3 4\nAn estimated 3.2 million BB/pellet guns are sold in the US\neach year. Eighty per cent of these guns have muzzle velocities\ngreater than 350 feet per second (fps) and 50% have velocities\nfired from these air powered guns, especially those with\nvelocities >350 fps, can cause tissue damage similar to that\ninflicted by powder charged bullets fired from small caliber\nhandguns.6 Numerous studies have documented the poten-\ntially severe or lethal nature of penetrating injuries from\nBB/pellet gunshots, especially those to the abdomen, chest,\neye, and head of children. These studies indicate that\nunsupervised access to these guns by children is a major risk\nfactor for injury.5 7\u00ad10 To reduce the risk of disability and death\nof patients inflicted with such wounds, some hospitals and\ndoctors have modified their trauma care protocols to account\nfor potentially severe, penetrating injuries from these com-\nThis study presents nationally representative data on trends\nin non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injury rates for persons aged\n19 years and younger and compares these trends with national\ntrends in fatal and non-fatal firearm related injury rates.\nNational data are used to examine trends in gun related injury\nthese injuries by age, sex, race/ethnicity, intent of injury, and\ndisposition at emergency department discharge.

Data from 1985\nthrough 1992 on BB/pellet gun injuries were collected as part of\nCPSC's routine surveillance of consumer product related injuries\nBB/pellet gun related injuries and non-fatal firearm related inju-\nries were collected through a \"special study\" using NEISS.14 This\nspecial study was implemented through an interagency agree-\nment between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nand CPSC to collect more detailed information about the\ncircumstances of all gun related injury incidents.14\nA BB/pellet gun related injury was defined as a gunshot\nwound from a pistol or rifle that uses compressed air to fire a\nmetal BB or pellet. These guns can operate through a spring or\npump action mechanism or a carbon dioxide cartridge.15 A fire-\narm related injury was defined as a gunshot wound from a pis-\ntol, revolver, or rifle that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile.\nThe NEISS is comprised of approximately 100 hospitals\nselected as a stratified probability sample of the approximately\n5000 hospitals with emergency departments located through-\nout the US.16 17 The system includes very large inner city hospi-\ntals with trauma centers, as well as urban, suburban, rural, and\nchildren's hospitals. Data obtained from these NEISS hospitals\nwere weighted by the inverse of the probability of selection to\nprovide national estimates of injuries treated in hospital emer-\ngency departments in the US and its territories.17 NEISS on-site\npersonnel at each hospital were trained to identify all gun\nrelated cases treated in the emergency department by reviewing\nemergency department logs, trauma registries (when avail-\nable), and emergency department charts. Based on information\nwritten in the medical record, on-site personnel classified gun\nrelated injuries by type of weapon (BB/pellet gun or firearm).\ncoders abstracted information from the medical record on age\nand sex of the patient, nature of the injury, primary body part\ninjured, disposition at discharge from the emergency depart-\nment. For each special study gun related case treated from 1993\nthrough 1999, coders abstracted those routine NEISS variables\nplus race/ethnicity of the patient, method of transport to the\nemergency department, type of firearm used, victim-offender\nrelationship, intent of injury (for example, unintentional,\nsuspected and confirmed assault, suspected and confirmed sui-\ncide attempt, law enforcement related), and other selected fac-\ntors. A narrative taken verbatim from the medical record was\nalso captured to provide more details about the injury\ncircumstances. Further details of the system, abstraction meth-\nods, and evaluations of case ascertainment and completeness\nand accuracy of coding are provided elsewhere.18\u00ad20\nIn 1997, the sampling frame of NEISS was updated and a\nstratum was added for children's hospitals increasing the\nmonth overlap in 1997, gunshot cases were collected from\nboth the old and new NEISS samples. Analysis of the\nweighted data indicated that differences in national estimates\nof non-fatal firearm related injuries based on these two sam-\nples were minimal (that is, <1%). However, differences in\nnational estimates of non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries\nwere relatively high (that is, <15%) and depended on age. To\naccount for this, a SAS program developed by CPSC was used\nto calculate ratios for adjusting both firearm related and\nBB/pellet gun related injuries. These ratios were then applied\nto sample weights for NEISS cases before 1997 to ensure com-\nparability of national estimates over time.\nIn cases before 1993, there was no way of distinguishing\nnon-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries associated with\ngunshot wounds from those induced by other causes (for\nexample, lacerating or pinching finger on trigger after a fall).\nwere determined to be non-gunshot wounds. Accordingly,\nrates calculated for the earlier years were adjusted downward\nby 4% to account for non-gunshot wound cases.\nRace and ethnicity data for persons treated for non-fatal\ngun related injuries were obtained from NEISS hospital emer-\ngency department records. The majority of cases were reported\nas either white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian*.\nThose reported as black Hispanic were classified as black, and\nthose reported as any other race and Hispanic were classified\nas Hispanic.3 Because of the small numbers of cases,\nTable 1 Number of BB/pellet gun related injuries and firearm related injuries and deaths, and rates per 100000\npopulation for persons aged 19 years and younger, by selected characteristics of the injured person, United States,\nCharacteristics\nNon-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries* Non-fatal firearm related injuries* Firearm related deaths\nNo\nMean\nannual\nMean\nannual\nMean\nannual\nAge (in years)\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\n*National estimates of non-fatal gunshot injuries treated in hospital emergency departments.\nThere were six cases of unknown sex for BB/pellet gun related injuries.\nExcludes those who were of Hispanic origin.\n\u00a7Excludes black Hispanic.\n\u00b6Includes non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, and unknown race.\n**Estimate may be unstable because the coefficient of variation was >30%.\nData sources: National Vital Statistics System, National Center for Health Statistics for deaths; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Firearm Injury\nSurveillance Study for non-fatal injuries; US Census Bureau for population estimates.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n*Frequently, only one entry on the emergency department record is\navailable for either race or identity, not for both.

This similarity is intriguing\nand could be potentially the result of legislative and\neducational efforts to prevent unsupervised access to guns by\nchildren. More research is needed to investigate the potential\nrole of these efforts in explaining the decline in BB/pellet gun\nrelated injury rates. Most BB/pellet gun related injuries\noccurred among younger males, were unintentional shoot-\nings, and were either self inflicted or inflicted by a relative or\nfriend.2 Public awareness and concern about this issue has\nincreased since the early 1990s, as evidenced by increased leg-\nislation. In 1981, a survey by CPSC found that 12 states had\nlaws that restricted possession or use of BB/pellet guns by\nminors and furnishing or selling these guns to children.27\nAccording to a search using LexisNexis (Reed Elsevier, Inc,\nDayton, Ohio), a database that provides full text access to state\nlaws pertaining to firearms, that number increased to 14 states\nEleven states now have laws that define BB/pellet guns as\neither firearms or dangerous weapons.28 Nineteen states have\nenacted laws that hold parents or guardians legally responsi-\nble for injuries or deaths resulting from minors using their\nfirearms and 10 states have laws requiring parents or\nguardians to protect minors by properly storing their\nfirearms.28 Safe storage laws intended to make firearms less\naccessible to children have been linked to a 23% reduction in\nunintentional shooting deaths of children aged 15 years or\nyounger.29 Also, the number of unintentional firearm related\ninjury deaths for children aged 19 years and younger in the US\nAnother factor that might have contributed to the recent\ndecline in BB/pellet gun related injury rates is the increase in\nprevention programs aimed at reducing gun violence among\nchildren and youth. Although BB/pellet gun related injuries\nwere mostly unintentional, about 13% of BB/pellet gun related\ninjuries among persons aged 15\u00ad19 years were assaults. Fatal\nand non-fatal firearm related injuries are predominantly vio-\nlence related. Since the early 1990s firearm related injury and\ndeath rates have declined substantially in the US.3 Efforts\nsupported by public health, criminal justice, and educational\nagencies and organizations may have contributed to the\ndecline in BB/pellet gun related injuries, especially those asso-\nciated with interpersonal violence. These efforts promote the\nadoption of youth violence prevention programs shown to be\neffective in reducing violent behavior and associated injuries\nand target parents, children, and teenagers.31 32 In the year\nparticipated in programs to prevent bullying and 46.4% of all\nschools participated in a program in which family or commu-\nnity members serve as role models or mentor students, such as\nthe Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Most schools (96.1%)\nalso have a policy that prohibits student weapon possession or\nuse.33 Prevention messages aimed specifically at reducing fire-\narm related injuries among children have focused on increas-\ning parent/guardian awareness of the increased risk of injury\nassociated with unsupervised access to firearms, promoting\nsafe gun storage and practices for gun owners and users, and\neducating policy makers about those at risk of injury.\nLimitations of our data exist because our national estimates\nof non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries include only those\nthat were treated in hospital emergency departments.\nBB/pellet gun related injuries that were not medically treated\nor were treated in outpatient clinics or doctors' offices were not\nincluded. We could not examine trends in BB/pellet gun\nrelated injuries treated in these outpatient settings because no\nnational data exist. NEISS provides nationally representative\nestimates, but does not accommodate state or local estimates.\nAdditionally, NEISS is a probability sample of US hospitals\nand estimates are subject to sampling error. Nevertheless, the\ncoefficients of variation for national estimates of BB/pellet gun\nrelated injuries have remained relatively small, approximately\n7% overall for persons aged 19 years and younger, and have\nbeen stable over time. Also, adjustments were made for a\nNEISS sampling frame change that occurred in 1997 so that\nour trend analyses would be statistically valid.17 Trend analysis\nwith or without these statistical adjustments lead to similar\nconclusions for this study.\nPrevention efforts have focused on informing gun owners that\nBB/pellet guns can be dangerous, even lethal, and need to be\nproperly stored, locked and unloaded, so that children will not\nbe tempted to play with them or use them without adult\nsupervision.34 These prevention messages remind parents or\nguardians about their role in ensuring the safety of their chil-\ndren around guns. Parents or guardians should also be\ninformed that injuries can occur to their children at a friend's\nhome where a loaded, BB/pellet gun may be readily available.8\nParents need to take steps to ensure that their children, espe-\ncially boys, are not exposed to BB/pellet guns in various places\nthat they go and play. Boys have been found to choose\nhandling a gun, if they find one, regardless of their parents'\nbeliefs about their children's perceived interest in guns.35\nOur study suggests that growing prevention efforts aimed\nat reducing unsupervised access to guns by children and\nreducing youth violence coincide with the decline in national\nBB/pellet gun related injury rates and firearm related injury\nand death rates in the US. A carefully designed evaluation at\nthe state and local levels of prevention efforts aimed at reduc-\ning both BB/pellet gun related and firearm related injuries is\nwarranted. These prevention efforts should be combined with\nother efforts, such as improving the design and safety features\nof guns; increasing the number of states with laws that restrict\nunsupervised access to powder and non-powder guns by\nminors; using stricter sentencing guidelines for crimes\ncommitted with guns36; and improving law enforcement\npractices.36 Together, these efforts could potentially help to\nreduce the risk of gun related injuries and improve the safety\nof our children.\nKey points\n\u00b7 Tracking BB/pellet gun and firearm related injury rates\nsimultaneously can be an informative injury surveillance\ntool.\n\u00b7 For persons aged 19 years and younger, non-fatal\nBB/pellet gun related injuries have been declining along\nwith fatal and non-fatal firearm related injuries from the\n\u00b7 Prevention efforts aimed at reducing unsupervised access to\nguns by children and reducing youth violence coincide with\ndeclines in BB/pellet gun related injury rates and firearm\nrelated injury and death rates for persons aged 19 years\nand younger in the US.\n\u00b7 A carefully designed evaluation of the effectiveness of pre-\nvention efforts in reducing both BB/pellet gun and firearm\nrelated injuries at the state and local levels is warranted.\n\u00b7 Prevention messages should continue to remind parents and\nguardians that BB/pellet guns are not harmless toys. Not\nonly can their children hurt themselves seriously from\nimproper use of these guns, but they may also inflict injuries\non others.\n\u00b7 Prevention efforts, including legislation and law enforce-\nment, education, programs, and improved gun safety\ndesign, working collectively could potentially help to reduce\nthe risk of gun related injuries and improve the safety of our\nchildren.\n190 Nguyen, Annest, Mercy, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\n"
