For\nexample, OSAHS affects cardiac function\nand output in many ways, and is associated\nwith hypertension,1 pulmonary hyperten-\nsion,2 vascular endothelial injury, tissue\nischaemia,3 systolic and diastolic dysfunc-\ntion, and arrhythmias.4,5 OSAHS is closely\nrelated to the incidence and mortality of\ncardiovascular disease, especially in the eld-\nerly population.6,7 As the symptoms of\nOSAHS are not very specific and the devel-\nopment complications is usually occult and\ngradual, many patients do not get an accur-\nate clinical assessment and guided treat-\nment. Consequently, their primary diseases\nand complications are aggravated and,\nultimately, change from functional disorders\nto organic diseases.8 For that reason, the\nearly detection, diagnosis, treatment and\nprevention of the complications associated\nwith OSAHS are clinically important goals.9\nAs a result of its rapid development, non-\ninvasive approach, standardized procedure\nand repeatability features, echocardiog-\nraphy has been widely used in the clinical\nevaluation of cardiac structure and func-\ntional changes. It thus makes the early\ndetection of OSAHS and the relevant car-\ndiac diseases possible.10\nThe purpose of this present study was to\ninvestigate cardiac structural changes in\npatients with OSAHS and to determine the\nimpact that OSAHS has on left ventricular\nsystolic and diastolic function.\nPatients and methods\nParticipants\nThis prospective study enrolled consecutive\npatients with OSAHS who visited the\nKey Laboratory of Otorhinolaryngology of\nthe Health Ministry, Department of\nOtorhinolaryngology, Qilu Hospital,\nShandong University, Jinan, Shandong\nwere diagnosed following a 32-lead\ntwin polysomnography (PSG) assessment\n(Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA). The\napnoea\u00adhypopnoea index (AHI) was defined\nas the total number of apnoea and hypop-\nnoea episodes per hour of sleep.11 AHI and\nlowest oxygen saturation were recorded\nduring PSG monitoring as described below.\nOSAHS was defined as an AHI !5 obstruct-\nive events per hour of sleep.12 Patients with\nOSAHS did not receive any specific treat-\nment for OSAHS prior to inclusion in the\nstudy. Exclusion criteria included coronary\nheart disease, hypertension, obstructive pul-\nmonary disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe control group consisted of healthy\nsubjects selected from patients who visited\nthe Cardiovascular Colour Ultrasound\nCentre at Qilu Hospital for physical exam-\nination. The control subjects did not have\nOSAHS, as confirmed by PSG assessment.\nThe control subjects also had no history of\nhypertension, snoring, sleep apnoea or day-\ntime sleepiness. Relatives of the healthy\ncontrol subjects also provided confirmation\nthat the control subjects did not snore or\nhave sleep apnoea. As for the patient group,\ncontrol subjects with type 2 diabetes,\ncoronary heart disease, hypertension or\nobstructive pulmonary disease were\nexcluded. In addition to routine clinical\nand laboratory examinations, all study par-\nticipants completed the Epworth Sleepiness\nScale (ESS), which scores the likelihood of\ndozing in eight situations (0, no likelihood;\n1, slight likelihood; 2, moderate likelihood;\n3, high likelihood), giving a maximum score\nof 24.13 The age, weight, height and body\nmass index (BMI) of all study participants\nwere recorded.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics\nVerbal informed consent was obtained from\nall study participants.\nPolysomnography assessment of sleep\napnoea\nA 32-lead twin PSG monitor (Respironics)\nwas used to measure various physiological\nfunctions during the stages of sleep in\npatients with OSAHS and the control sub-\njects. Polysmith sleep analysis software ver-\nsion 10.0 (Neurotronics, Gainesville, FL,\nUSA) was used to monitor 10 indicators,\nincluding electroencephalogram, subman-\ndibular electromyography, eye movement\nelectronystagmogram, muzzle airflow, chest\nand abdominal movement, oxygen satur-\nation, electrocardiogram, leg movements,\nbody position and snoring. Sleep stages\nwere scored in 30-s epochs using standard\ncriteria. Apnoea was defined as the absence\ndefined as a significant reduction in airflow\n(>50%) for !10 s or a moderate reduction in\nairflow for !10 s together with an arousal or\noxygen desaturation (!4%).15 The muzzle\nairflow was monitored by the triple therm-\nometer; chest and abdominal movement was\nmonitored by the thoracic/abdominal strain\ngauge; oxygen saturation was monitored by\nthe pulse oximeter; and posture was moni-\ntored by a sleep position indicator sensor\n(Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).\nEchocardiography\nEchocardiography was conducted using GE\nVivid 7 ultrasound diagnostic apparatus\n(GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway,\nNJ, USA), which includes both a tissue\nDoppler imaging (TDI) system and trad-\nitional ultrasound functions, and can auto-\nmatically record each set of test results. The\nparticipants were in the left lateral decubitus\nposition when their cardiac structures were\nconventional transthoracic echocardiog-\nraphy (M-mode, two dimension, colour\nDoppler) as previously described.16 The\nmain indicators included left ventricular\ndiastolic diameter (LV), left atrium diastolic\ndiameter (LA), right ventricular diastolic\ndiameter (RV), right atrium diastolic diam-\neter, arteriae aorta diameter (AO), pulmon-\nary artery diameter, interventricular septum\n(IVS), left ventricle posterior wall (LVPW)\nand body surface area (BSA). The Devereux\nformula was used to calculate the left ven-\nventricular mass index (LVMI) \u00bc LVM/\nIn order to conduct the measurements\neffectively, the system was switched to the\nTDI speed mode, the filter was set to the\nminimum, and the Doppler gain was\nreduced appropriately. The sample volume\nwas placed on the cross of the anterior\nmitral valve annulus to measure the mitral\nannulus; on the IVS muscular segment to\nmeasure IVS; and on the papillary muscle\nshort axis to measure LVPW. The systolic\nmyocardial peak velocity (Sm), early dia-\nstolic myocardial peak velocity (Em) and\nlate diastolic myocardial peak velocity (Am)\nwere measured separately. All of the images\nof mitral early diastolic velocity (E), mitral\nlate diastolic in velocity (A), cardiac output\n(CO), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF),\nleft ventricular shortening fraction (FS) and\nstroke volume (SV) were recorded and\nstored. Once recorded, off-line analyses\nwere conducted to calculate the mean\nvalues for three continuous cardiac cycles.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 11.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data are presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD. The mean values of the two\ngroups were compared using Student's t-\ntest. The correlations between BMI and the\nmain echocardiography indicators were cal-\nculated using Spearman's correlation coeffi-\ncient because OSAHS is related to\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 136 patients with OSAHS were\ndiagnosed following a PSG assessment (89\nyears; range 50\u00ad82 years).

The clinic\nSBP and DBP of OSAHS group were higher\nthan those of the controls. All of the echo-\ncardiographic indicators of the cardiac\nstructure were significantly greater in the\nOSAHS group compared with the control\ngroup (P < 0.05 for each indicator).\nThe Em and Am of the IVS, mitral\nannulus and LVPW were compared to\ndetermine the diastolic function of the left\nventricle. The main indicators of the left\nventricular diastolic function are shown in\nTable 2. The differences between the two\ngroups regarding the Em/Am, IVS Em/Am,\nmitral annulus Em/Am, and LVPW Em/Am\nwere all statistically significant (P < 0.05 for\neach indicator).\nTo compare the left ventricular systolic\nfunction between the two groups, CO, SV,\nEF, FS and IVS Sm, mitral annulus Sm and\nLVPW Sm were measured (Table 3). CO\nand SV showed no significant differences\nbetween the OSAHS group and the control\ngroup. However, EF, FS, IVS Sm, mitral\nannulus Sm and LVPW Sm showed signifi-\ncant differences between the two groups\n(P < 0.05 for each indicator).\nThere was no significant difference in the\nBMI between the OSAHS and control\ngroups. In terms of the cardiac structure,\nthe BMI of patients with OSAHS was\nsignificantly related to the LV (r \u00bc 0.40,\nP \u00bc 0.023). The BMI of the control subjects\nwas significantly related only to RV\nP \u00bc 0.041).

In terms of the left ventricular dia-\nstolic and systolic function, the AHI of\npatients with OSAHS was significantly\nThe AHI of control subjects was not signifi-\ncantly related to left ventricular diastolic\nand systolic function.\nDiscussion\nThree physiological mechanisms associated\nwith OSAHS are generally considered to\ncause left ventricular hypertrophy: (i) the\nincreased haemodynamic load that results\nfrom the increased blood pressure that is\noften observed in patients with OSAHS,\nwhich rises continually and does not drop\ndown at night, causing the left ventricle to\nTable 1.

First,\nendothelin has powerful vasoconstrictor\neffects.24 Endothelin induces the prolifer-\nation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth\nmuscle cells, narrows the vascular lumen,\nthickens the vascular wall and increases\nperipheral resistance, which results in an\nincrease in the cardiac afterload.24 Secondly,\nendothelin increases mitosis in cardiomyo-\ncytes and fibroblasts, thus causing cell pro-\nliferation, intracellular calcium overload\nand proto-oncogene expression, which pro-\nmotes DNA and protein synthesis, and in\nturn eventually increases cardiac hypertro-\nphy.24 Thirdly, endothelin and angiotensin\nII promote the expression of each other's\nencoding gene in a positive feedback\nmanner.25,26 This present study found sig-\nnificant differences in IVS, LVPW, LVM\nand LVMI between the OSAHS group and\nthe control group.\nWhen a patient with OSAHS is in\napnoea, the formation of an extreme\nintrathoracic negative pressure causes rapid\nchanges in the ventricular transmural pres-\nsure, which results in an increased myocar-\ndial wall pressure and afterload.27 In\naddition, the apnoea causes hypoxaemia\nand hypercapnia, which lead to pulmonary\nvasoconstriction, pulmonary pressure and\nincreased right ventricular afterload.27\nWhen coupled with the increased intrathor-\nacic pressure and returned blood volume,\nthe right ventricular volume is overloaded\nand becomes an easy trigger for right heart\nfailure.28,29 Moreover, as a result of the\nventricular interdependence mechanism, the\nIVS shifts to the left, which reduces the\ncompliance, capacity and pump output of\nthe left ventricle.30 As a result of the\nendothelium-dependent diastolic dysfunc-\ntion, large amounts of endothelin and cat-\necholamine are generated, and this results in\nincreased blood pressure during sleep and\ndaytime hypertension.31 This increase in\nblood pressure increases cardiac load and\nLVMI, and causes ventricular hypertrophy,\ncardiac remodelling and structural abnorm-\nalities.32 All of these physiological changes\ninevitably lead to myocardial systolic and\nTissue Doppler imaging technology has\nbeen used to examine right ventricular func-\ntion in patients with OSAHS, and it was\nfound that patients with OSAHS had differ-\nent degrees of right ventricular dysfunction\nregardless of whether they had concomitant\nhypertension or not.35,36 The TDI myocar-\ndial performance indicator is one of the\nmost important indicators that reflect the\nrelationship between the degree of OSAHS\nand right ventricular subclinical dysfunc-\ntion.35,36 The study conducted by Ferrier\net al.37 in patients with OSAHS and left\nventricular dysfunction showed that, after\ntreatment, the LVEF returned to a normal\nvalue, suggesting that OSAHS may cause\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction during\nthe daytime. Therefore, improving sleep\napnoea can improve left ventricular systolic\nfunction. The present study also found that\nelderly patients with OSAHS showed sig-\nnificant left ventricular diastolic dysfunc-\ntion. The mitral inflow Em/Am was\nsignificantly different between the OSAHS\ngroup and the control group; so were the\nmitral annulus Em, mitral annulus Em/Am,\nIVS Em, IVS Am and IVS Em/Am. These\nfindings suggested that OSAHS might cause\nhaemodynamic changes, increase afterload\nand thicken the LVPW.\nThis present study found that there were\nno significant differences between the two\nindicators of left ventricular systolic func-\ntion, CO and SV in OSAHS group and the\ncontrol group. However, there were statis-\ntically significant differences for the indica-\ntors FS and EF had between the two groups,\nas well as for IVS Sm, mitral annulus Sm\nand LVPW Sm. These findings indicated\nthat the myocardial systolic function of the\npatients with OSAHS was significantly\nimpaired. This finding was consistent\nwith that of a previous study that used\nmultigated radionuclide ventriculography to\nObesity has been linked to specific car-\ndiovascular outcomes such as hypertension,\nstroke, myocardial ischaemia and arrhyth-\nmias, and it is also related to OSAHS.39 The\nrelationship between obesity, OSAHS and\nheart disease has become an important area\nof research. Animal research suggests that\nforced inspiration-induced acute LA disten-\nsion related to diastolic dysfunction may be\nan important component of the arrhythmo-\ngenic substrate for atrial fibrillation during\nsleep apnoea episodes in obese patients.40 In\nthe diseased cardiac patient, the severity of\nobstructive sleep apnoea was associated\nwith an increased risk of death and risk\nstratification based on obstructive sleep\napnoea severity was shown to be relevant.41\nIn this present study, obesity, as determined\nby the BMI, in patients with OSAHS was\nassociated with more damage to the cardiac\nstructure and left ventricular diastolic and\nsystolic dysfunction than was observed in\nthe control patients with similar levels of\nobesity.\nThere are some limitations to this study.\nBecause of insufficient follow-up time, we\nwere not able to observe the effects of long-\nterm continuous positive airway pressure\ntherapy or surgical treatment on cardiac\nstructure and function in patients with\nOSAHS. Future studies should focus\non this.\nIn conclusion, this present study demon-\nstrated that the cardiac structure was altered\nin elderly patients with OSAHS, which was\ncharacterized by concentric hypertrophy,\nwhile their left ventricular diastolic and sys-\ntolic functions were significantly diminished\ncompared with control subjects. Obesity\nappeared to participate in the damage to\nthe cardiac structure and left ventricular\ndiastolic and systolic dysfunction in patients\nwith OSAHS. Echocardiography, especially\nTDI technology, might make the early\ndiagnosis of OSAHS in elderly patients\npossible, which should help in the preven-\ntion of future pathological changes to the\nheart.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\nScience Foundation of Shandong Province,\nReferences\n1.
