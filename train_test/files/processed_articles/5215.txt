Safety and security are very important in\nthe hospitality industry. UNWTO (2012) argued that the\ngrowth by region was 10% in South America and 6% in\nEurope, which is explained by the stable economy in Europe\nand the relapse in North Africa and the Middle East. The pur-\npose of this study is to explore the existing literature about\nemergency preparedness for disasters and crisis affecting the\nhotel industry, and how we can mitigate the effects of such\nhazards. This will shed the light to plan for the next hazard-\nous events.\nIn this regard, many researchers argued that safety and\nsecurity are most important to tourist while traveling and the\nfirst aspect they consider (Pizam, Tarlow, & Bloom, 1997;\nmentioned that being protected from hazards is the most\nimportant issue for the tourists as hotel customers. Crimes\nagainst hotels and its guests will happen when there is any\nopportunity or gap in the hotel (Lisante, 1972). Hospitality\ncannot develop in destinations with hazards (Reisinger &\nMavondo, 2005). Countries with crime notoriety will strug-\ngle to retain their tourists (Prideaux, 1996).\nThe history and progression of emergency management is\nvery important to understand (Haddow & Bullock, 2006).\nEmergency management has existed since ancient times as\nhas been shown by the ancient hieroglyphics demonstrating\nhow the old cave-man dealt with disasters, and later how the\nnext generations tried to cope with disasters preparing for\nthem before they occurred.\nThe emergency management definition could be diversi-\nfied regarding event response, style of management, and\nwillingness from stakeholders. Haddow and Bullock (2006)\ndefined emergency management as dealing with hazards\ntimely and taking action to avoid hazards. Practitioners men-\ntioned safety measures like closed circuit TV (CCTV),\n1Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Penang, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nAhmad Rasmi AlBattat, School of Housing, Building and Planning,\nUniversiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, 11800, Malaysia.\nEmail: battat_ahmed@yahoo.com\nEmergency Preparedness for Disasters\nand Crises in the Hotel Industry\nAhmad Rasmi AlBattat1 and Ahmad Puad Mat Som1\n Keywords\nsafety, security, hotel, hazard, emergency\n2 SAGE Open\npassport photo ID checks, guards, emergency generators, fire\nprotection, emergency plan, and emergency lights (Bach &\nResearchers such as Lois, Wang, Wall, and Ruxton (2004)\nclarified the guests need for a printed multilingual emer-\ngency form providing guidance and evacuation procedures.\nPlanning is the most significant component to dealing with a\nCoyne (2011) asserted that disasters could create shaki-\nness and menace the security and safety of any community.\nNatural or human-made unexpected phenomena, disasters\ncan take place in any region (Haddow & Bullock, 2006).\nFaulkner (2001) noticed a rising number of natural and man-\nmade crises that harm the hospitality industry. Scholars\nnoticed a series of crises and disasters such as 9/11 (Prideaux,\nin Southern China and Hong Kong (S. Kim, Chun, & Lee,\nevents can cause insecurity and future uncertainty (Malhotra\n& Venkatesh, 2009). Moreover, they can directly impact the\nnumber of tourist (Mendoza, Brida, & Garrido, 2012).\nThe hospitality industry is one of the most vulnerable to\ncrisis and can be affected by internal and external hazards\nstudy the impact of the crisis on different sectors within the\nhospitality industry such as restaurants (Green, Bartholomew,\ndisasters cannot be stopped, but they can be mitigated, and\nlives and property can be saved (Ritchie, 2004).\nLiterature Review\nEmergency Management Preparedness\nFink (1986) clarified that efficient planning has a sufficient\nrole in emergency management. He asserted that planning for\nemergencies is very important to control the existing event. In\naddition, it is a technique to avoid hazards such as hotel fires,\nand demonstrates the intention to recognize the crisis warning\nsignals. Hotels have been categorized as high-risk buildings,\nespecially for fires, because of the presence of highly flam-\nmable materials and the chance of pervasion of smoke and\nfire to the rest of the building or even to neighboring\nabout improving knowledge that allows the practitioners to\nunderstand hotel fire characteristics, while Ellis (1981) clari-\nfied the employees'need to receive sufficient training on how\nto deal with fires and miscellaneous hazards.\nFurness and Muckett (2007) indicated that the concentra-\ntion of guests in a specific area could slow the escaping\ncapacity near exits, which could increase the injuries in case\nof emergencies. And it is important to note the amount of\nflammable materials that could turn into suitable fuel for a\nfire (Goodson & Murnane, 2008). Furthermore, the hotel\ndesign of placing the guest rooms in the highest floors, while\nthe high-risk facilities are placed in the lower floors, is a\nrisky plan that may close the escape exits in case of emergen-\nInformation technology (IT) has recently been involved\nwith all hotel operations: front office, reservation, restau-\nrants, accounting, housekeeping, and wireless networks in\nthe guest rooms and public areas in the hotel (Choice, 2000;\nZhang and Paxson (2000) asserted that IT could open a back\ndoor for threats to customers by using unauthorized access to\nthe hotel and guests' data, which demonstrates the necessity\nof an efficient computer security system. A hotel may secure\nits information and protect it from prohibited usage (H. Kim,\nLee, & Ham, 2012). This insures the software and hardware\nsecurity works continuously without information interrup-\nFurthermore, the potential usage of biometric technolo-\ngies in the hospitality industry could reinforce the hotel ser-\nvices by ensuring security, maintain customer relations by\nreducing the cost, and improve the effectiveness of hotel\nsecurity operations. Moreover, biometric technologies could\nbe used for physical access, computers passwords, and rec-\nognition of terrorists and criminals (Meyers & Mills, 2005).\nHotels may have to cooperate with the intelligence and police\nagencies to prevent crimes and terrorist activities (Bach &\nrobbery by guests and employees as well as the misuse of\nTourism, as an international mobile industry, has a great\nrole in the disease movement (Barker et al., 2006; Budd, Bell,\nfrom one tourist destination to another (Sharpley & Craven,\nfew weeks SARS prevailed in more than 30 countries, caus-\ning the death of approximately 900 people, and more than\nTerrorism also has a great impact on hospitality and the\ntourism industry. Great changes are occurring in the world\nvision toward safety and security, with a high effect on the\nglobal economy and flight cancellations, which cause a low\noccupancy rate and decrease in the arrivals (Chan & Lam,\nAlBattat and Mat Som 3\ndropped by half with at least US$2 billion losses after\nSeptember 11. Further safety and security awareness should\ngive the guests a clearer idea about flexibility actions taken in\ncase of emergency. This means that the higher the safety plan,\nthe higher safety improvement by the hotel. Furthermore,\nhotels may market their safety to increase awareness and pro-\nmote their hotels as well the destinations to the guests and\nholiday advisors (Graham & Roberts, 2000).\nPlanning for emergencies should consider several internal\nfactors such as collaboration, communication, and control.\nBut the most important internal factor is the management's\ncommitment to adopt and develop an emergency manage-\nment plan, which will be a strong guidance and updated mes-\nsage to communicate before, during, and after the crisis\nzations are more likely to have an emergency plan than\nsmaller ones, depending on the size and their financial situa-\ntion. Furthermore, Caponigro clarified that with limited\nresources, crisis planning is less important for small organi-\nzations, as they think that crisis will not affect them, or they\nwill manage their business without a plan. Some practitio-\nners explained that the organizations that faced a disaster\nbefore will be more likely to invest in and develop their own\nemergency plan, because they suffer from the previous haz-\nards and learn from its effect on the properties and human\nStakeholders and managers should be aware of the impor-\ntance of updating an emergency plan and full detailed infor-\nmation about their hotels, its services, and safety and security\nprocedures adopted in the case of vulnerability. Della-\nGiustina (2003) explained three steps essential in emergency\nplanning: to recognize existing risks, to develop an updated\nemergency plan, and finally to assure the organization's pre-\nparedness for the emergencies. The plan also should contain\nthe use, maintenance, and upgrading for the security and\nMany studies have examined how the tourist destination's\nimage, safety, and security affect the tourist destination\nchoice, as tourists search for a safe place away from natural\nand man-made disasters (Carter, 1998; Floyd, Gibson,\nPennington-Gray, & Thapa, 2004; Kozak, Crotts, & Law,\nunfortunately, a very few studies were undertaken to exam-\nine the planning and preparedness for the emergency man-\nagement issues in the hospitality industry (Ritchie, 2008).\nSo, this article will explain how hospitality industry can be\nprepared for the next hazards and lessons to mitigate the\neffect of such hazardous events on the hotels.\nHotel Safety and Security\nTerrorist activities can cause a negative impact on the hotel\nsector and decrease the number of arrivals in a destination\n(Stafford, Yu, & Armoo, 2006). Hotels have a long history of\nbeing soft targets for terrorist attacks, with terrorists using\nthemselves or a bombed car to attack these hotels (Singh\net al., 2004) because they have weaker security measures\ncompared with governmental or military facilities.\nFurthermore, hotels are targets for their brand names, loca-\ntion, and the media coverage produced by attacking them\n(Stipanuck, American Hotel, & Lodging Educational\nInstitute, 2006). During the last decade, several accidents\nhave shaken the hotel industry, for instance, the bombing of\na car at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2003 killed 13 people\nrorist attack on the Jordanian hotel industry took place when\nterrorists bombed three hotels classified as five and four stars\nhotels--the Radisson SAS, Hayat Amman, and Days Inn\nhotels--killing 67 people and injuring more than 150 people\n(Weimann, 2006). With a question of attacking the hotels\nregardless of its location, ownership, and nationality, this\nemphasizes that hotels should upgrade their security proce-\ndures to make them harder targets against terrorist activities\nSafety and security are essential for the hotels in prevent-\ning death and injury for guests and employees, with multiple\nforms of hazards such as falls, cuts, slips, burns, and related\naccidents (Enz & Taylor, 2002). To improve safety and secu-\nrity, hotels installed CCTV, fire sprinklers, smoke detectors,\nand electronic doors (Pizam, 2010). Security personnel have\nthe responsibility to insure the safety of the hotel, guests,\nemployees, and assets. In this regard, human resources\nshould attract and recruit professional security officers with\ngood experience for this mission. Employees in general, and\nsecurity officers specifically, should attend training work-\nshops on governmental regulations and first-aid. Moreover,\nthey should receive fire and emergency evacuation training\nto deal effectively with hazards (Henderson, Shufen, Huifen,\nbeen increased by the hotels to invest more in the front area,\ninstalling heavy-duty equipment (Howie, 2005). To tackle\nblackout situations, hotels enhance power systems and emer-\nAcademic practitioners began to fathom the safety and\nsecurity research in the hospitality and tourism industry in\ncriminals by studying 300 cases at worldwide tourism desti-\nnations. He analyses the effectiveness of tourism models\nfrom different aspects, especially tourism demand, and iden-\ntifies the duties for different parties in the stage of prevention\nand recovery. Other hospitality practitioners investigate the\nrole of safety and security managers in the hospitality indus-\ntry. Gill, Moon, Seaman, and Turbin (2002) studied this role\nin the U.K. hotels, where they found that security managers\nhave a conventional responsibility guarding the hotels in dif-\nferent aspects including safety, health, IT security, fire safety,\ninsurance, and loss prevention. In contrast, Pizam (2010)\nargued that hotels still did not upgrade their security levels.\nHis study found that 30% of U.S. hotel general managers did\n4 SAGE Open\nnot upgrade their security systems. Some managers argued\nthat they were satisfied with the system efficiency (Enz,\n2003). Other managers did not do any upgrading to their sys-\ntems because they were convinced that the crisis would not\nhappen to them. Furthermore, this improvement will not\ngenerate extra revenue for them (Shellum, 2003).\nThis study proposes a theoretical framework (Figure 1)\nfrom the literature adopted from Faulkner's (2001) disaster\nmanagement framework, and the implementation of the same\nwhich proposed that disaster responses could be categorized\ninto six stages: pre-event phase, when planning for the disas-\nters and trying to prevent and mitigate their effects; prodor-\nmal phase, the need to activate the managerial plans where\nthe hospitality industry has no choice of avoidance and must\nface the hazards; emergency phase, when the disaster strikes\nand begins doing damage to the destination; intermediate\nphase, where emergency plans should be adopted to help\npeople and satisfy their needs; recovery phase, where the\nlong-term plans should be applied and affected destination\nshould be rebuilt; and finally in the resolution phase, crisis\nmanagement should be evaluated and improved and organi-\nzational learning should be undertaken, to plan for the next\nhazards and try to mitigate the effect of the next disasters\nMethod\nThis study seeks to explore the existing literature on hospi-\ntality emergency management and preparedness. It pro-\nposes a theoretical framework explaining the relationship\nbetween emergency preparedness, planning, and safety and\nsecurity within the hotel industry. To strengthen the discus-\nsion, the results of former studies have been used. As a con-\nceptual article, the methodology will include a review of\nsecondary data from different resources such as published\njournals, books, and conference proceeding papers to\nexplain the existing concepts (Chaudhary, 1991).

Organizations invest many resources to\nimprove security but terrorists use less resources while pre-\nsenting a high risk to harm these systems (Then & Loosemore,\n2006). New additional systems have emerged to protect the\nhotel entrances such as surveillance cameras, employees'\nemergency checks at the employee entrance, and guest veri-\nfication before reissuing the room key, which also should\ncontrol the access to the elevator and guest floors. Employees\nshould be motivated to be partners with the emergency pro-\ncess and report any suspicious accident or object to the secu-\nrity department (Henderson et al., 2010).\nFrom his point of view, Faulkner (2001) noticed that there\nare a limited number of studies that focus on disasters and\ncrisis management within the hotel industry. In addition, the\nessential needs for crisis management are to increase safety\nand security awareness among practitioners, managers, and\nstakeholders (Chan & Lam, 2013), to improve the written\nemergency plans and avoid lack of training and equipment\n(Kano, Ramirez, Ybarra, Frias, & Bourque, 2007). Rooney\nand White (2007) found lack of emergency plans focusing on\npeople with disabilities, which shows the need to update the\nemergency plans to give them priority when performing an\nevacuation. Furthermore, hotels should consider employing\na person with a disability within the emergency team. Kapucu\nand Khosa (2013) identified the main substantial factors in\nthe emergency preparedness plan, and demonstrate a lack of\nleadership and coordination at the level of preparedness.\nAframework was developed by Racherla and Hu (2009) in\ntheir study about tourism that integrates effectiveness with\nknowledge management when planning and dealing with the\nhazards. They mentioned that organizations respond to the\ncrisis in relation to their own agenda, and a lack of resources\nand confidence among organization prevents knowledge\nsharing between the hospitality organizations that are often in\ncompetition. In contrast, Henderson (2008) found an insuffi-\ncient level of preparedness and planning for the next hazard.\nAs mentioned previously, efficient preparedness and\nplanning for the crisis in the prodormal stage and emergency\nmanagement plans have a critical role in the emergency man-\nagement (Cavanaugh, Gelles, Reyes, Civiello, & Zahner,\nSantana (2004) proposed crisis management models, describ-\ning the crisis stages--precrisis, during the crisis, and postcri-\nsis--using several measurements. Carlsen and Liburd (2008)\nargued that the effects of crises increased because of insuffi-\ncient preparedness and planning for the next hazards, caus-\ning deeper impacts and a long retro-gradation to the\ndestination. Hospitality and tourism practitioners asserted\nthat emergency planners should focus on the prodormal stage\nof preparedness, planning, and prevention.\nThe emergency management plans should be adopted,\nvalidated, and evaluated to ensure the crisis prevention,\nwhich enhances the ability to detect crisis signals that will\nminimize losses. However, during the emergency stage, the\nfocus is on evacuation and communication to ensure imme-\ndiate response and coordination to resolve the crisis. After\nthe crisis has occurred, the focus will be on recovery and\nlearning which helps the businesses to recover and retain\nEmergency practitioners argued that efforts should be\ntaken to mitigate the effects of the crisis and hazard events\nbefore the disaster happened to minimize the losses. Fink\n(1986) clarified that it is very difficult to recognize the warn-\ning signals for all the events. Damage to the organization\nbegan while the crisis moved from the prodormal to the acute\nstage. In this case, damages will fluctuate with regard to the\norganization's preparedness level (see Figure 2). Furthermore,\nRoberts (1994) illustrated his four-stage crisis model explain-\ning the mitigation efforts and preparation in the pre-event\nstage, while efforts should be made to organize to save people\nand property during the emergency stage (see Figure 3).\n6 SAGE Open\nAfter the crisis strikes, efforts should start immediately to\novercome and restore essential services, finally continuous\nplanning and long-term strategies to be prepared for the crisis\nshould be the goals in the long-term stage.\nReviewing the literature, practitioners suggest different\nmodels to deal with the hazards and disaster, to minimize the\nnegative impacts and prevent losses in the hospitality indus-\ntry. Evans and Elphick (2005) suggested in their model that\nwhen dealing with emergencies, there are two typologies of\ncrisis: \"cobra\" and \"python\" (see Figure 4). \"Cobra\" relates to\nsudden disasters such as September 11 or Amman bombing,\nwhich essentially lead to a preventive response, while\n\"python\" relates to repeated disasters affecting the organiza-\ntions. They argued that organizations must enforce collabora-\ntion with the national emergency preparedness to reduce the\npotential impact of such phenomena (see Figure 4).\nFinally, the evaluation and feedback in the resolution\nstage are very important to the hospitality organizations to\nrecover from a disaster and return back to normal operations.\nHospitality should overcome the disaster impacts whether\npositive or negative, reduce their severity or obtain benefits\nas guests, and tourists may change their travel plan to a safer\ndestination; examples include the U.S. tourists changing\ntheir travel plans from the Middle East to the Caribbean dur-\nGulf tourists from the Middle East to the Far East during the\nArab spring revolution (AlBattat, Mat Som, Ghaderi, &\nFaulkner (2001) noticed that disasters could be a turning\npoint for the destination, positive or negative. It can create\nheroes who can manage and guide the organizations to over-\ncome the hazard and return to normal operations (Burnett,\n1999). With the ability to learn from crises, hospitality man-\nagement should modify or adopt new strategies. Furthermore,\na feedback loop should benefit proactive preparedness and\neffective planning to prepare for future disasters (Ritchie,\n2004). As mentioned by Ritchie, Dorrell, Miller, and Miller\n(2004), the organizational learning from the disasters is\ndetermined by the interest to learn from hazardous events.\nThey argued that British organizations make very few\nchanges to their research because they think that these events\ncannot be predicted or forecasted.\nKolb (1984) proposed his loop learning and educational\ntheory. He asserted that double-loop learning needs a para-\ndigmatic model using knowledge and experience gained\nfrom the crisis and, to conclude, it requires a new concept\ncompared with single-loop learning (see Figures 5 and 6).\nPeople who suffer from disasters are more capable of\nFigure 4. Cobra and python disasters typologies.\nSource. Adopted from Evans & Elphick, 2005.\nFigure 5. Single-loop learning.\nFigure 6. Double-loop learning.\nAlBattat and Mat Som 7\nreacting to a hazardous event by a single-loop action. The\norganization will modify its plans, collaborate on efforts,\nenhance communication systems, redistribute its resources,\nand increase its marketing campaign to overcome the impact\nConclusion\nThe hospitality industry is one of the most vulnerable indus-\ntries to crises. More than before, crises are becoming more\nfrequent and complex, affecting the hospitality industry and\nother related industries. Operating 24 hr a day, hotels become\na soft target for terrorists and criminal activities. Thus, it is\nbetter to be well prepared to overcome and mitigate the poten-\ntial impacts of such natural or man-made crisis events.\nRittichainuwat (2005) asserted that marketing the destination\nas being less expensive could not motivate tourists to visit\nhazardous destinations. Furthermore, safety and security are\ntwo of the most important factors for the guests, when com-\npared with low price. Communication and media relations\nwill clear the marketing message and release any ambiguity\nabout the situation, with effective collaboration between\nmedia and government authorities to remove fears and avoid\ntransmitting unnecessary information (Mansfeld, 2006).\nEmergency preparedness plays a significant role in the orga-\nnization. Plans should be adopted, evaluated, and updated.\nManagerial commitment and managers' awareness provide\nnecessary resources and effective training to minimize losses,\nand mitigate the effects of hazards. Safety surveillance and\nsecurity systems are indispensable to the guests in the hospi-\ntality properties; practitioners argued that this could be used\nas a marketing tool for tourists, guests, and meeting planners.\nFinally, organizational single- and double-loop learning from\nthe crisis will help hospitality practitioners to understand hos-\npitality management emergency frameworks, develop proac-\ntive planning, and evaluate a strategy's effectiveness, and\ngive them the opportunities to adopt and implement new ideas\nand strategies to deal with emergencies and hazardous events.\n"
