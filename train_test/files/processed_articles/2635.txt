    "abstract": "Abstract\nOver three decades crime counts in England and Wales, as throughout the Western world, have fallen. Less attention\nhas been paid to the distribution of crime across households, though this is crucial in determining optimal distribu-\ntion of limited policing resources in pursuing the aim of distributive justice. The writers have previously demonstrated\nthat in England and Wales the distribution of crime victimisation has remained pretty much unchanged over the\nperiod of the crime drop. The present paper seeks to extend the study of changes in the distribution of victimisa-\ntion over time using data from 25 countries contributing data to the International Crime Victimisation Survey (ICVS)\nsweeps (1989\u00ad2000). While fragmentary, the data mirror the trends discerned in England and Wales. The trends are\nnot an artefact of the inclusion of particular countries in particular sweeps. The demographic, economical, geographi-\ncal and social household characteristics associated with victimisation are consistent across time. The suggested policy\nimplication is the need for greater emphasis on preventing multiple victimisation.\n",

In the burgeoning liter-\nature on the near ubiquitous crime drop of recent years,\nan emphasis on distributions has arguably been lacking.\nYet if (for example) the crime drop has been most marked\nfor those who already suffered relatively little crime (as\nwith regressive taxation) one would be concerned about\nthe disproportionate burden which the most victimised\ncontinue to suffer. At the operational policing level, it is\ncrucial to know how the diminished crime burden is dis-\ntributed, so as to inform resourcing and deployment deci-\nsions. A recent paper (Ignatans and Pease 2015a) showed\nthat the crime drop in England and Wales in recent years\nwas greatest in absolute terms for the most victimised\nhouseholds, but not so great relative to the decline of\ncrime generally as to yield a more even distribution of\nvictimisation. The most victimised came to suffer fewer\ncrimes, but these crimes represented a somewhat higher\nproportion of the total burden than before. Disaggrega-\ntion by offence type (Ignatans and Pease 2015b) showed\nthat the trends were for all practical purposes uniform\nacross crime types.\nThe crime drop is common across nations. Are the\ndistributional trends also similar cross-nationally? Early\nanalyses of the crime drop were flawed in their exclu-\nsive concentration on trends in the USA. This led to\nthe choice as explanatory variables which were specific\nto that country, such as prison use, police strength and\nabortion legislation. These variables trended differently\nin other countries with similar crime drops (Tonry 2014).\nThe intention here, insofar as the data permit, is to\nexamine whether the trends identified in England and\nWales extend beyond its borders. Is the slight increase in\ninequality of distribution of crime evident in England and\nWales also evident elsewhere? The implications for crime\ncontrol are substantial and will be touched upon in the\n\"Conclusions\".\nMain text\nFor present purposes, four sweeps of the International\nCrime Victims Survey (ICVS) with a total representative\nOpen Access\n*Correspondence: k.pease@ucl.ac.uk\n1 Jill Dando Institute, University College London, 35 Tavistock Square,\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nwere utilised. ICVS features victimisation reports over a\nrecall period of 1 year that were gathered from 25 coun-\ntries contributing data in at least one sweep. Thirteen of\nthese countries featured in at least two sweeps. The data\nused in the analyses comes from countries that were sur-\ninterviewed from each country over the phone (Nether-\nlands Institute for Scientific Information Services 1999).\nSelf-evidently trends require a minimum of two data\npoints to discern so data from twelve countries had to\nbe discarded. The fragmentary nature of the other data,\nand the fact that the most recent ICVS sweep was in 2000\nwhen the crime drop had been under way for less than a\ndecade, represented challenges. Given the unique nature\nof the ICVS data and the importance of the topic in the\nwriters' view, it was a challenge worth accepting.\nBy taking into account the four-year time elapsing\nbetween sweeps, national data present in two or more\ndatasets was deemed sufficient for substantive compari-\nsons of trends in victimisation concentration over time.\nOffences were coded identically in all the sweeps, per-\nmitting consistent comparison across time. All thirteen\ncountries are used in the global analyses (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4,\nMultiple events against the same victim in ICVS are\ncapped to a maximum of five for each offence type. If, for\nexample, someone reports having been assaulted twenty\ntimes, the number of assaults is recorded as five. This\nconvention compromises accuracy. The writers' analy-\nses utilising the Crime survey for England and Wales\n(CSEW) with unlimited incident reporting show many\nvictimisation repeats above the cut-off point of five. The\nunderrepresentation of chronic victims in crime surveys\nis controversial (Farrell and Pease 2007; Lauritsen et al.\n2012). The pre-imposed ICVS five-count threshold was\nby necessity retained. The reader should be aware that by\ndoing so the extent of chronic victimisation, and hence\nthe inequality of victimisation, is understated.\nWhen considering measurement of victimisation ine-\nquality, a slightly amended approach from that of Lorenz\n(1905) was adopted. Households were ranked by number\nof victimisations suffered, the ranked households divided\ninto percentiles, and number of victimisations per per-\ncentile for each year calculated. Each percentile's crime\ncould then be expressed as a proportion of the year's total\nMean\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Vehicle)\nFig.1 Mean vehicle victimisations per household by year and per-\nProportion\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Vehicle)\nFig.2 Proportion of total vehicle victimisations by year and percen-\nMean\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Property)\nFig.3 Mean property victimisations per household by year and\nvictimisations. This permits detailed comparison of ICVS\nsweeps and countries.\nAs noted earlier, Ignatans and Pease (2015b) showed\nthe basic patterns in England and Wales to be similar\nacross crime types. The same approach was applied to\nICVS where means and proportions of victimisations by\npercentile for each crime type.\nThe figures below thus represent two variables.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Mean number of victimisations of a particular crime\ntype suffered by the most victimised percentile, next\nmost victimised, and so on.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The proportion of all victimisations of that type suf-\nfered by the most victimised percentile, next most\nvictimised, and so on.\nResults\nIn all the figures the scales should be noted. They differ,\nbeing chosen to provide the clearest representation of\nthe key part of the victimisation distribution. Offences\nwere categorised in the appropriate categories in a fash-\nion consistent with previous papers (Ignatans and Pease\ncontact with the victim to the personal crime category,\neven where property was taken. Categories were con-\nstructed in the following fashion. Vehicle crimes: car\ntheft, theft from car, damage to vehicle, motor vehicle\ntheft, bicycle theft. Property crimes: burglary, attempted\nburglary, theft from garage. Personal crimes: robbery,\npersonal theft, sexual offences, assault. Figure 1 depicts\nmean vehicle crimes by year. 82 % of households suffered\nno vehicle crime so the abscissa starts at the 81st per-\ncentile, It will be seen that the mean number of vehicle\ncrime victimisations peaks then falls. This pattern is most\nmarked for the most victimised 1 % of households sam-\npled where a drop of 16 % is noted between the years of\nFigure 2 depicts the proportion of all vehicle crimes\nby percentile and ICVS sweep. A greater proportion of\nvehicle crime is suffered by the most victimised 1\u00ad2 %\nof households in 2000 than had been the case in the two\npreceding sweeps, and marginally more than in 1989.\nAfter an initial decline, the proportion of crimes in the\ntenth decile and especially top percentiles increased.\nProportion\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Property)\nFig.4 Proportion of property victimisations by year and percentile,\nMean\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Personal)\nFig.5 Mean personal victimisations per household by year and\nProportion\nPopulation Percentiles\nVictimised Sample\n(Personal)\nFig.6 Proportion of personal victimisations by year and percentile,\nAn increase of 19 percent is seen in the last percentile\nParallel analyses for property crime are depicted as\nFigs. 3 and 4 and personal crimes as Figs. 5 and 6.\nProperty victimisations show the by now familiar\ndecline in crime count and increase in proportion suf-\nfered by those most victimised. Property crime count fell\nby 30 % in the last percentile while the proportion of vic-\ntimisations attributed to the same households increased\n1989 sample backs the trend both here and in the depic-\ntion of crimes against the person shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\nThe decline in crime counts and changes in proportion\nsuffered by the most victimised is much less marked for\ncrimes against the person than for other crime types. As\nthe drop in violent crime lagged behind the drop in other\ncrime types and the last ICVS sweep came too early to\ncapture the drop fully. Crime count experienced by the\ntop percentile dropped by 5 per cent between the years\nincreased by 13 percent in the same time period.\nThe alert reader will note that the data could be skewed\nby countries with different characteristics participating\nin earlier relative to later sweeps. This was checked by\nlooking at pairwise within country comparisons across\nsweeps. For example, comparing the first and fourth\nsweeps in respect of vehicle crime, how many countries\nexhibited a decrease in mean crime for the top percentile,\nand how many an increase? Likewise, how many coun-\ntries exhibited an increase in proportion of crime for the\ntop percentile and how many a decrease? Details of these\nanalyses are available from the first author on request.\nSuffice it here to say that the decreased count slightly\nincreased concentration pattern is common across coun-\ntries and is not an artefact of which countries partici-\npated in which sweeps.\nTo recapitulate, the absolute victimisation of the most\nvictimised has decreased internationally, as the propor-\ntion of victimisation suffered by the most victimised 1 %\nof households has increased. After an initial decline in\nthe early 1990s, the proportion of crimes attributed to\nthe most victimised increased to just below a quarter for\nvehicle crimes, nearly a half for property crimes and over\na third for personal offences.\nThe next step in the present paper addresses the ques-\ntion of whether the attributes of the heavily victimised\nhouseholds remain similar across time. There is already a\nsubstantial literature on attributes associated with crime\nvictimisation (Tseloni et al. 2010; Kershaw and Tseloni\ntend to be analyses at single points in time. Our previous\npapers examined a number of characteristics available in\nBritish data. The only other empirical study of which we\nare aware which concerns equity if distribution of crime\nevents during the crime drop was the study of domestic\nburglary of James Hunter and Andromachi Tseloni (2016).\nHere the question is whether the variables which distin-\nguish the most victimised households and individuals in\n1989 are the same as those which distinguish the most\nvictimised in 2000. The conclusion reached is that the risk\nin mind that the present analysis says nothing directly\nabout area effects, which will also inform prioritisation\nof crime prevention effort (Tseloni 2006; Kershaw and\nProbabilities matter little with the sample sizes avail-\nable. The important point is the consistency of the\nfindings, as the characteristics associated with highly vic-\ntimised are consistent across the 12 years of data avail-\nable from the ICVS. Households with less favourable\neconomic, geographic and demographic characteristics\nare consistently experiencing an overwhelmingly greater\nproportion of victimisation.\nConclusions\nConsidering the convergence of patterns found in previ-\nous analyses limited to England and Wales and the cur-\nrent international investigation, it appears that with little\ndoubt the cross-national crime drop can be seen as the\nproduct of a drop in the count alongside a change in the\ndistribution of crime across households. Around half of\nall property victimisation is suffered by the 1 % of house-\nholds which are most victimised, as is about one third of\npersonal victimisation. The greater proportion of prop-\nerty relative to personal victimisation differs from the\nBritish picture, and is suspected to be an artefact intro-\nduced by the capping of crime events. If there are many\nvictims of multiple personal crimes, this reversal of effect\nwould be the result. Research which is urgently neces-\nsary and has been absent from the victimisation survey\nliterature to date has been follow-up interviews with\nthose multiply victimised to confirm the veracity of their\naccounts. For those accusing multiple victims of confabu-\nlation, the question why this confabulation should have\ndeclined over time in line with decreased crime counts.\nThe practical implication made in previous papers should\nsimply be reiterated here. The concentration of crime pre-\nvention effort and resources should be directed at those\nalready victimised. This is even more the case now than\nwas the case before the onset of the crime drop. Repeat vic-\ntimisation is most likely to occur and (reoccur the most) in\nhouseholds with less favourable economic, geographical and\ndemographic factors, therefore police attention and preven-\ntion efforts must be directed towards such households expe-\nTable1 Characteristics of those heavily victimised over ICVS sweeps\nIt summarises the analyses.
