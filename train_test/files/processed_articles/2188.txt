Haberstick and Andrew Smolen\nThe Add Health cohort was then followed through their\ntransitiontoadulthood,andresearchturnedtounderstand-\ning the determinants and consequences of developmental\nand health trajectories from adolescence into adulthood.\nAcrossallinterviewwaves,comprehensivelongitudinaldata\non health and health-related behavior were collected, in-\ncluding life histories of physical activity, substance use,\nsexual behavior, delinquency and violence, social and ro-\nmantic relationships, cohabitation, marriage, childbearing,\ncivic engagement, education, and multiple indicators of\nhealth status based on self-report (e.g., general health, men-\ntal health, chronic illness), direct measurement (e.g., over-\nweight status and obesity), and biological measures (e.g.,\nfrom blood spots, urine, and saliva).\nThe study has been funded by three Program Projects\nwith co-funding from 23 other Federal agencies and na-\ntional foundations. Add Health has become a national data\nresource for over 10,000 Add Health researchers who have\nobtained more than 500 independently funded research\ngrants and have produced thousands of peer-reviewed re-\nsearch articles published in multiple disciplinary journals\nand research outlets. Below we describe the design of Add\nHealth and its sibling pairs sub-sample, followed by the\ntypes of data available, a summary of research findings, and\ndata access.\nAdd Health Design\nAdd Health used a school-based design that selected 80 high\nschools and a paired feeder school from a stratified list of\nall high schools in the United States in 1994. Schools were\nstratified by region, urbanicity, school type (public, pri-\nvate, parochial), ethnic mix, and size; 79% of the schools\ncontacted agreed to participate in the study. An in-school\nquestionnaire was administered to more than 90,000 stu-\ndents in Grades 7\u00ad12 who attended these schools during\nfilled out a questionnaire about the school. The in-school\nstudent questionnaire provided data on the school context,\nfriendship networks, school activities, future expectations,\nand a variety of health conditions. An additional purpose\nof the in-school questionnaire was to identify and select\nspecial supplementary samples of individuals in rare but\ntheoretically crucial categories. It is this aspect of the design\nthat enabled Add Health to oversample twins and other sib-\nling pairs according to their genetic relatedness within this\nnationally representative sampling frame.\nAdd Health obtained rosters of all enrolled students in\neach school. From the union of students on school ros-\nters and students not on rosters who completed in-school\nquestionnaires, a gender- and grade-stratified core sample\nof 200 adolescents was selected from each school pair for a\n90-minute in-home interview as part of the Wave I inter-\nPairs of Individuals in Embedded\nGenetic Sample, Add Health\nWave I\nSibling type N\nUndetermined twin type 25\nview. The core in-home sample is essentially self-weighting,\nand provides a nationally representative sample of 12,105\nAmerican adolescents in Grades 7\u00ad12. Twins and other sib-\nling pairs occur naturally in the core in-home sample pro-\nportional to their representation in the general population\nHowever, to increase the potential number of twins for\ngenetic analysis, twins and other sibling pairs were over-\nsampled for the in-home sample, based on responses from\nthe in-school survey.\nSibling Pairs Recruitment\nFrom answers provided in the in-school survey, Add Health\ndrew supplemental samples based on the genetic related-\nness of siblings in a household. If an adolescent indicated\nthat he or she was a twin in the in-school survey, they were\nselected with certainty (e.g., 100%) for inclusion in the in-\nhome Wave I sample. Full siblings occur naturally in large\nnumbers in the core in-home sample, but half siblings and\nunrelated adolescents (e.g., stepsiblings, foster and adopted\nchildren, adolescents in group homes) who participated in\n1995) and lived in the same household were also oversam-\npled. Table 1 shows the number of pairs of adolescents in\nthe sibling pairs sub-sample who were interviewed in home\nat Wave I. This sub-sample includes more than 3,000 pairs\nof adolescents who have varying degrees of genetic relat-\nedness and represent a fully articulated behavioral genetic\ndesign. These pairs of adolescents took the same question-\nnaires, share the same home environment, and share, in\nmost cases, the same school and neighborhood environ-\nment. The embedded sibling pairs design in Add Health\nand the data available for sibling pairs are unprecedented\nfor a US study of this magnitude. In all follow-up inter-\nviews, high priority has been placed on locating and re-\ninterviewing sibling pairs to maintain the integrity of this\nsub-sample for longitudinal research purposes.\nIn addition to the sibling pairs sample, supplemental\nsamples were also drawn based on ethnicity (Cuban, Puerto\nRican, and Chinese) and physical disability. Add Health also\noversampled African American adolescents with highly ed-\nucated parents to provide sufficient cell sizes for analyses\nbroken down by race and socio-economic status.

Complete social net-\nwork data were collected in the saturated field-settings by\ngenerating a large number of romantic and friendship pairs\nforwhichbothmembersofthepairhadin-homeinterviews.\nThese data provide unbiased and complete coverage of the\nsocial networks and romantic partnerships in which adoles-\ncents are embedded. A parent, usually the resident mother,\nalso completed a 30-minute interviewer-assisted interview\nat Wave I. The core sample plus the special samples pro-\nduced a sample size of 20,745 adolescents interviewed in\nthe home at Wave I with a response rate of 78.9%. The\nWave I in-home sample represents the national cohort that\nis followed prospectively through time, and thus this inno-\nvative design remains a major strength of the longitudinal\ndata as well.\nLongitudinal Design\nThe Wave I in-home adolescent cohort has been followed\nup with three subsequent in-home interviews spanning 15\nWave I and 12th graders who were part of the sibling pairs\nsub-sample were re-interviewed for the Wave II in-home in-\ntaining the integrity and size of the sibling pairs sample.\nIn addition, a follow-up school administrator interview\nwas conducted to measure change in school context from\nthrough their transition to adulthood with a Wave III in-\nwerere-interviewedwitha77.4%responserate.Inaddition,\na sample of 1,507 partners of original respondents was also\nhabiting, and 500 dating partners. Wave IV re-interviewed\nthe original Add Health cohort as they settled into adult-\nResponse rates for the sibling pairs sub-sample have been\nhigher than for the overall Add Health cohort at each wave\nbecause sibling pairs are easier to locate (i.e., with more\nfamily contacts) and Add Health has placed priority on\nmaintaining this sample for longitudinal research. Table 2\nshows the number of completed in-home interviews for\nsibling pairs according to their genetic relatedness and their\nresponse rates across waves. Response rates are based on\nindividuals in sibling pairs who were interviewed at Wave\nI and who were eligible for inclusion in the Wave II, III,\nand IV samples. Response rates for the sibling pairs sample\nare quite high, especially at Wave II, only 1 year following\nWave I, when 95% of the siblings in the pairs sample were\nre-interviewed. Even at Wave IV, almost 15 years after Wave\nI, response rates are over 90% for all types of sibling pairs,\n93% for both MZ and DZ twin samples.\nPhenotype Data\nSurvey Data\nAdd Health is a multidisciplinary multidimensional study\nthat attempted to measure all the domains relevant to the\nspecific developmental stage of the Add Health cohort at the\ntime of the interview, with a particular focus on causes and\nconsequences of health and health behavior. Table 3 shows\nthe general topical areas covered by the survey instruments\nacross waves. The Waves I and II questionnaires collected\ndata relevant to adolescence, including relationships with\nparents, siblings and friends, academics and school, ro-\nmantic and sexual relationships, mental health, expecta-\ntions for the future, and health risk behavior. At Wave III\nduring the transition to adulthood, survey attention shifted\ntoward early family formation, post-secondary education,\nlabor market activity and military service, mentoring,\ncivic participation, while maintaining the longitudinal in-\ntegrity of previous data on family, friends, achievement,\nromantic and sexual relationships, physical and men-\ntal health, and health behavior.

The complete set\nof codebooks for all survey components in all waves of\ninterviews can be found on the Add Health Web site at\nwww.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/codebooks.\nEnvironmental Data\nOne of the innovations of the Add Health design was its\nability to obtain independent and direct measures of the\nsocial environment of young people. The in-school and\nWaves I and II in-home interviews contain unique data\nthat characterize the family, school, peer, relationship dyad,\nneighborhood,community,andstatecontextsinwhichAdd\nHealth respondents lived. School context data come from\nthe in-school surveys based on the census of students in\neach school, as well as from school administrator question-\nnaires. Peer network data were obtained in the in-school\nquestionnaire. Adolescents nominated their five best male\nand five best female friends from the school roster (using a\nunique identification number). Because nominated school\nfriends also took the in-school interview, characteristics of\nrespondents' peer networks can be constructed by linking\nfriends' data from the in-school questionnaire and con-\nstructing variables based on friends' actual responses. In\nthe in-home Wave I and Wave II interviews, respondents\nnominated their best friend, as well as their romantic and\nsexual partners. If their friend or partner was also a member\nof the in-home sample, their data could be linked to con-\nstructfriendshipandpartnercontexts.Inthe16schoolsthat\nwere part of the `saturated' sample, all students in the school\nwerealsointerviewedinthehome.Completefriendshipand\nsexual networks could therefore be constructed with these\ndata.\nRespondents' home residences have been geocoded at\neach interview wave and contextual data on the neighbor-\nhood, community, and state have been merged to all in-\ndividual records. More than 8,500 data elements on the\nsocial and physical environment at multiple spatial lev-\nels are available across waves, including such information\nas race, ethnic, foreign-born, and religious denomination\ncomposition, poverty rates, crime statistics, sexually trans-\nmittedinfection(STI)prevalence,divorceandchildsupport\nlaws, welfare policies, cigarette taxes, and the proximity and\nnumber of parks, sidewalks, recreation centers, fast food\nrestaurants, alcohol outlets, and other physical and social\ncharacteristics of the environments in which young people\nlive.\nFigure 1 shows the developmental stages and time pe-\nriods during which the Add Health cohort was followed\nfrom early adolescence into adulthood, and the types of en-\nvironmental data (top panel) and biological data (bottom\npanel) that are available across the waves of data collection.\nThe strength of Add Health, and thus the strength of the\nAdd Health sibling pairs data, is the multiple levels of data\nthat allow researchers to examine social, behavioral, envi-\nronmental, biological, and genetic linkages in health and\nbehavior across the life course from early adolescence into\nyoung adulthood.\nBiological Data\nThe bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the biological mea-\nsures available across waves. Height and weight have been\nmeasured across waves and used to track the obesity epi-\ndemic within this cohort. At Wave III, samples of urine\nand saliva were collected to test for STIs and human im-\nmunodeficiency virus, and buccal cell saliva was collected\nfrom the twins and full siblings in the siblings pairs sub-\nsample for DNA extraction (see Harris et al., 2006). An\nexpanded set of biological measures was collected at Wave\nIV, including biomarkers of cardiovascular health (blood\npressure, pulse), metabolic processes (waist circumference,\nHbA1c, blood glucose, lipids), immune function (EBV),\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

These markers in-\nD20S481 and the sex-determining locus, amelogenin (IBG-\nHvar1, see http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/genotyping lab/).\nThe criterion used to assign monozygosity to a twin pair\nwas 100% concordance of all genotypes at all 12 loci.

Consent rates for Wave IV DNA collec-\ntion were high; 96% of all sibling pairs consented to provide\nsaliva for DNA extraction, and there was little variation by\ntype of genetic relatedness (similar to the consent rate for\nall Wave IV respondents, see `Add Health Wave IV Docu-\nmentation: Candidate Genes' at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/\nprojects/addhealth/data/guides/DNA documentation.pdf).\nThe Wave IV Program Project was budgeted to genotype\n10 candidate loci and a panel of short nucleotide polymor-\nphisms (SNPs) in at least five of the following candidate\ngenes: the dopamine transporter (DAT1, locus symbol\nreceptor (DRD2); serotonin transporter (5HTT, locus\nMonoamine Oxidase A promoter (MAOA-uVNTR);\nMonoamine Oxidase A STR (MAOA[GT]n); dopamine D5\nreceptor (DRD5); Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT)\nI (IGF1).

Haberstick and Andrew Smolen\ngenerated, the following polymorphisms are currently\navailable in the full Add Health sample:\n1. the dopamine transporter 40 base pair (bp) Variable\nNumber Tandem Repeat (VNTR) in the 3' untranslated\nregion of the gene (DAT1; Vandenbergh et al., 1992)\n2. the 48 bp VNTR in the third exon of the dopamine D4\n3. the 43 bp (not 44 bp as originally reported) addi-\ntion/deletion in the 5' regulatory region of the serotonin\n5. the 30 bp VNTR in the promoter region of the\nmonoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA; Samochowiec\nResearch Using the Genetic Pairs in Add\nHealth\nGenetic research in Add Health has been published in a wide\nrange of social and biomedical science journals on topics\nsuch as substance use and dependence (e.g., Daw et al.,\nin press; Zeiger et al., 2008), depression (e.g., Fuemmeler\n(e.g., Dawes & Fowler, 2009), subjective well being (e.g., De\nNeve, 2011), body mass index and obesity (e.g., Haberstick\nHart & Marmorstein, 2009), friend selection (e.g., Board-\ndisorder (e.g., Haberstick et al., 2008), conduct disorder and\nself-control (e.g., Schulz-Heik et al., 2010), family and peer\nmethodology (e.g., Medland & Neale, 2010). More than\nhalf of these publications examine the ways in which the\nenvironment interacts with genetic markers to affect health\nand behavior outcomes. Below we describe in more de-\ntail some illustrative examples of genetic research in Add\nHealth.\nGuo et al. (2010) examined how the dopamine trans-\nporter gene (DAT1) interacts with age (or life course stage)\nin relation to risk behavior (including delinquency, number\nof sex partners, substance use, and seatbelt use) from ado-\nlescence into young adulthood, using data on the siblings\npairs from Waves I, II, and III of Add Health. They reported\na protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype in the VNTR\nof DAT1 on risky behavior; individuals with DAT19R/9R\ncompared to DAT1Any10R, reported lower levels of risky\nbehaviors. However, this protective effect varied according\nto age/life course stage, such that genetic protection is evi-\ndent when the risk behavior is illegal (e.g., alcohol use and\nsmoking in adolescence), but vanishes when the behaviors\nare legal or more socially tolerated (e.g., alcohol use and\nsmoking in adulthood). This research is important because\nit demonstrates how legal, as well as social, contexts can\nenhance or diminish genetic associations with a spectrum\nof risky behaviors.\nBoardman et al. (2008) exploited the design of Add\nHealth to investigate peer and school environment interac-\ntionswithgeneticfactorsassociatedwithsmokingcigarettes\namong adolescents. In the Add Health in-school survey, re-\nspondents nominated up to 10 of their friends who were\nalso in-school survey participants. Adolescents receiving\nthe most friendship nominations can be classified the `most\npopular' students who shape smoking norms for the larger\nschool community because of their social status and so-\ncial connections. Boardman and colleagues assessed the\nsmoking behavior of the most popular students and found\nthat school norms favoring smoking (i.e., prevalence of\ndaily smoking among the most popular students) enhanced\nthe associations between genetic factors and daily smoking\namong all students. Thus, genetic contributions may not\nemerge unless the environment actively engages individu-\nals in behaviors and reinforces these behaviors. Because the\nrelative contribution of genetics to the daily use of cigarettes\nis conditional upon school norms related to cigarette use,\nthere are policy opportunities to influence these norms to\ncurb smoking behavior during the critical stage of adoles-\ncence, when initiation of smoking can set trajectories for\ncontinued use into adulthood.\nTaq1A single nucleotide polymorphism is related to school\ncontinuation and whether social relationships compensate\nthe DRD2 genetic risk. How much parents and their chil-\ndren talk about school projects, related issues, and grades\ncaptured the student\u00adparent relationship and parental in-\nvolvement in their school at Wave I (1995). School attain-\nHealth participants in the sibling pairs sample were be-\ntween the ages of 18 and 24 among Black and White males\nand females. Tests of the gene-environment interplay in\nthis study revealed that two measures of parental involve-\nment and the quality of school mitigated the risk of not\ncontinuing their schooling among carriers of the DRD2\nTaq1A allele. These factors included a high parental socio-\neconomic status, high parental involvement in school, and\nhaving attended a school where a large number of stu-\ndents go on to attend college. These findings underscore\nthe salience of the student--parent relationship in enhanc-\ning the likelihood of continuing education beyond high\nschool.\nAccess to Add Health Data\nAddHealthbecameapioneeringstudyindatasharingbyes-\ntablishing a data dissemination plan that (1) stipulated that\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Add Health\ndata sets have been distributed to researchers around the\nworld since the release of Wave I data in 1997 and cur-\nrently there are over 10,000 Add Health researchers using\nthe released data.\nAdd Health releases all survey data across all waves of in-\nterview, and releases assay and test results on biospecimens,\nincluding STI test results, biomarkers, and the genotype\ndata described above. Due to the sensitive and confiden-\ntial content, Add Health data sets are distributed according\nto a tiered data disclosure plan designed to protect the data\nfrom the risk of direct and indirect disclosure of respondent\nidentity. The tiered data disclosure plan consists of four ver-\nsions of Add Health data that differ in the amount of detail\nin confidential information included. Restricted data con-\ntracts require users to take comprehensive precautions to\nprotect the data from non-authorized use and agreeing to\nuse the data solely for statistical reporting and analysis.
