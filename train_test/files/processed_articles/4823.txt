However, the development of user experiences\nwith a technology or gaining user skills might change the user's attitudes toward (Hiltz\nand Rogers, 1980) or even the user's conceptualizations (Rice and Contractor, 1990) of\nthat technology. While earlier technology acceptance research has mainly focused on\nexplaining why people initially adopt technologies, only a minority of these studies have\npaid attention to what happens in the post-adoption stage. This is where people decide\nbetween continuing and discontinuing the use of the technology. The consideration of\ndifferent antecedents for pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs has been argued for by\nbeliefs are formed based on three types of information: past behavior, affective informa-\ntion, and cognitive information (Zanna and Rempel, 1988). A reasonable assumption is\nthat pre-adoption beliefs are mainly shaped by affect or cognition through indirect expe-\nriences with a technology (i.e. by watching others using the technology or via media),\nwhile post-adoption beliefs are mainly created based on past experience (Karahanna\nConsequently, beliefs after using a technology may differ from the beliefs that have led\nto the initial adoption of that technology. Only when people are willing to continue to use\na technology after initial adoption, one could assume that the acceptance of that technol-\nogy is a success. But even then, one should expect the possibility of discontinuance,\nreplacement, or unintended negative consequences.\nStudying long-term use within people's natural environments, such as domestic envi-\nronments, can provide practical insights into the continuous use of and user experiences\nwith these systems because these environments are stable and controllable for users. It is\nextremely fertile to explore changes in use behavior and user experience over time in\nthese relatively stable and controllable environments. This article aims to provide insight\ninto the long-term acceptance process by presenting a phased framework for long-term\nacceptance, validate this framework, and to see whether and how a longer, uninterrupted\nperiod of use of interactive technology in a domestic environment affects changes in\nlong-term use itself, as well as the user's attitudes and behaviors associated with the\nlong-term use of interactive technologies. Interactive technology refers to products and\nservices on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions through\na multimodal interface, such as computers, smartphones, video games, and socially inter-\nactive robots.\nA phased framework of long-term acceptance\nAn alternative approach to the commonly used adoption models (e.g. Davis, 1989;\nVenkatesh et al., 2003) in technology acceptance literature is offered by the domestication\ntheory (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996) and the diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers,\n2003). These theories incorporate a sociological perspective and take on a more ecologi-\ncal view on acceptance rather than focusing on the individual-level causal relationships\nbetween factors explaining technology acceptance. While the diffusion of innovations\ntheory is useful as it explains how technologies are adopted through the concept of rein-\nvention (i.e. how they are altered by the user along the way) and the organizational pro-\ncesses of structuring (i.e. how the technology and the social structures of the environment\nmutually change over time), the domestication theory is more valuable in the ways it\nprovides insights into the intricate processes whereby the user assigns meaning and sig-\nnificance to the artifact, and how this is experienced by domestic users during the acquisi-\ntion and consumption of the technology. However, these theories and other existing\nphasing of technology acceptance focus on either pre-adoption or post-adoption. Currently,\nno theory exists that offers an extensive phasing of the full acceptance process from antic-\nipating the use of a technology and that goes beyond patterns of sustained used. Therefore,\nwe will combine existing theories on phases of technology acceptance, together with find-\nings from earlier long-term studies on technology use in the home (e.g. Demiris et al.,\nacceptance phases for interactive technologies: expectation, confrontation, adoption,\nadaptation, integration, and identification. Although some of these user experience terms\nor acceptance phases have been discussed in the literature, this is a first attempt to gener-\nate a sequence of phases that represent the full acceptance process. The described accept-\nance phases in our framework are linked to the user experiences and are not linked to the\nphases of technology diffusion as is the case in, for example, Roger's (2003) diffusion of\ninnovations theory. In the following, we will describe our phased framework of long-term\nacceptance and enrich these descriptions with findings from earlier long-term technology\nacceptance research. These six phases are analytic concepts, not temporal distinctions\nwith fixed steps in a particular order. Sometimes the proposed sequence holds, but in other\noccasions, the phases occur simultaneously or are reiterated in a feedback. It might even\nbe that people dropout the sequence all together when they decide to reject the technology\nor discontinue its use (De Graaf et al., 2017). The six phases are user experiences regu-\nlarly observed in the acceptance process of technology. The goal is to understand this\nprocess investigating people's user experiences when anticipating, adopting, and appro-\npriating an interactive technology in their own homes.\nExpectation phase\nIn the expectation phase, people learn about the technology, determine its value, and\nform expectations and attitudes toward it before they invite the technology into their\nhomes (Sung et al., 2009, 2010). People seek information about the technology to reduce\nuncertainty, which is the most crucial aspect in attitudes and decisions toward adopting a\ntechnology (Rogers, 2003). They want to learn about the purpose of the technology, then\ntry to understand the functionality of the technology, and finally pursue to provide expla-\nnations for its internal processes. After rationalization comes, affection and people will\nform their interpersonal attitude toward the technology (Rogers, 2003). This is where\npeople become emotionally involved with the technology and actively try to gain knowl-\nedge about the technology and judges this knowledge. However, people who are\ntypically unsure are more likely to seek reinforcement in the opinions of others (Rogers,\n2003). This may indicate that people who are hesitant to use an interactive technology\nare more susceptible to social influence. Another study exploring user experiences with\nmobile phones describes an expectation phase, although the researchers call it pre-adop-\ntion, in which people anticipate future experiences by establishing expectations\n(Karapanos et al., 2009). The expectation phase is all about the anticipation and prepara-\ntion of obtaining a technology.\nEncounter phase\nIn the encounter phase, people are encountering the technology in real life for the first time.\nThis can be in a store, but also when one observes other people who are using the technol-\nogy. It is possible that people have their first trials of using the technology. Most people\nprefer having some first trials before starting their actual use of a technology (Rogers,\n2003), that is, adopting it. Moreover, this is also the first opportunity for people to reevalu-\nate their prior expectations of the technology and the benefits or user experiences it has to\noffer (Hiltz and Johnson, 1989; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). It might be that the formed\nprior expectations do not match with what the technology actually seems to be about. This\nis where an expectation gap might occur (Lohse, 2011), and where some people start show-\ning the first signs of not entering the next acceptance phases. All things considered, the\nencounter phase is all about the initial first-hand user experiences with the technology.\nAdoption phase\nThe adoption phase contains the decision that leads to the adoption (or rejection) of a technol-\nogy. We emphasize the necessity to make a distinction between the concepts of technology\nadoption and technology acceptance. Here, technology adoption is regarded as the initial\ndecision to buy and start using a technology. In contrast, technology acceptance is a process\nthat starts with an individual becoming aware of a technology and, ideally, ends with that\nindividual embracing the technology and incorporating its use in his or her everyday life. In\nthe adoption phase, people have their first use trials with the technology in their private envi-\nronments (Sung et al., 2009, 2010). However, uncertainty still exists about the expected con-\nsequences of the use of the technology. Therefore, people want to learn more about the\ntechnology and are trying to familiarize themselves with it (Karapanos et al., 2009), if they\nare still positive about the potential outcomes of technology use. For disruptive technologies,\nwhich demand a notable change of behavior by the user, this understanding of the technology\nalso represents a distinction between innovators and the early majority adopters since both\ngroups of users have very different expectations about innovative technologies (Moore, 1999;\nRogers, 2003). In sum, the adoption phase is all about the first exploration of the newly\nobtained technology and the decision to initially adopt the technology.\nAdaptation phase\nThe adaptation phase begins directly after the initial adoption, so people are still obtain-\ning their initial user experiences but have a broad idea of what the technology is all\nabout. People are still pervaded by feelings of excitement as well as frustration as they\nexperience novel features and encounter learnability flaws (Karapanos et al., 2009).\nPeople familiarize themselves with the technology, identify any issues or concerns, and\nshow the technology to others (Demiris et al., 2008; Hiltz and Johnson, 1989). People\nwill experiment with the technology's complexities and compatibilities in their personal\nspaces and make necessary changes to adapt the technology to their personal needs\nof the presence of the technology (Demiris et al., 2008) and trying to appropriate the\ntechnology (Majchrzak et al., 2000; Rice and Rogers, 1980; Silverstone and Haddon,\n1996), they will finally come to determine reaffirmation of their initial adoption or rejec-\nadaptation phase is all about exploring the purpose of the technology in their natural\nenvironment and trying to adapt its use to personal (use) preferences.\nIntegration phase\nIn the integration phase, people are feeling a functional dependency on the technology\n(Karapanos et al., 2009), have created routines of use (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996;\nSung et al., 2009, 2010), and have fully integrated the technology in their everyday lives\n(Demiris et al., 2008). During the integration phase, the technology has been changed\nor modified by the user (Rice and Contractor, 1990; Rogers, 2003), and the technology\nhas become meaningful in people's everyday lives (Karapanos et al., 2009). They no\nlonger notice the presence of the technology in their homes as long as it does not have\ntheir primary attention (Demiris et al., 2008). When the technology allows its users to\npersonalize this shaping, the probability of long-term acceptance increases (Backer,\n2000). However, it could be that the technology in this phase is used differently from\nthe way it was intended by designers (Rice and Contractor, 1990; Silverstone and\nHaddon, 1996). Briefly, the integration phase is all about incorporating the technology\nin daily use routines.\nIdentification phase\nIn the identification phase, the technology exceeds its functional purpose and becomes\na personal object as people get emotionally attached to it. Users accept the technology\nin our everyday lives, it participates in their social interaction, communicates parts of\nour self-identity that serve to either differentiate us from others or connect us to others\nby creating a sense of community (Karapanos et al., 2009). In this phase, the domestic\nenvironment reconnects with the public values (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996). This\nmeans that the technology can become a tool for making status claims or for expressing\na specific lifestyle to one's social network. Although these factors can also influence\ninitial adoption, in this phase, the characteristics of these factors are put into practice by\nthe user through personal and social identification. The personal side of identification,\nfor example, personalizing it and creating daily routines of use, increases over time. The\nsocial side of identification, for example, enabling self-expression and creating a sense\nof community, initially not only decreases but also shows a gradual and sustained\nincrease (Karapanos et al., 2009). People, again, seek reinforcement for the initial adop-\ntion and may even reverse this decision if exposed to conflicting messages about the\ntechnology (Rogers, 2003). However, as people try to avoid or at least reduce a stage of\ndissonance. Dissonance is the uncomfortable feeling a person experiences when incon-\ngruence occurs between attitude and behavior (Festinger, 1957). This uncomfortable\nfeeling can be resolved by either altering personal beliefs (e.g. attitude toward the tech-\nnology) or performed behavior (e.g. use of the technology). This means that when users\nobtain information that argues not to adopt an interactive technology, they will either\nadvocate reasons why they would continue to use that technology or they will stop\nusing that technology. Moreover, when people become familiar with a technology, they\nbecome more willing to ignore the shortcomings of that technology (Peters and Ben\nAllouch, 2005; Silverstone and Haddon, 1996). During the conformation stage, users\nwant supportive information that prevents the occurrence of dissonance, and users are\nnow willing to influence others about this innovation. In short, the identification phase\nis all about finding supportive information that approves continuance of use and the\npossibility for identify representations.\nDesign of the long-term home study\nThe aim of our study was to validate the proposed phased framework for long-term tech-\nnology acceptance as described in section \"A phased framework of long-term accept-\nance\" and to see whether and how a longer, uninterrupted period of use of an interactive\ntechnology in a domestic environment affects changes in long-term use itself, as well as\nthe user's attitudes and behaviors associated with the long-term use of interactive tech-\nnologies. Our goal was to explore people's ordinary routines of technology use and natu-\nral acceptance processes. In addressing this goal, we employed a commercially available\ninteractive robot. Studying long-term acceptance of an interactive technology with an\nexisting commercially available domestic robot has both advantages and disadvantages,\nwhich we will address as a limitation in the discussion of our results. However, we pre-\nferred this type of interactive technology over others because we wanted to capture peo-\nple's initial, unprejudiced reactions and experiences without prevalent societal norms\nregarding its use. The following sections will provide the details of the method used in\nthis study.\nThe interactive robot\nThe robot used in this study is Karotz (see Figure 1), which is a 30-cm high Internet-\nenabled activated smart rabbit-shaped ambient electronic device. Communication occurs\nvia verbal communication (voice commands), the light-emitting diode (LED) light in its\nbelly, the moveable ears, and by detecting the presence of other objects nearby. As the\nKarotz is permanently connected to the Internet, it is able to react to, transmit, and broad-\ncast all types of content available on his network.\nEach robot was installed with a basic set of applications, such as daily news broadcasts,\ndaily local weather reports, favorite radio stations, personalized reminders, and randomly\nspoken phrases to make the robot more likely to be perceived as more autonomous and\nanimate. This basic set of applications ensured us that the user experience was somewhat\nsimilar among the participants or at least initially as some participants chose to adjust\nthese applications to their own needs. Besides these basic applications, participants were\nfree to install additional applications as they thought would be useful or fun for their\nhouseholds. This process of appropriation is one of the topics of this study and will be\ndiscussed. Except for one, all participants positioned the robot somewhere in their living\nroom.\nData collection and procedure\nThe study ran from October 2012 to May 2013 and consisted of six moments of data\ncollection at the theorized beginning of each of the six acceptance phases as described in\nsection \"A phased framework of long-term acceptance.\" The timing of the moments for\ndata collection was adopted from earlier research studying the user acceptance of a robot\ntotal, 21 participants started the study who consented to be part of the interview sessions.\nOur research was guided by people's natural interactions with the robot guided by volun-\ntary use, and some of the participants stopped using the robot before the end of the pro-\nject. These results on non-use from our long-term study, including reasons for not moving\ninto the next acceptance phases, are published in a separate paper (de Graaf et al., 2017).\nTable 1 shows the distribution of the sample sizes among the acceptance phases.\nFor the interviews, a representative of the household reported on their own individual\nuser experiences with some additional questions about the opinion of other household\nmembers. Semi-structured interviews, conducted at the participants' own homes, were\nused to obtain detailed user experiences with the robot. Questions were asked about the\nfollowing topics: evaluation of the robot (e.g. Can you describe some advantages/disad-\nvantages of the robot?), evaluation of the use behavior and acceptance (e.g. How often\nhave you used the robot in the last period? Do you consider continuing the use of the\nrobot, why/why not?), user experiences related to and depending on the current accept-\nance phase (e.g. What does a regular day of using the robot look like? Are you still\nexcited about the robot/Have you become familiar with all aspects of the robot? How\nwould you compare the robot with other devices in your home? Have you adjusted the\nrobot to your personal preferences? Do you usually use the robot on similar moments?),\nand the sociability and relationship development with the robot (e.g. Can you describe\nhow you perceive the robot? How are the interactions with the robot similar to/different\nFigure 1. The Karotz robot deployed in the participants' homes.\nfrom interactions with other persons? Does the robot seem to have its own will/personal-\nity? Does the robot offer some kind of companionship?).\nData analysis\nA total of 97 interviews with the 21 participants were conducted, recorded, and tran-\nscribed verbatim with the participants'approval. Each interview was divided into several\nsections containing parts of the participants' answers related to one topic. Based on the\ndetailed descriptions of the acceptance phases presented in section \"A phased framework\nof long-term acceptance\" together with the transcriptions of the interviews, key concepts\nregarding user experiences were identified and translated into a coding scheme by the\nprimary coder. The final coding scheme is presented in an appendix. Next, for each inter-\nview section, at least one code from the coding scheme was assigned to each interview\nsection by the primary coder. Of the 97 interviews, 32 were randomly selected and the\nsame procedure of applying codes was performed by a second coder. Intercoder reliabil-\nity was substantial with a Cohen's kappa of .73 (Landis and Koch, 1977). In the results,\nfrom every interview transcript, \"striking\" or \"typical\" quotes (Hansen et al., 1998) were\nselected which illustrated, confirmed, or enhanced our understanding of the acceptance\nphases as explained through the emerged user experiences from the coding scheme.\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited with various methods, such as word of mouth, advertising in\npublic locations, and snowball sampling by asking assigned participants for referrals to\nother people who might participate. During recruitment, we tried to balance out the\nhouseholds' demographic profiles to seek diversity. Therefore, the participants were\ndivided into four distinct types of homes (see Table 2): younger singles, older singles,\nyounger couples, older couples, young families (children younger than 12\nyears old),\nmature families (children older than 12years old), and student dorms. Furthermore, to\nfacilitate the interactions with the robot, participants were required to have at least a\nlimited working proficiency in either English or German because the Karotz robot did\nnot provide interactions in Dutch. We compensated our participants who participated\nwith both the questionnaires and the interviews by allowing them to keep their robot after\nstudy completion.\nTable 1. Distribution of sample sizes among the acceptance phases.\nAcceptance phase Time pointsa Interviews\nEncounter Day of the introduction 21\nIdentification 6months after 7\naTime points with regard to introduction of the robot.\nResults\nThis section presents the main occurring user experiences in each acceptance phase that\nemerged from the interview data. Table 3 presents these user experiences from phase to\nphase. The upcoming sections will describe the user experiences for each acceptance\nphase in more detail ordered by the frequency in which participants discussed these user\nexperiences.\nExpectation phase\nIn the expectation phase, people want to know more about the technology and its pur-\nposes and therefore seek information about the technology. The participants talked most\nabout their expectations about using the robot (e.g. anticipation). The participants, not\nknowing all the details of the robot yet, tried to image what it would be like to have the\nrobot in their homes and whether things would change. \"It depends on what [the robot]\ncan do, ... but I don't think it would make any difference [when the robot comes]\"--\nfemale, 22, living in student dorm.\nMoreover, the participants were preparing for the arrival of the robot (e.g. prepara-\ntion). Although this also comes down to thinking about what it would be like to have the\nrobot, preparation contains more details about specific use scenarios. The participants\ntried to prepare themselves for the kind of functionalities the robot had to offer and which\neffects that could have on their attitudes toward the robot or their technology use behav-\nior in general. \"If [the robot] can provide me with information that I normally look up on\nmy computer or tablet, then I can keep sitting down. ... I am all about the practical and\nconvenience\"--male, 31, living alone.\nAdditionally, the participants discussed looking up information about the robot and its\nusages (e.g. information seeking). Before the interviews, most participants explained that\nthey already tried to find information online or that they would prefer more information\nabout the robot:\nI had seen the [recruitment] leaflet in the supermarket. Later I went back to take it with me,\nbecause I wanted to read it all over. But it was gone thus I tried to Google it, but most of\nwhat I found was in English and I did not feel like reading all that. (Female, 57, living\nalone)\nTable 2. Distribution of household types within the sample.\nHousehold N\nYounger single 5\nOlder single 3\nYounger couple 3\nOlder couple 2\nYoung family 3\nMature family 2\nStudent dorm 3\nAnd, finally, the participants were associating the robot's purposes with other tech-\nnologies (e.g. association). Because the participants had never used robot technologies\nbefore, they tried to make sense of it by comparing it to other objects they are familiar\nwith such as personal computers and smartphones. \"I think of it as some type of tool,\nmedia-player like, something from which you can obtain the news or that it could serve\nas an alarm clock\"--female, 27, living with spouse.\nTable 3.

The partici-\npants talked most about the possible benefits of the robot (e.g. recognize benefits). Most\nparticipants perceived the applications of the robot as beneficial, such as the reminders\nor the weather forecast. Other participants looked at the bigger picture and explicitly said\nthat the robot could save them time or that they would not use their computer anymore.\n\"You don't have to turn on the computer anymore. Because you can push the button and\nask for example for the weather forecast or the news\"--male, 24, living alone. A few\nparticipants explained that they perceived some interaction modes as beneficial and\nappreciated the lifelike features of the robot.\nMoreover, the participants were still anticipating their possible uses of the robot (e.g.\nanticipation). They were trying to picture how living with the robot would look like and\nexplained that only time could tell how it all would work out in the upcoming weeks.\nSome participants expected that the robot could become an important part of their lives.\nOthers discussed how the robot could be of use for their household. \"To see what fits me\nand how I can incorporate a learning moment together with the children. That kind of\nthings. It is just a totally different pastime. Just something extra\"--female, 32, living\nwith young family.\nAdditionally, the participants started to discover how to use the robot (e.g. explora-\ntion). Most participants said that, in the upcoming weeks, they would explore the differ-\nent purposes of the robot and would discover how it all works. The participants explained\nthat they just had to try some features and experience it themselves. Some participants\nexpected that this would be fun and that the robot could surprise them with what it can\ndo. \"That we discover new stuff over and over again ... and that I am surprised by what\n[the robots] is going to do\"--female, 38, living with mature family.\nWhile exploring what the robot has to offer, the participants explained that this goes\nalong with a lot of trying to see what works for them (e.g. trial and error). They were\ntesting the different available applications, uninstalling those that did not fit, and\nexplained that some of the applications did not seem to work at all. For some partici-\npants, trying different applications was discussed among family members before going\nforward with it. \"I still find it a bit difficult how you can install new apps in a proper\nmanner. For example, I haven't managed to actually hear the weather forecast yet\"--\nfemale, 55, living with spouse.\nAlso, the participants were still associating the robot with other technologies (e.g.\nassociation). Most participants saw the similarities between the applications of the robot\nand those of a smartphone or tablet. Other participants took the animated appearance of\nthe robot into account by comparing the robot with a rabbit or just by acknowledging it\nsocial abilities. \"In principle, it is somewhat the same as an iPad or iPhone, but more\nhumanlike and a little less like an appliance\"--female, 27, living with spouse.\nAdditionally, the participants discussed looking up additional information about the\nrobot (e.g. information seeking). Most participants tried to Google information about the\nrobot. Some other participants watched movies on YouTube or talked with others about\nthe robot to learn what they could do with the robot. Even during the interview, the par-\nticipants were asking me questions about how to use the robot and what kind of things\nthey could or could not do with it:\nI have discussed [the robot] with some colleagues of mine who also have this robot. That was\nbefore I had installed it. And I asked them what I could do with it, what kind of object is it. And\ngathered some information from that. (Male, 38, living with young family)\nAdoption phase\nThe adoption phase is where people actually start using the technology in their personal\nenvironment and gain their first serious user experiences with the technology. The par-\nticipants mostly discussed discovering the purposes of the robot and how it works (e.g.\nexploration). Where exploration in the encounter phase dealt with intentions to explore\nthe functionalities of the robot, this time, the participants had some stories about their\nfirst discoveries of the robot. \"The next day [after the installation] we have sat down on\nthe couch with the iPad and looked up what kind of apps there are. Tried it out a bit\"--\nfemale, 27, living with spouse.\nMoreover, the participants said that they had discussed having the robot with friends\nand co-workers (e.g. discuss with others). Especially when visitors came to their house,\nthe participants liked to show the robot to them and to talk about it. Other participants\nalso discussed the robot when meeting people outside their homes or some even shared\npictures of the robot on social media. \"I have talked a lot about [the robot]. A friend of\nmine has a similar robot. It is a nice conversation topic at parties ... Other people are\ncurious about it, they like it\"--male, 32, living alone.\nThe participants still felt a need to seek more information about (using) the robot (e.g.\ninformation seeking). The information seeking behavior was quite similar to that in the\nprevious period with the participants rereading the manual or searching the Internet for\nideas of useful applications of the robot. A few participants even asked the researcher for\nmore information. \"I don't think I have seen it all. I think I will look on the internet. I\nhave seen some homepages from which you could download some apps. I think I will\nsnoop around to fulfill my needs\"--female, 19, living in student dorm.\nAdditionally, the participants explained that they were trying out several tasks with\nthe robot and sometimes failed at it (e.g. trial and error). This differed from the trial and\nerror experiences in the encounter phase as this time the errors were not because of a lack\nof user experience but mostly because the robot did not work that well. \"That wouldn't\nwork in the beginning. I was like, haven't I done that right? Then I tried it in the same\nmenu as the garbage reminder and it worked\"--female, 24, living with mature family.\nNonetheless, the participants still acknowledged possible benefits of having the robot\n(e.g. recognize benefits). This time, the participants particularly welcomed the informa-\ntion provided by the robot and the remembrance function. Using the robot seemed to\nsave time for some participants, while others appreciated the robot's reminding them to\ntake out the trash or catch the bus on time. \"It is just easier to use [the robot] as an alarm\nclock and for listening to music ... And asking for today's weather forecast to the robot.\nI used to do that on my mobile phone, but that takes longer\"--female, 22, living in stu-\ndent dorm.\nFinally, the participants were trying to adjust how the robot should be handled with suc-\ncess (e.g. adjustment). The participants experimented with some personal settings on the\nrobot and tried to adjust their behavior to better interact with the robot. Some participants\nsaid they were learning to better understand what the robot says. Other participants felt they\nmust adjust, make everything work better such as moving the robot to a different spot,\nswitching it off when leaving the house, or silence it when it is time for bed. \"[The robot]\nwas annoying at night, because it made noise. But I have learned that I can make him be\nquiet\"--male, 31, living alone.\nAdaptation phase\nIn the adaptation phase, users have a broad idea of what the technology is all about. Yet,\nthe participants were still mainly exploring how to use the robot (e.g. exploration). This\ntime, for the participants, exploration is more in terms of being sure that they have dis-\ncovered all the possibilities the robot offers. \"I still have the feeling that I haven't, that I\ncan install more functions on [the robot]. I haven't tried it all yet\"--female, 57, living\nalone.\nAdditionally, most participants explained that the novelty effect had begun to fade\naway (e.g. familiarization). The participants were becoming familiar with what the robot\ndoes. They learned how to set the robot and the robot had no more surprises for them. \"A\nlittle bit of astonishment ... when it first arrived here ... But that is getting used to, that\nis just a habituation process\"--female, 57, living alone.\nAlso, the participants have appropriated the robot to fit their needs (e.g. personaliza-\ntion). They have adjusted the setting according to their needs. Some participants installed\nsome additional spoken words into the robot, for example, to make it greet them at cer-\ntain times. Other participants reduced the social features of the robot to a minimum. A\nfew participants programmed the robot in such a way that it would turn on the radio, the\nnews, or the weather forecast at set times. \"I have programmed [the robot] to automati-\ncally provide the weather forecast in the morning and evening\"--male, 32, living alone.\nYet, the participants were still associating the purposes of the robot with those of other\ntechnologies they use (e.g. association). However, this time, they focus more on the dif-\nferences between the robot and other technologies instead on the similarities, which was\nmore the case during the adoption phase. \"The robot is a bit like a connection ... more\ninteractive than a radio or smartphone\"--female, 22, living in student dorm.\nMoreover, some participants were adapting the robot to make it part of their everyday\nlives (e.g. incorporation). They used the robot for purposes for which they used other\ntechnologies before, such as listening to music on the robot instead of on the radio. Other\nparticipants integrated the (uses of) the robot into daily routines, such as listening to\nweather forecast every morning or making the use of robot part of their daily activities.\n\"I used to turn on the juke box or the radio on my laptop or on the television, but I use\nthe robot for that now\"--male, 24, living alone.\nFurthermore, the participants were still taking to others about the robot and its pur-\nposes (e.g. discuss with others). The robot still causes some family discussions or when\nvisitors come to the house and want to know more about the robot after they noticed it.\nAnd a few participants want to share their experiences on social media. Finally, the par-\nticipants still realized that the robot has potentials (e.g. recognize benefits). Especially\nthe diversity of use, the reminders and the social aspects were evaluated as a benefit.\nHowever, some participants indicate that the true benefits of the robot will only become\nvisible after further improvement or they point to other types of use for which the robot\ncould be beneficial. \"I think [the robot] is a supplement to our household... I like it that\nhe reminds us of things ... And that he says funny things\"--female, 24, living with\nmature family.\nIntegration phase\nIn the integration phase, a used technology has become meaningful in a person's life. The\nrobot had no more surprises (e.g. familiarization) for the participants in the integration\nphase. The participants explained that they have explored all the options of the robot and\npicked their favorites.Also, the participants were no longer continuously aware of the fact\nthat the robot was there and the novelty was completely gone by now. \"In the beginning\n[the robot] attracts a lot of attention and that is lovely too. And now ... you are not fully\nconscious of him anymore. It becomes normal\"--female, 32, living with young family.\nMoreover, the robot had become part of the participants'everyday lives (e.g. incorpo-\nration). The usage of the robot has become a fixed set of activities. The participants were\nusing the same applications on a regular basis or replaced other home technologies with\none of the robot's functionalities:\nFor the radio, I already had [the robot] switched on. And that hasn't changed. And I use the\nalarm clock once and a while when I must get out of bed. I actually use it for the same things\nagain and again. (Male, 24, living alone)\nYet, the participants were still adapting the robot to their personal preferences (e.g. per-\nsonalization). The participants explained that they kept changing the settings for some of\nthe applications or installed additional applications to make better use of the robot. It was\nreally about selecting the right set of applications that best suit their needs. \"I have pro-\ngrammed [the robot] to automatically provide the weather forecast in the morning and\nevening\"--male, 32, living alone. But, adapting the robot also entails changing its\nappearance with the supplementary set of ears or the stickers the participants received at\ntimes of the installation. \"I have used those [the extra set of ears]. Because I liked the\nblack ones more than the white ones\"--female, 19, living in student dorm.\nNevertheless, the participants were already creating their daily use routines with the\nrobot (e.g. use routine), despite the ongoing alteration of the settings. For some partici-\npants, the robot has become a part of their morning rituals or the use of the robot has\nbecome a special moment during the day. \"There is a pattern in it. It might be that the\nexact time differs, but that won't be much. I basically do the same things at a certain\ntime\"--male, 55, living alone.\nMoreover, the participants still discussed the possible benefits of the robot (e.g. rec-\nognize benefits). This time, with the rejecters of the robot having left the study, the\nremaining participants were more positive about the benefits of the robot. They appreci-\nated several functionalities of the robot, such as the radio and the reminders, which had\nmade changes in the everyday lives of the participants. \"Listening to the radio, installing\nsome stuff to be a reminder that he says out loud. It is a very useful object once and a\nwhile\"--female, 32, living with young family.\nAnd the participants had begun to think about possible new applications of the robots\n(e.g. reinvention). The participants seem to agree that especially the reminder function if\nthe robot is most beneficial. And some participants put the effort into thinking about or\neven making some first attempts in creating new applications for the robot. \"I have\ndownloaded the software [to create new apps]. I want to try to create a third group for the\naudio ... for people who has difficulties to read. Audiobooks, that could be useful\"--\nmale, 55, living alone.\nIdentification phase\nIn the identification phase, a technology exceeds its functional purpose and becomes\na personal object. The participants were fully accustomed to the robot (e.g. familiari-\nzation). They knew what the robot had to offer and how they could make use of that.\nHowever, familiarization was not always something positive at this point. For some\nparticipants, it resulted in boredom and they expected that the robot would offer\nsome new applications. \"I have seen and used most programs already ... For me it is\nmore like a toy and at a certain point it becomes boring\"--female, 22, living in stu-\ndent dorm.\nMoreover, some of the participants continued to talk about the possible benefits the\nrobot provides them (e.g. recognize benefits). These participants who discussed the\npotentials of the robot were positive about the advantages the robot had offered.\nSurprisingly, most participants explained that it was not the robot's utility that they indi-\ncated as most beneficial, but it was the robot's sociability that they appreciated the most.\n\"I would regret it if I did not have him anymore. So, in that sense it has a benefit in some\nway\"--female, 27, living with spouse.\nAlthough sharing experiences of the robot with other people (e.g. discuss with others)\nwas still a topic of interest during the interviews, the participants explained that they had\ntalked less about the robot. Being familiarized with the robot resulted in less triggers\nfrom the participants to share their experiences with others. A few participants explained\nto me that they would like to have an online community with other Karotz users to share\ntheir experiences with. \"I used to do that in the beginning [showing the robot to visitors].\nBut at a certain time, everyone knew the robot already. So, I stopped doing that\"--\nfemale, 22, living in student dorm.\nThe remaining participants integrated the use of the robot into their everyday lives\n(e.g. incorporation). They felt that the robot just belonged in their home as if it would be\nincomplete without the robot standing in its place doing what it does. \"[The robot]\nbelongs with us now\"--female, 24, living with mature family.\nDaily routines of using the robot (e.g. use routine) were created by the remaining\nparticipants. There were standard times at which the participants used the robot, and\nmost of the time they used the robot for the same purposes. \"I used the camera when I am\nat work, to look if everything was going okay back home. And the dairy function on\nSunday evening. That were all things on the same moment\"--male, 31, living alone.\nThe participants had the robot fully adapted to their personal needs (e.g. personaliza-\ntion). They were done exploring the programs and settings and they had spent quite some\ntime doing that before they were completely satisfied with how the robot works best for\nFigure 2. Visualization of the user experiences (n=1663) as coded in the interviews.\nT1=expectation phase, T2=encounter phase, T3=adoption phase, T4=adaptation phase,\nT5=integration phase, T6=identification phase.\nthem. \"I constantly searched for better programs ... He is completely adjusted to me.\nThat is useful\"--female, 22, living in student dorm.\nFor most of the remaining participants, the robot has become something special that\nis just there. Most participants even expressed that they still liked to keep the robot and\nthat they would miss the robot if someone had to take it away from them (e.g. emotional\nattachment). Most participants expected that they would miss the robot if I had to take it\naway. Some participants compared the robot with having pets. Other participants just felt\nthat they owned the robot now that is has been in their homes for so long. \"You get used\nto having it ... It is just like having a pet, when you talk about it like that ... He has\nbecome a part of our family ... I still like him. I would not want to miss him\"--female,\n24, living with mature family.\nFinally, most of the remaining participants came up with ideas to further develop the\nusability of the robot (e.g. reinvention). Some participants tried to program their own\napplication or led others them with that. Other participants just shared their ideas for\nfurther development of the robot with me during the interviews. \"I have tried to look up\nhow you could make an English-speaking robot say stuff in Dutch. I Googled that, but\nthat is quite difficult to do\"--male, 32, living alone.\nGeneral discussion\nThis study provides insights into the long-term acceptance process by presenting a\nphased framework for long-term acceptance, validate this framework, and to see whether\nand how a longer, uninterrupted period of use of interactive technology in a domestic\nenvironment affects changes in long-term use itself, as well as the user's attitudes and\nbehaviors associated with the long-term use of interactive technologies. We proposed six\nacceptance phases: expectation, encounter, adoption, adaptation, integration, and identi-\nfication. Our results demonstrate that most user experiences, which were theoretically\nlinked to a certain acceptance phase, correspond to a substantial extent to the theorized\ntimeline determined for the interviews. Figure 2 shows that user experiences linked to\neach acceptance phase was indeed discussed most by the participants in the interviews\nscheduled for that particular phase. Therefore, we conclude that our phased framework\nfor long-term acceptance of interactive technologies holds when applied to people's\nexperiences anticipating and appropriating the use of an interactive technology in their\nown homes.\nOne deviation from the adopted timeline for our phased framework is observed for the\nidentification phase. After 6months of the introduction of the robot, the participants still\ntalked mostly about adapting the robot to their personal needs and trying to incorporate\nthe use of the robot into their everyday lives. This suggests that the participants had not\nyet fully reached the identification phase at that point. Although the user experiences\nwithin the acceptance phases are believed to be fundamental and generalizable to other\ninteractive technologies for domestic use, this result confirms that the timeline of the\nacceptance process might be different for each technology. For example, another study\nfocusing on user experiences with a smartphone (Karapanos et al., 2009) has partially\ndescribed similar user experiences and acceptance phases, but their participants already\nreached the end of the novelty effect and sustained use after 4weeks of use. Even though\nthe novelty effect ended after approximately 2months in our long-term home study, the\nestablishment of sustained use did not occur at that time for most of the participants.\nThus, the end of the novelty effect and the establishment of habits seem to be two sepa-\nrate processes and should be regarded as such. Ronis et al. (1989) have argued that\nhabitual behavior has been established once it has been performed frequently (i.e. at least\ntwice a month) and extensively (i.e. at least 10 times). However, research on the estab-\nlishment of new behaviors (Lally et al., 2009) indicates that it takes much longer for a\nrepeated behavior to reach its maximum level of habituation. In their study, which inves-\ntigated a wide range of behaviors, people needed approximately 2months (i.e. 66days on\naverage) to establish a new behavior. However, given that the researchers examined a\nwide range of behaviors, there was a marked variation ranging from 18 (drinking a daily\nglass of water) to 254 (doing 50 pushups after morning coffee)days before behaviors had\nbecome habits. Because the satisfactory repetition of behavior in the past may result in\nthe duration of each acceptance phase may depend on the type of technology and is most\nlikely related to the frequency and intensity of technology use. Therefore, caution is\nnecessary when linking the acceptance phases to fixed time frames.\nSome additional remarks on a few user experiences that deviated from the theorized\ntimeline are necessary. First, instead of mainly discussing the robot with others in the\nexpectation phase, the participants mostly discussed the robot with others around 2weeks\nafter the introduction, which we theoretically framed as part of the adoption phase.\nIndeed, innovative technologies are seldom solely adopted for their practical functions\n(Rogers, 2003). We observed in the expectation phase that participants were forming\nattitudes about the compatibility and relative advantage of the robot in terms of their own\nway or patterns of living. When people adopt technologies mainly because of the per-\nceived social awards, lifestyle becomes a key factor of adoption (Li, 2015). It may thus\nbe that, around the adoption decision, the participants had an increased motivation to talk\nabout the robot with other people, which has--in addition to its practical functions--also\nan interactive component.\nSecond, the participants continued to seek information about the robot until 2weeks\nafter the introduction, which suggests that people seek information beyond the expecta-\ntion phase. Although the exact decision moment of whether one decides to use a technol-\nogy or not is often referred to as adoption, the decision itself is a process as well. Once,\nand in many ways not possible until, a person has adopted a technology, often people do\n(and must) seek more information. Thus, adoption doesn't mean complete saturation of\nknowledge and use of the technology. Together, the user experiences of \"discuss with\nothers\" and \"information seeking\" could be regarded as instruments to make sense of the\nrobot or a way to reduce uncertainty. This not only demonstrates an activity related to\nSilverstone and Haddon's (1996) conversion, but it also goes beyond it in that it implies\na mental construction of the used technology (Ling et al., 1999). The participants reported\non their trialability and complexity aspects of the robot in the encounter phase, in that\nthey were experimenting with the robot and sometimes experience its use as difficult.\nBecause the robot was a rather complex piece of technology, the participants may have\nused the additionally sought information and discussion of their experiences with others\nas a venue for improving their understanding of the robot.\nThird, even after 2months of use, the participants still talked a lot about appropriating\nthe technology to their own needs, which in our theoretical framework should have been\nfinalized around 2months of use where the integration phase begins. As stated above, we\nbelieve that these \"delayed\" shifts from one phase to the other could be linked to the\nspecific technology that is under study.\nFinally, the user experience of \"recognize benefits\" was part of all the interviews but\nwas of especial interest to the participants at the day of the introduction to the robot dur-\ning the encounter phase. Moreover, this topic reoccurred during the interviews after\n6months of use during the identification phase as theorized. The rise of this user experi-\nence in both phases is not surprising because these are the moments linked to initial\nadoption and continued use (Davis et al., 1992; Rogers, 2003). Utility is a prerequisite\nfor adopting an interactive robot at this stage of the diffusion in our society (De Graaf\net al., 2016), even though interactive technologies offer sociability purposes in addition\nto their utilitarian advantages.\nThese deviations from our adopted timeline associated with the sequence of accept-\nance phases call for further explorations of long-term use of interactive technologies. To\nfurther establish our proposed phased framework of long-term acceptance, future\nresearch should investigate user experiences with all kinds of interactive technologies.\nThese studies should further explore whether similar acceptance phases and user experi-\nences are observed including their associated timelines.\nLimitations\nAlthough our exploratory study has observed interesting trends for the process of long-\nterm acceptance of interactive technologies in domestic environments, some potential\nlimitations should be addressed. First, the interaction capabilities of the Karotz robot used\nin our study were somewhat limited. The choice of this robot is a consequence of the goal\nof our study to investigate long-term social robot acceptance in multiple households\n(n=70). We had to depend on commercially available robots because research robots are\nstill not robust enough for extended deployment outside the lab without supervision of an\nexpert. The limited capacities of commercially available robots might cause a gap between\ninitial expectations and actual experiences after initial interactions (Lohse, 2011). The\nexpectation gap encountered by our participants resulted in dropout before the end of the\nstudy. Robots could be labeled as a \"disruptive technology\" since they are more than just\nupdated replacements of existing technologies (Ezer et al., 2009), and people are not eas-\nily prompted to embrace disruptive technologies (Dewar and Dutton, 1986; Green et al.,\n1995). Although robot technology is rapidly enhancing, the added value of most robot\nsystems is still inferior compared to other domestic devices already present in the home.\nBased on people's motivations to reject or discontinue the use of the robot, De Graaf et al.\n(2017) conclude that the challenge for robot designers is to create robots that are enjoya-\nble and easy to use or (socially) predictable to capture users in the short term and function-\nally relevant and possess enhanced social behaviors to keep those users in the longer term.\nTherefore, replication of our study with other types of interactive technologies and more\nsophisticated robots is necessary to ascertain whether comparable results occur on the\nacceptance of these systems. Second, although the participants in our study consisted of a\nwell-selected group, some remarks about this group of participants and its relationship to\nthe reported findings must be made.All participants voluntarily joined the study and could\nuse the robot for free. This means that the risk and cost factors in the acceptance process\nwere much lower for our participants, and therefore, the motivations of the users in our\nstudy will be somewhat different from the motivations and user experiences of \"real\"\nfuture users who will buy and employ social robots. Therefore, further research is neces-\nsary to investigate these user experiences when the technology of social robotics matures\nand the diffusion of social robots within society increases.\nConclusion\nThe research presented in this article has provided an initial validation of our phased\nframework for long-term acceptance of interactive technologies and show that acceptance\nphases are linked to certain user experiences which evolve over time when people gain\nexperience with the technology. We have analytically mapped the full process of user\nacceptance of interactive technology in the home, which includes six phases from antici-\npating the use to beyond patterns of sustained used. All six acceptance phases are regu-\nlarly observed when users go through the entire process. However, in other occasions,\nusers may experience overlap between phases or phases are iterated in a feedback. It\nmight even be that people dropout the sequence all together when they decide to reject the\ntechnology or discontinue its use (De Graaf et al., 2017). The presented research has made\nthe full acceptance process observable by identifying the user experiences linked to each\nacceptance phase. Since our phased framework of long-term acceptance is based on two\nprominent theories in the information systems and technology adoption literature, namely,\nthe domestication theory (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996) and diffusion of innovations\ntheory (Rogers, 2003), complemented by the results of studies involving robots and other\ntypes of interactive technologies, we believe that our framework could be applied to a\nbroad range of interactive technologies. Involving end users in the early stages of devel-\nopment helps researchers understand the cultural and social contexts of acceptance and\nenables developers to apply this gained knowledge into their designs, a paradigm that has\nbeen recognized that users shape technology (Lie and S\u00f8renson, 1996; Silverstone and\nHirsch, 1992). Discovering people's perceptions, expectations, and impressions of inter-\nactive technologies in their private domestic environments over a longer period is vital for\ninforming the design and acceptance of these technologies. Further research that investi-\ngates the long-term acceptance of interactive technology in domestic environments is\nnecessary for a successful diffusion of these types of technology within society.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: This research was partially funded by the Centre for Telematics and\nInformation Technology (CTIT) of the University of Twente.\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary material for this article is available online.\nReferences\nAjzen I (2002) Residual effects of past on later behavior: Habituation and reasoned action perspec-\nBacker TE (2000) The failure of success: challenges of disseminating effective substance abuse\nDavis FD (1989) Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information\nDavis FD, Bagozzi RP and Warshaw PR (1992) Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to use comput-\nDe Graaf MMA, Ben Allouch S and van Dijk JAGM (2016) Long-term evaluation of a social robot\nDe Graaf MMA, Ben Allouch S and van Dijk JAGM (2017) Why do they refuse to use my robot?\nReasons for non-use derived from a long-term home study.
