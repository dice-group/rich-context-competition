Numerous methods have been used to evaluate medication management quality in older adults; however,\ntheir predictive validities are unknown. Major medication quality indicators include polypharmacy, drug\u00addrug inter-\nactions, and inappropriate medication use. To date, no study has attempted to evaluate the three approaches systematically\nor the effect of each approach on mortality in a Hispanic population. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship\nbetween polypharmacy, drug\u00addrug interactions, and inappropriate medication use on the mortality of a community-based\npopulation of Mexican American older adults.\nMethods. We used a life table survival analysis of a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of 3050 older\nMexican Americans of whom 1823 were taking prescription and over-the-counter medications.\nResults. After adjustment for relevant covariates, use of more than four different medications (polypharmacy) was\nindependently associated with mortality. The presence of major drug interactions and the use of inappropriate medications\nwere not significantly associated with mortality in our study sample.\nConclusion. Polypharmacy (.4 medications) is significantly associated with mortality in Mexican American older adults.\nThis community-basedstudy isthe firsttodemonstrate adirectassociation betweenpolypharmacyandmortality inthispopulation.\nMEDICATION management represents one of the most\nimportant health care issues for older adults in the\nUnited States. Recently, medication management was identi-\nfied as a ``priority area for national action'' by the Institute\nof Medicine (1). Medication-related errors are common and\nare estimated to account for more than 7000 deaths annually\n(2,3). In 1994, adverse drug reactions were the sixth leading\ncause of death in hospitalized patients (4). In the outpatient\nsetting, 25% of patients reported having an adverse drug\nevent, of which 13% were considered serious (5). In the year\n2000, it was estimated that costs due to medication-related\nproblems exceeded $177 billion (6). Because adults aged\n65 years and older consume more than 30% of prescription\nmedications (7), suboptimal medication management is a\nmajor patient safety concern in older adults.\nAlthough a number of methods have been used to evalu-\nate medication management quality in older adults, their\npredictive validities are unknown. Also, there is no agree-\nment on a standard definition for the use of medications that\nleads to unintended harm. Suboptimal medication manage-\nment has been defined as overuse, underuse, erratic use, or\ncontraindicated use of a prescribed or nonprescribed medi-\ncation (8). Other terms commonly used are adverse drug\nevents, drug-related problems, and adverse drug reactions.\nMedication outcomes most commonly studied in older adult\npopulations are those related to polypharmacy, drug\u00addrug\ninteractions, and the use of inappropriate drugs. Therefore,\nwe use the term suboptimal medication use as defined by any\none of the following: (i) polypharmacy--use of more than\nfour medications, (ii) drug\u00addrug interactions--presence of any\ndrug\u00addrug interaction, or (iii) the presence of inappropri-\nate medication use as defined by the Beer's criteria (9).\nPotential causes of poor outcomes due to medications are\nnumerous. Polypharmacy has been associated with a higher\nrisk of adverse events, poor patient compliance, higher health\ncare costs, and increased hospitalizations (1,10,11). Use of\nmore than a single medication also carries the potential of\ndrug\u00addrug interactions. Drug\u00addrug interactions are common\ndifferent drug\u00addrug interactions have been identified as\npotentially serious (12). Additionally, geriatric care experts\nhave developed an ``inappropriate'' medication list consisting\nof medications considered unsuitable for older adult patients\ndue to the high risk of unintended harm (9,13). The prevalence\nof inappropriate medication use in older adults has been\nestimated to be as high as 40% (11). Each of these indicators\nillustrates potential suboptimal medication management.\nStudies have approached quality indicators for sub-\noptimal medication management in various ways including\ninappropriate medication use and potential drug\u00addrug\ninteractions. Each approach has individually been shown\nto be a significant factor in determining adverse outcomes\nfrom medication use. To date, no study has attempted to\nevaluate the effect of each quality indicator on mortality in\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\na community-based older adult population. This article\ndescribes the impact of polypharmacy, drug-drug interac-\ntions, and inappropriate medication use on the mortality of\na selected population of community-based Mexican Amer-\nican older adults living in the southwestern United States.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudies of the Elderly (EPESE) is an ongoing longitudinal\nstudy of Mexican American older adults between the ages\nof 65 and 99. The study design and sampling have been\ndescribed previously (14). In brief, the sample was drawn\nusing area probability sampling procedures to represent the\nMexican American older adult population residing in Texas,\nNew Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. In 1993, the\nstudy team completed in-home contacts with the participants\nthat included medication information. There were 3050\nparticipants interviewed and evaluated in their own homes by\ntrained interviewers. Follow-up in-home evaluations were\ndone approximately 2 years apart with the most recent contact\nbeing approximately 8 years after the original contact. Of the\nand 1227 did not. Eight-year mortality data were used in the\npresent study. There were 940 deaths (30.8%) since baseline.\nFor deceased persons, a brief proxy interview was obtained\nthat included information on the time and place of death,\ncauses of death, and any hospitalizations or nursing home\nadmissions. Validation of death was confirmed by a National\nDeath Index search. Research protocol was approved by the\nUTHSCSA and UTMB institutional review boards, and all\nparticipants gave informed oral consent.\nMedication Definitions\nWe define suboptimal medication use as any of the\nfollowing:\nPolypharmacy.--Polypharmacy is defined as the use of\nmore than four medications. This number was chosen for\nclarity of presentation and to be consistent with prior\ndefinitions of polypharmacy (15\u00ad18). The total number of\nprescription and over-the-counter medications taken by each\nparticipant were counted, and participants were categorized\ninto groups taking 1, 2, 3, 4, or .4 medications. Combi-\nnation products were counted as more than one medication\nby the total number of active ingredients.\nDrug\u00addrug interactions.--Potential adverse drug\u00addrug\ninteractions were determined for each participant by use\nof the Micromedex Intranet Knowledge Base System (19).\nThis system was selected because it is comprehensive,\nwidely available, and interactive. The Micromedex system,\npart of the mobile Physicians Desk Reference, is designed\nto assist the clinician in interpreting interaction data. The\nMicromedex system used an expert panel to identify drug\ninteractions and classify them into three groups. Each\nparticipant's medications were entered from the Hispanic\nEPESE database into the Micromedex system: Drug interac-\ntions were then categorized into major, moderate, or minor\ndrug\u00addrug interactions by using the following criteria devel-\noped by the Micromedex system: (i) Major: The adverse\ninteraction may be any interaction that is contraindicated,\nlife-threatening, and/or requires medical intervention to\nminimize or prevent serious adverse effects. Examples in-\nclude the use of erythromycin with amiodarone or metopro-\nlol with verapamil. (ii) Moderate: The interaction may result\nin an exacerbation of the patient's condition and/or require\nan alteration in therapy. (iii) Minor: The interaction would\nhave limited clinical effects. Manifestations may include\nan increase in the frequency or severity of side effects but\ngenerally would not require a major alteration in therapy.\n``Inappropriate'' medication use.--Each participant's\nmedication list was evaluated for use of ``inappropriate''\nmedications by using the Beer's criteria for inappropriate\nmedication use (9), and participants were classified into\nthose using inappropriate medications and those not using\ninappropriate medications. Beer's criteria include a list of\nmedications considered inappropriate by an expert panel\nbecause they are either ineffective or present unnecessary\nhigh risk. Examples include the use of carisoprodol, chlor-\npropamide, ticlopidine, and flurazepam.\nOther Variables\nAge-adjusted mortality.--Mortality was evaluated at follow-\nup visits every 2 years for a total of 8 years, and was validated\nby using the National Death Index. Mortality rates for those\nparticipants who met criteria for suboptimal medication use,\ncompared to those who did not, were age-adjusted using the\ndirect method of adjustment. The 1990 U.S. Census data,\nas the Census time closest to the EPESE medication data\ncollection, was used as the standard population for age dis-\ntribution of Mexican Americans age 65 years or older.\nSociodemographic variables.--Sociodemographic variables\ncollected included age, gender, date of birth, current household\nincome, current employment status, and acculturation. Accul-\nturation was measured using Hazuda's algorithm (20).\nIllness severity.--Instrumental Activities of Daily Living\n(IADL) and self-reported health status were used to estimate\nillness severity. IADLs were assessed using the modified\nOlder American Resource Scale (OARS) (21). For self-\nreported health status, participants were asked to rate their\ncurrent health status as excellent, good, fair, or poor.\nDisease states.--We assessed the presence of chronic\nillnesses with a self-reported condition checklist used pre-\nviously in the EPESE studies. The major disease states listed\nwere those defined by the National Center for Health\nStatistics as the leading causes of death in the United States\n(22). In order, these are: cardiovascular disease, neoplasms,\ncerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, and diabetes mellitus. Hypertension was also in-\ncluded due to its major impact on morbidity and medication\nuse in the Mexican American population. We exam-\nined each disease separately, as individual diseases have\ndifferential impact on medication use and on mortality.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not included in\nthe EPESE baseline evaluation and was therefore excluded\nfrom the analyses.\nStatistical Analysis\nLife table survival estimates were obtained using SAS\nsoftware (23). The survival function S(t) was calculated as\nS(t) \u00bc 1 \u00c0 f(t), where f(t) indicates the death rate as a func-\ntion of time. Homogeneity of the estimated survival curves\nbetween the various medication usage groups were tested\nusing the Wilcoxon signed rank and log-rank test statistics\n(24). These statistics test the null hypothesis that the rates of\ndecline in each group are not statistically different. Survival\ndistribution plots were drawn for visual inspection. In addi-\ntion, Cox proportional hazards regression models (25) were\nused to control for gender, age, educational level, illness\nseverity, and six chronic comorbid disease states.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nThe demographic characteristics (Table 1) show that\nThose participants who used medications were more likely\nto be female, have poor self-reported health, have ADL\nlimitations, and suffer differentially from the five chronic\ndiseases examined.\nUnadjusted Survival Models\nThe unadjusted proportional hazards models for drug\u00addrug\ninteractions, polypharmacy, and inappropriate medication\nuse are shown in Table 2. Participants who had the potential\nof major drug\u00addrug interactions relative to those with no\ninteractions had significantly poorer survival (43% increased\nmortality risk). Also, those participants with a moderate drug\ninteraction potential had a marginally significant poorer\nsurvival. Participants who used more than four medications\nrelative to those using one medication showed a 54%\ndecreased survival rate. Inappropriate medication use was\nnot significantly associated with increased mortality risk.\nDrug\u00adDrug Interactions\nFigure 1A depicts survival by medication interaction\ngroup. Significant differences in mortality were found over\ntime in those participants who had the potential for a major\ndrug\u00addrug interaction only (p , .05).\nTable 3 shows the results of the adjusted and unadjusted\nproportional hazards model where a dichotomous drug\ninteraction variable (major or moderate \u00bc 1; other \u00bc 0) was\nused to predict mortality. Relative to those with no drug\ninteractions, those participants with a major or moderate\ndrug interaction demonstrated a 27% increase in mortality\nrisk (Model 1 in top part of Table 3). After adjusting for age\nand gender (Model 2), the increased risk remained signif-\nicant. However, after adjustment for comorbid disease\n(Model 3) and functional status (Model 4), the increased risk\nfor participants with a major or moderate drug interaction\nwas no longer significant. This finding indicates that the\nassociation between drug interaction and mortality is ex-\nplained by the significant comorbid factors.\nPolypharmacy\nFigure 1B depicts survival in the cohort by five poly-\npharmacy groups (use of 1, 2, 3, 4, or .4 medications).\nThose participants taking more than four medications had\nsignificantly higher mortality rates (p , .0002).\nTable 3 also shows the adjusted and unadjusted pro-\nportional hazards model in which a dichotomous poly-\npharmacy variable is used as a predictor of mortality (.4\ndrugs vs 4 drugs). In the unadjusted model (Model 1), the\nrisk of mortality was increased by 51% among those taking\nTable 2.

After adjustment for demographics, comorbid illness,\nand functional limitations (Models 2\u00ad4), the risk of mor-\ntality associated with polypharmacy decreased to 27% but\nremained statistically significant.\nThe interaction between time and the aforementioned\nsuboptimal medication use was not statistically significant\n(p \u00bc .40), demonstrating that the assumptions of pro-\nportional hazards were not violated.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the\nrelationship of polypharmacy, drug\u00addrug interactions, and\ninappropriate medication use with mortality in a community-\nbased cohort of Hispanic older adults in the United States.\nPolypharmacy was a predictor of mortality, independent of\nage, socioeconomic status, or chronic disease status and/or\nseverity. It has been thought that polypharmacy is potentially\nharmful because, in large part, it increases the probability of\nadverse drug\u00addrug interactions (26,27). Our results do not\nappear to support this conclusion because polypharmacy\nalone (not potential adverse drug\u00addrug interactions) was\nassociated with mortality. It has been reported that adverse\ndrug events seem to be most commonly due to failure in\nproper dosing (28). Rather than a direct toxicity due to\nadverse drug\u00addrug interactions, polypharmacy might have\na direct effect through the cumulative effects of multiple\nmedications on the renal or hepatic systems of older adults,\nand cause the initiation of a ``cascade of interactions'' in these\nolder adults, who already suffer from multiple comorbidities\n(29). Alternatively, polypharmacy increases the odds that the\naddition of any single medication to a frail older adult's\nregimen will cause a potentially adverse reaction in that\nindividual patient. Our results are of particular importance\ngiven the mounting pressure for ``recommended'' polyphar-\nmacy--that is, current disease-specific treatment guidelines\nthat are uniformly being recommended as indications of\n``quality'' care. The preponderance of evidence supporting\nguidelines was primarily developed in younger participant\npopulations without multiple comorbidities. Whether the risk\nof ``recommended polypharmacy'' outweighs the benefit is\nnot known. This study helps to provide some understanding\nabout the potential risk of polypharmacy. Finally, the\npolypharmacy rate in Mexican Americans may be lower\nthan that expected for non-Hispanic whites because Mexican\nAmericans use fewer over-the-counter medications (7).\nPotential ``inappropriate'' medication use did not appear to\nhave a mortality effect. Beer's criteria clearly state that many\nof the medications that fit the criteria for inappropriateness\nmay, in fact, be indicated in certain situations. Higashi and\ncolleagues (30) found that, among an ambulatory older adult\npopulation, pharmacologic management problems other than\ninappropriate medication prescribing were more common\nand potentially more important. Our results would seem to\nsupport the argument that medication monitoring, documen-\ntation, and continuity may be more important parameters to\nmonitor in older populations than reduction of inappropriate\nmedication use alone would be. More research is clearly\nneeded to more fully delineate these issues.\nInterestingly, potential major or moderate drug\u00addrug\ninteractions did not independently predict mortality in our\nparticipant population. Perhaps significant drug\u00addrug inter-\nactions increase morbidity and subsequent detection leading\nto discontinuation of the offending medications before the\ndrug combinations become lethal. An alternative explanation\nmay be that the potential for a drug\u00addrug interaction does\nTable 3. Adjusted Proportional Hazards Model: Drug Interaction, Polypharmacy, and Mortality\nVariable\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\nHazard Ratio (95% CI)\nDrug interaction\nPolypharmacy\nNote: CI \u00bc confidence interval; ADL \u00bc Activities of Daily Living.\nnot equal an actual interaction, and actual events may not\noccur frequently enough to establish a relationship between\npotential drug\u00addrug interaction and mortality. Further study\nis needed to better understand the role of adverse drug\u00addrug\ninteractions in morbidity and mortality of older adults.\nIt is also possible that increasing comorbidity and/or\ndisease severity leads to polypharmacy and adverse drug\ninteractions and that the primary mortality risk might be\nthe severity of illness and not polypharmacy or increased\nmedication use. However, polypharmacy remained a signif-\nicant independent predictor of mortality even when ADL\ndependency and poor self-reported health, standard proxies\nfor illness severity, were added to our model. A limitation of\nthis study is the self-reported nature of the interviews. We\ndid not determine medication compliance. Furthermore, it is\npossible that Mexican American elders might be differen-\ntially predisposed to polypharmacy-related mortality when\ncompared to the general population, but this predisposition\nwould have to be an effect exclusive of demographic fac-\ntors. We have previously found that Mexican American\nolder adults taking inappropriate medications tended to fit\nthe criteria for high vulnerability: unmarried, high physician\nutilization, depressed, and Medicare/Medicaid recipients\n(31). Another limitation was that underutilization was not\nexamined, which may in itself be an independent predictor\nof mortality. Finally, although the Micromedex system is a\nwidely used drug\u00addrug interaction clinical tool, to our knowl-\nedge, it has not been tested for the validity or reliability of\nthe drug\u00addrug interaction information provided.\nDespite these limitations, polypharmacy was the key\nsuboptimal medication independent predictor for mortality\nin the cohort of Mexican American older adults studied. Our\nresults indicate that increasing the number of medications\nalone may pose a long-term mortality risk, at least in the\nolder Mexican American population. Further research is\nneeded to confirm our findings.\n"
