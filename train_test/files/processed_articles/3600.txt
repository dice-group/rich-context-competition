Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are\nused as one of the first-choice drugs for patients with\nhypertension. Some studies reported thatARB user showed\ndecreased LC risk. However, other studies could not\nconfirm this result.5\u00ad12 Thus, the result is still controver-\nsial. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the rela-\ntionship between ARB and LC risk.\nMethods\nPublication search\nTwo researchers independently performed a computerized\nsearch in four databases up toApril 2015: PubMed, ISI Web\nof Knowledge, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure,\nAngiotensin receptor blockers use and\nthe risk of lung cancer: A meta-analysis\nWeizhen Zhang, Zhenyu Liang, Jing Li and Shaoxi Cai\n Keywords\nAngiotensin receptor blocker, lung cancer, association, meta-analysis\nDepartment of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chronic\nAirways Diseases Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical\nUniversity, Guangzhou, China\nCorresponding author:\nShaoxi Cai, Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,\nChronic Airways Diseases Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern\nChina.\nOriginal Article\nand Wanfang. The search terms were \"angiotensin receptor\nblocker\" or ARB, \"lung cancer or lung carcinoma or lung\nneoplasm\" in various combinations, with no language limi-\ntation. The reference list of each relevant publication was\nalso reviewed to ensure that all appropriate studies were\nincluded in the meta-analysis.\nStudy selection\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the research was\na case-control study or a cohort study; (2) the study investi-\ngated the association between ARB and LC risk; (3) suffi-\ncient published data about sample size, odds ratio (OR), and\ntheir 95% confidence interval (CI). Studies were excluded\nwhen they were: (1) a duplicate publication; (2) meta-\nanalyses, letters, reviews, or editorial articles.\nData extraction\nTwo reviewers collected the data and reached a consensus\non all items. The following items were extracted from each\nstudy if available: first author, year of publication, study\ndesign, ethnicity, age, gender, sample size, follow-up\nyears, and covariates.\nQualitative assessment\nTwo authors completed the quality assessment indepen-\ndently. The Newcastle\u00adOttawa Scale (NOS) was used to\nevaluate the methodological quality, which scored studies\nby the selection of the study groups, the comparability of\nthe groups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of inter-\nlow-, moderate-, or high-quality study, respectively.\nStatistical analysis\nThe strength of the association between ARB and the risk\nof LC was measured by OR and 95% CI. OR was analyzed\nby random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated by\nan 2-based Q statistic and was considered statistically sig-\nnificant when p < 0.10. The significance of the pooled OR\nwas determined by the Z-test and was considered statisti-\ncally when the p-value was less than 0.05. Subgroup analy-\nses by ethnic groups and follow-up years (less than 5 years\nor not) were performed. Publication bias was analyzed by\nfunnel plots and Egger's test. All statistical tests were per-\nformed using the Revman 5.1 and STATA 11.0 software.\nResults\nEligible studies\nmeta-analysis. Three studies were case-control studies\nand five studies were cohort studies. Three studies were\nconducted in Asian patients and four studies were per-\nformed in Caucasian patients. The median follow-up dura-\ntion ranged from 2.9 to 7.8 years. The quality score ranged\nfrom 7 to 9, suggesting that the quality of the studies was\ngood.

However,\nwhen we limited the meta-analysis to studies that con-\ntrolled for statins or smoking, the result was changed\n(Table 2).\nThe funnel plot and Egger's test were performed for the\noverall comparison. No obvious visual asymmetry was\nobserved in funnel plots (Figure 4), and the p-value of the\nEgger's test was greater than 0.05, indicating no statistical\nevidence for publication bias among studies.\nDiscussion\nThe present meta-analysis of eight observational studies\nshowed that the use of ARBs could decrease LC risk. This\nresult suggested that ARBs might be a protective factor for\nLC. However, this protective value was only found in\nAsians and not in Caucasians. It was possible that different\nlifestyles, diets, and environments may account for this\ndiscrepancy. In addition, we found that this protective\neffect might decrease if the duration of follow-up is more\nthan 5 years. This result indicated that time might modify\nthe effect of ARB on LC risk. Furthermore, we observed\nthat statin and smoking status could also modify the effect\nof ARB on LC risk.\nRAS signaling has been shown to increase cell prolif-\neration during malignancy, and ARBs are able to decrease\npro-survival signaling by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mole-\ncules and suppressing caspase activity.4 A previous study\n770 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nTable 1.

First, all the\nincluded studies were observational investigations and\ncannot thus support any causality between the use of ARB\nand LC risk. Second, the lack of the original data of the\neligible studies limited the evaluation of the effects of\nARB on different populations, such as smokers and non-\nsmokers. In addition, the subgroup analysis of statins was\nalso not conducted. Third, although we performed an\nextensive review of the main electronic databases, we can-\nnot be sure to have included all relevant studies.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that ARBs may\nbe associated with decreased risk of LC.
