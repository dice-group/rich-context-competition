Interaction is not neutral; rather, it is shaped by and revealing of the power rela-\ntions that exist between group members. Insofar as the characteristics that define the\nselection of participants are meaningful categories, the micro-dynamics of power that\nplay out in a focus group discussion are revealing of those that operate in the wider popu-\nlation. The ability to observe these power relations is a significant affordance of the\nmethod, and a major factor that would indicate its selection. However, focus group litera-\nture to date lacks a sufficient account of power. There is little theoretical grounding for\nor guidance on the analysis of power in focus group data. Further, literature on the con-\nduct of focus groups encourages strategies that serve to minimise power, and thus hide it\nfrom view.\nIn this article, I exemplify an approach to analysing focus group data, with implica-\ntions for the conduct of discussions, drawing on Bourdieu's notion of fields of power.\nParticipants, I argue, are implicated in positional relations of power which shape their\ninteractions with each other and, in turn, how knowledge is discursively produced. I\ndraw on data from a study that used focus group discussions to explore national identity\nwith the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK. I identify three mechanisms which have\nimplications for the guidance on conducting focus group discussions: the selection of\nparticipants, the style of facilitation, and the positionality of the researcher/facilitator.\nInteraction and power in focus group discussions\nFocus groups, broadly defined as `facilitated group activity'(Kamberelis and Dimitriadis,\n2013: 6), provide an arena for `performances in which the participants jointly produce\naccounts about topics in a socially organised situation' (Smithson, 2000: 105; Smithson,\n2008). They are semi-informal spaces where participants, knowingly observed by the\nfacilitator and (usually) inscribed by a recording device, rehearse social relations. These\nperformative interactions are mediated versions of the everyday interactions that may\ntake place without the intervention of the researcher. As a group-based method, interac-\ntion between participants is essential to the generation of data. However, there are mark-\nedly differing understandings of the epistemological function of this interaction.\nA substantial school of focus group research treats interaction as a means of eliciting\nmore in-depth content. From this perspective, focus group discussions are viewed as means\nof `obtaining'participants'pre-existing, personal ideas and opinions, and thus form a `win-\ninteraction, proponents suggest, serves an instrumental role in data production by bringing\nabout a `synergy'that elicits `rich details'(Carey and Asbury, 2012: 28). This stimulates `a\nmore complete picture of attitudes' through provoking agreement and disagreement\n(Greenbaum, 1998: 143), and drawing out more sensitive data from participants (Morrison-\nBeedy et al., 2001). While interaction is key to the collection of good quality data, it has\ndone its work, for better or worse, from the moment the voice recorder stops.\nThis content-driven approach to focus group data has been criticised by researchers\nwho accord interaction a more wide-ranging role. Following Jenny Kitzinger's (1994)\nlandmark article, a competing school has emerged giving a more nuanced explanation of\nthe collective dimension of sense-making that participants engage in. By this account,\nfocus group discussions themselves constitute a social context, and interactive processes\nare therefore open to direct observation (Wilkinson, 1998; Wilkinson, 2004; Madriz,\ndata, and the content of the data indivisible from the social process that produces it.\nThe beginnings of an approach that allows space for power are evident in Kitzinger's\nearly article. She writes:\nInteractions can make groups seem unruly . . . but such `undisciplined' outbursts are not\nirrelevant or simply obstructive to the collection of data . . . Everyday forms of communication\n. . . may tell us as much, if not more, about what people `know'. (Kitzinger, 1994: 109)\nAlthough power is not centralised, an integrative approach to content and interaction\nimplies allowing sufficient space for it to be expressed. However, guidance on the con-\nduct of focus groups remains rooted in the content-driven perspective. Although there is\nlittle explicit treatment of power, it crops up incidentally around two fields of claim: the\nrelationship between participants, and the relationship between participants and the\nresearcher/facilitator.\nThe mainstream guidance literature describes power differentials between focus\ngroup participants as a `plague' resulting in what is constructed as `problem behaviour'\nas a procedural problem that sabotages interaction and therefore limits data quality - for\nexample, through preventing the establishment of group rapport, creating reticence to\nshare or self-censoring, encouraging conformity and silencing (Stewart and Shamdasani,\nserve to minimise the dynamics of power in focus group discussions. Firstly, the skilled\nfacilitator may exercise covert and explicit control strategies: for example, through room\nlayout, body language, seating positions, selective eye contact, interruption, direct chal-\nand Asbury, 2012). Secondly, the selection of `homogenous' participants, who are likely\nto share more because they perceive each other as similar (Carey and Asbury, 2012;\nGreenbaum, 1998). Taken to the extreme, these measures would produce a heavily sani-\ntised discussion which leaves little space for the observation of everyday interaction,\nmuch less any insight into power dynamics within the group.\nThe relation of the participants to the researcher/facilitator makes an important con-\ntribution to the creation of a `permissive environment' which encourages free-flowing\nconversation among participants (Krueger and Casey, 2015: 2, 4; CPRC, n.d.). Focus\ngroup discussions are often described as relatively egalitarian, due to participants'\nnumerical advantage and their collective power through shared knowledge of the subject\nperceptions of the researcher/facilitator's authority position and personal attributes\nendow them with a disproportionate influence over the discussion (Stewart and\nShamdasani, 1990; Krueger, 1998). However skilled the facilitation, some sources of\npower asymmetry are innate and self-evident. In some studies, particularly with tradi-\ntionally marginalised groups, researchers have found that authentic sharing is encour-\naged where the facilitator shares a significant aspect of culture or experience with the\ngroup members (Rodriguez et al., 2011; Fallon and Brown, 2002; Caretta and Vacchelli,\n2015). Others have found that techniques to de-centre the researcher have served to miti-\ngate issues of positionality and power differential (Jakobsen, 2012). In either case, the\nposition of the researcher/facilitator as an implicitly powerful out-group member is pre-\nsented as a problem to be overcome.\nWithout an explicit theoretical foundation for the micro-dynamics of power in focus\ngroup discussions, recommended practice tends towards the reduction of power between\nparticipants and between participants and the researcher. This serves to manipulate par-\nticipants' performances away from `everyday forms of communication,' and censors an\nimportant aspect of social relations out of the data.\nThe study\nSouth Sudan seceded from Sudan on 9 July 2011, granting international recognition and\nlegitimacy for the collectivity that had long been imagined by Southerners (LeRiche and\nArnold, 2012). At independence South Sudan inherited a `fledgling national identity'\nbased on the `common struggle for recognition, dignity, and equal rights' (Awolich,\n2015: 1, 6). It was also clear that a process of nation-building was urgently needed (Jok,\n2013 fighting broke out between troops in Juba1, sparking a civil war that has been tragi-\ncally characterised by the deliberate targeting of civilians and forced exodus of over two\nmillion refugees, with a further 1.9m people internally displaced (figures from November\nThe new crisis of national identity that South Sudanese citizens now face is particu-\nlarly problematic for groups geographically dislocated from the homeland that confers\ntheir political rights and who, as such, are subject to further discrimination and margin-\nalisation (Zambakari, 2015). This study explored how a specific group of South Sudanese\ncitizens \u00ad the diaspora in the UK \u00ad jointly articulated their national identity after five\nyears of independence, and against the troubling historical-social-political backdrop I\nhave briefly described.\nThe work of identity negotiation and sense-making in light of present conditions was\nsomething that I believed to be going on amongst the South Sudanese diaspora, but as a\nwhite British woman I did not have natural access to these conversations. Focus group\ndiscussions provided a means of inviting members of the diaspora to model their think-\ning-in-process for an external audience. Directly, this audience comprised a research\nassistant, who was also white British and who took notes to aid transcription, and myself;\nindirectly, it included the possible academic and non-academic audiences of my research,\nof whom participants were aware. Although I was the sole facilitator at times, as I will\nexamine below, participants spontaneously supported my facilitation efforts by asking\nquestions of each other, praising and encouraging constructive contributions and chastis-\ning behavior they perceived to be inappropriate to the setting.\nThe impetus behind the study came from a set of recent-historic photographic images\ndepicting visual-verbal displays of national identity, such as banners, posters, t-shirts and\nplacards photographed in South Sudan during the three months prior to the referendum.\nThese photographs formed a focal point in the discussions through elicitation activities I\ninstigated and acting as spontaneous points of reference for participants. I facilitated two\nfocus groups, one with men (4 members) and one with women (8 members), all of whom\nare adult South Sudanese citizens (including those with dual citizenship) and usually\nreside in the UK. They were recruited through the networks of a cultural community\nassociation. Discussions took place in either a community building familiar to partici-\npants, or one of the participants' homes, in June 2016. They were audio recorded and\nlater transcribed, with some minor abridgement to protect the identity of participants.\nThe South Sudanese diaspora is a relatively small and highly connected network in\nthe UK. As a consequence, and particularly in light of the mode of recruitment, partici-\npants were embedded in existing relationships to each other. Where focus groups involve\npre-existing groups, this can provide greater access to everyday conversations, tapping\ninto group life that exists independently of the research (Bloor et al., 2001; Kitzinger,\ncontext is innately artificial by virtue of the researcher-facilitator's initiation, presence,\ntasking, and prerogative to intervene, and is rightly conceived as `somewhere between a\nmeeting and a conversation' (Agar and MacDonald, 1995: 80; Caretta and Vacchelli,\n2015; Morgan, 1998). The use of English, under the advice of gatekeepers, as the lan-\nguage of discussions further distinguished them from everyday interactions within the\ncommunity.\nPower and performance in focus group discussions: a\nBourdieusian approach\nIn both focus group discussions, individual and communal power was contested as par-\nticipants attempted to position themselves in response to both my questions and contri-\nbutions by others, asserting, relinquishing and conferring influence, and problematizing\nthe basis for their corporate empowerment or disempowerment. I have found Bourdieu's\ntheory of fields of power provides a useful vocabulary for understanding the social prac-\ntices that were in play in these discussions.\nFor Bourdieu, inequality is a fundamental aspect of how social space is organised, as:\nan ensemble of invisible relations . . . which constitute a space of positions external to each\nother and defined by their proximity to, neighbourhood with, or distance from each other, and\nalso by their relative position, above or below or yet in between. (Bourdieu, 1989: 16)\nHe uses the notion of `field' as his overarching metaphor to theorise how power struc-\ntures the objective positions of agents (individuals, groups and institutions). Fields are\nmulti-level, `nested' sites of struggle (Wacquant, 2013: 276) which operate semi-inde-\npendently at four levels: the field of power, the general field under examination, the\nspecific field, and the agents within that field constituting a field in themselves (Thomson,\n2012). The criteria by which focus group participants are selected projects the existence\nof fields at these levels. In this study, since the focus was national identity and belonging,\nparticipants are located in national-community fields at the macro level of the general\nfield. At the meso level of the specific field, the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK\nforms a semi-autonomous field with its own internal dynamics and admission criteria. At\nthe micro level, by virtue of being drawn from a shared field with a specific focus, a\nparticular resource at stake (knowledge) and with relatively stable boundaries (set by\nwho is invited and the limited time available), participants in a focus group discussion\nform a field in themselves.\nAlthough distinct from one another, Bourdieu suggested that fields are homologous,\nwhich he defined as bearing a `resemblance within a difference'(Bourdieu and Wacquant,\n1992: 106): they share similarly patterned and predictable practices and similar kinds of\nagents dominate in each social field (Thomson, 2012). Attention, therefore, to the mic-\nropolitical, routinized exercise of power in group discussions has the potential to reveal\nglobal regularities of power within the population from which participants are purpo-\nsively sampled. If these micro-dynamics of power are observed and allowed to play out,\nanalysis may reveal how these dynamics are implicated in the topic under discussion\n(Morley, 1999; Blase, 1991). This is only possible if the groups are conducted in a way\nthat allows sufficient space for power.\nIn the following analysis, I use aspects of Bourdieu's theory of fields to illustrate how\npower operated in these focus group discussions, and what implications this has for the\nguidance literature. Participants' names have been changed to pseudonyms of their\nchoosing.\nDefending, contesting and relinquishing the rules of the game\nBourdieu uses the analogy of a game to describe the operation of relations within a field. The\nspecific logic of practice within a particular field is governed by rules or, better, `regularities'\nwhich are embraced by players who, by the very act of playing, `accord . . . that its stakes are\nimportant . . . and worth pursuing' (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 116). Agents may resist\nthrough attempts to change the `tacit rules'of the game (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 99).\nHowever, more frequently they will use strategies to transform the field and their position\nwithin it within the `rules of the game,' although doing so inadvertently serves to reinforce\nIn the context of a focus group, for a discussion to be successful the researcher/facili-\ntator hopes that participants will be `taken in by the game' of knowledge co-production\nand will `collude' in its construction (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 98). Some of the\n`rules' that apply are inferred from the semi-informality of the setting \u00ad in this case, con-\nventional practices familiar to meetings in the UK, such as speaking in turn, submitting\nto the chair's direction and staying for the duration. Others are explicitly stated in the\nverbal invitation to participate, the written participant information sheet and the verbal\nbriefing/introduction to the discussion. By these means, the researcher/facilitator makes\nclear their expectation that participants will engage in discussion with others about the\nimposed topic and that everyone will have equal chance to speak. An unintended conse-\nquence of consent processes is that participants `sign up' to play according to the stated\nrules of the game. At different times, participants in the diaspora focus groups defended,\ncontested and relinquished the `rules of the game.'\nDefending the `rules of the game' included participants explicitly clarifying what was\nexpected of them, challenging each other when another member deviated from respond-\ning to a question that had been asked or spoke in a language other than English, advocat-\ning on someone else's behalf when they were interrupted so that they could finish what\nthey were saying, or affirming my role as `chair,' encouraging others to respond to my\ninterventions.\nThe following excerpt took place about mid-way through the men's discussion, and\nexemplifies both contestation and defence of the `rules of the game.' Other participants\nhad previously challenged Bel Pen about the length of his contributions, which they\nconsidered to be inequitable given the parameters of time. We were mid-way through an\nactivity where each member of the group chose a photograph that particularly struck\nthem. Bel Pen had chosen a picture but instead of describing it he had offered a reinter-\npretation of a personal account another participant had given, sparking some debate. This\nexchange follows my intervention to return to the activity and ensure other members also\nhad the opportunity to choose a picture:\nBel Pen: I haven't finished. You want me to finish, or that is okay?\nRachel:\nOh, yeah, if you want to say something [particularly about that\nimage . . .\nBel Pen: [Because I was never allowed to finish . . . My contribution\nRachel: I'm sorry \u00ad it's because we have a limited time, you know?\nBel Pen: (laughs)\nPaul:\nWhen you hear the record here (gestures to voice recorder) you are\nthe one, [your voice is . . .\nBel Pen:\n[It's not about the time you are talking, it is about how much can you\ngive as a good contribution to this research . . . for example. And if\nyou cannot definitely when you talk more it means you have more\ninformation. And if you talk less it means you are satisfied with the\nfew information that you give. So here . . .\nJohn: That's an interesting way of looking at it Bel Pen.\n(laughter)\nJohn: But carry on.\nRachel: We can maybe debate that one later \u00ad tell us about that picture.\nBel Pen:\nReally, these little girls here [Amos: Yeah; Rachel: Yeah] had the\nfeeling like me that this means peace, it means there will be no\nbombing, no fighting, nothing at all [. . .] And she was right, and she\nwas right. Whatever happened after that, whatever war you guys had\ndone after that, that was not in, in, in her mind, completely. She was\nfree, she was free like me, on that day.\nAmos: Good point.\nJohn: Mmhmmm.\nAt this and various points in the discussion, it seemed that Bel Pen was working to a dif-\nferent set of regulations which caused ongoing conflict within the group. He valued\nspeaking at length without interruption and often made comments on a range of issues on\nhis way to reaching his main point. For Bel Pen, the capacity to make what he perceived\nto be a more informative contribution to the topic was of greater importance than allow-\ning even contributions between participants, and so he contests their attempts to defend\nthe `rules of the game' as they saw them. However, he proceeds to complete the task of\ndescribing his chosen photograph, and this adherence to the `rule'of answering questions\nis endorsed and encouraged by Amos and John, as well as myself.\nAlthough silence is a normal feature of social interaction (Smithson, 2000), prolonged\nor deliberate silence can be a means of relinquishing the `rules of the game' through\nasserting the power to not speak. In the women's discussion, one participant made only\none contribution, which was in response to my direct request for her to describe the pho-\ntograph she had chosen:\nAchol:\nWhy when people talk about Sudan I keep quiet, because it makes\nmy body, my head, my bottom, my heart (gestures), because I am\nvery happy when er, we got er, referendum I though we going,\nbecause the people died in Sudan not me. A lot people lose their\npeople. A lot people. Any qabayla.\nNyanpath: Any tribe.\nAchol: Innit. But me, what, what, what.\nNyanpath:\nWhen you say `what' like that, her close relatives, were killed one\nday.\nWith the support of her peers, Achol eloquently describes the physical manifestation of\nher emotional suffering as a result of the post-2013 internal conflict in South Sudan in\nwhich her family members have been killed. Although she did go on to comment on the\npicture she had chosen, she maintained her silence for the remainder of the discussion.\nSilence can be a culture-bound and context-bound coping strategy which it is important\nto recognise, understand and respect (Tankink and Richters, 2007; Brun, 2013) \u00ad even if\nthis means contributions between participants will be uneven.\nIf we treat the performance of power relations as a useful aspect of data, this poses\ninteresting questions for the approach to facilitation. When participants contest or relin-\nquish the stated or implied `rules of the game', should the facilitator enforce them, make\nexceptions to them, adapt them, or abandon them? In order to allow space for power, the\nresearcher/facilitator will generally prefer to be as unobtrusive as possible, which sug-\ngests a minimum of control. However, where participants have different understandings\nof the `rules of the game'this can generate conflict. The skill of facilitation, then, becomes\nto leave as much space for a variety of forms of interaction as possible, whilst maintain-\nIn searching for this balance, the examples described above yield some insights.\nFirstly, rather than dismissing some participants' behaviour as `problematic,' `domi-\nnant' or `unruly,' it is more informative to attend to the different sources of `rules' that\nparticipants follow and to acknowledge these as worthy of interest in their own right.\nSecondly, facilitators can be responsive to the group's self-moderation. This allows\nparticipants to determine what practices are acceptable and unacceptable and the\nresearcher/facilitator can observe this process of negotiation. Finally, focus group\npractitioners need to have a clear awareness of the parameters that we take for granted\nand those that we impose, implicitly and explicitly. By questioning these, it becomes\npossible to apply them flexibly, and to open as many `rules' as possible to negotiation\nwith participants.\nNegotiating a game of shifting stakes\nFields are arenas of struggle for valued resources, or `capitals,' the relative values of\nwhich differ between fields, and it is this process of valuing that differentiates between\nfields and between agents within fields (Grenfell and Hardy, 2007). Those forms of capi-\ntal that are recognised as at stake in a particular field hold `ace card' status (Bourdieu,\n1989: 17). These are transformed into symbolic capital, the monopoly of which confers\nsymbolic power: the `legitimate mode of perception' that yields the capacity to name, to\ncategorise, and to impose recognition, thus consolidating existing social arrangements\nWithin focus group discussions, the resource at stake is knowledge relating to the topic\nat hand. The right to speak, and the authority with which one's contributions should be\nweighted, are a space of contestation. Participants draw on other resources which confer, or\ndiminish, either their own or others' authority to speak. Due to the homologous relation\nbetween multi-level, nested fields, the resources that are mobilised within a focus group\ndiscussion are related to those that carry weight in the specific field and the general field.\nConversely, participants occasionally make explicit statements about power hierarchies,\nand the resources that underpin them, in the general/specific fields. These shed light on the\ncategories that influence participants' performances of power in focus group interaction.\nAttention to both overt statements and the bases on which participants valorise or down-\nplay contributions within the discussion shed light on relationally valued capitals.\nIn the men's group, an explicit discussion arose around the position of the specific\nfield \u00ad the South Sudanese diaspora \u00ad in the general field of South Sudanese society.\nFollowing a question posed by John exploring the relative influence of the Western dias-\npora, Amos outlines the basis for their shared marginalisation within the general field of\nSouth Sudanese society. He argues that `a complete class system has already developed',\nwith (ex-)soldiers who fought in the SPLA2 at the top, followed by those civilians who\nremained in South Sudan during the war, then the East African diaspora, and finally `the\nlast people at the bottom' are the Western diaspora:\nAmos:\nCause they say, `You ran away, neither did you join the war front, nor\ndid you stay under the bombs, when we were being shelled,' or\nstarved, or whatever.\nAmos' discourse identifies the efficacy of certain resources in gaining recognition, influ-\nence and position in South Sudanese society. These relate to direct participation in the\nfreedom struggle, physical presence within or proximity to the homeland, and participa-\ntion in suffering. Within the discussion, criteria emerging from this structure were refer-\nence points by which participants evaluated the authority of contributions to the discussion.\nNone had been soldiers; however, those who had spent a significant amount of time living\nin South Sudan referred to this as a basis for their superior knowledge. Those who had\nspent relatively little of their adult life in South Sudan worked hard to demonstrate how\nphysical absence did not prevent them from being deeply connected to the land and the\npeople \u00ad for example, through regular visits, frequent contact with wide networks in their\nhome community, use of Sudanese Arabic and through up-to-date knowledge about what\nis happening in the country through personal contacts and monitoring blogs, national tel-\nevision and other news media. At different times, participants appealed to their connec-\ntions with family and wider community networks in South Sudan:\nJohn: I wasn't around in Kokora3 days, all I know is everything I hear, okay?\nSimilarly, Paul commented:\nPaul:\nThere are so many history that South Sudanese people don't know \u00ad it\nis unwritten. I tell what I also hear from others.\nBy identification with their home communities, participants could share in the legitimised\nknowledge-base of those networks. Participants in discussions referred to other categories\nwhich conferred (or diminished) either their own or others'authority to speak: deference to\nage, valuing of education, and historical-political literacy. This exchange follows from a\ndiscussion of the likelihood of external intervention providing a successful solution to the\nconflict, in particular by ensuring there is justice for human rights violations:\nLiz:\nThis er, joint monitoring and evaluation [\u00b9commission \u00ad they are not\ndoing it because (Public figure A) [\u00b2is threatening them.\nShola:\n[\u00b9Ah they are not doing anything\nCynthia: [\u00b2They are not doing anything\nShola: (Public figure A) is threatening them.\nLiz: They are threatening them.\nNyanpath: Eh!\nLiz: They are doing nothing.\nShola: (Public figure A), (Public figure B), er . . . and that, that other one.\nNyanpath: (Public figure C)\nLamba:\nMama mama you are really clever, you know all of them! Me I\ndon't know anybody!\nLiz, Shola, Cynthia and Nyanpath share knowledge of current political initiatives and the\nbarriers to their success, including the interventions of key political figures. When Lamba\ninterjects, she singles out Nyanpath, an elder in the group, and after respectfully address-\ning her as such she praises her for her political knowledge and, through juxtaposition,\ndevalues her own ability to contribute. Traditional aspects of culture remain important;\nnevertheless, the rapid emergence of South Sudan as a modern state since 2005 has cre-\nated a state of flux. This uncertainty as to the `stakes of the game' has opened opportuni-\nties for agents to creatively mobilise new categories. During an early monologue about\nhow she was happy to be separated from the North due to the inequalities South Sudanese\nexperienced, Oliba makes this argument:\nOliba:\nBut now, we are alone, we're still suffering, I don't know until when .\n. . because I am non-educated, I am non-politician, I'm talking as a\nprimitive woman. But, without primitive, who can vote you to come as\na President? Those people without an education is the one, they use it.\nAnd then brought them up.\nAlthough Oliba classifies herself in relation to her lack of education and position, she turns\nthis negative assessment on its head through identifying with the power of those lacking in\neducation, through democratic processes, to elect the President, and conversely his depend-\nence on their votes to be `brought up' to his position. The sense of agency and dignity that\nshe expresses as a voting citizen directly challenges her self-appraisal as a `primitive\nwoman' that would traditionally have marginalised her right to speak.\nComparative attention to the expressed bases of power in the general/specific field and\nthe categories to which participants give credence in assessing the relevance of contribu-\ntions is a useful analytic device. It enables insight into processes of valuing capitals that\nstructure power relations in the field of the focus group, as well as in the specific and gen-\neral fields which form the substantive interest of the study. This is only possible through\nengaging participants who are different in key respects. However, as I have discussed,\nguidance recommends that participants are `homogenous,'in order to reduce any `interfer-\nence'by power differences. True homogeneity between participants, of course, never really\nexists (Kitzinger, 1994). In this study, for example, I held separate groups with men and\nwomen to accommodate gendered patterns of social interaction. I could have made further\nsub-divisions - for example, by age, level of education, duration of residence outside South\nSudan or to separate out the narratives of different ethnic communities. However, this\nwould have reduced the potential for power to be observable. By allowing the heterogene-\nity that exists in the specific field to be reflected in the composition of groups, the resources\nthat effectively conferred power became evident. This enabled participants to negotiate\nover the relative value of these resources and discursively reconcile differences. A better\nprinciple of focus group sampling is commonality, rather than homogeneity. This shifts the\npriority from eliminating power to creating a sub-field that captures some of the diversity\nof the wider field of interest from which participants are drawn. Indeed, through allowing\nheterogeneity within commonality, participants themselves can theorise about why diver-\nsity, expressed through dissent, exists, and how this affects them.\nMobilising the boundaries of the field\nFields are conceived as relatively stable, where the specific logic of the field and those\ncapitals legitimised in it provide clear boundaries by which agents are recognised or\nexcluded from participation. Nevertheless, Bourdieu suggests that there are relationships\nof exchange between fields, and the boundaries of the field themselves are sites of contesta-\ntion (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992). In a focus group discussion, I have suggested that the\nsampling criteria postulate shared characteristics between participants which are commen-\nsurate with their positioning within a specific field, of which the focus group is a sub-field.\nWho is present and the time that is allotted make the boundaries of the space fairly stable;\nhowever, depending on their own positionality in relation to the research focus, the\nresearcher-facilitator may be positioned within, at the margins of, or outside this field.\nWithin this discussion, my positionality was an anomaly as I was not part of the field\nfrom which participants were drawn \u00ad the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK. Therefore,\nalthough I clearly had a role in the sub-field of the focus group discussion, my position in\nit could not follow the same logic as participants' positions in relation to each other.\nParticipants frequently made great efforts, without prompting, to include me through\nexplaining cultural references, filling in historical background, and translating when oth-\ners made use of Arabic. These useful interventions included me in their community of\nunderstanding, whilst highlighting my distinctness from it. They also emphasised our\ncommonality as citizens/residents of the UK, with a shared understanding of the political\nfreedoms and processes we enjoy. In an early monologue, for example, Bel Pen used our\nshared understanding of the rights held by UK citizens/residents to humorously relay his\ndiscovery of these privileges when he arrived in the UK, implicitly drawing a contrast\nwith the unfamiliarity of such freedoms for South Sudanese citizens who have not expe-\nrienced transnational migration:\nBel Pen:\nAnd then when I came here I found that there were like . . . oh equal\nrights for blacks, and women, and different religions, they are all\ndisplayed here. And I asked myself, `Can I be free in this country?\nCan I be equal to anybody? Oh!' When I got the British passport, `Is\nmy passport, this passport, the same that is the same passport the\nQueen has? Is this true?! I cannot believe it! . . . Oh! I am a human\nbeing! Oh! I cannot believe it!' You can never find this in, in the\nSudan.\nParticipants were also aware that I had been to Juba, and generously assumed a certain\namount of knowledge on my part \u00ad for example, while relaying how a demonstration in\nWau4 had been violently quelled Cynthia inserted, `I'm sure you heard about the incident\nthat happened recently'. Through these measures, participants actively diluted the\nboundaries of the field to include me within the sub-field of the discussion that they were\nconstructing.\nNevertheless, participants were able to mobilise the boundaries of the field through\nusing my outsider presence to strengthen a rhetorical purpose. This forms part of a\nresponse by Cynthia to my question about what connects members of the group person-\nally to each other:\nCynthia:\nAaahhhh, I have to start! (general laughter) Oh I have to start! I\nthink it means identity. It means home. We don't go home often [. .\n.] So, this is to to me the South Sudanese community here is like, er,\ner, a glimpse of home. You know? And um they, I, I run to them for\nsupport, just to talk the language. And, and, and I don't have to\nmake up myself. Like if I'm, I'm going to speak to a white lady for\nyou for example, oh God, I have to push all these things in a cup-\nboard in my head, so I do not have to express myself. But with them,\nI just feel at home.\nNyanpath: <click>\nCynthia:\nYou understand? So, yeah, it's everything. It's what keeps me going.\nYou haven't been in a foreign land, it's tough. Different culture.\nDifferent faith. Even all this freedom, sometimes too much freedom\nis, is (laughing) even scary.\nLiz: Is a problem.\nCynthia, with supportive interjections from Nyanpath and Liz, builds a compelling pic-\nture of shared identity within the diasporic community, which is enriched through the\ncontrast between their experiences and my position as an indigenous British woman.\nThrough naming the racial-cultural and migratory boundaries of the field, Cynthia is able\nto persuasively elucidate the basis of their solidarity by drawing attention to my privilege\noutside of the conditions of self-censorship and marginalisation that they tolerate. Thus\na flexible and shifting orientation to the boundaries of the field is a useful device which\nparticipants can enlist to perform ideological work.\nAlthough with some communities and in relation to some topics it may be prefera-\nble for the focus group facilitator to be a relative in-group member, it is clear that the\nsame person occupies multiple real and perceived positionalities. The fact of the facili-\ntator's distinctive role in the group and the implications this has in terms of their cre-\ndentials necessarily distinguish them from other participants. Where there is a\nparticularly steep power gradient between participants and the facilitator, such as\nacross majority/minority world difference, this can override the researcher/facilitator's\nattempts to reposition herself (Jakobsen, 2012). In this case, as a clear outsider, partici-\npants had the opportunity to cast me in a variety of roles: as a chair, a safe third party\n(Kelman, 2005), a witness, an ally, a conduit to a wider audience, and a student in need\nof instruction. Further, they mobilised the porous and dynamic boundaries of the field\nto include and exclude me at different points in the discussion. From a field perspec-\ntive, `insider' and `outsider' are negotiable categories. Participants can use their indis-\nputable position within the field to foreground aspects of the researcher/facilitator's\nidentity that enable them to accomplish rhetorical tasks. The apparent status of the\nresearcher/facilitator is not as important as the way that boundaries are creatively\nextended and contracted by participants, and to what end.\nConclusion\nPower is an inevitable facet of social life and the fields of power from which focus\ngroup participants are purposively drawn. It is therefore not only inevitable that power\nwill be manifest in focus group discussions \u00ad it is desirable. I have argued that power\nis under-theorised in focus group methodology, and undervalued as a rationale for\nselecting the method. There lacks a conceptual framework to enable the analysis of\npower in focus group data, and the guidelines on focus group conduct treat power as\na procedural problem to be minimised and mitigated. This serves to conceal an impor-\ntant aspect of social relations, and distorts the interaction that the researcher/facilita-\ntor seeks to observe.\nNevertheless, approaches that take seriously the importance of interaction in focus\ngroup discussions lay crucial groundwork for making the most of focus groups'\ncapacity for revealing power. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of fields of power provides a\nflexible `thinking tool' to open up this opportunity. The homologous relationship\nbetween multiple, nested fields suggests that the micro-dynamics of power that are\nperformed in focus group discussions are revealing of those that pertain in the wider\npopulation from which participants are drawn. To the extent that the field theorised\nthrough sampling characteristics is meaningful, field mechanisms are likely to be\npresent in focus group discussions. Therefore, mechanisms such as the `rules of the\ngame', the valuing of capitals, and the boundaries of the field provide useful analyti-\ncal tools to understand the dynamics of power within focus groups. During the course\nof focus group discussions, participants lay claim to power, surrender it, confer it on\nothers, negotiate its bases, harness its dynamics to strengthen a rhetorical purpose,\nand reinforce or question its corporate experience. The way that these processes play\nout is not only important for understanding the kind of data that focus groups pro-\nduce: it provides valuable insights into the relational significance of the substantive\ntopic that is the focus of discussions.\nAn approach which centralises power requires some rethinking of the standard guid-\nance for the conduct of focus group discussions. Received wisdom on approaches to\nfacilitation, sampling and the position of the researcher/facilitator is geared towards pro-\nducing content rather than co-privileging interaction. The observation of power requires\nsufficient space for its performance by participants in a social situation that is semi-\ninformal \u00ad both structured and familiar. This can be achieved through flexible facilitation\nthat enables negotiation of the `rules'that researchers impose; through recruitment based\non commonality; and through attention to the multiple, flexible positionalities of facilita-\ntors and how these are mobilised. Such measures shift the conduct of focus groups away\nfrom control towards the managed cultivation of field conditions. There are very few\nareas of social scientific study where the social implications of power are not of interest.\nThe reorientation of focus group methods towards allowing space for the micro-dynam-\nics of power to be observed is the next key area for literature concerning both the conduct\nand analysis of focus groups to explore.\n"
