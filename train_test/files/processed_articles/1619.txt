Adolescents also\ngain increased control over their own food choices (1) and often\nacquire poor dietary patterns such as skipping breakfast (2, 3) and\nrely on eating fast foods (4, 5) or regularly eating meals outside\nthe home (4). These habits could translate into consumption of\nenergy-dense or nutrient-poor diets (6) that potentially contrib-\nuted to overweight.\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nwere overweight and 17.6% were obese (7). In adolescents,\nobesity increases the risks of diseases that were previously seen\nmostly in adults, including hyperlipidemia (8), hypertension (9),\nmetabolic syndrome (10), and type 2 diabetes (11). Overweight in\nadolescence may serve as a harbinger of adult disease (8). Thus, it\nis important to understand the factors associated with overweight\nin adolescents.\nFew studies have looked at broad eating patterns, such as\nsnacking, and their associations with weight. Snacking was\nshown to be associated with increased energy intake (12), par-\nticularly in adolescents (13). Snacking may be an important\nstrategy for meeting energy needs for increased physical activity\nand for meeting recommended intakes of shortfall nutrients that\ncannot be met with the consumption of only 3 meals/d (14),\nparticularly in populations at nutritional risk (15). Snacking\ncontributed an estimated 25% of dietary energy and contributed\nsignificantly to nutrient intake (12, 14, 16) and the improvement\nof diet quality; snacking also increased the likelihood of meeting\nselected national food recommendations (12, 14). However, the\nincreased energy intake associated with snacking may reflect the\nenergy density and portion sizes of foods and beverages con-\nsumed as snacks (13, 17, 18). Snacks tend to be lower in fat and\nhigher in carbohydrates than meals (19\u00ad21); however, snacking\nmay contribute to energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets (22).\n1 From the Food & Nutrition Database Research Inc, Okemos, MI (DRK);\nthe US Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Children's\nNutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of\nMedicine, Houston, TX (TAN); and the Louisiana State University AgCen-\nter, Baton Rouge, LA (CON).\n2 This work is a publication of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/\nAgricultural Research Service Children's Nutrition Research Center, Depart-\nment of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine.

The Booth hypothesis (23) states that \"grazing,\" or multiple\neating episodes between meals, rather than the traditional pattern\nof 3 meals/d is a major factor that contributes to obesity. Contrary\nto the Booth hypothesis, Fabry et al (24) showed that the con-\nsumption of food more frequently throughout the day by adults\nwas negatively associated with body fatness compared with the\nassociation for subjects who restricted their intake to 1or 2 meals/d.\nMore research is needed to establish the role of snacking in the\nenergy balance and maintenance of body weight. Results from\ncross-sectional (12) and longitudinal (22) studies are equivocal.\nSome research suggested that an increased snack frequency was\nnegatively associated with body weight (25); however, others\nhave shown that snacking was not associated with weight (12, 22)\nand was not an independent predictor of weight gain (26). More\nstudies are needed to understand if snacking plays a role in\noverweight within the context of the overall diet. The aims of this\nstudy were to examine the associations of snacking frequency\nwith overweight and abdominal obesity in adolescents.\nStudy population\nData from adolescents 12\u00ad18 y of age who participated in the\nbined for these analyses. Pregnant or lactating girls were ex-\ncluded from the analyses. This study was exempted by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the Louisiana State University\nAgricultural Center.\nDietary assessment\nDietary data were obtained from 24-h recalls. Detailed\ndescriptions of the dietary interview methods are provided in the\nNHANES Dietary Interviews Procedure Manual, which includes\npictures of the computer-assisted dietary interview system\nscreens, measurement guides, and charts used to collect dietary\ninformation (27). Adolescents whose 24-h recall data were\njudged to be incomplete or unreliable by staff of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD) were excluded\nfrom these analyses.\nEating occasions were defined as a group of foods or beverages\nconsumed at the same time (hour:minute). The self-reported\nname of the eating occasion type was used to identify eating\noccasions that were called a snack in either the English version or\nSpanish translation of the questionnaire. The Spanish translation\nof a snack included the following: merienda (afternoon snack or\ntea), entre comida (between meals), tentempie (snack or bite to\neat), botana (snack), or bocadillo (snack or bite). Although each\nof the different named occasion types, including both snacks and\nearlier data sets, drinks were combined with snacks and given\nthe same code. Therefore, to manually separate snacks from\neach occasion (a group of foods or beverages consumed at the\nsame time) that was called a snack or drink was classified as\na snack that consisted of food accompanied by a beverage,\na snack that consisted of food consumed with no beverage, or\na drink that consisted of a beverage consumed with no food.\nThe snacking frequency (ie, a count of the number of snacks\nconsumed per day) and the percentage of total daily energy intake\ncontributed from snacks were measured. Adolescents were\nclassified by snacking frequency and the percentage of energy\nfrom snacks to form 2 sets of snack consumption groups as\nadolescents who ate snacks that contributed 0%, ,10%, 10\u00ad\nintakes.\nAnthropometric assessment\nThe Anthropometry Procedures Manual (28) used in the\ninformation about equipment, calibration, methods, quality\ncontrol, and survey procedures. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as body weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.\nThe percentile of BMI-for-age was calculated with the Statistical\nAnalysis Software program for Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) Growth Charts (Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, Atlanta, GA). Adolescents who had a BMI\n85th percentile of BMI-for-age according to the CDC Growth\nCharts were classified as overweight or obese. Reference per-\ncentiles of waist circumference for the adolescent's year of age\nand sex were obtained (29), and abdominal obesity was defined\nas a waist circumference 90th percentile.\nDemographic and lifestyle factors\nSurvey questionnaire data were used to describe the distri-\nbution of demographic and lifestyle factors in the adolescent\npopulation. Adolescents were classified by age, and for each\ndemographic or lifestyle variable, the following categories were\ndefined: sex, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nmoderate, or vigorous), hours of television or videos watched or\ncomputer use (,2, 2\u00ad3, or 4 h), cigarette smoking (smoker or\nnonsmoker), and whether weight loss was attempted in the past\nyear (yes or no).\nStatistical analyses\nSample-weighted data were used, and all analyses were per-\nformed with SUDAAN software (release 9.0.1; Research Tri-\nangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to adjust the\nvariance for the complex sample design (30). For the 6-y from\nexamined sample-weight variable was created by assigning two-\nwas used in analyses of snacking, energy intake, body weight, and\nother anthropometric data.\nDemographic profiles, sample-weighted percentages (and SEs\nof the percentages) of adolescents in snack-consumption groups,\nand chi-square statistics were calculated with the PROC\nCROSSTAB procedure of SUDAAN software. Mean snacking\nfrequency, and percentage of energy from snacks measured for\ndemographic/lifestyle groups without controlling for covariates,\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nthe SEs of the means, and t test statistics for differences between\nmeans were calculated with the PROC DESCRIP procedure of\nSUDAAN software. Tests for mean differences between de-\nmographic and lifestyle groups were performed by using the\nBonferroni method to adjust the significance level for multiple\ncomparisons. For example, if there were 3 comparisons of\ngroups, the 0.05 level was divided by 3, and the means of the\ngroups were significantly different only if the P value of the\nTo control for covariates in an analysis of variance, least-\nsquare mean energy intake and least-square mean weight and\nadiposity measures, SEs of the least-square means, and tests for\ntrends were calculated with the PROC REGRESS procedure of\nSUDAAN software. The adjusted prevalence of a risk factor was\nmeasured by calculating the least-square mean of a dichotomous\nvariable with the PROC REGRESS procedure. In the first set of\nlinear regression analyses (model 1), least-square means were\ncalculated to adjust the between-group differences for age (y),\nsex, and ethnicity. In model 2, effects on the snacking-weight\nrelation of additional covariates that might be operating down-\nstream, such as income, physical activity, television and com-\nputer use, and smoking, were tested along with the basic\ndemographic covariates age, sex, and ethnicity. To control for the\npossibility that an observed association of snacking with weight\nmay be due to reverse causality, whether the adolescent had tried\nto lose weight was entered in model 3 along with all of the other\ncovariates (ie, age, sex, ethnicity, income, television and com-\nputer use, and smoking).\nOdds ratio for overweight or obesity and abdominal obesi-\nty were calculated with the PROC LOGISTIC procedure of\nSUDAAN software. Again, the 3 regression models were tested\nas the basic demographic covariates, additional demographic/\nlifestyle covariates, and the attempted weight loss covariate were\nentered in blocks. With groups defined by either snacking fre-\nquency or percentage of energy from snacks, compared with\nnonsnack consumers (the reference category), the statistical\nsignificance of risks associated with each increasing snack-\nconsumption group was measured by testing whether the 95% CI\naround the odds ratio overlapped with the value 1.0 (the odds ratio\ngiven to the reference category).\nRESULTS\nOn average, adolescents consumed a mean (6SE) of 1.64 6\n0.4% of daily energy intake (Table 1).

A decrease in the odds ratio with an increase in\nthe snacking frequency indicated that snack consumers who ate\n2, 3, and 4 snacks/d were less likely than nonsnackers to be\noverweight.

The role of specific eating patterns in the\npromotion of overweight in the pediatric population represents\none potential intervention approach and is the subject of much\ndebate. Snacking is one eating pattern that has been understudied.\nThe findings that relate snacking patterns to weight are in-\nconsistent, which makes them difficult to interpret. More studies\nare needed to understand more fully if snacking plays a role in\nchildhood obesity.\nreported snacking in a US national survey increased from 76% to\n88% (13). During this period, the mean number of snacks\nconsumed daily by adolescents increased from 1.60 to 1.97 and\nrepresented 21% to 25% of total daily energy intake, respectively.\na mean number of 1.64 snacks were consumed, and 21% of total\nenergy was from snacks. Although it appears that the mean\nnumber of snacks consumed and percentage energy from snacks\nmay have decreased in the past several years, it is difficult to make\ncomparisons between the 2 studies because the datasets used\nand the snacking definitions were different. Beverage breaks\n(between-meal drinks with no solid food) were combined with\nanalysis, beverage breaks were separated from snacks. In\nbreaks/d, and 6.1% of their energy intake came from these\nbeverage breaks (data not shown).\nThe most compelling findings from this study were the con-\nsistent inverse associations of snacking with overweight and\nabdominal obesity in adolescents after controlling for appropriate\ncovariates. Snacking frequency was inversely associated with all\n6 weight and obesity measures examined. These 6 weight\nmeasures were also inversely associated with the percentage\nenergy coming from snacks.

These analyses used 3 sequential regression models to\nexamine effects on the outcome measures with and without the\nentry of demographic or lifestyle factors that could have been\noperating downstream from snacking behaviors.\nThe debate over snacking and its association with weight\ncontinues (12, 25, 26). We hypothesize that energy intake is\na mediating variable in this snack-weight association. There are\nseveral reasons to suggest that snacking might increase energy\nintake and promote weight gain. First, snacking might increase\nenergy intake beyond the needs for energy expenditure if there is\nno compensation for additional energy from snacks in subsequent\nmeals. Second, if snack foods derive a substantial amount of\nenergy from fat, and because fat at 9 kcal/g is more energy-dense\nthan carbohydrates or proteins (4 kcal/g), the unregulated con-\nsumption of snack foods could increase energy intake beyond the\nneeds for energy expenditure and promote weight gain. In\ncontrast, studies have shown that snack foods, compared with\nfoods consumed at meals, are actually lower in fat and higher in\ncarbohydrates (19\u00ad21); therefore, individuals who snack regu-\nlarly may be more successful at managing weight by the re-\nplacement of fat with carbohydrates (19, 31). Research has shown\nthat a higher eating frequency can assist with weight management\nAn inverse association between snacking and weight was also\nshown by other authors, despite the increased energy intake\nassociated with snacking (14, 33). Snacking was shown to be\nassociated with improved diet quality (12, 17, 33) and increased\nintakes of fruit, whole grains, and fiber (12, 17), which could\npromote satiety and reduce risks for obesity. Snacking was also\nassociated with increased vigorous physical activity (14, 34);\nthus, the increased energy intake associated with snacking may\nhave been compensated for by increased energy expenditure\nduring physical activity. It is possible that there could be an\ninverse association between snacking and weight if snackers\nexercise more than nonsnackers because exercise promotes\nweight loss. An inverse association of snacking with weight could\nalso be explained if overweight individuals who try to lose weight\navoid eating snacks. Although an assessment of physical activity\nand whether the respondent had tried to lose weight were each\nincluded as covariates in subsequent analyses, there may have\nbeen some residual confounding. There were no statistical\ncontrols for improvements in diet quality, which could explain the\ninverse association of snacking with weight.\nIt is possible that the inverse association of snacking with\nweight is a result of underreporting, particularly snacks, in\noverweight individuals (25, 31). Although this may be the case,\ndata from this study and others have shown that there was an\nincrease in energy intake with reported snacking (12, 14, 33).\nAlthough energy intake was initially considered a mediating\nvariable between snacking and weight and, therefore, not in-\ncluded as a covariate in the model, and because lower energy\nintake could be a marker for underreporting that potentially\nconfounds the association between snacking and weight, sub-\nsequent analyses did include energy intake as a covariate.\nHowever, the same inverse association observed without energy\nintake in the model continued to persist. More studies are needed\nto examine whether the increased energy intake reported for those\nwho snack is an artifact of underreporting or is due to increased\ncompensation for physical activity or a lack of compensation at\nsubsequent meals.\nTelevision viewing appears to be associated with snacking.\nAdolescents snacked, on average, 3.5 times/wk while watching\ntelevision (35). The results from this study extend these findings\nby showing that the percentage of energy from snacks was higher\nin adolescents who spent 4 h in front of a television, video, or\ncomputer. Television viewing may be a contributing factor to\nobesity in youth (19, 36, 37) through several possible mecha-\nnisms that include the influence of food advertising on food-\nconsumption patterns, snacking while watching television, and\ndisplacement of physical activity. However, these pathways are\ncomplicated and poorly understood, and studies that examined\nthe relation between television and BMI produced mixed results\n(12, 36, 37). One longitudinal study showed a positive relation\nOverweight or obesity and abdominal obesity by snack consumption group (percentage of daily energy from snacks compared with 0%) in adolescents aged\nDependent variable\nand model\nPercentage of daily energy intake from snacks compared with 0%\nOverweight or obesity2\nAbdominal obesity3\n1 All values are odds ratios (95% CIs) estimated with the PROC LOGISTIC procedure of SUDAAN software (release 9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute,\nnhanes03_04.htm) in subjects aged 12\u00ad18 y, excluding pregnant or lactating girls.

More research is needed to better understand the relation\nbetween snacking and television, video, or computer use.\nThe lack of consistency among studies may be due to dif-\nferent definitions being used to define snacking or different\nassessment methods (38, 39). Moreover, the survey year in\nwhich the study was conducted, other lifestyle factors associ-\nated with snacking, and the number of covariates controlled for\nin the analyses varied across studies and may be important to\ninterpret the results.\nThis study has several limitations. As with all cross-sectional\nstudies, no cause-and-effect relations could be determined. Data\nfrom 24-h dietary recalls may not reflect usual intake (40) be-\ncause they rely on memory, and subjects may underreport or\noverreport (41, 42). Energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and\nbeverages tend to be underreported (41, 43); however, reported\nenergy intakes in this population were plausible for adolescents.\nIn conclusion, data from this study suggest that increased\nsnacking was inversely associated with overweight and ab-\ndominal obesity in adolescents. Because of inconsistent evidence\nin the literature, longitudinal studies are needed to further\nevaluate whether snacking prevents weight gain in adolescents.\nWe thank Pamelia Harris for help in preparing the manuscript and Michael\nZanovec for obtaining scientific articles.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--DRK: conceptualized the\nstudy and conducted all data analyses; TAN: wrote the first draft of the In-\ntroduction and Discussion; DRK: wrote the Methods and Results; DRK and\nCON: substantially revised the manuscript with critical feedback from the\nother authors; and all authors: reviewed the data and read and approved\nthe manuscript.
