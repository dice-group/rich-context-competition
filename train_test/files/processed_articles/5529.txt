For example, the large size of the L5\nand S1 nerve roots may cause resistance to\nthe local anaesthetic effect.10 Interestingly, it\nhas been reported that the sensory blockade\nof S3 is easier than that of S1 and as rapid as\nthat of L2 in a lumbar epidural block.11\nMoreover, the same study concluded that\nthe efficacy of a lumbar epidural block is\ncomparable with a caudal block.11 However,\nthe authors evaluated motor blockade using\nthe Bromage scale and did not quantify the\nanal motor block. To our knowledge, no\nobjective investigation has compared saddle,\nlumbar epidural and caudal blocks in a\nprospective, randomized study. The lack of\na comparative study and adequate informa-\ntion on the potency of paralysing the anal\nsphincter with these regional anaesthetic\ntechniques prompted us to examine if sig-\nnificant differences in anal motor block\nexisted using the three different methods.\nAnorectal manometry, with the use of a\ncontinuous water perfusion system, was\nused to assess the tone of the anal sphincter\nmuscles.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design and patient population\nThe prospective, randomized, comparative\nstudy took place in the Department of\nAnaesthesiology and Pain Medicine,\nKangwon National University Hospital,\nGangwon-Do, Republic of Korea between\npatients, aged 16\u00ad65 years, scheduled for\nelective anal surgery with regional anaesthe-\nsia and American Society of\nAnaesthesiologists physical status I or II\nwere eligible for the study.12 Exclusion\ncriteria were as follows: (i) a known allergy\nto local anaesthetics; (ii) the presence of a\nneuromuscular disorder; (iii) contraindica-\ntions to regional anaesthesia; (iv) morbid\nobesity (i.e., body mass index > 30 kg/m2).\nA computer-generated random number\ntable was used to assign patients to one of\nthe following three regional anaesthetic\ngroups: saddle (SD), lumbar epidural (LE),\nor caudal (CD). The study was approved by\nthe Institutional Review Board of Kangwon\nNational University Hospital (Ref: Imsang\n07\u00ad05) and all patients provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nAnaesthetic procedures\nPatients did not receive any premedication.\nElectrocardiograms, heart rate and oxygen\nsaturation were monitored before the block\nand thereafter continuously throughout the\nstudy.\nIn the SD group, the subarachnoid space\nwas entered using a 25-gauge Quinke spinal\nneedle (Insung, Seoul, Korea) at the L3\u00ad4\ninterspace with the patient in the sitting\nposition. After confirming the free flow of\ncerebrospinal fluid, 1 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine\n(5mg) in 8% glucose solution (Marcain;\nAstraZeneca, So\n\u00a8 derta\n\u00a8 lje, Sweden) was\nadministered. The patient remained in the\nsitting position for 5 min after the local\nanaesthetic injection. Subsequently, the\npatient was moved to the supine position.\nFor the LE and CD groups, the\nanaesthetic solution was lidocaine-epinephr-\nine-bicarbonate (20 ml of lidocaine 2% plus\nbicarbonate 8.4%, which was added\nimmediately before administration). In the\nLE group, the epidural space was identified\nusing an 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Perifix\u00d5; B\nBraun, Melsungen, Germany) with its bevel\nfacing caudally via the midline approach at\nthe L4\u00ad5 interspace using the loss-of-resis-\ntance-to-air technique. Subsequently, a 22-\ngauge multi-orifice catheter was placed 3 cm\ninto the epidural space in the lateral pos-\nition. After taping the catheter and filter,\n3 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:\ncatheter as a test dose. If no evidence of\nintravascular or subarachnoid injection\nappeared, an additional 12 ml of the\nanaesthetic solution was injected through\nthe catheter over 1 min. In the CD group,\nthe patients were placed in the lateral pos-\nition and an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was\ninserted into the caudal space through the\nsacrococcygeal ligament. If no blood or\ncerebrospinal fluid was aspirated, a caudal\ninjection of 15 ml of the anaesthetic solution\nwas given through the needle. All patients in\nthe LE and CD groups were moved into\nsupine position following the anaesthetic\ninjection and remained in the supine pos-\nition for 20 min. To avoid inter-operator\nvariability, one staff anaesthesiologist\n(S.S.K.) performed all of the blocks.\nIn all patients, the level of sensory anal-\ngesia was evaluated on the torso and lower\nextremity at 5-min intervals for 30 min after\ninjecting the local anaesthetic. The anatom-\nical landmarks and correlated dermatome\nlevels were standardized for testing as fol-\nlows: the umbilicus (T10), inguinal crease\n(L1), anterior thigh (L2), medial knee (L3),\nmedial malleolus (L4), the dorsum web\nbetween first and second toe (L5), the lateral\nheel (S1), and the medial popliteal fossa\n(S2). The assessment was based on the loss\nof cold sensation to a cotton wool\nswab soaked in absolute alcohol by an\nindependent assessor blinded to the anaes-\nthetic treatment group.\nAnal intraluminal pressure measurements\nAnal intraluminal pressure was evaluated\nusing water perfused anorectal manometry\npre-block and post-block. The pre-block\nassessment was performed 1\u00ad2 h before\nregional anaesthesia and the post-block\nassessment was taken 30 min after regional\nanaesthesia.13 The patients had no bowel\npreparation before manometry. The anal\nsphincter pressures were measured using a\n3-lumen, water-perfused catheter and\npneumohydraulic capillary infusion\nsystem (R3B & PIP4-4; Mui Scientific,\nMississauga, Ontario, Canada) connected\nto a computerized software program (MMS\nDatabase; Medical Measurement Systems,\nEnschede, The Netherlands). The catheter\nhad three ports spaced 0.5 cm apart for the\ntwo proximal holes and each lumen was\nperfused with sterile degassed water at\n0.1 ml/min. The sphincter was identified\nusing the slow station pull-through tech-\nnique.14 For the pre-block measurement, the\nlocation of the catheter was verified using\nthe pressure increase observed during pull-\nthrough and during a voluntary squeeze and\nthe same position was used for the post-\nblock measurement. After the patient was\ncomfortable and the manometric trace had\nstabilized, the recording was started. The\npatient was then instructed to contract the\nanal sphincter maximally for 15 s on three\nseparate occasions 1 min apart and the\naverage value of 3 consecutive measure-\nments was taken for the analysis. While\nrelaxing and squeezing, the maximal resting\n(MRP) and squeezing (MSP) pressures of\nthe anus were observed. The amount of\ninhibition caused by anaesthesia (i.e., the\npressure drop in the anal canal) was\nexpressed as the percentage of the resting\nand squeezing pressures. The percentage\ninhibition for MRP or MSP was calculated\nas follows:\n%inhibition\n\u00bc\npreanaesthetic pressure\n\u00c0postanaesthetic pressure\n \npreanaesthetic pressure\nAll anorectal manometry measurements\nwere performed by a fully trained independ-\nent physician blinded to the anaesthetic\nprocedures. To ensure study blindness, the\narea from the lumbar vertebrae to the\nsacrococcygeal ligament was covered with\nthe cotton gauze. All procedures and meas-\nurements were performed in the same mano-\nmetric study room.\nAfter the manometric measurements were\ntaken, all patients were moved to operating\nroom and anal surgery was undertaken with\nthe patient in the prone position. During the\noperation, the patients were sedated with\nintravenous administration of midazolam\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size was based on estimates from\nour pilot study in which the mean percent-\nand 29.2% for saddle, lumbar epidural, and\ncaudal blocks, respectively. The standard\ndeviation was 8.6%. Therefore, approxi-\nmately 45 patients (15 in each group) were\nrequired to achieve 80% power to detect a\ndifference of 10% inhibition of MRP among\nthe means using one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) at the 0.05 significance level.\nFor the same variables, an expected differ-\nence of 8% inhibition of MSP generated a\nsimilar sample size. Patients with inadequate\nblockade after the administration of local\nanaesthetic were recorded as failures and\nexcluded from the post-anaesthetic evalu-\nation. To allow for drop-outs, a sample size\nof at least 18 patients per group was chosen.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Differences among the groups\nwere analysed using one-way ANOVA or\nnonparametric Kruskal\u00adWallis test, as\nappropriate. Manometric data among the\ngroups were compared using ANOVA and if\nsignificant results were obtained the post hoc\nScheffe\n\u00b4 test was used.15 Within-group com-\nparisons were made using the paired t-test.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nOf the 62 patients who were assessed for\neligibility, 54 were randomized to one of the\nthree regional anaesthesia groups. Reasons\nfor exclusion are shown in Figure 1. In the\nLE group, the lumbar epidural technique\nwas successful in all but two patients (failure\nto identify epidural space and catheter\ninsertion failure) and in the CD group\nthree patients (failed block in two patients\nand incomplete block in one patient) had to\nbe excluded from the analysis. Therefore,\nthe study analysis population consisted of 49\npatients (SD group, n \u00bc 18; LE group,\nn \u00bc 16; CD group, n \u00bc 15). No statistically\nsignificant differences were detected among\nthe three groups in terms of age, height,\nweight or sex distribution (Table 1). The\nanaesthesia level in the LE group was stat-\nistically significantly higher than in the SD\nand CD groups (P < 0.01 for both compari-\nsons) (Table 1). All the operations were\nperformed successfully without any need for\nadditional intervention or analgesics.\nNo statistically significant differences\nwere observed in the pre-block MRP and\nMSP values among the three regional anaes-\nthetic groups (Tables 2 and 3).

The MSP is related to the\nactivity of the striated sphincters (i.e., the\nexternal sphincter and the puborectalis\nmuscle).\nThe principal finding of this study was\nthat saddle block was the most effective\ntechnique for decreasing MSP. In addition,\nthe reductions in MSP following lumbar\nepidural or caudal block were similar. Also,\nthe decrease in MRP was similar for all types\nof anaesthetic technique. These current\nfindings support the results of a study that\nfound surgeons who were blinded to the\nanaesthetic method rated spinal anaesthesia\nbetter than epidural anaesthesia for minor\nnon-obstetric surgery.18\nThe complex innervation of the anal zone\n(i.e., autonomic versus spinal) may explain\nthe differences that this present study found\nbetween the regional anaesthetics in the\nanorectal manometry results. The internal\nanal sphincter is under autonomic control\nvia sympathetic innervation from the hypo-\ngastric plexus, which initiates tonic contrac-\ntion, and via sacral parasympathetic fibres\nthat mediate anorectal muscle relaxation.\nThe external sphincter, which is supplied by\nthe inferior rectal branch of the internal\npudendal nerve and the perineal branch of\nthe fourth sacral nerve, is under voluntary\ncontrol.19 The decrease in the MRP after\neach block is probably due to sympathetic\nblockade. Therefore, the difference that this\ncurrent study observed between the reduc-\ntions in MSP and MRP may have been the\nresult of partial, incomplete sympathetic\nblockade. In this present study, the level of\nanalgesia ranged from T10 to L2 (SD\nL3 (CD group). Considering the innervation\nof this region and the sensory level that was\nobserved with each block, partial sympa-\nthetic blockade of the hypogastric plexus\nwas a probable cause for the differences that\nwere found between the regional anaes-\nthetics in this study.\nWith a spinal block, sympathetic block-\nade is present two or three levels above the\nlevel of the sensory blockade, whereas with\nan epidural block the level of sympathetic\nblockade is the same as, or lower than the\nsensory block.9 The hypogastric plexus con-\ntracts the internal anal sphincter and\nreceives its sympathetic innervation from\npreganglionic fibres, which have their cell\nbodies in the lower thoracic and upper\nlumbar segments.20 Another possible\nexplanation for the differences that were\nfound with the three regional anaesthetics in\nthe anorectal manometry results in the pre-\nsent study is incomplete sympathetic block-\nade that might happen in the dermatomal\nsegments when analgesia is present. For\nexample, one study showed that despite a\nblockade sufficient for surgical anaesthesia,\nit was difficult to achieve a complete sym-\npathetic blockade with a spinal or epidural\nblock using clinical doses of local\nAlthough caudal block is widely used for\nanorectal surgery, its success rate has been\nhighly experienced staff anaesthesiologist per-\nforming the procedure in the present study,\nthree of the 18 caudal blocks were unsuccess-\nful. Caudal block failure is often related to\nanatomic variations of the bony sacrum and\nthe soft tissues over the bone, which include\ndisplacement of the hiatus, narrowing of the\nsacral canal, and ossification of the sacrococ-\ncygeal membrane that can occur especially in\nthe elderly.25 In addition, following caudal\nentry to the epidural space, the cephalad\nspread of the drug may be limited by minor\nbony obstructions that will result in the\nblockade of limited segments.25\nIn our institute, saddle block is the most\ncommonly performed regional anaesthetic\ntechnique for anal surgery, since it provides\nrapid-onset, dense block and usually takes a\nshort time to perform.26 Caudal block is\nused as an alternative to saddle block in\ncases where dural puncture is to be avoided\n(e.g., patients with a history of post-dural\npuncture headache, increased intracranial\npressure). However,asmentionedpreviously,\ncaudalblockinadults isoftendifficultbecause\nof anatomical variability. Also, we noted that\nthe sacral spread of anaesthetic following the\nlumbar epidural block was sufficient to block\nsacral segments for anal surgery. Therefore,\nlumbar epidural block rather than caudal\nblock may be a better choice in cases where\nsaddle block cannot be used.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nFirst, the exact level of sympathetic\nblockade was not checked and although\nmeasuring the level would have provided\nmore detail, it was not the primary objective\nof the study. Moreover, there is some debate\nconcerning the evaluative methods for\nsympathetic blockade.27\u00ad30 Secondly, the\ndirection of the epidural catheter was not\nconfirmed radiologically. One study showed\nthat the initial injection of a local anaes-\nthetic solution through a caudally oriented\nepidural catheter results in a large spread of\nanaesthesia through the sacral area.31\nAlthough the bevel of the epidural needle\nwas placed caudally, it did not ensure caudal\nadvance. However, another study showed\nthat the injection of a local anaesthetic\nsolution through a lumbar epidural catheter\noriented caudally resulted in a faster onset\nand superior quality of anaesthesia in com-\nparison with a cephalad-oriented catheter in\nankle surgery (operating site innervated\nmainly by S1), but not in haemorrhoidect-\nomy (by S3\u00ad5).32 This interesting difference\nbetween the two aforementioned studies\nimplies that although more anaesthetic\npooled in the sacral area with the caudally\noriented lumbar epidural catheter, sensory\nanalgesia with a lumbar epidural block for\nthe area innervated by the sacral nerve\n(excluding S1, the blockade of which is\noften delayed due to the larger size of this\nroot8) is not affected by the direction of\nspread of the local anaesthetic.31,32 In this\npresent study, it remains unclear as to\nwhether the direction of the epidural cath-\neter affected manometric changes within the\nLE group. Theoretically, we would suggest\nthat more caudal spread of the local anaes-\nthetic with a caudally directed catheter\nshould result in a difference in the degree\nof motor blockade in the lower sacral area.\nFinally, different local anaesthetics were\nused in the three treatment groups; hyper-\nbaric bupivacaine was used for spinal anaes-\nthesia and lidocaine for the LE and CD\ngroups. A significantly higher motor block-\nade has been reported with lidocaine than\nwith bupivacaine.30 However, the focus of\nthis present study was to make a clinically\noriented comparison of the three anaesthetic\ntechniques in a normal clinical practice\nsetting. In addition, several case reports\nand animal studies have suggested that\nspinal lidocaine may result in a greater\nincidence of neurological complications\ncompared with other local anaesthetics.33,34\nIn conclusion, this prospective, rando-\nmized, comparative study used anorectal\nmanometry to demonstrate that saddle\nblockwasmoreeffectivethanlumbarepidural\nor caudal block for depressing anal sphincter\ntone. No differences were detected between\nthe lumbar epidural and caudal blocks.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a 2014 Kangwon\nNational University research grant (no.\nReferences\n1.
