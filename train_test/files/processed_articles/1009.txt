Research has increasingly focused on the dynamic nature of disability and depressive symptoms in later\nlife. Little research, however, has modeled disability and depressive symptoms as dynamic, related processes.\nFurthermore, virtually no research has considered social support as dynamic across age. Here, we investigate the\nrelationship between long-term patterns of disability, perceived and received social support, and depressive symptoms in\nlater life.\nMethods. We use random coefficient (growth) models of four waves of Duke Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly data to determine whether disability, support, and depressive symptoms follow linear\ntrajectories across age and whether support mediates the relationship between disability and depressive symptoms.\nResults. The results show that (a) trajectories of disability are strongly related to trajectories of depressive symptoms\nand (b) trajectories of perceived support mediate the relationship between trajectories of disability and depressive\nsymptoms, whereas trajectories of received support do not.\nDiscussion. Disability, social support, and depressive symptoms are strongly interrelated processes in later life. Our\nresults are consistent with previous research in showing that perceived, rather than received, support mediates the\nrelationship between disability and depressive symptoms, but our results extend previous research in showing that this\nmediation occurs across time.\nARE long-term patterns of disability related to long-term\npatterns of depressive symptoms in later life? Can social\nsupport be viewed as a process in later life that emerges in\nresponse to disability, and, if so, what dimensions of social\nsupport (if any) mediate the relationship between disability\npatterns and depressive symptom patterns? In previous re-\nsearch, disability has increasingly been conceptualized as\na chronic stressor affecting individuals persistently over time.\nFor example, contemporary research on the disablement\nprocess emphasizes disability as a trajectory of experience\nover time rather than a collection of static events (Verbrugge &\nJette, 1994). Paralleling this recent interest in considering\ndisability as a dynamic process across age, research on\ndepressive symptoms has increasingly discussed life course\npatterns of symptomatology (e.g., Mirowsky & Ross, 1992). In\ncontrast, social support has yet to be considered a long-term\nprocess at the individual level. Yet conceiving of disability as\na chronic stressor and social support as a resource that may be\nmobilized in the face of such a stressor suggests that we should\nconsider social support as patterned in later life.\nDrawing on stress theory, we argue that conceptualizing\ndisability, depressive symptoms, and social support as life\ncourse processes and measuring them as long-term trajectories\ncan elucidate the way they interrelate over time. In treating\ndisability as a long-term trajectory, we offer an alternative\napproach to estimating exposure to this chronic stressor and its\nconsequences. That is, the majority of previous research on the\ndeleterious effects of disability has been cross-sectional or\nshort-term longitudinal in design, limiting the ability to\nunderstand the process of disability and its interrelationship\nto other health and psychosocial life course processes. In this\nresearch, we test the mediating effects of long-term patterns of\nsocial support rather than the immediate and limited effect of\nsupport as a static phenomenon, extending the way mediating\neffects are tested for chronic stressors.\nDisability, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Support\nThis research is guided by the conceptual outline of the stress\nprocess (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981),\nwhich consists of three main components: sources, mediators,\nand outcomes. This framework posits that stress may impact an\nindividual directly as a life course event or as a chronic strain\nover time. Also central to this framework is the protective\nrole of mediators such as social support in limiting the impact\nof stressors on psychological outcomes. Disability has been\nconsidered a chronic stressor that is persistent and linked\nto negative psychological outcomes (Turner & Noh, 1988).\nDisability onset may cause a period of adjustment or disruption,\npromoting feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness that may\na chronic stressor, disability produces limitation in the ability to\nperform social roles and may interfere with social interaction\nThompson & Heller, 1990), and its psychological consequences\nmay endure over time. At the same time, it may threaten an\nindividual's ability to live alone and decrease a sense of\nindependence or mastery, which is known to be particularly\nimportant for the continued psychological well-being of older\nadults (Gignac, Cott, & Badley, 2000; Jang, Haley, Small, &\nMuch of disability research has focused on heterogeneity in\ndisability among the elderly and the short-term dynamic nature\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nof the disability experience (Beckett et al., 1996; Crimmins &\n1988). Yet only a handful of studies have modeled disability as\nindividual-level trajectories (e.g., Li, Duncan, McAuley,\nVerbrugge, Reoma, & Gruber-Baldini, 1994). These studies\nreveal a trend toward treating disability as a trajectory rather\nthan as a single transition or as a static circumstance, reflecting\nthe conceptualization of disability as a process that unfolds in\nlater life.\nAt the same time, research examining the relationship\nbetween disability and depression/depressive symptoms has\nremained relatively static in design but has established a strong\nassociation between disability and depression/depressive\nsymptoms in older adults (Bruce, 2001). Whereas healthy,\nfunctional elders have no greater risk of depression than those\nat younger ages, those with functional impairment have\na significantly greater risk (Berkman et al., 1986; Roberts,\nKaplan, Shema, & Strawbridge, 1997). Research has shown\nthat the deleterious effects of disability on depressive symptoms\nare greatest for adults over age 65 (Turner & Noh, 1988) and\nthat disability and poor health account for a majority of\ndepressive symptom incidence among older adults (Kennedy,\nKelman, & Thomas, 1990). These findings suggest that\ndisability is one of the most salient factors for the psychological\nwell-being of older adults, yet little is known about how long-\nterm patterning of disability relates to long-term patterning in\npsychological well-being. The connection between disability\nand depressive symptoms is somewhat reciprocal (Bruce, 2001;\nGraney, 2000); however, although depressive symptoms have\nbeen shown to predict disability onset (Penninx, Leveille,\nFerrucci, van Eijk, & Guralnik, 1999), others have found that\nchange in disability has a stronger effect on depressive\nsymptoms than symptoms has on disability (Ormel, Rysdyk,\nSullivan, van Sonderen, & Kempen, 2002).\nPersonal and social resources have received a great deal of\nattention for their roles in the stress process in general and\nspecifically the disablement process. Among the most salient\nand robust of these is social support. Social support has been\nfound to protect individuals from the effects of disability on\nmental health (Jang et al., 2002). Multiple dimensions of social\nsupport have been studied to determine which facets of support\nprovide protective effects for physical and mental health (Glass\n& Maddox, 1992; Mendes de Leon, Glass, Beckett, Seeman,\nEvans, & Berkman, 1999; Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, &\nIn this study, we focus on perceived and received support.\nPerceived support has been found to be highly protective against\nthe effects of stress (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Kessler & McLeod,\n(Krause, 1986). In regard to disability, perceived support has\nbeen shown to attenuate the effect of disability on depressive\nTurner & Noh, 1988). The protective effects of received\nsupport, however, remain in question. Despite the existence of\nsome evidence showing received support to be protective\nagainst the effects of general stressors for older adults (Krause,\n1986), received support has also been found to have no\nameliorative effects in the face of disability (Jang et al., 2002).\nIn addition, increased received support has been associated with\nincreased disability (Mendes de Leon, Gold, Glass, Kaplan, &\nrole of received support in the connection between disability and\ndepression remains relatively unclear.\nKrause (1997) provides a theoretical explanation for the\nconflicting findings across dimensions of social support. More\nsalient than a general measure of perceived support (which may\njust measure relationship satisfaction), anticipated support may\nbe the key element for buffering the effects of a stressor on\nnegative psychological outcomes. Anticipated support may act\nto promote feelings of autonomy (mastery) or personal problem\nsolving since belief in a personal network ready to react in the\nface of stress may promote personal problem solving (Pierce,\naddition, the belief that others are ready to help when needed\nmay decrease the strain put on network relationships. In other\nwords, this belief may decrease the burden felt by support\nnetworks and increase or maintain feelings of independence in\nthe individual. Conversely, received support may exacerbate\nthe effects of a stressor. This may be due to the fact that\npersonal resources may not be sufficient to cope with the\nstressor, therefore increasing feelings of dependence or\nreceived support may lead to conflict with one's network due\nto demands placed on their time and resources (Rook, 1984).\nIn this study, we do not attempt to disentangle the social\nprocesses involved in support and its protective effects. Rather,\nwe attempt to measure the connection between disability and\ndepressive symptoms, and the effects of social support in this\nconnection, as life course processes. Thus, we extend previous\nresearch in two ways. First, we determine the connection of\nindividual trajectories of disability and depression over a decade\nin the lives of older adults. Most research to date either has used\ncross-sectional data to examine this relationship or has used\nshort-term longitudinal data and cross-lagged (or related)\nmodels. Our approach treats disability and depressive symp-\ntoms (well-being) as life course processes that are connected\nthroughout the later stage(s) of life. This approach is important\nbecause although disability and depressive symptoms may or\nmay not be strongly related at any single point in time, life\ncourse patterns in them may well be very strongly interrelated.\nSecond, we alternately introduce trajectories of perceived and\nreceived social support to examine the longitudinal effects of\nthese protective factors. To date, no research has examined\ntrajectories of support in later life. In addition, most research\ntesting the mediating effects of support has been cross sectional\nor two-wave longitudinal in design. These types of analytic\nstrategies cannot illustrate how the protective effects of social\nsupport work function over long periods of time in response to\nchange in disability. We believe that this may account somewhat\nfor the conflicting results concerning both the effects of received\nsupport and the type of protective effects perceived support offer.\nWe hypothesize that disability and depressive symptoms will\ngenerally increase across age but will exhibit marked variation\nacross individuals, as suggested by previous research (Li et al.,\nthat growth patterns in disability will be strongly associated\nwith growth patterns in depressive symptoms, meaning that\nindividuals with increasing trajectories of disability will also\nbe more likely to have increasing trajectories of depressive\nsymptoms, whereas individuals with decreasing trajectories\nof disability will have declining trajectories of depressive symp-\ntoms. Finally, we hypothesize that social support trajectories\nwill mediate the connection between disablement and distress\nover time (Turner & Noh, 1988). We expect the effect of\nperceived support to be stronger than the effect of received\nsupport, as suggested by previous literature (Krause, 1997).\nMETHODS\nSample and Variables\nThe data for this study are from the Established Populations\nfor Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) at Duke\nUniversity. The EPESE Project is a National Institute on\nAging\u00adsponsored multicenter research program geared to\ninvestigate the health of persons ages 65 or older at baseline.\nThe data include eight periods of measurement, four of which\nwere in-person interviews and four of which were telephone\ninterviews. We use only the in-person data, given that certain\nkey measures were not collected via the telephone interviews.\nThe baseline survey was conducted in 1986\u00ad87, with follow-up\nAt baseline, the survey consisted of 4,162 respondents. Of\nthese, 162 were not directly interviewed and were not used\nmeasure for disability status at any wave or for at least one of\nthe social support measures. After deleting observations\nwithout valid data, the analytic sample consisted of 3,876\npersons (6.9% missing). We include age, sex (male \u00bc 1), race\n(Black \u00bc 1), baseline marital status (married \u00bc 1), and years of\nformal education as covariates. Income is not included in the\nanalyses because (a) over 25% of the sample was missing on\nthe income item at baseline, (b) income is unstable in later\nadulthood (whereas education is generally stable), and (c) the\ncausal direction of the relationship between income and health\nis unclear, especially in late life. No individuals were missing\non these background variables.\nWe measure disability at each wave as a sum of seven\nactivities of daily living (ADL; Katz et al., 1963) and seven\ninstrumental ADL (IADL; Lawton & Brody, 1969) measures.\nADL items included whether the respondent needed help to (a)\nwalk across a small room, (b) bathe, (c) groom him/herself, (d)\ndress him/herself, (e) eat, (f) get from a bed to a chair, and (g)\nuse the toilet. The IADL items included whether the respondent\ncould (a) use the telephone, (b) drive a car, (c) shop for\ngroceries, (d) prepare meals, (e) do housework, (f) take\nmedicine, and (g) handle money without help. The sum of\nthese items has been shown to be effective in capturing a full\nrange of disability (Spector & Fleishman, 1998).\nWe measure depressive symptoms at each wave using the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D) Scale,\na well-known and highly reliable scale (Radloff, 1977;\nrecent research suggests that certain items from the CES-D\nScale may be biased by physical impairment (Grayson,\nMackinnon, Jorm, Creasey, & Brae, 2000); nonetheless, results\nobtained using a reduced version of the scale did not differ\nsubstantially from those we present here.\nWe measured perceived and received social support at each\nwave. The perceived support measure was the sum of two\nitems: one asking whether the respondents could count on at\nleast some family or friends for support in times of trouble and\nthe other asking whether the respondents had at least some\nfamily or friends with whom they could discuss their problems.\nThe received support measure was the sum of 12 items\nregarding whether the respondent had received support during\nthe last year from family or friends for a variety of issues.\nDescriptive statistics for all variables used in the analyses at all\nwaves can be found in Table 1.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe use random coefficients (growth) models to capture\ndisability, depressive symptoms, and social support trajectories\nacross age. In a growth model, time-specific (t) individual level\n(i) measures (yit\n) are viewed as a composite of the individual's\nlatent growth process and normally distributed random error.\nIf the latent growth process is assumed to be linear, then two\nlatent parameters define the process. Thus,\nyit\n; N\u00f0ai\n\u00fe bi\nThis specification defines the random error as normally\ndistributed with a time-constant variance of r2. The mean of\nTable 1.

EPESE \u00bc Established Population for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly.\nthe error is 0, but the expected value for the structural aspect\nof the model is a function of an individual-specific random\nintercept (ai\n) and slope (bi\n) and time (t). This level equation\nseparates the time-specific measures into a structural compo-\nnent (the trajectory) and random variation around the trajectory\n(captured by r2). A second-level equation allows for the\ninclusion of covariates to differentiate individuals' trajectories:\nai\n; N\u00f0Xi\nc; sa\n\u00de\nbi\n; N\u00f0Zi\nd; sb\n\u00de:\nIn this specification, a different set of covariates may explain\nlatent baseline and growth factors (hence X and Z differ), and\ntheir effects are expected to vary as well (hence c and d differ).\nUnexplained between-individual variance in trajectories is\ncaptured by sa\nand sb\n, thus enabling us to distinguish between\nerror at the individual level and heterogeneity at the between-\nindividual level. Thus, this model is an ideal technique for\nanalyzing panel data because, unlike standard regression\napproaches, it is able to distinguish between change that occurs\nat the individual level and heterogeneity that is attributable to\nbetween-individual differences.\nOur first model estimates trajectories of disability and\ndepressive symptoms. Included in the X and Z covariate vectors\nfor the depressive symptom trajectory are the random effects\nfrom the disability trajectory. Our second and third models\ninclude a trajectory of social support (received and perceived\nsupport, respectively) as a mediator between disability and\ndepressive symptom trajectories. Thus, these models include an\ninfluence of the random effects of disability on the random\neffects for support and depressive symptoms, and the de-\npressive symptom trajectory also includes the random effects\nfor the support trajectories as predictors. Figure 1 provides\na conceptual diagram of the model.\nOver the course of the study, a number of individuals died or\notherwise left the sample. Some of those who attritted at earlier\nwaves returned at later waves. In order to compensate for the\nmissing data without deleting observations with any missing\ndata, we estimated our models using a full-information maxi-\nmum likelihood estimator within a structural equation modeling\nframework (Mplus; Muthen and Muthen, 1998; Willett and\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows the results of the random effects models with\ntrajectories of disability predicting trajectories of depressive\nsymptoms. The top portion of the table shows these effects\nalong with the effects of the background variables, and the\nbottom portion of the table shows the explained variance for\neach of the time-specific measures.\nRegarding overall model fit, we report two measures: the\nmodel v2 and the root mean squared error of approximation\n(RMSEA). For a well-fitting model, the v2 should be\nnonsignificant (indicating little discrepancy between the\nFigure 1. Conceptual diagram of disability, social support, and depressive symptom random effects model. CESD \u00bc Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies--Depression scale.\nobserved and predicted data)--although larger sample sizes\ntend to produce significant v2 values despite adequate fit--and\nthe RMSEA should be ,.1 (and preferably ,.05; Bollen,\n1989). In the first model, we observe a significant v2 but an\nRMSEA of .042, indicating good fit.\nIn the second level of the model, age has a positive effect on\nlatent baseline disability, as is expected. Men and married\npersons evidence slightly less baseline disability than women\nand the unmarried, whereas Blacks show slightly more baseline\ndisability than Whites, although none of these differences are\nsignificant. Years of education has a strong negative effect on\nbaseline disability. In terms of the latent growth rates (the\nslope) for disability, age increases the rate of growth in\ndisability symptoms, indicating either nonlinear growth in\ndisability across age or cohort differences in the rate of growth\nin disability. Men have significantly slower growth in disability\nacross age (d\u00bc\u00c0.03, p , .05), as do married persons (d\u00bc\u00c0.03,\np , .1). Blacks are predicted to have higher growth rates in\ndisability, although the coefficient for Black is not significant.\nFinally, education reduces the growth rate significantly (d \u00bc\nvariance in latent baseline disability and 17% of the latent\ngrowth in disability across the survey period, and the explained\nvariances for each observed measure of disability are quite high\na good fit of the linear growth specification.\nThe depressive symptom portion of the model shows that age\nhas a nonsignificant effect on baseline depressive symptoms,\ncontrolling for other factors. Males have significantly fewer\ndepressive symptoms at baseline, as do married persons. Blacks\nhave fewer symptoms at baseline as well, although the race\ndifference is not significant. Education has a strong negative\neffect. Finally, latent baseline disability has a significant and\nstrong effect on baseline depressive symptoms (c \u00bc .22, p ,\n.001). This coefficient implies that a 1-unit increase in baseline\nlevel of disability translates into a .22-symptom difference in\nbaseline symptoms.\nRelatively few variables affect the growth rate in depressive\nsymptoms. Only age, marital status, and disability growth have\nan effect, with age's effect being negative (indicating either\na slowing of the rate of increase in depressive symptoms across\nage or cohort differences in the rate of symptom increase) and\nmarital status and disability growth both increasing the growth\nrate in symptoms. The effect of marriage is fairly large but is\novershadowed by the effect of disability (d \u00bc .14, p , .001).\nThe coefficient for disability growth implies that a 1-unit\nincrease in the growth rate for disability yields a .14-unit\nincrease in the growth rate for depressive symptoms. As\na whole, the covariates (including the latent trajectory\nparameters for disability) explain 19% of the variance in latent\nbaseline depressive symptoms and 18% of the variance in latent\ngrowth in symptoms, and the explained variance in the\nobserved measures is quite large (ranging from 44% at Time\n1 to 51% at Time 2). Disability trajectories account for a large\nproportion of this explained variance; without disability\ntrajectories, the covariates alone explain 10% and 3% of the\nvariance in latent baseline symptoms and growth in symptoms,\nrespectively (results not reported in table).\nTables 3 and 4 show the results of adding social support\ntrajectories as mediators of the disability\u00addepressive symptom\nrelationship. Table 3 contains the results of including\ntrajectories of received support, whereas Table 4 contains the\nresults of including trajectories of perceived support. In both\ntables, the coefficients for predicting disability trajectories\nchange very little over those results presented in Table 2. This\nis to be expected because we have not added any additional\ninformation to help explain disability patterns.\nIn terms of received support trajectories, men report\nreceiving less support at baseline, and education also reduces\nreceived baseline support. All other covariates have a positive\neffect. Blacks report receiving more support, as do married\npersons. Finally, latent baseline disability has a strong positive\neffect on baseline received support, as may be expected: Those\nwho need more support tend to receive it. In terms of the\nTable 2.

Overall, 14% of the variance in\nlatent baseline received support is explained by the covariates,\nwhereas 16% of the variance in growth in received support is\nexplained. Furthermore, the explained variance for received\nsupport is fairly high--ranging from 38% at Time 1 to 51% at\nTime 4--indicating good fit of the linear specification for\ngrowth in support.\nFor the sake of brevity, we do not discuss the effects of all\nbackground covariates on depressive symptom trajectories;\nrather, we concentrate only on the effects of disability and\nreceived support. Received support has positive but non-\nsignificant effects on both latent baseline depressive symptoms\n(c \u00bc .01, p . .05) and growth in depressive symptoms (d \u00bc .08,\np . .05), indicating that received support has little to do with\ndepressive symptom trajectories. The effect of support also has\nrelatively little effect on reducing the relationship between\ndisability and depressive symptom trajectories. The effect of\nlatent baseline disability on latent baseline depressive symp-\nTable 3.

Thus, compared with\nthe results in the previous table, the addition of received support\nonly slightly decreases the effect of disability trajectories on\ndepressive symptom trajectories. More to the point, the\nexplained variance in both of the latent parameters for\ndepressive symptom trajectories is unaffected.\nThe results for perceived support presented in Table 4 reveal\na different story. Latent baseline disability has a negative effect\non latent baseline perceived support (c \u00bc\u00c0.03, p , .001), and\nlatent disability growth has a negative effect on latent growth in\nperceived support (d\u00bc\u00c0.05, p , .001). Latent baseline perceived\nsupport has a strong negative effect on baseline depressive\nsymptoms (c \u00bc \u00c0.99, p , .001), and the effect of growth in\nperceived support on depressive symptom growth is negative and\neven stronger (d \u00bc\u00c01.70, p , .001). In this model, the direct\neffect of baseline disability on baseline depressive symptoms\n[.18/.22]). However, the effect of disability growth is reduced to\nnonsignificance. These results indicate that trajectories of\nperceived support completely mediate the effect of disability\ngrowth on depressive symptom growth, whereas the negative\nrelationship between disability trajectories and perceived support\ntrajectories indicates that individuals may feel that support is\ninadequate to help them cope with their levels of disability.\nThe increase in the explained variance for depressive\nsymptoms from the first model (disability and depressive\nsymptoms only) to the model with received support included\ntells a similar story. When latent baseline perceived support is\nincluded (see Table 4), the explained variance for latent\nbaseline depressive symptoms increases from .19 to .35 (an\nincrease of 84%). In terms of latent symptom growth, the\nexplained variance increases from 19% to 51% (an increase\nof 168%). These results also support the perspective that\nperceived support accounts for variation in trajectories of\ndepressive symptoms, whereas the results from Table 3 indicate\nthat received support does not.\nDISCUSSION\nTo date, the gerontologic literature has often discussed\ndisability and depressive symptomatology as life course pro-\ncesses in later life; our theories and hypotheses regarding them\nhave increasingly emphasized them as such, but our research\ndesigns and analyses have remained effectively cross-sectional.\nFurthermore, regarding social support, literature conceptualizing\nsupport as a life course process, especially in later life, has been\nvirtually nonexistent. Yet, just as stress can be conceptualized as\na process--indeed, the notion of chronic stress implies a pro-\ncess--social support can be considered a life course process that\nemerges/develops in response to stress processes such as growth\nin disability in later life. In this research, we have explicitly\nmodeled stress, depressive symptoms, and social support as\nprocesses in later life. Our goal has been to examine the\nrelationship between long-term patterns of disability at the\nindividual level--a type of chronic stressor--and long-term\npatterns of one of its psychological consequences--depressive\nsymptoms. In addition, we considered long-term patterns of\nsocial support, both received/actual support and perceived\navailability of support, as potential temporal--and not simply\nstatic--mediators of this relationship.\nThe results strongly support the conceptualization of\ndisability, depressive symptoms, and support as linear pro-\ncesses in later life. Specifically, a considerable amount of the\nvariance in the observed individual-level time-specific measures\nwas explained via a linear growth specification for each\n(nonlinear specifications were also attempted but produced\nsimilar results). Furthermore, a considerable amount of vari-\nability in trajectories of disability, support, and symptoms was\nevident across the sample. The first model showed a strong\nrelationship between trajectories of disability and trajectories of\ndepressive symptoms, such that persons with increasing\ntrajectories of disability tend to have increasing trajectories\nof depressive symptoms. In general, these results are fairly\nconsistent with previous research showing a relationship\nbetween disability and depression or depressive symptoms\nHowever, our results extend previous research by demonstrating\nthat long-term patterns of disability are related to long-term\npatterns of depressive symptoms at the individual level, a finding\nthat is important to advancing a life course understanding of the\ninterrelationship between late-life health processes.\nSubsequent models including trajectories of received and\nperceived support showed that trajectories of perceived support,\nbut not received support, tend to match trajectories of disability\nand provide a buffer against the effect of disability on depressive\nsymptoms. The salience of perceived support as a stress\nmediator is not a new finding (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Kessler\n& McLeod, 1985). However, this work contributes to existing\nliterature in at least two ways. First, this research is the first\nto demonstrate that this mediation extends over time and not\nsimply at one point in time. In fact, this is the first research, to\nour knowledge, that considers treating social support as\na process. Much of the previous research has examined the\nrelationship between social support and depressive symptoms\nusing cross-sectional data or an inherently cross-sectional model\non short-term longitudinal data (e.g., by regressing depressive\nsymptoms on prior measures of support). Yet, to the extent that\nchronic stressors such as disability (or repeated occurrences of\nlife event stressors) (Lynch & George, 2002) can be viewed as\nlife course processes, we can expect social support to evolve in\nresponse as well, and the results indicate they do.\nOur results indicate that trajectories of received support do\nnot buffer the effect of disability on depressive symptoms but\nthat perceived support completely mediates the relationship\nbetween growth in disability and growth in symptoms. This\nsomewhat supports the work of Krause (1997) on anticipated\nand received support. Perceived support had the expected\neffect, but received support did not. Although individuals in our\nsample were more likely to report higher levels of received\nsupport as their disability levels increased (Mendes de Leon\nexacerbate the effects of disability on depressive symptoms, as\nAn important finding regarding perceived social support\nwas that the effect of latent baseline disability on baseline\ndepressive symptoms remained significant, while the effect of\ngrowth in disability on growth in depressive symptoms was\neliminated by the inclusion of perceived support. This finding\nunderscores the importance of using a truly longitudinal\nmethod for modeling and understanding life course processes.\nOur finding shows that the relationship between growth in\ndisability and growth in depressive symptoms is mediated by\ngrowth in perceived social support, whereas baseline disabil-\nity's effect on baseline depressive symptoms is not mediated by\nbaseline perceived support. Using a cross-sectional design or\nanalysis therefore would not fully reveal the importance of\nsocial support across the life course.\nDespite the significance of the findings, one of the greatest\nlimitations of these analyses is that, even with our multiwave\nlongitudinal design, direction of causality cannot be conclu-\nsively established between disability, social support, and\ndepressive symptoms. An important feature of growth model-\ning is that the method is more consistent with the concept of life\ncourse processes than traditional cross-sectional or similar\nmethods. However, a limitation is that causal direction cannot\nbe established. Indeed, this is always a problem regardless of\nthe method used, but it is also true with growth models, because\nthe multiple measures are reduced to (often) two parameters per\nindividual so that the temporal priority of one set of measures\nversus another is lost. We believe, however, that disability most\nlikely produces the need for social support and therefore\nincreases the actual receipt of support while perhaps simulta-\nneously reducing the actual perception of support. Nonetheless,\nalthough the perception of support may be reduced in the face\nof disability, it may still be sufficient (as our results indicate) to\nreduce depressive symptoms. Of course, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that those with the highest levels of depressive\nsymptoms perceive the least support--the so-called ``contam-\nination hypothesis'' (George, Blazer, Hughes, & Fowler, 1989).\nAlthough previous research has demonstrated less support for\nthis hypothesis than our causation hypothesis, even with long-\nterm longitudinal data, the direction of causality cannot be fully\nascertained. Our conclusion is that high levels of, and rapid\ngrowth in, disability may produce feelings that an individual's\nsupport is inadequate for handling disability but may nonethe-\nless be sufficient to mediate the effect of disability growth on\ndepressive symptom growth.\n"
