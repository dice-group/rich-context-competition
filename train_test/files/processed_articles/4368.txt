EMDR is briefly explained as\nis how it has been adapted to be used with pain. The case\nstudy will hopefully give professionals working in a primary\ncare environment an additional treatment option for this at\ntimes difficult to manage client group.\nThe Royal College of Psychiatry1 define MUS as\n\"Persistent physical complaints that do not have a readily\nrecognizable medical cause. The pain, worry and other\nsymptoms are nonetheless real and cause distress.\"According\nto the Royal College of Psychiatry, people of all ages with\nMUS present frequently to the health services and state that\ncontacts with primary care clinicians may be at least 50%\nmore frequent per person than in the general population, and\nthey may also account for up to 33% more secondary care\nconsultations. From a monetary point of view, MUS have\nbeen estimated to cost the National Health Service (NHS) in\nEngland \u00a33 billion every year.\nResearch suggests that up to 70% of people suffering with\nMUS will also suffer from depression and/or anxiety disor-\nders.2 In addition to the distress caused to the individual,\nmany health professionals feel frustrated and ill-equipped to\ntackle clinical presentations with no physical pathological\ncause. At times, individuals with MUS are debilitated by their\nconditions, are unable to work, and have poor quality of life.\nGenerally, treatment of MUS is managed within a medical\nsetting with referrals for psychological input limited.\nHowever, the spiraling cost of managing patients with MUS\nhas led to more resources being made available to address this\nproblem from an emotional and psychological perspective.\nWhat Is EMDR?\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, EMDR,\nwas developed by Francine Shapiro 25 years ago. It is a type\nof psychological therapy that was originally designed to alle-\nviate the distress of traumatic memories. The most concise\ndefinition is taken from the EMDR Institute (n.d.) website:\nShapiro's (2001) Adaptive Information Processing model posits\nthat EMDR facilitates the accessing and processing of traumatic\nmemories to bring these to an adaptive resolution.After successful\ntreatment with EMDR, affective distress is relieved, negative\nbeliefs are reformulated, and physiological arousal is reduced.\nDuring a typical EMDR session, the client focuses on\nemotionally disturbing material while focusing on an exter-\nnal stimulus in the form of therapist directed eye movements,\naudio stimulation, or tactile stimulation to create bi-lateral\nstimulation (BLS) of the brain. Shapiro (2001) believes that\nfollowing treatment of EMDR on a traumatic memory, infor-\nmation processing is enhanced and new associations are\nforged resulting in new learning, elimination of emotional\ndistress, and development of cognitive insights.\nBrief Review of the Literature\nA full in-depth theoretical underpinning of the use of EMDR\nin the treatment of MUS can be found in van Rood and de\n1British Psychological Society, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nSimon Proudlock, Chartered Psychologist and Associate Fellow of British\nPsychological Society, NHS England and Private Practice, 2nd Floor, 22-24\nCross Street, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 5SN.\nEmail: simon@counsellingpsychologysolutions.com\nEMDR and the Treatment of Medically\nUnexplained Symptoms: A Case Study\nSimon Proudlock1\n Keywords\nEMDR, pain, medically unexplained symptoms, trauma, primary care\n2 SAGE Open\n(2009) believe unprocessed traumatic experiences might\nmaintain physically unexplained complaints, and triggers to\nthat unprocessed traumatic experience trigger not only the\nmemory but also physical sensations (e.g., pain) that were\nexperienced at the time. Both authors note that the meaning\nmay either trigger a traumatic memory or the pain. This can\nrepresent a kind of trauma in itself. This two-way interaction\nbetween pain and trauma is thought to maintain both (see\nRay and Zbik (2001) review the use of EMDR therapy for\nchronic pain and note that EMDR gives benefits to chronic\npain patients not found with other treatments. They found\nEMDR can do more than just manage pain but can substan-\ntially reduce or eliminate it.\nGrant and Threlfo (2002) outline how EMDR can help to\nimprove coping and reduce chronic pain and suffering. They\nexamined the use of EMDR with three adult chronic pain\nsufferers and noticed that all clients reported substantial\ndecreases in pain levels, decreases in negative affect, and\nincreased ability to control their pain. Similarly, Hassard\nwho completed treatment to significantly reduce their pain.\nMazzola et al. (2009) also found pain tolerance was signifi-\ncantly improved for the two treatment groups using EMDR.\nEMDR and Pain\nWithin EMDR, the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP)\nmodel views chronic pain as a kind of recurring \"trauma\"\nwith the traumatic event consisting of recurring pain attacks\nor constant physical discomfort (EMDR Part 3 Training\nManual Courtesy of Alexandra Richman, n.d.). Mazzola\nincludes the processing and desensitization of both; the auto-\nmatic emotional response to the pain sensation, and the auto-\nmatic components of the stored memories related to the\netiology of pain.\" Grant (2009) also notes that chronic pain\ncan represent a kind of trauma in itself as pain can involve\nfeelings of helplessness, intrusive thoughts, loss of control,\nand increased physiological arousal.\nGrant's (2012) chronic pain protocol divides the targets\ninto trauma, pain, or some aspect of how the pain is affecting\nthe person's life. As with trauma, the Negative Cognition\n(NC) reflects how the person feels about themselves. The\npositive cognition represents what they would like to be able\nto say about themselves. Other elements of the target, such as\nfeelings sensations and subjective units of distress (SUD),\nare more or less the same with the exception that the SUDs\nmay be used to rate pain or emotional distress.\nOnce the above information has been gathered, BLS (e.g.,\neye-movements/tactile sensors) is used to desensitize the cli-\nent by asking them to focus solely on the pain. During desen-\nsitization, if any blocking beliefs are identified, cognitive\ninterweaves (such as asking the client to imagine that they\ncan see inside their bodies and see what is causing the pain,\nor asking what is stopping the pain from changing) can be\nused. Desensitization continues until the clients' pain has\nreduced. Once the pain has stabilized at a more tolerable\nlevel, installation of a positive imagery related to what the\nclient experiences now is completed, followed by the instal-\nlation of the positive cognition.\nUnlike the standard EMDR protocol, when using the pain\nprotocol, we are not necessarily expecting to reduce the rat-\ning (SUDs or level of intensity) down to a 0 or 1. In most\ncases, a reduction in the intensity of the pain, or a reduction\nin the hold the pain has on an individual's general level of\nfunctioning, is a welcome enough change. By giving clients\na greater understanding of their pain, and a degree of control\nover their pain, the client comes to believe that they can have\nmore control over the pain and its effects on their life.\nCase Background\nFull written consent was obtained from the client prior to\nwriting this article. Names and identifying details have been\nchanged.\nMichael contacted me through my private practice fol-\nlowing his search for an EMDR therapist. He had tried for\nnearly 3\u00bd years to get some sort of explanation for the pain\nemanating from his stomach/abdomen and to learn how to\nbetter manage his pain.\nHistory\nMichael is a White British male who at the commencement\nof treatment was in his late 50s. Over 4 years prior to treat-\nment, Michael was the driver of a car involved in a road traf-\nfic accident inAfrica which left him paralyzed from the chest\ndownward due to a dislocated neck and a complete break of\nthe spinal cord (injury from C6). Michael was in Africa to\nrun a marathon and was an accomplished athlete with an\ninternational reputation in extreme sports.\nFollowing the accident, Michael spent 2 weeks in hospi-\ntals in Africa before being flown back to England. Following\na 10-month stay in an NHS spinal injuries unit, he returned\nhome. It was at this time that the pain in his stomach started.\nHe reports that he received no psychological help while in\nthe spinal injuries unit.\nMichael reported that he generally felt quite anxious,\nmore so in the mornings. He had very little recollection of\nthe actual accident, remembering tiny snippets only and had\nnever had nightmares, and reported occasional flashbacks of\nthe moment when his friend shouted in the car just prior to\nimpact. Initially after coming home, he continued to work in\nhis role as an IT Manager but eventually the pain got intoler-\nable for him and he left his job.\nAt the commencement of treatment, the pain in Michael's\nabdomen was causing significant disruption to his everyday\nactivity level--he would try and do a bit of work, but very\nProudlock 3\nsoon, the pain and discomfort became too much. Similarly, it\nwas restricting him going out and doing any sort of exercise\nto strengthen his muscles. Michael had a good social net-\nwork but found that he often had to cancel social engage-\nments at the last minute due to pain flare-ups.\nPrior to seeing myself, Michael had seen two psycholo-\ngists and a hypnotist, all without much benefit.\nOn taking a full history, there were no significant traumas\nprior to the index incident. For the memories of the accident,\nMichael scored 24 on the Impact of Events\u00adRevised scale\n(Weiss & Marmar, 1996) indicating that there was no signifi-\ncant psychological trauma associated with the index incident.\nTreatment\nFollowing our initial assessment session, our second session\ncommenced with trying to help Michael install a \"safe\nplace\"--a psychological resource of a memory or image in\nwhich Michael felt safe, calm, and relaxed, together with a\nword that summed up that image and associated feeling.\nAlthough Michael did not appear to be traumatized by the\naccident itself, a psychological resource in which he could\nfeel calmer may help him cope with his fear of uncontrolla-\nble pain. We also tested which method of BLS would work\nbest with Michael. Initially, I tried eye movements, and then\near phones and then tactile sensors. Although I was initially\nreserved about using the tactile sensors due to the location of\nspinal cord damage, Michael felt these, turned up to high\nintensity, worked best for him.\nAs there was clearly a traumatic index incident, standard\nEMDR protocol was used prior to introducing the chronic pain\nprotocol to rule out that there was no residual trauma fueling\nMichael's pain. Michael identified the worst picture from the\naccident as his friend shouting his name, with the associated\nnegative belief of \"I'm stupid,\" feelings of dread, and SUD as\n5 to 6 out of 10, which he felt in his head. When using BLS, he\ninitially felt upset, but generally noticed very little change.\nAfter a few sets of BLS, Michael reported feeling less dis-\ntressed by the image and he had a new memory emerging of\nbeing in the embankment where the car came to rest following\nthe accident. He noticed that nothing changed in his body.\nAt the next session, and for the majority of sessions fol-\nlowing that, we focused solely on the pain in Michael's abdo-\nmen. We discussed the memory of when he first noticed the\npain (on returning to his home after a prolonged stay in\nthe spinal injuries unit) and subsequent memories of when\nthe pain was bad. Negative cognitions varied but focused\naround not being in control and believing he was worthless\n(\"I'm a waste of space\"). As our work progressed, the nega-\ntive cognitions changed to \"I'm Helpless.\" Later sessions\nalso identified negative cognitions focused around self-\nblame. General feelings were of frustration at not being able\nto perform activities of everyday living because of the pain.\nOn first targeting the pain using EMDR, Michael\ndescribed the pain as a burning sensation--a pressure in his\nstomach as if it had been pumped up. The color of the pain\nwas \"red,\" and the level of intensity was 8 out of 10. At the\nend of Session 3, our first session targeting just the pain, the\nlevel of intensity had reduced to a 5. Michael later reported\nthat this relief continued for the rest of the evening after our\nsession but the level returned to 8 and higher the next day.\nAt different times of the processing, Michael would expe-\nrience intense pain and at times would feel he was holding\nback his emotions. By altering the speed of the tactile sen-\nsors, we discovered that if they went slower, then the pain\nwould generally be less intense, but if they went faster, then\nthe pain would become more intense.\nMichael reported a whole range of different sensations\nand experiences over the course of our work. These, together\nwith my own observations, are listed below, as they illustrate\nthe variety of sensory changes that Michael experienced dur-\ning his treatment:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Twitching of his face, hands, and shoulders\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Getting emotionally upset\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Tension in his body\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Constantly feeling like he wanted to move his legs\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Changes in the pain--sharp, stabbing, pressure, tight,\nburning\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Changes in location and shape of the pain\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Feeling like something was going to burst out of his\nstomach\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Feeling more relaxed in his body\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Tingling in his body\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Leg feeling warm--since the accident, Michael has\nsuffered from poor circulation and always felt his legs\nwere cold (generally he does not get any feeling in his\nlegs)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Feeling like he wanted to move his foot or wanting to\nstretch\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Shudders of his entire body\nOn almost all occasions when using the BLS, the pain\nchanged in terms of intensity, location, sensation, or type of\npain. At times, these changes were associated with different\nfeelings and levels of emotional distress. Toward the end of\nour sessions, it tended to take longer for Michael to notice\nany changes in the pain. Bi-lateral sets were increased con-\nsiderably in length of time with good effect. During these\nsessions, the pain would build up, reach a peak, and then\ngradually subside again (similar to emotional distress when\nusing standard EMDR protocol).\nOnce the level of intensity of the pain had stabilized at 2/10,\nthe positive cognition of \"I can handle it\" was installed, which\nhelped reinforce Michael's belief in his ability to control his\npain.As the pain became more manageable, the focus turned to\ncurrent triggers of when he noticed the pain more (such as hear-\ning his carers take a shower while he was stuck in bed).\nIn addition to EMDR, Michael's treatment also incorporated\nSolution Focused Therapy (SFT) and Cognitive Behavioral\n4 SAGE Open\nTherapy (CBT). Using principles of behavioral activation,\nMichael was encouraged to start doing more activities even\nif he felt pain--that is, to just do something and see if the\npain gets worse.\nMichael had begun to be more aware of the pain and to\nnotice times when it was not as bad and started to question why\nthat was. Using principles of SFT, these \"exceptions\" of when\nthe pain was not as bad were explored to see whether he could\ndo more of what made the pain less (see Proudlock, 2011).\nAt our last session, Session 14, Michael expressed that he\nwas no longer really bothered by the pain. Subjectively and\nobjectively, he felt less depressed and the level of intensity of\nthe pain was around a 3 out of 10. He had written a brief but\nangry goodbye letter to pain and felt that the pain was no\nlonger consuming and controlling his life.\nAt 6-month follow-up, Michael reported he was no longer\ndepressed but had suffered from repeated bladder infections,\ncausing abdominal pain and discomfort. His main carer had\nleft after working with him for 3 years, and this had clearly\nupset him. We embarked on six further top up sessions and\nused EMDR to process this loss and the associated feelings.\nAgain Michael reported less pain in his abdomen. Michael\nhad also signed up to a sponsored cycle ride in South Africa\nDiscussion and Areas for Further\nResearch\nThere is a growing body of evidence indicating that EMDR\nis an effective psychological therapy in assisting clients with\nMUS. In this case study, EMDR helped an individual who\nhad spent over 3 years looking for an explanation and relief\nfrom abdominal pain. The exact way EMDR works in gen-\neral is still unclear, but one theory is that it decreases the\nincreased physiological arousal that maintains pain through a\nMichael was a determined and motivated client who per-\nsevered through some demanding sessions. He welcomed\narticles on EMDR and found The Body Keeps the Score (van\nder Kolk, 1994) most useful. At one point, he had to face the\nrealization that he saw himself as \"helpless\" and \"depen-\ndant\" on his caregivers for most of his needs, and this insight\nallowed him to see that some of his pain symptoms may be\npsychological in nature. On leaving a safe environment of\nthe spinal injuries unit, the reality of his situation struck him\nonce he was back home.\nThe outcomes of treatment for Michael were consider-\nable--he was able to reduce the quantity of the high potency\nsynthetic opiate painkillers he was taking as the pain became\nmore bearable and his need for medication greatly reduced\n(prior to treatment he told me he was taking analgesics like\n\"Smarties\"). He also needed to take to his bed and lie down\nless often, was able to travel in the car more regularly without\nfeeling sick (something that had caused great restriction in\nhis life), and started to socialize more with friends. He even\nhad some pain-free days which allowed him to do more exer-\ncise to strengthen his muscles and start hydrotherapy. From a\npsychological perspective, his negative cognition started to\nchange to \"I'm taking control\"--at our last session, he told\nme, \"I can do what I want even with the pain.\"\nIn this case study, it is clear that EMDR had a beneficial\neffect when other therapies seemed to have not been helpful\nto Michael. Some of the extenuating factors that may have\naided the benefit of EMDR may be the high level of motiva-\ntion that client had--he had clearly researched EMDR before\nmaking contact with me. I also made it clear from the start of\ntherapy that EMDR would not be a \"cure\" for his pain but\nmay allow him to manage the pain more effectively, clearly\nmanaging his expectations for therapy.\nAlthough EMDR was the primary therapeutic interven-\ntion in this case, the principles of CBT and SFT also played\na significant part. Throughout my clinical practice, I rarely\nuse just one type of therapy, preferring instead an eclectic\napproach that morphs itself into what the client needs at that\nparticular time. EMDR may have been the catalyst that\nallowed the benefit of Michael's other therapies to be fully\nutilized--in other cases, where I have used EMDR with cli-\nents who have had therapy before, EMDR seems to unblock\nsomething that enables increased clarity for the client, allow-\ning the benefits of previous therapies to kick in.\nA limitation of the study was the lack of objective mea-\nsures to quantify the changes in Michael's pain, anxiety, and\nfunctioning. Another limitation was the fact that it only\ninvolves one case. As such, with no control case to measure\nagainst, it is hard to tell whether Michael would have started\nto feel better with the passage of time irrespective of any\ntherapy offered.\nConclusion\nMUS are notoriously difficult to treat. This case study indi-\ncates that EMDR could have potential as a treatment for\npeople with this kind of pain. Like other reports regarding\nEMDR treatment of pain, this case suggests that EMDR can\nhelp alleviate the pain and improve coping--traditional\napproaches do not tend to be very effective for pain relief.\nThe amount of sessions required, in this case 20 in total, also\nindicates that EMDR can be more efficient than traditional\napproaches to pain management.\nAlthough EMDR was the main modality used in this case,\nmy own and other practitioners experience is that when used\nin conjunction with other therapies, the psychological bene-\nfits for the client seem to be magnified when a combination of\ntherapies are used. The level of client motivation may also\nplay a key part in the successful outcomes of EMDR for\nMUS--in this case study, the client was highly motivated and\nProudlock 5\nalready had some insight into the psychological mechanisms\nthat may be interacting with his physical pain.\nThis case adds to the growing literature regarding EMDR\ntreatment of chronic pain. More research is needed to inves-\ntigate whether the method is efficacious with other MUS suf-\nferers and whether EMDR needs to be considered as an\noption early on in treatment.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\nhttp://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/improvingphysica-\nlandmh/medicallyunexplainedsymptoms.aspx\n2.
