Weissman\nPrologue: One of the toughest tasks facing mental health poli-\ncymakers and providers is to determine the need for services.\nThree streams of research contribute to the search for policy so-\nlutions: epidemiology, which addresses the prevalence of mental\nillness; clinical research, which addresses the effectiveness of\ntreatment; and mental health policy research, which deals with\nfinancial and organizational issues. The lead author of this pa-\nper, the late Gerald L. Klerman, was uniquely positioned to of-\nfer leadership in all three areas. His high standing in govern-\nment and academia lent credibility to his strong insistence that\nscientific and policy questions should be viewed separately. De-\nfining need for services is a policy question; defining prevalence,\na scientific one. Policy should not be derived directly from sci-\nence, he contended; rather, science should inform policymakers\nand aid their decisions. This paper looks at the need for services\nfrom an epidemiologic perspective, in the context of the high\nknown prevalence of psychiatric conditions throughout the U.S.\npopulation. Before his death in April 1992, Klerman was pro-\nfessor of psychiatry and associate chairman for research at Cor-\nnell's Department of Psychiatry. He was administrator of the\nAlcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration dur-\ning Jimmy Carter's presidency, before which he conducted and\nled psychiatric research at Harvard and Yale. Mark Olfson,\ncurrently an assistant professor of psychiatry at Cornell, re-\nceived his medical degree from Northwestern University and\ntrained in psychiatry at Yale. Andrew Leon is assistant profes-\nsor of biostatistics in psychiatry at Cornell. Myrna Weissman is\nprofessor of epidemiology in psychiatry at the Columbia Univer-\nsity College of Physicians and Surgeons and is director of the Di-\nvision of Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology, New York State\nPsychiatric Institute.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, opinion varies on what constitutes\nneed for treatment. Third-party payers, service providers, and sympto-\nmatic individuals often have very different notions of who should receive\ncare and under what circumstances. In the area of mental health, where\nspecialists openly disagree over the fundamental nature of illness and its\ntreatment, the ground is particularly fertile for dispute over when treat-\nment is necessary or even desirable.\nThe controversy over need goes to the heart of why we as a society\npurchase mental health care. Should we seek to provide treatment to all\npersons who suffer from mental disorders? Or should we limit care to\nthose who are functionally impaired by their condition, or to those who\nhave a high likelihood of recovering the ability to function? Should\npriority be given to people who have the most severe disorders, or to\nthose whose conditions are most costly to society? Such difficult ques-\ntions are central to the ongoing debate over need.\nDiscussions of need rightfully belong in the domain of political rather\nthan scientific discourse. Conclusions are ultimately based on values\nrather than facts. At the same time, however, research plays an impor-\ntant role in informing the decision-making process. Epidemiologic re-\nsearch provides information on the scope of mental illness, clinical\nresearch offers data on the efficacy of available treatments, and mental\nhealth services research describes organizational and financial dimen-\nsions of care.\nIn this paper we examine the need for and use of mental health\nservices from an epidemiologic perspective. We summarize available\ninformation on the extent of mental illness, its costs to society, and the\ndegree to which mentally ill persons currently receive mental health\ntreatment. We close with some thoughts on two general strategies for\nnarrowing the gap between need for and provision of care.\nExpanding The Scope Of Mental Illness\nAny effort to measure the extent or range of psychiatric problems\nrequires consensus on the definition of mental illness. Historically, there\nhas been a trend toward expanding conceptions of mental illness. In the\nnineteenth century mental illness was almost exclusively related to two\nconditions, lunacy and idiocy, which are roughly equivalent to what we\nnow refer to as psychotic disorders and mental retardation. Only gradu-\nally in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was there an\nincrease in public awareness that large numbers of individuals in the\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Neurasthenia, anxiety states, phobias, and depression\nbecame increasingly considered within the scope of mental health and\nmental illness. Persons with these conditions were seen as benefiting\nfrom if not requiring mental health care.\nToday we see an even further expansion in the range of mental health\nconcerns. Conditions such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, and\nchild abuse have become defined as mental health problems. This ex-\npansion is related to the growing secularization of society and an increas-\ning reliance on the health care system. As the United States has become\nmore urbanized and better educated, psychological-mindedness has in-\ncreased. With these changes, a growing segment of the population has\nsought access to mental health services.\nMeasuring Mental Illness\nPsychiatric epidemiologists concern themselves with studying the dis-\ntribution and determinants of psychiatric problems in defined popula-\ntions. In recent years psychiatric epidemiologists have employed the\nsame criteria for mental illness that clinicians use in practice. This\nadvance has been made possible by two related developments: accep-\ntance of a diagnostic system based on observable symptoms (that is, the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, or\nDSM-III) and development of structured interviews.\nThe publication of the DSM-III in 1980 was a landmark event in the\nmodern history of descriptive psychiatry.1 It provided a reliable diagnos-\ntic system to identify individuals with specific mental disorders based on\nreadily observable psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric researchers devised\nstructured interviews to apply these criteria to clinical and community\nsamples.2 The capacity to measure the prevalence of mental illness in\nthe general population has markedly increased the relevance of psychi-\natric epidemiology to mental health policy deliberations.\nThe most ambitious psychiatric epidemiologic study to date is the\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Epidemiologic Catch-\nresidents across five U.S. communities were selected for intensive psy-\nchiatric examination.3 The ECA survey remains the most comprehen-\nsive source of information on the prevalence of mental illness in the\nUnited States.\nPrevalence of mental illness. The ECA survey revealed that diagnos-\nable mental illness is highly prevalent in the general population. Ap-\nproximately one in six adult Americans (15.4 percent) suffer from a\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

During a six-month period, 15.1 percent of\nadults meet criteria for a mental disorder that is unrelated to drugs or\nalcohol, 4.7 percent meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, and\n2.0 percent meet criteria for drug abuse or dependence.4\nWhen these prevalence estimates are extrapolated to the 1990 U.S.\nadult population, the results are truly astonishing. Each month nearly\nthirty million adult Americans meet criteria for a mental disorder,\nthirty-five million over a six-month period, and sixty million at some\npoint in their lives. Moreover, many psychiatric researchers believe that\nthese estimates are conservative. The ECA findings do not include\nAlzheimer's disease, childhood or adolescent disorders, generalized anxi-\nety disorder, and many of the personality disorders. The findings also do\nnot include the large number of persons with low-grade conditions that\nfail to reach the diagnostic threshold but nonetheless are correlated with\nsignificant disability.5 However, even without these other conditions,\nthe ECA data provide dramatic evidence of the vast scope of mental\nillness in America.\nOne strategy for narrowing the scope is to focus solely on persons with\nmore severe conditions. Mental disorders vary widely in the extent to\nwhich they impair or disable affected individuals. Simple phobias, for\nexample, have a comparatively high lifetime prevalence (12.5 percent)\nbut have relatively little impact on quality of life. In contrast, schizo-\nphrenia, which has a lifetime prevalence of only about 1.3 percent,\ncarries a heavy toll on most affected individuals from adolescence\nthrough adulthood. For this reason, prevalence alone does not necessar-\nily provide the most useful guide to the extent or magnitude of mental\nillness in America.\nNIMH defines persons with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder,\nand major depression as having severe mental disorders.6 By this defini-\ntion, approximately 4.6 million adult Americans currently suffer from\nsevere mental illness, and 11.2 million have been so affected at some\npoint in their lives.7 These numbers provide a more manageable target\nfor policymakers and mental health planners than the cumulative esti-\nmates of mental disorder provide. However, diagnosis is only a rough\nindex of illness severity.\nFunctional impairment and duration of illness are other key dimen-\nsions of illness severity.8 Some individuals may have \"severe diagnoses,\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

On\nthe other hand, many individuals, such as those with severe personality\ndisorders or substance use disorders, may run highly incapacitating\ncourses of illness.\nThe ECA survey unfortunately included very few measures of func-\ntional impairment. By adding impairment measures to future surveys,\npsychiatric epidemiology has an opportunity to increase its relevance to\nmental health service planning. In addition to collecting information on\nthe prevalence of the symptoms necessary to make a diagnosis, it would\nbe useful to know something about vocational and homemaking role\nperformance, self-care skills, capacity for independent living, and eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency.\nCost Of Mental Illness\nMental illness imposes a substantial economic burden on society.9\nCross-sectional cost estimates provide insight into the size and location\nof these expenditures and revenue losses. Any serious consideration of\nunmet need requires a familiarity with how society is currently allocating\ntreatment resources and where it is absorbing financial losses stemming\nfrom mental illness.\nDorothy Rice and her colleagues at the University of California, San\nFrancisco, have provided the most comprehensive national estimates of\nthe direct and indirect costs attributable to alcohol, drug, and mental\n(ADM) disorder.10 Direct costs are the estimated dollar expenditures\nrelated to the treatment of an illness and typically include expenditures\nfor institutional care, professional services, medications, and rehabilita-\ntion services. Indirect costs include the estimated value of lost produc-\ntivity, lost work, and losses due to premature death.\nRice and colleagues estimate that the total national core cost of ADM\nper U.S. citizen. Most of these costs are attributable to mental disorders\n($99.2 billion), but alcohol abuse ($58.2 billion) and to a lesser extent\ndrug abuse ($10.6 billion) also account for a significant share.\nIndirect costs account for approximately two-thirds of total core costs\n($116.6 billion). The indirect costs are largely related to mental illness\n($56.7 billion) and alcohol abuse ($51.4 billion) rather than to drug\nabuse ($8.5 billion). In contrast, mental illness ($42.5 billion), but not\nalcohol abuse ($6.8 billion) or drug abuse ($2.1 billion), accounts for the\nvast majority of direct treatment costs. Therefore, in relation to lost\noutput (indirect costs), society has made a far greater investment in the\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The hu-\nmanitarian and economic consequences of this national policy are of\ncritical importance to the debate over unmet need.\nDespite a quarter-century of reductions in the number of hospital beds\nin state mental hospitals, 58 percent of the treatment cost of mental\nillness continues to be for institutionally based care.11 However, only\nabout 3 percent of persons with a recent mental disorder have ever been\nhospitalized for psychiatric treatment.12 It is fair to conclude that the\nnation continues to invest far more heavily in the small number of\naffected individuals who require institutional care than in the much\nlarger number of mentally ill individuals who receive ambulatory care or\nno care at all.\nUse Of Mental Health Care\nAn important finding to emerge from the ECA survey is that most\nindividuals with mental disorders do not receive mental health care.13\nEven if mental health care is broadly defined to include a single visit to\na general medical provider or a mental health specialist for a mental\nhealth reason, fewer than one in five persons with a mental disorder are\nfound to have received care during the past six months. Not only are a\nlarge proportion of individuals with less severe conditions not receiving\ncare, but care is also not being provided to a substantial proportion of\npercent), and substance abuse/dependence disorders (82-92 percent).14\nOver a six-month period close to thirty million adult Americans with a\nmental disorder do not receive any mental health care, of whom ap-\nproximately 5.5 million suffer from schizophrenia, bipolar affective dis-\norder, and major depression. Thus, how need is defined clearly has a\ndramatic impact on how the debate over public mental health resources\nis framed.\nSeeking care. No straightforward relationship exists between the\npresence of a mental disorder and help-seeking behavior. Just as large\nnumbers of persons with mental disorders do not seek care, so many\nmental health visits are made by persons without an apparent mental\ndisorder. For example, approximately one-third of the persons in the\nECA sample who made a mental health visit during a six-month period\ndid not have a concurrent DSM-III disorder.15 We need to know more\nabout the type of distress and disability experienced by this large and\npoorly defined group of mental health care consumers.\nNeed for services should also not be confused with help-seeking\nbehavior. Access barriers prevent use of services by individuals who\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

At the same time, economic research suggests\nthat some ambulatory mental health care-seeking behavior is discre-\ntionary in nature.\nHealth care seeking is influenced by clinical factors, such as symptoms\nand subjective distress, and by predisposing or enabling factors, such as\nsociodemographic, geographic, economic, and attitudinal variables,16\nThe effects of nonclinical factors on use of services are generally contin-\ngent upon the presence of some clinical need,\nPhilip Leaf and colleagues provide evidence that sociodemographic\nfactors significantly influence mental health services use,17 After con-\ntrolling for diagnosis, they found that being female, between ages\ntwenty-four and sixty-five, white, and of higher educational status all\nincrease the likelihood of making a mental health visit. From a public\npolicy perspective, therefore, males, the young and elderly, nonwhites,\nand those of lower educational status are at increased risk of not receiv-\ning care.\nGeographic accessibility to treatment also influences health care seek-\ning. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are dispropor-\ntionately concentrated in urban areas. As a result, a majority of U.S,\ncounties have either very few or no psychiatrists, psychologists, or social\nworkers,18 Unmet need for mental health services may be particularly\nhigh in rural areas where geographic barriers impede access to care,\nFinancial factors also affect use of health care. The demand for mental\nhealth services appears to be more price-sensitive than is the demand for\noutpatient general medical services,19 Experimental research indicates\nthat persons assigned to a 50 percent coinsurance plan consume less\nthan half the ambulatory mental health services that persons assigned to\nfree care consume. In practice, the elasticity of demand is most evident\nin the utilization profile of those who are just above the poverty level.\nIndividuals who are near-poor--those without Medicaid whose house-\nhold incomes are below 150 percent of the poverty level--are at higher\nrisk than are other income groups of having their needs for mental\nhealth services unmet,20\nPersonal and public attitudes may also influence mental health serv-\nices use. Public opinion surveys indicate that mental illness is a highly\nrejected condition,21 Business managers, for example, have been shown\nto view mental illness as unfavorably as ex-convict status and signifi-\ncantly less favorably than heart disease, blindness, or paraplegia,22 As a\nresult of discrimination or devaluation, some individuals may try to hide\nthe fact that they suffer from a mental illness. Avoidance of necessary\ntreatment is one tragic consequence of social stigmatization.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nClosing The Gap Between Need And Treatment\nOver the past few decades two broad strategies have been advocated\nto reduce unmet need for mental health care. One emphasizes the role of\nthe specialty psychiatric sector, while the other emphasizes the role of\nthe general medical sector. These two approaches have profoundly dif-\nferent implications for service planning.\nSpecialists. The first option is to seek to have individuals with ADM\ndisorders treated by specialists in specialized treatment settings. For\nmany years this was the goal of federal mental health policy. Large\namounts of federal funds were made available for expansion of the\nnumbers of mental health professionals and for the development of new\nfacilities, particularly psychiatric units in general hospitals and commu-\nnity mental health centers. However, it became apparent in the 1970s\nthat this strategy was extremely costly, and doubt surfaced over its\ncost-efficacy.\nParallel developments were under way in the general health care\nsystem. The federal government, joined by foundations such as The\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, supported the expansion of primary\ncare. There was an attempt to slow, if not reverse, the tendency toward\nmedical subspecialization. Analysis of the ECA data confirms earlier\nfindings that the general medical and specialty mental health sectors are\nboth substantially involved in caring for persons with mental disorders.23\nGeneralists. A second option, therefore, would be to expect that not\nall individuals with ADM needs would be treated by specialists. Under\nthis plan, the goal is to enhance the capacity of the primary care sector\nto recognize, diagnose, and treat selected ADM disorders. At the same\ntime, it must be acknowledged that available evidence indicates that the\nprimary care sector has not shown itself skilled in these clinical roles.\nAccumulating evidence suggests that in primary care there is a high\ndegree of underrecognition, underdiagnosis, and undertreatment of con-\nditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, and alcoholism.24 Mental\nhealth care in the general medical sector is often superficial, and some\nhealth policy analysts warn that casting general medical providers as an\nalternative to specialized treatment will reinforce efforts to limit benefits\nfor specialty care.25\nAn example of the type of initiative that would be vigorously pursued\nif the general medical sector option were chosen is the NIMH Depres-\nsion Awareness, Recognition, and Treatment Program (D/ART).26 Un-\nder this program, NIMH is assembling workshops and educational mate-\nrials to help health providers, including primary care clinicians, recog-\nnize and treat depression. The program is modeled after the successful\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Beyond an extensive educational campaign to\ninvolve physicians and other medical staff, an evaluation process would\nneed to be developed to assess the efficacy of these efforts.\nMental Health Care And Values\nApproximately one in five adult Americans meet criteria for having a\nmental disorder over a six-month period. The vast majority of these\npeople do not receive any treatment for their symptoms. For planners of\nmental health services, the question arises: What is the relationship\nbetween the high prevalence of mental disorders and the need for\nmental health services?\nThe answer to this question turns on value judgments about the\nfunction of mental health care. To the extent that society purchases\nmental health services for humanitarian purposes, unmet need is mas-\nsive, and priority should be given to those who have the most serious\nconditions and are presumably in the greatest pain.\nTo the extent that society purchases mental health services for utili-\ntarian or economic purposes, policy decisions will be driven by cost/\nbenefit analyses and considerations about the restoration of occupa-\ntional productivity. Because little research currently exists to guide this\nline of policy planning, it is not possible to state with certainty how this\npolicy would redistribute service priorities.29 In general, however, prior-\nity would be given to persons with depression, anxiety disorders, and\nperhaps alcoholism who have a significant likelihood of recovering\noccupational productivity and improved quality of life.\nEpidemiologic data have historically played an important role in\ninforming U.S. mental health policy. With the development of criteria-\nbased mental disorders and methods for determining the community\nprevalence of these disorders, psychiatric epidemiology has expanded its\nrole in policy discussions. As measures of functional impairment are\nadded to diagnostic epidemiologic surveys, the relevance of this research\nwill continue to increase. By providing quantitative data that relate\ndirectly to the question of need for services, psychiatric epidemiology\nenlightens the debate over one of the most important health care policy\nissues of our time.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
