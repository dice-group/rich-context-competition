Cut-off points were selected as the low or the mean\npercentile value within the category. Overweight prevalences for these groupings were compared with prevalences\ncalculated using the month-speci\u00aec values.\nRESULTS: The effects of grouping and cut-off point selection on overweight prevalence estimates were generally\nsmall; however, the combination of 12 month groupings and the low value led to an overestimation by up to 3\npercentage points. Within the 12 month groupings, the \u00aerst 6 months differed systematically from the second\nCONCLUSIONS: Although age categorization may often have little effect on prevalence estimates, prevalence may\nsometimes be overestimated by as much as 3 percentage points. Use of narrower age categorizations than those used\nto construct the reference values may result in systematic biases. It is important to understand how age was handled\nin the construction of the reference population and to select age categories consistent with those used for the\nreference population.\nKeywords: overweight; obesity; prevalence; health surveys; children; adolescents; age; body mass index; growth\ncharts; nutrition surveys; body weight; epidemiologic methods\nIntroduction\nChildren and adolescents may be de\u00aened as over-\nweight using any one of a variety of reference\npercentiles based on body mass index in various\npopulations. Some of the available references and\nsome issues surrounding their use have been discussed\nelsewhere.1,2 The revised version of the US growth\ncharts includes values for body mass index (BMI)\npercentiles tabulated by single month of age.3 Other\nreferences may show BMI percentile values tabulated\nby single years of age or by other age groupings.4 \u00b1 7\nIt is not always clear what is the correct procedure\nto follow when the ages of children in a study sample\nfall between the tabulated ages for the reference\nvalues. Ages of children in the study sample could\nbe rounded to the tabulated ages, so that, for example,\nif the tabulated ages are in single years, the ages of\n8 y, 6 months through the age of 9 y, 5 months could\nbe rounded to age 9 y. Alternatively ages of children\nin the study sample could be truncated (eg age at last\nbirthday) to the tabulated ages, so that ages of 9 y,\n0 months through the age of 9 y, 11 months would be\ntruncated to age 9 y. Another possibility is that the\nreference values could be interpolated between the\ntabulated ages to provide reference values for ages\nother than those tabulated. Another set of issues may\narise from how data on the ages of the study sample\nwere collected. If data for the study sample were only\ncollected on age at last birthday, but the reference\nshows age to the nearest month, it is again not clear\nhow age should be handled relative to the reference.\nThe objective of this paper is to explore the effects\non overweight prevalence of different methods of\ncategorizing age. Month-speci\u00aec BMI cut-off values\nfrom the revised CDC-US growth charts are applied to\nseveral US national data sets with ages categorized\nin a variety of ways.\nMethods\nAnalytic data set\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) was conducted from 1988 to\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics\n*Correspondence: KM Flegal, National Center for Health\nE-mail: kmf2@cdc.gov\nwww.nature.com/ijo\n(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC). A nationally representative\nsample of the US civilian non-institutionalized popu-\nlation was selected using a complex, strati\u00aeed, multi-\nstage probability cluster sampling design. A home\ninterview was followed by a physical examination in\na mobile examination center. A description of the plan\nand operation of the survey has been published.8\nNHANES III is the most recent in a series of cross-\nsectional health examination surveys carried out by\nNCHS. For children and adolescents ages 6 \u00b1 17 y,\ndata on age and BMI were also used from two earlier\nsurveys in the series, Cycles II and III of the National\nhave also been published.9,10 NHES II included chil-\ndren aged 6 \u00b1 11 y and NHES III included adolescents\nThe study population included all children and\nadolescents aged 6 \u00b1 17 y from NHES II, NHES III\nand NHANES III. In all surveys, weight and height\nwere measured using standardized techniques and\nequipment.11 Body mass index (BMI) was calculated\nas weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). For\nall surveys, sample weights were used that took into\naccount the sample design and the probabilities of\nselection.\nAge categorization\nThe CDC growth charts for the United States, which\nare a revised version of the 1977 NCHS growth charts,\ninclude values for body mass index (BMI) percentiles\nand other anthropometric data.3 These values were\nbased on data from the series of US health examina-\ntion surveys. However, NHANES III children were\nnot included in the reference population for BMI for\nages 6 y and above because of the increasing trends in\noverweight for children in that survey.12\nFor all surveys, ages were available as age in\nmonths at the time of examination, with age in\nmonths truncated to the last full month (so that a\nchild age 73 months, 2 weeks would be considered\nto be 73 months old). The revised CDC-US growth\ncharts provide reference percentiles for single months\nof age, expressed as the midpoint of the month (for\nexample reference values for children from 73.0 \u00b1\nAge groupings of three different lengths were\nconstructed using 3, 6 or 12-month intervals. Three\nmethods were used to select BMI 85th and 95th\npercentile reference values corresponding to these\nage groupings. One approach was to select the\nmonth-speci\u00aec BMI 85th or 95th percentile value\ncorresponding to the lower end of the grouped age\ncategory (low value); others were to select the mean\n(mean value) and the median (median value) of the\nmonth-speci\u00aec BMI 85th or 95th percentile values\nover all the months included in the grouped age\ncategory. Because the means and medians were\nalmost identical, only the results using means are\nshown. Examples of these groupings and the asso-\nciated low value and mean value cut-off points are\nshown in Table 1 for selected ages.\nFor each child, overweight was de\u00aened as a BMI\nvalue equal to or greater than the month-of-age- and\nsex-speci\u00aec 85th or 95th percentile values from the\nUS growth charts. For the purposes of this paper, this\nde\u00aenition using the month-speci\u00aec BMI values was\nconsidered to represent the `true' overweight status.\nThe prevalence of overweight determined using the\nother cut-off points was compared to this prevalence.\nSensitivity for a given cut-off point was estimated\nas the proportion of those classi\u00aeed as overweight by\nthe month-speci\u00aec BMI percentile values who were\nalso classi\u00aeed as overweight using that cut-off point.\nSpeci\u00aecity for a given cut-off point was calculated as\nthe proportion of those classi\u00aeed as not overweight by\nthe month-speci\u00aec BMI percentile values who were\nalso classi\u00aeed as not overweight using that cut-off\npoint.\nResults\nThe difference between the single-month-of-age\nvalues and the mean or low cut-off points was\nTable 1 Examples of the value of BMI cut-off points for selected age categories\nLow value Mean value\nAge (months) value of BMI 3 months 6 months 12 months 3 months 6 months 12 months\nAge categorization and overweight prevalence estimation\nKM Flegal\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ncalculated for each month of age and averaged over\nall months of age by sex for each survey for both the\n85th and the 95th percentiles. The mean difference\nand the standard deviation of the difference are shown\nin Table 2. When the low value was used for the cut-\noff point, the average differences were greater than\nzero and increased with the width of the age cate-\ngories. As expected, there was no difference on\naverage between the mean values within any category\nand the month-speci\u00aec values. The standard devia-\ntions of the differences increased with increasing\ncategory length and varied little otherwise.\nEffects on the estimated prevalence of overweight\nThe prevalence of overweight according to the 85th\npercentile is shown in Table 3 by age, sex, survey,\nmethod of selecting a cut-off point (low value or mean\nvalue) and category length (3, 6 or 12 months). The\ndifferences, also shown in the table, are calculated as\nthe estimated prevalence of overweight for the given\nsubgroup minus the prevalence calculated using the\nsingle-month-of-age groupings. Thus, for example, for\nboys 6 \u00b1 11 y old in NHES IIaIII, the prevalence of\noverweight calculated using the original month-\nspeci\u00aec BMI percentile values was 12.4%. When\nages were grouped into 3 month intervals and the\nlow value was selected as the cut-off point, the\nWhen the low value was selected as the cut-off\npoint, all differences were positive, showing that the\nprevalence of overweight was overestimated for all\nsex, age and survey subgroups. This overestimation\nwas slight for the 3 month age groupings, always less\nthan 1 percentage point, and somewhat higher for the\n6 month age groupings, sometimes greater than 1\npercentage point. The largest differences were seen\nwhen 12 month age groupings were used with the low\nvalue as a cut-off point. In all sex \u00b1 age \u00b1 survey\nsubgroups, the prevalence of overweight (85th per-\ncentile) was overestimated with the low value cut-off\npoint by 1 percentage point or more, and sometimes\nby as much as 2 or even 3 percentage points.\nWhen the mean value was selected as the cut-off\npoint, there was no systematic tendency for the pre-\nvalence of overweight to be either overestimated or\nunderestimated. Differences were slight in all sex \u00b1\nage \u00b1 survey subgroups, everywhere less than 1 per-\ncentage point and almost everywhere less than 0.5\npercentage points.\nSimilar analyses for the 95th percentile are shown\nin Table 4. The general results were similar to those\nseen for the 85th percentile. Choosing the low value\nas the cut-off point always resulted in an overestimate\nTable 2 Mean and standard deviations of differences between cut-off points and single-month-\nof-age BMI 85th and 95th percentile values by sex\nMales Females Males Females\nType of Category\ncut-off point length Mean s.d.

The absolute\ndifferences were not as large as those seen for the 85th\npercentile values. When the mean value within the age\ncategory was selected as the cut-off point, there was\nno systematic tendency for either overestimation or\nunderestimation and the average differences were\nslight.\nSensitivity and speci\u00aecity\nEven though prevalence estimates agree, different\nmethods might classify individuals differently. The\nsensitivity and speci\u00aecity for each age grouping\nrelative to the month-speci\u00aec BMI percentile values,\nwere calculated. As expected, for the low value cut-\noff points, the sensitivity was always 100%, indicating\nthat all children who were identi\u00aeed as overweight\nrelative to the month-speci\u00aec 85th or 95th percentile\nBMI value were also identi\u00aeed as overweight by the\nlow value cut-off points for all age groupings.

For the second 6\nmonths, the overestimation was greater than 3 percen-\ntage points. The low value cut-off point was perfectly\nsensitive (100%) relative to the month-speci\u00aec cut-off\npoints, but the speci\u00aecity was everywhere less than\n100%, leading to an overestimate of the prevalence of\nTable 4 Differences between the prevalence of overweight (95th percentile) for given cut-off points and category lengths\nand the month-speci\u00aec prevalences by age, sex and survey\nMales Females Males Females\nCut-off\nPrevalence of overweight (%)\nDifferences in prevalence (percentage points)\nTable 5 Effect on prevalence of overweight (85th percentile) and on sensitivity and speci\u00aecity of cut-off\npoints derived for 12-month age groupings applied to the \u00aerst and second 6 months of the year of age by sex\nand survey\nPrevalence difference Sensitivity Speci\u00aecity\nCutpoint Survey Months of year Male Female Male Female Male Female\nAge categorization and overweight prevalence estimation\nKM Flegal\nInternational Journal of Obesity\noverweight. Speci\u00aecities were lower for the second\n6 months, leading to a greater overestimate in this\ncategory than in the \u00aerst 6 month period. Although the\nspeci\u00aecities were high, inspection of the table shows\nthat even a speci\u00aecity of 96%, coupled with a sensi-\ntivity of 100%, was suf\u00aecient to lead to an over-\nestimation of more than 3 percentage points within the\nsecond 6 month subgrouping.\nWhen the mean value for the 12 month category\nwas chosen as the cut-off point, the overall prevalence\nestimates were very close to those obtained using the\nmonth-speci\u00aec BMI percentile values. However, there\nwas a systematic difference between months 0 \u00b1 5 and\nmonths 6 \u00b1 11. The prevalence was systematically\noverestimated for the \u00aerst 6 months of the 12, and\nwas systematically underestimated for the second 6\nmonths. The overestimation and underestimation were\nof similar magnitude, so the net effect on the total\nprevalence over the 12 month period was small. For\nthe \u00aerst 6 months of the age category, the 12 month\nmean cut-off point was perfectly speci\u00aec, but not\nquite as sensitive. For the second 6 months, the cut-\noff point was perfectly sensitive but not quite as\nspeci\u00aec. These minor differences in sensitivity and\nspeci\u00aecity resulted in underestimates of prevalence\nfor the \u00aerst 6 months and overestimates of prevalence\nfor the second 6 months of about 1 percentage point or\ngreater.\nDiscussion\nExactly how age should be handled relative to refer-\nence values for BMI is not always obvious. These\nresults show that, depending on the population, the\npercentile, the reference, the age categorization and\nthe way the cut-off point is chosen, prevalence esti-\nmates may be affected very little or may vary by as\nmuch as 2 or 3 percentage points.\nThe effects on prevalence noted here arise from the\nslight differences between the month-of-age BMI\npercentile values and the cut-off points for the broader\nage groupings. If the proportion of the population\nfalling into this gap is small, the effects on the\nprevalence will be minor. The population and the\npercentile determine how many people fall between\nthe month-of-age BMI percentile values and the\ncut-off points for the wider groupings. For heavier\npopulations, or at lower percentiles, when the true\nprevalences are higher, it appears that the absolute\neffects of misclassi\u00aecation are likely to be greater. In\nthe data examined here, the largest absolute effects\nwere seen for the higher prevalences based on the 85th\npercentiles, even though the absolute differences\nbetween cut-off points were greater at the 95th\npercentiles.\nFor the reference, it is crucial to understand what\nage category a given value is intended to represent.\nFor example, does a value labeled 9 y represent a\nvalue for children aged exactly 9 y, 0 months? Or does\nit represent a value for children ages 9 y, 0 months\nthrough and including 9 y, 11 months? Or could it\nrepresent a value for children ages 8 y, 6 months\nthrough 9 y, 5 months? This requires some knowledge\nof how the standard was derived. For example, Must\net al, when smoothing the NHANES I data, grouped\nchildren and adolescents into single year of age\ngroupings based on age at last birthday and then\nsmoothed those points.5 Thus in that reference, the\nvalue labeled age 9 y represents all 9-y-olds in the\nNHANES I sample, ranging from age 9 y 0 months up\nto, but not including, children aged 10 y 0 months.\nBecause the average age of children within year-of-\nage groupings is likely to represent approximately the\nmidpoint of the range, these values may be considered\nto represent approximately the value for a child aged\n9.5 y. Given this, an appropriate procedure when using\nthis reference, is to group children by year of age\nbased on age at last birthday (eg from 9 y 0 months to\n9 y 11 months) and to evaluate all children in that\ngroup using the reference value labeled age 9 y.\nOther references may have been created using a\ndifferent approach. For example, for the revised CDC-\nUS growth charts, reference percentiles were created\nby smoothing values for single completed months of\nage. Because each point represents a value for the\nwhole month, the values are labeled with the midpoint\nof the month. Thus the value for children ages 9 y 0\nmonths up through 9 y 0.9 months is represented as\nmonths. If the only data on age available for the study\nsample were age at last birthday, then the most\nappropriate cut-off point to use relative to this refer-\nence would probably be the average or the midpoint of\nthe reference values over the age range of 9 y 0.5\nAge may be handled in other ways. One possibility\nis that a reference might include point values calcu-\nmediate values, as for example was done by Cole and\nassociates.7 Here, ages could be rounded to the nearest\nhalf-year or truncated to the nearest whole year. The\nvalue for age 9.0 could be considered as the approx-\na reference value for that age range. Alternatively, the\nvalue for age 9.5 could be considered as the approx-\nimate midpoint for the range 9.0 \u00b1 9.9 y and used as a\nreference value for children 9 y of age at last birthday.\nAnother possibility is that a reference includes values\nfor 9.0 and 10.0 y that represent data centered around\nthose values (eg 8.5 \u00b1 9.5 y). Here also, rounding data\nto the nearest year would be most appropriate, rather\nthan using age at last birthday (truncating). In all\nthese cases, to know how age should be handled\nrequires some understanding of how the reference\nwas constructed.\nThis information may not always be readily avail-\nable. When these references are reproduced, the\ninformation about how ages were used in the\nAge categorization and overweight prevalence estimation\nKM Flegal\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nconstruction of the reference may not always be\nincluded. For instance, the original article by Must\net al describes how the age intervals were con-\nstructed.5 However, when these values were reprinted\nin the monograph by the WHO Expert Committee,\nthis information on how the age intervals were con-\nstructed was not included.4 Thus it could, for example,\nbe thought that the tabulated values for 9 and 10 y\nwere point estimates for the ages 9.0 and 10.0 y and\nthat an approximate reference value for 9.5 y could be\ngenerated by interpolation. Actually, since the value\nlabeled 9 y represents approximately 9.5 y and the\nvalue labeled 10 y represents approximately 10.5 y,\nan interpolated value half-way between the two would\nrepresent approximately 10.0 y.\nThese results also suggest that caution should be\nexercised when trying to make prevalence estimates\nwithin \u00aener age categories than those used by the\noriginal reference. When children were grouped into\n12 month age categories and the mean values within\nthe category were used as the cut-off points, the\noverall prevalence estimate for a given 12 month\ncategory was quite similar to that when the single\nmonth-of-age cut-off points were used. However,\nthere was a systematic bias such that the prevalence\nof overweight for children in the \u00aerst 6 months of\nthe range was overestimated and the prevalence for\nchildren in the second 6 months of the range was\nunderestimated, with these errors approximately com-\npensating for each other. These results suggest that if\nstandards are based on 12 month-of-age groupings,\nthen data should not be analyzed or presented by 6\nmonth-of-age categories, and, more generally, that\ndata should not be analyzed or presented by narrower\nage categories than the age categories used for refer-\nence values. If narrower age categories are desired,\nthen an appropriate procedure might be to interpolate\nfrom the tabulated reference values to intermediate\nages. As a corollary, there appears to be no advantage\nto grouping data in broader age categories than those\nused by the reference either. Thus, using the narrowest\nage categories that are consistent with the reference is\npreferable.\nSummary and conclusions\nAlthough age categorization may often have little\neffect on prevalence estimates, there are circum-\nstances in which prevalence may be overestimated\nby as much as 3 percentage points. Age categoriza-\ntions narrower than those used to construct the\nreference values may be affected by systematic\nbiases unless the reference values are interpolated\nto match the narrower age categories. It is important\nto understand how age was handled in the construc-\ntion of the reference population and to select age\ncategories that are consistent with the reference\nvalues being used.\nReferences\n1 Flegal KM.
