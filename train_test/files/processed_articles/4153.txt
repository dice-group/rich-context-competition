    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: To examine the role of microRNA (miR)-205 in proliferation, migration and invasion of\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\nMethods: The human NPC cell line CNE2 was transfected with miR-205 mimic, anti-miR-205\ninhibitor or scrambled oligonucleotide (control). Cell proliferation was assessed via MTT assay.\nCell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell migration and Matrigel\u00d5 invasion assay,\nrespectively. Radiation induced apoptosis was quantified via Caspase-Glo3/7 assay. Apoptotic\nproteins and epithelial\u00admesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were semiquantified by Western\nblot analysis.\nResults: Overexpression of miR-205 increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of CNE2\ncells, and decreased radiation-induced apoptosis compared with control cells. MiR-205 over-\nexpression downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated Snail expression via downregulation of\nPTEN and upregulation of AKT.\nConclusion: MiR-205 plays vital roles in tumourigenesis and tumour progression in NPC, and may\nbe a potential treatment target.\n",

It is therefore important to investigate\nthe molecular mechanisms and identify pre-\ndictive markers in NPC.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-\ncoding RNA molecules that post-transcrip-\ntionally regulate gene expression by binding\nto the 30-UTR of their target mRNAs.6\nMiRNAs regulate many biological func-\ntions including tumour development, differ-\nentiation, proliferation and apoptosis.7\nExpression profiling has shown that\nmiRNA expression is different in NPC\ntissue compared with normal nasopharyn-\ngeal tissue, and aberrant miRNAs are\ncorrelated with clinical stage.8 In addition,\nsome studies have demonstrated that EBV-\nencoded miRNAs play a critical role in the\nregulation of EBV infection and latency.9\nGrowing evidence suggests that miRNAs\naffect NPC carcinogenesis and metastasis by\nactivating various signalling pathways.10\nFor example, several miRNAs activate c-\nMyc, which then regulates tumour cell\ngrowth and carcinogenesis;11 in addition,\nMiR-200a regulation of ZEB2 and b-catenin\npromotes NPC cell migration and\nThe aim of the present study was to\nexamine the roles of miR-205 in the prolif-\neration, migration and invasion of NPC.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nThe human NPC cell line CNE2 was\nobtained from the Cancer Centre of\nHangzhou First People's Hospital,\nHangzhou, China. Cells were grown in RPM\nI1640 medium (InvitrogenTM, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA) supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-\nvated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100IU/ml\npenicillin and 100mg/ml streptomycin. Cells\nwere cultured at 37C in a humidified incuba-\ntor in 5% carbon dioxide/95% air.\nTransfection\nwere purchased from GenePharma\n(Shanghai, China). When CNE2 cells reached\n70% confluence, they were transfected\ntor using Lipofectamine\u00d5 2000 (Invitrogen,\nUSA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Scrambled oligonucleotide\nwas used as negative control for the\ntransfection.\nMiRNA quantification\nAt 48 h after transfection, total RNA was\nextracted from 106 cells using a mirVana\u00d5\nmiRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Carlsbad,\nCA, USA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions, and cDNA was synthesized\nusing a TaqMan\u00d5 MicroRNA Reverse\nTranscription kit (Applied Biosystems,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-\ntime polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u00ad\nPCR) was performed using the TaqMan\u00d5\nUniversal PCR Master Mix. The cycling\nprogramme involved preliminary denatur-\nannealing at 65C for 30 s, and elongation\nat 70C for 60s, followed by a final elong-\nation step at 95C for 5 min. Primer\nsequences were: GAPDH, sense 50-GTCT\nprimer 50-TTTTCAGACTCC-3' and anti-\nsense primer 50-CTCTTGTCCTTCATT\nreference to GAPDH levels.\nCell proliferation\nAt 48 h after transfection, cell proliferation\nwas assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-\nlium bromide) assay, as described.13 Briefly,\n100 ml of transfected CNE2 cell suspension\nwas inoculated to each well of a 96-well plate\nat 3 \u00c2 104 cells/well. On alternate days, MTT\nsolution (20 ml, 5 mg/ml) was added to each\nwell, and the plates were incubated in the\ndark for 4 h at 37C, followed by removal of\nthe culture medium and addition of 100 l\ndimethyl sulphoxide. Absorbance was mea-\nence wavelength. Each group used six\nparallel wells and all experiments were\ncarried out in triplicate.\nIrradiation\nAt 48h after transfection, cells were seeded in\nincubation for 24h, cells were irradiated with\na further 36h before apoptosis was quantified\nusing a Caspase-Glo3/7 assay kit (Promega,\nMadison, WI, USA) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. Luminescence was\nmeasured with a luminometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using\na 1min lag time and 0.5s/well read-time.\nExperiments were performed in triplicate.\nCell invasion assay\nCell invasion was quantified by Matrigel\u00d5\ninvasion assay. At 48 h after transfection,\nCNE2 cells (transfected with either miR-205\nmimic or anti-miR-205 inhibitor) were\nplaced in the upper chamber of a BD\nBiocoat\u00d5 Matrigel\u00d5 Invasion Chamber\n(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) in\nwas added to the lower chamber. Cells were\nincubated for 24 h then noninvading cells\nwere removed with a cotton swab. Invasive\ncells were stained by Diff-Quik\u00d5\n(ThermoFisher Scientific) stain and counted\nvia light microscopy. The percentage of\ninvasion was expressed as the ratio of\ninvading cells over the cell number, normal-\nized on day 2 of the growth curve.\nWestern blotting\nCNE2 cells were lysed with RIPA buffer\n(Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) then boiled for\n5 min. Protein samples were separated by\nsodium dodecyl sulphate\u00adpolyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis and transferred to poly-\nvinylidene difluoride membranes. After\nblocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in\n(pH 7.4; TBST) at room temperature for\n1 h, membranes were incubated overnight at\n4C with rabbit antihuman antibodies to E-\ncadherin, Snail, caspase 9, Bcl-2, Bax, AKT\nand PTEN (all 1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Beverly, MA, USA), washed\nthree times with TBST for 10 min at room\ntemperature, then incubated with horserad-\nish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antirabbit\nSignaling Technology, USA) for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Membranes were washed three\ntimes with TBST for 10 min at room tem-\nperature and immunoreactive signals were\nvisualized using an EasySee\u00d5 Western Blot\nKit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).\nProtein bands were quantified by densitom-\nBioTanon, Shanghai, China).\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD.\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing Student's t-test. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using SPSS\u00d5 version 11.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values < 0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nmimic resulted in significantly higher miR-\nand rate of cell proliferation at 7 days after\ncompared with cells transfected with control\noligonucleotide. In addition, CNE2 cells\ntransfected with miR-205 exhibited\nsignificantly lower levels of apoptosis after\nirradiation than control cells (2Gy irradi-\n1d and 1e, the radiation-induced (2Gy)\nincrease in BAX and caspase-9 protein levels\nwas reversed by miR-205 overexpression. In\naddition, levels of Bcl-2 protein were visibly\nincreased in cells transfected with miR-205\ncompared with control cells.\nMigration and invasion were significantly\nenhanced in CNE2 cells transfected with\nmiR-205 mimic compared with control\ntransfection with anti-miR-205 inhibitor\nsignificantly inhibited migration and inva-\nsion compared with control cells (migration,\nWestern blot analysis of epithelial\u00admes-\nenchymal transition (EMT) proteins is\nshown in Figure 3. E-cadherin levels were\nvisibly decreased and N-cadherin and Snail\nlevels were visibly increased in CNE2 cells\ntransfected with miR-205 mimic, compared\nwith control cells (Figures 3a and 3c)\n(P < 0.05). In contrast, levels of E-cadherin\nwere increased, and N-cadherin and Snail\nwere decreased, in CNE2 cells transfected\nwith anti miR-205 inhibitor, compared with\nWestern blot analysis of the signalling\nproteins AKT and PTEN is shown in Figure\n4.

In addition, mIR-\n205 overexpression resulted in downregula-\ntion of E-cadherin and upregulation of Snail\nproteins.
