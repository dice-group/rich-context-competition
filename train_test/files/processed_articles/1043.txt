According to the 2000 Census, about 1.2 million persons over age 50 are currently cohabiting. Do these\nunmarried cohabiting partnerships provide adults with mental health benefits that are similar to those enjoyed by marrieds?\nWe extended prior work on marital status and depression by including cohabitation in our conceptualization of marital\nstatus.\nMethods. We used data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (N \u00bc 18,598) to examine the relationship between\nmarital status and depressive symptoms among adults over age 50. We also examined gender differences in this\nassociation.\nResults. We found that cohabitors report more depressive symptoms, on average, than do marrieds, net of economic\nresources, social support, and physical health. Additional analyses revealed that only among men do cohabitors report\nsignificantly higher depression scores. Cohabiting and married women as well as cohabiting men experience similar levels\nof depression, and all of these groups report levels that are significantly higher than married men's.\nDiscussion. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for nontraditional living arrangements among\npersons aged 50 and older. Cohabitation appears to be more consequential for men's than women's depressive symptoms.\nFAMILY structures and forms have become increasingly\ndiverse over the last few decades. Americans continue to\ndelay marriage entry, divorce rates remain high, and singlehood\nand unmarried cohabitation are increasingly common. Al-\nthough there has been considerable attention to these patterns\nand their consequences among young and working-age adults\ncomparatively few researchers have investigated the implica-\ntions of such trends among middle-aged and older adults.\nSeveral scholars have noted that a declining share of the older\nadult population will be married in the future (e.g., Allen,\nGierveld, 2004). As baby boomers age into retirement and\nadults experience lengthening life expectancies, it is important\nto examine the consequences of the growing array of living\narrangements for the mental health of middle-aged and older\nadults. We use data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS) to evaluate the significance of marital status and living\narrangements for depression among adults aged 50 and over. In\nparticular, we extend prior research by including unmarried\ncohabitors to determine whether intimate partnerships formed\noutside of marriage offer middle-aged and older adults protec-\ntive effects similar to those of marriage.\nBACKGROUND\nThe rapid growth in cohabitation has altered the family life\ncourse. Americans' attitudes toward cohabitation are increas-\ningly favorable (Thornton & Young-DeMarco, 2001), and this\naffinity is reflected in their behavior. In 1970, there were about\nmillion (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001). The modal path to\nmarriage is cohabitation. Indeed, recent declines in marriage are\noffset by corresponding increases in cohabitation (Bumpass &\nApart from the rapid growth in cohabitation, the age structure\nof the United States is also changing. The number of persons\nCensus Summary File 1). This population is projected to grow\n26% just in the next decade (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001).\nFew studies have investigated nontraditional living arrange-\nments among these adults, yet it is anticipated that this group\nwill spend less time in marriage and more time in other family\nforms such as cohabitation (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Indeed,\nAllen and colleagues (2000) assert that ``young adults are not\nthe sole innovators in pioneering the changes taking place in\nfamily life today'' (p. 913). In this context, it is imperative that\nresearchers examine all living arrangements among middle-\naged and older adults, including cohabitation.\nThe growth in cohabitation coupled with the growth in the\npopulation over age 50 portends significant increases in cohabi-\nCensuses suggest that cohabitation among persons aged 60 and\nindirect measures of cohabitation. The 2000 Census indicates\nthat over 1.2 million persons aged 50 and older are cohabiting.\nHowever, a recent review of intimate relationships in older\nadulthood revealed that there is ``no research base on cohabit-\nIndeed, our review of published studies on cohabitation among\nmiddle-aged and older people revealed only three (Chevan,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nCensuses, respectively. Not only do these studies suffer from\npossible underreporting biases, they are also limited by the\nnarrow range of measures available in the census to predict\ncohabitation experience. De Jong Gierveld's (2004) study ex-\namines sociodemographic determinants of repartnering (i.e.,\nremarriage, cohabitation, or living apart together) among a\nsample of divorced and widowed middle-aged and older adults\nin The Netherlands. The robustness of her findings is compro-\nmised by both the small number of cohabitors in the sample\n(N \u00bc 69) and the narrow range of predictors of repartnering.\nIncorporating cohabitation in studies of marital status and\nwell-being among middle-aged and older adults is important for\nat least two reasons. First, there are significant demographic\nprocesses unfolding that point to an increase in cohabitation\namong this group. This increase is likely to accelerate in the\nfuture as cohabitation has been common among baby boomers\nand cohabitation levels are actually higher among previously\n(versus never) married individuals (Bumpass & Lu, 2000;\nSecond, from a theoretical standpoint, cohabitation likely\nhas a unique meaning and plays a different role in the life course\nThe motivations for cohabitation among middle-aged and older\npersons are likely to differ from those of young adults, and thus\nthe implications of cohabitation for the mental health of middle-\naged and older adults also may be distinct. Unlike their younger\ncounterparts, older adults--especially women--may not be as\ninterested in marriage (Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991; Bulcroft,\nadults over age 60 are as likely to express an interest in cohab-\niting as they are in eventually getting married (Bulcroft &\nBulcroft, 1991). Additionally, the disincentives for marriage are\nlarger among middle-aged and older adults as they are especially\nlikely to have economic resources whose value may be diluted\nor compromised through marriage.\nNumerous studies have shown that marrieds enjoy higher\nlevels of mental and physical health than their unmarried\ncounterparts (e.g., Gove, Hughes, & Style, 1983; Gove, Style,\naccrue to marrieds are not merely an artifact of selection of the\nphysically and mentally healthy into marriage (e.g., Gove et al.,\nGoldsteen, 1991; although for an exception, see Mastekaasa,\n1992). Instead, marrieds' greater economic resources and\naccess to an intimate partner account for much of their\nadvantage in psychological well-being (Hughes & Gove, 1981).\nCohabitors are more depressed than their married counter-\net al., 2003). The higher levels of depression among cohabitors\nversus marrieds reflect the greater instability characterizing\ncohabiting relationships (Brown, 2000). Nonetheless, cohab-\nitors tend to report lower levels of depression and higher levels\nof happiness than singles (Kurdek, 1991). Whether these pat-\nterns are evident among middle-aged and older adults is\nunknown; we are not aware of any study of depressive symp-\ntoms in this population that explicitly examines cohabitors. To\nhelp formulate a framework for understanding the mental health\nof middle-aged and older cohabitors, we draw on the research\nthat addresses the associations between marital status and\ndepressive symptoms in later adulthood.\nResearch on mental health among middle-aged and older\nadults has emphasized the consequences of widowhood, an\nexperience that is especially common among women (Lee,\nWilletts, & Seccombe, 1998; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler,\n1992). Widowed persons are more depressed, on average, than\ntheir married and single counterparts, and these marital status\ndifferences are larger among men than women (Cooney &\nThis gender gap is a function of fewer social ties, more health\nproblems, and a reluctance to ask for help that characterize\nmany widowers. The divorced report levels of depression that\nare similar to those of the widowed, which is not surprising\nwhen we consider the deleterious effects divorce can have on\nthe accumulation of economic resources and the maintenance of\nsocial and familial ties (Cooney & Dunne, 2001; Hyman,\n1983). Notably, never marrieds exhibit fewer depressive\nsymptoms than their divorced and widowed counterparts, al-\nthough their levels of depression are somewhat higher than\nmarrieds'. As most never marrieds do not have children, family\nsupport tends to be weak, but this is offset by extensive\nfriendship networks (Cooney & Dunne, 2001).\nPrior research indicates that marital status differences in\ndepression are due primarily to variation in economic resources,\nsocial support, and physical health (Cooney & Dunne, 2001;\nliterature on how middle-aged and older cohabitors fare across\nthese domains relative to other marital status groups to help us\nformulate hypotheses about how depression among cohabitors\ncompares with that of persons with other marital statuses.\nEconomic Resources\nChevan's (1996) analysis of cohabitation among older\nunmarried adults (aged 60 and over) reveals that the poor and\nnear poor are more likely to be cohabiting than their nonpoor\ncounterparts. The association between men's employment and\ncohabitation is unclear. Whereas Chevan (1996) finds that labor\nforce participation is positively associated with cohabitation\nindicates that cohabiting men are less likely to be working and\nhave smaller incomes than either married or single men.\nAmong women, cohabitors have higher levels of employment\nthan marrieds or singles. Cohabiting women earn more than\nsingle women but less than married women. Other economic\nfactors associated with cohabitation include renting (versus\nowning) a home and receipt of entitlement income (Hatch,\n1995). If cohabitors have fewer economic resources than\nmarrieds, they will likely report more depressive symptoms.\nSocial Support\nSocial support is a key coping resource that helps to buffer\nstressful life events and experiences by promoting social\nintegration. It appears that social support promotes the formation\nof intimate partnerships. Widows with close friends are more\ndesirous of forming a new partnership than those without close\nfriends (Talbott, 1998). And organizational participation among\nolder unmarrieds is positively associated with dating (Bulcroft &\nBulcroft, 1991). Studies comparing the social support experi-\nenced by cohabitors versus marrieds show that cohabitors report\nless support (Stets, 1991). Weaker ties to others may contribute\nto reports of higher levels of depressive symptoms among co-\nhabitors relative to marrieds. We anticipate that cohabitors will\nreport fewer depressive symptoms than their unpartnered (i.e.,\nwidowed, separated/divorced, and never married) counterparts\nprimarily because single persons lack the social support that\nintimate partners provide.\nPhysical Health\nRelative to marriage, cohabitation may be selective of\nindividuals in worse health. Poor health may make one less\nattractive as a potential spouse, relegating less healthy individ-\nuals to a cohabiting union, which requires a weaker commitment\nfrom a partner. Hatch (1995) found that among older men, poor\nhealth is positively associated with cohabitation versus remain-\ning single. This finding is consistent with Talbott's (1998) con-\ntention that women do not wish to take on the burden of\ncaregiving that marriage at older ages often entails for women,\nwho are expected to be family caretakers, particularly when\nmen's traditional familial obligation, namely, economic pro-\nvision, ends in old age. Moreover, poor health can increase stress\nin intimate relationships (Booth & Johnson, 1994) and is also\nassociated with depression. Little is known about the physical\nhealth of cohabitors, but to the extent that it is tied to economic\nstanding and related to attractiveness on the marriage market, we\nanticipate that cohabitors probably report poorer health than\nmarrieds; this difference would partially account for their higher\nlevels of depression.\nOur review of the literature leads us to expect that cohabitors\nwill report more depressive symptoms than marrieds, on aver-\nage. Relative to marrieds, cohabitors have fewer economic re-\nsources, lower levels of social support, and poorer health, all of\nwhich are positively related to depression. Whether cohabitors\nwill report more depressive symptoms than other unmarrieds,\nincluding widows, divorced and separated persons, and never\nmarrieds, is less clear. Perhaps cohabitors will report fewer\ndepressive symptoms than widowed and divorced individuals,\nwho have experienced the trauma of marital dissolution through\ndeath or divorce, respectively. These formerly partnered\nindividuals probably have fewer resources and less social\nsupport, on average, than cohabitors. They may also be in poorer\nhealth. We anticipate that cohabitors' depressive symptoms are\nunlikely to significantly differ from those of never marrieds, who\nare more depressed than marrieds but less depressed than other\nunmarrieds (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). To test these hypotheses,\nwe estimate a series of equations that initially model the\nassociation between marital status and depressive symptoms and\nthen subsequently add respondents' ascribed demographic\ncharacteristics and finally these central factors related to older\nadult depression, including economic resources, social support,\nand physical health, to determine the extent to which we can\naccount for variation in depression.\nWe also expect that cohabitation will be associated with\nhigher levels of depression among women than men. Women\ntend to report more depressive symptoms than men, regardless\nof union status (Gove, Style, & Hughes, 1990; Mirowksy &\nRoss, 1995). Marriage appears to offer greater protective\nbenefits for men as there are larger marital status differences in\ndepression among men than women. Whereas unpartnered\nwomen's mental health is often compromised by economic\nstrain, unpartnered men's mental health is undermined by low\nlevels of social support (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). We investi-\ngate the role of gender in the marital status and depression\nrelationship by evaluating the significance of a marital-status-\nby-gender interaction effect and estimating separate models for\nwomen and men.\nMETHODS\nWe use data from the 1998 HRS. A nationally representative\nsample of the noninstitutionalized, the 1998 HRS comprises\nHRS brings together a sizable continuous cohort of older\nAmericans by combining four samples: the Asset and Health\nDynamics Among the Oldest Old (born 1923 and earlier), the\ndomains of the lives of persons over age 50, including\ninformation on the cognitive, economic, health, work, and\nfamily statuses of respondents and their spouses or partners.\nThe HRS emphasizes health and retirement decision making as\nwell as how adults and their families respond to declining\nhealth in later life. After deleting cases for which marital status\nor depression is missing, the analytic sample size is 18,598.\nMeasures\nDepression. --We use a nine-item depression scale that\nincludes items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--\nDepression Scale (Radloff, 1977). Respondents are asked to\nreport whether ``much of the time during the past week you ...''\n(1) felt depressed, (2) felt everything you did was an effort, (3)\nfelt your sleep was restless, (4) were happy (reverse coded), (5)\nfelt lonely, (6) enjoyed life (reverse coded), (7) felt sad, (8)\ncouldn't get going, and (9) had a lot of energy (reverse coded).\nResponses were coded 1 for yes and 0 for no. Values on the\nscale range from 1 to 10 (we added 1 to each respondent's\noverall score to avoid zero values), with higher values indicat-\ning more depressive symptoms. The Cronbach alpha reliability\ncoefficient for this scale is 0.77.\nMarital status. --HRS respondents report their marital status\nat the time of interview. Approximately 2.4% of the sample is\ncohabiting, yielding 449 cohabitors for analysis. About 64.4%\nof respondents are married, 10.4% are separated or divorced,\n19.7% are widowed, and the remaining 3% are never married.\nCloser inspection of the cohabiting respondents reveals that a\nmajority are separated or divorced (66%) followed by widowed\nEconomic resources. --We include multiple measures of\neconomic resources. Education is coded in years and ranges\nfrom 0 (no formal education) to 17 (post college, i.e., 17\u00fe years\nof education). Household income is a constructed measure in\nthe HRS data set that incorporates bracketed income responses\nusing sophisticated imputation techniques. In the multivariate\nmodels, we use logged household income to correct for the\nskewness of this measure. Employment status is dummy coded\nas follows: employed full-time (reference), employed part-time,\nunemployed, and not working. Retirement status indicates\nwhether the respondent is retired. We do not include this\nmeasure as part of the employment status variable because\nmany respondents are technically retired but also working in a\ndifferent job. We also include a series of variables to tap into\nreceipt of various benefits, all of which are coded 1 for receipt\nand 0 otherwise: Social Security, welfare, veterans' benefits,\nand a pension.\nSocial support. --Social support is gauged by several\nmeasures. Neighborhood friends is coded 1 if the respondent\nreports having good friends living in the neighborhood and\n0 otherwise. Give assistance is a dummy variable coded 1 if the\nrespondent answered affirmatively to this question: ``Including\nhelp with education but not shared housing or shared food or\nany deed to a house, did you (or your spouse/partner) give\nfinancial help totaling $500 or more to any of your children (or\ngrandchildren)'' in the last 2 years? Similarly, receive\nassistance gauges whether the respondent received at least\n$500 in financial assistance from a child or grandchild in the\nlast 2 years. Children live within 10 miles is coded 1 for those\nwho report at least one child resides fewer than 10 miles from\nthe respondent and 0 otherwise. Religiosity taps the signif-\nicance of religion in the respondent's life, ranging from (1) not\ntoo important to (3) very important.\nPhysical health. --We use a global measure to capture the\nrespondent's physical health. Respondents were asked: ``Would\nyou say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or\npoor?'' Values range from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating\npoorer health.\nAscribed characteristics. --We consider the following as-\ncribed characteristics: gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Although\nthey compose only about one-fourth of the elderly population,\nmen account for nearly 60% of cohabitors over age 60 (Chevan,\n1996). Men report fewer depressive symptoms, on average,\nthan do women (e.g., Mirowsky & Ross, 1995). We code\nfemale 1 for women and 0 for men respondents. Among older\nunmarrieds, age is negatively associated with cohabitation\n(Chevan, 1996). Age is also negatively related to depression\n(Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). Age is coded in years. Cohabitation\nis especially common among African Americans and Hispanics\nbecomes more racially and ethnically diverse with the changing\ncomposition of our population and the lengthening life expec-\ntancies of non-Whites, there is no reason not to expect that\nthese groups will continue to be disproportionately likely to\ncohabit. African Americans are more likely to reside in cohabit-\ning unions than Whites, but Hispanics do not differ (Chevan,\ndepression; non-Whites report more depressive symptoms, on\naverage, than do Whites (Mirowsky & Ross, 1989). Race/\nethnicity is dummy coded: non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-\nHispanic other, and non-Hispanic White (reference).\nAnalytic Strategy\nOur first step is to describe the weighted means of the\nvariables used in the analyses, emphasizing variation across\ndifferent marital statuses in depression and other relevant\nfactors. We also examine marital status differences in depres-\nsion by gender. Next, we estimate a series of ordinary least\nsquares multivariate models of the relationship between marital\nstatus and depression. Our first model establishes the bivariate\nassociation between marital status and depression. In the\nsecond model, we introduce ascribed characteristics including\ngender, age, and race/ethnicity. The third model includes the\nexplanatory factors: economic resources, social support, and\nphysical health. The fourth model introduces interaction terms\nfor gender and marital status. We also estimate the first three\nmodels separately for women and men.\nThe complex sampling design of the HRS means that the\nsample is not self-weighting and standard errors need to be\nadjusted to correct for design effects. Consequently, all descrip-\ntive statistics and multivariate analyses that we present have\nbeen weighted. Corrected standard errors were calculated using\nStata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the weighted means of all of the variables\nused in the analysis both for the total sample and separately by\nmarital status. Cohabitors report significantly higher levels of\ndepressive symptoms than marrieds. Cohabitors are less de-\npressed, on average, than either the widowed or the divorced or\nseparated but are indistinguishable from the never married. As\nmost cohabitors are formerly married, it may be that gaining a\nnew partner represents an improvement for those who have\nlost a spouse through divorce or widowhood. However, cohab-\nitation clearly does not convey the same advantage that mar-\nriage does, at least in terms of depressive symptoms.\nCohabitors tend to be slightly younger than persons in other\nmarital statuses. Although females are disproportionately likely\nto be unpartnered, the sex distribution among cohabitors and\nmarrieds is essentially even.\nThere are few marital status differences in education, al-\nthough cohabitors do report significantly higher average educa-\ntion levels than widoweds. About 41% of cohabitors are\nemployed full-time, which is significantly higher than the pro-\nportions employed full-time among marrieds, widoweds, and\nnever marrieds. Only about one-third of cohabitors report that\nthey are retired, compared with over 40% of marrieds.\nCohabitors are less likely to receive pension benefits than\nmarrieds, divorcees, or widoweds. Cohabitors and marrieds\nenjoy higher levels of household income than the unpartnered,\nbut cohabitors' incomes are lower, on average, than marrieds'.\nLevels of social support vary somewhat by marital status such\nthat cohabitors appear to be less likely to report having\nneighborhood friends, on average, than marrieds, widoweds,\nand never marrieds. Cohabitors are less likely to give or receive\nassistance than are either divorced and separateds or never\nmarrieds. The importance of religion is lowest among\ncohabitors. Self-reported physical health ratings are worse for\ncohabitors than marrieds, although cohabitors report better\nhealth than the widowed and never married.\nThere are several gender differences in the marital status and\ndepression relationship. Table 2 shows mean levels of depres-\nsion by union status separately for women and men. Cohabiting\nwomen report significantly more depressive symptoms than\nmarried women but do not significantly differ from unpartnered\nwomen. This pattern suggests that cohabitation does not offer\nthe same protective effects as marriage for women. Similarly,\ncohabiting men report more depressive symptoms than married\nmen. Additionally, cohabiting men report fewer symptoms than\nwidowers. Among both men and women, cohabitors do not\nenjoy depression scores as low as marrieds. These patterns are\ndenoted in Table 2 by asterisks. Bolded coefficients indicate\nsignificant differences between men and women within a marital\nstatus category. Women exhibit more depressive symptoms\nthan men in both cohabiting unions and marriages. Among the\nunpartnered statuses, there are no significant gender differences\nin depression scores.\nModel 1 of Table 3 shows the bivariate association between\nmarital status and depression. Despite the presence of an\nintimate partner, cohabitors report more depressive symptoms\nthan marrieds, on average. Although cohabitors report fewer\ndepressive symptoms than widows, they do not significantly\ndiffer from either divorced or never-married persons. The\naddition of ascribed characteristics, including gender, race/\nethnicity, and age, in Model 2 of Table 3 reduces the associa-\ntion between marital status and depression, but not to non-\nsignificance, as marrieds continue to report fewer depressive\nsymptoms than cohabitors. Women report more depressive\nsymptoms than men. And non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and\nothers report more depressive symptoms than non-Hispanic\nWhites. Age is positively related to depression scores.\nModel 3 of Table 3 introduces economic resources, social\nsupport, and physical health. The inclusion of these measures\nattenuates the association between marital status and de-\npression, but the coefficient for marriage remains statistically\nsignificant. The higher average reports of depressive symptoms\nby cohabitors relative to marrieds are only partially an artifact\nof variation in economic resources, social support, and physical\nTable 2.

As anticipated, education and income are negatively\nassociated with depression. Persons who are not working report\nmore depressive symptoms than those working full-time.\nRetirement is associated with fewer depressive symptoms, as\nis receipt of a pension. And receipt of welfare assistance is\npositively associated with depressive symptoms. The presence\nof neighborhood friends is associated with fewer depressive\nsymptoms. Similarly, the greater the significance of religion in\none's life, the lower the depression score. Poor health is also\npositively associated with depressive symptoms.\nIn Model 4 of Table 3, we examine the significance of the\ninteraction between gender and marital status in the full model.\nThis set of interaction terms does not achieve significance, nor\ndoes it offer an improvement in fit over Model 3.\nStill, the significant gender differences in depression\ndocumented in Table 2 coupled with findings from prior work\nthat indicate some factors are more consequential for women's\n(e.g., economic resource) than men's (e.g., social support) de-\npression suggest that multivariate models should be estimated\nseparately for women and men. We show these models in Table\n4. For women, the first two models (Models 1a and 2a) appear\nvery similar to those reported for the entire sample in Table 3.\nCohabiting women report significantly more depressive\nsymptoms than married women but do not significantly differ\nfrom divorced, widowed, and never-married women (Model\n2a). However, the inclusion of economic resources, social\nsupport, and physical health in Model 3a reduces the effect of\nmarriage to nonsignificance. Supplemental analyses revealed\nthat neither economic resources nor social support alone\nexplains the marriage effect, although in combination these\nTable 3.

Physical health by itself is\nsufficient to explain the marriage effect (p \u00bc .16, result not\nshown), suggesting that married women's lower depression\nscores reflect better health relative to cohabiting women. This is\nlikely to indicate a selection of healthier women into marriage\nand less healthy women into cohabitation.\nAmong men, cohabitors report more depressive symptoms\nthan marrieds but fewer symptoms than widowers. Cohabiting\nmen's depression scores do not significantly differ from those\nof either divorced or never-married men, on average, as shown\nin Model 1b in Table 4. The addition of ascribed characteristics\nin Model 2b does not attenuate these relationships. Similarly,\nthe inclusion of economic resources, social support, and physi-\ncal health in Model 3b does not appreciably alter the coeffi-\ncients for marital status. Thus, whereas cohabiting and married\nwomen report similar levels of depressive symptoms when\ncomparably healthy, among men, cohabitation is associated\nwith reports of more depressive symptoms than is marriage.\nSupplemental analyses (not shown) reveal that the union type\ndifference among men is driven by the especially low depres-\nsion scores enjoyed by married men. Cohabiting women, mar-\nried women, and cohabiting men report similar levels of\ndepressive symptoms, and all of these groups report higher\naverage levels than married men.\nDISCUSSION\nThe marital status and living arrangements of America's\nmiddle-aged and older population are becoming increasingly\ndiverse. Marriage is likely to be less common in the near future\nas baby boomers swell the ranks of the aged. Unmarried\ncohabitors, divorcees, and never marrieds will constitute a larger\nshare of this population. Consequently, it is important to\nexamine the implications of nontraditional family structures\nand living arrangements for middle-aged and older Americans.\nWe used the 1998 HRS, a large, recent data set that is nationally\nrepresentative of adults over age 50, to investigate the depres-\nsive symptoms of people in cohabiting unions relative to those\nwho are married, divorced or separated, widowed, and never\nmarried. Among these middle-aged and older adults, cohabita-\nTable 4.

Cohabitors report fewer\neconomic resources, less social support, and poorer physical\nhealth, on average, than do marrieds. The average levels of\ndepressive symptoms reported by cohabitors do not appreciably\ndiffer from those reported by unpartnereds, including the\nwidowed, divorced or separated, and never married.\nOur study also reveals important gender differences in the\nmarital status and depression relationship such that marital status\nappears to be more consequential for men than women. Once we\naccount for variation in economic resources, social support, and\nparticularly physical health, women residing with a partner--\nwhether married or cohabiting--report similar levels of depres-\nsive symptoms. Indeed, there are no significant differences in\ndepressive symptoms according to marital status among women\nonce these variables are controlled. Among men, on the other\nhand, the presence of an intimate partner is not sufficient to\nreduce depression scores. Instead, whether a man is involved in\na cohabiting or marital relationship is pivotal. Married men enjoy\nsignificantly lower depression scores than cohabiting men, sug-\ngesting that cohabitation does not provide men with the same\nlevel of mental health benefits as marriage.\nWhy does cohabitation appear to operate similar to marriage\namong women yet seems an inferior substitute for marriage\namong men? First, married men are the distinct group, reporting\nsignificantly fewer depressive symptoms than either cohabiting\nmen or cohabiting or married women. Second, it is possible that\nmen and women view relationships differently. Women may be\nless interested in marriage than men because of the probability\nthat they will need to provide care to an infirm husband\n(Talbott, 1998). Men, on the other hand, may anticipate needing\nthe kind of care that wives traditionally provide. Nonetheless,\nwomen probably desire the companionship an intimate partner\nprovides without the commitment entailed by formal marriage\n(Talbott, 1998). Thus, among women, cohabitation may be an\nattractive alternative to marriage that offers similar benefits\nwithout the obligations of traditional, gendered exchange that is\nexpected in marriage. Third, cohabiting men may not receive\nthe same levels of caregiving from their partners as married\nmen do from their spouses. Of course, the observed gender\ndifference in the union type and depression relationship may be\nan artifact of selection. That is, depressive symptoms may\npredict marital status. It is impossible for us to sort out cause\nand effect in this cross-sectional study. Rather, we can report\nonly associations between marital status and depressive symp-\ntoms. Ultimately, longitudinal studies are needed to sort out\nthese competing post hoc explanations.\nIn addition to being unable to account for the possibility of\nselection, this study has another shortcoming: We are not able\nto evaluate the role of relationship quality in cohabitors' and\nmarrieds' depression levels. Other research has demonstrated\nthat the lower levels of psychological well-being reported by\ncohabitors are due largely to their greater perceived relationship\nTo date, the focus of research on middle-aged and older adult\nwell-being has been restricted primarily to the consequences of\nwidowhood. This emphasis has obscured the dramatic shifts in\nfamily living arrangements that have occurred among all age\ngroups. Middle-aged and older adults are increasingly likely to\nbe unmarried, and this trend is expected to intensify in the near\nfuture as a diverse group of Americans experience a wide array\nof living arrangements. Our findings demonstrate the importance\nof accounting for nontraditional living arrangements among\npersons over age 50. Among women, cohabitors and marrieds\nreport similar depression scores once health is taken into\naccount. In contrast, cohabitation is not equivalent to marriage in\nterms of mental health among men. Married men enjoy much\nlower average depression levels than cohabiting men. The next\ntask for future researchers is to determine why men derive fewer\nmental health benefits from cohabitation than marriage.\n"
