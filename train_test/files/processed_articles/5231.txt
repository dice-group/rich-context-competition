The study used a cross-sectional descriptive correlational\ndesign to collect data from 310 purposively random sampled students from three universities in Northern Nigeria. Results\nof data analyses indicated that student teachers from the universities surveyed reported a moderate willingness to engage\nin troubleshooting activities as well as a moderately positive self-appraisal of their problem-solving ability. The student\nteachers' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities was also significantly related to the pattern of their self-appraised\nproblem-solving ability. It was therefore concluded that the findings from this research do not support the pedestrian view\nthat students from Nigerian universities are reluctant to engage in problem-solving activities.\n",

Although it is not generally\nclear the sort of problem-solving ability most of the afore-\nmentioned writers refer to, Oyesiku (2008) at least alludes to\nthe fact that graduates from Nigerian schools lack trouble-\nshooting skills. This is in spite of the importance of such\nproblem-solving competence among the citizenry (Custer,\nOyesiku (2008), the youths in Nigeria are so badly educated\nthat majority of them grossly lack even the most basic do-\nit-yourself technical skills to do minor repairs and maintenance\njobs like changing motor oil, replacing electric bulbs, fixing\nof furniture, and so on. The situation is so pathetic according\nto Oyesiku (2008) that a third party is always called to do the\nmost basic troubleshooting.\nAlthough not every member of society would normally\nfunction as expert at solving technological problems, Dugger\n(2001) summarized the importance of citizens generally\nbecoming technologically savvy when he wrote,\nIt is particularly important in this technological world that\npeople understand and are comfortable with the concepts and\nworkings of modern technology. From a personal standpoint,\npeople benefit both at work and at home by being able to choose\nthe best products for their purposes, to operate the products\nproperly, and to troubleshoot them when something goes wrong.\nFrom a societal standpoint, an informed citizenry improves the\nchances that decisions about the use of technology will be made\nrationally and responsibly. (p. 2)\nTroubleshooting is especially one of the most common\nproblem-solving abilities required of today's citizens for\neveryday functioning. Morris and Rouse (1986) described\nthe task of troubleshooting simply as \"Given a system\nthat is not functioning properly, the trouble-shooter must\nattempt to locate the reason for the malfunction and must\nthen repair or replace the faulty component\" (p. 503).\nProchaska, DiClemente, and Norcross (1992) observed that\nindividuals in their everyday lives engage in personal trou-\nbleshooting to effect self-change, especially when related to\naddictive behaviors. In technical fields, troubleshooting is\nnormally associated with the repair of physical, chemical,\nbiological, electronic, or social systems among others.\n1Benue State University, Makurdi, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nBenedict Iorzer Labe, Office of the Coordinator, Pre-Vocational and\nTechnical Studies, Department of Vocational and Technical Education,\nEmail: blabe@bsum.edu.ng\nStudent Teachers' Self-Appraised\nProblem-Solving Ability and Willingness\nto Engage in Troubleshooting Activities\nBenedict Iorzer Labe1\n Keywords\nwillingness, problem-solving self-appraisal, technological problem solving, teacher training\n2 SAGE Open\nIn the words of Johnson, Flesher, and Chung (1995),\n\"Troubleshooting requires that technicians use their knowl-\nedge and skill to effectively interact with a complex tech-\nnical system that is behaving in some unusual way\" (p. 1).\nJonassen and Hung (2006) noted that people in the techno-\nlogical disciplines (e.g., automotive mechanics, electricians,\nrefrigeration service men) and professionals (physician, ther-\napists, ombudspersons) do troubleshooting every day, diag-\nnosing faulty systems and taking direct, corrective action to\neliminate any faults to return systems to their normal states.\nTeachers of any technical discipline must first be technicians\nin that domain, before they could be effectively disposed to\nteach the subject matter. Fernandes (cited in Boser, 1993) made\nthe point that to teach problem solving (which includes techni-\ncal troubleshooting), teachers must themselves be competent\nproblem solvers who are aware of the methods and processes\nthat they use. Parr (2006) also stressed that engaging person-\nally in activities, similar to those we arrange for our students,\n\"supports the principles that we should never ask our students to\ndo something we are not willing to do ourselves or have not\npreviously engaged in, and that we should know more than we\nteach\" (p. 35). Parr further explained that personally engaging in\nactivities similar to those they would expect of their students\nallows teachers to develop the willingness to participate without\nhesitation, somewhat automatically and freely, because the\nteachers themselves have, in fact, been there before. It is only\nthrough participation and engagement that teachers truly come\nto acknowledge the challenges faced by their students and the\ndemands (instructional and otherwise) that they place on their\nstudents (Parr, 2006). Thus, if the picture painted by Oyesiku\n(2008) and others speaks true of the technology teachers in\nNigerian schools, then there is certainly cause for concern.\nThe most popular reason given for Nigerian school gradu-\nates' poor technological problem-solving ability (and by\nextension, troubleshooting ability as observed by Oyesiku,\n2008) is that, as students, they do not get opportunities to\ndevelop their capabilities while in school. Plagued by lack of\nessential resources like equipment, facilities, materials, and\nUwaifo, 2010), the predominant teaching approach, even in\ntechnical education programs, is the lecture method (Uwaifo,\nthe view that the teachers sometimes teach only theoretical\ncontent because they are themselves not properly trained. This\npresupposes that as the graduates could not accumulate enough\nproblem-solving experiences while in school, they cannot be\nexpected to do well on such tasks out of school. Of course,\npast experiences from which to draw ideas, are key to success-\nful problem solving (scientific, technological or general), the\nmost enduring of such experiences are often acquired tacitly\n\"on the job\" rather than explicitly in formal instructional\nsettings. Given this reality, it is essential we recognize the\nimportance of individuals' willingness to engage in problem\nsolving tasks as deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2006; Ericsson,\nKrampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993) to intentionally cultivate their\nexpertise both inside and outside of classrooms.\nHowever, there is intuitively an obvious link between how\nindividuals perceive themselves as problem solvers and their\nwillingness to engage in problem-solving tasks.Astudent who\nis not sure of his or her problem-solving capabilities would\nobviously also not be comfortable with investing and exerting\neffort in work that could challenge their problem-solving\nskills. In the context of learning, this could adversely affect\nstudents' development of their problem-solving capabilities.\nThere are strong indications that individuals'self-appraisal\nof their problem-solving capabilities could influence their\nwillingness to approach or avoid problem situations. Within\nthe school setting, Charles and Lester (1982) had pointed\nout, \"A willingness to engage in problem solving and self-\nconfidence in one's ability to succeed [are] probably the\nmost important characteristics a student can bring to the\nproblem-solving situation\" (p. 16). In this study, the defini-\ntion of willingness to engage in a problem-solving activity is\nadopted from Adelman, MacDonald, Nelson, Smith, and\nTaylor (1990) who pointed out that willingness is indicated\nby (a) how much the individual wanted to engage in an activ-\nity and (b) how much the individual expected to influence a\ncourse of action. VanDenmark (1991) informed that, all too\noften, many students are simply afraid of their ability to solve\nproblems, or problem-solving activities go wrong simply\nbecause the students got frustrated, apathetic, or embarrassed.\nMcCroskey (1992) linked self-perception of ability to will-\ningness to perform a task (e.g., to communicate). Brophy\n(1999) also observed that if the students do not have the will-\ningness to engage in problem-solving activities, they are\nlikely to show reluctance or even resistance to engage in such\ntasks. When the willingness exists, the individual is primed to\naction (such as actively seeking solution to encountered prob-\nlems), resistance is reduced (Bouckenooghe & Devos, 2008),\nand there could be sustained cognitive, emotional, and behav-\nioral involvement with the problem-solving task.\nThus, to intelligently understand the problem of Nigerian\nstudents and school graduates' reluctance to engage in tech-\nnological problem-solving activities, it is necessary to acquire\ninformation regarding (a) whether or not the students per-\nceived themselves as having the personal resources to deal\nwith technological problems, and (b) whether this perception\ninfluences their willingness to tackle technological problem.\nThe study used individuals'willingness to engage in technical\ntroubleshooting activities as a context for investigation.\nThis study focused on prospective teachers of technology\nwho are still in training because, sometimes, students'lack of\nwillingness to engage in problem-solving activities while in\nschool might be a function of how well their teachers are act-\ning as role models. Research in mathematics education for\ninstance indicates that, teachers' beliefs about subject matter\nhave a powerful impact on the practice of teaching. Akinsola\n(2008) cited several studies where it has been suggested that\nteachers with negative beliefs about a particular domain\ncould influence a learned helplessness response from stu-\ndents. Thus, what goes on in the technological education\nclassroom with respect to technological problem-solving\ndisposition may be directly related to the beliefs teachers\nhold about technology and its processes.\nThe purpose of this research therefore was to\n1. determine the extent of teacher trainees'willingness to\nengage in technological problem-solving activities;\n2. determine teacher trainees' self-appraisal of their\ntechnological problem-solving ability;\n3. determine the relationship between teacher trainees'\nwillingness to engage in technological problem-solv-\ning activities and self-appraisal of their technological\nproblem-solving ability;\n4. determine whether there are significant differences\namong the teacher trainees in their willingness to\nengage in technological problem-solving activities\non the basis of gender, number of years spent in the\nuniversity, and program of study; and\n5. ascertain whether technical area of specialization,\nyear of study, gender, or self-appraised technological\nproblem-solving ability is a significant predictor of\nteacher trainees' willingness to engage in technologi-\ncal problem-solving activity.\nResearch Questions\nThe following research questions guided the study:\nResearch Question 1: What is the extent of teacher\ntrainees' willingness to engage in technological problem-\nsolving activities?\nResearch Question 2: To what extent do teacher trainees\nappraise their technological problem-solving ability?\nHypotheses\nHypothesis 1: There is no relationship between teacher\ntrainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activi-\nties and their self-appraised technological problem-solv-\ning ability.\nHypothesis 2: No significant differences exist among the\nteacher trainees in their willingness to engage in technologi-\ncal problem-solving activities on the basis of gender, num-\nber of years spent in the university, and program of study.\nHypothesis 3: Neither technical area of specialization,\nyear of study, gender, nor self-appraised technological\nproblem-solving ability is a significant predictor of\nteacher trainees' willingness to engage in technological\nproblem-solving activities?\nMethod\nThe study used a cross-sectional descriptive correlational\ndesign. Respondents' self-report of their thoughts was col-\nlected through a structured questionnaire and used to describe\nthe student teachers' self-appraised problem-solving ability,\nwillingness to engage in troubleshooting activities, as well as\nto explore relationships and variations among these variables.\nThe area of the study was Northern Nigeria and covered\nall the universities that provide technical teacher training.\nAccording to figures obtained from the Research and Statistics\nunit of the National Universities Commission (NUC; 2012),\nNorthern Nigeria has 38 universities, four of which offer\nteacher training in industrial technology education.\nSample\nAll the students surveyed in this study were enrolled in either\na 4- or 5-year Industrial Technical/Technology Teacher\nTraining leading to award of a first degree. Purposive ran-\ndom sampling was adopted to survey all the students enrolled\ninto the last 2 to 3 years of study in the Industrial Technology/\nTechnical Education program of the universities. This gave a\nsample size of 310 students. The sample was chosen because\nthey would have undertaken at least one practical technical\nproblem-solving task during the course of their enrollment\ninto the technical teacher training program at the current\ninstitution.\nInstruments for Data Collection\nData for the following variables were collected in this study\nusing the following measures:\n1. The Survey of Willingness to Engage in Trouble-\nshooting Activity (SWETA) was used to assess\nstudents' willingness to engage in technological\nproblem-solving activities. The SWETA is a 24-item\nresearcher-developed survey and was administered\nas part of a 45-item instrument. The SWETA asks the\nparticipants to indicate the extent to which a given\nstatement is true of what they do or think, or how\nthey feel about having to work on the task that\nrequires them to find solution to problems with things\nsuch as lights that would not light, an automobile or\nelectric motor that will not start, doors that stick and\nmake noise, or a computer or some other equipment\nthat would not work at all or not work properly.\nResponses are indexed on a scale of 1 = not at all\ntrue to 6 = completely true.\n2. The Problem-Solving Inventory\u00adTechnological\n(PSI-TECH)\u00adForm B (Heppner, 1988; Wu, Custer,\n& Dyrenfurth, 1996) was used to assess students'\nappraisal of their technological problem-solving\nability. The PSI-TECH is a self-report measure\nthat assesses respondents' perceptions of their tech-\nnological problem-solving confidence, approach/\navoidance styles, and personal control over emotions\nduring a technological problem-solving activity.\nWritten on a fifth-grade reading level, Form B of the\nPSI-TECH is usually completed on a 6-point scale: 1\n= really agree, 2 = mostly agree, 3 = agree, a little,\n4 = disagree, a little, 5 = mostly disagree, 6 = really\ndisagree.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe researcher-developed SWETA was face validated on\nthe bases of clarity and appropriateness for the study by\na professor of industrial education at the Illinois State\nUniversity who has established research interest in techno-\nlogical problem solving. These scales were also face vali-\ndated by a senior lecturer in counseling psychology and\nanother senior lecturer in technical teacher training both at\nthe Benue State University. Following suggestions made by\nthese three reviewers, the researcher made modifications to\nthe questionnaires.\nPrior to analyses for the purpose of describing the re-\nspondents'willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities,\nthe SWETA was subjected to principal component analysis\n(PCA) with varimax orthogonal rotation (Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin\nmeasure = .676, Bartlett's test of sphericity value < .000) as\npart of a 45-item survey. Although the PCA initially produced\nan eight-component solution by eigenvalue, the scree criteria\nsuggested that a two-factor solution was more appropriate fit\nfor the data collected. A two-factor solution was subsequently\nforced, with the level of significance set to .03 to accommo-\ndate the sample size (Tabechnick & Fidell, cited in Casey,\nDay, Howells, & Ward, 2007). The two components accounted\nfor 33.16% of the common variance in scale items. However,\non close scrutiny of the two components, it was realized that\nthey could just be two dimensions of the same construct, will-\ningness. Component 1, which consisted of 17 items, indicated\nthe reluctance to engage in the troubleshooting activity.\nComponent 2, however, consisted of 7 items indicating the\nindividuals' eagerness to engage in the activity.\nThe various scales comprising the measure of the SWETA\nwere tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha.\nAnalysis of the internal consistency statistic was performed\nusing IBM SPSS 21 statistics\u00ae software. This analysis indi-\ncated a Cronbach's  = .742, for the total scale of 24 items. The\n17 items in Component 1 (reluctance to engage in the trouble-\nshooting activity) together indicated Cronbach's  = .795,\nwhile the 7 items comprising Component 2 measuring eager-\nness to engage in the activity indicated Cronbach's  = .772.\nused in this study is a published survey that has been vali-\ndated in a number of studies. For instance, Wu et al. (1996)\ninformed that \"previous conceptual and empirical studies of\npersonal problem solving . . . have validated the three dimen-\nalso documented a range of studies that provide a wealth of\ndata supporting the validity of the PSI. In the present study,\nthe total PSI scores indicated a Cronbach's  = .77.\nAnalysis of Data\nIn line with the purposes of study, descriptive and inferential\ndata analysis procedures were used. Data that provided\nanswers to Research Questions 1 and 2 were analyzed using\nmeans and standard deviations. Data that provided answers to\nHypothesis 1 were analyzed using Pearson's product-moment\ncorrelation coefficients. Data that yielded results for\nHypothesis 2 were analyzed using one-way analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA). Data that provided results for Hypothesis 3\nwere analyzed using simultaneous linear multiple regression\nanalysis.\nWillingness was assessed with 24 items that the respon-\ndents rated on a 6-point scale. For the purpose of analysis\nand reporting, these 24 items were combined into an index\nwith total willingness scores ranging from 24 to 144 with a\nmedian score of 84. This was done by multiplying each point\non the rating scale by the total number of items in the ques-\ntionnaire relating to the construct willingness to engage in\ntroubleshooting activity. Subsequently, the willingness\nscores were divided into three categories using a quartile\nsplit. The lower quartile split at the score of 54, the middle\nquartile split at the score of 84, and the upper quartile split at\nscores that fell within the lower quartile split were placed in\nthe low-willingness category, those scores that fell within the\nmiddle quartile split were placed in the moderate-willingness\ncategory, and those scores that fell within the upper quartile\nsplit were placed in the high-willingness category. In other\nThe PSI total scale, however, ranges from a score of 32 to\nTECH scale scores are usually inversely related to the trait,\nwith high scores representing a reduced presence of a given\ntrait. For example, a high numerical overall PSI-TECH score\nwould indicate low levels of the self-appraised problem-\nsolving ability. In this study, the PSI scores were divided into\nthree categories using a quartile split. The lower quartile split\nat the score of 72, the middle quartile split at the score of 112,\nand the upper quartile split at the score of 152 (i.e., Q\nQ\n= 152). Following the suggestions of Custer\net al. (2001), those scores that were within the lower quartile\nsplit were placed in the high self-appraised technological\nproblem-solving ability category, those scores that fell within\nthe upper quartile split were placed in the low self-appraised\ntechnological problem-solving ability category, and those\nscores that fell in the middle quartile split were placed in the\nmoderate self-appraised technological problem-solving abil-\nity category. The PSI scores were then indexed as follows: 32\nto 72 = high self-appraised technological problem-solving\nability, 73 to 151 = moderate self-appraised technological\nproblem-solving ability, and 152 to 192 = low self-appraised\ntechnological problem-solving ability.\nResults and Discussion\nThe data collected and analyzed are presented in the order of\nthe research questions and the hypotheses.\nResearch Question 1: What is the extent of student teach-\ners' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activity?\nThe results in Table 1 indicate that student teachers in this\nsurvey show a moderate willingness to engage in trouble-\nshooting activities as their mean scores on the willingness\nscale fall within the predefined middle quartile (M = 84.26,\nSD = 12.94). Note that the willingness total scale score\nranges from 24 to 144. The willingness scores are indexed as\nResearch Question 2: To what extent do student teachers\nappraise their technological problem-solving ability?\nData obtained from this study (see Table 1) show that the\nstudent teachers appraised themselves as having moderate\nFurther analysis (see Table 1) indicated that the student\nin themselves as technological problem solvers.

The results from this study indicate\nthat the student teachers showed a moderate tendency toward\nHypothesis 1: There is no significant relationship\nbetween the student teachers' willingness to engage in\ntroubleshooting activity and their self-appraised techno-\nlogical problem-solving ability.\nResults of a Pearson product-moment correlation (see\nTable 2) indicated a statistically significant positive correla-\ntion between the mean score of the student teachers' will-\ningness to engage in problem-solving activities and their\nmean score for the self-appraised problem-solving ability\nrelated to the trait. Thus, a negative correlation indicates a\npositive relationship as higher PSI-TECH scores indicate\nlower levels of the self-appraised problem-solving ability.\nHypothesis 2: No significant differences exist among the\nstudent teachers in their willingness to engage in techno-\nlogical problem-solving activities on the basis of gender,\nnumber of years spent in the university, and program of\nstudy.\nResults of a one-way ANOVA (see Table 3) indicated that\nthere are no significant differences at the p < .05 level among\nthe student teachers, on the basis of gender, in their willing-\nness to engage in troubleshooting activities, F(58, 251) =\nthe p < .05 level among the student teachers from different\ntechnical areas of specialization in their willingness to\np = .083. Also, no significant differences were indicated at\nthe p < .05 level among the student teachers at different\nlevels of study (years of study) in their willingness to engage\nTable 1.

As this study is exploratory and we do not have\nany strong theoretical forecast of the predictive power of any\nof the independent variables over the other, a simultaneous\nlinear multiple regression analysis was done. The regression\nmodel summary is shown in Table 4.\nTable 4 shows that using the simultaneous multiple\nregression method to examine the impact of the predictor\nvariables (technical area of specialization, years of study,\ngender, and problem-solving self-appraised ability) on the\ncriterion variable (student teachers' willingness to engage\nin troubleshooting activities) yielded a significant model,\nof the total variance in the student teachers' willingness to\nengage in troubleshooting activities is accounted for by the\nlinear combination of these variables (technical area of\nspecialization, year of study, gender, and problem-solving\nself-appraised ability).\nThe multiple regression model also tested the contribu-\ntion of each predictor to the model. Table 5 also shows the\nbeta weights and t values to illustrate the contributions of\nthe separate factors to the prediction. The results obtained\nfrom this study indicate that the student teachers' year of\nmade significant contribution to the prediction of the student\nteachers' willingness to engage in technological problem-\nsolving activities. For every unit change in the student\nteachers' year of study, we expect a 4.383 change in their\nwillingness to engage in troubleshooting activity, holding\nthe other predictors constant. For every unit change in the\nstudent teachers' self-appraised problem-solving ability, we\nexpect a 0.234 change in their willingness to engage in trou-\nbleshooting activities, holding the other predictors constant.\nThe contribution of the technical area of specialization\nTable 3.

This\nfinding appears contrary to the claim by Oyesiku (2008) and\nothers that graduates from Nigerian schools are generally not\nwilling to engage in technological problem-solving activities\nsuch as troubleshooting and repairs. One curious observation,\nhowever, that was made by this study is that these same\nteacher trainees who reported a willingness to engage in\ntechnical troubleshooting activities also indicated a slight\ntendency toward avoiding technological problem-solving\nsituations in general as measured by the PSI. This finding\nseems to contradict the respondents' self-appraisal of their\nwillingness to engage in troubleshooting activities as a sub-\nset of technological problem solving. Individuals' problem-\nsolving approach\u00adavoidance style (AAS) seems to be\nparticularly relevant to the construct of willingness to engage\nin problem-solving activities. AAS is defined as a general\ntendency to approach or avoid different problem-solving\nactivities (Heppner & Lee, 2002). Although willingness indi-\ncates how much the individual wanted to engage in an activ-\nity (Adelman et al., 1990), a tendency to approach problems\nis conceptualized to be especially critical in the initiation of\nactive problem solving (Heppner & Krauskopf, 1987). Thus,\nit is curious why the students would indicate a willingness to\nengage in technical troubleshooting, yet at the same time\nreport a tendency toward problem-solving avoidance. A\nprobable explanation is to remember that research and theory\nhave indicated work avoidance as a goal of some students in\nacademic achievement contexts.\nWork avoidance has been defined as the desire to do as\nlittle as possible in achievement situations (Brophy, 1983).\nFrom the findings of this study, it might seem likely that in\nnon-achievement contexts too, some students might adopt\nwork avoidance goals. Students with work avoidance moti-\nvation are said to be motivated to avoid doing their work\n(assigned or unassigned, in-school or out of school) rather\nthan engage in it (Meece & Holt in Guthrie, Coddington, &\nthat students with work avoidance orientation may act as if\nthey are incompetent so that they will have an excuse to dis-\nengage from the tasks.\nIn line with the general belief expressed in certain circles\nthat the teacher trainees being students would express low\nself-ability beliefs that in turn manifested in their apparent\nreluctance to engage in technological problem-solving activ-\nities. However, the evidence from this study does not support\nsuch speculation. The findings regarding self-capability\nbeliefs with respect to engaging in technological problem\nsolving indicate that the teacher trainees generally appraise\nthemselves as effective problem solvers. In addition, their\nappraisal of own problem-solving ability is generally corre-\nlated with self-reports of their willingness to engage in prob-\nlem-solving activities.\nThe finding that the technological problem-solving self-\nappraisal variable, as measured by the PSI-TECH, was a\nsignificant predictor of willingness to engage in problem\nactivities also contrasts with the findings by MacPherson\n(1998) where the technological problem-solving self-\nappraisal variable, as measured by the PSI-TECH, was not\nfound to be a significant predictor of near-transfer technical\ntroubleshooting. The findings however are in line with\nresearch on achievement motivation that established the\nrole of self-efficacy in individuals' activity choices and per-\nPart of the purposes of this study was to investigate\nwhether there were differences among the teacher trainees in\ntheir willingness to engage in technological problem-solving\nactivities. More specifically, the study set out to learn whether\nthe willingness of university-level technology teachers in\ntraining to engage in technological problem-solving activi-\nties differed by characteristics such as technical area of spe-\ncialization, years of university experience, and/or gender.\nResults of a one-way ANOVA indicated that there are no\nsignificant differences at the p < .05 level on the basis of\ngender, years of study, and the teacher trainees' technical\nareas of specialization in their willingness to engage in trou-\nbleshooting activities. However, the results of a simultane-\nous linear regression analysis indicated that gender was the\nTable 5.Coefficientsa of the Predictor Variables.\nModel\nUnstandardized coefficients Standardized coefficients\nt Significance\naDependent variable: willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities.\n8 SAGE Open\nonly non-statistically significant predictor of the teacher\ntrainees' technical area of specialization, and years of study\nwere indicated as statistically significant predictors of the\nteacher trainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting\nactivities. A possible explanation for why the teacher train-\nees' areas of specialization could be used as significant pre-\ndictors of their willingness to engage in troubleshooting\nactivities might perhaps be found within the differences in\nhow the features of the technological problem-solving\ndomain or activity (in this case technical troubleshooting)\nline up with the students' prior knowledge and experience\n(Brophy, 1999). It is possible that the students' prior experi-\nence in the sort of problems they are called on to solve might\nperhaps be inadequate. Or perhaps some of the students'\nprior experience with technological problem solving had\nbeen unrewarding (Brophy, 1999). There is a need for further\nresearch to examine these possibilities as they were not\nexplored in this study.\nThe results of a one-way ANOVA also indicated no sig-\nnificant difference in the teacher trainees' willingness to\nengage in problem-solving activities by year of study (years\nof university experience). Nonetheless, the results of a simul-\ntaneous linear regression analysis indicated that the academic\nyear of study was a statistically significant predictor of the\nteacher trainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting\nactivities. This finding is in line with MacPherson (1998) who\nfound that years of experience were significantly related to\ntechnical troubleshooting performance.\nThe results of a one-way ANOVA also indicated no statis-\ntically significant difference between the male and female\nteacher trainees in their mean score on willingness to engage\nin problem-solving activities. In addition, gender was not\nindicated as a statistically significant predictor of willingness\nto engage in technological problem-solving activities. The\nfinding of this study concurs with those of Mokhtar (2000),\nEffandi and Normah (2009), Hyde, Fennema, Ryan, Frost,\nand Ismail (2011). These findings may perhaps be an indica-\ntion that the gender gap is closing (Goold & Rimmer, 2000;\nRountree, Rountree, & Robins, 2002), perhaps because equal\nattention is given to students, regardless of their gender\nOverall, though the research examined in this article\nfocuses on troubleshooting as a context for technological\nproblem solving, the findings have provided information that\nenriches an understanding of the disposition of students in\nNigerian schools toward engaging in technological problem-\nsolving activities. In addition, the study serves as a valuable\ncontribution to the literature on the assessment of willing-\nness to engage in problem solving, especially given the\nexpectation that problem solving preparedness/willingness\nresearch is likely to continue flourishing.\nFrom the findings from this study, we conclude that there is\na need to critically appraise factors that influence individuals'\nwillingness to engage in problem solving and not rely on the\npedestrian view that students and even school graduates from\nNigerian schools are not ready to engage in problem solving.\nFollowing the finding that the student teachers in the study\nindicated problem-solving avoidance as measured by the\nPSI, the researcher also recommends that whenever\neducators observe reluctance among students, they should\nendeavor to provide support by way of explanation, model-\ning, coaching, and other forms of assistance, and a suitable\nenvironment that helps students develop self-esteem solving\ntechnological problems.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbassah, M.
