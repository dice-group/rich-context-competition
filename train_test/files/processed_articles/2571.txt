Fifty-two\nparticipants (aged 14.9 \u00b1 0.8 years) completed the NZAFFQ twice within a two-week period for test-retest reliability.\nForty-one participants (aged 15.1 \u00b1 0.9 years) completed a four-day estimated food record (4DFR) in addition to the\nFFQs to enable assessment of validity. Spearman's correlations and cross-classification analyses were used to\nexamine relative validity while intra-class correlations were additionally used for test-retest reliability.\nResults: Weekly intakes were estimated for each food item and aggregated into 34 food groups. The median\nSpearman's correlation coefficient (SCC) between FFQ administrations was 0.71. SCCs ranged from 0.46 for fruit juice\nor cordial to 0.87 for non-standard milk. The median intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between FFQ\nadministrations was 0.69. The median SCC between food groups from the FFQ and the 4DFR was 0.40 with the\nhighest SCC seen for standard milk (0.70). The exact agreement between the methods in ranking participants into\nthirds was highest for meat alternatives (78%), but lowest for red or yellow vegetables and potatoes (27%). The mean\npercent of participants misclassified into extreme thirds for food group intake was 12%.\nConclusions: Despite a small sample size, the NZAFFQ exhibited good to excellent short-term test-retest reliability\nand reasonable validity in ranking the majority of the food group intakes among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years.\nThe comparability of the validity to that in the current literature suggests that the NZAFFQ may be used among\nadolescent New Zealanders to identify dietary patterns and rank them according to food group intake.\n",

It is a\nmajor modifiable risk factor in the prevention of obesity\nand development of chronic diseases such as cardiovas-\ncular disease and cancer in adulthood [2,3]. The diet of\nadolescents in Western countries has been frequently\ndescribed as being poor, with low consumption of dairy,\nfruits, vegetables and grains and high consumption of\nsoft drinks and sweets [4-8]. Taken together, these issues\nheighten the need to accurately and reliably assess the\nfood intake of adolescents, so as to allow for assessment\nof dietary patterns and diet quality in relation to future\neducation and intervention. In order to do this appropri-\nate methods for collecting dietary information from ado-\nlescents are needed. In New Zealand, information on the\ndietary intakes of adolescents has been collected in na-\ntional surveys using in-depth measures such as a 24-hour\ndietary recall in combination with a food frequency\n* Correspondence: paula.skidmore@otago.ac.nz\n1Department of Human Nutrition, University of Otago, Dunedin 9054,\nNew Zealand\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Wong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

However, the cost of such methods makes them\nprohibitive for use in all large scale studies. Therefore\nother suitable methods of obtaining dietary information\nfrom New Zealand adolescents are needed.\nConsiderations must be made when selecting appro-\npriate dietary assessment methods for adolescents. Al-\nthough most adolescents possess the literacy skills\nnecessary for reliable self-reporting, accuracy of dietary\nassessment in this age group is affected by factors such\nas motivation to complete assessments and reporting\nbias associated with unstructured eating patterns, con-\ncerns with body image and weight status [10-12]. Besides\nthese adolescent-specific issues, the study design, out-\ncomes of interest and available resources need to be\ntaken into consideration when selecting an appropriate\ndietary assessment tool for a study [13,14].\nFood frequency questionnaires (FFQs), being relatively\neasy to administer and less onerous than other dietary\nassessment methods, appear to be a practical and afford-\nable method for studying diets of adolescents [15]. They\nhave been used successfully in large population studies\nand have been found to be valid and reliable tools for\nranking food intakes of adolescents [16-18]. The major\nlimitation of an FFQ lies in the measurement errors per-\ntaining to an incomplete food list and inaccuracies in\nfrequency and portion size estimation. In particular, the\ncomplex cognitive process of portion size estimation\nmay pose additional challenges to adolescents who con-\nsume varying portion sizes across meals [19] and are less\nlikely to pay attention to portion sizes than adults [10].\nAlthough quantification skills may improve with inten-\nsive training and the use of age-appropriate food photo-\ngraph aids [20,21], inclusion of portion size questions in\nan FFQ may increase respondent burden and lead to\ndata omission, and hence contribute only marginally be-\nyond frequency data in improving validity of an FFQ\n[22,23]. Therefore, recent research in this area has fo-\ncused on the development of non-quantitative FFQs\n(without collection of portion size information) as tar-\ngeted dietary assessment tools to rank individuals by in-\ntake of specific food groups, nutrients or dietary\npatterns rather than providing absolute values for foods\nand/or nutrients [13,24]. Besides providing information\non usual intakes of a particular food or food groups of\ninterest, such FFQs are particularly useful in identifying\ndietary patterns at the population level [25,26].\nIn addition to considering which type of FFQ (quanti-\ntative or non-quantitative) is most useful for a study, it\nis vital that any FFQ must be shown to be reliable and\nvalid for use in the population of interest. An FFQ\nshould also be designed to meet the aims of specific\nstudy populations and contain an up-to-date list of foods\n[27]. Although some FFQs exist for use in adolescents\nitems) and portion size questions, which may not be\nrelevant to the New Zealand context.\nAs there is currently no reliable, valid and up to date\nFFQ for use in New Zealand adolescents the aims of this\nstudy were to: (i) adapt an FFQ to assess food group\nintakes in New Zealand adolescents aged 14 to 18 years\nfor use in future studies; (ii) determine short-term reli-\nability of this FFQ, and (iii) determine the relative valid-\nity of this FFQ compared to an estimated food record.\nMethods\nDevelopment of the New Zealand Adolescent FFQ\nThis study was approved by the University of Otago\nHuman Ethics Committee. A paper-based, three section\nadolescent-specific food questionnaire was developed.\nThe food questionnaire is made up of three sections:\nThe first section contains 12 multiple-choice questions\non general eating habits, including intakes of food group\nservings, meal consumption patterns and frequency of\ntakeaway consumption. These questions were adapted\nfrom previously published questionnaires [29,30]. This\nstudy focusses on the validity of the FFQ (sections 2 and\n3 of the food questionnaire), namely the New Zealand\nAdolescent FFQ (NZAFFQ).\nThe NZAFFQ was produced by combining and modi-\nfying the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children\n(HBSC) FFQ [24] and the Children's Dietary Question-\nnaire (CDQ) [26]. These FFQs were developed to de-\nscribe food patterns, but not nutrient intakes, of\nchildren and adolescents (4 to 16 years), and therefore\ncontain only a limited list of food items. In particular,\nthe HBSC FFQ included 15 items covering the most\ncommonly consumed foods known to be important\nsources of fibre and calcium among European youth.\nThe CDQ included 28 items described as `encouraged\nfoods' (fruits, vegetables, water, reduced fat products)\nand `discouraged foods' (high fat or sugar foods, swee-\ntened beverages and full fat dairy products) for adoles-\ncents in Australia. These two validated questionnaires\nformed the basic construct of the NZAFFQ as they cov-\nered different important aspects (i.e. variety and intake\nfrequency) of an adolescent's diet and have been used to\nSection 2 of the food questionnaire assessed `usual con-\nsumption' of 32 food items, covering 15 items from the\nHBSC FFQ [24] and included extra questions on food\ngroups relevant to the New Zealand adolescent popula-\ntion. Changes to the original HBSC FFQ included the\naddition of questions on consumption of meats and differ-\nent types of soft drinks. As in the original HBSC FFQ, fre-\nquency of intake was estimated by asking \"On average,\nhow many times a week do you usually eat or drink. . .. . .\"\nand participants could select one of the following re-\nsponse categories: `none', `less than once a week', `once\nper week', `2 to 4 days a week', `5 to 6 days a week', `once a\nday', and `more than once a day'. Although a specific\ntime frame for `usual' was not defined, we believed that\nthis was likely to cover the period of the previous four\nweeks, based on results of our pretesting group inter-\nviews. For the last section of the NZAFFQ (Section 3),\nwe assessed intakes of 13 fruits, 22 vegetables and 7\nmiscellaneous foods consumed in the past seven days,\nas in the original CDQ [26]. Modifications to the ori-\nginal format included renaming and regrouping of con-\nceptually similar food items to ensure the suitability of\nthe food items to New Zealand. For example, `sweet po-\ntato' was renamed as the locally known Mori name `ku-\nmara' while `orange' and `mandarin' were grouped together\nas one item. Section 3 assessed `most current intake'\n(in the past week) to reduce the difficulty of recall and\naccommodate seasonality and availability of foods [33].\nFurther revisions were also made to ensure that the\nfood lists in sections 2 and 3 covered the foods fre-\nquently consumed in New Zealand including those indi-\ncated in the 2002 National Children's Nutrition Survey\n[9]. To improve face validity of the NZAFFQ, two regis-\ntered dietitians and a nutritionist were consulted to re-\nview this FFQ before formal pretesting.\nPretesting of the NZAFFQ in group interviews\nThe NZAFFQ was pre-tested in a sample of 29 adoles-\nrecruited from one secondary school in Dunedin, Otago.\nThe day before the pretesting, participants were asked to\ncomplete the FFQs and answer feedback questionnaires\nabout their comprehension of the NZAFFQ questions.\nTwo group interviews (one for males, one for females)\nwere conducted, each moderated by a trained research\nassistant, with additional observers present to identify\nfurther discussion questions based on feedback from the\ngroup. The main focus of the group interview was to ob-\ntain details on the participants' understanding of the\nquestions, the food items listed and examples. The\ngroup discussions were audio recorded and transcribed\nso that the feedback could be used to further refine the\nFFQ. The final NZAFFQ included 74 food items as ei-\nther (i) single foods (e.g. yoghurt), or (ii) lists of similar\nfoods (e.g. chicken, turkey or duck). For analysis, these\nfoods were subsequently aggregated into 34 food groups\nof interest by grouping similar items as had been done\nValidation of the NZAFFQ\nA convenience sample of adolescents aged 14 to 18 years\nwas recruited to participate in the validation study via\nschools, sports clubs and youth groups in Dunedin based\non the following inclusion criteria: aged between 14 and\n18 years, absence of any disease that may influence nu-\ntritional status, ability to keep a food record, and those\nwhose parents did not complete an opt-out consent\nform. All participants also provided written informed\nconsent before participating in the study. Data collection\nwas conducted in two periods from November to early\nNZAFFQ and estimated food record\nEach participant was asked to keep a four-day estimated\nfood record (4DFR) and complete the NZAFFQ twice\nwithin a fortnight. On the first visit day, each participant\nwas asked to self-complete an FFQ in the presence of a\nresearch assistant. After the FFQs were checked for\ncompleteness and missing answers were obtained, parti-\ncipants were given verbal and written instructions on\nhow to complete a structured Food and Drink diary for\nthree weekdays and one weekend day. To facilitate ac-\ncurate recording, the instructions incorporated standar-\ndized examples on the methods of recording and the\nfood record was structured into six daily eating occa-\nsions. On each page, spaces were provided for recording\nof meal times, venue, whom the participants ate with,\ndetails of foods consumed including type, brand and\namount of foods or beverages consumed. In addition,\neach participant was taught to use the portion aid kit\nprovided for recording food quantities. The portion aid\nkit included a metric measuring cup, ruler, diameter cir-\ncle and a coloured food photo booklet, which contained\nphotographs of commonly consumed foods in different\nportion sizes [36]. At the end of the four-day record,\nparticipants answered supplementary questions on the\ntype of sweetened drink, milk, bread and fat spread that\nthey usually consumed. This qualitative information was\ncollected to assist with coding of the food records. All\nfood records received were checked for completeness.\nParticipants were asked to clarify missing and unclear\nentries whenever possible. Within two weeks after the\nfirst completion of the NZAFFQ, all participants were\nasked to repeat the NZAFFQ for a second time to assess\ntest-retest reliability. Based on results of previous re-\nsearch of FFQ repeatability conducted in New Zealand\nchildren [37], this two-week interval was chosen in order\nto minimize the variation in food intake responses due\nto true changes over time.\nData and statistical analysis\nAll data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet\nand checked by a trained nutritionist. Recorded food\nitems in the 4DFR were matched to the items as defined\nby the NZAFFQ. An example of this was `hash browns'\nfrom the 4DFR assigned to `fried potatoes' in the\nNZAFFQ. Food items within a composite meal were\neach allocated a proportion of the meal then assigned to\ntheir relevant food or food groups. For instance, a\nchicken burger was recorded to the three corresponding\nfoods in the NZAFFQ: white bread/bun, poultry and let-\ntuce/salad greens. All frequencies obtained from the\n4DFR were adjusted to provide average weekly intakes.\nFood intakes were described as frequencies of intake\n(days per week) and used as the unit of comparison be-\ntween the NZAFFQ and the 4DFR.\nSpearman's rank correlations were performed to evalu-\nate the validity of the first FFQ administration\n(FFQtime1) relative to the 4DFR for ranking participants\nby frequency of consumption of the 34 food groups. Fol-\nlowing grouping of participants into thirds, cross-\nclassification analyses were undertaken to examine the\nproportion of participants correctly classified into the\nsame thirds or grossly misclassified into extreme thirds\nof intake. For reliability (FFQtime1 vs. FFQtime2), intra-\nclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated in\naddition to Spearman's correlation analyses. Because\nICCs take account of within- and between-subject vari-\nability in responses, it was deemed the most appropriate\ntest to examine the agreement between the repeated\nFFQs in ranking individuals by food group intakes. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using the statistical\nprogram STATA 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,\nUSA). Significance levels for all tests were set at p < 0.05.\nResults\nSample\nOf the 78 participants who volunteered to take part in\nthis study, 38 (49%) participants completed both the\n4DFR and two replications of the NZAFFQ. Fourteen\nparticipants (18%) completed two NZAFFQs only while\nthree participants (4%) completed the 4DFR and the\nFFQtime1. More males than females did not complete\nall parts of this study (p = 0.006) but there were no dif-\nferences in demographic or anthropometric data be-\ntween those who completed all parts of the study and\nthose who did not (data not shown).

This reliability fell within a range\nsimilar to the reliability of the CNS02 FFQ, the only pre-\nvious FFQ designed for New Zealand children [37]. The\nmedian test-retest correlation for the CNS02 FFQ for\nage group (n = 42). As indicated by the ICC, we found\nthat foods that were consumed regularly (e.g. milky or\nchocolate drinks) were recalled with more consistency\nthan foods that were consumed occasionally or variably\n(e.g. red meat, processed meats and poultry), as observed\ntwo-week interval between the administration of the\nNZAFFQs may have led to overestimation of the reliability\nof this FFQ.\nSome variation was seen in the levels of validity be-\ntween food groups. Among 34 food groups, most food\n11 food groups produced correlations below 0.30. In\nparticular, the NZAFFQ was less accurate in estimating\nthe group intakes of some vegetables (cruciferous, green\nleafy, red or yellow vegetables and potatoes), fruits and\nred meat and processed meat. There are several possible\nexplanations for this observed poor validity for these\nfood groups.\nFirstly, within-participant intakes of fruits, vegetables\nand meats were shown to be highly variable [44]. It is\ntherefore possible that some of the food items consumed\noccasionally or episodically were not being consumed\nduring the four-day recording period. This is a known\nlimitation when a reference method that covers only a\nlimited period of time is used to validate an FFQ [45].\nmeat groups were consumed `once a week or less' by\nmore than two-thirds of the participants. These foods\neach had a 54% chance of not being consumed during\nthe recording period. Although extending the number of\nrecording days may potentially improve the correlations,\nthis would have caused reporting fatigue and reduced\nthe quality and completion of the food records [19].\nSecondly, we noted that different recording methods\nand time frame might have attenuated the correlations\nbetween the NZAFFQ and the 4DFR. For the NZAFFQ,\na particular food eaten both alone and in mixed dishes\nwas recorded in a combined frequency. Conversely for\nthe 4DFR, mixed dishes were recorded then segregated\ninto their component foods and apportioned to their\nmatching food groups. Because of this, foods often con-\nsumed as part of mixed dishes such as red or yellow\nvegetables (e.g. tomatoes and capsicum), red meat and\nprocessed meat (e.g. sausage) may either be forgotten\n(thus underestimated in the NZAFFQ) or miscoded in\nthe food records due to insufficient information [7,46].\nIn addition, following recommendations by Cade and\ncolleagues [27], the FFQtime1 was administered before\nthe 4DFR to eliminate learning effects from completion\nof a more onerous dietary method. As the NZAFFQ\nasked about `past seven days' intakes for fruits and vege-\ntables (in Section 3), it assessed diet retrospectively over\na slightly different time span from the reference method.\nThese issues of methodological difference between the\ntwo dietary methods (i.e. coding decisions and reference\nperiod) may have had a negative impact on the correla-\ntions of the food group intakes. It is also important to\nTable 2 Test-retest reliability and relative validity of the New Zealand Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire\n(NZAFFQ): Spearman's correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients, percent correctly classified and\ngrossly misclassified into thirds of food group intake\nTest-retest reliability (n = 52) (FFQtime1 vs. FFQtime2) Relative validity (n = 41) (FFQtime1 vs. 4DFR)\nFood Groups SCC ICC % CC % GM SCC % CC % GM\nAbbreviation: first administration of the New Zealand Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQtime1), second administration of the New Zealand\nAdolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQtime2), four-day estimated food records (4DFR), Spearman's correlation coefficients (SCC), intraclass correlation\ncoefficients (ICC), percent correctly classified (%CC), percent grossly misclassified (%GM).\n1 Brown or wholegrain bread.\n2 Low-fat milk, trim milk, calcium-fortified trim milk, rice milk, soy milk.\n3 Whole-fat milk.\n4 Sweet biscuits, cakes, muffins, doughnuts, fruit pies.\n5 Muesli bars, fruit bars rice bubble bars.\n6 Lollies, chocolate confectionery.\n7 Pies, sausage rolls, pizza.\nacknowledge that using FFQtime1 in validity analyses\ncould potentially result in an underestimation of validity.\nComparison with other studies\nAlthough validation studies of FFQs in adolescents have\nbeen previously reported, most studies validated their\nFFQs in terms of nutrients or absolute food intakes\n[47,48]. Since this study focused on validating the actual\nresponses of intake frequency, precise comparisons of\nthis study with existing studies are not possible. One ex-\nception is a study by Vereecken and Maes [24], which\nvalidated a 15-item HBSC FFQ against a 7-day food\ndiary using a similar approach to this study. These same\n15 food items were included in the present NZAFFQ. A\ndirect comparison of the two studies revealed that the\nNZAFFQ showed similar reliability (mean SCC = 0.71)\ncompared to the original HBSC FFQ validation study\n(mean SCC = 0.67) for the 15 food items. Likewise, the\nvalidity of most food items was comparable to those of\nthe original HBSC FFQ (mean SCC = 0.41), achieving an\naverage SCC of 0.38. Vereecken and Maes found high\ncorrelations for milk (whole and semi-skimmed) and\ncrisps, diet soft drinks, sweets and fruits (SCC = 0.10\u00ad0.34).\nSimilarly, our study showed that validity was good for milk\nfor soft drinks (regular and diet), chips, crisps and sweets\nemerged from the data comparison was the rather low\nvalidity for foods perceived as being `less healthy'. We\nspeculate that these foods may be underreported in the\nNZAFFQ due to social undesirability [49]. This is evident\nfor regular soft drinks where 50% of participants who\nreported usual consumption of `once or less per week' in\nthe NZAFFQ specified intake on two or more days during\ntheir 4-day recording periods.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths and limitations. The main\nlimitation of this study was the small sample size (n =41),\nwhich may have limited the observation of significant cor-\nrelations in food group intakes. Previous authors have sug-\ngested that a sample size of at least 50 is desirable [27], and\nparticularly if the FFQ is designed to provide information\non nutrient intakes [41]. Although the recruitment dead-\nlines were shifted several times, it was difficult to recruit\nmore participants. A high percent (47%) of those recruited\nfailed to complete the study due to the demanding task of\nkeeping a 4DFR, even though estimated rather than\nweighed records were used. Our low compliance rate fell\nwithin the response range of 48% to 60% typically observed\nin previous validation studies of adolescents [19,50,51]. The\nsample in our study may comprise participants who were\nhighly motivated; hence generalizability of these findings to\nother adolescent populations in New Zealand may be lim-\nited. On the other hand, this reinforces the clear need to\ndevelop a simple FFQ to accurately assess diet among ado-\nlescents, including those who are unlikely to provide high\nquality food records.\nIn the absence of an absolute gold standard for dietary\nassessment, we chose an estimated food record as the\nreference method. This method is advantageous in its\nability to capture all food intakes without the reliance of\nmemory and hence has the fewest correlated errors with\nan FFQ [52]. Additional effort was taken to prepare the\nFood and Drink Diary as an easy-to-carry booklet to fa-\ncilitate recording `in situ'. Although participants were\ninstructed to conduct recording `at the time' of food and\nbeverage consumption, we acknowledge that this may\nnot be entirely possible. Food underestimation may still\noccur due to forgetfulness and the limited food know-\npresent NZAFFQ also assesses food intakes in the past,\nthe different time frame between the FFQs and the food\nrecords may have had an effect on the correlations.\nNevertheless, we found similar correlations between this\nstudy and other studies with overlapped time frame\nThe strength of this study lies in the design of a non-\nquantitative FFQ, which is relatively short and practical\nfor use in time-limited surveys where detailed measures\nof food intakes are not feasible. We attempted to address\nthe limited motivation and portion size estimation skills\namong adolescents by omitting the requirement to pro-\nvide food quantities in the NZAFFQ. As a result, this\nFFQ was highly repeatable and could be self-completed\nwithin 15 minutes. The median SCC of 0.40 obtained\nfrom this study was comparable to other validation stud-\nies of quantitative FFQs in adolescent populations\nfrom different food groups, this FFQ may offer a viable\napproach to measure diet diversity and derive dietary\npatterns or diet quality indices in large studies of adoles-\ncents. Whilst the intended use of the NZAFFQ is to as-\nsess food group intakes of adolescents in New Zealand,\nthere is a potential for the frequency data to be used\nalongside other more intensive dietary assessment meth-\nods such as the 24-hour diet recall to estimate usual in-\ntake [55]. As it was adapted from previously validated\nquestionnaires and pretested rigorously, we believe that\nthe food list sufficiently covers the common foods con-\nsumed by New Zealand adolescents and is hence suitable\nto assess food group intakes in this age group.\nConclusions\nDespite a small sample size, the NZAFFQ exhibited\ngood to excellent test-retest reliability and reasonable\nvalidity in ranking intakes for a majority of the food\ngroups. This positive finding raises the possibility that\nthe true ability of the NZAFFQ to rank food intakes in\nadolescents is greater than that shown by our data.\nBased on the present study, we recommend that the\nNZAFFQ is appropriate for ranking participants accord-\ning to food group intake and may be applied in future\nstudies to assess dietary patterns of adolescents aged 14\nConsent\nAll participants provided written informed consent before\nparticipating in the study.
