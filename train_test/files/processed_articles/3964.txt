Parkin, Sociology and Social Policy Subject Group, University of Plymouth, Drakes Circus,\nValue in the Visual: On Public Injecting, Visual Methods and their\nPotential for Informing Policy (and Change)\nStephen Parkina & Ross Coomberb\na,bSociology & Social Policy Subject Group, University of Plymouth\n Key words: Public injecting; applied visual methods; risk environments\nIntroduction\nAccording to Howard Becker, `photography and sociology have approximately the same birth date' (Becker,\n1974: 3) during the mid-nineteenth century. Arguably this same period also `gave birth' to anthropology and\nthe subsequent study of human evolution (biological and social). However, it has been the latter discipline that\nhas been more widely associated with an engagement with visual research methods (such as photography,\ncultural artefacts and ethnographic film-making). Indeed, as Harper (1998) notes, such technologies within\nearly anthropological endeavours were instrumental in classifying `societies' and as supportive evidence of\ntheories concerning racial and cultural inferiority and superiority. Although anthropology has subsequently\nplaced greater emphasis upon phenomenological inquiry and the representation of social, sensory and physical\nexperience (Banks, 1998), its preoccupation with visual culture and visual research has remained constant\nthroughout the discipline's development. Becker (1998) states that photography sits so comfortably within\nanthropology that the collection of visual data becomes almost obligatory during ethnographic fieldwork.\nFurthermore, Banks (2001) has written at length on the development of the sub-discipline of visual\nanthropology and its concomitant growth throughout the academy, at an undergraduate, post graduate and\napplied level of its parent discipline. Indeed, this popularity may be noted in two recent literature reviews that\nchart the transformation of visual anthropology from a marginalised practice towards an established and\naccepted sub-discipline on a global scale within a period of two decades (Ruby, 2005; Davey, 2008).\nThe application of visual methods (VM) within sociology however has had a far less commendable history. In\nfact, visual sociology has been characterised by `a barrage of criticism' (Harper, 2004: 232) typically regarded\nas suitable only for `teaching aids' (Becker, 1998: 87) and regarded as incommensurate with the discipline's\nwider concern for reform and social change (ibid). Similarly, a further objection, summarised by several\nwriters (Banks, 2001; Prosser, 1998), is that photographic material in sociological research may be considered\nas `unscientific' data lacking empirical value. Such criticisms, in their penchant for objectivity, do not seem to\nconsider what VM can achieve in representing understanding and completeness of experience of others' social\ndevelopment of `photojournalism' has many parallels with the origins of sociology in its tendency to highlight\nsocial injustice, inequity and the consequences of poverty and marginalisation as part of `reformist projects to\n... inspire change' (Rose, 2001: 20). Although Becker provides numerous examples of such reformist-\norientated photo-documentary from the early twentieth century, it was not until the 1960's when, according to\nHarper (1998), sociologists began to utilise VM as a means of exposing social problems in order to influence\nsocial change. Such a paradigm shift may have been influenced by the zeitgeist of the period, during which\ntime photographers received Pulitzer Prizes for horrific images taken during the Indo-China conflict. Indeed,\nsuch photojournalist images have been accredited for mobilising anti-war sentiment and strengthening global\nHarper (2006) also claims to have produced the first synthesis of sociology with photojournalism in `the new\ngenre' of visual ethnography to emerge during the 1970s in a study of homeless, itinerant workers that\ntravelled across the United States on freight trains. In this ethnography of `tramp life', Harper resituates the\nconcept of homelessness, problematic alcoholism and provides `alternative cultural logics' (Harper, 2006: 1)\nsurrounding those considered marginalised and disaffiliated. However, Harper also explicates the importance\nof photography in contextualising the structural and economic influences surrounding homelessness and\ntransient lifestyles.\nSubsequently, VM within contemporary sociology have been utilised on an equally ever increasing basis as\nanthropology and are typically employed as an adjunct and innovative means to record representations of\nsocial experiences and social phenomena. However, VM have been largely understated in more policy-\norientated research or that with more practical benefits despite a history of association with public health (e.g.\nin behavioural and other health areas, in which added-value to `traditional' qualitative research may be\nprovided. One such approach is exemplified by Sarah Pink's (2007a) collated accounts of the way in which\nrecent anthropological-orientated studies - with a VM emphasis \u00ad have informed various fields of health\nintervention. Prior to the following account of the way in which VM have been utilised to inform local policy\nconcerning a substance use agenda, it is perhaps necessary to further define different formats of visual data;\nexplicitly between documentary and documentation, and with specific reference to drug and alcohol-related\nresearch.\nVisual Methods: Documentary, Documentation and Substance Use\nHenley (1998) makes a distinction between field-based `documentary' and `documentation' in relation to an\nepistemological understanding of VM within the social sciences. Namely, VM that seek to produce recordings\nabout a given reality should be regarded as documentary. Examples of this may include anthropological (or\nother ethnographic) recordings of unique cultural events, `disappearing cultures' or specific ways of life. In\nsuch film/photography, participants (or `environments') are largely `actors', and typically play a passive (if\nany) role in the collection of visual data. Furthermore, the subsequent visual outcomes are typically used for\ninterpretive and illustrative purposes (e.g. Dovey et al., 2001; Malins et al., 2006; Parkin and Coomber [in\npress]) in attempts to further understandings of wider qualitative research regarding a given issue. However,\nsuch documentary material may also be simultaneously open to mixed, subjective interpretation by audiences\noutwith the research environment. Ranard's (2002) photo-essay of the social suffering of Russian injecting\ndrug users (IDU) perhaps illustrates this latter point. Namely, when viewed in isolation, Renard's images may\nexemplify a `specialised form of pornography ... a voyeuristic interest in the intimate details of other people's\nlives ... and the fetishistic cathexis of the Other' (Henley, 1998: 52), if it were not for the accompanying text\nthat serves to politicise the repression of drug users, as well provide documentary evidence of influential HIV-\nrisks within the macro-environment. Furthermore, Renard's visual account of injecting issues has received\ncommendation within academic circles (Fitzgerald, 2002) for advancing harm reduction per se and has proven\npractical value as an HIV training aid amongst epidemiologists and medical professionals by Medecins Sans\nDocumentation however, according to Henley (1998), involves a more positivist approach towards data\ncollection in which the film-maker aims to produce objective visual accounts, or visualised transcriptions, of a\ngiven reality, situation and/or cultural event/setting. Henley furthers this distinction in adding that\ndocumentation may be regarded as `fly-on-the-wall' recordings involving `minimal interference' (Henley,\n1998: 46) by those making the film. Accordingly, documentation requires a more collaborative approach with\nresearch participants in which the latter assume a more active role and are directly involved in the production\nof the recorded event. Several notable examples of this genre have emerged within the last decade from the\nfield of injecting drug use. Taylor et al. (2004) and Rhodes et al. (2006) for example have each recorded films\nthat address blood-borne viral infection (hepatitis, HIV) via injecting drug use. Within each respective setting,\ndrug users were filmed preparing and injecting drugs in their own home (Taylor et al., 2004) and in street-\nbased settings (Rhodes et al., 2006) as a means of identifying the social production of viral infection due to\nthe way in which drugs were prepared and/or ingested. In these studies, attempts have been made to visually\ntranscribe drug using realities involving a participatory research process in a manner to similar to `fly-on-the-\nwall' documentary. Such accounts of injecting drug use have contributed towards an increased sociological\nand epidemiological understanding of the social settings that house particular risk environments. Of further\nimport is the value the findings from these studies provided to policy and practice regarding the distribution of\ninjecting equipment and associated implications from both harm reduction and public health perspectives.\nSimilarly, Bourgois and Schonberg's (2009) collection of visual images represent over a decade of\ncollaborative photo-ethnography with a group of homeless injectors in an attempt to politicise the cultural\nrelativism of social suffering of marginalised and dispossessed populations. However, the authors\nacknowledge an awareness of the potential for misinterpretation of their drug-focused images in stating,\n`applying cultural relativism as a heuristic device to document the lives of drug users is often misconstrued as\ncelebrating drug use' (Bourgois and Schonberg, 2009: 7).\nOther research has included documentation of behaviour as part of experimental interventionist agendas and\nlocated within specific `treatment' centres. Mihai et al. (2006) for example found that alcohol-dependent\nindividuals that retrospectively viewed recordings of their own delirium tremens were less likely to suffer\nrelapse than those that did not see such videos. Mihai et al. argue that the use of video in such a manner\nprovided some therapeutic value in the treatment of dependency due to the collaborative and informative\napplication of the method. Similar observational work has been conducted by Treloar et al. (2008) in a study\nof the injecting practices of service-users attending a safer injecting facility as part of a novel approach to\nhepatitis C (HCV) prevention. In recording participants' injecting practice and subsequently viewing this in a\nresearch setting, Treloar et al. (and their participants) were able to identify a number of unsafe practices\nthroughout the injection process that had important implications for the transmission of HCV. As such, VM\nwere interpreted as a way of reinvigorating HCV prevention efforts amongst IDU. Both of these studies have\npolicy-orientated implications when considered in the treatment of dependency/health issues and accordingly\nmay be interpreted as providing opportunities for developing innovative intervention via innovative method.\nIn summary, the distinction between these VM genres is one that relates to the method used in acquiring\nvisual data. That is, whereas both documentary and documentation provide data of academic, illustrative and\ninformative value, the latter has greater potential to further inform analysis as well as the agendas of non-\nacademic, interventionist audiences. Such benefits are directly attributable to collaborative methods employed\nwith active research participants (Bourgois and Schonberg, 2009). Indeed, it is perhaps this collaborative and\nparticipatory design that provides potential for application within a wider range of disciplines and/or\nbehavioural contexts and especially those with a specific health agenda (e.g. nutrition and diet) but perhaps\nalso for most areas concerned with behavioural outcomes.\nA Cautionary Note on Interpretation\nIn 1962 the artist Stan Lee coined the phrase `with great power there must also come great responsibility'\n(Lee, 1962) and although describing one of his animated creations, it may also be applied to methodological\ninnovation within the social sciences. This could not be more appropriate in the field of VM, and even more\nso when used in conjunction with an ethnographic inquiry of sensitive issues such as homelessness and/or\ninjecting drug use. Previous researchers (Bourgois and Schonberg, 2009; Fitzgerald, 2002; Rhodes and\nFitzgerald, 2006) in such fields have stressed that photography and ethnography are both methods that have\npotential to consolidate existing power structures and may legitimise the continued marginalisation and/or\nrepression of populations considered `other'. This is due to the capacity of ethnographers to become\ninadvertent `conduits of power' (Bourgois and Schonberg, 2009: 11) in providing an academic bridge between\nsocial structures and socially and economically disadvantaged populations. Likewise, Rhodes and Fitzgerald\n(2006) warn that images of particular groups (e.g. IDU) may reproduce negative stereotypes that also\ncontribute towards their ongoing discrimination. This echoes Fitzgerald's (2002) argument that drug\nphotography has a tendency to be `eroticised and exoticised' and provides images of `dark, seedy, secret\nworlds ... (that) can have the effect of Othering the subject' (Fizgerald, 2002: 374). One example of this\nparticular sensationalist genre may be Clark's (1971) photo-essay of amphetamine injectors that portrays a\nworld of sex, violence and hedonism in small town America. Visual images therefore have the potential to\ncreate (and further) social distance between the powerful and powerless (Rose, 2001) as well as distort the\nreality of social and physical suffering, and accordingly `letting a picture speak its thousand words can result\nSuch discrepancies regarding the `meaning' of visual images have been discussed at length by Rose (2001)\nwho argues that disputes typically relate to differences in opinion regarding one of three `sites' of\ninterpretation. These sites concern the production of image; the image itself and how this may be viewed (or\n`audienced') by different spectators. Accordingly, Rose defines the site of production as the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of visual representations (including technology, pose and/or naturalistic settings) and\nthe degree to which these have been manipulated or shaped by the image taker. Secondly, images influence\nways of seeing and contribute towards the contextualising of social practice and behaviour which may again\nbe influenced by the photographer's own personal reasons for taking particular pictures. Finally, Rose\ndescribes the process of image renegotiation and rejection by different audiences (including gender and those\nfrom different historical periods). The point being expressed here is that images are as open to interpretation\nas they are manipulation and that they do not necessarily provide conclusive truths; and reflect experience and\nvarying degrees of power and ambiguity (Becker, 1974).\nDue to the power inherent with VM (latent or otherwise) it is therefore necessary to emphasise the need for all\nvisual researchers to employ considered and rigorous ethical protocols within such data collection strategies.\nIn addition to those advocated by the British Sociological Association (Visual Sociology Group)ii, other\nethical procedures employed in the current setting included notifying the relevant authorities that such street-\nbased research was taking place (and obtaining a `comfort letter' from a relevant body in the event of any\nchallenge to taking photographs of particular settings); meticulous informed consent procedures with\nrespondents and maintaining the anonymity and confidentiality of all participants throughout fieldwork.\nIndeed, of almost 400 photographs and over 1 hour of video footage, only one image of a drug-user\nparticipant was takeniii, as all lenses were principally focused upon the environmental settings of injecting\ndrug use.\nVisual Methods: Public Injecting in the city of Plymouth (UK)\nAs an illustration of the employment of VM in the field of public health, reference is now made to research\nthat incorporated such methods throughout fieldwork in a study of injecting drug use in public settings (such\nas toilets, car parks and other amenities). This was located in the city of Plymouth (in the county of Devon in\nthe South West of England) and concerned the way in which different environments used for injecting drug\nuse affect health risk due to the manner in which they are situated (environmentally, socially and/or spatially).\nFieldwork predominantly rested upon `traditional' qualitative data collection methods (semi-structured\ninterviews and ethnographic observation) but was complemented by VM (photography and video) in a variety\nof street-based settings. The collection of visual data took place in two distinct stages of fieldwork.\nPhotography was used prior to any interviews with drug users in order to document known public injecting\nsites. This was followed by semi-structured interviews with 31 current public injectors; of which 7 were\ninvited to participate in a street-based video-ethnography of outdoor settings they had previously visited for\ninjecting purposes. Each aspect of these visual procedures is discussed separately below.\nThe Academic Rationale for Applying Visual Methods in the Field of Public Injecting\nThe application of VM sought to determine the social organisation of injecting environments, from both an\nindividual and collective perspective, and in so doing, aimed to identify associative health-harms within such\nplaces. Primarily, VM aimed to provide representations of public injecting and to `visualise' verbal accounts\nof respondents' experiences obtained during semi-structured interviews (that took place prior to any video\nrecording of public injecting sites). VM also aimed to represent the lived-experience of public injecting,\nincluding the range of emotional, sensory and situational factors that are embedded within street-based drug\nuse. In short, the overall rationale for applying VM was to develop an alternative way of understanding the\npublic injecting phenomenon through the application of non-conventional research strategies (Pink, 2004).\nFrom a sociological perspective however, it was envisaged that such an alternative approach would contribute\ntowards a wider understanding of the inter-relationship between local structures within the macro-\nenvironment (relating to policy, practice and enforcement); those of individual agency (IDU) and specific\nmicro injecting environments located throughout Plymouth. In applying various VM in this field it was\nanticipated that a more complete understanding of the social and political constraints that contribute towards\nmanner more nuanced than from more `interview focused' research methods. This aim is perhaps made more\npertinent by Fitzgerald's (2009) suggestion, (in a discussion of drug dealing risk environments), that place is\nshaped by experience and is modified by the relationship between individual agency and structural forces.\nTherefore, this unconventional qualitative research within drugs research aimed to uncover the social, political\nand cultural contexts (Keller et al., 2008) of public injecting drug use and identify a range of harms associated\nwith this behaviour (located within both the macro and micro environment).\nThe Non-Academic Rationale for applying Visual Methods in the Field of Public Injecting\nThe use of VM also aimed to develop an exploratory synthesis of academic and applied visual sociology, in a\nmanner similar to that emerging in other disciplines (Pink, 2007a). It was envisaged that the inclusion of such\na method would inform the academy whilst simultaneously providing practicable data for multi-agency\nintervention at a local (and potentially, national) level. As such, this approach was designed to contribute\ntowards the development of an `applied visual sociology' in making a bridge between epistemology and\nintervention.\nTo build this bridge, it was necessary to become involved in a process of `cultural brokerage' (Chalfen and\nRich, 2007; Pink, 2007a), involving the collation of views of one group (e.g. IDU) and re-presenting these to a\ndistinctly different group (e.g. Drug and Alcohol Action Teams [DAAT]iv), in which the research serves to\ninform and direct specific social intervention. Pink (2007a) emphasises that it is this `applied' nature of visual\nresearch that differentiates it from a more `academic' orientation, in which the former contributes to social\nchange as a result of participatory, collaborative research with participants from a given field. In this instance,\n7/31 respondents (all with recent experience of injecting drug use in a public setting) participated as such\n`collaborators' in drug-related research within a variety of street-based settings.\nDocumentary Data of Public Injecting: Photography and Field Procedures\nThe initial stages of fieldwork involved a rapid appraisal of public injecting throughout Plymouth's city centre\nin order to determine the nature, level and locations of this activity prior to any interviews with local IDU.\nThis was a necessary `mapping' exercise, as formal documentation of public injecting was unavailable and\nexisting knowledge was limited or based upon assumption and hearsay. One aspect of this rapid appraisal\nrepresentatives from various agencies who were familiar with street-based injecting as a consequence of their\nparticular employment. During these sessions, photographs were taken of known injecting sites including\nevidence of drug-related litter (DRL). Images of the latter were taken as confirmation that sites were used for\ninjecting purposes and could be used as clarification of rumour and/or hearsay. A further rationale for taking\nsuch pictures was for the researcher to become familiar with injecting environments, in which a visual\ndatabase provided opportunities to `revisit' such locations whenever necessary and provided descriptive data\nthat may have been overlooked when completing fieldnotes after each successive walk and talk tour.\nHowever, the main reason for taking such images was to provide guidance in designing a semi-structured\ninterview schedule to be used in future meetings with the respondent IDU sample. Indeed, this latter aspect of\ndata collection was greatly influenced, (although in an inverted format), by Suchar's (1997) `shooting scripts'\nmodel.\nSuchar (1997) developed a framework for conducting visual research in a study of the effects of gentrification\nupon an urban area of Chicago. This procedure involved the compilation of questions that needed to be\nanswered using photographs (for example, `what stores/businesses are located in particular environments?').\nSuchar terms these questions as `shooting scripts' as they provide guides for both photographic and\nsociological inquiry, and give structure and direction to the relevant fieldwork. In the present setting however,\nthese guidelines were inverted and photographs were taken in order to inform the questions to be asked of the\nfuture sample. In compiling over 150 pictures of injecting environments prior to any such interview, the\nresearcher was able to identify numerous themes of commonality and difference within and across injecting\nsites (such as cleanliness, dirt, marginality, seclusion and contact with others). Such themes therefore\ninformed the topics included in the interview schedule in which there was a direct correlation between\nquestion and image (although at no point during procedures did interview respondents view the images taken).\nIn short, whereas Suchar advocates that 'shooting scripts involve the creation of a series of categories of\nphotographic evidence to be collected and questions to be explored' (Suchar, 1997: 36), in the present setting\nthis became `scripts shot' (i.e. photographs) that generated a series of questions to be organised and asked at a\nfuture date. Accordingly, the application of photography may be considered as an inductive research process\nin which observations (photographs) of injecting sites were used to formulate modes of inquiry regarding the\nuse and effect of place upon injecting drug use. Photography, in the present setting, should therefore not be\nconsidered as a positivist, deductive device that sought to confirm (or otherwise) particular theories relating to\npublic injecting. In this regard, the more interpretive framework of inductive research methods greatly assisted\nthe overall design (and direction) of the wider qualitative study in which the `added value' of VM became\napparent as the study progressed.\nThe Added-Value of Photography as Research Method\nAs a consequence of attending and photographing public injecting sites prior to any interview with IDU, the\nresearcher became familiar with over 40 known injecting sites and had acquired an awareness of the\nenvironmental circumstances contained within such locations via the aforementioned walk and talk tours\n(albeit from the perspective of agency employees and representatives). Such grounding in local issues also\nprovided a geographic understanding of injecting locations later discussed in drug-user interviews and\nprovided a knowledge base upon which the veracity of participant responses could be assessed.\nIn addition to the above, twov further significant outcomes were to emerge from the photographic database of\ninjecting sites. These aspects of added-value are discussed below as Typology of Descending Safety and\nForensic Resource.\nTypology of Descending Safety\nAt the conclusion of the rapid appraisal described above, a database containing over 150 images of public\ninjecting sites was established. Due to the nature and content of these photographs, it was possible to `code'\nthese data in a manner similar to that concerning textual data (e.g. using qualitative software packages such as\nNvivo). This was due to the wide range of environments visited and the diversity within their respective\nphysical and social milieux. In analysing all images as a complete set, it was possible to identify a series of\nconstants that emerged from the visual data relating to socio-environmental diversity and commonality.\nConsequently, the photoset was coded into categorical nodes such as `Place', `Sanitation and Hygiene',\n`Danger', `DRL', `Barriers' and `Presence of Others'.\nFollowing this categorical classification, further nodal analysis produced findings relating to each individual\ntheme. For example, analysis of the `Place' category produced important findings that related to the various\nphysical environments in which drugs are prepared and injected. In short, these settings were coded into one\nof three categories; namely, `controlled', `semi-controlled' and `uncontrolled' environments; in which\n`control' refers to the level of safety and hygiene from a harm reduction perspective (rather than any\nFoucauldian notions of power and dominance). From such an interventionist-viewpoint, those environments\nconsidered `uncontrolled' were the least safe and posed significant risks of drug-related harm as a direct\nconsequence of the immediate environment. To illustrate, a disabled toilet in a shopping centre is considered a\n`controlled' injecting environment (due to adequate space, lighting, sanitation and hygienic surfaces) in\ncontrast to `uncontrolled' settings such as doorways and rooftops in isolated street-based locations (that\nprovide none of the aforementioned `safety' features). Indeed, it was possible to establish a typology of\ndescending safety in which injecting sites could be placed within a league table that pertained specifically to\nrisk environments (see Appendix 1.). This is perhaps significant as such findings have important harm\nreduction implications that will be of value to services concerned with minimising hazard in such settings.\nForensic Resource\nA second aspect of added-value emerged from a re-analysis of visual data following the completion of all\ninterviews with the respondent sample. For example, throughout interviewing the issue of discarded needles\nand syringes often provoked emotional outbursts from respondents regarding the littering practices of other\ndrug users (ODU). Overall, there was recognition that reckless discarding posed health and safety risks to\nODU, children and members of the public in community settings. Due to this awareness there was unanimity\nthroughout the sample that they did not engage in practice that was considered anti-social and abhorrent.\nAlthough caution should be noted here regarding a potential `interviewer effect' (in which respondents\nattempt to portray themselves in a positive light by `under reporting' any involvement in\nsensitive/controversial issues), many of the sample provided details of their own individual discarding\nstrategies. When disposal did not involve the use of personal `sin bins'vi, discarding at public injecting sites\ninvolved snapping off needles and leaving syringes in situ, placing used equipment into cans, drains, toilets or\nby plunging needles into soil/soft earth. Respondents were cognisant that such strategies were not ideal and\nconceded that it was not entirely appropriate. However, those concerned were equally adamant that such\npractice minimised the risk of needlestick injury in various settings and stressed the reduced potential for viral\ninfection from such discarding strategies.\nPost-interview analysis of photographs taken during the rapid appraisal exercise appeared to illustrate many of\nthese claims relating to `inappropriate' discarding strategies, as numerous images were found to contain\nlimited evidence of this practice. One such image is presented below (Figure 1.) and clearly shows 5 syringes\ndiscarded in an outdoor injecting site that was used on a daily basis by IDU (at a site of which many of the\ninterview sample had direct experience). This particular site was used almost exclusively by drug users and\nwas not a location frequented or attended by members of the general public. However, what is perhaps most\nstriking about this image is the almost regimental manner in which the 5 items have been placed onto and into\nthe earth. From this image one could assume at least 5 injecting episodes have taken place at this particular\nspot, and each episode would almost certainly have not involved the same individual due to the frequency\nwith which the site was used. As such, it is feasible to infer that multiple persons had injected at this spot and\nthe equipment had been carefully positioned (rather than thrown aside in a random, haphazard manner) in an\nattempt to maintain some degree of `safety' within this public injecting setting.\nFurther inspection of this image reveals other significant and relevant features of outdoor injecting; features\nthat further illustrate and reflect the interview responses summarised above. Of the insulin syringes pictured,\nthose numbered 1-4 have had the fixed needle removed from the syringe barrel, whereas Syringe 5 is partially\nsubmerged into the soil. This image (and others like it) would appear to provide a forensic resource of\ninjecting behaviour previously described by respondents, in which attempts to `make safe' used, discarded\nequipment may be visualised.\nFigure 1.: Evidence of `informal' (street-based) harm reduction practice?\nThe implications of this suggestion may not be immediately apparent, but has important connotations that\npertain to the discussion above regarding the interpretation of images. Indeed, one should consider how this\nimage, without the above analysis, may likely be viewed by, for example, journalists, police officers, nurses,\nor refuse collectors. One may anticipate that each of these individuals would provide their own subjective\nanalysis that would typically concur with a negative portrayal of IDU. Indeed, it is likely that such images\nwould justify demands for sanctions and reprisals against those responsible for public injecting. Accordingly,\nsuch subjectivity would perhaps overlook the attempts made by drug users to employ `informal' (street-based)\nharm reduction practice that seeks to minimise the assumed health-risks associated with used, discarded\nneedles; practice that extends to those that may seek to marginalise and discriminate. Indeed, some may argue\nthat the multi-layered meaning of images perhaps demonstrates the unreliability of VM as a credible research\ntool. However, as Henley (1996) suggests, such varied interpretations of an image actually serves to enrich\nethnographic description. Furthermore, he suggests that such visual data indicate a `quality of thick\ninscription' (Henley, 1996: 12, original emphasis). Accordingly, VM provide data that can be a source of `re-\nanalysis and re-interpretation' (ibid) that can contribute to the resituating of initial interpretation. Indeed, this\nbecame evident in the present setting; in which Figure 1. was initially viewed as merely a collection of\nrandomly discarded syringes. The subsequent reanalysis, following drug user interviews, provided far richer\n(and perhaps more provocative) interpretations of the images concerned.\nDocumentation of Public Injecting: Video and Field Procedures\nThe collation of video data however, involved a more systematic approach than that described above\nconcerning photography. Street-based visual research took place with a micro-sample of respondents obtained\nfrom the wider sample (n = 7/31) in which recruitment was based upon each respondent's overall public\ninjecting experience (including frequency, range of sites used, drug-related harms experienced).\nDuring each individual video session, each participant was asked to select up to six sites they had used for\npublic injecting. As each site was visited, participants were asked to explain how, why and when these sites\nwere accessed; recreate the processes of drug preparationvii and to describe the measures used to manage\npersonal safety and risk avoidance. These responses were audio-recorded in situ (without the presence of\nothers) in order to avoid conducting interviews `on camera'. Subsequently, all injecting environments were\nvisually recorded from the actual position in which participants had previously prepared and injected drugs.\nFrom these viewpoints, the immediate environments were recorded (where possible) in a 360 degree angle in\norder to fully capture the immediate physical surroundings used for public injecting. In this manner an attempt\nwas made to instantiate respondents' `skilled vision' (Grasseni, 2004) regarding the environmental qualities\nconsidered `appropriate' for injecting drug use. This contributed to the representation of public injecting sites\nas such skilled vision provided advice and direction on appropriate camera positions for recording the sites\nvisited. In this way, the researcher also gained a sensory and spatial appreciation of behaviour associated with\npublic injecting; information that had not necessarily been articulated during the semi-structured interview\nprocess.\nThe Added-Value of Video as Research Method\nThe inclusion of video recordings as a research method was a means of concretising views previously\nobtained from participants' semi-structured interviews. In adopting the above procedures the aim was to\nobtain visual documentation of public injecting sites, based upon participatory and collaborative procedures\nwith IDU. Namely, whereas the research interview had typically focused on generic experiences of public\ninjecting, those recorded in the field focused on specific environments and events based on the experience and\nknowledge of the relevant sample. Whereas photography provided data that related to thick inscription, video\nrecordings of injecting sites provided opportunities to gather thick description data that illustrates and\ncommunicates the lived experience of public injecting (including structural constraints, as well as the social\nand physical barriers that attempt to minimise such activity); providing data not to be explained by the\nresearcher, but data that provided opportunities for IDU to articulate explanations and accounts of an\n`everyday activity' (in the context of their own lives). In this respect, VM were applied as a heuristic device\nfor reflecting and interpreting the mundane (yet needful) practices surrounding public injecting.\nIt was further envisaged that `observant participation' (Crossley, 2007) of public injecting sites would provide\nopportunities to acquire more credible representations of such environments. In collating all audio-visual data\n(from the generic to the specific) it was anticipated that an analytical depth of injecting sites would emerge.\nFurthermore, the ethnographic element of producing such visual recordings would provide an insight of the\nlived-experience of accessing injecting environments including contact with and/or problems associated with\nsecurity, the general public and other environmental obstacles to injecting drug use. In this regard, the\ncollection of visual data aimed to `collapse spatio-temporal' (Lovejoy and Steele, 2007: 296) boundaries and\nthus provide opportunities to `revisit' injecting sites as and when required (i.e. bringing the `field' to the\n`office'). Finally, it was also anticipated that such data would contribute towards the development of a visual\nnarrative of injecting environments (in the form of a DVD production) for possible service development by\nlocal drug services.\nExamples of Actual Added-Value\nDuring VM fieldwork with 7 IDU, a total of 42 public injecting sites were visited, (36 of which were different\nsettings), and each recorded from a variety of drug user perspectives. Post-fieldwork data analysis involved a\nsynthesis of visual data, ethnographic interview and fieldnotes that each provided insights of the processes\nemployed by drug users in their appropriation of public environments for drug using purposes. Each of the\nexpected value-added outcomes described above were obtained, and examples of thick description data that\nemerged are presented below.\nAccessing Sites\nThe process of gathering video-related data of public injecting sites involved accessing/exiting the places\nchosen by respondents in a manner that emulated their attendance of going there to use drugs. Furthermore,\nwith the exception of public toilets, many of these locations were well concealed within the urban\nenvironment; located in hidden stairwells, small enclosed spaces and recessed doorways as well as within\nareas of city greenery (bushes and shrubs). Consequently, the nature of accessing/exiting many of these spaces\ninvolved moving at speed in a manner that would evade detection by the police, wider public and/or any\nrelevant security staff (including surveillance cameras). The need for such urgent secrecy was primarily to\navoid challenges for having no obvious, legitimate, purpose in specific places (for example, on land owned by\nthe Ministry of Defence). A second explanation related to a need to maintain the `privacy' afforded by hidden\nlocations so that they remained unknown and unseen to those using such places `legitimately' (e.g. within a\nstairwell of a business complex).\nThis aspect of public injecting cannot be understated due to the implications it carries for those attending in\nsitu. Indeed, many respondents spoke of the need for haste and urgency whilst accessing/exiting public places\nand explained that this spatial exigency extended to their actual injecting behaviour. For example:\nThat's what I call a `rush-spot'; if you use in there you gotta be really really quick in case you\nget.... If there is an attendant in there they'll get to recognise ya face and if you're going in 2-3\ntimes a day sort of every day, they will get a bit suspicious and call the police in.\n(Video Participant [VP]002, Male, Aged 29; original emphasis)\nRushing\nThe rushed technique described above may also extend to injectors `slamming' the syringe plunger during\ninjection; that in turn provides a more rapid delivery of the drug to the bloodstream. The sudden rush of\nopiates (such as heroin) into the bloodstream may produce physical effects similar to those of overdose\n(including confusion and fainting) due to an abrupt depletion of oxygen to the brain. This phenomenon is\nknown as `cerebral hypoxia' and is a common effect of injecting heroin use (Dursteler-MacFarland et al.,\n2000) that may be mistaken as overdose amongst drug users. This can be illustrated with the following\nrespondent's account of such an experience that was recounted outside the public lavatory in which it had\noccurred:\n... one of my mates conked out once, an' me an' my other mate had one leg an' one arm each side\nof him. An' we had to carry him out the toilet up to here, (up two flights of stairs to street level),\nan' all the way up to the top of town (approximately 500 metres) on the grass an' leave him there,\nwhere he was out of view of everyone till he came round a bit. That was the worst. ... but me an'\nmy mate having to carry someone through town an' that! S'fucking pretty embarrassing innit?\nOverdose\nHowever, for others, actual overdose (as opposed to cerebral hypoxia described above) was a feature of the\nlived-experience of injecting sites they had chosen to frequent. In fact, the reality of overdose was not only a\nunanimous concern within the visual sample of 7 respondents, but also amongst the wider sample of 31. For\nexample, 32% (n = 10) of the wider sample had ever overdosed in an outdoor location and 77% (n = 24) had\nwitnessed a friend or associate overdose in either indoor or outdoor locations. During visual data collection,\nseveral respondents made remarks similar to the following in connection with their own outdoor injecting\nexperience:\nI overdosed up here once. I was with some other people and I was lucky I was with them cos they\nhad a mobile phone on them and called the ambulance. I remember waking up with all these\nyellow jackets around me and they said I was lucky to be alive really.\nFurthermore, those involved in all aspects of the research appeared cognisant of the dilemma presented by the\nneed to access places of privacy and seclusion in an attempt to conceal their preparation and injection of\ndrugs, whilst simultaneously recognising such isolated places may present hazardous consequences to their\nhealth/life in the event of overdose. This is evident in the following video-respondent's account of an isolated\ninjecting site on the outskirts of the city centre:\nBecause coming here, you're out of people's way. But then, if you go over, nobody knows you're\nhere do they? So you've got that risk ain't ya, and the seclusion an that.\nInjecting Environments\nA further feature noted within numerous injecting sites was the accumulation of dirt, debris and drug-related\nlitter. Accessing such sites on occasion was an overwhelming sensory experience involving pungent,\noverpowering smells coupled with a lack of adequate lighting within enclosed environments in which the\nslightest sound echoed all around. Such environmental conditions are also of significance as they provide the\nsanitary conditions in which drugs are prepared for injection. That said, there appeared to be respondent-wide\nacceptance of such conditions, in which the cleanliness of the immediate injecting environment was a concern\nbut not a priority. The following fieldnote illustrates this paradox of need:\nThroughout the ascent to the top floor of the car park, the stairwells stunk of urine. Respondent\nexplained that this didn't matter if you were ill and desperate for a hit as you knew it wouldn't be\nlong before feeling well again! (The actual injecting site) was covered in pigeon excrement and\nthere was various drug-related litter scattered around. (The site) was incredibly unpleasant to see\nand smell. (Respondent) explained that this was a place other people brought him to and was not\nnecessarily one he would choose to visit alone. On these occasions he would come because his\nassociates had the drugs. To question their choice of place may have negated access to his share\nof whatever was available, and to refuse to accompany on the basis of `preferred place' may deny\naccess to the drug on offer. As such, injecting partners may expose one another to place-based\nrisk as a result of compliance to this particular mediation.\nSimilarly, all video-respondents reported varying degrees of contact with (used and unused) discarded\ninjecting equipment at all sites recorded during fieldwork. Nevertheless, the issue of drug-related litter in\npublic injecting sites was an emotive issue within the sample, and those involved tended to speak pejoratively\nof injectors that were involved in such littering behaviour. Not only was this considered to be unacceptable\npractice but was also viewed as a way in which injecting sites were identified to the relevant authorities in\nwhich they were located. Similarly, concerns were expressed regarding the potential for needlestick injury in\nsuch sites and the potential for blood-borne virus transmission. For example:\nIt's probably half a dozen (injectors) that come up here regularly and just discard it. ... That's\ngotta be a health hazard innit? Y'know, Hep? Hepatitis an' all that? It only takes to get stabbed by\na needle an' you're fucked aint ya?\nSimilarly, VM provided opportunities for respondents to explain the minutiae surrounding drug-related litter\n(based upon their skilled vision, experience and construal appreciation of environments visited). This may be\nillustrated in the following Field Journal extract:\nInside the toilet cubicle was a coke can that had been used as a cooker and there was an opened\nneedle pack on the floor. (Field Assistant) believed somebody was going to go back and inject\nagain as most of the equipment was still inside the pack. Respondent countered this and explained\nthat such mass discarding was typical, as users will not necessarily keep the whole 10-pack of\nneedle and syringes; instead, using only one set of works for a single hit (and discard the\nremainder).\nThe Value of Visual Methods in Drug-Related Research\nThe application of VM in the present study greatly enriched the wider research process. Employing such a\nstrategy involved ethnographic participation in accessing/attending/exiting sites used for public injecting and\nin so-doing provided the researcher with an insight of the lived-experience of such activity. Indeed, the\ncollection of visual data became a process that emulated the traditional procedures surrounding participant\nobservation. This was due to spending periods of extended engagement (3 hours per session) with each\nparticipant in various locations throughout the city of Plymouth. In this respect, VM were almost incidental to\nthe process of participants relaying and articulating movement and motion, experience and knowledge,\nthroughout the various injecting niches spread across the city centre. Similarly, in conducting participatory\nfieldwork with a sample of current public injectors, the research was greatly informed by the skilled vision of\nthose with recent experience of such settings. Such conclusions alone achieved the primary purpose in\napplying VM in the field; as they served to concretise semi-structured interviews and consolidated these\nresponses with a wealth of thick description data obtained from ethnographic inquiry.\nFurthermore, visual data contributed towards more nuanced insights pertaining to injecting behaviour, its\nsocio-spatial context, the social meaning drug users attach to such places and how each of these were made\nmeaningful to the researcher. For example, analysis of visual data provided a typology of public injecting sites\nthat was premised upon safety and hygiene (with important harm reduction implications). Similarly, the pre-\nand post-interview analysis of photographs established these as an informative, forensic resource that directed\nquestions to be asked and illustrated answers given at a later stage of the study.\nIn addition, the visual data obtained throughout the study may be used to validate the wider-findings that\nsuggest public injecting sites are isolated and peripheral places that are temporarily appropriated as a means to\naddress injecting needs, in which subsequent injecting practice may be rushed or involve inappropriate\nadministration procedures. Although public injecting sites provide temporary shelter to conceal drug use, they\nsimultaneously conceal incidents of drug-related harm (such as overdose). Similarly, public injecting sites\nmay be characterised by unsanitary conditions that may impact upon injecting hygiene and/or the preparation\nof drugs. Drug users appeared cognisant of these place-based hazards and vocalised both an acceptance of and\na preparedness to take injecting-related risks in such settings. Indeed, the amplification of risk appears to\nemerge as an effect of place on health-risk and such tentative conclusions expect to be confirmed in the\ncontinued ongoing analyses of the various (visual and textual) datasets obtained during fieldwork.\nFrom a more methodological perspective however, the VM that complemented more conventional qualitative\ntechniques (interviews, observations) throughout this research serve to further validate wider understandings\nof public injecting in the present setting. This is made possible by the process of triangulation, described by\nQuine and Taylor (1998) that seeks completeness (not confirmation) of such understanding. Such\ncompleteness is made possible by interrogating different facets of a given phenomenon in order to obtain a\nmore holistic (and complete) interpretation through the variety of accounts and experiences concerned (in this\ncase, the interrogation of photography, interview and video data, with agency representatives and IDU; each\nconcerning the issue of public injecting). Such triangulation strategies are frequent within qualitative research\n(Quine and Taylor, 1998) and should not be confused with triangulation via convergence; involving seeking\nconfirmation of understanding via mixed and multi- methods (quantitative and qualitative) research (ibid).\nPerceived Benefits of Visual Methods in Public Health Research\nThe visual data outlined throughout this paper have, to date, provided both immediate and long-term benefits.\nFor example, they have influenced decisions by harm reduction practitioners (in the local setting) to introduce\na pilot service within community pharmacies concerning the distribution of single sets of injecting equipment.\nIt is anticipated that this service will complement the existing distribution of needle/syringe multi-packs in an\nattempt to minimise the discarding of excess equipment in street-based locations. Other visual data\n(photographs) have provided documentary material within a number of local, influential reports made\navailable to the relevant Drug and Alcohol Action Team (the body responsible for commissioning and co-\nordinating local drug and alcohol services). Finally, a more long-term benefit (and currently ongoing) will be\nthe production of a pedagogic DVD for distribution amongst local drug services that provides documentation\nof the effects of place on health risk in the context of public injecting. Added-value will be inherent in the\npermanency of these data (in which particular settings can be viewed with relative ease and as frequently as\nrequired without having to actually access the field) and possibly provide service-relevant detail/application\nfor practitioners that may have been overlooked by the research team. Furthermore, this project will aim to\nvisualise particular risk environments that may have particular value for those with little/no work experience\nof accessing such locations and provide a nuanced insight into the clandestine settings that influence known\ndrug-related hazards.\nIn conclusion, the added-value of VM within qualitative research (concerning injecting drug use) has provided\na number of benefits. These include those of an academic orientation but also extend to the development of\nlocal harm-reduction drug services and applied intervention. In short, VM appear to have met the potential\ndescribed below that emphasises the value of such data:\nVisual data are powerful ways of hitting home a research finding and raising new questions for\nresearch as well as potentially creating the evidence required to bring about a policy change.\n"
