For complete neuropsychiatric\ndiagnosis, as per International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the results were combined with\nclinical history and additional information from the patients' family.\n31 (77.5%) had a depressive disorder: 14 had dysthymia, 11 had recurrent depressive disorder and\n6 had bipolar disorder. Of the nine patients without a firm diagnosis of mood disorder, seven had\nisolated symptoms of depression or anxiety and two presented with mixed depression/anxiety\nsymptoms. Only 8/31 (25.8%) patients were receiving antidepressant treatment. There was no\nassociation between BDI scores and seizure frequency. No significant difference was found\nbetween patients with and without depression and the presence or laterality of HA.\nConclusions: Depressive disorders are common, underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients\nwith refractory MTLE.\n",

Indeed, depression\nhas been associated with MTLE, especially\nin patients with left hippocampal atrophy\n(HA).27 Cognitive impairments, such as\nmemory and learning losses are marked in\npatients with left MTLE7 and there is a\nsuggestion that these difficulties may be\nassociated with depression.28\nHippocampal volume abnormalities have\nalso been observed in patients with depres-\nsion and MTLE29,30, with reduced volumes\neither ipsilateral or bilateral to the origin of\nthe seizures. Several studies have shown\nthat in epilepsy, untreated depressive symp-\ntoms may potentially hinder seizure\ndiagnosis and treatment of depression is\nessential in these patients.36 Intrinsic\nbiological and extrinsic psychological\nfactors have been suggested as the cause of\nthe association between MTLE and depres-\nsion.22 In addition, reports suggest that the\nrelationship between epilepsy and psychi-\npropose that hippocampal sclerosis, bitem-\nporal lesions and pharmaco-resistance may\nbe relevant risk factors. For example, the\npharmacological treatment of depression\nand other psychiatric disorders in patients\nwith MTLE may be challenging in patients\nusing multiple AEDs, particularly drugs\nwith enzyme inducing effects which may\naffect the incidence of side effects and/or\nefficacy of concomitant antidepressants.40\u00ad42\nThe objective of this present study was to\nassess depressive disorders in patients with\nMTLE refractory to medical treatment.\nMethods\nPatients\nIn this case series study, patients were\nrecruited from the outpatient Epilepsy\nClinic at University of Campinas, Sao\nwith MTLE who had not responded to two\nor more trials of AEDs in mono or poly-\ntherapy17 and continued with seizures for\nmore than two years (i.e., seizure frequency\nof at least once every two months) prior to\nevaluation were eligible for this study. The\ndiagnosis, clinical symptoms, electroenceph-\nalogram (EEG) reports and video-EEG\nwere reviewed from patient medical records\nby two epileptologists (F.C. and C.L.Y.).\nThe diagnosis of MTLE was made accord-\ning to the International League against\nEpilepsy (ILAE) criteria11,12 and further\nconfirmed by MRI scans.15\nAll patients had ictal semiology\ndescribed by a close relative or documented\nby a medical staff during clinic visits or\nGonc\nvideo-EEG monitoring.43 In addition, all\npatients had other clinical and EEG features\nconsistent with the diagnosis of\nsuggesting extratemporal focal epilepsy.\nThe following inclusion criteria were met:\n(i) clinical manifestations indicative of\nMTLE, including stereotyped focal seizures\nwith de\n\u00b4 ja\n` vu or epigastric sensation,\nassociated or not with fear and other auto-\nnomic symptoms (i.e., auras), followed by\nimpaired awareness seizure, some with\nmotor symptoms (i.e., previously known as\ncomplex partial seizure now defined as\ndyscognitive or focal seizure with impaired\nawareness)44 consisting of staring and lip\nsmacking or masticatory automatisms or\nboth, accompanied or not by hand automa-\ntisms and contralateral arm dystonia; (ii)\nEEGs during wakefulness showed no clear\ncut epileptiform abnormalities outside the\ntemporal lobe electrodes; (iii) epileptiform\nEEG abnormalities over temporal regions\non interictal EEGs; (iv) no seizures, or use of\nantihistamine or alcohol for at least 12 hours\nprior to the psychiatric evaluation.\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1)\npresence of dementia, low intellectual level,\nor language problems; (2) dual pathology; (3)\nmetal objects in the body preventing MRI\nscans; (4) continuous use of alcohol or illicit\ndrugs; (5) serious history of diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, liver disease or kidney diseases;\n(6) other psychiatric disorders than those of\nclass F.30-39 of International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD)-10.\nAll subjects provided signed informed\nconsent and this study was approved by\nthe Ethics committee at the University of\nCampinas \u00ad UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao\nPaulo, Brazil.\nAssessments\nThe Mini International Neuropsychiatric\nDepression Inventory (BDI)47\u00ad50 were used\nas screening tools for depression.

According to the Brazilian\nPortuguese validated version,50 from a\nused to indicate mild depression, above 20\nmoderate depression and above 36 severe\ndepression.\nIn addition to the questionnaires\npsychiatric evaluations were performed by\na board-certified psychiatrist (E.B.G.) using\na semi-structured interview51 for appropri-\nate clinical and depressive disorder diagnosis\nand to exclude other psychiatric disorders\nneuropsychiatric diagnosis, results from the\nsemi-structured psychiatric interview and\nthe two questionnaires were combined with\nclinical history and additional information\nfrom the patients' families.\nAll patients had a 3T MRI scan to assess\nthe presence of HA and other signs of\nhippocampal sclerosis as part of the clinical\nroutine investigation. The definition of HA\nwas made by visual analysis by a researcher\nand her advisor (E.B.G. and F.C.) MRI\nsigns of hippocampal sclerosis were defined\nas the presence of HA, with or without\nsignal change (i.e., white matter hyperinten-\nsities in T2 and fluid attenuated inversion\nrecovery [FLAIR]) and changes in hippo-\ncampal shape and internal structure.12,17\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software (version 22.0 for Windows\u00d5;\n(IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp,\nUSA).

There was no difference\nbetween patients with and without depres-\nsion in the frequency of epilepsy or psychi-\natric history of family members.\nDiscussion\nAccurate estimates of psychiatric comorbid-\nities are difficult,55 as most are based on\nstudies with considerable heterogeneity of\nthe variables and factors. A strength of this\ncurrent study was the use of relevant instru-\nments, especially the semi-structured psychi-\natric interview, which produced a reliable\ndiagnosis of the psychiatric comorbidity.\nBased on our results and in accordance\nwith other studies4, the clinical presentation\nof depressive disorders in epilepsy was simi-\nlar to that of patients without epilepsy.\nInterictal depression in epileptics is the\nmost common type of recognized mood\ndisorder and usually presents as a chronic\ndepression that more often than not tends to\nmimic a dysthymic disorder with endogen-\nous features and an intermittent course.4 We\nused reliable methods to categorize the\npatients into the ICD-10 equivalent of\nthese disorders.\nThis current study showed a high fre-\nquency (77.5%) of depressive disorders in\npatients with pharmaco-resistant MTLE.\nThese findings are similar to several stu-\nresults may be related to the severity of the\ncurrent study group; patients had severe\nepilepsy and were candidates for epilepsy\nsurgery. Despite its relatively high preva-\nlence, depression in patients with epilepsy\nremains poorly recognized and without\nadequate treatment.4 In this study, most\npatients with major depressive disorder\n(74.2%) had no previous diagnosis of the\ncondition and only 25.8% had been treated\nwith antidepressants.\nIn a preliminary study from our centre\ninvolving 25 patients, we found that the\nduration of epilepsy was significantly higher\nin patients with a depressive disorder com-\npared with those without depression.57 In\nthis current study, the sample size was\nincreased to 40 patients but a correlation\nbetween duration of epilepsy and depression\nwas not observed probably because most\npatients had a mood disorder (i.e., 77.5%)\nwhich skewed the sample population. In\naddition, we found that there was no asso-\nciation between BDI and seizure frequency.\nHowever, the relationship between depres-\nsive disorders and severity of epilepsy is\nconsidered controversial by several\nEvidence suggests a bi-directional rela-\ntionship between depression and\nMTLE has shown increased gray matter\natrophy in patients with depression com-\npared with those without depression.30 This\nevidence suggests that common biological\nfactors may be related to both depression\nand MTLE. Dysthymia was identified as the\nmost common depressive disorder in\nlowed by recurrent depressive disorder (11/\nwith those of others who suggested that\ndysthymia is the most common comorbidity\nin patients with MTLE,4 In addition, we\nbipolar disorder. A previous study found\nepilepsy had bipolar disorder according to\nDSM-IV critieira,59 and another study using\nthe MINI-Plus version detected 9.6% of 73\nMTLE patients had bipolar disorder (80.8%\nhad refractory epilepsy).60 It is speculated\nthat refractory MTLE could be involved\nwith neuropathogenic mechanisms related\nto depression25 and there could possibly be a\nsimilar association between MTLE and\naffective disorders.37\nFurther studies should be conducted to\nunderstand the comorbidity of depression\nwith refractory MTLE because it is import-\nant to identify and provide adequate treat-\nment to prevent adverse consequences such\nas suicide ideation and/or suicide attempts.\nImportantly, suicide is two to five times\nhigher in patients with epilepsy than in the\neven higher among patients with MTLE\n(i.e., the risk is 25 times higher), rising in the\npresence of a comorbid depressive disorder\nattempts (10%) was observed in this study\nwhich is in accordance with previous find-\nan important impact on patient's quality of\nlife and early diagnosis and adequate treat-\nment of depression may prevent brain dys-\nfunction and assist in epilepsy improvement.\nSimilar to other studies,62,63 a high fre-\nquency of epilepsy was found in the relatives\nof patients (47.5%). The rates of familial\nalcoholism and psychiatric disorders were\na previous study that involved 82 patients\nwith pharmacoresistant MTLE and 62 with\ntreatment-responsive MTLE, the presence\nof family psychiatric history was more fre-\nquent in pharmaco-resistant patients.64 In\nthis present study no differences was found\nbetween patients with and without depres-\nsion in the frequency of epilepsy or in\npsychiatric family history. However, all\npatients had refractory MTLE and the\nnumber of patients without depression was\nsmall. Indeed, a major limitation of this\nstudy was the small sample size. However,\nthe overall results support the importance of\npsychiatric evaluation in MTLE patients\nwith symptoms suggestive of mood dis-\norders, particularly in individuals with phar-\nmaco-resistance.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe study was funded by Fundac\n\u00b8 a\n~ o de Amparo a\n`\nPesquisa do Estado de Sa\n~ o Paulo, grant number\nReferences\n1.
