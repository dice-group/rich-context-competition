Laparoscopic surgery,\nwhich is minimally invasive, has been\nwidely used in clinical practice. The propo-\nfol Ce at ROC after laparoscopic surgery\nor during total intravenous anaesthesia\nremains unknown. Therefore, the present\nprospective clinical study was performed to\nanalyse the factors influencing the propofol\nCe at ROC with target-controlled infusion\n(TCI) of propofol\u00adremifentanil after laparo-\nscopic surgery.\nMaterials and methods\nSelection of patients and study\npreparation\nThe present study included 112 patients with\nan American Society of Anesthesiologists\nphysical status of 1 to 3 and age of 20 to\n80 years who underwent laparoscopic colon\nsurgery or nephrectomy under general anaes-\nthesia. The study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of our hospital, and written con-\nsent was obtained from all patients.\nThe exclusion criteria were a body mass\nother neurological deficits, history of mental\ndisorders and renal or hepatic disease, recent\nadministration of opioids or sedatives, drug\naddiction, and intraoperative blood loss\nBefore surgery, the patients were fasted\nfor 8 h and given no premedication. Routine\nmonitoring was applied after they entered\nthe operating room. The arterial blood\npressure was continuously monitored by\ninserting a 20-gauge plastic cannula into\nthe radial artery, and drugs and fluid were\nintravenously administered by inserting an\n18-gauge catheter into an upper limb vein.\nAfter 10 min of stabilization, the baseline\nblood pressure and heart rate were detected.\nThe forehead skin was then sterilized with\n75% ethanol, and the bispectral index (BIS)\n(XP Version; Aspect Medical Systems,\nNatick, MA, USA). Prior to drug adminis-\ntration, 5 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's solution\nwas intravenously administered at an infu-\nsion rate of 7 ml/kg per min.\nPropofol was given through TCI by a\nmotor-driven syringe pump (Graseby 3500;\nSmiths Medical International, Watford,\nUK) with a TCI system (Diprifusor;\nAstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) containing\nthe modified Marsh's pharmacokinetic\nmodel. This system can predict the Ce of\npropofol.5,6 The model for remifentanil was\nproposed by Minto et al.7,8\nThe depths of sedation and anaesthesia\nwere assessed using a modified Observer's\nAssessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S)\nscale (Table 1)9 once every 15 s. When the\nOAA/S score reached 1, remifentanil (Ce:\nTable 1.

Two min-\nutes after intravenous injection of rocuro-\nnium, tracheal intubation was initiated,\nafter which ventilation was mechanically\ncontrolled with 100% oxygen to keep the\nend-tidal carbon dioxide tension at 35 to\n45 mmHg. The BIS was maintained at 45 to\n55 throughout surgery by adjusting the\npropofol Ce. The infusion of propofol and\nremifentanil was stopped at the end of\nsurgery. ROC was defined when an OAA/S\nscore of 3 was reached.\nDetection of variables\nThe Ce, mean arterial pressure, and heart\nrate were recorded at eight time points: at\nbaseline before induction (T0), at achieve-\nment of an OAA/S score of 1 [loss of\nconsciousness (LOC)], immediately before\nintubation (T2), immediately after intubation\n(T3), 3 min after intubation (T4), 2 min after\nestablishment of pneumoperitoneum (T5),\nbefore termination of infusion (T6), and at\nROC. The BIS was recorded 5 s after each\ntime point. All variables were detected by the\nsame anaesthesiologist to minimize bias.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analysed using SPSS version\n11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The\nnormality of all continuous data was tested\nwith the Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov method.\nThe correlations between clinical variables\nand ROC were evaluated using linear cor-\nrelation analysis. Comparisons among three\ngroups were conducted with one-way ana-\nlysis of variance. Multiple comparisons of\ninter-individual data were carried out by\nFriedman's repeated-measures analysis of\nvariance on ranks with Tukey's all pairwise\ncomparison method. A P value of < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe duration of propofol infusion was\ntanil Ce, BIS, mean arterial pressure, and\nheart rate at eight time points are summar-\nized in Table 2. Table 3 lists the data\nand correlation coefficients between the\npropofol Ce at ROC and clinical variables.\nThe propofol Ce at ROC was significantly\ncorrelated with that at LOC, at discontinu-\nation of infusion, and age.\nRelationship between propofol Ce at ROC\nand LOC\nLinear regression analysis revealed a signifi-\ncant correlation between the propofol Ce at\nROC and LOC. The regression equation\nwas: Ceroc\nTable 2.

Group L had a significantly\nlower total propofol dose than Groups Z\nand Q (P < 0.05) and took significantly more\ntime to recover from anaesthesia (P < 0.05)\n(Table 5).\nThe BIS values at LOC and ROC were\npositively correlated, but the correlation\ncoefficient was not high (correlation equa-\ntion: BISROC\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we analysed the factors that\naffected the propofol Ce at ROC with TCI\nof propofol\u00adremifentanil after laparoscopic\nsurgery. Iwakiri et al.10 reported that the\npropofol Ce at ROC was significantly\ncorrelated with the Ce at LOC, but they\ndid not describe a related analysis or equa-\ntion. In the present study, we found that the\npropofol Ce at ROC was negatively corre-\nlated with age and positively correlated with\nthe Ce at LOC.\nThe propofol Ce values of Groups L, Z,\n2.3 \u00c6 0.8 mg/ml, respectively. The oldest\ngroup had a significantly lower propofol\n0.50 mg/ml of propofol was required for their\nTCI group at LOC. Ouattara et al.12 rec-\nommended decreasing the propofol concen-\ntration and dosage for elderly patients and\nusing the same dose of remifentanil. Based\non this recommendation, remifentanil at a\nCe of 4 ng/ml was used during anaesthetic\ninduction and maintenance in the present\nstudy. As indicated by the hemodynamic\nindices during induction, maintenance, and\nrecovery, the analgesic effects indeed met the\nrequirements of laparoscopic surgery.\nIn addition, the propofol Ce values at\nROC in Groups L, Z, and Q were 1.2 \u00c6 0.3,\nother words, older patients had a signifi-\ncantly lower propofol Ce at ROC, and their\nrecovery time was markedly prolonged, with\nthe longest being > 16 min. Similarly, Vuyk\net al.13 found that younger patients recov-\nered more easily from anaesthesia than did\nolder patients and that sudden awakening\nhad the potential to cause body movement\nor even injury. Older patients often recover\nmore slowly than do younger patients. Thus,\nTable 5. Propofol Ce and BIS values at LOC/ROC.\nLOC\nCeloc\nROC\nCeroc\nCestop\nT1: time taken to lose consciousness; Celoc\n: Ce of propofol at LOC; T2: time for\nrecovery; Ceroc\n: Ce of propofol at ROC; Cestop\n: Ce of propofol upon stopping\nolder patients, especially sensitive ones,\nshould be closely monitored during post-\noperative recovery to avoid low ventilation,\nrespiratory depression, and other sleep-\ninduced complications. Based on the results\nin the present study, if the recovery time and\nconcentration can be predicted according to\nthe concentration of propofol given to\npatients when they lose consciousness and\nstop using drugs, the depth of anaesthesia\ncan be adjusted on an individual-patient\nbasis, thereby allowing timely recovery and\nprecise anaesthesia.\nNevertheless, the BIS values of older and\nyoung patients at LOC or ROC were not\nsignificantly different, indicating that older\npatients were more sensitive to propofol and\nthat the BIS was more closely correlated\nwith other clinical indices. The BIS did not\nreflect the susceptibility of patients to drugs,\nas reported previously.14\nThis study had several limitations. The\nmain limitation is that the concentration of\npropofol when the infusion was stopped was\nread from the infusion pump and in most\nthe data were non-normally distributed. This\ncould be circumvented by drawing venous\nblood at different time points to detect the\nplasma concentration. Moreover, a wider\nvariety of surgery types should be evaluated\nin future studies, which will show differences\nin surgical times, intraoperative blood loss,\nand body temperature.\nROC from propofol\u00adremifentanil anaes-\nthesia after laparoscopic surgery was well\npredicted by the propofol concentration at\nLOC. The patient's age and propofol con-\ncentration were significantly correlated with\nthe time point at which ROC occurred. Older\npatients had a lower propofol concentration\nduring recovery than did young patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
