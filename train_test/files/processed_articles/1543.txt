Adjusted for demographics, the 25th versus\nModest associations were observed between SES and the big 5. Adjusting each for the other revealed that\npersonality explained roughly 20% of the SES gradient in mortality, while SES explained 8% of personality risk.\nPortions of SES and personality risk were explained by health behaviors, although some residual risk remained\nunexplained. Personality appears to explain some between-SES strata differences in mortality risk, as well as\nsome individual risk heterogeneity within SES strata. Findings suggest that both sociostructural inequalities and\nindividual disposition hold public health implications. Future research and prevention aimed at ameliorating SES\nhealth disparities may benefit from considering the risk clustering of social disadvantage and dispositional factors.\ncohort studies; health status disparities; mortality; personality\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; MCSA, Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses; OR, odds ratio; SD, standard deviation; SES,\nsocioeconomic status.\nAll-cause mortality has consistently been associated with\nboth socioeconomic status (SES) (1\u00ad4) and personality traits\n(5). These 2 factors are typically examined separately, as\neach represents a different fundamental cause of health\noutcomes: the societal stratification of wealth and resources\non one hand (6) versus an individual's basic behavioral and\npsychological tendencies on the other (7).\nAt least 2 models may characterize the interface of SES,\npersonality, and all-cause mortality. First, SES and person-\nality may represent correlated or clustered risks. For\ninstance, the notion of indirect selection (8\u00ad10) suggests\nthat certain personality dispositions lead to both downward\nsocial mobility and poor health (a confounding relation). A\ncultural/behavioral mechanism model suggests that SES\nshapes individual personality tendencies, which in turn\naffect health (8) (a mediating relation). Either case indicates\na clustering of social disadvantage with dispositional risk\nand the according possibility that personality explains\ndifferences between SES strata in all-cause mortality. Some\nfindings support the notion of SES\u00adpersonality correlation,\nsuggesting that SES influences childhood personality devel-\nopment (11, 12), personality influences school achievement\nexperiences shape personality and that adult economic\nattainment may be linked to personality (18, 19).\nA second alternative is that SES and personality consti-\ntute independent mortality risks. Some studies report\nminimal correlation between SES and personality factors\nlinked to all-cause mortality (20, 21). In this case, individual\npersonality would explain heterogeneity in all-cause\nmortality risk within, rather than between, SES strata.\nIn a recent study of all-cause mortality in France, adjust-\nment of SES estimates for personality attenuated SES\nThis has led to questions of whether similar evidence for\ncorrelated risk models exists in other populations, the public\nhealth significance of such correlated risks, and whether\nsimilar evidence can be obtained by using the comprehen-\nsive, empirically derived taxonomy of personality termed\nthe ``big 5'' (22). The big 5 system groups specific traits\nalong 5 superordinate dimensions (23, 24): neuroticism\n(composed of traits related to emotional distress), extraver-\nsion (composed of traits reflecting gregariousness, vigor,\npositive emotions), openness to experience (comprising\ntraits such as intellect and novelty-seeking), conscientious-\nness (involving traits such as diligence, organization, reli-\nability), and agreeableness (made up of traits reflecting\ncompassion, cooperation, and trust).\nWe examined whether big 5 dimensions explained social\ninequalities in all-cause mortality in the United States. The\ncausal direction of personality\u00adSES associations--that is,\nindirect selection versus cultural-behavioral mechanism\nmodels (8)--cannot be distinguished when personality and\nSES are measured contemporaneously. However, life-course\nmodels would suggest bidirectional relations between SES\nand personality (and probably health) over development\n(10). Therefore, we consider any associations between per-\nsonality and SES at baseline to reflect the product of recip-\nrocal causal relations in operation since early development\n(Figure 1). In estimating all-cause mortality risk, we inter-\npret attenuation of either personality or SES risk by the\nother conservatively as confounding, rather than invoking\nthe strong temporal assumptions inherent in mediation.\nStudy population\nThe Midlife Development in the United States national\ncohort study conducted baseline data collection in 1995,\nwith 10-year all-cause mortality follow-up data released in\n2007. Approved by ethical oversight boards, the study re-\ncruited noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults aged\nbetween 25 and 74 years by using random digit dialing in\nthese, 87% returned an accompanying mail survey. Of the\n4,244 individuals responding to at least the phone interview,\n2,998 (71%) had data on all variables of interest, incomplete\ndata being due primarily to the survey. Multivariate logit\nmodels indicated that the analysis sample did not differ from\nthe larger sample in terms of age or gender but had a slightly\nhigher average level of education (i.e., 3\u00ad4 years of college\nassessed any bias arising from this with multiple imputation\n(see below).\nStudy measures\nfollow-up assessment, the names of individuals who could\nnot be contacted for interview were submitted to the US\nNational Death Index. The cause and date of death were\nnot released to protect participants' confidentiality. Individ-\nuals identified as deceased by the National Death Index were\ncoded as deaths, while those reached for follow-up or\nconfirmed not deceased by the National Death Index were\ncoded as alive.\nSocioeconomic status. SES was assessed by a compre-\nhensive set of indicators (26, 27). These were as follows:\n1) annual household income, 2) total assets, 3) education,\nand 4) Duncan's socioeconomic index (28), a measure of\noccupational prestige. To eliminate measurement error in\nthe observed SES indicators and overadjustment of 1 SES\nindicator for several others, as well as to utilize a single SES\ndimension with greater variability than its components, we\nused factor scores from a factor analysis of SES indicators\n(Web Table 1). (This information is described in the first of 8\nsupplementary tables; each is referred to as ``Web table'' in\nthe text and is posted to the Journal's website (http://aje.\noxfordjournals.org/).) We note, however, that factor analysis\ncannot address measurement due to unobserved or omitted\nindicators of a latent dimension. Indicators loaded as\nexpected on a general SES factor. We scaled factor scores\nby the interquartile range. In other words, they remain con-\ntinuous, but the odds ratio corresponding to a 1-unit increase\nreflects the difference for an individual at the 25th versus\n75th percentiles of SES.\nPersonality. The Midlife Development Inventory (29)\nassessed the big 5. Each dimension is tapped by 4\u00ad7 specific\ntrait adjectives. Respondents rate how well each trait\ndescribes them on a 4-point Likert scale from ``a lot'' to\n``not at all.'' The Midlife Development Inventory was\ndeveloped from a large pool of big 5 trait adjectives (30)\nby identifying the smallest number that accounted for 90%\nof the variance in total scales scores, in an independent\nsample (29). Cronbach's alpha estimates of internal consis-\ntency for each scale were as follows: neuroticism, 0.74;\nand conscientiousness, 0.58. To address measurement error\nin the scales due to the observed indicators, we utilized\northogonal factor scores. Items loaded as expected on the\nbig 5 factors (Web Table 2). As with SES, factor scores were\nscaled by interquartile range.\nSocioeconomic Status\nPersonality\nAll-Cause\nMortality\n???\nBaseline: Life-Course\nBidirectional Influences =\nCross-sectional Association\nFigure 1.

Behavioral\nrisk factors were based on survey items and included current\nor former smoker, lifetime history of heavy drinking (a year\nduring one's lifetime where, on average, women consumed\n!4 or men !5 drinks at 1 setting, !3 times a week), obesity\n(body mass index of !30 kg/m2), and physical inactivity\n(moderate activity <1 time per month over the past year).\nDemographics included age, female sex, and nonwhite race.\nStatistical analysis\nWe first estimated the association between SES and\nquintiles of each big 5 factor, using ordinal logit models.\nNext, we fit a series of logistic regressions predicting all-\ncause mortality. Although mortality rates were below the\nthreshold (10%) at which odds ratios approximate relative\nrisks, we retain the term ``odds ratio'' for precision. Model 1\ncontained only age, gender, and minority status. Model 2\nincluded demographics plus SES. Model 3 included demo-\ngraphics plus the big 5. Model 4 included demographics,\nSES, and the big 5. On the basis of the odds ratios from\nmodels 2, 3, and 4, we computed the change in estimate of\nthe odds ratio for SES due to personality and for personality\ndue to SES (31) to quantify confounding. Model 5 adjusted\nmodel 4 for health behaviors, again computing change in\nestimates.\nTable 1.

Traits are centered so that values of 0 correspond to the 25th percentile, while values of 0 for SES correspond to the 75th\npercentile.\nUsing model 2\u00ad4 estimates, we also computed adjusted\npopulation attributable fractions (32, 33) to gauge the public\nhealth impact of disadvantageous SES and personality\nattributes. A reference level of the 25th percentile was used\nfor factors conferring risk and the 75th for those conferring\nbenefit. Secondary analyses examined the SES distribution\nand mortality risk of specific traits forming each composite\nSensitivity analyses examined the change in estimate in\nSES for all 32 combinations of adjustment for the big 5\nfactors. Linearity in the logit was assessed with fractional\npolynomials (35). Also screened were interactions between\ntraits of the big 5 with one another and with gender, age, and\nSES on both multiplicative and additive scales (36). We\nexamined missing data bias using multiple imputation (37)\nand whether correcting random measurement error in health\nbehaviors increased their capacity to explain observed SES/\npersonality risks, using simulation extrapolation (38). The\nsimulation step of the simulation extrapolation method\n1) fits the initial model and then 2) iteratively refits the\nmodel, each time multiplying the error term by an increas-\ningly higher scaling factor representing increasing degrees\nof measurement error. The resulting trend in estimates under\nincreasing measurement error is then used to extrapolate\nback to an estimate involving no measurement error (38).\nFinally, we used Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses (MCSA)\n(39, 40) to quantify the uncertainty in observed risk esti-\nmates due to the simultaneous operation of unmeasured\nconfounders, selection bias differential with respect to both\npersonality/SES and mortality, and systematic measurement\nerror in personality and SES. In the absence of external\ninformation to validate the distributions of bias parameters,\nMCSA results may best be interpreted as approximations of\nthe estimate uncertainty under different scenarios that might\nhypothetically characterize the data-generating process.\nAnalyses were conducted in STATA, version 10 SE,\nsoftware (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive data are presented in Table 1, with data for 25\nspecific personality traits presented in Web Table 3.\nAdjusted for demographics, the 25th versus 75th percentile\nof SES was associated with higher quintiles of neuroticism\nand with lower quintiles of extraversion (OR \u00bc 0.91, 95%\nFigure 2 depicts demographic-adjusted marginal probabili-\nties of membership in each big 5 quintile, across centiles\nof SES.\nSequential models adjusting SES for personality factors\nand vice versa are shown in Table 2.

Figure 3 depicts the move-\nment of the SES odds ratio observed during adjustment for\nall 32 possible combinations of big 5 traits. The largest\nattenuation appeared to be due to neuroticism and consci-\nentiousness. By contrast, SES explained about 8% of the\nrisk associated with neuroticism and conscientiousness (at\nhigh agreeableness) and 10% of the risk associated with\nagreeableness (at low conscientiousness). Absolute risks\nfrom model 4 for different configurations of SES and big\n5 factors are shown in Figure 4. Persons of comparable SES\nbut different personality showed nontrivial differences in\nabsolute risk.\nHealth behaviors (model 5) explained roughly 59% of the\nrisk associated with SES, 26% of that for neuroticism, 9% of\nthat for conscientiousness (at high agreeableness), and 2%\nof that for agreeableness (at low conscientiousness). When\nrandom measurement error in health behaviors was\nadjusted, the percentage of risk explained became 92%,\nDemographic-adjusted, population-attributable fractions\nsuggested that 15.9% of the population mortality was at-\ntributable to low SES, 11% to high neuroticism, and 8.6%\nto the combination of low agreeableness and conscien-\ntiousness. Mutually adjusting SES and personality for one\nanother revealed population-attributable fractions of 13.3%\nfor low SES, 9.1% for high neuroticism, and 8.6% for\nlow agreeableness and conscientiousness. By comparison,\npopulation-attributable fractions for health behaviors mutu-\nally adjusted for one another and for demographics were\nfor current smoking.\nSensitivity analyses revealed regressor linearity in the\nlogit, no other reliable additive or multiplicative interac-\ntions, and a very similar pattern of findings using multiple\nimputation. One exception was that the SES effect was\nabout 10%\u00ad14% larger but, as before, personality explained\n20% of this risk (Web Table 5). Stratification on gender\nrevealed that personality explained 21% of the SES risk in\nmen and 22% in women.\nMCSA indicated that, across all possible combinations of\nunmeasured confounding, selection bias, and systematic\nmeasurement error, with bias parameter drawn from distri-\nbutions approximating other associations within the data\n(Web Tables 6 and 7), log(relative risk) estimates differed\nfrom those observed by a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation\ndence limit ratios around point estimates were roughly\n4.5 times wider under the uncertainty entailed by these\nsupposed combinations of biases. Full MCSA findings are\npresented in Web Table 8.\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings suggest that the interface of personality,\nSES, and all-cause mortality in the United States is best\ncharacterized by some degree of correlated risk.

All other personality traits and\ndemographic factors were held at sample means. A, agreeableness; C, conscientiousness; N, neuroticism; SES, socioeconomic status; MIDUS,\nMidlife Development in the United States.\naspects of the current findings are worthy of note. First,\na recent study in France (9) reported that personality\nexplained 24%\u00ad36% of all-cause mortality risk for men\nand 11% for women. That study used specific personality\nfactors from classic psychosomatic medicine (41, 42). In the\nUnited States, using the more general big 5 personality\nframework, we found that personality accounted for about\n20% of the risk associated with lower SES, a number com-\nparable across men and women. Thus, despite large differ-\nences in populations and personality measures, our results\nsuggest some generalizability of the correlated risk model.\nResults from other studies on whether personality\naccounts for some amount of the social gradients in health\noutcomes vary. Personality constructs explain portions of\nsocial gradients in smoking and activity levels (43, 44).\nFor obesity, some evidence suggests less confounding of\nrisk (45, 46). Still other evidence suggests risk clustering\nfor dispositional hostility and low SES with respect to allo-\nstatic load (47) (i.e., systematic wear on cardiovascular,\nneuroendocrine, and immune systems (48)). Our findings\nare also consistent with previous evidence of associations\nterpret the associations observed between SES and person-\nality as the product of bidirectional influences over time,\nconsistent with life-course epidemiologic models of risk\nclustering (51) and nature\u00adnurture interplay (52).\nThe need to examine the public health impact of corre-\nlated personality and SES risks has been raised (22). Of the\n15.9% population mortality attributable to low SES, roughly\n16% could be accounted for by the big 5. Of the 11%\nattributable to high neuroticism, roughly 17% was attribut-\nable to SES. With adjustment for this confounding, nontri-\nvial proportions of mortality were still associated with both\nlow SES (13%) and personality (9.1% for high neuroticism,\n8.9% for low agreeableness and conscientiousness). Thus,\nsocial inequalities and dispositional risk would both appear\nto be important distal etiologic factors in population\nsurvival.\nAdditionally, the risk clustering that we observed was\nmodest, rather than total. Even after elimination of the con-\nfounding through adjustment, both personality and SES\nconferred residual, independently additive risk. This sug-\ngests that, despite the tendency for personality to explain\nsome portion of between-strata SES variability in mortality\nrisk, it also explains some portions of within-strata risk. In\nother words, some persons are able to offset the risk of social\ndisadvantage through adaptive personality tendencies, some\npersons negate the advantage of high SES through risky\ndispositional tendencies, and others are duly advantaged or\ndisadvantaged with respect to SES and personality.\nThe second central finding concerns the role of specific\nbig 5 factors. The elevated mortality risk for persons higher\nin neuroticism that we observed has been previously noted\n(53\u00ad58). In addition, our findings indicated that conscien-\ntiousness was protective at high levels of agreeableness.\nThis suggests that the health benefits of high conscientious-\nness may be most pronounced when people are also trusting\nand invested in creating interpersonal harmony, rather than\ncynical and prone to hostility. The self-disciplined, healthy\nbehavior characterizing high conscientiousness may be so-\ncially reinforced or facilitated by the support of others that\narises from an amicable, rather than antagonistic, approach\nto life. Such a personality style has been deemed ``effective\naltruists'' (59) for its balance between personal accomplish-\nment and beneficence toward others. High agreeableness\nconferred mortality risk at low conscientiousness. This big\n5 combination is denoted as the ``well-intentioned'' style\nand is characterized by the pursuit of interpersonal harmony\nat the expense of one's own diligence with respect to daily\nobligations and life goals (59). The quest for interpersonal\nharmony in the absence of self-discipline may signal a yield-\ning to social pressures deleterious to health. Negative health\nconsequences arising from a care-giving burden (60) or\nconflict-induced stress (61) may be particularly salient for\nsuch persons. Elevated mortality risk for higher agreeable-\nness (independent of conscientiousness) has been observed\nin prior work on childhood personality (62\u00ad64).\nThird, health behaviors explained substantial portions of\nthe SES and neuroticism effects, consistent with prior re-\nports (2). However, even after correction for measurement\nerror, residual mortality risk was observed, particularly for\nconfigurations of conscientiousness and agreeableness.\nCross-sectional, self-reported health behaviors may fail to\nfully capture health behaviors or changes in them over time.\nRemaining risk may also be a function of health behaviors\nnot examined here, such as substance abuse, behavior in-\nviting injuries, and health-care utilization. Residual risk\nmay also signal the operation of biologic processes (65\u00ad\n67) such as allostatic load. Gene\u00adenvironment interaction\nmodels (68) imply that personality phenotype may mark\ngenetic vulnerability (69, 70) to such processes.\nOur findings have several implications. Methodologically,\nrisk estimates for low SES are likely to be overestimated\nwithout adjustment for personality tendencies. At the same\ntime, absolute mortality risk for persons of lower SES may\nbe underestimated, because other dispositional risks may be\npresent and unaccounted for. At the level of prevention, our\nfindings suggest that public health messages aimed at per-\nsons of lower SES may be additionally tailored and targeted\naccording to dispositional factors (71\u00ad73). The efficacy and\ncost-effectiveness of clinical interventions with behavioral\ncomponents may be similarly improved by such tailoring\n(74, 75). Personality research might inform initiatives to\nmitigate underuse or overuse of health services among so-\ncially disadvantaged individuals (76\u00ad78). Additionally, the\nclustering of both social disadvantage and personality risk\nfor mortality suggests that evidence-based health policy\nstress both social (79) and personal (80) responsibility for\nhealth.\nAt a broader level, our results highlight the need to bet-\nter understand mechanisms of personality\u00adSES correla-\ntion. Such understanding can illuminate how and when to\nintervene in mutually reinforcing risk chains between social\ndisadvantage and health-damaging personality tendencies.\nPopulation prevention involves not only reducing this risk\nclustering but also directly mitigating social disadvantage\nand chronic emotional distress (neuroticism), while also\npromoting prosocial self-discipline (conscientiousness and\nagreeableness). Can population shifts in socioeconomic\nstructure and personality disposition occur? We believe that\nPersonality, Socioeconomic Status, and Mortality 89\nsuch shifts are possible, but only over the long term. How-\never, traditional public health targets of virtually eliminating\nsmoking and obesity in the population are similar long-term\ngoals.\nNeuroticism declines, and agreeableness and conscien-\ntiousness increase naturally over the life course (81), mean-\ning that, although personality is somewhat stable, most\npeople are not impervious to adaptive changes in basic dis-\nposition. Birth cohort (82) and cross-national differences\n(83), as well as dispositional change during social upheaval\n(84\u00ad87), also suggest that sociocultural factors influence per-\nsonality. Numerous social programs already endeavor to\nshape sociocultural factors. These include initiatives aimed\nat SES directly: programs for job training, early and life-long\neducation, tax mechanisms for reducing the burden on the\npoor, and initiatives seeking to employ or educate persons\nfrom underprivileged backgrounds. Our findings raise the\npossibility that such social programs may directly and/or\nindirectly shape population disposition as well over the long\nterm. Yet, it is important to note that personality variation\nwill likely persist for evolutionary reasons (88), even if cen-\ntral tendencies of trait distributions shift. Efforts to better\nunderstand these complex issues appear warranted.\nOn the basis of a balanced assessment of study strengths\nand limitations, we encourage interpretation of these find-\nings. We examined only all-cause mortality at 10 years and\nrefrain from speculation about the interface of SES and per-\nsonality risks for cause-specific mortality. Our findings are\nbased on a US sample and the big 5 personality framework,\nrepresenting both significant extensions of prior work and\nthe limiting frame for generalization. We eagerly await fur-\nther reports from other populations. The mortality rate in the\nMidlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Study,\nwhile consistent with lower mortality rates often observed in\nmixed-age samples, also speaks to the need for future anal-\nyses when deaths have accumulated in this cohort. Date-\nof-death data would also permit time-to-event modeling.\nFinally, our MCSA indicate that risk estimates are precisely\nthat--estimates based on available information, which\nmight vary under unknown combinations of unobserved\nbiases. We have no evidence supporting or dismissing the\nmagnitude, direction, or even the operation of such factors,\nbut we believe that the MCSA provide a useful reminder of\nthe uncertainty involved in statistical estimation.\nStudy strengths involved the first examination of which\nwe are aware of the contribution of personality to SES gra-\ndients in US all-cause mortality, careful treatment of ran-\ndom and systematic measurement error, analysis of missing\ndata patterns and bias, and quantification of a range of other\nunobserved biases. The recency of this line of investigation\nhighlights the need for more study. Personality, SES, and\ntheir interrelations have public health, clinical, and social\npolicy implications.\n"
