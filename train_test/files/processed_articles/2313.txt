Following the US Food and Drug\nAdministration's safety warnings for antidepressants in\n2004, for example, there was a slowdown in the overall\ngrowth of antidepressant use by young people,17 a decrease\nin the number of individuals receiving antidepressants\nfor depression,18 and a compensatory increase in the num-\nber of children and adolescents receiving psychotherapy\nfor depression.19 Increasing awareness of the adverse\nmetabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotic\nmedications20 is widely thought to have recently slowed\nthe growth in the use of antipsychotic treatment among\nyoung people.1,21 Other changes, such as an increase in the\nnumber of children who received a diagnosis of ADHD3\nor autism spectrum disorder,22 are somewhat more diffi-\ncult to pin on specific events or changes in the practice\nenvironment.\nOur current understanding of national trends in child\nand adolescent outpatient mental health care largely\nderives from analyses of individual classes of psychotropic\nprovide a more unified overview of recent changes in the\ndelivery of outpatient child and adolescent mental health\ncare, we present data from nationally representative sur-\nveys of office-based medical visits of broad trends and pat-\nterns of mental health care for children and adolescents in\nrelation to adults. We focus on office-based medical visits\nresulting in clinical diagnoses of mental disorders, treat-\nment by psychiatrists, prescription of psychotropic medica-\ntions, and provision of psychotherapy, and we contrast the\ntrends seen in children and adolescents with the those seen\nin youths and adults.\nMethods\nDatawereobtainedfromtheNationalAmbulatoryMedicalCare\nSurvey.25 This survey, which is conducted annually by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, samples a nationally rep-\nresentative group of visits to physicians in office-based prac-\ntice. Following the recommendations of the National Center\nfor Health Statistics, we combined data from contiguous sur-\nto derive more stable estimates. Across the 16 survey years, re-\nwith a mean rate of 65.7%. For each visit, the treating physi-\ncian or member of the physician's staff provided information\nabout the patient's sociodemographic and clinical character-\nistics, as well as the medications prescribed or supplied to the\npatient.\nDemographic Characteristics\nOn the basis of patient age, visits were first grouped into adult\n(21 years) and youth (<21 years) visits and then subgrouped\nsome analyses, visits were also grouped by sex (male and fe-\nmale) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, and Hispanic).\nIndicators of Mental Health Care\nThe 4 general indicators of mental health care included clini-\ncal mental disorder diagnosis, psychotropic medication pre-\nscription, psychotherapy provision, and psychiatric care. Vis-\nits with these indicators are correspondingly referred to as\nmental disorder visits, psychotropic medication visits, psy-\nchotherapy visits, and psychiatrist visits.\nDiagnoses were made according to the International Clas-\nsificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-\n9-CM). Visits were grouped by the presence of a mental disor-\nmentionedcodes).Preliminaryanalysesrevealedthatthenum-\nber of visits resulting in psychotic disorder and developmen-\ntal disorder diagnoses were too small to be considered as\nseparate categories. In some analyses, mood disorder visits\nwere further subgrouped by the presence of a depressive dis-\n301.13). A comorbid mental disorder diagnosis variable in-\ndexed the presence of 2 or 3 diagnostic groups (mood, anxi-\nety, disruptive behavior, psychoses/developmental, or other)\nwithin a single visit.\nVisits in which psychotropic medications were either sup-\nplied or prescribed were classified into 5 medication groups:\nResearch Original Investigation National Trends in Mental Health Care\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/20/2015\n \nantipsychotic medications; stimulants and other medica-\ntions to treat ADHD (atomoxetine hydrochloride, guanfacine\nhydrochloride, and clonidine hydrochloride); antidepres-\nsants; anxiolytics, which also included hypnotics; and mood\nstabilizers. Antipsychotics included first- and second-\ngeneration drugs. Anxiolytics included benzodiazepines and\nnonbenzodiazepine sedatives and anxiolytics. Mood stabiliz-\nersincludedlithiumcarbonate,carbamazepine,divalproexso-\ndium\u00advalproate sodium\u00advalproic acid, and lamotrigine. All an-\ntidepressants (including duloxetine hydrochloride and\ntrazodone hydrochloride, which are also used for non\u00ad\nmental health indications) were included as antidepressants.\nBurpopion hydrochloride, although also approved for treat-\nment of ADHD for individuals 6 years of age or older, was also\nconsidered as an antidepressant.\nSeparate variables indexed whether the treating physi-\ncian was a psychiatrist (including a child and adolescent\npsychiatrist or an adult psychiatrist compared with a non-\npsychiatrist physician, including pediatricians and other\nnonpsychiatrist physicians). We also examined whether psy-\nchotherapy was provided by the physician at the visit and,\nfor cross-sectional analyses, whether the nonpsychiatrist\nphysician specialized in pediatrics, general practice, family\nmedicine, internal medicine, or another medical specialty.\nSource of Payment\nDatawerecollapsedinto4mutuallyexclusivecategoriesofpri-\nmary source of payment: (1) private insurance, such as Blue\nCross/Blue Shield and other commercial insurance; (2) Medi-\ncare; (3) Medicaid and other government insurance; and (4) a\nresidual category (\"self-pay/other\") that combined patients\nwith self-payment, no charge, workers compensation, those\nwhose source of insurance was unknown, and those who re-\nceived uncompensated care. For visits with more than 1 source\nof payment, assignment was hierarchical, with visits as-\nsigned to private, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay/other in-\nsurance groups in descending order.\nAnalytic Strategy\nPopulation-basedproportionsandassociated95%CIsofoffice-\nbased adult (21 years) and youth (<21 years) visits with each\nof the 4 general mental health care indicators were deter-\n2010.

Similar population-based proportions were\ndetermined for youths by mental disorder group (Figure 1) and\npsychotropic medication class (Figure 2). For each mental dis-\norder group and psychotropic medication class, population-\nbased proportions were derived separately for children (0-13\nyears) and adolescents (14-20 years) (eTable 1 in Supple-\nment).Population-basedproportionswerethencomparedover\ntime between youth visits to psychiatrists and nonpsychia-\ntrist physicians by mental disorder group and psychotropic\nmedication class (eTable 2 in Supplement).

Visits resulting in a diagnosis of psychotic or devel-\nopmental disorder increased significantly faster among chil-\ndren than among adolescents, to the point where the 2 age\ngroups had similar population-based visit rates by 2007-\n2010. By contrast, visits resulting in diagnoses of disruptive\nbehavior disorders and visits resulting in prescriptions for\nstimulants and other medications to treat ADHD increased\nsignificantly more rapidly among adolescents than among\nlar population rates of visits in which these medications\nwere prescribed (eTable 1 in Supplement). In a post hoc\nanalysis, stimulants accounted for 91.26% of child visits and\n89.24% of adolescent visits in which medications to treat\nMental Health Care of Young People by Psychiatrists\nand Nonpsychiatrist Physicians\nAmong youths, the rate of visits resulting in mental disorder\ndiagnoses increased significantly more quickly for nonpsy-\nchiatrist physicians than for psychiatrists. Significantly faster\ngrowth in nonpsychiatrist than psychiatrist visits occurred for\ndisruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, and the re-\nsidual group of mental disorders. The rate of youth psycho-\ntropic medication visits significantly increased for both pro-\nvider groups but differed by psychotropic drug class.\nAntidepressant and antipsychotic visits increased signifi-\ncantly faster for nonpsychiatrist physicians than for psychia-\ntrists, but the reverse was true of anxiolytic visits. In 2007-\n2010, nonpsychiatrist physicians provided significantly more\noverall psychotropic medication visits than psychiatrists, in-\ncluding significantly more visits resulting in prescriptions for\nanxiolytics, and stimulants and other medications to treat\nADHD (eTable 2 in Supplement).\nCharacteristics of Child, Adolescent,\nand Adult Mental Disorder Visits\ngraphic and clinical characteristics of mental disorder visits by\nchildren, adolescents, and adults. Compared with adult and\nadolescent mental disorder visits, child mental disorder vis-\nits included the largest percentage of male patients, Hispanic\nor non-Hispanic black patients, and Medicaid patients. From\nchild to adolescent to adult mental disorder visits, there was\nan increase in the proportion of mood and anxiety disorder di-\nagnoses and in antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions.\nPsychiatrists provided a smaller percentage of mental disor-\nder visits to children than to either adolescents or adults\n(Table 2). Psychotherapy, which was provided in a minority of\nmental disorder visits to each age group, was least prevalent\namong child mental disorder visits.\nchild, 88.7% of adolescent, and 91.2% of adult mental disor-\nder visits that included psychotherapy were to a psychiatrist.\nAmong mental disorder visits that included a psychotropic\nadolescent, and 24.6% of adult visits included new prescrip-\ntions. Among mental disorder visits resulting in new psycho-\ntropic prescriptions, 72.8% of child, 64.1% of adolescent, and\n75.9% of adult visits were to nonpsychiatrist physicians.\nDiscussion\nIn contrast to adults who underwent little change in the num-\nberofmentaldisordervisitsonapopulationbasis,childrenand\nadolescents had an increasing number of visits in which men-\ntal disorders were a focus of treatment.

Be-\ncause only about one-half of children and adolescents with se-\nvere mental disorders28,29 receive treatment for their\nsymptoms, the growth in the volume of office-based mental\nhealth visits by young people suggests that progress has been\nmade in reducing the large number of young people with un-\ntreated psychiatric disorders.\nPsychiatrists and nonpsychiatrist physicians serve sepa-\nrate but overlapping functions in the delivery of office-based\nmental health care to young people.

Because most pedia-\ntriciansbelievethatitistheirresponsibilitytoidentifyandrefer\nrather than treat child and adolescent mental disorders other\nthan ADHD,31,32 their increasing treatment of a far wider range\nof mental disorders underscores the need to strengthen the\nlines of communication between primary care physicians and\npsychiatrists.33 Inresponsetothesepressures,somestateshave\ndeveloped programs that provide pediatricians with access to\ntraining and telephone consultations from child and adoles-\ncent psychiatrists and other mental health specialists at neigh-\nboring academic centers.34 The rapid growth of these\nprograms35 represents a rational policy response to the sharp\nincrease in demand for outpatient child mental health care in\noffice-based medical practice.\nAn impressive increase occurred in the number of psycho-\ntropicmedicationvisitsbychildrenandadolescents.Thenum-\nber of visits resulting in prescriptions for stimulants and other\nmedications to treat ADHD grew very rapidly for adolescents.\nprescriptions for stimulants and other medications to treat\nADHD was comparable for children and adolescents. The in-\ncreasing number of children and adolescents being pre-\nscribed stimulants and other medications for the treatment of\nADHD may be related to the maturation of ADHD treatment\nadvocacy campaigns,36 the dissemination of practice guide-\nlines for ADHD,37 and a steady stream of new medications and\nformulations approved by the US Food and Drug Administra-\ntion to treat ADHD in young people.\nThe growth in the number of stimulant prescriptions to\nadolescents raises potential safety concerns. These include ad-\nverse psychiatric events,38 risks associated with combining\nstimulants with alcohol and other sedatives,39 and the poten-\ntialforstimulantabuse.40 Yetsuchsafetyconsiderationsshould\nbe balanced against the known efficacy of stimulants in treat-\ning ADHD11 and the evidence of undertreatment. A nationally\n40.2% of adolescents with ADHD had never received mental\nhealth services for their symptoms29 and that only 20.4% had\nreceived stimulant medication in the last year.41\nAntipsychotics were the fastest growing class of psycho-\ntropic medications among young people. Although psychia-\ntrists continue to account for most office-based antipsy-\nchoticvisitsamongyoungpeople,thenumberofantipsychotic\nprescriptions made by nonpsychiatrist physicians grew very\nrapidly during the study period. Concern exists that much of\nthe growth in antipsychotic treatment of children and adoles-\ncents is the result of treating disruptive behavior disorders42\nand that antipsychotics are not generally considered a first-\nline treatment for these conditions43,44 owing to safety\nconcerns.45 As pediatricians, family practitioners, and gen-\neral practitioners assume a more prominent role in prescrib-\ning antipsychotics to children and adolescents, more consul-\ntations with psychiatrists and other mental health specialists\nwill be needed to ensure appropriate diagnostic assessments\ntogether with appropriate symptom and adverse event\nThe survey data do not offer insight into the determi-\nnants or clinical consequences of the disproportionate in-\ncrease in antipsychotic and antidepressant treatment of young\npeople by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Detailed practice-\nbased services research is needed to compare nonpsychia-\ntrist physicians and psychiatrists with respect to patient se-\nlection for these medications, their use in relation to\npsychosocial treatments, and duration of treatment. Beyond\ncharacterizing psychotropic treatment patterns, a compara-\ntive effectiveness research agenda is needed to compare out-\ncomes of mental health care provided by generalists and men-\ntal health specialists to inform evidence-based guidelines for\nwhen it is appropriate for generalists to treat, as opposed to\ndiagnose and refer, their patients with psychiatric disorders.47\nThe number of visits resulting in antidepressant prescrip-\ntions to young people also significantly increased. This in-\ncrease was particularly evident among visits to nonpsychia-\ntrist physicians. The number of antidepressant prescriptions\nto young people by nonpsychiatrist physicians increased be-\n2010, a pattern that may reflect greater reluctance to pre-\nscribe antidepressants following the black box warning in\nOctober 2004. During the study period, treatment guidelines\nwerepublishedthatendorsedantidepressanttreatmentofado-\nlescent depression14 and some anxiety disorders.13 In addi-\ntion, several antidepressants received the approval of the US\nFood and Drug Administration for the treatment of depres-\nsion (fluoxetine hydrochloride in 2003 and escitalopram oxa-\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder (fluvoxamine maleate in\nBeyond specific factors, some general considerations may\nhave further fueled the increased number of psychotropic vis-\nits among children and adolescents. During the study period,\nindividuals in the United States became more willing to take\npsychotropic medications for different conditions, including\nrelatively minor concerns such as coping with the stresses of\nlife.48 The US Food and Drug Administration Modernization\nAct (1997) encouraged pharmaceutical manufacturers to study\ntheir approved drugs in pediatric populations by extending ex-\nisting marketing protections for an additional 6 months. The\ndecreasing stigma associated with seeking treatment for men-\ntal health problems, which has been especially pronounced\namong younger individuals, may have further contributed to\nthe increasing number of prescriptions of psychotropic medi-\ncations to young people.49 Although probably less important\nforyoungpeoplethanadults,thedevelopmentofdiseaseman-\nagement and other insurance- and employer-driven mental\nhealth quality-of-care efforts for depression and other men-\ntal disorders may have contributed to the increase in the num-\nber of psychotropic and mental disorder visits during this\nPsychotherapy visits to physicians by children and ado-\nlescents remained fairly constant during the study period and\nNational Trends in Mental Health Care Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Although substantially fewer youth visits include psy-\nchotherapy than psychotropic medications, considerable\nprogress has been made in the development of specific\nevidence-based psychotherapies for some of the most com-\nmon child and adolescent mental disorders.53-55 Moreover, it\nremains far from clear whether ongoing changes in the orga-\nnization and financing of mental health care will continue to\nsupport a robust role for psychiatrists and other physicians in\nproviding psychotherapy to young people.56 In evaluating\nthese trends, it is important to bear in mind that psycho-\ntherapy provided by psychologists and social workers, which\naccounts for approximately one-half of psychotherapy provi-\nsion, is not included in the analysis.15\nIn contrast to adult mental disorder visits, which were pre-\ndominantly by female patients, adolescent and especially child\nmental disorder visits were mostly by male patients. This sex\ndifference likely reflects underlying differences in the treated\nmentaldisorders.Disruptivebehaviordisorders,whicharemore\ncommonly diagnosed in male patients than female patients,57\naccounted for most of the child mental disorder visits. Anxiety\nand mood disorders, which occur more commonly among\nfemale patients than male patients,58,59 were the most com-\nmon diagnoses among the adult mental disorder visits. Higher\nrates of disruptive behavior disorders among ethnic/racial\nminorities60,61 may also help to explain the larger proportion of\nchild,ratherthanadolescentoradult,mentaldisordervisitsthat\nwere by Hispanic and non-Hispanic black patients. Medicaid,\nwhich is available to all low-income children, paid for a larger\nshareofchild,ratherthanadult,mentaldisordervisitsandmay\nalso help to account for the ethnic/racial visit distributions.\nThese analyses have several limitations. First, the Na-\ntional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey samples visits rather\nthan patients. Because an unknown quantity of patient dupli-\ncation occurs, it is not possible to derive the number of unique\npeople who are treated in office-based practice with various\nindications of mental health care each year. However, be-\ncause each physician is randomly assigned to 1 of 52 weeks in\nthe survey year, duplication likely has only a limited effect on\nnational estimates of unduplicated visits. Second, diagnoses\nare based on the independent judgment of the treating phy-\nsician, rather than research diagnostic interviews. Third, in-\nformation is not available concerning dosages of the psycho-\ntropic medications, duration of treatment episodes, which\nmedications are intended to treat which disorders, type of psy-\nchotherapy provided by nonphysician health care profession-\nals, and medication prescriptions by nonphysicians. Fourth,\nphysician nonresponse may have biased the observed pat-\ntern of mental health care use. Finally, the sample is restricted\nto physician visits in office-based and community health cen-\nter practices and therefore does not capture visits to commu-\nnity mental health centers, hospital outpatient clinics, emer-\ngency departments, and various other outpatient settings that\nmay disproportionately serve low-income families.62 For these\nreasons, the population-based results should not be inter-\npretedasrepresentingpopulation-widementalhealthcareuse.\nConclusions\nOverthelastseveralyears,therehasbeenanexpansioninmen-\ntalhealthcaretochildrenandadolescentsinoffice-basedmedi-\ncal practice.

Yet it also poses risks related to adverse\nand poorly coordinated services.65 The bulk of the increased\nprovision for child and adolescent mental health care in office-\nbased medical settings occurred outside of psychiatric prac-\ntice.
