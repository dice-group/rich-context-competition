Given that one half of all fractures\noccur in women without WHO BMD defined osteoporosis,\ntreatment that is initiated based on BMD alone will not\ntreat a large proportion of women who eventually go on to\nfracture.(3,4) In general, compared with treatment based on\nBMD alone, the emphasis on treating based on absolute\nrisk of fracture will decrease the proportion of 50- to 60-\nyr-old women who are treated with drugs because they\nhave a low risk of fractures. On the other hand, this ap-\nproach may result in treating a large proportion of older\npeople, particularly older white women who have higher\nabsolute risk of fracture. However, regardless of ethnicity,\nincreasing age is associated with increased fracture risk.(5)\nThe proportions of various age groups that would be\n1San Francisco Coordinating Center, California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, California, USA; 2Park Nicollet Health\nServices and Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; 3University of\nMinnesota and CCDOR VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; 4University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA;\n5Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Portland, Oregon, USA; 6University of California San Francisco, San Francisco,\nCalifornia, USA.\nDr Schousboe has received research support from Eli Lilly & Co\nand consulting fees from Roche.

All other authors state that\nthey have no conflicts of interest.\ntreated under the new NOF guidelines are not known.\nTherefore, we used data from the Study of Osteoporotic\nFractures (SOF) and applied the new NOF treatment\nguidelines to estimate the proportion of white women :\n65 yr of age who would be recommended for pharmaco-\nlogic treatment. SOF is a community-based sample of\nwomen from four urban areas. To confirm how well SOF\nrepresents the U.S. white female population 65 yr of age,\nwe compared the SOF population to white females 65 yr\nof age who participated in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) on treat-\nment criteria listed in the NOF guidelines (including\nFRAX) common to both cohorts. This was done to gauge\nthe similarities of the two cohorts on treatment criteria and\nto confirm the accuracy of the proportion that would be\nrecommended for treatment in the U.S. white female\npopulation compared with SOF.\nWe used data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures\n(SOF), a prospective study of community-dwelling white\nwomen 65 yr of age recruited from four communities in\nthe United States: Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis, MN;\nPortland, OR; and Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh,\nPA. Participants were recruited from population-based\nwas initiated before widespread publicity about osteopo-\nrosis and women were not recruited on the basis of any risk\nfactors for osteoporosis. All participants provided in-\nformed consent. This study was approved by the Institu-\ntional Review Board at each of the participating sites.\nDemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle,\nand medical history\n9704). Women provided information regarding fracture\nhistory, smoking status, alcohol consumption, parental hip\nfracture history, rheumatoid arthritis, and corticosteroid\nuse.\nHeight was measured with a wall-mounted Harpenden\nstadiometer (Holtain, DyFed, UK). Weight was measured\nwith a balance beam scale. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared.\nBMD\nthe proximal femur and lumbar spine by DXA using QDR\n1000 densitometers (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). This\n(hip BMD by DXA was not available at baseline). T-scores\nfor the femoral neck (FN), and total hip were calculated\nbased on the means and SDs obtained from the NHANES\nIII.(7) T-scores for the spine were calculated using the\nreference value provided by the manufacturer (Hologic).\nWHO 10-yr absolute fracture risk\nThe WHO 10-yr absolute risk of both hip fracture and\nmajor osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical spine, forearm, or\nshoulder) was calculated by the WHO Collaborating\nCenter for Metabolic Bone Disease. Calculation of abso-\nlute risk was done following the FRAX algorithm.(2,8)\nFRAX is described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the calcu-\nlation of the 10-yr probabilities is based on nine risk factors\n(age, sex, BMI, previous history of fracture, parental his-\ntory of hip fracture, current smoking, use of corticosteroids\nin past 3 mo, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, and three or\nmore alcoholic beverages per day). The 10-yr probabilities\nfor both hip and major osteoporotic fracture can be cal-\nculated with or without FN BMD. The NOF treatment\nguidelines use the 10-yr absolute risks (hip and major os-\nteoporotic fracture) calculated using FN BMD.\nNHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of adults and children in the\nUnited States. The survey uses a stratified complex sam-\npling strategy to identify and examine a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of ;5000 persons each year. We used data\nfrom white women 65 yr of age who participated in\nNHANES III. A direct estimation of the proportion of\nwhite women 65 yr of age who would be recommended\nfor treatment under the NOF guidelines cannot be per-\nformed using NHANES III because lumbar spine BMD,\npaternal history of fracture, and personal history of frac-\nture at skeletal sites other than the hip, spine, and wrist\nwere not assessed in NHANES III. For those factors in\nFRAX and/or the NOF guidelines that were measured in\nboth SOF and NHANES III, we reported the mean values\nfor continuous variables (age, BMI, and BMD) and pro-\nportions for dichotomous variables (personal history of\nfracture, maternal history of fracture, rheumatoid arthritis,\ncurrent smoking, and consumption of 3 alcoholic drinks/\nd). NHANES III data were obtained from the publicly\navailable data release (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.\nhtm). Means and proportions were adjusted for the\nNHANES III sampling strategy as recommended in the\nNHANES analysis guidelines using the SURVEYMEANS\nand SURVEYFREQ procedures in SAS (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA).\nAnalysis\nWomen in SOF were excluded from the analysis if they\nhad missing data for any of the factors required to apply the\nIn women and men age 50 or older,\npharmacologic therapy should be recommended for those with:\nA history of hip fracture or clinical or radiographic spine fracture\nT-score  22.5 at femoral neck or spine*\nfemoral neck or lumbar spine and any of the following\n3% 10-yr probability of hip fracture OR\n20% 10-yr probability of a major osteoporotic fracture\nbased on the WHO model for the United States\n* After excluding secondary causes.\nNOF guidelines, including those required to calculate\nFRAX. We applied the NOF guidelines as given in Table\n1 to determine the proportion of women who would be\nrecommended for treatment.\nRadiographic vertebral fracture status was available in\nSOF. However, this information is not routinely collected\nin the usual care setting and therefore, to conservatively\napply the guidelines, we did not include information about\nradiographic vertebral fractures in determining whether a\nwoman should be treated.\nIn the primary analysis, the criterion ``past history of hip\nfracture or clinical or radiographic vertebral fracture'' was\nconservatively limited to past history of hip fracture. We\nalso estimated the proportion of women who would be\nrecommended for treatment if a history of clinical verte-\nbral fractures was included. We also applied the criterion\n``T-score 22.5 at femoral neck or spine'' and ``osteopenia\nand 10-yr risk of hip fracture 3% or osteopenia and major\nosteoporotic fracture 20%'' alone. Finally, to determine\nif the proportion of women who would be recommended\nfor treatment differed by age, we analyzed women 65 and\nRESULTS\nA total of 9704 women participated in the baseline ex-\namination. Between baseline and visit 2, 253 women died,\n39 were terminated, 72 did not return for visit 2 but were\nmonitored for fracture outcomes through postcard, and\nreturned for visit 2 (when DXA measurements of the hip\nand spine were completed), 7778 had complete BMD data\navailable at the hip and spine. Among those with complete\nBMD data, 1682 were missing data for at least one criterion\nin FRAX or the NOF guidelines--most commonly pater-\nnal history of hip fracture. Thus, 6096 women were in-\ncluded in the analysis. Women who were missing at least\none FRAX or NOF criteria had similar age, BMI, and\nfemoral neck BMD.\nWomen in SOF were younger (71 versus 74 yr) and had\nslightly higher BMD at the femoral neck and total hip\ncompared with NHANES III. Therefore, women in SOF\nhad a lower prevalence of T-scores below 22.5 and a\nhigher number with T-scores >21.0. Fewer women in SOF\nreported a previous hip fracture compared with the women\nproportion of women in SOF 75 yr of age reported a\nhistory of previous wrist fracture compared with the\nOverall, applying the modified NOF guidelines to\nwomen 65 yr of age, 71.8% would be recommended for\ntreatment (Table 3). When history of clinical vertebral\nfracture is included, 72.5% of women would be recom-\nmended for treatment. When the guidelines are applied to\nwomen 75 yr of age, 93% of women would be recom-\nmended for treatment.\nApplying only the criterion of ``T-score 22.5 at fem-\noral neck or spine'' would recommend 40.4% of women for\ndrug treatment (Table 3). However, if T-score 22.5 is\nlimited to only the femoral neck, 20.7% would be recom-\nmended for treatment (Table 3). Applying only the crite-\nrion, ``low bone mass and 10-yr risk of hip fracture 3% or\nmajor osteoporotic fracture 20%'' would recommend\n51.5% of women for drug treatment.\nDISCUSSION\nWe estimate that the new NOF guidelines would rec-\nommend that pharmacologic treatment should be initiated\nfor about three quarters of the participants in the SOF\nstudy and >90% of women >75 yr of age. These figures\nunderestimate the proportions that would be recom-\nmended for treatment in the U.S. population because\nwomen in SOF had somewhat higher BMD values and\nwere somewhat younger than the women in the U.S. pop-\nulation-based NHANES III survey. Furthermore, we did\nnot include some criteria for treatment, such as a history or\npresence of a radiographic vertebral fracture--inclusion of\nthis would further increase the number recommended for\ntreatment. Our estimates are consistent with results from\nthe Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study that found\nthat over two thirds of white women 65 yr of age would\nhave a 10-yr probability of fracture 20% based on BMD\nand the risk factors used in the WHO model.(9) Although\nthe NOF cost-effectiveness analysis did not report the\nproportion of women who would be treated under the NOF\nguidelines, they do conclude that pharmacologic treatment\nwould be cost-effective for the average 68-yr-old white\nwoman.(10) Thus, given that the average age of women who\nparticipated in SOF was 71 yr, it is consistent that we es-\ntimated that a high proportion (73%) of women would be\nrecommended for drug treatment.\nOur analysis suggests that about one half of the older\nwhite women recommended for pharmacologic treatment\nunder the new guidelines would be included because they\nhave low bone mass (osteopenia) at one of the two skeletal\nsites and at least one risk factor: a 10-yr estimated proba-\nbility of hip fracture 3% or 10-yr estimated probability of\nmajor osteoporotic fracture 20%. When so many people,\nand such a large proportion of older women, are recom-\nmended for drug treatment, it is important that the as-\nsumptions underlying the recommendations be based on\nrobust data. In particular, it is important that there be\nstrong evidence that all of those people would substantially\nbenefit from treatment. There have been few trials of the\nefficacy of treatments in this group, and it is uncertain\nwhether treatment reduces the risk of nonvertebral frac-\ntures in people with osteopenia and no vertebral frac-\nnot selected for osteoporosis, found a 20% decreased risk\nof clinical fractures.(14) On the other hand, the ``Clinical\nFracture Arm of FIT'' found no significant reduction in risk\nof fracture in women with osteopenia (hip BMD T-scores >\n22.5).(15) Moreover, in the risedronate hip study, no clear\nfracture reduction benefit compared with placebo was\nnoted among women 80 yr of age who were selected on\nthe basis of risk factors and not BMD.(16) Even in the\nWomen's Health Initiative trial, it seemed that women with\nfemoral neck BMD T-score <22.5 had a greater reduction\nWe found that ;21% of women in SOF had osteoporosis\ndefined as a femoral neck BMD T-score 22.5. In the FIT\ntrial, alendronate decreased the risk of all clinical fractures\nby 31% in this group.(15) Expanding treatment by including\nwomen who had a spine BMD T-score 22.5 added an-\nother 19% of white women. To date, all FDA-approved\nagents are effective in reducing vertebral fractures, and this\neffect does not seem to vary by BMD.\nOur estimates have several limitations. SOF enrolled\nU.S. white women may have changed; in particular, there\nhave been secular increases in weight. Our estimates were\nbased on the WHO model that includes femoral neck BMD\nand BMI (which includes height and weight), a temporal\nAge, mean (yr)\nBMI, mean (kg/m2)\nBMD\nFN, mean (g/cm2)\nFN, T-score (%)\nAll\nTotal hip, mean (g/cm2)\nTotal hip, T-score (%)\nAll\nFracture history (age  50) (%)\nHip\nWrist\nParental history of hip fracture (%)\nMother only\nRheumatoid arthritis (%)\n>2 alcoholic beverages/d (%)\nCurrent smoker (%)\npopulation increase in weight may be associated with an\nincrease in BMD over time. Thus, these population trends\nin body size might be associated with a decrease in the\nprevalence of osteoporosis. A second limitation of our\nanalysis is that SOF is a cohort of community-dwelling\nvolunteers and not a population-based sample. However,\ncharacteristics of the SOF participants are similar to, or\nhealthier than, those of the population-based NHANES\nIII, and therefore may underestimate the proportion of\nwomen who would be recommended for treatment. Third,\nFRAX may underestimate the 10-yr probability of major\nosteoporotic fracture among those who have a radio-\ngraphic vertebral fracture. We conservatively excluded X-\nray fractures when the FRAX 10-yr probabilities were\ncalculated by the WHO (i.e., X-ray based fractures were\nnot included as a ``history of previous fracture'' in the\nFRAX calculations). Fourth, because this analysis from\nSOF includes only white women 65 yr of age, this study is\nnot able to estimate the proportion of younger women and\nmen and women of other racial groups who would be\nrecommended for pharmacologic treatment. Presumably,\nthe proportion of people in these groups recommended for\ntreated will be substantially less than the estimates from\nSOF because they have a lower risk of fracture and lower\nprevalence of osteoporosis. Finally, our estimate of the pro-\nportion of women who would be recommended for treat-\nment is based on FRAX estimates from WHO as of early\n2008. If new FRAX estimates become available, the pro-\nportion of women recommended for treatment may change.\nWe conclude that the new NOF guidelines for pharma-\ncologic treatment for osteoporosis would recommend drug\ntherapy to at least three quarters of white women 65 yr of\nage and 90% of those >75 yr. When such a large proportion\nof older women are recommended to receive drug treat-\nment for osteoporosis, it is important that the assumptions\nthat underlie that analysis be based on robust evidence. A\ntrial of bisphosphonate therapy and/or other pharmaceu-\ntical agents in women and men with just ``low bone mass''\nwould be informative.\n"
