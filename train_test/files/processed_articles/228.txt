Population-based estimates of the\nprevalence of urinary incontinence among older\nwomen range from 34 to 45% for incontinence defined\nas one or more episodes in the past year [1-4] and from\n3 to 7% for incontinence denned as once or more\nepisodes per day [1-3, 5]. The prevalence of incon-\ntinence in men has been less well studied, but appears\nto be roughly one-half of that in women [2, 3, 5]. The\ndirect medical cost of urinary incontinence in the US\nhas been estimated at over 10 billion dollars each year\n[6]. The indirect costs, due to increased risk of\nhospitalization or nursing home admission, are\nunknown.\nUrinary incontinence has been associated with\nseveral medical conditions, including neurological\ndisease [7], depression [5], cardiovascular disease [7]\nand cerebrovascular disease [8]. However, these\nassociations have been based on cross-sectional data\nwhich cannot establish the temporal relationship\nbetween urinary incontinence and the associated\ncondition. In addition, previous studies have generally\nrelied on patient self-report of medical conditions,\nrather than review of medical records.\nUrinary incontinence has also been associated with\nmultiple hospital admissions and is believed to be an\nimportant cause of admission to long-term care\nfacilities [8, 9]- While the prevalence of urinary\nincontinence is higher in long-term care facilities [10]\nand among individuals with multiple hospitalizations\nD. H. Thorn et al.\n[8], urinary incontinence has not been evaluated as a\nrisk factor for hospitalization or nursing home admis-\nsion independently of other co-morbid conditions.\nThe current study examined the relation between\nseveral medical conditions, documented by medical\nrecord review and the subsequent diagnosis of urinary\nincontinence over a 9-year period in two cohorts of\nolder adults, hi addition, the study assessed urinary\nincontinence as an independent risk factor for hospi-\ntalization, nursing home admission and total mortality.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe study population consisted of two cohorts, each\ncomposed of approximately 3000 randomly selected\nmembers of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Northern\nCalifornia (KFHP), a large health maintenance organi-\nzation enrolling approximately 25% of the general\npopulation in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento\nMetropolitan areas. As a traditional health maintenance\norganization, KFHP provides virtually all care for its\nmembers within its own facilities and thus has medical\nrecords for over 90% of all office visits and hospitaliza-\ntions by its members. All subjects had been KFHP\nmembers for at least 5 years and over 80% had been\nmembers for more than 10 years. The first cohort was\nolder in 1971. The second cohort was composed of\ncohort. Both cohorts were randomly selected from\nyears and 80+ years) and gender to provide approxi-\nmately equal numbers in each age-gender group. The\nsampling fractions for each of the three age groups\nwere 5, 10 and 20%, respectively. Previous compar-\nisons have shown that members of KFHP are generally\nrepresentative of the population in the same geographi-\ncal area with respect to race and income (except at the\nvery high and very low ends of the income spectrum)\n[11-13] and include a broad distribution of educa-\ntional levels (11% less than high school, 20% high-\nschool graduates, 35% some college and 32% college\nData collection\nSubjects were followed for 9 years after the index year\nby reviewing and abstracting inpatient and outpatient\nmedical records and by reviewing computerized hos-\npitalization data. The prevalence of each medical\ncondition at baseline was established by reviewing\nmedical records and hospitalization data for 4 years\nprior to the index year. A pilot study found that 97% of\nprevalent chronic conditions were mentioned within 4\nyears, even if the diagnosis had been made earlier.\nMortality was ascertained using the California Auto-\nmated Mortality Linkage Information System [14] for\nthe 12-year period following the index year. Sixty-eight\nsubjects from both cohorts who died in the first 3 years\nof the second cohort were counted in both cohorts and\nrepresented 2.2% of all deaths. Subjects who died or\nwho disenrolled from KFHP during the 9-year period\nwere assigned a follow-up time equal to the difference\nbetween the index date and the date of dropout. There\nwere no differences in dropout rates between the two\ncohorts.\nDetailed chart abstraction was performed by trained\nresearch personnel using a structured abstraction\nform. Information was abstracted for 32 medical\nconditions and included the date of onset and the\ndate of diagnosis. In addition to data abstracted from\nthe subjects charts, hospitalizations and nursing home\nadmissions were available from the KFHP database.\nThe chart abstraction form did not distinguish between\nurinary and faecal incontinence. To assess the degree\nto which 'incontinence' referred to urinary incon-\ntinence, a random sample of 49 charts from subjects\nwith a diagnosis of incontinence was reviewed. Forty-\nsix (94%) of the 49 subjects had a diagnosis of urinary\nincontinence recorded in their chart. Of these 46, 40\n(87%) had a diagnosis of only urinary incontinence and\nsix (13%) diagnoses of both urinary and faecal\nincontinence. Only three (6%) of the 49 subjects had\na diagnosis of faecal incontinence without a diagnosis\nof urinary incontinence.\nData analysis\nThe prevalence of incontinence and other diagnoses\nwas calculated as the percent of all observations in\neach cohort at baseline who had had the condition\nwithin the previous 4 years. Incidence rates for each\ndiagnosis were calculated as the number of newly\nrecognized events in the 9-year follow-up period,\nexcluding prevalent cases from the analyses, over the\ntotal follow-up time in person-years per 1000. Follow-\nup time for incidence rates was calculated as the time\nfrom baseline to the first event, dropout, death or end\nof study period, whichever occurred first. Similar\nprocedures were used for calculating rates of hospita-\nlization, nursing home admissions and mortality by\nincontinence status.\nThe association between disease condition and\nincident incontinence was examined using a propor-\ntional hazards model [15] with incontinence as the\ndependent variable. The association between incident\nor prevalent incontinence and the outcomes of hos-\npitalization, nursing home admission and mortality\nwere examined using a proportional hazards model.\nTime from incident incontinence to the outcome of\ninterest (hospitalization, nursing home admission or\ndeath) was used as a measure of survival time in those\nIncontinence, institutionalization and mortality\nTable I.

Time from baseline to the\noutcome of interest was used as a measure of survival\ntime in those with prevalent incontinence.\nAll models were gender-specific and included adjust-\nment for cohort and for age (as a continuous variable).\nAdditional adjustment was made for co-morbid con-\nditions if including them in the model significantly\nchanged the estimated association between incon-\ntinence and the variable of interest.\nResults\nThe demographic characteristics for each cohort are\npresented in Table 1. The age and gender distribution\nreflects the gender- and age-stratified sampling used to\ncreate the cohorts.\nAs shown in Table 2, the prevalence and incidence of\nmost of the 11 common disease conditions of interest\nare similar (within 20%) between the two cohorts. The\nexceptions are: hypertension and cerebral vascular\ndisease (strokes and transient ischaemic attacks),\nwhich were more prevalent in the second cohort;\ngout, which was more prevalent and had a higher\nincidence in the second cohort; and incontinence,\nwhich had a higher prevalence in the second cohort.\nSubsequent analyses combine both cohorts, with\nadjustment for cohort in all models.\nTable 3 provides a more detailed look at the baseline\nprevalence and incidence rate of incontinence by age\nand gender. As expected, both incidence and pre-\nvalence increase with age for both men and women\nand both are greater in women than men, with the\nexception of incident incontinence among subjects\nThe associations between incident incontinence and\npreviously diagnosed medical conditions of interest are\npresented in Table 4. The first four conditions\n(Parkinsonism, dementia, cerebral vascular disease,\ndepression and congestive heart failure) were selected\nbecause of previously reported cross-sectional associa-\ntions with urinary incontinence. The remaining two\nconditions, osteoarthritis and gout, were selected\nbecause they are common conditions which would\nbe expected to have little association with urinary\nincontinence. The risk ratios for incontinence are\nsignificantly elevated for subjects with a medical record\ndiagnosis of Parkinson's disease, dementia, cerebral\nvascular disease and congestive heart failure, in both\nmen and women. Neither gout not osteoarthritis were\nassociated with an increased risk of incontinence in\nmen, but osteoarthritis was associated with a slightly\nincreased risk in women.\nThe association between prevalent or incident\nincontinence and hospitalization and admission to a\nskilled nursing facility is shown in Table 5. The\nfollowing co-morbid conditions were entered, step-\nwise into the model: dementia, Parkinson's disease,\ncerebral vascular disease, depression, congestive heart\nfailure, ischaemic heart disease, chronic lung disease,\nIncontinence\nParkinsonism\nDementia\nCerebral vascular disease\nDepression\nCongestive heart failure\nOsteoarthritis\nGout\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nAcute myocardial infarction\nBaseline prevalence\nn\n%\nCohort\nn\n%\nIncidence\nCE\nCE\nCE, cumulative events; P-Y, person-years.\nD.

After adjustment for\nage and cohort and the co-morbid conditions listed in\nTable 5, women with incontinence were 30% more\nlikely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to be\nadmitted to a nursing home as women without incon-\ntinence. Men with incontinence were 47% more likely\nto be hospitalized and over three times more likely to\nadmitted to a nursing home.\nThe risk of mortality associated with medically\nrecognized incontinence was evaluated using the\nsame approach. The results, reported in Table 6,\nshow that the crude association between incontinence\nand mortality was substantially less after adjustment for\nco-morbid conditions. After adjustment, there\nremained a non-significant increased risk for women\nand a small but still significant increased risk (20%) for\nmen.\nTable 4.

Cohort data from a large,\nrepresentative population were used to examine,\nprospectivery, the association between urinary incon-\ntinence, other incident disease, hospitalization, nur-\nsing home admissions and mortality. Diagnoses were\ndetermined by medical record review, hospitalizations,\nnursing home admission and mortality from computer-\nized data bases. The risks of hospitalization, nursing\nhome admission and mortality associated with incon-\ntinence were analysed separately for men and women\nand adjusted for co-morbid conditions, as well as age\nand cohort.\nWomen were more likely to be incontinent at\nbaseline than men, a finding consistent with previous\nThe ratio of the prevalence of incontinence in women\ndecreased with age. Most previous studies have\nreported ratios around 2 for adults over 60 years of\nage, although in older age groups (e.g. 85 years old and\nolder) and with more severe incontinence, ratios\nbelow 1.5 have been reported [7, 17]. The incidence\nof incontinence in the current study increased with age\nIncontinence, institutionalization and mortality\nTable 5.

In contrast,\nHerzog et al. reported approximately twice the\nincidence of incontinence in women as in men aged\n60 years and older [18]. However, when one looks at\nthe rate of new, severe incontinence among those\npreviously reporting no or mild incontinence in this\nstudy, the rates for women and men are virtually the\nsecond year) [18]. The higher incidence among men in\nthe oldest age group of the current study (37%) may be\nrelated to the higher prevalence of prostate disease in\nthis group. The increase in incidence of incontinence\nbetween the two cohorts may represent an increased\nsensitivity by providers to diagnosing and documenting\nurinary incontinence for the later cohort.\nTable 6.

Neurological disease\n(not otherwise specified) has been associated with\nurinary incontinence in a study of men and women\naged 85 and older [7]. An association between\nincontinence and cerebrovascular disease has been\nreported in women but not in men in one study [8].\nHowever, stroke was not associated with incontinence\nfor either men or women in another study [19]. The\nassociation between dementia and incontinence,\nfound in the current study, has been previously\nreported in cross-sectional studies [20], including at\nleast one that was population-based [17]. The associa-\ntion between depression and incontinence in the\ncurrent study is consistent with a previous popula-\ntion-based study which found depression to be more\ncommon among subjects with incontinence [5]. The\ncurrent study also found an increased risk of incon-\ntinence following the diagnosis of congestive heart\nfailure. Another population-based study reported a\nsignificant association between urinary incontinence\nand cardiovascular disease in women only [7], but did\nnot examine congestive heart failure separately.\nThese previous studies were all cross-sectional and\nrelied on patient self-reporting. The associations repor-\nted in the current prospective study suggest that\nincontinence follows the medically documented diag-\nnosis of each of these conditions. However, while the\nprospective nature of the data helps to identify the\ntemporal relation between diagnosis of incontinence\nand diagnosis of other conditions, it cannot establish\nthe temporal relationship between the onset of\nsymptoms, since both urinary incontinence and the\nD. H. Thorn et al.\nconditions with which it was associated may have\nsubstantial lag periods between onset of symptoms and\ndiagnosis. It is possible that the onset of a new disease\ncondition might worsen pre-existing incontinence and\nlead to its diagnosis or might lead to a diagnosis of pre-\nexisting incontinence due to increased medical atten-\ntion. Even when incontinence clearly follows the\ndevelopment of a medical condition, the relationship\nmay not be causal, but may reflect a common relation-\nship with a third factor. For example, impaired mobility\nhas been suggested as an important mediating factor in\ndementia and other neurological diseases [21]. Such a\nmechanism might explain the modest association\nfound between arthritis and incontinence among\nwomen in the current study and previously reported\nin a cross-sectional population study [19]. For con-\ngestive heart failure, the association with incontinence\ncould be mediated through treatment with a diuretic.\nUnlike the other conditions investigated in this\nstudy, depression could as easily be a consequence of\nincontinence as a cause. Since both depression and\nincontinence can have a substantial lag time from\nsymptoms to diagnosis, it is possible that the associa-\ntion observed is in part due to undiagnosed incon-\ntinence preceding depression. To explore this\npossibility, the data were analysed to determine the\nassociation between prevalent incontinence and the\nsubsequent risk of depression. For women, there was\nno increased risk of subsequent depression among\nthose with previously diagnosed incontinence after\nadjustment for age and cohort (risk ratio = 0.9, 95%\nCI = 0.6-1.6), while in men the age and cohort-\nadjusted risk of depression was greater among those\nsuggesting that the relationship may be bi-directional\nin men.\nThe association between incontinence and admis-\nsion to a nursing home supports the commonly held\nbelief that urinary incontinence is an important risk\nfactor for nursing home admission [9]. At least one\nprevious study showed incontinence, particularly in\nthe presence of aggressive behaviour, to be a significant\npredictor of nursing home admission among demented\noutpatients [22]. The association between inconti-\nnence and risks of hospitalization and nursing home\nadmission in the current study persisted even after\nadjustment for age, gender and multiple co-morbid\nconditions. It is possible that one or more additional\nfactors, not in the data set and therefore not controlled\nfor, could be associated with both incontinence and\nnursing home admission, but the persistence of the\nassociation after adjustment for multiple disease\nconditions makes this explanation unlikely.\nPrevious studies have suggested that incontinence,\nespecially of new onset, may be an independent risk\nfactor for increased mortality among hospitalized\npatients with pneumonia [23] and patients admitted\nto anursing home [24]. The resultsfrom population-based\nstudies of the association between urinary inconti-\nnence and mortality have not been consistent. One\nstudy of 559 older adults, including those in institu-\ntions, reported that the 3-year mortality for incontinent\nsubjects was over twice that of continent subjects [17].\nHowever, when survival was plotted by age, the\ndifference was much less. A recent study by Herzog\net al. of nearly 2000 community-residing older adults\nfound no association between incontinence and risk of\ndeath after adjusting for age, education, number of\nmedical conditions and self-assessed health status [25].\nThe current results of a small increased risk of mortality\namong incontinent men only tends to support the\nstudy by Herzog et al. It is possible that the small\nassociation remaining after adjustment in the current\nstudyreflectsan association between incontinence and\nother health conditions not measured (and therefore\nnot adjusted for in the data). These results suggest that\nin contrast to the associations between incontinence\nand hospitalizations and nursing home admission,\nwhere the presence of incontinence can plausibly\nplay a direct role in the decision to institutionalize, the\nassociation between incontinence and mortality is\nprobably mediated primarily through co-morbid\ndisease conditions.\nThe current study has several limitations. Approxi-\nmately 6% of the subjects with incontinence had faecal\nincontinence only. However, this small proportion\nwould not be likely to have a large effect on the study's\nfindings. The study also relied on incontinence noted\nin the patient's medical record. Studies have shown\nthat only about one-third of all people with urinary\nincontinence seek medical attention [1, 4] and those\nwith more severe incontinence are more likely to seek\nhelp. Most studies use one or more definitions of\nurinary incontinence based on an average or on the\nmost recent number of episodes over a past period of\ntime (from 1 day to 12 months). However, using a\ndefinition of 'medically noted' urinary incontinence\nhas the advantage of representing what providers 'see'\nin their practice. The prevalence of urinary incon-\ntinence found in this study--about 7% for women and\n5% for men--is similar to the prevalence for incon-\ntinence occurring several times per week or more\nDefining incident urinary incontinence is by nature\ndifficult, as onset is often gradual and remission\ncommon [2]. For this reason, few studies even attempt\nto address incident incontinence [2]. The current study\nused a precise definition of urinary incontinence--its\nfirst mention in the medical record--recognizing that\nthis lags behind the actual onset. It is also possible that\nthe diagnosis of particular conditions would have\ntriggered an inquiry into the presence of incontinence,\ncreating a false association between the condition and\nincontinence.\nA final limitation is that no direct measure of\nfunctional status was available in the current study\nIncontinence, institutionalization and mortality\nand in fact -would not be feasible for a study of this size\nand for this length of follow-up. The large amount of\ndata on co-morbid conditions was used as a proxy for\nfunctional status. In addition, functional status, as\nmeasured by such commonly used scales as the\nInstrumental Activities of Daily Living [26], Activities\nof Daily Living [27] or the Barthel index [28] is partially\ndetermined by continence status. The later two scales\ninclude incontinence in the measure and the first\nincludes activities that may be indirectly related to\nincontinence (e.g. shopping, housekeeping). It is\nnonetheless possible that functional limitations other\nthan those caused by urinary incontinence or mea-\nsured co-morbid conditions could explain some or all of\nthe association between incontinence and hospitaliza-\ntion and nursing home admission reported in this\nstudy.\nThe current study confirmed and extended previous\nfindings of an association between urinary inconti-\nnence and several other disease conditions and\nsuggested that incontinence is associated with a\nsignificantly increased risk of hospital and nursing\nhome admissions independently of age, gender and\nmultiple co-morbid conditions. Further studies are\nneeded to establish the independent contribution of\nurinary incontinence to the risk of institutionalization\nand to determine whether interventions to reduce\nurinary incontinence are also effective in reducing the\nrisk of institutionalization.\n"
