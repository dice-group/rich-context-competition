Dwyer3\n1 Department of Economics, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio, United States of America, 2 Office of Regulations Policy and Social Science, Food and Drug Administration,\nCollege Park, Maryland, United States of America, 3 School of Health, Technology and Management and Department of Economics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook,\nNew York, United States of America\n Introduction\nConsumption of illegal drugs among adolescents is a major\npublic health concern in the United States [1,2]. A 2009 Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study revealed that\nclose to 10% of all youths surveyed report usage of illegal drugs\nbefore the age of 13, with marijuana being the most common type\nof illicit substance that is abused. In addition, a trend toward\nearlier onset of drug use has also been observed among middle and\nhigh school students [3]. Besides being associated with poor\noutcomes such as liver disease, lung disease, neuropsychological\ndeficits and elevated medical care utilization [4], adolescent drug\nuse is also correlated with risk behaviors, such as violence,\ndelinquency, suicide, unprotected sex and other antisocial\nbehaviors [1].\nResearch on adolescent substance use has consistently identified\na strong relationship between adolescent behavior and the\nbehavior of their peers [5\u00ad10]. From a policy perspective, the\npotential existence and the magnitude of the social network effects\nis of interest since ``peer effects may serve to amplify the effects of\ninterventions'' [11]. However, peer effects are difficult to estimate\nand causal interpretations must be undertaken with caution since\nindividuals in most cases choose with whom to associate [12]. In\nother words, estimates without accounting for peer selection are\nunable to identify accurately whether an individual's behavioral\nchoices in some way varies with behavior of the reference group\n[13]. Peer selection implies that the correlation in behavior could\nbe attributed to the similarity among individuals, whereas, peer\ninfluence implies that the correlation is due to the peer behavior.\nDisentangling the peer influence from spurious unobserved factors\nassociated with peer selection [7] is important if we are to\naccurately predict the success of policies aimed at reducing drug\nuse among adolescents. Thus, if there are common underlying\nattributes of individuals within a peer group that drive behavior\nmore than peer influence, policies aimed at taking advantage of\npeer influence may not realize the desired effects [9,10].\nBuilding on the existing literature on peer effects we extend our\nanalysis by empirically quantifying the role of the peer social\nnetwork to explain marijuana usage (the most common type of\nillegal drug consumed) behavior among adolescents. Our peer\nmeasures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends,\nbut also from classmates within a grade. This allows us to identify\nthe differences in effects that could be exerted by different\ncompositions of reference groups. It is also important to note that\nour second reference group is not driven by selective peer sorting\n[5] and might be more relevant for policy purposes, since most\ninterventions (the DARE program for example) aimed towards\nreducing adolescent risky behaviors are implemented at the school\nlevel. Further we implement two stage least squares modeling\napproaches with school-level fixed effects to purge potential biases\nfrom the peer estimates in order to give it a causal interpretation.\nEstimating Social Networks\nA standard linear regression using an average contemporaneous\nmeasure by a reference group (for example, by the school level, by\nworkplace or by closest friends identified by the individuals) as a\nproxy for social interactions is easy to estimate. However, such\nmeasures of peer networks, or social interactions, have quite a few\nproblems of interpretation [13]. A significant effect of a peer\nindicator could be the consequence of three different interpreta-\ntions according to Manski (1993) [13]. While there may be subtle\ndifferences, defining effective policies would vary depending on\nwhich is the driving force behind the significant peer effect. The\nthree interpretations Manski (1993)[13] offers are as follows:\na. Endogenous effect. This effect occurs when individual\nbehavior responds to the behavior of others in their reference\ngroup. For example, an individual is more likely to use marijuana\nif there is a high rate of marijuana usage among the reference\ngroup because friends engagement in such activities could develop\na social norm which might compel an individual to use drugs in\norder to fit in with one's peer [14]. The influence is coming from\nthe peer behaviors themselves \u00ad and their behaviors influence each\nother. Targeting the individual to change the behavior would be\nan effective policy in this case \u00ad and would have a multiplier effect.\nSo even if only some of the individuals are part of the intervention\n\u00ad the influence would spread to their peers.\nb. Exogenous or Contextual effect. This occurs when\nindividual behavior responds to the exogenous characteristics of\nthe reference group. For example, suppose there is a high rate of\nsubstance abuse among the adult population in a community and\nthe dominating influence on peer drug use is parental substance\nabuse (other common parent factors may exist that drive substance\nabuse besides substance abuse but it is used as a key example).\nSpillover occurs even to the individuals whose parents don't abuse\nsubstance so that there is a peer effect on top of any parent effect.\nBut targeting only the adolescent will not get at the root of the\nproblem, nor will it have the multiplier effect discussed above since\nchildren of parents who abuse substance will continue to consume\nmarijuana despite the behavior of their peers.\nc. Correlated effect. This occurs when individuals in the\nsame group behave similarly because they have similar unobserved\ncharacteristics or they face similar institutional characteristics. For\nexample, children from like socioeconomic backgrounds will sort\nto each other and children with similar propensities to use drugs\nwill be more likely to abuse drugs because of those like attributes.\nAgain, if one of them stops using drugs because of an intervention,\nit is not likely to impact the others since something unobserved is\ndriving them all to have higher propensities of drug usage.\nIn sum, given these alternative interpretations of a significant\npeer effect, standard regressions of individual engagement in a\nparticular activity on group means are unable to distinguish\nbetween the endogenous, exogenous and correlated effects and\nsuccessful policy will vary depending on what is driving the peer\neffect. This identification difficulty, coined as the `reflection\nproblem' by Manski (1993)[13], occurs because group behavior\nby definition is the aggregation of individual behavior, i.e. group\nbehavior affects individual behavior and vice versa due to the\nsimultaneity in choices. Thus for the purpose of devising effective\npolicy it is important to purge these biases from peer effect\nestimates to identify whether peer influence is more important\nthan peer selection [15].\nIn this paper we are able to make progress in identifying the role\nof peer networks in drug use behavior on a couple of different\nfronts. First, we adopt a framework that models not only\nmarijuana use, but accounts for the reflection problem as well;\nnamely two stage least square regression with school level fixed\neffects, to deal with the potential bias from peer selection and\nomitted variables. Second, the compositions of our reference\ngroups are based on two distinct measures. One reference group\ncomes from the individual's nomination of their closest friends.\nAnother reference group consists of those who are in the same\nschool and grade as the respondents (grade-level peers henceforth).\nThese peer measures are not based on individuals' self-reports\nwhich are subject to potential biases [16] but are drawn from the\nresponses of the peers themselves. We hypothesize that the friends\nin the individual's closest social network (nominated) will exert a\nsimilar influence compared to the more exogenous grade-level\npeers, implying peer influence to be more important than peer\nselection.\nData\nWe utilize data from Wave I (1994) of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add\nHealth consists of data on adolescents in 132 schools nationwide\nbetween grades 7 to 12. This is a representative sample of U.S.\nschools with regard to region, urbanicity, school size, school type,\nand race/ethnicity. Parents were also interviewed in Wave I of the\ndata and this component of the survey is key in how we deal with\nthe problem of unobserved correlated variables that may bias the\nestimate of the peer effect. A primary advantage of the data set is\nthat Add Health asked respondents to nominate their five closest\nmale and five closest female friends and since a majority of these\nfriends were also part of the survey we were able to construct peer\nmeasures of marijuana use from the responses of the friends\nthemselves.\nThe average number of nominated friends per individual is 2.54\nand approximately 85% of the friends are from the same school as\nthe respondent. Thus, the sample of our analysis with nominated\npeers consists of 6,377 adolescents with at least one nominated\nfriend interviewed in Add Health. The sample size of our grade-\nlevel peer analysis consists of 19,335 individuals. Table 1 reports\ndescriptive statistics from the first wave of the data.\nMeasures of Adolescent Marijuana Use. The dependent\nvariable of our analysis is a dichotomous indicator of marijuana\nusage commonly used in the literature [5,11,17]. The respondents\nwere asked, ``During the last 30 days, how many times did you use\nmarijuana?'' For answering the drug use question, students\nlistened to tape-recorded question through earphones and\nentered their answers into a laptop [18]. The tape-recorded\nquestions were used in order to avoid interview or parental\nresponse bias, and the laptop to assure students of the\nconfidentiality of their answers. The participation indicator was\nset equal to 1 if the adolescent responded positively to this question\nand 0 otherwise.\nMeasures of Peer Marijuana Use. We constructed\ndifferent measures of peer drug use for each reference group.\nFor the nominated friends we created a variable pertaining to the\npercentage of friends who participated in marijuana use in the last\n30 days. The grade-level peer drug use measure was the\npercentage of students (excluding the respondent) in the\nrespondent's grade and school that participated in marijuana use\nin the last 30 days.\nThe Social Contagion Effect of Marijuana Use\nParental Measures and Demographics. The parent\nsurvey of Add Health allowed us to control for a number of\nparent characteristics including parent drinking, parent smoking,\nparent education, whether the adolescent lives with both biological\nparents and whether the family collects welfare benefits. In\naddition, parental measures such as whether the parents chose\ntheir residence because of the school district and how old the\nadolescent was when they first moved were also accounted for in\nthe analysis. Other controls we include are socio-demographic\nfactors like age, race/ethnicity gender, whether they consider\nreligion to be important and, if they have siblings. One of the risk\nfactors for the early onset of drug use is lack of a significant\nrelationship with parents or lack of mutual attachment [8,19]. To\naccount for such factor we also control for whether the adolescent\nis satisfied with the relationship he or she has with his or her\nmother and father. In addition, we also control for indicators of\naggressive behavior such as whether the adolescent acts loud,\nrowdy or unruly in public places and whether the adolescent got\ninto a serious physical fight in the last 12 months. The literature\nidentifies such aggressive behaviors to be highly correlated with\ninitiation of drug use [1,2].\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nWe are registered and approved users of the Add Health\ndataset. As a part of the process for acquiring the data we\nunderwent IRB review and received approval \u00ad both from Stony\nBrook University's Institutional Review Board (2005) and that of\nUniversity of Toledo (2007). We are in no way using human or\nanimal subjects directly. We have successfully completed our\ntraining on human subjects research review as well as HIPAA.\nEmpirical Model\nWe estimate a model of peer effects where marijuana usage\nbehavior by adolescent i at school s during time t, Yist\n(a\nparticipation indicator for marijuana use) is given by\nYist\nFist\nXist\nPist\nSist\nz eist\nwhere Fist\nrefers to our peer marijuana use measures, pertaining\neither to the adolescent's nomination of close friends or their\nclassmates. Xist\nis a vector of personal or demographic character-\nistics and Pist\nis a vector of parent and family characteristics. Sist\nis a\nvector of school dummy variables that control for unobserved\nschool type (school-level fixed effects) or confounding factors that\nare common to all individuals within the same school. For\nexample, this could include environmental factors such as lower\nopportunity costs of marijuana use related to easy availability or\nthe level of poverty in the individual's community [1,12].\nWe are primarily interested in the endogenous effect b1\n, which\nindicates the extent of peer influence on an individual's decision to\nconsume marijuana. If b1\nis estimated to be positive, then any\npolicy intervention that alters the marijuana usage behavior of the\nindividual within a reference group or social network would have\nan effect on non-treated adolescents' marijuana usage behavior\nthat are in the same social network [13]. As indicated before, the\nestimated coefficient of b1\nwould be biased if the correlated effects\nand the contextual effects are not controlled for. Estimating our\nmodels with Sist\n, the school-level fixed effects, potentially mitigates\nthe correlated effects. However, a two stage least square regression\nis also necessary in this empirical analysis because of the reflection\nproblem. The reflection problem, as discussed in Section 2, arises\nbecause peer behavior affects individual behavior and vice versa.\nare not\nidentified without utilizing instrumental variables or other similar\nmethodologies. This is because the fundamental assumption for\nconsistency of least-squares estimation to give b1\na causal\ninterpretation is violated. There is something in the error term,\ne, that is correlated with both F and Y so that E(e|F) ?0. The\ninstrumental variable estimator (IV) provides a consistent\nestimator under the assumption that the instruments (z) are\nvariables that are correlated with the regressor, F, that satisfy\nE(e|z) = 0 [20]. It is possible to obtain the instrumental variable\nestimator through the two stage least square (2SLS) method, which\nis just a two stage model that first deals with accurately capturing\nthe component of the peer variable we want (stage 1) and putting\nthat cleaned-up indicator of the peer variable into the drug usage\nregression (stage 2).\nKey to implementing the IV technique is finding instruments\nthat have two properties. First, they affect (cause variation in) the\nvariable whose effect we want to know about; in our case the peer\nmeasure. Second, these instruments must have no direct effect on\nthe outcome measure (Yist\nin eq 1) so they must be independent of\nthe latent factors that drive that outcome. For our instrument we\npropose four variables:- (i) the percentage of peers who are satisfied\nwith the relationship they have with their parents (ii) the\npercentage of peers who have easy access to alcohol at home,\n(iii) the percentage of peers who have easy access to cigarettes at\nhome and (iv) the percentage of peers who live with both biological\nparents. These peer level variables directly impact peer behavior\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics for wave I (1994).\nVariables N Mean SD\nDependent Variable\nPeer Measures\nDemographics\nParental Characteristics\nThe Social Contagion Effect of Marijuana Use\nbut do not predict individual behavior. The intuition behind the\ninstruments is that, while individuals who live with both biological\nparents are less likely to consume drugs, the proportion of the\nindividual's friends who lives with both biological parents will only\ndirectly affect the friend but not the individual. Similar intuition\napplies to the other instruments. Combined with the school-level\nfixed effects, the IV or 2SLS procedure will enable us to obtain\nconsistent peer effect estimates. We also undertake a test to verify\nthe validity of our instruments.\nResults\nWe begin by presenting OLS results for the effects of peer\nmarijuana use on individual marijuana use. Least-square estimates\nof coefficients in linear probability models are consistent estimates\nif standard errors are adjusted for the presence of heteroskedas-\nticity [21]. We report standard error estimates that are robust to\nany form of heteroskedasticity. Linear probability also converges\nto normal when samples are large [22]. Table 2 presents our OLS\nresults using Wave I (1994) data for the nominated and grade-level\npeers. For the purpose of completeness we provide estimates for all\nour control variables and discuss their effect on participation in\nmarijuana consumption.\nThe results indicate a positive and statistically significant effect\nof peer drug use behavior on individual behavior. We see that a\n10% increase in close friends using marijuana will increase the\nlikelihood of marijuana by more than 2% (coefficient = 0.279, p-\nvalue = 0.000) and a 10% increase in marijuana use among grade-\nlevel peers is associated with a 4.4% increase in individual\nsee that older adolescents, those who are at a higher grade, are\nmore likely to participate in marijuana use. However, we do not\nfind any significant race differences in using marijuana. Being\nreligious is inversely related to drug use. Among parent level\ncharacteristics, it is being satisfied with the relationship one has\nwith parents that has the greatest negative effect on participating\nin marijuana. In fact, with the exception of the peer effect, these\nindicators have the largest impact on adolescent participation in\nmarijuana use. Living in a two parent household also decreases the\nparticipation. Aggressive behaviors such as being rowdy in public\nplaces and getting into serious physical fights are also positively\ncorrelated with marijuana use. These demographic and parent\nlevel characteristics have an effect of similar magnitude across both\nmodel specifications, which is as expected.\nThese peer estimates however cannot be interpreted to signify\ncausality because of the reasons outlined in Section 2. Thus, we\npursue an IV estimation strategy to identify the causal effect of\npeer behavior on individual behavior. Our IV results are reported\nin Table 3 and since the other control variables exhibit similar\neffects we only report the coefficients of our main variable of\ninterest. We also implemented an over identification test, and\ncompute Hansen's J statistic [23], to check the validity of our\nTable 2. Determinants of marijuana use (OLS).\nVariables Nominated Peers Grade-Level Peers\nCoefficient Std. Error Coefficient Std. Error\nStandard errors in parentheses. Significance is defined as follows:\nThe Social Contagion Effect of Marijuana Use\ninstruments. This is a test of the joint null hypothesis that the\nexcluded instruments are valid instruments, i.e., uncorrelated with\nthe error term and correctly excluded from the estimated\nequation. The test fails to reject their validity, thus all five of the\ninstruments pass the test under all model specifications.\nFrom our results we see that the magnitude of the peer estimates\nare actually magnified under the IV specifications. This indicates\nthat after correcting for the reflection problem, peer effects\nbecome more important. This is consistent with the peer effects\nliterature utilizing similar methodologies [11]. However, these IV\nmodels were estimated without controls for school-level unobserv-\nable factors or environmental confounders (correlated effects) that\ncould simultaneously affect individual and peer outcomes, thus\nbiasing the estimated coefficients.\nOur IV estimation with school-level fixed effects shows\ncoefficients which are smaller in magnitudes. Peer participation\nin marijuana use continues to be statistically significant for both\nthe nominated and grade-level peers. This indicates that holding\neverything else constant, an increase in marijuana use among\nindividual's close friends by 10% will result in an increase in the\nlikelihood of individual marijuana use by approximately 5%\nThis result is consistent with our hypothesis that, after\naccounting for peer selection, environmental confounders and\nthe reflection problem, the role of social networks in influencing an\nindividuals' participation in drug use will continue to be\nstatistically significant. Our estimates also indicate that peer\ninfluence might be more important than peer selection. If peer\nselection was important, we would expect the effects for nominated\npeers to be less in magnitude or non-existent under the IV fixed\neffects specification. Since the grade-level peer measures are not\ndriven by selective peer sorting [5], the similarity in their\nmagnitudes with nominated friends under our preferred specifi-\ncation (IV with school-level fixed effects) signifies the importance\nof peer influence. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of friends\nslightly exceeds that of grade-level peers implying that friends are\npotentially more salient peer group than classmates. Other factors\nremain important with no statistically significant difference in\ninterpretations or relative importance.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we estimated models of adolescent marijuana\nusage to identify the role of social networks or peer groups on\npropensity to initiate marijuana intake. In particular, we used a\ntwo stage least squares with school-level fixed effects methodology\nto purge potential biases from the estimates of peer effects. Our\nestimation strategy allowed us to account for the contextual effects,\ncorrelated effects and the reflection problem, which are present in\nempirically measuring social influence.\nOur findings indicate that peer effects are important determi-\nnants of marijuana use and could be utilized as a potential policy\ntool to reduce drug consumption rates among adolescents.\nSpecifically, our results suggest that an increase in the proportion\nof close friends and classmates who uses marijuana by ten percent\nwill increase the likelihood of individual marijuana use by\napproximately five percentage points. These findings suggest that\npublic health interventions at the school level might be more cost-\neffective than previous estimates have suggested, since health\npromoting behavior in one person may spread to others. However,\nwe would like to caution the readers that our study, while\naddressing bi-directionality in peer influence, does not directly test\nfor symmetry in this behavior. Future studies should test for\nwhether an individual's reduction in substance abuse also spreads\nto his or her peers. We also found evidence to show that the\ninfluence of close friends and the more exogenous grade-level\npeers are quite similar in magnitude under our preferred\nspecification, supporting theory predicting the importance of peer\ninfluence [7,15]. Another significant finding was the importance of\ncontrolling for unobserved environmental confounders confirming\na correlation between those factors and the peer measures.\nEstimates without controlling for such environmental factors\nmostly resulted in larger estimated effects of peer influence.\nThis work not only lends further evidence in support of the\nexisting literature documenting the impact of peer effects on\nsubstance abuse, but also improves on the accuracy of the\nmagnitudes of estimated effects and expands how those effects vary\nacross different peer group compositions. Most of the previous\nstudies did not conduct their analysis based on different measures\nof the peer group, but have rather focused either on school and\ngrade level peers only [11] or on perceived peer measures\nnominated and grade level peers, they relied on lagged values of\npeer behavior to account for the reflection problem. However, this\ncould be problematic since it is not clear what the optimal lag\nperiod should be. Also compared to the previous studies our\nestimates appear to be conservative. This could primarily be due\nto the inclusion of school-level fixed effects in our two stage least\nsquares models. School-level fixed effects could be capturing\nenvironmental factors related to unobserved school environment\nsince adolescents' experiences at school exert some influence on\ntheir drug use [1]. Consistent with Fletcher et al. (2008)[1] this\nimplies that environmental interventions are warranted to curtail\nTable 3. Determinants of marijuana use (2SLS).\nVariables Nominated Peers Grade-Level Peers\nInstrumental Variable\nInstrumental Variable with\nSchool-Level Fixed Effects Instrumental Variable\nInstrumental Variable with\nSchool-Level Fixed Effects\nStandard errors in parentheses. Significance is defined as follows:\nThe Social Contagion Effect of Marijuana Use\nteenage drug use via fostering policies that facilitate school\nconnectedness, a feeling of involvement and inclusion, and better\nteacher-pupil relationship among others. Our results also indicate\nthat policy interventions at the school level might be more effective\nthan previously hypothesized since the existence of grade-level\npeer (classmates) influence may serve to amplify the effects of\ninterventions. Given the importance of parent attributes, school\nlevel interventions may not be sufficient. But the results suggest\nthere should be significant impact from well planned interventions\nat the school level. However, as stated before, the effectiveness of\nschool-based policies will depend on whether the reduction in\nhealth risky behavior will also spread to ones' peers and future\nresearch should aim to verify that.\nWhile we are able to address some of the issues surrounding the\nestimation of social networks, there are some limitations. First, as\nwith any empirical strategy used with observational data, our\ninstrumental variable strategy combined with the use of school-\nlevel fixed effects is subject to criticism and thus it is prudent to\nregard our results as demonstrating a strong association in the\ndrug use among peers rather than demonstrating a causal\nrelationship. If the future studies using alternative strategies\nsupport our findings, this may lead readers to infer causality.\nOur study only points in that direction given that the assumptions\nabout our instruments hold. Second, despite that we follow much\nof the literature in our measure of the dependent variable\n[5,7,8,11], it might be possible that the influence of peer network\nvaries with different measures of marijuana consumption. For\nexample, adolescents who use drugs more frequently could very\nwell be affected differently by peers compared to occasional drug\nusers. A possible extension of the study could be to look into how\npeer effects differ under various drug use intensities or frequencies.\nAnother area of interest would be to identify age groups that may\nbe at higher risk of peer influence that extends into adulthood.\n"
