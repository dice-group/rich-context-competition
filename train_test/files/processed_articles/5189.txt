    "abstract": "Abstract\nAgain and again scholars evoke a seriously dysfunctional relationship between management research and education on the\none hand, and the practice of management on the other. We share this viewpoint, and with this appraisal intend to (re-)\nopen the debate. We expose some views on the intellectual and sociological roots of the malaise, advocating a philosophical\nstance rooted in pragmatism and particularly in John Dewey's pragmatic stance. We outline a number of essentially workable,\nalbeit for debate's sake provocative and unpolished proposals for the redesign of academic institutions and of their publishing\nprocess. We sketch out radical redesign of academia--with, inter alia, (a) permeable academic and practical careers, so that\nexecutives and scholars could move between and act within each others' realities; (b) a focus of management education on\npost-experience graduate level; and (c) an academic publishing process worthy of the real-time era of the Internet.\n",

Table 1 sum-\nmarizes key critiques of academia and of the relevance gap\n(Starkey & Madan, 2001) between theory and practice.\nThese scholars defend diverse perspectives n terms of\nwhether this divide can be, or even should be overcome.\nSome posit that the generation of knowledge by academics\nand practitioners are separate missions and that purpose of\nresearch is essentially to develop theory and to univer-\nsally contribute to the understanding of phenomena\n(Jarzabkowski, Mohrman & Scherer 2010). Others do not\nreject practical relevance per se, but consider the scholar-\npractitioner divide as irreconcilable as these two communi-\nties develop and apply knowledge fundamentally differently\npertain to these \u00ad acknowledge and regret the separation\nbetween the scholar and practitioner communities, and the\nlack of practical relevance of academic inquiry and they\nsuggest diverse measures ad various levels of analysis by\nwhich to connect, to translate, and to co-construct knowl-\nedge that is both scientifically valid and practicable. This\narticle goes further, advocating that academics at least those\nthat are concerned with the practical impact of their inquiry\nshould in some way be able to become managers, while\nremaining scholars. And, why not, vice versa. This in turn\nrequires a radical redesign of academia--especially of its\nself-conception and the publishing process--and we sketch\nout one such redesign. Our views are rooted in pragmatism\nphilosophy of science that emphasizes the link between\naction and truth and argues that a good validation of for\nbelief is the willingness to act on it. Pragmatism a priori\nsituates research and learning evolutionarily within the pro-\ncess of living, in the shape of an intelligent adaptation of\nthe species to its environment. The theory of cognition of\nthe Cartesian subject\u00adobject differentiation is undermined\nin pragmatism by a theory of action, in which the object and\nthe subject reciprocally constitute themselves. One could\nsay that inquiry, with truth rather than knowledge, is the\nessence of logic here. Dewey (1926) proposed activity-\nbased learning rather than a traditional teacher-dominated\napproach, because learning was \"an affair of the intercourse\nof a living being with its physical and social environment\"\nOur academic system has grown in reverse order. Subjects and\nteachers constitute the starting point, [learners] are secondary. In\nconventional education the [learner] is required to adjust himself\nto an established curriculum . . . Too much of learning consists\nof vicarious substitutions of someone else's experience and\nknowledge. Psychology teaches us that we learn what we do . . .\nExperience is the adult learner's living textbook. (p. 4)\nToday, a hundred years after Dewey (1904) first expressed\na fundamental tension in the \"proper relationship\" between\nthe theory and practice in inquiry, much formal education\nand inquiry continue to suffocate naturally inquisitive minds\nby controlling and isolating the environment of inquiry.\nWhy this isolation? Why do we, for example, know so little\nabout top executives, especially unsuccessful ones? A query\nyielded some possible explanations:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Top executives are difficult to reach. Their availability\nfor research on specific management topics of their\nconcern is already limited, their availability for\nresearch on their selves is close to none. Unsuccessful\nleaders are even more difficult to persuade to speak\nabout their experiences.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Academics are under constant pressure to publish. It\nis easier and faster to build on work from existing\nresearch.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Situations and contexts in which executives perform\ntheir work are so diverse and complex, and fast-\nchanging, that it seems difficult to establish data that\npermit valid conclusions, generalization, or theory\nbuilding.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Scholars prefer to focus on the successful aspects of\nbusiness, hoping to materialize their findings in a\nblockbuster management book.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Most management scholars have little access to the\npractical business world, and some are not really\ninterested to meet practitioners. Most CEOs have little\ntheoretical experience or interest. The dialogue seems\ndifficult; worlds of practice and theory seem to remain\nseparate.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 When scholars do have access to the practical busi-\nness world, for example, as business consultants, they\nare sometimes reluctant to bite the hand that feeds\nthem.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Academic research is increasingly privately financed\nand some scholars might not wish to disgruntle a most\nwelcome source of income. To remain independent,\nthey prefer to address more uncompromising topics.\nUnrepresentative and speculative as these explanations\nmay be, they reflect a defeatism or even autism not unfa-\nmiliar to the ear of scholars throughout Western academic\ncultures. Some might be tempted to use \"put your money\nwhere your mouth is\" as a catchphrase to characterize\npragmatism--if it were not that, one of the masters himself\nprovides us with more colorful \"truth's cash value\" (James,\nPragmatists consider confrontation with reality through\naction as the principal source of doubt, which in turn feeds\nscientific curiosity and becomes the driving force to inquire\nto settle that doubt, and make way for new doubt.1 Thus,\naction and the interrogations stemming from it--and the\ndesire to find answers--are what drive the agenda of science\n(Peirce, 1992), and what drives many scientists to become\nTable 1.

(continued)\npractitioners. This, to them is what Ackoff calls a \"meta-\nideal,\" where ends and means converge and become the\nsame: \"One can desire nothing without desiring the ability to\nsatisfy it. The ability to satisfy all desires is an ideal neces-\nsarily shared by all men at all times\" (Gharajedaghi, 1983,\nWe argue that many of the challenges concerning the\nrigor-relevance dichotomy that scholars face can be over-\ncome, or attenuated by reverting to Pragmatism, especially\nJohn Dewey's Pragmatism. Dewey's ontology and episte-\nmology on theory, on knowledge and on action, and on the\nrelationship between them, gives us important clues on how\nwe could shape our inquiry to be both scientifically sound\nand matter to the practitioner. Jarzabkowski et al (2010) situ-\nate the problem as being philosophical, theoretical and\nempirical. A rigor-driven stance essentially strives to rely on\na stable, objective world, on universal principles and on\nknowledge that objectively represents the world \"out there\".\nThe world presents itself before us, waiting to be discovered,\nmeasured, explored and conceptualized. Concepts are\nexpected to be impartial and universally applicable across\ndiverse realities. In this logic, action succeeds precise, exact\nmanagement knowledge (Jarzabkowski et al 2010).\nOn the other hand, a stance tending toward relevance sees\nreality as a phenomenological \"life world\" (Husserl 1970)\nhighly contingent and fortuitous, and fairly skeptical of all\ntheorizing demeanors. Knowledge is local, intrinsic, contin-\ngency and context-reliant. The researcher and the research\nare inseparable. Knowledge results from action, which is\nsought to be directly practicable. These two logics appear\nirreconcilable at first sight. However, through John Dewey's\npragmatic epistemology a third way, or rather a reconcilia-\ntion appears to be possible. In Pragmatism, there is indeed a\nworld \"out there\", but it has sense and meaning only in rela-\ntion to man. Likewise, theory is omnipresent, but not as\nabsolute and universal laws, but rather as explanations of\nphenomena and their relationships. Dewey introduced the\n\"warranted assertion\" as research product. This assertion has\na generalized role and a particular one as well. Warranted\nassertions merge truth and inquiry together in such a way that\ncorrespondence to an external world is no longer the princi-\npal point. Instead, interdependency of truths and the pro-\ncesses of inquiry are just as central. The momentary\nsatisfaction of a solved problem in a world that is not set\napart from the knower's uses of or places in that world. This\nis different from both idealists' and realists' description of of\nepistemology as way of determining knowledge. It is not \u00ab\nknowledge\" that represents the focal point of epistemology\nfor Dewey, but rather \"knowing\". \"Knowledge\" represents\nthe end of inquiry but for Dewey it is more, it has meaning of\nits own, disconnected from the inquiry. So much so, that\ninquiry is subordinated to the final result called \"knowl-\nedge.\" With \"knowing\" on the other hand, Dewey defines\ninquiry in a world that is not static. He means inquiry\ninto things that humans live, experience. He means\nexperimenting with problem solving in such a way as for the\naction to be entailed in the solving of problems, which is\ninquiry itself, and warranted in the assertions made about the\nsolved problem when it is solved, \u00ab solved \u00bb being nothing\nmor than the door to another inquiry and so on. Accordingly,\nin the \"living\" of life, problems will be faced and solved--\noften in serendipitous ways--such that achieving \"justified\ntrue belief\" (as traditional epistemology expects) is not use-\nful. As Dewey put it: \"[Warranted assertion] is preferred to\nthe terms belief and knowledge [because] it is free from the\nambiguity of these latter terms, and it involves reference to\ninquiry as that which warrants assertion. When knowledge is\ntaken as a general abstract term related to inquiry in the\nabstract, it means \"warranted assertibility.\" The use of a term\nthat designates potentiality rather than an actuality involves\nrecognition that all special conclusions of special inquiries\nare parts of enterprise that is continually renewed, or is a\nClearly, the outcome of such inquiry goes beyond \"rigor\"\nin terms of precise and exact knowledge to be applied across\ndiverse settings and situations, and also beyond \"relevance\",\nas a solution to an immediate practical problem. Rather this\nnotion of knowledge is \"useful\" in every sense of the term,\nbe it epistemological (is this credible, well-founded and\ntrustworthy?) but also normative (does this help us advance\nin our preoccupations?). It does not put action and knowl-\nedge into a preset sequence. Dualism is not inevitable nor is\nit a compulsory starting point of all philosophical thought:\n\"What have been completely divided in philosophical dis-\ncourse into man and world, inner and outer, self and not-self,\nsubject and object, individual and social, private and public,\netc. are in actuality life transactions. (Dewey & Bentley\n1949\". Dewey talks of knowledge and action, rather than\nrigor and relevance, and did not specify that one necessarily\nprecedes the other, but considered them rather as iterative, as\nintertwined, as a permanent conversation.\nReflection is important in inquiry, but its value can be best\nassessed if it is put into practice, hence his focus on the\nnotion of \"usefulness\" and purported to move away from\n\"knowing as an aesthetic enjoyment of the properties of\nnature as a world of divine art, to knowing as a means of\nsecular control \u00ad this is a method of purposefully introducing\nchanges which will alter the direction of the course of events\nFrom these approaches \u00ad that transcend ontological fun-\ndamentalism and inane debates on whether action precedes\nknowledge or knowledge precedes action \u00ad we construe ele-\nments of academic redesign and a portfolio of research\nbehaviors that satisfy academic rigor and have a potential for\nrelevance and practicability.\nGetting One's Feet Wet\nTo many academics, a (re-)turn to practice means getting\nclose to where the action is, and generating theoretical\n6 SAGE Open\ncontributions grounded in observation of actual managerial\npractices, rather than based on aprioristic notions (see, for\nexample, the collection of papers edited by Schatzki, Knorr-\nCetina, & von Savigny, 2001). These approaches frequently\nrely on some variant of the participation-observation method\nThis method is directly descendant from John Dewey's. The\nresearcher somehow participates alongside managers in their\nwork, and observes what they do. Care is taken through a\nvariety of stratagems to minimize the well-known disruptive\neffect of participation. But there are limits to what can be\ndone: A couple engaged in an intimate act is likely to not\nbehave as usual if there is a third party present as an observer,\nlet alone as a participant. Candid cameras and hidden mikes\nare either unknown to the subjects, and therefore unethical,\nor known and producing disruptive effects akin to direct\nobservation. In sum, managers are reluctant to tolerate a\nredundant researcher in tow and there is no extra seat on the\ncorporate jet--but, they often appreciate a second opinion or\neven a helping hand.\nThis is well understood by constructionist scholars advo-\ncating such research methods as narrative interviewing or\nethnography in which the researcher's footprint is not only\nacknowledged but also sought. Such narratives\npresent the doing of the field work, rather than simply the doer\nor the done . . . [and they are meant to be understood as]\nrepresentational means of cracking open the culture and the field\nworker's way of knowing it, so that both can be jointly examined.\nThe benefits of this inevitable interference by the\nresearcher are equally well understood and, more so, sought\nby academics that can be classified as \"action researchers\"\nadvocate in one way or another getting involved with manag-\ners in solving their problems--becoming part of the system--\nand learning from their experience as well, not just that of\nothers. The action learner combines individual and organiza-\ntional change of practical knowledge by getting involved in\neveryday organizational challenges (Brooks, 2004; Dick,\nlearning (Yorks & Marsick, 2002): scientific, experiential,\nand critical reflection (Marsick, 1988; O'Neil & Marsick,\n\"action\" is no more and no less than the starting point of any\ninquiry (Marsick & O'Neil, 1999): Actors critically reflect on\nexperience with the support of others. This reflection--\ndoubt--is followed by further action, which represents\nchange, rather than simply repetition of patterns. Although\nguided by strategic intent, the outcome is purposely not fully\ncontrolled because the status quo is challenged and the\nresearcher and/or learner are actors in the change process.\nThe action researcher, similarly, has a double agenda:\nthat of a consultant or hired hand who works for the man-\nager, and that of a researcher who seeks to further\ntheoretical understanding. The client-manager is not involv-\ned with the second agenda, and hopefully gets to see the\nresearcher as a valuable resource, maybe even find a seat on\nthe corporate jet. The ability to simultaneously help solve\ndifficult business problems, conceptualize actions and\nreflections into theories and models, and thus develop peo-\nple and organizations combine to form the attractiveness of\nthe action researcher (Argyris, Putnam, & Smith, 1985). In\na time of rising complexity, characterized by alternative\nexplanations and multiple ways of perceiving and explain-\ning, and in a business context where blueprint answers no\nlonger suffice, the idea of connecting researchers and actors\nto solve these very real problems is enticing (a seminal\nexample of such a rich research endeavor is Watson, 1994).\nThe researcher gains much greater insights, while such\ninsights may be less structured, less systematic, and not nec-\nessarily well documented.\nDonald Sch\u00f6n (1987) described the way in which practi-\ntioners (engineers, doctors, architects, managers) work, pro-\nceeding on intuition (tacit knowledge), seldom explicitly\nstating their assumptions and theories until they run into\nunexpected trouble or some situation that arises their doubt.\nIt is then that they reflect upon and improve their models,\nbecoming \"reflective practitioners.\" This suggests that sim-\nple observation of practitioners during the times of routine or\ntacit activities will not reveal much, unless, of course, one\nassumes that the observer is a lot more knowledgeable and\nastute than the manager, and has figured out explicit theories\nand models long before the manager had. This works for\nobserving young children, perhaps primitive tribes, but is not\nvery promising when dealing with cutting-edge management\npractitioners. The researcher to truly understand managers\nwould probably have to become one, at least temporarily or\non a part-time basis.\nMa Academia Is a Hard Nut to Crack\nWhile a handful of business schools thrive on close practice\ncontact, most of academia today is not at the leading edge of\nmanagement practices (Kumar, Scheer, & Kotler, 2000).\nMost management innovation happens in corporations, con-\nsulting, and other professional services companies, and the\nword is then spread by gurus, rather than academics\n(Huczynski, 1996). Academia is more often than not rele-\ngated to studying innovations introduced by others, and\nreporting on them with mind-numbing delays due to the\nmercilessly lengthy publishing process. Many innovations\nanalyzed by academics are long forgotten by practitioners,\nor substantially modified, by the time they get reported.\nDespite the ritualistic lip service paid to \"accelerating rate\nof change and explosion of knowledge generation,\" many\nacademic journals resemble historical archives of manage-\nment ideas. In the 19th century, a fellow living in the\nAustralian outback could hope to read a London newspaper\ndescribing an occurrence in his neighborhood in less than a\nyear after the event--a few months for the news to get to\nLondon, 24 hr to print it, and another few months for the\nnewspaper to reach the reader. This is the speed of light\ncompared with the academic publishing process. The mate-\nrial transmitted to students, via textbooks and cases, is not\nmuch more up to date, and misconceptions or errors are\npropagated from one generation to another, because aca-\ndemics have so little chance to confront them with reality\n(see, for example, Dunning, 2006, for a critique of textbooks\non intercultural management; and Holden, 2002, for a cri-\ntique of a prioris in intercultural management research). We\nagree with Blau (1994), when he claims that \" bureaucratic\nfeatures of academic institutions have deleterious conse-\nquences for educational performance\" (p. 279), but in the\nlight of academic publishing processes of sometimes several\nyears, we cannot but disagree with his statement that\nresearch is not concerned, because \"research can be sepa-\nrated from an institution's administrative machinery while\neducation is intricately enmeshed in it\" (p. 280).\nOn July 6, 2006 in Bergen, in a keynote address to a thou-\nsand organizational scientists assembled for the annual\nEuropean Group for Organizational Studies (EGOS)\nColloquium, James March observed that the agenda of orga-\nnizational research is seldom driven by a demand from man-\nagers \"out there in the real world,\" but rather by the\nspectacular growth of management teaching that creates the\nneed for professors that in turn need to publish. A look at the\nmany business school strategy documents that are published\non the Internet shows that while they pay lip service to \"con-\ntributing to societal knowledge about management,\" they\nview the primary role of research as supporting development\nof faculty, not as a service to broader society. Academia\nremains the proverbial ivory tower, and isolates itself by a\nmyriad of elaborate, frequently ornamental and usually ossi-\nfied values, organizational rituals, procedures, and routines\nthat penalize a true dialogue with real management.\nInterestingly, March's (2008) malaise is not a lack of rele-\nvance but a lack of essence, as becomes evident from his\nintervention at the 2008 Academy of Management (AOM)\nMeeting: \"not `essential' in the sense of being necessary to\nachieve some desired end, `essential' in the sense of being a\nnecessary property, without which something is not what it\nclaims to be.\" This is an intriguing and gripping standpoint\nthat merits an inquiry of its own elsewhere.\nThe related concepts and other recent endeavors to reduce\nthe relevance gap, such as engaged scholarship (Van de Ven\n& Johnson, 2006), collaborative research (Shani, Mohrman,\nPasmore, Stymne, & Adler, 2008), and design research, are\nwelcome developments. But they remain for now anecdotal\nand academia by and large a closed system. Like all closed\nsystems, it elaborates myths about itself. The ones we like\nmost are the long catalogs of knowledge and skills that are\ndeemed essential for managers. The lists vary from one\ninstitution to another, and probably by pure coincidence\noften reflect the relative power positions of various depart-\nments and important professors. But it is always too long,\nand consumes all the time available to students. Of course,\nthe overwhelming majority of managers practicing in\nthe world today have no formal business education at all.\nSome of them fail these requirements as miserably as pos-\nsible--not knowing about them at all--and yet they thrive\nin their business environment. Think of the fellow who sold\nyou a trinket at the bazaar in Marrakech. By contrast, the\nyoung graduates of business schools are all but managers.\nTheir heads are stuffed (or not) with lots of knowledge, but\nthey know little about working with unstructured situations\nsuch as those encountered by managers. In an ultimate per-\nversion of the system, the best among them may have been\nselected by professors for cloning, and trained to become\nfuture professors, not managers.\nGetting One's Hands Dirty\nBusiness schools aspire to educating managers, or, more\nambitiously yet, leaders; but the job they do reasonably well\nis educating technical professionals who are needed by busi-\nnesses in great numbers: accountants, financial analysts,\nmarket researchers, logistics dispatchers, database adminis-\ntrators, and so on. In that, the business school is not that dif-\nferent from an engineering school.With time, many graduates\nend up working as managers, but engineers harbor no illu-\nsions about having been trained to do so, whereas business\nschool graduates do. We do not object to getting hold of\nsome very young people, teaching them actuarial techniques\nover 2 or 3 years, and sending them off to the insurance\nindustry. We also agree that, as in the case of engineering\nstudents, it is good to provide these young people with a\nsmothering of general business notions, with courses address-\ning such issues as \"working with humans,\" \"working with\nhumans of different colors that eat stinking food,\" and\n\"working for inhumans that are obsessed about keeping to a\nbudget,\" sensitizing them to the environment in which they\nwill operate. But perhaps we should moderate our pretense\nof certifying as managers let alone leaders 22-year-olds by\nthe hundreds of thousands unless we want their rank and file\nend up read such books as \"how to work for an idiot\"\nWe advocate, with Mintzberg (2004), that there be no\nundergraduate management education. We argue a bit\ncrudely that if it were a good idea to teach sex to toddlers,\nthen so would teaching management to 18-year-olds. Their\neducation could be left to traditional disciplines like mathe-\nmatics or history, even economics, and a lot of hands on\nentrepreneurship. And, why not, philosophy--and profes-\nsional certification as discussed above. What we consider\nessential is that undergraduates not only learn the requisite\nbody of knowledge but also--and beforehand--learn to\nlearn, that is, reflect on knowledge, question it, learn to find\nsources of knowledge that is new to them, and autonomously\n8 SAGE Open\nchoose to acquire it or not. We argue that the acquisition of a\nrequisite body of management knowledge prior to the acqui-\nsition of the competency of learning to learn and of critical\naction learning (as described above) may be one cause of\ndecreasing entrepreneurship and rampant managerialism.2\nThis requirement has profound implications for the teaching\nprocess, especially in some European countries, and many\nemerging ones as well, where, as stated above, over one cen-\ntury after Dewey's plea that learning be rooted in action, the\ntradition of spoon-feeding students is still going strong and\nlittle attention is paid to developing their reflective\nautonomy. The \"proper relationship\" between theory and\npractice seems not yet found.\nSo, perhaps management education ought to be restricted\nto graduate level, requiring students to have had some man-\nagement experience before engaging in it. To stay with our\nprior metaphor, this is like having sex before studying some\nenhanced techniques on the subject matter. Teaching people\nwho have experienced the thing is vastly different than trying\nto convey some theoretical abstractions (here we speak from\nour experience as managers and management educators\nonly). This is easier said than done: Despite some efforts in\nTable 2. Some Pragmatic Suggestions of Management Research Redesign.\nCritique Suggestion(s)\nDysfunctional relationship between management research and the practice of management, namely,\n1. Management professors are often quite far away from\npractice and unfamiliar with, sometimes uninterested in, the\nmanagement realities\n1.1 Academia and praxis follow two different types of logic and\nproduce two different types of knowledge, and both are nec-\nessary.To be both rigorous and relevant, a researcher might\nwant to discover both\n 1.2 Management professors might be advised to adopt a stance\nrooted in pragmatism, that is, confront themselves and their\ncertitudes with reality, reality being the principal source of\ndoubt, which is the driving force for inquiry\n 1.3 Professors of management should also be--or have been and\nbe again--managers, just like professors of medicine are also\nmedical doctors\n 1.4 Accept the complexity and speed of cutting-edge manage-\nment in a globalizing world and invite these multiple realities\ninto the classroom--and bring the classroom to them--\nrather than covering anachronistic canons of seemingly\nessential knowledge skills for managers\n 1.5 Management development practice, institutions, and compa-\nnies would benefit from developing systems that allowed for\na lifelong easy to and fro between academia and practice\n2. Management needs to be learned not taught, management\neducation must be rooted in action\n2.1 Management education should begin at post-experience\ngraduate level, that is, at a time when it can be reasonably\nexpected to be understood and useful\n3. Management research should focus less on linear regression\nand more on qualitative, interpretive, single-case research,\nand especially, rediscover action and collaborative research\n3.1 Management researchers should embrace the subjectivity of\nmost types of management research (usually relying on some\nform of participant observation method), and develop new\nand appropriate validity and reliability criteria that ensure sci-\nentific rigor in new ways\n 3.2 Management scholars should understand and exploit the\nbenefits of this researcher interference (as in action learning/\naction research, engaged scholarship, collaborative research,\ndesign research,etc.) as a source of organizational change and\ninnovation as well as of management development\n 3.3 Theoretical integration between academia and practice can be\nachieved with action research and design-driven approaches\n4. Innovation of management practices is happening, but mostly\nin practice, not in academia. Academia is often lagging behind\n4.1 Speed up and simplify the academic publishing process to\nbring it closer to reality\n 4.2 Exploit the \"mass-customization\" potential of Internet to\naccelerate, generalize, and/or specialize research publication\nand, especially, to accelerate and intensify debate and knowl-\nedge exchange\n 4.3 Drop some anachronistic publishing guidelines that date from\nthe days of the typewriters and enter the real-time era of\nInternet\nrecent years, the attitudes in many European workplaces and\nthe continuing inflexibility of labor markets make it still dif-\nficult for young people to move back and forth between work\nand study. A thorough reform of business education may not\nbe possible without a redesign of labor practices.\nIdeally, the bulk of management education would happen\nin parallel with work, the two intertwined and feeding each\nother. In other words, we aspire to abolishing the distinction\nbetween full-time and part-time education. The idea is to\nteach Kamasutra in practice sessions, not with blackboard\nand chalk, not even with an animated PowerPoint. All types\nof work-study schemes exist already and professors gener-\nally are impressed with how much better students do in those\nsituations. And that is without professors changing much to\nwho they are, nor to what they do. Working students do bet-\nter in conventional knowledge-transmission courses taught\nin majority by professors with no business experience.\nImagine what could be accomplished if one changed the pro-\nfessors and what they did!\nThis is what makes us argue that perhaps management\nprofessors might more often be practitioners, just as medical\nprofessors are. Mind you that there would be far fewer of\nthem if, as we suggested, management education separated\nfrom entrepreneurship and education for business-related\nprofessions. There are several ways in which professors can\nalso be practitioners--and in many cases are today: they can\nwork in two places on a part-time basis, they can switch\nback and forth during their careers, and they can be consul-\ntants. One can even imagine some sort of conglomeration\nbetween business schools and companies that would make\nthe moving back-and-forth easier. To be a professor, one\nwould have to be academically qualified, which usually\nmeans holding a doctoral degree. Professors would be \"very\nreflective practitioners\" to build on the term used by Sch\u00f6n\n(1987), and engage in furthering the practice and publishing\nabout it. Ideally, some practitioners would also move\nbetween worlds, which would require such worlds to be\nredesigned as well. This might not be for tomorrow, and\nmeanwhile we suggest increased use of collaborative\nresearch and engaged scholarship, with information collec-\ntion, analysis discussion, and/or conclusion perfectly shared\namong academics and practitioners. These practices permit\nto change roles, to look upon strategy and management\nthrough diverse prisms, and thereby advance in understand-\ning and designing effective and sustainable management,\nstrategy, and entrepreneurship.\nLast but not least, we argue that publishing should change\ndramatically. We propose to distinguish between at least two\nroles played by academic journals. They publish and dis-\nseminate information, producing (for now) physical volumes\nand delivering them to subscribers and libraries, and thus\nassuring perennial access. And they organize an editorial\nprocess, giving--at least in theory--some intellectual coher-\nence to the collections of papers, screening for quality,\nassisting authors in improving their presentation, and pro-\nmoting readership and \"citationship\" of their journals.\nIf contemplated unemotionally, it seems clear that the first\nrole, that of physical production, dissemination, and storage,\nis vastly obsolete in the era of Internet. This does not mean\nthat coherent periodical volumes should not be published.\nThere arguably can be some value in presenting a collection\nof papers together. And their publication on fixed dates\nallows some readers to absorb novelty in chunks rather as a\ncontinuous stream, and some authors to accelerate their final\ntouches and get their study out, both of which may be helpful\nin organizing their respective working lives. But a publica-\ntion via Internet would do just fine.\nThus, journals would be reduced to their essence: a group\nof like-minded academics who come together as an editorial\nboard to provide guidance and a stamp of approval to what is\nbeing put out there for public consumption. This opens the\npossibility for many more different kinds of journals or spe-\ncial volumes, with a variety of editorial policies and philoso-\nphies. For example, for the run-of-the-mill academic paper\nthat is not related to any other articles appearing in the same\nissue, one could envision as self-editing journal: A paper is\naccepted if it is accompanied by statements from three bona\nfide academics, each from a different institution, or even\nfrom a different country, that clearly indicate why they think\nthe article is worth publishing. These statements would be\npublished along with the article, putting thus online the repu-\ntation of the reviewers. One could also require a statement\nfrom the home institution of the author that the paper was\nprofessionally edited for English, proper references, and so\non.\nOnce we accept that the Internet is the publishing medium,\nthere is a host of other suggestions that come to mind: accom-\npany each article with a website, including a forum for public\nexchange of comments; and work in progress on a blog and/\nor other forms of knowledge sharing, such as, perhaps,\nWikipedia-type communities of research practices. The\nJournal board could moderate such forums, or delegate that\nresponsibility to one of the reviewers. The website could also\ninclude additional information for the very motivated reader,\nincluding some of the original data based on which the arti-\ncle is written, increasing thus the transparency and the pro-\nbity of the research process. Also foreseeable--and probably\ninevitable--are unmonitored, Wiki-type communities-of-\npractice/research on a selection of subjects.\nAnd this would be a great opportunity to going back to a\nmore intelligible way of presenting articles. We love foot-\nnotes!!! They let one write sentences that flow without inter-\nrupting them with long parentheses with a bunch of names\nand dates. Most people are not interested, and those who are\ncan look at the footnotes. Footnotes also allow the writer to\nmake disclaimers or some parenthetical points without sacri-\nficing readability of the text or its length. Footnotes were\nbanned at the time when technology did not place them\nautomatically and typesetting labor became very expensive.\nThose times are gone! Forever, we venture to think. And\nwhile we are at it: Why still submit papers in double-spaced\nformat with \"insert figure about here\" tags? Reviewing such\npapers is a pain. Again, adapt to the technology!\nAuthors may take advantage of their sense of humor, if\nthey are lucky to have one. They do as public speakers or\nas lecturers. One can do serious business and have fun\ndoing it. Authors should every now and then have the guts\nto advance their convictions and stop being so tentative in\nthe name of academic rigor. If one thinks that one's\nthoughts seem like they might possibly lead to a potential\nand gradual shift of certain limited areas of thought, then\none should keep that thought to oneself, and keep on think-\ning. Objectivity does not repose on the lone shoulders of\neach author. It results from interplay and dialogue (see\nSachs, 2003, on this point). If one is wrong, there sure is\nsomeone out there to point this out. If somebody bothered\nto answer, then the article did stimulate somebody some-\nwhere--and did its job.\nSummary and Conclusion\nWe have evoked the pervasive dysfunctional relationship\nbetween management research and education on the one\nhand, and the practice of management on the other. We\nexposed some views on the intellectual and sociological\nroots of the malaise and advocate a philosophical stance\nrooted in Pragmatism and particularly in John Dewey's\npragmatic stance. We explain how Dewey's Pragmatism \u00ad\nparticularly his understanding of action, his notion of use-\nfulness and his experimentalism can help us to unmask the\napparent dichotomy between rigor and relevance and come\nup with a scientifically sound and yet practicable research\nbehavior. Based on this, we outline a number of essentially\nworkable, albeit for debate's sake provocative proposals for\nthe redesign of academic institutions and of their publishing\nprocess. We sketch out a radical redesign of academia \u00ad\nwith, inter alia, a) permeable academic and practical careers,\nso that executives and scholars could move between and act\nwithin each others' realities b) a focus of management edu-\ncation on post-experience graduate level, and c) an aca-\ndemic publishing process worthy of the real-time era of the\nInternet.\nSummarizing is not necessary if an argumentation is short\nand clear. And not all conversations lead to a conclusion.\nStill, Table 2 is provided that summarizes our proposals,\nwhich we do by no means consider conclusive but rather an\ninvitation to debate.\nAuthor's Note\nThis is an opinion paper based on the stance that objectivity does\nnot repose on the lone shoulders of each academic author but can--\nand does--emerge from interplay and dialogue. If one is wrong,\nthere surely is someone out there to point this out. If somebody\nbothers to answer, then this article did stimulate, and permit\nadvancement--and therefore served its most noble purpose.\n"
