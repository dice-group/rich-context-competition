This is the case despite the news organisa-\ntion's commitment to representing a broader range of opinion.\nThe article explores (a) the relationship between the dominance of elite sources and\n(b) a narrowing range of views and information on contentious issues and (c) an over-\nrepresentation of Conservative voices. Our findings point to (d) the difficulties of mov-\ning beyond impartiality-as-balance in the context of a politically exposed public service\nbroadcaster. This is demonstrated through an examination of sourcing patterns in BBC\ncoverage of three complex and contentious issues \u00ad immigration, religion and Britain's\nrelationship to Europe.\nWe use the idea of a paradigm here in the sense developed by Kuhn (1962) and adapted\nby journalism scholars. Kuhn (1970: 42) introduced the concept of the paradigm in his\nwork on the structure of scientific revolutions. He traced the patterns of practice and\nenquiry through which scientific communities define themselves and perpetuate their\nexistence and their approach to major problems. This includes a set of shared preconcep-\ntions that underpin and shape the collection of empirical evidence, coalescing into patterns\nor models which overdetermine certain modes of inquiry, while excluding others. Here, we\nuse the idea of the paradigm as it has been deployed by journalism scholars; as a model:\n[That] guides those engaged in complex information-producing tasks; it focuses attention on\nsome problems and necessarily excludes others that cannot be as easily stated using the tools\nsupplied by the paradigm. To make sense of the world, journalists, like scientists, rely on a\nparadigm, which remains of value so long as it provides a useful practical guide for them and\nIn journalism studies, the concept has been primarily deployed to describe the adherence\nof professional cultures to the `paradigm of objectivity' (e.g. Berkowitz, 2000; Hackett,\n1984; Mindich, 2000) although some have also used it to describe `challenger paradigms'\nsuch as alternative or deliberative models of journalism (Hackett, 2011; Robie, 2013). The\nterm is helpful in emphasising the discursively constituted presumptions that shape practice\nwithin professional communities (see Vogel, 2009). In the case of journalism, paradigms are\nmade and maintained through the discursive practice of journalists as they go about their\nreporting and story-telling, organisational rituals and routines (e.g. Tuchman, 1972), as well\nas in discussions the profession has about itself. Through such practices, discourses and\ninstitutions, journalistic paradigms are contested, defended and repaired, highlighting the\nrole of journalism as an essentially defensive profession that constantly justifies its authority\nin constructing our collective truths (e.g. Carlson and Lewis, 2015). David Mindich (2000:\n7) discussed the idea of balance as a paradigm for objective journalism. He cited the `see-\nsaw' metaphor for journalism as having shaped journalism practice throughout the 20th\ncentury, with frequent references to covering `both sides'of an issue in discussions of objec-\ntivity and impartiality. This metaphor of the seesaw is also, as we shall see, explicitly used\nin the BBC's own critical engagement with impartiality.\nTheorising impartiality and balance\nThe idea of impartiality is central to the tenets of public service broadcasters around the\nworld (e.g. Flood et al., 2011) and has been particularly important to the BBC. It is writ-\nten into the Royal Charter which governs the BBC and guarantees its independence (e.g.\nStarkey, 2007: xix). According to Helen Boaden (2010), the former director of BBC\nnews, and current director of BBC radio, `impartiality is in our DNA \u00ad it's part of the\nBBC's genetic make-up'. Impartiality has been taken to mean that coverage should be\nunbiased, balanced, objective, open-minded and avoid favouring one side over another\n(Cushion, 2011: 33). While impartiality is related to the professional practices and ideals\nof balance and objectivity, it is also a distinct concept:\n[Impartiality] is to be distinguished from balance (the allocation of equal space to opposing\nviews) and objectivity (by which journalists usually mean an effort to exclude subjective\njudgement). Impartiality involves no more than the attempt to regard different ideas, opinions,\nEnsuring impartiality, then, ideally entails the provision of a broad view of the range\nand weight of opinion on a particular topic. It means that journalists play an active role in\nconstructing the narrative surrounding the range of opinion on a particular topic, as they\nseek to reflect the diversity of the public(s) they represent, while at the same time attempt-\ning to `bind the nation and nurture a collective climate of rational opinion formation'\n(Hendy, 2013: 38). Reporters who aim to be impartial should `take account of (i) a full\nrange of views and opinions; (ii) the relative weight of opinion...; and (iii) changes that\noccur in the range and weight of opinion over time' (Hartley, 1992: 145). This definition\ndemonstrates that an impartial approach requires a complex set of professional assess-\nments. This is also reflected in the BBC's editorial guidelines, which state a commitment\nto reflecting a\nbreadth and diversity of opinion across our output as a whole, over an appropriate period, so\nthat no significant strand of thought is knowingly unreflected or under-represented. We will be\nfair and open-minded when examining evidence and weighing material acts. (British\nTogether, these statements highlight how, given the time and space constraints of broad-\ncasting, decisions about which voices and positions to represent necessarily involves\nselectivity and significant curatorial responsibility on behalf of the journalist (see also\nEngelbert and McCurdy, 2012). It also entails a careful judgement of the different articu-\nlations of impartiality across genre and content types, including distinctions between\ndomestic and international content (e.g. BBC Trust, 2012: 12\u00ad13). Implicit in these con-\nceptions is a belief that, just as journalists have a `gut feeling' for news (Schultz, 2007),\nthey also have specially developed skills for picking up the range of views and voices on\na particular issue, and an empirical approach to `examining evidence and weighing mate-\nrial acts'. This, however, is contradicted by research which suggests that journalism is\nlargely an oral culture which relies on evidence gathered in face-to-face conversations\nwith like-minded peers and friends, and takes such views to be representative of the\nbroader public, when in fact they are often skewed by the assumptions of insider cultures\nThe BBC \u00ad along with other public service broadcasters \u00ad has been acutely aware of\nthese issues and has strict editorial guidelines concerning the coverage of controversial\nissues and the inclusion of a range of views and voices (BBC, 2014). It has a tradition of\nbeing highly self-critical in examining its own editorial policy and content. The BBC is\npolitically exposed because much of its funding comes from licence-fee income, directly\npaid by its audience. It is a frequent target for critics of the licence fee. These include\nvoices in the right-wing press (e.g. Aitken, 2013), as well as right-leaning lobbying\ngroups and think tanks such as the Conservative Party-funded Civitas and Newswatch,\nan organisation whose main aim it is to check the `BBC for EU bias' (http://news-watch.\nAs a result, the BBC routinely reviews its programming, with a particular interest in\nits application of principles of impartiality. Since 2007, the BBC Trust has commissioned\na series of impartiality reviews examining the broadcaster's coverage of a range of\nissues, including business and economics coverage, science, arts, rural affairs, the Arab\nSpring and the four nations in the United Kingdom. It is in this spirit that the Bridcut\nReview \u00ad a review designed to assess the state of impartiality more broadly \u00ad was carried\nout for the BBC Trust in 2007. It followed on from calls to rethink the concept in a more\ninclusive fashion. For example, in 2006, the Director of BBC Global News, Peter\nHorrocks, introduced the idea of `radical impartiality', in stressing `the need to hear the\nwidest range of views \u00ad all sides of the story' to ensure that members of the public feel\nrespected and represented in news coverage (Horrocks, 2006).\nHorrocks' position reflected a broader concern with the prevailing paradigm through\nwhich impartiality is practised, based on the recognition that it has tended to result in the\nrepresentation of a limited range of views and voices. The Bridcut Review expanded on this,\nand suggested what would amount to a contestation of the paradigm of impartiality-as-bal-\nance: Lord Bridcut suggested that we need to include more than two sides to an argument,\nmoving on from a `seesaw'model, where impartiality was understood as the representation\nof polar opposites. Instead, he proposed a `wagon wheel'model of impartiality:\nImpartiality today requires a greater subtlety in covering and counterpointing the varied shades\nof opinion \u00ad and arguably always should have done. Whereas opinion used to be balanced in\nsimple alternatives \u00ad and could be measured in tilts of the seesaw or swings of the pendulum\n\u00ad nowadays a more appropriate metaphor might be the many spokes of the wagon wheel ...\nOne opinion is not necessarily the exact opposite of another, nor do they all reach the extremity\nof available argument. (BBC Trust, 2007)\nThe recommendations of the Bridcut Review were subsequently incorporated into the\nBBC editorial policy. The data used in this article were originally commissioned as part\nof the BBC Trust's impartiality review on the breadth of opinion \u00ad one of a series of regu-\nlar reviews of the broadcaster's performance (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013). What we\nwere asked to investigate was whether this editorial policy change and commitment to a\nnew understanding of impartiality had actually translated into practice between 2007 and\n2012. Concretely, we were asked to study whether there has been a shift away from what\nthe Bridcut review referred to as a `seesaw' and towards a `wagon wheel' model of\nimpartiality, as evidenced through the presence of a broader range of opinion and voices\nin their broadcasting on contentious issues.\nThis article draws on the data gathered for this research project, using it as a case\nstudy of a high-profile news organisation trying to move towards the representation of a\ngreater breadth of opinion. The article will chart some of the systemic difficulties of\ndoing so, and thereby demonstrate broader limitations around how ideals of impartiality\nare put into practice. In particular, as the article will suggest, impartiality has tended to\nbe understood and practised with reference to creating `balance' by giving equal time to\nopposing political views (Maras, 2013: 61) \u00ad what we refer to as the paradigm of impar-\ntiality-as-balance. What this means, in practice, is that if a journalist uses a politician\nfrom the governing political party as a source for a story, they are also required to quote\na member of the opposition party to avoid the appearance of bias on the issue. Similarly,\nif journalists are covering a controversial issue, it is customary to quote at least two\nopposing viewpoints. This is problematic in terms of the epistemology of journalism or\nthe system through which its claims to knowledge are made, because it may be that not\nall sides are equal, or there are more than two sides to a story (Boyce, 2007; Starkey,\n2007: xix). It steers journalistic story-telling in the direction of conflict and controversy,\nwhen in fact there may be a consensus \u00ad as in the case of coverage of scientific debates\nsuch as that over climate change, or the safety of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella\n(MMR) vaccine (see also Starkey, 2007: 38). What we here refer to as the paradigm of\nimpartiality-as-balance has been criticised for simplifying the political spectrum and nar-\nrowing the range of views on contentious topics \u00ad a position also reflected in the Bridcut\nReport's (BBC Trust, 2007) metaphor of the wagon wheel.\nAs this article will demonstrate, the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance has the con-\nsequence of reinforcing an institutionalised preference for official and elite sources. This\nis not a new finding, but one which is well-established in the literature on journalistic\nsourcing, starting with Gans' (1979) classical newsroom sociology study, Deciding\nWhat's News, which showed that `Knowns' (political, social and economic elites) appear\nfour times as often in the news as `Unknowns' (ordinary people; including victims and\nprotesters). This pattern of elite dominance has been confirmed in subsequent research.\nBecause journalists overwhelmingly rely on the voices of elites (e.g. Manning, 2001),\nthey have a disproportionate influence on the media agenda (Reese, 1990), acting as the\n`primary definers' who set the framework of interpretation against which all subsequent\nvoices are forced to insert themselves (Hall et al., 1978). By contrast, ordinary people\nwho appear in the news are constructed primarily as passive consumers, reacting to the\nagendas set by these elites (Lewis et al., 2005). This means that journalism reproduces\nthe power structure of the society (e.g. Berkowitz, 2009: 109; Carlson and Franklin,\nship; but it can also end up with a narrow range of voices conveying establishment val-\nues' (p. 30). The systematic over-representation of elite views, and their central role in\nthe media agenda, is a particularly salient concern for a public service broadcaster like\nthe BBC, which is committed to reflecting not just the activities and views of elites, but\nof the society as whole.\nThis study, then, examines how a major news organisation committed to representing\na broad range of views has sought \u00ad and ultimately failed \u00ad to address the systemic prob-\nlems brought about by the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance. More concretely, the\narticle establishes (a) the relationship between the dominance of elite sources and (b) a\nnarrowing range of views and information on contentious issues and (c) an over-repre-\nsentation of Conservative voices. Our findings point to (d) the difficulties of moving\nbeyond impartiality-as-balance in the context of a politically exposed public service\nbroadcaster.\nMethodology\nThis article is based on a quantitative content analysis of hundreds of news items and\nthousands of sources, comparing the breadth of opinion of the BBC coverage in 2007\nand 2012. Content analysis is commonly used as a method for examining journalistic\nsources (e.g. Riff et al., 2014: 1), as it enables researchers to generate quantitative data\ndescribing larger samples. The content analysis reported here focuses on sourcing pat-\nterns in the coverage of three topics: immigration, religion in the United Kingdom and\nrange of news and current affairs programming, as well as online stories from the BBC\nNews website. The three topics were selected in consultation with the BBC Trust. While\nthis article does not engage with the substance of these topics in detail, it is worthwhile\nnoting that these are particularly interesting as examples of complex and contentious\nissues which, in the view of the BBC itself, require the representation of a broad range of\nopinions (see also BBC Trust, 2007: 7). This is necessary to adequately represent the\ndiversity of viewpoints \u00ad particularly significant on the most controversial of issues but\na broader priority for the BBC as discussed above.\nTo investigate any changes in the breadth of opinion over time, we studied weekday\ncoverage of these topics over a month-long period between 15 October and 15 November\nin 2007 and 2012, respectively. Our research team examined thousands of news reports on\ntelevision and radio, but coded only stories relevant to the three topics of religion, immigra-\ntion and Britain's relationship to Europe. Over the sample period, we identified a total of\n254 stories on these topics on broadcast platforms, out of which 85 appeared on television\nprogrammes and 169 on radio. Furthermore, we identified 246 relevant online stories from\nthe BBC News website. Altogether, the study reported here is based on the analysis of 500\nstories. Our coding scheme for this study was constructed to provide a quantitative descrip-\ntion of whose voices were heard. The detailed examination of source types allowed us to\ninvestigate whether the range of voices has shifted between 2007 and 2012. We examined\nup to 16 sources in each story, for a total of 2165 sources in the sample overall.2 Although\nthe story was the unit of analysis, this was essentially a sourcing study, allowing for a\ndetailed picture of sources, including an examination of what types of actors they were and\ntheir political orientation.3 This approach enabled us to measure the diversity of sources,\nwhich gives some indication of whether programming included a range of voices \u00ad incor-\nporating a `wagon wheel' rather than a `seesaw' approach. However, a diversity of voices\ndoes not necessarily translate directly into a diversity of views, and to help us assess the\nlatter, we also carried out qualitative examinations of selected content. Further, we coded\nfor duration of direct quotations from sources in broadcasts, as well as word counts for\nonline content.4 Coding was carried out by a team of 10 experienced coders. The coding\nscheme was extensively piloted prior to the conduct of the content analysis by the research\nteam. While many of the measures were adapted from previous studies (including impar-\ntiality reviews), our source type variables were refined specifically for this study through\nthe piloting process. Intercoder reliability tests were carried out on 5 percent of the sample\nby two reliability coders who were part of the research team, using intercoder agreement as\nthe measure. For all variables discussed here, the tests resulted in agreement above 80 per-\ncent.5 The study discussed in this article is one of two that we carried out as part of the\nimpartiality review.Asecond study examined routine coverage over the same time periods,\ncomparing BBC with its main terrestrial broadcaster competitors, Independent Television\n(ITV) and Channel 4 and is briefly referenced later in the article.\nOn television, we examined BBC News at Ten (BBC One), BBC Breakfast 7\u00ad8 a.m.\n(BBC One) and Newsnight (BBC Two). On radio, we coded the Today programme from 7\n9\u00ad10 a.m. (Radio 5 Live). The sample was chosen, first of all, to include a mixture of broad-\ncast and online coverages. Second, we wanted to measure the breadth of opinion across a\nrange of programming, including flagship programmes such as the Today programme,\nNewsnight and BBC News at Ten, as well as `softer' news programmes such as BBC\nBreakfast and audience participation on Your Call. The following table displays the number\nof stories focusing on these topics across the programmes and platforms that we coded.\nAs Table 1 demonstrates, online coverage on the three topics accounted for the largest\nnumber of stories in the sample. This is not surprising given that there are fewer con-\nstraints on space and quantity of reports in the online environment. The second-most\nprominent programme was Today, Radio 4's flagship morning news programme. This\nmay be explained by the length of the programme coded in the study \u00ad an hour and a half\na day, compared to 30 minutes to an hour for most of the other programmes. But it also\nrelates to the programme format, featuring a large number of different stories, compared\nto Newsnight \u00ad the only other BBC programme of comparable length \u00ad which provides\nin-depth coverage of a few stories.\nOur sample inevitably delivers `snapshots' that provide a partial view of the breadth\nof opinion in BBC programming. First, the sample represents a fraction of news and\nTable 2. Story topic by year.\nEU: European Union.\ncurrent affairs programming, and second, it does so over a limited and specific period of\ntime. Although we deliberately selected time frames that avoided major news events\n(e.g. elections, disasters and scandals) which might have skewed the sample, it is none-\ntheless inevitable that certain stories and sources were particularly prominent, while oth-\ners might be entirely absent. While our findings may not represent the exact distribution\nof sources and stories in the BBC news provision in general, they are an accurate reflec-\ntion of what occurred in this particular time span in coverage of the selected topic, and\nindicative of broader patterns.\nFindings\nOverall, our findings demonstrate little change between 2007 and 2012, highlighting the\ncontinued predominance of an understanding of impartiality in terms of balancing oppos-\ning party-political voices. Relating to this, our research shows a focus on party-political\ninfighting rather than the substance or context of these issues. Across the three topics, the\nnumber of stories breaks down as follows (Table 2).\nThere was a larger number of stories on religion and immigration in 2007 than in 2012,\nwhile the European Union (EU) appeared to be a more salient topic in 2012 than it was in\n2007, and accounted for the most stories overall \u00ad just over two-fifths of our entire sam-\nple. This distribution of stories does not necessarily indicate a shift in the editorial\nTable 1. Number of stories by programme and platform.\nPlatform and programme Number of stories Percentage of overall\nsample (%)\npriorities of the BBC, but rather reflects the prominence of specific news events during\nthe sample period which related to the three topics. So, for example, during October and\nNovember 2007, the Lisbon Treaty was being negotiated and political infighting among\nLabour and Conservative parties was central to the news agenda, and therefore featured in\nmany of the stories about the UK's relationship to the EU. During the same period, ques-\ntions around the relationship between Radical Islam and terrorism were prominent in the\nreligion sample. In 2012, by contrast, the most salient news events in the EU sample\nincluded tensions between the two main parties in discussions over the EU budget, while\na large number of the religion stories focused on debates within the Church of England\nover the appointment of the new Archbishop of Canterbury. In our immigration sample,\nthe most prominent sets of stories in each of the 2 years focused once again on political\ninfighting \u00ad in 2007, over the employment of illegal immigrants at the Home Office, and\nin 2012, over the backlog in the processes of asylum cases. These were framed in terms of\ntensions between the two main parties. The over-riding impression left by the coverage is\nthat what matters in mediated discussions over immigration, religion and the EU is not the\nbroader social, political and cultural debates regarding these issues, but rather the ways in\nwhich they articulate and dramatise the perpetual battle between the two main parties.\nTable 3 shows the overall distribution of source types across the sample in each of the\nThe most striking finding was the dominance of political sources: they accounted for\nalmost half of all source appearances in 2007 and more than half in 2012. On the topic of\nBritain's relationship to Europe alone, political sources accounted for more than three in\nused almost 10 times as frequently as the second-largest source category \u00ad media and\nTable 3. Overall distribution of source type by year.a\nPolitical sources\n(including politicians and spokespersons)\nNGO: non-governmental organisation.\naColumn percent totals may sometimes be just above or beyond 100 percent due to rounding error.\njournalist sources. The EU is frequently constructed as a remote and elite-focused politi-\ncal institution with little relevance to the public (Dahl, 1994; Garcia-Blanco and Wahl-\nJorgensen, 2013). There has long been discussions among scholars, pundits and officials\nabout the `democratic deficit' in the EU \u00ad or the extent to which the political union's\ninstitutions fail to adequately represent its citizens (e.g. Ward, 2002). This bias is repro-\nduced in the coverage, which focuses on debates between Eurosceptic and pro-European\npolitical voices, largely from the two main parties.\nThe pattern of political source dominance indicates that far from adopting a new para-\ndigm of impartiality as a result of the Bridcut Review (BBC Trust, 2007) and editorial\npolicy change, the tendency towards an elite and relatively narrow range of debate only\nintensified between the 2 years. This is perhaps not surprising in the light of the literature\non journalistic sourcing discussed above. Nor is it unique to the BBC: In a second study\ncarried out as part of the same review, where we examined national programming across\nthe BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, there was a general pattern of dominance of party-political\nsources (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013).6 But is a striking finding nonetheless, given the\nofficial editorial commitment to a different approach. It demonstrates that the paradigm\nof impartiality-as-balance is so ingrained within journalistic routines that it appears\nimpossible to overcome through top-down policy changes.\nMedia or journalist sources made up 7 percent of sources in both years; more than any\nother profession aside from politicians. This number was primarily accounted for by the\nuse of BBC specialist correspondents or editors as commentators, and by references to\nreports from other media. This reflects the rise of journalists used as experts \u00ad a trend\nalso discerned by other scholars (e.g. Barnhurst, 2015). This development has coincided\nwith, and is closely related to, the rise of interpretation in news journalism, particularly\nIt is also illustrative to consider the relative salience of different sources types. Our\nstudy included up to 16 sources for each story. If we compare the presence of politicians\nand members of the public in terms of their prominence within the stories, a clear pattern\nemerges: whereas politicians account for 52.9 percent of the first eight sources, and\nmembers of the public just 8.2 percent, the pattern for the last eight sources is very dif-\nferent. Here, political sources make up 42.1 percent, whereas members of the public\nincrease to 27.7 percent. This indicates that members of the public tend to appear much\nlater in news stories than official sources, rarely contributing to shaping the lens through\nwhich news events are framed.\nBy contrast to politicians, members of the public were used as sources a total of 133\nas when a story on extremist claims in a mosque booklet included a quote from a worshipper\nwho said `I would be very surprised to hear that any kind of extremism or terrorist-related\nactivities were held in this mosque, it's not possible, it's a very open mosque' (http://news.\nAs such, non-elite sources were not primarily setting the agenda for debate, but react-\ning to unfolding news events. This is consistent with research on media representations\nof citizens which demonstrates that although ordinary people appear frequently in the\nnews, this does not mean that they frame public debate or provide new perspectives on\npolitical issues (Lewis et al., 2005). Likewise, members of the public were far more\nlikely to feature in brief sound bites, with the vast majority of their appearances being\n1\u00ad10 seconds in length, whereas sound bites for political sources, as well as other author-\nitative source types such as business owners, trade union leaders, academics, police and\njournalists were most frequently 11\u00ad20 seconds long.\nPolitical sources were much more likely than other source types to be featured in the\nopening sections of news reports. This had the consequence of framing reports from\nparty-political perspectives which other sources then had to respond to \u00ad demonstrating\nthe power of political sources to serve as `primary definers'(Hall et al., 1978). If we look\nin detail at the most frequently cited political source types, there is a clear pattern:\nWestminster sources are by far the most prominent voices heard in BBC coverage, and\nthe incumbent government outranks the opposition, demonstrating the persistence of the\n`Westminster bubble' (e.g. Deacon et al., 2006) and the advantages enjoyed by incum-\nbents in broadcast coverage (Prior, 2006). This pattern contravenes the aim to go beyond\nthe realms of parliamentary politics articulated in the Bridcut review: `While continuing\na thorough and conscientious job of reporting both Houses of Parliament, and the other\ndemocratic institutions within the UK, the BBC should not always feel beholden to the\nparliamentary model' (British Broadcasting Corporation Trust, 2007: 35).\nAs a group \u00ad based on adding up all the references to sources in this category \u00ad gov-\nernment ministers and members of Cabinet topped the chart of source types. Among this\ngroup, the most frequently quoted individual in 2007 was Foreign Secretary David\nMay accounted for 15 source citations (1.5%). The Prime Minister was the most impor-\ntant individual source in both years, far outranking anyone else, even if the opposition\nleader was also highly prominent across both years. This points to the increasing person-\nalization and presidentialization of politics in the United Kingdom (Langer, 2011) and\ndemonstrates that it is more difficult for groups and individuals outside of the main\npolitical parties to get a voice. But it also shows that the range and diversity of views\nwithin each of the main political parties will tend to be under-represented, consistent\nwith political parties' strategy of centrally `controlling the message' (e.g. Gaber, 2013).\nTable 4 below looks at the prevalence of particular political source types.\nTable 4. Most prominent types of political sources, by year.a\nSingle individuals\nGroups\nLabels\na\nThese include both direct speech sources, and ones that are quoted or referred to.

The percentages are of\nall sources in each year.\nThe table allows us to examine, first of all, how frequently the incumbent Prime\nMinister and Leader of the Opposition were used as sources. In both years, the Prime\nMinister was the most newsworthy single source: in 2007, Gordon Brown was quoted 46\nance 53 times (5.3% of sources in 2012). Opposition politicians were, perhaps not sur-\nprisingly, less prominent than the incumbents. In 2007, there were an almost equal\nnumber of references to `Conservatives' and `government' (28 and 26, or 2.4% and\njust 22 times (2.2%). The prevalence of sources representing the Shadow Cabinet and\nMinisters went down from 3.9 percent of all sources under David Cameron's opposition\nwas a more newsworthy opposition leader than Miliband, and that his government has\nbeen more successful in attracting coverage than the preceding Labour government. This\nmay not be due to any bias on the part of the BBC, as David Cameron has widely been\ncharacterised as a more compelling media persona than Labour leaders Gordon Brown\nand Ed Miliband. Cameron has been seen as a new type of politician who has been spec-\ntacularly successful in `generating external, individualized media meta-capital and, con-\nsequently, achieving electoral success' (Davis and Seymour, 2010: 755). As Langer\n(2010) points out, Cameron's success demonstrates that\nThe capacity to offer a `human' persona is often considered a prerequisite of political and\nelectoral success and a key marker of contemporary leadership potential. David Cameron's\npopularity and Gordon Brown's woes in the opinion polls have often been discussed in these\nterms, the former's heir-to-Blair youthful vitality and emotional openness contrasted favorably\nto the detached and dour Brown. (p. 61)\nThe pattern of Conservative dominance was also highlighted in the analysis of ref-\nerences to sources for which a political affiliation could be determined, as shown in\nTable 5 below.\nAs this table demonstrates, the Conservative Party has consistently accounted for\nbetween two in five to almost half of all sources with clear political affiliations, whereas\nLabour went down significantly between the 2 years \u00ad from almost half to just over a\nquarter. The compelling persona of David Cameron notwithstanding, this offers some\nevidence of editorial decision-making in favour of Conservative voices and views. As\nour research on the coverage of Britain's relationship to Europe also demonstrated, there\nwas a tendency to over-represent Conservative and Eurosceptic views, whereas the case\nfor Europe was rarely heard in the BBC coverage (Berry, 2013). There may be several\nreasons for the apparent pro-Conservative bias in BBC coverage on the topics we exam-\nined \u00ad a finding which flies in the face of criticisms of the BBC for its perceived left-\nwing bias. After the publication of our report (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013) which\noccasioned significant public debate, the BBC's financial editor, Robert Peston, has been\none among several commentators backing up the findings on the basis of newsroom\nexperience. Following his delivery of the Charlie Wheeler lecture, he suggested that `the\nBBC's routinely so anxious about being accused of being left-wing, it quite often veers\nin what you might call a very pro-establishment, [a] rather right-wing direction, so that\nit's not accused of that' (Sommers, 2014). He further argued that\n[The] broadcaster had grown `completely obsessed' with following the news agenda set by\ncoverage of the right-wing papers such as The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail. There's a\nslightly `safety first' thing at the BBC \u00ad that if we think the Mail or the Telegraph is gonna lead\nwith it, then we should lead with it, `he said'. I happen to think that's mad. (Sommers, 2014)\nThese views are consistent with previous research on UK broadcasters' news agenda\n(Hargreaves and Thomas, 2002) and were echoed in informal responses to our research\nfrom other journalists, who argued that a bias towards Conservative sources may be\nexplained by the defensiveness of the BBC, caused by constant accusations of a left-\nwing bias. As one anonymous BBC journalist put it in a Twitter Direct Message (DM)\nresponding to our research findings, `Four of the five BBC editors I worked for were\nacutely conscious of the perception that the BBC is left wing and programmed to counter\nit' (Anonymous, 14 February 2014). It points to a paradoxical and little recognised dan-\nger facing public service broadcasters which, like the BBC, are funded on a licence-fee\nmodel: They are, in fact, highly politically exposed and subjected to far more scrutiny \u00ad\nparticularly with respect to any perceived political bias \u00ad than commercial media\norganisations.\nTaken together, the two main parties accounted for almost nine in ten party-political\nsources in 2007, going down to just over three in four in 2012. Other party affiliations\nwhich appeared in much smaller numbers included Plaid Cymru, Democratic Unionist\nParty (DUP), the British National Party (BNP), Sinn Fein, as well as Independents.\nThese, however, were almost absent from coverage on the three topics.7 The reasons why\nthe two main political parties so dominated coverage do not necessarily have much to do\nwith any deliberate neglect of minority voices, but more with the entrenched paradigm\nof impartiality-as-balance, combined with an institutionalised understanding of the\nnewsworthiness of elite sources. The ways in which the paradigm limits the range of\nviews and sources presented on each story is helpfully illustrated by examining one\nexample in more detail \u00ad the story that contained the largest number of sources across the\n2007 online sample on the topic of immigration, and therefore one that could be expected\nto display a diverse range of voices. The story, `Migration \"causes pressure in UK\"'\na report on the economic and social consequences of migration, and is interesting to\nexamine for the relative prominence given to particular sources and views.\nThe story opened with a brief summary of the report's findings and went on to cite the\nstatements of ministers on the `clear benefits' of migration to the British economy. It\nsubsequently discussed the findings of the report in more detail, based on the experiences\nfrom different regions in the United Kingdom, some of them reporting concern about the\nadverse effects of immigration on crime, health and education. The first directly quoted\nsource in the story was Immigration Minister Liam Byrne, who `said it was important to\n\"strike a new balance\" in immigration policy':\n\"That means looking at the wider benefits to the British economy on the one hand, but it means\nwe have to take into account the wider impact on British public services and life as well.\"\nThe second source was Damian Green, shadow minister for immigration, who\nexpressed the need for migration quotas:\n\"We say of course you should look at the economics, at the effects on public services, on\ndemand for housing, school places and so on, and that then the government should set an\nexplicit limit every year,\" he said.\nThe pattern of according most prominence to a source representing government,\nimmediately followed by a member of the opposition holds true across our sample.\nSubsequent sources in the story included Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah from the centre-\nleft Institute of Public Policy Research, providing an analytical perspective:\n\"It is clear that migration brings huge economic benefits to the UK,\" said Dr\nSriskandarajah.\n\"It is also clear that, although recent migration is presenting new challenges in areas\nwhich have received large numbers of newcomers, most local communities around the\ncountry are coping very well.\"\nThis position was counter-balanced by Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the anti-immi-\ngration pressure group, Migrationwatch UK, who `said migration on the scale Britain\nwas currently facing was having a \"huge impact\" with \"little economic justification\"';\nThis example shows how sources were carefully balanced in reporting \u00ad but in such a\nway that reporting presented each topic as one on which there were arguments for and\nagainst, rather than a broader range of views. The non-party-political voices included\nhere to introduce a breadth of opinion come from think tanks \u00ad widely viewed as integral\nparts of a `policy elite' (Smith, 1993) which are frequently directly linked to political\ninterests, rather than being the voices of an independent civil society (e.g. Dinan and\nDespite the dominance of elite, party-political voices in flagship programming, there\nwas also some indication that online and phone-in platforms were more likely to include\nnon-elite voices, representing a broader range of views. For example, genres which\nincluded audience participation \u00ad particularly the phone-in programme, Your Call and\nonline news \u00ad were more likely to include a broad range of sources, representing opin-\nions that were not heard elsewhere, including more extreme views. For example, in sto-\nries on religion, 23 members of the public appeared inYour Call and 40 online, accounting\nfor 70 percent of all instances where members of the public appeared in the religion\nsample.8 However, just as there may be a hierarchy of access to the media, there is also\na hierarchy of platforms \u00ad as our research shows, `flagship'programmes or more prestig-\nious platforms are less likely to include a broader range of voices and views. It does,\nnonetheless, suggest that alternative platforms and formats are more likely to enable a\n`wagon wheel' approach to public debate.\nConclusion\nThis article has demonstrated the enduring force of the paradigm of impartiality-as-bal-\nance. In the selected coverage we examined between 2007 and 2012, the BBC failed to\nchange the paradigm \u00ad despite grand pronunciations in the Bridcut Report and good\nintentions carried over into the editorial policy. Although the research presented here has\nfocused on the BBC, our second study which encompassed the other main terrestrial\nbroadcasters, ITV and Channel 4, showed that this limiting operationalisation of impar-\ntiality is not unique to the BBC (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013). The findings of this study,\nthen, raise larger questions about the difficulties of representing the range of opinion in\nthe context of public service broadcasting.\nThe consequences of the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance are manifold. First, it\nmeans that only a narrow range of views and voices are heard on the most contentious\nand important issues. Second, it results in reporting that focuses on party-political con-\nflict, to the detriment of a journalism which provides much-needed context.\nMore than anything, our research demonstrates the power of professional paradigms\n\u00ad in this case, the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance. This may, of course, be particu-\nlarly exacerbated by the traditional and long-standing two-party dominance of British\npolitics, brought about by a first-past-the-post electoral system (e.g. Lipson, 1953).\nNonetheless, the pattern of valuing an understanding of objectivity as balance holds true\naround the world (e.g. Berger, 2000), and is profoundly engrained in the everyday prac-\ntice of journalists. There might be several reasons for the entrenched nature of this para-\ndigm. Manning (2001) argues that the `pressure of news deadlines and the importance of\nobtaining information rich in news values, encourages a dependency upon official\nsources' (p. 55). Also, journalists tend to `index' the range of competing viewpoints to\nthe intensity and duration of party-political conflicts (Bennett, 1994: 23). These practices\nhave made it possible for journalism to capture and construct the news, and are unlikely\nto change unless the material circumstances of news production are profoundly trans-\nformed. But it does have profound consequences for the epistemology of journalism,\ninsofar as the knowledge it produces is heavily structured by the reliance on opposing\nand polarised viewpoints, rather than a broader range of positions.\nParadigms within cultures of practice cannot be easily changed from the top-down,\nbut rather must be transformed from the bottom-up. Such a shift is not easy to achieve in\njournalism, particularly not in the unique \u00ad and highly politically charged \u00ad context\nwithin which the BBC operates as a public service broadcaster. However, our research\nalso suggests that some types of content \u00ad including online news \u00ad contain a broader\nrange of news sources and views. This may point us to the ways in which the affordances\nof emerging technologies enable new discursive formations that may ultimately chal-\nlenge the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance because they provide novel ways of think-\ning about what constitutes news and its sources.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: The author(s) received financial support from the BBC Trust for the\nresearch reported in this article. Funding from the Cardiff University Open Access Fund supported\nopen access publication of the article.\nNotes\n1. The content analysis was commissioned as part of the BBC Trust impartiality review and\nfocused on assessing the breadth of opinion in the light of the association's commitment to a\ngreater diversity of views in its programming.\n2. It should be noted that we opted to study up to 16 sources per story, as this captured the\nentirety of all sources cited in all but five of the stories analysed (the small number of excep-\ntions included phone-in programmes). In cases where there were more than 16 sources, we\ncoded only the first 16 sources mentioned.\n3. We also analysed sources in terms of a range of demographic variables, including gender,\nage, ethnicity, religion and region, among many other things. Analysis of these has not been\nincluded in this article for reasons of space.\n4. Online coverage on the relevant topics was identified by doing keyword searches during the\nsample period.\n5. One variable (nationality of sources) was excluded from our reporting as a result of low inter-\ncoder reliability.\n6. Please note that `national' programming here refers to news programmes distributed across\nthe United Kingdom on particular networks (BBC, ITV and Channel 4). In our report on\nthe research, we refer to such programmes as `network' programming to distinguish it from\n`nations and regions'programming which is confined to particular nations and regions within\nthe United Kingdom.\n7. The more frequent appearance of the Scottish National Party in 2012 relates to stories around\nthe party's proposal for Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom, and the conse-\nquences for EU membership that might result. This news event was very prominent in our\nonline sample, but almost absent from television and radio coverage.\n8. This statistic excludes the Today programme's Thought for the Day feature, which skewed the\nsample given that it almost always used religious leaders as the main source.\nReferences\nAitken R (2013) Can we still trust the BBC?
