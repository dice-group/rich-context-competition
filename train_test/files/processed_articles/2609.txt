Massey and Thomas W. McDade)\nTwo decades of research indicate causal associations between social\nrelationships and mortality, but important questions remain as to\nhow social relationships affect health, when effects emerge, and\nhow long they last. Drawing on data from four nationally represen-\ntative longitudinal samples of the US population, we implemented\nan innovative life course design to assess the prospective association\nof both structural and functional dimensions of social relationships\n(social integration, social support, and social strain) with objectively\nmeasured biomarkers of physical health (C-reactive protein, systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass\nindex) within each life stage, including adolescence and young,\nmiddle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life\nstages. We found that a higher degree of social integration was\nassociated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose\u00ad\nresponse manner in both early and later life. Conversely, lack of social\nconnections was associated with vastly elevated risk in specific life\nstages. For example, social isolation increased the risk of inflammation\nby the same magnitude as physical inactivity in adolescence, and the\neffect of social isolation on hypertension exceeded that of clinical risk\nfactors such as diabetes in old age. Analyses of multiple dimensions of\nsocial relationships within multiple samples across the life course pro-\nduced consistent and robust associations with health. Physiological\nimpacts of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships\nemerge uniquely in adolescence and midlife and persist into old age.\nsocial relationships | physiological dysregulation | longevity | life course |\nbiomarker\nAdefining characteristic of human society is that individual lives\nare intertwined through social relationships. Full social partici-\npation is such a fundamental human need that research since the\n1900s has found the lack of social connections increases the odds of\ndeath by at least 50% (1, 2). When multidimensional assessments of\nsocial relationships were considered, the odds of mortality increased\nby 91% among the socially isolated (2). The magnitude of this effect\nis comparable to that of smoking and exceeds those of many other\nknown risk factors of mortality, such as obesity or physical inactivity\n(2, 3). Although much evidence has accrued on the strong causal\nassociations between social relationships and mortality as well as\nother health outcomes (4\u00ad7), important questions remain as to how\nsocial relationships affect health, when these effects emerge, and how\nlong they last (8).\nStudies of social, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms\nunderlying the social relationship gradient in health have shed light\non the first question (9\u00ad11). It is less clear, however, what biological\nmechanisms may be at play. Recent research on the biology of aging\nemphasizes the essential role of physiological stress response and\nregulation across multiple bodily systems in shaping longevity (12,\n13). Although social relationship gradients in health and longevity\n(Fig. 1, path A) and physiological determinants of mortality (Fig. 1,\npath B) have been widely documented, these separate bodies of\nresearch have yet to be fully integrated. We have yet to determine\nwhether social relationship differentials in longevity arise from a\nbiological process in which social experiences \"get under the skin\" to\nalter physiological regulatory systems (Fig. 1, path C) (4).\nLaboratory research on rats using experimental designs demon-\nstrated that social isolation and hypervigilance increase the incidence\nof mammary tumors (14, 15) and compromise innate immune re-\nsponse to stress (16). In humans, deficits in social relationships such\nas social isolation or low social support can similarly lead to chronic\nactivation of immune, neuroendocrine, and metabolic systems that\nlie in the pathways, leading to cardiovascular, neoplastic, and other\nexperimental studies using observational data from human subjects\ntentatively support this proposition by documenting associations\nbetween social relationship measures such as social integration and\nsupport with biomarkers of inflammation (5, 8, 18), metabolic syn-\ndrome (18, 19), and cumulative dysregulation indicated by allostatic\nload (20). However, because these associations are largely based on\ncross-sectional data, they cannot be assumed to represent underlying\ncausal relationships. Additional prospective longitudinal studies are\nneeded to better address bias due to potential confounding factors\nand reverse causality, further explaining path C.\nExamining how social and biological processes unfold and\ninteract as individuals age is a critical step in advancing scientific\nexplanations of the emergence and progression of diseases. A life\ncourse perspective, represented by the horizontal arrow D as a\ndevelopmental trajectory, has not been fully brought to bear on\nthis question. This perspective may offer considerable leverage\nby linking physical risks to social exposures that occur over time\nacross multiple developmental stages from early to late life. The\nvast majority of biosocial research to date on this association has\nSignificance\nAlthough much evidence has accrued in research over the past\n20 years on the strong causal associations between social rela-\ntionships and health and longevity, important gaps remain in our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms, timing, and duration of these\nassociations. This study integrates social and biological disciplin-\nary perspectives and research to examine how social relation-\nships \"get under the skin\" to affect physiological well-being as\nindividuals age. By combining data from and harmonizing mea-\nsurement across four large nationally representative, population-\nbased, contemporary surveys using an innovative longitudinal life\ncourse design, this study provides previously unidentified evi-\ndence on the biological and life course mechanisms linking social\nrelationship patterns with health. As such, our findings advance\nexplanations of the emergence and progression of diseases across\nthe human life span.\nAuthor contributions: Y.C.Y. and K.M.H. designed research; Y.C.Y., C.B., K.G., T.L., K.S.,\nand K.M.H. performed research; Y.C.Y., C.B., K.G., T.L., K.S., and K.M.H. analyzed data;\nand Y.C.Y., C.B., K.G., T.L., K.S., and K.M.H. wrote the paper.\nReviewers: D.S.M., Princeton University; and T.W.M., Northwestern University.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, early life social experiences may be\nbiologically embedded at that time, shown by an increasing body\nof research linking childhood disadvantage and maltreatment to\nincreased likelihood of exaggerated biological stress response\nand, in turn, higher risks of inflammation and cardiovascular\nRelationship deficits--such as social isolation, lack of support,\nor high strain--are alternative forms of social adversity that can\ncreate chronic stress by continuous exposure to chains of risk\nthat accumulate over the life course (27, 28). Individuals who\nexperienced early adversity are subject to multiple and longer\ndurations of stress exposures and more prone to inflammatory\nand stress-related diseases as they age. At the same time, the\nemergence of chronic diseases usually takes many decades due to\nthe long latency after the initial risk exposures (29). Therefore,\nextensive longitudinal data and analyses are imperative to un-\nderstanding how the connection of social relationships and lon-\ngevity unfolds over the human life span. Little empirical research\nexists that depicts this lifelong process partly because data that\nextend sufficiently over long periods of the life course, as\ndepicted in trajectory D, are exceedingly rare.\nThis study addresses the aforementioned questions, integrates\nprevious research on social relationships and health across disciplines,\nand tests a new longitudinal model of how social relationships matter\nfor physiological health across the human life span. We make three\nunique contributions that shed new light on path C across trajectory\nD. First, using data from an array of nationally representative lon-\ngitudinal samples of the US population, we implement an innovative\nlife course design that begins at the earliest developmental stage\n(adolescence) in which physiological consequences of key social re-\nlationship patterns begin to manifest and traces subsequent life stages\n(young, middle, late adulthood) to depict the life-long process\nof stress response cascades that such relationship patterns initiate.\nThe data come from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nto Adult Health (Add Health) to capture adolescence and young\nadulthood, the National Survey of Midlife Development in the\nUnited States (MIDUS) for middle adulthood, and both the Health\nand Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project (NSHAP) for late adulthood. The use of multiple\nlarge, population-based samples in an integrative design allows us to\nassess linkages between social relationships and health for each life\nstage. It also offers an unprecedented fuller view of age variations in\nsuch linkages than any previous study of a particular sample or single\nlife stage alone. Second, this study uses comprehensive and refined\nmeasurements of social relationships that encompass two primary\ndimensions that may differentially influence physical health at\ndifferent stages of the life course. It assesses measures of social\nintegration to capture the structural\u00adquantitative dimension and\nmeasures of social support and strain to capture the functional\u00ad\nqualitative dimension, using age-appropriate conceptualizations of\nthese domains for each life stage. Third, the study examines\nmultiple objectively measured biomarkers or endophenotypes in-\ncluding inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP), cardiovascular\nfunction (hypertension), and energy metabolism (overall obesity\nand abdominal obesity) to capture key physiological mechanisms\nunderlying common diseases of aging and longevity (12).\nResults\nOur results indicate that social integration is related to better\nphysiological functioning and lower risks of physical disorders in a\ndose\u00adresponse fashion across life stage samples. Fig. 2 illustrates that\nindividuals with a higher degree of social connectedness at prior\npoints in time have lower predicted values of all four markers. De-\nscriptive statistics on biomarkers, sample characteristics, and cova-\nriates are shown in Tables S1\u00adS3, respectively. Adjusting for age, sex,\nand race, the negative associations of social integration with poor\nphysical functioning were statistically significant for log-transformed\nCRP [log(CRP)] and systolic blood pressure (BP) in all three life\nstages shown, including adolescence and young and late adulthood.\nAdditional analyses with diastolic BP revealed qualitatively similar\nresults, so we presented results of systolic BP because of its clinical\nrelevance for subsequent vascular and other chronic disease events\nand mortality as individuals age (30). Social integration gradients in\nwaist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were also\nevident across samples, but the associations were significant only in\nadolescence. The association between social integration index and\nBMI estimated in the late adulthood HRS sample was in the op-\nposite direction as expected but did not reach statistical significance\nto warrant substantive explanations. The results from the NSHAP\nanalyses were similar to those from the HRS and were thus omitted\nfrom Fig. 2. We focused instead on the longitudinal change model\nresults from NSHAP below.\nIn addition to lower risks of poor functioning, more socially in-\ntegrated individuals also had lower odds of deleterious physical\noutcomes that are of clinical significance. Table 1 shows that in the\nbasic models adjusting for age, sex, and race, a higher social in-\ntegration index score was related to a 25% [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.74,\ninflammation in adolescence and young adulthood (Add Health) and\nlate adulthood (HRS), respectively. The estimated OR for the\nNSHAP sample at baseline also shows a negative association\nlower odds of inflammation. Adjusting for covariates reduced some\nbut not all of these associations, indicating that the physiological\neffects of social integration are partially mediated by socioeconomic\nstatus, health risk behavior (i.e., smoking, physical activity, obesity),\nand prior chronic disease. To put the magnitude of the effects in\nperspective, additional analyses revealed that social isolation raised\nthe odds of high inflammation (OR = 1.27, P = 0.05) to a compa-\nrable degree with physical inactivity (OR = 1.21, P = 0.05) (Add\nHealth analyses).\nThe results for other biomarkers show large age variations in\ntheir associations with the social integration index. The pro-\ntective effects of social integration were particularly large in\nagainst abdominal obesity and particularly salient in old age\nDiseases and Longevity\nPhysiological Regulation\nA\nD\nAdolescence Midadulthood Late Adulthood\nYoung Adulthood\nSocial Relationships\nFig. 1.

In the basic model, the OR estimated for\nthe HRS sample shows a significant 13% lower odds of hy-\nup for those with a higher mean social integration level earlier\nin time. The corresponding estimates for the NSHAP sample\nfrom the longitudinal residual change model show a 54% re-\nduction in the odds of developing hypertension (OR = 0.46,\nhigher baseline social integration score.\nIn both studies, these associations remained robust after\nadjusting for all of the other covariates in the full models. We\nnote that with an interval of 6 y in the elderly NSHAP sample\nwho already had a high prevalence of hypertension at baseline, a\nchange in risk of this size was substantial. Specifically, the effect\nknown risk factor for hypertension at older ages. The associa-\ntions of social integration with overall obesity are significant in\nboth early and late life. The OR estimates indicate strong pro-\ntective effects of social connectedness against obesity in adoles-\ncence in the basic model and also at old age in the change\nmodels estimated for the NSHAP sample.\nWe did not find any significant results regarding the social in-\ntegration\u00adbiomarker associations in the MIDUS sample, which\nmay be due to empirical and substantive factors. Compared with\nother studies, the MIDUS sample with biomarkers is more ho-\nmogeneous, consisting of mostly white respondents with higher\nlevels of educational attainment and household income. However,\nsupplemental analyses restricted to only white respondents with\nthe other three studies did not change their results. [To further\nexamine whether the associations between integration and bio-\nmarkers in the MIDUS sample were generalizable, we conducted\nparallel analyses using a middle-aged subsample (age 34\u00ad74) of the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nintegration among middle-aged NHANES respondents was not\nprotective against physiological risks.] Therefore, the racial and\nsocioeconomic (SES) composition of the MIDUS sample is un-\nlikely to account for its lack of consistency with the other samples.\nFurther scrutiny of the MIDUS data revealed that 80% of the\nsample reported weekly family and friend contact, indicating\nTable 1.

Social support and strain\nmeasures are summarized in Table S2. In general, we found that\nperceived social support and strain measures are related to physi-\nological indicators differently from social integration in that asso-\nciations are more modest, nonlinear, and particularly salient for\nmidadulthood. Most respondents in study samples with available\ninformation on quality of social relationships reported adequate\nlevels of social support and little strain. Even though variations in the\nquality of relationships are small, those who perceived more support\nor strain are different from others in both physical functioning and\nclinical risk factors. Models including both social integration and\nsocial support and strain show similar results from those including\nthem separately, suggesting largely independent associations of each\nsocial relationship dimension with biomarkers. The results reported\nbelow thus relate to models of social support and social strain\nwithout the inclusion of social integration.\nFig. 3 illustrated that adjusting for age, sex, and race, those\nwith high (top quartile) social support at the baseline show sig-\nnificantly lower mean values of three markers assessed at the\nfollow-ups than those with lower social support, including sys-\ntolic BP at old age (P = 0.038), WC at young to middle age (P =\n(P = 0.003). Compared with those with low strain, those with\nhigh (top quartile) strain at the baseline exhibited significantly\nhigher mean values of CRP at the follow-up in midadulthood\nand higher mean values of WC and BMI at the follow-up in both\nmid- and late adulthood. Results from the HRS analyses were\nsimilar to the results of the NSHAP analyses and are not shown.\nThe results for binary outcomes based on clinical thresholds are\nsummarized in Table S4. In these models, continuous measures of\nsocial support and social strain yielded superior model fit than the\ndichotomous measures. Higher social support was associated with\nlower odds of abdominal and overall obesity in young to mid-\nadulthood (MIDUS sample only). Such effects were moderate in\nsize and mostly eliminated or explained away by the adjustment of\nadditional covariates. Higher social strain was predictive of mildly\nincreased odds of inflammatory response and abdominal obesity in\nyoung to midadulthood and more substantial increases in the odds\nof overall obesity in both mid- and late adulthood that persisted\nafter the adjustment of the full set of covariates.\nDiscussion\nBy combining data from four large nationally representative, pop-\nulation-based, contemporary studies using an innovative longitudinal\nlife course design, this study has provided previously unidentified\ncausal evidence on the mechanisms linking social relationship pat-\nterns with health and longevity across the human life span. Although\nthe links represented in Fig. 1 have been found to be strong in past\nsocial research that focused on path A, as well as biological research\nthat focused on path B, our study provided evidence that connects\npaths A and B through path C and, for the first time to our knowl-\nedge, documented the life course process in which these paths unfold\nas depicted in trajectory D.\nOur study strengthened support for causal linkages between\nsocial relationships and physical functioning embodied in path C\nby improving both the measurement and analyses of these\nFig. 3. Prospective associations of social support and strain with biomarkers of physiological functioning over the life course. OLS models of biomarkers at follow-\nup regressed on baseline dichotomous measures of social support and social strain, adjusting for age, sex, and race. HRS and NSHAP findings are similar, so we\npresent the larger HRS sample results.\nPHYSIOLOGY\nlinkages. First, our study engaged a more comprehensive set of\nmeasures of relationship characteristics across multiple social life\ndomains that are specific to each life stage and harmonized\nacross four nationally representative studies. We also examined\nthe associations between these relationship indicators and bio-\nmarkers across multiple physiological systems also harmonized\nacross studies. The common patterns that emerged from the\nstudy of multiple measures of both social exposures and bi-\nological outcomes strongly support the generality of the associ-\nations, indicating social integration protects health and promotes\nlongevity. Second, the use of longitudinal data for lagged mea-\nsures of social exposures in relation to subsequent measures of\nbiomarkers in all study samples ensured the proper temporal\norder in causal relationships underlying the association. Al-\nthough the lack of repeated longitudinal measures of biomarkers\nin three study samples precludes causal inference of the physi-\nological impact of social relationships, the NSHAP study allowed\nus to model change in physiological function as an outcome using\ntwo waves of biomarker measurements and hence provided a\nmore rigorous test of the causal effects of interest. Although we\ncannot eliminate the possibility that some prior condition affects\nboth social relations and physiology, this limitation relates more\nto biomarker data measured at one point in time than those that\ninclude repeated biomarker measures over time. We cannot rule\nout the potential effect of mortality selection of older or frailer\nadults. The results are thus likely conservative regarding the full\nrange of physiological effects of social relations. Furthermore,\nthe results are not only consistent across studies included but\nalso consistent with those obtained in previous research across\ndiverse samples such as laboratory animals (14\u00ad16) and clinical\npopulations (5) and study designs such as experiments (14\u00ad16)\nand mortality follow-ups (6\u00ad8). They provide robust and uniform\nsupport for the existence and causal nature of path C.\nIn addition, our study identified the multifaceted links of dif-\nferent dimensions of social relations to physical health. A mea-\nsurement approach including more than one type of relationship\nmeasure may better represent the multiple pathways by which so-\ncial relations affect health (2). By assessing both the structural and\nfunctional dimensions of social relationships, we found that par-\nticular network and support characteristics may have unique in-\nfluences on health. Extending previous research, we found that the\nlinks between social embeddedness and better physical functioning,\nas well as lower clinically significant disease risks, are exceptionally\nstrong across most biological markers examined. Greater perceived\nquality of network ties was also beneficial for some markers with\nmore variation across the life course. We further assessed the\nquality of social relationships by distinguishing positive and nega-\ntive functions of network connections. We found evidence for\nsocial strain as a more significant predictor of (worsening)\nphysiological outcomes than commonly examined social support\nmeasures hypothesized to improve health. This suggests the\nimportance of considering psychosocial distress that may arise\nfrom negative social exchanges in future investigations of social\nrelationships and health links.\nThe longitudinal life course design that we used in trajectory D\nelucidates when and how social integration matters for health\nas the aging process unfolds. We found evidence for the early\nemergence and persistence of the path C linkage between social\nrelationships and physical health over the life course. We did not\ninclude the childhood life stage in this study because we focus\nmore on meaningful social connections beyond familial contexts.\nEmbeddedness in social networks seems to be especially crit-\nical for health during the formative years of building social\nrelationships in adolescence and in the later adult years when\nthe maintenance of social connections are relevant. The robust\nfindings that social integration during adolescence (and not\nduring young adulthood) matters for young adult metabolic\nand cardiovascular healthy functioning suggest that these early\nrelationship contexts and connections play a role in predisease\npathways into adulthood. The young adult years are considered\nto be the healthy years of the life span, yet adolescent social\nconnections differentiate health risks in young adults, long be-\nfore symptoms or overt signs of disease emerge.\nAfter the busy years of midlife, maintaining social connections\nin older adulthood plays a vital role in protecting health. Chronic\nconditions naturally increase during late adulthood as part of\nthe aging process. However, socially embedded older adults ex-\nperience fewer disease risks, and our results from the NSHAP\nanalyses suggest a causal role of social connections in reducing\nhypertension and obesity in old age. The deleterious effect of\nsocial isolation, in particular, was estimated to exceed that of\ndiabetes, a well-known clinical risk factor for many chronic dis-\neases including hypertension. Our findings therefore point to two\nlife stages when the development and maintenance of social\nrelationships can be especially critical for reducing future health\nrisks and, in turn, reducing the high cost and consequences of\nchronic disease for individuals, families, and society as a whole.\nThe age variations we found for these associations also depend\non relationship measures. Whereas the size of social networks\nwas consistently important to physical health in both early and\nlate adulthood, network size was not found to be significantly\nrelated to any biomarkers in midadulthood. Our additional\nanalyses suggest that this is unlikely to be a methodological ar-\ntifact. Several substantive explanations are possible. On one\nhand, adults in midlife are naturally embedded in multiple social\nnetworks associated with this life stage, including those at work,\nin the community, with children and other parents, and aging\nparents. Social integration is not a discriminating factor in mid-\nlife for most adults. On the other hand, these multiple social\nconnections in midlife are potentially stressful in nature. Prior\nresearch shows that greater role conflict across multiple social\ndomains and across generations is especially prevalent during this\nlife stage (32). Therefore, the perceived quality of social rela-\ntionships rather than the density of one's social network may\nbetter capture the link between social ties and health in midlife.\nIn fact, this conclusion is supported by our finding that social\nsupport and strain, which measured qualitative characteristics of\nsocial connections that are distinct from relationship quantity,\nmattered more for physical health in midadulthood and contin-\nued to have impacts in late adulthood. In adolescence, however,\nsocial integration was more pertinent to physical health than\nsocial support as perceived by individuals. This life course pat-\ntern of variation in the relative importance of social integration\nand support to physiological functioning was previously unknown\nand can have new practical import for policy intervention.\nOur study sheds light on the biological mechanisms through\nwhich social relationships impact health across the human life\nspan. Our findings suggest the early emergence and continuity of\nthe physiological impacts of social relationships across the life\ncourse. They also suggest physiological vulnerabilities to social\nstress that may be specific to life course stages and relationship\nstressors. Disrupting various social relation deficits and physio-\nlogical risk connections could directly arrest early progression\ntoward chronic diseases and delay disease onset or lessen the\ndisease burden in late life. The findings, therefore, provide a strong\nscientific basis for effective prevention and intervention that will lead\nto further improvement in life expectancy.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe used longitudinal data from four nationally representative studies to test\npath C and collectively cover all stages of the life course depicted in de-\nvelopmental trajectory D (Fig. 1). Refer to Data Description for details on\ndata description.\nThe physical health biomarkers that we examine are continuous measures of\nCRP, systolic and diastolic BP, WC, and BMI, which represent important biological\npathways underlying stress response that strongly predict future disease and\nmortality (12). We also used categorical measures based on clinical cut points\nthat indicate the corresponding disease outcomes including inflammation, hy-\npertension, abdominal obesity, and obesity. Weighted descriptive statistics for\neach biomarker sample and dataset were reported in Table S1. For social re-\nlationship variables, we measured (i) social integration to capture the structural\nand quantitative components of relationships and (ii) social support and social\nstrain to assess the quality of social connections in terms of the functions these\nconnections served. Details on scale construction and descriptive statistics for\nrelationship variables are included in Table S2.\nWe conducted multivariate regression analyses to examine the prospective as-\nsociations between social relationship characteristics and biomarkers using the\nlongitudinal design unique to each dataset. For three studies where biomarkers\nwere assessed at the follow-up surveys only (Add Health, MIDUS, and HRS), we\nestimated models of biomarker outcomes in relation to social relationship measures\nassessed at prior points in time. Because the HRS included five waves of data on\nmost effectively summarize individual trajectories (19) (see Fig. S1 for HRS model\nspecification). The NSHAP provided repeated measures of three other biomarkers\nat both baseline and the follow-up, including BP, WC, and BMI. Therefore, we used\nlongitudinal residual change models to examine the effects of social relationships\nat wave I on changes in these biomarkers over time from wave I to wave II. This\ndesign offers a more rigorous test of potential causality, as it minimizes the risks of\nboth reverse causality and spuriousness (e.g., that some other variable is affecting\nboth biomarkers and social relationships). For each outcome variable, we estimated\nmodels in a stepwise fashion: (i) basic models of individual social relationship\nvariables adjusting for age, sex, and race; (ii) models of all social relation-\nship variables (when available for the samples) adjusting for age, sex, and\nrace; and (iii) full models adjusting for all covariates that are strong risk fac-\ntors for inflammation, metabolic, and cardiovascular dysregulation and may\ncontribute to their associations with social relationships. See Data, Measures,\nand Methods for a detailed description of analytic approaches for each\nsample and Table S3 for covariates included in fully adjusted models.\n"
