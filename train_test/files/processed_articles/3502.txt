Although relative height is also important, little research has\nbeen conducted to explore the association between sexual dimorphism and these aspects of\nromantic relationships. We examine whether sexual dimorphism is associated with\nsatisfaction, jealousy and mate retention behavior within established relationships.\nHeight, Mate Quality and Sexual Relationships\nMale stature provides important information about the quality of a potential mate.\nFor example, height provides an indication of both physical health and standard of living\n(Komlos and Baten, 1998; Persico, Postlewaite, and Silverman, 2004) and is related to\nestablished measures of genetic quality such as fluctuating asymmetry (Manning, 1995).\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nFurthermore, male stature is related to socioeconomic status and access to resources (Judge\nand tall men are perceived as more dominant and assertive than shorter men (Melamed,\n1992). These findings indicate that height may signal the possession of both physical and\nnon-physical qualities.\nCompared to the amount of male oriented height research, minimal research has\nbeen conducted to explore the potential role of female height. Silventoinen et al. (1999)\nhowever report that both tall and short women are susceptible to illness when compared to\nthose of medium height. For example, incidence of breast cancer has been related to female\nheight (Brinton and Swanson, 1992; Palmer et al., 1995). These findings suggest that\nmedium height women are advantaged compared to their tall or short rivals.\nThe association between height and the possession of valued characteristics has\ncontributed to the relationship between height and desirability as a mate. In particular,\nheight is associated with attractiveness (Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, and Ferdy, 2010), the\nability to attract a mate (Lynne and Shurgot, 1984), dating frequency (Shepperd and\nStrathman, 1989) and the attractiveness of the partner obtained (Feingold, 1982). Height\nmay also impact on overall reproductive success, as tall men are less likely to be childless\n(Nettle, 2002) and report a greater number of children (Mueller and Mazur, 2001) than\nshorter men.\nJealousy and Mate Retention\nThe association between height, attractiveness and reproductive success suggests\nthat height may also impact on emotions and behavior within established relationships. For\nboth men and women in long term relationships, extra-pair relationships and desertion\nrepresent substantial threats to reproductive success. In this context, jealousy may serve a\nnumber of adaptive functions (Buss, 2000; Buunk, Massar, and Dijkstra, 2007). The\nelicitation of jealousy may identify individuals or situations that threaten the existence or\nexclusivity of the existing relationship. The identification of a threatening individual or\nsituation may promote the use of mate retention behaviors intended to strengthen the pair\nbond or deter rivals (Buunk et al., 2007). This response (if elicited by an appropriate threat)\nmay promote reproductive success by reducing the likelihood of extra-pair relationships or\ntermination of the primary partnership. Jealousy may also promote positive aspects of the\nromantic relationship (Dugosh, 2000) if the jealousy is interpreted as a sign of commitment\nto the relationship or strength of feelings towards the partner. In addition, individuals that\nbelieve their partner is admired by a potential rival may raise their assessment of the\npartner's mate quality, increasing subsequent attraction or attentiveness.\nPrevious research has documented the manner in which height is related to jealousy\nand mate retention. Buunk, Park, Zurriaga, Klavina and Massar (2008) report that tall men\nare less jealous than short men when confronted with physically attractive or (physically or\nsocially) dominant rivals. In addition, Brewer and Riley (2009) found that tall men report\nlower levels of cognitive or behavioral jealousy than short men. Whilst the researchers\nfound no association between height and the overall use of mate retention strategies,\nrelationships were found with a number of specific mate retention behaviors. Tall and short\nmen were shown to engage in different mate retention behaviors. Specifically, tall men\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nwere less likely to use appearance enhancement or love and care to retain a partner, but\nwere more likely to employ vigilance, monopolization of time and jealousy induction. The\ntendency to use these mate retention tactics may indicate tall men's ability to adopt\nundesirable behavior without lowering their desirability as a mate. In contrast, shorter men\nare reluctant to reduce their own attractiveness and use tactics which enhance the\ndesirability of the current relationship. The relationship between female height and jealousy\nis less established. Buunk et al. (2007) demonstrate that female height is curvilinearly\nrelated to jealousy, with women of average height reporting the lowest levels of jealousy\nand partner's sexual interest in others. The researchers also found that women of average\nheight were less jealous of physically attractive rivals but reported increased jealousy of\n\"masculine\" rivals that were physically dominant with a high social status. The greater\njealousy of tall and short women when compared to women of medium height was\nsupported by Buunk, Pollet, Klavina, Figueredo and Dijkstra (2009).\nSexual Dimorphism in Stature (SDS)\nThe relative height of an individual, in relation to a partner, operationalized as\nsexual dimorphism in stature (SDS: male height / female height) is also important. Both\nmen and women adjust their preference for partner height in relation to their own stature\n(Fink, Neave, Brewer, and Pawlowski, 2007; Pawlowski, 2003). The importance placed on\nrelative, in addition to absolute height allows individuals to select a mate whose appearance\nis consistent with the male taller norm and maintain a relatively large pool of potential\nmates, whilst avoiding individuals at each extreme (i.e., extremely tall or short).\nFurthermore, the extent to which high or low SDS relationships are preferred is not static.\nResearch has identified a number of factors such as menstrual cycle stage and sexual\nstrategy (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) that influence women's preferred SDS.\nPrevious findings highlight the potential importance of SDS and suggest that\nadditional research exploring this variable would be beneficial. Those able to secure a\npartner with the optimum SDS (i.e., observing the male taller norm whilst avoiding extreme\ndifferences in height) may be more satisfied with their partner and subsequent relationship.\nThe level of SDS within a relationship may also influence a partner's jealousy and use of\nmate retention tactics. For example, men in low SDS relationships may feel threatened by\nthe number of rivals that may be attractive to their partner.\nThe Current Study\nThe manner in which absolute height impacts on behavior within a relationship has\nbeen investigated. A number of factors influencing the degree of SDS preferred in a\nrelationship have also been identified (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). However, little\ninformation exists about the potential influence of SDS on emotions and behavior within\nestablished relationships. The current study investigated the relationship between SDS and\nthe relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention behaviors reported by men and\nwomen.\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\ncurrent study. Individuals were recruited from the local community through opportunity\nsampling. All participants were in a romantic relationship at the time of the study. Men's\nProcedure\nParticipants were presented with a questionnaire which asked a range of\nautobiographical questions (age, own height and partner's height). Participants were then\nasked to rate their relationship satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = very\ndissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied). Participants were also asked to complete the 24 item\nMultidimensional Jealousy Scale (Pfeiffer and Wong, 1989), assessing cognitive (8 items),\nemotional (8 items) and behavioral (8 items) jealousy. Cognitive jealousy constitutes the\nindividual's appraisal of a situation, emotional jealousy concerns how a person responds to\npotentially provoking situations, and behavioral jealousy includes a range of behaviors\nintended to reduce a specific threat. Each subscale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha:\nfemale, .92). All items relating to jealousy were completed on a 7-point Likert scale.\nFinally, participants completed the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form (Buss,\nShackelford, and McKibbin, 2008), consisting of 38 items, rated on a 3-point Likert scale.\nThe scale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: male, .88, female, .87). The scale\ncaptured 19 different tactics (2 items per tactic). As shown in Table 1, each subscale of the\nquestionnaire was also largely reliable.\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nTable 1. Cronbach's alpha for each subscale of the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form\nMate Retention Subscale Male Female\nResults\nConsistent with previous research, the data generated by both male and female\nparticipants demonstrate a male taller norm. There was a correlation between participant\nheight and the height of their current partner. Controlling for age, these correlations were\nMultivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted to investigate SDS category\ndifferences in relationship behavior. The analyses were conducted separately for male and\nfemale participants. SDS categories were established on the basis of available data.\nConsequently, SDS was divided into six categories for male participants and only three\ncategories for female participants. The effects of age and absolute height were controlled\nfor during all analyses. For all findings the more robust Pillai's Trace is reported due to the\nrelatively small sample size and unequal N values.\nMale Emotions and Relationship Behavior\nA one-way between groups MANOVA was performed to investigate SDS category\ndifferences in male emotions and relationship behavior. Five dependent variables were\nselected: cognitive jealousy, emotional jealousy, behavioral jealousy, overall mate retention\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nbehaviors and relationship satisfaction. There was a statistically significant difference of\nWhen the results for the dependent variables were considered separately, the three\nSDS category differences to reach statistical significance were cognitive jealousy, F(5,75)\nleast cognitive and behavioral jealousy. Whilst significant, the pattern of relationship\nsatisfaction showed little consistency across SDS categories.\nTable 2.

Nineteen dependent variables (vigilance,\nconcealment of mate, monopolization of time, jealousy induction, punish mate's infidelity\nthreat, emotional manipulation, commitment manipulation, derogation of competitors,\nresource display, sexual inducements, appearance enhancement, love and care, submission\nand debasement, verbal possession signals, physical possession signals, possessive\nornamentation, derogation of mate, intra-sexual threats, and violence against rivals) were\nemployed.\nThere was a statistically significant difference of SDS categories on the combined\n.27. When the results for the dependent variables were considered separately, the three SDS\ncategory differences to reach statistical significance were vigilance, F(5,82) = 2.97, p <\np < .005. As shown in Table 3, men in high SDS relationships were more likely to use\nvigilance and monopolization of time to retain a partner than men in low SDS category\nrelationships. Love and care was most frequently used by men in either high or low SDS\nrelationships.\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nTable 3.

There was no statistically significant difference of\nTrace = .11, partial eta squared = .06.

Men in high SDS relationships reported the lowest levels of\ncognitive and behavioral jealousy, although the impact of SDS on relationship satisfaction\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nwas less clear. SDS was not associated with the overall use of mate retention strategies;\nSDS did however affect the use of three specific strategies (vigilance, monopolization of\ntime, love and care). Men in high SDS relationships were more likely to use vigilance and\nmonopolization of time than other men. Love and care was used most frequently by men in\nboth high and low SDS relationships.\nThese findings extend previous research (Brewer and Riley, 2009) detailing the\nrelationship between male height, jealousy and the use of mate retention behaviors.\nAdjusting the preference for partner height in relation to their own stature (Pawlowski,\n2003) allows men and women to select a mate whose appearance is consistent with the\nmale taller norm and avoid individuals at each height extreme whilst maintaining a\nrelatively large pool of potential mates. Consequently, men in high SDS relationships may\nencounter relatively few rivals that display a desirable SDS without extreme height, thus\nreducing the risk of cuckoldry or abandonment. The relative number of potential rivals may\naccount for the lower levels of cognitive and behavioral jealousy reported by men in high\nSDS relationships. The use of vigilance and monopolization of time by men in high SDS\nrelationships may reflect their greater size and strength in comparison to female partners.\nBoth tactics may be more effective when used by a physically intimidating partner. In\naddition, men in high SDS relationships may adopt undesirable retention behaviors,\nbelieving that they are at less risk of retaliation from the partner or a rival male.\nSDS did not affect women's relationship satisfaction, jealousy (cognitive,\nbehavioral or emotional) or the use of mate retention strategies (with the exception of\nresource display, which was most frequently used by women in high SDS relationships).\nThese results appear inconsistent with the aforementioned relationship between SDS and\nmale behavior. The dissociation between SDS and women's relationship behaviors was\nunexpected. These findings may however reflect the use of only three SDS categories for\nfemale participants, compared to the more diverse male sample that was divided into six\nSDS categories. Additional data collection (specifically targeting women in low and high\nSDS relationships) would be beneficial.\nWe tentatively offer an alternate explanation of this finding, focusing on the\nreproductive consequences of a successful high or low SDS reproductive relationship most\nacutely impacting on women. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) may lead to uterine\nrupture, operative delivery, maternal and fetal death (van Roosmalen and Brand, 1992), and\nremains a leading cause of obstetric complications in developing countries (Harrison,\nRossiter, and Chong, 1985). Short women are at increased risk of CPD (Aitken and Walls,\n1986; Sokal, Sawadogo, and Adjibade, 1991) and the relationship between maternal height\nand pregnancy outcome has been observed for all social classes (Thompson, 1959). Height\nis approximately 80% hereditary (Macgregor, Cornes, Martin, and Visscher, 2006;\nSilventoinen et al., 2003) however, and maternal height has been related to both birth\nproducing smaller infants. Despite the influence of maternal height, paternal height also\ninfluences the height (Alberman, Filakti, Williams, and Evans, 1991; Sichieri, Taddei, and\nEverhart, 2000) and weight (Shah et al., 2010) of the child. Specifically, infants fathered by\ntall men are taller and heavier than infants fathered by short men.\nTherefore, shorter women with taller male partners may have secured a high quality\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\npartner (with respect to physical health and socioeconomic status) but these (high SDS)\nrelationships may result in a greater risk of mortality or injury to the woman or child. In\ncontrast, women in low SDS relationships (where the man is perhaps shorter and\nsubsequently less attractive) may result in a less problematic childbirth. Consequently,\nthere appears to be a trade-off between the selection of a tall man (whose height may\nindicate mate quality, resource acquisition, status etc) and the risks associated with CPD.\nAdditional research exploring this hypothesis is recommended. In particular, the extent to\nwhich the risks of maternal and child mortality impact on both male and female\nreproductive success should be investigated.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe current study relies on the accuracy of participant responses. The reliability of\nself-reported height has been documented (Himes and Roche, 1982) and the use of self-\nreported height is consistent with previous research (e.g., Pawlowski, 2003). The\nlimitations of this approach and the greater accuracy afforded by direct measurements are\nhowever acknowledged. In particular, the widespread Western preference for relationships\nin which the man is taller (reported by men and women; Gillis and Avis, 1980) may\nencourage participants to artificially inflate differences between their own and their\npartner's height. In addition, the association between male height, attractiveness and\nsocioeconomic status (Judge and Cable, 2004; Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) may increase\nthe likelihood that the male height reported is similarly inflated.\nThe current study investigated the relationship between SDS and behavior in a\nWestern post-industrial society. This is consistent with previous research addressing the\nrole of height and SDS (e.g., Fink, et al., 2007). Previous research has found no evidence\nfor the male taller norm or relationship between male height and reproductive success in a\ntraditional community (Sear and Marlowe, 2009). The results of this study cannot be\ngeneralized to non-Western cultures therefore and additional cross-cultural research is\nrequired.\nThe current study investigated the relationship between SDS and jealousy, and\nconsidered three elements of the jealous response in particular. We did not however explore\nthe relative impact of different jealousy evoking scenarios. Previous research has clearly\ndocumented the manner in which men are more reactive to sexual infidelity and women are\nmore responsive to emotional infidelity (Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin, 2006;\nThomson, Patel, Platek, and Shackelford, 2007). Future research could investigate whether\nattentiveness to specific stimuli is influenced by the SDS within a relationship.\nThe recruitment of participants in a current relationship was intended to reduce\nmemory bias and avoid reliance on participants' ability to predict behavior. Despite the\nanonymity of the study and the involvement of only one member of the relationship pair,\nparticipants may have been reluctant to disclose dissatisfaction with their current\nrelationship, or the use of socially undesirable mate retention strategies. Additional\nresearch is required to address this issue. In particular, more detailed assessments of\nrelationship quality and behavior are recommended. Longitudinal data outlining the manner\nin which an individual's behavior may vary when in relationships with different levels of\nSDS would be particularly informative. Research of this type could also detail the manner\nSDS, jealousy, and mate retention\nin which the association between SDS and male behavior develops. Conclusions that may\nbe drawn about the causal nature of relationships between absolute height and behavior are\nnot possible when investigating SDS. For example, although SDS may influence a man's\nbehavior within the relationship, his initial personality and behavior may impact on both his\nselection of a partner and his later behavior towards her.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the current study finds that men in high SDS relationships reported the\nlowest levels of cognitive and behavioral jealousy, although the impact of SDS on\nrelationship satisfaction was less clear. SDS was not associated with the overall use of mate\nretention strategies; SDS did however affect the use of three specific strategies (vigilance,\nmonopolization of time, love and care). SDS did not affect women's relationship\nsatisfaction, jealousy (cognitive, behavioral or emotional) or the use of mate retention\nstrategies (with the exception of resource display). It is tentatively suggested that the\ndissociation between SDS and women's behavior within the relationship reflects a trade-off\nbetween the qualities associated with male height and the greater risk of difficulties during\nchildbirth.\nReferences\nAitken, I.
