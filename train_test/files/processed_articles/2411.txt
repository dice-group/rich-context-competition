Through their thoughts,\nfeelings, and actions people help to perpetuate the cultures of which they are a part\n(Markus and Kitayama 2010). The culture variation that has been the focus of most\nresearch and is the focus here is between the European American cultural contexts\nand those of Japan. Of course, variation in behavior is also a function of many other\ncultures with which people interact, including those of region, race/ethnicity, social\nclass, religion, gender, and generational status. In this article, we bring a targeted\nfocus to cultural variation between two contexts (Japan and the U.S.) and how it\nmatters for inequalities in health linked to socioeconomic status.\nStatus hierarchies exist in all societies across all cultural contexts and are\nprominent in most animal species. Increasingly, status hierarchies are recognized as\nimportant influences on health. In humans, socioeconomic standing has been shown\nto influence how long and how well people live (i.e., years without chronic\nconditions and disabilities) (Adler and Rehkopf 2008; Marmot 2005). Despite these\nrealities, the role of cultural context in understanding how status hierarchies matter\nfor health is not well understood. That limitation is the overarching issue motivating\nthis article. We review evidence from both U.S. and Japanese research, giving\nemphasis to ways in which the cultural context shapes the nature of the health\ninequalities observed. How psychosocial and biological factors combine to reveal\nwhy those at lower levels of socioeconomic hierarchies often have poorer health is\nan overarching theme.\nC.

Ryff et al.\nFindings from the U.S. are based on the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) investigation,\nand findings from Japan are based on the Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) study. MIDUS was\ninitiated in 1995 with a national probability sample of over 7,000 U.S. adults aged\nwith a probability sample of over 1,000 adults aged 30\u00ad79 from the city of Tokyo. Both\nstudies collected a wide array of demographic, psychological and social data.\nComprehensive biological measures were also obtained on subsamples of respondents\nin both countries (U.S. biological subsample = 1,255; Japanese biological sub-\nsample = 382) who visited health clinics. The U.S. study included a neuroscience\nsubsample (n = 332) as well, for which there was no equivalent in Japan. Overall, the\nMIDUS and MIDJA studies are notable in cultural research because they are based on\nprobability samples, thus enriching the socioeconomic heterogeneity of respondents,\nincluding wide age diversity, as well as the parallel data collection that was carried out\nacross multiple biopsychosocial domains.\nThe material that follows is organized into three sections. The first section distills\nevidence from MIDUS that clarifies how psychosocial factors contribute to health\ninequalities in the U.S. Some studies identify psychosocial factors that exacerbate the\nadverse health effects of low status positions, while others point to buffering influences\nthat protect disadvantaged individuals from succumbing to poorer health. The second\nsection highlights emerging findings from MIDJA on socioeconomic gradients in\nhealth in the Japanese context. Emphasis is given to how these patterns are distinct\nfrom what has been observed in the U.S. Although social inequalities exist in both\ncontexts, there are important differences in how they are manifest. These variants\nunderscore the critical role of culture in shaping, via complex biopsychosocial\npathways, the impact of socioeconomic inequality on people's lives and their health.\nThe third section details promising directions for future inquiries situated at the\ninterface of culture, inequality, and health, including possible socioeconomic\ndifferences in health behaviors and practices in the two countries. The promise of\nbrain-based studies to explicate mechanisms underlying cultural similarities and\ndifferences in health inequalities is noted as a priority going forward.\nSocial inequalities in health: evidence from MIDUS\nMIDUS was launched in 1995 with a national sample of over 7,000 U.S. adults aged\npsychological and social factors in understanding how people age across the decades\nof adult life. Approximately 10 years later, the National Institute on Aging funded a\nlongitudinal follow-up, which included substantial extensions of the scientific content\nto include in-depth cognitive, biological, and neuroscience assessments. Today, the\nenterprise has grown to include comprehensive data collection on nearly 12,000 U.S.\nadults who are being followed longitudinally. More than 600 publications from\nMIDUS have appeared in more than 180 scientific journals (see www.midus.wisc.\nedu). A key theme, among many active areas of inquiry, is health inequalities--how\nthose at the lower end of educational, economic, or occupational status hierarchies\nhave poorer health relative to their more advantaged counterparts, with emphasis on\nCulture, inequality, and health\nexplicating intervening processes. A related theme has been resilience in the face of\ninequality; that is, how some are able to maintain good health despite having low social\nstatus.\nAn early analysis by Lachman and Weaver (1998) showed that individuals with\nlower income had worse self-reported health, more depressive symptoms, and lower\nlevels of life satisfaction, when compared to those with higher levels of income.\nHowever, showing the protective influence of psychological factors, the authors\nfurther reported that the links between income and health were moderated by\nrespondents' sense of control (mastery). At low levels of mastery, the usual economic\ngradients in health and well-being were evident. However, at high levels of mastery,\nthe economic gradients disappeared, such that disadvantaged individuals looked\ncomparable to their high income counterparts on measures of health, depressive\nsymptoms, and life satisfaction. Subsequent work by O'Brien (2012) used the MIDUS\nlongitudinal data to investigate whether control beliefs, social support, and social\nstrain moderated the links between educational status and changes in health over time.\nAmong those low in educational status, low levels of social strain predicted fewer\nincrements in functional limitations. Alternatively, among those high in educational\nstatus, higher level of control predicted fewer increments in depressive symptoms\nacross time. Across all educational groups, those reporting high control and low social\nstrain at baseline showed fewer increments in chronic conditions approximately a\ndecade later. More recently, control beliefs assessed at baseline were found to predict\nlower risk of mortality 9\u00ad10 years later, a relationship that was strongest among those\nwith low educational standing (Turiano et al. 2014). Psychological factors were thus\nclearly relevant for understanding dynamic changes in health, although how they\nmattered depended on one's position in the educational hierarchy.\nThanks to the diverse biological measures collected at MIDUS II on a subsample\nof respondents, it has been possible to link educational standing to differing factors\nknown to be part of causal pathways to various disease outcomes. Interleukin-6 (IL-\n6), for example, is a physiological marker of pro-inflammatory activity, which can\nbe readily measured in blood, and is involved in the etiology of numerous diseases\n(e.g., cardiovascular, Type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, autoimmune conditions such\nas rheumatoid arthritis, and within the brain, the pathobiology of Alzheimer's).\nMorozink et al. (2010) replicated prior findings showing that those with lower levels\nof education had higher levels of IL-6. However, they further showed that this effect\nwas moderated by various aspects of psychological well-being, such as purpose in\nlife, environmental mastery, positive relations with others, self-acceptance, and\npositive affect. Interaction patterns revealed that at low levels of well-being, the\nusual educational gradient in IL-6 was evident; however, at high levels of reported\nwell-being, the educational gradient in levels of IL-6 was absent or notably reduced.\nThese patterns held after adjusting for other sociodemographic factors, medication\nuse and a number of health conditions. In sum, possessing higher levels of multiple\naspects of well-being was protective against having elevated IL-6 among those with\nlow levels of educational attainment.\nMIDUS has examined negative psychological factors as well, such as anger.\nStyles of how individuals deal with anger (expressing anger outwardly, holding\nanger in, controlling anger) have been delineated. Some aspects of anger may be\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nfueled by injustices and blocked goals that characterize life at the bottom of\nsocioeconomic hierarchies, suggesting that anger expression may be a pathway that\naccentuates health risks among those who are educationally disadvantaged. Boylan\nand Ryff (2013) tested this idea with the individuals in MIDUS who participated in\nthe biomarker project so as to focus on two pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6,\nfibrinogen) in the blood stream. As predicted, among those with a high school\neducation or less, higher levels of expressing anger (anger out) were associated with\nelevated levels of IL-6 as well as the clotting factor fibrinogen. Fibrinogen has been\nincluded in many epidemiological studies, as it is associated with cardiovascular\ndisease; high fibrinogen levels increase the viscosity of the blood. Findings also\nshowed that anger control was associated with lower IL-6 among educationally\ndisadvantaged women, but not men. These patterns were evident after adjusting for\ndemographic factors, medication use, and a number of disease conditions. Thus,\nanger expression was shown to exacerbate the link between low educational\nstanding and two inflammatory markers, while high anger control was found to\nattenuate risk for elevated IL-6 among less educated women.\nResilience in the face of social inequality has also been linked with biological\noutcomes. Miller et al. (2011) used MIDUS to investigate associations between\nchildhood poverty and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Metabolic\nsyndrome is comprised of multiple risk factors for poor health (high blood pressure,\nimpaired glucose control, central adiposity measured by waist circumference, and\nlipid dysregulation). Collectively, these factors increase the risk for cardiovascular\ndisease and Type 2 diabetes, two illnesses strongly reflective of SES disparities in\nhealth in the U.S. Using parental educational as an indicator of childhood\ndisadvantage, the findings first showed that respondents with less educated parents\nwere at higher risk for metabolic syndrome (assessed both categorically and in terms of\nnumbers of metabolic syndrome components) in midlife compared to respondents\nwith better educated parents. However, this educational gradient was moderated by\nwhether respondents reported having a nurturing mother in childhood. Among those\nwith low maternal nurturance, the components of metabolic syndrome were highest\namong adults with less educated parents. However, among those reporting that they\nhad a nurturing mother, the educational gradient in metabolic syndrome was no longer\nevident. Thus, high maternal nurturance in childhood offered protection against risk of\nmetabolic syndrome in adult life for those who came from socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged family backgrounds.\nOther investigators have used MIDUS to investigate the relevance of additional\npsychological factors, namely, personality traits, in understanding educational\ngradients in health outcomes and health behaviors. That is, position in social\nhierarchies brings social structural influences into the health arena, whereas personality\ntraits bring individual different factors into the prediction of health outcomes.\nChapman et al. (2010) argued that socioeconomic factors and personality traits should\nbe considered together in examining antecedents of mortality. Specifically, they found\nthat 20 % of the SES gradient in mortality was explained by personality traits, such as\nneuroticism, extraversion, or conscientiousness. Neuroticism positively influences\nmortality risk, whereas extraversion and conscientiousness negatively influence\nmortality risk. Alternatively, only 8 % of the personality risk accounting for mortality\nCulture, inequality, and health\nwas explained using SES factors. Similarly, Chapman et al. (2009) called for an\nintegrated perspective on factors that predict smoking behavior. Low educational\nstanding is a known risk factor for smoking, but growing evidence implicates\npersonality traits as well--conscientiousness has been shown to reduce risk of\nsmoking, whereas neuroticism and openness increase risk of smoking. Their analyses\ndocumented that both educational status and personality traits were relevant (after\nadjusting for numerous confounds) in accounting for who smokes. Such results\nunderscore the importance of considering both individual difference factors (traits) as\nwell as educational standing in formulating effective prevention or intervention\nprograms to reduce the prevalence of smoking in the U. S. How such findings may be\nrelevant for understanding smoking patterns in Japan is examined in the section on\nfuture research directions.\nOther publications from MIDUS not reviewed here add to the growing evidence\non social inequalities in health (see www.midus.wisc.edu). There is also an\nemerging international literature on this topic (Adler and Rehkopf 2008; Kawachi\nunderstanding socioeconomic disparities in health remains largely unexplored.\nMIDUS showcases the importance of psychosocial factors in exacerbating, or\nmitigating the health risks associated with SES hierarchies, and in so doing, offers a\nuseful vantage point for considering cultural influences. Research on cultural psy-\nscores the importance of possible cultural variants in which psychological or social\nfactors moderate or mediate SES influences on health. Cultural factors may also be\nrelevant in identifying which psychosocial factors are most likely to ``get under the\nskin''--that is, are linked with the dysregulation of physiological systems. Further,\nhealth behaviors are known to vary by one's position in the social hierarchy, but\nwhether such findings generalize across cultural contexts is not well understood.\nEmerging findings from MIDJA, based on middle-aged and older adults in Japan,\nare beginning to address these questions.\nSocial inequalities in health: evidence from MIDJA\n30\u00ad79) from the Tokyo metropolitan area in Japan. Survey data were collected to\nparallel the sociodemographic, psychosocial and self-reported health data from\nMIDUS. In addition, biomarker data were collected on a subsample of respondents\nto parallel a subset of the biological assessments obtained from the MIDUS\nbiomarker sample. Prior to launching data collection from the representative sample\nfrom Tokyo, pilot data were collected on about 500 adults from a convenience\nsample of Japanese adults. Publications from both the pilot sample and the main\nMIDJA sample are described below.\nAn initial publication comparing MIDJA and MIDUS findings focused on\nconstructs of independence and interdependence as culturally unique predictors of\nhealth. Using the MIDJA pilot sample in combination with the MIDUS baseline\nsample, Kitayama et al. (2010) investigated two hypotheses to test the strength of\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nthe linkage between culture, psychological well-being and health. The first\nhypothesis was that people are motivated to achieve culturally sanctioned goals\nrelevant in their societies--namely, independence (personal control) is the\nimportant goal in the U.S., whereas interdependence (relational harmony) is the\nmandated goal in Japan. Specifically, it was predicted that people's reported level of\nperceived constraints (i.e., not being able to do what they wanted to do), would be\nmost strongly influenced by compromised personal control in the U.S., whereas in\nJapan, it would be more strongly predicted by strained social relationships. The\nempirical findings supported these predictions.\nThe second hypothesis was that reports of health and well-being would be more\nstrongly predicted by independence in the U.S., but by interdependence in Japan.\nUsing a composite index of health and well-being, the obtained findings showed that\npersonal control was the stronger predictor of the composite health outcome in the\nU.S., whereas relational strain was the stronger predictor in Japan. These analyses\ncontrolled for age, gender, educational status, and a number of personality traits.\nNot examined, but a useful query for social inequalities research would involve\ninvestigating whether independence is the primary mediator of class/health linkages\nin the U.S., whereas interdependence may be the key mediator of such linkages in\nJapan.\nMiyamoto and Ryff (2011) used the MIDJA pilot sample along with the MIDUS\nbaseline sample to investigate cultural differences in emotional styles and their\nimplications for health. Extending prior cross-cultural research, they found that\nJapanese adults were more likely to report experiencing both positive and negative\nemotions with moderate frequency, something known as a ``dialectical emotional\nstyle,'' which underscored the middle way of emotional experience in East Asian\ncultural contexts. U.S. adults, in contrast, were more likely to experience a\npreponderance of positive emotion and a paucity of negative emotion. These\ndiffering emotional profiles were analyzed along with self-reported health\nsymptoms to test the hypothesis that a dialectical emotional style would predict\nbetter health in Japan, but not in the U.S. The empirical findings supported this\nhypothesis; thereby documenting that Japanese adults were more likely to\nexperience a balance of positive and negative emotions compared to U.S. adults,\nand further that this balanced emotional style was linked with fewer health\nsymptoms for Japanese compared to U.S. adults. The investigation did not consider\nvariation by socioeconomic standing, although a relevant question is whether\ndialectical emotion styles mediate or moderate the impact of SES on health in\nJapan, whereas non-dialectical emotion styles may serve to mediate or moderate\nSES-related health effects in the U.S.\nUsing only the MIDUS data, Fujiwara and Kawachi (2008) linked the concept of\nsocial capital, construed as a kind of interdependence (given its emphasis on trust,\nsense of belonging, and mutual aid) to the likelihood of developing major\ndepression over time. Their analysis supported the prediction that U.S. adults with\nhigher levels of social capital were less likely to develop major depression over\ntime, after taking sociodemographic factors, physical health status and the trait of\nextraversion into account. This kind of inquiry could be enriched by consideration\nof cultural influences; that is, social capital may be especially important in\nCulture, inequality, and health\nprotecting against mental health impairments in interdependent cultures. Consistent\nwith this formulation, Park et al. (2013a, b) used the MIDUS and MIDJA data to\nshow that the link between social support (as an index of interdependence) and self-\nreported physical health was stronger for Japanese adults, especially when they were\nunder high life stress (i.e., in a support-justifying situation), compared to Americans.\nBuilding on the findings in the U.S. highlighting the interplay of SES, anger, and\nhealth, Park et al. (2013a, b) brought culture into the theoretical framework to\nexamine cultural specificity in the association between social status and anger\nexpression. They drew on U.S. findings showing that those with lower social status\nreport more anger, presumably related to frustrations associated with unequal access\nto resources and opportunities as well as increased stress exposure among the\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged. Anger in Japan, in contrast, is more culturally\nrestricted, given the concerns about its potential to disrupt social harmony and\nrelationships. Japanese culture thus places a greater emphasis on the suppression\nand control of these types of negative emotions. However, not everyone is expected\nto suppress anger within Japanese society--those with high social status are given\ncultural license or authorization to express anger. Consistent with this formulation, a\ncomparison of MIDJA and MIDUS II respondents showed that Americans with\nlower social standing (measured both objectively and subjectively) expressed more\nanger. Further, this relationship between status and anger was mediated by self-\nreported frustration. In contrast, and in keeping with the assumption that higher\nsocial standing affords a privilege to display anger in Japan, adults in MIDJA with\nhigher social status were found to express more anger. This relationship between\nstatus and anger expression was mediated by decision-making authority. It was also\nfound that anger expression was explained by subjective status among Americans,\nbut by objective social status (i.e., education, occupational status) among Japanese\nadults. This distinction was elaborated in the study below.\nHierarchies can be defined objectively, by educational attainment or income, as\nwell as subjectively, by people's perception of their standing vis-a\n`-vis others in their\ncommunity. Curhan et al. (2014) used MIDJA and MIDUS to examine how these two\nperspectives on social hierarchy predicted psychological well-being. Although both\nobjective and subjective hierarchical assessments have been linked with psychological\nwell-being in the U.S., no prior research had examined such linkages from a cultural\nperspective on how social status is understood and conferred. Drawing on the\nindependent model of the self, which is prominent in the U.S., the hypothesis was that\nsubjective perceptions of social status would more strongly influence well-being\nbecause individuals' perceptions are seen as primary determinants of thoughts and\nfeelings. In contrast, according to the interdependent model of the self that is typical\nand culturally appropriate in Japan, people are seen as fundamentally connected to\nothers. In this context, personal thoughts and feelings are secondary to social\napproval, including how one is seen in the eyes of others. In such contexts, objective\nbenchmarks of social standing, which signal community respect, are likely to be more\ninfluential in predicting reported well-being. As hypothesized, subjectively perceived\nsocial status was more strongly predictive of life satisfaction, positive affect, sense of\npurpose, and self-acceptance in the U.S. compared to Japan. Alternatively, objective\nsocial status (i.e., educational attainment) was more strongly predictive of life\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nsatisfaction, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance in Japan than in the\nU.S. These findings underscored the importance of considering objective and\nsubjective indicators of position in social hierarchies when studying social inequalities\nin health across cultures.\nPsychological resources, such as one's sense of control, self-esteem, or optimism,\nare usefully examined as mediators of the links between position in social\nhierarchies and health. Kan et al. (2014) investigated these questions by comparing\ndata from MIDJA and MIDUS. Their investigation incorporated both objective (i.e.,\neducational attainment) and subjective assessments of social status, and linked them\nto self-rated health and number of chronic illness conditions. Given the foregoing\nfindings, the hypothesis was that self-esteem and sense of control would more\nstrongly mediate the relationships between social status and health in the U.S. than\nin Japan. This prediction was supported for self-esteem, which was found to mediate\nthe links between objective and subjective status and health outcomes in the U.S.,\nbut few parallel effects were evident in Japan. Alternatively, sense of personal\ncontrol was found to mediate both types of status and health outcomes in Japan as\nwell as the U.S. Optimism also significantly mediated most associations of social\nstatus and health in both countries, but only among females. Neuroticism, a trait that\nmay be accentuated by the absence of psychological resources, was also found to\nmediate associations between social status and health in both countries, except for\nthe predictions of chronic conditions among Japanese women. These findings thus\npointed to similarities as well as differences across cultures in how psychological\nfactors influence pathways connecting social status to health. That self-esteem was a\nmediator in the U.S., but not in Japan may reflect the cultural emphasis on self-\ncriticism in Japan. We note that the mediators examined in this study reflected a\nlargely Western conception of psychological resources. Future research might\ntherefore usefully examine whether factors such as social harmony or social\nobligation have greater prominence as mediators in Japan.\nBringing biological mechanisms into cultural studies of health offers useful\ninsights into which psychological factors are implicated in linkages between mind\nand body. An important theme in cultural studies has been that negative emotions\nare construed as more problematic in Western contexts, and indeed, have been\nfound to be predictors of the risk for cardiovascular disease (Kubzansky and\nKawachi 2000), cancer (Penninx et al. 1998) and mortality (Pinquart and Duberstein\n2010). Biological pathways linking these negative emotions to disease outcomes are\nbeginning to be explicated. One such pathway involves an exacerbation of pro-\ninflammatory processes. Cultural studies are critical to test whether these linkages\nare universal across countries as well as across different ethnic and racial groups.\nThe growing literature on how emotions are differently construed and accompanied\nby differing normative expectations suggests that cultural specificity may be\nevident. Building on Miyamoto and Ryff (2011), which characterized negative\nemotion in Western contexts as something to be avoided, whereas in Asian contexts,\nnegative emotions are accepted and recognized as necessary for mature adult\ndevelopment, Miyamoto et al. (2013) tested the hypothesis was that negative\nemotion would predict elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the\nU.S., but not in Japan. Data from the MIDUS and MIDJA biomarker samples\nCulture, inequality, and health\nconfirmed this prediction. Respondents indicated how often in the past 30 days they\nhad felt a number of negative emotions (e.g., sad, hopeless, worthless, nervous,\nrestless, that everything was an effort). After adjusting for sociodemographic\nfactors, personality traits, positive emotions, health behaviors, and chronic\nconditions, the findings showed that a person's cultural background moderated\nthe experience of negative emotion and IL-6. Only in the U.S. did higher levels of\nnegation emotion predict elevated IL-6 levels. Thus, the influence of cultural\ncontext must be considered when linking negative emotion to pro-inflammatory\nmarkers. Related research (e.g., Pressman et al. 2013), however, has shown that both\npositive and negative emotions are linked to self-reported health across cultural\ncontexts, suggesting that self-rated health may be colored by one's emotional state.\nWhen objective markers (such as IL-6) are employed, however, our findings did not\nsupport a strong negative emotion to health link in Japan. Further inquiry is needed\nto clarify whether negative emotions are less physiologically costly in Japan perhaps\nbecause they are construed as acceptable, and indeed, necessary components of\nnormal adult life. Longitudinal inquiries are also needed to sharpen the\nunderstanding of causal relations between emotions and biological risk factors.\nMore recent work (Kitayama et al. 2015) extended the analysis above with a\nspecific focus on anger expression. In this MIDJA/MIDUS investigation, culture\nwas hypothesized to moderate the link between anger expression and a composite\nindex of biological health risk, which included two pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6\nand CRP) and two indices of cardiovascular dysfunction (high systolic blood\npressure and a poor cholesterol profile). Because prior findings (Park et al. 2013a, b)\nshowed that anger was differentially experienced and expressed in each country\n(i.e., more common among low status adults in the U.S., but high status adults in\nJapan), we expected that anger might be associated with increased biological risk in\nthe U.S., but the opposite effect in Japan, namely decreased biological risk. After\nadjusting for demographic factors, health status, and health behaviors, cultural\ncontext was found to moderate, as predicted, the link between anger expression and\nthe indices of biological risk. Further, the pattern held even after adjusting for\ndifferences in social status, measured both objectively and subjectively. Thus, the\ncultural moderation was largely independent of social status. Other factors, as yet to\nbe identified, may account for why high anger expression is associated with\nbiological risk among U.S. adults, but can be health-enhancing among Japanese\nadults.\nTo summarize, MIDJA and MIDUS have advanced understanding of how culture\nmoderates the influence of psychosocial factors on health and well-being. Not all of\nthese analyses have focused on inequality, but the extant work does demonstrate\nthat there are cultural differences in how much hierarchies (measured objectively\nand subjectively) matter for health. Further, the studies show that position in the\nsocial hierarchy can influence the expression of particular emotions, such as anger,\nin ways that are culturally distinct. Further research is needed to replicate and\nextend these lines of inquiry, including to other countries and cultures. The final\nsection below addresses useful future directions for advancing knowledge on social\ninequalities in health in ways that are informed by a culturally sensitive perspective.\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nPromising directions for future inquiry\nAlthough extensive research, including international studies, has been generated on\nhealth inequalities, how cultural context influences the ways in which socioeco-\nnomic hierarchies matter for health has received limited attention. This omission is\nnotable, given that culture likely pervades many core questions about whether\npsychosocial factors act as protective or exacerbating influences among disadvan-\ntaged members of society. In what follows, two lines of research showing promise\nfor future studies are outlined. The first focuses on the need to bring health\nbehaviors into research on culture, inequality, and health, and the second addresses\nwhat neuroscience might contribute to this integrative research agenda.\nCulture, inequality and health behaviors\nHealth behaviors are strongly implicated in understanding social inequalities in\nmorbidity and mortality. Those at the lower end of the socioeconomic hierarchy,\nespecially in the U.S., engage in more compromising behaviors, such as overeating,\nsometimes in response to stress (Tsenkova et al. 2013), smoking (Chapman et al.\n(Mezick et al. 2008; Van Cauter and Spiegel 1999). An important issue is whether\nthere are cultural differences in the patterning of these health behaviors by social\nstatus, and relatedly, whether there are cultural differences in psychosocial and\nemotional factors that may be antecedents to unhealthy behaviors. An interesting\nexample is smoking, a health behavior of known risk for cancer and heart disease\nthat is disproportionately evident among the less educated segments of the U.S.\nMIDUS and MIDJA offer contrasting perspectives on educational status and\nsmoking (Ryff 2014a). For example, in the U.S., better educated adults are less\nlikely to have ever smoked compared to less educated adults. In contrast, in Japan,\nadults with more education are more likely to have ever smoked compared to less\neducated adults. Distinctions are also evident when examining who has quit\nsmoking as a function of educational status: among those who ever smoked, about\n80 % of college educated U.S. adults report no longer smoking, compared to 50 %\nof college educated Japanese adults. Further, rates of smoking cessation are lower\namong high-school or less educated adults, but again, there are notable differences\nby country: over 60 % of less educated U.S. adults who ever smoked are not\ncurrently smoking, compared to over 40 % in Japan. Gender also exerts a prominent\ninfluence on smoking behavior: those smoking the greatest number of cigarettes per\nday in Japan are college educated men, whereas Japanese women with a college\neducation smoke the least. In the U.S., those smoking the greatest number of\ncigarettes are high school educated men, whereas college educated women, as in\nJapan, smoke the least.\nLargely unexplored and therefore notably ripe for scientific inquiry are studies of\nthe psychological and social factors that may increase or decrease the likelihood of\nsmoking, and whether such influences vary by cultural context. Negative emotions,\nfor example, may fuel smoking to a greater extent in the U.S. than in Japan. It is also\nCulture, inequality, and health\npossible that susceptibility to smoking depends on culturally specific meanings of\nsmoking. If smoking is recognized largely as a health risk, educational attainment\nmay lead to reduced smoking, as in the U.S. But smoking may also be a means to\nexpress masculinity and show social or personal prowess. If so, men, especially\nthose who have access to power, may smoke more--a pattern that may be\napplicable in Japan. More research is needed to understand how these cultural and\ncontextual (e.g., workplace) factors influence smoking as well as smoking cessation.\nFindings from the previously described U.S. research (Chapman et al. 2009) suggest\nthat individual difference variables, such as personality traits (neuroticism,\nopenness), may amplify tendencies to smoke, whereas others (conscientiousness)\nmay reduce risk of smoking. Such patterns may not generalize to Japan, if smoking\nhas different cultural meanings in that context and is possibly a behavior indicating\nstrength or masculinity.\nCultural influences on diet and nutrition are a current focus in MIDUS and\nMIDJA (Levine et al. 2014, unpublished manuscript). Both studies collected data on\nhealthy eating, defined in terms of consumption of white to red meat, non-meat\nprotein, and fruit and vegetables. A core idea guiding the analysis was that\nindependence, which captures the sense of agency and individualism prominent in\nthe U.S., would better predict healthy eating in the U.S. Alternatively, interdepen-\ndence, which captures the fundamental other-connectedness and importance of\nsocial relationships in Japan, would better predict healthy eating in Japan. These\npredictions were supported. In addition, findings showed that the obtained linkages\nwere mediated by culture-specific factors. Sense of control served as the mediator of\nthe link between independence and healthy eating in the U.S., whereas spousal\nsupport served as the mediator of the link between interdependence and healthy\neating in Japan. Going forward, it would be useful to bring social status perspectives\ninto assessments of healthy eating across cultures. In the U.S., accessibility of\nhealthy food may be more closely linked with socioeconomic status (Walker et al.\n2010), whereas in Japan, healthy food may be more readily accessible to people\nfrom diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.\nAnother promising line of inquiry pertains to drinking. Useful questions are\nwhether patterns of drinking (age of first drinking, amount of alcohol consumption)\ndiffer between Japanese and U.S. adults, and further whether there are social\ngradients in such profiles in both countries. It would also be useful to incorporate\nconstructs of independence and interdependence to investigate the cultural\nmoderation of psychosocial factors that predict alcohol consumption. Finally, the\nuse of alternative therapies may be fruitful to pursue in comparing Western and East\nAsian cultural contexts. MIDUS assessed therapies such as acupuncture, biofeed-\nback, energy healing, herbal therapy, massage therapy, medication techniques, and\nspiritual practices. McMahan and Lutz (2004) used these data to examine what\nsociodemographic factors predicted the use of alternative and complementary\nmedicine among older adults (defined as ages 65\u00ad74). Educational standing was a\nsignificant positive predictor, as was higher income and being female. Because\nmany alternative therapies have their origins in Eastern cultures, it would be\ninformative to examine the prevalence of these practices in Japan as well, along\nwith whether education, income, or gender matter. And again, incorporating\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nconstructs of independence and interdependence into the formulations would\nstrengthen understanding of whether these practices are contoured by culturally-\nspecific formulations of the self.\nCulture, inequality, and the brain\nIn recent years, there have been calls for increased attention to the neurobiological\npathways through which socioeconomic position is linked to health. Gianaros and\nManuck (2010) considered neuropharmacological, molecular genetic, and neuro-\nimaging studies that hold promise for enhancing understanding of how the brain is\nimplicated in SES and health linkages. Using both human and animal models, they\nunderscored the scope of prior work connecting chronic stressors and mood systems\nto the brain, both of which are relevant for understanding the health consequences of\nsocial inequalities. Consistent with results highlighted above, they also emphasized\nthe importance of attending to subjective indicators of socioeconomic position.\nLower self-rated social status was linked, for example, to reduced gray matter\nvolume in the perigenual area of the anterior cingulate cortex (Gianaros et al. 2007),\nwhile perceiving that one's parents had low social standing was linked with greater\namygdala reactivity to threatening facial expressions (Gianaros et al. 2008).\nAlternatively, Hackman et al. (2010) approached the topic of socioeconomic\nstatus and the brain from an early life perspective, giving emphasis to the role of\nprenatal factors, parental care and cognitive stimulation, all possibly shaped by\nsocioeconomic standing, in a child's neurocognitive development. Hillman et al.\n(2008) further emphasize the importance of aerobic physical activity on cognition\nand brain function at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels.\nAlthough not explicitly focused on socioeconomic factors, their review encom-\npasses the life course (childhood, early adulthood, old age) and links lack of\nphysical activity to a major health problem (obesity) known vary by social strata.\nOutside the realm of social inequalities, there is growing interest in how brain-\nbased assessments of emotion regulation might be meaningfully linked to physical\nhealth. Song et al. (2014), for example, summarized emerging research on mind\u00ad\nbody interactions and called for more inquiry on the neural bases through which\nemotion regulation is linked to physical health. Working with a Chinese sample,\nthey used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to show that individuals who had\nmore gray matter (GM) volumes in the amygdala reported not only better emotion\nregulation (assessed with a stress management inventory), but also better self-rated\nphysical health. Further, they found that GM volume in the amygdala appeared to\nserve a mediating role in the association between emotion regulation ability and\nphysical health. Given that emotion regulation, as emphasized in preceding sections,\nmay take different forms in Western versus East Asian cultures, future research is\nneeded to examine whether the neural pathways linking emotion regulation to better\nphysical health in this Chinese sample will generalize to Western populations.\nOthers studies have examined the neural correlates of well-being. Lewis et al.\n(2014), for example, focused on insular cortex grey matter volume and showed\npositive links to several aspects of eudaimonic well-being, including purpose in life,\npersonal growth, and positive relations. Another study by Kong et al. (2014) used\nCulture, inequality, and health\nresting-state functional MRI to show different neural substrates (i.e., right posterior\nsuperior temporal gyrus, thalamus-insular connectivity) through which eudaimonic\nwell-being is associated with personality traits. Further neuroimaging research by\nvan Reekum et al. (2007) found that those who were faster to evaluate negative\ninformation showed greater activation of the amygdala, but such relationships were\nmoderated by reports of eudaimonic well-being: those with higher well-being were\nslower to evaluate the negative stimuli and evinced less activation of the amygdala;\nthey also showed increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. The overall\npattern suggested that people higher in well-being effectively recruit the ventral\nanterior circulate cortex when confronted with aversive stimuli, which may partially\naccount for their reduced activity in the amygdala and slower speed in evaluating\nthe information.\nNone of the preceding well-being studies addressed possible linkages to health,\nalthough many aspects of eudaimonic well-being, as reviewed by Ryff (2014b),\nhave been shown to predict morbidity, mortality, and biological risk factors.\nSimilarly, concern with cultural context is notably missing in the neuroscience work\ndescribed above, although MIDUS and MIDJA findings have underscored cultural\ndifferences in conceptions of well-being (see Ryff et al. 2014). These differences\nsuggest there may be cultural specificity in which aspects of reported well-being are\nmost strongly linked with grey matter volume, or with activity in the amygdala, or\nanterior cingulate cortex. Relational harmony may be a stronger neural correlate for\nJapanese adults than eudaimonic well-being. Such possibilities raise further queries\nregarding the generalizability of prior U.S. research, which has linked social\nneuroscience to health (Eisenberger and Cole 2012), or incorporated social support\nas a moderator of the link between threat-related amygdala reactivity and trait\nanxiety (Hyde et al. 2011). Undoubtedly, psychological and social experiences are\nimplicated in brain activity in all cultures, but whether there are cultural differences\nin the nature of such patterns is largely unexplored.\nWe conclude this section with recent neuroscience findings from MIDUS, which\nincludes a laboratory protocol that obtains brain-based measures of emotional\nreactivity and recovery on a subsample of U.S. respondents. Using the eyeblink\nstartle reflex (EBR), known to be sensitive to one's emotional state, Schaefer et al.\n(2013) examined links between purpose in life (a single aspect of eudaimonic well-\nbeing known to predict morbidity and mortality, see Ryff 2014b) and emotional\nrecovery from negative stimuli. The analyses differentiated between initial\nemotional reactivity (during stimulus presentation) and emotional recovery\n(occurring after stimulus offset). Greater purpose in life, assessed 2 years prior,\nwas found to predict better recovery from negative stimuli, after controlling for\ninitial reactivity, gender, age, trait affect, and other dimensions of well-being. The\nfindings suggested that one proximal mechanism through which purpose in life may\nafford protection from negative stressors is via enhanced autonomic regulation after\nnegative emotional provocation.\nAnother recent MIDUS study Heller et al. (2013) probed brain-based processes\nthat underlie well-being and incorporated assessments of neuroendocrine regulation.\nThe key focus was on the capacity of some individuals to engage the neural circuitry\nof reward for longer periods; this capacity may constitute part of overall well-being\nC. D. Ryff et al.\nand it may mediate links between well-being and adaptive biological regulation\n(measured in terms of cortisol output). Participants viewed positive, neutral, and\nnegative images while fMRI data were collected. Those showing sustained activity\nin the striatum and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex in response to positive stimuli\nreported higher well-being. In addition, they showed lower cortisol output,\nmeasured four times a day over 4 days. Overall the results pointed to neural\nmechanisms that possibly underlie the experience of high well-being, with\naccompanying contributions to adaptive regulation of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00ad\nadrenal axis.\nFinally, because MIDUS is longitudinal, it has been possible to link long-term\nprofiles of psychosocial factors to laboratory-based measures of emotional reactivity\nand recovery. Lapate et al. (2014) examined how prolonged marital stress, assessed\nover a 9\u00ad10 year period, was linked with reactivity to and recovery from emotional\nprovocation. Respondents watched positive, neutral, and negative pictures while an\nobjective measure of affective state known as supercilii muscle activity was\ncontinuously recorded. The findings indicated that marital stress among these\nmiddle-aged men and women was associated with short-lived responses to positive\npictures, indexed by less persistent decrease in corrugator activity after picture\noffset. The interpretation provided was that marital stress may impact emotional\nhealth over time by compromising brain-based processes involved in short-lived\nresponses to positive stimuli. Further, decreased maintenance of positive affect\nworked as a mediator of the link between marital strain and depressive symptoms.\nThe article also addressed possible neurobiological mechanisms through which\nprolonged exposure to a stressful social environment might alter affective responses\nto positive stimuli, such as reduced engagement of basal ganglia circuitry.\nRelevant cultural questions can be raised about all of the neuroscience findings\nfrom MIDUS. From a cultural perspective, it is useful to ask whether decreased\nmaintenance of positive affect is equally harmful for health across cultures. Asians\nare less likely than Americans to try to maintain positive emotions after\nexperiencing a positive event (Miyamoto and Ma 2011), suggesting that they may\nshow short-lived affective responses to positive pictures. Furthermore, decreased\nmaintenance of positive affect may be more weakly associated with stressful social\nenvironments or depressive symptoms in Asian cultural contexts, where positive\nemotions are less socially valued (Bastian et al. 2014).\nSimilarly, when culture is brought into the interplay of emotion and the brain, a\ndifferent aspect of emotion regulation, namely, emotional suppression may be\nimportant. Murata et al. (2013) found differences in European Americans and East\nAsians in electrocortical responses during a laboratory-based emotion suppression\ntask. Because Asians are culturally trained to control and suppress their emotional\nexpressions, the key hypothesis was that they would show greater decrease in the\nparietal late positive potential (LPP, an aspect of event related brain potential, ERP,\ninvolved in emotional processing) in a suppression task compared to an attend task\ncompared to European American respondents. Findings supported this prediction,\nthereby documenting the important role of culture in understanding brain-based\nassessments of emotional suppression. Thus, whatever may constitute the neural\nCulture, inequality, and health\nindicators of interest, the formulation of what defines effective emotional regulation\nmay well require specificity across cultural contexts.\nRegarding longitudinal relational experiences, a relevant cultural question is\nwhat kinds of psychosocial experience over time might be implicated in accounting\nfor changes laboratory-based assessments of emotional reactivity and recovery\namong Asians. Western indicators of marital strain focus on whether one's spouse is\na source of demands, criticism, tension/arguments, annoyance, and feelings of being\nlet down. Whether these are relevant indicators of marital stress in the Eastern\ncontext is unclear. Because negative emotion is construed to be more normative in\nsuch settings, such measures of tension and annoyance may simply be less\npredictive of neural signals, in the same way that negative emotion was shown\nabove to not be predictive of elevated IL-6 in Japan, even though such effects were\nevident in the U.S. (Miyamoto et al. 2013). What may be more informative in\ninterdependent cultures are relational components of well-being (e.g., sympathy,\nattunement to others). Unfortunately, MIDJA has not included a neuroscience\nproject to date, thus precluding investigation of these questions.\nReturning to the overarching question of health inequalities, it is important to\nconsider how linkages of psychosocial and emotional factors with brain-based\nprocesses might incorporate social status hierarchies as part of the overall\nformulation. Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals in Western studies are\nknown to have greater exposures to stress as well as poorer coping resources\n(Matthews and Gallo 2011). Findings from MIDUS have clarified how other\npsychological factors, may protect against (e.g., well-being), or amplify (e.g., anger)\nthe adverse health impacts of low socioeconomic standings. Findings from MIDJA\nhave clarified that status matters in Japan as well, but in ways that differ from the\nU.S. (e.g., anger is sanctioned among those high in status and is not linked to\nbiological risk factors). Much remains to be done to explicate the neural\nunderpinnings of these linkages among status, psychosocial factors, and biology.\nTo carry this agenda forward, it will be essential to bring socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged individuals into neuroscience laboratories across cultural contexts.\nThus, sampling heterogeneity must pertain not only to diverse cultural contexts, but\nalso to variability related to distinct positions in known social hierarchies.\nIn conclusion, there are many important future questions for science situated at\nthe interface of culture, inequality, and health. These directions, stimulated by\nemerging findings from MIDUS and MIDJA, speak to the fundamental role of\ncultural context in understanding the integration of behavior, psychological\nexperience, biology, neuroscience, and health. Bringing inequality into such\nexpansive inquiries serves as a reminder that in all Eastern and Western cultures,\nthere are layers of meaning and experience tied to differences in social status\nhierarchies. Understanding how life is construed by those with low compared to\nhigh status positions (e.g., Markus et al. 2004) is thus a complex, but worthy pursuit,\ngiven that status hierarchies appear to matter for health, via complex psychosocial\nand neurobiological pathways, across cultural contexts.\n"
