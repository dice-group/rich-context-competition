    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn important element in social interactions is predicting the goals of others, including the goals of others' manual\nactions. Over a decade ago, Flanagan and Johansson demonstrated that, when observing other people reaching for\nobjects, the observer's gaze arrives at the goal before the action is completed. Moreover, those authors proposed that\nthis behavior was mediated by an embodied process, which takes advantage of the observer's motor knowledge. Here,\nwe scrutinize work that has followed that seminal article. We include studies on adults that have used combined eye\ntracking and transcranial magnetic stimulation technologies to test causal hypotheses about underlying brain circuits.\nWe also include developmental studies on human infants. We conclude that, although several aspects of the embodied\nprocess of predictive eye movements remain to be clarified, current evidence strongly suggests that the motor system\nplays a causal role in guiding predictive gaze shifts that focus on another person's future goal. The early emergence of\nthe predictive gaze in infant development underlines its importance for social cognition and interaction.\n",

Rather, you fixate on the candy before the\nhand reaches it. This predictive gaze shift allows you to\novercome the internal processing lag of the perception-\naction system (i.e., the time it takes to perceive the sur-\nrounding world) and pay attention to important events as\nthey unfold. When you are after the same sweet, this\npredictive gaze provides the time you need to plan and\nexecute an action toward the goal. Without prediction,\nyour perception of the surrounding world would be frag-\nmented and lag behind real-world events, and you would\ncertainly never get hold of the candy. In short, the ability\nto perform predictive gaze shifts while observing actions\nis fundamental for successful interactions with the envi-\nthe overarching goal is to collaborate or compete.\nIt has long been known that predictive eye move-\nments play an important role in guiding our own actions.\nA large body of work has shown that predictive eye\nmovements are functionally integrated into most every-\nday actions that we perform (von Hofsten, 2004), includ-\ning reaching (Johansson, Westling, B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m, &\nVickers, 1996), and cooking (Hayhoe, Shrivastava,\nTypically, we move our eyes to a goal several hundred\nmilliseconds before that goal is reached. The exact timing\nof one's gaze depends on the task at hand (Land &\nHayhoe, 2001) and the proficiency of the actor (Abernethy,\nEmbodied Account of Predictive Eye\nMovements\nHowever, it was not until 2003 that Flanagan and\nJohansson (2003) discovered that predictive gaze shifts\nare not only important in guiding our own actions but\nare also integral to action observations--that is, observ-\ning another person's goal-directed actions. In their study,\nFlanagan and Johansson demonstrated that adults pre-\ndicted action goals by fixating on the end location of an\naction before it was reached, both when they executed\nan action themselves and when they observed someone\nCorresponding Author:\nGustaf Gredeb\u00e4ck, Department of Psychology, Uppsala University,\nE-mail: gustaf.gredeback@psyk.uu.se\nEye Movements During Action Observation\nGustaf Gredeb\u00e4ck1 and Terje Falck-Ytter1,2\n1Department of Psychology, Uppsala University, and 2Department of Women's and Children's Health,\nKarolinska Institutet\n Keywords\naction, performance, development: infant, neuroscience, social cognition\nelse executing an action (the task involved moving three\nsmall blocks in the coronal plane).\nThe similarity in the eye movements of the actor and\nthe observer led Flanagan and Johansson to suggest that\nthe prediction of another's goal could result from a mech-\nanism that mapped an observed action onto the motor\nrepresentation of that action and that this basic process\noperated during both the execution and the observation\nof the action. The idea was that when you see someone\nelse act, you activate your own motor plans for similar\nactions, and these motor plans include instructions for\nthe oculomotor system to implement goal-directed, pre-\ndictive saccades. In other words, Flanagan and Johansson\nproposed that a goal-directed gaze shift would be initi-\nated by activating a single underlying neural network,\nirrespective of who performed the action. This hypothe-\nsis was consistent with the discovery of mirror neurons\n(Dipellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, & Rizzolatti, 1992;\nFadiga, Fogassi, Pavesi, & Rizzolatti, 1995; Gallese, Fadiga,\nFogassi, & Rizzolatti, 1996; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese,\n2001) and the notion that action understanding is rooted\nin the motor system. As with the mirror-neuron system\n(Iacoboni & Dapretto, 2006; Molenberghs, Cunnington, &\nMattingley, 2012), the tendency to predict a goal while\nobserving another person's action was assumed to reflect\na quick, automatic, visuo-motor matching process, rather\nthan a process based on the cognitive interpretation of\nvisual information (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003).\nIn this article, we refer to this view as the embodied\naccount of predictive eye movements. In general, embod-\nied accounts emphasize the notion that cognition is situ-\nated in activity and that it is the outcome of a history of\nactive manipulations of the environment (Barsalou,\n2008). This view contrasts with theories that assume that\ncognition is an abstract manipulation of symbols (Mahon\nFlanagan and Johansson (2003) argued that the pres-\nence of the predictive gaze spoke against the possibility\nthat eye movements during action observations were\ndriven by pure visual analysis, without involving the\nmotor system (p. 770). According to those authors, visu-\nally driven eye movements are typically reactively linked\nto the events we observe. To confirm this, in addition to\nconditions in which participants either performed or\nobserved another actor, Flanagan and Johansson included\na control condition in which the blocks appeared to be\nmoving to their final location by themselves (the experi-\nmenter performing the actions was not visible to the\nobserver). As expected, when observing these apparently\nself-propelled objects, participants fixated on the goal\nonly after the object had arrived there--that is, their gaze\nshifts were reactive rather than predictive. Taken together,\nthose results suggested that it was necessary to see a\nhand-object interaction to elicit a predictive gaze; that\nconclusion was consistent with the notion that the\nobserver must use his or her own motor knowledge to\npredict the goal. Of course, given that only behavioral\ndata was available at the time, the suggestion that this\nprocess was mediated by the observer's motor system\nwas a speculation.\nThe present article reviews the research that followed\nfrom the Flanagan and Johansson study (2003).\nSimultaneously, we evaluate the proposed embodied\naccount of predictive eye movements and present studies\nthat have directly manipulated brain activity, with the aim\nof better understanding the neural networks involved.\nWe also review recent work that has investigated action\nprediction in infancy. Overall, the evidence supports the\ncentral claim made by Flanagan and Johansson (2003),\nbut, as always, the story is more complicated than origi-\nnally assumed.\nUnless otherwise stated, all empirical findings cited\nbelow refer to eye tracking studies that have investigated\nthe tendency of adults or infants to predict (with their\neyes) another person's goal-directed actions, which, for\nthe sake of simplicity, we refer to as action prediction in\nthis article. The majority of the studies used the timing of\ngaze to another person's goal as the dependent variable,\nalthough some also used the accuracy of gaze shifts\nwhen multiple possible goals were present.\nBehavioral analyses of human adults\nthat have replicated and extended\nthe initial findings of Flanagan and\nJohansson\nResearch subsequent to Flanagan and Johansson (2003)\nhas replicated and extended their initial findings. These\nstudies have demonstrated that an adult gaze can predict\nthe goal of a wide range of manual actions performed by\nothers, including stacking objects (Rotman, Troje, Johnson,\neating (Kochukhova & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2010), drinking\n(Hunnius & Bekkering, 2010), placing objects in contain-\ners (Eshuis, Coventry, & Vulchanova, 2009; Falck-Ytter,\nGredeb\u00e4ck, & von Hofsten, 2006; Melzer, Prinz, & Daum,\n(Myowa-Yamakoshi, Scola, & Hirata, 2012). The key find-\nings of these studies are consistent with the embodied\naccount of action prediction. First, they show that a pre-\ndictive gaze can be triggered by point light hands (in\nwhich only motion profiles are maintained, represented\nas moving dots). This finding suggests that basic kine-\nmatic information is sufficient to elicit the predictive pro-\ncess (Elsner, D'Ausilio, Gredeb\u00e4ck, Falck-Ytter, & Fadiga,\nthey showed that it is important that the goal of the\nEye Movements During Action Observation 593\nperceived action is within the reaching space of the agent\nreaching for the goal (Costantini, Ambrosini, & Sinigaglia,\n2012b). Last but not least, they also employed control\nstimuli that displayed apparently self-propelled objects,\nsimilar to those used by Flanagan and Johansson, to study\naction prediction in adults. As expected, consistent with\nthe initial findings, the predictive goal-directed gaze shifts\nwere not observed in the control conditions (Eshuis et al.,\nobserved to a lesser degree than in conditions involving\nhuman action (Eshuis, Coventry, & Vulchanova, 2009;\nKochukhova & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2010). Taken together, the\nfindings suggested that there is something special about\nhuman actions that can trigger predictive eye movements.\nHowever, a convincing test of the embodied account pro-\nposed by Flanagan and Johansson would require a differ-\nent type of data--that is, data that could provide a causal\nlink between motor-system activation and predictive eye\nmovements during action observation.\nDirect evidence: Motor activity is\ncausally linked to action prediction\nThe premise that action prediction depends on the\nobserver's own motor proficiency was tested by interfer-\ning with the action-production system and then deter-\nmining whether action prediction was inhibited.\nAccording to the embodied account, action prediction\nshould be task-specific; thus, interference should occur\nprimarily when the task performed and the task observed\nrequire the same effector (e.g., the same hand).\nThe first study to use this approach was reported by\nCannon and Woodward (2008). They instructed adult\nparticipants to observe a goal-directed manual action\n(similar to the one used by Flanagan and Johansson)\nwhile performing one of two distracting tasks: Participants\neither tapped their fingers or counted backward. Action\nprediction was diminished by simultaneous finger tap-\nping but not by counting backward (a working memory\ntask). The authors argued that taxing the motor system\ninterferes with the process of matching perceived events\nto one's own motor plans for similar actions. In contrast,\nthey argued that working memory tasks have little to do\nwith the embodied processes that are assumed to guide\npredictive eye movements, and thus these tasks were\nexpected to have little impact on action prediction.\nAssuming that the interfering effect of finger tapping was\ndue to a specific tax on the motor system, that study pro-\nvides selective support for the embodied account.\nCostantini, Ambrosini, and Sinigaglia (2012a) let adults\nhold either a small or a large object while observing either\na hand approaching objects with a whole-hand grip (suit-\nable for large objects) or a hand approaching objects with\na precision grip (suitable for small objects). It was found\nthat performing a grip that was different from the one\nobserved resulted in fewer predictions relative to a base-\nline condition, in which the hand of the participants\nrested freely. Ambrosini, Sinigaglia, and Costantini (2012)\ndemonstrated that the latency of adults' predictive eye\nmovements increased (i.e., they became less predictive)\nwhen an observer's arms were tied behind his or her\nback, compared to when the hands were free to move.\nAgain, those studies suggested that motor interfer-\nence could affect action prediction, but the evidence is\npurely behavioral, and hence it was not fully satisfactory,\ngiven the nature of the hypothesis. Arguably, the most\ndirect support for the embodied account of predictive\neye movements was obtained in two studies that used\njoint transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and eye\ntracking methods (Costantini, Ambrosini, Cardellicchio,\nstudies (Elsner et al., 2013), adult participants observed\ngoal-directed reaching actions, represented as point-\nlight displays, while TMS pulses selectively stimulated\nthe hand or leg areas in the primary motor cortex. Results\nwere compared to those produced in the absence of\nTMS activation at each site. Consistent with the embod-\nied account, the participants exhibited delayed fixation\non the goal when TMS pulses interfered with the hand\narea of the primary motor cortex, compared to when no\nTMS was performed or when the TMS targeted the leg\narea of the primary motor cortex. In the other study\n(Costantini et al., 2013), participants viewed manual\nreaching actions while TMS pulses were directed either\nto the ventral premotor cortex or to one of two control\nsites (the superior temporal sulcus or the frontal eye\nfield). Stimulating the premotor area caused specific\ninterference effects that were not observed in the two\ncontrol conditions.\nIn summary, five studies experimentally manipulated\nactivity in the motor cortex (either through TMS or behav-\nioral manipulations) while participants observed another\nindividual's actions (Ambrosini et al., 2012; Cannon &\ninterference effect, consistent with the embodied account.\nThese five studies have provided the strongest evidence\nthat the motor cortex is somatotopically recruited and\ncontributes causally to action predictions.\nThe Development of Action Prediction\nGiven the importance of action prediction in our ability\nto encode and interact with the surrounding world,\nmuch attention has been devoted to investigating these\nprocesses during infancy and early childhood. This\nrecent line of research has demonstrated uniformly that\naction prediction develops early in life (Ambrosini\nWellman, 2014; Cannon, Woodward, Gredeb\u00e4ck, von\nHofsten, & Turek, 2012; Daum, Attig, Gunawan, Prinz,\nGredeb\u00e4ck & Melinder, 2010; Gredeb\u00e4ck, Stasiewicz,\nFalck-Ytter, Rosander, & von Hofsten, 2009; Green,\nKochukhova, & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2014; Henrichs, Elsner,\nElsner, & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2012; Henrichs, Elsner, Wilkinson,\nHunnius, & Bekkering, 2011; Rosander & von Hofsten,\nSouthgate, Senju, & Csibra, 2007). By attaining the abil-\nity to predict another person's action goals, infants can\nfixate on future goals, and thus they proactively pay\nattention to the person's actions as they unfold. From\nthis perspective, action prediction is a fundamental cor-\nnerstone of our ontogenetic development. Without this\nability, learning from others through observation and\ninteraction would be far reduced.\nSeveral developmental studies have studied infants of\ndifferent age groups and demonstrated that action predic-\ntion develops at the same time as the ability to perform an\naction. For example, 4-month-olds have poor reaching\nskills, and they fail to predict the goals of reaching actions.\nSix-month-olds have recently developed the ability to\nreach for objects, and they have the ability to predict the\ngoal of other people's reaching actions (Kanakogi &\nalso highly proficient at placing objects in their mouths,\nand they can predict the goal of other peoples' eating\nactions (Kochukhova & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2010). In contrast,\n6-month-olds cannot predict the movements of mechani-\ncal claws (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011), spoons that appear\nto move on their own, or combing actions that they can-\nnot perform (Kochukhova & Gredeb\u00e4ck, 2010).\nThe ability to place objects into a container typically\ndevelops between 6 and 12 months of age, and 12-month-\nolds, but not 6-month-olds, can predict the goal of such\n(and even adults) cannot predict the goal of a ball that\nappears to move on its own into a container. Moreover,\nat the age of 1 year, prediction of an initial act (in this\ncase, reaching) will become modulated by the overarch-\ning goal of the action sequence (placing the object either\non a table or inside a container). This finding suggests\nthat prediction is controlled by a system of action under-\nstanding that is hierarchically organized (Gredeb\u00e4ck\nSeveral of those studies also analyzed individual man-\nual ability. There are clear correlations (when age is con-\ntrolled for) between predictive eye movements and\nvarious measures of manual capability, including the abil-\nity to reach for something (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011;\nMelzer et al., 2012), the number of times an infant places\nobjects in a container (Cannon et al., 2012), and the num-\nber of attempts made before accurately placing a puzzle\npiece on a puzzle board (Gredeb\u00e4ck & Kochukhova,\n2010). Also, the ability to predict the goal of feeding\nactions correlated with an infant's lifetime experience of\nIn summary, developmental studies have demon-\nstrated that the ability to predict action emerges in early\ninfancy. This finding underlines the role of prediction in\nsocial cognition and interactions in general. Also, the cor-\nrelation between the actions that infants can perform and\nactions they can predict suggests that social cognition\nand social learning might be bound by the developing\naction repertoire of the infant. This result is consistent\nwith the embodied account of action prediction.\nHow Is Prediction Related to Action\nUnderstanding?\nAccording to Flanagan and Johansson (2003), action pre-\ndiction and action understanding occur simultaneously.\nThat is, low-level sensory information from performing\nan action taps directly into the motor system, which then\nin turn outputs the estimated goal (the direct-matching\nhypothesis; see also Rizzolatti et al., 2001). Interpreted\nfrom this perspective, action prediction reflects the\n\"direct\" activation of a motor program, which includes--\nin addition to understanding the goal of the action--task-\nspecific instructions to the oculomotor system to direct\nthe eyes toward the goal (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003).\nAccording to an alternative view (Csibra, 2007; Southgate,\n2013), action prediction follows action understanding.\nThis view argues that goal encoding must precede motor\nsimulation; thus, this theory proposes that motor activa-\ntion and the consequent predictive eye movements reflect\nthe observer's reenactment of achieving the goal, as\nthough the observer had executed the action. Here, this\ntheory is referred to as the reenactment account.\nNotably, both of the above views argue for a role of\nthe motor system, and they cannot be disentangled easily\nbased on the current evidence. Arguably, however, the\nbehavioral experiments can provide circumstantial evi-\ndence against the reenactment account. We know from\nother work (not related to predictive eye movements)\nthat infants and adults can attribute a goal to the actions\nof an \"agent\" that lacks all similarity to the human body\n(Gergely & Csibra, 2003). However, when observing self-\npropelled \"agents\" move without the interaction of an\nactor's hand, predictive eye movements seldom occur\nEye Movements During Action Observation 595\nversion of the embodied account cannot readily account\nfor this finding, because it predicts that, once a goal is\nidentified, the observer should be able to reenact the\naction; thus, the predictive processes associated with the\naction should be activated, irrespective of the morpho-\nlogical characteristics of the agent.\nThe roles of prior knowledge,\nstatistical regularity, and goal\nsalience\nAs described above, when one observes events that lack\na clear correspondence with something in the motor rep-\nertoire of the observer, the gaze is typically reactive.\nHowever, several studies have shown that when one\nobserves an action that corresponds to an action that one\ncan perform, the action prediction is influenced by prior\nknowledge, statistical regularity (e.g., the mean result of\na repeated action), and the salience of the goal (Ambrosini,\nLi, Lockman, & Gredeb\u00e4ck, in press; Henrichs et al., 2014;\nRotman et al., 2006). The most extreme influences of this\nkind can be observed in infancy. At that stage, action\npredictions occur primarily when the goal is highly\nsalient and when the observed agent consistently reaches\nfor the same (as opposed to a different) object (Henrichs\nhas demonstrated cultural influences on action predic-\ntion. Green et al. (in press) demonstrated that 8-month-\nold infants in Sweden and China both predicted that\neating actions would go to the mouth. However, this was\ntrue only for eating actions performed with a spoon\namong Swedish infants and only for eating actions per-\nformed with chopsticks among Chinese infants.\nTogether, the results show that embodied processes\ndedicated to action prediction do not work in isolation;\ninstead, these processes account for other types of infor-\nmation that can be used to predict future states. In other\nwords, although action prediction may be fundamentally\nan embodied process, the tendency to predict is modu-\nlated by broad scope of ancillary functions that either\nenhance the activation within the motor system of the\nobserver or, more generally, facilitate attention. For\nexample, the effect of goal saliency might be related to\nattention. When the goal is highly salient, it may be easier\nto inhibit the initial fixation on the ongoing action and\nfacilitate a saccade to the goal object, which would accel-\nerate the gaze shift to the predicted goal. In a similar\nmanner, the effect of statistical regularity, or repetition,\nmight boost the activation of one's own motor plans\nthrough priming. In infants, whose motor plans are less\ndeveloped, this boost might be necessary to activate the\nmotor system to the threshold required to initiate a pre-\ndictive saccade.\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in addition to modulat-\ning action prediction after the embodied system is estab-\nlished, statistical learning may also contribute to the\ndevelopment of the system. Specifically, it has been sug-\ngested that embodied systems for action understanding\nacquire their mirroring properties through Hebbian learn-\nPrediction in other contexts\nThe above evidence relates primarily to the ability to pre-\ndict in rather simplified contexts (e.g., a hand reaching\nfor an object), but it should be noted that predictive gaze\nshifts to goals also occur when observing actions embed-\nded in social interactions between people (Fawcett &\net al., 2007). How embodied and other processes interact\nin such situations is currently not well understood. It is\nalso notable that infants and adults can predict the future\nstate of certain nonsocial events. For example, predictive\neye movements are systematically directed to the future\nlocation of non-animate moving balls that temporarily\ndisappear behind a barrier (Gredeb\u00e4ck & von Hofsten,\nGredeb\u00e4ck, 2007; for a review, see Gredeb\u00e4ck & von\nHofsten, 2007). Clearly, the embodied account cannot\nexplain predictive gaze shifts in all contexts.\nConclusion\nPrediction is a fundamental component of our interac-\ntions with the world, including interactions with other\npeople. When you view someone else reach for an\nobject, you anticipate what is going to happen by mov-\ning your gaze to the object before the arrival of the\nother person's hand. As shown in this review, this pre-\ndictive capacity--which is likely to be a key compo-\nnent of social perception, cognition, and interaction,\nboth in competitive and collaborative contexts--builds\nupon the activation of one's own motor system\nesis was proposed over 10 years ago by Flanagan and\nJohansson (2003), but the lack of brain-based evidence\nrendered it speculative at that time. Following in the\nfootsteps of the Flanagan and Johansson study, over\n30 articles have provided direct evidence for the\nembodied account of predictive eye movements, and\nadditionally, several studies have shed important new\nlight on the development of action prediction. This\nbody of work has shown that infants possess the\nimpressive capacity to predict other people's action\ngoals and that this capacity develops hand in hand with\nthe infant's own action capacities.\nFuture Directions\nThis review has highlighted key areas for future investi-\ngation, including the relationship between action predic-\ntion and action understanding and the roles of general\nfactors, such as prior knowledge, statistical regularity,\nand goal salience, in embodied processes.\nThe ontogenetic development of the mirror-neuron\nsystem and related networks of action understanding in\ninfancy is a matter of current controversy and debate\n(Heyes, 2013). The infant studies described above, which\nfocused on action predictions early in life, provided a\nway to illuminate these questions, and those types of\nstudies should be exploited and developed further.\nIn everyday social interactions, action understanding is\nnever complete; rather, one must constantly revisit current\nassumptions about other people's actions in light of new\ninformation. Therefore, future studies should focus on the\nrole of the predictive gaze in the action understanding\nprocess--for example, in checking, validating, and updat-\ning assumptions and beliefs about other people's goals.\nThis would entail, among other things, going beyond\nrepetitive video presentations of simple manual actions\nand acknowledging the intricate dynamics of embodied\nand other processes (Gredeb\u00e4ck & Daum, 2015).\nDetermining the importance of action predictions in\ndynamic social interactions requires implementing future-\noriented processes in artificial systems designed for real-\nworld interactions (Vernon, Fadiga, & von Hofsten, 2011;\nand see, e.g., Metta et al., 2010). Initial steps have been\ntaken to integrate action prediction into developmental\nrobotics platforms (Sciutti et al., 2012). In turn, simula-\ntions of the action-prediction system may provide useful\nways to test putative mechanisms that underlie action\npredictions. However, much work remains to be com-\npleted before this goal can be realized.\nTo test the proposed theories and demonstrate the\nclinical relevance of developmental studies, one could\ntest infants with deteriorated motor-control functions or\nwho have been born without hands or arms but with\notherwise intact cognitive capacities. Such studies could\nprovide important new evidence for the role of active\nexperience in socio-cognitive development, and they\nmay reveal potential compensatory processes.\nFinally, testing action prediction in infants at risk for\nautism may provide a means to test the hypothesis that\ndisruptions in systems involved in (embodied) action\nunderstanding may represent a causal link between\ngenetic/molecular risk factors and a later diagnosis\ngeneral, the identification and study of groups that fail,\nearly in life, to predict other people's action goals would\nprovide a means to test a core assumption presented in\nthis article--namely, that action prediction is a necessary\nfoundation for social cognition and interaction.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared that they had no conflicts of interest with\nrespect to their authorship or the publication of this article.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by the European Research Council\n(Starting Grant CACTUS 312292), the Knut and Alice Wallenberg\nCouncil in partnership with the Swedish Council for Working\nLife and Social Research (FAS), Formas, and VINNOVA (Grant\nReferences\nAbernethy, B.
