Hook-ups consist of sexual behaviors between partners in the\nabsence of a traditional romantic relationship and without the promise of other benefits.\nThey are often considered a form of \"no-strings-attached\" (NSA) sex.\nHooking up has become a norm on college campuses throughout North America\n(Bogle, 2008; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000). The \"dating scene\" has disappeared from\nmany campuses, and uncommitted sexual behavior takes place in the absence of a\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\ntraditional romantic relationship framework (Reitman, 2006). A majority of individuals in\ncollege student populations studied so far have reported at least one casual sexual\nexperience or hook-up (England, Shafer, and Fogarty, 2007; Garcia and Reiber, 2008;\nGrello, Welsh, and Harper, 2006; Gute and Eshbaugh, 2008; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple,\n2003; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000). The prevalence of hook-ups varies from campus\nto campus, likely as a result of ecological differences between college environments,\nhistorical time of data collection, age of participants, and the demographics of the\npopulation being surveyed. However, estimates consistently range from nearly 65% to\napproximately 80% of undergraduate participants reporting having engaged in a hook-up at\nleast once in their college career (England, Shafer, and Fogarty, 2007; Garcia and Reiber,\nPopular interest in the topic is ubiquitous, evidenced by the spate of books\naddressing it, including such exemplars as The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide\nto Living It Up (Rozler and Lavinthal, 2005), The Happy Hook-Up: A Single Girl's Guide\nto Casual Sex (Sherman and Tocantins, 2004), Hooking Up: A Girl's All-out Guide to Sex\nand Sexuality (Madison, 2006), and an occasional retort, such as Unhooked: How Young\nWomen Pursue Sex, Delay Love, and Lose at Both (Stepp, 2007). Expos\u00e9s fill the pages of\nmagazines (Reitman, 2006), attempting to understand the shift in how young women\napproach sex and relationships, while young adult magazines conduct and publish results\nfrom massive electronic polls about the hook-up behavior of their readership (Seventeen\nMagazine, 2006). Popular cosmetic companies use slogans such as \"hook-up perfect\" to\nwidely market and sell beauty products to young women. Academic contributions to the\ntopic of hooking up are fewer, but the body of literature is growing; for example, see\nHooking Up: Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus (Bogle, 2008).\nPopular media coverage may be sensationalistic, and undoubtedly influences\nattitudes and sexual behavior in adolescents and young adults. However, the hook-up\nphenomenon is not merely a creation of the media; rather, the media seems to be reflecting\nan actual shift in behavior. Such casual sexual experiences among college students are by\nno means a product of the 21st century; \"one-night stands\" and \"casual sex\" have been\nstudied without the current \"hook-up\" context (Boswell and Spade, 1996; Cates, 1991;\nMaticka-Tyndale, 1991). However, the high prevalence of these behaviors, coupled with an\nopenness to display and discuss them, appears to be recent, particularly with respect to\nPluralistic ignorance (PI) has been demonstrated to play a role in hook-up behavior.\nPI is characterized by individuals behaving in accordance with (generally false) beliefs\nattributed to the group, regardless of their own beliefs (Fields and Schuman, 1976; Miller\nand McFarland, 1987). Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003) found that young adults routinely\nbelieve that others are more comfortable with various sexual behaviors than they,\nthemselves, are. This leads them to behave as if they were more comfortable than they\nactually are, and engage in behaviors with which they are not actually comfortable. Note\nthat if everyone is affected by this fallacy, no one will be behaving in accordance with their\nown beliefs and comfort levels. As a result, research on hook-ups has focused on personal\nconsequences (e.g., Fielder and Carey, in press; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003; Paul and\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nHayes, 2002; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000), including the convoluted issue of consent\nand its ramifications (particularly for women), and the role of alcohol and/or drugs in hook-\nup behavior on campuses. However, there remains the broader question of why individuals\nharbour such false beliefs about the social norm, and whether the patterns of beliefs are\npredictable, and thus, potentially correctable. We expect that because human psychological\nprocesses are the product of evolution, the capacity and tendency to exhibit pluralistic\nignorance \u00ad particularly with respect to sexual/reproductive behavior \u00ad must reflect the\nevolved best interest of individuals, and thus be predictable on the basis of evolutionary\ntheory and sexual selection.\nBehavioral-Evolutionary Approach and Predictions\nIt is likely that a complex set of interacting factors \u00ad human evolution, evolved\nneurobiology and psychological processes, social and cultural context \u00ad all contribute to the\nexpression of uncommitted sexual behavior (see Garcia and Reiber, 2008). It is possible\nthat novel sociocultural factors are currently driving up the prevalence of contemporary\nNSA sexual hook-up behavior. However, we expect that the evolved psychology\nunderlying sexual behavior will still be apparent and contributing to contemporary\nexpressions of sexual behavior. Here we focus specifically on evolutionarily designed\npsychological responses \u00ad specifically, psychological comfort levels that might elucidate\nthe PI effect.\nHumans are, as a species, biological organisms with a polygynous evolutionary\nhistory. Thus, male humans are, on average, expected to be more sexually eager than\nfemale humans, and females are, on average, expected to be relatively \"coy\" and choosy\nSymons, 1979). The higher potential male reproductive rate (Clutton-Brock and Parker,\n1992) and lower cost of reproduction to males (Trivers, 1972) should lead to males seeking\nout a variety of mates and engaging in sex often. That men willingly and eagerly engage in\nhook-up behavior is therefore not surprising. But the lower potential female reproductive\nrate (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1992) and higher cost of reproduction to females (Trivers,\n1972) should lead to female reluctance to engage in sexual (historically, costly and\npotentially reproductive) behavior in the absence of resources, security, and/or commitment\nfrom a potential partner. Even the less-obvious potential advantages to women, such as\ngood genes and immediate access to resources, seem not to apply. That women engage in\nhook-up behavior therefore demands an explanation.\nSeveral predictions follow from these evolutionary sex differences. First, men are\npredicted to be more comfortable than women with all hook-up behaviors. Second, each\ngender is predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of the opposite gender. Compared\nto their own comfort levels, men are predicted to attribute to women lower comfort levels\nwith all sexual hook-up behaviors, and women are predicted to attribute to men higher\ncomfort levels with all sexual hook-up behaviors. This is consistent with evolutionary\ninterpretations of the importance of recognizing and responding to \"in-group\" norms\n(Kurzban and Neuberg, 2005), and with evolutionary error management theory, which\nargues that natural selection can lead to adaptively biased systems of judgment (Haselton\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nThird, individuals of each gender are predicted to know the gender-specific strategy\nof their own gender. For men, the comfort levels they attribute to other men (for all sexual\nbehaviors) are predicted to be higher than the comfort levels they feel themselves. In\nevolutionary terms, this would lead to men being more likely to engage in such behavior\neven if they personally have a lower comfort level, thus potentially increasing reproductive\nsuccess. Thus, this is an evolutionarily predictable demonstration of PI. For women,\nhowever, the comfort levels they attribute to other women can discriminate between two\ncompeting evolutionary hypotheses. On one hand, women could be predicted to attribute to\nother women comfort levels that are quite similar to, or lower than, the comfort levels they,\nthemselves, feel. This might result if a belief in other women's greater discomfort and\nrestraint reinforced the stereotypical choosy coyness of females, and led women to more\nconservative sexual behavior, and thus, fewer errors in sexual (potentially reproductive)\ndecision-making. On the other hand, modern Western women live in cultures in which\nthere are simultaneously large differentials in male resources and status, and imposed\nmarital monogamy, the combination of which is expected to provoke intrasexual\ncompetition among females for potential mates (Gaulin and Boster, 1990). Engaging in\nuncommitted sex may be one form of female-female competition. If this is so, we would\npredict that women attribute to other women comfort levels that are higher than they,\nthemselves, feel; this would generate PI that would heighten women's awareness of\npotential threats from female competitors and may motivate women to engage in\ncompetition.\nCurrent Study\nGoals of the current survey were to: 1) assess the prevalence of hook-up behaviors\nin a random sample of students at the target university, 2) evaluate the PI effect by\nassessing participants' own comfort levels with various hook-up behaviors, as well as the\ncomfort levels they attribute to others of the same and opposite genders, and 3) evaluate the\npredictions of the behavioral-evolutionary approach with respect to hook-up behaviors.\nThis will set the stage for a larger risk-reduction project at the target university, including\nthe development of a holistic educational intervention program geared at breaking down the\nPI effect by disseminating accurate evolutionarily-informed behavioral information.\nMaterials and Methods\nSurvey Procedures\nThe use of humans as research subjects in this study was approved by the\nappropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the study was carried out in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of the IRB. Data included in this report were collected as\npart of a larger, 70-item, self-report questionnaire containing demographic information as\nwell as a history of sexual behavior and intimate relationships. The questionnaire focused\non experiences and motivations surrounding hook-up behavior. At the beginning of the\nquestionnaire, hook-up behavior was defined for participants as follows: \"A hook-up is a\nsexual encounter between people who are not dating or in a relationship, and where a more\ntraditional romantic relationship is NOT an explicit condition of the encounter.\"\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nThe questionnaire was administered electronically via StudentVoice\n(www.studentvoice.com), a higher-education assessment provider. The questionnaire was\nuploaded and formatted to their web-based survey tool. StudentVoice randomly generated a\nsample of 1,000 undergraduate email addresses from the population of approximately\n11,500 undergraduates attending the university. To protect potential participants and\nmaintain complete anonymity, this list was not shared with the researchers (Thus, no\ncomparisons can be made between responders and non-responders). A voluntary\nrecruitment email was sent to these 1000 students requesting their participation in the\nstudy, and providing a link to the web-based survey. Potential participants were notified\nthat the study was completely anonymous and that they could skip any question(s) they did\nnot wish to answer. Six hundred fifty-three students responded to the invitation by clicking\nthe link and reading the introductory materials (informed consent and description of the\nsurvey). Of those, 507 (77.6%) continued beyond the informed consent and description,\nand provided the data analyzed here.\nSurvey Participants\nParticipants included 507 undergraduate students at a mid-sized public university.\nparticipants was 19.7 years (SD = 1.7). Participants included 42% first-year/freshmen (n =\nfourth-year/seniors (n = 71).\nSurvey Questions\nFor comparison purposes, the substantive questions on the survey were designed to\nbe consistent with the methodology of others studying PI and hook-up behavior, notably\nLambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003), following Prentice and Miller's (1993) application for\nalcohol use. Students used an 11-point scale to rate comfort levels of self and others with\nvarious hook-up behaviors. The anchor points of the scale were labelled \"very\nuncomfortable\" and \"very comfortable\", respectively, and the midpoint was labelled\n\"neutral.\" Diverging from Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003), the midpoint of the scale was\nset at zero in this study so that feelings reflecting negative states (i.e., discomfort) were\nrated as negative numbers, and feelings reflecting positive states (i.e., comfort) were rated\nas positive numbers. Thus, the range of this 11-point scale was -5 to +5, with a midpoint of\n0 (neutral). Participants responded to 3 questions about sexual behaviors:\n(1) How comfortable are you with engaging in the following activities during a\nhook-up?\n(2) Think of the average person of the same sex as you. How comfortable do\nyou think this person of the same sex is with engaging in the following\nactivities during a hook-up?\n(3) Think of the average person of the opposite sex as you. How comfortable\ndo you think this person of the opposite sex is with engaging in the\nfollowing activities during a hook-up?\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nThe five behaviors that participants rated for each question were: sexual touching above the\nwaist, sexual touching below the waist, oral sex (giving), oral sex (receiving), and\nintercourse. Participants also indicated which of these behaviors they had actually engaged\nin during a hook-up.\nAnalyses\nData were imported into SYSTAT v.10.2 for Windows for analyses. We collected\ndata on many demographic and life-history variables \u00ad age and year in school, religiosity,\nethnicity, family composition and upbringing \u00ad for complex exploratory analyses that will\ninform our ongoing longitudinal work. However, the first step is a simple assessment of the\nprevalence of various behaviors and an evaluation of attitudes. These basic summaries of\nthe data are presented here (percents, means, standard deviations).\nResults\nPrevalence of Specific Hook-Up Behaviors\nWhen asked to self-report whether they had hooked up, 64% of participants\nreported having done so. However, when asked about specific sexual behaviors, only 19%\nindicated that they had not engaged in any of the specific sexual behaviors in the context of\na hook-up. Therefore, in actual behavioral terms, 81% of the participants had engaged in\nsome form of sexual behavior during a hook-up.\nThere was tremendous variation in prevalence of the various sexual behaviors that\ncomprise hook-ups. Overall, 58% of participants reported having engaged in sexual\ntouching above the waist during a hook-up, and 53% reported sexual touching below the\nwaist during a hook-up. Performing and receiving oral sex during hook-ups were reported\nby 36% and 35% of participants, respectively. Intercourse during a hook-up was reported\nby 34% of participants. Nineteen percent of participants reported having engaged in none\nof these behaviors during a hook-up. Table 1 shows the prevalence of the various hook-up\nbehaviors by gender. It is important to note that this is not a closed sample; that is,\nparticipants could have engaged in these behaviors with individuals who are not part of this\nsample. Thus, for instance, it is not contradictory that 40% of women report having\nperformed oral sex, but only 36% of men report having received oral sex.\nTable 1. Percent of participants reporting having engaged in various hook-up behaviors\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nComfort Levels, PI, and the Behavioral-Evolutionary Predictions\nComfort levels were rated on a scale from +5 (very comfortable) to -5 (very\nuncomfortable. Women reported being somewhat comfortable (M = 2.72, SD = 3.13) with\nsexual touching above the waist during a hook-up, fairly neutral (M = 0.92, SD = 3.91) with\nsexual touching below the waist, somewhat uncomfortable with oral sex as performer (M =\nintercourse (M = -2.23, SD = 3.62). On average, men reported being highly comfortable\nwith sexual touching above the waist (M = 3.36, SD = 2.99) during a hook-up, and\nsomewhat comfortable with sexual touching below the waist (M = 3.02, SD = 3.14). Men\nwere fairly neutral with oral sex as performer (M = 0.48, SD = 4.05), but much more\ncomfortable with oral sex as receiver (M = 2.91, SD = 3.19) during a hook-up; and they\nwere somewhat comfortable with intercourse (M = 2.26, SD = 3.62) during a hook-up.\nFigure 1 shows men's and women's reported comfort levels with various sexual behaviors\nduring a hook-up, and illustrates that for all sexual behaviors, men reported higher comfort\nlevels than women. This supports the first prediction.\nFigure 1. Comfort levels with various hook-up behaviors, by gender\nFigure 2 illustrates women's (top panel) and men's (bottom panel) comfort levels\nwith various hook-up behaviors, and the comfort levels that each gender attributes to others\nof the same and opposite gender. Table 2 shows the means (and standard deviations) for\nthese results. What is clear from this table is that women attributed to men higher comfort\nlevels (than the women themselves had) with every behavior. This supports the second\nprediction. Moreover, the comfort levels attributed to men by women were higher than\nwhat men actually reported. Similarly, men attributed to women lower comfort levels (than\nthe men themselves had) with every behavior. This also supports the second prediction.\nMen overestimated women's comfort levels with every behavior.\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nIndividuals of both genders attributed to others of the same gender higher comfort\nlevels than they themselves had (Table 2). For men, attributing higher comfort levels to\nother men supports the third prediction. For women, attributing higher comfort levels to\nother women is consistent with the female-competition hypothesis. Both of these results\nexpose evolutionarily-predictable instantiations of PI.\nTable 2.

Comfort levels for self and attributed to others of each gender, for various hook-\nup behaviors (top panel, women; bottom panel, men)\nDiscussion\nThe prevalence of hooking up in the current study is within the range reported by\nother studies. Eighty-one percent of participants in the current study report having engaged\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nin some form of sexual hook-up behavior. This is slightly higher than the 78% reported by\nPaul, McManus, and Hayes (2000). In addition, the sex difference in intercourse during a\nhook-up found by Paul, McManus, and Hayes (2000) was not found in this study. While\nthey reported 47.5% of men and 33% of women engaging in intercourse during a hook-up,\nthe current study found 35% of men and 32% of women reporting intercourse during a\nhook-up. This difference might be explained by differences in university type, structure,\nsize, student body demographics, overall environment, or a number of other factors.\nAlthough we do not predict strict consistency between various campuses, large-scale\nsurveying is continuing at the target university to explicate this issue.\nIn the current study, as in several others (Cohen and Shotland, 1996; Knox and\nhigher comfort levels than women with all sexual behaviors. They also overestimated\nwomen's comfort levels with several of the behaviors, particularly the more serious\nbehaviors (i.e., oral sex and intercourse) that pose higher physical and/or mental health\nrisks such as sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and/or psychological\ninjury. Men's higher comfort levels with these behaviors, paired with their overestimations\nof women's comfort levels with these behaviors, may have unfortunate consequences\nincluding men inadvertently pressuring women, and women outwardly succumbing to the\npressure in spite of their inward aversion to such behaviors in the context of hooking up.\nAlso building on the work of Cohen and Shotland (1996), Lambert, Kahn, and\nApple (2003), and Prentice and Miller (1993), the current study demonstrated clear patterns\nof PI with respect to comfort levels with various sexual behaviors during hook-ups. For all\nsexual behaviors, both genders attributed to others of the same gender higher comfort levels\nthan they, themselves, felt. This may help explain the high rates of these behaviors in spite\nof the low comfort levels reported. For instance, while women reported moderate\ndiscomfort with intercourse during a hook-up, 32% of women and 35% of men reported\nhaving engaged in intercourse during a hook-up. Over a third of the women reported\nengaging in oral sex (in one role or the other) even though women's comfort levels with\nthese behaviors were generally negative. The pressure to act in accordance with these false\nperceived norms may be leading individuals to engage in behavior with which they are\nuncomfortable, and that poses potential risks in terms of sexually transmitted diseases,\npregnancy, and psychological trauma.\nThese three factors \u00ad men's higher comfort, men's overestimation of women's\ncomfort, and women's overestimation of other women's comfort \u00ad may dovetail and\ninadvertently result in sexual assault. As noted by Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003, p.132),\n\"In this context it is possible for a woman to experience sexual assault but not interpret the\nbehavior as such, believing it to be normative behavior with which her peers are\ncomfortable.\" Indeed, at the university where the current study took place, our university\ncounseling center's internal reports show rapidly rising numbers of women clients\npresenting with symptoms generally considered sequelae of sexual assault. Yet, it is\nincreasingly common for these same women to outwardly deny having been sexually\nassaulted. In other words, clients are presenting to the counseling center following\ntraumatic and regretful sexual hook-up experiences, but are seemingly not self-identifying\nas victims or registering their discomfort as legitimate. It appears that women are behaving\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nin accordance with their false beliefs in spite of their own discomfort with particular sexual\nbehaviors, and are facing negative psychological and emotional consequences as a result.\nThese findings are also consistent with error management theory (Haselton and\nBuss, 2000). Specifically, Haselton (2003) has used error management theory to suggest a\nsexual overperception bias where men genuinely misperceive women's sexual interest as\nbeing greater than it actually is, but there is no bias in women's sexual inferences. This can\nthen lead to purposeful manipulation. Paired with the PI effect that applies to hook-up\nbehavior, this sets the stage for conceivably dangerous sexual activity where partners have\ndiffering and misinformed perceptions of their engagement, with potentially severe clinical,\npsychological, and potentially legal ramifications.\nBehavioral-Evolutionary Paradigm and Implications\nOur data support the predictions of the behavioral-evolutionary paradigm. First,\nmen were predicted and found to be more comfortable than women with all hook-up\nbehaviors. Second, each gender was predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of the\nopposite gender. Compared to their own comfort levels, men were predicted and found to\nattribute to women lower comfort levels with all behaviors, although they overestimated\nwomen's comfort levels with all behaviors, consistent with Haselton (2003). Compared to\ntheir own comfort levels, women were predicted to attribute to men higher comfort levels\nwith all behaviors. The current study also found support for this, although women\noverestimated men's comfort levels with all behaviors. This is consistent if interpreted as a\nprotective mechanism; that is, women believing that men in general are more comfortable\nwith sex in all its forms than they really are (i.e., women perceiving men as more sexually\npermissive), might make women more guarded and careful prior to engaging in sexual\nactivity.\nThird, each gender was predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of their own\ngender. The comfort levels attributed by men to other men (for all sexual behaviors) were\npredicted and found to be higher than the comfort levels men reported for themselves. In\nevolutionary terms, this would lead to men being more likely to engage in such behavior in\nspite of their own (lower) comfort levels, thus potentially increasing reproductive success.\nWomen were found to attribute higher comfort levels to other women than they,\nthemselves, felt. This is consistent with women viewing other women as competitors for\nmates, and is somewhat paradoxical given the definition of \"NSA\" sex \u00ad that no\nrelationship exists, and no relationship is on offer. Although the vast majority of these\nparticipants reported having no actual expectation that hook-ups would develop into\ntraditional romantic relationships, 51% (of both men and women) indicated the desire to\ninitiate a traditional romantic relationship when asked to identify the factors that motivate\nthem to hook up (data reported elsewhere; see Garcia and Reiber, 2008). This evidence,\nlike that of Fisher (2009), strongly suggests that \"NSA sex\" may not actually be \"string-\nfree.\" In fact, \"NSA sex\" may be an oxymoron. This conflict between behavior, desires and\nperceptions regularly puts young adults at risk of negative consequences from the PI effect.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. It represents a cross-sectional snapshot of a\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\nsingle point in time. Further studies will be required to understand change over time for\nthese behaviors and the associated attitudes and perceptions. This will be important to\nassess the impact of aging, experience, and related factors on these behaviors and/or\nattitudes. Additionally, the collected reports of actual hook-up behavior in this study are\nretrospective, but the data on comfort levels reflects feelings at the time of the survey.\nComfort levels reported may be affected not only by previous experience, but also by peer\nreactions to behavior. Thus, for example, it should not be concluded from this study that all\n32% of women participants who reported having engaged in intercourse during a hook-up\nwere markedly uncomfortable with it during the actual event. Such a conclusion would\nrequire concurrent reports of behavior and comfort levels. Future studies are planned to\naddress these important issues.\nFuture Directions\nThese findings illustrate the power of an evolutionary approach in understanding\npsychological phenomena such as Pluralistic Ignorance (PI). If evolution fosters PI in\npredictable ways, and PI contributes to actual uncommitted sexual behavior, then an\nunderstanding of evolutionary psychology will be important in the development of\nsuccessful holistic health education programs aimed at undermining PI and addressing\nsexual behavior (along with other high-risk behaviors) and the associated negative\ndownstream sequelae.\nSocial norms marketing is \"...a theory and evidence-based methodology for\naddressing health and social justice issues that can be used to foster (healthy)\nenvironments...\" (Berkowitz, 2006, p. 2). Others have pointed to the success of social\nnorms marketing programs in reducing the PI surrounding alcohol use on campuses, and\nnoted the similarity between alcohol use and hook-up behavior in terms of the PI effect (see\nLambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003). While social norms marketing may serve as a strong\nhealth promotion model for colleges (Haines, 1998), no intervention programs aimed at\nbreaking down the PI surrounding hook-up behavior have been described in the literature.\nResearch and program planning is continuing at the target university. We intend to\ncontinue surveying on an ongoing basis to track trends in these sexual behaviors, and to\ndevelop and implement an educational campaign about sexual (hook-up) behavior on\ncampus that is similar to the \"Most of Us\" program for alcohol use (see DeJong and\nCollaboration with the campus counselling center, the student life office, and the student\nhealth service will aid in designing and implementing a strong and consistent program\nacross campus, and assessing the impact in multiple domains. By consistently\ndisseminating accurate information about hook-up attitudes and behavior on campus, the PI\nsurrounding hooking up may be reduced, leading to changes in behavior and reducing\nnegative outcomes (e.g., psychological and physical trauma, harm to reputation, sequelae of\nsexual assault, sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy). We neither\ncondemn nor condone sexual activity, but rather, we endorse the need for young adults to\nbe aware of, honestly communicate, and act in accordance with, their own comfort levels\nand those of their partner(s) during engagement in sexual activity.\nPluralistic ignorance and hooking up\n"
