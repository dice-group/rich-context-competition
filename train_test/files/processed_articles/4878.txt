This difference is present already in two-year-old children (Manning, Scutt,\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nWilson, and Lewis-Jones, 1998) and it is thought to be established prenatally by the 13th or\nof its early emergence, sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D may reflect relative levels of first\ntrimester prenatal androgens and estrogens. Low 2D:4D digit ratio has been associated with\nhigh levels of androgens, whereas higher ratio is associated with high estrogen levels (e.g.,\nstudies on 2D:4D ratios of people affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a\ncondition which causes excessive androgen production during gestation. The 2D:4D ratios\nhave been found to be smaller in men and women with CAH than in sex-matched controls\nThe masculinity and femininity of 2D:4D ratio may differ between right and left\nhands. It has been suggested that 2D:4D ratio, and many other sexually dimorphic traits,\ntends to be expressed more masculine on the right side of men's bodies (H\u00f6nekopp and\npattern in women; women may have a more feminine 2D:4D ratio in their right hand\nlow 2D:4D, low right-left 2D:4D (i.e., the difference between right and left hand) correlates\nwith high prenatal testosterone levels (Bennett, Manning, Cook, and Kilduff, 2010;\nManning, Bundred, Newton, and Flanagan, 2003).\nSeveral studies have investigated how the 2D:4D ratio varies with sexual\norientation, as like 2D:4D ratio, sexual orientation is also thought to be determined\nprenatally and affected by prenatal androgen levels. Several lines of evidence support this\nobservation. For example, male infants with apparently normal prenatal androgen exposure\nwho have undergone gender reassignment to female shortly after birth appear to have\nsexual attraction to women (Mustanski, Chivers, and Bailey, 2002; Reiner and Gearhart,\n2004). This suggests that the prenatal environment has effects on sexual orientation that\npersist despite discordance with the assigned gender role. Furthermore, women with\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia are more likely to be homosexual than control females\nMoney, Schwartz, and Lewis, 1984; Zucker et al., 1996). In light of these findings it is not\nsurprising that numerous studies have found an association between 2D:4D ratios and\nsexual orientation (reviewed in Grimbos, Dawood, Burriss, Zucker, and Puts, 2010).\nAlthough 2D:4D ratio has been found to associate with sexual orientation, the\ndirection of the difference has not been consistent across all studies. For example, some\nstudies have found that the 2D:4D ratio in homosexual males was higher (more feminine)\nthan in heterosexual males (e.g., Lippa, 2003; Manning, Churchill, and Peters, 2007;\nMcFadden and Shubel, 2002), but others have found the ratio to be lower (more masculine)\nin homosexual men than in heterosexual men (Rahman and Wilson, 2003; Robinson and\nManning, 2000). Discrepancies across studies exist for homosexual women also, although\nnot as substantial. For example, Lippa (2003) and van Anders and Hampson (2005) found\nthat heterosexual and lesbian women showed no significant differences in 2D:4D ratios,\nwhereas McFadden and Shubel (2002), Rahman and Wilson (2003), and Williams et al.\n(2000) reported smaller 2D:4D ratios for homosexual females than for heterosexual\nfemales. A recent meta-analysis on 18 independent samples of men and 16 independent\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nsamples of women found that heterosexual women had higher left- and right-hand 2D:4D\nthan did lesbians, but found no difference between heterosexual and gay men (Grimbos et\nOne reason for the dissonances between studies may be the large ethnic diversity\nbetween and within studied populations. Taking into consideration the ethnic background\nof participants is important because research shows that 2D:4D ratios vary substantially\nbetween different ethnicities and nationalities (Lippa, 2003; Manning, 2002; Manning et\nthan sex. Manning (2002) reported finger length ratios of people from nine different\nnationalities. He found that the 2D:4D ratios ranged from mean ratios of about 0.99 to 1.00\nfor the groups with high 2D:4D ratios (Poland, Spain and England) to mean ratios of about\nIntermediate mean 2D:4D ratios of about 0.96 to 0.97 were found in groups from South\nIndia, Germany and Hungary. Therefore, the differences in finger length ratios do not seem\nto follow a simple White-Black or North-South trend. Because of this, restricting the\nparticipants into, for example, Caucasians does not seem sufficient, because the ethnic\ndifferences extend to even subgroups within Caucasians. For example, the Caucasian group\ncould contain people from populations of both high 2D:4D mean ratios (e.g., England) and\nlow mean 2D:4D ratios (e.g., Finland). However, this is the way ethnicity has been\ncategorized in most studies of 2D:4D ratios and sexual orientation (e.g., Hall and Love,\nManning, 2000; Smith, Hawkeswood, and Joiner, 2010). Still more studies have not\ncontrolled for ethnicity at all (e.g., Hall and Schaeff, 2008; Kraemer et al., 2006; Putz,\nGaulin, Sporter, and McBurney, 2004; van Anders and Hampson, 2005; Wallien, Zucker,\nSteensma, and Cohen-Kettenis, 2008; Williams et al., 2000). The differences in ethnicity\nmay obscure relationships between the 2D:4D ratios and variables other than ethnicity.\nThus, it is possible that the differences in direction of effect, or the lack of effect, seen\nbetween studies may be at least partly due to different composition of ethnic groups in the\nheterosexual and homosexual samples in the individual studies.\nThere is another possible explanation to the contradictory findings in studies of\nsexual orientation and 2D:4D ratios. Manning and Robinson (2003) posed a hypothesis of\nuniversal mean 2D:4D in homosexual men, which suggests that mean 2D:4D ratios of\nhomosexual men may vary only little between different ethnicities, whereas those of\nheterosexual men may show substantial ethnic variation. It follows that heterosexual men\nmight have higher 2D:4D ratios than homosexual men in some populations, whereas in\nothers they might have lower 2D:4D ratios than homosexuals. They investigated sexual\norientation and 2D:4D ratios of men from many different nationalities, and found that\nwithout regard to sexual orientation showed much higher variation. This may be due to\nlocal selection pressures (for example the intensity of men's competition for women) that\naffect heterosexual men but not homosexual men, leading to different 2D:4D ratios in\nheterosexual men in different ethnic groups. Data from some other studies support the\nuniversal mean of 0.96 to 0.97 for homosexual men, at least in Caucasians (e.g., McFadden\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nBirth order is another factor that has been found to associate with sexual orientation.\nResearch indicates that a later birth order is related to homosexuality in men; more\nspecifically, homosexual men seem to have a greater number of older brothers than\nbetween high fraternal birth order and homosexuality is called the fraternal birth order\neffect. For example, Bogaert (2003) established that each additional older brother increased\nthe odds of homosexuality by 38%. However, to our knowledge homosexuality has not\nbeen correlated with number of older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters (e.g.,\nBlanchard, 2001). The relationship between birth order and sexual orientation has yet to be\nIt has been hypothesized that the fraternal birth order effect reflects a maternal\nimmune reaction, which is provoked only by male fetuses and which gets stronger after\neach pregnancy with a male fetus (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1996). The relevant fetal\nantigens in this immune reaction are thought to be Y-linked minor histocompatibility\nantigens are present on cell surfaces in males, but not in females, from an early stage of\nfetal development (Epstein, Smith, and Travis, 1980; Krco and Goldberg, 1976; Shelton\nand Goldberg, 1984; White, Anderson, and BonDurant, 1987; White, Lindner, Anderson,\nand BonDurant, 1983). It has been hypothesized that when the mother's immune system is\nalerted by these antigens, the mother produces certain antigens which cross the placental\nbarrier and enter the fetal brain. They prevent the brain from developing in the male-typical\npattern, so that the individual will later be attracted to men rather than women (Bogaert,\nThe aim of this study is to assess the relationship of two prenatal influences \u00ad birth\norder and 2D:4D \u00ad to sexual orientation. The current study improves on previous research\nby assessing large, ethnically homogeneous sample. The study was conducted in Finland,\nwhere the population has been found to be genetically relatively homogenous (Salmela et\nal., 2008). Furthermore, by only including people whose parents were both Finnish in our\nanalysis, we aimed to further minimize the methodological problem caused by ethnic\nvariation.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe original data consisted of 815 participants. However, as only the people whose\nparents were both Finnish were included in the analysis, the final analyses included 773\npeople. The participants were recruited from the lobby of University of Turku, from the\nTurku city library and from bars in Turku and Helsinki. Of the participants, 237 were\nheterosexual men, 63 were non-heterosexual men, 400 were heterosexual women, and 73\nwere non-heterosexual women. The mean age was 26.10 years (SD = 7.69) in heterosexual\nheterosexual men and 25.16 years (SD = 6.09) in non-heterosexual women.\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nProcedure\nThe participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding sexual orientation and\nnumber of siblings. Sexual orientation was assessed by the Kinsey scales, which range\nfrom 0 for exclusive heterosexuality to 6 for exclusive homosexuality (Kinsey, Pomeroy,\nand Martin, 1948) (See Table 1). The participants were classified as heterosexual if they\nscored zero or one, or as non-heterosexual if they scored two or more (Hall and Love,\nparticipants were told that all of their responses would be anonymous. To further minimize\nthe methodological problem posed by large ethnic variation in 2D:4D ratios, we asked the\nparticipants to report the ethnicity of their mother and father, and only included Finnish\npeople in our analysis.\nTable 1. The Kinsey scale, which was used in our experiment to assess sexual orientation\nRating Description\n0 Exclusively heterosexual\n1 Predominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual\n2 Predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual\n3 Bisexual\n4 Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual\n5 Predominantly homosexual, only incidentally heterosexual\n6 Exclusively homosexual\nX Asexual, Non-sexual\nAfter filling the questionnaire, the participants' hands were photocopied two times\nusing a CanoScan 4400F portable copy machine. The scans were saved in color, with a\nresolution of 96 dpi. Participants were asked to place their hands lightly palm down on the\nsurface of the photocopier with their fingers held separately. After the first scan was taken,\nwe asked the participants to remove their hands from the photocopier, and then place them\non it again for the second scan. Photocopies of the participants' hands were paired with\nmatching identification numbers to their completed questionnaires.\nThe lengths of index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers were measured in each hand by\nusing the ImageJ program (ImageJ 1.42, National Institute of Mental Health, Besheda, MD,\nUSA). The lengths of the digits were measured from the ventral proximal crease of the digit\nto the tip. In the case there were multiple creases at the base of the digit, we took the\nmeasure from the most proximal of these creases (Manning et al.1998; Manning et al.,\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nwe measured the digit ratios of 34 participants from both two pictures of each hand.\nRepeatability of digit ratio was very high for both left (R = 0.90, F33, 34\nonly one picture of the rest of the participants.\nAnalysis\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normality. The finger length\ndata were found to be normally distributed and variances were equal; therefore a two-way\nANOVA was used to compare means in 2D:4D ratios between heterosexual and non-\nheterosexual men and women. The data for number of older siblings were not normally\ndistributed and we were unable to transform it normal. Furthermore, the variances were not\nequal. Therefore, we used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the number of siblings\nbetween heterosexual and non-heterosexual men and women. Equality of variances was\ntested with the Levene's test. Since age did not have significant effect on the results, we\nexcluded this covariate from final analyses. All analyses were performed with PASW\nstatistics 18 \u00adprogram.\nResults\nSex, sexual orientation and 2D:4D ratios\nThe two-way ANOVA revealed that women had significantly higher right hand\nhigher right hand 2D:4D than heterosexuals in both sexes (F1, 840\nFigure 1).

To generalize, previous studies have found that homosexual\nmen had a higher 2D:4D in North America and a lower 2D:4D in Europe compared with\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nheterosexuals (reviewed in Grimbos et al., 2010), which makes our result surprising.\nHowever, this result would be expected in the light of the universal mean hypothesis\n(Manning and Robinson, 2003), which assumes that the universal mean 2D:4D of\nhomosexual men varies between 0.96 and 0.97, since the mean 2D:4D of heterosexual men\nwas clearly lower than this range in our data, whereas that of non-heterosexuals did fit the\nrange. It seems that according to our data the mean 2D:4D ratios of heterosexual men are\nlower in Finland than in many other European countries (for mean 2D:4D ratios in several\nEuropean countries, see Manning 2002; Manning, Churchill and Peters, 2007), which may\nexplain the contradicting results in the relationship between sexual orientation and 2D:4D\nbetween our study and previous studies on Europeans (Grimbos et al., 2010).\nOur study is the first one to find that non-heterosexual women have higher (more\nfeminine) 2D:4D ratios than heterosexual women. As in men, this result was only\nsignificant for the right hand. A recent meta-analysis on 16 independent samples of women\nfound that homosexual women had lower 2D:4D ratios than heterosexual women (Grimbos\net al., 2010). The meta-analysis included samples from both North America and Europe. In\nlight of our study it seems that this relationship does not apply to all populations, but that\ninstead in some populations lower prenatal androgen exposure may be linked to female\nhomosexuality. Further studies are needed to clarify if this positive relationship between\n2D:4D ratio and female homosexuality is found in other populations or whether it is unique\nto Finnish women, and to investigate the causes of these population differences in the\nrelationship between female 2D:4D ratio and sexual orientation.\nIt has been suggested that right-left 2D:4D correlates with prenatal testosterone\nlevels; like a low 2D:4D, a low right-left 2D:4D is thought to associate with high prenatal\ntestosterone (Bennett et al., 2010; Manning et al., 2003). However, we found no significant\neffect of sex or sexual orientation on right-left 2D:4D. Sexual orientation did associate\nmore strongly with right hand 2D:4D though, as its effect was only marginally significant\nin the left hand. The stronger relationship between sexual orientation and 2D:4D ratio in\nthe right hand compared to the left hand has been observed in previous studies (see\nH\u00f6nekopp and Watson, 2010 for a meta-analysis). The sex difference in 2D:4D ratio also\nseems to be greater for the right hand than for the left (H\u00f6nekopp and Watson, 2010).\nSimilarly, Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, and Manning (2004) studied\nthe relationship between prenatal hormone levels and 2D:4D ratios in 2-year-old children,\nand found a significant relationship for the right hand but not for the left hand. It has been\nsuggested that prenatal androgens may have a stronger effect on the right hand than on the\nleft hand, making right-hand 2D:4D a better indicator of prenatal androgen levels than left\n2002), in our study non-heterosexual men had more older brothers than heterosexual men.\nThis fraternal birth order effect has been widely explained with the maternal immunization\nhypothesis (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1996). However, we also found that non-heterosexual\nmen had more older sisters than heterosexual men. The greater number of older sisters in\nnon-heterosexual men indicates that there are other factors that contribute to the higher\nbirth order of homosexual men than the maternal immunization, as it assumes that only\nmale fetuses cause the immunization. To our knowledge previous studies have failed to\nPrenatal androgens and sexual orientation\nfind an association between homosexuality and number of older sisters in men (e.g.,\nBlanchard and Bogaert, 1996; Blanchard, Zucker, Siegelman, Dickey, and Klassen, 1998).\nA factor that might contribute to the association between sexual orientation and number of\nolder siblings could be poorer condition of the womb due to previous pregnancies, which\nmight reflect to the prenatal androgens experienced by the fetus. In accordance with many\nprevious studies we found no difference in number of older siblings between non-\nheterosexual and heterosexual women, which supports theories of gender-specific\nmechanisms in the development of sexual orientation.\nTo conclude, the primary finding of this study was that non-heterosexuals had\nhigher right hand 2D:4D than heterosexuals in both sexes. Overall, the results we obtained\nsupport the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect sexual orientation in both sexes. More\nspecifically, it seems that lower prenatal androgen exposure is connected to homosexuality\nin both sexes in Finland. Contradictory finding with other European populations\nconcerning the relationship between 2D:4D and male homosexuality may be explained by\nthe universal mean hypothesis of homosexual men (Manning and Robinson, 2003), as our\nstudy does support the universal mean of 0.96-0.97 for gay men. In addition to having more\nolder brothers, non-heterosexual men in our sample had more older sisters than\nheterosexual men, which indicates that there are other factors that contribute to the higher\nbirth order of homosexual men than the maternal immunization (Blanchard and Bogaert,\n1996), which is assumed to be induced only by male fetuses. Our data highlight the\nimportance of considering the ethnicity of a sample when studying 2D:4D ratios. We\nencourage further studies especially on the relationship between 2D:4D and female sexual\norientation in different populations, and on the mechanisms by which larger number of\nolder siblings increases the probability of male homosexuality.\n"
