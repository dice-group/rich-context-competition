    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A new wave of state and federal legislation affecting mental health\ninsurance was passed during the 1990s. Although patient advocacy groups\nhave hailed the passage of numerous parity laws, it is unclear whether this\nactivity represents a major improvement in insurance benefits or significantly\nincreases access to mental health care. We investigated this issue with data\nfrom two new national studies sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-\ntion. We found that states with below-average utilization were more likely to\nenactstate legislation, bututilization in those states continues to lagbehind the\nrest of the nation.\nThe 1990s brought a new wave of federal and state legis-\nlative activity in mental health, this time primarily insurance\nmandates that require covering mental health care at the same\nlevel as medical care (\"parity\"). The enactment of a modest federal\nmental health parity bill in 1996 was followed by more ambitious\nstate legislative activity. More than thirty states introduced parity\nlegislation in 1997 alone, and some form of parity mandate had been\nParity legislation was prompted at least in part by the growing\ndiscrepancy between insurance benefits for mental health care and\nfor medical care.

The eventual political success may\nhave been attributable to the confluence of political pressure from\nconsumer and patient organizations, the increased availability of\neffective treatments, scientific findings of biological causes for sev-\neral serious psychiatric diseases, and the growth of managed care to\ncontrol costs. Although parity bills may represent important politi-\ncal events and are widely celebrated by advocates, the new federal\nand state legislation does not necessarily offer meaningful gains in\nthe efficiency and fairness of insurance markets: Richard Frank and\ncolleagues argue that policies aimed at mandating certain benefit-\ndesign structures leave open to managed care many other ways to\ninfluence a person's effective coverage.3 Recent empirical studies\nsupport this argument by showing that employers switching to\nmanaged care see dramatic drops in mental health costs even when\nbenefits are expanded.4\nNonetheless, employer and insurance interest groups claim that\nmental health mandates are overly costly. The Health Insurance\nAssociation of America (HIAA) has commissioned two studies that\nassociate mental health mandates (not just parity legislation) with\nan increase of almost six percentage points in the uninsurance rate\nand dramatic premium increases.5 These studies conflict with other\nresearch, which finds that the average insurance mandate increases\nuninsurance by about 0.04 percent and with recent data suggesting\nthat employers' cost for mental health benefits have been declining.6\nThey also conflict with findings from studies of employers' experi-\nence implementing full parity under managed care.7\nOne reason for the discrepancy in findings is a difference in the\ndata that are used. Some industry studies use cross-sectional data\nand examine differences across states, while other studies analyze\nlongitudinal data and look at changes over time.8 The distinction is\nimportant. Cross-sectional analyses ignore initial differences across\nstates in utilization and costs that existed prior to legislation. All\ndifferences after legislation are assumed to be generated by the legis-\nlation. However, the passage of any legislation is the result of a\npolitical process. The laws that were enacted (and bills that failed)\nare likely to reflect at least in part the balance between competing\ninterest groups. Longitudinal comparisons may control for initial\nstructural differences in utilization and costs by focusing on incre-\nmental changes from a base year before the legislation passed, which\ncan influence the outcome.\nIn this paper we study whether this endogeneity of legislation is\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Using data from two new\nnational studies funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n(RWJF), HealthCare for Communities (HCC) and the Community\nTracking Study (CTS), we examine differences in private insurance\ncoverage, mental health status, and use of mental health care serv-\nices across states with and without state parity legislation.\nBackground On Mental Health Parity Legislation\nThere are two important pieces to mental health parity policy:\nfederal and state legislation. Although several prior attempts to\nmandate equal coverage for mental health at the federal level had\nfailed, in 1996 supporters of mental health mandates were able to\nadd an amendment (Title VII--Parity in the Application of Certain\nLimits to Mental Health Benefits) to an unlikely bill, the Depart-\nments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development,\nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. The amendment,\nwhich became known as the Mental Health Parity Act, took effect in\nJanuary 1998. The law was hailed by patient advocates, who cele-\nbrated that \"[t]he days of [mental health patients'] being cast as\nsecond-class citizens from a health care system historically indiffer-\nent to their needs are over,\" and by politicians, who believed that it\nwould help to \"eradicate the stigma that is commonly placed on\nmental health patients\" and \"wash away the deep rooted ignorance\nof thinking that mental illness is due to some sinful behavior.\"9\nUnfortunately, it is not clear that these expectations have been\nmet. The Parity Act does not require employers to offer mental\nhealth coverage, only that dollar limits on coverage have to be equal\nto dollar limits on medical benefits if mental health coverage is\noffered. Nor does the act impose any conditions on deductibles,\ncopayments, or limits on days or visits, or require coverage for sub-\nstance abuse. This leaves employers and insurers many options to\nreact to the law, including dropping mental health benefits alto-\ngether. The law also exempts plans if the application of the law\nwould result in a cost increase of at least 1 percent of total medical\ncosts, and it exempts small employers (fifty or fewer workers).\nOf course, removing dollar limits could be a major expansion in\nbenefits for the most severely ill, who are most at risk of losing\ninsurance coverage. Among the privately insured population, this\nprimarily means the child dependents of policyholders.10 However,\nno such expansion may occur if employers and insurance plans com-\npensate for it by imposing other constraints. Benefit consulting\nfirms have been advising their clients to impose actuarially equiva-\nlent day or visit limits, for example, thus replacing an annual limit of\nHEALTH\nPARITY\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In a preliminary analysis\nof mental health and substance abuse benefits of 137 employer-spon-\nsored plans before and after 1 January 1998, we found that the\nnumber of network limits expressed in dollars dropped from an\naverage of 2.0 to 0.6 (the remaining dollar limits affecting substance\nabuse care). However, the average number of limits on inpatient\ndays increased from 0.8 to 1.4, and the number of limits on outpa-\ntient visits increased from 0.5 to 0.9.11 Insiders in the managed care\nindustries confirm that this restructuring of benefits, rather than\nexpanding benefits, is the most common response by employers.12\nThe second piece of the parity puzzle is state legislation. Between\n(Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island).\nIn 1997 thirty-four states introduced parity legislation, which be-\ncame law in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, South\nCarolina, Texas, and Vermont, and an additional four states passed\nparity legislation in 1998 (Delaware, Georgia, South Dakota, and\nTennessee) (Exhibit 1). Some of the state laws are symbolic in na-\nture and mirror the federal legislation, perhaps anticipating it by a\nfew months (such as in Arizona, Indiana, and South Carolina).\nOther state mandates are more demanding (and potentially more\ncostly to employers) than the Parity Act. However, state regulations\ndo not apply to self-insured health plans, which are subject to the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. ERISA\npreempts states from regulating employer provisions of health\nplans. However, states can regulate third-party health insurers.\nMany large employers are self-insured; thus, many Americans with\nhealth coverage through a private employer are in plans that are not\nsubject to state mandates. This means that even strict state-level\nparity laws will not affect most people.\nData And Methods\nWe analyze data from two RWJF-funded national surveys.13\nHCC is a project designed to identify variations and track changes\nin health care over time, with a primary focus on mental health and\nsubstance abuse care, while the CTS is focused on tracking changes\nin the medical care system. The two studies are tied together, since\nthe CTS, which has more than 60,000 participants, was used to\nconstruct the sampling frame for the HCC survey. A random sample\nof approximately 25 percent of the adult participants in the CTS\nwas selected for the HCC survey and interviewed between Septem-\nof the HCC household survey with 9,661 respondents (a public re-\nlease file is expected for December 1999) and the public release file of\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

By matching interview dates and\neffective dates for legislation, we were able to define a dummy vari-\nable for all of those living in states that passed some form of parity\nlegislation that became effective prior to the interview date (see\nExhibit 1). No one in our sample was interviewed after November\n1998, so we did not evaluate laws listed in Exhibit 1 that were passed\nafter this date. Approximately one-third of our sample lived in a\nstate that passed some form of parity legislation, and 73 percent of\nthe HCC sample were interviewed after federal parity legislation\nbecame effective. For sensitivity analysis, we also considered three\nalternative definitions of state parity legislation. The first is meant to\ncapture only those states that passed legislation that exceeds the\nfederal law in some dimension, although it may have other loopholes\nor exemptions. Using this \"stricter\" definition of parity, only 17 per-\ncent of our sample lived in a state with an expanded parity law. Two\nother specifications of parity legislation indicate whether the inter-\nview took place either three months or six months after the legisla-\ntion passed. These measures are dummy variables set equal to one\nonly if a state's parity law had been in existence at the time of\ninterview for (1) at least three months or (2) at least six months.\nThese two post\u00adparity legislation indicators would pick up more\nlong-term adjustments in access, utilization, and private insurance\ncoverage that could be attributed to the law, not just short-term\nchanges. None of our main findings presented here is sensitive to\nthese alternative definitions. Finally, because parity legislation is\naimed at private insurance through employer mandates, all of our\nanalyses were done on both the full sample and a subsample of\nprivately insured persons.\nThe main variables related to health care utilization analyzed\nfrom the HCC survey are (1) private insurance versus no insurance\nor public insurance; (2) any use of mental health care in the past\ntwelve months (including primary care providers); (3) any use of\nmental health specialty care in past twelve months; (4) insurance\ncoverage of mental health specialty visits; and (5) number of mental\nhealth specialty visits among users.14 Because it also is possible to\nconstruct measures of mental health status in the HCC survey, we\nalso examined mental health status as indicated by the mental\nhealth inventory scale from the Medical Outcomes Study.15 This\nscale represents a person's general mental well-being as indicated by\nthe mean score of five questions inquiring of that person's (emo-\ntional) feelings during the past four weeks. A higher score suggests\nbetter feelings.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The one\nmental health utilization item that can be derived from both surveys\nis the use of any mental health specialty care in the past twelve\nmonths. Further, the CTS includes only two of the five questions\nused to construct the complete mental health inventory scale in the\nHCC survey. However, it is possible to construct a similar mental\nhealth status indicator using these two questions in both surveys.\nWe therefore constructed a second measure of mental health status,\nin which distress is indicated by frequently feeling \"down and blue\"\nor by infrequently feeling \"calm and peaceful.\" A higher score here\nindicates greater distress.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics of the key variables from the HCC house-\nhold survey are provided in Exhibit 2.

Despite virtu-\nally identical levels in these key demand indicators, the remaining\ndescriptive statistics show that significant differences exist in ac-\ncess to and use of mental health care. The proportion of persons\nreporting any mental health care (which could be in primary care) or\nany mental health specialty care is lower in states that have passed\nparity legislation. Similarly, we found that among persons who re-\nceived some mental health care, those living in states with parity\nlaws had almost two fewer visits to specialists. When we restricted\nour sample to just the privately insured, we found that the mental\nhealth status index gets smaller (better mental health), but this was\ntrue for both types of states, and there was no significant difference\nbetween parity and nonparity states. In contrast, all of the differ-\nences in measures of mental health services use remain statistically\nsignificant, and the difference in the number of mental health spe-\ncialty visits gets even larger.\nRegarding insurance for mental health specialty care among us-\ners, fewer patients in parity states had those visits covered by insur-\nance. When we restricted the sample to only the privately insured,\nthe difference was no longer statistically significant. The drop in\nsignificance, however, is more likely due to the smaller sample size\nthan to the absence of a substantively meaningful effect size.\nThe finding that parity states have generally lower rates of utili-\nzation than nonparity states have, despite similar indicators of men-\ntal health care demand, contradicts what we would have expected.\nClearly, if there were a one-way causality from legislation to utiliza-\ntion, the latter should be higher in states that have more mandated\nbenefits and coverage. However, these differences in descriptive sta-\ntistics may be driven by other confounding factors that have not\nbeen accounted for, such as age, sex, income, ethnicity, insurance,\nregion, federal parity legislation, general mental health status, or\nother chronic health conditions. Multivariate logistic regression\nanalyses reveal that these statistically significant differences persist\neven after these potentially confounding factors are controlled for.\nThe results presented in Exhibit 2, taken at face value, are incon-\nsistent with the notion that parity legislation increases utilization\nand therefore costs. It seems implausible, however, that the enact-\nment of parity legislation leads to lower rates of utilization. Instead,\n\"The difference in use of mental health services between states\nbefore and after legislation is almost identical.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nthe results strongly suggest reverse causality--namely, that states\nlagging behind the nation in use of mental health care were more\nlikely to pass parity laws. The passage of parity legislation, or any\nmental health mandate, is the result of a political process, with\npatient advocacy groups and provider organizations generally\nworking for it and employer and insurance associations generally\nworking against it. States that were able to pass legislation may have\nhad lower utilization to begin with, thereby motivating proponents\nto push hard for the legislation, or fewer affected persons, thereby\nreducing opposition to the legislation.\nBecause it is impossible to account for reverse causality with\ncross-sectional data, one must be cautious interpreting the results\npresented in Exhibit 2. The issue can be resolved only through the\nuse of panel data. Since the larger CTS is the precursor to the HCC\nsurvey, we do have some information on insurance and utilization\nacross states two years before the HCC survey and before many\nstates enacted parity legislation.\nIt would be useful to examine differences in mental health need\nand use of specialty services between states that eventually enacted\nparity legislation during the two years between the surveys and\nthose that did not. Several states had already enacted parity legisla-\ntion at the time of the CTS, however. To make this evaluation as\nclean as possible, we decided to contrast states that eventually\npassed parity legislation with all other states. The definition of parity\nstates in Exhibit 3, therefore, is slightly different than in Exhibit 2.\nExhibit 3 reports the findings from simple descriptive statistics\nfor the CTS sample.

However, for both the full\nsample and the privately insured sample, the rate of any mental\nhealth specialty care in the previous twelve months was signifi-\ncantly higher in states that were not going to pass a state parity bill\nthan in states that were going to enact some state legislation. More-\nover, this difference of 1.5\u00ad1.7 percentage points is almost identical\nto the difference between the two types of states in Exhibit 2, which\nis based on data collected after the state legislation had been in force\n(and, for most respondents, after the federal Mental Health Parity\nAct had been effective as well).\nConclusions\nWe draw two main conclusions. First, the results provide some\nempirical support of the political-economy argument as to why\nstates pass parity laws. Those that do have fewer people using men-\ntal health care services to begin with, and this is not related to\ndifferences in population characteristics or sickness levels. We\ntested for an association between legislation and supply as meas-\nured by the number of psychiatrists per thousand persons, number\nof psychologists per thousand persons, or health maintenance or-\nganization (HMO) penetration, but we found none. Second, any\npositive effect that state parity legislation may have on utilization is\ntoo minor to overcome the initial difference in utilization that exists\nbetween states with and without legislation. In fact, the difference\nbetween states before and after legislation is almost identical.\nThis study provides a good reminder of the limitations of cross-\nsectional studies pertaining to the effects of health regulations and\nlegislation. Because legislation is the result of a political process,\nwith very vocal interest groups on both sides of an issue, cross-\nsectional findings of the effects of legislation are prone to be misun-\nderstood and may even be misused for political purposes.\nWinnie Zhang provided the data management and programming support for this\nproject.
