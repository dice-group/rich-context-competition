Bosman.\nEmail: f.g.bosman@tilburguniversity.edu\nGames and Culture\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/gac\nlife--vegetable, animal, and human--is under constant threat from toxic radiation,\nfrom the mutants resulting from this radiation, and from civil war between multiple\nhuman factions.\nIn this pessimistic world, the game protagonist, called \"the Lone Wanderer,\"\nultimately discovers a large isolated apartment complex in the middle of the desert.\nThe complex is named after the owner, Alister Tenpenny, and is heavily fortified and\nguarded against the dangers of the wasteland. The tower houses a number of rich\ntenants who are strongly opposed to the ghouls who are trying to get in. The\nghouls--mutated humans who are unpleasant to look at, but still possess human\nintelligence and morality--argue that they are as human as the tenants are and\ndemand housing in the tower. The tenants, however, fear and loathe the ghouls\nwhom they consider to be subhuman.\nThe player--as the Lone Wanderer--has to decide how to handle this situation:\nHe has to help either Tenpenny get rid of the ghouls once and for all (which means\nkilling them all) or the ghouls to take over the tower (which means that the ghouls\nwill kill all the tenants). When I played the game myself, this quest struck me as\nbeing morally difficult. Both sides--the ghouls and the tenants--have their (morally\nambivalent) motivations to want what they want, and killing one of the two groups\nseemed hardly a morally adequate solution or a pleasant experience for me as a\nplayer.\nI felt rather smart for finding a third option, which was to convince the tenants to\nlet the ghouls enter the tower. Initially, the results were good, as ghouls and tenants\nseemed to be living together relatively happily in Tenpenny Tower. But when I\nvisited the Tower 2 days later (in terms of the game's internal chronology), I found\nout that the ghouls had killed all the original tenants. I was shocked by this unin-\ntended but horrible outcome of my \"ideal solution.\"\nThis Tenpenny Tower quest from Fallout 3 is a prime example of ethical game-\nplay: The player is confronted with a difficult (moral) problem that he has to solve in\norder to progress through the game. But because it is impossible for the player of\nFallout 3 to know all the possible solutions beforehand, he has to follow his con-\nscience and hope for the best.\nMethodology\nIn more formal terms, this ethical gameplay (as it occurs in Fallout 3) can be defined\nas \"the outcome of a game sequence in which players take definitive choices based\non moral thinking, rather than instrumental thinking. Ethical gameplay is, in other\nwords, the outcome of moral play\" (Sicart, 2010, p. 104). Ideally, the moral dilem-\nmas that the game presents to the player break the fluidity of the gameplay, \" . . . a\ncaesura that forces players to evaluate their behaviors in light of ethical thinking,\nrather than ludic strategic thinking\" (Sicart, 2013a, p. 31).\nNot all video games offer ethical gameplay, and not all games that do, do so in the\n2 Games and Culture XX(X)\nargued that many of the ethical dilemmas presented to the player by the game are\nlacking in ludological quality and narratological depth. Too often, moral problems\nthat the game presents to the player can be solved easily once the ethical framework\nof the game is understood, or on the basis of help from the visible moral feedback of\nthe game, and/or simply by experimenting with the different outcomes by using\n(exploiting) the game's saving/loading system. And last but not least, moral choices\noften do not have much ludological and/or narratological repercussions on the rest of\nthe game.\nIn this article, I focus on ethical gameplay and more precisely on the nature of the\nmoral problems it presents to the player. How \"real\" are these moral dilemmas? Can\nthey be (easily) circumvented by exploiting in-game mechanics? Does the game\noffer an \"ideal solution\"? Do the moral choices that the player makes in the game\nhave any consequences for gameplay and/or narrative?\nFor this analysis, I use the concept of \"wicked problems,\" which originated in the\ndomain of social engineering (Rittel & Weber, 1973). It is a widely used concept to\ndenote problems which are (very) difficult or even (potentially) impossible to solve\nbecause of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements. Moreover, the\nconcept has been used specifically in game studies to think about ethical gameplay\n(Sicart, 2010). I will return to this concept later on.\nTwo approaches to ethical gameplay have been identified: game agency or player\nagency (Knoll, 2015). The first is a game-immanent concept focusing on the agency\n\"provided by the game through game mechanics, rules, level architecture ( . . . )\nnarrative (and even aesthetic) structures directly dependent on these systems.\" The\nsecond is an actor-centered approach that focuses on the agency of the player, that\ncan take \"various forms and is heavily dependent on individual expectations of a\ngame, personal preferences and of course socialization and in some cases even\nreligious denomination.\" I will focus on game agency in this article (not player\nagency per se).\nAs has been seen, this game agency focus is based on a game-immanent approach\nactual game is essential to this approach (internal reading) as is collecting all in-\ngame information (internal research), mapping the intermedial relationships\nbetween the game and other media relating to the same complex of interwoven\nnarratives (external reading), and gathering all outgame information provided by\nfellow players and scholars (external research; Bosman, 2016).\nIn this context, digital games are essentially regarded as \"digital (interactive),\nplayable (narrative) texts\" (Bosman, 2016, p. 30). As a text, a video game can be an\nobject of interpretation; as a narrative, it can be regarded as communicating mean-\ning; as a game, it is playable; and as a digital medium, it is interactive in nature\n(Ryan, 2006). This definition makes it possible to theorize about video game narra-\ntives from a philosophical (or sociological or psychological, etc.) point of view.\nThe structure of this article is as follows. First, I will introduce and reflect on two\nimportant and constitutive notions concerning ethical gameplay in the context of this\nresearch: morality systems (second section) and wicked problems (third section).\nSecond, I will differentiate between four kinds of moral problems within ethical\ngameplay: tame moral problems, semi-wicked problems, real wicked problems, and\nsuper wicked problems, each of which present a greater (moral) challenge to the\nplayer (fourth section). Finally, I will summarize and propose some suggestions for\nfurther research (fifth section).\nThis article is aimed at exploring the different ludological and narratological\n\"settings\" in which the moral dilemmas are presented to the game by the game\ndevelopers and how \"intelligent\"--in terms of feed-back and repercussions on the\nrest of the game (ending)--they are deployed by the developers. This focus implies\nthat some other--even interesting and certainly related--topics cannot be addressed,\nespecially not in the context of one article. This article, therefore, dismisses the\ndifferentiation one could make between the player (as a human agent) and the avatar\nhe is controlling in the game. Also, the insight, that the ethical decisions a player\nmakes in the game through his avatar, may (or may not) differ from the decisions a\nplayer would make in real-life is not further reflected upon in this article. Experi-\nmenting with different ethical \"stances\" throughout one or more play throughs are\ncertainly interesting as a topic for scholarly research, but this article is not aimed at\nthis \"tension\" between in-game and real-life ethical choices, but at the different\nways developers present their moral problems to the player.\nOne could also argue that moral dilemmas in video games are in themselves less\ncomplicated than real-life situations because of technical and other practical limita-\ntions. This may be true, but this does not prevent to evaluate the different ways in\nwhich the developers have succeeded in presenting an \"interesting\" (\"wicked\")\nmoral dilemma to the player (or not), by comparing them mutually based on certain\n(technical and ethical) qualifications (as I will do in this article).\nMorality Systems in Digital Games\nMorality systems are one of the most prominent (and visible) ways in which ethical\ngameplay is used in video games. Games such as Fallout 3, the Mass Effect series\nvideo game morality systems can be defined as implicit or explicit digital systems\nwithin a particular game that morally rate certain player actions and/or choices on\nthe basis of a presupposed ethical framework. In most games with a morality system,\nthe player is rewarded when he saves innocent people but penalized when he steals\nor robs people. Intriguingly enough, however, there are some games in which killing\nthe bad guy is counted as \"good\" while stealing from him as \"bad.\"\nThese morality systems can be either implicit or explicit. In the former case, the\nplayer is unaware of the presence of the system in the game. The player does not\nknow that the game has a morality system and/or does not know the criteria used in\n4 Games and Culture XX(X)\nthe morality system. The player is unaware of the (subtle) changes in gameplay and/\nor narrative that are caused by his moral actions based on the way they are rated by\nthe morality system because he lacks means of comparison or because the changes\noccur only explicitly at the end of the game. The game Metro Last Light (4A Games,\n2013) is a good example. There are multiple instances in the game where player\nactions are \"measured,\" for example, when the game protagonist Artyom has the\nchoice to kill or save his worst enemy Pavl. The only consequence of this system is a\nslightly different ending to the game, but the player is oblivious to this because he\ndoes not know that another ending is possible.\nA video game morality system can also be explicit: This means that the player is\naware of the presence of the system in a particular game. The player knows that the\ngame has a morality system and also knows the criteria it uses (or is able to find out\nthrough simple experimentation) because this is evident from feedback that the\nsystem gives and that visualizes the in-game moral judgment through some sort\nof \"morality chart.\"\nA morality chart that the morality system uses to rate player actions and choices\ncan be in the form of a \"scale\" or a \"meter\" model. In a scale model, the morality of\nthe player's in-game choices is rated by the sum of all his or her ethically qualified\nchoices in the game, placing the player's moral behavior on a scale ranging from\ngood to evil (or neutral). A good example is Fallout 3, which calculates the moral\n\"status\" on a line ranging from very evil (\u00c0750 to \u00c01,000 \"karma points\") to very\ngood (\u00fe750 to \u00fe1,000 karma points). Moral \"levels\" often have colorful names such\nas \"scourge of humanity\" and \"harbinger of war\" (for bad karma) and \"last hope of\nhumanity\" and \"ambassador of peace\" (for good karma).\nIn a meter model, the in-game actions of the player are rated by (at least) two\ndifferent meters--usually \"good\" and \"evil\"--which keep track of all his or her\nethically qualified choices in the game, allowing the player to be (more or less) good\nand evil at the same time. The Mass Effect series is a good example. Certain sets of\nactions result in the player being designated as \"paragon\" (morally just actions) or\n\"renegade\" (morally unjust actions). This means that in this series, it is possible to be\na little bit of a renegade (evil) but overwhelmingly a paragon (good) at the same time\n(or the other way around), a feature that enables more differentiated character\ndevelopment.\nWhile morality systems are a well-established game mechanic, they have come\nnature of the systems, their selective morality, the inconsistency of the rule sys-\ntems, and the notion of \"ludonarrative dissonance\" (Hocking, 2007). Especially\nthe last criticism is important with regard to ethical gameplay. If in any given\ngame, the game's narrative conflicts with its mechanics, the ethical gameplay is\ndisturbed because the player experiences a divide between what the game seems\nto ask from the player (moral behavior) and what the game actually makes the\nplayer do (gunning down hordes of enemies). Of course, this could be intended\nas such by the game developers as some sort of meta-ethical discussion, but it\nhardly ever is.\nAs Sicart (2013a) has mentioned, the problem with many morality systems\n(especially the explicit ones) is that the gameplay actually encourages ludos-\ntrategic behavior in gamers instead of the required narratological\u00adethical beha-\nvior (Knoll, 2014). This means that players are more inclined to look for the\nbiggest advantage in terms of gameplay and to disregard the morally charged\ngame narrative.\nSicart (2013a) has also argued that most moral dilemmas in video games can be\neasily circumvented by experimenting (exploiting) the load/save system of the\ngame. It is quite possible, especially in cases that have only short-term conse-\nquences, to literally try all possible options in any given dilemma until the best\nresult is achieved. This of course \"kills\" the most important aspect of ethical game-\nplay, that is, the decision is one-off and irreversible. This problem can be solved by\nresorting exclusively to long-term consequences--such as Life is Strange (Dontnod\nEntertainment, 2015), for example--but this is rarely done because of the strain such\nan elaborate system of long-term consequences produces in terms of technological\nand narratological elaborations.\nFinally, I want to address one last problem concerning ethical gameplay in\ngeneral and morality systems in particular. Most games offering moral dilemmas\ntend to incorporate at least one \"ideal solution.\" Rather than mirroring the moral\nambiguity of everyday life, these games suggest that--at least theoretically--there\nis always one solution that morally outweighs all the other solutions and is thus\npreferable. This type of game also often requires an external \"police\" to govern\nplayer agency.\nThe Concept of Wicked Problems\nTo bring our reflection on ethical gameplay and morality systems to the next level,\nI introduce the concept of wicked problems. I argue that this concept makes it\npossible to differentiate between different forms of ethical gameplay that the\ngame presents to the player, essentially to find a model that meets the criticisms\ndiscussed earlier.\nAs has been seen, the concept of wicked problems originates in the context of\nsocial engineering. The term was coined by Rittel and Webber in their 1973 article\n\"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning.\" The authors claimed there that \"the\nsearch for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail,\nbecause of the nature of these problems. They are `wicked' problems, whereas\nscience has been developed to deal with `tame' problems.\" Rittel and Webber\npresent 10 distinguishing characteristics of planning-type problems. Conklin\n(2006) broadened the notion of wicked problems to make it applicable to other fields\nof human endeavor while reducing the number of characteristics to six.\n6 Games and Culture XX(X)\n1. The problem is not understood until after a solution has been formulated. The\ninformation needed to understand the problem depends upon one's idea for\nsolving it.\n2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule. The problem solver quits his\nproblem-solving job not because he knows he has done his job to full perfec-\ntion but because of external motivations, that is, he runs out of time, money,\nor patience.\n3. Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong. The quality of the\noutcome of the solution to a wicked problem cannot be determined unam-\nbiguously, because there are no established criteria for this. The outcome is\n\"good\" or \"good enough\" rather than \"right\" or \"wrong.\"\n4. Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique and cannot be reduced\nto a problem experienced or described before.\n5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a \"one-shot operation.\" It is not\npossible to experiment because the consequences of one's choice cannot\nbe reversed to try a different one.\n6. Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions. There may be no solution\nat all, and/or there may be a solution that no one has ever thought of before.\nSicart (2013a) tried to apply the notion of wicked problems to the field of ethical\ngameplay, and his attempt resulted in the formulation of 10 characteristics of the\n\"perfect moral dilemma\" (my formulation) in a video game (and I quote):\n1. The player's knowledge of possible outcomes will be limited by ethical\ncognitive friction between the semiotic and the procedural domains. The\nplayer does not have perfect information about the potential outcome of a\ndilemma.\n2. Ethical gameplay dilemmas have consequences that cannot be predicted by\nunderstanding only the procedural level of the game. Knowing how the\nsystem works should not be enough to make a decision because some\naspects of the system that affect the outcome are unknown to the player.\n3. The evaluation of the outcome by the game system will not be commu-\nnicated to the player in quantized terms.\n4. After players make a choice, they cannot reload to a state that is prior to that\nchoice.\n5. Every solution to an ethical gameplay dilemma locks players into a news\nstate of the game. They are not able to return to prior states. All decisions\nmatter.\n6. Ethical gameplay dilemmas have some solutions that make the procedural\nand semantic level collide, suggesting nonoptimal strategies that have emo-\ntional, cultural, and contextual values.\n7. Ethical gameplay dilemmas tend to be unique. A dilemma's structure\nshould not be repeated through the game.\n8. Ethical gameplay dilemmas reveal the moral nature of the semiotic and\nprocedural domains of the game. Dilemmas represent the values that\ndesigners want to communicate with the game.\n9. There is no correct solution to an ethical gameplay dilemma. Players have to\nevaluate the morality of their choices.\n10. Players have no right to replay. Decisions made by players bind them to\ntheir chosen path, and the game, in the state determined by the choice taken,\nis playable only once.\nIn this article, I want to carry Sicart's thinking on ethical gameplay a little further\nby using the notion of wicked problems, not to sketch an ideal game scenario (as\nSicart did) but to differentiate how actual video games (and instances within these\ngames) use ethical gameplay and/or morality systems.\n4. Tame, Semi-, Real, and Super Wicked Problems\nBased on the concepts of wicked problems, I want to propose a four-level\ndifferentiation in ethical gameplay: tame, semi-wicked, real wicked, and super\nwicked (moral) problems. The constitutive parts (criteria) of this differentiation\nare:\n1. the extent to which the specific problem stimulates narratological\u00adethical\ngameplay,\n2. the extent to which it is possible to solve the problem by exploiting the\nloading/saving mechanism of the game,\n3. the temporary nature of the consequences of a particular choice,\n4. the presence of an \"ideal solution\", and\n5. the present and nature of any feedback given to the player by the game.\nThe first criterion is necessary for the existence of a wicked problem in the\nfirst place. The second criterion factor focuses on the ludological element of\nethical gameplay, while the third one focuses on the game's narratological\nelement. The fourth criterion concentrates on the extent to which the given\nmoral problem is presented as a moral dilemma, enhancing its \"wicked nature.\"\nThe fifth criterion handles the feedback (if any) given to the player by the game\nin regard to the in-game evaluation of the player's moral actions. The explicit\nnature of this kind of feedback (usually in the form of a morality system)\ninfluences the complexity of the moral decisions as I have discussed earlier in\nthe article.\nI elaborate on these different kinds of wicked problems subsequently on the basis\nof various examples of video games that use these kinds of problems.\n8 Games and Culture XX(X)\nTame moral problems. The first sort of wicked problem is not actually wicked at all\nbut \"tame.\" Tame moral problems in video games \"involve a decision that looks\nmoral but is only a consequentialist calculation of outcomes\" (Sicart, 2013b, p. 105).\nTame moral problems involve no \"wickedness\" and stimulate ludostrategic instead\nof the required narratological\u00adethical behavior.\nA few examples of tame moral problems can be found in the game Fallout 3.\nFallout 3 is a first-/third-person, action role-playing, open-world video game\nproduced by Bethesda Softwork in 2008. The game features a post-apocalyptic\nretrofuture, covering an area including Washington DC, northern Virginia, and\nparts of Maryland. The vast majority of inhabitants have been killed by atomic\nbombs during a Great War or by the radiation resulting from the detonation of\nthese bombs. Humans have to share the limited resources with all kinds of\nmutants who are generally hostile to \"normal\" humans. During his adventures\nand quests in this wasteland, the gamer--in the persona of the game's only\nprotagonist called `the Lone Wanderer'--comes across a number of minor\n\"moral\" situations that add good or bad karma to his character (as I have\nexplained earlier).\nPositive karma can be gained by a number of actions. Some are rather obvious,\nlike donating money to a church, helping to repair a water-processing plant,\ngiving clean water to beggars, deactivating a bomb, or freeing slaves. Other\n\"good\" choices are a little more far-fetched, like selling the fingers taken from\nthe corpses of evil characters or providing a gun to particular persons for reasons\nof self-defense. Bad karma results from other actions, some of which are the\nexact opposite of the good karma actions: stealing (from good and bad characters\nalike), breaking into someone's computer, killing a \"good\" character, giving\ncontaminated water to beggars, enslaving waste landers, allowing someone to\ncommit suicide, helping addicts get their drugs, and selling ears from the corpses\nof good characters.\nThe \"tameness\" of the moral problems that the gamer encounters lies in their\nshallowness. Gamers do not make these decisions based on moral thinking (narra-\ntologically based) but on strategic thinking (ludologically based), based on the kind\nof player they intend to be, good or evil. The explicit nature of the morality systems\nmakes it abundantly clear what actions the developers consider to be good or evil. As\nsoon as the gamer has decided to play as a good or evil character, the choices lose\ntheir moral appeal altogether. Even the stranger moral values, such as selling the\nfingers of bad persons (for good karma) or giving addicted persons the drugs they\nneed to survive (for bad karma), lose their wickedness as soon as the player has\nperformed them.\nSemi-wicked problems. The second form of wicked problems are semi- (or pseudo-)\nwicked problems. Semi-wicked problems do inspire narratological\u00adethical behavior\nin the gamer (rather than ludostrategic behavior), but the problem itself can be\nsolved relatively easily by exploiting the game's saving/loading system. The player\nis able to empirically explore all the (unforeseen) consequences of all possible\nsolutions within the game. This works especially well with explicit morality systems\nwith short-term consequences. The moral problem is real on the level of the narrative\nbut has no consequences on the ludological level.\nThis kind of wicked problem occurs, for example, numerous times in the Mass\nEffects series, a series that has been the subject of scholarly research concerning\nethical gameplay before (Boyan, 2015; Knoll, 2015). The games in the Mass Effect\nseries, which consists of three interconnected games, can be characterized as second-\nperson (over-the-shoulder), action role-playing games. All three installments\nin the first (and the second) game are transferred to the second (and third) install-\nment, creating an interlinked narratological and ludological unity. The series is set\nwithin the near future (end of the 22nd century), where interstellar travel is possible\nthrough a network of Mass Relays. The relays were built by a now extinct alien race\nknown as the Protheans.\nWith the help of Prothean technology discovered on Mars, humankind takes a\ndecisive step into the galactic arena, where there are many sentinel and space-\ntraveling races. The Milky Way is governed by a conglomerate body known as the\nCitadel Council, which is dominated by the three most powerful races in our galaxy,\nAsari, Salarians, and Turians, later also joined by humanity. The player's moral\nbehavior is explicitly recorded and evaluated by means of two morality meters,\n\"paragon\" (good) and \"renegade\" (evil), as I described earlier in this article.\nIn the three game installments, the player gathers multiple teammates from dif-\nferent in-game races who can be chosen by the player to accompany him on mis-\nsions. These teammates and their respective races have all kinds of psychological\nand emotional problems arising from their individual deeds (before joining She-\npard's crew) and/or from the fact that their respective races are at war with each\nother. In a number of instances, Shepard (the player) has to intervene between\nteammates in order to prevent them from leaving or--even worse--getting killed.\nThese \"rescues\" have to be performed in dialog scenes, where the player can choose\nfrom different options of what to say. I will give an example.\nIn the Mass Effect universe, the Korgan race (battle-hardened lizards) has been\ninfected by what is called the \"genophage,\" which makes all females infertile. The\ngenophage was used by the Turians against the Krogan, but it was developed by the\nSalarians. When Shepard lands on the planet Virmire, the player can choose a\nKrogan by the name of Wrex (who was earlier recruited by Shepard) as his team-\nmate. Then Shepard, Wrex, and the other teammate run into a Salarian squad, which\nhas its own mission on Virmire. The player learns from the Salarians that they have\ncome to stop Saren (a rogue Turian) from curing the genophage. Saren wants to cure\nthe genophage in order to breed his private army of Korgan warriors. Wrex, under-\nstandably, is not amused to hear that the only cure for his race is about to be\ndestroyed. And he turns for answers to Shepard who wants to stop Saren from\naccomplishing his goals.\n10 Games and Culture XX(X)\nThis standoff between Shepard and Wrex has two possible outcomes: (1) Shepard\n\"convinces\" Wrex to fight against Saren together with the Salarians by destroying\nthe cure. (2) Wrex is killed. The \"convincing\" can have different forms: Shepard\nmay charm Wrex or intimidate him, or he can already have obtained Wrex's trust.\nThe killing of Wrex can be carried out by either Shepard himself or another team-\nmate. Intimidating or killing Wrex will gain renegade points (designated by the\nmorality system as morally unjust), charming or \"gaining his trust\" earns paragon\npoints (designated as morally just). When one of the player's squad kills Wrex, the\nawarding of points depends on his reaction to this event: An angry response by\nShepard earns renegade points, a grateful response paragon points.\nWhile the dilemma between helping the Salerians to stop Saren from misusing the\nTurians by lifting the genophage on the one hand, and the need to keep Wrex healthy\nand wholeheartedly on one's side on the other seems like a real moral conundrum, in\nfact it is not. Not only is there an ideal solution--convincing Wrex to help the player\nto stop Saren--it is also easy to find it by going through the dialog options multiple\ntimes, until all the possible solutions (and the corresponding paragon and renegade\npoints) have been tried. The player can decide how to act on this basis. The possi-\nbility of exploiting the saving/loading mechanism of the game makes this problem a\nsemi-wicked problem rather than a real one.\nReal wicked problems. The third form of wicked problems in video games is what I\nwould call \"real\" wicked problems. These problems cannot be solved easily by\nmultiple saves/loads because the morality system is implicit and/or the moral\nchoices have long-term consequences. A morally ideal solution may be available,\nbut it can be identified only in hindsight.\nThe first example is Metro Last Light, released in 2013. These games share the\nsame game mechanics and world. Metro Last Light is a single-player, first-person\nshooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements set in a postapocalyptic\nworld. The game features a what-if history, a representation of our collective past\ndiverting from reality in certain key elements (Hellekson, 2001). In this case, a\nmassive nuclear war occurred in 2013 leaving Moscow--where the game is set--\nwith severe radiation damage. The survivors have gone to live in metro stations and\nare fighting over limited resources. Many animals were mutated into aggressive\nbeasts, which makes traveling on the surface dangerous.\nMetro Last Light features an implicit morality system that tracks certain decisions\nthe gamer makes during his play through and offers two distinct alternative endings\nbased on these decisions. Some points of decision are subtle, others more obvious.\nBut since the player is unaware of the tracking device, he does not know that he is\nbeing morally judged by the game. The subtle instances where the game makes\nmoral judgments of the player's behavior include whether or not to play a guitar\n(in the \"Introduction\" level), whether or not to stay near an ally (level \"Ashes\"), or\nwhether or not to listen to conversations between nonplayable characters (level\n\"Bolshoi\"). More obvious instances (obvious only once the player has become aware\nof the morality system) include whether or not the player approaches unknown\nentities in a violent manner (level Introduction), releases prisoners (level \"Pavl\"),\nor kills enemies that are surrendering (level \"Reich\").\nThe \"realness\" of the wicked problems that Metro Last Light presents to the\nplayer lies in the implicitness of the morality system, which prevents the player\nfrom executing ludostrategic behavior. The decision to kill or to spare the lives of\nenemies who are surrendering can only be taken on the level of narratological\u00ad\nethical gameplay. Only when a player has finished one play through (and/or reads\nabout the game on the Internet) and becomes aware of the existence of the morality\nsystem, can he or she play the game a second time with new knowledge that permits\nhim or her to decide to take other values into account (e.g., to play the good or the\nbad guy in the game). Before that, it is impossible to exploit the game's saving/\nloading mechanism because the player does not know that he is being \"tracked.\"\nAnd because the game does not give any visible or audible feedback, the player does\nnot know which decisions are being tracked and how they are evaluated (although it\nis possible to guess of course).\nSuper wicked problems. The fourth, last, and--in my opinion--most important kind of\nwicked problems in video games are \"super\" wicked problems. No player can offer\nany satisfactory solution to this kind of moral problem, not even in hindsight, simply\nbecause there is no morally correct solution. Every choice, even in hindsight, has\nboth good and evil consequences. I will give two examples.\nFor the first example, I return to the game Mass Effect discussed above in relation\nto its semi-wicked moral problems. As has been seen, many of the fights between\nteammates can be solved by the player simply by experimenting with the different\ndialog options and exploiting the game's saving/loading system. But there is one\nparticular instance where the semi-wicked problem becomes a super wicked problem.\nIn the first Mass Effect game, Commander Shepard is sent to investigate the\nhuman colony of Eden Prime to recover an unearthed Prothean beacon. During the\ninspection, Shepard and his crew are attacked by Geth (a race of self-conscious\nartificial intelligences) under the secret leadership of the Turian Saren Arterius, a\ncouncil high officer-turned-rogue. The rest of the first Mass Effect is dedicated to\nunmasking this Saren as the mastermind behind the Geth attacks on the Milky Way's\nother space-traveling races.\nOn the planet Virmire, Shepard and his crew eventually discover Saren's secret\nbase, which they plan to destroy using a massive nuclear device. However, the crew\nis surprised by another legion of Geth soldiers, and this leads to a very difficult moral\ndilemma for the player. Two of Shepard's teammates, Ashley Williams and Kaidan\nAlenko, are pinned down by the Geth on two different locations on Virmire. There is\nonly time to save one of them, and the game stalls indefinitely until one of the two\noptions is selected. There is no third or \"ideal\" solution.\nFor almost all situations, there is a third option to save both teammates (as we\nhave seen), but the Kaidan/Ashley dilemma is unique because this ideal solution is\n12 Games and Culture XX(X)\nnot provided. The player must choose who will die and who will live. That this\nchoice matters to players is evident from the existence of many online discussions,\nwhere players mourn the fact that either Ashley or Kaidan must die and/or discuss\nwhy they chose one or the other. To see an example, it is necessary only to visit the\nBioWare forum (https://forum.bioware.com) and search for \"Kaidan-Ashley.\"\nThese discussions on this kind of Internet forums could be considered as a viable\nend-game place to participate and discuss the morality of different moral choices\nwithin the game.\nFor a second example of a super wicked problem in a video game, I return to Fallout\n3, and more specifically to the Tenpenny quest, which was already discussed above.\nFallout 3 is a first-/third-person, action role-playing, open-world video game\nproduced by Bethesda Softwork in 2008. The game features a postapocalyptic\nretro-future, covering an area including Washington DC, northern Virginia, and\nparts of Maryland. The vast majority of inhabitants have been killed by atomic\nbombs during a Great War or by the radiation resulting from the detonation of these\nbombs. Humans have to share the limited resources with all kinds of mutants who\nare generally hostile to \"normal\" humans. This specific quest has previously\nreceived scholarly attention, specifically for its ethical gameplay dimension\nTenpenny Tower is a prewar luxury hotel, which stands alone in the middle of the\ndesert. Upon inquiry, the player learns that the tower is the property of Alister Ten-\npenny who has turned the hotel into a private, elite residential and commercial build-\ning that permits only wealthy (and truly \"human\") residents. As he approaches the\nentrance of the tower, the player overhears an intercom conversation between a ghoul\nby the name of Roy Phillips (who stands outside) and the head of security, Chief\nGustavo (who is inside). Roy demands that he and his fellow ghouls be allowed to\nenter so as to live safe and comfortable lives inside. Gustavo harshly rejects Roy's\nrequest, adding all kinds of racial slurs against ghouls. Roy disappears into the dis-\ntance, uttering threats to the effect that he will find a way to get what he wants.\nThe player can now choose to go inside the premises and talk to Gustavo or to\nfollow Roy to his hideout in Warrington metro station. If he decides to talk to\nGustavo, he is given the offer to hunt down and kill Roy and his family, thus\nremoving the constant threat they pose to Tenpenny Tower, in exchange for a large\nsum of money. Whether the player accepts the offer or not, the next stop takes him to\nRoy in Warrington Station. After a conversation, Roy asks the player to help him to\nget into Tenpenny Tower. The player has to open an emergency exit in the basement\nof the tower, allowing Roy to send in his \"feral brethren\" who will almost certainly\nkill all of Tenpenny's tenants.\nAt this point, the player has four different options. The first is to help Gustavo by\nkilling Roy and his family and then to return to Tenpenny Tower to receive his\nreward (getting good karma by the morality system). The second option is to help\nRoy by letting his \"feral\" friends into the tower who will then proceed to kill all the\ntenants (receiving bad karma). A third option is to help Roy, not however by opening\nthe backdoor but by killing all the tenants and security guards himself (also leading\nto bad karma). A fourth option, the most difficult one, is to convince both Alister\nTenpenny and his tenants to willingly open the doors of their residence to Roy and\nthe other ghouls (good karma)\nThe morally problematic nature of the Tenpenny episode becomes very clear\nwhen we examine the different conversations with Roy and his fellow ghouls and\nwith Tenpenny tenants more closely. Both sides in the standoff have some kind of\nmoral justification on their side. The tenants, while they are \"human supremacists,\"\ncorrectly fear that the ghouls are fully prepared to use violence to accomplish their\ngoals. And the ghouls have every right to protest against the tenants' racist attitude.\nThe player is forced to weigh the tenants' and ghouls' respective moral claims in\norder to come to a decision.\nThere is, however, a fourth option where it seems that the player is not forced to\npick a side. The player can try to persuade Alister Tenpenny and five designated (and\nvery bigoted) tenants to permit the ghouls into to tower to live with them. If the\nplayer is successful, human and ghoul tenants can be seen roaming the corridors and\nrooms of the tower, in what appears to be peaceful coexistence. This option seems to\nbe the best one from a moral perspective. But when the player returns after a couple\nof in-game days, it transpires that Roy and his fellow ghouls have murdered all the\n\"smooth skins\" after all, leaving the player with very mixed emotions about his\nearlier choices. The morality system of the game amplifies this notion of moral\nambiguity by giving the player good karma for resolving the situation peacefully,\nbut neither good nor bad karma when the long-term consequences of your \"good\"\nactions become clear.\nThere is no definite or \"ideal\" solution to the Tenpenny Tower episode. And even\nthe one solution that seems to be ideal (negotiation) has heavy and unwanted con-\nsequences (the death of the tenants). As there is no ideal solution to this moral\nproblem, the player cannot abuse the game's saving/loading system in a practical\nsense. Of course, it is quite possible to experiment with all four outcomes, discover\nthe long-term consequences of option 4, load an old save file, and choose another\noption. But the discovery of the long-term consequences is merely accidental. There\nis no need to go back to Tenpenny Tower in a strict sense. The only other quest\nrequiring you to go to the tower are very probably already done in an earlier stage of\nthe game. And even then, while it may be technically possible to return to a previous\nsave game after finding out the murdering of the Tenpenny residences, it is probably\nhighly impractical for the majority of players who do not collect multiple saves but\nusually rely on fast save (overriding the previous one) and/or think it too heavy a\nburden to redo everything they have done in-game since their last visit to the tower.\nSummary and Further Research\nEthical gameplay can be an important asset in the development of video games. The\nimplementation of ethical gameplay can, however, take different forms and shapes,\n14 Games and Culture XX(X)\ndepending on choices that the developers make. Ethical gameplay can be imple-\nmented by the use of an (implicit or explicit) morality system, featuring either a\nmeter or a scale model. However, the implementation of such a system is no guar-\nantee for successful ethical gameplay, as critics have already observed and as I have\nshown in the different examples featured in this article.\nWhen ethical gameplay is included in a game, that is, when the gamer is stimulated\nto use narratological\u00adethical thinking instead of ludostrategic thinking, the quality of\nthe moral problems posed can be quite different. I have tried to differentiate between\nfour levels of ethical gameplay in video games based on the concept of wicked\nproblems--tame, semi-, real, and super wicked problems. This differentiation is based\non the extent to which the specific problem stimulates narratological\u00adethical game-\nplay, whether there is the possibility of solving the problem by exploiting the game's\nloading/saving mechanism, whether the consequences of a particular choice are irre-\nversible, and whether there is an \"ideal solution\" to the problem.\nWhile a system of differentiating how ethical gameplay is actually executed in\nvideo games--as I have proposed here--is a useful and necessary step in under-\nstanding how game designers handle moral issues in their products, there is need for\nmore research by both gamers and researchers. I believe that the most important field\nof research concerns the range of presupposed ethical frameworks that game\ndesigners use to base \"judgments\" of player actions and choices on.\nWhatever the nature of the ethical gameplay--tame, semi-, real or super\nwicked--the question of the foundation of these ethical frameworks still remains\nunanswered. It is possible to examine all wicked (and even tame) moral problems in\nvideo games from the perspective of consequentialist, deontological, and virtue\nethical theories. Which ethical framework have the designers used (game agency)?\nAnd which ethical framework are games using to cope with the moral problems\n(tame of wicked) presented by the game? Are the ethical frameworks of designers\nand gamers compatible or not?\nPerhaps the most appropriate way of thinking about morality and gameplay is a\nvirtue-based conception of morality, where the gamer slowly but surely develops his\nor her moral compass, or increasingly aligns his or her moral decisions to the\npresupposed ethical framework. As gamers, we learn something from the games\nwe are playing. The question is, however, what we learn through the agency of\nplaying them.\nThese questions merit further research in order to understand how ethical game-\nplay, morality systems, and wicked problems in video games \"educate\" the gamer to\nbehave in a certain way within the game, and/or stimulate him to evaluate his or her\nown in-game behavior in the light of his own ethical thinking, and/or triggers him to\ncritically evaluate the ethical framework which the developer has used.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nReferences\n2 K Boston & 2 K Australia.
