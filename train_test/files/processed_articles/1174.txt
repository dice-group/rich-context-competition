One important factor may be concurrent\nsexual partnerships (relationships that overlap in time), which\ncan transmit STIs more rapidly through a population than does\nsequential monogamy.\nMethods. To determine prevalence, distribution, and corre-\nlates of U.S. women's involvement in concurrent partnerships,\nwe analyzed sexual partnership data reported by the 10,847\nFamily Growth. Overlapping sexual partnership dates were\ndetermined by computer program and visual review of the data.\nResults.

Multiple logistic analysis substantially weak-\nened the relationship between concurrency and black race\nConclusions. Marital status in particular is strongly related to\nconcurrency; thus, lower marriage rates among blacks and the\nassociated higher concurrency of sexual partners may contrib-\nute to racial disparities in STI rates.\nKey words: concurrent partnerships, sexual networks, HIV, sexual behavior, African Americans, sexually transmitted infections.\nThroughout much of the United States, rates of\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs) are dra-\nmatically higher among blacks than whites. The reasons\nfor these marked racial disparities remain poorly defined.\nSexual networks and patterns of partner mixing play\na critical role in the spread of sexually transmitted in-\nfections (STIs) throughout a population.1\u00ad6\nOne pattern that can accelerate the transmission of\nSTIs is concurrent (overlapping) sexual partnerships.7\nCompared with sequential monogamy, concurrent rela-\ntionships permit more rapid spread of an STI through a\npopulation because an individual becoming infected by\none partner already has other partners to infect. In\naddition, an individual's partners who entered the con-\ncurrent partnership earlier are put at risk for infections\nfrom that individual's subsequent partners.8 This is in\ncontrast to serial monogamy. Mathematical models dem-\nonstrate that concurrent partnerships can dramatically\naccelerate spread of an STI among partner networks\nimmediately after the pathogen enters the population.9\nThus, a higher prevalence of concurrent partnerships\namong blacks could be a factor in their higher incidence\nof heterosexually acquired HIV. We hypothesize that\nthe prevalence of concurrency is higher among blacks\nthan among U.S. non-Hispanic whites due to blacks'\nmuch lower marriage prevalence. The lower marriage\nprevalence is likely a consequence of their adverse so-\ncioeconomic context and much lower sex ratio (ratio of\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from Cycle V of the 1995 National\nSurvey of Family Growth (NSFG) to determine the\nprevalence, distribution, and correlates of concurrent\npartnerships among women of childbearing age in the\nFrom 1Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, and 2Department of Epi-\ndemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill, Chapel Hill, NC.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to: Adaora A.

The NSFG is conducted periodically by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention to collect data on\nfactors affecting pregnancy and women's health in the\nUnited States.13 Data collection for Cycle V took place\nduring January through October 1995. Interviews were\nconducted by trained interviewers using computer as-\nsisted personal interview technology. To enhance recall\nability for dates, respondents constructed a calendar\nshowing the month, year, and respondent's age from\nbirth through the date of the interview of important life\nevents.\nSample\nThe sampling frame for the 1995 NSFG consisted of\nall 25,534 civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. women\nresponded to the 1993 National Health Interview Sur-\nvey (NHIS).14 The NSFG sample contained one woman\nfrom each of the 5,341 NHIS households with an ap-\nparently eligible Hispanic or black woman and one\nwoman from each of about 55% of the NHIS households\nwith eligible women who were neither Hispanic nor\ncases. Sample weights were computed to adjust for sub-\nsampling, nonlocation, and nonresponse, and further\nadjusted to match the Census estimates of the U.S.\npopulation by age, race, marital status, and parity.\nWeighted analyses yield estimates for the approximately\nDates of Sexual Partnerships\nThe NSFG interview asked each respondent the\nmonth in which she first had sexual intercourse with:\nher first partner, spouse, each man with whom she co-\nhabited, and any other sexual partners she had since\nJanuary 1991. Cohabitation was defined as living with a\nman with whom the respondent was having a sexual\nrelationship; \"sexual relationship\" in this and other con-\ntexts was defined as a relationship involving penile-\nvaginal intercourse. The month of last sexual intercourse\nwas also asked for non-marital partners who were not\nregarded as \"current.\"\nDefinition of Concurrent Partnerships\nWe defined concurrent partnerships as two or more\npartnerships that were \"current\" or where first sexual\nintercourse with one partner occurred before the month\nof last sexual intercourse with another partner. Partner-\nships that ended by January 1991, the start of the study\nperiod, were ignored. Because the NSFG contains lim-\nited information about the continuity of sexual relations\nbetween dates of first and last sex, we treated all part-\nnerships as continuous from the month of first sex to the\nmonth of last sex. For about 15% of the women classified\nas \"concurrent\" (and included in the analyses), their\nonly concurrent partnership(s) began before January\n1991; thus some of these women may have had no actual\noverlap in partners during the study period.\nClassification Procedure\nWe operationalized the above definition by using\ncomputer routines to classify partnership histories. To\nverify that the computer algorithms were performing\ncorrectly, we inspected the records for 100 women who\nhad been computer-coded as \"concurrent\" (99 classifi-\ncations were confirmed) and 50 women reporting more\nthan one partner since January 1991 but computer-\ncoded as \"not concurrent\" (49 classifications were con-\nfirmed). When the month of first sexual intercourse with\na partner was not provided, we substituted (where pos-\nsible) the earlier of the month the respondent and her\npartner began cohabiting or married. Similarly, when\nthe month of last intercourse was not available, we used\n(when available) the month of final separation, divorce,\nor death of the partner, whichever was earliest. If con-\ncurrency status could not be determined due to missing\npartnership dates, then the woman was dropped from\nconcurrency analyses.\nImputation and Visual Review\nThe problem with the above imputation procedure\nwas that in a significant number of cases information for\none kind of partnership (eg, spouse) appeared to have\nbeen incorrectly placed in a record location reserved for\nanother kind of partnership (eg, casual partner), creating\nthe appearance of two different, overlapping partner-\nships (one missing the month of first and last inter-\ncourse). Imputation in such a situation produces spurious\nconcurrency. Because 35% of records ultimately classi-\nfied as having a concurrent partnership required impu-\ntation, we visually reviewed all records where imputa-\ntion created an appearance of concurrency. We also\nreviewed all records in which two partnerships had iden-\ntical start months and end months, as these records\nmight simply contain the same partnership data entered\ntwice. In all, over 1,500 observations, including the\nmajority of those deemed \"concurrent,\" were classified\nfollowing visual review.\nAnalyses with Covariables\nWe examined the association of concurrent partner-\nships with the following variables: ethnicity, age at in-\nterview, education, marital status, lifetime number of\nsexual partners, number of partners since January 1991,\nage at first voluntary vaginal intercourse, work status,\nand receipt of Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC), as well as combined family income from all\nsources in the 12 months prior to the survey (as a\npercent of the 1994 poverty line), which we grouped\ninto four categories.15 Data on education and income\nican Indians were omitted from analyses that controlled\nfor ethnicity.\nWe used stratified analyses and multiple logistic re-\ngression models with concurrency as the dependent vari-\nable and ethnicity as the \"exposure\" of primary interest\nto assess residual associations, after inclusion of potential\nexplanatory variables of a priori interest that were asso-\nciated with concurrency. (Poverty, receipt of AFDC,\nand education were assessed as indicators of socioeco-\nnomic status. Age and marital status are associated with\nsexual partner number16; early age of sexual debut is\nassociated with sexual risk behavior later in life.17) Col-\nlinearity was not a problem because correlation coeffi-\ncients for all pairs of variables used in the same model\nwere below 0.50, and no principal component had a\nvariance proportion at or below 0.8 on more than one\nvariable.18 Neither the estimated coefficients nor the\nstandard errors were inflated, suggesting absence of nu-\nmerical problems.19 We examined models with various\nsubsets of explanatory variables in the complete data set\nand in a subset chosen for greater homogeneity (women\nage 22 and older, with age at first intercourse between 12\nand 24 years, and sexually active for at least 5 years).\nVariables with multiple levels (age, age at first inter-\ncourse, education, income) were analyzed as categorical\nvariables in some models and as continuous variables in\nothers.\nused for data management and descriptive analyses.\nSUDAAN (version 7.5.2, Research Triangle Institute)\nwas used for statistical analyses to account for the com-\nplex sampling design and weighting. Design effects for\nprevalence estimates were mostly below 1.5.\nResults\nDemographic Information\nDistributions of ethnicity and other demographic\ncharacteristics of women in the NSFG are shown in\nTable 1. Marked, though familiar, ethnic disparities in\npoverty are evident: blacks and Hispanics were most\nlikely to report annual incomes of less than 150% of the\npoverty line (41% and 40%, respectively) and to receive\nAFDC (23% and 15%, respectively); whites were least\nlikely to have incomes below 150% of the poverty line\n(16%) and to receive AFDC (4%).\nSexual Relationship History\nAfrican American women were much less likely to be\nmarried at the time of interview (25%) than were whites\n(54%), Hispanics (47%), or Asian Americans or Pacific\nTABLE 1.

The differences in percent-\nages across the ethnic groups were essentially unchanged\nby the classification of unmarried cohabiting women as\nmarried.\nMedian age at first sexual intercourse was 16 or 17\nyears. Black women tended to initiate intercourse earlier\nthan other groups (38% before age 16); Asian American\nand Pacific Islander women were older at first inter-\ncourse (19% before age 16) than white and Hispanic\nwomen.\nBlack women were more likely than white women to\nreport having had more than one sex partner (ever):\n(79% vs 68%), but only slightly more likely to have had\nmore than five (32% vs 30%). Hispanic and Asian\nAmerican/Pacific Islander women were much less likely\nto report having had more than one sex partner.\nConcurrency Prevalence\nApproximately 12% of women were classified as hav-\ning had concurrent partnerships since January 1991 (Ta-\nble 3). As expected, concurrency prevalence was\nstrongly associated with number of sexual partners.\nOverall, concurrency was much less likely to have oc-\ncurred among women who were currently married (4%)\nand most likely to occur among women who were for-\nmerly married (22%), had combined family income be-\nat least 11 lifetime sexual partners (41%). Among black\nwomen, educational attainment was inversely related to\ncrude concurrency prevalence, but in other ethnic\ngroups no association was apparent.\nMarked ethnic differences in concurrency were evi-\ndent. Concurrency prevalence was highest among black\nwomen (21%), lowest among Asian American and Pa-\ncific Islanders (6%) and Hispanics (8%), and interme-\ndiate among whites (11%). These ethnic patterns per-\nsisted in stratified analyses across all variables, except for\nwomen who had been formerly married, where concur-\nrency prevalence was the same (24%) among blacks and\nwhites. Even among women reporting the same number\nof partners since January 1991, concurrency prevalence\nfor black women was considerably higher than for the\nother ethnic groups. Concurrency was moderately re-\nlated to poverty among black and white women but not\namong the other racial/ethnic groups.\nMultiple Logistic Analysis\nThe crude association of concurrency prevalence\nwith younger age, earlier sexual debut, and being unmar-\nried remained in multiple logistic models, as did the\ninverse association with Hispanic ethnicity. Terms for\nAsian American ethnicity and black ethnicity were in-\ncluded in all models, although the regression coefficient\nAsian Americans was small and for blacks it diminished\nsubstantially with the inclusion of marital status and age\nat first intercourse.

Substantial ethnic\ndifferences were noted in the crude prevalence of con-\ncurrency, which was most common among black women\n(21%), lowest among Asians (6%) and Hispanics (8%),\nand intermediate among whites (11%). Concurrency\nprevalence was strongly related to age, age at first inter-\ncourse, marital status, and receipt of AFDC, and less\nstrongly associated with education, income, and work\nstatus. The multiple logistic models suggested that the\nrelationship with income, work status, and AFDC could\nbe explained by other variables. Age, age at first inter-\ncourse, and marital status remained strongly associated\nwith concurrency. Hispanic ethnicity was significantly\ninversely associated, and black ethnicity retained at\nmost a weak residual positive association.\nPrevious studies of concurrency have dealt with spe-\ncial populations, such as adolescents with STD exposure\nand college students. Among adolescents at a public\nSTD clinic in San Francisco who had at least one main\nsexual partner during the preceding 6 months, 31%\nreported a concurrent partnership during a main rela-\ntionship.22 Coital diaries of 82 adolescent females who\neither had or were exposed to an STD revealed concur-\nrent partnerships among 13% during a 21-month peri-\nod.29 A small survey of college students found similar\nlevels of concurrency among African American (47%)\nand white (50%) men but higher prevalences among\nSeveral studies based on national surveys have docu-\nmented reported numbers of sexual partnerships in the\npast year,31\u00ad35 but the extent of concurrency is unclear.\nAmong sexually active U.S. women studied in the 1988\nNSFG, approximately 3% reported at least two partners\nin the previous 3 months.36 In that sample, unmarried\nwomen of all age and ethnic groups were equally likely to\nreport having multiple partners.35 Given the brevity of\nthe time span, many of these partnerships are likely to\nhave overlapped, although concurrency was not specif-\nically examined. In contrast, the current study specifi-\ncally examines the prevalence of concurrent partner-\nships and their correlates.\nIn the United States, explanations for the marked\nethnic disparity in rates of HIV and other STIs have\nremained elusive. Causes are likely multifactorial and\ninclude differential access to healthcare, poverty, and\nprevalence of infection in the pool of sexual partners.\nBut a pattern of increased sexual risk behavior (eg,\npartner number, condom use, sexual practices) has not\nbeen clearly established for black women. Consistent\nwith the findings of previous investigations,17,35 our data\nshowed that similar proportions of black and white\nwomen reported more than five partners during the\npreceding 5 years.\nIn contrast, differences between blacks and whites\nhave recently been found in the nature of sexual net-\nworks; among blacks, more sexual mixing occurs be-\ntween those with fewer partners and those with many\npartners, a pattern that efficiently transmits STIs\nthroughout a population.37 Our study suggests that con-\ncurrent sexual partnerships may represent another net-\nwork pattern that contributes to the high rates of HIV\nand other STIs among blacks in the United States.\nBlack women's greater prevalence of concurrency is\nunlikely to be due to attitudes about sexual relationships,\nas some studies report similarity between blacks and\nwhites in such attitudes.38\u00ad40 More likely explanations,\nsuggested by our analyses, are younger age at sexual\ndebut and marital status. Nevertheless, the potential role\nof these factors as determinants of concurrency does not\ndiminish the likelihood that concurrency is a determi-\nnant of higher STD rates in blacks.\nEarly age of sexual debut predicts larger partner num-\nber later in life16,41 and has been associated with extra-\nmarital intercourse among men.42 However, the nature\nof the link between concurrency and age of first sexual\nintercourse is unclear.\nIn contrast, the pathway between marital status and\nconcurrency is more direct. Because marriage usually\nTABLE 4.

The low sex ratio (ratio of men to women)\namong blacks results largely from higher mortality rates\namong black males due to disease, violence, and the\ndisproportionate incarceration of black men.45 This\n\"male shortage\" depresses marriage rates overall and may\nalso raise divorce rates. Moreover, men's scarcity affords\nthem greater opportunity to maintain simultaneous re-\nlationships with different women.12 The effect of the low\nsex ratio is compounded by economic marginality, a\nfeature of life for many blacks that has a well-known\ndeleterious effect on marital stability.46,47\nA major strength of this study is its use of a large,\nhigh-quality, nationally representative data set with\noversampling of blacks and Hispanics. A significant lim-\nitation, however, is the lack of data on men. This lack\nprevented our investigating whether concurrency among\nmen may be responsible for the apparent anomaly of\nLatinos having lower concurrency prevalence than\nwhite women despite having higher STD rates.\nOur measure of concurrent sexual partnerships relies\non respondents' self report and their recalling months of\nfirst and last sexual intercourse with various partners\ngoing back nearly 5 years, a cognitively difficult recall\noperation,48 although the NSFG did employ several\ntechniques to improve accuracy of recall. Nevertheless,\nour ethnic comparisons would be seriously affected by\nrecall errors only if the errors were differentially distrib-\nuted by ethnicity.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study revealed ethnic differences\namong U.S. women of childbearing age in the reported\nprevalence of concurrent partnerships. Differences in\nmarital status and age at first sexual intercourse appeared\nto mediate the higher concurrency prevalence among\nAfrican Americans. Greater involvement in concurrent\npartnerships may play a role in the longstanding ethnic\ndisparities in rates of HIV and other STIs experienced by\nAfrican Americans. Further research should seek to un-\nderstand the phenomenon of concurrency in women and\nmen and the factors that promote this sexual pattern and\ndiscourage long-term monogamy. In particular it is im-\nportant to re-assess long-standing national policies re-\ngarding economics, employment, substance use, and law\nenforcement that help destabilize relationships in the\n"
