Much of the research into this phenomenon focuses on so-called neighborhood effects and has put particular\nemphasis on the negative effects of growing up in a poor neighborhood. Originating from the sociological study of inner-city\nproblems in the United States, the research has recently been embraced by Scandinavian social scientists, who have generally\nassessed the phenomenon with reference to social network effects and the lock-in effects of ethnic enclaves.We critique\nthe theoretical assumptions that we find in recent Scandinavian research and argue that a straightforward interpretation of\nneighborhood effects in terms of network effects is problematic.Our argument is based on an empirical analysis of friendship\ncircles of ninth graders in Stockholm (N = 240).We conclude that the friendship networks of ninth graders extend well\nbeyond the neighborhood, thus casting serious doubt on the network effects assumption of previous research. We also\nconclude that there is nothing in the reality of these ninth graders that confirms the established concept of the ethnic enclave.\n",

Social scientists are increas-\ningly interested in trying to establish residential segregation\nas a fact and investigating its short- and long-term conse-\nquences. One highly influential concept in this literature is\nthat of the neighborhood, and particularly that of neighbor-\nhood effects. Originally developed in the context of inner\ncities in the United States, it is increasingly being applied in\nScandinavian research as well. In an attempt to argue the\nunderlying mechanisms of neighborhood effects, various\nanalysts have proposed that people's everyday social inter-\naction is so intrinsically nested within neighborhood that the\nneighborhood effect can actually be interpreted as a social\ninteraction effect, or even as a social network effect. In this\narticle, we set out to scrutinize this assumption by studying\nthe friendships of ninth graders in three different schools by\nasking how their circles of close friends are constituted with\nrespect to sex, ethnicity, school class, and neighborhood.\nThe research question we ask in this study is as follows:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent is it theoreti-\ncally and empirically justified to use neighborhood\neffects as a proxy for social interaction effects or\neven social networks effects?\nThe objective is to contribute to a better specification of the\nunderlying mechanisms that bring about neighborhood\neffects. We do not doubt that neighborhood effects exist and\nthat they are important to study; it is reasonable to assume\nthat neighborhoods sometimes influence people's life chances\nsubstantially, and such effects have been observed empiri-\ncally. Yet, sociologists should strive to open up the black box\nof neighborhood effects to determine precisely what in neigh-\nborhoods is causing systematic differences in social out-\ncomes (such as schooling and labor-market situation). If they\nfail to do this, they will only produce explanations of rather\nlow explanatory value (see Boudon, 1998); that is, they can\nshow if neighborhoods have an effect on social outcomes, but\nnot why. If we want to go beyond prediction and also offer\nsound sociological explanations, this is certainly an unsatis-\nNeighborhood Effects and Social\nNetworks\nHorizontal residential segregation, that is, systematic clus-\ntering of people according to socioeconomic resources and/\n1Lund University, Sweden\n2Stockholm University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nChristofer Edling, Department of Sociology, Lund University, Box 114,\nEmail: christofer.edling@soc.lu.se\nNeighborhood and Friendship\nComposition in Adolescence\nChristofer Edling1 and Jens Rydgren2\n Keywords\nsocial interaction, friendship, adolescence, ethnicity, neighborhood\n2 SAGE Open\nor racial or ethnic characteristics, is a common feature of all\nindustrialized societies. People who grow up in circum-\nstances where most of their neighbors are poor are less\nlikely, for instance, to be successful in school and in their\nwork lives. This situation has led social scientists to ask\nwhether there are specific neighborhood characteristics--\ngoing beyond individual and family characteristics--that can\nexplain this phenomenon. The claim is that the social sur-\nroundings matter for people's life chances. This is a socio-\nlogically appealing claim that makes a lot of sense intuitively\nand has inspired considerable research on so-called neighbor-\nhood effects, focusing in particular on the inner-city prob-\nlems in the United States (Sampson, 2008; Sampson,\nAs is often the case in contemporary empirical social sci-\nences, ideas that drive research debates in the United States\nare imported and applied by European scholars. Consequently,\nwe see a growing tendency among European social scientists\nto adapt concepts such as neighborhood, ghetto, ethnic\nenclave, and the like, to contemporary European societies\nOurs, 2003). The fact of segregation poses a serious threat to\nthe egalitarian ideals of the Scandinavian welfare states.\nSweden is a case of particular importance given its history of\nfairly liberal immigration policies.Approximately 16% of the\nSwedish population is of foreign origin, and Sweden takes in\nthe highest number of refugees in Europe. This has led to pro-\nnounced residential segregation by ethnic background, espe-\ncially in the larger cities. Several studies of the Swedish case\nhave reported neighborhood and school effects for a variety\nof social outcomes--such as school grades, educational\nattainment, labor-market standing, and welfare dependency--\nalthough these effects are usually rather small when individ-\nual and family-specific characteristics have been accounted\nfor, and the effects are generally greater for schools than\nfor neighborhoods (see, for example, Aberg, Hedstr\u00f6m, &\nThe crucial issue is the precise mechanisms by which the\nsocial surrounding, and neighborhoods in particular, matter\nfor social outcomes. Without a clear understanding of the\nmechanisms that produce the effect, we will only produce\nsociological explanations of rather low explanatory value. A\nrelatively large number of mechanisms have been proposed,\nbut the most influential ones in the literature have been social\nties and interaction effects, norms and collective efficacy,\nand institutional resources (Sampson et al., 2002). In eco-\nnomic research, spatial mismatch may be considered a fourth\nmechanism (Edin et al., 2003). Many studies list all or most\nof these mechanisms as reasons for the demonstrated, or\nexpected, association between explanans and explanadum.\nHowever, very few studies actually try to identify these\nmechanisms empirically and the \"black box\" still remains\nlargely intact (Mayer & Jencks, 1989), and they remain\npurely theoretical constructs or assumptions about underly-\ning explanations of observed statistical regularities. Indeed,\na general criticism of this literature is the considerable gap\nbetween theory and analysis (Hedstr\u00f6m & Swedberg, 1998),\nand it is safe to say that we know very little about the social\nmechanisms of neighborhood effects.\nUnlike the U.S. literature on neighborhood effects,\nSwedish research has singled out network and interaction\neffects as the two principal mechanisms. Building on theo-\nemphasized factors such as information (e.g., about jobs,\neducation and future career planning, social allowances),\npeer pressure, and role models. In short, in neighborhoods\nwith scarce resources, people will have less valuable social\ncapital embedded in their social relations, pressures for con-\nformity will be \"downward\" rather than \"upward,\" and\nbecause of a lack of role models, people will have lower\naspirations. For example, in a recent study that looked spe-\ncifically at the role of ethnically segregated neighborhoods,\nour colleagues wrote that\nThe point of departure for the present empirical analy-\nsis is . . . that the social interaction between individuals\nof the same ethnic background, who live in the same\nneighbourhood, is relatively strong and that these rela-\ntions influence the school performance, educational\nchoices, and consequently the future educational career\nof children growing up there. Such network mecha-\nnisms may self-reinforce norms and behaviors and\nhave been found to influence, inter alia, the accumula-\ntion of human capital, the probability of being unem-\nployed, and the probability of becoming a recipient of\nThe very same idea, that one can isolate the crucial deter-\nminants of an individual's social network by locating at his\nor her neighborhood, is similarly expressed in a study of eth-\nnic enclaves where it is said that\nThe enclave represents a network that increases the\nopportunities for gainful trade in the labor market . . .\nFurther, the network disseminates valuable informa-\ntion on, e.g., job opportunities . . . The enclave would\nthus improve labor market outcomes, in particular for\nrecent immigrants and for individuals who have diffi-\nculty integrating into the labor market. Of course, the\nenclave may also provide information on matters that\nare not conducive to success in the labor market, such\nOther studies that draw on the same assumption can eas-\nily be added to these two (e.g., \u00c5slund & Fredriksson, 2005;\nEdling and Rydgren 3\nWe do not take issue with the claim that social networks\nmatter in the ways described above. What we do find poten-\ntially problematic, however, is the jump from geographical\nspace to social space, that is, the way in which neighborhood\nis used as a proxy for social network. The crux of the matter,\nalso expressed by Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m (2008), is that although stud-\nies of neighborhood and school effects in Sweden acknowl-\nedge \"that it is not self-evident that the observed associations\nare rooted in neighborhood/schoolmate interactions, the\nresults are often interpreted as if such social interactions\nhave brought about the empirical regularities\"2 (p. 465).\nAs indicated by the quotations above, research on\nneighborhood effects in Sweden has increasingly focused\non ethnic segregation. The reasons for this are twofold.\nFirst, ethnic segregation in Sweden is associated with\nsocioeconomic differences, so that the concentration of\nimmigrants is higher in neighborhoods that are poor in\nterms of social resources. Second, it is assumed that\nnetworks among coethnics are particularly dense, and\ntherefore it is believed that it is more justifiable to use\nneighborhoods as a proxy for social networks in these\ncases. For instance, Bygren and Szulkin (2007) stated that\ntheir \"analyses are based on the assumption that individuals\nwith the same ethnic background influence each other to a\ngreater degree than do individuals with different ethnic\nbackgrounds\" (p. 11). And they \"assume that a joint ethnic\nbackground raises the interaction probability and frequency\nbetween the individuals and that persons with the\nsame background represent `significant others' in a social\nThe theoretical underpinnings of these assumptions are\nthe general tendency toward social homophily--that is, a\npreference for social interactions with people who are simi-\nlar to oneself--and increased contact opportunities. It is\nwell established that people mainly tend to become friends\nwith people who are socially similar to themselves\n(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Yet despite this\nfact, there are several reasons to be critical of the assump-\ntions underlying research on \"ethnic enclaves\" and \"ethnic\nneighborhoods\" in a Swedish context. According to a com-\nmonly used definition (\u00c5slund & Fredriksson, 2005; Edin et\nneighborhood where the share of the ethnic group residing\nin the neighborhood is at least twice as large as the share of\nthe ethnic group in the population\" (\u00c5slund & Fredriksson,\n2005, p. 6). Swedish research on ethnic neighborhoods or\nethnic enclaves is highly influenced by studies on highly\nsegregated ethnic neighborhoods in the United States, such\nas Chinese in New York (Zhou, 1992), Cubans in Miami\n(Portes, 1987), or Koreans in Los Angeles (Light &\nBonacich, 1988). These neighborhoods are fairly well\ndelimitated geographically, and they have a number of char-\nacteristics that are usually missing in segregated areas in\nSweden. First, they are dominated by one ethnic group. This\nis very seldom the case in Sweden, where segregated areas\nare usually populated by immigrants coming from a large\nnumbers of countries. Hence, most segregated areas in\nSweden are ethnically very heterogeneous despite the fact\nthat relatively few native Swedes live there (see Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m,\n2008). According to the definition of ethnic neighborhoods\nprovided above, a neighborhood with 2% Iranians, for\nexample, would be called an Iranian neighborhood, if\nIranians' percentage of the population in Sweden is only\n1%. This is quite different from Chinatown in New York\nCity. Second, and related, is that in the American ethnic\nenclaves mentioned above, people can manage their lives\npretty well by using only the minority language. And a com-\nmon minority language goes a long way toward creating\nsocial relations. However, because ethnic neighborhoods in\nSweden are so heterogeneous, a common language (other\nthan Swedish) is usually lacking. Because of this, we find it\nproblematic to import sociological studies from the United\nStates to the Nordic countries, without first modifying the\nassumptions.\nA Critical Assessment of\nAssumptions in Previous Research\nIt is generally assumed in research on neighborhood effects\nthat neighborhood can serve as a proxy for social networks\nand consequently that we can draw conclusions about net-\nwork effects from the neighborhood indicator itself. We may\ncall this a jump from geographical space to social space. Is\nthis reasonable? First, as implied in some of the reviewed\nSwedish studies, there are theoretical reasons for making\nthese assumptions (Aberg et al., 2003). \"Foci of activity\"\nplay a significant role in the emergence of network ties.\nSuch foci are important as they bring people together in\nrecurrent interaction, thereby organizing their social rela-\ntions (Feld, 1981). Neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, and\ncivil society organizations (e.g., churches, sport clubs) are\nexamples of such foci. The more these foci overlap (e.g., if\nyour neighbors are also your schoolmates and football team-\nmates), the greater the chance that social interactions will\ndevelop into friendship relations. From a theoretical vantage\npoint, it is reasonable to assume that the extent to which foci\nof activity are locally bounded, and thus overlap more with\nneighborhood (and one another), varies with age, which\nmeans that children's circles of friends tend to be more con-\ncentrated in geographical space than are those of adults.\nHence, if a jump from social space to geographical space is\nreasonable at all, it should in particular be the case for chil-\ndren and adolescents who are still in school. This assump-\ntion is supported by a Swedish study that analyzed diaries of\nhad friends residing in their own neighborhoods. Yet the data\nclearly indicate that geographical proximity decreases in\nimportance the older the children become: For the youngest\nchildren (in fifth grade), 46% had no friends living outside\nof their neighborhood; for the older children (in the seventh\ngrade) the corresponding figure was only 30%.\n4 SAGE Open\nYet in general terms, to use neighborhood as a proxy for\nsocial interaction is a rather strong assumption. The assump-\ntion that people residing in Neighborhood A interact more\nwith one another than with people in Neighborhood B is\nintuitively very plausible. However, the assumption that they\ninteract more with one another than with people in\nNeighborhoods B to Z is considerably less plausible. As the\nnumber of people residing outside of one's neighborhood--\neven slightly outside--is so much larger than the number of\npeople residing within one's neighborhood, this assumption\nis not as self-evident as it is often presented to be. Statistically,\nthere are simply more people outside their neighborhood.\nAnd technologically, it is becoming increasingly easy, and\ncommon, to maintain close social interactions with people\nwho live far away.\nIn his discussion of the focused interaction of social life,\nFeld provided a similar account of why we should hesitate to\naccept even the theoretical idea that neighborhood can be an\napproximation of social networks. People who share a focus\nare likely to share activities as well, according to Feld (1981),\nHowever, all individuals who share a focus do not\nnecessarily interact with each other very much or very\noften. For foci where everyone is forced to interact\nmuch and often (e.g., families), all of the individuals\nassociated with that focus will be tied to each other;\nbut for foci that are less constraining on interaction\n(e.g., city neighborhoods), only a slightly higher pro-\nportion of individuals will be tied than would be tied\nin the general population. In general, the more con-\nstraining a focus, the greater is the likelihood that two\nindividuals associated with that focus will be tied. A\nfocus may involve very little constraint, but where\nthere is no constraint at all, there is no focus.. . . In\ngeneral, larger foci will be less constraining, because\nit is difficult to arrange for many people to have fre-\nquent joint activities. However, there may be small\nfoci that involve little constraint and large ones that\nFurthermore, there is a considerable risk of ecological fal-\nlacy in using neighborhoods as a proxy for social networks.\nThe size of this risk depends partly on how neighborhoods\nare operationalized. Small Area Market Statistics (SAMS)\nareas are used in the more sophisticated Swedish studies.\nSAMS, provided by Statistics Sweden, are designed to iden-\ntify relatively well-delineated socially and spatially homoge-\nneous neighborhoods, and they take account of factors such\nas housing type and tenure. The SAMS areas are relatively\n& Szulkin, 2007). Municipalities, that is, large entities with\na median of 16,000 inhabitants (\u00c5slund & Fredriksson,\nstudies of neighborhood effects. It is our strong contention\nthat only SAMS areas can be assumed to measure neighbor-\nhoods in any reasonable sense of the term.\nBelow we will present empirical data collected from ninth\ngraders in three Stockholm schools that clearly question the\ntenability of the jump from geographic space to social space\nthat is common in Swedish research on neighborhood effects\nand school effects.\nData\nWe conducted a survey, \"Your life and your future,\" from\nquestionnaire in 13 classes of ninth graders in 3 schools\nfrom distinctively different areas in the greater Stockholm\narea. We selected schools from a list of 15 schools that (a)\nhad a majority of their pupils living in the local area of the\nschool (which is the case for the overwhelming majority of\ncomprehensive schools in Sweden) and (b) were located in\none of three types of areas. These areas had to have either\npredominantly non-Swedish ethnic homogeneity, predomi-\nnantly Swedish ethnic homogeneity, or a heterogeneous\nethnic composition. Schools were contacted in no particular\norder, and the first school from each category that agreed to\nparticipate was selected. Schools included in the sample are\nlocated in the three areas Alby, Brandbergen, and Sofia.\nSome comparative statistics for these areas are provided in\nTable 1, and some key characteristics are further discussed\nbelow. Despite the fact that the sampling procedure was\nnonrandom, we are fairly confident that the schools we\nselected are representative, and that the results and conclu-\nsions can be generalized to the Stockholm area and beyond.\nAlby is part of Botkyrka municipality in south-west met-\nropolitan Stockholm. Alby has about 12,000 inhabitants and\nis a product of the early 1970s when modern Alby was built\nand most of the apartment blocks that still house most of its\ninhabitants were erected. About 77% of the population is of\nforeign origin, and in 2007, the unemployment rate was just\nbelow 5%. Alby has excellent infrastructure; it is close to the\nmajor highway and has a subway connection to the city.\nBrandbergen is part of Haninge municipality in south\nmetropolitan Stockholm. Brandbergen has about the same\npopulation as Alby and is also a product of the early 1970s\nwith large apartment blocks. Brandbergen was given a major\noverhaul in the early 1990s to come to grips with its social\nproblems. About 43% of the population of Brandbergen is of\nforeign origin, and about 3.4% were unemployed in late\n2007. Brandbergen is geographically a little more isolated\nthan Alby, with bus connections to the commuter rail net-\nwork. Both Alby and Brandbergen border extensive recre-\national areas and nature reserves.\nSofia is part of S\u00f6dermalm in central Stockholm and has\na little less than 8,000 inhabitants. About 14% of the popula-\ntion in Sofia is of foreign origin, and unemployment was\nBrandbergen are working-class areas whereas Sofia is an\naffluent middle-class area.3\nEdling and Rydgren 5\nThe questionnaires were filled out during class hours with\na research assistant present. A total of 241 pupils participated\nacross these 13 classes. As outside observers, we had no con-\ntrol over class absenteeism, and we did not offer any reward\nfor participating. Overall response rate across classrooms\nwas approximately 80%. Boys in Brandbergen and Alby\nwhere less willing to participate than girls, which means that\nboys are underrepresented in the sample. As it turned out,\napart from one example, internal nonresponse was not a\nproblem, with only one of the distributed questionnaires\nhanded in with most items blank.\nThe demographics of the samples in the three schools, dis-\nplayed in Table 2, mirror the skew distribution of people of\nforeign origin that we find in the three areas, with 33% of the\nstudents in Sofia being of foreign background compared with\n41% in Brandbergen, and 98% in Alby. Parents' country of\nbirth was used to code foreign origin as a binary variable.4\nBecause of the small sample size, we are not able to analyze\ndistinct countries or regions. However, the most common\nregions of origin among those with a non-Swedish background\nwere the Middle East, followed by South America and Latin\nAmerica, and the three most common countries were Turkey,\nChile, and Iraq. But it is important to keep in mind that we\nanalyzed the second generation and that the majority of the\nninth graders in our sample were born in Sweden, ranging\nfrom 87% in Alby to 97% in Sofia. We had more girls than\nboys in the sample in both Alby and Brandbergen. We could\nnot control class absenteeism at the data gathering sessions,\nand girls were simply more willing than boys to participate.\nResults\nThe key question that we asked was whether it is reasonable\nto use the concept of neighborhood as a proxy for social\ninteraction space. It remains an open question whether the\ntheoretical ideas encapsulated in concepts such as neighbor-\nhood, enclave, and ghetto translate at all to Scandinavian\nreality. However, there is one even greater problem and that\nis the assumption that neighborhood is also a reasonable\nproxy for social interaction. That is to say, that people tend\nto have their socially significant relationships embedded\nwithin a well-defined and fairly limited geographic space. In\nessence, this is a sort of mean field solution that reduces the\nmultidimensionality of social interaction to the bidimension-\nality of geographical space. If it works, it is an extremely\nefficient solution. But it is very bold and runs the risk of\nleading researchers to an ecological fallacy. Thus, the issue\nneeds to be further explored.\nThe individuals in our data were 15 or 16 years old and\nwere still in school. Theoretically, the likelihood that their\ncircles of friends were locally bounded should be higher than\nfor older persons out of school. Our empirical test of neigh-\nborhoods as a proxy for social networks was thus rather\nTable 1.

Demographics of Ninth Graders in Three Stockholm\nSchools (Frequency)\nSchool \n Sofia Brandbergen Alby \nSex\nBorn in Sweden\nForeign background\n6 SAGE Open\nconservative, as many of the studies we have cited deal with\nolder individuals.\nTo measure people's circle of friends, we asked our\nrespondents to think of, at most, five friends with whom they\nmost often spend time.5 We further asked the respondents to\nindicate for each friend his or her sex, age (similar age/\nyounger/older), ethnic background (Swedish/immigrant),\nfamily relation (family/nonfamily),6 whether or not they are\nin the same class, and whether or not they live in the same\nneighborhood.7 Thus, the critical indicator for the present\nanalysis is the number of friends who lived in the same\nneighborhood. But some of the other aspects of friendship\ncomposition will also be part of the analysis. It is potentially\nproblematic to use subjective measures for this research\nquestion,8 and we cannot know for sure how the respondents\nunderstood the term in the same neighborhood. However, in\nan earlier study by Andersson (2001), a sample of people\ndelimited almost SAMS-identical areas on maps when asked\nabout \"their neighborhoods,\" which indicates that the sub-\njective understanding of neighborhoods corresponds well\nwith some of the more objective classifications.\nAlmost every respondent (n = 225) produced information\non the maximum number of five friends and their character-\nistics. In the subsequent analyses of friendship composition,\nwe analyze only those who reported five friends. We calcu-\nlate for each respondent the number of friends of the same\nsex and the same ethnic background who were in the same\nclass and lived in the same neighborhood. The indicator on\nsame ethnic background is constructed from the distinction\nbetween Swedish and non-Swedish.9 The internal nonre-\nsponse for these particular indicators ranged from 7% (same\nclass) to 14% (same background). Each indicator has a\nstraightforward interpretation and takes on a value from 0 to\n5, where 5 indicates that all friends are of the same sex, for\nexample.\nWe use \"friendship\" and \"friendship circle\" interchange-\nably when describing the social interaction space of ninth\ngraders. We refrain from talking about networks because we\ndo not have information on network volume or density, nor\non the quality of friendship ties. However, we are confident\nthat the indicators tell us a great deal about the composition\nof the friendships that define the core of the social interac-\ntion space of teenagers.\nWe go directly to the heart of the matter and display, in\nFigure 1, the fraction of ninth graders who reported that a\nmajority of their friends live in the same neighborhood as\nthey do. The darker shaded piece of each pie indicates that a\nmajority of friends (i.e., 3) lived in the same neighborhood\nas the respondent. In Alby, 64% of the ninth graders had a\nmajority of their friends in their own neighborhood, which\nsuggests that social interaction is indeed geographically\nlocal. However, for Sofia, the corresponding figure is 44%,\nand in Brandbergen, only 35% of the ninth graders said that\na majority of their friends live in the same neighborhood.\nThis means that in two of the three schools that we surveyed,\na majority of teenagers had only a minority of their friends in\ntheir own neighborhood. This strongly suggests that the\nfriendship circles of ninth graders are not confined to their\nimmediate neighborhood.\nIt seems fair to conclude that without further qualifica-\ntions, neighborhood is not a reasonable proxy for social\ninteraction space. Overall, we find that a large fraction of the\nFigure 1. Percentage of ninth graders with a majority of friends in the neighborhood across three Stockholm schools\nEdling and Rydgren 7\nninth graders we surveyed had a considerable number of\nfriends living in another neighborhood than their own. And\neven among those ninth graders who had the most confined\nfriendship circles, at least 35% had two thirds of their friends\nin another neighborhood.\nWe note a substantial and statistically significant differ-\nence between schools with respect to whether ninth graders\nhave friendships within their own neighborhood. With\nrespect to our indicators, schoolchildren in Brandbergen\nseem to have more diverse friendship circles than schoolchil-\ndren in Alby, with Sofia somewhere in between but closer to\nBrandbergen. Let us further investigate this result by adding\ninformation on whether the ninth graders tended to have\nfriends of the same sex and of the same ethnic background\nwho were in the same school class.\nIn Figure 2, we display for each school the number of\nfriends, from 0 to 5, who share the respondent's characteris-\ntics. Moving clockwise from the upper left corner, we give\nnumber of friends of same sex, number of friends of same\nethnic background, number of friends living in the same\nneighborhood, and number of friends in same school class.\nWe note that with respect to sex, there is a strong tendency in\nall schools for same-sex friendship circles. It is indeed rare\n(about 7%) for a ninth grader of either sex to have a majority\nof opposite-sex friends.\nThere is a tendency across all three schools for a majority\nof the friends of a ninth grader to be of the same ethnic back-\nground (note that this is a crude indicator that only distin-\nguishes between Swedish and non-Swedish backgrounds).\nHowever, this tendency is especially pronounced among the\nninth graders in Alby, where as many as 70% said that all of\ntheir friends were of the same ethnic background as they,\ncompared with about 38% in the other two schools. For ninth\ngraders in Alby, sharing the same ethnic background means\nalmost without exception that both they and their friends are\nof non-Swedish origin. The ninth graders in Sofia seem to\nhave had the most diverse friendship circles with respect to\nethnic background. But despite the fact that 8% said that all\nof their friends were of another ethnic background, as many\nas 75% said that a majority (60%) of their friends were of\nthe same ethnic background as them. The comparative fig-\nures for Brandbergen are 1% and 80%, respectively.\nLet us now approach the key question of whether friend-\nship is spatially structured, but this time focusing on the\nschool. Admittedly, school is much more than a spatial qual-\nity, organizing as it does a significant part of most teenagers'\nFigure 2. Composition of friendship circles of ninth graders in three Stockholm schools\n8 SAGE Open\ndaily life. Nevertheless, schools are also spatially bound,\nattracting students primarily from the local neighborhoods.\nThis is why we are interested in the number of friends who\nare in the same class at school (lower left graph in Figure 2).\nAt first, there seems to be no clear tendency in these three\ndistributions. The number of friends in the same class is\nrather nicely distributed in all three schools around a mode\nof two to three friends. Thus, while most ninth graders have\na balanced mix in and out of class, some tend to have a\nmajority of their friends in their own class, whereas others\ntend to have only a minority of their friends in the same\nschool class.\nHowever, it is worth paying attention to the tail ends of\nthe distribution of number of friends in the same class. In the\nAlby school, 3% said that none of their friends were in\nthe same class, and 12% said that all of their friends were in\nthe same class. Compare this with the Sofia school, where\nnot a single teenager had all of his or her friends in same\nclass, and 16% said that none of their friends were in their\nclass.10 This is a striking difference, which indicates that\nfriendship among ninth graders in Alby was much more\ndetermined by the classroom than it was among schoolchil-\ndren in the other two schools. The lower right graph in Figure\n2 gives the distribution of friends living in the same neigh-\nborhood. We learned from Figure 1 that it is premature to\nassume neighborhood to be an indicator of social interaction\nspace. We provide this graph to allow for a direct comparison\nwith the other friendship composition statistics.\nThe evidence we have presented clearly suggests that\nAlby could be a strong case of the type of neighborhood that\nis intuitively suggested in the literature on neighborhood\neffects. The vast majority of ninth graders in Alby were of\nnon-Swedish background, they tended to make friends with\nothers who were non-Swedish, their friends also tended to be\nclassmates to a greater extent than in the other schools, and a\nmajority of their friends tended to be in the same neighbor-\nhood. Yet, we would strongly dispute that Alby is an ethnic\nenclave. Unfortunately, our crude binary measure of ethnic\nbackground does not allow us to address this question\ndirectly. However, we did ask the respondents which lan-\nguage they speak with their friends.\nAs shown in Table 3, the vast majority, 90%, spoke\nSwedish with their friends. Among the 125 persons of non-\nSwedish origin in the sample, only 16% said that they regu-\nlarly spoke a language other than Swedish with their friends.\nThe rest, 84%, said they spoke Swedish with their friends.\nAlby is no different in this respect. Despite the fact that 98%\nof our ninth graders in Alby were of foreign origin, more\nthan 80% said that they spoke Swedish with their friends,\nreflecting the fact that segregated areas in Stockholm (and in\nSweden and Scandinavia) are ethnically highly heteroge-\nneous and that for the young, the natural choice of language\nbecomes that of the \"new\" country.\nYet, we do see an \"Alby-effect\" on spatially bounded\nfriendship, and this effect is further established in Table 4,\nwhere we regress the number of friends in the neighborhood\non the respondent's sex, ethnic background, and school. We\nnote statistically significant effects of sex and Alby school\non the number of friends living in the same neighborhood.\nGirls had a tendency to have more friends who did not live in\nthe same neighborhood compared with boys. The \"Alby-\neffect\" is also substantial, with ninth graders in Alby tending\nto have more friends in the neighborhood than ninth graders\nin both Brandbergen and Sofia.11\nBased on Figure 2, we feel confident that friendship\namong Stockholm ninth graders in the early 2000s was\nhighly homogeneous with respect to sex and ethnicity, just as\none would expect. Without pursuing this at greater length, it\nis interesting to note that the ninth graders who said that a\nmajority of their friends were of another ethnic background\nwere themselves mainly of non-Swedish origin. This goes\nwithout saying in Alby, where almost everyone in our survey\nwas of non-Swedish background by our definition. But this\nwas true in the other two schools as well. Among the ninth\ngraders in Brandbergen who said that a majority of their\nfriends were of a different ethnic background, 11 out of 14\nwere of non-Swedish background. The same went for Sofia,\nwhere 17 out of 21 of the ninth graders with a majority of\nfriends from another ethnic background were themselves\n\"non-Swedes.\" This would be a worthwhile object of future\nstudy, as it suggests that the \"immigrant kids\" could play an\nimportant brokering role between Swedes and non-Swedes\nin Swedish society.\nTable 3.

And some studies aiming at repli-\ncating these results for Scandinavia have also established\nsmall but significant effects of neighborhood for various\noutcomes. Such effects have been interpreted in terms of\nnetwork effects, meaning that the driving force between these\ncorrelations is micro-level social interaction patterns. Of\ncourse, all empirical regularities should be stated in terms of\ntheir generating mechanisms (Hedstr\u00f6m, 2005), and this line\nof research is to be applauded for taking explanatory theory\nserious. However, the micro mechanisms have never been\nempirically established. And despite the fact that they rest on\nsome fairly strong assumptions about the structure of social\ninteraction, researchers have sometimes provided very lax\ntheoretical support. Because this is highly policy-relevant\nresearch, we argue that it is of the utmost importance to fur-\nther investigate the critical assumption that neighborhood\neffects can be interpreted in terms of network effects.\nResearchers focusing on Sweden have a unique opportu-\nnity to use register data to study a large variety of social out-\ncomes. These data are fantastic in many ways, in particular\nfor individual-level analysis, and they usually avoid many of\nthe problems associated with survey data (such as low\nresponse rates). Yet the availability of good data does not\nmean that it should be used for everything. We lack register\ndata for social relations, networks, and interaction patterns,\nand it is tempting for researchers to use shortcut strategies by\nusing neighborhoods, for which data are available from regis-\nters, as a proxy (e.g., Bygren & Szulkin, 2007).\nNo large-scale data are yet available for social interaction\nand individual attitudes at the individual level. However, we\nhave taken a first step in looking closer at one critical\nassumption about micro-level interaction. And we have\ndemonstrated that the reliance on ecological data is an erro-\nneous strategy. It is untenable to use neighborhoods as a\nproxy for networks. In our study of three schools, only Alby\nprovided some support for the notion that neighborhood cap-\ntures social interaction at least to some degree. The other two\ndid not. Hence, although there are strong theoretical reasons\nto assume that network and interaction effects are important\nfactors for understanding social outcomes--such as school\ngrades, educational attainment, labor-market standing, and\nwelfare dependency--the only way to study these effects is\nto collect network data. We also see it as potentially useful to\ncombine quantitative research with ethnographic studies\n(e.g., Lapeyronnie, 2008) to better understand important dif-\nferences between neighborhoods (e.g., between Alby and\nBrandbergen).\nHowever, that neighborhood is generally a poor proxy\nfor social networks and interactions does not diminish the\nfact that neighborhoods might be an important factor for\nexplaining various social outcomes in its own respect.\nInstitutional resources and spatial mismatch are two\npotentially important factors, and these mechanisms would\ncome more to the fore in studies of neighborhood effects if\nnetwork effects could be accounted for directly. We agree\nwith Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m (2004) that \"the black box of neighbor-\nhood effects still needs to be further investigated [if] we\nwant to achieve a better link between the theoretical and the\n"
