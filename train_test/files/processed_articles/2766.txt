By capitaliz-\ning on an original follow-up of more than 200 infants from the birth cohort of the\nProject on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods matched to their blood\nlead levels from around age 3 years, we provide several tests. Through the use of four\nwaves of longitudinal data that include measures of individual development, family\nbackground, and structural inequalities in how lead becomes embodied, we assess the\nhypothesized link between early childhood lead poisoning and both parent-reported\ndelinquent behavior and official arrest in late adolescence. We also test for mediating\ndevelopmental processes of impulsivity and anxiety or depression. The results from\nmultiple analytic strategies that make different assumptions reveal a plausibly causal\neffect of childhood lead exposure on adolescent delinquent behavior but no direct link\nto arrests. The results underscore lead exposure as a trigger for poisoned development\nin the early life course and call for greater integration of the environment into theories\nof individual differences in criminal behavior.\nExposure to dangerous levels of lead was extensive for long stretches of the twenti-\neth century (Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016; Troesken, 2006). Although environmental\nreforms such as the bans on lead in gasoline and paint in the 1970s were deemed victories\nfor public health at the time (Markowitz and Rosner, 2013; Needleman, 2004), lead toxi-\ncity is far from a hazard of the past. High levels of lead have recently been found in thou-\nsands of cities in the United States (Pell and Schneyer, 2016) and in both developed and\ndeveloping countries around the world (Tong, von Schirnding, and Prapamontol, 2000).\n Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online\nSupport for this article was provided in part by the Project on Race, Class and Cumulative Adver-\nsity at Harvard University funded by the Ford Foundation and the Hutchins Family Foundation, as\nwell as by the Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization.

Criminology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society of\nThe poisoning of the water in Flint, Michigan, in late 2015 and the evacuation in 2016 of\nan entire neighborhood contaminated by a smelting plant in East Chicago, Indiana, shone\nbright public lights on the contemporary perils of lead (Goodnough, 2016a, 2016b).\nThe legacy of lead, both historic and contemporary, carries important theoretical impli-\ncations for the study of crime over the life course. An association between lead exposure\nand cognitive impairment has been documented in medical research (Canfield et al., 2003;\nLanphear et al., 2000; Reuben et al., 2017), and many criminologists have long argued\nthat there is a connection between cognitive ability and delinquency (Farrington, 1998).\nSimilarly, there is evidence that lead aggravates hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, and\nmental health problems (Braun et al., 2006; Winter and Sampson, 2017), which have been\nshown to predict delinquency (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Moffitt, 1990). More\ndirectly, in a small body of research, an association has been found between lead exposure\nand later measures of delinquency and crime (e.g., Reyes, 2015; Wright et al., 2008).\nAlso important theoretically is that exposure to lead is unequally distributed, likely\nmore so today than in the past when lead was \"in the air\" and thus almost everywhere.\nContemporary lead exposure is linked, for example, to minority status and poverty at\nthe individual level, as well as to racial segregation and concentrated poverty at the\nneighborhood level primarily because of the unequal distribution of dilapidated hous-\ning that contains remnants of lead paint (Lanphear et al., 1998; Oyana and Margai, 2010;\nSampson and Winter, 2016). Similarly, the highest concentrations of lead in Flint were\nlocated in its most disadvantaged neighborhoods (Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016), and the\nevacuated neighborhood in East Chicago was both low income and predominantly Black\n(Goodnough, 2016b). Lead may thus be a mechanism that connects inequality to crime\nDespite the scientific consensus that lead exposure inflicts serious damage (National\nResearch Council, 1993) and the fact that lead is still a contemporary threat to society,\nespecially among the poor and in racially segregated areas, our knowledge of childhood\nlead exposure and the developmental course of crime is surprisingly sparse. As simply\nstated in a recent review of the literature, \"there is a dearth of criminological research on\nthis topic\" (Narag, Pizarro, and Gibbs, 2009: 954). In particular, the results of our review\nreveal that longitudinal data from representative samples with a long-term follow-up of\nindividuals are rare, as are studies in which lead exposure is integrated with mediating de-\nvelopmental processes or in which measures of alternative explanations, such as poverty,\nare included at both the individual and ecological levels. Conceptual integration of the\nage-graded mechanisms of lead's damage with criminological theory is also lacking.\nWe address these limitations in this article and argue that exposure to lead in infancy\ncan poison development and exert negative long-term consequences. We also integrate\nresearch on the contextual pathways of childhood lead exposure with life-course crimino-\nlogical theory, motivating a core set of hypotheses on the consequences of lead exposure.\nThe result of our theoretical integration supports an analytic strategy that allows us to\nassess the long-term link between childhood lead exposure and later delinquent behavior\namong adolescents and to estimate whether the link is plausibly causal in nature. Further-\nmore, we assess several explanatory mechanisms that are hypothesized to connect early\nexposure to later behavior.\nThe data supporting our analytic strategy come from an original follow-up of the birth\ncohort from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN).\nWe match four waves of longitudinal data from the PHDCN that include measures of\nindividual development, family background, and neighborhood context with childhood\nblood lead level (BLL) tests and the locations of smelting plants in Chicago, Illinois. By\ncapitalizing on this comprehensive linked data set, we estimate the effect of childhood\nlead poisoning on adolescent delinquency--both parent-reported and official criminal his-\ntories. Prior research is assessed in the next section, and then we build on it to formulate\na theoretical framework for testing the lead\u00adcrime hypothesis.\nThe criminological significance of lead is at once provocative and understudied. In a few\nlongitudinal cohort studies, scholars have assessed the relationship between lead exposure\nand delinquent behavior at the individual level, with uncertain results. For example, in\na lead smelting community in Australia, lifetime BLL above 15 \u00b5g/dL was associated\nwith increased aggressive behavior at ages 11 to 13 years relative to children with lower\nlevels of exposure (Burns et al., 1999). By contrast, Beckley et al.'s (2017) study based\non a 1972 birth cohort in Dunedin, New Zealand, revealed that lead exposure at age\n11 (average BLL of 11 \u00b5g/dL) had an imprecise or weak relationship with self-reported\noffending in adolescence (but see Farrington, 2017). It is uncertain how either of these\nfindings translates to the contemporary United States, where the population average BLL\nWithin the United States, Dietrich et al. (2001) found a positive relationship between\npre- and postnatal lead exposure and both self- and parent-reported delinquent behavior\nat ages 15 to 17 in a socioeconomically disadvantaged sample in Cincinnati, Ohio, with\nhigh levels of lead exposure. In a nationally representative sample, childhood lead expo-\nsure was associated with antisocial behavior from ages 4 to 12; childhood lead exposure\nalso predicted oppositional behavior and having hurt someone badly by age 17 (Reyes,\n2015). Although carefully executed, Reyes (2015) estimated individuals' lead exposure,\nand measured ecological confounding, such as poverty, at the state level rather than at\nthe more proximate levels, such as neighborhood, associated with exposure.\nThe results of several cross-sectional studies are nonetheless broadly consistent with\nthese longitudinal findings. Associations have been reported between lead exposure and\naggressive or antisocial behavior at ages 6 to 9 in Edinburgh, Scotland (Thomson et al.,\nconduct disorder among American children ages 8 to 15 (Braun et al., 2008); and rule-\nbreaking behavior at ages 14 to 18 in an impoverished area of Brazil (Olympio et al.,\n2010). In a meta-analysis of 19 studies, both longitudinal and cross-sectional, Marcus,\nFulton, and Clarke (2010) reported an association between lead exposure and conduct\ndisorder (including aggressive and externalizing behavior).\nWhereas the research described thus far has been focused on delinquent behavior re-\nported by subjects, parents, and/or teachers, a few scholars have considered the link be-\ntween lead exposure and involvement with the criminal justice system. Wright and col-\nleagues (2008) followed the aforementioned disadvantaged cohort in Cincinnati to ages\n19 to 24 and found that pre- and postnatal lead exposure were associated with total ar-\nrests and arrests for violent crime, whereas Denno (1990) found a positive relationship\nbetween lead exposure and arrests in a disadvantaged minority sample in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania. Fergusson, Boden, and Horwood (2008) studied a New Zealand cohort,\nshowing associations between lead exposure and both violent and property offenses,\nbut in another New Zealand cohort study, the authors found weak or no associations\nof lead exposure with later criminal arrests (Beckley et al., 2017). The results of two\ncase-control studies revealed a positive link between lead and official crime, with Pihl\nand Ervin (1990) finding higher lead levels in head-hair samples from incarcerated in-\ndividuals with violent criminal histories relative to nonviolent offenders and Needleman\net al. (2002) finding higher concentrations of bone lead in arrested and convicted youth in\nPennsylvania relative to nondelinquent controls. Finally, Reyes (2015) and Amato et al.\n(2013) found that childhood lead exposure was predictive of arrest and official school\nsuspension, respectively, whereas Aizer and Currie (2017) used an instrumental variables\nstrategy and data from Rhode Island to show that childhood lead exposure was associated\nwith later school disciplinary infractions and juvenile detention.\nCriminalization is not necessarily the same as delinquent behavior, however, as not\nall unlawful behavior brings about a response from the criminal justice system. Record-\nkeeping systems are uneven in the case of juvenile infractions, with many offenses handled\ninformally rather than processed as arrests. Another long-standing concern in criminol-\nogy is that, relative to Whites and those of higher socioeconomic status (SES), minorities\nand those who are poor may be disproportionately likely to be arrested, charged, and\nconvicted for the same criminal behavior (Travis, Western, and Redburn, 2014). Whether\ncriminal justice or survey measures are preferable is an old criminological debate; our\npoint is simply that until now researchers have not directly examined both kinds of data\nsimultaneously and have not tested whether lead exposure increases criminal justice sys-\ntem involvement, or criminalization, through the pathway of delinquent behavior.\nThe relationship between lead exposure and official crime has been examined at the\naggregate level as well by using full populations at various units of analysis beyond the in-\ndividual. Cross-nationally (Nevin, 2007) and nationally within the United States (Nevin,\n2000), reduced lead exposure as a result of increased regulation of leaded gasoline has\nbeen linked with lower violent crime rates approximately 20 years later in the 1990s. At\nthe state level, Reyes (2007) argued that declines in lead exposure during the 1970s and\nearly 1980s were associated with later declines in violent crime. At the county level, cross-\nsectional associations were found between air lead levels and homicide rates (Stretesky\nand Lynch, 2001) as well as between air lead levels and violent and property crime rates\n(Stretesky and Lynch, 2004), after accounting for socioeconomic and racial composition.\nAt smaller units of analysis, cities' use of lead water pipes in the late nineteenth century\nincreased homicide rates in the early twentieth century (Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016),\nand city-level air lead concentrations in the mid-to-late twentieth century were found to\npredict assault rates a little more than 20 years later in the United States (Mielke and\nZahran, 2012) and Australia (Taylor et al., 2016). Furthermore, children's rates of ele-\nvated BLL were found to predict increased violent, nonviolent, and total crime rates at\nthe census tract level in St. Louis, Missouri (Boutwell et al., 2016).\nIn light of findings across multiple contexts and units of analysis that decreasing lead\nexposure predicts decreasing crime rates around 20 years later when cohorts exposed to\nless lead in childhood are at peak ages of offending in early adulthood, several researchers\nhave interpreted aggregate-level results as evidence for a causal link between lead expo-\nsure and crime (e.g., Nevin, 2007; Reyes, 2007). Nevertheless, the association of airborne\nlead levels in the second half of the twentieth century with the crime drop starting in the\nmid-1990s in America and other countries does not assess the hypothesized underlying\nlink between individual exposure and crime. Moreover, the aggregate-level relationship\nhas been challenged by Lauritsen, Rezey, and Heimer (2016), who argued that the time-\nseries relationship between lead exposure and lagged official crime rates is not replicated\nby using national victimization data (see also McCall and Land, 2004). This finding again\npoints to the importance of examining both official and unofficial measures of crime in\nan assessment of the consequences of lead exposure, regardless of the level of analysis.\nThrough our review, we have identified important gaps that indicate the need for an\nassessment of the individual-level, developmental relationship between childhood lead\nexposure and later delinquent behavior. First, existing evidence on delinquency from con-\ntemporary representative samples with direct biological measures of childhood lead expo-\nsure followed prospectively into adolescence is rare. Second, with few exceptions (Aizer\nand Currie, 2017), researchers have not thoroughly accounted for selection bias in lead\nexposure, hindering causal estimates of its association with delinquency at the individual\nlevel. Third, researchers have not identified mediating developmental processes or distin-\nguished delinquent behavior from processes of criminalization. Finally, aggregate-level\nresearch on lead exposure and the 1990s crime drop is analytically distinct from our goal\nof testing the individual effects of lead exposure on crime.\nLead exposure is structural in origin, and its impact is age-graded in nature, which mo-\ntivated us to consider childhood lead exposure from the theoretical perspective of life-\ncourse criminology. Infants and young children are more likely to be exposed to lead\nthan are older children or adults through normal hand-to-mouth behaviors while play-\ning on the ground, leading to the ingestion of lead paint, contaminated dust, and dirt\n(Needleman, 2004). Lead's biological consequences are also age-graded in compounded\nways. Once exposed, young children absorb lead more efficiently than do older children\nor adults (Ziegler et al., 1978), and young children's rapidly developing brains are more\nvulnerable to lead's effects than are older individuals' more mature brains (Needleman,\n2004). Once in the body, lead mimics calcium, impairing brain development and neu-\nrotransmitter systems in ways that disrupt executive functioning and mood regulation,\nwhich in turn reduces impulse control and the inhibition of aggressive behaviors (Cecil\nWinter and Sampson, 2017). Through the same age-graded mechanisms, lead exposure is\nassociated with reduced cognitive ability (Lanphear et al., 2005; Reuben et al., 2017) and\nincreased attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Goodlad, Marcus, and Fulton, 2013),\nboth of which are predictors of delinquent behavior in the criminological literature\n(Farrington, 1998; Moffitt, 1993). The damage of lead poisoning is not considered re-\nversible, which is why pediatricians so strongly emphasize prevention (Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1991).\nAll of this leads to our theoretical conceptualization of childhood lead poisoning as\nan adverse transition in the early life course, one that is embodied and that exerts long-\nterm influence on adolescent development and delinquent behavior. In this sense, like\nvictimization by a violent event, individual lead exposure is akin to a turning point that\nalters development. But, unlike traditional turning points that emerge in adolescence\nor adulthood (e.g., military service, marriage, employment) and that change ongoing\ncriminal trajectories or promote desistance (Nguyen and Loughran, 2018; Sampson and\nLaub, 1993), in the present case, the triggering force of lead exposure is exerted in early\nchildhood.\nLead exposure offers distinct analytic advantage for our goal of identifying its effects\non crime relative to traditional criminological predictors. Compared with the internal or\nsubjective characteristics of the individual, such as attitudes or morality, or transitions\nin adulthood that have been criticized for being a function of individual choice, such as\njobs or marriage (e.g., Sampson and Laub, 1993), children, especially toddlers, do not\ncontrol or select their lead exposure. Rather, most contemporary lead exposure comes\nfrom lead-contaminated house dust generated by lead paint and remnants of lead in the\nsoil that are unwittingly tracked into homes and ingested at very young ages through\nnormal childhood behavior (CDC, 1991; Lanphear et al., 2002). As an external toxin,\nlead is thus more exogenous to the child than many of the mainstays of developmental or\nlife-course criminology.\nEven parents are often unaware of lead levels in their children's environments. Con-\nsider that health professionals only recently coalesced around an agreement that lead is\ndangerous at low levels. Additionally, lead-based paint has remained in millions of hous-\ning units despite being banned (Jacobs et al., 2002), sometimes stirred up by housing reno-\nvations (Rabinowitz, Leviton, and Bellinger, 1985) or hidden by landlords with fresh coats\nof paint and then exposed when newer paint layers peel (McCoy, 2017). Smelting plants\nare a major source of contemporary soil lead (Albalak et al., 2003; Landrigan et al., 1975;\nVargas et al., 2001), most of which were built decades ago and have been shuttered for\nsome time (Eckel, Rabinowitz, and Foster, 2001). Yet, as the residents of East Chicago,\nIndiana, experienced, the public and many environmental professionals were unaware\nof the lead exposure risks in the contaminated soil around these plants. This leads us to\nexploit historical data on smelting plant locations as an instrumental variable, providing\nfurther analytic leverage in our estimation of the link between lead exposure and later\ncrime.\nThe fact that lead exposure is an environmental toxin also has theoretical import for\nhow we conceive of individual differences in human development over the life course. It\nis common to trace individuals' propensities to engage in criminal behavior to particular\nqualities of individuals or their immediate family or situational environments. Individ-\nual differences in character (Heckman, Humphries, and Kautz, 2014), such as reflected\nin aggressive and impulsive behavior or low self-control (e.g., Farrington, 1998; Moffitt,\n1990), are not just properties of the individual, family, or situation, however. We argue\nthat the individual differences in character that predict delinquency are in part consti-\ntuted by the broader environmental context (Denno, 1992; Sampson, 2016) and, in this\ncase, by structurally and historically shaped lead exposure. This theoretical framework\ndoes not undermine individual or family differences; rather, it integrates these processes\ninto a model that contextualizes the course of character development.\nTo summarize, the first and main hypothesis we test is that there is a long-term link\nbetween exposure to lead in infancy and delinquent behavior in adolescence. Second,\nwe use multiple analytic strategies that make different underlying assumptions to assess\nwhether any significant relationships are plausibly causal in nature. Third, guided by the\nfindings from prior health research that reveal a pathway from lead exposure to later im-\npulsivity and impaired mental health (Braun et al., 2006; Winter and Sampson, 2017),\ncoupled with associations among impulsivity, mental health problems, and antisocial\nbehavior in the criminological literature (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Farrington,\n1998; Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990), we assess whether impulsive behavior and com-\npromised mental health (i.e., anxiety or depression) mediate any relationship between\nchildhood lead exposure and adolescent delinquency.1 Fourth, we test whether there is\nan additional association between childhood lead exposure and official arrests in adoles-\ncence. Because there is little theoretical reason to predict that lead exposure has a direct\neffect on the criminalization process, we expect any effects of lead on later arrest to be\nmediated by antisocial behavior. To investigate these hypotheses, we draw on a long-term\nfollow-up of a birth cohort in Chicago linked with their childhood BLLs from the Chicago\nDepartment of Public Health as well as with their official arrest records from the Illinois\nCriminal Justice Information Authority.\nWe report here on an 18-year follow-up of the birth cohort from the PHDCN (N =\n1,255 at baseline). The PHDCN was originally designed as a longitudinal multicohort\nstudy of children and their caregivers drawn from a representative sample of households\n93). (Additional details on the PHDCN's multistage design and sample are in appendix\nA of the online supporting information.2) Extensive interviews and assessments were\nconducted with the primary caregivers of the birth cohort members three times over a\nter where they moved in the United States. Participation at baseline and retention at wave\n3 were relatively high for a contemporary urban sample, 78 percent and 75 percent, re-\nspectively.\nwave 3 was selected as part of a larger study, hereafter defined as \"wave 4\" of the PHDCN.\nBy wave 4, birth cohort members were between 16 and 18 years old. As in earlier waves,\nan interview was carried out with the caretaker of the birth cohort member that included\ninformation on the household and a battery of items tapping the behavior and circum-\nstances of the target child. Despite the long time that elapsed since last contact at wave 3\n(more than a decade) and the contemporary urban setting, 67 percent of eligible cases of\nthe randomly sampled birth cohort were located (N = 378). We employed survey weights\nthat accounted for the PHDCN's multilevel survey design as well as for subsequent attri-\ntion to allow for population estimates (appendix A in the online supporting information).\nIn addition, the 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) we report here accounted for the\nmultilevel sampling design of the PHDCN.\n1. Winter and Sampson (2017) used the PHDCN birth cohort data to examine the relationship be-\ntween childhood lead exposure and adolescent obesity, anxiety or depression, and impulsivity. By\ncontrast, the purpose of the present study is to address criminological theory and assess whether\nlead exposure is a cause of delinquency. We also build on this prior work by testing the mediating\nrole of impulsivity and anxiety in explaining the lead\u00adcrime association.\n2. Additional supporting information can be found in the listing for this article in the Wiley Online\nThe BLLs of children in Chicago are tested following the Chicago Department of Pub-\nlic Health's (CDPH's) recommended schedule of four tests by 36 months of age, with\nadditional testing until 6 years of age if test results are high or if children move to a\nnew address. As described elsewhere, most tests are conducted using venous blood sam-\nples, and the remainder using capillary blood samples. Working with CDPH, we matched\nidentifiable CDPH blood test results between 1995 and 2013 with birth cohort members\npresent at wave 4.3 The CDPH conducts approximately 77,500 lead tests per year, with\nan average of 33 (standard deviation [SD] = 32) lead tests per block group per year. Of\nthe 378 eligible birth cohort members, 254 were successfully matched with blood lead test\nresults. These matched records comprised our analytic sample.\nWe accounted for selection into our analytic sample by adjusting all analyses for\nCDPH's lead testing coverage rate in each child's neighborhood. We calculated coverage\ntotal number of children ages 1 to 3 years residing in each block group in each year (esti-\nboundaries, and then linearly interpolated).4 When calculating these coverage rates, we\nfirst subtracted the number of children in wave 4 of the PHDCN with a blood lead test in\nyear, so that the lead testing coverage rates we employed were not endogenous with our\nindividual-level measure of lead exposure. We averaged and then centered the coverage\nTo minimize the impact of potential measurement error among blood lead test results\non our analysis, we used children's average BLL (measured in \u00b5g/dL) across test results\nas our measure of exposure. Because lead is most harmful when ingested at the earliest\nstages of development, we excluded blood lead tests conducted at 6 years of age or older\nbefore calculating each child's average BLL. As CDPH's testing recommendations are\nnot always strictly followed, children in our sample had an average of 2.6 (SD = 1.9)\nblood lead tests before the age of 6. The average ages at first and last blood tests are quite\nthe ideal window for capturing lead exposure (Lanphear et al., 2002).\nLead's harmful effects have been detected at very low levels (Lanphear et al., 2005),\nand the CDC (1991) maintains that there is no safe level of exposure, instead recom-\nmending BLL  5 \u00b5g/dL as the \"reference level\" at which children should be monitored.\nTherefore, instead of dichotomizing our continuous measure of children's average BLL\n3. Exact as well as \"fuzzy\" matching on first name, last name, and date of birth was carried out on\nchildren whose caregivers had given consent to checks of health records (greater than 92 percent)\nat baseline. All resulting matches were manually reviewed. Consistent with the CDPH's focus on\nchildren at higher risk of lead exposure, children with matching test results are more likely to be\nBlack or Hispanic and from lower SES backgrounds, relative to all wave 4 birth cohort members.\nAs noted later, we controlled for race and SES background in our analyses.\n4. Most blood lead tests were conducted within this age range. Nevertheless, our results are robust\nto using the total number of children ages 1 to 4 or the total number of children ages 1 to 5 as the\ndenominator in the calculation of this measure. We estimate CDPH's average block group-level\ntesting coverage to be between 30 percent and 50 percent.\nat a threshold of \"safe\" exposure, as done in many previous studies, we maintained chil-\ndren's average BLL as a continuous variable in our analyses. Descriptive statistics are\nprovided in table 1. The mean average BLL in our sample was 6.20 \u00b5g/dL (SD = 4.58),\nwhich was higher than the CDC's monitoring threshold.5\nOur primary measure of delinquent behavior was derived from wave 4 of the PHDCN,\nwhen the children in our sample were between 16 and 18 years old--about 15 years, on\naverage, after measured lead exposure. We used the antisocial behavior scale from the\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely used, reliable, and valid reporting measure\nfor identifying emotional and behavioral problems linked to delinquency (Achenbach,\n1997). The sampled adolescents' primary caregivers were asked whether, within the past\n6 months, each of the following items were true of the adolescent: destroys things belong-\ning to his/her family or others; displays cruelty, bullying, or meanness to others; disobe-\ndient at school; doesn't seem to feel guilty after misbehaving; and lies or cheats. For each\nitem, caregivers responded often (2), sometimes (1), or not (0) true. Their answers were\nthen summed and standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1).\nAs a validity check and to assess the developmental process of antisocial behavior, we\nalso employed an average measure of subjects' antisocial behavior from waves 2 and 3,\nwhen the individuals in our sample were much younger--around ages 3 and 5, respec-\ntively. The same procedure was used to construct the antisocial behavior scale for each\nwave, and the average of the two standardized scores was then calculated, weighted by\nthe number of items included in each wave's scale. The items that comprise each wave's\nscale are in appendix B (in the online supporting information). They are similar to those\nlisted earlier but account for subjects' younger ages at earlier waves. Because the chil-\ndren were very young at waves 2 and 3, this outcome measure presents a strict test of the\nhypothesized relationship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior.\nWe collected official arrest histories to examine the relationship between childhood\nlead exposure and contact with the criminal justice system. Under a joint agreement with\nthe Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA), all PHDCN wave 4 respon-\ndents were matched by first and last names (including aliases) and date of birth with crim-\ninal history record information (CHRI) reported to the state of Illinois and housed by the\nIllinois State Police. Respondents were matched with all CHRI records through February\n2017, when the birth cohort members were, on average, slightly older than 21 years old.\nThe CHRI records cover the city of Chicago (from the Chicago Police Department) as\nwell as all jurisdictions outside the city (approximately 1,200) and include detailed infor-\nmation by date on arrests, charges, and sentences. Because the CHRI database reaches\n5. In waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN, children's primary caregivers were asked whether their children\nhad ever had lead poisoning. Although this survey-reported measure is crude, the mean average\nBLL of children for whom caregivers responded yes at either wave is 12.6 \u00b5g/dL, more than double\nthe magnitude of the average BLL of children for whom caregivers responded no at both waves\n(5.0 \u00b5g/dL). This substantial and significant difference provides an independent validity check on\nour blood-level measure of lead exposure.\nTable 1.

Hence, there was no censoring of the criminal histories.6\nTo test our hypothesis that the relationship between lead exposure and antisocial be-\nhavior is mediated by individuals' impulsive behavior and mental health, we employed\naverage measures of subjects' impulsivity and anxiety or depression at waves 2 and 3 as\nwell as comparable measures at wave 4. These measures are derived from the CBCL\nand were constructed using the same process described earlier; they were also vali-\ndated and examined as outcomes of lead exposure, along with obesity, in Winter and\nSampson (2017). The items that comprise the impulsivity and anxiety or depression scales\nat each wave are listed in appendix B in the online supporting information, and descrip-\ntive statistics are provided in table 1.\nCONTROLS\nOur sample was modest in size, so we focused on background characteristics either hy-\npothesized or known to be related to childhood lead exposure and adolescent delinquent\nbehavior (Lanphear and Roghmann, 1997; Sampson and Laub, 1993): sex; race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other); the primary caregiver's\nimmigrant generational status (first generation, second generation, third generation or\ngreater); the primary caregiver's marital status (married, single, cohabiting); the primary\ncaregiver's education level (<high school, high school/GED, >high school, bachelor's\ndegree); and poverty, indicated by whether the primary caregiver received Temporary As-\nsistance for Needy Families (TANF).7 These controls were all \"pre-treatment\" or prior\nto childhood lead exposure and derived from the first wave of the PHDCN, which was\nconducted soon after the children in our sample were born (mean age 0.64 years, SD =\n0.32). We also controlled for the children's age at which our developmental outcomes\nwere measured--age at wave 4 or average age at waves 2 and 3, as appropriate--since\ndevelopment closely relates to age. Descriptive statistics are provided in table 1.\nPrior research results have demonstrated variations in lead poisoning by neighborhood\nracial composition and poverty (Oyana and Margai, 2010; Sampson and Winter, 2016).\nTo control for these potential confounders, we retrieved data from the 1990 U.S. Census\n(standardized to 2000 block group boundaries) to calculate the proportion of individuals\nin each child's block group who are non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic, as well as the pro-\nportion of individuals below the poverty line (table 1). Like the individual-level covari-\nates, these ecological measures precede lead exposure; they also advance prior research\n6. A probabilistic matching algorithm was used to obtain record linkages between our cohort mem-\nbers and CHRI records (Devitt and Hughes, 2016). More than 80 percent of the matches yielded\na probability of 100 percent accuracy; more than 90 percent had a probability of 99 percent accu-\nracy or higher. The remaining 10 percent of accepted cases were individually checked and deter-\nmined to constitute a match. Although the ICJIA data are limited to Illinois records, approximately\n90 percent of our sample remained in Illinois at wave 4.\n7. Our results are robust to the inclusion of household income and home ownership as measures of\nSES, but we employed TANF receipt in our final models because it is a more direct measure of\nhousehold deprivation and includes more complete data than on income.\nFigure 1.

Our primary sample for wave 4 consisted of 212 individuals. Antisocial behavior\nin this sample was very similar (mean 0.18, SD = 1.22 when standardized across the full\nbirth cohort) to the full wave 4 birth cohort (mean 0.12, SD = 1.15), as was the number\nA formal t test of these mean differences revealed no significant differences. Analyses\ncomprising measures from waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN included 158 of these 212 in-\ndividuals who were present at all waves.8 The wave 2/3 subsample was very similar to\nthe primary sample in terms of demographic and socioeconomic composition at both the\nindividual and neighborhood levels. Although our main focus was on the magnitude of\npoint estimates and their 95 percent confidence intervals, we used both .05 and .10 sig-\nnificance levels to reflect the smaller sample size on which the significance statistics were\ncalculated.\nFigure 1 reveals a clear gradient relating childhood lead exposure to parent-reported\nantisocial behavior in adolescence. Children with higher levels of lead exposure around\nage 3 exhibited more antisocial behavior, on average, around age 17 than did those with\nlower levels of childhood exposure, with a difference of more than 1 standard deviation\n8. Participation in wave 2 of the PHDCN was not a prerequisite for eligibility at wave 4. Thirteen chil-\ndren were not present at wave 2, and the remaining were not included because they were missing\nparent-reported items from the CBCL scales for waves 2 or 3.\nbetween children with high (BLL > 10 \u00b5g/dL) and low (BLL  5 \u00b5g/dL) levels of ex-\nposure. One standard deviation in the wave 4 antisocial behavior scale is the equivalent\nof 2.1 points on the raw scale, or a little more than the difference between a parent re-\nporting \"not true\" and \"often true\" on one of the five CBCL items. Considering anti-\nsocial behavior earlier in childhood, around ages 3 to 5 (waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN),\nyielded a similar although weaker pattern. Although young children with low and medium\n(BLL 5\u00ad10 \u00b5g/dL) levels of lead exposure exhibited similar levels of antisocial behav-\nior, children with high exposure showed much higher levels of parent-reported antisocial\nbehavior.\nWe then assessed this relationship using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression with\nour subjects' standardized antisocial behavior scores as the outcome, their average BLL\nas the independent variable of theoretical interest, and the set of control variables de-\nscribed earlier. Table 2 demonstrates a significant relationship between childhood lead\nexposure and antisocial behavior in both childhood and adolescence after our individual-\nand neighborhood-level controls are adjusted. A 1-\u00b5g/dL increase in average BLL is asso-\nciated with a .07 standard deviation increase in antisocial behavior around age 4 and with\na .09 standard deviation increase around age 17. The latter is equivalent to a .92 point in-\ncrease in the raw antisocial behavior scale, which ranges from 0 to 10. To understand the\nmagnitude of this relationship better, we calculated predicted antisocial behavior scores\nin adolescence for individuals with mean values of all continuous covariates, mode values\nof all categorical covariates, and low (4 \u00b5g/dL), medium (7 \u00b5g/dL), and high (10 \u00b5g/dL)\nchildhood lead exposure. This calculation yielded predicted standardized antisocial be-\nraw antisocial behavior scale. The consistency of the relationship between lead exposure\nand antisocial behavior over time is indicative of the durable effects of lead exposure\nover the early life course. It is notable that no control variable that we included exhibited\na similarly durable association with antisocial behavior.\nDespite the theoretically and empirically motivated set of covariates in table 2, it is\npossible that the relationship we observed was biased by omitted factors that influenced\nboth lead exposure and antisocial behavior. To address this possibility, we selectively\ncontrolled for three additional sets of pretreatment (wave 1) covariates that prior find-\nings outside of conventional lead research suggest may be confounders but that we did\nnot include in our primary models given our limited sample size and, therefore, statis-\ntical power. First, results reported in the criminology literature demonstrate that two\nhousehold-level measures--household size and whether the primary caregiver was ex-\nposed to or involved in domestic violence--may reflect the amount or quality of care\nthat children receive and, in turn, influence children's exposure to lead as well as their\nantisocial behavior (Farrington et al., 2001; Sampson and Laub, 1993). Second, neigh-\nborhood collective efficacy and violence tap neighborhood processes that may influence\nchildren's exposure to environmental toxins and antisocial behavior (Sampson, 2012;\nSharkey, 2013). Third, we controlled for ecological measures from the Systematic Social\nObservation component of the PHDCN (Sampson, 2012: 88\u00ad90) that tap environmental\ndecay (e.g., vacant houses; burned out, boarded up, or abandoned commercial buildings;\nbadly deteriorated residential units or recreational facilities) and other signs of physical\ndisorder as well as neighborhood housing vacancy taken from the 1990 U.S. Census (see\nalso Sampson and Winter, 2016: 266\u00ad7). As shown in appendix C (in the online supporting\nTable 2.

Consistent\nwith our recent work in which we examined the impact of childhood lead exposure on\nadolescent health (Winter and Sampson, 2017), we employed coarsened exact matching\n(CEM) to improve balance and ensure overlap in the joint distribution of our covariates--\nincluding interactions--among children with high and low levels of lead exposure. CEM\nis a nonparametric matching strategy that is robust to measurement error and that strictly\nbounds the degree of model dependence (Iacus, King, and Porro, 2012). CEM uses an au-\ntomatic binning algorithm to coarsen values of specified covariates and then exact match\nobservations based on these coarsened values. Observations in both the treatment and\ncontrol groups without an exact match are dropped (Blackwell et al., 2009) to ensure that\nsubsequent analyses do not extrapolate beyond the data, which would lead to increased\nmodel dependence (Iacus, King, and Porro, 2012).\nBased on CDC guidelines, we define the treatment group as those with an aver-\nage BLL  6 \u00b5g/dL to implement CEM and match our observations on a core set\nof individual- and neighborhood-level indicators. Our selection of indicators balances\nour need for a matched sample that is large enough for generating estimates with our\ngoal of achieving balance among covariates and their interactions. We matched on chil-\ndren's gender and race/ethnicity and the primary caregivers' immigrant generational sta-\ntus, marital status, education level, and TANF receipt. At the neighborhood level, we\nincluded meaningful dichotomous indicators of children's environments--whether chil-\ndren's neighborhoods at wave 1 were predominantly (70 percent) Black and whether\ntheir neighborhoods at wave 1 were characterized by high poverty rates (30 percent\nbelow the poverty line). For our primary sample of 212 children and our waves 2/3 sub-\nsample of 158 children, this specification resulted in 82 and 63 matched observations\nwith all covariates available, respectively, 34 and 26 of which had an average BLL \nstatistic is a multivariate measure of overall imbalance among covariates that\nranges from 0 to 1, with larger values indicating greater imbalance between the treatment\nwas calculated based on the\nmeasures we employed in our match, implementing CEM reduced the imbalance in our\nsample from .71 to nearly 0. Panel A of table 3 presents means for our control variables\nseparated by treatment (BLL  6 \u00b5g/dL) and control (BLL < 6 \u00b5g/dL) group as well as\nthe mean differences on each covariate before and after implementing CEM. Although\nthe goal of CEM is to reduce imbalance on the multivariate distribution of covariates, it is\napparent from table 3, panel A, that implementing CEM also reduces bias and improves\nbalance for most of our control variables individually, especially for race, immigrant sta-\ntus, marital status, and neighborhood poverty. Even though the balance is not perfect\nwhen control variables are considered individually, there are no significant mean differ-\nences in covariates between control and treatment groups following CEM.\nTable 3.

After CEM, OLS models (panel B) control for child's age\nat wave 4 or average age at waves 2 and 3, gender, and race/ethnicity; primary caregiver's immigrant generational status, marital status, education level, and TANF\nreceipt; and the proportion of the child's residential neighborhood that is non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, below the poverty line, and tested for lead exposure.\nABBREVIATIONS: BLL = blood lead level; GED = General Equivalency Diploma; OLS = ordinary least squares; TANF = Temporary Assistance for Needy\nFamilies.\naTreatment group is comprised of those with average BLL  6 \u00b5g/dL.\nbt test for difference in means significant at p < .05.\nWe estimated the same OLS models described earlier on our matched samples. Specif-\nically, our subjects' standardized antisocial behavior scores was the outcome, their av-\nerage BLL was the independent variable of theoretical interest, and we controlled for\nthe variables shown in table 3, panel A, to address any residual confounding that re-\nmains after CEM. In these models, weights produced by the CEM algorithm were also\nused that account for the differential sizes of the matched groups of observations. The\nresults of these models, presented in table 3, panel B, constitute estimates of the rela-\ntionship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior, conditional on covariates, for\nthe matched subsamples of our data for which there is common multivariate support.\nThe results are very similar to those obtained following OLS among our full sample.\nEstimating OLS models on our matched sample, we found that a 1-\u00b5g/dL increase in\naverage BLL is associated with a .10 standard deviation increase in antisocial behav-\nior around age 4 and with a .11 standard deviation increase around age 17 (table 3,\npanel B).\nIn brief, the results in tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that our findings for adolescent delin-\nquent behavior are consistent across alternative and very different sample specifications.\nNot only are the estimated relationships between childhood lead exposure and antiso-\ncial behavior among the smaller CEM sample statistically significant and in the same di-\nrections as the relationships estimated among the full sample, but also their magnitudes\nare quite similar. This is true whether antisocial behavior is considered around age 4 or\naround age 17, and when additional control variables at the household and neighborhood\nlevels are added to the full sample models as robustness checks.9\nOur final strategy accounted for potential omitted variable bias by using an instrumen-\ntal variable (IV) strategy to isolate a portion of co-variation between lead exposure and\nantisocial behavior that is not a result of unobserved factors that are simultaneously influ-\nencing both (Muller, Winship, and Morgan, 2014; Murnane and Willett, 2010). To isolate\nthis \"pure\" portion of the co-variation, the IV is assumed (a) to be exogenous conditional\non covariates, (b) to relate to childhood lead exposure (relevance), and (c) to not directly\nrelate to antisocial behavior (exclusion restriction). If these conditions are satisfied, we\ncan isolate the variation in childhood lead exposure that is a result of the IV in a first-stage\nregression, and then we can examine the relationship between this exogenous variation\nin lead exposure and antisocial behavior in a second-stage regression. Limited informa-\ntion maximum likelihood (LIML) estimation is often recommended for IV models over a\ntwo-stage, least-squares regression in the presence of small samples and potentially weak\nemployed LIML IV, but the results following two-stage, least-squares regression were\nnearly identical.\n9. The results following CEM are also robust to alternative specifications of our matching algorithm\nthat are both more and less parsimonious. For example, the results in table 3 are very similar when\nincluding indicators of, among other variables, whether children's neighborhoods at wave 1 were\npredominantly (70 percent) Hispanic and whether the primary caregiver was exposed to domestic\nviolence at wave 1 in the CEM algorithm.\nTheory and research introduced earlier on the risk of lead exposure from soil contami-\nnated by smelting plants informed our selection of an appropriate IV (Albalak et al., 2003;\nLandrigan et al., 1975; Vargas et al., 2001). Many smelting plants never underwent proper\nenvironmental remediation, and even if plants were closed, lead in the surrounding soil\ndecays at a very slow rate. These facts and prior research findings support our hypothesis\nthat proximity to historic or contemporary smelting plants will increase childhood BLL\nby exposing very young children to remnants of lead in the soil that are ingested through\nnormal hand-to-mouth behavior after being tracked into homes or while playing outside\nthe locations of more than 65 historical smelting plants that produced lead-based toxins\nin Chicago from a 2001 investigative study in which researchers built on earlier U.S. Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessments (Eckel, Rabinowitz, and Foster, 2001).\nWe geocoded plant locations at the address level and calculated the number of meters\nfrom the home of each birth cohort member at wave 1 to the nearest smelting plant. We\nincluded sites at which smelting plants were shut down because lead persists in the soil.\nAt wave 1, the average distance to a smelter in our sample was 2,257 meters (median\nThe fact that the public and even environmental professionals were mostly unaware of\nthe soil lead exposure risks posed by many of these plants until recently, especially plants\nthat were shuttered, adds support to our assumption of exogeneity. Put differently, we\nassume that parents did not select into or out of neighborhoods based on the treatment\n(distance to nearest smelting plant), conditional on observed confounders at the indi-\nvidual and neighborhood levels (e.g., poverty and race).10 Consistent with the exclusion\nrestriction, we also have no reason to expect that distance to smelters at age 3 has a direct\neffect on adolescent antisocial behavior, conditional on observed confounders, other than\nthrough lead exposure. Although these assumptions cannot be empirically tested, we are\nnot aware of research findings that call them into question.\nTable 4 presents the results of the first-stage regressions of our IV models, which model\naverage childhood BLL as a function of the same set of control variables as those in our\nbaseline OLS model (see table 2) and our IV, distance to the nearest smelter at wave 1. In\naddition to straight-line distance, we also estimated models that use logged distance and\nlogged childhood BLL. As hypothesized, living farther from a smelting plant at birth is\nsignificantly associated with lower childhood lead exposure across both specifications in\nour first-stage regressions (table 4). Importantly, as shown in the diagnostics section at the\nbottom of the table, smelting plant exposure contributes independent explanatory power\nto our first-stage models. For example, in the second column of table 4 in which adolescent\nantisocial behavior (wave 4) is considered and straight-line distance to the nearest smelter\nis used as the IV, adding our IV to the otherwise complete first-stage model increases its\nThe F statistics for the first stages of our models of adolescent antisocial behavior also\n10. The map of smelter locations in Chicago (appendix D in the online supporting information) shows\nthat they are not concentrated only in areas of poverty and racial segregation. Among our full\nsample, the individual-level correlations of the proportions of children's residential neighborhoods\nthat are non-Hispanic Black and below the poverty line with distance in meters to the nearest\nsmelter are similarly not large, at .10 and \u00ad.36, respectively.\nTable 4.

A 1-\u00b5g/dL increase in average BLL is asso-\nciated with a .03 standard deviation increase in antisocial behavior around age 4 and with\na .12 standard deviation increase around age 17.\nThe results are significant (p < .10) for both waves 2/3 and wave 4, however, when\nwe consider the logged distance models. To aid interpretation of the magnitude of the\nlong-term effects estimated by these models, we calculated predicted antisocial behav-\nior scores for adolescents with mean values of continuous covariates, mode values of\n11. This rule of thumb is approximate, however, and is conservative because it is designed to rule out\nthe possibility that weak instrument bias exceeds 10 percent of the bias associated with OLS. F\nvalues between 5 and 10, such as seen for our waves 2/3 outcome, are often still considered valid\nin the IV literature (e.g., Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011: 162) but should nonetheless be viewed\ncautiously.\ncategorical covariates, and low (4 \u00b5g/dL), medium (7 \u00b5g/dL), and high (10 \u00b5g/dL) child-\nhood lead exposure. This calculation yielded predicted standardized antisocial behavior\nscores of -.56, -.06, and .26, respectively, which is a 1.86-point spread on the raw antiso-\ncial behavior scale (the equivalent calculation for straight-line distance yields a 1.74-point\nspread on the raw scale), illustrating the substantive consequences of increased childhood\nlead exposure for antisocial behavior later in the life course.\nOur IV is conservative because smelting plant exposure is measured when the birth\ncohort members were just born. As families may have moved while the children were still\nyoung and vulnerable to lead exposure, we created a second measure of smelting plant\nexposure that averages distance (in meters) to the nearest smelting plant from wave 1 and\nwave 2 when birth cohort members were around age 3. The coefficients on adolescent an-\ntisocial behavior using this cumulative exposure measure (both straight line and logged\ndistance), presented in appendix E of the online supporting information, are both signif-\nicant and larger than those in table 4. In short, under the assumption that smelting plant\nproximity in early childhood influences antisocial behavior in late adolescence through\nthe pathway of childhood lead exposure, conditional on measured individual and neigh-\nborhood covariates, the IV models generally support a causal interpretation of the lead\nexposure coefficient.\nThe results in tables 2 to 4 support the hypotheses that 1) there is a long-term link be-\ntween childhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in later adolescence, and 2) this\nrelationship is plausibly causal in nature. Prior research findings linking childhood lead\nexposure to later impulsivity and impaired mental health (Winter and Sampson, 2017) as\nwell as associations among impulsivity, mental health problems, and antisocial behavior\nin the criminological literature (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Farrington, 1998;\nGottfredson and Hirschi, 1990) motivate our third question identified earlier: Is the rela-\ntionship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior partially mediated by individuals'\nimpulsive behavior and mental health?\nWe employed OLS regression to assess whether there is descriptive evidence of po-\ntential mediating pathways that would justify further tests for causal mediation. Adoles-\ncent antisocial behavior was our outcome of interest, and along with average childhood\nBLL and our set of covariates, we included parent-reported measures of impulsivity\nand anxiety or depression. Model 1 in table 5 first shows that even though antiso-\ncial behavior around age 4 predicts antisocial behavior in later adolescence, providing\na validity check of our measures, it primarily does not mediate the relationship between\nchildhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in adolescence. Childhood impulsivity\n(table 5, model 2) and anxiety or depression (table 5, model 4) also do not appear to me-\ndiate lead's effects on antisocial behavior. In stricter tests, although adolescent impulsive\nbehavior (table 5, model 3) and anxiety or depression (table 5, model 5) both significantly\nrelate to adolescent antisocial behavior, consistent with the results of prior research, in-\ncluding these measures in our model only accounts for a small portion of the relationship\nbetween childhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in later adolescence.\nAlthough table 5 does not provide descriptive evidence that impulsivity and impaired\nmental health mediate the relationship between childhood lead exposure and antiso-\ncial behavior in adolescence, the data do not allow us to be fully confident that these\nTable 5.

Ideally, we would add self-reported or teacher-\nreported behaviors to these measures as well as measures of impulsivity and anxiety\nor depression taken in adolescence but before age 17 (wave 4). For present purposes,\nhowever, we can safely conclude that the biological assays of lead exposure in childhood\ndirectly predict adolescent antisocial behavior using three different modeling strategies\nand controlling for theoretically informed confounding factors and potential mediating\npathways.\nAs reviewed earlier, some researchers have identified a relationship between lead ex-\nposure and arrest. We theorized that any such relationship would operate through cur-\nrent behavior as police officers do not observe an individual's lead exposure from many\nyears prior. Given the skewed distribution of arrests in our sample, we tested this final\nhypothesis using a negative binomial regression model to examine the relationships be-\ntween childhood lead exposure, adolescent antisocial behavior, and cohort members' ar-\nOn average, childhood lead exposure was slightly higher among those in our sample\nwho had been arrested (6.55 \u00b5g/dL, SD = 3.56) than among those who had never been ar-\nrested (6.10 \u00b5g/dL, SD = 4.87), and even higher among those who had been arrested for a\nviolent crime (7.55 \u00b5g/dL, SD = 3.82). Table 6, however, reveals that these differences are\na weak signal and not statistically significant--childhood lead exposure on its own does\nnot directly relate to arrests of any type, controlling for our covariates. This result holds\nwhen effect heterogeneity is considered by gender, race/ethnicity, immigrant generation,\nTable 6.

At a basic level, then, there is no direct relationship to mediate between lead ex-\nposure and arrest in our sample. This finding is somewhat surprising given that we have\nalready shown that lead toxicity directly predicts antisocial behavior, and the results of\nconsiderable prior research in criminology lead us to expect that antisocial behavior is in\nturn positively related to arrest. This is in fact the case: Table 6 shows that antisocial be-\nhavior robustly and significantly relates to arrest.12 This finding holds whether we consider\narrests for any crime type, arrests for violent crime, arrests for property crime, or arrests\nthat mediation can exist in long-term developmental or life-course processes even if there\nis a weak relationship between the independent and final dependent variables.\nThe results in table 6 are robust to employing logistic regression and a dichotomous\noutcome measure of whether an individual has ever been arrested. In addition, the results\nin table 6 include our full analytic sample regardless of whether individuals continued to\nlive in Illinois after wave 1 of the PHDCN and are, therefore, conservative. When we\nrestrict the sample to those still living in Illinois at wave 4 (N = 189), the patterns are\nthe same. Accordingly, the results in table 6 and associated robustness checks establish\na sturdy and expected association between adolescent antisocial behavior and arrest, but\nthere is no direct association between early lead exposure and arrest.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have presented new evidence of a consistent link between childhood lead ex-\nposure and antisocial behavior in both childhood and later adolescence, with an esti-\nmated magnitude of effect greater than many standard predictors in criminology. Al-\nthough the evidence comes from a prospective birth cohort representative of children\n12. Because some arrests can and do occur prior to the measurement of antisocial behavior in adoles-\ncence, this test is conservative and we do not consider the estimates to be causal.\n13. Although lead exposure is negatively related to arrests for property crime, this is a fragile result\nthat only emerges once antisocial behavior is controlled, as shown in the table.\ngrowing up in Chicago in the mid-1990s, we acknowledge several limitations. Not all\nchildren were tested for lead, and our sample is limited to one city at baseline. The\nsample is also small, so our power to detect differences was constrained. Future re-\nsearch from other places and with larger samples is needed, as is measurement of\nadditional mediating processes through which lead's effects might be exacerbated or alle-\nviated. In particular, we did not find that impulsivity or mental health problems explained\nthe association between lead and antisocial behavior, but research is needed with ad-\nditional measures of children's early environments; children's interactions with parents,\npeers, and teachers; and individual differences in cognitive development and personality.\nUnlike delinquent behavior, we found no association between lead exposure and offi-\ncial arrests, which is consistent with the findings reported by Beckley et al. (2017) in New\nZealand. The results of the few prior studies in the United States that revealed a link\nbetween childhood lead exposure and arrest at the individual level were mostly based on\nolder samples with higher average levels of childhood lead exposure. For example, the\ndisadvantaged Cincinnati cohort studied by Wright and colleagues (2008) was born be-\nexposure on antisocial behavior and, in turn, arrest may have been more pronounced. By\ncontrast, the children in our birth cohort sample had mean levels of BLL less than half\nof the Cincinnati cohort (\u00df6.0 \u00b5g/dL) and came of age during a later period of rapidly\ndeclining crime in Chicago. Hence, there are fewer arrests before age 21 in recent versus\nolder cohorts, and the link between behavior and arrest may be weaker in the current era\nof criminal justice processing than in the past. This may help to explain the smaller ex-\nplanatory power of lead exposure and of antisocial behavior in the model of arrest records\nfor our birth cohort. Consistent with this possibility, in analyses not shown, we found that\nimpulsivity has a stronger relationship to arrest in the older (9, 15) PHDCN cohorts than\nin the birth cohort. Consider too that official arrests are produced by a combination of\nadolescent delinquent behavior and institutional practices, such as police discretion to ar-\nrest conditional on an encounter or variation in the quality of record-keeping systems.\nFuture research is needed to determine whether the results in table 6 represent a period\neffect, a measurement artifact, arrest bias, the malleability and nondeterministic nature\nof behavioral responses to lead exposure, especially at lower levels, or some combination\nthereof.\nIt also bears emphasis that even though our results give credence to an individual-level\nlink between lead exposure and antisocial behavior, they do not in and of themselves\nadjudicate whether reductions in lead exposure beginning in the 1970s contributed to the\nnational crime drop of the 1990s. Such an aggregate-level and time-series link is a separate\nempirical question. Future research is needed to address the empirical validity of any\nnational-level explanations especially that account for conflicting indicators of when and\nhow much crime decreased in relation to the ban on lead in gasoline (Lauritsen, Rezey,\nIs the relationship we observed between lead exposure and individual antisocial be-\nhavior causal? Beyond statistical issues, a core advantage of blood lead levels relative to\ntypical individual characteristics that are assessed in criminology is that lead is an exter-\nnal toxin, with age-graded mechanisms of damage experienced at very early ages--before\nchildren select their environments. Our indicator of lead exposure is also based on mul-\ntiple biological tests, attenuating measurement error. On the one hand, then, lead expo-\nsure offers distinct analytic leverage. On the other hand, there could still be potential\nconfounding in how children are exposed to lead, and true experimentation in this case is\nboth unethical and impossible.\nWe addressed the causal challenge by employing a set of covariates rooted in prior re-\nsearch in public health and criminology. We also used multiple analytic tools, including\nOLS, coarsened exact matching on key predictors of lead exposure, and a theoretically in-\nformed and arguably exogenous instrumental variable, distance to smelting plants. Since\nthe locations of smelting plants in Chicago are variable relative to poverty and race, and\nmany were either closed or not thought to be toxic, it is reasonable to assume a lack of\nneighborhood selection on distance to a smelter at baseline and no direct pathway to an-\ntisocial behavior in late adolescence (again, conditional on our observable measures of\nindividual background and neighborhood context). CEM makes very different assump-\ntions and is based on a subsample of our data with balanced covariates, yet it produced\nvery similar results to both our OLS and IV models. This convergence gives us cautious\nbut increased confidence in the underlying pattern.\nBalancing the strengths and limitations of the data, the weight of the evidence leads\nus to call for increased attention to lead exposure specifically, as well as to toxic inequal-\nity more generally, in the field of criminology. Doing so broadens the reach of life-course\nand developmental criminological theory in several ways. For one, lead poisoning takes its\ntoll very early in the life course--almost out of the starting gate. For another, the finding\nthat lead exposure is linked to antisocial behavior challenges criminologists to conceive\nof individual differences in crime propensity as stemming from more than just genetic,\nfamily, situational, or neighborhood social environments--it is also constituted by the\nbroader ecological context and, in the present case, by structurally and historically shaped\nlead exposure. The results bear similarly on the influential discussion in economics by\nHeckman, Humphries, and Kautz (2014) on the formation of what they called noncog-\nnitive skills or \"character,\" which overlaps considerably with behaviors long studied by\ncriminologists, such as antisocial behavior and self-control (Gottfredson and Hirschi,\n1990). Integrating environmental theories of lead exposure with both criminological and\neconomic perspectives on individual differences in the formation of character is thus a\npromising avenue of future research (Sampson, 2016).\nOur results also offer a novel way to interpret \"child effects\" on parental behavior. As\nLytton (1990) highlighted in his influential review, there is consistent evidence that diffi-\ncult behavior in children (e.g., aggression, impulsivity, and restlessness) provokes parental\nfrustration and often rejection or hostility, which in turn further increases child antiso-\ncial behavior (see also Sampson and Laub, 1993; West and Farrington, 1977). But if our\nresearch findings are any guide, child effects are not solely that--they can be conceptual-\nized in part as environmental effects on parenting that are mediated by the child's impair-\nment from lead exposure. As Bellinger (2017: 1219) argued, family practices and attitudes\nrelated to raising children, which are typically considered as an independent variable in\ncriminology, may in fact be affected by the aberrant behaviors of a lead-exposed child.\nMore generally, our results point to the utility of considering lead's early impact on the\nbrain and neurotransmitter systems, which increases the likelihood of children and ado-\nlescents responding to challenges in their social contexts in ways that provoke rejection\nby parents and, we further hypothesize, larger society (e.g., teachers and neighbors).\nFinally, our results and the more general idea of poisoned child development have im-\nplications for policy in ways different from the usual. Criminological policy normally looks\nto actions governed by the criminal justice system, such as by the police or courts. But lead\nexposure is rightly categorized as an environmental hazard, and its distribution through-\nout the population is determined by business decisions (e.g., where to locate an indus-\ntrial plant or whether to comply with local regulations) and myriad government policies\nand actions, such as federal policies set by the EPA, proper maintenance of the water\nsupply by local municipalities, the remediation of contaminated soil, and the enforce-\nment of restrictions on lead paint in rental units (Markowitz and Rosner, 2013; Muller,\nSampson, and Winter, 2018). Although these are \"noncrime\" policies, they are potentially\nrelevant to reducing crime. To paraphrase Reyes (2007), we suggest that environmental\npolicy is sound criminological policy as well. Agnew (2011) made a similar point with re-\nspect to how climate change policies bear on both criminal behavior and individual traits.\nIf we accept this argument, then our results, combined with the continued threat of lead\nand other toxins in the environment, take on new meaning. Indeed, environmental reg-\nulations are being radically rewritten in the current era, with implications for the future\nquality of water, soil, and air (Lipton, 2017).\nThe field of criminology would thus benefit by expanding its traditional focus on crim-\ninal justice institutions to include a more direct engagement with environmental policy\n(Lynch, Stretesky, and Long, 2015). Lead exposure also tends to be systematically con-\ncentrated in racially segregated and high-poverty neighborhoods (Hanna-Attisha et al.,\n2016; Sampson and Winter, 2016), connecting environmental and criminological pol-\nicy to social inequality (Muller, Sampson, and Winter, 2018). At the very least, the\nvigorous remediation of lingering lead toxicity, especially in disadvantaged neighbor-\nhoods, is a policy effort that is both effective and potentially consequential for children's\ndevelopment.\nREFERENCES\nAchenbach, Thomas M. 1997.
