    "abstract": "Abstract\nA 71-year-old man presented with a thymic mass involving the superior vena cava.\nA mediastinoscopical biopsy initially suggested a diagnosis of type A thymoma. After neoadjuvant\nchemotherapy, the patient underwent en-bloc thymectomy and vascular resection for a pathology-\nconfirmed type B3 thymoma involving the superior vena cava, the left brachiocephalic vein and the\ndistal part of the right brachiocephalic vein. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered. Two years\nafter the primary surgery, abdominal computed tomography (CT) and whole body fluorodeox-\nyglucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans showed a single hepatic lesion that\nwas treated with wedge liver resection. Pathological examination confirmed metastatic type B3\nthymoma. Almost 4 years later, abdominal CT and 18-FDG PET revealed a 2.9-cm solid mass\ninvolving the body of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with lymph node dissection was\nperformed. Pathological examination showed a pancreatic metastasis from a type B3 thymoma,\nwithout lymph node involvement. The patient is alive and free of disease 6 months after the\npancreatectomy (68 months after the initial thymectomy surgery). Intra-abdominal recurrence and\npancreatic metastases are very uncommon manifestations of thymoma, but this event should be\nkept in mind when an abdominal mass is seen during follow-up.\n",

A recent\nwhole body PET/CT scan did not show any\npathological uptake of the 18-FDG\nradiotracer.\nDiscussion\nMetastatic tumours to the pancreas are\nincreasingly being recognized in clinical\npractice and patients with isolated pancre-\natic disease are candidates for pancreatic\nresection.9 A recent review of the English\nliterature found several malignant tumours\nmetastasizing to the pancreas and many of\nthese were single case reports.10 In this\npresent paper, the case of very uncommon\nintra-abdominal metastases from a thym-\noma in an asymptomatic patient is pre-\nsented; he had a wedge liver resection and\na distal pancreatectomy for metastatic\nthymoma, 2 and 5 years after primary\ntumour resection, respectively. Although\nthe follow-up is too short, this case empha-\nsizes the role of surgery for selected, fit\npatients with limited disease, especially for\ntumours not responsive to chemotherapy\nand/or radiotherapy.\nThymic epithelial tumours are classified\ninto thymoma, thymic carcinoma and\nthymic neuroendocrine tumours.6 The inci-\ncases per year and they represent 20% of all\nmediastinal tumours.6 Thymoma is com-\nmonly considered a slow growing tumour\nwith a relatively benign biological behav-\niour.6 Thymomas are subclassified into five\ntypes (A, AB, B1, B2, B3) according to the\nWHO histological classification system.1,3\nThis classification is related to prognosis:\ntype A and AB show disease-free survival at\nIn the present case, there was a discrep-\nancy between type A thymoma diagnosed at\nmediastinoscopical biopsy and type B3 at\nthe final pathological examination of the\nsurgical specimen. Biopsy is not representa-\ntive of the entire tumour so a definitive\ndiagnosis can only be accurately performed\nafter the evaluation of the resected tumour.\nAnother important prognostic factor is cap-\nsular invasion. Noninvasive thymoma recur-\nrence is estimated between 0% and 7%,\nwhile invasive thymoma recurrence is\nDisease progression in thymomas is\nmainly characterized by locoregional\nspread involving the mediastinum and/or\nthe pleural cavity.4 The majority of distant\nmetastases occur in the lung.7 Extrathoracic\nrecurrences are extremely rare (3\u00ad6%)4 and\nstrongly associated with the B subtypes.11,12\nDisease progression can be diagnosed years\nafter the resection of the primary neo-\nPancreatic metastatic thymomas are only\ndescribed in case reports and, to the best of\nour knowledge, only three cases have been\nFigure 3.

Two patients were\nasymptomatic, one presented with myasthe-\nnia gravis and one presented with jaundice.\nTwo patients underwent radical pancreatec-\ntomy, one received a biliary bypass, while one\npatient with concomitant pancreatic and\nbrain metastases, received only supportive\ncare. Survival details were available for only\ntwo patients, both were alive after 6 and 36\nmonths, respectively. One patient died sev-\neral, unspecified, months after surgery.14\nLiver metastases are also rare, but among\nthe extrathoracic metastatic localizations,\nliver is the second most common site.16\nReviewing the English literature identified\nfifteen cases of metastatic thymoma to the\nthe only site of extrathoracic recurrence; and\ndetailed information was only available for\ndescribed metachronous single liver metas-\ntases after primary resection of the thym-\noma;19\u00ad21 and a fourth report described a\ncase of multiple metastatic thymoma to the\nliver (Table 2).17 Neoadjuvant chemother-\napy was administrated and it resulted in\nregression of the primary lesion, which was\nTable 2.

Therefore, lifelong follow-up is\nstrongly recommended for all patients with\na history of thymoma and, in cases of\nisolated abdominal recurrence, surgery\nappears to be the treatment of choice.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
