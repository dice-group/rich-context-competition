American\nfamilies and workplaces are not only diverse by race, gender,\nor overall makeup but are also varied in the way they treat and\nplan for the care of a child, an elderly person, or a sick family\nmember. However, no single national family policy measure\nunequivocally aims at reducing female career interruptions\nand increasing men's involvement in the childrearing or\nelderly care domains. The Family and Medical Leave Act of\n1993 (FMLA), and almost every state law counterpart pro-\nvides unpaid leave for a finite time, but half of American\nworkers are either ineligible to take family leave or cannot\nafford it (Ajinka, 2013). Only four states, California, New\nJersey, District of Columbia, and Rhode Island have imple-\nmented a form of paid family leave. Although women are\nentering the workforce in greater numbers and many are key\nincome earners in their household (Selmi & Cahn, 2006),\nthey are entering workplaces that continue to reinforce the\nmale-breadwinner/female-homemaker family model because\nof continued societal constructs. The unintended conse-\nquences heavily impact women, children, and low-income\nfamilies as well as any employee with caregiver responsibili-\nties. For the majority of employees living in other states, the\nrising childcare and eldercare costs present families with dif-\nficult choices.\nThe United States continues to lag behind many industri-\nalized and developing nations in the degree to which they\nprovide protection for the employee with caregiving respon-\nsibilities. The United States remains the only industrialized\nnation that does not provide a national paid leave for family\ncaregiving (Eichner, 2010). State and Federal law govern\npolicies surrounding parental work leave for taking time off\nto care for a newborn child, adoption, or an ailing family\nmember. The only statutory protections granted by federal\nlaw for families are the FMLA, the Pregnancy Discrimination\nAct of 1978 (\"PDA\"), and the Fair Labor Standards Act as\namended in 2010 which includes a provision to support a\nbreak time for nursing mothers.\n1Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJanice Arellano, M.S.Ed., J.D.

It grants covered employees the\nright to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a span of a\n12-month period to care for oneself, a child, spouse, or par-\nent. Most importantly, FMLA guarantees the right to return\nto one's job following the leave. Other than caring for one's\nchild following birth or adoption, the only way to request\nleave for oneself, a spouse, or parent is to determine whether\nthe ailment is defined as a serious illness under the FMLA\nstatute. As a result, ongoing care such as for the common\ncold or injury may not apply.\nUnder the PDA, employees cannot be fired, denied a pro-\nmotion, demoted, or forced to stop working because they are or\nmight become pregnant. Moreover, employers cannot refuse to\nhire someone because she may become pregnant. However,\nunlike the FMLA, the PDAdoes not require employers to grant\nany leave time for pregnant women and does not guarantee job\nprotection. The only protection mothers have falls under the\nFair Labor Standards Act which provides nursing mothers the\nright to take a reasonable break to express milk at work (U.S.\nDepartment of Labor Wage and Hour Division, 2010).\nIt is clear from recent media coverage that manyAmericans\nstill find this promised work\u00adlife balance to be unattainable.\nOn one hand, there seems to be a growing number of men and\nwomen who have once \"opted out\" of the paid labor market\nto care for children, on the other hand, commentators urge\nworking women to \"lean in\" and secure job protection before\nraising a family (Sandberg, 2013). Existing family policies do\nnot assist workers faced with the choice of either opting out or\nleaning in. As women have moved into the workplace in the\nlast decade, gender barriers in the workforce have rarely\nchanged. Despite the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay\nAct, which allows individuals subjected to unlawful pay dis-\ncrimination to assert their rights under federal anti-discrimi-\nnation laws, American job structures have largely remained\npremised on a model that assumes at least one caregiver stays\nat home, namely, the breadwinner (also known as the home-\nmaker family model; Barzilay, 2012). Today, with the econ-\nomy struggling to improve, policies such as paid sick days\nand paid family leave are more important than ever. Especially\nduring these difficult economic times, losing a job takes a toll\non employees and their families and adds demands on an\nalready strained market while indirectly affecting employers\nwho prioritize cost containment over employee quality and\nretention (Selmi & Cahn, 2006). A change is adamant for\nAmerica to achieve equality in the workplace, and to improve\nfamily life. Women should not be forced to turn down their\nworkplace roles to achieve a work\u00adlife balance.\nThis article is about the needs of workers to have job pro-\ntection and compensation in the event of a crisis at home. This\narticle will discuss the FMLA, how the FMLA reinforces\ngender inequality, and how the FMLA is ultimately inade-\nquate in helping employees care for their family members in\ntimes of need. Then, it will demonstrate that the current\nFMLAis inferior to certain states'progressive legislation, and\nthe progressive legislation of other nations. Finally, this arti-\ncle will offer changes to existing federal legislation to provide\na better work\u00adfamily lifestyle for employees.\nThe Rising Cost of Childcare and\nEldercare\nAmerican employees are entering the workforce while the\ncosts of caring for children and elderly continue to rise.\nParents of children under 18 years of age and families with\nelders in need of care are devoting a greater percentage of\ntheir income to provide support. Studies show that those who\ndo not pay a hefty amount for childcare or eldercare have a\nhigher risk of unsteady employment and workplace absen-\nteeism because they need to take care of their family mem-\nbers (Matthews, 2006). Over the past decades, both women\nand men are working longer hours outside of the home.\nWomen are either working full-time jobs or juggling multi-\nple part-time positions to make ends meet. Accordingly, the\ndemands to keep up with male counterparts in all types of\nindustries illustrate that women are increasingly becoming\nkey income earners in their home and leaving very little\nrecourse to change that pace (Selmi & Cahn, 2006).Although\nmost families are affected by the costs of care, low-income\nfamilies are likely to have fewer resources to reconcile the\nconsequences of balancing the demands and costs of care.\nAlthough the U.S. Government provides subsidies for\nchildcare, through HeadStart and Temporary Assistance for\nNeedy Families, the cost of such programs do not meet the\noverwhelming demands of the population. Consequently,\nsome states have implemented a cap on the amount of subsi-\ndies it will offer low-income families. For example, states\noffer certificates or vouchers that allow families to purchase\ncare from any provider that meets state regulations and\nlicensing standards (Kimmel & Hoffman, 2002). Despite this\nbenefit, the main goals for family leave and childcare poli-\ncies are to help low-to-middle income families become more\nself-sufficient, and limit the demand that requires cash-assis-\nCaring for Elders\nEldercare is a growing national concern. Eldercare addresses\nsuch diverse needs as preparing meals, assisting with per-\nsonal hygiene, providing medical care, transportation, shop-\nping, housekeeping, making appointments, managing\nfinancial affairs, and offering companionship (Pearce &\nKuhn, 2009). Although protecting parents' ability to take\nleave for pregnancy or child health remains an important\naspect of FMLA, eldercare is an issue that has received little\nattention in legislation since 1993. Although the FMLA pro-\nvides that \"an eligible employee shall be entitled to . . . leave\n. . . [i]n order to care for the spouse, or son, daughter, or par-\nent, of the employee,\" the plain language of the statute pro-\nvides little guidance on the meaning of the phrase \"to care\nArellano 3\nfor.\" As a result, management, employers, and courts look to\nthe U.S. Department of Labor's FMLA Regulations for\nguidance.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (2014) regulations discuss\nwhat it means for an employee to be needed to care for a fam-\nily member:\n(a) The medical certification provision that an employee is\n\"needed to care for\" a family member or covered servicemember\nencompasses both physical and psychological care. It includes\nsituations where, for example, because of a serious health\ncondition, the family member is unable to care for his or her own\nbasic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is\nunable to transport himself of herself to the doctor. The term also\nincludes providing psychological comfort and reassurance,\nwhich would be beneficial to a child, spouse, or parent with a\nserious health condition who is receiving in-patient or home\ncare.\n(b) The term also includes situations where the employee may\nbe needed to substitute for others who normally care for a family\nmember or covered servicemember, or to make arrangements\nfor changes in care, such as transfer to a nursing home. (p. 823)\nThe emergence of eldercare is tied both to the advance-\nment in medical science that enables people with health\nproblems to live longer, and to the growing percentage of the\nAmerican elder population. Currently, nearly 20% of those\nabove the age of 65 need help with the basic activities of\ndaily living. Similarly, it is projected that by 2050 up to 20%\nof the American population will be above the age of 65\nDue to this increase in the elder population, many families\nare also under pressure to meet the needs of eldercare while\nalso meeting the demands of their respective careers. The\nmajority of elders live in general population, assisted not in\nhomes or facilities, with family members providing the\nmajority of their care (Span, 2013). Only 5% of U.S. elders\nare institutionalized, and of those 5%, 90% are disabled\nelders in nursing homes, but receive informal care from rela-\ntives and friends. Many of the formal facilities such as\nassisted living and nursing homes provide inadequate, costly\nAmerican families do not all proceed with eldercare in the\nsame way. For example, as a result of decades of immigra-\ntion, many intergenerational transnational family members\nliving in the United States are continuously navigating\nbetween the notions of eldercare described in the FMLA, and\ntheir own cultural understandings of caring for elders. Family\nmembers across generations reconstruct \"rules of reciproc-\nity\" to facilitate the application of ethnic traditions regarding\naging and geriatric care in the context of family separation\nIn an ethnographic study on Taiwanese immigrants in the\nUnited States, Ken C. Sun (2012) writes, \"Given that\nTaiwanese immigrants cannot provide hands-on physical\ncare for their elderly parents halfway around the world, both\nthese immigrants and their parents in Taiwan place more\nemphasis on the emotional dimension of filial piety\" (p.\n1253). Consequently, families of immigrants may equate vis-\niting as a form of care. Employers that emphasize demanding\nhours and erratic shifts as the norm, such as in the hospitals\nand factories, may require employees to limit their care to\nvisiting time with their elders.\nChildcare and the Costs Associated\nMaternity leave is also an important issue for Americans.\nThe issue of paid leave for family care or childbirth is one\nthat is almost equally favorable to republicans, democrats,\nand independents alike (Deng, 2014). Studies have shown\nthat parents with reliable childcare are better able to get and\nmaintain jobs and are able to work longer hours and earn\nmore money (National Women's Law Center, 2013).\nAlthough childcare affects most families economically, low-\nincome families spend a larger portion of income on child-\nWhen both parents work outside the home, it is impera-\ntive that other arrangements are made for childcare. Many\nworking parents choose professional childcare centers, but\nthey are often unaffordable. High-quality private centers\nper month; Cox, 2013). The average monthly income for a\n(Glynn, 2012). Similarly, existing federal tax policies, such\nas the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, most likely\nbenefit middle-income families, instead of the low-income\nfamilies (Tax Policy Center, 2010). For all working parents,\nthey would need to arrange childcare in order to return to\nwork at a reasonable time after childbirth or adoption. As a\nresult, seeking institutional day care may create setbacks\nsuch as waiting lists or other requirements. Paid family leave\nmay assist families to offset costs for childrearing and\nchildcare.\nFMLA and the Need for Family-\nFriendly Workplaces\nOn February 5, 1993, President William J. Clinton signed the\nFMLA into law to provide job protection for certain employ-\nees faced with serious illnesses, and/or caregiving responsi-\nbilities. The FMLA entitles certain covered employees to\ntake 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave for the birth of\na son or daughter, the adoption of a child, or placing a child\nin foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent\nwith a serious health condition; and to care for one's own\nserious health condition when the condition interferes with\nthe employee's ability to perform at work. An employee is\nguaranteed their previous position or a similar one when\nreturning to work.\n4 SAGE Open\nAlthough the FMLA was signed into law as a victory for\ngender-neutral policy (Bhushan, 2012), the work\u00adfamily\nlifestyle has changed immensely since the 20 years that the\nFMLA was passed. Americans quickly learned that the 12\nweeks of unpaid leave that FMLA provides is not always\nenough to care for their loved ones (Silbaugh, 2004). Even\namong families with two parents, who each work full-time,\nthe demand to create schedules that fit their needs or meet\nincome levels that cover costs have proven very difficult.\nInadequate child support and other income transfers are often\neconomically insufficient for single parents with full-time\ncareers (Dowd, 2004).As women are more likely to leave the\nworkplace to have and care for children, as well as take care\nof an ailing parent, they continue to be disadvantaged in the\nworkplace (Ali, 2009). One quarter of the best employers for\nworking mothers provide 4 or fewer weeks of maternity\nleave, and half provide 6 weeks or less. Even the highest\ngrossing companies do not provide adequate leave for work-\ning mothers (Lovell, O'Neill, & Olsen, 2007).\nThe numerous setbacks to family-friendly policies begin\nwith how the FMLA is implemented against the pervasive\nnormative family values considered in U.S. Federal policies\naffecting the family. The beginning of normative pro-family\nvalues crept into public discourse when President Ronald\nOrder 12606 called for the Executive Branch to consider the\nfollowing questions \"in formulative and implementing poli-\ncies and regulations\" of the federal government:\n(a) [d]oes this action by government strengthen or erode the\nstability of the family and, particularly, the marital commitment?\n(b) [d]oes this action strengthen or erode the authority and rights\nof parents in the education, nurture, and supervision of their\nchildren?\n(c) [d]oes this action help the family perform its functions, or\ndoes it substitute governmental activity for the function?\n(d) [d]oes this action by government increase or decrease family\nearnings?\nGovernment has crafted its policies and regulations with the\nidea of normative family values in mind. However, Executive\nOrder 12606 in fact ignores the concerns of the family.\nSenator Walter Mondale (1973) stated, \"[t]o envision a sin-\ngle family model or a single way to raise children would do\ngreat damage to the pluralism and diversity that makes our\ncountry strong.\"\nThe implications of the FMLA are not far from reinforc-\ning the traditional family values of the Reagan administra-\ntion that discouraged women from entering the workforce by\nreinforcing stereotypical gender roles within the home and\nmarketplace (Maril, 2013). The FMLA reinforces the\nantiquated family view that men are breadwinners, and\nwomen can take unpaid leave because their income is not as\nessential to the family's livelihood.Although the FMLAdoes\nnot explicitly state the likely gender of the employee that will\nrequest leave, the eligibility requirements and the nature of\ncaregiving in society often reflect the notion that women are\nmost likely to request FMLA leave if they are eligible\nThe structure of the FMLA assumes that women are more\nfinancially and culturally available to take unpaid leave (Ali,\n2009). To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must be\nemployed with the same employer for at least 12 months and\nmust have worked at least 1,250 hr in the prior year. In addi-\ntion, an employer must have at least 50 employees to be cov-\nered. If there are multiple worksites, employees within a\nmillion workers were ineligible and 47.3 million employees\nwere ineligible because their employer had less than 50\nemployees. The remaining 18.3 million employees were\nineligible because they failed to meet the required number of\nmonths or hours (U.S. Department of Labor, 1996). As a\nresult, almost half of all full-time workers in the United\nStates have no job-protected leave (Boushey, Farrell, &\nSchmitt, 2013). Opponents of the FMLA have argued that\nunpaid leave and eligibility restrictions undervalue because\nFMLA assumes that women can afford to take leave because\ntheir incomes are not as essential (Ali, 2009).\npublished revised regulations that removed an employee's\nability to use accrued paid leave as a substitute for FMLA\nleave (U.S. Department of Labor, 2008). Previously, the lan-\nguage in the FMLA specified that an employee may elect, or\nan employer may require the employee, to substitute any of\nthe accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, or family\nleave of the employee for leave provided under the Act.\nAlthough critics have argued that the interpretation of the\nregulation allowing substitution created incentives for\nemployees not to work, the overwhelming response from\nemployees and the general public illustrated that the substi-\ntution only further disadvantaged employees who are in\nworkplaces without paid leave benefits. Opponents of the\n2008 amendments have argued that the ability to substitute\naccrued vacation or personal leave for paid FMLA leave is\nuseless if employees have to comply with their employers'\npolicies, such as documentation and notice requirements.\nThis procedural hurdle in using accrued vacation or personal\nleave requires employees to bid for vacation time up to a year\nin advance.\nState Programs as Models for National\nReform\nThe FMLA sets the minimum requirements that must be\ncomplied with, but allows state laws to provide greater\nArellano 5\nprotection for employees. The absence of paid leave has\nimpaired the ability of the FMLA to further its goals of help-\ning employees balance the demands of the workplace with\nthe needs of their families. Therefore, several states, such as\nCalifornia, New Jersey, Washington, and Rhode Island, have\nimplemented or proposed some form of paid leave\nlegislation.\nRegulations that affect workers and families often begin\nat the state level. Although the Federal Government plays a\nmain role in regulating the relationships among workers,\nemployers, and unions, state governments have the power to\nestablish greater protections because states have the ability\nto set labor policies in both the public and private sector as\nlong as the policies do not interfere with established Federal\nlaws and regulations (Collins, 2014). In addition, state laws\nregarding fault and no fault divorce had an impact on whether\nfamilies stay together (Ellman, Kurtz, Scott, Weithorn, &\nBix, 2004). Because family leave policies affect children and\noften affect marriages, the care that children receive from\nfamily members is intertwined with state policies. The stabil-\nity and continuity of an employee's job affects stress levels in\nthe home, the quality of caregiving and the employee's pro-\nductivity at work.\nFour states have implemented paid family leave policies\nthat draw their funds from state disability insurance funds,\npayroll, and other wage replacement models. The states with\nfully implemented policies are California, New Jersey,\nConnecticut, and Rhode Island. There are ongoing efforts to\nimplement a form of paid family leave in Washington State.\nThese states can serve as models for federal legislation.\nFurthermore, some states have responded to the FMLA's\nstrict eligibility requirements and have passed legislation\nthat covers employers with less than 50 employees and pro-\nvided job-protected paid sick leave. See Table 1which pro-\nvides an overview of states that have implemented a form of\npaid leave in comparison to existing Federal Law.\nThe Moore-Roberti California Family Rights Act\nBefore the FMLA was passed in 1993, California enacted the\nMoore-Roberti CFRA which provided similar protections to\nthe current FMLA. The state was ahead of the game again in\n2002, when it became the first state to adopt a wage replace-\nment requirement for parents to bond with a newborn or\nadopted child. Governor Gray Davis signed Senate Bill 1661\nTable 1. U.S. Federal Leave Law Versus State Laws.\nFederal law: FMLA\nWeeks of Leave Paid Unpaid\nThe federal FMLA allows a worker to take leave to care for a new child or to care for a parent, a spouse, or a child under the age of 18\n(or older if the child qualifies as a person with a disability) with a serious health condition. In 2008, the FMLA was amended to allow for\n26 weeks of leave for military family members caring for wounded servicemembers. For this military family expansion, the definition of\n\"family\" has been increased to include next of kin. However, the leave remains unpaid.\nState laws\nState Weeks of leave Paid Unpaid Comments\nCalifornia 6  55% wage replacement caring for\na child, parent, spouse, domestic\npartner (includes same-sex spouses).\nNew Jersey 6  67% wage replacement, caring for child,\nparent, spouse, domestic partner or\ncivil union partner with serious health\ncondition\nDistrict of Columbia 1  Only employers with 50 or more\nemployees\nConnecticut 1  Care or self-care for physical disability,\ndomestic violence victims, or sexual\nassault\nWashington 5  Provides additional leave for domestic\nviolence and pregnancy complications\nRhode Island 4  Includes stepparents and parents-in-law\nOther States 0  \nSource.

FMLA = Family and Medical Leave Act.\n6 SAGE Open\nthat put forth the comprehensive paid family leave program\nthat uses State Disability Insurance as its funding source.\nCalifornia employees are afforded the right to 6 weeks of\npartially paid family leave to care for a newborn, an adoptive\nchild, or a seriously ill family member regardless of the size\nof the employer. Payout is equivalent to 55% of wages\nfunded by a mandatory employee payroll tax, which funds\nvides the financial benefit for families that require that paid\ntime off. However, an employee's job may be protected if the\nemployer is subject to the federal FMLA. As a result, the\nplan is an addition to the paid protection for the employees\nwho would be otherwise eligible for unpaid family leave. In\naddition, California provides school-related parental leave,\nwhich allows up to 40 hr per year, but no more than 8 hr per\nmonth to participate in children's educational activities.\nUnlike the FMLA, the California paid family leave allows\nemployees to care for a domestic partner, stepparent, or the\nchild of a domestic partner. Although California's workable\nwage replacement system is efficient and effective, it also\nhas some disadvantages. The California Paid Family Leave\nprovides wage replacement during leave, but does not pro-\nvide job protection during the leaves or the right to return to\nthe same position after leave (Cohen, 2011).\nThe New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) and\nFamily Leave Insurance\nIn 2009, New Jersey enacted a similar program to California\ncalled the NJFLA in which employees may be eligible to pay\na capped amount into their temporary disability insurance for\nup to two thirds of their income. The New Jersey program\ncovers up to 6 weeks of family leave. To establish a valid\nfamily leave claim, an individual must have employment\nwith a New Jersey covered employer and earn a certain\namount of wages. To be covered an employee must earn is\neither US$145 or more per week during 20 calendar weeks in\nthe base year or US$7,300 or more during the base year\n(New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce\nDevelopment, 2014). An individual can claim Family Leave\nInsurance benefits to bond with a newborn child during the\nfirst 12 months after the child's birth or after the child's\nplacement in adoption cases (New Jersey Department of\nThe Family Leave Insurance plan allows an employee,\nthe employee's spouse, domestic partner, or partner in civil\nunion to be the biological parent of the child. The New Jersey\nDivision on Civil Rights enforces the NJFLA, which requires\ncovered employers to grant eligible employees time off from\nwork in connection with the birth or adoption of a child or\nthe serious illness of a parent, child, or spouse (New Jersey\nDepartment of Labor and Workforce Development, 2014).\nThe NJFLA's definition of \"parent\" encompasses stepparents\nand parent in laws. The NJFLA differs from the FMLA in\nthat it covers employee leave for 12 weeks in a 24-month\nperiod. Coverage may be paid, unpaid, or a combination. The\nNJFLA does not allow an employee to use leave time for his\nor her own medical condition, but one can use the protections\nunder the FMLA for those purposes if the employee is eligi-\nble. The NJFLA also applies to companies with 50 or more\nemployees nationwide, instead of within a 75-mile radius in\nthe FMLA. According to the New Jersey Department of\nLabor and Workforce Development, between July 2009 and\nMarch 2012, New Jersey's paid family leave program was\nused more than 60,000 times by parents caring for new chil-\ndren (National Partnership for Women & Families, 2012b).\nHowever, similar to the California program, New Jersey\ndoes not offer job protection to workers who take paid family\nleave under the state's programs. This leaves with the possi-\nbility of not being able to return to their jobs. As a result,\nthere may be an increased risk of job loss for individuals who\nend up taking paid leave.\nRhode Island Paid Family Leave\nsigned into law a bill effective January 2014, that provides\nworking families with income when they have a new child or\nneed to care for a seriously ill family member. Rhode Island's\nprogram, known as The Temporary Caregiver Insurance\nProgram is financed by an employee payroll deductions that\nwill provide 4 weeks of paid leave for family care needs,\nwhich goes into the employee's temporary disability insur-\nance. Unlike the California paid leave plan, Rhode Island\nprovides an employee who takes under this program to return\nto their position with equivalent seniority, status, benefits,\nand pay.\nEmployees will be able to collect benefits for \"any week\nin which he or she is unable to perform his or her regular and\ncustomary work\" due to bonding with a newborn child or\nadopted child or caring for a child, parent, parent-in-law,\ngrandparent, spouse, or domestic partner who has a serious\nhealth condition. The Temporary Caregiver Insurance law\ndefines \"serious health condition\" as \"any illness, injury,\nimpairment, or physical or mental condition that involves\ninpatient care in a hospital, hospice, residential health care\nfacility, or continued treatment or continuing supervision by\na licensed health care provider.\" To receive temporary dis-\nability insurance benefits, employees must both file an appli-\ncation with the Department of Labor and Training and\nprovide their employer with written notice of their intent to\ntake a leave of absence for at least 30 days prior to leave. An\nemployee's failure to provide notice may delay or reduce\nbenefits, unless the leave was unforeseeable. In 2014, the\nRhode Island Department of Labor and Training issued the\nform of the notice. Rhode Island also allows parental leave\nfor up to 10 hr annually to participate in children's educa-\ntional activities.\nArellano 7\nWashington State's Family Care Act\nIn 2007, Washington State passed the Family Care Act which\nwill provide parents with weekly paid leave benefits for up to\n5 weeks in the event of childbirth, adoption, or to care for a\nseriously ill domestic partner, spouse, or parent. This pro-\ngram is similar to the FMLAin the way it defines \"employer\"\nand \"covered employees.\" Unlike the California, New Jersey,\nor Rhode Island plans, the lawmakers still have not decided\nhow they will finance the program, and thus, it has not been\nWashington's approach to paid leave would be to provide\na flat rate of US$250 a week. However, Washington does not\nhave a temporary disability insurance program to build from.\nProponents for the plan argue that a payroll tax may be an\nappropriate funding mechanism. An employer is not required\nto provide employment benefits while an employee is on\nleave, but there are certain important exceptions. Benefits\nlike vacation time, sick leave, and retirement benefits gener-\nally do not continue to accrue during an employee's leave.\nHowever, an employer cannot deny or eliminate employ-\nment benefits that had already accrued before the employee\ntook FMLA leave.\nConnecticut FMLA (CT FMLA) and Job-Protected\nLeave Policies\nConnecticut has implemented the CT FMLA, a state law that\nis similar to the Federal FMLA, but contains greater protec-\ntions. Employees who qualify for the CT FMLA are entitled\nto 16 weeks of job-protected leave, in a span of 24 months,\nrather than 12 weeks. The CT FMLA requires employers\nwith 75 or more employees to provide job-protected leave\nGovernor Malloy passed legislation that allows employees\nwho work in public jobs in Connecticut to earn paid sick\nleave that can be used toward caring for a seriously ill child\nor spouse or even his own illnesses or health conditions. The\nlaw enables pregnant women to use paid sick leave to seek\nprenatal or postnatal care. In addition, the law states that a\nservice worker shall be entitled to the use of accrued paid\nsick leave upon the completion of the service worker's 680th\nhr of employment. However, a service worker is not entitled\nto the use of accrued paid sick if the employee did not work\nan average of 10 or more hours a week for the employer in\nthe most recent calendar year. The CT FMLA law even\nallows the employee to use paid sick leave if he or she is a\nvictim of family violence or sexual assault.\nMassachusetts Maternity Leave\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides greater leave\nrelating to pregnant employees regardless of marital status.\nThe law applies to employers with six or more workers.\nAccording to the law, every full-time female employee is\nentitled to at least 8 weeks of maternity leave if she complies\nwith the following conditions:\na. she has completed an initial probationary period set by\nher employer which does not exceed 6 months or in\nthe event the employer does not utilize a probationary\nperiod for the position in question has been employed\nfor at least 3 consecutive months and;\nb. employee gives 2 weeks'notice of her expected depar-\nture date and notice that employee intends to return to\nthe job.\nUnlike the FMLA, the 3 months tenure makes it easier for\nwomen to start new jobs and still get job protection upon\nmaternity leave.\nAlthough Massachusetts is considered generally to be a\nprogressive state with progressive social policies, the draft-\ners of this bill left much to be desired. One aspect missing is\nthe Massachusetts Leave Act does not apply to male employ-\nees. The Act was recently amended to provide leave for\nadoptive mothers but not to male counterparts. In addition,\nMassachusetts Maternity Leave can count simultaneously as\nFMLA leave. However, employers cannot require employees\nto use accrued time off such as vacation, sick, and personal\ndays during a maternity leave. Maternity leave under the\nMassachusetts Act is available \"at the time of birth or adop-\ntion,\" but not \"substantially earlier or substantially later.\" As\na result, time off due to pregnancy-related complications or\nillness would not count against an employee's 8-week mater-\nnity leave entitlement.\nCalifornia, Rhode Island, and New Jersey are the only\nstates that provide paid family leave insurance for employees\nwho require time off for caregiving (Bravo, 2013).According\nto the National Partnership for Women and Families' Dads\nExpect Better article, other states such as Washington,\nOregon, and Maine have expanded access to unpaid, job-\nprotected leave beyond the FMLA (National Partnership for\nWomen & Families, 2012a). Finally, According to the\nNational Partnership for Women and Families' website on\nCurrent Sick Day Laws, Connecticut, Washington, and D.C.\nare the only jurisdictions that guarantee the right to earn paid\nsick leave (National Partnership for Women & Families,\n2014). As the data show, an employee's access to better\nwork\u00adlife conditions to meet the needs of his or her family\ndepends upon where that employee lives in the United States.\nConsequently, there is an inequity with regard to family\nleave access within the United States.\nAdvanced Work/Family Policies in\nOther Countries\nAs many studies have shown, work\u00adlife balance policies in\nthe United States is inadequate compared with the rest of the\nworld. According to the National Partnerships for Women\nand Families in their Expecting Better Report, 178 countries\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

Europeans and\nAsians have the most generous paid leave laws.\nMaternity Leave Benefits Outside of the United\nStates\nMany countries outside of the United States have interest in\nmaking sure families with childcare responsibilities are\nfinancially sound. In 2010, the International Labor\nwhich reviewed maternity leave policies of ILO member\nstates and determined that out of 167 countries, 97% provide\nmoney to women during maternity leave. According to\nArticle 6 of the Convention, cash benefits shall be provided,\nin accordance with national laws and regulations, or in any\nother manner consistent with national practice, to women\nwho are absent from work on leave. Article 6 further pro-\nvides the following:\nCash benefits shall be at a level, which ensures that the woman\ncan maintain herself and her child in proper conditions of health\nand with a suitable standard of living. Where practicable, and\nafter consultation with the representative organizations of\nemployers and workers, the cash benefits to which a woman is\nentitled during leave should be raised to the full amount of the\nwoman's previous earnings or of such of those earnings as are\ntaken into account for the purpose of computing benefits.\nThe ILO suggests that paid benefits to parents with mater-\nnity or paternity leave should be equivalent to at least two\nthirds of their earnings for a minimum of 14 weeks (ILO,\n2012). In the report, the United States, Lesotho, Papua New\nGuinea, and Swaziland were the only countries without a\ngeneral legal provision of cash benefits for maternity leave\n(ILO, 2012). See Table 2 for a summary of family leave\nTo finance maternity leave, countries develop an insur-\nance pool from social security, employer liability, or a mix of\nboth. Social security systems include health or unemploy-\nment insurance, and public funds, derived from municipali-\nties, states, or governments. These systems use contributions\nfrom a combination of employees, employers, and govern-\nment revenues to create an insurance pool to finance mater-\nnity leave. Financing maternity benefits through social\nsecurity systems is the most common approach among Latin\nAmerican countries. The length of leave is the most common\ngap of the three provisions in this region. Although many\nLatin American countries provide 100% of prior earnings, 14\ncountries fall short of the 14-week standard in Convention\nNo. 183. Five countries in South America provide less than\n14 weeks of leave and pay less than two thirds of prior earn-\nSimilar to the provisions in the FMLA with regard to\nemployee eligibility, many countries exclude domestic work-\ners and highly compensated executives from their cash bene-\nfits and maternity leave programs. South Africa is an\nArellano 9\nexception; they provide cash benefits and maternity leave to\nits domestic workers, agricultural workers, and casual/tempo-\nrary workers (ILO, 2012). To provide optimal maternity pro-\ntection, more countries should seek to include all the aspects\nof Convention No. 183 in their legislation for their citizens.\nParental Leave\nDue to the effects of globalization on the workforce in the\nUnited States, paid leave is critical to consider for the coun-\ntry to compete for the top qualified workers. In many coun-\ntries, there is a growing consideration for both men and\nwomen to take parental leave. Women receive a guaranteed\n16 weeks of paid maternity leave. In Spain, mothers can take\n16 weeks of paid maternity leave, and have the option to\ntransfer 10 weeks leave to the father (Gornick, Ray, &\nmaternity leave, parents combined can take a total of 18\nmonths for parental leave. In Norway, maternal leave is com-\npensated for up to 42 weeks, and the United Kingdom pro-\nvides at least 5 weeks of paid leave (Clearinghouse on\nInternational Developments in Child, Youth, and Family\npaid leave (3 years of leave; Clearinghouse on International\nDevelopments in Child, Youth, and Family Policies, 2003).\nThe paid benefits are set at a flat rate of the equivalent to\nUS$462 per month for second and subsequent children. In\nGermany, parents are allowed 14 weeks of paid leave and\nthey can be paid during part-time employment for 30 hr per\nweek. (Clearinghouse on International Developments in\nChild, Youth, and Family Policies, 2003). Parents in Canada\ncan share 35 weeks of paid parental leave (combined mater-\nnity of 15 weeks and cannot exceed 50 weeks (Government\nof Canada, 2014). Further, places such as South Korea,\nIndonesia, and Russia have implemented full pay for a span\nProposals for Change\nDiscussions surrounding paid family leave have been in the\nworks among many legislators and research organizations.\nOne of the ways to achieve better workplace conditions for\nAmericans and superior social policies that encourage the\nhealth and wellbeing of family relationships is to provide\nquality childcare and eldercare that is affordable in addition\nto the cash benefits that have been proposed the ILO and\nsome states. Legislation needs to be created to expand paid\nleave to all employees and executives. Below are some sug-\ngestions that have been proposed by legislators and\nprofessionals.\nIn 2013, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut sponsored\nproposed legislation known as the Family and Medical\nInsurance Leave Act--\"Family Act\"--which will provide a\nfunding mechanism for the FMLA (Gillibrand, 2013). The\nbill will create a national insurance collection to provide par-\ntial income for up to 12 weeks of leave for an employee's\npregnancy, recovery from childbirth, care for a child, parent,\nspouse, domestic partner, or one's own serious health condi-\ntion. The insurance program would be administered through\na newly created office called the Office of Paid Family and\nMedical Leave, within the Social Security Administration.\nUnlike the FMLA, this program will cover workers regard-\nless of their employer size. As a result, it recognizes that\nmore than half the population works for a small business and\nthat these workers should be entitled to receive leave to care\nfor their families just like employees of large businesses\n(Gillibrand, 2013). This program would be funded through\nemployee and employer payroll taxes which would cost\napproximately US$1.50 per week for the average employee\n(National Partnership for Women & Families, 2013). Benefit\nlevels, modeled after existing successful state programs in\nNew Jersey and California, would equal 66% of an individu-\nal's typical monthly wages up to a capped monthly amount\nthat would be indexed for inflation (Gillibrand, 2013).\nAlthough the Family Act is a proposed legislation, it has the\npotential to implement paid family leave in the United States.\nSocial Security Cares Act\nHeather Boushey of the Center for American Progress estab-\nlished a proposal for Social Security reform to provide paid\nfamily leave insurance known as Social Security Cares. This\nprogram is similar in the way social security benefits are\ngiven to an employer who pays into the program using his or\nher wages and salary (O'Leary, Chayt, & Weissman, 2012).\nSocial Security Cares will be an insurance program run by\neach state in which benefits will supplement family income\nsufficiently to allow workers to take time off. Boushey's pro-\nposal also emphasizes the benefits of Social Security Cares\nto younger workers, who will have the ability to access the\nsystem early, which will provide incentive to continue to\nwork hard until retirement (O'Leary et al., 2012).\nSocial Security's capacity to continue to provide retire-\nment benefits for future generations is critically important.\nHeather Boushey suggests Social Security Cares will not add\nsignificant expenses to the system and will strengthen the\nSocial Security system by increasing the labor supply of\nmothers, workers with health problems, and workers who\nneed to care for those with chronic or serious health prob-\nlems, while further increasing tax revenues to the system\noverall (Boushey & Glynn, 2012). The Social Security Cares\nAct will expand the qualifying criteria to include domestic\npartners of employees (O'Leary et al., 2012).\nA combination of changes to the FMLA as well as the\nSocial Security Cares has the potential to benefit all workers\nin the United States. Protecting families as well as incentivizing\nwork are two values that will create a diverse and thriving\nworkforce.\nPaid Leave in Every State With Job-Protection\nAfter Leave\nThe right to return to one's job is imperative for employees.\nCongress intended for employee's, who need leave to care\nfor their family, to have the ability to return to their jobs\nunder the FMLA. The type of paid leave should help to\nimprove the quality of life for women and families, but not\nbe too generous that it encourages lengthy absences from the\nworkforce (Lester, 2005). Twenty-one states have introduced\nbills to expand their unemployment insurance programs to\nprovide wage replacement to parents following the birth or\nadoption of a child. In addition, several states are considering\nbills that would expand existing temporary disability insur-\nance programs or create new public insurance schemes.\nStates with successful paid leave programs have shown the\nimportance of crafting legislation with appropriate funding\nmechanisms and creating lag for families without the right\nprocess. The trends from these states prove that paid leave is\nTo successfully meet its stated goals and objectives, the\nFMLA should be amended to require paid parental leave and\nmandate each state to provide its own funding mechanisms.\nEach state is capable of instituting its own needs without\ninterfering with Federal policies. States know best what their\nemployees need and should be allowed to make decisions\nconcerning how much paid leave is available for its workers.\nThe FMLA should provide minimum requirements that\nstates must meet. However, states should be given the oppor-\ntunity to exceed those minimum requirements.\nExtend Coverage to Grant Leave for the Care of\nAny Relative\nLeave should be broad to encompass all relatives. Today,\nfamilies are blended and are not always of the traditional,\nnuclear composition that is protected by the language of\nExecutive Order 12606. For many families, the need to care\nfor an aunt or uncle may be equally as important as the need\nto care for one's own ailing parent. Similarly, grandparents\noften fall between the status of in loco parentis and the typi-\ncal grandparent relationship (American Jurisprudence Proof\nof Facts, 2012). Accordingly, these relationships should be\nprotected under the Act or the proposed new legislation\naddressing the nature of various family dynamics. Family\npolicymakers need to consider and engage all types of fami-\nlies (Maril, 2013). Until a national legislation passes recog-\nnizing same-sex partnerships, the definition of spouse should\ninclude those who are married legally by a state, and should\nalso cover civil unions and domestic partnerships. The\nFMLA should be amended to allow same-sex relationships\nto achieve equal access to childbirth and childcare for their\nfamilies.\nPaternal Leave Campaigns\nMen in the workplace are less likely than women to leave the\nworkforce to care for families. The United States is lagging\nbehind other countries that emphasize the importance of the\npaternal role in caregiving for many families. Although the\ndemographics of families have changed over the past\ndecades, most men in heterosexual households have not\nchanged their workdays to accommodate for parenting.\nSurvey results report that women are more likely to take\nFMLA leave as they constituted 58.1% of those who took\ngible employees in a population (Selmi & Cahn, 2006).\nAccording to the National Partnerships for Women and\nFamilies' Expecting Dads paper, only 14 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia provide laws that expand beyond the\nFMLA for expecting fathers (National Partnership for\nWomen & Families, 2013). Future campaigns that empha-\nsize paid leave should not force women to be the ones taking\nbreaks from the workforce. It should be just as important to\nprovide policies that allow working men to also have the\nability to leave the workforce to care for a loved one.\nExpand Definitions of Employer\nThe FMLA's current eligibility requirements leave many\nlow-wage and part-time workers uncovered. One solution to\nexpand FMLA coverage for these workers is to amend the\ncoverage for employees and employers. Under the proposed\nreform to FMLA, employers with 15 or more employees will\nhave to comply with FMLA. As it stands, the FMLA only\nrecognizes employers with 50 or more employees. Although\nhaving all employers eligible under this plan is ideal, the\neasiest solution would be to align the requirement to that of\nalready existing employment related laws. For example, hav-\ning 15 or more employees comply with FMLA aligns with\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans\nWith Disabilities Act. In addition, the proposal to reform\nshould be explicit in providing coverage for part-time\nemployees, and therefore will reduce the number of hours\nneeded to be worked to gain eligibility.\nFunding Mechanisms That Directly Affect\nChildcare and Eldercare Costs\nAlthough this article primarily promotes paid family leave\npolicies, upcoming legislation should consider social policies\nthat deal with maintaining available childcare and eldercare\nafter leave periods expire. After paid family leave and afford-\nable health insurance are implemented in the marketplace, the\nvarious funding mechanisms in which employees pay into\ntheir childcare or eldercare or are matched by their employers\nwith considerable revenue can provide additional support to\nfamilies. Economists suggest that childcare policies should\nallow for parents to choose high-quality care (Blau, 2002).\nAccording to the Center for the Child Care Workforce, 2.3\nmillion paid childcare workers care for children aged 0 to 5\nyears. The populations that need the most assistance with\nchildcare and who also need to get back in the workforce are\noften stifled by current childcare policies. For example, cur-\nrent funding programs provide benefits for working parents\nand parents who are in school or participating in some formal\ntraining. However, the parents who are unemployed or\nunderemployed may not qualify for childcare assistance\n(Gardner, Martin, Holod, Johnson, & Brooks-Gunn, 2009).\nNo Documentation Requirement\nAccording to Frequently Asked Questions and Answers\nAbout the Revisions to the Family and Medical Leave Act\nreport by the U.S. Department of Labor (2009), an employee\nis not required to give the employer his or her medical\nrecords. The employer, however, does have a statutory right\nto request that an employee provide medical certification\ncontaining sufficient medical facts to establish that a serious\nhealth condition exists. Under the regulations, employers\nmay contact an employee's health care provider for authenti-\ncation or clarification of the medical certification by using a\nhealth care provider, a human resource professional, a leave\nadministrator, or a management official. To address employee\nprivacy concerns, the rule makes clear that in no case may\nthe employee's direct supervisor contact the employee's\nhealth care provider (U.S. Department of Labor, 2009).\nEmployees and their families must be able to establish a\nsense of privacy when requesting leave. Currently under the\nlaw, it is the employer's discretion when to request medical\ncertification. Although this is legally appropriate, it seems\nsuperfluous when an employee can establish the proper\nnotice to his or her employer about the need for time off.\nEmployees should be treated in a manner which respects\ntheir decisions when it comes to taking leave to care for one-\nself or other family members.\nConclusion\nGiven the situation of workers and families in the United\nStates, it has become clear that since 1993, taking unpaid\nleave is a burden for many American families, especially\nthose with high levels of educational attainment who may\nqualify under the FMLA, and elders who require ongoing\ncare. Although the FMLA does not place any restrictions on\nthe ability of states to enact more favorable and generous\npolicies, the states that do enact generous policies are paving\nthe way toward protecting employees and their families. One\nsolution for promoting long-term family and medical leave\nwould be to follow the countries that place a greater\nemphasis on family values. Globalization and the economy\nhave affected our workforce as well as our families.\nRevisiting the FMLA in the near future would prove fruitful\nto strengthening the efforts of creating families, and allowing\nwomen to lead in the workplace by finally offering them the\n\"peace of mind\" once suggested to the nation.\nMeaningful compromises must be made between advo-\ncates for paid leave and employers. Despite the economic\ndifferences, work\u00adfamily policy making in the United States\nmust change from the status quo to truly enhance employees'\nwork\u00adlife relationships. The United States must prioritize\nfamily policymaking over ineffective financial shortcuts that\ncompromise both families and employees.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjinka, J.
