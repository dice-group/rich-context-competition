This has been shown, for\nSibling effects on smoking 431\nexample, in an epidemiological sample of adolescents and\nyoung adults, in which older sibling smoking was dem-\nonstrated to be more influential than parent smoking\n(Boyle et al. 2001). In an elegant developmental design,\nDuncan et al. (1996) have shown that older siblings influ-\nenced not only the level of younger sibling smoking but\nalso their rate of use over multiple assessments. This\ninfluence was unique to siblings and not found for par-\nents in this study, indicating that siblings may exert devel-\nopmental effects pertaining to trajectories of use that are\nindependent of (and more robust than) parental factors.\nThere is thus growing recognition that sibling effects on\nsmoking are robust and worthy of studying in greater\ndetail (Avenevoli & Merikangas 2003), and there have\nbeen calls for theory-driven research on sibling influ-\nences on smoking in adolescence (Darling & Cumsille\nRecognizing the robust association between siblings\nfor tobacco use, and especially sibling similarity for tra-\njectories or progression of use over time, is a critical first\nstep to establish the potential importance of sibling effects\non smoking. A second step is to uncover the mechanisms\nunderlying sibling resemblance as these may provide\nsocial or behavioral targets for such efforts in order to\ninform prevention and intervention programs (Boyle\net al. 2001). Siblings share a number of factors--includ-\ning genetic relatedness--that could account for their sim-\nilarity for smoking. However, the classic twin method has\nrevealed repeatedly that shared (or common) environ-\nmental factors--factors that promote similarity among\nsiblings independent of genetic relatedness--are strong\nfor initiation of smoking in adolescence as well as pro-\ngression to higher levels of smoking intensity, and in\nsome cases are of greater magnitude than genetic effects\n(see Li et al. 2003). This is a remarkable finding, in that\nthe detection of substantial and replicable shared envi-\nronmental effects is typically lacking in behavioral\nespecially noteworthy as the twin studies have come from\nmultiple cultures and yet converged on the same theme.\nFor example, a large population-based sample of Dutch\ntwins revealed that initiation of tobacco use was influ-\nenced more strongly by shared environmental rather\nthan genetic factors (Koopmans et al. 1999) and that\nthese familial effects influenced initiation of both smok-\ning and alcohol use (Koopmans et al. 1997). A study of\nadolescent twin pairs in Minnesota found that adolescent\ninitiation of substance use--including tobacco use--was\nprimarily explained by shared environmental rather than\ngenetic factors (Han et al. 1999), and additional studies\nof US samples continue to show shared environmental as\nwell as genetic effects on adolescent smoking (McGue\nnam EraTwin Registry, True et al. (1997) revealed shared\nenvironmental as well as genetic effects on smoking ini-\ntiation. Madden et al. (1999) analyzed twin data collected\nin Australia, Sweden and Finland, and suggested that the\nfamilial factors influencing smoking initiation were\nunique and independent of genetic effects that are asso-\nciated with persistence. Retrospective adult accounts of\nearly smoking behavior in a cohort of nearly 1300 adult\ntwins revealed that age of first use of tobacco (and alco-\nhol) was primarily the result of shared environmental fac-\ntors (Stallings et al. 1999). A study of twins reared apart\nand reared together, derived from the population-based\nSwedish Twin Registry, also suggested that shared envi-\nronmental effects may extend beyond smoking initiation\nand influence the progression to regular tobacco use as\nwell (Kendler et al. 2000). Overall, therefore, twin studies\nof adolescent and adult populations, drawn from numer-\nous countries, have all converged on the finding that\nshared environmental effects are a critical etiological fac-\ntor for initiation of smoking and perhaps escalation of\ntobacco use, which echoes the claim that genetically\ninformative designs can sometimes provide the strongest\nevidence of social effects because they include controls for\nconfounding genetic influences (e.g. Rutter et al. 2001).\nThe behavioral genetic findings reviewed above sug-\ngest that sibling resemblance involves systematic social\ninfluences that make siblings similar in addition to\ngenetic effects. What is especially intriguing is that twin\nmethodology has also implicated direct social contact\nbetween siblings as a critical mechanism underlying the\nshared environmental effects on smoking initiation. In a\nlandmark study, Kendler & Gardner (1998) examined\nthreeclassesof similarityof environmentalexperiencesin\nchildhood and adolescence in a sample of adult twin\npairs: childhood treatment, similitude and co-socializa-\ntion (or social contact between members of the twin pair\nin adulthood). Only co-socialization between twins pre-\ndicted twin resemblance for smoking initiation, and these\neffects were rather specific in that co-socialization was\nnot associated with similarity for other psychiatric disor-\nders. Kendler et al. (1999) have also shown that fre-\nquency of social contact in adulthood predicts twin\nresemblance for nicotine dependence as well as smoking\ninitiation. One limitation of this work is that it is based on\nretrospective accounts of adult twin pairs, which dimin-\nishes the opportunity to examine whether social contact\nactually coincides with early use of tobacco.\nEvidence of sibling effects (which have been defined as\nsocial influences within sibships that are associated with\nbehavioral outcomes; Rowe & Gulley 1992) on tobacco\nuse dovetails with heightened interest in sibling influ-\nences on deviancy in adolescence. Although sibling\neffects on deviancy have been suspected for over two\ndecades, recently they have come to the forefront in a\nnumber of studies (see Slomkowski et al. 2001). Of most\nrelevance for the study of sibling effects on smoking is the\nexistence of theoretical models postulating in more detail\nthe social processes between siblings that may affect ado-\nlescent behavior. We have presented a theoretical model\nof social reinforcement behaviors that may underlie an\nolder sibling's influence on a younger sibling, the appar-\nent `mode of transmission' most probably implicated for\net al. 2002), as reviewed earlier. Critical to this model is\nthe idea that siblings may positively reinforce deviant\nbehavior, especially in adolescence, if the siblings enjoy\nspending time together. In support of this model, we have\nshown that affective quality of the sibling relationship is a\nrobust predictor of delinquent activity in adolescence\n(Slomkowski et al. 2001), replicating and extending sim-\nilar findings reported a decade earlier by Rowe & Gulley\n(1992). Of particular note is that the effect of having\nan older sibling who engaged in delinquent activity\nwas highly dependent on relationship quality with the\nyounger sibling, such that a warm and supportive rela-\ntionship with a delinquent older sibling represented the\nhighest risk for a younger sibling. Furthermore, these\n`sibling effects' were shown to extend over a 4-year\nperiod, such that having a warm relationship with a\ndelinquent older sibling in early adolescence was highly\npredictive of younger sibling delinquency later in middle\nadolescence, even after controlling for initial levels of\nyounger sibling delinquency.\nIt is likely that these social processes are not specific to\ndeviant behavior per se, but rather extend to a broad\nrange of adolescent activity including substance use.\nIndeed, Rowe & Gulley (1992) demonstrated that\nwarmth between siblings, time spent together and having\nmutual friends were predictive of substance use in adoles-\ncence. To date, however, systematic investigation of such\nsocial influence variables and their association with\ntobacco use in adolescence has not been conducted. In\nthis paper, we utilize a unique sample of siblings partici-\npating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health). The Add Health sample includes a\ngenetically informative subsample of monozygotic twins\n(MZ), dizygotic twins (DZ), full biological siblings (FS),\nhalf-siblings (HS) and biologically unrelated siblings (US)\nliving together in the same household. Such a genetically\ninformative sample is powerful in elucidating social\neffects, such as those we propose to exist for sibling influ-\nence on smoking, because of the ability to control for the\neffects of genetic similarity (Rutter et al. 2001). In this\npaper, we examine the role of sibling relationship quality\nin contributing to sibling similarity on smoking, espe-\ncially as a social effect independent of genetic influence\non smoking. Moreover, we provide controls for both\nparental and peer smoking to demonstrate the unique\ninfluence of sibling relationship quality on tobacco use in\nadolescence.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data were obtained from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health), an ongoing\nstudy designed to assess the health status of adolescents\nand explore the causes of adolescent health-related\nbehaviors (see Resnick et al. 1997). Permission was\ngranted by the original study's Principal Investigators for\nuse of the data and human subjects approval was\nobtained from the hospital Institutional Review Board.\nwere drawn originally from a national school survey of\n90 118 American adolescents. Participants completed\nin-home interviews administered between April and\nDecember of 1995 (Wave 1); a follow-up interview was\nconducted 1 year later (Wave 2). Adolescents were\nselected randomly and stratified by gender and grades 7\u00ad\nThese high schools were chosen from an original sample\nof all United States high schools that included an 11th\ngrade and enrolled 30 or more students. To ensure that\nthey were nationally representative, the 80 high schools\nwere selected systematically from the original sampling\nframe, with stratification by region, urbanicity, ethnicity,\nschool type and school size.\nWithin this larger sample, a subsample of families\ncontributed more than one adolescent to the study. Spe-\ncifically, a genetically informative subsample of sibling\npairs was ascertained, reflecting a range of genetic relat-\nedness from 100% (monozygotic twins) to 0% (biologi-\ncally unrelated siblings). Determination of twin zygosity\nwas based primarily on twins' and parents' reports of\nhow physically similar the twins were to one another. For\n89 same-sex twins for whom zygosity remained uncer-\ntain, DNA genetic markers were used to decide zygosity.\nMonozygotic (MZ) pairs were identical for five or more\ngenetic markers; dizygotic (DZ) pairs differed by one or\nmore markers. The other types of siblings were catego-\nrized according to information about the household\nstructure in the home interview, and included full sib-\nlings (FS), half-siblings (HS) and biologically unrelated\nsiblings (US).\nThe present analyses data used specifically from\npairs. By sibling type, the sample sizes were: twins, 403\nSibling effects on smoking 433\npairs; half-siblings, 165 pairs; and biologically unrelated\nProcedures and measures\nStudy interviewers read and recorded responses for items\ndeemed to be minimally intrusive or sensitive. To maxi-\nmize confidentiality, self-reported items deemed to be\nhighly sensitive were presented on a laptop computer\nusing audio-computer assisted interview technology.\nAdolescents were asked the standard question per-\ntaining to number of days smoked over the past 30 days\non each measurement occasion (Lloyd-Richardson et al.\n2002). We examined individual differences on this vari-\nable, utilizing data at each wave, with transformation to\napproximate a normal distribution. Self-report was also\nused to determine if parents smoked as well as the num-\nber of peers who smoke.\nSibling relationship quality was assessed using well-\nstudied and standardized items derived from prior\nresearch on sibling effects on substance use (Rowe & Gul-\nley 1992). The particular items include, on a Likert scale,\nratings of how much time siblings spend together, how\nmuch affection they feel for each other, and the extent to\nwhich they have mutual friends. These are the funda-\nmental constructs that comprise adolescent siblings' level\nof positivity in their relationship (Slomkowski et al. 1997,\nprevious research, principal components analysis of\nthese items revealed a robust single-factor solution repre-\nsenting a latent trait of `sibling social connectedness',\nwith internal consistency (alpha) being 0.91.\nAnalytical strategy\nFor genetic analyses, sibling pairs were categorized based\non their level of genetic relatedness (R). MZ twins were\nassigned a genetic relatedness correlation of 1.0, reflect-\ning their 100% shared genotype. Unrelated siblings (UR)\nraised in the same family (e.g. step-siblings, children from\nsuccessive adoptions, an adopted child or a biological\nchild of the adoptive parents) were assigned 0.0 because\nthey are genetically unrelated. DZ twins and full siblings\n(FS), who share 50% of their genetic material, were\nMultiple levels of genetic relatedness are incorporated\ninto DeFries\u00adFulker regression models (DF) that can be\nused to estimate heritability (h2) and shared environmen-\nSlomkowski 2004). The basic DF model predicts one sib-\nling's phenotype (smoking frequency) from the cosib-\nling's as follows:\n(R \u00d7 SF2) + e\nThe dependent variable is sibling 1's smoking frequency\n(SF1). The independent variables are: (a) the second sib-\nling's smoking frequency (SF2), (b) the sibling pair's coef-\nficient of genetic relatedness (R) and (c) the interaction\nbetween the second sibling's score and the coefficient of\ngenetic relatedness (SF2 \u00d7 R). The intercept (0\n) and an\nerror term (e) are also included.\nThe unstandardized beta-weight on the SF2 variable\n) estimates shared environment variance (c2). The\nunstandardized beta weight on the interaction term (b3\n)\nestimates heritability (h2). For these DF analyses, and for\nall subsequent DF analyses, all pairs were double-entered\nso that the SF of each member of the sibling pair was\nplaced once in the dependent variable (i.e. SF1) and once\nin the independent variable (i.e. SF2). In order to adjust\nthe significance tests for the double entry, the standard\nerrors of the parameter estimates were increased by a\nmultiplicative constant (i.e. 1.41) because a standard\nerror is based on the square root of the sample size.\nOf particular interest for this paper is a modification\nof the basic DF model presented above. This model can be\nexpanded to include additional covariates that can also\nserve as variables for interactive terms with the main\neffects of the latent traits reflecting heritable and shared\nenvironmental influences (Rende et al. 1993). Thus, we\nexpanded this basic model to incorporate sibling social\nconnectedness (SC) to determine the extent to which it\nconditioned both genetic and shared environmental\ninfluences, as indicated below in the expansion of\nequation 1:\n(R \u00d7 SF2) +\nThe interaction term (SC2 \u00d7 SF2) reflects moderation\nof the shared environmental component by the sibling\nsocial connectedness variable. The final triple interac-\ntion term indicates moderation of heritability by sibling\nsocial connectedness. In this model, sibling 2's report of\nsocial connectedness is used to predict sibling 1's smok-\ning frequency to reduce collinearity (see Rowe & Gulley\ndure is again used with the resultant correction for\nsample size. Further extensions of this model were used\nto predict changes in frequency of tobacco use from\nWave 1 to Wave 2, as well as control for parental and\npeer smoking.\nPrior to presenting results of the expanded DF regres-\nsion model, we present correlations stratified by median\nsplit of the social connectedness variable (based on an\naverage of each sibling's response), as well as estimates of\nheritability and shared environment also stratified by sib-\nling social contact. These data provide a descriptive\npicture of the effects of sibling social contact which are\nthen tested for significance by the expanded DF model.\nRESULTS\nWe first present, in Table 1, the intraclass correlations for\nthe five sibling groups (MZ, DZ, FS, HS, US) for past 30-\nday smoking behavior at each time-point, stratified by the\nmedian split on sibling social connectedness. There are\ntwo detectable patterns of findings here. One pattern is\nthat there is some conformity between the magnitude of\nsibling resemblance (intraclass correlation) and genetic\nrelatedness, suggesting some influence of genetic factors.\nHowever, the differences between each level of genetic\nrelatedeness (e.g. MZ versus DZ; FS versus HS) are smaller\nthan would be predicted based on genetic relatedness\nalone, implying that shared (or common) environmental\nfactors also promote sibling similarity independent of\ngenetic effects. A second pattern is that sibling correla-\ntions for all sibling groups are lower under the condition\nof low social connectedness, implying that social con-\nnectedness influenced overall level of sibling resemblance\nfor smoking.\nThese patterns form the basis for applying the basic DF\nmodel (eqn 1) separately to the high and low social con-\ntact groups. Table 2 presents these summary statistics for\neach time-point. The parameters for both genetic and\nshared environmental effects are significant at each time-\npoint, suggesting that both are influential for frequency\nof smoking in adolescence. However, although heritabil-\nity does not change as a function of social connectedness,\nthere is a notable difference in shared environmental\neffects, which are stronger under the higher social con-\nnectedness condition.\nWe next applied the expanded DF model (eqn 2) to test\nfor the significance of the interaction terms reflecting\nmoderation of the shared environment component, and\nheritability, respectively, by sibling social connectedness.\nAlthough social connectedness did not moderate herita-\nbility at Wave 1 (b7\nit was a significant moderator of the shared environmen-\ntal effect at both Wave 1 (b6\nWe further expanded the DF model (eqn 2) to predict\nsmoking frequency at Wave 2 after controlling for prior\nsmoking at Wave 1 (i.e. change in smoking frequency).\nWe continue to observe that social connectedness signif-\nicantly moderated the shared environmental effect\nquency (b7\nsmoking frequencies were highly correlated (r = 0.73),\nwe attempted to determine if the significance of this find-\ning reflected prediction of initiation of smoking (i.e. ado-\nlescents who never smoked as of Wave 1 engaging in\nsome cigarette use by Wave 2) or escalation of smoking\nintensity (i.e. increases in smoking frequency from Wave\n1 to Wave 2 within the subgroup of smokers at Wave 1).\nAbout 43% of the sample reported never trying a ciga-\nrette at Wave 1, and approximately 17% of these individ-\nuals initiated smoking at Wave 2. Sibling social\nconnectedness moderated the prediction of smoking ini-\ntiation at Wave 2 from co-sibling smoking at Wave 1\nicantly in smoking frequency for those who had already\nbegun smoking at Wave 1.\nThe models presented above were re-run including\nseparate controls for parental and peer smoking, respec-\ntively. The parameters presented in these tables did not\nchange substantially. For example, although the stan-\ndardized coefficient reflecting moderation of shared envi-\nronment by social connectedness dropped from 0.21 to\n0.13 at Wave 2 after controlling for parent and peer\nsmoking, this term was still highly significant (P < 0.01).\nOverall, after controlling for parent and peer smoking,\nTable 1 Sibling correlations for frequency of smoking (number\nof days per month) stratified by median split of social connected-\nness between siblings.\nHigh social connectedness\nLow social connectedness\nTable 2 Stratification of genetic and shared environmental\neffects on smoking based on high versus low social connected-\nness between siblings.\nHigh social connectedness\nLow social connectedness\nSibling effects on smoking 435\nsibling social connectedness continued to be a significant\nmoderator of the shared environmental influence on\nsmoking frequency at each time-point, as well as on\nchange in smoking frequency.\nFinally, we considered effects of sibling gender compo-\nsition and sibling birth order in our models. Given the\ncomplexity of our models in this report (i.e. the use of tri-\nple interaction terms), we have limited power to expand\nthe analytical framework further to test for gender com-\nposition effects. Thus, it was not surprising that we did\nnot find significant effects of gender composition on the\nconditional association between social connectedness\nand sibling smoking in the expanded model that also\nincluded zygosity. Given the possibility of low power to\ndetect gender composition effects, we dropped zygosity\nfrom the model in order to examine if sibling social\nconnectedness moderated sibling similarity based\ndifferentially on gender composition. In these models, a\nsignificant interaction term was found for same-sex (both\nbrother and sister pairs) but not mixed-sex pairs. Similar\nmodels were also run to examine the effects of birth order;\nthe described moderating effect of social connectedness\non sibling similarity was found for both older-to-younger\nand younger-to-older prediction.\nDISCUSSION\nRecent research has converged on the conclusion that\nsibling influence is substantial for smoking, especially\nin adolescence. Behavioral genetic studies have sug-\ngested that social factors may play an important role in\nthis process, with sibling social contact being one key\ninfluence. This paper extends this notion in an impor-\ntant way by combining a genetically informative design\nwith measures of smoking frequency in adolescence\nalong with indicators of sibling social connectedness.\nOverall, we were able to demonstrate that sibling social\nconnectedness indeed influenced frequency of smoking\nin adolescence, and that such sibling effects reflect\nsocial influence rather than the influence of genetic\nsimilarity.\nMuch of the previous work on sibling influence on\nsmoking has relied on traditional family study methods\nfocused on full biological siblings (see Avenevoli & Meri-\nkangas 2003). This type of method is critical for indicat-\ning that sibling influence on smoking is notable, but\nconfounds genetic and environmental influence and thus\ncannot yield information on the mechanisms underlying\nsibling similarity. Our paper has focused on social con-\nnectedness between siblings, which has been proposed as\na potential social influence on smoking in both epidemi-\nological (Boyle et al. 2001) and genetic epidemiological\nWe have transported a theoretical model that has been\nwell tested in the etiology of deviant behavior\n(Slomkowski et al. 2001) and in this paper have shown it\nto be valid for smoking in adolescence. The critical addi-\ntion of this report, however, is the demonstration that sib-\nling social connectedness is a significant moderator of the\nshared environmental effect on smoking in adolescence.\nThis can be achieved only by genetically informative\ndesigns (Rutter et al. 2001), such as that offered in the\nAdd Health Study. We believe these data provide a com-\npelling argument that the sibling relationship is an\nimportant breeding ground for social behaviors that\ninfluence use of cigarettes in adolescence, which comple-\nments other studies that argue that peer and parental\ninfluences also represent part of the shared environmen-\ntal effects on smoking (White et al. 2003). Such an argu-\nment is bolstered by our finding that sibling social\nconnectedness moderated the shared environmental\neffect on change in smoking behavior over a 1-year\nperiod, particularly initiation of smoking rather than\nchange in smoking frequency. Our models did not sup-\nport gene\u00adenvironment interaction effects between expo-\nsure to sibling smoking and genetic relatedness, although\nit may be that such effects would be more detectable once\nthe sample ages and begins to manifest higher levels of\nsmoking intensity. Furthermore, as sibling social con-\nnectedness did not appear to reflect genetic effects, there\nwas no evidence of gene-environment correlation. How-\never, it may be that there are underlying individual traits\nthat serve to drive both sibling behavior and smoking\n(such as dimensions of personality) that would reflect\ngene\u00adenvironment correlations that contribute to sibling\neffects on smoking.\nIn this report, we have provided controls for parent\nand peer smoking in order to demonstrate that sibling\neffects on smoking are robust and can be detected. We\nhave performed this, in part, to highlight the importance\nof including siblings in interpersonal models of smoking\nbehavior. Conceptually, however, we agree with theoreti-\ncal perspectives that argue for examining connections\nacross relationships in order to understand more fully\nhow social influences converge to promote risk for smok-\ning in adolescence (Darling & Cumsille 2003). For exam-\nple, we have argued that parental factors set a familial\nclimate via which sibling influences on deviancy emerge\nand blossom during the transition to adolescence\n(Slomkowski et al. 2001), and a similar argument could\nbe made for the early stages of smoking behavior. Fur-\nthermore, our construct of sibling social connectedness\nincludes having mutual friends, thus linking sibling and\npeer influences, which are thought of typically as sepa-\nrate constructs in the literature on adolescent smoking.\nFurther work needs to be done to examine how the\nsalient interpersonal relationships may come together to\npromote risk for smoking in adolescence. That said, how-\never, we would still argue that unique aspects of sibling\ninfluence need to be examined in detail in order to gain\ninsight into the way that siblings may function to connect\nintrafamilial (parental) and extrafamilial (peer) influ-\nences on smoking.\nThe Add Health data set includes two measurement\nperiods separated by a 1-year interval. Although this pro-\nvides a small window on change in smoking over time, we\ndid find that sibling social connectedness represented a\nsocial influence on change in smoking frequency, and\nespecially on initiation of smoking. Further study of this\nsample will provide more opportunity to examine the\nextent to which sibling influence extends across time and\nis predictive of more substantial progression in smoking\nbehaviors (e.g. progression from experimentation to reg-\nular smoking). No differences were found based on\nsibling birth order, similar to recent studies on sibling\nsimilarity for smoking (Vink et al. 2003). However, as it is\npossible that some of the youngest siblings in the sample\nmay eventually initiate smoking, there may be interest-\ning effects of exposure to older sibling smoking that we\ncould not detect with the present data. For example, in\nour work on deviancy, we have shown that having a\nwarm, supportive relationship with an older delinquent\nsibling is associated with younger sibling deviancy 4\nyears later, once the younger siblings enter a period of\nheightened risk for delinquent behavior (Slomkowski\net al. 2001). Further follow-up of the Add Health sample\nmay permit more insight into how sibling social connect-\nedness influences smoking trajectories in younger sib-\nlings and the extent to which they may extend beyond\nsmoking initiation. In addition, similar to other recent\nstudies of sibling resemblance for smoking (Vink et al.\n2003), it appears that same-sex siblings provide more\ninfluential social environments for smoking than mixed-\nsex sibling pairs.\nThree limitations of this study warrant mention. First,\ngiven the broad goals of the study, smoking behavior of\nthe adolescents relied upon self-report questionnaires\nwith rather brief, albeit standard, items. We have relied\non the self-report of smoking frequency over a 30-day\nperiod in our models, although it is recognized that more\ncomprehensive assessment of smoking would be ideal.\nWe do note that there is increasing recognition that\nbehavioral genetic studies of smoking should incorporate\nmore detailed measures of smoking (White et al. 2003)\nrather than rely on simple dichotomies (e.g. smoke versus\nnot smoke), and in this regard the focus on smoking fre-\nquency is in line with this proposal. Secondly, although\nthe sample size is substantial, it is still relatively small to\npursue some issues, such as gender composition effects\non the conditional association between sibling social con-\nnectedness and sibling smoking after controlling for\ngenetic relatedness. Thirdly, the sampling frame (two\nwaves of data separated by a 1-year period) is rather nar-\nrow and does not permit full investigation of sibling\neffects on progression of smoking. However, follow-up\nstudy of this sample will eventually permit such questions\nto be addressed.\nIn summary, we have provided evidence that sibling\ninfluence on smoking functions as a social risk factor,\nafter controlling for genetic effects. As discussed by\nand intervention aimed at reducing early smoking\nbehaviors could capitalize on the demonstration of\nshared environmental effects (`pure' environmental\neffects not confounded by genetic similarity) as well as\ndemonstrated sibling effects, the two constructs which\nhave been merged in this report. A number of social pro-\ncess mechanisms could underlie what we have referred to\nas sibling effects on smoking, especially those that have\nbeen shown to be important for the development of devi-\nancy. These include processes such as direct reinforce-\nment for deviant behaviors, modeling of deviancy and\nintegration of mutual deviant peers in social networks\nline of research will be the application of methods that\ncan capture the nuances of specific social processes that\nunderlie sibling effects on smoking, such as utilizing\nintensive methodologies that can capture social influence\nin real time and across social settings. More detail on the\nactual social interactive mechanisms that form the foun-\ndation of sibling effects on smoking may provide specific\ntargets for prevention and intervention programs aimed\nat reducing both initial use of tobacco as well as early\nstages of progression.\n"
