Excessive release of glutamate and overac-\ntivation of NMDARs during brain ischemia and the hypoxia\nprocess are causally linked to excitotoxicity and neuronal\ndamage. GluN3 subunits, the third member of the NMDAR\nfamily with two isoforms, GluN3A and GluN3B, have been\nconfirmed to display an inhibitory effect on NMDAR ac-\ntivity. However, the effect of GluN3 subunits in brain is-\nchemia and hypoxia is not clearly understood. In the present\nstudy, the influence of ischemia and hypoxia on GluN3 sub-\nunit expression was observed by using the 2VO (two-vessel\nocclusion) rat brain ischemia model and cell OGD (oxygen\nand glucose deprivation) hypoxia model. It was found that\nGluN3A protein expression in rat hippocampus and the pre-\nfrontal cortex was increased quickly after brain ischemia\nand remained at a high level for at least 24 h. However,\nthe expression of the GluN3B subunit was not remark-\nably changed in both the animal and cell models. After\nOGD exposure, rat hippocampal neurons with GluN3A sub-\nunit overexpression displayed more viability than the wild-\nsented pronounced resistance to glutamate insult. Block-\ning the increase of intracellular Ca2 + concentration may\nunderlie the neuroprotective mechanism of up-regulated\nGluN3A subunit. Suppressing the generation of hydroxyl rad-\nicals and NO (nitric oxide) is probably also involved in the\nneuroprotection.\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1Correspondence may be addressed to either of these authors (email zhengjq@bmi.ac.cn or jinli9802@yahoo.com).\nAbbreviations: 2VO, two-vessel occlusion; CNS, central nervous system, DAPI, 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FCM, flow cytometry; gDNA, genomic DNA; HBSS, Hanks'\nbalanced salt solution; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; NO, nitric oxide; OGD, oxygen and\nglucose deprivation; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcription; S\u00adD, Sprague\u00adDawley; TBST, TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20; TTC, triphenyltetrazolium chloride.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n",

Conventional NMDARs are believed to\nform a heterotetramer between two GluN1 and GluN2 sub-\nunits and to require co-activation by glutamate and glycine.\nThe third member of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) fam-\nily, the GluN3 subunit, was discovered in 1995 (Ciabarra et al.,\nshows that functional NMDARs are comprised of GluN1 and\nat least one GluN2 subunit or of GluN1 and both GluN2 and\nGluN3 subunits. The GluN3 subunit has been proven to dis-\nplay an inhibitory effect on NMDAR activity (Henson et al.,\nby GluN1/GluN2 subunits, coexpression of GluN3 with GluN1\nand GluN2 subunits decreases the amplitude of NMDAR cur-\nrent, unitary conductance, Ca2 + permeability and Mg2 +\nH. Wang and others\ntwo isoforms: GluN3A and GluN3B. Both show restricted spa-\ntiotemporal distributions, with GluN3A being predominantly\nexpressed during early development, although the expression\nin certain neuronal populations persists in adults (Wong et al.,\n2002). GluN3B was once thought to be expressed only in mo-\ntoneurons (Nishi et al., 2001). However, it has been found to\nbe expressed in the rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cau-\ndoputamen, nucleus accumbens, cerebellum and lumbar sec-\ntions of the spinal cord. This distribution is the same as that\nIschemic cerebrovascular disease is of great concern be-\ncause of its high morbidity, mortality and pronounced ten-\ndency to cause disability (Woodruff et al., 2011). The patho-\nphysiology of brain ischemia is complicated and involves\nnumerous processes, including increased intracellular Ca2 +\nlevels and excitotoxicity. During brain ischemia, glutamate\nis released by reversed operation of glutamate uptake carri-\ners. The extracellular accumulation of glutamate activates\nNMDARs and leads to an excessive Ca2 + influx through\nNMDAR-operated channels, which disrupts neuronal intra-\ncellular homeostasis and consequently triggers excitotoxic-\nGluN3 subunits can decrease excitotoxicity by depressing\nNMDAR activity. Our previous study showed that the expres-\nsion of GluN3A on rat hippocampus had a time-dependent\npattern. Resistance to ischemic injury was positively related\nto the increased expression level of GluN3A in rat hippocam-\npus (Wang et al., 2012). Transgenic and knockout mice also\nindicate the neuroprotective role of GluN3A (Nakanishi et al.,\n2009). However, the effects and mechanism of GluN3 sub-\nunits that may perform during brain ischemia and hypoxia\nremain unclear. In the present study, the influence of brain\nhypoxia and ischemia on GluN3 expression was observed by\nsetting up a rat 2VO (two-vessel occlusion) brain ischemia and\nhypoxia model and cell OGD (oxygen and glucose deprivation)\nmodel. The effects of GluN3A subunits on brain hypoxia and\nischemia were observed using a GluN3A overexpression cell\nmodel. The results revealed that the GluN3A subunit was up-\nregulated during ischemia and hypoxia and exerted a neu-\nroprotective effect against ischemia- and hypoxia-induced\nneuronal damage. Blocking the rise of intracellular Ca2 + lev-\nels may underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of GluN3A\nsubunits, and suppression of hydroxyl radicals and NO (nitric\noxide) generation may be also involved in the protection.\nAnimals\nmaintained at a constant temperature (22 +\n- 1C) and relative\nhumidity (50%) under a regular light\u00addark cycle (lights on\nat 7 a.m. and off at 7 p.m.) with free access to food and\nwater. The animals were treated in accordance with the NIH\nGuidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996)\nand with those of the local ethical committee. All efforts were\nmade to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number\nof animals required.\nCells\nIsolation of primary neurons from rat brains and\nsubsequent cell culture\nHippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated using a com-\nbination of established methods (Kay and Wong 1986; Das\net al., 1998).

It is clear that the low expression of\nGluN3A in the physiological condition will hinder its func-\ntion to execute. Therefore it is worthwhile exploring what\nhappens to GluN3A subunits during brain ischemia and hy-\npoxia. In the present experiment, the influence of brain is-\nchemia and hypoxia on the expression of GluN3A protein is\nexamined using the rat 2VO model and cell OGD models. It is\nfound that, among all the NMDAR subunits, only GluN3A pro-\ntein expression is raised remarkably in the hippocampus and\nthe prefrontal cortex. GluN1 expression shows little increase,\nwhereas GluN2B expression decreases at first, increases after\n3 h, and retunes to the original level at 24 h after ischemia.\nHowever, the expression of GluN3B subunit remains stable in\nthe animal and cell models (Figures 2 and 3). The increased\nexpression of GluN3A subunit protein could be detected only\n10 min after occlusion, and remains at a high level for at\nleast 24 h. As the expression of GluN3B protein does not\nshow any visible changes during brain ischemia and hypoxia,\nit is suggested that the GluN3B subunit is probably not in-\nvolved in the pathological processes evoked by ischemia and\nhypoxia.\nIn the present study, it is demonstrated that the expres-\nsion of GluN3A is inducible during the ischemia and hypoxia\nprocess. The quick up-regulated expression of GluN3A makes\nit credible that GluN3A could play a neuroprotective func-\ntion. Coincidently, other scientists (Mart\u00b4\ninez-Turrillas et al.,\n2012) have also proved that the expression of GluN3A sub-\nunits protects vulnerable populations of striatal neurons from\nexcitotoxic damage caused by the mitochondrial neurotoxin\n3-NP. They also show that GluN3A-mediated neuroprotection\n240 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGluN3A subunit exerts a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia and hypoxia\nis dose-dependent, which is also consistent with our previous\nTo evaluate the effects of up-regulated GluN3A subunits\nin the brain under ischemic and hypoxic conditions, overex-\npression cell models are made. We compare cell viability of\nrat hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD with and without\nGluN3A transfection. The hippocampal neurons overexpress-\ning GluN3A present more pronounced ability of resisting cel-\nlular damage than the wild-type neurons in the OGD model.\nTo verify that the protective function is directly related to\nsuppressing NMDARs and reducing neural excitotoxicity, we\ncompared the viability of NG108-15 cells with glutamate in-\noverexpressing GluN3A display a lower injury rate than the\nwild-type cells exposed to glutamate. Both MTT and FCM\nassays display the lowest death rate in NG108-15 cells over-\nexpressing GluN3A with pretreatment of MK-801, a non-\ncompetitive NMDAR antagonist. The results are consistent\nwith previous reports (Chrysanthy et al., 1999; Pohl et al.,\nproved that MK-801 could increase neuronal apoptosis in\nthe immature brain, which is consistent with our findings\nthat the apoptotic rate of cells pretreated with MK-801 is\nhigher than those without MK-801 pretreatment in GluN3A\noverexpressing cells after glutamate insult (Figure 7).\nThe pathophysiology of brain ischemia is complicated and\ninvolves numerous processes and mechanisms. Ca2 + over-\nloading has been confirmed to trigger excitotoxicity and re-\nsult in neuron damage during the brain ischemia process.\nBecause excessive Ca2 + influx into neurons is a crucial step\nfor excitotoxicity, we investigate the influence of GluN3A\noverexpression on the intracellular Ca2 + concentration. Ad-\nministration of glutamate and glycine is found to markedly\ncells. When cells are pretreated with MK-801, the influx of\nCa2 + is totally suppressed, suggesting that the increase in\nintracellular Ca2 + levels is predominantly evoked by activa-\ntion of NMDARs. The increase in intracellular Ca2 + levels also\n(Figure 8A). It is suggested that suppression of the increase in\nintracellular Ca2 + levels may be the cause of the neuropro-\ntective mechanism of GluN3A. It is known that GluN1/GluN3\nchannels are less permeable to Ca2 + than the conventional\nNMDARs. Activation of GluN1/GluN3 receptors evoke far\nless Ca2 + -triggered Cl2\ncurrent than GluN1/GluN2 recep-\ntors when Ca2 + is present in the external solutions (Chatter-\nton et al., 2002). Our results imply that the NMDARs exhibit\ndramatically decreased Ca2 + permeability when excessive\nGluN3A subunits present in cells. Of course more evidence\nis needed to demonstrate the existence and increase of NM-\nDARs comprised of GluN1/GluN3 or GluN1/GluN2/GluN3.\nSince high levels of hydroxyl radical and NO are involved in\nischemia-induced neuron damage, we also evaluated changes\nof hydroxyl radical and NO concentrations in cells overex-\npressing GluN3A. Our results reveal that cells overexpressing\nGluN3A show much lower concentrations of hydroxyl radi-\ncals and NO than wild-type cells after glutamate exposure\n(Figures 8D and 8E). It is suggested that suppression of hy-\ndroxyl radicals and NO generation may also be involved in cell\nprotection because the expression of GluN3A is up-regulated\nduring ischemia and hypoxia.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that brain ischemia\nand hypoxia could induce rapid up-regulation of the expres-\nsion of the GluN3A subunit, but not the GluN3B subunit.\nOverexpression of GluN3A could play a neuroprotective role\nduring the pathophysiological processes of ischemia and hy-\npoxia. Blocking the increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentra-\ntion may underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of GluN3A,\nand suppression of hydroxyl radicals and NO generation may\nalso be involved in the neuroprotection.\nHui Wang, Jianquan Zheng and Jin Li were responsible for the\nstudy concept and design.
