    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study analyzed the health of migrants in 4 types of neighborhood in the city of Guangzhou in China. The research shows\nthat the health of internal migrants in urban villages and private housing neighborhoods is much better than those living in\nolder inner city neighborhoods (which are known as jiefang shequ) and unit neighborhoods (which are known as danwei). The\nreasons behind this are the facts that the migrants in urban villages tend to be relatively young and there tend to be better\nsocial and economic conditions in the private housing neighborhood. Moreover, among the 4 kinds of neighborhood, the\ngap between psychological health and physical health is the largest in urban villages. In addition, migrants who are younger,\nhave better working conditions, and have higher levels of education have better health scores, and they tend to have more\nfriends in the city, larger houses, better insurance, and more satisfaction with their neighborhood relationships, and they\ntend to be better adapted to urban life. As for the determinants of health, individual characteristics, community factors, and\ninsurance are the most important factors. Specifically, individual age and age of housing have negative influences on physical\nhealth while insurance has a positive effect. This study shows that the type of neighborhood that migrants live in has a great\nimpact on their psychological health, which can be improved by promoting neighborhood environments. Last, we propose\nthat it is necessary to implement different strategies in different communities.\n",

However, after 30 years, the living\nconditions of internal migrants in China are often poor.1,2\nSubject to urban and rural dual structure, which was formed\nduring the period of the planned economy, although there is\na large number of migrants moving to cities, most of them\nlack basic social protection.3 Most of these migrants live in\nurban villages and the run-down older inner city neighbor-\nhoods, which lack public facilities.4 Poor living environ-\nments and a lack of government support have a negative\nimpact on the health of migrants.5,6 Therefore, it is important\nto carry out research into the health issues faced by China's\nmigrants.\nQi et al7 used data from the Chinese Mobility and Health\nSurvey and found that the health of migrants is better than\nthe health of the rural population that did not migrate.\nHowever, the authors also found that the health of the\nmigrants who return home is lower than before, which leads\nto the poorer health seen in the rural population compared\nwith that seen in the urban population. After moving to cit-\nies, migrants tend to face more health risks than the local\npopulation, as they tend to work in jobs that are more diffi-\ncult and more dangerous.8 Many migrants from rural areas\nare young and healthy, but when they get older or become\nill, they return to the rural areas. Therefore, the health risks\nand disease burden is transferred to rural areas, which exac-\nerbates the demand for health resources in rural areas.9 In\naddition, studies have suggested that the health of migrants\n1Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China\n2Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China\nCorresponding Author:\nChen Hongsheng, School of Architecture, Southeast University, Si-pai-lou\nRoad, Xuanwu District, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.\nin China is affected by intergenerational effects, ie, migrants\nwhose parents have poorer health or greater levels of work\npressure are more likely to have poor physical health.10\nTherefore, narrowing the expanding gap between the rich\nand poor and reducing health inequity is an important task\nfor modern China.\nRegarding the factors that influence health, socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), living and working conditions, and other regional\ndevelopment disparities are important determinants.11,12\nLynch et al13 found that children's family environments have\na large impact on their health behaviors and psychological\ncharacteristics in adulthood. In addition, Robert and House14\nfound that there is a significant positive correlation between\nliquid assets and the health status of those who are middle-\naged and elderly. Lynch et al15 studied data from 282 metro-\npolitan areas in the United States and found that the greater\nthe income gap in each area, the higher mortality rate. Many\nindividuals with high SES experience health problems\nlargely in the later stages of life, but those with lower SES\noften suffer from a rapid decline in health in middle age.16\nWith increasing age, the differentiation between the health of\npeople from different socioeconomic backgrounds becomes\nmore obvious. Therefore, Lynch et al13 believe that the gov-\nernment and society in the United States should recognize\nthe need to improve public health as part of the economic\npolicy, which would be an important measure to enhance the\nhealth of the population.\nWork status is also an important factor that helps to\nexplain the health of individuals. For example, unemploy-\nment has a negative impact on people's health.17 Grayson's\nstudy in Canada found that, when people have the same\nlevel of exercise, the unemployed have poorer health com-\npared with the working population.18 Stuckler et al19 found\nthat for every 1% increase in unemployment in Europe,\nthere was a 0.79% rise in suicides among those aged below\n65 years, and every $10 per person invested in labor market\nprograms reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides\nHousing and community both have a direct impact on the\nhealth of residents, for example, damp and moldy living con-\nditions have an adverse effect on health.20,21 Housing tenure\nalso has an effect on the health of residents. Ellaway and\nMacintyre22 found that different types of housing tenures\nexpose people to different levels of health hazards. Gabe and\nWilliams23 found that there is a J-shaped relationship between\nhousing density and psychological symptoms, ie, low as well\nas high levels of crowding are detrimental to psychological\nhealth. In addition, the health of residents in different com-\nmunities can be very different. The health of residents living\nin poor communities is generally lower than that of those\nliving in affluent communities. High crime rates and chaotic\nliving conditions in poor communities are important factors\nthat affect the health of residents.24 Aneshensel and Sucoff25\nanalyzed a community-based sample of 877 adolescents in\nLos Angeles County and found that youth in low-SES\nneighborhoods perceived more hazards in their local envi-\nronment than those in high-SES neighborhoods.\nIt should be noted that the impacts of social and economic\nconditions and the impacts of the physical environment on\nhealth do not only act in a single direction. People often take\nproactive measures to change their poor living environments\nin order to improve their health and that of their families.\nKearns and Parkes26 found that dissatisfaction and annoy-\nance with a given neighborhood significantly increases the\nlikelihood of residential mobility. Areas that attract migrants\nfrom other areas will, in the long run, develop healthier\nBuilding healthy spaces is an important way to maintain\nor enhance the health of individuals and families.28 Several\nstudies have found that transnational migrants often maintain\ntheir original customs in order to provide healthy living\nspaces for their families.29 Dyck and Dossa30 found that\nmigrant women from India and Afghanistan in Canada con-\ntinued to practice their customs related to food preparation\nand consumption, traditional healing, and religious obser-\nvance, which enhanced the physical, social, and symbolic\ndimensions of their living environment for their families.\nOverall, migrant is one of the main research objects of the\nresearches on health. And the existing research on factors\nthat affect health has largely been carried out in the West and\nin China. From the above, we can see that personal factors,\nwork-related factors, housing factors, medical and pension\ninsurance factors, community factors, and urban life factors\nare the main factors, which affect migrants' health. Still, it is\nvaluable to analyze the health of migrants from geographical\nand urban planning perspective in China's context. In this\narticle, our focus is on the neighborhood. We try to answer\nthe following questions: How is the status of health of\nmigrants in different neighborhoods? and What are the influ-\nences of neighborhood on the health of migrants? This article\ncontributes to the literature on health of migrants in China by\nfirst investigating the impact of neighborhood. The next sec-\ntion introduces the data collection and methods. Third sec-\ntion is empirical findings from the Guangzhou survey. The\narticle concludes with a summary of key findings and a\ndiscussion.\nData and Methods\nIn this article, we analyzed data from the urban areas of the\nChinese city of Guangzhou. The data concerned the health\nof migrants, where migrants refer to those who were regis-\ntered as temporary residents in Guangzhou. The main data\nset used in this article was collected via a questionnaire sur-\nvey that was conducted in Guangzhou from September to\nWe explored data from 4 types of neighborhood: older\ninner city neighborhood (which are known as jiefang shequ),\nunit neighborhoods (which are known as danwei, or \"work\nunits,\" which used to be integrated work and living spaces\nHongsheng et al 3\nthat acted as the basic unit of urban organization for the\nstate), urban villages, and private housing neighborhoods.\nFigure 1 shows the locations of the 18 sampled neighbor-\nhoods. Among them, we collected 61 valid questionnaires\nfrom migrants in older inner city neighborhoods, 67 from\nmigrants in unit neighborhoods, 115 from migrants in urban\nvillages, and 84 from migrants in private housing\nneighborhoods.\nWe collected data on migrants' self-assessed physical and\nmental health scores, which were measured on a scale of 1 to\n5, with 1 representing the worst health and 5 representing the\nbest health. To reflect the health of migrants more accurately,\nwe also took the average value between physical health\nscores and mental health scores as \"overall health score.\"\nBased on the reviews and analysis, data were collected on the\nfollowing variables:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Personal factors: gender (male or female), age (years),\nlength of residence (years), marital status (unmarried,\nmarried, or others), education level (primary school\nand below, high school, or college and above) and\nannual household income\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Work-related factors: satisfaction with work score,\ndaily working hours, number of days of work per\nmonth, type of workplace (government department,\nprivate enterprise, or self-employed), farming dura-\ntion, frequency of changing jobs, and type of work\n(agricultural work or nonagricultural work)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Housing factors: size of housing (m2), age of housing,\ntype of household (family household or nonfamily\nhousehold), housing ownership (owned housing or\nnonowned housing), and age of housing (years)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Medical and pension insurance factors: urban work-\ners' basic medical insurance, new rural cooperative\nmedical insurance, private enterprise employees'\nbasic pension insurance, and new rural social pension\ninsurance\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Community factors: community attachment score,\nsatisfaction with neighborhood score, community\nawareness score, and community quality of life score\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Urban life factors: urban lifestyle fitness score, qual-\nity of diet score, satisfaction with Guangzhou score,\nnumber of close friends in the city, and wishes to\nreturn home\nWe used logistic regression models to quantify the effects\nof personal factors, work-related factors, housing factors,\ncommunity factors, insurance factors, and urban life factors\non the migrants' health.\nResults\nHealth of Migrants in Different Neighborhoods\nAs shown in Table 1, migrants in urban villages and private\nhousing neighborhoods had higher self-assessed physical\nmigrants in older inner city neighborhoods and unit neigh-\nborhoods had lower levels of health, with scores of 4.15 and\n4.27, respectively. Regarding self-assessed mental health\nscores, a similar pattern was exhibited, with migrants in\nurban villages and private housing neighborhoods having\nhigher scores compared with migrants in older inner city\nneighborhoods and unit neighborhoods. Regarding the over-\nall health scores, migrants in urban villages and private hous-\ning neighborhoods had higher scores (both had scores of\n3.99) compared with those in older inner city neighborhoods\nand unit neighborhoods (both had scores of 3.76).\nUsing the sample mean of the overall health score (3.90)\nas a threshold for good health, we calculated the proportions\nof migrants in each of the 4 neighborhoods who had health\nscores of greater than and less than the sample mean, which\nwere used to define those in \"good health\" and \"poor health,\"\nrespectively. The highest percentage of those with good\nhealth was 61.7%, which was for migrants in urban villages.\nThe second highest percentage was 58.3%, which was for\nmigrants in private housing neighborhoods. The lowest per-\ncentage, 37.7%, was for migrants in older inner city\nneighborhoods.\nThe association between various factors and the migrants'\nhealth were analyzed, as shown in Table 2. Regarding gen-\nder, the health score for males was higher than that for\nfemales. The proportion of males with good health was 62%,\nwhile that for females was 43%. Regarding marital status,\nthe proportion of unmarried individuals with good health\nFigure 1. Eighteen sampled neighborhoods in the central urban\ndistricts of Guangzhou.\nwas 61%, while that for married individuals was 52%. There\nwere also health differences by age and length of residence.\nFor those in poor health, the mean age was 38 years and the\nmean length of residence was 13 years, and for those in good\nhealth, the mean age was 35 years and the mean length of\nresidence was 13 years. In addition, the higher the migrants'\neducation level, the higher the health scores. For migrants\nwho had primary education and below, 41% had good health.\nFor migrants who had college education and above, 61% had\ngood health.\nRegarding work-related factors, for those migrants with\npoor health, the mean of their daily working hours was 8.76\nh, while those with good health worked a mean of 9.25 h.\nRegarding the type of workplace, 55% and 57% of migrants\nwho worked in government departments and those who were\nself-employed had good health, respectively. Migrants who\nworked in private enterprises had comparatively lower health\nscores.\nA higher proportion of migrants who had social security-\nrelated insurance had good health, apart from those who had\nnew rural social pension insurance, which indicates that a\nsound social security system can improve migrants' health.\nMigrants with good health had mean house sizes of 49.37 m2\nand those with poor health had mean house sizes of 42.82 m2.\nIn addition, migrants who had good health had larger num-\nbers of friends, better urban lifestyle fitness scores, and\nhigher satisfaction with neighborhood scores.\nFactors That Influence Migrants' Health\nFirst, using the overall health score as the dependent variable\nand the personal factors as control variables in each of the\nmodels, the following 6 regression models were estimated: a\npersonal factors model, a work-related factors model, a hous-\ning model, a community model, an insurance model, and an\nurban life model. Subsequently, the statistically significant\nindependent variables in each of the 6 models were com-\nbined in a comprehensive model, and the determinants of the\nmigrants' health scores were explored.\nAs shown in Table 3, in the personal factors model, gen-\nder and age were statistically significant. The males' health\nscores were higher than females', which may indicate that\nmales have more adaptability to urban life and work pres-\nsure. In contrast, age had a statistically significant negative\nrelationship with health scores. Except in the work-related\nfactors model, the gender and age variables had similar\neffects in the other 4 models.\nIn the work-related factors model, the number of days\nworked per month and farming duration were statistically\nsignificant, and they both had negative associations with the\nhealth scores. The effect of the number of days worked per\nmonth reveals that work intensity influences health, while\nthe variable on farming duration reveals that there may be\nadaptability issues when migrants transfer from agricultural\nto nonagricultural employment.\nIn the housing model, size of housing and age of housing\nwere important factors. The smaller the housing and the\nolder the housing, the greater the negative impact on\nmigrants' health scores. As research in the West has shown,\nimprovements to people's living situations can improve their\nhealth.31 Similarly, the community has also been confirmed\nto be an important dimension that can influence migrants'\nIn the community model, community awareness and com-\nmunity quality of life had a positive impact on migrants'\nhealth scores. Therefore, enhancing community awareness\n(e.g., by setting up community bulletins, other community\nnotification systems, and community events) and the quality\nof life in the community may contribute to improving\nmigrants' health. In the insurance model, the variables con-\ncerning urban workers' medical insurance and new rural\ncooperative medical insurance were statistically significant,\nas medical insurance promotes health. In the urban life\nmodel, the degree of lifestyle adaptation score had a statisti-\ncally significant impact. Adaptation to urban life tends to\nhelp to improve health.\nIn the comprehensive model, gender, age, community\nquality of life, and rural cooperative medical insurance were\nthe most important factors. That is to say, personal character-\nistics, community factors, and insurance are the most promi-\nnent factors that influence migrants' health.\nSubsequently, physical health scores and mental health\nscores were used as the dependent variables in 2 regression\nanalyses which tested the effects of the 27 variables from the\n6 dimensions (i.e., personal factors, work-related factors,\nhousing factors, community factors, insurance factors, and\nurban life factors).Aforward selection method was employed\nin the regression analyses.\nTable 1. Health of Migrants in Different Neighborhoods.\nType of neighborhood Total\nOlder inner city\nneighborhood\nUnit\nneighborhood\nUrban\nvillage\nPrivate housing\nneighborhood\naGood health is defined as an overall health score greater than the sample mean.\nHongsheng et al 5\nIn the physical health score model, migrants'health scores\nwere statistically significantly influenced by age, age of\nhousing, pension and medical insurance, and type of\nworkplace. Among these, age and housing completion time\nhad a negative impact on the physical health scores, while\nthe new rural social pension insurance and the urban work-\ners' basic medical insurance each had a positive impact on\nthe physical health scores. Compared with those working in\ngovernment departments, migrants who worked in private\nenterprises had lower health scores, which is likely to have\nbeen due to the work intensity.\nIn the mental health score model, community quality of\nlife and community awareness were important factors that\ninfluenced migrants' mental health scores. Therefore,\nenhancing the quality of communities may improve migrants'\nhealth. The length of residence and the new rural social pen-\nsion insurance have negative impacts on health. For migrants\nwho had lived in Guangzhou for a long period of time, the\nwillingness to settle down in Guangzhou was very high, but\nthere are high levels of economic pressure in Guangzhou so\nmigrants often face high levels of psychological pressure.\nMeanwhile, although the new rural social pension insurance\nis handled, willingness to return home is not high, which\nresulted in the negative impact of this variable. Moreover, in\nterms of migrants mainly engaged in labor-intensive indus-\ntries, their daily working hours are proportional to their\nincome and greater income helps to relieve life pressures.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis study measured and analyzed older inner city neighbor-\nhoods, unit neighborhoods, urban villages, and private hous-\ning neighborhoods in Guangzhou. Regarding self-assessed\nphysical and mental health scores, the scores of migrants in\nurban villages and private housing neighborhoods were higher\nthan those of migrants in older inner city neighborhoods and\nunit neighborhoods. The migrants in the urban villages tend to\nbe young, and in the private housing, neighborhoods tend to\nhave better SES, which are important reasons behind these\nphenomena. Urban villages and private housing neighbor-\nhoods located at prosperous areas of cities are emerging resi-\ndential communities after the reform and opening up, while\nolder inner city neighborhoods and unit neighborhoods mostly\nformed in the planned economy era. The health level of\nmigrants in the former neighborhoods is higher than that of\nmigrants in the latter neighborhoods, which partly reflects that\nthe growth and the development of economy influence the\nhealth level of migrants in a positive way.\nRegarding the different dimensions of health, migrants'\nself-assessed mental health scores were far lower than their\nself-assessed physical health scores. Migrants in urban vil-\nlages had the largest gap between the 2 scores, and the gap\nbetween the scores in different neighborhoods decreased\nfrom unit neighborhoods to private housing neighborhoods\nto older inner city neighborhoods.\nMales had better health than females, and there was a\nhigher proportion of younger people with good health com-\npared with older people. The migrants' education levels had\nTable 2.

Migrants who\nworked in government departments and those who were self-\nemployed had higher health scores than migrants who\nworked in private enterprises. Compared with private enter-\nprises, social welfare of governmental agency unit is better.\nIn the period of the planned economy, the social welfare of\nemployees in China is mainly affected by their work units or\nthe related rules and institutions. The social status of differ-\nent employees with different social welfare varied a lot.\nHowever, in the marketization reform process, social welfare\nof employees in different employment sectors still has a large\ndifference. Narrowing the welfare gap between different\nemployment sectors is still an important part of China's\nreform.\nMigrants whose health scores were higher tended to have\nmore comprehensive insurance, larger housing, larger num-\nbers of friends, better urban lifestyle fitness scores, and\ngreater levels of satisfaction with their neighborhoods.\nPersonal characteristics, community factors, and insurance\nare the most prominent factors that influence migrants'health\nscores. Among the influential factors associated with physi-\ncal health scores, age, size and age of housing, pension insur-\nance, and medical insurance are important. Age of housing\nhad a negative impact, while insurance had a positive impact\non health scores. Among the influential factors associated\nwith mental health scores, community was an important fac-\ntor. Health insurance is one of the important influence factors\non health of migrants. In the context of China's current spe-\ncial background, registered residence (known as hukou) is a\nthreshold for migrants to become urbanite.33 In this case,\nimproving migrant's health insurance means a lot for nar-\nrowing social welfare between urban and rural migrants.\nMost of the rural migrants in city are at the bottom of the\nheap. Because the social welfare system is not perfect, when\nthey get injured or are suffering from diseases such as pneu-\nmoconiosis, they will lose the ability and opportunity to con-\ntinue to work in urban area. They have to return to the rural\nareas (their hometown), thus lowering the health level of\nrural places. It should be noted that rural areas where the\nsocial welfare system is less developed face the biggest\nhealth risk. Cities have better welfare system, while the gov-\nernment investments of the public services in rural areas are\nfar from enough, which is also the current controversial\nChina's dualistic urban-rural structure.\nThe findings show that, in order to improve migrants'\nhealth, strategies should be targeted to the different types of\nneighborhood. Enhancing the quality of communities and\nthe environment may improve migrants' health. Migrants in\nprivate housing neighborhoods have relatively high SES,\nand the market-oriented approach in these neighborhoods\nmay help to protect and improve their health. However,\nmigrants in the other 3 neighborhoods, especially in the\nurban villages and the older inner city neighborhoods,\nshould be given more support from the government and the\nwider community. The quality of housing, the environment,\nand the public facilities need to be gradually upgraded. In\naddition, improvements to the insurance systems and the\npromotion of social integration are important ways to\nenhance migrants' health. In this article, we use subjective\nvariables to study the health of migrants from the perspec-\ntive of migrants. This study reflects the respondents' own\nsubjective understanding of their own health. Of course, we\ncan also see the differences between this subjective evalua-\ntion and objective evaluation. Subjective evaluation may\nnot be a true reflection of the real health of the respondents.\nTaking health assessment index like body mass index, blood\npressure, lipids, etc, as evaluation criteria may reflect a\nmore scientific reflection of migrants' health. But as a self-\nhealth evaluation research, this study is worth trying. In the\nfuture, based on the research, we will use objective indica-\ntors to conduct more objective studies of the migrants'\nhealth. In addition, there are a lot of health issues that still\nneed to be explored, especially regarding the effects of dif-\nferent neighborhood and environments. The effect of envi-\nronmental strategies on migrants' health should be studied\nfurther using specific neighborhood case studies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the\nReferences\n1.
