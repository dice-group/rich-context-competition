Respondents were 118 employed women who were providing care to an\nimpaired parent or parent-in-law. As predicted, greater time involvement in work was found to buffer women from\nthe negative effects of caregiving stress. Satisfaction with caregiving and satisfaction with work were directly associ-\nated with better well-being, beyond the effects of stress in both roles. However, women who experienced high levels\nof caregiving stress and who were highly satisfied with work were especially vulnerable to depression. These find-\nings illustrate the importance of examining the effects of caregiving stress on well-being in the context of\nwork-related experiences.\nDATA from a national survey of informal caregivers\nindicate that adult daughters and daughters-in-law\nconstitute an important group of family members to pro-\nvide care to impaired older adults (Stone, Cafferata, and\nSangl, 1987). Many of these women have additional family\nresponsibilities, and almost half (44%) are also employed\n(Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). The continuing growth\nin the number of women in the labor force (U.S. Depart-\nment of Labor, Women's Bureau, 1994), along with the\nlarge number of older adults needing long-term assistance\nnow and in the future, has made the consequences of com-\nbining work and caregiving an increasing concern to\nresearchers and policymakers (Stone and Short, 1990).\nAn emerging literature indicates that employment can be\nbeneficial to the well-being of caregivers to an older\nimpaired parent. Employed caregivers often experience\nless caregiver strain and better mental health than those\nwho are not employed (Giele, Mutschler, and Orodenker,\nmost studies of employed caregivers have been limited\nbecause they focus solely on occupancy of the employment\nrole and not on experiences in that role. Little is known\nabout how experiences in these two roles combine to affect\ncaregivers' well-being. The primary purpose of the present\nstudy was to determine how these two roles interact by\nexamining specific aspects of one role that may condition\nthe effects on well-being of stress in the other role.\nThe caregiver and employee roles each have the potential\nto be stressful. It is well established that providing care to\nan impaired older adult can produce a substantial amount of\nstress for family caregivers (e.g., Zarit, 1989). The stressful-\nness of caregiving most commonly stems from dealing with\nthe care-recipient's cognitive and behavioral problems, and\nproviding assistance with activities of daily living (Haley\nand Townsend, 1994). Although being employed seems to\nbe generally beneficial for women's health (Baruch, Biener,\nRoss and Mirowsky, 1995), this role can also be stressful.\nOccupational stressors that have been shown to have the\ngreatest negative impact on women's well-being are a heavy\nworkload (e.g., Barnett, Davidson, and Marshall, 1991), low\njob control or little decision-making authority, and mo-\nnotonous work (Repetti, Matthews, and Waldron, 1989).\nTherefore, it is possible that employed caregivers are in two\nstressful roles simultaneously.\nIn addition to the stressors experienced in these two\nroles, the positive aspects of caregiving and work are\nincreasingly acknowledged. Family members can derive\nmany rewards from caregiving, such as comfort in know-\ning that one's parent is well cared for and an increased\nsense of mastery from meeting the challenges of caregiving\nScharlach, 1994). Rewards experienced in caregiving have\nbeen shown to be related to better well-being for care-\ngivers even when stress in that role and in two other roles\n(mother and wife) is considered (Stephens, Franks, and\nTownsend, 1994). Likewise, the literature on employment\nand women's health indicates that work has many potential\nbenefits that are related to enhanced well-being, including\nthe receipt of social support from co-workers (e.g., Hibbard\nand Pope, 1985) and increased self-esteem (e.g., Pugliesi,\nResearch has shown that experiences in one role can\noften spill over to affect experiences in another role, both\npositively and negatively. These spillover effects may be\nparticularly relevant for the domains of work and family\nSpecifically, investigations of women's multiple roles have\ndemonstrated that experiences in family and work roles not\nonly have direct effects on women's health (e.g., Barnett\nexperiences in each domain can moderate the effects of\nexperiences in the other. Positive experiences in marital and\nparental roles have been shown to buffer the negative\neffects of low job quality on women's psychological\nwell-being (Barnett, 1994), and rewarding experiences on\nthe job have been shown to buffer the negative effects of\nfamily stress on women's psychological well-being (Bar-\nnett and Marshall, 1991; Barnett, Marshall, and Sayer,\n1992). The evidence for role spillover between the domains\nof work and family suggests that this theory might be use-\nfully applied to the roles of work and caregiving. That is, it\nis possible that the satisfying aspects of the caregiver role\ncould help to offset the effects of stress at work, and that\nthe satisfying aspects of work could help to offset the\neffects of caregiving stress.\nIn addition to role satisfaction, the time that a woman is\ninvolved in a given role has been shown to affect her\nwell-being. Previous research reveals that not only is\nemployment generally beneficial for the well-being of both\nmen and women, but also that full-time employment (35 or\nmore hours per week) is particularly beneficial (Anesh-\nensel, Frerichs, and Clark, 1981) and is associated with less\ndepression than part-time employment (Gore and Man-\nsuggested that the advantage of full-time employment may\nbe due to a greater opportunity to achieve the full benefits\nthat this role has to offer, including higher pay, more fringe\nbenefits, and greater opportunities for advancement (Herold\ngivers, time spent at work may also provide them with\nrespite from stress at home, including stress from providing\ncare to an impaired relative (Brody, 1990). Caregivers who\nwork more than 20 hours per week have been shown to\nexperience less stress from caregiving than caregivers who\nHowever, these findings may have been due to the fact\nthat the caregivers working more hours had less impaired\ncare-recipients, provided less care, and received more paid\nassistance with caregiving.\nIn contrast to the beneficial aspects of time spent in the\nemployment role, there is evidence that greater involve-\nment in the caregiver role may be detrimental to women's\nhealth. Prior research on employed caregivers indicates that\na greater number of hours spent caregiving is associated\nwith poorer well-being, including increased stress from\ncaregiving (Neal et al., 1993) and increased role strain\n(Scharlach and Fredriksen, 1994). Other research has found\nthat the combination of providing more hours of help and\noccupying other roles (e.g., employee, wife, and parent) is\nassociated with increased caregiver burden (Stoller and\nPugliesi, 1989). Given the findings regarding the direct\neffects of involvement in caregiving and employment on\nwell-being, it is possible that involvement in one role could\nmoderate the effects of stress in the other role.\nThe objective of the present study was to examine the\neffects of role satisfaction and role involvement on the\nwell-being (physical health, depression, and positive affect)\nof women who simultaneously occupy the roles of employee\nand caregiver to an impaired parent or parent-in-law. There\nwere three hypotheses concerning role satisfaction, and\nthe first two focused on moderating effects. Based on evi-\ndence that positive experiences in the family (or work)\ndomain buffer the negative effects of stress in the work (or\nfamily) domain (e.g., Barnett, 1994; Barnett and Marshall,\n1991), it was predicted that the effects of caregiving stress\non well-being would be buffered by satisfactions experi-\nenced at work and that the effects of work stress on\nwell-being would be buffered by satisfaction in the caregiv-\ner role. That is, it was posited that stress in each of these\nroles would be associated with poorer well-being at low\nlevels of satisfaction in the other role but not at high levels\nof satisfaction in the other role. It was further predicted\nthat, in addition to its moderating effects, satisfaction in a\nrole (either work or caregiving) would be related to better\nwell-being.\nThree additional hypotheses focused on role involvement\n(amount of time spent in a role). Based on evidence that\nemployed caregivers benefit from working a greater num-\nber of hours but not from providing more hours of care to\nan impaired relative (e.g., Enright and Friss, 1987; Neal et\nal., 1993), it was predicted that the effects of caregiving\nstress on well-being would be buffered by greater work\ninvolvement (i.e., working more hours), and that the effects\nof work stress on well-being would be exacerbated by\ngreater involvement in the caregiver role (i.e., providing\nmore hours of care). That is, it was posited that stress in the\ncaregiving role would be related to poorer well-being at\nlow work hours but not at high work hours, and that stress\nin the work role would be related to poorer well-being at\nhigh caregiving hours but not at low caregiving hours. It\nwas further predicted that greater involvement in a role\n(either work or caregiving) would be directly related to\nwell-being. That is, based on evidence that women who\nwork full-time experience better well-being but that care-\ngivers who provide more hours of care experience poorer\nwell-being (e.g., Neal et al., 1993; Wethington and Kessler,\n1989), involvement in the work role was hypothesized to\nhave beneficial effects on well-being, whereas involvement\nin the caregiver role was predicted to have negative effects\non well-being.\nMETHOD\nRespondents\nRespondents were 118 women who were caregivers to\nan ill or disabled parent or parent-in-law, and who were\nemployed at least 10 hours per week. To be eligible for this\nstudy, a woman had to assist her parent with at least one of\nthe following: personal care, shopping, preparing meals, or\nproviding supervision to the parent due to a memory prob-\nlem. In addition, the impaired parent had to be at least 60\nyears of age and reside in a noninstitutional setting.\nRespondents were recruited through newspaper solicita-\ntions, discharge records at a local rehabilitation hospital,\nAlzheimer's Association chapters, and national newsletters\npublished specifically for caregivers. Eligible caregivers\nwho agreed to participate were mailed a questionnaire\nbooklet. A total of 168 questionnaires were mailed to eligi-\nble respondents, and 127 questionnaires (76%) were\nreturned; 9 of these questionnaires contained unusable or\nincomplete data. Of the 118 respondents available for anal-\nysis, 107 were daughters and 11 were daughters-in-law.\nThe average age of the respondents was 48.5 years (SD =\ndents were Caucasian. Respondents had received an aver-\nApproximately 73 percent of the respondents were married,\nand they had been married for an average of 23.6 years (SD\ndents had at least one child living at home, and the average\nage of the youngest child at home was 16.1 years. The\nmedian level of the respondents' yearly household income\n(44%) shared a residence with the parent or parent-in-law.\nThe average age of the impaired parent or parent-in-law\nents (in-law) were female (85.6%). Parents (in-law) had\nrequired assistance for an average of 6.0 years (SD = 6.52;\nrange = .25-40) and respondents had been providing care\nRespondents indicated that 93.2 percent of the parents\n(in-law) required at least some help with shopping for gro-\nceries or doing their own housework; 74.6 percent required\nhelp with preparing meals, and 55.9 percent needed assis-\ntance with bathing. Additionally, 51.7 percent of the parents\n(in-law) needed assistance with understanding simple\ninstructions, and 43.2 percent needed assistance with accu-\nrately reporting the day of the week. Of the 12 instrumental\ntasks examined in this study, caregivers were assisting their\nparent (in-law) with an average of 8.8. More than half\n(61.9%) of the respondents reported receiving assistance\nwith caregiving from other family members or friends, and\n52.5 percent reported using paid help with caregiving.\nInstruments\nTwo general principles were used in designing the role\nstress and role satisfaction measures. First, two sources of\ninformation were used in identifying important experiences\nin these two roles: empirical investigations using measures\nthat were developed from ethnographic interviews with\nindividuals who occupied these roles, and reviews of\nempirical research on employment and caregiving. Ethno-\ngraphic interviews (i.e., those using open-ended questions)\nwere particularly useful for designing measures of role\nstress and role satisfaction because they reflect the perspec-\ntives of individuals who are experiencing both problematic\nand rewarding events in these roles. Second, nonoverlap-\nping items were chosen for the stress and satisfaction mea-\nsures within each role in an attempt to ensure that these\nmeasures reflected two dimensions of role-related experi-\nences that were distinct and not simply polar opposites of\neach other.\nRole stress. -- The measure of caregiving stress consisted\nof caregivers' appraisals of 21 tasks often performed by adult\nchild caregivers in response to the care-recipient's physical\nand cognitive impairment (e.g., arranging services for your\ntask, the respondent was asked to indicate if she had per-\nformed that task in the past month and, if so, how stressful\nthat had been, using a 4-point scale (ranging from 1 \"not at\nall\" to 4 \"very\"). Those tasks that caregivers reported not\nhaving performed were scored as \"0\" (did not happen). Our\nobjective was to create a caregiving stress measure which\nexcluded events that a respondent had not experienced in the\npast month, had never experienced, or that were irrelevant to\nher situation. We were concerned only with the appraisal of\nevents that had occurred. Thus, a caregiving stress score rep-\nresenting the average amount of stress experienced was cal-\nculated by summing the ratings across items and dividing by\nthe number of items endorsed as having occurred in the past\nmonth, the same procedure as used in our earlier research\n(e.g., Stephens, Franks, and Townsend, 1994). The mean\nThe mean number of items endorsed as having occurred in\nbach's alpha for caregiving stress was .88.\nWork stress was assessed with seven items pertaining to\ncommon stressors experienced by women at work (e.g.,\nHaving more work than you can handle). These items were\ntaken from previous research (Barnett and Baruch, 1985;\nKandel, Davies, and Raveis, 1985; Pearlin and Schooler,\nrespondent was asked to indicate if that circumstance\napplied to her work situation and, if so, how stressful it had\nbeen, using a 4-point scale (ranging from 1 \"not at all\" to 4\n\"very\"). Items that caregivers reported as not applying to\ntheir work situation were scored as \"0\" (does not apply). A\nwork stress score representing the average amount of stress\nexperienced was calculated by summing the ratings across\nitems and dividing by the number of items endorsed as\nbeing applicable. The mean work stress score was 2.29 (SD\n= .80; range = 1-4). The mean number of items endorsed as\nhaving occurred in the past month was 5.0 (SD = 2.00;\nrange = 1-7). Cronbach's alpha for this measure was .77.\nRole satisfaction. -- Caregiving satisfaction was assessed\nusing five items from a caregiving satisfaction scale (e.g.,\nHelping your parent makes you feel closer to him/her) (Law-\nton et al, 1989). Each item was rated on a 4-point scale rang-\ning from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree,\" and scores\nwere created by summing across the ratings for all items.\nThe mean level of caregiving satisfaction was 15.26 (SD =\nWork satisfaction was assessed using eight items derived\nfrom previous studies (e.g., Your job is enjoyable; Barnett\nvan, and Kulka, 1981). Each item was rated on a 4-point\nscale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree,\" and\nscores were created by summing across the ratings for all\nitems. The mean level of work satisfaction was 22.35 (SD =\nRole involvement. -- Role involvement was assessed as\nthe number of hours per week spent carrying out the respon-\nsibilities of a role. Respondents were asked to indicate the\nnumber of hours per week that they spent assisting their par-\nent and the number of hours per week that they were\nemployed. The average number of hours per week spent\naverage number of work hours per week was 36.59 (SD =\nrespondents worked 35 or more hours per week (full-time).\nPhysical health. -- The physical health of respondents\nwas assessed using the sum of three items, each rated on a\n4-point scale. Respondents were asked to rate: (1) their cur-\nrent health (ranging from 1 \"poor\" to 4 \"excellent\"); (2) the\nextent to which their daily activities are limited by their\nhealth (ranging from 1 \"a great deal\" to 4 \"not at all\"); and\n(3) their satisfaction with their health (ranging from 1 \"not\nat all satisfied\" to 4 \"completely satisfied\") (House, 1986).\n= 4-12), and the alpha coefficient for this measure was .85.\nDepression. -- The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-\nDepression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to\nassess depressive symptoms. The CES-D is a 20-item scale\nthat asks respondents to indicate how frequently they expe-\nrienced certain symptoms or feelings during the past week.\nScores can range from 0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting\ngreater symptomatology. A cutoff score of 16 on the\nCES-D is indicative of a risk for clinical depression.\nApproximately 44 percent of the present sample scored at\nor above this cutoff. The average depression score was\nfor this measure was .94.\nPositive affect. -- The positive affect subscale of the\nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,\nClark, and Tellegen, 1988) was used to assess positive emo-\ntions. Items in this subscale ask the respondent to rate the\nexperience of 10 positive feelings and emotions experi-\nenced during the past week on a 5-point scale (ranging\nfrom 1 \"very slightly or not at all\" to 5 \"extremely\"). The\n14-^-9). Cronbach's alpha for this measure was .91.\nAnalysis Plan\nFor each index of well-being a hierarchical multiple\nregression analysis was used to test for the moderating\neffects of satisfaction (or involvement) in one role on the\nrelationship between stress in the other role and well-being.\nIn all analyses, stress in the moderating role was controlled.\nThis strategy was used to increase confidence in the inter-\npretation that any observed moderation effects are due to\nrole satisfaction or role involvement and are not due to dif-\nferential levels of stress for those respondents at high and\nlow levels of the moderator. The sample size of approxi-\nmately 118 respondents provided adequate power (.80) to\ndetect an interaction effect for a model in which the effect\naccounted for 5 percent of the variance and the total\namount of variance accounted for was approximately 25\npercent (Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990).\nFor the analyses examining work involvement as a\npotential moderator, three additional control variables were\nused: caregiving hours, parent (in-law)'s level of cognitive\nand functional impairment, and hours of paid assistance\nwith caregiving. These control variables were included in\norder to ensure that any observed moderation effects of\nwork hours would not be due to such factors (e.g., fewer\nhours of care). These factors were shown by other research\nto distinguish between caregivers who worked a high num-\nber of hours per week and caregivers who worked a low\nnumber of hours per week (Enright and Friss, 1987).\nIn order to determine whether any other control variables\nshould be included in the regression equations, bivariate\ncorrelation coefficients between 18 demographic or care-\ngiving-related variables (e.g., age, income, marital status,\nnumber of children living at home, the age of the parent\n(in-law), the cognitive and functional impairment of the\nparent (in-law), duration of caregiving, whether the care-\ngiver and parent (in-law) shared a household), and the pre-\ndictor, moderator, and criterion variables were examined. A\nvariable would be chosen as a control variable for a given\ncriterion variable and either the predictor or moderator vari-\nable. None of the correlation coefficients met these criteria.\nBased on these findings, no additional control variables\nwere included in the regression analyses.\nIn each regression analysis, control variable(s) were\nentered first (including stress in the moderating role), fol-\nlowed by stress in the other role, role satisfaction or role\ninvolvement, and the interaction of stress with satisfaction\nor involvement. For example, when examining the moder-\nating effects of work satisfaction on the relationship be-\ntween caregiving stress and well-being, the control variable\nof work stress entered the equation first, caregiving stress\nentered the equation second, work satisfaction entered\nthird, and the interaction of caregiving stress with work\nsatisfaction entered the equation last. Significant standard-\nized regression coefficients (3) for moderators were indica-\ntive of main effects of these variables (average simple\neffects; Aiken and West, 1991). Moderating effects were\nindicated by interaction terms that added a significant\namount of variance to a model past the main effects (Baron\nIn order to reduce the potential for multicollinearity\nbetween the interaction term and the component parts of this\nterm, centered scores for stress and role satisfaction or\ninvolvement were used in these analyses (Cohen and Cohen,\nscores were created for each respondent by subtracting the\nsample mean for that scale from the individual's original\nscore. In addition, the decomposition of significant interac-\ntion effects was carried out by examining the slope of\nwell-being on stress at high and low levels of the moderator\n(one standard deviation above and below the mean, respec-\ntively), using unstandardized regression coefficients (Aiken\nRESULTS\nRole Stress and Role Satisfaction\nThe percentages of respondents endorsing the stress and\nsatisfaction items within the caregiving and work roles are\npresented in Tables 1 and 2. For role stressors, these tables\nshow the percentages of respondents who endorsed each\nitem as at least slightly stressful. For role satisfactions,\nthese tables show the percentages of respondents who\nagreed or strongly agreed with each item.\nOf the 21 caregiving stress items, 15 were endorsed by at\nleast half of the respondents, and 8 were endorsed by at\nleast two-thirds of the respondents (shown in Table 1).\nThese stressors involved dealing with the parent's moods\nand irritating behaviors, and making decisions about and\narranging services for the parent. Table 1 also shows that\nout of the five caregiving satisfaction items, all were\nendorsed by at least two-thirds of the respondents. The top\ntwo satisfactions related to vicariously experiencing the\nparent's pleasure and meeting family obligations.\nTable 2 shows the rank order of the seven work stress\nitems and eight work satisfaction items. The two most fre-\nquently endorsed work stressors pertained to the amount of\nwork a woman had to do. Almost half of the respondents\n(49.2%) reported being unable to have control over things\nthey do at work as a stressor. Having an enjoyable job was\nthe most frequently endorsed work satisfaction, followed by\nsatisfaction with amount of support from closest coworker.\nThe zero-order correlation coefficients among the inde-\npendent and dependent measures are presented in Table 3.\nWith the exception of the relationship between caregiving\nsatisfaction and work stress (r = -.20, p < .05), the vari-\nables that were examined as potential moderators in this\nstudy -- caregiving satisfaction, work satisfaction, caregiv-\ning hours, and work hours -- were not significantly related\nto the stress measures that they were proposed to moderate.\nThis condition provides a more interpretable interaction\nTable 1.

In addition, the satisfaction\nand hours variables within roles were not significantly\nrelated to each other, indicating that these potential modera-\ntors were assessing different constructs.\nRole Satisfaction and Weil-Being\nThe findings regarding the analyses of role satisfaction as\na potential moderator of role stress on well-being are\nshown in Table 4. This table displays effects that were\ndetected at the last step of each analysis, for each index of\nwell-being. The top half of the table displays analyses of\ncaregiving satisfaction as a potential buffer of work stress,\nand the bottom half displays the analyses of work satisfac-\ntion as a potential buffer of caregiving stress. As stated pre-\nviously, significant regression coefficients for the moderator\nvariables indicate main effects of these variables; moderat-\ning effects are indicated by interaction terms that add a sig-\nnificant amount of variance to a model past the the main\neffects.

These effects emerged independent of\ncaregiving stress, work stress, and the interaction terms.\nModerating effects. -- No significant buffering effects\nwere found for caregiving satisfaction on the relationship\nbetween work stress and well-being. That is, satisfaction in\nthe caregiver role did not interact significantly with work\nstress for any index of well-being. In addition, no signifi-\ncant interactions were found between work satisfaction and\ncaregiving stress in analyses of physical health and positive\naffect. However, a significant interaction effect was found\nbetween work satisfaction and caregiving stress in the anal-\nysis of depression. This interaction term accounted for an\nadditional 2.22 percent of the variance past the main effects\nand effects of the control variable.\nA decomposition analysis was conducted for this interac-\ntion to determine the significance of the slope of depression\non caregiving stress at low work satisfaction (one standard\ndeviation below the mean, equivalent to a role satisfaction\nscore of 17.94) and high work satisfaction (one standard\ndeviation above the mean, equivalent to a role satisfaction\nscore of 26.76). The slope of depression on caregiving\nstress was significantly different from zero at both low\nwork satisfaction (b = 5.56, p < .05) and high work satis-\ncoefficients indicated that higher caregiving stress was\nrelated to a greater level of depression for women reporting\nlow or high work satisfaction, with a much stronger rela-\ntionship between caregiving stress and depression for those\nwomen reporting high work satisfaction. This finding was\nnot consistent with that predicted by our hypothesis, which\nstated that a significant slope of caregiving stress on\ndepression would be found only for those women who were\nless satisfied at work. As Figure 1 shows, a significant rela-\ntionship between caregiving stress and well-being was\nfound at both low and high levels of work satisfaction, and\ncaregiving stress had a much greater impact on depression\nfor those women with high work satisfaction than for those\nwomen with low work satisfaction. However, it is also\nimportant to note that although women with low work sat-\nisfaction did not experience such elevated levels of depres-\nsion at high levels of caregiving stress, this group experi-\nenced greater overall levels of depression than women who\nmean level of depression for the low work satisfaction\ndepression for the high work satisfaction group was 13.5\nRole Involvement and Weil-Being\nTable 5 presents the effects found in the analyses of role\ninvolvement as a potential moderator. As in Table 4, this\ntable displays effects that were detected at the last step of\neach analysis. The top half of the table displays the analy-\nses of caregiving involvement as a potential exacerbator of\nwork stress, and the bottom half of the table displays the\nanalyses of work involvement as a potential buffer of care-\ngiving stress. With the exception of the equation for care-\ngiving involvement and positive affect, all models were\nsignificant at or beyond the .01 level, and the total amount\nof variance in well-being accounted for in the models that\nreached significance ranged from 7 to 29 percent.\nCL \u00b7 Low Work\nSatisfaction\nHigh Work\nSatisfaction\nLow Stress High Stress\nCaregiving Stress\nFigure 1.

These interactions accounted for an\nwell-being. The interaction between work hours and care-\ngiving stress on depression is depicted in Figure 2. Graphs\nfor the other interaction terms had similar interpretations.\nAs Figure 2 shows, a high level of caregiving stress was not\nrelated to greater depression for those women working a\nhigh number of hours, but high caregiving stress was asso-\nciated with greater depression for those women working a\nlow number of hours.\nDecomposition analyses were conducted for each signifi-\ncant interaction effect to determine the significance of the\nslope of well-being on caregiving stress at low work hours\n(one standard deviation below the mean, equivalent to 27.5\nhours worked per week) and high work hours (one standard\ndeviation above the mean, equivalent to 45.7 hours worked\nper week). The slope of physical health on caregiving stress\nwas significantly different from zero at a low number of\nwork hours (b = -1.98, p < .05), but not at a high number of\nwork hours (b = -.36).

As predicted,\nwomen who worked a greater number of hours were\nbuffered from the deleterious effects of caregiving stress,\nand these results were found for all three indices of\nwell-being. Although women who were more satisfied at\nwork experienced fewer depressive symptoms than women\nwho were less satisfied, high work satisfaction was associ-\nated with much greater levels of depression under high lev-\nels of caregiving stress. Furthermore, satisfaction in both\nthe caregiving and work roles was directly related to\ngreater well-being even after controlling for the level of\nstress experienced in these roles.\nThe findings that most strongly supported our hypothesis\nconcerning role involvement were found for the domain of\nwork. For those women who worked part-time, higher lev-\nels of caregiving stress were related to poorer physical\nhealth, greater depression, and less positive affect. In con-\ntrast, for those women who worked full-time, there was no\nassociation between higher caregiving stress and poorer\nphysical health, greater depression, or less positive affect.\nThe protective effects of full-time employment found for\nwomen involved in parent care may have several explana-\ntions. First, these effects may be due to the greater amount\nof time away from caregiving that working more hours pro-\nvides. As suggested by others (e.g., Brody, 1990; Scharlach,\n1994), time spent at work may provide women with\nmuch-needed respite or distraction from the responsibilities\nof caregiving. Second, it is possible that the advantage of\nfull-time work stems from the greater financial, social, and\npsychological resources it provides over part-time work.\nFull-time workers often receive higher pay, have more\nfringe benefits, and have greater opportunities for career\nadvancement than part-time workers (Herold and Waldron,\nthat full-time workers more fully participate in the social\nlife of the workplace and have more access to supportive\nsocial relationships with co-workers (Wethington and\nOther research on employed caregivers has also found\nbeneficial effects of full-time work for caregivers when com-\npared to part-time work (Enright and Friss, 1987). In this\nresearch, however, other factors -- such as hours of care,\nimpairment of the care-recipient, and hours of paid assis-\ntance -- may have accounted for those findings. Given that\nthe present study found that work involvement buffered the\neffects of caregiving stress even after controlling for these\nfactors, our conclusion -- that the beneficial effects of\nfull-time employment are due to the greater amount of\nrespite and resources gained -- is strengthened.\nOur hypotheses regarding the main effects of role in-\nvolvement were not supported. No main effects were\nfound for caregiving involvement. Greater work involve-\nment was found to be related to only one index of well-\nbeing, and this relationship was opposite to our prediction.\nA higher number of work hours was related to less (rather\nthan more) positive affect. This finding also contradicts\nresearch in the larger literature on women's work, which\nshows that full-time work is more beneficial for women\nthan part-time work (Wethington and Kessler, 1989). How-\never, this finding is somewhat consistent with other re-\nsearch on employed caregivers, which has found that care-\ngivers who are employed a greater number of hours also\nexperience more global stress and more difficulty combin-\ning work and family (Gottlieb, Kelloway, and Fraboni,\nworking more hours may help to protect against the effects\nof caregiving stress, overall it is also associated with less\npositive affect.\nWe found mixed evidence for the protective effects of\nwork satisfaction. As predicted, low work satisfaction was\nassociated with greater depression under conditions of high\ncaregiving stress. This finding is consistent with the re-\nsearch of others regarding the buffering effects of work\nrewards on stressful family experiences (Barnett and Mar-\nto our prediction, higher levels of depression were also\nfound for those women who were highly satisfied with\nwork, and this relationship between higher caregiving stress\nand greater depression was much stronger than that ob-\nserved for women who were less satisfied with work. How-\never, it is important to note that overall, and especially for\nwomen with low levels of caregiving stress, work satisfac-\ntion did provide protective effects against increased depres-\nsion. Our findings suggest that it is the combination of\nbeing very satisfied with work and having high levels of\ncaregiving stress that is associated with particularly high\nlevels of depression.\nIt may be that women who are both satisfied with their\nwork and stressed by caregiving responsibilities are also\nmore depressed because of the conflict they perceive\nbetween these two roles. Experiencing greater job satisfac-\ntion may indicate that employment is more central to a\nwoman's self-concept. Having a job that is important or\nsalient to the self has been found to be associated with\nhigher levels of perceived work-family conflict (Greenhaus\net al., 1989). Women in our sample may have experienced\nnegative feelings because of perceived conflict between\ncaregiving and employment. In addition, the daily de-\nmands of these two roles may conflict. Research has\nshown that caregiving responsibilities can interfere with\nemployment through such means as increased absenteeism\nand work interruptions (e.g., Franklin, Ames, and King,\nespecially problematic for women who are highly satisfied\nwith their jobs.\nWe found stronger evidence for the direct effects of role\nsatisfaction than for its buffering effects. Satisfaction in\nboth caregiving and work was associated with greater\nwell-being. Regardless of the amount of stress experienced\nin caregiving and work, caregiving satisfaction predicted\nbetter physical health and positive affect, and work satisfac-\ntion was associated with greater well-being for all three\nwell-being measures. These findings extend previous re-\nsearch on the rewards of caregiving (Stephens, Franks, and\nTownsend, 1994) by showing that satisfaction in caregiving\ncan predict well-being past the effects of stress in that role\nand in the work role. In addition, these findings contribute\nto the literature on employed caregivers by showing that\nsatisfactions at work can be associated with caregivers'\ngreater well-being.\nExperiences at work appeared to have a stronger bearing\non caregiving than caregiving had on work. In contrast to\nthe moderating effects found for work involvement and\nwork satisfaction on the relationship between caregiving\nstress and well-being, no moderating effects were found for\ncaregiving involvement or caregiving satisfaction on the\nrelationship between work stress and well-being. Conceptu-\nalizing these interaction effects in terms of role spillover\n(e.g., Barnett, 1994), it can be concluded from these find-\nings that evidence was found for spillover from work to\ncaregiving but not from caregiving to work. It may be that\nthe women in this study were better able to keep caregiving\nexperiences from affecting work than they were able to\nkeep aspects of work from affecting caregiving. Other\nresearchers have found evidence for women's ability to\navoid spillover from the family domain to the work domain\nAlternatively, it is possible that other caregiving experi-\nences not examined as potential moderators in this study do\nin fact condition the effects of work stress, such as the\nimpairment of the older adult or the quality of the relation-\nship between the caregiver and her parent or parent-in-law.\nFinally, the sample size used in the present study may not\nhave allowed adequate statistical power to detect all hypoth-\nesized moderation effects, in particular those of smaller\nmagnitude (Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990).\nOne limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional\ndesign, which precludes the ability to rule out a different\ncausal ordering than that proposed. For example, it is possi-\nble that the relationship between caregiving stress and\ndecreased well-being for part-time workers occurred because\ncaregivers who were in poorer physical or mental health and\nwere more stressed from caregiving reduced the number of\nhours they worked. Although the literature on employed\ncaregivers indicates that some women reduce their work\nhours because of caregiving responsibilities (e.g., Brody et\nextent this may have occurred in our sample.\nAnother limitation of this study may be the generalizabil-\nity of the findings to other employed caregivers, given that\nrespondents were self-selected. On the one hand, the cur-\nrent sample may have been less stressed due to caregiving\nthan typical employed caregivers, given that these women\nhad the time available to participate in this study. On the\nother hand, the women in the sample may have participated\nbecause they were highly stressed by the experience of jug-\ngling these two roles and were looking for insight into their\nproblems. In order to increase the representativeness of the\nsample, caregivers were recruited through a variety of\nsources rather than relying on a single source of recruit-\nAlso, it is not known to what extent this sample is repre-\nsentative of employed women caregivers in terms of level\nof work involvement. The fact that three-quarters of our\nrespondents were employed full-time is consistent with\nnational figures for all employed women (U.S. Department\nof Labor, Women's Bureau, 1994), but no data are currently\navailable on the percentage of women caregivers who work\nfull-time. Although data from a national survey of informal\ncaregivers indicated that approximately three-quarters of\nemployed caregivers work full-time, both male and female\ncaregivers were included in this survey (American Associa-\ntion of Retired Persons and The Travelers Companies\nFoundation, 1988). Finally, it is not known to what extent\nthis study's findings would generalize to employed care-\ngivers with other ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds,\nin particular to employed caregivers with less education\nand fewer economic resources.\nThe present study extends previous research on em-\nployed caregivers and the general literature on work and\nfamily in several ways. First, rather than focusing on the\neffects of occupancy of the employment role, the present\nstudy identifies two particular aspects of work that can be\nbeneficial to caregivers' well-being. Second, in contrast to\nprevious research, which has shown the buffering effects of\nwork rewards on family stress, the present study demon-\nstrates that these relationships are more complex in the con-\ntext of caregiving. Taken together, the results of this study\nsupport the perspective that caregivers' other roles have the\npotential to enhance well-being or provide resources that\ncould buffer the impact of stresses associated with caregiv-\n"
