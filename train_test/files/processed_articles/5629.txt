The study aims to provide a review for the shifting paradigm through\nconcepts of internationalization in the literature review and to probe on the themes facing the GCC in their adaptation\nto internationalization. The study is based on secondary data, mainly of the websites of 167 universities/higher education\ninstitutions (HEIs) of GCC, which were analyzed for their adaptation to internationalization. The results show the various\nperspectives of internationalization with the suggestion on regional integration. It is hoped the study would provide the HEIs\nand the policy makers with a strong foundation on their internationalization efforts.\n",

This is because economic\nperformance is affected by the growing cross-border flows of\nknowledge, knowledge workers, and students (American\nCouncil on Education [ACE], 2009; Organisation for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2004;\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n[UNESCO], 2009). Studies based specifically on the interna-\ntionalization in the HE sector have been performed in numer-\nous regions of the world: Alamri (2011) in Saudi Arabia, Liu\nLiaghatdar, and Jafari (2011) in Iran, Mahani and Molki\nimportance given by researchers and reflects the respective\nnation's keenness to internationalize. Most of the studies on\ninternationalization dwell on the effect that the international-\nization process may have on the institutions, the models used\nby higher education institutions (HEIs) and the impact they\nhave, and the governance mechanism of the HEIs. A review\nof literature on the concurrent themes in the internationaliza-\ntion, however, shows no integration of themes in the process\nin the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. This study\ntherefore considers it of high importance to review the HE\nsector and raise awareness of the internationalization per-\nspectives prevalent here.\nAlthough universities have been international since\nancient times, globalization has brought in new contextual\nenvironments for the universities to operate in, and increas-\ningly, the universities the world over are trying to interna-\ntionalize their operations (Ahmed & Rao, 2011). Although\nscholars such as Knight (2004) consider internationalization\nand globalization to be different, other scholars consider that\nthe processes influence each other so much that the two can\nbe used interchangeably (Brandenburg & de Wit, 2011, in\nand multi-dimensional, for the purpose of our study, interna-\ntionalization will be assumed to mean the process of integrat-\ning international components into the HE system of a country,\na resultant of globalization.\nHE in the GCC region goes back to about 1,400 years ago\nwith the advent of Islam, beginning in Saudi Arabia, with\nMecca and Medina being the centers of knowledge as well as\n1Manipal University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates\nCorresponding Author:\nJulie Vardhan, Assistant Professor, School of Business, Manipal University,\nDubai.\nEmail: joulevardhan@gmail.com\nInternationalization and the Changing\nParadigm of Higher Education in the GCC\nCountries\nJulie Vardhan1\n Keywords\ninternationalization, higher education, GCC, regional integration, HEIs\n2 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

The last few decades, however, have\nseen a tremendous growth, both in the number of institutions\nand number of students in the GCC region. It is surprising,\ntherefore, that little research on internationalization of HE\neither through comparative data, case studies, or institutional\nexperiments has been conducted in this region. The author con-\nsiders it important to investigate the changing paradigm of the\nHE sector in the GCC, not just for advancement of knowledge\nbut also for institutions and policy makers to align their strate-\ngies according to the internationalization practices and trends.\nThe present study has been undertaken to examine the\ngrowth trajectory of the HE sector across all the countries in\nthe GCC region, the transition toward internationalization,\nquality initiatives undertaken, and movement toward regional\nintegration. The study aims to provide a contextual analysis\nand theoretical basis for the shifting paradigm as the implica-\ntions are important for GCC internationalization efforts.\nReview of Literature on\nInternationalization of HE\nThe literature describing trends and explaining aspects of HE\ninternationalization has been diverse. Internationalization of\nHE has been defined as \"The process of integrating an inter-\nnational, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose,\nfunctions or delivery of post-secondary education\" (Knight,\nprehensive, as apart from the modalities, the definition also\nintegrates an intercultural and international dimension into\nall areas of the university functioning. It particularly consid-\ners internationalization to be in response to globalization,\nalthough scholars such as Brandenburg and de Wit (2011) do\nnot find any marked difference as they consider both con-\ncepts to be interconnected. By considering this definition of\nHE internationalization, the broad themes underlying the\nconcept are now explored.\nA brief review of literature reveals three recurring themes\naround which studies have been conducted--one is about the\nprocess of internationalization (Hawawini, 2011; Mitra,\nHorta, 2009). This review follows the framework of process,\noutcomes, and governance to better understand the context\nof internationalization in HE, the characteristics of which\nhave been summarized in the Table 1.\nProcess in Internationalization of HE\nSince The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)\nhas recognized education as one of the services in the year\n2000, it has acted as an impetus for both HEIs and countries\nto trade internationally in HE. The process of international-\nization includes the various modes, modalities, and models to\ninternationalize. For instance the different modes in which\ntrade in education is allowed under GATS are Program mobil-\nity, Student mobility, Institution mobility, and Academic\n(2011) go on to explain that the HE sector's international mar-\nket foray is also similar to the \"classical\" sequence of multi-\nnational corporation (MNC) business entry: exporting,\nlicensing and franchising, joint ventures, and wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. They even employ strategic alliances and turn-\nkey projects. In this aspect, the sector undertakes the different\nstages of internationalization as any international business\nwould. The choice usually depends on the resource invest-\nments, management control, and risk/return attributes\n(Cateora & Graham, 2009). Each firm would decide on the\nchoice among exporting, licensing, or joint venture based on\nfirm-specific and market-specific factors that influence con-\ntrol, return, risk, and resources (Dunning, 1988). Specific to\nthe HE sector, there are studies that describe the mobility pat-\ntern in accordance with GATS or consider few \"models\" in\nHE. Hawawini (2011) mentions these five models: (a) the\nimport model, (b) the export model, (c) the academic joint-\nventure model, (d) the partnership model, and (e) the foreign-\ncampus model. These models are very similar to the\ninternational entry modes as mentioned by Dunning, and the\ninstitutions select the one they find most suitable for their\ninternational expansion. Another study by Mitra (2010) men-\ntions franchising, double or joint degrees, articulation mod-\nels, and distance education. Apart from the growing distance\neducation model through which a large populace even in\nremote areas could be reached, a new approach is the blended\nlearning. Sharafuddin and Allani (2012) and Jones and Lau\n(2010), while analyzing the system adopted by theArab Open\nUniversity in Kuwait, mention the advantage of combining\nthe e-learning with the traditional learning method to promote\nlearning outcomes. A growing trend is also that of collabora-\ntion and joint programs, as mentioned by Chen and Huang\n(2013) whose study on the development of internationaliza-\ntion of HE in China finds that apart from student mobility,\nthere are a number of joint programs and international coop-\neration and collaboration among HEIs and other universities\nand international organizations.\nAn interesting articulation of the internationalization of HE\nwas made by Beck (2012) conceptualizing it as an \"eduscape,\"\nwhich is about the flow of ideas, programs, activities, and\nresearch across national boundaries, but this flow is also influ-\nenced or intercepted with other \"scapes.\" These scapes have\nbeen described as \"ethnoscapes (the movement of people),\nmediascapes (how ideas about education are formed and influ-\nenced by the media), finanscapes (the movement of money in\npersonal lives, as well as nationally and internationally) and\nideoscapes (the manufacturing of ideas' about education)\"\n(2012), the eduscapes could be driven by either the finans-\ncapes or ethnoscapes or a combination of these scapes.\nOutcomes of Internationalization of HE\nAlthough the growing importance of internationalization of\nHE and its impacts on HE systems is dynamic in evolution, it\nis becoming more evident that the rationales that drive the\nprocess vary from region to region, country to country, or\neven between institutions that are themselves also evolving\n(Knight, 2008). The main outcome of the internationalization\nprocess seems to be at the national level, as countries would\nbe interested in developing their human capital, or developing\nknowledge workers for contributing to their economy.\nGhasempoor et al. (2011) list out the four rationales for inter-\nnationalization: the political, the academic, the cultural/\nsocial, and the economic. The national or political rationale is\nimplied through the studies of Knight (2004) and Ogachi\n(2009) and is also related to ideological influences a country\nmay have. The academic rationale is for achieving interna-\ntional standards for the institution, usually undertaken by the\ninstitutions to ensure high-quality global standards. The eco-\nnomic rationale is considered to be a direct response to the\nmarket forces aimed at developing revenue for the university\nwhile also developing human capital. However, there are\nnumerous studies that consider the cultural dimension or\nrationale to be the most important issue.Al-Semary,Al-Khaja,\nand Hamidou (2012), for instance, in their study describe the\nconcern of some authors (Grieco & Holmes, 1999) who con-\nsider internationalization to be a modern version of cultural\nimperialism with the western culture dominating and influ-\nencing the rest of the world and propose a cultural network\nmodel with \"Multidisciplinary Education.\" Altbach (2004)\nand Ahmed and Rao (2011) consider universities to be the\nnew age MNCs with the same motive for expansion--to gain\nmore market and earn more profit. Some scholars known for\npromoting internationalization have expressed caution over\nthis business and commercial approach in internationalization\nknowledge creation and dissemination:\nUniversities are seen to be forced into the market place in ways\nthat are reshaping them in their purposes and in the knowledge\nSome of the studies do provide an alternative way for\nnations and institutions to counter the commoditization of edu-\ncation: for instance, the study by Alfantookh and Bakry (2008)\nthat suggest that HE should become a public commodity with\nrights, access, and mobility for everyone internationally.\nWhatever the outcome considered by the institutions and the\nnation for the internationalization of its HE sector, one thing for\ncertain is that it helps in the advancement of knowledge and\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

The governance theory (Enders, 2004) pos-\ntulates that both state and non-state actors should participate\nequally in the governance of HE unlike the hierarchical model.\nHE, which was considered to be the domain of the state, is\nincreasingly opening to participation from private players. A\nstudy by Conner and Rabovsky (2011) corroborates the fact\nthat as state governments have faced increasing pressures to\nfund competing programs, and have endured difficult reces-\nsions that saw dramatic declines in state revenues, they are\nincreasingly finding it difficult to maintain support levels for\npublic institutions of higher learning. Another study on the\ninternationalization of HE in China by Liu and Dai (2012) con-\nsiders three concrete issues: the internationalization of curri-\ncula and teaching, of management, and of communication.\nWhereas the perspective on the internationalization of curricu-\nlum views the issue from the international background of facul-\nties, curriculum, and use of foreign language, the\ninternationalization of university management discusses about\nthe internal and external operating mechanisms.As internation-\nalization occurs at all levels of the university, exchange and\ncollaboration also occur at all levels. Three areas of exchange\nand cooperation are identified as academic research, collabora-\ntive education and exchange of teachers and students (Liu &\nDai, 2012). This can also be termed as glonacal that consists of\nintersections, interactions, and mutual determinations of global,\nnational, and local level in the HE (Marginson & Rhoades,\nlocal and the global tendencies to be blurred with each being\nthese views, Beck (2012) mentions the porousness of the\nboundaries between local and global, and the stretching of rela-\ntionships with the international study itself being a good exam-\nple of how global trends supersede and become local. The\ngovernance pattern may be inferred to be more influenced by\ninternationalization if the countries and institutions are more\nflexible to the effects and benefits of internationalization.\nHowever, most of the economies have developed their gover-\nnance mechanism for both public and private universities to\nmaintain standard and academic quality.\nMethodology of the Study\nThe present study has been undertaken to analyze the various\ntheories and schools of thought present in the literature of\nHE and its internationalization. The different, at times con-\ntrasting viewpoints, on internationalization in the HE show\nthat it is a much debated and researched topic in the aca-\ndemia. The present study, however, is not about arguing for\none proposition over the other or advocating another model\non outcomes, governance, and stages, but to suggest the\nimpact of internationalization in the GCC countries. Given\nthe objective of this research to review the phenomenon of\ninternationalization, this study uses secondary data for analy-\nsis, through a content analysis of the websites of the universi-\nties. When the data are to be used as evidence for a\nphenomenon under investigation, secondary data analysis\nwould be appropriate (Irwin, 2013). The content analysis\nprocess follows the stages as elaborated in the studies of\nSrnka and Koeszegi (2007) and Vaitkevicius and Kazokiene\n(2013) with ample modification because the unit of analysis\nfor the study is implicit in the websites of the universities.\nThe stages mentioned in these studies are as follows:\na. Data sourcing\nb. Transcription\nc. Data unitization\nd. Categorization\ne. Coding\nSample Size and Data Collection\nContent analysis is a very detailed and time-consuming pro-\ncess, and this places restrictions on the size of the final sam-\nple (Harris & Attour, 2003, in Sicilia, P\u00e9rez, & Heffernan,\n2008). However, as the objective of the study is the HE sec-\ntor in the GCC region, the study drew the sample from the\nofficial websites of the Ministry of Higher Education in each\nof the six countries. Furthermore, a total of 167 university\nwebsites from which data could be found were accessed for\ngathering information; their distribution is shown in Table 2.\nProcedure\nHwang, McMillan, and Lee (2003) in their study mention the\ncomplexity of website content analysis, much more than the\ntraditional media because of interconnectedness of individ-\nual pages and presence of information or units of analysis in\na number of pages.However, the websites are the most pow-\nerful tool for accessing information, hence this study chose\nthe websites for analysing the internationalization efforts in\nthe universities. The analysis of the 167 websites was\nrestricted to the English version of these websites as English\nis the international language most predominantly used.\nCorresponding to the third stage, requiring unitization was\nalso modified considerably as internationalization was\nimplicit through the website content. The various words,\nphrases, and texts that were used for the unitization purpose\nin the website were found to be \"international,\" \"global,\"\n\"international partnerships,\" \"international collaboration,\"\n\"worldrenowned faculty,\" and \"diverse students, multicul-\ntural.\" The period for accessing and unitization of the web-\nCoding Scheme\nThe present study is about the changing paradigm of the\nHEIs due to internationalization; therefore, the only category\nconsidered for the various unitization were the words or\nphrases mentioned earlier that were indicative of the \"inter-\nnationalization phenomenon\" and were coded as 1 to denote\nthe HEI being international. This scheme is based on the\nresearchers generally need to develop their own coding\nscheme for analyzing content.\nThe next section outlines the demographics that would\nfurther help in understanding the sector perspective in the\nGCC region, which is then followed by the observations of\nthe content analysis done on the HEI websites of the GCC\ncountries.\nReview of HE Sector in GCC\nDemographics of GCC\nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)\nwas established in 1981 by the leaders of the United Arab\nEmirates, The State of Bahrain, The Kingdom of SaudiArabia,\nThe Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, and The State of\nKuwait. The basic objective of the Cooperation Council is to\neffect cooperation, integration, and coordination among mem-\nber states, with education being one of the fields. The HE sec-\ntor in the GCC has been trying to keep up with the changes in\nthe globalized world, with the changes being at times radical\nand continuous, with each member country advocating and\nimplementing policies to advance growth of the sector.\nHowever, the Council countries, such as other countries in the\nworld, face a body of challenges imposed by new develop-\nments in the international scene, which can be summarized in\nglobalization, advanced technology, media openness, knowl-\nedge and information explosion, and economic and cultural\ncoalitions (Supreme Council Resolution on Education,\nof the region grew, the HE sector too witnessed a changing\npattern. According to reports by Alpen Capital (2010), the\ntotal students in GCC region is expected to grow at a\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 1.8% during\nexpected to grow at a highest CAGR of 5.5%. The share of\ntertiary education students is expected to rise from 11% in\nHE: Changing Paradigm Due to\nInternationalization\nWith the growing GDP and per capita in the region, the gov-\nernments are realizing the importance of developing human\ncapital for the economic growth to be sustainable. There are\nseveral reasons for this: changing demographics, the\nincreased number of secondary school pass-outs, wish for\ncontinual learning, and the growth of the information tech-\nGCC were studied for an understanding of their objectives\nand effort for internationalization. Among these, the year of\nestablishment for 145 universities was found. These were\nthen tabulated to understand the growth trend of the universi-\nties in the region and are depicted in Figure 1. Umm Al-Qura\nUniversity established in Mecca in 1949 is the first univer-\nsity in Saudi Arabia and also GCC to be established although\nKing Saud University established in 1957 is considered to be\nthe first HE provider as we know it today. Although most of\nthe GCC countries had one or two public universities, estab-\nlished prior to the nineties, it is only after the year 2000 that\nthe countries have shown a remarkable increase in the num-\nbers. Although a part of the growth trend can be attributed to\nthe rising population, it is not the only factor. As mentioned\nearlier, the rationale could vary from purely economic rea-\nsons of developing human capital to market reason of com-\npetition to creating global institutions or a combination of all\nof them. The growth in HE sector as seen through the increas-\ning number of HEIs in the GCC countries would bring\naround the theoretical concepts mentioned in the previous\nsection at varying degrees, sometimes intertwined and inter-\nmingled with each other.\nSaudi Arabia\nUAE\nQatar\nBahrain\nOman\nKuwait\nFigure1.

Compiled from university websites.\nNote. GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; HEIs = higher education\ninstitutions.\nProcess of Internationalization in GCC\nA look at the processes of internationalization in the GCC\nreveals the several modes, modalities, and models prevalent\nin the region. Citing Verbik and Lasanowski (2007), Ogachi\n(2009) outlines four categories of countries in the interna-\ntionalization process. The first category are the United States,\nthe United Kingdom, and Australia, considered the \"major\nplayers\" as they have some of the best universities and are\nEnglish speaking so students from all over the world seek\nthem. The second category is that of countries such as\nGermany and France, which attract students from neighbor-\ning countries and countries with socio-cultural or historical\nties. The third category is the evolving countries of Japan,\nCanada, and New Zealand, which have started attracting\nlast category is the \"emerging contenders\" that includes\nMalaysia, Singapore, and China. These countries have real-\nized the importance of global education and are spending\nresources toward developing \"world-class\" HE to effectively\ncompete in the global student market. The countries of the\nGCC from this description would fall in the fourth category.\nMoreover, a large population of the student community is\nalso moving to the first or second categories of countries\nseeking HE. For example, according to a report published at\nthe Saudi Ministry of Higher Education, Saudi Arabia is\nranked by UNESCO as the fourth country on the movement\nof the students around the world; SaudiArabia ranked behind\nthe United States in student movement around the world\nThrough the content analysis of the websites, it was ascer-\ntained if the university was a public university or a private\nuniversity, a public university being sponsored by the Federal\ngovernment of the respective countries. This was further\nchecked on the Ministry of Education websites of the coun-\ntries as they have a list of public universities and the accred-\nited private universities.\nThe second step in our content analysis was to find the\n\"international\" aspect of the universities, which was done\nthrough the following words or phrases considered as our\nunitization: \"international,\" \"global,\" \"international partner-\nships,\" \"international collaboration,\" \"worldrenowned fac-\nulty,\" and \"diverse students, multicultural.\" The findings\nhave been tabulated in Table 3.\nAs mentioned earlier, although it is difficult to ascertain\nthe main rationale for internationalizing, what is for certain\nis that most of the GCC countries have public and private\ninstitutions that are increasingly getting accreditations or\npartnerships with international universities so that their\ncourses are more acceptable internationally. Moreover, inter-\nnational universities establishing their campuses are also\nconsiderable in number in many of these countries. Among\nthe 167 universities and HEIs reviewed for the present study,\nthe number of private universities/institutions was 103.\nAmong these private universities, as many as 70 have either\npartnerships/collaborations with an international university\nor are branch campuses of international universities.\nThese countries have different stages of international col-\nlaborations with the majority of the source countries being\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the\nNetherlands, and India. These universities variously repre-\nsent the modes and mobility stages of internationalization,\nfor example, while Saudi Arabia with such large number of\nstudents going abroad is in the student's mobility stage, there\nare also a large number of students coming to its shore par-\nticularly for Islamic studies--thus showing both import and\nexport. UAE and Qatar are examples of countries that are at\nthe forefront of the \"branch campus model\" that alludes to\n\"institution mobility\" according to GATS. Oman and Kuwait\nwould be likely examples of the partnership model, with the\nuniversities developing programs affiliated to some foreign\nuniversities, and Bahrain follows the \"twinning model\"\nwhere the students study for a part of the program in the host\ncountry and another in the home country.\nRationale for Internationalization\nAlthough a study by Al-Yousif (2008) on the interaction\nbetween human capital and economic growth paints a mixed\npicture, the results vary according to countries. Moreover, the\ncausality between education and economic growth is a bidi-\nrectional one, refuting the existing literature showing causal-\nity from human capital to economic growth. Policy makers\nare hence focusing on developing the HE sector, investing in\ndeveloping hubs, increasingly seeking participation from the\nprivate sector and moving toward internationalization.\nOne of the reasons for the growing demand for the private\nuniversities and international partnership/collaboration is the\ngrowing population and the growing economy, although the\nexpansion and internationalization of HEIs should not be\nalluded to the \"youth bulge\" (Buckner, 2011, p. 22) but also\nexplicit policy changes on the part of governments to expand\nuniversity enrollments. Despite some areas of concern, as\nbuilding large-scale massification and commoditization of\neducation, and the concern about national values getting\neroded (Raven, 2011), most of the Gulf policy makers are\npromoting internationalization, hopefully balancing out the\ninternationalization efforts with efforts to integrate the\nnational and the local perspective, creating the \"glonacal\"\ndeterminants.\nGovernance Issues\nBuckner's (2011) analysis of the reforms initiated by the\nstates is classified into three major groups: Neoliberal,\nQuality Assurance, and Imported Internationalization, based\non the extent to which Arab States are privatizing the provi-\nsion of HE at different levels and the types of private institu-\ntions being established. The neo-liberal reforms, according\nto the study, aims to expand the access of HE while offsetting\ncosts to consumers and private sectors. This includes the\nestablishment of private universities, and programs that run\nthrough \"open learning\" or \"blended learning.\" The Arab\nOpen University in the GCC is an example of the open learn-\ning system. The second approach describes the initiative by\nthe state to develop quality assurance programs for all the\nstate and private universities. Increasingly, the countries of\nthe GCC are reforming their curricula to make them in line\nwith the needs of the modern world. Saudi Arabia, for\ninstance, over the years is trying to increase the non-Islamic\ncontent, is adopting English as the language of instruction,\nand is using the American system of semester and credit\nhours recognizing the demands of the modern economy\n(Rugh, 2002). The third model of HE policies pursued in the\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) Region according to\nthe study is that of Americanization, where the HE systems\nmodernize by establishing extensive partnerships with for-\neign universities. A number of scholars have examined how\nthese institutions are changing tertiary education in the UAE,\nQatar, Kuwait, and Saudi (Middle East Institute 2010).\nBuckner (2011) argues that although the Gulf States are\ninterested in founding a knowledge economy, the oil-rich\ncountries are more interested in creating a global image by\ninviting world-renowned universities in their established\nhubs rather than directly initiating quality initiatives for\nstate-run institutions. The examples of Qatar and UAE estab-\nlishing the Education City, Dubai International Academic\nCity, and Knowledge Village seem to be cases in point--\nthese hubs host institutions like the Northwestern University,\nCarnegie Mellon University, University of Wollongng,\nHeriot Watt of Scotland, Paris Sorbonne, NewYork Uniersity,\nand Insead. Although the academic standards of these inter-\nnational universities are very high, Stasz, Eide, and Martorell\ncentage of students actually qualify and enroll and the large\npercentage of the student population in all the GCC regions\nenroll in the public universities. They posit that this third\napproach to internationalization is more to do with bringing\nprestige and international acclaim to the Gulf States. A simi-\nlar view is proposed in the study by Al-Semary et al. (2012),\nwhich considers internationalization of HE to be the key\ntheme for GCC countries that are anxious to promote educa-\ntion as a symbol of modernity to their population as well as\nto the foreign countries.\nAn area of concern in the governance issues facing policy\nmakers and governments in this region is how to ensure qual-\nity for institutions that may be state-owned, privately owned,\nor international institutions that have set their campus in\nUNDPArab Human Development Report that considered the\npoor quality of education in Arab countries as \"the Achilles\nheel of education in the Arab world\" and called for radical\nreform of the education system. Although since then, the\nlandscape of HE has changed and as can be seen from the\nnumber of universities each country has and the reforms ini-\ntiated, each of the countries has also developed agencies to\nensure quality standards.\nOne of the ways to ensure quality standards throughout\nthe regions as well as adapt to internationalization is through\nregional integration. According to some studies (Ogachi,\ncooperation are able \"to improve the quality, relevance and\naccessibility, to facilitate transferability and comparability of\ndegrees among nations and to facilitate the mobility and\nemployability of students.\" A step in the GCC has been taken\ntoward regional integration with the development in 2007 of\nArab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education\n(ANQAHE) that was established with World Bank support.\nA solution could be to start with the harmonization of HE as\nsuggested by Woldegiorgis (2013) that is a process, not of\nstandardization but articulation, both horizontal and vertical,\n8 SAGE Open\nbetween programs and institutions among the HE systems of\nthe region. The author feels that regional integration of the\nGCC in the HE sector will pave the way forward towards a\nmore strategic decision in the internationalization process.\nConclusion, Limitation, and Future\nResearch\nAreview of literature on internationalization in the HE shows\nthree broad categories of theories--mainly related to the pro-\ncess, outcomes, and governance of internationalization.\nThese theories are based in different contextual environ-\nments, with oftentimes strong and contrasting viewpoints of\nthe authors. The present study has first summarized these\ntheories on the basis of their categories of process, outcomes,\nand governance and attempted to see the applicability of\nthese in the GCC region.\nThe first limitation of this study is regarding the method\nof content analysis, which can be constrained in its potential\nas it reports specific elements of a phenomenon (Kolbe &\nBurnett, 1991). The website content analysis also is limited\nby the changing nature of the source of data, namely, the\nSicilia et al. (2008) mention that the content and structure of\nthe pages may change since the research was conducted. This\nlimitation of the methodology making the result indicative in\nnature could be overcome through a longitudinal study in\nFuture research could also be based on a comparative analy-\nsis between regions of the developed and emerging econo-\nmies, and on finding the co-relation between the processes,\noutcomes, and governance.\nThe HE sector in GCC is at the forefront of creating a\nshift in the paradigm by advancing internationalization. The\nWorld Economic Forum for GCC considers education and\ninnovation as one of the themes in developing the scenario\nanalysis for 2025, and the way education policies are han-\ndled by the GCC governments will determine the regional\ninnovation and knowledge-based economy (Davis &\nHayashi, 2007). In spite of numerous challenges, there has\nbeen a considerable progress and recognition in the interna-\ntionalization of HE process in a short span of time in the\nGCC region.\nOur conclusions suggest the current trend of HE in GCC,\nthat highlights that the region offers a tremendous potential\nfor internationalization through the different outcomes, pro-\ncesses, and governance methods, which are present in vary-\ning degrees across the different countries of the region. It is\nhoped the study will provide a basis for future empirical\nresearch on these areas in this region and would help in fur-\nthering the internationalization efforts.\n"
