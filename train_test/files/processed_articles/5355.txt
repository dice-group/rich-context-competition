Across the globe, migration governance presents\nchallenges to multiple levels of authority; its complexity crosses many scales and involves\na multitude of actors with diverse interests. Despite this jurisdictional complexity,\nmigration remains one of the most staunchly defended realms of sovereign policy\ncontrol. Building on global social policy literature, this article examines how `domestic'\nlabour migration policies reflect the entanglement of multiple states' and agencies'\ninterests. Such entanglements result in what we characterize as a `multiplex system',\nwhere skilled-migration policies are formed within, and shaped by, globalized policy\nspaces. To illustrate, we examine policies that shape the nursing labour market in Oman\nduring a period when the state aims to transition from dependence on an expatriate to\nan increasingly nationalized labour force. Engaging a case-study methodology including\na survey of migrant healthcare workers, semi-structured interviews and data analysis,\nwe find that nursing labour markets in Oman represent an example of global policy\nformation due to the interaction of domestic and expatriate labour policies and\nprovisioning systems. The transnational structuring of policy making that emerges\nreflects a contingent process marked by conflicting outcomes. We contend that Oman's\nnursing labour market is an example of new spaces where global social policies emerge\nfrom the tension of competing national state and market interests.\nCorresponding author:\nCrystal A.

Global migration is one of the most prominent\nglobal social policy issues of the time, with over 250million people living outside of their\ncountry of birth. Over 38% of this stock is characterized as south\u00adsouth migrants, which\nnow exceeds south\u00adnorth migrant numbers (World Bank, 2016: 1). From South East Asia\nto Europe to the United States, migration governance presents challenges to multiple lev-\nels of authority. Its complexity crosses multiple scales and involves a multitude of actors\nwith diverse and often conflicting interests and realms of authority. Migration has been a\nkey feature of the global economy for centuries, yet international migration remains one\nof the most staunchly defended realms of sovereign policy control. We argue that in the\narea of skilled migration, we need to understand how globalization has informed global\nsocial policy with an eye to the heterogeneity of state and market entanglements and their\noutcomes in contexts marked by transnational engagements outside of core OECD (The\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) nations (Yeates, 2001).\nThe case of Oman demonstrates how skilled migrant labour market interactions are\nshaped by multilevel, interstate and regional state engagement processes, along with a\nmultiplicity of nonstate stakeholders all simultaneously engaged in some aspect of labour\npolicy while subject to differing levels of autonomy, regulation and control. In this arti-\ncle, we engage the word multiplex to denote the multiple agents (state and market based)\nthat are variably interconnected, generating intense complexity in this policy space (cf.\nWedel, 1998). The migration of nurses has previously been shown to be a realm of com-\nplex globalized multi-state and agency interactions (Kingma, 2006; Yeates, 2009). In the\ncase of Oman, the main actors include the governments of Oman and migrant sending\nnations (the Philippines in the context of this article), their relevant government minis-\ntries and Embassies, employers (public, private and hybrids of these), intermediaries that\nfacilitate migration, civil society and the expatriate and Omani workers themselves.\nGlobal social policy formation in the transnational political\neconomy of care\nPolicies that frame how international migrants are incorporated into overseas labour\nmarkets illustrate the `three R's of global social policy, redistribution, regulation, and\nrights' (Deacon and Stubbs, 2013: 6). In cases of feminized migration, such as nursing,\nwe also enter debates over the political economy of global care services (Yeates, 2009),\nwhich includes the dynamic movement of care labour, the nature of care commitments,\nthe movement of care capital, the type of care discourses that frame policies and how\nnon-governmental organizations (NGO) and social movements are influential in related\nsocial policy discussions taking place at different scales (Williams, 2011: 25). Our\nargument supports the idea that public policies are formed within \u00ad and their outcomes\nshaped by \u00ad globalized policy processes, `complex multilateralism' and transnational\nnetworks that represent a `mechanism of global public policy'(Stone, 2008: 34, 35). This\nargument also emerges in global social policy approaches that explore `the complexities\nof the actions of transnational, international and global actors within national and regional\nspaces' (Deacon and Stubbs, 2013:11). Our article adds context and empirical flesh to\nthis conceptual framework.\nSpecifically, we examine how nursing labour markets in the Sultanate of Oman rep-\nresent an example of global social policy formation due to the interaction of domestic\nand expatriate labour provisioning systems, resulting in the transnational integration of\nmultiple national policy processes. We contend that Oman's nursing labour market pro-\nvides an example of `new public spaces where global policies occur' (Stone, 2008: 19)\nand how `key policy players are transcending \"levels\" at any one moment' (Deacon and\nplicity of actors \u00ad economic agents such as transnational corporations (TNCs), national\nstates and various national and local interests \u00ad interact in various ways, at various levels,\nand with various outcomes, none of which are predetermined' (p. 87).\nA multitude of policies frame nursing labour market formation globally (Kingma,\n2006), but in Oman a gendered political economy structures nursing markets in interest-\ning ways. Similar to its Gulf neighbours, Oman's economy has been heavily reliant on\nhydrocarbons and foreign labour, but as demographic and economic conditions change,\nOman faces the need to transition from a rentier state serviced by expatriate workers, to a\ncountry engaged in educating and promoting the employment of its population (Zerovec\nand Bontenbal, 2011). During this transition, the `Gulf paradox' has emerged of labour\nmarkets with increasing numbers of non-nationals, while nationals (particularly young\npeople and women) experience increasing rates of unemployment. In Oman's nursing\nsector, this labour market complexity includes the interaction of nationalization and\nskilled-migration labour policies. We examine this complexity in the following three sec-\ntions. First, we provide an overview of our methodological approach and research meth-\nods. Second, we make the case for Oman's nursing labour market as a space for global\nsocial policy formation, and we organize this in four subsections. The first subsection\nexamines health care and health labour governance in Oman. The second highlights\nlabour recruitment and workplace processes arranged between Oman and the Philippines\n\u00ad a key supplier of nursing labour to Oman \u00ad while paying attention to some of the key\nplayers and the means by which they engage. The third provides more detail of the multi-\nplex nature of the nursing labour market by examining its gendered political economy.\nThe fourth examines the actors involved in policy interaction in Oman and how this con-\ntributes to the generation of global social policy. In the final section, we review how\nunderstanding the multiplex space of Oman's nursing labour market, with the contingent\nand contested interactions involved, illustrates a mode of global social policy formation.\nResearch methods\nWe employ a methodological transnationalism approach by foregrounding the nature of\ncross border links, structure and agency in order to overcome territoriality and the\nconflation of state, society and territory (Amelina et al., 2014: 11). Transnational analysis\nreveals how care migration policies are co-determined by actors operating beyond or\nacross their national borders, thereby illustrating the value of methodological transna-\ntionalism during a period of increased global care migration (Yeates, 2014b).\nMethodological transnationalism thus escapes the tendency of analysis to begin and end\nwith the nation, thereby revealing how global social policy is increasingly being formed\nat scales beyond the nation, for example, through regional collaborations such asASEAN\n(Yeates, 2014a). Thus, we engage a methodological transnational approach to reveal\noverlapping nascent informal inter-regional networks that shape and inform migration\nand labour market regulation in Oman.\nTo address the complexity evident in Oman's nursing labour market, and to develop\nour interpretation of its construction as evidence of a form of global social policy, we\nutilized a range of research methods and forms of data collection. Using an online survey\ndeveloped in consultation with colleagues at the Centre for Development Studies in\nIndia, we gathered data from expatriate nurses in Oman. The survey results demonstrate\nthe interaction of labour and migration policy through the lived experience of healthcare\nworkers in Oman. The research also entailed three field visits to Oman by Ennis in 2014\nand 2015. Eventually, after promoting the online survey though our connections with\nnetworks in Oman, we gathered 25 responses from nurses working in Oman, 23 from the\nPhilippines and 2 from India. For the purposes of this article, we consider only the\nPhilippine respondents. We also conducted seven key informant interviews in Oman,\nincluding subsequent telephone calls and multiple informal (off-the-record) meetings\nwith government officials from both Oman and the Philippines and with Omani nurses.\nThe analysis was further supplemented with secondary data evaluation and review.\nOman's nursing labour market as a space for global social\npolicy formation\nSituated on the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean,\nOman's embeddedness within migration flows in the region has deep historical roots. It\nhas been integrated into the Indian Ocean economy for generations (Chaudhuri, 1985).\nIn the current period, there are multiple layers and sites of authority which intersect in\ncomplicated ways to govern the flow of migrants into the nursing labour market and their\nlabour within it.\nThe contemporary governance of migration in Oman, like other parts of the Arab\nGulf, is connected to the neoliberalizing tendencies of global capital, with labour flows\nserving the demands of global capitalism and global production networks. Long-standing\nlabour demand patterns in hydrocarbon-dependent Gulf economies have produced a\nstrong dependence on foreign labour. Demand for service labour is a regular feature of\nrentier economies where the growing consumption needs of the national middle class\nmanifests itself in highly segmented labour markets that selectively draw from interna-\ntional supplies of low-, semi- and high-skilled labour.\nOver 60% of Oman's workforce is non-national whose residence in the country is tied\nto their work contract (Census, 2010). Globalized migration in Oman is distinguished by\na lack of integration and citizenship and is structured by the kafala (sponsorship) system\nwhich binds the migrant to their employer (Sater, 2014). Irrespective of skill level, eco-\nnomic migrants in Oman remain legally temporary despite their frequent longevity or\neven generational presence in the country. The temporariness of the expatriate experi-\nence, even when a lifetime of work is conducted in the country, impacts the relationship\nof the individual with their host country, their home country and their work more broadly.\nThis tension is exacerbated in lived experiences of long term, yet temporary migrants\neven when those migrants are highly skilled. A sense of impermanence and limit to rights\non belonging contribute to the circular production of insecurity, which in turn influences\nhow sending countries manage outward migration and their diplomatic relations with\nOman.\nOne of the key policies aimed at trying to reduce Oman's dependence on foreign\nworkers is Omanization, a labour localization programme aimed at promoting the\nemployment of citizens through quota systems, training initiatives and other incentive\nschemes (Ennis and Al-Jamali, 2014: 6). It is an economy-wide policy which was born\nof necessity, geared towards employment burden sharing when oil revenues were low,\nbut meeting limited success in the private sector. Despite government plans since the late\n1980s to reduce the number of foreigners in the workforce, expatriate numbers have\nincreased and even surged in the last decade (National Centre for Statistics and\nInformation [NCSI], 2010\u00ad2013). Only the recent oil price crash seems to be dampening\nthis trend. Although the Omani government has been successful in its efforts to reduce\nthe reliance on expatriates in the government, public education and the banking sectors,\nmost others, especially in the private sector, remain dominated by expatriates.\nSince Omanization is a state-led initiative, it is not surprising that the public sector has\nled the way in increasing the share of Omani employees. The private sector, on the con-\ntrary, has proven more resistant to Omanization. Business actors maintain a preference\nfor less expensive, more flexible workers in the low-skilled sector and in high-skilled\nforeign labour. Data from 2015 show that 81% of expatriates working in the Sultanate\nwork in the private sector, whereas only 4% work in the public sector and 15% are\ntrend continues despite policy efforts to encourage a stronger national presence in the\nprivate sector workforce. Policy levers competing for government attention include the\npressures of global competitiveness, on one hand, and the need to protect the domestic\nworkforce, on the other. Gulf States have therefore been caught between `the aspirations\nof the modernist welfare state and the goals of capital accumulation' (Al-Shehabi, 2015:\n25). The desire for a modernist welfare state is well illustrated by Oman's efforts to pro-\nvide improved health care.\nHealth care and health labour governance in Oman\nThere have been drastic improvements in health care across the Sultanate since the\n1970s. A change in head of state in 1970 coincided with a sudden influx of export earn-\nings following the 1973 oil embargo. These incidents marked the beginning of a new\nimpetus for improving development indicators across the country, including those in\nhealth, and meeting the aspirations of capital accumulation alongside enhanced welfare\nprovision. In 1975, the total number of nurses across Oman was 450. This increased to\n123). Alongside this, investment in education became a major component of improving\nhealthcare provision nation-wide. Medical education only began in Oman in 1986 when\nthe College of Medicine and Health Sciences was established at Sultan Qaboos University\nmedical training. As in other sectors, the rapid demand for healthcare provision meant\nhealthcare workers had to be hired from abroad while simultaneously increasing the\nnumber of locals educated in the health field.\nA similar pattern transpired in many sectors of the economy, where labour was\nimported to fill a numerical and skill shortage. As the population grew and income levels\nrose, demand for labour also increased, especially in services. During the oil price decline\nand economic stagnation of the late 1980s and 1990s, it became clear to policy makers\nthat mechanisms were required to encourage Omani citizens to work in a wider array of\nfields and especially in the private sector, thereby reducing the reliance on expatriates.\nSince the 1990s, concerted efforts by the government to educate and train Omanis in\nhealth care have resulted in significant changes. When the term Omanization came into\ncommon use in the early 1990s, Omanis were not well represented in the healthcare sec-\ntor. Despite significant improvements, the ambitious Omanization goals laid out in 1995\nin the long-term development strategy Oman Vision 2020, and in subsequent 5-year\ndevelopment plans, have not been reached. According to the Omanization of Health\nManpower Plan 2006, the MOH expected the nursing category to be 100% Omanized by\n2015. MOH suggested this could happen if the Ministry had the ability to distribute nurs-\ning graduates across various governorates according to need.\nAlthough institutions managed by the MOH have had the most success in localizing\nthe nursing workforce (see Tables 1 and 2), none of the governorates have reached 100%\nOmani employment. Such policy goals were too ambitious from the outset, given popu-\nlation numbers and distribution across the regions, as well as local social norms associ-\nated with female employment. As in other areas of the economy, public sector health\ninstitutions have been more successful than private sector ones, which are largely for-\neign-managed. In fact, Omanis only comprise 5% of the nursing staff in private health-\ncare facilities. In contrast, Omani employees comprise 66% of all MOH institutions,\nranging from 6% in the remote region ofAl-Wusta to 91% inAl-Dhahirah. Outside of the\ncapital area, the higher number of Omani nurses appears to reflect the presence of\nMOH Public\nnon-MOH\nPrivate Total MOH Public\nnon-MOH\nPrivate Total\nMOH: Ministry of Health.\nregional nursing educational institutes, with Al-Sharqiyah, Al-Batinah and Al-Dhahirah\nhome to several nursing institutes (MOH, 2013).\nTo compensate for the lack of local nursing graduates, Oman's expansion of health\nservices depended upon the use of expatriate nurses, the majority coming from India and\nthe Philippines. Between 2007 and 2011, the number of new Filipino hires deployed to\nOman doubled, and by 2015, Oman was among the top 10 destinations for Philippine\noverseas workers (POEA, 2011, 2015). Notwithstanding these increases, the ambitious-\nness of Omanization plans in the healthcare sector alarms some foreign nurses in the\ncountry and adds to their sense of precarity and worry. The policy of Omanization effec-\ntively intensifies the vulnerability embedded in Oman's migration labour policy, since it\nenhances migrant insecurity even while migrant workers are still needed in the sector.\nSurvey results indicate that 60% of respondents were worried about Omanization forcing\nthem out of their job:\nYes, especially when you are already over age to transfer to other counties for work (Survey\nEven if you have specialized here with so many years of experience, they can easily take you\nout even with exemplary work performance. Then you will be left unemployed (Survey\nOur respondents assess their vulnerability within a transnational field of options, because\nthey understand losing a job in Oman means they would have to find employment in\nanother country, as opposed to merely returning home:\nBecause if Omanization will push through, I have to look for another country that will offer me a job\nThe failure of the Philippines to offer some kind of return options to nurses interacts with\nthe Omanization policy to enhance the sense of precarity. Even if migrants are allowed\nTable 2. Omanization level of nurses in Ministry of Health Institutions by region, 2012.\nGovernorate Omanization (%)\nSouth Al-Sharqiyah 85\nNorth Al-Sharqiyah 74\nAl-Wusta 6\nto continue to work in Oman, the Omanization processes were interpreted through con-\ncerns over possible changes in workplace controls and hierarchy:\nThey [Omanis] will be the head of every group. And it will depend on the attitude of that Omani\nif he or she will not discriminate his or her colleagues, especially expatriates (Survey response\nNotwithstanding these concerns, 40% of survey respondents were not overly worried\nabout Omanization. Some seemed confident that their work ethic and willingness to\nwork longer hours than Omani nursing staff would help secure their employment:\nSome work schedules cannot be catered by Omanis, so they need expatriates to do the work\nThese comments suggest that Omanization can work as a social policy of control over\nlabour even when it has effectively `failed' to fully nationalize the labour force in ques-\ntion. The reality of this failure was evident in the responses of several participants, who\nreported a visible increase in the number of foreign healthcare professionals in Oman\nsince 2011. This corresponds with the recorded annual increases in the number of non-\nnationals added to the labour market and general decline in the level of Omanization\n(NCSI, 2010\u00ad2013). In one interview with a Philippine nurse who had been in Oman for\nnearly a decade, he claimed,\nIt used to be about 50/50 expats/locals in the hospitals. The government is doing a good job\ninvesting in local people to work in this field. Sure, there are some work or quality issues, but\nit is developing. We used to be worried about Omanization taking over, but not now. A strange\nthing happened in the last three years. In all the hospitals, the number of expatriates shot up.\nRecruitment has been very high, and now we are more than the locals. (19 June 2014)\nPhilippine Embassy staff noted a similar perception, expecting numbers of Philippine\nnurses to continue increasing. MOH (2015: 12) data confirm a decline in Omanization\nlevels from 2010 to 2015. Embassy staff seemed to believe that there was an increasing\ndemand for Filipinos in Oman because they were deemed more qualified and better\ntrained. As much as Oman may want to nationalize the labour force in health care, these\ntrends suggest there remains a need for well-trained expatriate labour within the Omani\nhealthcare sector. This intersection of healthcare service demands, training and staffing\nneed, and the effectiveness of regional migrant labour provisioning systems suggests\nlabour nationalization policies will not be fully achieved for some time. Despite this, the\nmere presence of an Omanization policy can be considered to do the work of regulating\nmigrant labour by maintaining a sense of insecurity even as the number of expatriates\nrecruited increases.\nGendered political economy of the nursing labour market in Oman\nIn the case of Oman, as with many Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, the issue\nof gender norms and patriarchal governance is profoundly relevant to the operation of the\nlabour market and how social policy is imagined and achieved in practice. Contrary to\nstereotypes, women in the Gulf graduate from universities and other higher educational\ninstitutes at higher rates than men (Al-Nasr, 2011: 43, 46). However, high youth unem-\nployment rates characteristic of the region disproportionately impact women (OECD\n2014: 43\u00ad44). Despite significant investment in education and health, and despite devel-\nopment indicators (such as female education, fertility and life expectancy) that favoura-\nbly compare to other regions, women's labour force participation remains low. This is\nwhat the World Bank (2004) has labelled the `gender paradox' in the Middle East.\nNotwithstanding this so-called paradox, societal norms in the Gulf states around wom-\nen's role in society `drastically transformed'over the last generation (Al-Nasr, 2011: 44).\nFemale participation in the Omani labour force has expanded significantly in the past\nGCC governments that seek to promote the education and employment of their\nnational labour force must reconcile the abnormal national/non-national segmented char-\nacteristic of Gulf labour markets, and the concomitant gender imbalances that result,\nwith the necessity to facilitate the integration of national women into the labour market.\nWith a majority of workers in the private sector being non-national and male, female\nemployment in this sector remains difficult. Nursing, however, is globally a feminized\nprofession.\nThe internationalization of the healthcare labour force interacts with nursing's gen-\ndered and insecure occupational status (Nelson and Gordon, 2004). This professional\nmarginalization is evident in many parts of the Middle East, where `nurses are consid-\nered maids for patients and assistants for physicians' (Al Jarallah et al., 2009: 70). To\nfurther add to this complexity, the actual autonomy of female nurses \u00ad working with\nunrelated men, sometimes at night and engaged in `body work' that demands touch and\npersonal care \u00ad challenges the gender norms of socially conservative societies (El-Hadad,\n2006). The ambiguous status of the nursing profession means that in Oman `the majority\nof students entered into nursing as their last choice of preferences' (Al-Riyami et al.,\n2015: 464). Increased university level training has, however, boosted the desirability of\nthe profession for young Omanis (Al-Riyami et al., 2015). In fact, Omani nurses spoken\nwith during this research suggested that nursing was their top choice. This may be partly\nconnected to the expectation of a de facto guaranteed job after graduation; Omanization\nrates are higher in areas with higher local unemployment (Table 2). Here, many local\nTable 3. Female labour force participation (percentage of female population aged 15+years).\nwomen work as nurses, since labour demand outpaces supply and employment opportu-\nnities mean Omani nurses can find jobs rather quickly after graduation.\nNursing, especially in the public sector, is slowly emerging as an appropriate field for\nOmani women. In 2013, women represented 81.6% of the current students enrolled in\ngovernment hospital, and nurse for over 12 years, believed the biggest problems facing\nher hospital were staff shortages and high levels of Omani staff turnover (interview, 11\nJanuary 2015). She felt that low pay, long hours and limited opportunity for promotion\ndiscouraged Omani nurses from staying in one hospital for a long time. Interviewees also\nsuggested that many male Omani nurses do not remain in patient care for long, preferring\ninstead to shift to administrative roles, a pattern that is evident for male nurses generally\nNational nurses in Oman support the Omanization process, but have expressed concern\nabout replacing experienced expatriate nurses too rapidly with inexperienced and poorly\ntrained national nurses (Al-Riyami et al., 2015). The supervisor mentioned above expressed\nthis sentiment as well. She was worried about the level of experience of new graduates\ncoming in and wished administrators would not replace the more experienced, and more\nexpensive, expatriates with fresh graduates. The multiple interests and complexities at\nwork in this realm of social policy making are clearly articulated in this case. While Oman\nhas a stated interest in boosting the employment of female nationals, gendered expectations\nand poor conditions of nursing employment undermine the profession's acceptability and\nlimit its capacity to attract and retain locals. The demands made of the healthcare sector and\nthe recognition of skills and expertise, meanwhile, protect migrant workers as key actors in\nthis sector. The perceived threat of Omanization, however, can still operate to control\nmigrant workers and contain demands for improved conditions.\nLabour recruitment and workplace experience between Oman and the\nPhilippines\nHealth labour force policy in Oman is informed by policy frameworks originating in\nboth Oman and health professional migrant source regions. This is a clear example of\nglobal social policy making since multiple states and agents become enmeshed in the\nprocess of migrant worker provisioning to service Oman's needs. Oman's MOH has\nguidelines for international staffing requests, whereby hospitals should bring staff short-\nage issues to the attention of their board, and if no internal staff can be found, submit a\nstaffing request to the appropriate MOH divisions, in this case the Directorate General of\nNursing Affairs and the Undersecretary for Health Affairs. National nurses should be\nsought first, and if this fails to satisfy the demand, then the DG of Nursing Affairs sub-\nmits advertisements in consultation with the concerned MOH authorities. Recruitment\nagencies in nursing source countries like India and the Philippines respond to such adver-\ntisements and liaise with employers (MOH, 2003, MOH Website). Although Oman and\nthe Philippines do not have a bilateral labour agreement, Oman uses licenced private\nrecruiters in the Philippines, a leading source supplying trained nurses to overseas mar-\nkets, to fulfil staffing requirements (Pittman, 2016). Using licenced recruiters is sup-\nposed to be a safeguard against recruiter exploitation, but in practice is no guarantee.\nThese recruiters are licenced through the Philippines Overseas Employment\nAdministration (POEA), which regulates recruitment, implements and develops pro-\ngrammes and policies linked to migrant worker recruitment, accredits foreign employ-\ners, documents overseas foreign workers, adjudicates recruitment conflicts, as well as\nnegotiates bilateral agreements. The Philippines ...\nhas a vast, transnational migration bureaucracy through which it facilitates out-migration\n[through] four key functions: (i) authorization (by processing i.e. visas and passports of\nmigrants), (ii) predeparture skills training, (iii) marketing (advertising migrants to prospective\nemployers), and (iv) conducting `marketing missions' (bilateral negotiations with labour-\nWhen the Philippines does development bilateral labour agreements, it is based on\nextensive public\u00adprivate agreements structured to provide support for migrant workers\nwhile meeting the development needs of the source and destination country (Rivera\net al., 2013). Indeed, migration from the Philippines is emblematic of a labour export\nmodel that is driven and orchestrated by what Rodriguez (2010) calls the `labour broker-\nage state'. Various actors play their role in this migration process to create `ideal migrant\nsubjects' who embody the goals and objectives of migration as a development tool (pri-\nmarily through the remittance process). Workers from the Philippines are `desired'\nemployees in Oman because they are perceived as well educated, well spoken (good\nEnglish skills) and `clean'(Philippine Embassy official, 18 June 2015, author interview).\nThe state and private intermediaries play a role in generating these migrant subjectivities\nduring the migrant cycle, which includes `extraterritorial interventions in contractual\ndisputes'(Rodriguez and Schwenken, 2013, 381). Extending such rights normalizes emi-\ngration with the promise of `some degree of protection' overseas (Rodriguez and\nThe Philippines government currently requires a minimum wage of 160 OMR\n(US$415) for general employment. This is feasible because the minimum wage set in\nOman only applies to citizens. This stipulation also makes Philippine nationals more\nexpensive relative to other labour-rich countries, which seems to contribute to percep-\ntions of value and therefore increase demand for Philippine workers.

Salary is thus an example of deter-\nritorialized labour market regulation in Oman that differentiates betweenAsian migrants.\nThe politics of nationality also plays a role in perceptions of job security, promotion\nand employee relations. Language can at times perform a crucial role here. Language is\na tool that can be used by individuals to make conversations, and by extension knowl-\nedge and learning opportunities, exclusive to a particular group. This can impact nation-\nals and non-nationals in various ways. For instance, Omani nurses report feeling the need\nto fight for patient care to be discussed in English so all parties could participate, not just\ndoctors and nurses from particular language groups. Conducting work-related matters in\na foreign language (such as that of the expatriate workers) excludes non-speakers from\nthe opportunity to contribute or to learn. This simultaneously marginalizes nationals and\nsecuritizes knowledge and jobs for certain expatriate groups. The transnational nature of\nthe labour market also creates vulnerabilities for migrants in terms of contract translation\nissues. A few expatriate research participants report signing contracts or other documents\nin Arabic, without understanding the contents. Media, government edicts and other\nreports on labour market regulation released in Arabic also cause concern. These are\noften poorly translated or misinterpreted in English press coverage, resulting in miscom-\nmunication, information asymmetries and escalated concern over job security or employ-\nment conditions and benefits. The language politics of these combined practices,\nexperiences and perceptions thus contribute (unintentionally or otherwise) to feelings of\nexclusion and paranoia on both sides. Where Omani nurses worry about opportunities for\nlearning and improvement, expatriate nurses worry about job security. We therefore\nunderstand labour market regulation as resulting from the interactional effect of labour\nexport and labour market segmentation effects at various scales.\nOur survey results indicate that for expatriate workers there is a general sense of\nunease and raw "
