We hypothesized\nthat insulin resistance rather than diabetes status may be a\nprimary factor involved in gallstone formation. A total of 5,653\nadult participants in the third United States National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey without known diabetes\nunderwent gallbladder ultrasonography and phlebotomy\nafter an overnight fast for measurement of serum insulin,\nC-peptide, and glucose.

An association of oral\ncholecystography or ultrasound-documented gallbladder dis-\nease with diabetes mellitus was found in some2-8 but not\nall9-11 population-based epidemiological studies, and the\nstrength of its association varied markedly across studies.\nAlthough the negative findings of some studies may have\nbeen because of limitations in design or statistical power,\nanother possible explanation for this variation is that the\ninsulin resistance that characterizes most persons who de-\nvelop non\u00adinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may be a\nprimary factor involved in gallstone formation. A role for\ninsulin in gallbladder disease has been suggested by case-\ncontrol studies12-15 and by population-based studies of clini-\nHyperinsulinemia is characteristically found in persons\nwith non\u00adinsulin-dependent diabetes as a result of insulin-\nresistance, which is considered of primary importance in\ndiabetes pathogenesis. Fasting insulin can be used as a\nsurrogate measure of insulin resistance and has been shown\nto correlate with whole-body glucose uptake measured by\neuglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in persons with normal\nglucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and non\u00ad\ninsulin-dependent diabetes.20 For a given concentration of\nglucose, insulin increases with increasing insulin resistance.\nBecause approximately 50% of insulin is metabolized on first\npassage through the liver, serum insulin level is a poor\nmeasure of hepatic insulin exposure. Equimolar quantities of\ninsulin and C-peptide are secreted by the pancreas into the\nportal vein, but unlike insulin, C-peptide is negligibly ex-\ntracted by the liver. Thus, the serum C-peptide level more\naccurately reflects insulin secretion and delivery to the liver\non its first passage. We examined the relationship of gallblad-\nder disease with fasting serum insulin and C-peptide in a\nlarge, national, population-based study. We also investigated\nwhether diabetes was associated with gallbladder disease\nindependently of insulin and C-peptide levels.\nThe third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) was conducted in the United States from 1988\nthrough 1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. It consisted of inter-\nview, examination, and laboratory data collected from a complex\nmultistage, stratified, clustered probability sample of the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population age 2 months and older, with\nover-sampling of the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-\nAmericans.21 The study was approved by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention Institutional Review Board and all partici-\npants provided signed consent to participate.\nAbbreviations: NHANES III, third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; PR, prevalence ratio.\nFrom the 1Social and Scientific Systems, Inc.

The sample for this study consisted of\nbe examined in the morning at a mobile examination center after an\novernight fast. Excluded were persons who were interviewed, but\nwho were assigned to a morning examination, but attended in the\n24 or more (n  9) hours or whose fasting time was unknown (n \n108), who did not undergo a gallbladder ultrasound (n  93) or\nwhose gallbladder lumen could not be adequately visualized on\nultrasound (n  14), who had missing data on fasting glucose,\ninsulin, or C-peptide levels (n  178), pregnant women (n  107),\nand persons with diagnosed diabetes (n  325). Persons with\ndiagnosed diabetes were excluded because they were not asked to\nfast. Persons with diabetes identified on NHANES III, but not\npreviously diagnosed, were included in all analyses.\nGallbladder disease was defined as ultrasound-documented gall-\nstones or evidence of cholecystectomy by standard criteria.1 Based\non videotaped recordings of ultrasound examinations, there was\nexcellent agreement on gallbladder disease diagnosis between the\nultrasonographer and reviewing radiologist (agreement of 99% with\nGlucose-Related Risk Factor Variables. A fasting venous blood sam-\nple was collected and plasma glucose, serum insulin and C-peptide,\nand glycated hemoglobin levels were measured.22 Plasma glucose\nwas measured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method\n(Roche Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Montclair, NJ), serum insulin and\nC-peptide were measured by radioimmunoassay (Pharmacia Diagnos-\ntics AB, Uppsala, Sweden, and Bio-Rad Laboratories, Anaheim, CA,\nrespectively), and glycated hemoglobin was measured using high-\nperformance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Her-\ncules, CA) at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO.\nAs defined by American Diabetic Association criteria, normal fasting\nglucose was 110 mg/dL, impaired fasting glucose was between 110\nCovariates. Data were collected on known or possible gallbladder\ndisease risk factors, including age, sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, other), body mass\nindex (BMI) (weight in kg/height in m2), waist-to-hip circumference\nratio, serum total cholesterol level (mg/dL), cigarette smoking\n(never, former, less than one pack per day, one or more packs per\nday), alcohol consumption (never, former, less than one drink per\nday, one to two drinks per day, more than two drinks per day), and,\nfor women, number of live births. A physical activity intensity\nvariable was created by summing the products of activity frequency\nin the previous month and an intensity rating for 9 activities\n(walking, jogging or running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, danc-\ning, calisthenics, gardening or yard work, weight lifting).\nStatistical Analysis. We examined the relationship between gallblad-\nder disease and insulin-related factors by first calculating gallbladder\ndisease prevalence estimates for each level of the factors. To control\nfor the effects of other covariates related to gallbladder disease, we\ncomputed adjusted gallbladder disease prevalence estimates using\nbinary linear regression analysis.24 Prevalence was estimated by least\nsquares means computed using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC).25 Adjusted\ngallbladder disease prevalence ratios were then calculated by compar-\ning prevalence at each higher level of factors with prevalence at the\nlowest level; P values for trend in adjusted prevalence were\ncomputed. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women.\nAll covariates that had previously been found to be associated with\ngallbladder disease (P  .1) in the entire NHANES III sample with a\ngallbladder ultrasound (N  13,962) were included in final models.\nGlucose was included as a continuous variable in models of insulin\nand C-peptide. A 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not include\none (P  .05) was considered to indicate statistical significance. All\nanalyses incorporated sample weights, stratification, and clustering\nusing SUDAAN software.25\nRESULTS\nundiagnosed diabetes. Among men 2,281 had normal fasting\nundiagnosed diabetes. Mean insulin levels (SE) in pmol/L\ndiffered in persons with normal fasting glucose, 57 (1),\nimpaired fasting glucose, 96 (6), and undiagnosed diabetes,\nGallbladder disease prevalence in women is shown in Table\n1. In univariate analysis, a higher gallbladder disease preva-\nlence was seen with impaired fasting glucose and undiag-\nnosed diabetes (P  .001). Higher fasting serum insulin and\nC-peptide levels were associated with increased gallbladder\ndisease prevalence (P  .001). Among women, in multivari-\nate analysis controlling for covariates, persons with undiag-\nnosed diabetes had an over 90% higher prevalence of\nTABLE 1.

Fasting insulin-to-C-\npeptide ratio was associated in univariate (P  .001), but not\nin multivariate analysis (P  .30) (data not shown). Glycated\nhemoglobin level was associated with gallbladder disease in\nunivariate analysis when women with levels in the highest 5%\nwere compared with those with lower levels (95%) (P \n.001). No association was found in multivariate analysis (P \n.15) (data not shown).\nIn men, impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes\nwere associated with increased risk of gallbladder disease in\nunivariate analysis (P  .006) (Table 2). Associations with\ninsulin and C-peptide in univariate analysis were primarily\napparent when the highest quintile was compared with the\nlowest. No associations of gallbladder disease with insulin\nand C-peptide in men were significant in multivariate analy-\nses after controlling for covariates and fasting glucose (Table\n2). In fact, men in the higher insulin and C-peptide quintiles\nhad a nonsignificantly lower gallbladder disease prevalence\ncompared with those in the lowest quintile, though this\nrelationship was not linear. The gallbladder disease preva-\nlence ratio for undiagnosed diabetes in men was similar to\nthat in women, but the ratio estimate was imprecise because\nof the smaller number of men with gallbladder disease\nresulting in wide confidence intervals. In fact a post-hoc\nanalysis indicated that the power to detect a prevalence ratio\ndisease prevalence increased with fasting insulin-to-glucose\nratio in univariate (P  .016), but not in multivariate analysis\n(P  .49) (data not shown). Fasting insulin-to-C-peptide\nratio was unassociated in univariate (P  .10) or multivariate\nanalysis (P  .65) (data not shown). Glycated hemoglobin\nlevel was associated with gallbladder disease in univariate\nanalysis when men with levels in the highest 5% were\ncompared with those with lower levels (95%) (P  .023). No\nassociation was found in multivariate analysis (P  .64) (data\nnot shown).\nThe relationship of gallbladder disease with diabetes melli-\ntus was examined in more detail. First, because obesity is\nassociated with both gallbladder disease and diabetes, the\nrelationship of gallbladder disease with diabetes status was\nexamined stratified by BMI quintile. Within each BMI quin-\ntile, persons with diabetes had a higher age-adjusted gallblad-\nder disease prevalence than persons with normal fasting\nglucose or impaired fasting glucose, except in the lowest BMI\nquintile in which there were too few persons with diabetes to\nevaluate (data not shown). Next, to examine whether insulin\nlevel was responsible for the association of gallbladder disease\nwith undiagnosed diabetes, fasting serum insulin level was\nadded to the model for undiagnosed diabetes, while adjusting\nonly for age. The increased risk of gallbladder disease in\nwomen with undiagnosed diabetes (prevalence ratio [PR] \n2.32) was modestly dampened by including the fasting\ninsulin level in the model (PR  1.90) (Table 3). In the\nage-adjusted model in men, the serum insulin level had less\nof an effect on the association between gallbladder disease\nand undiagnosed diabetes than in women (Table 3). Finally,\nthe effect of insulin level on the relationship between\ngallbladder disease and undiagnosed diabetes was examined\nin multivariate analysis. The increased risk of gallbladder\ndisease in women with undiagnosed diabetes (PR  1.91)\nwas not affected by including fasting insulin level in the\nmodel (PR  1.85) (Table 3). Substituting fasting serum\nC-peptide for insulin in the model also had no effect. The\nassociation of gallbladder disease with undiagnosed diabetes\nin multivariate analysis in men was likewise unaffected by\nincluding insulin and C-peptide in the model (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study provides evidence from a large, national,\npopulation-based sample for an association of gallbladder\ndisease with higher fasting serum insulin and C-peptide\nlevels in women. The association was independent of fasting\nglucose and other covariates related to gallbladder disease.\nPrior studies that found an association of gallbladder disease\nand insulin levels had smaller sample sizes and did not\ncontrol for the large number of covariates that could poten-\ntially confound the relationship, such as race-ethnicity,26\nobesity,27 regional fat distribution,28 exogenous estrogen,29\nsmoking,30 and physical activity.31 The association of gallblad-\nTABLE 2.

Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide also adjusted for fasting plasma\nglucose.\nder disease with fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels\nthat we found in women was independent of all these factors\nas well as of glucose level.\nInsulin may play a role in gallstone formation by increasing\ncholesterol saturation of bile or by decreasing gallbladder\nmotility, two important factors in gallstone pathogenesis.\nPersons with non\u00adinsulin-dependent diabetes, who typically\nhave elevated blood insulin levels because of insulin resis-\ntance, have been shown to have a higher bile cholesterol\nsaturation index compared with controls,32,33 although not in\nall studies.34 Insulin treatment of persons with non\u00adinsulin-\ndependent diabetes significantly raised the cholesterol satura-\ntion index.35 A higher insulin concentration could predispose\nto gallstone formation by increasing the activity of hydroxy-\nmethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase,36 the rate limiting\nenzyme in hepatic synthesis of new cholesterol, or by\nactivating low density lipoprotein receptors37 resulting in\ngreater hepatic uptake of low density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nBy inhibiting basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated gallblad-\nder motility, insulin might also increase gallstone risk through\nan effect on motility.38\nThe lack of an association of gallbladder disease with\nfasting serum insulin level in men may be caused by\ndecreased statistical power to detect such a relationship in\nmen, who have a lower prevalence of gallstones. In addition,\nalthough the majority of gallstones in the United States are\ncholesterol stones rather than pigment stones,39 the propor-\ntion of cholesterol stones is lower in men than in women.40,41\nThe lower prevalence and greater heterogeneity of gallstones\nin men may be responsible for differences between sexes in\nthis study, as well as the fact that fewer risk factors have been\nfound for gallbladder disease in men than in women.1\nAlternatively, insulin may act differently in relation to gall-\nstone formation in men and women. The nonsignificantly\nlower adjusted gallbladder disease prevalence in men with\nhigher fasting insulin and C-peptide levels might suggest this\npossibility. Nevertheless, there is no physiological reason to\nsuspect such a gender difference.\nThe association of gallbladder disease with insulin did not\naccount for the increased risk of gallstones in persons with\nundiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose 126 mg/dL). Al-\nthough the association of gallbladder disease and diabetes in\nmen was not statistically significant, the prevalence ratio was\njust as high as in women and was previously found to be\nstatistically significant in the entire NHANES III sample (n \ngallbladder disease regardless of the presence of other factors\nassociated with gallbladder disease including age, BMI, and\nethnicity, as well as insulin and C-peptide levels. The failure\nof insulin to account for the association of diabetes and\ngallbladder disease may have partly been caused by limita-\ntions of the study. Being a cross-sectional study, insulin and\nC-peptide levels at the time of examination may not have\nbeen the same as at the time of gallstone formation. Also,\nserum insulin concentration is only a surrogate for insulin\nresistance. Nevertheless, the current study of gallbladder\ndisease suggests that both hyperinsulinemia and diabetes are\nindependent risk factors in women and that diabetes may be a\nrisk factor in men.\n"
