In the United States, dietary supplement (DS) use is common, often takes place outside of the purview of health\ncare providers, and may involve DS in combination with pharmaceuticals. This situation has led to concerns about interactions\nbetween DS and pharmaceuticals, as well as the risks from polypharmacy and polysupplement use. Methods. We used data from\nthe Midlife in the US study (MIDUS 2 Survey) to examine DS and prescription pharmaceutical use in 3876 study participants in\norder to determine the demographics of high-users (5 or more) of DS and pharmaceuticals and the presence of DS-pharmaceutical\nco-use. Results. Over 69% of study participants regularly used DS, 49.6% regularly used both DS and pharmaceuticals, and 6.3%\nand 8.7% were high-users of pharmaceuticals and DS, respectively. High-users of DS, pharmaceuticals, and either were more likely\nthan the whole cohort to be female and of lower income. Conclusions. These findings corroborate those of other national studies\nwith respect to the demographics of DS users but add new information about people at risk of DS-pharmaceutical interactions, not\nan insignificant proportion of the population examined by this dataset.\n1. Introduction\nIn the United States (USA), the use of complementary and\nalternative medicine (CAM) is common [1]. One component\nof CAM is a category referred to as dietary supplements\n(DS), which includes herbal medicines, vitamins, minerals,\nand other substances such as amino acids and enzymes\nNationwide surveys, including Midlife in the United\nStates (MIDUS), have begun the process of delineating\nthe demographics of DS users, the prevalence of DS use,\nand other related factors such as disclosure to health care\nproviders (HCP) and sources of DS information (Table 1).\nThe results of such surveys show that the use of DS is\nnot insignificant, with estimates of 20% of the US popu-\nlation regularly using DS [1, 3]. These rates may be even\nhigher in some groups such as immigrant populations [4].\nIn recent years, the medical literature has also begun the\nprocess of assessing DS efficacy and safety, including issues\nsurrounding the ingestion of numerous DS [5, 6], adverse\ndietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions [3, 7\u00ad9], and\nspecific DS-pharmaceutical combinations that warrant extra\ncaution on the part of HCP [10].\nWith respect to the use of multiple DS, there is no\ngenerally accepted threshold at which extra risk is thought\nto occur, though there is some guidance about this topic\nin the polypharmacy literature. Polypharmacy is a situa-\ntion of high risk for adverse interactions or drug effects,\noften defined as the simultaneous ingestion of five or more\npharmaceuticals, though the most accurate determination of\nrisk for a given individual would also take into effect other\nfactors such as their medical history and the appropriateness\nof a pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical dose [11, 12]. The\nassessment of DS safety involves a careful examination of\ninteractions between DS and pharmaceuticals to identify any\nadverse health outcomes associated with co-use [13, 14]. All\nof these concerns are heightened when health care providers\nare unaware of DS use, a common phenomenon in the USA,\nwith data showing that nondisclosure rates approach 70% in\nFrom its inception, MIDUS, a longitudinal study of health\nand aging, has included a wide array of demographic and\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nTable 1: Demographics and DS use in four national surveys.\nNational Health and\nNutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES)\nNational Health\nInterview Survey\nAmerican Association of\nRetired Persons (AARP)\nMidlife in the United States\nDS included\nHM, M, V, O HM, O HM, O HM, M, V, O\nAARP and the National Center\nfor Complementary and\nDS: dietary supplement; HM: herbal medicine, M: minerals, V: vitamins, O: other dietary supplements.\npsychosocial measures as well as comprehensive assessments\nof health (physical and mental) and health behaviors includ-\ning use of prescription pharmaceuticals (Rx) and over-the-\ncounter medications (OTC) [19, 20]. In the first longitudinal\nuse were expanded to include DS, thus creating a dataset\ncontaining detailed information about Rx, DS, and OTC\nuse.\nThe aim of this analysis was to add to the DS literature\nby analyzing data from the MIDUS 2 survey in order to\n(1) improve knowledge surrounding the characteristics of\nusers of DS, comparing these results to other large national\nsurveys, and (2) explore the presence DS-Rx co-use and the\ndemographics of people involved.\n2. Participants and Methods\n7108) were noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults in\nthe continental USA, aged 25\u00ad74 years. As described else-\nwhere [20], the MIDUS 1 sample was comprised of 3 subsam-\nples: the Main sample recruited using random-digit dialing\nmethods ( = 4244), siblings of Main sample participants\nall of whom were invited to complete telephone interviews\nand self-administered questionnaires. Nine to ten years after\nto participate in the MIDUS 2 survey, which included a\nphone interview and another self-administered questionnaire\n[20]. Medication use is assessed in the self-administered\nquestionnaire, while the demographic data is obtained via\nthe telephone interview. Only a subset of individuals ( =\n4,006) who completed both the telephone survey and the\nself-administered questionnaire at MIDUS 2 were included\nin the current analysis; this subsample is not significantly\ndifferent from the larger sample from which it is drawn [21].\nquestions pertaining to DS and Rx use.\nThe demographic variables of interest are age in years,\ngender, educational level (less than high school or high school\ngraduate (HS) or equivalent (GED), some college, and college\ngraduate or more), and personal income, reported by the\nrespondent as wages over the last year, an estimate of a\nperson's financial resources and status.\nThe MIDUS 2 self-administered questionnaire included\ntwo sets of items assessing Rx and DS use: (1) \"During the\npast 30 days have you taken prescription medicine for any\nof the following conditions?\" Individuals were classified as\npharmaceutical users if they said \"yes\" to at least one of\nthese items; (2) \"Please check below any of the following\nvitamin, mineral, or herbal supplements you take regularly--\nthat is, at least a couple of times a week.\" The DS checklist\nincluded common herbal medicines, vitamins, and minerals\nand provided study participants the option to add DS not\nfound on the list. Individuals were classified as DS users if\nthey checked at least one item on this list. In addition, the\ntotal numbers of DS and Rx being used were tabulated.\nFour categories of DS and Rx users were created: (1)\nneither DS nor Rx used; (2) Rx only in the past 30 days; (3) DS\nonly used regularly; and (4) both DS and Rx used. Further-\nmore, three categories of \"high-users\" were created: (1) using\nfive or more Rx in the past 30 days (regardless of DS use); (2)\nusing five or more DS regularly (regardless of Rx use); and\n(3) using five or more of either DS or pharmaceuticals. This\ndistinction is designed to capture study participants who were\nin a polypharmacy and/or polysupplement situation.\n3. Data Analysis\nDescriptive statistics of individual and paired variables were\nexamined in tabular and graphic format. A chi-squared\nanalysis for proportion was utilized to compare variables\nas detailed in Tables 2 and 3. Any z-test P value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant; values meeting these\ncriteria were labeled as such in the relevant tables. Logistic\nregression analysis was then used to evaluate the group\ndifferences between high- and low-users of DS and Rx. All\ndata was deleted from the cases of interest for the DS and\npharmaceutical variable analyses.\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\nTable 2: Demographic profiles for study cohort as a whole and with respect to use or nonuse of dietary supplements (DS) and pharmaceuticals\n(Rx).\nDemographic characteristic Total sample\nNeither DS nor Rx\nAny Rx\nAny DS\nBoth DS and Rx\nGender\nEducation (%)\na < 0.05 when compared to the total sample (column 2).\nb < 0.05 when compared to \"neither using DS (regularly) nor pharmaceuticals (in the last 30 days)\" (column 3).\nc < 0.05 when compared to \"any Rx\" (column 4).\nd < 0.05 when compared to \"any DS\" (column 5).\nTable 3: Demographic profiles (in %) for \"high-users\" (5) of prescription pharmaceuticals (Rx), \"high-users\" (5) of dietary supplements\n(DS), and study participants using 5 either Rx or DS.\nDemographic characteristics Total sample\n\"High-users\" of Rx\n\"High-users\" of DS\n\"regularly\"\n\"High-users\" of Rx\nor DS\n\"High-users\" of Rx\nand DS\nGender\nEducation\na < 0.05 when compared to the total sample (column 2).\nb < 0.05 when \"high-users\" of DS are compared to \"high-users\" of prescription pharmaceuticals.\n4. Results\nDemographic characteristics for the full sample, as well as\ncategories of DS and pharmaceutical use, are summarized in\nTable 2. The sample is predominantly female (55.7%), aged\n56.2 years on average, with a mean income of approximately\n$28,000 and having a high school education or less. In\ntaking at least one pharmaceutical in the last 30 days, 1,923\n(Figure 1).\nWhen compared to the entire cohort ( = 3876), there\nwere statistically significant differences in the demographics\nof study participants using neither, any Rx, any DS, or both\nDS and Rx (Table 2, columns 3\u00ad6). Notably, when compared\nto the whole cohort, people using neither were less likely\nboth DS and Rx were more likely to be women (62.3%) and\n$17,999). Those study participants who used any DS (column\n5) were slightly older than the whole cohort (mean age 58.0\nsimilar.\nWhen neither category was used as the comparison, both\nDS users and Rx users were older (average age 48.7 versus 58.0\nand 58.6, resp.), while the Rx users had more people in the\nresp.).\nThe number of DS and Rx taken by study participants is\nshown in Figure 1. Study participants ingested between 0 and\n15 DS and 0 and 12 Rx. As mentioned above, nearly half the\nsample (49.6%) were taking both DS and Rx; a cluster exists in\nthe lower numbers of DS and Rx, though individuals populate\neven the higher number combinations (Figure 2). Examples\nof these higher number combinations are one person taking\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nNumber of people\nNumber taken\nPharmaceuticals\nDietary supplements\nFigure 1: Number of people in MIDUS 2, Project 1, ingesting a given number of prescription pharmaceuticals (in the past 30 days) or dietary\nsupplements (\"regularly\").\nNumber of prescription\nmedications taken in\nNumber of dietary supplements taken in the last 30 days\nNumber of dietary supplements taken ``regularly''\nFigure 2: The MIDUS 2 Project 1 cohort ( = 3876): the number of people taking a given number of dietary supplements (0\u00ad15) and\nprescription medications (0\u00ad12).\nnine Rx and 14 DS, one person taking five Rx and nine DS,\none person taking three Rx and 11 DS, and one person taking\nThe demographics of high-users (5) of DS ( = 333),\nTable 3. When compared with the total sample ( = 3876),\npeople in all three categories were more likely to be female,\nolder (mean age 65 or greater), and with a lower median\nincome. The low annual income result for the high-user Rx\ngroup was affected by respondents answering \"zero\" to wages\nover the last year. With respect to education, DS users tend\nto have more education and Rx users less education. In the\nhigh-user Rx group, more people had high school or less\neducation, and less people had a bachelor's degree or more\neducation, when compared to the high-user DS group. Of\nnote, 28 individuals who were high-users of both DS and\nRx were identified, so 5 DS and 5 Rx (Table 3, column 6).\nExploring the demographics of the high-users of either DS or\nRx (Table 3, column 5), a logistic regression illustrated that\nfemale gender, lower income, and higher age make it more\nlikely that a study participant is in the \"high-use\" category,\nwhereas amount of education was less of a determinant.\n5. Discussion\nLarge national datasets provide information that can answer\nquestions of importance to health care delivery and decision-\nmaking. This is no exception with MIDUS 2 survey, which\nshows that people in this dataset use DS and pharmaceuticals\nsimultaneously and in multiple quantities. The results pre-\nsented here both corroborate past research and provide an\nexpansion of the topic by exploring details behind DS and\npharmaceutical co-use. For example, this analysis illustrates\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\nthat recent DS users (any quantity) are more likely to be\nolder and women, in line with other prior national surveys\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS) [1, 3, 22, 23]. In contrast, this\nanalysis showed a similar amount of education between the\nDS cohort and the whole cohort; in other trials, DS users are\noften more likely to be more highly educated. Of note, the\nMIDUS study participants are considered highly educated at\nbaseline [20, 21], perhaps affecting any additional education\neffect that might appear in subanalyses.\nAs presented in Table 3, the data on users of five or\nmore DS and/or Rx (\"high-users\"), considered to be an\nimportant high-risk group, shows that high-users tend to\nbe older and female. Of the high-user groups, high-users\nof DS and both DS and Rx had more education, whereas\nhigh-users of pharmaceuticals had less education overall.\nPicking apart the meaning and etiology of these trends, and\nfinding clinical relevance, is a challenge. Clearly, women,\nin particular, women at a higher average age, are at risk\nof adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions\nbecause they are users of both DS and pharmaceuticals in\nhigh numbers; this is a demographic worthy of a clinician's\nattention in this respect.\nWith respect to the income variable, there are several\nreasons why it is more difficult to draw clinically relevant\nconclusions. For example, more than for other variables, in\nMIDUS 2 there is missing income information, affecting the\nstatistical significance of the results. Also, with increasing\nage, income is replaced by retirement funds, not necessarily\ncaptured by the survey questions which focus on reportable\nwages; this would artificially convey that someone has a lower\nincome when they may, in fact, have significant regular retire-\nment income. Future analyses to examine other variables in\nthe MIDUS 2 survey dataset relevant to income, such as\nretirement income, will help to further examine this variable\nand allow a closer comparison to the NHANES results that\nshowed a higher income in DS users.\nThere are several additional study limitations that could\nhave affected the results presented and their generalizability.\nFor example, the MIDUS 2 survey has a small percentage\nof people of nonwhite races and ethnicities, restricting its\ngeneralizability to the US population. Furthermore, our\nanalysis did not include iron nor calcium supplements, even\nthose that have been included in some, but not all, other\nnational surveys. These variables were separate from the DS\ndata, though still part of the MIDUS 2 dataset, and there\nis debate about whether or not such minerals should be\nconsidered DS. If anything, the inclusion of calcium and iron\nin our analysis would have further increased the DS use data\nfor women and older individuals, given that such products\nare not uncommonly used in that population. Along the same\nlines, the questions in this survey included multivitamins\nas part of DS, similar to some, but not all, prior surveys\n(Table 1). In MIDUS 2, it is not possible to separate out\nmultivitamin use from other DS; multivitamin users may in\nfact represent a different demographic from other DS users,\nthough it is not possible to comment on this using these\nresults.\nIt was beyond the scope of this analysis to include\nthe use of over-the-counter medications, nor the specific\npairings of DS with diagnoses and health parameters. Some\nof this data is contained in MIDUS 2, but an expansion\nof this information exists in MIDUS 2 Biomarker data;\nfuture analyses intend to explore these aspects of the DS-\npharmaceutical overlap. The specific DS being used and over-\nlaps with pharmaceuticals for individual study participants is\nan important next step in focusing efforts in a targeted way on\ndecreasing the most concerning adverse dietary supplement-\npharmaceutical interactions. In addition, numerous other\nvariables could be involved with whether people use DS, RX,\nor both. One example is insurance coverage; NHIS found\nthat DS use was higher in people with no insurance. Given\nthat the analysis presented here found differences between\nthe cohort as a whole and users (\"any\" and \"high\") of both\nDS and Rx, future analyses are intended to determine which\nother factors, such as insurance, are involved.\nIn summary, this analysis provides some insight into the\ndemographics of DS users, pharmaceutical users, high-users\nor either, and those at risk of adverse DS-Rx due to co-use for\nthe MIDUS 2 survey dataset. This large national survey shows\nthat a not insignificant percentage of people are taking both\nDS and Rx and that there are important contributions to this\ngroup from gender status, age, education, and income. Merely\nat the beginning of the process of identifying who might\nbe at risk for adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical\ninteractions, this study illustrates a method that could be\nused in other large national surveys and datasets with DS and\npharmaceutical data and serves as a reminder to clinicians\nto be aware of such co-use in some patients more than\nothers, but ideally in all demographics. With that being said,\nthe ideal way to prevent polypharmacy, polysupplement use,\nand adverse dietary supplement-pharmaceutical interactions\nwould be to query every patient about DS use and have\nan informed discussion about risks and benefits in the\ncontext of their health cosmology, past medical history, and\npharmaceutical use. In that way, each of the data points in\nFigure 2 would receive attention in the clinical setting.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflict of interests with\nrespect to the authorship or publication of this paper.\nAuthors' Contribution\nDavid S.
