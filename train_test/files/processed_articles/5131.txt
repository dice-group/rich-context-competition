Professional informational benefits were conceptualized as the (timely) access\nto relevant information and being referred to career opportunities. The effect of\ncontent and structure of the respective online network on professional informational\nbenefits was examined on the general (users vs. non-users of a platform) and more fine-\ngrained level (within users of a specific platform). Overall, users of LinkedIn and Twitter\nreported higher informational benefits than non-users, whereas the Facebook users\nreported lower informational benefits. Posting about work and strategically selecting\nties consistently predicted informational benefits. The network composition mattered\nmost on LinkedIn; strong and weak ties predicted informational benefits. The results\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the social capital framework.\n",

This\nwould be in line with one of the main findings of social capital research, namely, that\nweak ties, for example, acquaintances or former colleagues, provide people with non-\nredundant information (Burt, 1992; Granovetter, 1973). But is this really the case?\nThe majority of studies on social capital gained from social media use have focused\non the benefits stemming from Facebook use (Johnson et al., 2013; Liu and Yu, 2013;\nVitak and Ellison, 2012). Studies that looked at the informational benefits focused on\nspecific behaviors such as question asking (Gray et al., 2013; Oeldorf-Hirsch et al.,\n2014). Some authors examined the effectiveness of (enterprise) social media in informa-\ntion technology (IT) companies (Archambault and Grudin, 2012; DiMicco et al., 2008;\nWu et al., 2010). Recently, many conceptual papers came out that speculated on the\npotential of enterprise social media (ESM) for organizational knowledge sharing (Ellison\nthere is no study on the actual informational benefits that everyday people gain from the\nuse of public social media. This article fills this gap.\nEstablishing that there is an actual effect of social media use is an important first step\nthat must be completed before examining why these effects might occur (Rozin, 2009).\nThus, the first goal of this article is to examine whether the use of publicly available\nsocial media is related to professional informational benefits. Informational benefits are\nconceptualized in line with Burt (1992) as (timely) access to information and receiving\nreferrals. The second goal is to examine the processes on a more fine-grained level by\nlooking at actual use of a specific platform and the role of the content and structure of the\nrespective network, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the social capital framework\nin this context. An online survey among a representative sample of Dutch online users\nwas conducted to examine how the use of public social media affects professional infor-\nmational benefits at the general (users vs non-users of a platform) and more specific\n(actual use of a platform) level.\nSocial capital and social media\nAdler and Kwon (2002) define social capital as \"the goodwill available to individuals or\ngroups. Its source lies in the structure and content of the actor's social relations. Its\neffects flow from the information, influence, and solidarity it makes available to the\nactor\" (p. 23). The effects of social capital are often grouped roughly into the categories\nThe general assumption is that strong ties, that is, ties with family members or close\nfriends, provide people with emotional support, whereas weaker ties, that is, acquaint-\nances or former colleagues, provide people with non-redundant information.\nAccording to Burt (1992), \"information benefits occur in three forms: access, timing,\nand referrals\" (p. 13). Access means that people receive novel and needed information.\nTiming refers to receiving information in time and/or faster than others. Referrals cover\nthe other direction of the information flow: being recommended to others, for example,\nfor promotions or jobs. Whereas the first two aspects are mainly necessary for day-to-\nday operations, referrals are often important for career progress (Burt, 1992). This arti-\ncle focuses specifically on informational benefits in professional contexts because\nconceptual papers as well as business networks themselves stress the potential of social\nmedia for professional knowledge sharing.\nSocial media make it easier to maintain and extend social networks and can thereby\nchange the structure and the content of an actor's social network. Studies have shown\nthat the use of social network sites (SNS) mainly increases contact with weaker ties\nWith regard to the effects of social capital derived from social media, three lines of\nresearch can be distinguished: studies focusing on emotional support (not discussed\nhere), studies focusing on informational support on a fine-grained level (e.g. question\nasking), and mostly conceptual work on the potential effects of (enterprise) social media\nfor organizational knowledge sharing.\nStudies on question asking or mobilization requests showed that people do get useful\nrecommendations from their Facebook contacts (Ellison et al., 2013; Gray et al., 2013;\nanswers found via search engines more often contain new information, but that people\nare more satisfied with the answers from their social network. These papers examined\nFacebook, where people predominantly stay in touch with people they also know face-\nto-face. According to the social capital framework, weaker ties in particular provide use-\nful information; therefore, it is interesting to examine looser networks on LinkedIn or\nTwitter.\nIn the domain of organizational communication, there are some case studies focusing\non specific ESM platforms (e.g. Beehive) in tech-savvy organizations such as IBM (e.g.\nDiMicco et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2010). There is also some initial evidence that public\nsocial media such as LinkedIn or Twitter are perceived as useful by at least some employ-\nbut these findings are not systematically related to specific usage behaviors.\nOther authors (in conceptual papers) used an affordances approach to speculate about\nthe potential benefits (and pitfalls) of social media in organizations (Ellison et al., 2015;\nFulk and Yuan, 2013; Majchrzak et al., 2013). Affordances are the action possibilities\ninherent in objects perceived by the users. According to this approach, different users\nmay perceive the same social media feature in different ways (see Treem and Leonardi,\n2012, for a summary). The heightened visibility and persistence of content on social\nmedia, for example, might encourage some people to share their knowledge, but also\nscare off less confident individuals.\nThis article takes a different approach and builds on the social capital framework\nwhich focuses on the content and structure of networks. It compares three types of\nsocial media that differ in their primary purpose and architectural elements, but share\nthe affordances of visibility, persistence, and association: LinkedIn, Twitter, and\nFacebook. The focus of this article is on the actual use of these platforms rather than\nthe perceptions. In the first step, the effect of using (vs non-using) the three platforms\non professional informational benefits is examined. In the second step, a more fine-\ngrained analysis is conducted by focusing on the actual usage patterns that predict\ninformational benefits within each platform. A similar approach has been taken by\nValenzuela et al. (2009) for examining the effects of Facebook use on civic/political\nparticipation and trust.\nAcross platforms: effects of social media platform on professional\ninformational benefits\nSocial media differ in their primary purpose and the architectural elements that suggest\nthe intended form of use (Papacharissi, 2009). On Facebook, many profile fields refer to\nhobbies, favorite music, and other personal interests; staying in touch with family and\nfriends is the main motivation for use (Ellison et al., 2007). On LinkedIn or other busi-\nness networks, the focus is clearly on professional life (Papacharissi, 2009). The profile\nfields resemble the categories of a CV but do not provide fields for hobbies or favorite\nmusic. On Twitter, there is less space for profile information and the tweets are limited\nto 140 characters. The networks are asymmetrical. Twitter can be used in different ways,\nfor example, as a friend-following network or as a news and event-following medium\nBuilding on the definition of social capital by Adler and Kwon (2002), the basic\nassumption of this article is that the source of social capital lies in the content and struc-\nture of an actors' network. When it comes to professional informational benefits, a plat-\nform that provides work-related content and access to weaker ties in the relevant field\nshould result in higher informational benefits. Papacharissi (2009) demonstrated that\nLinkedIn has a strong professional focus that offers little space for non-professional use.\nIt can therefore be assumed that most of the content on LinkedIn is work-related. People\nare also more likely to follow colleagues, former colleagues, and important people in\ntheir field on business networks than on Facebook (Utz and Muscanell, 2014). Moreover,\npeople add more weak contacts to their business network than to their Facebook account\n(Utz and Muscanell, 2014). Weaker contacts are regarded as more useful in providing\nnon-redundant information (Granovetter, 1973). Thus, it can be assumed that the struc-\nture and content of the social networks people maintain on LinkedIn are well suited for\nproviding professional informational benefits:\nH1. LinkedIn users report higher professional informational benefits than non-users.\nThe same arguments, albeit to a lesser degree, can be made for Twitter because Twitter\ncan be used as a broadcasting medium for professional content and also for interaction\nmicroblogging helped to create awareness of what colleagues are working on. Morris\net al. (2010) reported that IT professionals used Twitter for asking technical questions but\nFacebook for asking questions about home or entertainment. Assuming that these techni-\ncal questions are often work-related, this indicates that Twitter use has at least some posi-\ntive effects of informational benefits:\nH2. Twitter users report higher professional informational benefits than non-users.\nWith regard to Facebook, two lines of reasoning are possible. Skeels and Grudin\n(2009) found that Facebook was used for keeping in touch with colleagues. Regularly\nreading colleagues' status updates was perceived as increasing tie strength and trust.\nTrust is an important enabler of knowledge sharing (Levin and Cross, 2004); Facebook\nuse could thus increase informational benefits via increased trust. However, most posts\non Facebook are about everyday activities with a strong focus on positive and entertain-\ning aspects (Barash et al., 2010), and users mainly ask questions about home, family, and\nentertainment (Ellison et al., 2013; Morris et al., 2010). Based on these findings,\nFacebook seems less suited for professional information exchange. Because of these\nopposing lines of argumentation, an open research question regarding the effects of\nFacebook use is posed:\nRQ1. Do Facebook users report higher or lower professional informational benefits\nthan non-users?\nWhereas this first comparison is rather technologically deterministic and focuses on\nthe (main) purpose of a specific platform, the next section focuses on the question of how\nthe actual use of these platforms affects informational benefits. Because the effects of\ncontent and network structure can only be leveraged when a platform is actually used,\nthe effects of usage are addressed first before turning to content and structure.\nWithin platforms: effects of usage, content, and network on informational\nbenefits\nUsage. Social media can be used in a rather passive way by mainly reading what others\npost or in a more active way by posting regularly (Burke et al., 2011). There are several\nreasons why reading could increase professional informational benefits. Reading might\nsimply facilitate serendipity--readers can stumble upon relevant new information (Zhao\nand Rosson, 2009). Moreover, checking the profiles of co-workers or relevant people in\nthe field and following their informal communication on social media can help people to\nbuild a transactive memory (Fulk and Yuan, 2013), a cognitive representation of who\nknows what in their network (Wegner, 1987). Next to this cognitive effect, socio-emo-\ntional effects are also conceivable. Leonardi and Meyer (2015) argue that the ambient\nawareness stemming from reading newsfeeds functions as a social lubricant, making it\neasier to approach colleagues for advice. Moreover, regularly reading what other people\nare doing could also create ambient intimacy and increase trust, thereby fostering knowl-\nedge sharing (Fulk and Yuan, 2013). Thus, a positive effect of reading on social media\nplatforms can be expected:\nH3. Frequency of reading is positively related to professional informational benefits.\nActive participation, that is, posting updates or writing contributions in groups (in the\ncase of LinkedIn and Facebook), can also increase the informational benefits people\nreceive. Several studies have shown that people who ask questions on social media receive\nuseful answers from their networks (Gray et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2011). People who post\nfrequently should also be perceived as more trustworthy, either simply because mere\nexposure increases liking and trust (Zajonc, 1968) or even more when they make valuable\ncontributions. Because people share more knowledge with people they trust (Levin and\nCross, 2004), active posters should be more likely to receive useful information when\nthey ask for it. Moreover, people who display their expertise regularly can build reputa-\ntion in their field and might be more likely to be referred to attractive career opportunities.\nThese arguments lead to the next hypothesis:\nH4. Frequency of active participation is positively related to professional informa-\ntional benefits.\nAfter controlling for the frequency of passive and active social media use, the next\nsections address the role of content and structure of the respective networks.\nContent. Active participation might be necessary, but not sufficient for informational ben-\nefits. The content of the posts is more important because only work-related posts demon-\nstrate one's own expertise or professional information needs. Even Facebook users might\ngain informational benefits when they use Facebook in a somewhat atypical way and post\nwork-related content (Vitak and Ellison, 2012). Thus, according to the social capital frame-\nwork, the content posted should matter more than the frequency of posting, regardless of\nthe platform used. That means that the effects of active participation should become smaller\nor even non-significant once the analysis controls for the content of the posts:\nH5. Posting professional content predicts professional informational benefits above\nand beyond frequency of active participation.\nNetwork. The source of social capital lies not only in the content but also in the structure of\nan actor's social network (Adler and Kwon, 2002). The next set of hypotheses focuses there-\nfore on the structure of the social network. Prior research on informational benefits focused\nalmost exclusively on the role of strong and weak ties, although Granovetter (1973) also\nmentions a third type of ties: absent ties or nodding ties--people we nod to when we meet\nthem on the street, but we do not talk to. These ties have been considered as useless (Gran-\novetter, 1973). Nowadays, many people add strangers to their online networks. Haythornth-\nwaite (2005) introduced the term latent ties to describe ties that are \"technologically possible\nbut not yet activated socially\" (p. 137) and argues that they might become weaker ties later.\nThis raises the question of whether the classical assumptions about tie strength still hold in\nan environment where the boundaries between strong, weak, and latent ties blur.\nThe classical assumption that weak ties provide more novel information (Burt, 1992;\nGranovetter, 1973) would lead to the hypothesis that mainly the weak ties should increase\ninformational benefits. In line with this hypothesis, Lampe et al. (2012) reported a rela-\ntionship between weak ties and perceived usefulness of Facebook for information seek-\ning.However,eveninofflinecontexts,therelationshipbetweenweaktiesandinformational\nbenefits has not always been found. Hansen (1999) and Reagans and McEvily (2003) both\nshowed that complex knowledge is shared more easily with strong ties. Burke and Kraut\n(2013) reported that people who lost their job had a higher chance of finding a new job\nwhen they talked to strong Facebook ties. Based on these findings, it could also be\nexpected that contact with mainly strong ties results in higher informational benefits.\nEven latent ties might provide informational benefits. If the notion that weak ties have\nmore access to novel information than strong ties is further stretched, it can be assumed\nthat latent ties can be important information sources. Because of these contrasting lines\nof argumentation, a research question about network structure, that is, the number of\nstrong, weak, and latent ties, is formulated:\nRQ2. How is the number of strong, weak, and latent ties related to professional infor-\nmational benefits?\nThe number of strong, weak, and latent ties is just a very rough estimator of the actual\nnetwork structure of individuals. A better indicator would be the actual expertise and the\nexact network position of each and every tie. Assessing the complete networks of people\non three different platforms in one study is not feasible and also problematic from an\nethical/privacy perspective. Therefore, the strategic networking behavior of respondents\nwas assessed as an additional indicator for the structure of the network. Strategic net-\nworking behavior means that people deliberately add/friend individuals who could\nbecome relevant for them (e.g. someone with expertise or a high status in their field).\nIndividuals who engage in strategic networking behavior should retrieve more informa-\ntional benefits from their networks than individuals who randomly add or accept con-\ntacts. Thus, the last hypothesis is as follows:\nH6. Strategic networking is positively related to professional informational benefits.\nTo test these hypotheses, an online survey among working Dutch online users was\nconducted.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA sample of 3367 people, representative for Dutch online users with regard to gender,\nage, education level, and place of living (urban/rural), were recruited by GfK intomart, a\nprofessional research company, in autumn 2013. Only the 1959 respondents who worked\nwere included in the current analysis. Of this subsample, 56% were male, reflecting the\nfact that more men than women work in the Netherlands. In all, 23% had a low education\nlevel, 46% had a medium education level, and 31% had higher education; 23% were\ntion was still working although they were 65 or older.\nMeasures\nSocial media use.Respondents indicated whether they had a profile on (a) a privately\nused SNS such as Facebook, (b) a business network such as LinkedIn, and/or (c) a micro-\nblogging service such as Twitter. Respondents who had a profile on a specific platform\nreceived follow-up questions for the respective platform.\nRespondents indicated how often they read and posted messages on the respective\nplatform. Answer categories were \"several times a day,\" \"daily,\" \"several times a week,\"\n\"several times per month,\" \"rarely,\" and \"never.\" Values were later recoded such that\nhigher scores represent more active usage. Users of Facebook and LinkedIn also indi-\ncated their activity in groups, an additional communication feature, on a 5-point scale\nranging from \"not at all\" to \"regularly.\"\nProfessional content.Respondents indicated how often they posted about their profes-\nsional successes, general information about their work, or asked for advice on their work\non 5-point scales ranging from \"never\" to \"very often.\" Reliability of the three items was\nhigh, =.84, .83, and .88 for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, respectively.\nNetwork composition. Respondents were told that it is helpful to open the social media\nprofile in a separate window to answer the network composition questions. Next to the\noverall number of friends/connections/followers/followees, respondents were asked to\nestimate how many people in their respective online networks are strong, weak, or latent\nties. Descriptions of these three types of ties were given. For latent ties, respondents were\nasked how many of their social media contacts they would not even recognize if they\nwould meet them on the street. Respondents were free to enter the absolute number or a\npercentage. Percentages were later converted into absolute numbers. For the regression\nanalyses, the numbers were log-transformed.\nStrategic networking. Respondents indicated their agreement with five statements such as\n\"I invite people who might sometimes be useful for me\" or \"I accept invitations from\nimportant people\" on 5-point scales ranging from \"totally disagree\" to \"totally agree.\"\nThe item on accepting invitations was dropped for Twitter because it is not applicable.\nCronbach's  was .69, .79, and .72, respectively, for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.\nProfessional informational benefits.The dependent variable, professional informational\nbenefits, was assessed with five items from Wickramasinghe and Weliwitigoda (2011).\nThese capture the three dimensions of access, timeliness, and referrals (Burt, 1992): \"I\nreceive information about innovations in my field from my network members, timely,\"\n\"The relationships that I maintain are helpful in making career moves,\" \"I can get access\nto knowledge that is helpful in mastering job tasks from my network members,\" \"I\nreceive information about job opportunities from my network members,\" and \"Contacts\nthat I have established are essential for my career success.\" Respondents indicated their\nagreement with the statements on 5-point scales ranging from \"totally disagree\" to\n\"totally agree.\" Although the three dimensions can be distinguished theoretically, an\nexploratory factor analysis showed that empirically all items loaded on a highly consist-\nent (=.90) single factor that explained 71.43% of the variance.\nResults\nDescriptives\nOf the respondents, 76% had a profile on Facebook or another SNS used mainly for\nprivate purposes, 32% had a profile on LinkedIn or another business network, and 18%\nhad a profile on Twitter or another microblogging service. Facebook (96%), LinkedIn\n(89%), and Twitter (97%) were by far the most frequently used platforms; therefore, the\nterms Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter users will also be used to refer to the more inclusive\ngroups. In total, 52% had an account on only one platform, 23% used two platforms\n(mostly Facebook and LinkedIn), and 9% were active on all three platforms. The means,\nstandard deviations, and intercorrelations of the measures are displayed separately for\neach platform in Table 1.\nFor better interpretability, means for number of ties are based on untransformed data;\ncorrelations involving number of ties are based on ln-transformed data.\nEffects of social media platform\nTo examine whether the use of a specific platform was related to professional informational\nbenefits, a step-wise hierarchical regression was conducted. In the first block, age, gender,\neducation level, and income were entered as control variables. In the second block, use of\nLinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook was added. The control variables explained 6% of the vari-\nhigher educated people (=.17, p<.001) reported higher informational benefits.Adding the\nthree social media use variables doubled the amount of explained variance significantly to\n<\n.001. Using LinkedIn significantly increased informational\n<\n.001. Using Twitter also resulted in a significant increase in informa-\ntional benefits, albeit to a lesser degree, =.07, p<.001. H1 and H2 are thereby supported.\nWith regard to RQ1, it turned out that using Facebook resulted in significantly lower infor-\nmational benefits, =-.12, p\n<\n.001. Interestingly, in Step 2, the effect of gender was no\nlonger significant (=.01) and the effect of education level decreased (=.08, p<.001).\nEffects within platforms\nAnalytical strategy. Separate analyses were run for the LinkedIn users (n=627), Twitter users\n(n=348), and Facebook users (n=1489). Again, hierarchical regression analyses were con-\nducted to test whether adding another block of variables significantly increased the amount\nof explained variance. In Step 1, the demographic variables were included as controls. In\nStep 2, the usage variables (e.g. reading, active participation) were added. In Step 3, the\ncontent was added, and in the final step the network structure variables (network composi-\ntion, strategic networking) were added. To make it easier to identify similarities and differ-\nences between the platforms, the results are reported per step and summarized in Table 2.\nDemographic variables. As can be seen in Table 2, Step 1 showed consistently that younger\n(s=-.09, -.15, -.19 for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook users, respectively) and higher\neducated (s=.11, .17, .18) participants derived higher informational benefits.

H3 is thus only partially supported. In line\nwith H4, posting had a positive effect on informational benefits on Facebook (\n=\np<.01) and Twitter (=.13, p<.01), but not on LinkedIn (=.03, ns). For Facebook and\nLinkedIn, posting in groups, the second indicator of active participation, clearly pre-\ndicted informational benefits derived by LinkedIn (=.22, p<.001) and Facebook users\nContent. Controlling for content increased the explained variance by 7% for Twitter and\nFacebook and 2% for LinkedIn. The betas ranged between .22 and .32, and the effects of\nposting became smaller or even non-significant (see the final model). H5 is therefore\nsupported.\nNetwork structure. The network variables explained an additional 3\u00ad4% of variance. In\nline with H6, people who scored high on strategic networking (s=.11, .21, and .15 for\nLinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook users, respectively) reported higher informational ben-\nefits. People who had more strong ties on LinkedIn (=.10) and Facebook (=.13) also\nreported higher informational benefits. The number of weak ties mattered only on\nLinkedIn (=.15, p<.01), whereas the number of latent ties had no significant effect at\nall. Interestingly, for LinkedIn users, the effects of age and education level were no\nlonger significant in the last step.\nDiscussion\nWhereas several papers have speculated about the potential of social media for organiza-\ntional knowledge sharing, this article demonstrated for the first time within a large repre-\nsentative sample of Dutch online users that working professionals actually do receive\nprofessional informational benefits (see Table 3 for a summary of hypotheses and results).\nLinkedIn users reported the highest amount of professional informational benefits, fol-\nlowed by Twitter users. In general, Facebook use was associated with lower informational\nbenefits. Within each platform, posting professional content (in groups) and strategic net-\nworking were consistently related to increased informational benefits. On LinkedIn,\nstrong and weak ties contributed to informational benefits, whereas on Facebook only the\nstrong ties mattered.\nThis study extended prior research in several ways. First, it demonstrated the effects\nof social media use on professional informational benefits, both on a general level (users\nvs non-users of a platform) and on a more fine-grained level. To my knowledge, this is\nthe first study that systematically compares the effects of Facebook, LinkedIn, and\nTwitter use. Moreover, the present sample is representative for the Dutch online users\nwith regard to age, sex, education level, and urban/rural population. Demonstrating a\nphenomenon, in this case, the higher professional informational benefits of LinkedIn and\nTwitter users, is an important first step in research that must come before examining the\nunderlying mechanisms and the direction of causality (Rozin, 2009).\nSecond, this study provided large-scale quantitative data which test some of the\nclaims proposed in conceptual papers on the potential of social media for organiza-\ntional knowledge sharing. In this prior work, several reasons why reading should\nincrease informational benefits have been postulated: serendipity (Zhao and Rosson,\n2009), cognitive processes such as constructing a transactive memory (Fulk and Yuan,\n2013), and socio-emotional processes such as ambient awareness as a social lubricant\nand increased trust (Leonardi and Meyer, 2015). Although the zero-order correlations\nwere always positive, reading predicted informational benefits only in the case of\nLinkedIn. This pattern points to the importance of content on the platform. On\nLinkedIn, there is a strong professional focus, making it more likely to stumble upon\nrelevant information and to build a transactive memory and trust in relevant experts.\nHowever, the effect was relatively small (final beta .03) indicating that the role of read-\ning is only minor. Stronger effects were found for posting. Posting in groups turned out\nto be more important than posting status updates. It has already been shown that status\nTable 3.

Future\nresearch could systematically compare the content of public updates and more private\ngroup discussions on LinkedIn.\nThird, this study demonstrates the usefulness of the social capital approach in this\ndomain on both levels--the comparison across platforms as well as within platforms.\nBuilding on Adler and Kwon's (2002) definition of social capital, it was assumed that the\ncontent and the structure of a user's network matter. The three platforms differ in their\nfocus on work-related content and network structure. As predicted, informational bene-\nfits were highest for LinkedIn users and smaller for Twitter users. Interestingly, Facebook\nusers reported significantly lower informational benefits than non-users.\nThe more fine-grained analysis within the group of users for each platform further\ndemonstrated the important role of the social capital variables. The content and structure\nof social networks explained the amount of informational benefits retrieved above and\nbeyond the actual usage variables. For Twitter and Facebook, the effects of posting were\nno longer significant once content and structure of the network were included in the\nanalysis, and for LinkedIn, the effects of reading and posting in groups were significantly\nreduced. Instead, across all three platforms, posting professional content and strategic\nnetworking were predictors of informational benefits. Interesting, but meaningful differ-\nences between the platforms emerged. The effects of posting professional content and\nstrategic networking were stronger for Facebook and Twitter, the two platforms on which\nposting professional content and networking with colleagues is not the norm. Thus, when\nthe technological architecture of a platform does not strongly imply professional use,\nusers can compensate for this by using the available features in a somewhat atypical way\n(posting about work on Facebook) and by carefully selecting relevant contacts.\nThese results also contribute to research on the role of tie strength in retrieving infor-\nmational benefits. Prior research in organizational contexts has already shown that peo-\nple often prefer to turn to strong ties, even if the weaker ties would provide the more\nOn social media, the various contexts collapse (Marwick and boyd, 2011), so the ques-\ntion arises as to whether the classical assumptions still hold and whether latent ties can\nalso contribute to professional informational benefits. The results for LinkedIn users\nmirror the findings from research on organizational knowledge sharing: strong and weak\nties both show a positive relationship with the reported informational benefits. On\nFacebook, only the strong ties mattered. This is in line with the results of Burke and\nKraut (2013). However, it remains unclear as to whether these results are due to the role\nof trust in strong ties or the Facebook algorithm that exposes users primarily to messages\nfrom strong ties (or what Facebook identifies as strong ties). Interestingly, the number of\nstrong, weak, and latent ties on Twitter had no significant relationship with professional\ninformational benefits in the regression analysis. Twitter is much more dynamic and\ntweets are as default directed to all followers. Many people just skim through the most\nrecent tweets, so reactions come mainly from users who are online at the same time.\nThus, the proportion of experts or important people in the Twitter network might matter\nmore than tie strength. In line with this argumentation, the effect of strategic networking\nwas higher on Twitter than on LinkedIn and Facebook.\nThis study extended prior research by exploring the potential of social media to turn\nlatent ties into useful ties (Haythornthwaite, 2005). Although the number of latent ties\nwas positively related to professional informational benefits, this effect became non-\nsignificant and even negative when controlling for the other variables in the regression\nanalyses. On Facebook, this could again be explained with the algorithm which rarely\nexposes users to posts from latent ties, making it thereby unlikely that latent ties contrib-\nute valuable information. The finding is puzzling for LinkedIn on Twitter. It could be that\nties are no longer classified as latent ties but as weak ties when they provide useful infor-\nmation. The classification of ties would then be influenced by information exchange on\na dyadic level. Unfortunately, the current cross-sectional data do not allow to test for the\ndirection of the effect. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine under which circum-\nstances latent ties can provide useful information on social media.\nThe cross-sectional design is a limitation of this study because it remains unclear\nwhether LinkedIn increases informational benefits or whether successful people are\nmore likely to use LinkedIn. The operationalization of tie strength could also be dis-\ncussed. Participants might have problems with correctly estimating the number of strong,\nweak, and latent ties. However, the focus was not on the exact tie strength with a specific\nperson but a rough characterization in strong, weak, and latent ties. People usually know\nhow many close friends they have on social media. Some people only add people they\nalso know in real life, so at least these individuals should be able to correctly estimate the\nnumber of latent ties. Nevertheless, the present measure is a rather crude proxy for the\nstructure of a social network. For a first exploratory study this is acceptable, but further\nresearch should definitely use more sophisticated measures.\nAnother limitation is that activity was measured on ordinal scales. In general, the use\nof self-report measures could be seen as a source of demand effects. However, the\nrespondents first filled in the blocks on social media use and then a large number of indi-\ncators of social capital (e.g., stress, loneliness, social support, civic engagement). More\nimportant, I did not assess informational benefits specifically derived from Facebook\nversus LinkedIn versus Twitter--this might indeed have created demand characteristics.\nInstead, all participants (also non-users of social media) received the same general pro-\nfessional informational benefits scale.\nThis use of a general rather than a medium-specific measure explains also on the first\nglance low amount of explained variance (15\u00ad19% overall; 13\u00ad15% explained by social\nmedia use). Even lower amounts of explained variance (4\u00ad9%) were reported by\nValenzuela et al. (2009) who also used general dependent variables such as life satisfac-\ntion or civic engagement. Considering that there are many offline sources of informa-\ntional benefits (e.g., participation in mentoring programs), the amounts of explained\nvariance purely by social media use are not so low.\nA big strength of this study is the representative sample of working Dutch online\nusers. Many studies use student samples or focus on specific organizations, making it\ndifficult to generalize the results to the population. Another strength is that the study\nprovided empirical data about the informational benefits retrieved from three different\nsocial media. The vast majority of social media research focuses on Facebook, but there\nare very few studies on LinkedIn. LinkedIn users reported the largest informational\nbenefits, so business networks definitely deserve more attention by researchers. Future\nresearch could examine whether this result can be generalized to other business net-\nworks. In German-speaking countries, for example, the business network Xing is the\nmarket leader. Posting about content and strategic networking mattered on all three\nplatforms, demonstrating the generalizability of the findings based on the social capital\nframework. The largest contribution stems from the step-wise hierarchical regressions.\nThis article goes beyond papers examining only the frequency of feature use and dem-\nonstrates that the content and structure of the social media network--theory-driven\nvariables derived from the social capital framework--matter more than the frequency\nof reading and posting.\nTaken together, this study provided clear evidence that social media use can increase\nsocial capital in the professional domain. Content and structure of the online network\nmatter. In general, users of social media that are explicitly designed for the purpose of\nprofessional knowledge sharing report the highest informational benefits. However, it\nalso matters how people actually use social media to shape the content and structure of\ntheir online network. Irrespective of platform, posting about professional content and\nstrategically adding relevant people to one's network turned out to be the most important\npredictors of professional informational benefits.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or author-\nship of this article: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European\nERC grant agreement no. 312420.
