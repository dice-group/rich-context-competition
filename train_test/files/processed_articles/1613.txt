Households are selected annually from 192 of the approxi-\nmately1900primarysamplingunits(primarilycountiesorasmall\nnumber of contiguous counties) that cover the 50 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia. Small clusters of households are drawn at\nrandom annually from these primary sampling units. A strati-\nfiedapproachisusedtoensureanoversamplingofAfricanAmeri-\ncan persons and, in 1992, Hispanic persons.\nEach year, nearly 50 000 households are selected to partici-\npate in the NHIS (a half sample of households was drawn in 1986\nowing to budgetary restrictions). Information is obtained annu-\nmary household respondent, with all of the adults at home par-\nticipating in the interview. The primary household respondent\nprovides information for children residing in the household and\nfor adults residing in the household who are not present at the\nimpairment, hearing impairment, and selected ocular and audi-\ntory diseases was obtained annually in a randomly derived, one-\nsixth sample of households already selected for the NHIS. Par-\nticipants were asked to name conditions and impairments that\nwere related to the following: (1) activity limitation in the pre-\nvious 2 weeks and the previous 12 months; (2) health care vis-\nits in the previous 2 weeks; and (3) hospital stays in the previ-\nous 12 months. A series of standardized questions was used to\ndetail the name, characteristics, cause, onset, and effects of each\ndescribed condition and impairment.24,25 Trained medical cod-\ners used this information to generate an International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) code for each condi-\nIn most cases, the participants themselves answered all of the\nquestions (61%-63% across survey years), and for the remain-\ning participants, the responses were obtained from their rela-\ntives or other proxies. For simplicity in the present study, self-\nor proxy-reported data are referred to as \"reported.\" Complete\nvisual and hearing reported data and survival status were avail-\nwho were aged 18 years or older at the time of the household\ninterview. The average number of adults per household partici-\npating in the survey was 1.85.\nConcurrent visual and hearing impairment was defined as re-\nporting both visual impairment and hearing impairment. For vi-\nsualimpairment,participantswereaskedtoindicatewhetherthey\nor any family members had \"blindness in 1 or both eyes\" and\n\"any other trouble seeing with 1 or both eyes even when wear-\ning glasses.\" Modified ICD-9 codes were used by the NCHS to\nclassify visual impairment as follows: (1) blind in both eyes;\n(2) visual impairment in both eyes; (3) blind in one eye and vi-\nsually impaired in the other; and (4) blind or visually impaired\nin one eye only, with good vision or vision not mentioned in the\nother. In the present analyses, participants falling into catego-\nries 1 through 4 were grouped into a single reported visual im-\npairment category. For hearing impairment, participants were\nasked to indicate whether they or any of their family members\nwere \"deaf in 1 or both ears\" or \"had any other trouble hearing\nwith 1 or both ears.\" Modified ICD-9 codes were used by the\nNCHS to classify hearing impairment as follows: (1) deaf in both\nears; (2) hearing impairment in 1 or both ears; (3) deaf in one\near and hearing impairment in the other; and (4) deaf or hear-\ning impairment in 1 ear only (with good hearing or hearing not\nmentioned in the other ear).26,27 In the present analyses, partici-\npantsfallingintocategories1through4weregroupedintoasingle\nreported hearing impairment category.\nCovariates included age, sex, race, marital status, educational\nstatus, self-rated health, and the number of nonvision- and\nnonhearing-related health conditions. Race was coded as Af-\nrican American, white, and other races (which included\nAleut, Eskimo or American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander,\nmultiple races, and unknown or not specified). Marital status\nwas coded as either married or other. Educational status was\ncoded as less than the 12th grade, completion of high school\n(or General Education Diploma equivalent), and more than a\n12th-grade education. Health status indicators included a\ngeneral question assessing health status as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor. In the NHIS, a condition count was\ngenerated for any acute condition, chronic condition, or im-\npairment. In the present analysis, ICD-9 and impairment\ncodes were used to exclude from these counts conditions as-\nsociated with the visual and auditory systems (ICD-9 codes\nX09).

The latter was recoded and reported using ICD-9.26 The\nvey years is complete through December 31, 1997, with an av-\nerage follow-up of 7.0 years.28 We used the binary variable (as-\nsumed alive, assumed dead) provided by NCHS to classify\nparticipants' survival status. This classification was based on\nthe matching algorithm developed by the NCHS that assigns a\nnumerical value indicating the probability of a \"true\" match\nbased on information recorded on the death certificate and col-\nlected during the survey (eg, social security number, full name,\nsex, birth month, birth year). This algorithm was developed\nand tested in previous NCHS mortality linkage studies; the NCHS\nestimates that use of the recommended cutoff values for the mor-\ntality linkage will correctly classify more than 97% of NHIS de-\ncedents and more than 99% of NHIS nondecedents.\nANALYSIS\nAll of the analyses were completed using the Software for the\nStatistical Analysis of Correlated Data package to account for\nthe complex sample survey design of the NHIS.29 Software for\nthe Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data takes into account\nthat data from individuals participating in such survey de-\nsigns are not independent since both clusters of households and\nclusters of participants are selected into the sample. The NCHS\ngenerated sample weights for each NHIS participant for use in\nall of the design-adjusted analyses. These weights take into ac-\ncount the probability of selection into the sample, household\nnonresponse to the interview, and poststratification adjust-\nments designed to make the sample more representative of the\nUS population. To account for the aggregation of data over mul-\ntiple survey years, these sample weights were modified in the\npresent analysis by dividing the original weight by 9, the num-\nber of years combined.30 To compare proportions and to as-\nsess associations between nominal variables, 2 analyses were\nused. Cox regression analyses were performed using the Proc\nSurvival procedure in Software for the Statistical Analysis of\nCorrelated Data. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates and the corre-\nsponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides frequency and prevalence rates of re-\nported hearing, visual, and concurrent visual and hear-\ning impairment among participants stratified by socio-\npairment. Male, older, and less-educated participants were\nmore likely to report impairment. Among racial groups,\nparticipants in the other-races group reported the least\nvisual, hearing, and concurrent impairment, and Afri-\ncan American participants reported less hearing impair-\nment as compared with white participants.\nTable 2 presents the sociodemographic characteris-\ntics, reported health status, reported number of nonocu-\nlar and nonauditory conditions, and reported impairment\nstatus of study participants with and without available sur-\nvival status information. Owing in part to the large sample\nsize, all of the 2 tests comparing the distribution of these\nmeasures by available survival status were statistically sig-\nnificant (Table 2). Participants who were older, not mar-\nried, and in the other-races group were more likely to lack\nsurvival status information. The age and sex distributions\nTable 1.

Compared with participants without\navailable survival status, participants with available sur-\nvival status had slightly higher percentages of reported vi-\nsual, hearing, and concurrent impairment.\nTable 3 shows the mortality HRs and the correspond-\ning 95% CIs stratified by race and sex subgroups for all\nof the self- and proxy-reported study participants. These\nrace- and sex-specific analyses were necessary because\nprior analyses of risk of mortality revealed significant in-\nteractions of concurrent reported visual and hearing im-\npairment with race as well as sex. After controlling for\nthe complex sample survey design, age, marital status,\neducational level, self-rated health, and the number of\nnonocular and nonauditory conditions, the HRs for par-\nticipants with concurrent reported visual and hearing\nimpairment in comparison with those with no reported\nimpairment remained significant for all of the white, other-\nrace, and sex subgroups but not for African American men\nor women.

For white men, white women, and African\nAmerican men, but not for African American women, the\nrisk of mortality related to reported concurrent visual and\nhearing impairment is higher than the mortality risk as-\nsociated with either reported visual impairment only or\nhearing impairment only. In comparison with white per-\nsons and African American men, African American women\nhad the highest HR for mortality risk associated with re-\nported visual impairment only and the lowest HR asso-\nciated with reported hearing impairment only, but these\nHRs were not significantly different from those of white\npersons and African American men. The reasons for these\nfindings are not clear. A stronger association between re-\nported visual impairment and increased risk of all-cause\nmortality and cardiovascular disease mortality exists for\nwomen as compared with men.13 However, sex-specific\nmortality risk associated with reported hearing impair-\nment has not been previously examined in a large-scale\nstudy to our knowledge. In the current study, compared\nwith those with no reported visual or hearing impair-\nment, white women with reported hearing impairment\nonly had a slightly higher mortality risk than their male\ncounterparts. In contrast, among African American per-\nsons, this sex difference was reversed: African American\nwomen with reported hearing impairment only had a\nslightly lower mortality risk than their male counter-\nparts. Further research is needed to clarify the relation-\nship between mortality risk and dual or single sensory\nimpairment.\nThere are several advantages to the use of the NHIS.\nThe NHIS is designed to be representative of the US popu-\nlation;onlyinstitutionalizedandmilitarygroupshavebeen\nomitted from direct sampling. Survey response rates were\nexcellent (ie, 95%-98%), and determination of survival\nstatus was available for more than 96% of the partici-\npants. Aggregating data over 9 survey years allowed for\nthe identification of more than 3700 participants with\nreported hearing impairment, and nearly 1500 with re-\nported concurrent visual and hearing impairment, mak-\ning this analysis the largest mortality study to date, to\nour knowledge, to examine associations between re-\nported dual impairment and mortality.\nFew previous studies have examined the associa-\ntions between risk of mortality and concurrent visual and\nhearing impairment owing in part to the relatively large\nnumber of participants required for meaningful results.\nIn the aforementioned National Health and Nutrition Ex-\ndence of concurrent visual and hearing impairment.8 In\nthe risk of mortality after 1 year, in comparison with those\nwithout impairment, was similar for participants with con-\ncurrent visual and hearing impairment (RR=1.18, 95%\nstudy also had low statistical power given that only 15\nparticipants had concurrent impairment. Because of the\nlack of statistical power, sex- and race-specific analyses\nwere not possible in these previous studies.\nIn the present analyses, the greatest risk of mortality\nassociated with reported concurrent visual and hearing\nimpairment was found in participants of the other-race\nsubgroup. This mixed group consisted of Asian or Pa-\ncific Islander (49%), American Indian (15%), and mul-\ntiple and other (36%) races. Men and women of other\nraces with reported concurrent impairment had signifi-\ncantly higher risk of mortality as compared with those\nings suggest that further research in multiple sensory im-\npairment should include races other than white and\nAfrican American to determine why persons of other races\nwith concurrent impairment have higher mortality risk.\nSeveralmechanismshavebeenpostulatedtoaccountfor\nassociations between sensory impairment and mortality.\nThese mechanisms include (1) exposure to factors known\ntoincreasetheriskofsensoryimpairmentandmajorcause-\nspecific deaths (eg, cardiovascular disease), (2) aging, and\n(3) impaired psychosocial functioning.\nNumerous studies have found eye disease to be asso-\nciated with reduced survival, even after controlling for\nent analyses, significant reduction in survival is associ-\nated with reported concurrent visual and hearing impair-\nment in white persons, even after controlling for all of the\ncovariates, including the number of nonocular and non-\nauditory conditions. Taken together, these findings sug-\ngest that exposure to factors known to increase the risk of\nsensoryimpairmentandcause-specificmortalitycannotfully\naccount for the associations between concurrent visual and\nhearing impairment and reduced survival.\nTable 4.

All rights reserved.\nAssociations between sensory impairment and re-\nduced survival as a reflection of poor health or acceler-\nhealth,10 which is itself a predictor of reduced survival\nin numerous studies, including the NHIS,39,40 was in-\ncluded in the present multivariate statistical models as a\npartial control for overall health status. However, sen-\nsory impairment also contributes to the self-rated health\nassessment, and whether sensory impairment serves as\na marker of generalized cellular aging is not certain.41\nAssociations between sensory impairment and mor-\ntality could be mediated by changes in psychosocial func-\ntioning. Visual impairment has been shown to increase\nthe risk of impaired activities of daily living,36,42,43 de-\nis associated with increased social isolation45 and depres-\nsion.46,47 These functional status indicators are them-\nselves associated with either reduced overall survival or\nincreased risk of cause-specific mortality.48-50\nThe present study has several limitations. The NHIS\ndoes not annually assess important risk factors, includ-\ning smoking status, which is associated with disabling\neye conditions such as cataract. The NCHS has never pub-\nlished a study that validated reported chronic condi-\ntions against standardized, physician-confirmed diag-\nnoses. Owing to the self- or proxy-reported nature of\nascertainment of all of the ocular and auditory condi-\ntions in the NHIS, there is likely some misclassification\nof reported visual and hearing impairment. In a study of\n570 persons aged 50 years and older, questions related\nto visual acuity were found to have a sensitivity of ap-\nproximately 82% and a specificity ranging from 87% to\n89%.51 However, visual acuity, contrast and glare sensi-\ntivity, stereoacuity, and visual fields are significant in-\ndependent risk factors for self-reported visual disability\nin the elderly, and visual acuity alone is not the only di-\nmension of subjective visual disability.52 Agreement be-\ntween self-reported hearing loss and pure-tone air-\nconduction audiometry has a sensitivity ranging from 76%\nDifferences between reported impairment and clini-\ncal measures may be owing in part to interpersonal\nvariations in feelings and adaptations to physical dis-\nabilities. This interpersonal variation is taken into ac-\ncount in our analysis by controlling for self-rated health\nin our model because self-rated health itself is related to\nrisk of mortality and reflects the physical and mental\nstate of the person.39\nOnly a few standardized visual and hearing impair-\nment questions were administered in the NHIS. How-\never, respondents who reported impairment were then\nasked a series of questions to determine whether they had\ndiscussed the condition with their health care provider,\nwhether their health care provider assigned a diagnosis\nor named the condition, and whether the impairment af-\nfected the left, right, or both sides. These questions were\nalso asked whenever sensory conditions or impairment\nwere mentioned earlier in the interview. Medical coders\nused this information to determine the level of impair-\nment. Therefore, determination of impairment in the NHIS\nis unique when compared with other self-reported indi-\nces of sensory function in which single items or a stan-\ndardized series of items are used to determine the pres-\nence and extent of impairment.\nValidation studies conducted by the NCHS and others\nsuggest that proxy reports lead to slightly lower preva-\nlence estimates of chronic conditions when compared with\nreportsobtaineddirectlyfromrespondents.57,58 Inthisstudy,\nthe prevalence rates of concurrent visual and hearing im-\npairment for proxy-reported participants were consis-\ntently lower than those for self-reported participants, with\ndifferences ranging from 0.1% to 1.5%. To address this po-\ntential limitation of misclassification of impairment, we re-\npeated our mortality analyses including only the 63% of\nNHISparticipantswhowereintervieweddirectly(Table4).\nIn general, the exclusion of proxy-reported participants de-\ncreased the mortality HRs slightly but did not alter the con-\nclusion of this study. Further, the exclusion of proxy ob-\nservations generally led to larger 95% CIs for the HR\nestimates and resulted in a sample less reflective of the US\ncommunity-residing adult population than the NHIS was\ndesignedtoobtain.Thesefindingsneverthelesssuggestthat\nthe inclusion of proxy reports in the mortality analyses did\nnot lead to systematic bias of the HR estimates for all of\nthe NHIS participants (Table 3).\nTo summarize, after controlling for survey design, age,\nmarital status, educational level, reported health status,\nand number of nonocular and nonauditory conditions,\nreported concurrent visual and hearing impairment is an\nindependent predictor of mortality for both white men\nand white women and for men and women in the other-\nraces category, but not for African American men or Af-\nrican American women. Furthermore, for white men and\nwhite women, the risk of mortality related to reported\nconcurrent impairment is higher than the mortality risk\nassociated with either reported visual impairment or hear-\ning impairment only.\nCorrespondence: Byron L.
