First,\nmortality data. Second, those data were reexamined to\nidentify changes in the ages by which certain proportions of\ndeath occurred. Third, those analyses were refined by adjust-\ning the age at death distribution for estimates of cohort size\ndifferences. Fourth, changes in the age distribution of 8\ncauses of death above age 85 were examined. Finally, the\neffects of cohort size on the highest age at death expected for\ndifferent life tables were evaluated.\nExtinct Cohort Life Tables\nThere are insufficient U.S. data to calculate cohort life\ntables. However, deaths occurring past a given age can be\nsummed to calculate \"extinct cohort\" life tables (Vincent,\ncorded continuously; because medical record information\nis often available, they are generally viewed as more reliable\nthan U.S. census data (Hambright, 1969; Rosenwaike and\nLogue, 1983), being comparable in quality in recent years,\nat least for U.S. Whites, to Medicare data (e.g., Kesten-\nbaum, 1992). Additionally, extinct cohort life table numera-\ntors and denominators are based on the same data, so age\nreporting errors compensate over the ages examined (Man-\nton and Stallard, 1994). Thus, to analyze late age mortality,\nwe first estimated extinct cohort life tables from U.S. White\nsignificantly after Social Security's start in 1935, shortly\nbefore Medicare's start in 1965, and the computerization of\nwas not recorded on New Jersey death certificates.

Third, since the highest docu-\nmented human age is now 121.5, to be conservative we\nexcluded the few deaths reported for age 119 + .

Calculating the cross-sectional age at death distribu-\ntion, ff(y), requires renormalizing d*(y) to 1.0, i.e.,\n= dx\n*(y)/Sd*(y),\nwhere dx\n*(y) = /x\n*(y) q*(y). This is analogous to calculating\nthe life table distribution of deaths (from age 65) from clx\n(which is determined by qx\n),\nor from qx\n:\nf, = dx\n//\"\u00ab.\nBecause 4, = q*(0), the starting distribution (y = 0) is\nwhich differs from r\\ only by the cohort reduction factors, cx\n.\nUsing these relations, we first examined changes in the\nlife table age at death distributions for qx\n(i\"x\n) and qx\n(fx\nis calculated from q*(0) = qx\n. Differences between fx\nand ?x\nreflect both initial cohort size (cx\ns) and survival\ndifferences. If all cohort sizes and prior mortality were the\nsame, then f*(0) = ?x\nand the upper limit to the age at death\ndistribution is fx\n. Differences between ?x\nand fx\nare summa-\nrized by differences in ex\ns, e.g., eM\n- eM\nmillion deaths, has much chance of reaching the absolute\nwhere k = 2. There is a likelihood that\nsomeone reaches the stochastic \"limit\" of 123.\nSetting k = 0 illustrates the effect of biological limits on\nthe age at death distribution, i.e., q*(y) = qx\n= qx\n, for all y\n5= 0. Here, differences in f*(y) are due to the initially larger\ns for older cohorts which cause the age by which a propor-\ntion of deaths occurs to increase linearly for 30 years before\nslowing.\nIf mortality is improving, age differences between pairs of\npercentiles are constant. Age increases for the 90th (or\nabove) percentile of fx\nare not linear after 30 years due to\ndifferences in the cx\nbetween older (up to 7%) and younger\ncohorts (1.5%). If mortality stops improving, it takes 20\nyears for the age for each percentile in fx\nto stop increasing;\nnonlinear changes begin in 10 years. Thus, if U.S. mortality\nreached a biological limit, changes in fx\nto show nonlinearity -- even if cohort sizes increased.\nTo affect fx\n, the distributions of individual life spans have\nto overlap more than ?x\nand fx\nwhere the mean life span is 8 or\n9 years above the mean of the age at death distribution. A life\ncould not be delayed, i.e., most persons above 85 realize\ntheir longevity potential; fx\nimplies 1 in a million persons\nabove 65). The overlap of fx\nand fx\nis smaller than 50% --\nimplying life span limits do not currently affect mortality.\nThis lack of effect is for k = 2 and a life expectancy of about\n89 years. If k = 3, the theoretical limit to life expectancy is\nabout 93 years and the effects of the restrictions take longer\nto emerge.\nChanges in Cause-Specific Age at Death Distributions\nIf there is a fixed life span distribution, there should be\nrapid age increases in the proportions of deaths from causes\noccurring at ages far from the limit -- with little age change\nin percentiles for diseases causing deaths close to the limit. If\nthe limit is due to senescence, and the mean age at death for\neach cause increases, cause-specific distributions should\nbecome increasingly similar, i.e., a general process of se-\nnescence reduces homeostasis so the triggering threshold for\nany cause declines with age. When homeostasis is suf-\nficiently weak, any biological insult causes death, forcing\ncause-specific age of death distributions to converge, i.e.,\nthe average age at death for each cause nears the life span\nlimit. Examining specific causes of death is also useful\nbecause, if there is error in age reporting, unless that error is\ncorrelated with specific causes, it will tend to raise the mean\nage at death from all causes, and be biased toward express-\ning a senescent effect. If causes operate independently (i.e.,\nare not governed by a single limiting process), or are operat-\ning far from the limiting distribution, then changes in their\ndistributions will not be restricted.\nChanges in the U.S. cause of death distributions at late\nages can be examined relative to past mortality trends. Age-\nstandardized heart disease and stroke mortality rates declined\nstandardized cancer mortality rates increased 6.2%. This\nshifted the proportion of deaths in the age-standardized distri-\nbution of deaths from 36.5% to 28.6% for heart disease; from\nThe effects of these changes at later ages are of interest\nbecause cancer and senescence may depend on similar mech-\ndisease and stroke mortality rates declined 28.8% and\n47.6%, respectively -- cancer mortality rates increased\n23.2%. Above 85, the proportion of deaths due to heart\ncause-specific changes for younger ages hold for ages 85 + .\nThis shows the decline in cancer mortality with age -- but\nnot the persistence of the age decline over time. Thus, we\nat death for eight causes above age 85. In addition to heart\ndisease, cancer, and stroke, we selected conditions (e.g.,\ndiabetes; nephritis and nephrosis; lung disease) that may\ntrigger lethal events, or acute morbid sequelae of other age-\nrelated failures (e.g., changes in immunological response\n[pneumonia, septicemia]).

Thus, the pattern of increases in all means and\nstandard deviations shown for all deaths is found for males\nand females separately.\nwhereas cancer (3.3 to 5.4%) increased. For females heart\ndisease deaths did not change (50.9% at both times). Stroke\ndeaths declined significantly (from 15.9 to 9.6%) while\ncancer (2.2 to 3.5%) increased. Thus, the male and female\ncause-specific distributions of deaths at age 100-104 have a\nsimilar structure.\nCohort Size and Mortality Effects on the Maximum\nExpected Age at Death\nEmpirical analyses of life span are limited because we\nonly observe survival outcomes for small cohorts born far in\nthe past. To estimate the maximum age at death expected in a\npopulation, x ^ , we must combine the population's size at\nbirth and a life table describing its mortality.
