Endothelial\nimpairment and vascular dysfunction may\nbe the earliest pathogenetic changes that\noccur in systemic sclerosis.2 Endothelin (ET)\n1 is a potent mitogenic factor produced\nmainly by endothelial cells that interacts\nwith two cell membrane-bound receptors\nETA and ETB.3 Bosentan is an oral com-\npetitive specific dual ETA and ETB receptor\nantagonist4 that is used in the treatment of\ndigital ulcers5 and which is also approved\nfor the treatment of functional class II and\nIII PAH (World Health Organization\nclassification).6\nPatients and methods\npatients aged !18 years with systemic sclero-\nsis (with a negative pregnancy test if female),\ntreated at the Clinical Immunology Unit,\nUniversity of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, were\nenrolled in the study and followed up until\ndigital ulcers were treated with bosentan\ntwice a day. The control group comprised\nthe remaining patients who did not develop\ndigital ulcers. Transthoracic Doppler echo-\ncardiography, 6-min walking distance test,7\nBorg dyspnoea index8 and plasma levels of\n76-amino-acid N-terminal probrain natri-\nuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; a potential\nmarker of heart failure), were performed at\nbaseline and every 12 months during the\nstudy period. Patients who developed PAH\nunderwent right heart catheterization.\nThe primary endpoint was development\nof PAH. Secondary endpoints were a change\nin the 6-min walking distance test, Borg\ndyspnoea index or plasma levels of NT-\nproBNP over the follow-up period.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients. The study was approved\nby the Regional Ethical Committee and\nconducted in accordance with the ethical\nprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki\nGood Clinical Practice guidelines, as well\nas national and international regulatory\nrequirements.\nStatistical analyses\nData were reported as n (%) of patients or\nmean \u00c6 SD. Differences between the two\ngroups were analysed using 2-test or\nFisher's exact test. A P-value 0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nSixty-nine patients with systemic sclerosis\nwere enrolled in the study, of whom 25\ndeveloped digital ulcers and were treated\nwith bosentan. Baseline characteristics of\nthe enrolled patients are given in Table 1.\nThe mean duration of treatment with\nno patients presented with clinical or echo-\ncardiographic indirect signs of PAH in\neither group (sPAP <45 mmHg). There\nwas no statistical difference in mean sPAP\nbetween the two groups at baseline.\nNone of the patients treated with bosen-\ntan developed PAH during the 12-year\n86 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)\nfollow-up period. Furthermore, the mean \u00c6\nSD sPAP significantly decreased from\n1.78 mmHg at the end of the follow-up\nin the control group, seven patients developed\nPAH, confirmed by right heart catheteriza-\ntion, during follow-up, with the mean\u00c6 SD\nsPAP increasing significantly from 33.57\u00c6\n(Figure 1).\nDuring the follow-up period, patients\nreceiving bosentan showed a significant\noverall improvement in the 6-min walking\ndistance test and the Borg dyspnoea index\ngroup, both the 6-min walking distance\ntest and the Borg dyspnoea index values\nshown). NT-proBNP levels significantly\ndecreased in patients receiving bosentan\nand significantly increased in controls (P \u00bc\nshown).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, no patients treated\nwith bosentan developed PAH during the\nfollow-up period, which supports the clinical\nefficacy of long-term bosentan treatment\nin reducing the risk of developing PAH in\npatients with systemic sclerosis. These find-\nings are in agreement with those reported in\na long-term observational study showing\nthe low occurrence of digital ulcers in\npatients with systemic sclerosis receiving\nbosentan for PAH.9 Increased ET-1 activity\ninhibits nitric oxide synthesis, which has\nbeen found to be impaired in patients with\nsystemic sclerosis.10 Bosentan improves\nexercise-induced and flow-mediated pul-\nmonary vasodilatation and thus restores\nendothelial function by increasing nitric\nIn conclusion, long-term treatment\nwith bosentan improves endothelial\nfunction and reduces the risk of PAH\ndevelopment in patients with systemic\nsclerosis.
