    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe opportunity cost of the capital invested in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) to bring a new drug to\nmarket makes up as much as half the total cost. However, the literature on the cost of pharmaceutical R&D is mixed on how,\nexactly, one should calculate this \"hidden\" cost. Some authors attempt to adopt models from the field of finance, whereas\nother prominent authors dismiss this practice as biased, arguing that it artificially inflates the R&D cost to justify higher prices\nfor pharmaceuticals. In this article, we examine the arguments made by both sides of the debate and then explain the cost\nof capital concept and describe in detail how this value is calculated. Given the significant contribution of the cost of capital\nto the overall cost of new drug R&D, a clear understanding of the concept is critical for policy makers, investors, and those\ninvolved directly in the R&D.\n",

Biopharmaceutical innovation is of\nparticular importance given the contribution of new drugs to\ngains in longevity and health-related quality of life.1 Most\npharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is carried\nout by for-profit companies. The primary function of these\ncompanies is to translate biomedical knowledge, much of\nwhich is generated in academic and public sector labs, into\nnew pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. This involves drug\ndiscovery, drug development, clinical testing, manufactur-\ning, and marketing. Pharmaceutical R&D--like other forms\nof R&D--is not free; it is resource intensive. Moreover, drug\nR&D is both risky and time-consuming. Many drug develop-\nment projects fail and there is a lag between expenditure out-\nlays and the receipt of sales revenues for the drugs that\nsucceed.\nThere is a surprising amount of debate regarding the\nresource cost of bringing a new drug to market. Widely\ncited articles by DiMasi and colleagues measures the real\n(inflation-adjusted) cost in the billions of dollars, and,\nunfortunately, they find this cost is rising exponentially.2-5\nOthers place the cost orders of magnitude lower.6-10 There\nare also suggestions that widely cited estimates of the cost\nof new drug development are artificially inflated for politi-\nFinancing costs are a key component of the DiMasi cost\nestimates and account for about half of total costs. These\nfinancing costs, essentially interest on the money (\"capital\")\ntied up during the lengthy and risky R&D process, are par-\nticularly contentious. DiMasi and colleagues use interest\nrates (\"cost of capital\") as high as 11.5%.2,3 Some commen-\ntators suggest that they are zero,11,12 whereas others are\nambivalent, but suggest that if there is a cost of capital, then\nit is as low as 3%.6 The choice of interest rate has a dramatic\neffect on the total cost of developing a new drug, given the\nlag between the outlays on R&D and the point at which sales\nrevenues accrue. For instance, at 11%, a US$1 outlay accrues\nabout US$4 interest after 15 years, but only US$1 interest at\nGiven this controversy, our goal here is to adjudicate on\nthe debate, identify the arguments used by proponents on\neither side of the debate and evaluate their claims, and finally\nassess how the cost of capital is estimated.\n1Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n2University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n3Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, Canada.\n4Eli Lilly and Company, Canada.\nCorresponding Author:\nAyman Chit, Sanofi Pasteur, 1755 Steeles Ave West Toronto, ON\nEmail: ayman.chit@sanofipasteur.com\nWhat Is the Cost of Capital?\nThe cost of financing pharmaceutical R&D is the return\nneeded to entice funders to commit resources to pharmaceu-\ntical R&D instead of other investments. The underlying idea\nis that investors will only commit resources if they expect to\nreceive an amount that they can earn on other equally risky\ninvestments. The amount that can be obtained elsewhere\nconstitutes the investor's \"opportunity cost\" of capital.\nThe notion of the opportunity cost of capital is widely\naccepted within economics, although, as we discuss below,\nthe methods used to estimate its value are contested. But\nsome outside of economics, and even some economists\nthemselves, dispute the concept. In particular, the noted aca-\ndemic physicians Relman and Angell12 and Angell11 suggest\nthat there is no opportunity cost of capital because pharma-\nceutical firms \"have no choice but to spend money on R&D\nif they wish to be in the pharmaceutical business.\"11(p45) This\nstatement is correct, as far as it goes. But investors will pro-\nvide funds to any venture only if they anticipate receiving\nsufficient compensation for delaying consumption and incur-\nring the risk of potentially losing some or all of their capital.\nInvestors in pharmaceutical firms, that is, shareholders, only\nwish to be in the pharmaceutical R&D business if they\nreceive as much in compensation as they do in other equally\nrisky ventures. Microeconomist David Friedman explains\nthe underlying theory (p. 205):\nA steel mill cannot be converted into a drainage canal--but an\ninvestor can decide whether he will use his savings to pay\nworkers to build the one or the other. So the anticipated return on\nall investments--the interest rate--must be the same. If investors\nexpected to make more by investing a dollar in building a steel\nmill than by investing a dollar in digging a drainage canal,\ncapital would shift into steel; the increased supply of steel would\ndrive down the price of steel and the return on investments in\nsteel mills. The reduced supply of capital in canal building\nwould, similarly, increase the return on investments in canals.\nInvestors would continue to shift their capital out of the one use\nand into the other until the returns on the two were the same\nIt is instructive to assess the consequences to firms that\nfail to generate sufficient returns. Drug companies can raise\nfunds to finance R&D projects from several sources. First,\nthey can use retained earnings, that is, gross profits generated\non sales of their existing drugs that are not returned to share-\nholders in the form of dividends. Second, they can borrow\nfunds from lenders in the bond market. Third, the company\ncan sell stock that it itself holds, or issue new shares of the\ncompany (diluting the value of existing shares). If firms are\nunable to develop new drugs that drug plans and consumers\nare willing to pay for, either from bad luck14-18 or incompe-\ntence, then their pool of retained earnings will eventually dry\nup. Lenders will be hesitant to lend money, or will demand a\nsubstantial risk premium, if they perceive the default risk to\nbe high. The company's share price, a harbinger of future\nprofits, will decline, reducing the revenue potential from\nselling new or existing stocks. Such a company will eventu-\nally go bankrupt or be at risk of takeover by another firm that\nbelieves the company is being mismanaged. The firm pursu-\ning the takeover buys as much stock as possible, enough to\nlet it take over the company, fire most of its executives, and\ninstall competent replacements. If the firm is successful,\nearnings and the market value of the company's stock both\nLight and Warburton6 also take issue with the notion that\nthe opportunity cost of capital is a legitimate resource cost.\nThey write,\n. . . experts argue that innovative companies must do R&D, and\nthis is a regular cost of doing business; so estimated profits\nforegone should not be added to out-of-pocket costs . . . If\nrevenues are coming in from other products, then the [R&D]\ncosts are recovered as one goes along. (p. 8)\nThis argument again fails to recognize that retained earn-\nings, like other types of investment funds, have a variety of\nvaluable uses. If those with a claim to the retained earnings\n(ie, shareholders) do not anticipate generating sufficient\ngross profits from pharmaceutical R&D, they will move their\nfunds to other ventures. The secular decline in antibiotic drug\ndevelopment is a telling illustration; this decline reflects, in\npart, reduced anticipated sales revenues owing to antibiotic\nstewardship initiatives on the part of prescribers and a com-\nmensurate shift to other therapeutic classes.19,20\nLight and Warburton6 further state, \"Even if one were to\naccept the argument that profits foregone should be included\nas a `cost,' US government guidelines call for using 3 per\ncent, not the 11 per cent used by DiMasi and colleagues.\"\nFigure 1. Cumulative return on US$1 investment, compounded\nannually, by years since investment and by percentage rate of\nreturn.\nChit et al 3\n(p. 164) Three percent might be the appropriate cost of capi-\ntal for government, but the return required for private inves-\ntors contemplating allocating funds to pharmaceutical\nventures is, as we discuss in further detail below, much\nhigher. Indeed, most studies place the private cost of capital\nfor the pharmaceutical industry to be 8% or higher.21\nEstimating the Private Cost of Capital\nHow is a drug company's cost of capital estimated? One\nmust first determine how much of the company's operations\nare financed by debt (capital from bondholders) versus\nequity (capital from shareholders). The relative amounts of\ndebt and equity financing within a public company can be\nascertained by reviewing public financial reports, which by\nlaw must disclose the relative amounts.\nThe opportunity cost of the two sources of funds is differ-\nent. The opportunity cost of debt is simply equal to the preset\ninterest rate agreed to between the corporation and its lenders\n(bondholders). Shareholders face more variable returns than\nlenders; there is no predetermined return on investments and,\nin the event of insolvency, shareholders are paid last. To esti-\nmate the opportunity cost of financing projects through\nshareholder equity, the investment community relies on\nfinancial models. Chief among these is the capital asset pric-\ning model (CAPM). The CAPM was developed by William\nkey articles by DiMasi and colleagues all estimated the cost\nof capital using this approach.\nCAPM estimates the opportunity cost of investing in firm\ni, also known as firm i's \"cost of equity capital,\" as the sum\nof the risk free rate of return (RFR), normally measured as\nthe return on US government bonds, and firm i's equity risk\npremium. Formally, according to the CAPM, E(R\ni\n), the\nexpected cost of equity capital for firm i is\ni\n( ) = + ( )\n( )\ni\n - .\n\ni\n, the \"beta\" for firm i, determines firm i's equity risk\npremium; firms with larger beta values require larger returns.\nFirm i's beta reflects the historical correlation between the\nreturns on firm i's shares and the returns from the stock mar-\nket as a whole. The expected market-wide return, E(RM), is\nsubject to undiversifiable risks, such as the risks that come\nfrom macroeconomic downturns. If firm i's returns are\nhighly correlated with returns in the stock market as a whole,\nthen firm i's beta will be large. This would be the case, for\ninstance, if firm i produces a good or service whose sales are\nparticularly sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. A good\nexample is a firm that rents out construction equipment; such\na firm faces undiversifiable risks that are greater than that of\nthe stock market as a whole. Conversely, a firm with a beta\nof zero means that the firm's share returns are completely\nuncorrelated with the market returns. Sales of such a firm are\ninsulated from the market-wide systemic risk. Thus, in sum-\nmary, a firm's cost of equity capital depends on the risk free\nrate--the higher this is, the higher the opportunity cost to the\ninvestor of assuming the risks of holding equities--and firm\ni's equity risk premium, which measures the sensitivity of\nfirm i's returns to the market-wide systemic risks.\nThe forgoing describes the cost of equity capital for a par-\nticular firm. The cost of equity capital for an industry can be\nestimated with the same formula, by weighting the individ-\nual firms' betas by the relative market value of each firm in\nthe industry. Beta statistics can also be calculated by sector.\nDamodaran23 recently estimated the beta for the US health\ncare products sector as a whole as 0.99. Thus, health care\nproduct suppliers have a risk profile that is close to the stock\nmarket average. Pharmaceutical firms have betas that are\nslightly higher, 1.03. Biopharmaceutical firm betas are 1.10.\nConstruction supply firms have betas of 1.60. Beta values for\npublic companies are routinely reviewed and updated for use\nby investment portfolio managers and others in the financial\nsector. These values are periodically published by various\nfinancial reporting companies such as Thomson Reuters,24\nThe cost of capital that firm i faces is the weighted aver-\nage of the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital.\nThe pharmaceutical industry relies almost exclusively on\nequity capital,2-4,10 so the cost of capital for the industry mir-\nrors the cost of equity capital. This is because, pharmaceuti-\ncal firms specifically, and technology companies more\ngenerally, contend with market imperfections that makes\nborrowing unattractive to them.27 The problem is one of\ninformation asymmetry between the pharmaceutical firm\nand its potential lenders. Given the technical nature of phar-\nmaceutical technology, the firm will always have a better\ngrasp of the quality and riskiness of their projects than poten-\ntial lenders. This causes lenders to ask for a premium above\nwhat they would charge firms with a more lucid set of busi-\nness projects. The fact that very few pharmaceutical firms\ntake any debt at all indicates that the cost of debt is too high;\notherwise, many firms would take advantage and leverage\nthe expansion of operations and R&D through affordable\ndebt.\nOf course, not all of the resources that the industry con-\nsumes are financed privately. Governments also finance a\nportion of industry-sponsored pharmaceutical R&D via tax\nsubsidies. And the cost of capital for government--estimated\nto be in the range of 3% to 7% for developed countries28--is\nlower than that for private companies. This government cost\nof capital is essentially equal to the RFR described earlier.\nCorporations and government contributed 57% and 39%,\nrespectively, of the total biomedical R&D spend in the\n4% coming from charitable donations.29 Most of the govern-\nment support is focused on early-stage discovery R&D;\nDiMasi3 suggests that tax credits contribute only a small\namount of the in industry directed R&D.\nWhat, then, are we to make of the cost of industry capital\nestimates that account for about half of DiMasi and col-\nleague's estimated cost of bringing a new drug to market?\nOur reading of the literature is that, if anything, these esti-\nmates are conservative. The reason is that the CAPM model,\nwhich was used to generate estimates of the pharmaceutical\nindustry cost of equity capital, tends to provide conservative\nestimates. In particular, other models, which relax some of\nthe assumptions underlying the CAPM model, tend to pro-\nduce higher cost of capital estimates. For instance, the lead-\ning competitor to the CAPM model, the Fama and French\n(F-F) 3-factor model, considers company size and company\n\"health\" beyond just what is included in CAPM. The F-F\nmodel produces higher risk premia for smaller companies\nand for companies that are judged to be in poor \"health,\" as\nmeasured by a relatively high book equity to market equity\nratio. Indeed, Vernon and colleagues have compared cost of\ncapital estimates using CAPM and F-F and found the latter\nwould produce higher costs of capital.30\nAs another example, Giaccotto et al relax another of the\nCAPM assumptions, and again obtain higher estimates of the\ncost of equity capital. The assumption they relax concerns\nthe unique time profile of sales revenues of pharmaceutical\nfirms, with sales growing over time until generic firms enter,\nat which time sales drop markedly. The CAPM implicitly\nassumes that sales follow a random walk. The authors find\nthat relaxing this assumption increases the cost of capital for\nsome pharmaceutical firms by as much as 2.8%.31\nIn conclusion, capital is a scarce resource and, like any\nother scarce resource, there is an opportunity cost associated\nwith its use. The opportunity cost of capital invested in drug\ndiscovery, development and commercialization is the return\nrequired to compensate investors to invest in time-consum-\ning and risky R&D. There are standard methods in the field\nof finance to produce estimates of the opportunity cost of\ncapital for various firms and sectors of the economy. The\npharmaceutical cost of capital estimates used by DiMasi and\ncolleagues are consistent with both economic theory and\nfinancial accounting practice.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nAyman Chit and Manny Papadimitropoulos are currently employed\nby pharmacutical firms.
