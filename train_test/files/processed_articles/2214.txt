The analysis for this study was based on two waves of data (Wave 1, 1986 and Wave 2,\n1989) of the Americans' Changing Lives Survey. The results revealed that social relationships, social in-\ntegration and attendance at religious services influence the number of drinks and cigarettes smoked per\nday among adults. Parental influence varies by gender. The implications for social control, social net-\nworks and gender perspectives are discussed.\nKeywords: Gender and Substance Use; Social Relationships and Substance Use; Gender and Social\nRelationships\nIntroduction\nDevelopmental and life-course perspectives on crime suggest\nthat contextual factors in life and events and choices throughout\nthe life course influence patterns of delinquency (Farrington,\n2005) age-graded life-course theory of crime and other social--\ncontrol perspectives suggest that family and religion may be\nespecially important influences on patterns of delinquency be-\ncause they are primary sources of social control, support and\nintegration. In a recent study, Petts (2009) used data from the\nNLSY79 to examine whether family and religious characteris-\ntics influence individual-level delinquency trajectories from\nearly adolescence through young adulthood. The results suggest\nthat residing with two parents deter youths from becoming de-\nlinquent and that supportive parenting practices reduce their\nlikelihood of becoming involved in delinquent behavior early in\nadolescence. Although numerous studies have examined the\nrelationship between family and religion on delinquency, there\nhave not been studies of the relationship between parents,\nfriends and religion on substance use among adults. This study\nexamines the effects of social relationships, social integration\nand attendance at religious services on the number of drinks\nand cigarettes smoked per day among adults based on two\nwaves of data of the Americans' Changing Lives Survey.\nGender and Substance Use\nStudies on substance use have implicated gender as an im-\nportant determinant of behavior and outcomes (Horwitz &\ndicts that men and women would adopt similar patterns of\ndrinking as their social roles converge (Bell, Havlicek, & Ron-\non the logic of the convergence hypothesis, role-related changes\nconnected to women's labor force participation would not only\nchallenge traditional family roles, but would also transform the\nattitudes of both men and women in other domains, including\nthe appropriateness of certain types of social behavior, such as\nnack, Wilsnack, & Klassen, 1984). Contrary to the convergence\nhypothesis, adolescent and adult males still drink more fre-\nquently and consume larger quantities of alcohol than their\namine gender differences in alcohol consumption and cigarette\nsmoking among adults.\nPeer Relationships\nPeer relationships are considered the primary factor involved\nin whether youth decide to engage in and maintain substance\niors (Epstein et al., 1999). Several studies have found that sub-\nstance--using youth more likely to have substance-using\ncapital that is available in open networks produce advantages\nfor teenagers and young adults (Kim & Schneider, 2005; Mor-\neffects of open and diffused networks and pointed out that with\nthe freedom afforded by open networks, other important rela-\ntions (e.g. strong ties and significant others) can have their in-\nfluence enhanced. We apply this logic to suggest that satisfying\nrelationship with friends could reduce substance use. Sampson\nand colleagues (2006) found that adult relationships affect pat-\nterns of delinquency net of selection factors.\nReligious Involvement\nAccording to Smith (2003), religious institutions provide re-\nsources, such as support networks and teaching to help indi-\nviduals cope with and find meaning in stressful events. These\nresources may be especially beneficial to adults who are at high\nrisk for substance use. Rohrbaugh and Jessor (1975) identify\nseveral processes of internalized social control through which\npersonal religiosity may influence behavior. They maintain that\nreligion sensitizes individuals to moral issues and acceptable\nstandards of behavior, and it offers a deity as a source of pun-\nishment and wrath. Thus, active religious involvement should\nfoster an interest in abiding by religious precepts. High reli-\ngious participation should be related to reduce substance use\nbecause the fear of divine punishment would make a person\nless likely to disobey the rules of the faith. Most studies on the\nassociation of religion with substance use have found an in-\nverse, contemporaneous relationship (e.g., Bowie, Ensminger,\nSocial Integration\nBaum and Ziersch (2003) point out that the multidisciplinary\nliterature on individual and public health labeled \"social capi-\ntal\" research equates social capital with other relationship-based\nconcepts such as social networks, social support, social integra-\ntion, and social cohesion. Brissette, Cohen and Seeman (2000)\nnoted that social integration is the extent of participation in\nsocial networks, indicated by active engagement in social roles\nand social activities, and cognitive identification with network\nintegration theory posits that involvement in formal and infor-\nmal organizations supply social support and peers which foster\na positive sense of the self. Hirschi (1969) maintains that at-\ntachment to organizations works as a social control. We exam-\nine the impact of social integration on substance use.\nHypotheses\nWe propose sets of hypotheses based on theoretical interests.\nThe first set of hypotheses states that social relationships have a\nnegative impact on substance use. Specifically, a positive rela-\ntionship with mother, father and friends decreases the number\nof cigarettes and drinks per day. Second set of hypotheses state\nthat formal and informal social integration decrease substance\nuse. The stronger the formal and informal social integration, the\nless smoking and drinking. The third hypothesis asserts that\nfrequency of attendance at religious services decreases sub-\nstance use. As religious attendance increases, substance use\ndecreases. Fourth, we hypothesize that the positive effects of\nsocial relationships, social integration and religion on substance\nuse would be stronger for women than men. Fifth, we expect\nsocial relationships to interact with religious attendance to re-\nduce substance use. For example, those people who have a\npositive relationship with their mother and frequently attend\nreligious services would drinks less and smoke fewer cigarettes.\nSixth, formal social integration may provide greater social con-\ntrol and attachment; therefore, it is expected to have a stronger\nimpact on substance use than informal social integration.\nWe control for race, education, and income. According to\nBachman et al. (2002), individuals who juggle the duties and\nresponsibilities related to work, marriage, and parenthood sim-\nply have less time available to engage in drinking behavior.\nMany studies have found a strong protective effect of marriage\non substance use and abuse (for a review, see Rhule-Louie &\nMcMahon, 2007). Cross-sectional studies have found economic\nresources to be inversely related to drug use in adulthood (e.g.,\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse). Research studies over the\npast several decades have found cigarettes use to be concen-\ntrated among lower education, occupational prestige, and in-\ncome groups (Barbeau, Krieger, & Soobader, 2004; Honjo et al.,\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe data come from the Americans' Changing Lives Survey,\na stratified, multistage area probability sample of non-institu-\ntionalized adults age 25 and older living in the coterminous\nUnited States with over-sampling of both adults age 60 and\nolder and African Americans. The wave 1 was conducted in 1986\nand consisted of face-to-face interviews with 3617 respondents\n(representing 70% of sampled households and 68% of sampled\nindividuals). Wave 2 conducted in 1989, also involved face-to-\napproximately 7.5 years after baseline, wave 3 was conducted\nvia telephone or face-to-face interviews with 2562 participants\nor their proxies (representing 83% of wave 1 survivors). Addi-\ntional information on the study design is published elsewhere\nstudy was based on data from T1\nVariables\nDependent Variables\nWe use two dependent variables for this study: 1) number of\ndrinks per day; and 2) number of cigarettes per day. The survey\nitem asked respondents to report how many drinks that had per\nday and how many cigarettes they smoked per day. Each mea-\nsure is coded as a simple count.\nIndependent Variables\nIndependent variables of theoretical interest include rela-\ntionship with mother, father and friends. Mother relationship is\nan index of the quality of interaction with one's mother. The\nrespondent was asked to report on four questions which asked\nthe extent to which there are too many demands from mother,\ncritical of mother, love and care for mother (reverse scored) and\nwill listen to mother (reverse scored). The responses ranged\nfrom (1) almost always to (4) never. These same four questions\nwere asked for father and friend and were used to create a scale\nfor father relationship and friend relationship. The reliability for\nmother relationship T1\n(Cronbach's alpha = .64) and T2\n(Cron-\nbach's alpha = .63). For father relationship, the reliability at T1\n(Cronbach's alpha = .58) and T2\n(Cronbach's alpha = .56). The\nreliability for friend relationship at T1\n(Cronbach's alpha = .59)\n(Cronbach's alpha = .59).\nSocial Integration\nInformal social integration is an index that combines two\nquestions. The respondent was asked \"In a typical week, about\nhow many times do you talk on the telephone with friends,\nneighbors or relatives\". The second question asked \"How often\ndo you get together with friends, neighbors or relatives and do\nthings like go out together or visit in each other's homes?\" The\nresponses ranged from (1) more than once a day to (6) never\nand they were reverse scored. The Cronbach's alpha = .85 at T1\n.\nFormal social integration also is a two-item index. It consists\nof the following two questions: \"How often do you attend meet-\nings or programs of groups, clubs or organizations that you\nbelong to?\" and \"How often do you participate in leisure or\nsocial activities by yourself or with people other than your\nspouse/partner?\" For both questions the responses were reverse\nscored and ranged from (6) more than once a week to (1) never.\nthe Cronbach's alpha is .84 and at T2\nReligious Involvement\nFrequency of attendance at religious services is a one item\nmeasure which asks the respondent \"How often do you usually\nattend religious services?\" The responses ranged from (1) more\nthan once a week to (6) never and was reverse scored such that\na 6 represents a high frequency of attendance.\nControl Variables\nControl variables include age, gender, employment status,\nincome, marital status and race. Age is coded in years and edu-\ncation is measured as total years of completed education. Gen-\nder (female = 1, 0 = male) and employment status (employed =\n1, 0 = not employed). Income was measured as the combined\nincome in the preceding year from all sources for respondents\nand their spouses in dollars. Marital status is coded (married =\n1, 0 = not married). Race is five dummy variables that distin-\ntive Americans (N = 138), Asians (N = 33) and Hispanics (N =\nThe analysis was conducted in three stages. First, models\nwere estimated that included demographic control variables,\nsocial relationships, social integration, religious involvement\nthat predict drinking and cigarette use. Second,\nwe estimated models of social relationships, social integration,\nreligious involvement drinking and cigarette use separately for\nmales and females for T1\n. Finally, we estimated model\nof the full sample that included a multiplicative term involving\nsocial relationships (mother, father and friend relationship each\nseparately) and attendance at religious services on number of\ndrinks and cigarettes smoked per day.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the regression results at T1\nfor number of\ncigarettes and number of drinks at T1\nwith control variables\nincluded.

Equation\n2 indicate that education, age, and gender are significant pre-\ndictors of number of drinks per day; the highly educate and\nthose older are significantly less likely to drink heavily while\nmen are significantly more likely to drink heavily compared to\nwomen. The marginally significant coefficient for married\nsuggests that those who are married have a tendency to drink\nless than the non-married. It is noteworthy that relationship\nwith mother is a marginally significant predictor of number of\ndrinks per day even with all of the control variables included in\nthe model. Thus, there is a tendency for those people who have\na positive relationship with their mother to drink less. However,\nonly ten percent of the variance is explained in number of ciga-\nrettes and drinks per day with the control variables included.\nThe regression results for T2\ncontrol variables on number of\ncigarettes and number of drinks per day are shown in Table 2.\nEducation and age are the significant predictors of number of\ncigarettes smoked per day and suggest that the highly educated\nare significantly less likely to smoke heavily whereas as people\nget older they are more likely to smoke heavily. Equation (2)\nreveals that education, age, gender, married are significant pre-\ndictors of number of drinks per day and indicate that the edu-\ncated, people who are older and those married are significantly\nless likely to smoke heavily. The significant coefficient for\ngender shows that men drink more than women. With the con-\ntrol variables included, relationship with father is a significant\npredictor and relationship with mother is a marginally signifi-\ncant predictor of number of drinks per day. Thus, those people\nwho have a positive relationship with their fathers are signifi-\ncantly more likely to drink heavily while those who have a\npositive relationship with their mother have a tendency to drink\nless drinks per day. The results for the control variables are\nBased on our hypothesis and the significant coefficient for\ngender, we ran the models separately for men and women at T1\n. The regression results for women are presented in Ta-\n, frequency attend religious services is the only\nsignificant predictor of number of cigarettes smoked per day\nand suggests that those women who frequently attend religious\nservices are significantly less likely to smoke heavily. Rela-\ntionship with mother is the only significant predictor of number\nof drinks per day and indicates that those women who have\npositive relationships with their mothers are significantly less\nlikely to drink heavily. These results support our hypothesis. At\n, number of cigarettes smoked per day at T1\nand relationship\nwith mother is the significant predictors of number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day. Those women who smoked heavily at T1\nare\nsignificantly more likely to smoke heavily at T2\n, while those\nwomen who have a positive relationship with their mothers at\nare significantly more likely to smoke heavily at T2\n. These\nresults contradict our hypothesis. However, number of drinks\nper day at T1\nis the only significant predictor of number of\ndrinks per day at T2\nindicating that those women who drank\nRegression coefficients predicting number of cigarettes and drinks per day with control variables T2\n.\nCigarettes T2\nEquation (1) Equation (2)\nIndependent Variable\nCoeff Std error Beta Coeff Std Error Beta\nMother relationship T2\nFather relationship T2\nFriends relationship T2\nAttend religious services T2\nWorking T2\nNote: **significant at p < .01.\nRegression coefficients predicting number of cigarettes and drinks per day for women T1\n.\nEquation 1 Equation 2\nCigarettes Drinks\nIndependent variable Coeff Std Error Beta Coeff Std error Beta\nCigarettes Drinks\nDrinks per day T1\nCigarettes per day T1\nNote: **significant at p < .01; *significant at p < .05.\nheavily at T1\nare significantly more likely to drink heavily at T2\n.\n, the variables explain twice as much variance in number\nof cigarettes smoked compared to number of drinks per day (41\nand 20 per cent respectively).\nTable 4 shows the regression results for men of number of\ncigarettes and drinks per day at T1\nthere are no\nsignificant predictors of number of cigarettes smoked or num-\nber of drinks per day for men. However at T2\n, number of ciga-\nrettes smoked per day at T1\nis a significant predictor and sug-\ngests that those men who smoked heavily at T1\nare significantly\nmore likely to smoke heavily at T2\n. Relationship with mother is\na marginally significant predictor and indicates that those men\nwho have a positive relationship with their mothers have a ten-\ndency to smoke less. As expected number of drinks at T1\nis a\nsignificant predictor which suggests that those men who drink\nheavily at T1\nare significantly more likely to drink heavily at T2\n.\nRelationship with mother and relationship with father are sig-\nnificant predictors of number of drinks at T2\n. Most interesting,\nhowever, is that those men who have a positive relationship\nwith their mothers are significantly less likely to drink heavily,\nbut those men who have a positive relationship with their fa-\nthers are significantly more likely to drink heavily. These vari-\nables explain almost twenty per cent more variance in number\nof cigarettes smoked per day compared to the number of drinks\nper day (R2 = .57 and .39, respectively). These results provide\nmixed support for our hypothesis that women would benefit\nmore from social relationship, social integration and frequency\nof attendance at religious services than men in terms of reduc-\ning substance use. There is an unexpected change in the rela-\ntionships from T1\nand an unexpected within gender social\nrelationship effect by substance use. Relationship with mother\nreduces drinking at T1\nbut increases smoking at T2\nfor women.\nHowever, relationship with father has no effect on smoking or\ndrinking for women at T1\n. In contrast, relationship with\nmother has no effect at T1\nbut reduces smoking and drinking at\nfor men. It is interesting that, relationship with father has no\neffect on number of cigarettes smoked but increases drinking at\nfor men.\nWe tested the interaction between social relationship and\nfrequency attended religious services at T1\nfor number\nof cigarettes smoked per day and number of drinks per day. At\nonly the interaction between relationship with friend and\nfrequency attend religious services was significant. The sig-\nnificant interaction between relationship with friends and fre-\nquency attend religious services indicates that those people who\nhave positive relationships with friends and frequently attend\nreligious services are significantly less likely to drink heavily.\nThe interaction between relationship with friends and frequency\nattend religious services support our hypothesis that family and\nreligion interact to reduce substance use. The interaction be-\ntween relationship with mother and frequency attend religious\nservices on number of drinks per day is the only significant\nRegression coefficients predicting number of cigarettes and drinks per day for men T1\n.\nEquation 1 Equation 2\nCigarettes Drinks\nIndependent variable Coeff Std error Beta Coeff Std error Beta\nCigarettes Drinks\nDrinks per day T1\nCigarettes per day T1\nNote: **significant at p < .01.\ninteraction at T2\n. This interaction indicates that those people\nwho have positive relationships with their mothers and fre-\nquently attend religious services are significantly less likely to\ndrink heavily. This interaction supports our hypothesis that\nfamily and religion interact to reduce substance use. However,\nwith the interaction term included, there is very little variance\nexplained in number of cigarettes and number of drinks per day\n(data not shown, available upon request from author).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study revealed that social relationships,\nsocial integration and attendance at religious services influence\nthe number of drinks and cigarettes smoked per day for two\nwaves of a nationally representative survey for older Americans.\nA person's relationship with their mother and father has differ-\nent impacts on smoking and drinking behavior. These findings\nsupport Sampson and colleagues (2006) finding that adult rela-\ntionships affect patterns of delinquency net of selection factors.\nThe lack of a significant effect for relationship with friends\nsuggests that peer relationships may not have an influence on\nadult substance use. The findings support general social control\nand religion are primary sources of social control, support and\nintegration.\nThe positive effect of formal social integration on substance\nuse supports Hirschi's (1969) contention that attachment to\norganizations works as a social control. The significant effects\nfor frequency attend religious services on smoking and drinking\nare consistent with Neil and Kahn's (1999) observation that\nengagement with religious communities might also benefit\nolder adults in particular by providing opportunities for sociali-\nzation and social support in later life. Similarly, Levin and\nTaylor (1997) suggest that older adults may have been social-\nized to value religiosity and spirituality more than younger\npeople.\nOur study highlights the importance of family and interper-\nsonal relationships as forms of social supports that impacts\nsubstance use. Moreover, we found that relationship with mo-\nther has the most consistent and persistent effect on substance\nuse, and that the positive effect vary by substance use (drinking\nvs. cigarettes) and by gender. The relationship with mother for\nwomen was positive for drinking and negative for smoking, but\nit was positive for men whether drinking or smoking. The rela-\ntionship with father was not a significant factor for women and\na negative factor for men for drinking. These findings may\nreflect gender differences in methods of coping with stressful\ninterpersonal family relationships and gender differences in\nsocial support in substance use. The quality of relationships\nadults have with their parents may contribute to substance use\nand abuse and impact treatment, social support and the stigma\nassociated with substance use. Future research needs to include\nrelationships with parents as a source of social integration by\ngender, race, and age when examining substance use and abuse.\nConclusion\nThis study's finding that relationship with mother increased\ncigarette smoking for women and relationship with father in-\ncreased drinking for men are suggestive of the research studies\nthat found that bonds to parents can increase substance use\namong children (Fleming et al., 1997; Foshee & Bauman,\nory of crime and social control perspectives can be used to\nunderstand the impact of parents, friends and religion on sub-\nstance use among adults. In addition, the results of our study\nsupport the convergence hypothesis and suggest that the envi-\nronmental influences on gender roles are prevalent among adult.\nThe findings highlight that gender ideology, which defines\nexpectations regarding the \"appropriate\" performance of male\npeople change their gender roles and ideologies both between\nand within generations (Wentworth & Chell, 2005) are impor-\ntant to understand the role that gender plays in understanding\nsubstance use and abuse especially among adults.\nThe major limitations of the present study are lack of ade-\nquate measures of social network related to smoking and drink-\ning and lack of social network level measures such as centrality\nand density of networks. Measures that directly link social rela-\ntionships to smoking and drinking would clarify the nature of\nthe effects, especially over time. Future research should also\nexamine late-onset drinking and smoking on social relation-\nships and social integration among adults. A multiple item\nmeasure of religious participation or religiosity would enhance\nour understanding of the role that religion plays in reducing\nsubstance use or abuse.\n"
