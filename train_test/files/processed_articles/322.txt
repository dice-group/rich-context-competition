Alan Dever\n Key words: diabetes awareness, race, abdominal obe-\nsity, glycemic control, diabetes treatment\nIntroduction\nA large body of epidemiological evidence has shown that\nabdominal obesity is a more potent risk factor for many car-\ndiovascular diseases (CVDs) than generalized obesity (1\u00ad6).\nIn a recent study of the prevalence of abdominal obesity in the\nUnited States, we estimated 24 million adult men and 40\nmillion adult women suffered from abdominal obesity (7). The\ntendency of both abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes to\ncoexist (8\u00ad11) suggest that the high prevalence of type 2\ndiabetes in the United States may be caused by the high\nprevalence of abdominal obesity, particularly among non-\nHispanic blacks and Hispanics (7). Abdominal obesity is\none of the factors in the constellation of plurimetabolic\nabnormalities termed insulin resistance syndrome (8\u00ad14).\nOther factors of the insulin resistance syndrome are hyper-\ntension, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, glucose\nintolerance, and hypertriglyceridemia (9\u00ad14).\nAvailable data show that non-whites experience rates of\ntype 2 diabetes and end-stage sequelae of diabetes that are\nhigher than those experienced by whites (15\u00ad17). Micro-\nvascular complications of the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and\nlower extremity amputations are also more common among\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics than non-Hispanic\nwhites (18\u00ad20). Although the reasons for these racial/ethnic\nAccepted for publication in final form September 9, 2002.\nDepartment of Community Medicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence to Ike S.

Because of the destruc-\ntive nature of diabetes (organ damage), understanding\nawareness, treatment, and control rates in different popula-\ntion groups and the impact of abdominal obesity are imper-\native in designing prevention regimens for various popula-\ntions. However, much of the available research has been\nrestricted to the role of generalized adiposity rather than the\nmore potent abdominal obesity.\nDespite racial/ethnic differences in the rate of abdominal\nobesity, no studies have investigated the impact of abdom-\ninal obesity in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic\ncontrol in American adults. Many studies investigating di-\nabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control have\nused liberal definitions of type 2 diabetes (22) and body\nmass index (BMI) as a measure of adiposity (23,24). Be-\ncause the proposed connection between abdominal obesity\nand CVD may be caused by the initiating effect of abdom-\ninal obesity for glucose intolerance (25), we hypothesize\nracial/ethnic differences in rates of diabetes awareness,\ntreatment, and glycemic control. We also theorize that be-\ncause of the potent nature of abdominal obesity, subjects\nwith larger than expected waist girths would be more likely\nto be aware of their diabetes status, seek treatment for\ndiabetes, and also would be more likely to maintain good\nglycemic control.\nWe took advantage of Third U.S. National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to describe\nand compare racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes\nawareness, treatment, and glycemic control in American\nadults. The National Institutes of Health anthropometric\nsurrogate measure (waist circumference) of abdominal obe-\nsity and the new American Diabetes Association criteria for\nAssociation Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Clas-\nsification of Diabetes Mellitus redefined type 2 diabetes as\ndiagnosed diabetics on insulin or other hypoglycemic\nagents, a fasting blood sugar (FBG) value of 126 mg/dL or\ngreater, or a 2-hour postglucose load (PGL) of 200 mg/dL or\ngreater in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (26). In\nthis study, we also sought to determine the impact of ab-\ndominal obesity in diabetes awareness, treatment, and gly-\ncemic control in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nand Hispanic-American adults.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nData Source\nThe National Center for Health Statistics provided the\nNHANES III data that were used in this study. The sampling\nand measurement procedures have been described extensively\nin detail previously by other investigators (27,28). Briefly,\nNHANES III is a multistage probability sample of noninstitu-\ntionalized U.S. population groups defined and examined in\nfied as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic\nAmerican were eligible for this investigation.\nBecause blood postprandrial glucose analysis was done\nonly among adults 40 years of age and older in NHANES\nIII, this study was restricted to this age group for whom\nhealth insurance status and anthropometric variables, in-\ncluding weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were\nobtained. This study was further restricted to subjects for\nwhom glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c\n) levels were as-\nsayed in NHANES III. Weight was measured at a standing\nposition using a Toledo self-zeroing weight scale (Seritex,\nCarlstadt, NJ). Height was measured at a standing position\nwith a stadiometer. Waist measurement was made at the nat-\nural waist midpoint between the lowest aspect of the rib cage\nand highest point of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm.\nDetails of the methods used for blood collection and\nplasma glucose assays have been described elsewhere by\nother investigators (29,30). Briefly, plasma glucose was\nmeasured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method\nlevel was assayed using high-performance\nliquid chromatography as used by Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trials.\nGiven that the prevalence of type 1 diabetes varies mark-\nedly with race/ethnicity and is much higher in undiagnosed\nnon-Hispanic whites than the other two groups, it is unlikely\nto be undiagnosed or be denied and presumably will always\nbe treated because type 1 diabetics are more aware of their\ndiabetes status. Thus, the non-Hispanic whites are likely to\nhave higher treatment and probably better control than\nHispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Hence, in this analysis,\nsubjects with type 1 diabetes were excluded.\nThose who were excluded because of missing variables\nof interest were not different from the population examined\nin our study.\nDefinition of Terms\nType 2 diabetes was defined as diagnosed diabetics on\ninsulin or other hypoglycemic agents or FBG value 126\ndominal obesity was defined as WC larger than expected\n(measured waist girth minus girth predicted from BMI)\n(31). Predicted WC values were calculated from residuals\nobtained from linear regression of WC on BMI. For men,\nthe residuals were obtained from the following equation:\nresiduals for women were obtained from the following\npositive residuals represent abdominal obesity adjusted for\ngeneralized adiposity (31).\nIn NHANES III, subjects were asked the following ques-\ntion: have you ever been told by a doctor that you have\nAbdominal Obesity and Diabetes, Okosun and Dever\ndiabetes or sugar diabetes? Diabetes awareness was defined\nas answering yes to the question. Diabetes treatment was\ndefined as current use of insulin and other anti-diabetic\nmedications. Glycemic control was defined using glycosy-\nlated hemoglobin levels (32). Good glycemic control was\ndefined as HbA1c\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical programs available in SPSS for Windows\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) were used for this analysis (34).\nBecause of the complex sampling technique used for\nNHANES III, the SUDAAN statistical program (Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to\nobtain variance estimates. Differences in anthropometric\nvariables, blood glucose, and other continuous variables\nwere assessed by comparing mean values for subjects with\nabdominal obesity and subjects lacking abdominal obesity,\nstratified by race/ethnicity and gender.\n2 statistics were used to test differences in diabetes\nawareness, treatment, and glycemic control across adiposity\nstatus. Rate of diabetes awareness was calculated as the\nnumber of diabetics aware of their diabetes divided by total\nnumber of diabetics defined as diagnosed diabetics (FBG\nOGTT). Rate of diabetes treatment was calculated as num-\nber of diabetics receiving anti-diabetic medication divided\nby the total number of diabetics aware of their diabetes\nstatus. Rate of glycemic control was calculated as the num-\nber of diabetics with HbA1c\n8% divided by the number of\ndiabetics aware of their diabetes status.\nRace/ethnic and gender specific multiple logistic regres-\nsion analyses were performed to determine the impact of\nabdominal obesity in racial/ethnic variations on diabetes\nawareness, treatment, and glycemic control. Statistical ad-\njustments were made for age, education, alcohol intake,\nsmoking, and health insurance coverage. Ninety-five per-\ncent confidence limits and p values were calculated and\nused to establish statistical significance.\nResults\nSubject characteristics for the 3038 non-Hispanic whites,\neligible for this investigation are summarized in Tables 1\nand 2. Generally, men and women with abdominal obesity\nwere older, taller, and heavier as measured by weight than\nsubjects without abdominal obesity. Men and women with\nabdominal obesity also had larger waist girths than subjects\nwithout abdominal obesity. There were no significant racial/\nethnic differences between subjects with abdominal obesity\nand those without abdominal obesity in terms of generalized\nbody fatness as determined by BMI. However, non-His-\npanic black women presented with overall mean fatness\nequal to the obesity levels as defined by National Institutes\nof Health and World Health Organization (23,24). Subjects\nwith abdominal obesity were less educated than subjects\nwithout abdominal obesity (p  0.05).\nAs expected, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Hispanics with abdominal obesity had higher values of\nFBG and OGTT than those without abdominal obesity (p \nTable 1.

Overall, only 212 (3.5%) eligible subjects for this\nstudy did not have health insurance coverage. There were no\nstatistically significant racial/ethnic differences with respect\nto number of subjects lacking health insurance coverage.\nThere were statistically significant racial/ethnic differ-\nences in rates of type 2 diabetes (Figure 1) in abdominally\nobese and nonabdominally obese subjects.

In men, abdom-\ninal obesity was not significantly associated with diabe-\ntes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control. In men,\nincrease in age was associated with decreased diabetes\nawareness in non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Higher\neducational attainment was associated with increased di-\nabetes awareness in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, and Hispanic men. Smoking was associated with\nincreased diabetes awareness and glycemic control in\nnon-Hispanic white men. Alcohol intake was associated\nwith increased glycemic control in non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men. Having health\ninsurance coverage was also associated with increased\ndiabetes treatment in non-Hispanic white men and non-\nHispanic black men. In women, increase in age was\nassociated with decreased diabetes awareness in Hispan-\nics. Increased education was associated with diabetes\nawareness in women of the three racial/ethnic groups,\nand health insurance coverage was associated with in-\ncreased diabetes awareness in non-Hispanic black women\nand increased glycemic control in non-Hispanic white\nand non-Hispanic black women.\nWe tested the contribution of abdominal obesity in racial/\nethnic variations in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glyce-\nmic control, adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol use, and health\ninsurance status (Table 4). Hispanic men had decreased dia-\nbetes awareness, whereas non-Hispanic black and Hispanic\nmen had decreased glycemic control, relative to non-Hispanic\nwhite men, adjusting for abdominal obesity and other con-\nfounding variables. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women\nFigure 2: Diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control in\nnormal and abdominally obese (abdobesity) non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Hispanic Americans.\nAbdominal Obesity and Diabetes, Okosun and Dever\nhad decreased diabetes awareness and glycemic control, rela-\ntive to non-Hispanic white women, adjusting for abdominal\nobesity and other covariates. Adjusting for abdominal obesity,\nsmoking was also associated with increased diabetes aware-\nness and glycemic control in both men and women.\nDiscussion\nA large body of epidemiological data now suggests\nthat abdominal obesity is the most important adiposity\nphenotype that is associated with CVD (1\u00ad6). First de-\nscribed as gynoid and android body habitus some 40\nyears ago (35), the exact role of abdominal obesity in\nCVD is not clear. However, the role of abdominal obesity\nin type 2 diabetics may be connected with its high degree\nof correlation with visceral adiposity (35). Visceral adi-\nposity is the component of body composition that is most\nhighly associated with components of the insulin resis-\nTo our knowledge, no studies have described the impact\nof abdominal obesity in racial/ethnic differences in type 2\ndiabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control in\nAmerican adults. This is also the first study to examine\ndiabetes awareness, treatment, and control in subjects suf-\nfering from abdominal obesity defined as a larger than\nexpected waist circumference. Understanding racial/ethnic\ndifferences in diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic\ncontrol is critical in implementing efficient diabetes man-\nagement in different population groups. Being national and\nrepresentative in scope, NHANES III represents an excel-\nlent data source for investigating racial/ethnic variations in\ndiabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic control. The\nquality control measures instituted in NHANES III give an\nadded credence to the data.\nIn this study, there were racial/ethnic differences with\nrespect to diabetes awareness, treatment, and glycemic\ncontrol in abdominally and nonabdominally obese Amer-\nicans. Subjects with abdominal obesity were found to\nhave poorer glycemic controls compared with those with-\nout abdominal obesity. Rates of diabetes awareness were\nhigher in non-Hispanic whites with abdominal obesity\ncompared with non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics with\nabdominal obesity. Non-Hispanic whites with abdominal\nobesity had significantly better glycemic control and\nhigher treatment rates than non-Hispanic blacks and His-\nTable 3.

Relative to non-Hispanic\nwhites, the result of this investigation shows that being\nHispanic was associated with decreased diabetes aware-\nness and glycemic control, adjusting for abdominal obe-\nsity. Relative to non-Hispanic white women, being a\nnon-Hispanic black woman was also associated with de-\ncreased diabetes awareness and glycemic control, adjust-\ning for abdominal obesity.\nThe observed high rates of diabetes awareness in both\nsubjects with abdominal obesity and subjects without\nabdominal obesity in this study are similar to the findings\nof Gnasso et al. (38) based on a population from southern\nItaly. With the exception of glycemic control in non-Hispanic\nblack women, rates of diabetes awareness, treatment, and gly-\ncemic control were higher in subjects without abdominal\nobesity compared with subjects with abdominal obesity.\nTable 4.

(38). However, unlike Gnasso et al.\n(38), we found significant associations between smoking\nand diabetes awareness in non-Hispanic white men and\nbetween smoking and glycemic control in non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men.\nThe factors behind the lack of awareness of diabetes or\npoor glycemic control by women with larger than expected\nwait circumference are not clear and warrant further inves-\ntigation. Because of the potent nature of abdominal obesity,\nwe expected that subjects with larger than expected waist\ngirths would be more likely to be aware of their diabetes\nstatus, seek treatment, and maintain a better glycemic con-\ntrol than subjects who do not have larger than expected\nwaist girths. The reason for the positive association between\nsmoking and the dependent variables in this study is also not\nclear and may be related to concomitant diseases.\nSome limitations are noteworthy in the interpretation of\nresults from this study. First, bias because of survey non-\nresponse and missing values for some variables cannot be\nruled out. However, previous studies of National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys have shown little bias be-\ncause of nonresponse (39). Second, in this study, residuals\nfrom the linear regression of WC on BMI were used to\nestimate abdominal obesity. Although it may be argued that\nusing the recommended WC cut-points (40\u00ad43) would have\nbeen more intuitive because they are more often used in the\nliterature, we choose to use residual values because the\nrecommended WC cut-points were determined using other\npopulations. Indeed, our previous studies show racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the WC cut-points that are associated with\nsome CVD (44). However, the validity and reliability of\nresiduals against other measures of abdominal obesity such\nas magnetic resonance imaging are not known and warrant\ninvestigation. Third, the exclusion of subjects having dia-\nbetes managed with diet in our definition of diabetes treat-\nment could potentially bias the results because management\nof type 2 diabetes with diet is not uncommon. Fourth, some\nimportant chronic complications variables of diabetes in the\ndifferent groups were not included in this study. Diabetes\nawareness is expected to increase among subjects with\nestablished chronic diseases, such as ischemic heart disease.\nFifth, it may be argued that using HbA1c\n8% for the\ndefinition of good glycemic control may have introduced\nbias into our analysis because this was not the standard\nrecommended by any established guideline at the time\nNHANES III data were collected. However, using the above\ncut-point value provides valuable information about the\nstate of glycemic control of subjects at the time of survey\nbased on the current guideline. Sixth, several well-known\nfactors that can have impact on diabetes (e.g., diet and exer-\ncise) were not examined. These unmeasured risk factors may\nhave significant implications in the magnitude of the observed\ndifferences of the association between abdominal obesity\nand diabetes awareness, treatment and glycemic control.\nThe lower prevalence of abdominal obesity in non-Hispanic\nblacks, particularly non-Hispanic black women, despite higher\nBMI is consistent with the findings of Lovejoy et al. (45),\nDuncan et al. (46), and Conway et al. (47). The implication of\nthis paradox for the observed higher prevalence of type 2\ndiabetes and CVD in non-Hispanic blacks compared with other\npopulations warrants further study. The poor glycemic control\nfor non-Hispanic black men that was observed in this study is\nconsistent with what has been observed with respect to blood\npressure control in black men (48). This observation may be\nattributed to cultural and gender differences in the use of health\ncare systems. According to some investigators, absence of\nfinancial difficulty, described in terms of full medical insur-\nance coverage, does not offer advantage to health care use in\nsome ethnic groups (49). Other investigators have argued that\nracial/ethnic differences in disease awareness, treatment, and con-\ntrol may be a function of patient self-care and physician medical\npractices rather than the influence of race or ethnicity (18).\nDiscussion\nThe result of this investigation indicates that racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the prevalence of diabetes may be partially\nexplained by their differences in diabetes awareness, treatment,\nand glycemic control. The lower rates of diabetes awareness,\ntreatment, and glycemic control in non-Hispanic blacks and\nHispanics, despite having higher prevalence of diabetes com-\npared with non-Hispanic whites, suggests crafting diabetes\nawareness, treatment, and glycemic control programs accord-\ning to racial/ethnic origins. The lack of significant positive\nassociation of abdominal obesity with diabetes awareness,\ntreatment, and glycemic control in these populations groups\nmay indicate lack of knowledge about the harmful effect of\nabdominal obesity. Racially/ethnically sensitive public health\nmessages may help to increase diabetes awareness, treatment,\nand glycemic control in these population groups.\n"
