    "abstract": "Abstract\nChess is thought to be a game demanding high cognitive abilities to be played well. Although many studies proved the link\nbetween mastery in chess and high degree of intelligence, just few studies proved that chess practice can enhance cognitive\nabilities. Starting from these considerations, the main purpose of the present research was to investigate the potential\nbenefits of in-presence chess lessons and on-line training on mathematical problem-solving ability in young pupils (8 to 11\nyears old). Five hundred sixty students were divided into two groups, experimental (which had chess course and on-line\ntraining) and control (which had normal school activities), and tested on their mathematical and chess abilities. Results show\na strong correlation between chess and math scores, and a higher improvement in math in the experimental group compared\nwith the control group. These results foster the hypothesis that even a short-time practice of chess in children can be a useful\ntool to enhance their mathematical abilities.\n",

In particular, some of them\nhave investigated the correlation between these two variables\nsuggesting that the chess players' population (both adults and\nchildren) is more intelligent than the general one (Doll &\n1990). This evidence, however, does not necessarily lead to\nthe conclusion that chess improves intelligence because the\ndirection of the causality is uncertain (Gobet & Campitelli,\n2002). In fact, there are several possible alternative explana-\ntions for that: A high IQ could be the cause of a high chess\nability (and not vice versa); in other words, an intelligent indi-\nvidual achieves a high chess ability just because chess requires\na high degree of intelligence, but it does not increase it; or,\nalternatively, high-IQ people could be \"selected by the game\"\nmuch more easily than others: Subjects playing chess can find\nout that they are good at the game, so they are encouraged to\ncontinue to play it. However, whoever turns out to be not so\ngood at chess can be discouraged to play it again. In this case,\nchess \"selects\" motivated people with a high IQ who are able\nto play well (Gobet & Campitelli, 2006).\nBeyond the question of direction of causality, the more\ngeneral problem of the transfer of skills must be held in\nconsideration. If the former problem is addressable by using\na proper experimental design (experimental and control\ngroups; pre- and post-tests), the latter represents a theoretical\nproblem since the seminal work ofThorndike andWoodworth\n(1901). Their theory of identical elements states that the\ntransfer of cognitive abilities, from a domain to another one,\noccurs only when the domains share common elements. This\nimplies that the transfer of skills is quite rare and limited to\nthe extent that there is an overlap between the domains\nSome studies have shown that this applies to the game of\nchess too. In her classical study, Chi (1978) demonstrated\nthat chess players' memory skill for chess positions did not\nextend to digits recall. Schneider, Gruber, Gold, and Opwis\n(1993) replicated the study and obtained the same outcomes.\nMore recently, Unterrainer, Kaller, Leonhart, and Rahm have\nfound that chess players'planning abilities did not transfer to\nthe Tower of London, a test assessing executive function and\n1University of Liverpool, UK\n2University of Milan, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nGiovanni Sala, Brownlow Street, Liverpool L69 3GL, UK.\nEmail: giovanni.sala@liverpool.ac.uk\nMathematical Problem-Solving Abilities\nand Chess: An Experimental Study on\nYoung Pupils\nGiovanni Sala1,2, Alessandra Gorini2, and Gabriella Pravettoni2\n Keywords\neducation, social sciences, achievement, science, math, and technology, curriculum, educational research, education theory\nand practice, educational psychology, applied psychology, psychology, cognitivism, approaches, experimental psychology\n2 SAGE Open\nplanning skills (Unterrainer etal., 2011); in Waters, Gobet,\nand Leyden (2002), chess players' perceptual skills did not\ntransfer to visual memory of shapes; and finally, chess abili-\nties did not correlate with performance in a beauty contest\nexperiment (B\u00fchren & Frank, 2010). All these studies have\nsuggested that transfer is, at best, improbable, and that chess\nplayers' special abilities are context-dependent.\nGiven that the more specific a skill is, the less that skill is\ntransferable to another domain; nevertheless, it is reasonable\nto suppose that a game requiring attention, logical thinking,\nplanning, and calculation abilities would be able to improve\nat least some of the aforementioned abilities, which are\nlinked to the problem-solving competence and, overall, to\ngeneral intelligence, at the beginning of their development.\nPut simply, if chess players' abilities do not transfer to other\ndomains, it is not impossible that chess helps children devel-\noping the above abilities, especially when these latter are yet\nto be fully developed, and still general enough to allow the\ntransfer.\nThis hypothesis is supported by those studies investigat-\ning the effect of the chess courses on children's mathematical\n2012a). Such studies have found that children attending\nchess lessons show significant improvements in mathemati-\ncal abilities. This is even true for low-IQ subjects: Scholz\nand 85, attending 1 hr per week of chess lesson instead of 1\nhr of mathematics, performed significantly better in addition\nand counting than children who did not receive chess les-\nsons; Hong and Bart (2007) found a correlation between\nchess ability and non-verbal intelligence in students at risk of\nacademic failure, suggesting that chess ability can be a pre-\ndictor of improvement in cognitive abilities; Barrett and Fish\nvices, divided in 2 groups: One had chess lesson once a week\ninstead of a lesson of mathematics, whereas the other one\nhad two lessons per week of mathematics, but no chess les-\nson. This study showed that the chess group improvements in\n\"number, operations and quantitative reasoning\" and in\n\"probability and statistics\" were significantly higher than\nthose obtained by the other group who did not attend any\nchess activity. Similar results have also been found in pupils\nwith normal IQ and without specific disabilities (Kazemi\nthese studies, positive effects of chess appeared after at least\netal. (2012), which investigated the effects of a chess course\non children's (third graders in Trinchero, 2012b, fifth, eighth,\nninth graders in Kazemi etal.) mathematical problem-solving\nability, deserve a particular attention. Both of these studies\nhave found a significant improvement in problem-solving\nscores in chess-trained children compared with children who\nhave not performed any chess-related activity. These results\nsuggest that chess could increase not only basic mathematical\nabilities (as calculation or addition) but also competences,\nsuch as mathematical problem-solving abilities. Starting\nfrom these data, the aim of the present study was to verify\nwhether a blended strategy (Trinchero, 2013) consisting in a\n10- to 15-hr chess course supported by a computer-assisted\ntraining (CAT) is able to improve mathematical problem-\nsolving ability in children in a shorter time compared with\nother previous studies. Assuming that at least some chess\nabilities can be transferred from chess to the mathematical\nproblem-solving domain, our hypothesis is that the chess-\ntrained children group will show a significantly higher\nimprovement in mathematical problem-solving skills com-\npared with children who did not receive any chess training,\nand among the subjects who received chess training, those\nwho used the CAT more will show a higher improvement.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nThe study was conducted on a total of 31 classes (third,\nfourth, and fifth grades) from 8 different schools of Northern\nItaly. The classes were randomly assigned to two groups,\nincluding 17 classes in the experimental group and 14 in the\ncontrol group.\nThe experimental group included 5 fifth-grade classes, 10\nfourth-grade classes, and 2 third-grade classes for a total of\nninety-three children included in this group declared to be\nable to play chess before the beginning of the study. The con-\ntrol group included 6 fifth-grade classes, 3 fourth-grade\nclasses, and 5 third-grade classes for a total of 251 partici-\nthis group declared to be able to play chess before the study.\nStudy Design\nStudents in the experimental group received a mandatory\nchess course based on the SAM (Scacchi e Apprendimento\ndella Matematica; Chess and Maths Learning) protocol\n(design by the Italian Chess Federation instructorsAlessandro\nDominici, Giuliano d'Eredit\u00e0, Marcello Perrone, Alexander\nWild; for further information, see www.europechesspromo-\ntion.org). In addition, each pupil in the experimental group\nwas provided with a free software, named CAT (see\nTrinchero, 2012a, for further details), for learning the game\nof chess every time he or she wanted. The use of CAT was\nnot mandatory, yet highly recommended. The pupils of the\nexperimental group were given the opportunity to play CAT\nat home. Two variables were recorded by CAT: time of utili-\nzation and level achieved.\nOn the contrary, students in the control group performed\nonly the normal school activities without any chess-related\nactivity. The chess courses lasted between 10 and 15 hr (1 or\n2 hr per week, according to the schedule and the availability\nSala et al. 3\nof the schools involved), and were conducted by three Italian\nChess Federation teachers. The teaching program and the\nmethodology were exactly the same for each course. Courses\nwere aimed at teaching the basic rules and tactics of the game\n(material value, checkmate patterns, basic endgames).\nAll students (both in the experimental and in the control\ngroups) were tested before and after the intervention using\nthe seven Organisation for Economic Co-Operation\nand Development\u00adProgramme for International Student\nAssessment (OECD-PISA) items (Organisation for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development, 2009), a vali-\ndated instrument to assess mathematical problem-solving\nabilities with several degrees of difficulty (see Table 1), and\na 12-items questionnaire to assess chess abilities (Trinchero,\n2013; see Table 2). Time between the pre- and post-test eval-\nuation was 3 months.\nThe design of the study is summarized in Table 3.\nThe main limitation is the lack of a placebo group, that is,\na group whose participants undergo alternative intervention.\nThe two-groups design does not allow to understand whether\nthe potential improvement in math performance was due to\nchess-specific or chess-unspecific factors. It is possible that\nother non-specific ludic activities, demanding attention and\nslow thinking, can increase mathematical problem-solving\nabilities as well. The second limitation is that the number of\npupils declaring to be able to play chess is significantly\ngreater in the experimental group than the control one. It is\nadvisable, for future studies, to select participants from not-\nchess-players samples, or to match the numbers of players\nbetween groups to better control this variable. The third limita-\ntion is that chess lessons were administered by three different\ninstructors. This was necessary for organizational needs, but\nwe tried to control it asking the three instructors to follow the\nsame didactic protocol throughout all the chess courses.\nFinally, the classes were randomly assigned to the two\ngroups, but the single student were not (that is, every student\nremained in his/her regular school class). Nevertheless, it\nmust be noticed that organizing a well-designed experimen-\ntal research in educative contexts is difficult, and randomiz-\ning students without their classes is often a non-acceptable\npractice in schools due to organizational reasons.\nResults\nData were analyzed using a series of t tests, mixed linear\nmodels, and correlation analyses.\nThe two groups were equal in terms of mean age: M(e) = 8.99\nTable 1.

The experimental group performance in the post-test was significantly higher than in the pre-test, whereas the control group did not show any\nimprovement.\nSala et al. 5\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesis of the study, according to which the mathe-\nmatical problem-solving scores gain in the experimental\ngroup would be significantly higher than the one in the con-\ntrol group, is confirmed. Moreover, we found that both the\nchess scores and the CAT level achieved by the students in\nthe experimental group were significantly correlated with the\nmathematical problem-solving scores. Because part of proto-\ncol was not mandatory, that is, CAT activities at home, it is\npossible that those who played CAT more (in terms of time)\nwere more motivated by chess, and hence the better mathe-\nmatical scores. However, only the level achieved by the\npupils proved to be correlated to math post-test scores,\nwhereas time of utilization did not. If we assume that the\ntime spent playing CAT was, to a certain extent, a measure of\nthe participants' motivation toward chess, then this seems to\nsuggest that motivation was not a crucial factor of math\nresults. On the contrary, chess ability, assessed by chess\nscore and CAT level achieved, proved to be more reliable at\npredicting math scores. In summary, these results show that\na blended strategy of intervention (in-presence chess lessons\nfollowed by home training) can be effective both to teach\nchess and to enhance mathematical abilities. These outcomes\nare impressive considering that, compared with the previous\nstudies based on 25/30 hr of chess lessons, our intervention\nconsisted only in 10/15 hr of in-presence chess teaching\nactivities.\nGiven these results, how can the education and practice of\nchess affect the logical\u00admathematical abilities of the young\npupils? To answer this question, we can hypothesize that the\nintrinsic feature of the game can be the cause of the phenom-\nenon to be explained. Chess is based on some mathematical\nelements as the values and the geometrical movements of the\npieces. According to Scholz etal. (2008), the practice of the\ngame can convey some notions of the mathematical domain\nas the concept of numerosity. Throughout a chess game, a\nchess player is requested to pay attention to the material\nadvantage (or disadvantage) because, together with the two\nKings safety, it is the most important aspect of the game.\nMaterial advantages are calculated by summarizing all the\nwhite and black pieces' values (every piece has a specific\nvalue, depending on how it moves); the comparison between\nthese two sums gives the players the basic criterion for the\nevaluation of the chess position:\nThis conception fits well in the context of positive conditions for\ntransfer [\"Low road transfer happens when stimulus conditions\nin the transfer context are sufficiently similar to those in a prior\ncontext of learning to trigger well-developed semi-automatic\nand Salomon (Perkins & Salomon, 1994), since the strength of\nthe chess pieces can be used as a metaphor for numbers. (Scholz\nIn other words, chess could have the power to \"material-\nize\" some mathematical abstract concepts so that children\ncan learn and manage them much more easily. In Kazemi\netal. (2012), a similar explanation is given:\nWhen students experience the subtlety and sophistication of\nchess play, upon encountering complex and subtle matters, they\noften associate or link these two elements and discover the logic\nand subtlety of mathematics. In reality, this complexity may take\ntangible or real forms for students (p. 378).\nThis is also consistent with the concept of embodiment of\nmathematical elements described in Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez\nFigure 2. Results of the two groups in chess ability.\nNote. Only the experimental group improvement was statistically significant.\n6 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, chess, by its nature, is a game that forces\nplayers to use skills that go beyond the simple calculation of\nvariations, or mere mnemonic exercises: Playing chess is an\nexercise of competence. A chess player must monitor his\nown strategies and, therefore, his own thoughts, focus on\ndetail, and use abstraction and generalization, even at ama-\nteur level. The positions appearing on the chessboard during\nthe game are problems to be solved by choosing a move or a\ncombination of moves. In addition, the absence of the alea-\ntory element forcefully leads players to attribute the cause of\ntheir success (or failure) to the quantity and quality of their\neffort and their own strategic choices, promoting the empow-\nerment process. In other words, a chess player becomes\naware of his own self-effectiveness. According to Trinchero,\nchildren's attentive skills could be enhanced by the practice\nof the game of chess, and this fact could explain the improve-\nments in mathematical problem-solving abilities related to\ngame practice: \"this difference may be due to the increased\ncapacity of the pupils of reading and interpret correctly the\nmathematic problems, apply their mathematic knowledge\nand reflect on their own actions and strategies, as effect of\nWe can summarize the above concepts by saying that\nchess increases mathematical problem-solving skills because\n(a) math and chess are isomorphic domains; by playing\nchess, math concepts are made less abstract and thus more\nmanageable; (b) a chess player must use high skills as plan-\nning, abstract thought, calculation of variants, monitoring of\nstrategies, and thoughts that are necessary in mathematical\nskills; (c) a chess player perceives the victories and defeats\nas a result of his choices on the board, the correctness of\nwhich is proportional to the practice and the efforts of the\nplayer himself; this is supposed to increase the empower-\nment of the player and, consequently, the confidence in his\nown abilities; (d) the chess player becomes aware of the\nnecessity of enduring attention, addressed to both the simple\nelements of the game and to the dialectical relationship\nbetween elements; attention that is already potentially pres-\nent in the participant, but that the actual environment and\nhabits tend to reduce; (e) chess is an amusing and rewarding\nactivity that encourages children to play more. In other\nwords, chess gets a \"virtuous circle\" started, and this circle\ncan be very useful also to develop good mathematical\nabilities.\nThis explanation is realistic because it can be compatible\nwith two opposite paradigms about the conditions under\nwhich cognitive transfer happens and, in a vaster perspec-\ntive, about the features of human intelligence. Logical skills\n(and intelligence) can be considered context-dependent or\ncontext-independent. In the first case, the problem-solving\nability is strictly linked to the domain of application; thus, a\nparticipant can show problem-solving skills as good in a\nfield of knowledge and as bad in another one. In the second\ncase, logical skills are universal and disconnected from the\ncontext of application. According to the latter perspective,\nthe human intelligence is the sum of several basic abilities\nthrough which higher competences, such as problem-\nsolving, arise. The issue is still debated.\nAs we previously said, the assumption subtending our\nhypothesis is that some abilities can be transferred from\nchess to the mathematical domain. Transfer can occur when\nthere is a certain degree of overlap between the two domains,\nand the extent of the transfer itself is limited to that degree\n(Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901). Thus, the more specific\nknowledge becomes, the more difficult transfer of skills can\narise (Ericsson & Charness, 1994), and the ability in a cer-\ntain task depends on the context of application. In these\nterms, it is unlikely that chess can be useful to teach\nmathematics.\nNevertheless, several authors think that the transfer is\npossible because of the general nature of the cognitive pro-\ncesses: a fluid intelligence (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, &\ntraining can boost some basic abilities easily generalizable to\nmathematics domain (because of the similarity between the\ntwo domains), then it is possible that chess improves a higher\ncompetence such as mathematical problem solving. In other\nwords, the problem of the transfer is played on a trade-off\nbetween generality skill and a sufficient isomorphism\n(Atherton, 2007) between the nature of the domain in which\nthe pupil exercises the skill and the new domain into which\nthe skill can be transferred; a trade-off between universality\nand specificity (Sala, 2013). Thus, the two perspectives\nshould not be considered irreconcilable. The question is, in\nwhat ratio is a certain competence based itself on general\ncognitive abilities and in what ratio on a domain of applica-\ntion? Regarding chess, the data, currently, do not allow to\ninfer the answer.\nIt is possible to suppose that chess is a sort of medium\nthrough which some cognitive abilities are boosted. A theo-\nretical framework for this hypothesis could be the concep-\ntion of intelligence described by Feuerstein, Feuerstein,\nFalik, and Rand (2006). According to this perspective, intel-\nligence is a repertoire of universal cognitive functions, able\nto operate on every content. Some of these functions such as\nthe \"precision and accuracy in the data collection,\" the \"abil-\nity to understand the existence of a problem,\" the \"ability to\ndistinguish relevant from non-relevant data,\" the \"need of\nlogical proves,\" and the \"planning behavior\" are necessarily\nneeded during a chess game. For example, a chess player\nsearching for a checkmate combination has to realize that the\nposition on the chessboard offers that opportunity, has to col-\nlect the data very carefully (a single piece or square not con-\nsidered and the combination could fail), has to select the\nrelevant data (not necessarily all the pieces are involved), has\nto plan the combination considering the foe's defense\nchances, and needs to prove the cogency of his inference. All\nthese functions contribute to solving the chess problem and,\nin a more general sense, are undoubtedly involved in every\nfield of problem-solving application.\nSala et al. 7\nIf the assumption of a repertoire of universal cognitive\nfunctions, context-independent and thus applicable to sev-\neral domains, is accepted, then it is necessary to ask for the\nreason why chess is one of the ideal mediums. The afore-\nmentioned features of the game (aleatory component null,\nneed of heuristic thought, similarities with mathematics\ndomain) are essential, but it must be considered that chess is\na content itself. According to Feuerstein etal. (2006), a cog-\nnitive function has to be trained with a specific content,\nselected for its intrinsic features. The content must not be so\nunfamiliar to invest a great effort that would take precious\ncognitive resources and would not allow the pupil to concen-\ntrate on the function to strengthen. However, the content\nmust not be too familiar either, because it would not be able\nto induce a state of attention in the pupil; so he would not\nmobilize his cognitive resources because of the lack of intrin-\nsic motivation. Chess could be an ideal medium because it is\nfamiliar enough: It is a board game, quite known, and based\non quantity, calculation, and planning, which are concepts\nalready experienced by children in school; however, chess is\na game compelling and new for most of the children involved\nin a chess course, so it is simple to induce passion for it.\nFurthermore, it is important to underline not only the\nintrinsic features of the game of chess but also the method\nthrough which chess is taught. If it is assumed that a chess\ncourse is a tool to boost problem solving or similar abilities,\nthen a chess teacher is supposed to propose activities selected\non purpose. In this sense, it is important to note that, although\nin the present study, the number of pupils declaring to be able\nto play chess in the pre-test is higher in the experimental\ngroup (193) than in the control group (72), and, consequently,\nchess scores are higher in the experimental group pre-test,\nthe mathematical problem-solving scores of the experimen-\ntal group are not significantly different. This fact can be\nexplained by saying that the mere knowledge of chess basic\nrules (as the movement of the pieces) is by far insufficient to\ntrain cognitive skill. It is hard to see why knowing that the\nRook can move vertically and horizontally, for example,\nshould improve children problem-solving skills, or any other\nintellectual skill. On the contrary, knowing how to find the\nshortest path from one square to another one for the Rook, or\nknowing whether it is worth to give up a Rock for a Queen,\nis a more demanding task for the intellectual skills of the\npupil. A pupil playing a chess game moving the pieces cor-\nrectly (that is, according to the rules), but without any plan or\ncalculation, does not use any problem-solving ability.\nOn the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that a pupil\nplaying a chess game moving the pieces according to a strat-\negy (albeit ingenuous or shallow for an expert chess player)\nand paying attention to the dynamic relationships between\nthe pieces is training his or her problem-solving ability.\nFurther studies are needed also to deepen our knowledge\nabout the effect of chess training on cognitive abilities. We\ncan consider three main lines of research: (a) the study of the\ncognitive processes subtending the outer phenomenon, that\nis, the amelioration in mathematical problem-solving com-\npetence; (b) the long-term effects of chess training on math-\nematical abilities; and (c) the comparison between chess and\nother mathematical games.\nThe first line refers to the already discussed issues: If it is\npossible to state that a chess course, with a proper didactic\nprogram and methodology, improves children mathematical\nproblem-solving abilities, it is not yet possible to say exactly\nwhy this happens. Which are the cognitive skills strength-\nened by chess? Just a few experimental studies directly\nassessed the increments of some cognitive abilities after a\nchess intervention. In the study of Scholz etal. (2008), the\nexperimental group did not improve in the concentration\nabilities, suggesting that the amelioration of the experimental\ngroup calculation scores was not due to the increase of the\nconcentration of the participants. However, it must be con-\nsidered that the participants of that study were children with\nIQ (70-85) lower than the average of the population, so that\nsample could not be representative for the general popula-\ntion. In the study of Kazemi etal. (2012), the participants\nwere tested, after a 6-month chess course, to assess their\nmeta-cognitive abilities, along with their problem-solving\nskills: The researchers found a significant advantage for the\nexperimental group (who received the chess course) both in\nthe meta-cognition scores and in problem-solving scores.\nThis fact leads to think that the meta-cognitive abilities\nboosted by chess practice can be successfully transferred into\nmathematics domain.\nThe second line of research, suggested by Gobet and\nCampitelli (2006), is necessary to assess the endurance of\nchess training benefits during the 2 or 3 years. To date, fol-\nlow-up data related to chess and its educational benefits do\nnot exist. If these benefits disappeared, for example, 1 year\nafter the intervention, then chess would not be an educational\nuseful tool. If the transfer is possible only when there is an\noverlap between the two domains, then an activity getting\nmore and more specific, at a certain point, becomes ineffec-\ntive, because it insists on capacities not shared by the two\ndomains, and thus not transferable. So, it is likely that the\nbenefits of the chess training diminish with the second or the\nthird year of training (following a sort of logarithmic curve)\nbecause of the increasing specificity of the topics. In other\nwords, it would be important to know when the costs of a\nchess course overcome the benefits.\nThe third line of research could be useful to understand\nwhether other mathematical games can be used as educa-\ntional tools, and to understand which mathematical skills are\nenhanced by chess and by other games. Ferreira, Palhares,\nand Silva (2012) tested the correlation between the skills of\nchildren in some games (such as Dots and Boxes, Wari and\nTraffic Lights) and several mathematical factors (such as\nnumeric and geometric progression, counting, rotation) find-\ning that every game has specific correlation with one precise\nfactor. The study, although interesting, is correlational, so it\nis impossible to infer that those games can boost some\n8 SAGE Open\nmathematical abilities. Gobet (personal communication)\nsuggests that some aspects of the school curriculum might be\nbetter illustrated by other games, such as Awele, Go, and\nBridge. Not enough has been done to infer anything certain.\nIn conclusion, although many aspects of the potential\nbenefits of chess practice in children are still unknown, we\ncan state that the game of chess is a powerful tool to build\nchildren's problem-solving competence in the mathematical\ndomain, even with brief courses, such the one we propose to\nour pupils.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, J.
