The most common childhood cancers\ninclude leukemia, malignancies of the central nervous sys-\nall childhood cancers, respectively.1 Despite the improved\nsurvival rate of childhood malignancy, several solid cancers\nremain refractory to treatment. The discomfort that occurs\nduring the treatment course, such as nausea, vomiting, and\npain, is difficult to bear for these patients. The long-term\ntoxicity and sequelae of chemotherapy and radiotherapy\ncontinue to be concerning. The survivors may develop\nchronic health conditions and suffer from chronic fatigue,\nsleep disorders, psychological distress, neurocognitive dys-\nfunction, and a poor health-related quality of life. Another\nreason for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\nuse in children with cancer is the parents'desire to do every-\nthing possible to improve their child's health.\nCAM has become popular in the past few decades. The\nprevalence of CAM varies across different countries, rang-\ning from 6% to 91% in recent studies.2 CAM therapies used\nin pediatric cancer are mostly considered to be supportive\n1Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital,\nTaichung, Taiwan\n2School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung,\nTaiwan\n3Health Data Management Office, China Medical University Hospital,\nTaichung, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nHung-Rong Yen, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,\nDepartment of Medical Research, and Department of Chinese Medicine,\nChina Medical University Hospital, 2 Yude Road, North District,\nEmail: hungrongyen@gmail.com\nCharacteristics of Traditional Chinese\nMedicine Use in Pediatric Cancer\nPatients: A Nationwide, Retrospective,\nTaiwanese-Registry, Population-Based Study\nHung-Rong Yen, MD, PhD1,2, Wan-Yu Lai, MD1, Chih-Hsin Muo, MS3,\nand Mao-Feng Sun, MD, PhD1,2\n Keywords\ncancer, epidemiology, National Health Insurance Research Database, pediatrics, traditional Chinese medicine\ntherapies for relieving the symptoms of cancer, reducing\npain, or alleviating the side effects of conventional cancer\ntreatment.3 Some parents hope to boost the immune system\nof the affected child using CAM therapies.4 Traditional\nChinese medicine (TCM) consists of Chinese herbal reme-\ndies, acupuncture, and manipulative therapies and was\ndefined by the United States National Center for\nComplementary and Integrative Health as a whole medical\nsystem of CAM.5 TCM is one of the most common CAM\ntherapies used in various diseases such as stroke,6 diabetes\nmellitus,7 rheumatoid arthritis,8 and cancer9 in Taiwan.\nCurrent studies on the use of CAM among pediatric cancer\npatients are mostly small-scale studies.10 One large-scale\nstudy of the use of CAM in pediatric oncology patients in\nGermany reported that half of the children with cancer had\nused CAM but did not report which types of CAM therapy\nthe children had received. A large-scale nationwide survey\nof TCM use in pediatric cancer patients is yet to be per-\nformed in childhood cancer.\nThe National Health Insurance (NHI) program was insti-\ntuted in Taiwan in 1995. This program is a single-payer\nmandatory insurance system and has covered the medical\nexpenditures of approximately 23 million people, account-\ning for 99.6% of the total population.11 Although Western\nmedicine is in the mainstream in Taiwan, TCM is also\nwidely used, including in the pediatric population. The NHI\nprogram has reimbursed both Western medicine and TCM.\nThis system also provided unbiased economic choices for\ncancer treatment. All registration files and original claims\ndata for reimbursement were recorded in the National\nHealth Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Studies\nhave reported the characteristics of TCM use among the\ngeneral pediatric population5 and children with allergies12-14\nin Taiwan using the NHIRD.\nThe aim of our study was to investigate the characteris-\ntics of TCM use in pediatric cancer patients. We enrolled\nevery Taiwanese child with cancer who was registered as\nhaving catastrophic illness in the NHIRD. The results of\nthis study could offer epidemiological information about\nTCM applied in pediatric cancer patients.\nMaterials and Methods\nData Source\nThe NHI program has provided reimbursement for TCM\nsince 1996. Reimbursed TCM services include Chinese\nherbal remedies, acupuncture/moxibustion, and manipulative\ntherapy in ambulatory clinics.All registry data in the NHIRD\nconsist of demographic characteristics, clinical visits, hospi-\ntalizations, diagnostic codes, assessments, procedures, pre-\nscriptions, and the medical costs for reimbursement. The\nregistry for catastrophic illnesses patient database (RCIPD)\nwas also established in the NHIRD. Pediatric cancers are\nconsidered to be catastrophic illnesses and are registered by\ncertificate by pathology, image study, laboratory survey, and\ncareful review by pediatric hematologists or oncologists\ncommissioned by the NHI Administration. These cancer\npatients hold catastrophic illness certificates (CICs) and are\neligible for exclusion from copayments. Because the copay-\nments are waived for admission, emergency visits, and out-\npatient services, this certification is only applied when the\npatients meet all the criteria by pathology, image, laboratory,\nand clinical diagnoses. The CIC is canceled if a patient dies.\nThe accuracy of the diagnosis in the cancer population\nenrolled in this study was high. All the claims data in the\nstudy were from the RCIPD of the NHIRD in Taiwan.\nStudy Participants\nWe selected pediatric cancer patients from the RCIPD.\nFirst, all beneficiaries who had a diagnosis of cancer\n(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nwere registered in the RCIPD as having had a catastrophic\nincluded in this study. Second, individuals (n = 12\nyounger than 18 years of age were selected for this study\ncohort and included in the study. Those pediatric cancer\npatients who had at least 1 TCM outpatient clinical record\nwere defined as TCM users (n = 8086), whereas children\nwho had no TCM outpatient records were defined as non\u00ad\nTCM users (n = 4879). We divided the study cohort into\ninfants and toddlers (0-2 years old), preschoolers (3-5 years\nold), school-aged children (6-12 years old), and adolescents\n(13-18 years old) to analyze the differences among various\nage groups.\nTo investigate the differences between urban and rural\nareas, we used the definition of urbanization of the resi-\ndence area that was described in a previous study.15 The\nresidence area of the Taiwan townships was divided into 4\nlevels of urbanization. Level 1 had the highest degree of\nurbanization, and level 4 had the lowest degree. These 4\nlevels were categorized by population density (people/km2),\nby the population ratio of different educational levels, the\nratio of elderly people, the ratio of agricultural workers, and\nlevels 1 and 2 were defined as urban areas, and levels 3 and\n4 were defined as rural areas.\nData Availability Statement\nAll data are deposited in a properly managed public reposi-\ntory. In this study, we examined and analyzed datasets\nreleased from the NHIRD (http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/\nData_Subsets.html), which are maintained and managed by\nNational Health Research Institutes (http://nhird.nhri.org.\ntw/en), Taiwan.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll the data were analyzed by SAS software, version 9.2\n(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Univariate analysis was used\nto compare the TCM users with the non\u00adTCM users. The 2\ntest was performed to examine the relationship between the\ncategorical variables and to examine the differences\nbetween TCM users and non\u00adTCM users. The incidence\nrate ratio indicated the extent of the prevalence of disease in\nthe TCM user group relative to the non\u00adTCM users. A P\nvalue <.05 was defined as statistically significant.\nEthics Statement\nTheResearchEthicsCommitteeofChinaMedicalUniversity\nThe NHIRD was provided by the NHI Administration and\nmanaged by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.\nAll the released datasets of the NHIRD were deidentified\nand encrypted. Therefore, it was impossible to identify indi-\nvidual patients and care providers at any level.\nResults\nA total of 12965 children who had CICs of cancer between\nThe demographic characteristics between TCM users and\nnon\u00adTCM users are shown in Table 1. There were significant\ndifferences in the proportional distributions of age between\nthe TCM users and non\u00adTCM users. The percentage of TCM\nuse increased significantly in the older age groups, which\nincluded school-aged children and adolescents. The percent-\nage of TCM users in the younger age groups, including\ninfants, toddlers, and preschool children, was significantly\nlower than that of the non\u00adTCM users. There was no signifi-\ncant difference in the distributions of sex and urbanization.\nAll the pediatric cancer patients were diagnosed as having\ncatastrophic diseases by hematologists or oncologists.\nTherefore, they all received diagnoses and visited Western\nmedical doctors whether they were TCM users or non\u00adTCM\nusers. The percentage of patients receiving chemotherapy or\nradiotherapy was similar between these 2 groups. We found\nthat only 4 patients did not visit Western medical clinics after\ndiagnosis--that is, 99.95% of the TCM users still visited\nWestern medicine clinics. Treatment, including chemother-\napy and radiotherapy, was similar between these 2 groups.\nThe mean number of visits to the outpatient clinics in the 2\npopulations was similar, but the proportional distribution was\nnot. The majority (90.3%) of the TCM users visited TCM\nclinics fewer than 5 times annually.\nTo determine the frequency distribution of clinical visits\nbetween TCM and non\u00adTCM users in the pediatric cancer\npopulation, we analyzed the ICD-9-CM codes from the\nclaims data (Table 2). The 3 leading diseases for which TCM\nusers visited the clinics, including TCM or Western medi-\ncine consultations, were neoplasm (33.2%), respiratory sys-\ntem disease (32.9%), and infectious and parasitic diseases\n(8.86%), whereas non\u00adTCM users visited Western clinics\nand digestive system disease (10%). The rankings of these\ndisease categories were identical except the category \"cer-\ntain conditions originating in the perinatal period\" (Table 2).\nTo delineate the distribution of cancer categories between\nTCM and non\u00adTCM users, we analyzed the ICD-9-CM\ncodes of registry for catastrophic illnesses in these patients.\nThe top 10 cancer types of clinical visits in the TCM and\nnon-TCM groups among different age groups are shown in\nTable 3. In general, the TCM users had similar distribution\n(ranking) of cancer types as the non\u00adTCM users. The 3 lead-\nnant neoplasm of the brain (ICD code: 191), and malignant\nneoplasm of the eye, nervous system, and other specified\nchose only Western medicine (48%) rather than TCM\n(42.3%). Other cancer categories, such as malignant neo-\n4%), had a higher percentage of TCM users (Table 3).\nThe number of clinical visits in Table 2 includes both\nTCM and Western medicine clinical visits for TCM users. To\nfurther understand the treatment modalities utilized in TCM\nclinics, we determined the frequency distribution of various\nTCM therapies by major disease category (Table 4). Taking\nas an example musculoskeletal system and connective tissue\nwere for manipulative therapy, 26.04% were for acupuncture,\n4.47% were for manipulative therapy combined with herbal\nremedies, 4.26% were for acupuncture combined with herbal\nremedies, 2.69% were for manipulative therapy combined\nwith acupuncture, and 0.50% were for acupuncture, manipu-\nlative therapy, and herbal remedies.\nBy comparing the prevalence ratio of disease between\nTCM users and non\u00adTCM users, we found 4 common dis-\neases for which children with cancer tended to seek adjunc-\ntive TCM treatment. These diseases included allergic rhinitis,\ndyspepsia, disorders of menstruation, and diseases of the\nmusculoskeletal system and connective tissue (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first large-scale population-based investi-\ngation of adjunctive TCM use in children with cancer. TCM\nwas popular in this population, particularly among school-\naged children and adolescents. A total of 62.4% of children\nwith cancer had received complementary TCM treatment at\nsome point, and the population number was nearly 1.7 times\nas large as that of non\u00adTCM users. There was no difference\nbetween urban and rural populations, probably because\nTCM is highly accessible and its use is reimbursed by the\nNHI program.5 The most common diseases for which chil-\ndren with cancer visited the clinic, be they TCM users or\nnon\u00adTCM users, included respiratory system disease and\nneoplasm. TCM users visited the clinic less frequently for\nrespiratory system disease and digestive system disease.\nChildren with leukemia tended to seek the use of Western\nmedicine, whereas children with sarcoma or malignant neo-\nplasm of the brain or bone sought adjunctive TCM treat-\nment. This result was consistent with a study conducted in\nBritish Columbia that reported that patients with a poor\nprognosis in childhood cancer were more willing to try\nCAM therapies. The most common TCM therapy used was\nChinese herbal remedies. The pediatric cancer patients who\nhad comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis, dyspepsia,\ndisorders of menstruation, and disease of the musculoskel-\netal system and connective tissue, tended to visit the TCM\nclinic rather than a non-TCM clinic. Overall, this study\noffers pediatricians or oncologists epidemiological infor-\nmation about how TCM is being applied in pediatric cancer\npatients.\nThere were several strengths to this study. First, this is a\nnationwide, population-based study that enrolled all chil-\nwas larger than that of other studies. Second, the NIH pro-\ngram in Taiwan covers greater than 99% of the total popula-\ntion, and it reimbursed both Western medicine and TCM\nservices. Therefore, none of the claims data in the NHIRD\nhad any selection bias. Third, pediatric cancer patients with\nCICs were confirmed by pathology, image studies, a series\nof laboratory surveys, and careful review by hematologists\nand oncologists commissioned by the NHI Administration.\nTable 1.

TCM\nalso became popular for cancer care in Europe. In a large\nsurvey in Europe, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and TCM\nwere the main CAM therapies used to reduce adverse reac-\ntions to chemoradiotherapy.21\nThe most common diseases for which TCM or non\u00ad\nTCM users among pediatric cancer patients visited clinics\nwas respiratory system disease and neoplasm. Respiratory\nsystem disease was also the most common reason for chil-\ndren visiting outpatient clinics in Taiwan.5 This is likely\nbecause upper- or lower-respiratory tract infection repre-\nsent the most common acute illness in children, especially\nin cancer patients with immune compromised status.\nMoreover, several chemotherapeutic agents such as metho-\ntrexate, cyclophosphamide, and busulphan used in condi-\ntioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation may also\naffect pulmonary function.22-24 We found that TCM users\nhad lower visiting rates for respiratory system disease.\nWhether complementary TCM therapy can improve lung\nfunction deserves further investigations. Discomforts of the\ndigestive system are also among the top reasons for TCM\nusers to visit TCM clinics. Digestive disorders, including\ndiarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, are the most common\nsymptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radio-\ntherapy. Previous clinical trials have reported that Chinese\nherbal medicines may be effective in treating these side\neffects.25-27 The efficacy and safety in pediatric cancer\npatients also need further investigations.\nIn our study, when compared with non\u00adTCM users,\npediatric cancer patients with allergic rhinitis, dyspepsia,\ndisorders of menstruation, and musculoskeletal disease\ntended to use TCM. This result was similar to our previous\nstudy in the pediatric population in Taiwan.5 In contrast to a\nprevious study in an adult population with cancer in\nThailand, cancer patients with pain, dyspepsia, abdominal\nor visceral pain, insomnia, and fatigue tended to use TCM.28\nAllergic rhinitis had a high prevalence rate among children\nin Taiwan,29 and some clinical trials had observed that\nherbal medicines and acupuncture were effective in treating\nTable 2.

Many clinical trials have\nsuggested that TCM may be effective at treating cancer-\nrelated pain, and the effects are similar to those of Western\nanalgesics.40 In contrast to other diseases, TCM doctors\nprefer providing acupuncture and manipulative therapies to\ntreat musculoskeletal problems.\nThere are some limitations of our study. First, some\nTCM services such as Chinese herbal decoctions and pro-\nprietary Chinese medicine purchased directly from TCM\nherbal pharmacies were not covered by NHI. This may have\nresulted in an underestimation of the frequency of herb use.\nNevertheless, TCM services are fully reimbursed for cancer\npatients holding a CIC. Hence, we can be certain that the\ncoverage of the TCM services in the study is high. The\nunderestimation would be relatively small and acceptable.\nSecond, all claims data were from RCIPD and collected by\nICD-9-CM code numbers of pediatric cancer. We were\nunable to obtain information on the tumor stage to discrimi-\nnate differences in TCM use in early and late stages.\nHowever, this study still provides the general concept and\ncharacteristics of TCM use among children with cancer.\nConclusion\nIn this large-scale, nationwide, population-based study, we\nfound that complementary TCM use among children with\nTable 3.
