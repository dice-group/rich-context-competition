Current alcohol\nconsumption was defined as 1 alcoholic drink per month.\nRESULTS -- After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, tobacco use,\nphysical activity, and diet, subjects who consumed 1\u00ad19 and 20 drinks of alcohol per month\nhad odds ratios (ORs) for the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome of 0.65 and 0.34, respec-\ntively (P  0.05 for all), compared with current nondrinkers. These findings were particularly\nnoteworthy for beer and wine drinkers. The association of 20 alcoholic drinks per month with\nthe prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was consistent across ethnicities but was most striking\nin white men and women (ORs 0.35 and 0.22, respectively; P  0.05). Alcohol consumption was\nsignificantly and inversely associated with the prevalence of the following three components of\nthe metabolic syndrome: low serum HDL cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides, high waist\ncircumference, as well as hyperinsulinemia (P  0.05 for all).\nCONCLUSIONS -- Mild to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prev-\nalence of the metabolic syndrome, with a favorable influence on lipids, waist circumference, and\nfasting insulin. This association was strongest among whites and among beer and wine drinkers.\nLight to moderate alcohol consump-\ntion is associated with lower cardio-\nvascular mortality (1) and a reduced\nrisk of developing type 2 diabetes (2).\nSome of the biological mechanisms re-\nported to explain this observation include\nan improvement of the lipid profile, espe-\ncially HDL cholesterol (3) and increasing\ninsulin sensitivity (4,5).\nThe metabolic syndrome is a cluster-\ning of low serum HDL cholesterol, ele-\nvated serum triglycerides, hyperglycemia,\ncentral obesity, and elevated blood pres-\nsure, mediated in part by insulin resis-\ntance (6,7). The metabolic syndrome is\nassociated with an increased risk of devel-\noping diabetes (8) and cardiovascular dis-\nThe favorable influence of alcohol\nconsumption on select components of the\nmetabolic syndrome (3,10) raises the pos-\nsibility that alcohol intake may reduce the\nrisk of the metabolic syndrome.

We defined the metabolic\nsyndrome using the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program definition (6). This\ndefinition was satisfied if a subject pos-\nsessed three or more of the following five\ncriteria: an abdominal waist circumfer-\nwomen; serum triglycerides 150 mg/dl\n(1.69 mmol/l); serum HDL cholesterol\nor currently taking antihypertensive med-\nication; or fasting serum glucose 110\nmg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) or on oral anti-\ndiabetic medication. We averaged the sec-\nond and third systolic and diastolic blood\npressure readings for each subject. Sub-\njects were also classified as hyperinsuline-\nmic if the fasting insulin level was 90th\npercentile of its distribution among sub-\njects in the sample (this value corre-\nsponded to a fasting insulin 166 pmol/\nl). This percentile was selected based on\nwork by Meigs et al. (18).\nExposure: alcohol intake (type and\namount). In NHANES III, alcohol con-\nsumption was assessed by asking each\nparticipant to quantify the number of\ndrinks consumed in the past month be-\nfore the survey of three different types of\nalcohol: 1) beer or light beer; 2) wine,\nwine coolers, sangria, and champagne;\nand 3) hard liquor such as tequila, gin,\nvodka, scotch, rum, whiskey, and li-\nqueurs, either alone or mixed. We defined\nalcohol consumption as 1) currently\ndrinking (1 drink of any type per\nmonth) or not currently drinking (1 per\nmonth); 2) the number per month of any\n20); and 3) the number of beverage-\n20). Further categorization of the alco-\nhol variable was not possible due to inad-\nequate numbers. The not currently\ndrinking category (1 drink per month)\nincluded subjects consuming at least 12\ndrinks of any type over a subject's lifetime\nbut not currently drinking alcohol (past\ndrinkers) and subjects consuming 12\ndrinks in their entire lifetime (lifetime ab-\nstainers). Types of alcohol consumed\nwere divided into three categories: beer,\nwine, and liquor.\nCovariates. The definitions of the co-\nvariates used in this study were based on\nmetabolic syndrome risk factors de-\nscribed by Park et al. (11). Race/ethnicity\nwas based on the screener and subject\nself-report. We used three categories:\nnon-Hispanic white (white), non-\nHispanic black (black), and Mexican\nAmerican. Other racial/ethnic groups\nwere not included in our analysis because\nof inadequate numbers.\nLevel of education was categorized\ngrade, and 12th grade education. An-\nnual household income from the previous\nphysically inactive if they expended 3.5\nmetabolic equivalents/month participat-\ning in walking, jogging, running, bicycle\nriding, swimming, aerobics, aerobic\ndancing, other types of dancing, calis-\nthenics, exercises, or garden work. To-\nbacco use was divided into current user,\npast user (100 cigarettes in their life-\ntime but currently not smoking), or never\nsmoker. The percentage of daily total en-\nergy intake from carbohydrates (kilocalo-\nries) was calculated and divided into\non hormone replacement therapy were\nnot available; we did, however, use post-\nmenopausal status as a covariate because\nit has been shown to be a risk factor for\nthe metabolic syndrome (11). Women\nwere considered postmenopausal if they\nhad not had a menstrual period in the past\n12 months. Age was used as continuous\nvariable as well as categorized into cate-\nStatistical analysis\nFor each sex and race/ethnicity, we calcu-\nlated the prevalences of the metabolic\nsyndrome, of each component of the syn-\ndrome, and of all covariates. Multiple lo-\ngistic regression analyses were used to\nestimate the ORs for the prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome and each of its com-\nponents using all three definitions of al-\ncohol consumption as independent\nvariables (separate analyses for each)\nwhile adjusting for covariates. For race/\nethnicity-specific models, interaction was\nassessed using an interaction term be-\ntween race/ethnicity and the number of\nalcoholic drinks per month for men and\nwomen. Because BMI was highly corre-\nlated with waist circumference (r  0.87,\nstituent criteria for our dependent vari-\nable, we felt BMI served more as a proxy\nthan a predictor for waist circumference.\nWe did not, therefore, include BMI as a\ncovariate in our primary analyses. We did\nperform secondary analyses with BMI as a\ncovariate, and the inclusion of BMI did\nnot alter the relationship between alcohol\nand the metabolic syndrome (data not\nshown).\nAll analyses used sampling weights to\nreport estimates that would be represen-\ntative of the U.S. population. We used\nSUDAAN statistical software (19) to ob-\ntain proper variance estimates to calculate\nweighted means, percentages, standard\nerrors, and ORs given the NHANES III\ncomplex sampling design. A two-sided P\nvalue of 0.05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant.

This difference, how-\never, was not accompanied by a statisti-\ncally significant interaction term between\nrace/ethnicity and the number of alco-\nholic drinks per month for men (P \nAlthough increasing quantities of al-\ncohol consumption were associated with\na lower OR for the prevalence of the met-\nabolic syndrome in the overall popula-\ntion, this association was not consistent\nfor each of the components.

The inverse\nrelation of alcohol consumption and the\nmetabolic syndrome was especially no-\nticeable in people who consume 20 al-\ncoholic beverages per month and was\nstronger when the beverage was beer or\nwine. Although the association between\nalcohol consumption and the metabolic\nsyndrome was present for all race/\nethnicities, it was particularly strong in\nwhite individuals.\nInconsistent results have been re-\nTable 1--Characteristics of study population*\nCharacteristics of study population Men Women\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nPhysical activity 3.5 Mets of physical\nactivity per month\nTobacco use\nDiet (% kcal from carbohydrate)\nNumber of alcoholic drinks per month\nNumber of beer drinks per month\nNumber of wine drinks per month\nNumber of liquor drinks per month\nWaist circumference 102 cm (men) or\nSerum HDL cholesterol 1.04 mmol/l\nData are percent  SE. *Percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding effect; percentages were\ncalculated using sampling weights to report estimates that would be representative of the U.S. population.\nAlcohol and the metabolic syndrome\nported between alcohol and the metabolic\nported that 1\u00ad15 g of alcohol per day was\nassociated with decreased prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome, whereas Park et\nal. (11) reported a decrease only in\nwomen. This difference may relate to the\nfact that Park et al. (11) included in the\n\"heavy\" drinking category participants\nwho had a history of \"ever consuming five\nor more drinks almost daily\" even if they\nwere not currently drinking. Further-\nmore, participants were included if they\nfasted for 6 h, whereas the present study\nand that of Yoon et al.

In con-\ntrast, only a few studies have shown a\nbeneficial effect of alcohol consumption\nmajority of studies support our finding\nthat alcohol consumption results in ele-\nvated blood pressure (33). The strength of\nthe association between alcohol consump-\ntion and the metabolic syndrome may de-\npend heavily upon the prevalence of these\nindividual criteria in a given population.\nWe found that the reduced preva-\nlence of metabolic syndrome was stronger\namong drinkers of wine and beer than of\nliquor. This could result if liquor consum-\ners drank larger amounts or had a differ-\nent pattern of consumption (e.g., binge\nshowed that among individuals consum-\ning 50 total drinks per month, the mean\nnumber of drinks of liquor consumed\n(18.7) was more than twice that of wine\ndifference in the light-drinking categories.\nTable 2--Multivariable adjusted OR for the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 8,125\nindividuals from the NHANES III stratified by quantity and type of alcohol consumption\nQuantity and type of alcohol\nconsumption\nOR for the metabolic\nDrinks consumed per month*\nType and quantity of drinks per month\nBeer\nWine\nLiquor\n*Model 1 adjusted for age (as a continuous variable), sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, or Mexican American),\nuse (current, past, or never), physical activity ( or 3.5 Mets of activity per month), and diet (40, 40\u00ad60,\nor 60% kcal from carbohydrates).

Although testing of interaction was\nstatistically not significant, we had limited\npower to evaluate for effect modification\nby race at the highest quantities of alcohol\nconsumption. Previous studies have re-\nported a relation between increased alco-\nhol consumption and hypertension (33)\nand a higher prevalence of hypertension\nin blacks (36), and our data show that\nblacks were heavier drinkers. Of the cur-\nrent drinkers in our sample, 9.3% of black\nmen and 3.4% of black women currently\nconsumed at least 50 drinks per month,\nwhereas this was lower in white men\nDifferences by race/ethnicity may also\nrelate to insulin sensitivity or hyperinsu-\nlinemia (37). Whereas hyperinsulinemia\nis not a criterion for the metabolic syn-\ndrome, studies suggest that it is an impor-\ntant element of the syndrome (7). Using\nfactor analysis, Meigs et al. (18) con-\ncluded that a unified metabolic syndrome\nincluded three independent factors: hy-\nperinsulinemia, obesity, and dyslipide-\nmia. Among black nondiabetic subjects,\nhowever, insulin sensitivity is decreased\nas compared with white subjects (38).\nSimilarly, fasting insulin concentrations\nare higher among black women as com-\npared with white women at similar levels\nof adiposity (39). In the present study, we\nfound that the odds for the prevalence of\nhyperinsulinemia, after adjusting for our\ncovariates including BMI, was higher\namong blacks as compared with whites\nAlthough the strengths of our investi-\ngations include the use of a large sample\nrepresentative of the adult U.S. popula-\ntion (thereby enhancing our generaliz-\nability), the evaluation of both the type\nand the quantity of alcohol consumed,\nand the assessment of effect modification\nby race/ethnicity, there are several limita-\ntions that merit comment. First, given the\ncross-sectional design, we cannot draw\nany causal inferences regarding the asso-\nciation of alcohol consumption with the\nmetabolic syndrome. Second, the data on\nalcohol consumption are based on self-\nreport with the possibility of misclassifi-\ncation of exposure (e.g., under reporting).\nHowever, this bias, if nondifferential,\nwould be expected only to increase the\namounts of alcohol associated with a re-\nduced prevalence of the metabolic syn-\ndrome. Third, categories with the highest\nquantities of alcohol consumption had\nthe fewest number of individuals, thus\nlimiting our ability to comment on the\nrelation of alcohol consumption to the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome in\nheavy drinkers. Finally, we cannot com-\nment on the effects of daily patterns of\nalcohol consumption, as these data were\nnot available.\nIn summary, mild to moderate alco-\nhol consumption, especially of beer and\nwine, is associated with a lower preva-\nlence of the metabolic syndrome and with\na favorable influence on serum lipids,\nwaist circumference, and fasting serum\ninsulin. This observed association be-\ntween alcohol consumption and the met-\nabolic syndrome was particularly strong\nin white individuals.\n"
