The possibility that\nmen display altruism to signal their genetic quality may be tested by examining women's\npreference for men's altruism across the stages of the menstrual cycle. Because women can\nmaximize reproductive benefits by mating with men who have \"good genes\" on high-\nfertility versus low-fertility days, women should show a heightened preference for male\naltruism on high-fertility days compared to low-fertility days, and this heightened\npreference should be more apparent when women evaluate men for short-term sexual\nrelationships than for long-term committed relationships. The possibility that men display\naltruism to signal their willingness to provision, as opposed to their genetic quality, may be\ntested by examining women's preference for men's altruism toward different recipients.\nMore specifically, altruistic behavior toward family members may reflect a willingness to\nprovide resources for kin and, hence, willingness to provision, whereas altruistic behavior\ntoward strangers may function as an honest signal of genetic quality. In two samples of\nyoung women (Ns = 131 and 481), we found no differences between high- and low-fertility\nparticipants in preference for men's altruism, and women preferred men's altruism more in\nlong-term than short-term relationships.

On the men's side, it\nhas been shown that men display altruistic behavior in the presence of women, especially\nwhen other men (intrasexual competitors) are present. For example, men contribute more to\ncharity and engage in more competition with each other for contribution in a public-goods\ngame in order to impress women (Iredale, Van Vugt, and Dunbar, 2008; Van Vugt and\nIredale, 2013). This male display of altruism has also been observed in non-Western\ncultures like Senegal (Tognetti, Berticat, Raymond, and Faurie, 2012), where men's\ncharitable donations as part of their winnings after a sequential public-goods game\nincreased when in the presence of young women compared to when in the presence of old\nwomen. These studies indicate that men try to show their altruism to women, which\nsuggests an influence of female choice on men's altruistic behaviors.\nOn the women's side, several studies have indicated that women have preferences\nfor altruistic men as mates. For example, women respond significantly more positively than\nmen on an altruism scale when identifying desirable characteristics in mates (Phillips,\nBarnard, Ferguson, and Reader, 2008). Another study showed that women prefer altruists\nrather than non-altruists for single dates, whereas men have no such preference (Barclay,\nThere are two possible mechanisms by which women's preference for altruism\ncould lead to an increase in women's reproductive fitness. First, altruism in men could be\nan indicator of their willingness to invest in their offspring. Because men's parental\ninvestment has been an important factor in the survival and health of offspring over the\ncourse of human evolution, it is crucial that women choose a male partner willing to\nallocate resources toward their future children (Brase, 2006). Second, altruism in men may\nbe an indicator of the possession of \"good genes.\" According to the handicap principle\n(Zahavi, 1975), costly traits are an accurate signal of the phenotypic and genotypic quality\nof a man and, therefore, likely to be chosen by women. Altruism can be one of those costly\nGiven the two possible mechanisms mentioned above, it is noteworthy that women\nengage in both short-term and long-term mating strategies (Buss and Schmitt, 1993), and\nthe traits they desire in a partner vary according to the strategy they employ (Pillsworth and\nHaselton, 2006). Even though women could maximize their reproductive benefits by\nforming a long-term relationship with a man who is both high in genetic quality and highly\nsuitable as a provider, not all men possess both characteristics. Therefore, it is expected\nthat, as a short-term strategy, women demand male genetic traits that guarantee the high\nadaptive value of offspring. As a long-term strategy, on the other hand, women are\npredicted to desire the ability and willingness of men to provide for their offspring. Indeed,\nstudies on the mate preferences of women have confirmed these predictions (e.g.,\nChanges in women's mating strategies are--at least partly--related to their\nmenstrual cycle. On high-fertility days relative to low-fertility days, women can maximize\ntheir reproductive benefits by mating with men who have \"good genes\"; this is expected to\nbe reflected in their mate preferences. In fact, women exhibit menstrual cycle shifts in their\nmate preferences, as documented in dozens of studies, including a meta-analysis by\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nand 12 unpublished studies that evaluated the plausibility of these shifts. These authors\ndemonstrated that cycle shifts are specific to women's preference for cues of genetic\nquality such as body masculinity or facial symmetry (but see also Wood, Kerssel, Joshi,\nand Louie [2014], who failed to find consistent effects regarding the influence of hormonal\ncycling on women's mate preferences).\nBased on these observations, it may be hypothesized that, on the one hand, if the\naltruistic behavior of men is an indicator of good genes, then women in the high-fertility\nperiod would reveal a stronger preference for such men than women in the low-fertility\nperiod would. Moreover, this heightened preference for altruism during high versus low\nfertility is more likely to be identified in short-term rather than long-term relationships. On\nthe other hand, if the altruistic behavior of men is an indicator of provisioning, then it will\nbe more preferred in a long-term rather than a short-term relationship and a cycle shift will\nnot be observed. Of course, these predictions do not necessarily contradict each other. From\nthis viewpoint, Farrelly (2011) investigated women's preferences toward men's altruistic\nbehavior using vignettes of different examples of cooperation (personality, generosity, and\nheroism) and a self-report scale of altruism to examine women's preferences toward\npotential mates for different relationship types at different stages of their menstrual cycle.\nIn this study, women's fertility did not have an effect on the preference for altruistic\nbehavior, and altruistic characteristics were considered more important in long-term than in\nshort-term mates. Given the results, Farrelly (2011) concluded that altruism in men is an\nimportant factor during mate choice because it is an indicator of provisioning rather than a\nsignal of good genes. However, Farrelly (2011) did not examine preferences for altruistic\nbehaviors toward different recipients.\nIn studying the evolution of altruism, it is important to distinguish between several\ntypes of altruism based on the relationships between the altruists and the recipients. If the\ntwo parties are related, the altruistic behavior can be explained by kin selection (Hamilton,\n1964), where the altruism aids the genes of the actor. Altruistic behavior between non-kin\nacquaintances or friends is considered to have evolved based on direct reciprocation, in\nwhich the actor of the altruistic behavior is later rewarded by the recipient following\nrepeated encounters between them (Trivers, 1971). Humans also show altruistic behavior\ntoward strangers. Indirect reciprocity and competitive altruism theories propose that the\nactors benefit in the long-term by \"purchasing\" increased cooperation from others when\nthey \"pay\" for altruistic behavior. In this case, the reward is delayed and uncertain.\nTherefore, altruistic behavior toward a stranger is the most costly among the three types of\naltruism. This implies the possibility that altruism toward strangers may appeal to women\nas a trait to aid in the selection of a potential mate. Oda, Shibata, Kiyonari, Takeda, and\nMatsumoto-Oda (2013) investigated the preferences of each gender for altruistic behaviors\nperformed in daily life by members of the opposite sex toward various recipients using an\naltruism scale. These authors found that the preference for opposite-sex altruism differs\naccording to the recipient, and relationship type may influence this preference: Altruistic\nbehaviors toward family members are more preferred in long-term rather than short-term\nrelationships, altruistic behaviors toward friends and acquaintances are less preferred in\nlong-term relationships, and there is no difference in the preference for altruistic behaviors\ntoward strangers between short-term and long-term relationships. Although Barclay (2010)\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nreported that opposite-sex altruism is more preferred in long-term relationships, it depended\non the recipient of the altruistic behaviors.\nBased on these theories and preceding evidence, it is hypothesized that if altruism is\npreferred because it serves as an indicator of one's willingness to provide for future\nchildren, then altruistic behavior toward kin should be more preferred for long-term rather\nthan short-term mates, and women's fertility should not affect their preference. If altruism\nin men is an indicator of genetic quality, then women in the high-fertility period will\nconsider opposite-sex altruism toward strangers as more important than women in the low-\nfertility period, and this tendency will be greater in short-term relationships.\nThus, the present study investigated the preferences of women in either the high- or\nlow-fertility period for altruistic behaviors enacted in daily life by the opposite sex toward\nvarious recipients. The Self-Report Altruism Scale Distinguished by the Recipient (SRAS-\nDR), which was developed to evaluate altruism in Japanese undergraduates (Oda, Dai, et\nal., 2013), was employed to evaluate the altruistic behaviors enacted during daily life and to\nclassify these behaviors according to the recipient (family members, friends and\nacquaintances, or strangers). If altruistic behavior toward a family member is preferred for\nlong-term rather than short-term mates, then altruism in men will be seen as a signal for\nprovisioning. If women in the high-fertility period evaluate opposite-sex altruism toward\nstrangers as more important than women in the low-fertility period, and this tendency is\ngreater in a short-term relationship, this will support the hypothesis that altruism in men is\na signal for genetic quality.\nMaterials and Methods\nPreference survey\nFirst, participants rated the desirability of each of the 21 items on the SRAS-DR\n(see Table 1) from \"1\" (not so desirable) to \"5\" (very desirable) for both a short-term mate\n(\"a partner with whom you have casual sex\"; i.e., a partner with whom you have a short-\nterm relationship) and a long-term mate (\"a partner whom you marry\"; i.e., a partner with\nwhom you have a long-term relationship). Details concerning the development of this\ninstrument and its items are described in the Supplemental Material supplied by Oda,\nShibata, et al. (2013). Although a spouse (non-kin) may be regarded as a family member,\nthe SRAS-DR was developed for undergraduates, and most undergraduates in Japan are not\nmarried. Therefore, a recipient who is a \"family member\" can be considered kin, \"friends\nand acquaintances\" may be regarded as partners with whom a reciprocal relationship is\nmaintained, and \"strangers\" can be considered others without this type of relationship.\nItems were presented randomly. We calculated the total score for each subscale to measure\nthe altruistic behavior desirability score of each recipient (possible range = 7 to 35 for each\nsubscale).\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nTable 1.

Based on a previous study (Lukaszewski and Roney, 2009), they provided\nthree pieces of information: 1) the first day of last menstrual bleeding, 2) an estimation of\nthe number of days until the beginning of the next menstrual bleeding, and 3) the duration\nof a typical cycle. If the participant's report was accurate, the number of days from the first\nday of the last menstrual bleeding (i.e., cycle day) should be equal to the typical cycle\nlength minus the number of days until the beginning of the next cycle. If the participant's\ntypical cycle day was more than 5 days from what the formula would predict, then it was\nassumed that the participant reported inaccurate information and these participants were\nexcluded from the analyses. Pregnant participants and those who were taking hormonal\ncontraceptives or supplements were also excluded.\nHigh- and low-fertility days were estimated using the modified backward counting\nmethod, which assumes that ovulation occurs 14 days prior to the onset of the next menses\n(Gildersleeve et al., 2014). High-fertility days were defined as the five days prior to\novulation and the day of ovulation because these are the days on which conception is most\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nlikely to occur (Wilcox, Dunson, Weinberg, Trussell, and Baird, 2001), and low-fertility\ndays included the remainder of the cycle. Furthermore, a comparison of the actual\nconception probabilities between the high- and low-fertility groups was conducted to\ndetermine whether this grouping was accurate.\nParticipants\nSample A. Sample A in the present study included 309 female undergraduates from\nthree women's universities in Japan. The study was conducted in several classes and the\nparticipants did not receive a monetary reward for their involvement. Each participant\nreceived a booklet containing questions regarding the preference rating and the menstrual\ncycle survey in a classroom. After the exclusion of participants who provided inaccurate\ninformation and/or did not complete the questionnaire, the ratings of 131 women (mean\nage: 19.0 \u00b1 1.0 years) were analyzed for each item. Of these participants, 15 were in the\nhigh-fertility period and 116 were in the low-fertility period. Based on a Welch two-sample\nt-test, conception probability (Wilcox et al., 2001) was significantly higher in the high-\nSample B. Sample B in the present study included 764 Japanese female\nundergraduates recruited through Macromill, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), which is a research\nagency that maintains a panel of more than 500,000 individuals who have provided\ninformed consent and have agreed to participate in web-based online survey research. The\ncandidates were asked whether they would reply to private questions, such as those\nregarding menstrual cycles, and only those who consented were included in the analyses.\nEach participant answered questions regarding their preference rating and the menstrual\ncycle survey using an online survey. Following the exclusion of participants who provided\ninaccurate information and/or did not complete the questionnaire, the ratings of 481 women\n(mean age: 20.7 \u00b1 1.3 years) were analyzed for each item. Of these participants, 88 were in\nthe high-fertility period and 393 were in the low-fertility period. Using a Welch two-sample\nt-test, conception probability was significantly higher in the high-fertility group (mean\nStatistical analyses\nThe desirability scores from sample A and B were combined and analyzed using an\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA), with the recipient of the altruistic behaviors (family,\nfriends and acquaintances, or strangers) and partner type (short- or long-term relationship)\nas within-subject variables, and the fertility of the participants (high or low) and the sample\n(A or B) as a between-subject variable.\nResults\nThe desirability scores for altruistic behaviors toward each type of recipient for both\nshort-term and long-term mates are provided (see Figure 1; see Table A1 in Appendix for\nmore details). The main effects of partner type and recipient were significant, as was the\ninteraction (see Table 2). The simple effects of the interaction indicated that there were no\ndifferences in the preference for altruistic behaviors toward each recipient in short-term\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nG = 0.08. A multiple comparison revealed that altruism toward family members\nwas the most desired, and the second was altruism toward strangers. Neither the main effect\nof fertility of the participants nor the first-order interactions between fertility and the other\nfactors were significant. Although a second-order interaction among fertility, sample, and\npartner type was significant, the effect size was relatively small. The pattern of desirability\nscore suggested that fertility had some effect only in short-term relationships in sample A\n(see Figure 1a). Therefore, we analyzed the interaction between fertility and sample in\nshort-term relationships. The result of the three-way ANOVA with the recipient of the\naltruistic behaviors (family, friends and acquaintances, or strangers) as within-subject\nvariables and the fertility of the participants (high or low) and the sample (A or B) as\nbetween-subject variables indicated that there was no significant interaction between\nTable 2.

Mean and SE of desirability score by questionnaire divided by each recipient of\naltruistic behaviors and partner type for (a) sample A and (b) sample B\nNote. ST = short-term relationship; LT = long-term relationship\nDiscussion\nThe findings from this study demonstrate that women preferred altruistic behaviors\nin long-term relationship partners more than in short-term relationship partners. This\npreference was particularly pronounced for altruistic behaviors toward family members.\nMoreover, this finding was not influenced by the difference between samples, which\nindicates that this is a robust finding. Although Farrelly (2011) did not consider differences\nin the recipients of the altruistic behavior in their analyses, the present study revealed that\nthese differences were manifested to a greater degree in the preference for altruism toward\nfamily members. According to Oda et al. (2014), who investigated the relationships among\nthe subscales of the SRAS-DR and the Big Five personality scale, conscientiousness\nsignificantly contributes to altruism toward family members. People low in\nconscientiousness were less responsible to their partners, while highly conscientious people\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nwere less likely to get divorced (Roberts, Jackson, Fayard, Edmonds, and Meints, 2009).\nThis strongly suggests that altruism in men is a signal of willingness to provide resources to\nfuture children. The second-most preferred altruistic behavior were that toward strangers,\nwhich was significantly more preferred than that toward friends or acquaintances. Although\na woman can view altruistic behavior toward family members as a signal of willingness to\ncare for future children, it is useless to choose a faithful man as her partner if he has no\nresources to provide. Altruistic behaviors toward strangers require enough resources to\nspare for performing. Therefore, it might be a signal of having resources or of the potential\nfor resource acquisition. Our results, however, suggest that it is not a signal of genetic\nquality.\nHigh- and low-fertility women did not differ in their preferences for men's altruistic\nbehavior, which corroborates the findings of Farrelly (2011). The only possible effect was\nthe second-order interaction among fertility, sample, and partner type. However, the pattern\nof desirability scores revealed that, in sample A, women in low-fertility tended to prefer\nmale altruism when selecting short-term relationship partners than women in high-fertility\n(though the interaction was not significant), which was contrary to our prediction. Although\nboth the questionnaire study and the online survey were performed on female\nundergraduates, the situations and environments in which the participants were placed were\ndifferent. The questionnaire study was performed in various classrooms at women's\nuniversities, whereas the online survey was not restricted to students at women's\nuniversities and individuals responded to the scale independently using a personal\ncomputer. A number of factors, such as the frequency of interaction with men of the same\nage, might have caused the subtle second-order interaction. Oda, Shibata, et al. (2013)\nfound that, compared to men, women more strongly prefer altruism toward strangers\nirrespective of relationship/partner type. Thus, the authors hypothesized that altruistic\nbehaviors toward strangers are costly signals that indicate men's genetic quality. The\nresults of the present, study, however, do not support that hypothesis. The results of\nFarrelly (2011) and the present study suggest, instead, that men's altruistic behaviors\nfunction more as signals of their willingness to provision than as signals of their genetic\nquality.\nNegative results may raise the question of whether the methods employed in this\nstudy were appropriate. Because the present study utilized between-subject comparisons,\nindividual differences in preference could weaken the possible effects of fertility. However,\nthe ovulation estimation methods used here have been employed by numerous previous\nstudies. In fact, shifts in women's preference for other cues of genetic quality based on\novulation were revealed using the same estimation method (Gildersleeve et al., 2014).\nMoreover, we analyzed a sufficient sample, and similar results were obtained using two\ndifferent sampling methods; the questionnaire and the web-based online survey.\nNevertheless, to confirm the present results, further studies on preference shifts using\nwithin-subject methods are needed. Hormonal measures of fertility have been employed in\nseveral previous studies (e.g., Haselton, Mortezaie, Pillsworth, Bleske-Rechek, and\nFrederick, 2007), which would also advance our findings.\nOne limitation of this study is in the SRAS-DR, in which the situations and\nbehaviors referenced by items differ across recipients because each item describes a\nspecific and realistic example. A possible solution would be to use the same items for each\ncategory of recipient. For example, \"I have listened to the troubles and complaints of\nPreference for altruism across menstrual cycle\nfamily members\" and \"I have listened to the troubles and complaints of strangers\" as well\nas \"I have listened to the troubles and complaints of a friend/acquaintance.\" This would\nallow for comparisons of desirability of each behavior with that of other behaviors.\nHowever, few opportunities to listen to the troubles and complaints of strangers exist\ncompared with the opportunities to listen to those of family members and friends. During\nthe development of the SRAS-DR, students were asked to describe their altruistic behavior\nin daily life and to classify it according to recipient. Listening to the troubles of strangers\nwas not mentioned at that time, indicating that the frequency of that behavior was lower\nthan that of listening to the troubles of family members or friends. Low-frequency behavior\nwould not function as an effective signal. Moreover, when one considers behavior as a\nsignal, the recipients of such behaviors and the behaviors themselves are inseparable and\nco-vary. That is, the tendency to be generous toward strangers implies the ability to\nperform the kind of behavior that would qualify as being generous toward strangers. The\nrecipient of an altruistic behavior and the behavior itself function together as a signal.\nAnother limitation is that the participants were restricted to undergraduates. The\nSRAS-DR was developed to investigate the frequency of altruistic behavior in Japanese\nundergraduate students. Because each item describes a specific and realistic example, it is\ndifficult to apply the scale to other groups that may differ in terms of age and/or socio-\ncultural background. Indeed, it is valid to employ undergraduate students as a sample for\nthis type of study because this population is in the peak of fertility and mate preference\nmight directly influence their reproductive fitness in an ancestral environment. Regardless,\nsimilar research should be conducted using female subjects from a broader group of ages\nand a variety of socio-cultural backgrounds.\nIn conclusion, it is suggested that men's altruistic behavior functions as a signal of\nwillingness to provision toward their future children in a long-term relationship and female\nchoice has driven the evolution of men's display of their altruism. The meaning of altruistic\nbehavior differs with relationships between the altruists and the recipients. Men's altruistic\nbehaviors, therefore, convey different information depending on their recipients. This is the\nfirst study examining women's preference for men's altruistic behavior from such a\nviewpoint. Further studies are expected to investigate whether the actual selection of\nspouse reflects this preference.\n"
